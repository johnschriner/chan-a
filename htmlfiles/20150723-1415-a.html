[ I got to say this part was pretty creepy. Loved it.  <br> Idom@ster </br>  new day, a new cat card    So nobody likes Dekoration?  Pretty kitty titty  Too bad P-chan wasnt Mayu's target, I wanted to see her have more animated scenes  <br>People do. The anons in the previous thread were just being cunts as usual.</br>  <br>It is however true that they failed completely getting any popularity.</br>  Momoka, Arisu, Nina group in the anime when?    <br> cow 79 <br>How many of her pictures do you have anon?</br></br>  Are you l@dy cake bros?<br><br>Will TakeP X Kaede canon?</br></br>    <br>Maybe he has other pictures of cows. How do you know he doesn't just really like cows?</br>  <br>A lot of people probably do, it's just Dekoration wouldn't be their favorite</br>  <br>You wouldn't a cat.</br>  <br>They are my favorite.<br><br><br>It's be a miracle even for one of them to be featured.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't mean it in a "no one has them as their favorite" kind of way, but there really shouldn't be a unit no one likes.</br>  You will never make KWSM regreat last night. <br><br>Why even produce?</br></br>  <br>Waiting for Chibiki.</br>  <br>I don't like Rosenburg Angel, Ranko should be with Love Laika</br>  <br>Because I drive to carry on thanks to the healing of an idol's smile.</br>  Kaede best l@dy  Mayu needs more love.  <br>Can't wait what is the content of that scene?</br>  I know Mayu is all about the love, but does she put out?  <br> animeonlyfag <br> watch first two episodes <br> favorite girl is   p-san <br><br>Is this normal?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched this but that screenshot makes my dick react. It's like I've read so many doujin with this kind of face and framing that now I'm programmed to feel hot and bothered from it. The choker doesn't help, either. <br><br>Now I need to fap, probably to a Mayu doujin. Hopefully vanilla yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably, he's the only likeable character shown in the first 2 episodes as the other Project Girls are given like one 30 second line the entire episode.</br>  <br>very normal<br>he's the most popular<br> under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous </br></br></br>  <br>Did someone say Kaede? Can't wait :3</br>  <br>Its Kaede time?</br>  <br>   under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous <br><br>This triggers me more than anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki was pretty likeable.</br>    <br>Probably should have rephrased to "interesting", Uzuki is objectively among the most likeable in the main cast but she's really damn plain, but it's her schtick so I forgave her fluffy little head.</br>  Soon comrades.  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  <br><br>Can someone spoil me with Mayu's background story?  Are all the BDs out? </br></br>  <br>Broducer being a favourite is common.</br>  <br><br>Shes crazy.</br></br>  <br>I'm fed up with her Ganbarimasu</br>  <br>From doujins alone you can tell that. But I want to know what her tragic story is since apparently every single girl (and trap) in idolm@aster has had some serious shit happen to them.</br>  <br>This show ruined what it could have had.</br>  <br>You'll never live Ganbarimasu as much as she did.<br><br>That said, could've been great if we got cynical Uzuki at least.</br></br></br>  <br> cynical Uzuki <br>Don't talk about nonexistent things.</br></br>  <br>Not really. At most, The most tragic girl in im@s is Chihaya for her front and backstory. <br><br>Most of CG girls are pretty normal girls and it's the fans who have to make things up.<br><br>Mayu's backstory is just that one day she saw Psan during her modeling gig and fell in love. That's pretty much it.<br><br>If you want back stories and drama galore, SideM is chock full of them though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How old is Natsuki?  <br><br>So fluffy. Uzupaca the cutest.</br></br>  <br>Too old for Riina, nya</br>  <br>Chieri has quite a bit of stuff herself.<br><br>While not necessarily deadbeat, her parents are rarely there for her. More often than not, her parents are busy and are never at home.<br><br>Her fascination with Clovers? Its not an obsession with luck but rather, its because she had a very fond memory of her parents involving Clovers when she was a kid. Thus, Clovers help her feel at ease.<br><br>Because of this upbringing, Chieri easily gets lonely and has some serious abandonment anxiety issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like ganbarimasu Uzuki enough already but even just a few scenes of cynical Uzuki would have made a great gap.</br>      <br>I'll be there for you, Chieri.</br>  <br>cuck<br>u<br>c<br>k</br></br></br></br>    <br> not a single 17 years old idol </br>  <br>I want Natsuki to kabedon me.</br>  <br>Holy shit you're blind.</br>  <br>Nana please go</br>  <br>But you are blind indeed.</br>  <br>Rin is scary<br><br>But even so, I want to see more of it.</br></br></br>  The best idol.    <br>Best CG, even if she isn't one</br>  <br>I want to brutalize Natsuki.</br>  <br><br>I'm partial to Happy Happy as well.</br></br>  <br><br>She will always be by P's side</br></br>  <br>I already</br>  <br><br>That is not rock.</br></br>  We have the Stepmother<br><br>And the attic<br><br>Then what is the BIg Ball?<br><br>And who is the fairy Godmother</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just too cute.</br>  <br><br>Yes she is.</br></br>  <br><br><br>it breaks my heart, but I want to see Kirari cry.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't be mean.</br></br>  <br> How I interpreted this image. <br> She suffers of giantism. <br> She need to take medicines to maintain her heart alive. <br> But she is dieing. <br><br>Am I right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More like she's depressed because she feels like she can never get the P's love.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/675915/f00340<wbr>f582/<br>She just kept getting ignored by the P and has always felt unloved. I guess it she was trying a sleeping pill induced suicide.</br></wbr></br>  <br>All hail the Paka.<br><br>Chieri is pretty aight too.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10 would give her the  brush </br>  <br><br>Who wouldn't?</br></br>    <br>I came here to look at cute idols, not feel. <br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>    <br>Kaede is love Kaede is life</br>  <br><br>ONORE KANZAKI RANKO.</br></br>  <br> Ranko is 14 <br>What</br></br>  <br>Literal chuuni.<br><br>But in all honesty, I think I was surprised she was 14 when I first found that out, too.</br></br></br>  belated but happy birthday to this wonderful Sugar Cake  <br>Dumping a little something then.</br>    <br>I like you, Kirari  ;_; </br>        <br>End.</br>  <br><br>Why she don't do an liposuction?</br></br>  Dat feel when still waiting for UTW to finish up S1.

It had a cool musical theme but that was it.  <br>Never said it was canon. But it does officially exist.</br>  <br>If it's not canon, why would I really care?</br>  <br>It's as official as any fan art on Deviant art.</br>  <br><br>Well that's nice, I like seeing whatifs as long as they're just transformations. <br><br>This isn't Venom beating Superman tier, I actually want to see Nappa and Raditz done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You cared enough to post about it</br>  <br>Heroes does a lot of what if transformations</br>  <br> officially exist <br>You know, there 'officially exist' gay hentai doujins of Goku and Vegeta.</br></br>  <br><br>Cool, always happy to see a what could have been.</br></br>  <br>Video Games in Japan.</br>  <br>Not ones that are officially licensed by the companies and are endorsed as official products.<br><br>Heroes is about as canon as GT. Official products, but not canon.</br></br></br>  <br>If it isn't canon then it doesn't matter. No reason to feel any strong opinions on it.</br>  <br>Heroes is good about that, like giving us stuff that should have happened.</br>  SSJ3 is something only goku should do. Anyway its a pretty worthless unstable form  <br>Why did he use it against Beerus anyway?</br>  Not really relevant, but since this is basically a DB franchise thread, anyone have the gif where we see flashes of Goku going SSJG? I saw it once when I was on my phone  Didn't Akira help make which Heros and Xenoverse which got him interested in dragonball again in the first place?  <br>Anon, you're posting something from Dragon Ball Heroes. That shit is literally made to be video game fanfiction for little kids who play card games</br>  <br> Didn't Akira help make which Heros and Xenoverse  <br>Absolutely not<br><br> which got him interested in dragonball again in the first place? <br>What got him interested in Dragon Ball again in the first place was DB Evolution being shit and seeing the original script for Battle of Gods</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SSJ3 is something only goku should do. <br>But Gotenks....<br><br><br>Beerus wanted to see the mighty SS God but they didn't know what SS God was so Goku thought 3 was what he was looking for.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the peak of his power at the time. I wonder why he never tried to master ssj2 like he did ssj1</br>  <br>It's his strongest form?</br>  <br>Yea i forgot about him. Funny that everyone but vegeta can use ssj3</br>  <br> I wonder why he never tried to master ssj2 like he did ssj1 <br>He probably did while he was dead. That's may be how he was able to figure out SS3</br></br>   all these canonbabbies   <br>See this you can at least make the argument 'Trunks trained harder than ever before to ensure his world is safe cause he's the only one left.'<br>I mean he went back having the knowledge of SSJ2 and the ideology behind the 1 to 2 training, which he could probably then apply to 2 to 3.</br></br>  <br> Trying to make an argument for anything in Heroes being a real thing despite its literal advertising point being what ifs for merchandising </br>   Heroes doesn't do a 'What if Piccolo got his power unlocked by Old Kai, which is actually 3 in one because of himself, Kami and Nail to become Super Mystic Piccolo'   Has science gone too far?  <br>It is it's own canon. Just like the DBZ anime is it's own in comparison to the manga and so on.</br>  When did the Super Saiyan transformation lose its charm?  <br>Bardock in Heroes (and you'll see this story in Xenoverse 2 too, if it gets a sequel, since it sets that up) gets powered up by the Xenoverse villains and some mask thing. After that power up, in BASE, he's stronger than SSJ4 Goku. <br><br><br>Akira helped with the timeline/setting from Dragonball Online and Heroes recently has started using material from DB Online. Xenoverse also was based on it too. <br><br>This "Bardock is taken to the future and heavily powered up" story uses characters from DB Online, but the Bardock story itself is original.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan is so irrelevant that Bardock and his own version from Future Trunks timeline got SSJ3 before him</br>  <br>Goten and Kid Trunks</br>  <br>Why is seeing this so satisfying for some reason?</br>  <br>Around the point when they decided to start modifying it. Trunks and Vegeta having it was still kinda hype. Especially Vegeta since he was still in that tenuous "good guy/bad guy" stage</br>  <br><br>When everyone started using it despite the fact the form should've only been a one time thing only, over exposure and relying too much on it pretty much killed what makes it mystic and ancient.</br></br>  <br>Because Kid Gotenks is a shitty brat, and Teen/Adult Gotenks would probably not be *as* bratty.</br>  <br>SSJ3 would be a downgrade form Ultimate though. What Gohan needs is SSJGod, SSJSS or SSJ4.</br>  <br> and Teen/Adult Gotenks would probably not be *as* bratty. <br>That's not exactly true. Remember SS4 Gogeta?<br><br>He had the same problem as the kids. Seems like the Fusion Dance only takes your negative traits and maximizes it hard</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Gohan is weaker now, they could always give RoF/Super Gohan the SSJ3 form. Or Teen Gohan.</br>  <br> He had the same problem as the kids <br>He was only messing because he didn't realize SSJ4 turned 30 minutes into like 5. If he had known it would have taken that little amount of time he probably would have BBKX100 him right away</br></br>  <br> Since Gohan is weaker now <br><br>Except Super is retelling that story already, and we've got no idea if they'll keep that.</br></br></br>  <br>looks like Vegeta with highlights.</br>  <br>It's retelling the story but the events are clearly going to be the same. I mean, the party is on a cruise but the grounds look the exact same as the movie. The Bingo stage is there, the ship they use to follow the fight is there. Pilaf and co. are gonna show up soon, the way they get to Earth is different but Beerus and Whis still consult the Oracle Fish, etc. What they're doing is expanding on what's already there, not completely changing the story. <br><br>That's gonna probably include Gohan getting punched in the heart.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The base Super Saiyan form still has a classic feel to it. When they made it blue I got pissed off.</br></br>  <br><br><br> goten going ssj from being slapped by his mom <br> bardock going ssj, ever </br></br></br></br>  <br>I initially felt the same way but I think it looks better in animation.</br>    <br><br>Well, the manga shows that Champa will be around during the BoGs story itself, so something will likely change.<br><br>Anyway, aside from that, so far, they're also making the time between these events much shorter or more vague, and in the opening Gohan is shown using Ultimate. I can't see them suddenly doing a big timeskip afterwards just to match up with RoF.</br></br></br></br>      But could it beat SSJ9?  Heroes is gonna give her Super Saiyan, r-right?  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/uesqhy9kwcA  [ ]</br>  <br> This is probably from a game, which are non canon. <br><br>Toriyama said people should consider the mmo canon. Xenoverse and to a lesser extent Heroes are based on the mmo's story.<br><br>The events within them likely aren't canon to Super, but could easily just be another universe.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Heroes is its own canon. Based off of each of the PVs, the Heroes world is set within a game world that the characters get sucked into and become the avatars.<br><br>Of course, I may be alone here, but I think a Heroes anime would be kinda cool since it'd be a justifiable way to ignore power levels.</br></br></br>    <br> 10 hours <br>This thing would end before he even transformed</br></br>  <br> Toriyama said people should consider the mmo canon. <br>He never said that. People consider the MMO canon because Toriyama created its backstory setting and some of the present stories, but there has never been any statement about its status being on par with the manga's.</br></br>  <br>oh u</br>  <br> bzzzt </br>  <br>Comics, haha!</br>  I always liked SSJ3. It had a strange Asian mystical quality, especially since Goku discovered it in the afterlife.  <br>Personally I was surprised they didn't make a Heroes anime a long time ago considering how unfathomably popular it is in Japan. Felt like it would be the logical conclusion</br>  <br>I mean, its so easy too. Beat and Note as protagonists and team them up with different dragon ball characters against whatever they feel like, occasionally mixing in a new "what if" form.</br>  <br>The God Mission set seems to be the first one where they're doing an actual story arc, albeit two of them.</br>  How come a lot of the new forms from Dragon Ball Heroes never get into other games?  <br>SS1 Gogeta wasn't a complete fuck shit. Vegito and Gotenks were though. It seems like they take the personality of the stronger of the two. Trunks was a cocky little shit compared to playful Goten.</br>  <br>If Bardock really is supposed to be the legendary super sayain, he should really be able to enter all forms when you think about it.</br>  <br>You know, what happened to the original Super Saiyan God?</br>  <br> Dragon Ball Heroes having any effect on canon whatsoever <br> implying episode of bardock is canon <br><br>Bardock was some nobody who died, that's it</br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a Miia.

GINGERS HAVE NO SOUL</br>  <br>As was said in the last chapter,  Mero is a princess. She says that “It’s just a small country among many”, but nonetheless, her mother, the queen has ordered her home, saying there are threats against her. Cerea bends a knee and apologies for any and all rudeness to her majesty, saying she always knew she was royalty. Papi and Suu are both wrecked at the idea of her leaving, until Rachnee points out “It’s just a visit, right? She’ll come back soon.” They all decide to go to the hotel her mother is staying at, which looks like a castle. After narrowly avoiding being drowned (it’s a hotel for sea creatures, after all), they all go to the beach (swimsuit issue, even Suu gets a wet suit so she can play in the ocean, although her head soaks up water and makes her tits pop out.)  <br><br><br>Characters, but the cast gets some nice, polite photos.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tumblr: The post <br><br/></br></br>  <br>And the letter at the end?<br><br>Generic kidnapping letter?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off LRD, they show Papi butt fine</br>  I am really not into Ecchi, but Monster Musume got my attention as much as Date a Live (yet I still hasn't watch it)<br>So what do you reccomend me to do to get used to ecchi things?</br>  <br>IMHO Midnight drew best snek (artistic standpoint)</br>  <br>By the time I and my wife finish reading it and I can microwave/scan it, someone else will have beaten me.<br><br><br><br> As Mero is told she must return for good, Miia and Cerea get orgasmic massages from the Eel people, while Rachnee is fishing with her thread, wondering why she’s only getting rays. Suddenly, an army of crabs boil out of the ocean, swarming the kitchen and chewing up all the fish (right as all the customers come for dinner, since the beach is closed). The fish-headed chefs panic, and Darling comes to the rescue, salvaging what he can, and ordering Rachnee to catch all the arys she can (“It’s so rare of you to ask me for a favour…”, she says). Using the remaining fish and vegetables, as well as rays Rachnee catches, he manages to feed an entire hotel’s worth of super upscale customers. When they look for Mero, it’s discovered that she was kidnapped by “0” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I got into the genre with MGQ, so Monster Musume is tame to me.</br>  <br> So what do you reccomend me to do to get used to ecchi things? <br>I would recomend you to stop being a fag.</br></br>  <br>Let's hope Mero's in for a tentacling</br>  <br>Anyway, that's what I remember. I'm at work and can't check the comic to confirm.

The OP shows off a bit of the climactic battles of both Volume 3 and 4, however 13 episodes isn't really enough to do more than 2 volumes if they want to do the books justice. The problem is that book 3 is when the series starts to get really interesting. Thoughts, /a/nons?  <br>3, nothing makes sense otherwise. Author writes every 3rd novel as climax for reason.</br>  <br>4 episodes per volume with episode 13 being either the end of volume 3 or an epilogue? Seems kind of rushed.</br>  <br><br>It's going to end after the Shelltear fight, right when Bones decides to stomp the Lizards.</br></br>  <br>Welcome to the world of adaptations.</br>  <br>I also would say at the end of Volume 3.<br><br>I hope that we will also see the resurrection of Shalltear</br></br></br>  Stalker, are you here?<br>Can I request stitches for Death Knight and Gazef? Also, webm when Death Knight is rampaging too if possible.</br>  <br>You mean physical damage, I assume? how are you immune to melee combat? as long as you have joints, you can be grappled. As long as you have a body, you can be pushed down, pinned, trapped, or otherwise immobilized<br><br>Uhmm... I think slime maid would win. She is also immune to physical damage but you cant joint lock her or render her helpless through any of those means, I think?<br><br>Grapple/joint lock her and she will just "flow" or squish herself free, and since punches do no damage... yeah, slime maid wins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And ironically, they are going at a snail's pace</br>  <br>And they still cut out small scenes. Lemegeton's Demon, the simple Fireballs, Albedo considering stealing chair's bath, Ainz's experiments with the perimeter guards, eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, and few others I might have missed.</br>  <br>That's what I'm concerned about. I hope they don't cut anything too major.</br>  <br><br>This too .</br></br>  <br>yeah, just waking up, I totally meant physical damage. and Solution as much a slime as Albedo is still an Imp, or Ainz is still a skeleton mage.<br>Slime is just Solution's original race, I like to refer to her more advanced ones because Shoggoths and Ubbo-Sathla are way more badass than a simple slime.</br></br>  <br> eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, <br>they still got ordered this ep, just not introduced</br></br>  <br>so far I like the pacing, sure it's slow, but the novel is slow at this part, and going faster would seem rushed</br>  <br>I dont think they will be animated because animating something with 8 legs with sort of coordination its hard as fuck</br>  <br>I meant their new orders from Ainz during the funeral.</br>  <br><br>Plus they are invisible, it definitely won't be animated.</br></br>  I thought Overlord was just a fotm LN, then I beheld Lord Momonga's greatness and I was converted.  <br>Solution is the slime mage.</br>  <br>Yeah, at least the script writer learned for Papa Bones learned from Mahouka (he was junior in the script team there with aniplex) what NOT to do.<br><br>Mainly keep all the internal monologue/narration intact, lest the intended result turning out to be unintentional comedy.<br><br>Onii-sama wasn't called The Answering Machine for nothing during the 9SC arc where he only replied "There is a way", no matter what the problem was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op doesnt mean they will animate it all. They could end at vol 2. The anime was made for advertising the LN so just wetting the anime only viewers with op "trailers" is enough. And its working.

It seriously disturbs him being held up in such high regard, as well as the role he has a leader and fulfilling his obligation to everyone.<br><br>Not only that, but there is that corrossion of morality and humanity, where his innate lichness is overtaking his former human heart, where he starts scaling up the atrocities he commits, where he only does good acts because his sense of nostalgia of the good old days stirs.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon.</br>  <br> pacing is shit <br><br>I wish you ADD faggots that can't stand an anime that doesn't have a fight scene very week would stick to your garbage and leave the rest of us alone already</br></br></br>  <br>if it was stat simple in the New World 30+ wouldn't be legendary.<br>also she was a level 1 farmer(she's 16 in a medieval setting so she's probably been farming in excess of 7 years) until Ainz gave her the goblin horns, after which she gains 5 levels in a very show period of time</br></br>  <br>It's important for each instance of a general to have its own theme.</br>  <br>And that the MC keeps this false image by lies most of the time, while being huge paranoid and tries to plan his movements as meticuously as possible. And tries secures said worries with trusting his monster/demon servants to do their jobs and his own occasional meddling. If not, then just remove the witnesses.<br><br>All the while trying to act like Overlord and proper master (and later a father figure for real).</br></br></br>  Please tell me the next chapter of V5 won't focus on Climb. I'm really getting tired of this little shit. Literally anyone else would be more interesting, but I'd prefer more Ainz or the woman team.  <br>As someone with ADD is resent that. I have absolutely no issues following interesting Anime like Overlord.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure is about Sebas and his waifu</br>  <br>The rest of V5 and V6 will focus on Sebas and  Eight Fingers .</br>  I finally understood the whole chair thing. I don't know If I should laugh or feel sorry  <br>Well chapter cover image features Sebas so he will make his entry at least.</br>  <br>You should feel sorry for  Ainz. </br>  If you were Momonga and Albedo asked you to shit on her, would you?  <br>Yes I do feel sorry for him.</br>  <br>No, because I wouldn't have a digestive tract.</br>  How the strong is Touchme he just 1 hit 4 players in a sec that bullshit MMO right there  <br>Gagaran was fun at least.</br>  <br>no pvp level limits</br>  <br>You can still be able to smell, I would ask to sniff her asshole</br>  <br>Strongest player in the game.</br>  <br>They probably weren't very high level.<br><br>He already had the world tournament armor on so he was level capped and had some OP as fuck gear</br></br></br>  <br> general <br>That is the problem.</br></br>  <br>I love her, and most of the female team really.<br><br>A chuuni, a pair of twins, an old loli and a man in boob plate?

This skill is superior to the 10th Rank Magic, "Reality Slash". <br>he's a warrior that could break reality with his sword harder than a 10 rank spell</br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me is the winner of World Championship tournament. You can guess the rest.</br>  So, did Ainz revive those two other lizard men?  <br>Apparently he does in the web novel, but they aren't important enough to be focused on again in the regular novels so far.<br><br>Also there are some major turns from the web novel so that doesn't mean they come back.</br></br></br>  It could happen to you!  <br>The enemy players were talking about leveling. Touch Me was all specced out in end-game gear. Once you put in item level, maximum level characters get really ahead of lower level and new max level players in most MMOs.</br>  Anyone here know which volume Ainz  resurrects Clementine?   <br>Here.<br><br>Is that another loli?</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have her body, the Theocracy does. They have the proper resources for resurrection so maybe she'll be back.</br>  <br>Correction, someone has her body, but it isn't Ainz.</br>  Some spoilers from Vol.9 Chapter 2 and Intermission came out. <br> In the WN, Ainz has about 300 Death knights. In the Vol. 9 LN, he brings out 500 Death Knights. </br>  <br>She seemed to be a lunatic so I wonder who would even bother bringing her back.</br>  <br>spooky!</br>  <br>Thanks Stalker!</br>  <br>We already know that. It came out a while ago.</br>  Questions for those who can read moon.<br> Was there anyone else who actually put up a fight besides Shalltear? <br> Just how strong is Sebas? </br></br>  You know, I just realized that, with how different the WN and the LN are, we will never get to see the maids using 20 Death Knights to move around tables, chairs, and pour down tea,now.<br><br>This makes me a little sad.<br><br>I heard someone said that the rulers from both the empire and the kingdom go to nazarick when papa bones tries to set up a small nation, right? do they get treated to tea at the time?<br><br>I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea, it's that so wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her former employer or anyone who would want information she she has. Ainz would want to question her as well I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>She's a  vampire that is a few hundred years old. She fought with the 13 heroes. </br></br>  <br>   vampire that is a few hundred years old <br>That's wonderful, thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>It will never get animated anyway. No need to feel bad, just use your imagination.</br></br>  <br> I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea. <br> Not want to see the Plediaes pouring the tea. </br></br>  <br>Now that we're getting into the political intrigue the show has some potential, but Momonga's vassals arguing about whose pussy got wetter was getting old.</br>  <br>to fight Ainz? all lvl 100 NPC can<br>that include all the floor guardians, the treasure keeper, sebas and they said there's that dragon god in a foreign country<br><br>sebas is a 100 lvl dragon disguised as human just need to give him some gears</br></br></br></br>  <br>No I meant in the other volumes. Did someone else fight him that managed to make him put some effort. Also holy shit Sebas is cool.</br>  <br>No, Shalltear's rebellion was unique.</br>  KOTAE WA<br>DOKO<br>EIEIEIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>SAGASHITE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEIEIEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone stole his Ainz-approved human waifu, so he needed to put down some niggas.<br><br>Also Climb wanted him to train him after they meet in a cave.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, so he curbstomps everything? <br><br><br> so he needed to put down some niggas <br>This will never be animated. Please tell me it isn't so</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone make a version of this but with Papa Bones?</br>  <br>If you believe in the chinks and Papa Bones hard enough, your dream may come true.</br>  <br><br>Here's another one for reference, and Albedo can even be edited in this as well.</br></br>  <br>I actually meant of the He-Man thing but you've opened my eyes to a whole new level of spook.</br>  <br>Well they're only invisible to those that fail the roll to spot them.</br>  <br>He doesn't get a chance to treat a worthwhile opponent until  much later on, stuff that author has only hinted at for now . But now that he came out open and formed  the independent nation of Nazarick by stealing the lands from Kingdom basically,  he might get some "guests", either directly or those that are  sent by the scheming Platinum Dragon Lord .</br>  <br> Who is the Platinum Dragon Lord? An original Yggdrasil player or something? Did he have something to do with the World class item that was able to take control of Shalltear? </br>  <br>I understand the concept of Once Bitten Twice Shy but shouldn't the  Platinum Dragon be confirming that the alien Player Characters are evil before getting rid of them?   He seems more butthurt to me about the fact that the  Six Gods rendered his magic less useful than any desire to protect the New World from these invaders. </br>  <br>Yeah, it strikes as odd choice to be automatically assblasted about everything new.  Who knows, maybe he will come around as better guy if he ever sits down with Papa Bones for a tea .</br>  <br>We can only hope. The author's pretty good at subverting our expectations so it should be possible for an alliance over there, considering the possibility that Ainz  is probably going to create a kingdom for non human races. </br>  <br>Dragons in these sorts of fantasy settings tend to be dicks. Very selfish lot.</br>  So let's say his entire guild said "Fuck it I'm waiting for the servers to shut down" and stayed. How fucked would the entire world be?  <br>As the name implies,  he is unique named Dragon Lord . And he has a  guild weapon sticking on his back  and he has his "hand" in scheming  against the players ever since Six Great Gods .</br>  <br>There's no guarantee anyone else would have been transported anyway</br>  <br> There's no guarantee anyone else would have been transported anyway <br>The players got teleported away from each other?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>Except for the part where they actually are in a real fantasy world.</br>  <br>It's pretty much shocking me how much people are missing this even though it's been spelled out numerous numerous times. <br><br>Like, could you fucking pay attention to the episode you're watching before spewing a bunch of retarded words?</br></br></br>  <br>There are already kingdoms with  non-human races, and it is stated in the recent chapter by Ivileye that they get more common the farther away you get from the Theocracy. <br><br>The Theocracy may be dicks,  but they're no different from non-human nations that use humans as slave labor; there are also places where humans are seen as a literal food source. <br><br>The residents of Nazarick may be sinister and insidious, but they treat everyone not of Nazarick about as evenly (as in tools to use.)</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>They are in a actual fantasy world though.</br>  <br>At least you maybe, just slightly, can trust them. Unlike AI's in cyberpunk settings.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>The anime cuts out the part where he freaks out when he finds out that the world he's in has absolutely nothing to do with his old MMO world, which is supposedly heavily based on Norse themes. There's nothing remotely Norse about the New World he and Nazarick got sent in.</br>  <br>Shocking truth: some people post in those threads just to shitpost, not even watching the shows.</br>  <br>You could always trust Shodan to be a cunt and the AIs in Marathon were okay dudes for a relative value of "okay".</br>  <br>Is this the girl from Volume 4 ch2 intermission?</br>  <br>Dropped at first episode</br>  <br>No. Mage for the adamantium adventurer team Blue Rose. Ivileye.</br>  <br>What are you even doing here then?</br>  <br>He wants to be converted and bask in the glory of Ainz obviously.

If so that's Pandora's Actor.</br>  <br>   nation of Nazarick <br>not the land of Ainz Oal Gown? wtf</br></br>  <br>It's the  Nazi. </br>  <br> wtf <br/></br>  <br>Ainz has never had that much of a ego. He only acts like a supreme overlord, because he thinks his subordinates want him to behave as such. He has always cared about Nazarick as a whole, the guild is important,  but no one can join Ainz Ool Gown (the organization) without majority approval from members. </br>  <br><br>Oh you are right this guy. Seems cool but he hasnt been in the anime yet. He looks like a Haniwa in a suit  good taste Ainz </br></br>  <br> He looks like a Haniwa in a suit <br>that's how Doppelgangers look naturally, Narbel would also looks like that if she dropped her Maid form.</br></br>  <br>He will appear at least before the end.<br><br>And we will get to see his zany poses embarrassing the fuck out of Ainz.<br><br><br>Well most of them would probably be immortal like Ainz. Touch Me was a dragon kin like Sebas wasn't he? If Touch Me appeared in the world he would have probably become some kind of god emperor and thrown Ainz a welcoming party after 5000 years of waiting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>But, they're in real fantasy world, though?</br>  <br>Now i get that Ainz is just Nazi scrambled</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>or you could have paid attention on hoe he remarks how his turning into a lich not just physically but mentally too.</br>  <br> still be alive <br><br>I think only 1-2 of the 13 heroes were actually from YGGDRASIL.

There was nothing Norse about it other than the same reuse of Norse names that we see elsewhere in SAO and Elder Tales.</br>  <br>Local vampire.She sold her soul for power to fight alongside the 13 heroes.</br>  <br><br>Also, her real name is  Landfall .</br></br>  <br>Well it did have the 9 realms/worlds of norse mythology but that was about as far as it got with it.</br>  <br>It had a bunch of different worlds, Norse worlds, in its lore if I recall correctly.</br>  <br>Not known but the talk of her rest of team paints her to be vastly above them so she should at least be an even match against Pleiades (disregarding hard counters like her anti-bug spell for Entoma).</br>  <br>Im guessing they would have ended killing each other like another certain group before them</br>  <br>Pretty sure these are the same people complaining about the "slow" pacing.</br>  <br>not really, im a fan of the LN and still think the anime is "running late". I dont think its slow, I just think each episode is too short by 3 minutes so they are accumulating a "time debt" that will have to be filled by the last episode in its entirety</br>  <br> At the beginning, Ainz constantly imagined that this world was based on the lore of YGGDRASIL. Since you could use YGGDRASIL magic in this world, perhaps it was somewhat related to YGGDRASIL. However, the names he heard had absolutely no relation to it. <br> The neighboring countries were the Kingdom of Re-Estize, the Baharuth Empire and the Silian Theocracy. In the Nordic mythology and lore of YGGDRASIL, these names didn’t appear. <br>The LN hinted that Yggdrasil was pretty Norse-ly.</br></br></br>  <br>The world would be fucking screwed.<br><br>We don't the relationship between the previous heroes but lets assume that they were all friends from the same guild AT BEST and human or demihuman (I'm sure they could also hide if they were a blob or skelly but non human/demihuman was uncommon and prone to PKing). At some point many managed to get turned against each other despite being apparently "human" enough. With that in mind those were still comparatively small amounts of players at once too.<br><br>Okay every Ainz Ooal Gown member shows up. That's 41 godly strong players with three of them being even more godly than the rest to the point where I do not think I can even imagine what Touch Me could do to the world. <br><br>Now Ainz (our Ainz not the guild) was clearly the most NEET of all and love his guildmates dearly to the point where even after becoming a rattle me bones he still wants nothing more than to be with him friends. However we know nothing of how the rest of the guild really felt. Were they true friends and would they stick together after coming to the new world? Did everyone besides Momonga treat the game as just a game and coming to the new world would they just fuck off and do their own thing? We only know how people acted in the game and an MMO is way different than real life. Maybe Teapot would immediately freak the fuck out and kill themself, maybe Touch Me was actually a horrible person and just used the game as a means of RPing someone else and upon actually being in control goes off as a giant anti paladin, or maybe half the guild secretly hated the other half and bam civil war with beings who can destroy entire armies with the flick of their wrist. <br><br>There's also the fact that turning into your race effects you mentally. Ainz got off "easy" in that his change just meant he can think more level headed and a lack of empathy. What the fuck does turning into a dragon man or a vampire or a slime or a weird Cthulhu head do?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh yeah, for those wondering in the earlier threads about "how the fuck would something like DnD's Time Stop work in New World?", you're in for a treat on the last tracks of 1st drama cd.<br><br>Ainz uses it. More than once.</br></br>  <br>Is the drama CD being translated?<br><br>I remember seeing something referenced in the Lizardman book that happened in the drama and I could always use more Ainz in my life.</br></br></br>  <br>1st one is fully done, last 2 tracks were finished earlier. No idea about 2nd.<br><br>Grab the 1st cd from either imoutoliciouslnt blog or from the mega folder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yet he treasures him because he can see his friends through him.</br></br>  <br> Now, to answer the big question you have in your minds in regards to the second volume... <br> You will have to wait until 1) Kuro gets around it, 2) We get a new TL, 3) Other group picks it up. <br> From this point on, Four Lovers will be the priority for Kurono Smith. <br><br>So we'll probably have to wait a few months unless someone else picks it up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They would die of old age unless they were demihumans (elves) or non-humans.</br>  <br>He brought out like 5000 undead with magical armor and shields and weapons against the lizards. 300 or 500 death knights. No problem.</br>  <br>Well, that was one of the rules to join the guild....</br>  <br> What the fuck does turning into a dragon man <br><br>Libido x 1000<br>Love of Gold x 1000</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not every non-human is immortal, though.</br>  <br> Love of Gold x 1000 <br>is there a scaly merchant.png?</br></br>  <br>Most heteromorphic races on the other hand either seem to be either extremely long lived or outright immortal though.<br> Skellingtons <br> Vampires <br> Demons (including Imps, Succubi etc.) <br> Slimes <br> Eldritch Abominations <br> Dragons/Dragonkin </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slimes <br>I have never seen a single piece of fiction that described a slimes natural lifespan.</br></br>  <br>I got you covered.</br>   13.　*6,118　*46,846　Overlord Vol.1 <br> 18.　*4,862　*38,076　Overlord Vol.2 <br> 22.　*4,122　*34,935　Overlord Vol.3 <br> 25.　*3,441　*32,816　Overlord Vol.9 <br><br>PRAISE MADHOUSE<br>PRAISE PAPA BONES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I seem to remember a /tg/ thread about that topic.</br>  <br>Do you have a skellington merchant as well?</br>  <br>I'll double check.</br>  <br>This is a common misconception. Dragons dont love gold, they love the fact that gold basically works like chocolate. Its delicious, and an aphrodisiac, so its more like "must have gold to get laid" when visiting a love interest.<br><br>Thus, its more like Libido x 1000000. Gold just happens to be included inside that</br></br></br>  <br>Closest thing I have is pic related, sorry.</br>  <br>He made the head maid Yuri Alpha and Pandora's actor.</br>  <br>This right here is what will get us a second season if anything will</br>  <br>Yuri isn't the head maid and he didn't make her*</br>  <br>Impressive.<br><br>Though I wonder how much better it would have done if Madhouse didn't have to resort to CG.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're right.</br>  i must be the only person on /a/ to not be head over heels with overlord<br><br>It's really, boring and uninspired to me.</br></br>  <br>Jesus</br>  <br>I actually liked the death knight</br>  <br>Did you read the novel?</br>  <br>She's more like the second in command, or fourth if you count Sebas and the penguin.<br><br>But yeah, the only ones we know Ainz made are Pandora Actor and that throwaway Lich (though probably through necromancy instead of the game systems)</br></br></br>  <br>Well, we all have different tastes, I guess.</br>  All praise the user who created Albedo<br><br>This guy knows how to create good semen demons</br></br>  <br> Edition <br>that's really annoying tbh</br></br>  <br>Tell me your not this faggot<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/Ycv2bauLJh8  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>So is this essentially Low Fantasy meets High Fantasy? I do like it when anime has more low fantasy themes.</br>  <br>So is Albedo's youngest sister the miko?<br><br>I remember her mentioning it when talking to her other sister,the faceless horror one. Also I'm really looking forward to seeing the flashback of Tabula's creation scarring Ainz and all his friends shitless.</br></br></br>  <br> So is this essentially Low Fantasy meets High Fantasy? <br><br> It's high fantasy meets high fantasy </br></br></br>  Who made Victim?  <br>I admit, I felt a little bad for Khajit. I blame it on the author for slipping in the backstory of the characters  he kills off.   Never forget, Arche ;_; </br>  <br>  More like High Fantasy meets Higher Fantasy. </br>  So is Albedo bad because I heard that in volume 7 she trying to kill the 41 guild members except for ainz  <br>She is a yandere</br>  <br>Remember that the author's readers chose to kill her off. He had a poll.</br>  <br>Well fuck, I was hoping it wouldn't come to that.</br>  <br>Her creator with their huge setting obsession wrote her like that, but because Ainz changed that last line she still wants to kill but not Ainz.. At least that's what anon told me.</br>  <br>Where that spoiler coming from?</br>  <br>It's not like her Fate Worse Than Death alternative was any better. The readers actually did good the way they voted.</br>  <br>Ainz and co. are capable of magic and skill three times beyond the highest levels of the new worlders, and that doesn't even include Ainz's treasury and his 13 game breaking World-class items.</br>  <br>Implying you dont want to become Shalltear sex slave</br>  <br>What is this from?</br>  <br>Pretty sure the poll options were tragic end or not.</br>  <br>I really don't. She's a sadist.</br>  <br>The Guild would split, remember Touch Me hand over the Leader position to Momonga over some sort of discussion with Ulbert? Nonetheless what Momonga thought of it, it remarks a division on them</br>  <br>Faggot.<br><br> Her suffering ended with the best possible end for her. </br></br></br>  <br> In the web novel, she became Shalltear's sex toy while in the light novel she died in absolute despair in Shalltear's hands. <br> Her dead body was cut into pieces: Entoma uses Arche's voice to replace her old voice, Demiurge takes her skin, several undead take her arms and legs, her head is used as decoration for the devils and the leftovers become food. <br> In the web novel, she teaches Ainz how to dance. <br>At least her jive will live on in Papa Bones during Nazaricks raves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the WN, she ends up as Shalltear's sextoy. In the LN, the author had a vote on whether to keep it the same or tragic end.</br>  <br>How exactly, does she want to kill them?<br>Didn't they Quit even before Ainz was transported where he is now?<br>Or does she want to eradicate, that they ever existed?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Man, Ainz must have been mad at fuck. I blame the girl's faggot teammate for how things ended up. Is he the one who was unfortunate enough to meet the Lord of Terror?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was probably something added in her gigantic description written by Tabula, like how the penguin was designed to want to overthrow Ainz.<br><br>Tabula had weird tastes like that and Ainz didn't read it all because it was like a fucking book in length.</br></br></br>  <br>Well no, I know that. I was just hoping that the world they got into wasn't high fantasy, since from what we've seen in the show so far it looks fairly low fantasy.</br>  <br> In the web novel, Albedo does not exist. <br>Clearly added for waifufags.<br>WN is superior, shalltear wins by default</br></br></br>  Anyone got episode names past 5?<br><br>I'm wondering where you guys got the first five names in the first place.</br></br>  <br>I don't know how you got that impression after the first episode with all the demi-humans. Anyways, next episode there's going to be an angel spammer.</br>  <br>In the WN, Shalltear has most of the scenes associated with Albedo.</br>  <br>To be fair though, he's using an item that mimics stuff from the game.<br><br>And most of the setting beyond the Blue Rose girls and some other powerful people is pretty low fantasy.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean the world they arrived in, not Ainz and his posse.

That was his fault too.</br>  <br> implying that was the same person <br><br>Also,<br> everyone has to fit in and conform to what I think is normal <br><br>The diagnosis is autism</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who was the girl at the beginning of volume three?  <br> Solution, the gelatin girl. </br>  <br><br> Pretty sure these are the same people complaining about the "slow" pacing. <br><br>No, I understand how the fantasy setting works, it's still really slow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. The one Zack meets in the alleyways is who I mean .</br>  <br><br>It was probably like this when the first YGGDRASIL people showed up, but not by the time the story takes place.</br></br>  Man, if you think episode three was gruesome, wait till well get to the third volume  <br><br>She's plotting contingencies for if any others arrive</br></br>   mfw this author is making feel bad about dying lizards and hydras.   <br>Pity the 7th or 9th volume won't ever be animated.<br><br>By the way, has anyone else come across this one anon going around all butthurt at the series because Ainz ended up killing  Iguvaruji and his group when they got in the way of him taking Shalltear down?  <br><br>I bring it up because I was wondering if there were other people like that found Ainz's actions "unnecessary".</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 4 preview when.  <br>Friday?</br>  when is this cartoon getting  interesting?   <br><br>Usually around Friday 5am EST.</br></br>  <br>You should probably drop it now if it isn't already interesting you in some way.</br>  <br>im only two episodes in because literally NOTHING happened so far, is it worth while to sink my time into this?</br>  <br><br>3 ep rule dood.<br>Watch the third ep.</br></br></br>  <br>Rororo is fine, he got buffs and mare even remarks the hydra is cute near the end of the volume.<br><br>I got the sense reading the LN that its part of the point. Ainz is really evil, but he's not unnecessarily evil. I think his reasoning for killing that bunch was rather weak but I don't know what else he was going to do at that point to prove his victory when his tailers were lost or asleep during the fight. Like he said, at the point in the talk in the adventurers guild he already decided to kill them when they said they wanted to come with. He did warn them, so I think it fair given what happens later with the lizardmen.<br> h-holy shit you just displayed god like powers and killed the entire environment and used your army decked out in equipment rivaling legends as a staircase to a boulder that your magic giant threw and then you even used magic to make us bow we surr- <br> Surrender? Nope. Four Hours. Coyctus. Your Ass. His Lance. <br> o-okay </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think this is the first time where someone grabs the sword from the opposite side. Such awesomeness. Plus she's a loli vampire that stuffs her bra and has Gauna like armor. So kawaii.</br>  <br>alright, i'll do that</br>  Manga updates, never.  <br>Once a month, end of the month like always</br>  <br>Could he have mindwiped them like he did Enri and Nemu?<br>Speaking of mindwipe, can he plant fake memories in place of the ones he took? If he could then maybe, just maybe, he could have mindwiped those adventurers and planted fake shit.<br>If he can't, then honestly, he had no other option and his reasoning wouldn't be weak at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I know it's not a Nazarick member. The only people from Blue Rose it could be are Tia and Tina. I can't think of any other decently leveled female adventurers.</br>  I am so glad that the first two episodes act as a filter for secondaries who don't have the patience to see a story develop into something great.  <br>Indeed. Though by now, word of the third episode has made them go and see what the fuss is about. If they drop it now, I hope it sticks this time around.</br>  <br>That's Clementine. You remember the beginning of Vol 3 happens a bit before shit goes down in Vol 2. If you paid attention to the text you would recognize it's her because not only her attitude but because she had a lot of metal sounds clanging which is actually her adventurer plates. <br><br>But no worries I didn't get it the first time either.</br></br></br>  13.　*6,118　*46,846　Overlord Vol.1<br><br>18.　*4,862　*38,076　Overlord Vol.2<br><br>22.　*4,122　*34,935　Overlord Vol.3<br><br>25.　*3,441　*32,816　Overlord Vol.9<br><br>All hail Papa Bones!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one who I can think of would be cat girl from volume two. She's the only one I know who talks like this~.</br>  <br>Dr. Death Knight's stabbing loving getting all the follows. <br> This makes me hopefully that they'll animate Ainz squeezing Clementine's organs out of her mouth. </br></br>  <br>I must be too used to seeing the numbers of Mahouka and SAO but what's so impressive about this?</br>  <br>Vol 3 was when I realized Mr Bones was actually really evil and not just acting the part. If he was a moralfag he'd probably jump some loops with memory shit and avoid killing the guys.</br>  So when are the OP + ED released?  <br>He's time efficient. Those adventurers were too insistent and he was going full out paranoid by then.</br>  So I get that any players that were in the game were thrown into various times, but has there been any hints that there is a player existing in Ainz's time? He needs someone that can actually counter his power level  <br>Yeah it was very efficient, doesn't make it any less evil.</br>  <br>aug 28</br>  <br>Narberal.</br>  <br> Could he have mindwiped them like he did Enri and Nemu? <br>And deplete his MP pool before the fight with his natural enemy?<br>Mind wipes are expensive.</br></br></br>  <br>You're also evil when you kill bugs in your house then.</br>  <br> He needs someone that can actually counter his power level <br>Why? Are you one of those fags who always want their MCs to be "challenged"?<br>Because it's stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  <br>That vol 1-3 actually has ranked 3 years after it came out.</br>  <br>We're just glad that the anime is actually doing the LN sales some good.<br><br>Volume 1 sales boosted by ~30% since the anime aired.</br></br></br>  <br>Now if only we could get them localized</br>  <br>Seriously, most of the girls of Nazarick would eat you all the moment you tried to touch them and the rest would just kill you.</br>  <br>Papa Bones is both rational and efficient. I don't get why people think the actions he took then were unnecessary. Like you said, mind wiping would have been more trouble than it was worth.</br>  How many episodes is this supposed to have? 14?  <br>Because it'd be interesting, obviously.</br>  <br><br>Got it. Good news then.</br></br>  <br>Mindwipes take up a large amount of mana for the amount of time you get to wipe. Also what would he wipe from their memories? The guild and the adventurers already knew they were going to fight together and what the opponent was.</br>  <br>After vol 5-9 get translated. I dont want to wait 2-3 years to catch up legally.</br>  Have to say the Zaryusu vs. lich fight has got to be the most shounen thing I've read in this series thus far.  <br>That must have worked amazingly when you teacher failed you.</br>  <br>It's interesting as it is now with us slowly finding out about the past players and the dragons. And if and when the author decides to introduce someone strong enough to "challenge" Papa Bones, we'll find it interesting then too. For now, I don't think there's any reason to focus so much on whether or not there's someone who can push his shit in.</br>  <br>I didn't ask for this immediately, I asked if such a thing exists because I haven't read the LN<br><br><br>cool your tits</br></br></br></br>  I don't understand why people are so intent on having players challenge him so early.<br><br>In fact, I find the whole  players being transported to different points in time and affecting the history of the world  way more interesting.</br></br>  <br>My bad, it's just that every single thread, that question appears.</br>  <br>huh, it actually was interesting, thanks anon</br>  <br>Plus the dickass  Platinum Dragon Lord  takes the story in a lot of different routes.</br>  <br>Nice catch, she wears a black cloak, has purple/violet eyes, talks like so~, has a decent level, and she's probably headed towards the  cemetery.  She fits the bill perfectly.</br>  <br> Red eyes in OP <br><br>Why madhouse.</br></br></br>  <br>So this implies that volume 2 and the beginning of three are happening at the same time. Makes sense now that I think about it.</br>  I'm going to marry Shalltear!  <br>13</br>  Does/did Gazef Strogonoff die? I happened to check the Overlord wiki which stated he died in the LN, but lived in the WN, and its been long enough that I don't remember what happened in SkyTheWood's translation.  <br>You missed it when the guild leader flat out said the Vampire incident happened a day before the cemetery incident?</br>  <br>Hope you're willing to be 5th wheel after Ainz, vampire brides, and all the other undead.</br>  <br>He's alive in the translated chapters. Maybe he dies later.</br>  <br> Yes, he dies at the end of volume 9 covering the Kingdom troops as they retreated from Ainz's massacre. Out of respect for Gazef, Ainz lets them retreat. Raeven ends up living though he dies in the WN whilst Gazef dies in the LN though he lives in the WN. </br>  <br>I'm rereading everything now and just remembering things</br>  <br>Thank you kindly anon <br><br>Annoying how we have to wait a whole month though</br></br></br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>Sebas, if he drops the bullshit, can fight equally with Shalltear going all out.</br>  Is the Funi rip okay or should I wait for ayy?  <br><br><br> Shonen battle where the villain has the plot shield </br></br></br>    Ainz returned to his room and leaped onto his bed. After a lengthy hang time, Ainz’ body fell into the bed, then — he began to roll around. <br>  Rolled right, then rolled left. <br>  He was only able to roll as such because the bed was large enough. <br>How can a lich be so moe?</br></br></br>  <br>Because on the inside, he's still a faggot salaryman who relies on crutches like his lich emotion suppressors.</br>    <br>he can smell albedo cunt on his bed</br>  <br>Reminder that the bed was "marked."</br>    <br><br><br>I do this shit all the time. Am I autistic?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a skeleton?</br>  <br>N-no.</br>  <br>I don't want to rape. I want to cuddle  Retard maid. </br>  <br>How the fuck is she retard. Dont talk shit about my waifu</br>  I'm going to marry Solution!    The beginning is kind of bittersweet, it reminds me of how I felt being a holdout in old defunct MMOs and one of the last people in several guilds when I still played them a decade ago.<br><br>Watching a game you spent countless hours of enjoyment in dying around you isn't fun.</br></br>  So when Albedo had bitch in her bio what did that really mean. Is it the usage that means turbo slut or one that is the abrasive personality kind.  <br>She wants to fug.</br>  <br>She's an incompetent idiot who can't do anything right and needs to be constantly bullied.<br><br>She's a moe retard.</br></br></br>  <br>but retard moe is best moe</br>  <br>Anon, I really hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but we're all skeletons. Some of us just wear the guise of flesh.<br><br>There's a skeleton lurking inside you right now.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll jump your  bones </br>  <br>It's kind of bad when your race specializes in blending in with people and being covert but you can't even pull that off right even with supervision form your god.</br>  <br> supervision form <br> calling Narberal retarded <br>ayyy lmao</br></br></br>  Finally. Someone finally drew some lewd Albedo and Ainz.  <br>l-link?</br>  <br> smal typo <br> hurr durr u r a retard <br> Really?</br></br></br>  <br>I can't do that, think of the innocent children. I don't want to corrupt there fragile minds but I'm going to do it anyways http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51560228</wbr> </br>  <br>That's right shitposter-kun</br>  <br>Wow.<br><br>Just wow.</br></br></br>  <br>eh.</br>    <br>He looks spookier than usual.</br>  <br>I said it was the first, not the best.</br>    <br> CZ </br>  <br>at least shes loyal not like the other hoes</br>  <br>well, first if you don't count Ainz messaging Mares prostate.</br>  <br>EVERYONE IS LOYAL.<br><br>LITERALLY ALL OF THEM ARE WILLING TO KILL THEMSELVES IF AINZ TELLS THEM TO.<br><br>A FEW WOULD KILL THEMSELVES JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE MACARONI PAINTING THAT THEY MADE OF HIM.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A FEW WOULD KILL THEMSELVES JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE MACARONI PAINTING THAT THEY MADE OF HIM. <br>Can we please petition a drawfag to make the guardians showing there macaroni art to Ainz?</br></br>  manga update fucking when<br>I NEED to see the hugging scene<br>I need to see best girl explode for also being worst girl</br></br>  <br>I don't get why she has ears in these pics. She didn't have them in the novel right?</br>  <br> manga update fucking when <br>what part of monthly aren't you guys getting?</br></br>  <br> Shalltear tried to kill Ainz <br> Albedo plotting to kill all 41 guild members <br><br>Sure your hoes are loyal</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, but she is the only one who would put Ainz above her creator.</br>  <br>because So-bin wanted to put cat ears on her. And we don't question So-bin.</br>  <br>That's awesome, but it's not canon right? It'd be kind of weird for the Theocracy to have a cat girl when they preach human supremacy. <br><br>Then again CD seems to be an elf. Or maybe a cat girl as well?</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo is just following the programming that her creator gave her, 100% loyal.</br>  <br> guys <br>I ask once or twice every thread <br> in the hopes that /ak/ will hurry up and give me the hug i need <br> also i wanted to post semi lewd images of psychogirl </br></br></br></br>  <br>no it's not canon. Just something So-bin wanted to do .</br>  <br>might as well let you all know. The manga chapters come out in some magazine monthly. Also the first manga book is being sold now.</br>  Who are the guys on the far right at the end of the opening?  <br>I hope he adds animal ears on more characters in the future then.</br>  <br>Who knows what kind of kinky shit the corpse looters have gotten up to? They might have added some bits before bringing her back.</br>  <br>these guys?</br>  <br>We can only hope for that, and maybe for Clementine to gain a new fetish or something. Ainz being basically a normalfag but stuck in a spooky skeleton body while bitches keep coming his way is one of the best aspects of the story.</br>  <br>neat</br>  <br>these guys</br>  <br>aura's pets</br>  <br>Too many in-human features for them to be BS, EF/SA and the numbers dont match either. 13 Heroes (you can see 12 + Ainz on the middle)?</br>  <br>Aura's favorite pets</br>  <br>when did he sit on her? before or after her rebellion?</br>  <br>Ah. Auras pets.</br>  <br>If we assume upper right is Ivileye way back then, and top middle left is what's his face former blue rose guy, then it's the 13 heroes minus the 2 players.<br><br>Pure speculation of course with zero credibility. But that's the closest to a guess I can make.<br><br>Otherwise it's either random shitters that don't matter and were made for the anime, or a bunch of workers from vol 7 that didn't get any pictures, or well whatever else you wanna imagine.</br></br></br></br></br>  .  <br> Hi reddit <br>Hi Tumblr</br></br>  <br> Hi Tumblr <br>Hi MAL</br></br>  Dude anime lmao  <br>Go back to your shitty jojo or fate thread if you don't like it so much.</br>  The chaika murdering threads were more fun.<br>It was live and someone in Scotland could have prevented it.</br>  Was this the shitiest writing in the entire One Piece bibliography?  first for robin  <br>How the fight against Diamante turned out.</br>  <br><br>But he had spiky balls. Who wouldn't that one shot</br></br>  <br>Its definitely in the top 10</br>  <br>go read it and find out?</br>  I will never understand cunts like you, OP.  <br> oda cocksucker <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. Therefore, we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite their respective strengths in order to avenge the mother of their family. However, such thing didn't happen. Instead of making a 2 v 1 fight, who would have been legitimate considering that Diamante has a DF power whereas Kyros is weakened since he has only one leg and that Rebecca is already tired from fighting, Oda chose to make Kyros fight Diamante on his own. Why? For a propaganda reason, I dare say. Oda is from a country with a patriarchical and misogynist culture and he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga as a medium since there are ten of millions of people reading One Piece. It's shameful of him. He tries to make people think subconsciously that men should do the fight while women stay back, it's something that should be obvious to even the average reader. However, since many readers are young, they don't realize that and actually believe Oda is right without wondering whether he really is or not, and thus, Oda has achieved his misogynist objective. It's very sad considering that this is coming from the same author who fought racism with the FIshman Island arc.</br>  <br>No, not that. Just the way you start the thread with bait. For what purpose ? None. Simply for shitposting.</br>  <br>No, I meant that this fight had the worst writing ever. Not that I didn't know what happened with this fight. However I wouldn't even have mentionned it.<br><br><br>He had spiky balls, threw them in the air, they fell on Kyros, and he stood up as if he was perfectly fine. Isn't that strange?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just the way you start the thread with bait. <br> calling shit out is bait <br>are you mentally challenged?</br></br></br>  What happens when Law cuts Buggy inside his room?  <br>Kuina.</br>  <br>Perhaps he is just giving his opinion and want people to discuss it with him. If you don't agree with him, then speak, tell him your opinion. You don't have to be afraid. 4chan is a place where people disagree all the time and no one will criticize you just because you think a chapter had better writing then someone else believes. Why do you think OP used a question mark? It's because he wanted to discuss with you.<br><br><br>He was mistaken, let him regret it.<br>As for your opinion about this chapter, I also think it was quite forced. It wasn't horrible, though, but Oda could have made it much more natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you can fuck off and not buy his manga then though I doubt you do anyway.</br>  <br> Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. <br><br>almost hurt myself trying to process that for a second</br></br></br>  What are the lengths and girths of the male characters?  <br>When Law cuts Buggy inside his room, Buggy is cut and there is no damage.<br><br><br>You shouldn't tell people to "fuck off" just because you disagree. Talk with me and we will discuss what you disagree about.<br>I'll keep buying One Piece because I like it.<br><br><br>I meant mother, sorry. I wrote too quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You think it's shit writing. That's your opinion. No need to bait people in to an argument. Obviously there are going to be 10s of people defending this, just like every other thread this discussion came up. "Calling out shit" as you say it serves no real purpose other create a 100 shitposts.</br>  <br>So if that's the case, what other variations of 2 and 9 are there to go through?</br>  <br> That's your opinion. <br> pls don't post your opinion of 4chinks k thx <br>Hang yourself you newfagging cancer</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know since Oda never made that official.<br>You shouldn't talk about this kind of pointless thing anyway. <br><br><br>He didn't bait. He gave his opinion and I agree with him to some extent. Don't call something bait just because you don't like it. It's very disrespectful of you. This Sabo chapter was a little forced. Tell me why you don't think so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand your anger, but you're going too far with these insults. I agree with you about Sabo. What do you think about Sabo's entire character?</br>  <br><br>Alright, I think your opinion is shit and you should kill yourself. There is literally no shit story writing in One Piece at all. Not even Rebecca.</br></br>  Everything Sabo story related is cheap and shit  <br>see? Write your shittaste from now on right away instead of being such a dramaqueen all the time you little bitch.</br>  what would have been a reasonable explanation for sabo to not show up for over 10 years?  <br>I didn't think this chapter was "shit". I think it was a bit forced. And no I won't kill myself just because you disagree with me. Even if we have different opinions, we have to respect each other.</br>  <br><br> we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite  <br>You mean you expected<br><br> who would have been legitimate <br>Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right?<br><br> he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga <br>Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world? <br><br> It's shameful of him <br>..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you?<br><br> He tries to make people think subconsciously <br>If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amnesia.</br>  <br>Even koala?</br>  <br>Having his own life and trusting ace just like luffy did back at thriller bark when he said that Ace has to go through his adventure with his own friends. After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. If Sabo would have fought against a big shot who went against the revs during the happenings of the marineford arc, it would have shown that Sabo is an actual character and not just a plot devise/memeboy that Oda uses to have Ace in the manga after killing him off.</br>  <br>We can think up of some ideas together.<br><br><br> You mean you expected <br>No, we could have expected, but you didn't expect because you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality.<br><br> Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right? <br>I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not, since a lot of misogynists would have used this excuse to claim a 2 v 1 would have been unfair.<br><br> Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world?  <br>I didn't say it was wrong to want to spread his art. I said it's wrong to want to spread his patriarchical and misogynist culture. You are assuming something I never said. Assuming something wrong is very bad because it's what misogynists do all the time about women. You should change yourself because otherwise, your future will be very worrying. I can guess that many people will affected by you and the way you think. It's never too late to change.<br><br> ..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you? <br>Unfortunately he isn't, this is the problem. Don't you get it? And I have nothing to be ashamed of since I am not the one drawing this manga. I am saying what's wrong with it. You are defending it subconsciously because you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. Stop it right now.<br><br> If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think? <br>You don't understand anything. I explained what Oda tried to do, but you dismissed everything without addressing the point. Please think. Thinking if the first step to becoming more mature as a human being who wants to be respectful of everyone. I'll let you think on your own for some minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, only the amnesia part. And not because it doesn't make any sense, but because it's way more convenient than it could've easily been</br>  <br>Doing revolutionaries stuff while keeping tabs on both Luffy and Ace.<br>Also, he got badly wrecked during a mission before the summit war so he couldnt be there.</br></br>    <br>Koala isn't. She is an example of how a human who was victim of racism can be respectful of the group of people who were racist toward her.</br>  Which shoes are best? I'm going with crocodile's  <br>You do know that the fishman saved her little ass and helped her more than the humans did?</br>  <br>Kyros' flashback was much worse</br>  <br>This is a nice idea.<br><br><br>13<br><br><br>She was a victim of two groups and forgave both of them. She is a very great person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have gone with Ace's if it wasn't for that little skull thing.</br>  <br>Brook or Sanji for males. Robin for females.</br>   new thread <br> Rebeccafag right from the start </br>  <br>Sanji, Brook and Crocodile.

Robin's, Vivi's, Kid's. Would wear them all.<br> as a former lolita I'm laughing at 11, those are really awful </br></br>  <br> After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. <br>Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br><br>It wasn't until he found out Ace was going to be executed that he wanted to join the war. If he found out about the severity of the situation at Thriller Bark instead of at Amazon Lily, chances are he would've still wanted to go save Ace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have to separate your tastes according to genders as if men and women should always be separated. What's your favorite shoes overall?<br><br><br>No wonder considering how much you insulted them. You should be ashamed of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality. <br>ayy lmao<br><br> I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not <br>"Fair"? Really?....<br><br> You are assuming something I never said. <br>I asked you a question, buddy. And you didn't answer it.<br><br> You should change yourself  <br> It's never too late to change. <br>Fuck you.<br><br>  I am saying what's wrong with it. <br>  You are defending it subconsciously  <br>  you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. <br>Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good.<br><br>  I'll let you think on your own for some minutes. <br>*cringe*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really mind this at all. I mean, if within the space of 794 chapters an author uses amnesia as a plot device once, I think it's nothing worth getting upset over. It's a passable explanation.<br><br>That said, I would've been completely fine if it was never explained at all and just left as a minor plothole, because that's all it was in the first place. I would've preferred it if this chapter had continued on from the last one with a few more glimpses at other characters around the world rather than it be entirely focused on Sabo. That said, it's not shit writing. It's unnecessary exposition.</br></br></br>  <br> She was a victim of two groups and forgave both of them. She is a very great person. <br><br>perhaps im remembering shit wrong but when exactly was she a victim of fishmen? When Arlong kicked her?</br></br></br>  <br>Brook, Chopper and Robin.</br>  <br> Here are the Goroawase combinations: <br> 0 maru, ma, rei, re, nai, na, wa, o, zero, ze <br> 2 ni, ji, futatsu, futa, fu, bu, pu, nu, ne, tsu, zu, ju, nyu <br> 9 kyuu, gyuu, ku, gu, kokonotsu, kokono, koko, ko, go, ki, gi, kin, kun, gin, gun, nain </br></br></br></br>   news about Ace's execution reached even Imple Down <br> Iva figures out Luffy is Dragons son + Ace is Luffy's brother -&gt; Ace is Dragon's son too (can't blame for it) <br><br>Why the hell did he agree to break out from ID, if the news surely reached the Revolution Army.<br>In that case Dragon would make his own move to rescue "his son".<br>It was too risky for the breakout.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyros spared her more bloodshed you stupid fuck. The whole reason she was taught a bloodless fighting style was for this reason<br><br>How dumb do you have to be to miss the themes of a fucking kid's comic?</br></br></br>  <br>Lolita ?</br>  <br>That's the issue. I can't pick just one. If I could I wouldn't have picked three. <br><br>I'll say Brook as a tentative answer because they are pretty nice shoes.</br></br></br>  <br> ayy lmao <br>You are not even trying to answer properly. This is very lame of you.<br><br> "Fair"? Really?.... <br>I never said it was my opinion. Why don't you read things properly? I gave you a lot of time. Use it correctly instead of speedreading things and making wrong assumptions, it's not the first time you do it. You have to think.<br><br> Fuck you. <br>No.<br><br> Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good. <br>You clearly agree with him, as a matter of fact, you try to deny my points without even trying to use proper arguments, which prove you are hopeless to prove me wrong even if you are unable to. All is good for me because it allows me to shows how wrong you are, but all is bad for you because you won't change. And I want you to change because I am worried for your future.<br><br> *cringe* <br>Cringing about yourself is a good thing but the next step is to think about why you were wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Oda definitely has their dong sizes written down somewhere, right?</br>  IGNORE THE REBECCA FAG YOU IDIOTS  <br> Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br>nope that's the point: If he had his friends with him, he would have done the same as he did in Thriller bark. He would believe in Ace. He didn't because Kuma raped his crew beforehand. That connection is obvious, because in thriller bark lola outright told them that the vivre card suggests death, but luffy didn't go, because he wasn't raped by Kuma back then. Because he did belive in Ace's fate and FRIENDS. He literally found out about Ace's fate at thriller bark. He didn't belive anymore after the chaos on sabaody.<br><br><br> you <br>anon pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kokonotsu <br><br>as in the fashion</br></br></br>  <br>I admit it might have been better if dragon just didnt let him go to marineford for the sake of revolutionaries not getting involved, although it would be hard to believe you could stop sabo.

Why don't you understand that? If Rebecca was a man, she would have beaten Diamante with her father and Oda would have called that a marvelous family combination. But he didn't because Rebecca is a girl and he doesn't want to make girls fight because he thinks they should stay aside and let men do the fighting.<br><br><br>Okay.

As much as he loved Ace and Luffy, he was no longer aiming to become a pirate. He no longer had the same goal as them. And besides, when he left to be a pirate and was gunned down, he had already decided to leave them for an undetermined amount of time. After Ace and Shanks left Luffy they didn't do anything to contact him either for years. As for being a revolutionary, it's not like they can just send regular-ass mail and hope it's not traced, and how would you send mail to Ace and Luffy anyway? They lived out in a fucking jungle, no address or anything.</br>  <br><br> You are not even trying to answer properly. This is very lame of you. <br>But there is nothing to answer.

It's quite different you know... Trying to deny it would be saying <br>You didn't. I already explained everything. However you keep trying to deny my posts without making a point because you know that I am right and are frustrated at this thought. It's not right. If you disagree, then you must think and say what you disagree about. Then we'll discuss. It's alright for you to be wrong, I won't blame you, but try to help you.<br><br> this stuff ^. This is denying someone. <br>I never said what was wrong was to deny someone. It's to deny someone without giving proper arguments. You seem to have bad reading comprehension skills because you keep twisting my words. I will assume you aren't english and don't master the english language well enough yet. Try to think a little so that you won't make any bad interpretation anymore. Take your time.<br><br> Well mate.. :^) That's a waste of time. I don't care the slightest for you, you shouldn't care for me either. Don't lie to yourself pretending that you care, because you don't ;) <br>Even if you don't care about me, I care for you.

I'm fighting for your future. If you don't understand that, you will never change. When IRL shut-ins are told to change, they try to get away and to be alone, so it's not surprising that you do the same online. You are afraid of changing, so you run away from reality. It's too bad if you don't come back but your life won't become better like this. Instead of staying close-minded, you must try to think properly in order to become a mature adult respectful of other people. Believe me, as I am probably older than you.</br>  <br>Yeah. It's all kids arguing against kids. Fucking stupid. 4chan is a goddamn shithole because of this immature underage faggotry. Makes me mad.</br>  Let's just post a link to the Rebecca porn and stop replying.  <br>I don't care about not being liked. Anyway, let's talk about One Piece. What do you think about this chapter.

At Thriller Bark, Luffy assumed that Ace was probably in some kind of fight and he believed he'd be fine eventually, because A: Pirates fight and B: Ace was a really fucking strong pirate. Whether he had his crew or not, had little to do with his decision to go to Marineford, it was the fact that he found out Ace got captured with no chance to escape that made Luffy want to go. Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br><br>He felt the same when he found out about everything, but still went because the threat to Ace's life was that much greater that he didn't care about all of that anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello. I am trolling you right now with this very post.<br><br>Can you handle the crushing mysoginism? How are you dealing with the absolutely disrespectful display of male, white imperialism conveyed within my words? Does it annoy you? Does it make you angry? Good. I have dedicated all of my existence to the Patriarchy. Within this very post, you catch a glimpse of your worst enemy. I was trained from birth in secret compounds, where we learned how to harness and use our powers as heterosexual cis caucasian men in the oppression of women, homosexuals, trans, black, and any person unlike us you can think of. Only a few chosen ones, who show the highest concentrated Patriarchal power (PP) are let into those compounds. My sole goal in life is to carry out the will of my masters, and I have learned to take enjoyment from it, as have all the others who grew with me. We were nurtured in prejudice, and released back into society, where we now hunt for minorities to oppress, with normal, everyday lives serving as a disguise. And we are not few. We are many. One of the advantages of working for those in power is the ease to blend into any everyday societal role. Anyone around you could be one of us. Your father. Your brother. Your neighbor. The shop owners, the gardeners, the cab drivers, the cops, every man around you could be one of us, and you'll never know, for we are taught to keep our training a secret and take it to the grave. But still we work, in the shadows, to maintain the power of the Patriarchs. You are but one of many victims, one I have chosen to illuminate, to forcefully shove my thick hard redpill into, but worry not, I am high enough in rank within this organization that I can do it with no repercussions (I am Order of the High Fedora, by the way, with a PP of over 10000). I just thought it amusing. And no one will believe you if you tell them, anyway.<br><br>I hope you enjoy your uphill, meaningless battle. We have already won it long ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>excellent taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>Since it's a copy/pasta then there's no point in me replying to this. I've already read many things like this, it's not very interesting even as trolling. Sorry.</br>  <br> Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br>That's the point, he ignored his principles, because he tasted comlete defeat by Kuma right beforehand. maling him turn 180 and helping ace</br></br>  <br>Buggy? Croc? Daz? Is that really you?<br>also top ship</br></br>  <br> Law x Kyros could be nice. <br><br>i'm...</br></br></br>  <br>The lowest of the low was Zoro refusing to fight Monet because she's a woman. Like what the fick, Zoro is a badass that doesn't give a shit about anything, he cracked a bitch's skull in Weasky Peak and now he can't hit women?<br><br>That shits all his promise to Kuina, since he basically admitted that women can't fight men and that her despair was justified.<br><br>I'm not even a feminist or anything but Oda's misogyny is embarrassing even be Shonen standards. At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers, Nnoitra was pretty much humiliated bu Nel for being a misogynist prick, but no, Oda has to make sure that women know their place and don't even get involved with male affairs.<br><br>The text of the Genderswapped Supernovas are just sickening.

He was running around trying to get Hancock to give him a ship to go back to Sabaody until he saw the newspaper and that is what changed his whole attitude to the burning Vivre Card because he now knew the reason and how severe it was.</br>  <br>that's what makes him hot</br>  <br>No you're right, I am not the one who made the original suggestion.</br>  <br> At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers <br><br>Right, Kishimoto just makes sure they never get involved in action ever or fail miserably when they do.<br><br>Even fucking Kaguya fell for the fucking Harem jutsu</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that haki is planned, even if it might not be from chapter one.   talks about how racism is the worst thing <br> fujoshit spam  <br> posting shit washed characters  <br>this thread really is turning into SnK 2.0</br></br></br>  <br>Carue has CoO.

He helped ace, because he, after losing his friends like that, realised what ace is probably going through as he was in that situation since thriller bark as the news confirmed. without his people ace was all alone - just like luffy. If luffy would have read the news during thriller bark, he would have believed in ace an wouln't try savin him. thriller bark and impol down luffy are not the same.</br></br>  <br>conqueror's Haki has been there since Chapter 1, Shanks used it on the sea king</br>  No chapter this week?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KQJ<wbr>y0Q-td10</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>MMD Time</br></br>  <br>It's Luffy, holy sheet.</br>  <br>No.  You should read the entire chapter from now on because it usually tells us on the last page when we're not getting a chapter for the next week. </br>  <br>I love his crazy eyes</br>  <br>What am I supposed to look at here?</br>  <br>i think even sanji wouldn't bother to fight that 'women'</br>  <br>By the way, you are probably , got frustrated about not being able to answer since you implied you wouldn't anymore, and had no other choice to use a copy/pasta to reply without revealing your identity. People usually never suddenly use a random copy pasta, especially a very bad one like this, so it makes me think that you are a young teenager who discovered 4chan recently and is convinced that bad copy pastas like this are effective. It would explain why you behaved in a way as stubborn as a young shut-in refusing to listen to his parents. I understand the way you think because I studied psychology. You should try to grow up before trying to act like an adult because it's bad for your self-development.<br><br><br>I understand your point. However, Rebecca also wanted to protect her father, who was deeply injured. Kyros couldn't even stand, but Oda made him stand because he wanted to show how men and fathers are stronger than women according to his patriarchical ideology.<br><br><br>Oda takes a break from time to time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers <br>fuck off. I'd rather have women be spared from brutal fights (though there are clearly counter examples but whatever. since people like you ignore counter examples anyway) and be able to pursue their own dreams and ambitions than have their whole life and actions revolve around male characters. <br><br>If Oda doesn't want to fuck up his female characters that's on him, but at least his female characters can hold and act on their own. They're not tied down by some male love interest and their dreams/goals have nothing to do with one too. I'd take Nami and Robin any day over shits like Sakura, Hinata, or Orihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a disgusting page. It's as if the author implied that women can't do anything physically even if they are well-built.</br>  <br>oh shit that picture is perfect<br><br>I cant get enough of Sabo looking like a nutjob</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro's for comfortable active lifestyle.</br>  <br> You shouldn't talk about this kind of pointless thing anyway.  <br><br>Oda made a point of stating that Luffy's dick stretches so eat shit</br></br></br>  <br>Oda hadn't decided he was going to revive him yet</br>  <br>ty anon.

And adding to that, Oda is also taking a break... FUCK<br><br>Felt like a goddamn filler chapter after all the shit Fujitora had to handle last week, even the Gorousei showing up</br></br>  <br>On one side One Piece is one of the few shonen manga where women are actually strong and get to fight, and aren't just there to fall in love with the MC. On the other side there's the fanservice, a lot of shitty perverted characters and shit like the Monet thing. <br>I don't understand Oda on this, never have.</br></br>  <br><br>here's the first one for comparison</br></br>  <br>Just to joke with his readers. But it's still pointless.<br><br><br>His female characters are very restrained.<br>Sakura is a good character. She is a strong woman who can fight for herself and cares for her daughter. Too bad Kishimoto made her into a housewife despite her being so strong. Same for Hinata.<br><br>Orihime is stuck with the support role, but Rukia is fine. Bleach isn't that bad. Yoruichi is also very strong.<br><br><br>Either you prove my point about you being a young teenager who discovered 4chan recently, or you are another person who discovered One Peace threads recently.<br><br>Also, calling bait and using a reaction picture when you don't agree with something is what every person without argument does.

That is when he panics. You can see him immediately reacting to that news, stressed out because of it. Claiming it's because of the Kuma-thing is nothing more than a wild guess. Luffy is the type that will leave you to do your own thing and fight your own battles, but when there is absolutely no way out, that is when he comes in to rescue you, whether you like it or not. They even had a little argument over it at Marineford, about how it's an unwritten pirate rule not to go save people of completely different crews just because of a personal connection, because it's humiliating.<br><br>He helped Ace because Ace was going to die and had zero chance of escaping on his own. He couldn't rely on his own power, Luffy fully knew that and Luffy didn't care about leaving it to the Whitebeards with him doing nothing. Had he been told about it on Thriller Bark, he would've gone to Marineford. Had he been told about it on Sabaody, he would've dropped the New World to go to Marineford. That is the type of person Luffy is and according to Ivankov, it's a trait he inherited from his father. The only difference is that his crew would've wanted to go with him. If you still think Luffy would've stayed out of it if he had obtained complete intel of what was going on with Ace before the seperation, then by all means, carry on, but I'm done.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128447781 <br> I like you <br> It's hilarious, please proceed. <br>These words are extremely similar to<br> You're an amusing person, you really are. <br>from <br>You completely proved my point : you are indeed the same person.<br><br> If you call it REVERSEtrolling, aren't you admitting to being a troll yourself. <br>You are indeed the same new teenager who doesn't understand 4chan' vocabulary and keeps misunderstanding on your own everything I write without trying to make a point.

Didn't you say you were going to leave me alone or whatever? 4chan is for adults. I understand that you want to speak with adults, but take things slowly.

Today, your "love luck" is..." <br> Law: "How many people did you kill, Drake-ya-san?" <br> Capone: "Military force and cosmetics are totally different!!" <br> Kidd: "Won't you form an alliance and have a joshikai?" [literally "girl meeting"- basically a get together among girl friends/female colleagues. Usually out at a restaurant/cafe.] <br> Drake: "I don't understand what's so interesting about Pacifistas" (this is the girls-don't-get-robots "joke") <br> Killer: "I'm back, and I brought pancakes and macaroons. We're all such good friends, huh" <br> Bonney: "Donburi!! Bring the next donburi" [donburi is a rice bowl with fish or meat] <br> Apoo: "Apyapya- So you don't know of my cuteness!?" <br> Urouge: "Wahh it's a Tenryuubito dassa" [not sure if that final, odd copula has some sort of joke behind it] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is good for my heart. Thanks bro.</br>  <br>I am helpless!<br>Why do you think I'm acting like this?<br>Don't be heartless, please! I want to change my ways and help women overthrow the dirty pig male government! I want men to suffer like women did for so long! We have wronged them for too long!</br></br></br>  <br>What does 'intercrural' mean ? Apparently the spelling is off cause I've got the red squiggly under the word.</br>  <br>Okay I have to admit that's kind of gross. There's nothing left of their personalities.</br>  <br>Fuuck, Kidd and Drake are the best! Killer too. For some reason, the mask adds to the hotness.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128448165 <br>I should add the fact that you overreact as if you felt directly offended, which is strange for someone who implied he wasn't the one who replied to my posts.<br><br><br>Do you realize that in real life, upset people speak exactly the way you write? You're basically telling me that you are desperate and are trying to damage control. As a proof, you're not even addressing the point and are showing that you really got offended by something that everyone is unfortunately already used to in One Piece threads. I can read you like I'd read through a book.<br><br><br>Those are some stereotypes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura is a good character <br>Man, Sakura's whole character and actions were dictated by her interest in Sasuke. Even til the fucking epilogue. Yeah, she was 'physically' strong but is that what matters to you guys when it comes to female characters? Physical strength/good fights = good female characters? I don't care if she got to pulverize a puppet master or some shit. Her character is shit and what dictates her actions are even shitter. Same with Hinata and Orihime. <br><br>Robin is strong and cares for her crewmates too. But so what? That's not the reason why I like her. Besides her personality and looks, I like Robin because her ambitions are pretty damn important to the history and lore of the One Piece world. Nami's not my most favorite female character but even she has ambitions that I find admirable and she can hold her own too with her wits alone when it comes down to it. I don't care if they act like 'typical girls' or don't get to 'fight' (though they have, just not as much). They have their own shit they're pursuing that doesn't revolve around fighting, and you sure as hell don't have to worry about them giving that shit up because of some guy. <br> <br>If anything, it's the fact that Oda doesn't put them in situations where they have to fight or get brutally beaten is what might be upsetting. We already know Nami and Robin can and will if it comes down to it. And it's because I know that and I LIKE these characters, I just wish they'd get more spot light. (because honestly in battle shounen manga, fights = screen time). But again, I would rather have good female characters that I can respect, but have them be jipped of fights, than have shitty female characters that do.<br><br> Too bad Kishimoto made her into a housewife despite her being so strong. Same for Hinata. <br>That's the thing. Oda is pretty much the opposite and I would MUCH rather have the opposite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bonus</br></br>  <br>Wow, fuck you, I'm asking for help here and you just act like a big meanie.<br>Screw this, I'm done talking to you. Have a nice day.</br></br>   no chapter this week   <br>Any Femapoo lewd pics?</br>  <br>That is adorable and kinda hot at the same time. <br><br>Do you think we'll ever get to see Killer's face and do you think he's going to be related to some other character ?</br></br></br>  <br>As someone said a week ago, this was just unnecessary, even with no amnesia getting to MH in time was a difficult feat to pull. Sabo could just have been too far away.</br>  <br> best manga ever <br>That's a bit of an exaggeration right there.</br></br>  <br>Capone reminds me a lot of my grandmother, warmed my heart. Very cute overall but I don't see why Hawkins should be smiling if male Hawkins is usually poker faced, right? Killer is the most bland one here to me, literally stuck his mask to a Nami clone.  Genderbend arc fucking when. </br>  <br>Except he was presumed dead for 10 years. Even if he thought Ace and Luffy didn't see it, someone from the town surely would and word would travel.</br>  <br> memory loss doesn't occur as a result of blunt and repercussive explosive head trauma. <br>It's really common in incidents like what happened to Sabo.<br>If Sabo had no memory loss, like Pell, that would be bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>nah, she too cute man</br>  <br>btw your constant misuse of the word misogyny is laughable. please go to tumblr where your attitude and fucked up sense of reality is welcomed and encouraged</br>  <br>Did you not read what the characters are saying ? Hawkins is talking about love and shit. Not % of death.</br>  <br>well, he's able to fly with the crows apparently, i think Luffy got the news 7 days before the execution, so that's not really a good excuse.</br>  <br>Nigga, but that Drake tho.</br>  <br> Apparently the spelling is off <br><br>literally google the word</br></br></br>  <br> but Rukia is fine <br>wasn't her whole thing about her captain too? what's her ambitions anyway? But yeah, she's much better than Orihime, though I don't really know what dictates her actions besides Ichigo.<br><br> Yoruichi is also very strong. <br>I was mainly talking about the main female cast. But you're right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura wasn't just interested by Sasuke, she also showed many good traits. For example, she wanted to show to her childhood friend how much she had grown up, and she risked her life fighting against a dangerous terrorist. She also confessed to Naruto basically to help him. It's true that she is obsessed with Sasuke, and it's a very bad thing, but it overshadows her qualities.<br><br>Robin is a great character, I completely agree with you about that. It would be better if she wasn't portrayed as weak during battles. For example, she got easily "beaten" by Diamante's spikes despite that she had her full strength. Kind of strange.<br><br> If anything, it's the fact that Oda doesn't put them in situations where they have to fight or get brutally beaten is what might be upsetting. <br>I completely agree with you. I don't like women getting beaten up and violence overall, but they should be as involved in fights like men.<br><br><br>I verbally crushed you, so you had no choice than to put on a persona like you don't care. It's the best way to hide your anger, and also the worst way because it's obvious to people who studied psychology. Not acting seriously helps you to pretend your serious self doesn't feel offended, and now that you began to do so, you are forced to keep doing it because if suddenly go back to writing seriously, you will feel even more ashamed of yourself.<br><br>If I were wrong about you being the same person, you would have just said so, but instead, you kept replying in a naive way that I perfectly read through. You basically confirmed once again my point, and after realizing that putting a face to damage control wouldn't work, you decided to leave once again so that you wouldn't be even more humiliated.<br> Screw this, I'm done talking to you. Have a nice day. <br> So I'm going to leave you alone, as I'd have done IRL, had we met. So goodbye ~ <br>Don't pretend to be two different people on a thread next time, since this time you failed very hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's using someone else's crows which may not have been accessible 2 years ago. The problem is him not contacting either of them even though he blew up about 50 metres in front of the town.</br>  <br>The whole village was burned alive at the end of the flashback. The only way a villager would find out is if they joined the revolutionary army.<br><br>Amnesia after being blown up is reasonable.</br></br></br>  <br>Intercrural sex is dick between thighs, not going in the vagina</br>  <br>that's disgusting<br><br>but Apoo is still cute</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and he looks exactly like Sanjis next wanted poster.</br>  <br>No thanks.<br><br><br>I think she admired him as a person, not as a man.<br><br> I was mainly talking about the main female cast. But you're right <br>Unfortunately, the female main cast isn't very big, I would have liked Kubo to add one girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Intercrural  <br>Why the fuck am I getting red squiggleys ?I'm not spelling it wrong, am I ? <br><br> It would feel like heaven with Kalifa though. Although, I'm not an expert on what would happen to your dick with that much soap </br></br></br></br>  <br>A U T I S M</br>  <br> Why the fuck am I getting red squiggleys <br><br>I dont get them, are you using a brit-based spellcheck?</br></br></br>  <br>well it's Kalifa, so any kind of sex with her where she uses her powers would basically be forced withdrawal</br>  <br>Intelligence and psychology.</br>  <br>probably never, but hopefully Bonney arc will give us some cute pic related hijinks. <br><br>I really need to know Apoos tragic past. Did his parents not approve of him becoming a DJ or something?</br></br></br>  <br> yfw new bounties appear before Kidd Co vs Shanks <br> Killer starts sweating <br> Kidd, there's something I have to do before this <br> I need to find the damn Strawhats, right now <br> Cue Kidd Co vs StrawHeart </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Does the British not like fake doing it ?<br><br><br> forced withdrawal <br>Is this another sex thing I don't understand ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you just write your own story?<br>You can't use the patriarchy as an excuse because the most successful author of all time is both alive right now and a female.<br><br>Not even the anon you were arguing with.<br><br>You have a better mastery of literature than Oda, surely, after all he is a misogynist and you are culturally aware.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oda made it up recently, because the only purpose of this amnesia is to fill this hole. It will never be of any use or explanation in the future ever.</br></br>  <br> autistic SJW armchair psychologist <br>ok sure</br></br>  <br>you know what withdrawal is right? well if Kalifa was using her powers it would basically force your dick to leave whatever hole you had it in, she'd basically be forcing you to withdraw</br>  <br>do you think fodder actually die? like im pretty sure a shit ton of fodder died in the alabsta war, but what about later arcs? did people die from enel electroctuting them, did anyone die from the birdcage, the buster call, etc. or did oda literally throw what he wrote out the window?</br>  <br>Apoo looks happy as shit, what are you on about ? His parents were nice enough to buy him a bloody piano. And he actually has a comb, so he was probably in a normal family.</br>  <br> Not even the anon you were arguing with. <br>Really? Yet you are using the same childish irony that is usually never used on 4chan. Either you're the same person who came back once again or you're another person, but either way, know that such irony is pointless because it's basically just an empty attack that I've seen hundreds of time out of 4chan.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><br>It would be a fun past. His parents would be proud of him now since he's a good DJ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I know what withdrawal means in terms of banks and drugs but I wad not aware you could use it in this context. <br><br>Also, we're talking about Kalifa, not Alvida. I mean, soap is slippery and all but it's not That bad. And it's between the thighs so you need some major grip to even do it normally.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo was shown at Logue Town looking at Luffy but not remembering him.<br>Dragon was shown rescuing him when ace died.<br><br>So all the way back at East Blue it was foreshadowed Sabo had amnesia, so I have to assume you are trolling or anime only.<br>Pic unrelated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> poor people don't have combs </br>  <br>  It would be better if she wasn't portrayed as weak during battles.  <br>When is Robin ever portrayed as weak? If anything, it's more of a consensus that her powers are too OP that it makes her fights boring. She just rarely gets long 1v1 fights because of this. Her last 1v1 fight on FI ended pretty quickly cause all she had to do was double clutch the guy. <br> she got easily "beaten" by Diamante's spikes despite that she had her full strength. <br>She wasn't really "beaten" by Diamante since she didn't even fight him? She just got injured from his spike balls because she was there to protect Rebecca since Luffy told her to. She pretty much sacrificed her well being to do so. Even with her being injured she didn't seem too worn out by the end of the day.<br><br> It's true that she is obsessed with Sasuke, and it's a very bad thing, but it overshadows her qualities. <br>That's the thing. It overshadows her other qualities because every goddamn time you think she can grow out of it, she goes back to square one with her Sasuke obsession. And why couldn't she become a medic ninja like Tsunade in the end instead of just a housewife? Do both? I don't know, it just made it seem like her character's end goal was to become Sasuke's wife and she achieved that in the end, yay. Good for her but that's not that admirable in my eyes. Same with Hinata, though at least she was gunning for a decent guy throughout the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, exactly, so why did he become a pirate?</br>  <br>Withdrawal in the sex term is when you take out your dick prior to cumming, and Kalifa's power is retardedly slippy, like how she actually cleaned Sanji's strength off</br>  <br>I wasn't attacking you, I was serious. Freedom of Speech suggests Oda can write his story however he wants, and you can write yours how you want.<br>So would not that course of action be more productive?</br></br>  <br>I did read what they were saying. So? Why the hell would lady Hawkins be talking about love when that's not male Hawkins' style at all. Just because it's a typical girly girl thing to do? That's how you do genderbend wrong. Personality and attitude should stay the same entirely imo.<br><br>Man Kuzan and Teach were such ugly ducklings. Who would you bully, /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Bonney looks like the only person who'd have a tragic past. Look at her. She's all fucked up. Probably had to work her ass off and starve for a few days to buy food or something until she was saved by  Whitebeard/Akainu </br>  <br>I'm , I just got back from the gym. That guy ain't me. What's up?</br>  <br>Oh, come on. Who's the one person besides Apoo to have used a comb ?</br>  <br>You asked why she was smiling. I answered why she was smiling. I really don't care what you think about genderbends and shit.</br>  <br>Brits are known to be kind of stuffy, sex-wise<br><br>not surprising.

Like a pug.</br>  <br>Kek, I'm not even British. But yes, thigh sex sounds more normal on a pornsite compared to bloody Intercrural. Sounds like a medical manoeuvre.</br>  <br>I believe people are referring to this.</br>  <br/>  <br>You make a wrong interpretation of your own words, you begin replying to me right after the same person pretended to leave for the second time, you make an off-topic point that doesn't contradict what I say. Same person without reading comprehension skills, I easily read through you.<br><br><br>How convenient to show up all of a sudden. Next time, try not to act tough by claiming you came back from the gym and using "ain't" and "what's up" in a completely unnatural way. Moreover, you are barely trying to reply even though before you pretended to leave, you were eager to reply. Try also to pick a better time to come back.<br>You are quite the desperate person, aren't you?<br><br>You were angered by how I revealed your true identity, and since you're a bad loser, you try to make me believe I was wrong in order to get back at me. I told you that I studied psychology. You are clearly acting like a teenager. 4chan isn't for you yet. I'm saying this for your sake, leave 4chan, think, and come back after becoming an adult because you are still too immature.<br><br><br> When is Robin ever portrayed as weak? <br>I meant during fights. She often gets injured or taken down without putting up a fight.<br> She wasn't really "beaten" by Diamante since she didn't even fight him? <br>What's strange is that her powers weren't enough to protect herself from mere spikes, when we know she can creates powerful giant legs.<br> It overshadows her other qualities because every goddamn time you think she can grow out of it, she goes back to square one with her Sasuke obsession. <br>I completely agree with you, her obsession for Sasuke is too emphasized and exaggerated.<br><br>I am going to sleep everyone, good night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice quads. witnessed.<br>who were the 3 people?</br></br>  <br>Luffy, Buggy and Alvida</br>  <br>The coat and top hat are too much to shrug it off, but it's Koala's fault.</br>  <br>Quad 9 already got it but her est he full page.<br>Sabo amnesia is not an ass pull, but a realistic and foreshadowed symptom of being blown up.</br></br>  where's the thigh-fucking dellinger doujins  <br> bloody <br>oh gosh anon, stop!</br></br>  <br>Did Luffy have a bounty by in Loguetown ? I can't remember<br><br><br> It's Koala's fault <br>Sorry, what ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want more dellinger doujins</br>  <br>I usually do say 'bloody' here and there. I can't help it man.</br>  <br>You don't know what an asspull is, I was not saying that it was possible or not possible but whether or not it was planned.</br>  <br>he got his bounty after beating arlong, so yeah.</br>  <br> its cute </br>  <br>She convinced Sabo not to rescue Ace at Marinrford, is what I believe he is referring to, based on her introduction where she tells Sabot he dud the right thing letting Ace die.<br>Koala could easily be a CP0 agent, like Califa to Iceberg.</br></br>  <br>Goodnight psychologist-chan</br>  Have been busy last wekk, and just got to read the latest chapter.<br>mfw amnesia.<br>I'm curious, what was /a/'s reaction?</br></br>  <br>So much wasted potential. Trap dom, footjob, thighjob, face sitting, Dellinger was made for porn but there's practically nothing of him. Not a single doujin.</br>  <br>I dont want it to happen, Koala is too pure<br>  r-right?  </br></br>  <br>Sabo was not to blame for not going because he had no memory but that was not Koala's take on the issue, instead she went saying "no one knows the what if" which is not the issue.</br>  <br> On the other side there's the fanservice, <br><br>Oda shaming you slut-shamers</br></br></br>  <br>It really is, only stuff I've found of him is a few bad edits from anime screenshots</br>  <br>This is too funny, thank you for the entertainment.<br>Write your own story, it is more likely to change opinions than shitting on the most successful mangaka of all time on an English image board expecting him to change his story to your approval</br></br>  <br>you are the biggest condescending prick of all time. keep on pretending to psychoanalyze anonymous people on the internet.</br>  <br>I forgot when it was actually published in the papers. Cheers bro.<br><br><br>Well, she had a point though. One guy really was not going to make much of a difference. Even the bloody MC failed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>c'mon mods, you banned the Luccifag, you're 1/2 of the way there</br>  Nightly reminder that Law a slut.  <br>Realism. Oda is a multidimensional writer, writing his story because it is in his head rather than as a persuasive speech to appeal to any given audience.</br>  <br>Keeping Kizaru on check would help. And only in FT the MC can muster the willpower to defeat an opponent miles ahead of him in power and experience.</br>  <br>there has been a horrifyingly low amount of Law posting</br>  <br>This is my lifestyle we're talking about. I don't want to get insecure over a word Anon.</br>  <br> She often gets injured or taken down without putting up a fight. <br>Everyone gets injured during fights. Zoro must've been the weakest shit to you pre-timeskip. And when was the last time Robin got taken down during a fight? She usually blasts through fodder like nothing. And she won all her 1v1 fights (though she only had two so I guess that's not saying much).<br> What's strange is that her powers weren't enough to protect herself from mere spikes. <br>Because she doesn't have haki, and they're spikes? Why wouldn't she get injured? She was covering Rebecca with her own body. Getting hurt =/= weakness. Especially when you purposely do so to protect another. I don't even know what or why you're arguing this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think pre-TS Sabo could occupy Kizaru ? Marco barely managed it and I'm pretty damn sure he was stronger than Ace, who was on the same level as Sabo.</br>  <br>I know others have posted it, but here is both in color and a 2+ years comparison shot.</br>  <br> nothing wrong with being cute </br>  <br>Ace's rescue was a success, Ace just goofed.<br><br>And Sabo is as strong as Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't even know what or why you're arguing this ? <br>Really, nigga ? You seriously don't know why the fuck Rebeccafag posts bullshit that doesn't make sense ? <br><br><br>His hat's got a blue tinge. Wonder if Shueisha knew about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Marco was shown to be at or below Ace's level. Without Phoenix Kizaru would have won almost instantly.<br>Sabo was surely stronger than Luffy, who DID SUCCEED in rescuing Ace.<br>With Sabo there on top of that, Ace would be alive.<br>Akainu was not able to one shot ace in a fight, he tried and failed and then target Luffy, remember?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see Ace holding up Kizaru, is what I'm saying. Especially when proficient Haki users like Marco and Vista couldn't hit Akainu and Whitebeard couldn't hit Aokiji. Sabo, presumably, don't even have a fruit. It just would have been a slightly stronger Luffy on the battlefield.</br>  <br> marco was shown to be at or below ace's level <br><br>and that anon's is how you know not to respond</br></br></br>  <br> Sabo was surely stronger than Luffy <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Yea, but do you think Ace would be as strong as he is without the Mera Mera ? All his attacks were completely based on it. He tangoed with Aokiji because of the fruit too. He was miles above Luffy just because he had a Logia. I know he was naturally stronger than Luffy but you get the idea. I don't know. Wonder if Sabo would have died instead if he was there. One of them had to save Luffy, right ?</br>  <br>Ace was only burned when he clashed with Akainu.<br>Akainu was permanently scared from the attacks the WB commanders and crocodile hit him with.<br>Sabo was the oldest brother and implied to be the strongest.<br>If Sabo was there once Luffy grabbed Ace Sabo could have KO Ace when he stayed being a dumb ass and carried him away from Akainu.<br>Luffy had no way to</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sabo is Dragon's second in command, "slightly" stronger than Luffy is a joke. Sabo can't have a fruit's power then leave it to get another.<br><br>The rescue was a success and Ace ruined it.</br></br></br>  <br>Ace and Sabo were stronger than Luffy as kids and neither of them had fruits. I think it's fair to say their growth was relative until Ace got a Logia.<br><br><br>Stop it Anon. You're making me all happy inside.</br></br></br></br>  <br> try not to act tough by claiming you came back from the gym <br>Kek, you're too much man. I think I finally figured out that you're not supposed to be taken seriously, and I admit I was having a hard time keeping control and not rage quiting like a weak minded faggot. But anyways, good night. ~ :)</br></br>  <br>This. Sorachi is probably the best mangaka at portraying female characters.</br>  <br>According to Blackbeard who scarred Shank and killed Whitebeard and killed commander thatch, ace was skilled with no DF. Luffy never beat ace even when ace had no DF.<br><br>AKAINU did NOT defeat Ace in a fight.<br>He realized that it would be a drawn out battle so he targeted Luffy instead.<br><br>Re read.<br>SABO AND ACE would be hard for Akainu to deal with.<br><br>If Ace lasted two seconds longer, WHITEBEARD would have arrived.<br><br>Remember right after ace dies WB pounds Akainu?<br>If Sabo was there it would have been:<br>1. Ace<br>2. Sabo<br>3. Fluffy<br>And the mother fuckinG Whitebeard vs Akainu.<br><br>Think about that anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, alright, I getcha. I know Akainu didn't defeat Ace in a fight and that wasn't the point I was going for. But I get you.</br>  <br>kagura best girl</br>  did rebecca fag fuck off yet? should i go back to playing games?  <br>That's not Tsukki.</br>  <br>Kagura, tsukki, Tama, Sa-chan even Otae is loved in Japan... So every female character in Gintama is best girl</br>  <br> Otae <br>That last chapter tho</br></br>  <br> Otae  <br>I can do without her. Kagura and Tama for me.</br></br>  <br>See Sorachi writes the best female characters... I personally think that Nami is a great character and Oda writes her and every female characters very well but people expected to see more of Nami in this arc and were disappointed that she didn´t do much. <br>But they are forgetting how well Oda wrotte Nami in Skypea arc.</br></br>  <br>After they do their part during the serious section they immediately go to shit and become irrelevant fanservice dolls. Thank fuck Robin is still somewhat okay.</br>  <br>Beside Sorachi which mangaka writes the best female characters in shounen manga?</br>  <br>Honestly none because it's shonen manga and supposedly little Japanese boys don't like that shit, at least according to Jump.</br>  <br>Nami was fine in Punk Hazard though. You could say the same about Brook, Chopper and Sanji this arc too. Honestly Brook has it the worst out of all the strawhats.</br>  <br>I don't think the readers actually care, it's more that the adults of Japan are old-fashioned and a bit sexist.<br><br>I really didn't want to bring up Shingeki no Kyojin but I like most female characters. I also like the main girl from Noragami. They're nothing compared to Gintama's girls, though.</br></br></br>  <br>simpsonsthatsthepoint.jpg</br>  <br> I really didn't want to bring up Shingeki no Kyojin <br>Why not? Mikasa was cool but she became annoyingly obsessive towards eren. I like the other characters though, but dropped it during the politic arc cause it got pretty boring. Plus I didn't really like the twist (titans = humas) even though I saw it coming from a mile away. Did it pick up a bit?</br></br>  <br> dropped it during the politic arc <br><br>I think SnK is the only manga I've dropped before. So boring.</br></br></br>  <br>No we had that countdown for luffy to get his haki back.</br>  <br>Killer is such a good character lmao</br>  <br>I want to see more of his interactions with his crew/captain. He seems surprisingly mature and mellow for a guy with a name Killer and tree trunk neck that wields dual scythes.</br>  <br>best mom</br>  <br>I want Killer and femkiller to be my mom and dad.</br>  <br>Femkidd, femapoo, femhawkins and femkiller having brunch together while femhawkins predict their love life and they all discuss how to murder Shanks.</br>  Please kick me at the speed of light, oh based admiral  <br>sabos inclusion in the story was already bad the moment the three cups were first hinted at. There is no need for him in this story at all, rather, it's the opposite, he really undermines luffies progression without his brother and losing his closest family member. Now he has a replacement with even THE SAME FUCKING DEVILFRUIT. He is literally Ace v.2.0</br>    <br>how the fuck do you not like Sabo?</br>  <br> tfw my toaster phone won't allow me to hit perfects in the Dance Hall </br>  <br> duz bunz <br> koocodul <br> boogy <br>toei pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>this scenario would have been so based</br>    <br>because...of the reasons i just stated?</br>  <br>by your logic you shouldn't even be watching One Piece or anime in general.<br><br>If you don't like characters that are just copies of other characters that is.</br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>When Law leaves, I'll do my best to appreciate Law everyday.</br>  <br>Well it's not like we can get enough of Law anyway. I know I don't. Some people are tired of him, tho.<br><br>But, yes, more.</br></br></br>  <br>as you wish</br>  <br>I'd say I need the sexier ones but there's a thread for that, I guess. So thanks, anon. I appreciate it.<br><br>God, I don't want him to go. What do I do</br></br></br>  <br>I dont have a lot of non /y/ Law, unfortuantely</br>  <br><br> Got called out for starting the thread with "HURR SHIT WRITING, AMIRITE?" <br> "Hurr anyone who called out my shitposting is an 'oda cocksucker'" <br> Moving goalposts saying he was just posting opinion <br><br>Maybe you should try to post opinion and instigate discussion without coming off as a smug piece of shit who's fishing for reactions next time around.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does this mean you have a lot of /y/ Law? <br><br>The number of pictures in my Law folder is around 800. For some reason, I still need more.</br></br></br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>If you could share them on /y/, I would appreciate it so much. /y/ is so slow though. And not enough LawLu for some reason.</br>  is there a new comic tonight?  <br>On my phone, working with very little right now, though there is a pretty big One Piece thread over there</br>  <br>There is. Except still not enough Law last time I checked. I try to stalk it. But thanks, anon.</br>  <br>that doesn't even make any sense, twice<br>first off it's not that they are copies of ...whatever you are referring to(unless you count tashigi) that is the problem, it's that sabo was created and introduced just around the time another one was killed. He is literally just a replacement. It's like your mom got killed and then your father marries a woman exactly like your mother a month later and acts like this new woman was your mother the whole time.<br><br>Second, as i said, what "copies" are you talking about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll post when I'm on my PC</br>  <br>Too feminine for fujos.</br>  <br>what would have been better though? I was too far to make it in time? shit whitebeard did and its not like there was a lot of time since the execution got announced.</br>  <br>Well fujos have shit taste because Dellinger is the superior boy.</br>  <br>that anatomy</br>  <br>Thanks! Will stalk the /y/ thread then!</br>  <br> he really undermines luffies progression without his brother and losing his closest family member.  <br>The inclusion of Sabo doesn't erase the fact that Ace still died and Luffy still lost an important person in his life. He has someone to share his grief now, but he still had to grow from it. And I thought it was nice that Sabo reassured Luffy that it was a good thing he was still alive and got out of there safe even though Ace died. Luffy was pretty broken after ace's death but Sabo saying something like that probably gave him some sort of nice closure. It did for me as a reader anyway. <br> There is no need for him in this story at all <br>And I'm pretty sure he'll play an important role later in the story too so i doubt your statement will hold up later in the series. <br><br> He is literally Ace v 2.0 <br>and fuck this. Other than the devilfruit and being Luffy's (dedicated) brother what other similarities does Ace and Sabo have? If you can't look past blatantly obvious similarities that the author purposefully put in to create parallelisms to judge a character, then that's on you and your shitty reading comprehension skills. Sabo's personality, quirks, morals, drives etc. all seem different. He's a completely different character and you know it. If not, then seriously you're dumb as fuck and probably can't comprehend anything past superficial characteristics unless the author fucking spells it out for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>14859<br>Naruto The Last Movie BD/DVD Torrent is out</br></wbr>  <br>Thank you op.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128448377 <br><br>There's 2 kinds of people in /a/</br></br>  <br>you are welcome<br>i was going to post that to previous thread but coolest mod deleted it</br></br>   Spanish   <br>Chinese/Korean I think.</br>  <br>based</br>  <br>there should be english as well<br>check the subtitle and audio options</br></br>  are these subs decent <br>have you watched it yet OP you cunt</br>  No new material here.<br><br>Please fuck off.</br></br>  <br> didnt checked </br>  <br>Find a noose and use it.</br>  Is the audio Japanese?

Her face looks really derpy. Anybody order it?  <br>Try asking /v/ where you can buy the latest CoD, or /lit/ where you can buy a book and see what happens.</br>  <br>You got an image for the one scroll to the left of the Kirino one with the Takane visible?<br><br>I have Takane preordered and preordered pic related but nothing else. Will probably get Haruka.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't even get a chance to PO. She was gone almost immediately within the same week she was announced! I only order from amiami btw. She looks nice to me.</br>  <br>Amazon for about $110. It's just one of those construct-it-yourself deals. Needed a small desk that could still support the arm-mounted monitors and look good while doing it.<br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Last I checked, Rightstuf still has her available for order.</br>  <br>That's a good price. Could you give me a link?</br>  <br> Kirino <br><br>Yes there is.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand why they put a shit instead of delicious brown loli in that outfit.</br>  <br>That's not a comparable example. Buying common figures and widely available dakis is explained in the guide just fine. If someone had been asking about where does he buy the latest mass produced daki, then sure, ignore him. That would be like these false comparisons that you are so determined to force. But no one is asking about where to buy some common figure or daki.  is an exclusive that's only sold at one webshop, which is completely in Japanese. If buytard isn't going to update the guide to include info about Animaru and other shops that sell exclusives, then people will continue to ask about where to buy these products. This condescending attitude of "I know, but I'm not going to tell you" is only going to invite more resentment. <br><br>And you wonder why people keep spamming Pochacho in these threads....</br></br></br>  <br>That is god damn gorgeous, anon.</br>  <br>As stated before, people that can't figure out where to buy exlusives won't be able to figure out how to buy there.</br>  <br> slowly getting into idols <br>ganbatte you're best, anonkun</br></br>  <br>You can keep "stating" that all you want, but that doesn't make it correct. Any proxy service worth their salt will be able to order the item if you just send them the link and say "please buy one of these for me."</br>  <br>Lucky for you I still had my computer build sheet archived from years ago (cause fuck if I remember what it was called). Price is up to 160, perhaps I had gotten it on sale.<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0<wbr>04VLW38Q/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=U<wbr>TF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3K90JHFOGRITA</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Being this salty still. <br>It's been hours and you're still on this?<br>Come on man, this is just pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br> just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right <br><br>i finally understood what shirou meant</br></br></br>  can i just ask whats the deal with idols? I haven't seen any idol animes so i'm unaware of the appeal. Is it just the typical 'cute girls doing cute things' or is there something much more compelling that my simple mind can't comprehend?  <br>The guide does mention proxy services which can help there</br>  <br>I really should take some photos when it's daytime.<br><br>I have Takane, Makoto, Kotori and Rin on order. I'm hoping I can get Ranko at aftermarket.</br></br></br>  <br> XBox <br><br>It's no wonder IM@S hasnt had a good start to it as Love Live. It'll be interesting to see how it does on PS4. I wonder what kind of art they'll use.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, I read that singing.</br>  <br>It's not correct, though. The guide goes into detail about good proxy services. All explained in English. All the proxy services that ship overseas have an English website. With a url for the item you want, which you don't need to be able to read Japanese to copy and paste, you can order the item you want. All you need is the url, and if people in buyfag threads can share their knowledge (not like they can), then the buyer doesn't need to speak a single word of Japanese.</br>  <br>Don't you see anon, your post is Pochacho</br>  <br>I can't quite comprehend it myself, but my mind feeds on it like a poor ginger girl being given hambagaa.</br>  What series that don't have any would you like figures of?<br><br>Personally, I would love FullMetal Alchemist scales.</br></br>  <br>Everything from iM@S2 onwards has been on PS anyway.</br>  <br>Idol anime are pretty stupid and hard to watch from what I've seen, and I'm saying that as a guy who watches other anime purely for the appeal of cute girl characters. I don't get the appeal.</br>  <br>Sangoku Hime</br>  <br>No, that's an iWatch with a Touhou wallpaper.</br>  I think we should stop saying "Please read the guide before asking questions" in the OPs of these threads, and instead just say "Please don't ask us any questions," since it's obvious that any kind of questions asked of this group will cause heated responses and massive elitist shitflinging.  <br>Give me a SamFlam G.E.M. <br><br>Also I know this is a new anime but I hope we get some Dandelion figures. It doesn't seem to be that popular so I doubt we're getting any.</br></br></br>  <br>LOADINGU</br>  <br>That's not her fart, that's her crap</br>  <br> iwatch <br>Anon, please.</br></br>  <br>Well, whatever Apple calls it. Magical Watch, or iPhone Mini. I don't actually know.</br>  <br>shave your arm anon</br>  <br>But I'm not a cute girl like you guys <br><br>Apple Watch</br></br></br>  <br>Just to grow inferior black hair instead. Are you ok?</br>  <br>Thanks. Will probably buy it in 1-2 years.</br>  <br> shave your arm anon <br>What the fuck? Are you unable to tell that he is male?</br></br>  <br> SamFlam G.E.M. <br>Scales would be nice, but SHF would be great.</br></br>  <br>There are guys on /a/ RIGHT NOW who unironically shave all their hair "below the eyebrows." It's mostly Asians and other males whose bodies naturally produce about half the normal amount of testosterone of Europeans.</br>  <br>I love you</br>  <br>Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian.<br>Dalian has a figure from Freeing but it's not all that great, and the handful of prize figures from Furyu are shit. Even a petit set would be great at this point.</br></br>  Sorry for the shitty quality but this is my room. I currently got 12 figures on preorder so i might fill up my desk space.  Is it possible to get Megami posters without the fold marks?  <br>Nice K-on wall scroll.</br>  <br>People generally scan them. Find a highres scan, get printed, done.</br>  I wish my room wasn't so shit, /a/'s rooms are so nice.  <br>You need some risers.</br>  <br>Very good.</br>  <br>Lets see her.</br>  <br>As a little girl you should always strive to have a cute and neat room.</br>  <br> iwatch <br>this triggers me so hard. Its the Apple Watch, not iWatch. not once was it ever called the iWatch. Either way its a product that shouldnt exist.</br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br>A lot of them are pretty ugly and do little to disprove the stereotype that we all live in our mother's basement.</br>  <br>I own one and I agree with you. I have a Stockholm syndrome relationship with it.</br>  <br> name all your products "i + [normal sounding item name]" <br> iPhone = a smartphone made by Apple <br> iPad = a tablet computer made by Apple <br> iPod = an mp3 player made by Apple <br> iMac, iWork, iMovie, iBooks, iCloud, iLife, etc.  <br> make a watch <br> suddenly drop the iconic naming scheme <br> people are supposed to JUST KNOW that it's not called iWatch. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about idol anime, but some dance sequences are nice to watch.<br><br>And there are so many girls that there's always some character design to appeal to someone's tastes.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that hard to follow a technology news site or use google</br>  <br>shut up iTard.</br>  <br>Does it really matter? It doesn't have the popularity or namestay that the iPhone and iPads have, and will eventually die out in a year or two when Apple tries to replace it with something else. Either that or they'll try to pretend like it never existed to begin with.<br><br>Anyone remember the PSP Go and HD DVD players?</br></br></br>  <br>A lot of things aren't hard, such as reading trap threads on /b/. That doesn't mean I waste my time doing them.</br>    <br>why would you buy one of these iwatches</br>    <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  How many figures get produced? Something popular like Saber, LL, or Mikushit. 10,000? Is that high or low?  Does anyone here even care about RAH?<br><br><br>An idol from idolmaster. Check amiami.</br></br></br>    <br> gay swordshit </br>  <br>I don't really know. Like I said above its a Stockholm syndrome effect. Now that I have it I don't want to get rid of it.</br>  <br>iwatches are cool.</br>  I want to skewer this boar.  <br>"care about" might be pushing it, but I'll definitely be buying that Senjougahara. Hope they make Bat.</br>  <br>She is a very pretty GK</br>  <br> so bent out of shape about figures of SD male characters and/or insecure about my heterosexuality that I had to post this two hours later </br>  <br>Scratch that. I hope they make Yotsugi. Doll needs to be made into a doll.</br>  <br>yuk, the breasts are too big.</br>  <br>I love my Miku RAH and I have the DX honey whip pre-ordered.</br>    <br><br><br>Hope GSC picks up that GK where she looks like Sagittarius. It really looks like something that would fit their WBH line perfectly.</br></br></br>  <br>I, too, would like to know this.<br><br>Mikushit never sells out, but stuff like anything groovegarage makes sells out within about four days.<br><br>And god knows theres more fags buying miku than there are fags buying folding shipping containers based off of various train companies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My dick</br>  <br>Mine too.</br>    <br><br><br><br>disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all fees get placed when you first make your purchase, and in addition, when you buy an item that costs enough (I think 6k+ yen?) one of the fees gets waived (I think the handling fee of ~500yen). I realized that when I bought a certain Soushuuhen from Manda once.</br>  <br>I've never seen that image before. The file name made me burst out laughing.</br>  Best place to buy bootleg Dakis?  <br>I have a Homu RAH that I never took out of her box. It's amazing. The box, I mean. Haven't looked at the contents.</br>  <br>Don't. It's like buying a bootleg figure.</br>  <br>Fong's Daki Emporium</br>    <br> Owning figures that you never take out of the box <br>for what purpose?</br></br>  <br>11s do it.</br>  <br>It's like purchasing cars to have them, but not to drive them.<br><br>Absolute shit. Unless it's a museum-quality piece of 1 of 20 or some shit, you should probably enjoy it.</br></br></br>  <br>I asked for what purpose not who does it.</br>  <br>What kinda amp is that?<br><br>I wish I could neatly tuck my drums into my room ;.;</br></br></br>  <br> wanting to be like them </br>  <br><br><br><br><br> Wants to be an 11 <br> Can't enjoy nice things <br><br>On track so far</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Decided to try the S&amp;W LN  <br>Faggot.</br>  <br> not wanting to be Japanese <br><br>Why are you here?</br></br></br>    What's the quality of using SAHRA on Mandarake? I want to order several figmas, but just want to be careful. I want to order multiple from SAHRA because they've got all the ones I want, easier that way.  <br>plastic butts mostly</br>  <br>The fuck's an 11?</br>  <br> and stay there, onegai.</br>    i neeeed the cuuuttee  Are people still posting their setups?  <br>fuck off already</br>  <br>Not like there's anything stopping you from posting.</br>  Do TNA and MB restock doujin with their bonus materials or is that just for preorders?<br><br>If I want stuff like that am I just forced to pay the premium domestic shipping.</br></br>  <br>Is this a closet?</br>  <br>Just ignore the faggot, he's just one of those that need attention.</br>  <br>What is the point of that wall?</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  DHL or EMS, shipping to the United States, which is better?  <br>Weak collection, weak room.</br>  <br>yeah I'm renting a small room in a house and had to make due<br><br>only big enough space to put my desk was in the closet</br></br></br>  <br>Support structure, presumably.

Why does he look so disappointed? I need context.</br>  <br>Then buy stickers until you get a better job.</br>  <br>before anybody mentions it, the chair is shit because a cat has had its way with it prior to me getting this chair.</br>  <br>Probably autism.</br>  <br>My face when I can't figure out how to filter pictures of that fucking collection.</br>  <br>I need to flesh out with more posters or something, walls are very empty, and having a 3meter ceiling isnt helping either.</br>  <br>Where did you get the daki?<br>It's obviously a bootleg but im interested in if you bought it or you had it printed.</br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>More specifically, missed the preorder for this. Do I just have to buy it used on Suru or Nago? Or will they restock if I spam refresh?</br>  <br><br>Its small and full of stuff.</br></br>  <br>They can't be that bad, can they? </br>  <br>nice resolution</br>  <br>Cluttered as fuck but thats okay.<br>Why is there a strip of bathroom in there though?</br></br>  <br>What is the deal with this ero manga?

Harem implies that they come back for more. Also, harem is vanilla as fuck.<br> and orgy <br>If by orgy, you mean the lite Japanese version where the girls take turns getting fucked, then yes. Still very vanilla.<br> and loli. <br>Nope, sorry. It's DEFINITELY NOT loli.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> apple watch <br>Would much rather get a tissot at that price point.

Proper fetishized exhibitionism involves the characters getting nude in places where they shouldn't be nude. I.e., the convenience store, the street, school - not the bathroom (or a Japanese onsen), or somewhere like a doctor's office. On a normal beach, people strip down to underwear-like clothing. Wearing even a swimsuit on a normal street is more of exhibitionism than being nude on a nudist beach is.</br>  anyone got any kotobukiya muv luv kits? im thinking about buying my first kit  from the muv luv line  and i don't know where to start.<br>pic related is the kit im thinking about getting</br>  <br>Go to /m/</br>  <br>You don't really need to argue with him.

She's in a skimpy bikini, but she's not blushing and has playful eyes instead of "fuck me" eyes. Misaka is totally in character here.

The lewd face is the reason I DIDN'T buy this daki, even though I will probably never get another chance to buy another Tomoyo daki.</br></br>  <br>People like you are what's wrong with this fandom.</br>  <br>And I thought most people here had shit taste.</br>  <br>Not him, but why are you here and not on Reddit? Just wondering since you seem to have this Reddit mindset and are getting upset at people who think you're stupid for it.</br>    <br>For the first time I agree with most of /a/, fuck lewds, I didn't buy her too for the same reason.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, anon.</br></br>  <br><br> I am a homosexual </br></br>  <br> most of /a/ <br> 2 people arguing with the rest of /a/ <br>You are pretty dumb to think comments like "i have kids" and "my wife wouldn't approve" are legit comments and not just poor troll attempts.</br></br></br>  I was so ready to buy this, then I noticed the pulled down leggings... ruined it for me.  <br>What reddit mind set? Are you retarded enough to interpret my comments as meaning that I am against anything lewd? All I'm saying is that  looks great because it's a little sexy but Misaka remains IN character.<br><br>Take for example, this other Misaka daki. I consider this a failure because she is so out of character. Rather than being aroused, it looks like she's having a heat stroke from being out in the sun too long. And if we are to interpret this as arousal, then it feels more like some old fuck artist just forced HIS fantasies onto the character instead of just depicting her as we all fell in love with her. That's not something I want to snuggle with or look at.</br></br></br>  <br>Just shut the fuck up, you huge faggot.</br>  <br>Not sure if retarded but that's not being aroused at all.</br>    <br>There's at least three of us.</br>  <br>She's embarrassed, which is completely in character. Not sure why you even see that as aroused.</br>  <br>No, you're just the same person samefagging.</br>  <br>Then why is she blushing? Are you actually autistic?</br>  <br>No but sounds like you are, blushing is also a sign of embarrassment, in fact, is way ore fitting for embarrassment than for arousal.</br>  <br>I take what I said back. You belong here. This is where autism belongs.</br>  <br>You don't understand WHY she's embarrassed, do you? You really don't...?<br><br>And no, that's not in character. Misaka doesn't let herself get into situations where she's submitting in that kind of clothing. She has the ability to electrocute any man who dared push her into that situation.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to kiss the rear side on the lips all night long.<br><br>I think you're gay.</br></br></br>  <br>Except there is a canon guy who does EXACTLY that, fucking Touman.</br>  <br>See: <br><br><br>I think you don't understand her character. How can you claim to love what you don't understand/</br></br></br></br>  I dont even like Saber but this figure seems great  <br>Did you even watch the series? You are describing Kamijou</br>  <br>I am not Touma and neither are you.</br>  <br><br>You're wrong. His autism is not /a/ is /jp/ as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Good, and it shows, she loves touma after all, not me nor you.</br>  <br>She's with YOU, and YOU'RE hugging her or rubbing your dick against her in a scenario where she is YOUR girl. <br><br>I don't think that's ever explored in the novels or manga, so sure. She can behave or be depicted however the fuck you want and have it be appropriate. <br>Dakis can express more than you think.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did Hinata come out so bad and the other girls good?</br>  Just got the email regarding the date. Delayed.  <br>There is a subtle difference between being flustered and submitting that I don't expect you to understand. But at least now, you've been told.</br>  <br>Dear gog you are as autismal as it gets.</br>  <br>The clothes as well as the poses are more in character than .<br>Misaka wears trunks under her shirt. Do you really believe she would lay there with a skimpy bikini and a inviting expression, without getting embarassed and trying to cover herself up?<br>That daki you posted also hs a stupid expression, but it's more in character than the other one.</br></br></br>  <br> She can behave or be depicted however the fuck you want <br>Now you just outed yourself as being on the same level as those people who masturbate to hentai on sites like xhamster, not knowing what's going on or what the title of the anime even is.</br></br>  <br>Not even close pal.</br>  <br>I think the black one only works with Tomoka so far, but even then pink looks better. Black might work with Saki.</br>  <br>If you were to preserve the canon facts and treat the daki as her character then she wouldn't even be there in the first place, not with you anyway</br>  <br>You're not even trying anymore.</br>  Misaka is used goods, more news at 11.  <br>What a retarded baseless correlation. <br><br>You can have your 'justifiable characterisation' dakis, and I can have my sexual fantasy dakis that also make me feel endearing emotions.</br></br></br>  <br>You're still not getting it. I bet you think that the expression depicted here depicts "smug," just like all the other autists on /a/ who can't get enough of the smugfu meme.</br>  Flailing Girl is up for preorder  I've been thinking about getting a daki for a long time. I think It's time that I bite the bullet and get one.  <br> promotional art </br>  <br>Way to use shitty fallacies pal.

These regions were even allowed to apply their own law to their own people (but the few Romans who did settle there fell under Roman law) and they didn't get Roman citizenship until the 3rd century.

So far Team Justice only scouted the battlefield a bit. They know about Flat, but don't consider him a priority. They know a bit about Rider, but are probably waiting to see what the state of things are before proceeding to act against it.</br>  <br>He probably couldn't. Not as a Rider, at least. I'm pretty sure the Pale Rider was already summoned by the time Flat accidentally summoned Jackserker, so the Rider class would be occupied.</br>  <br>Well, even Enkidu is afraid of birthday ghost and as a result even Gil is tad bit shaken up by the thought of if because Enkidu has "no weaknesses" other than a tendency to be "chased by death" or something along the lines of that. In this case, death is literally chasing Enkidu. Poor clay boy.</br>  <br>Laeticia, actually. Not that it matters to him, the list of things he wouldn't stick it in is assumed to be written on a grain of rice.</br>  <br> Is Pale Rider really that strong? <br>We don't know. Together with Tsubaki, they apparently work together in a way similar to the Grail. It's just a force that gives expression to her wishes. It has basic programming, so it's not mindless, but in itself it does not have any will or desires, it just interprets her wishes and acts accordingly. She herself is not quite aware of it, or even that she's participating in a war, since she's practically comatose and dreaming.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Sup anons. Just played Fate/Stay Night , HF and UBW VNs <br> &gt;HF and UBW VNs <br> what <br><br>He probably read the Fuwanovel version that split the routes into different programs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thought of Orlando sending in the justice League to even try and contain the rider situation is hilarious to me. They have been absolutely ineffective so far. I think it'd be a wise idea for Faldeus to do what Risei did in Zero to rid of caster and ask everyone to gang up on rider.</br>  <br> Everyone trying to gang up on some kind of weird metaphysical being who's also the very concept of sickness that keeps switching between reality and a loli's dreamworld <br><br>This is going to end with half of the cast dead, isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>That's sort of mandatory for any Grailbowl to finish.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>   It's time.   <br>The series is shit. I don't care.</br>  <br>Hated the show when it was airing.</br>  <br><br>Why is he even doing that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I liked it but it really doesn't make much sense at all without reading the side material and there's tons of that you'd have to find.</br></br></br>  <br>He has to out gay the other official art.</br>  ITT: Shows that /a/ lied to you about<br><br> It's g-g-good! <br> Gungrave is serious, but n-n-not edgy! <br><br>What I get is the gayest, most edgy show ever. Fuck you /a/. Not even trolling,</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not a fan of mafia type stories so it didn't resonate with me.  I don't like career criminals being displayed as people </br>  <br> People mainly remember Gungrave for the mobster arc <br><br><br>I hated that part. When I watched a Gungrave anime you know what I expected to see?<br><br>FUCKING GUNGRAVE!<br><br>you know the actual game about shooting the every fucking crap out of literally every fucking thing?<br><br>The anime over half a fucking series to tell something the game mentioned in a manual blurb</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hivemind <br>No, go away.</br></br>  <br> I don't like career criminals being displayed as people <br><br>If it's a realistic story then yeah I get this. It really does piss me off that EVERY single time you need to humanize some criminal scum you just give them some semblance of 'honour' or 'family'<br><br>Just because they don't kill women or children or something doesn't mean they're actual people, c'mon. It's like Dexter where the MC is a serial killer BUT he only kills bad people, it is just pussyfooting around what it's meant to portray: cold-blooded crooks.</br></br></br></br></br>  What's the reasoning behind this character design? Im curious /a/.  <br>When at home, she acts and speaks like a kindergarden student. Her brother sees her as she truly is.</br>  <br>She moves differently, she talks differently, she got no make-up on, and most of her body is hidden under that coat.</br>  <br>There's nothing to understand about this show. OP's question isn't even serious.</br>  <br><br>because the natural reaction to someone running around in a furry cape is to try your best not to look at it?</br></br>  <br>And that pool scene.</br>  Best S;G right here.  <br>You are correct. It is impossible to choose between these two.</br>  <br>When might this possibly happen? I guess I can wait if there is nothing else to be done.</br>  <br>Something will be announced at the end of July, probably at Otakon. We all here hope it's Chaos;Head NoaH.</br>  <br>It'll most prolly be announced at the end of the month.<br><br>But if you really can't wait, you can get ther glitchy-as-fuck unfinished fanpatched version for PC here:<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=2<wbr>73050</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I'm hoping for Dual.</br></blockquote>]
