Vegeta Goes on a Family Trip?!<br> Vegeta goes out with Bulma and Trunks to a resort area! Bulma and Trunks are very happy with this unexpected family time together! But even as he’s doing this, Vegeta is bothered that Goku is off training?! <br><br>RoF English Subtitle progress: http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Who is more pussy whipped? Goku or Vegeta?</br>  As disfunctional as Goku's family is, it's nice to see them together.<br><br>Can't wait for Vegeta's outrageous adventures</br></br>  <br> http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx <br><br>goku. He neede 100 million zenny for chi chi to let him train <br><br>vegeta just needs to do some family time</br></br></br></br></br>  Need more fanservice.  <br> streaming <br> constant general threads <br><br>DBZfags already the most cancerous fanbase of the season. I want Naruto back.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> All aboard the hype train!</br></br>  I don't remember Krillin being so short.  <br><br>too bad bulma is old now</br></br>  How the fuck did Freiza power up a trillion times by "training" for a month?<br><br> It works because I'm a prodigy <br> It works because I've never trained before <br><br>What the fuck Toriyama?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think this season needs some Goku and Chichi romance, cause Chichi is always up Goku's ass but there aren't really any sweet human moments between them lately.</br>  <br> I wish I was back in my training capsule taking a fat Saiyan shit </br>  I REALLY enjoyed watching the episode.  So did my girlfriend. <br><br>Really brings back that classic Dragon Ball feeling. Plus Goten is adorable.</br></br>  <br>When did Mr. Satan go DYEL?</br>  <br><br>That's because Bulma is rich and money means nothing to her. It's obvious that Bulma has more control over Vegeta than ChiChi has over Goku. Goku keeps abandoning his family whereas Vegeta actually raises his children and spends time with Bulma. Bulma even made him wear a pink shirt just to humiliate him.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully when the arc is redone in the series they will make it more clear how he was able to get such a huge power jump.</br>  <br> <br>odd</br></br>  <br> How do they even fuck </br>  <br>The pig is still a thing?<br>He should've been dead by now</br></br>  Is GT canon? Is this even canon?  <br>Why do you think he gets hot girlfriends? He's actually incredibly well hung.</br>  <br><br>You talking shit about my nigga Oolong?</br></br>  <br>No.Yes.</br>  <br> streaming <br> linking to streaming site <br> not linking to fansubber's website </br></br></br>  <br>GT is not canon.<br>GT had worse writing than the other series, and DBZ isn't exactly groundbreaking</br></br>   <br><br>GT not cannon<br><br>DB Super 6 months after Buu saga<br><br>Latest 2 movies are cannon but are being retold in the show, so i guess they won't be when the show catches up?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Vegeta actually raises his children and spends time with Bulma <br><br>By being the weaker fighter, Vegeta sought to surpass Goku and never realized he was the best on what really counts.<br><br>It's like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True. After Facing Cell one-on-one and saving those people like he did, his balls must be pretty fucking massive<br><br>It's a wonder how  he can fly with those things </br></br></br>  <br> dragon ball <br> streaming <br><br>Reddit please leave. Stop shitting up /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oolong has the coolest power and the biggest thing they do with it is make him turn into scissors</br>  <br>I wonder what Toriyama is going to do with SSJ4. Perhaps he'll keep it. . .or maybe he'll just act like GT never happened and leave it alone from there.</br>  <br> So did my girlfriend. <br><br>There's the door, normie.</br></br></br>   <br><br>Well I think saving the planet is pretty important too</br></br>  <br>SSGSSJ is SS4</br>  I liked the ED.<br><br><br>Well hello cancer. Who the fuck actually names himself "Anon"? God you're a fucking retard that doesn't even know what the word means. Fuck off somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br> that QUALITY  <br>TOEI!</br></br>  <br><br>The thing I don't get is why he had to go for the most ridiculous explanation there was. He just trained? How about a mysterious, ancient item that increases your power a thousand times? Or how about a genetic modification which allows Frieza to evolve further? Or how about him getting God Ki somehow?<br><br>There are so many possibilites, yet Tori went for the most implausible one. This cannot be a coincidence. I think he did it on purpose. He is trolling us.</br></br></br></br>  Working on making the part 2 sub file right now guys<br><br>let you know when there is a link up for it!</br></br>  <br>No, SSGSSJ is SSGSSJ<br><br>Pic related is SSJ4</br></br></br>  <br> So did my girlfriend. <br><br>No one cares. Fuck off,</br></br></br>  I can't believe i'm hyped for DB again.  <br>DB -&gt; DBZ -&gt; DBS -&gt; DBZ Ending -&gt; DB Online</br>  <br> I want Naruto back. <br><br>That's a lame joke. You should at least have said something more believable or at least, within reason or a realm of probability. It's not funny if it's so outlandish, that no one takes the bait or plays along.</br></br></br>  <br> Plus Goten is adorable. <br>You sure you're not the girlfriend, m8?</br></br>  <br>I thought it could be setting up a way for Uub to be relevant afterwards. If Freeza could get on the level of gods just by training, then Uub, who has Kid Buu's power, could become even stronger.</br>  Japanese sub is awful, but I am really tempted to download it because of hype. Fuck grandma Goku.  Ok seriously, neither CR nor Funi, and therefore HS, are subbing this? What the fuck? WHY?  <br>Vegeta.<br><br>Goku in the end does whatever the fuck he wants. If Chichi has a problem with it he'll just "accidentally" bitch slap her through the house again.</br></br></br>  <br> Dat salt  <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>Puereh did that.</br></br>  <br>Your daily reminder that Naruto is not a bad series, and certainly not worse than DBZ<br><br> It's just the cancerous fanbase over-hype that turns everyone off. </br></br></br>  <br>Its not bait. He is totally right. This thread is full of cancerous newfags and there are autists who make dumb dragon ball theads every fucking day just to ask a stupid question.</br>  <br>how do they grow those pants when they transform?</br>  <br> hype <br> Japanese sub is awful <br><br>Fuck off back to reddit.<br><br><br>You as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way Gotenks grows that vest when he fuses.</br>  <br>We need the clean version of this next week and add "All aboard the Hype Train" with flashing images.</br>  <br> blindly hating a particular run-of-the-mill shonen because of elitism <br><br>Naruto, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter X Hunter - they are all fundamentally the same.

The more people post the faster these newfuckers know the rules around here</br></br></br>  So I guess the last two movies never happened in Super?  <br>Fuck off faggot.</br>  <br>They're a function of the plot.</br>  <br>What's wrong with streaming though?</br>  Holy shit I was expecting the threads to be bad but not this bad.<br><br>This is way worse than all the Narutards threads combined.</br></br>  <br>No, you fuck off back to reddit.</br>  So...Is there anything bad about the AnimeRG subs?  <br>These kind of people will invade us for the 100+ episodes of DBS, better get used to this happening on the entirety of /a/</br>  <br>No, you fuck off to reddit.</br>   tripfags <br> streaming <br> general threads <br><br>So this is the season where /a/ die huh.

Goku didn't start his adventure when he was 10/11. Goku was fighting in his first tournament at around 12. What was Gohan doing? FUCKING FIGHTING CELL TO SAVE THE PLANET!

I'm not sure this is normie anime  <br><br>Explain your position. I'd legitimately like to know why you believe it to be shit.</br></br>  <br>Toei Europe listed it on their site as 100 episodes for a while, so it will be 2+ years of this</br>  <br>The signs were already there during those godawful 24/7 Yahari generals from last season.</br>  <br>But thats not what I said. You can talk about db without maknig threads every 5 minutes I know you are new to /a/ but its not that hard.</br>  <br>I'm still laughing at those BTFO hetfags</br>  <br>It pisses me the fuck off with people getting mad a Gohan and not viewing it from the humanistic point of view.<br><br>He is Half Saiyan so he does not care as much about fighting. Same with Trunks and Goten yet people give Gohan shit because he stopped trying as hard when he was the strongest.<br><br> Spend rest of my life training  <br> Happy life with pic related that will fuck you silly everyday  <br>Tough choice.<br><br>Even Krillin said fuck it when he got 18.

Go outside for a little bit.</br></br></br></br>  Wait, so there's no official subs, but there's a dub?<br><br>I'm so confused</br></br>  Really digging the SoL. I hope Beerus takes his time getting to earth so we can get at least another 3 episodes of SoL. <br><br>I especially want to see Krillin, 18 and Australkrebs. We have barely ever seen them acting like a couple (GT doesn't count).</br></br>  Just goes to show that the quality of a thread is inversely proportional to the faggotness of OP.  MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODS  <br>he turned into a pair of panties too didn't he?</br>   Reddit <br> Streams <br> Reddit <br> Subs <br> Reddit <br> tumblr <br> Reddit <br> Reddit  <br> Reddit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> act like a faggot <br> get called out for it <br> ''lol go outside'' <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can we please talk about the show again?  <br>if you're talking about RoF, no there are no official subs, but i'm working on some<br><br>was the last thread this shitty too?</br></br></br>  what the fuck happened to this guy?    <br>Can you please fuck off and kill yourself?</br>  <br>No, but you can always go to /r/dragonball !</br>  I go to Reddit AND 4chan therefor I have a more educated, unbiased and diversive opinion.  <br>Good work, Gohan... Good work.<br><br>Also I understand the transition but its only 6 months after Buu. Gohan and Videl are.. 19? Tops? Videl shed her action girl form really quick and Gohan went full GT real fast.<br><br>I was looking forward to Mystic Gohan transitioning to Scholar Gohan. Missed opportunity as he winds down.<br><br>Also, that dragon fist movie? I wanted to see them as some fuckin' Great Saiyaman and woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was teasing someone with aspergers. I'll be more careful not to upset you in future with default file names.</br></br>  <br>Replies!</br>    <br>I kinda like that explanation actually.<br>Frieza never learned anything. He just started out as the most powerful being around, never having to struggle against anything.<br>So he never learned to temper his natural strength. He only learned how to suppress it.<br><br>Also he seemed to be fond of assimilating other people's fighting techniques. Frieza makes mention of learning how to copy the Namek regeneration power at one point I think. So maybe he learned to copy the super saiyan power as well. That's why he goes all glowy like one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was just born, wasn't he? He's just a bit older than Pan.</br>  <br>DBS starts before the last episode of DBZ where Uub shows up.<br>so this is in between majin buu and that particular tournament.</br></br>  <br>he wished on the dragonballs to have special <br>panties<br>this Wish winds up creating the ONLY female Dragon in GT<br><br>he disguised as Bulma a bunch of times</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lol autism xD <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  Why battle shounen threads are always the worst?  <br>It really is. Fortunately there wasn't much Goku in this episode, but Trunks and Goten have some terrible voices as well.</br>  Now I see why people here didn't want Naruto threads  <br><br>No. You clearly don't know how /a/ works and should go back to whatever normie site you came from.</br></br>  Why is Goku using a tractor in the beginning? Didn't he use to plow fields with his bare hands to train?  <br>Pan and therefore Uub aren't born yet.</br>  <br>God GT sucked</br>   streaming <br>Sasuga DBZfag</br>  Who's subbing this decently?  <br>The Moonlighters</br>  <br><br>It's okay, the bad websites can't hurt you here.</br></br>  <br>Because it attracts the worst kind of people.</br>  <br>Do you think that's enough training for Goku now?</br>  <br> lol <br> xD <br> &gt;/reddit/ </br></br></br>  <br> archive screenshot </br>  <br>Its just cause the rest of /a/ realized how much fun we were having and decided to start the shit flinging. <br><br>Keep up the good work.</br></br></br>  <br>just why anon<br>you blew it<br>all this shitposting is because of u</br></br></br>  <br>I was wondering about that too. The best explanation I could come up with is that Chichi bought a tractor since Goku would never stick around to do the work himself.</br>  I fucking love shitposting.  <br>Dont see why not, doing pushups was enough for Frieza to be stronger than God.</br>  <br>If you got a gf you wouldn't be so bitter</br>  <br> a fucking stream link in the OP on fucking /a/ <br><br>And people say that Fatefags and Narutards are bad.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Your explanation makes sense, but his growth rate is still too ridiculous. If he can become stronger that fast, then why didn't he overpower Goku during their fight? Fighting a strong opponent should be considered training, after all. <br><br>Another thing I like to nitpick is that it was established that god ki &gt; all other ki. So how can Frieza challenge somebody with god ki without having god ki himself?<br><br> Frieza makes mention of learning how to copy the Namek regeneration power at one point I think. <br><br>I don't remember that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last few DBS threads weren't bad at all. I blame OP.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br><br>That sucks.<br><br>I'm rewatching the last couple episodes and would have liked to see Uub's training</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how you missed it, but Goku made those huge craters everywhere.</br>  <br>Freeza is naturally much stronger than Saiyans.</br>  <br>I think it was when he was fighting Nail after he rips his arm off.</br>  <br>  undisciplined internet habits <br>you are either a skinny fat manlet or a 200+ pound obese landwhale</br></br>  <br>She was one of the best parts of GT</br>  <br>They'll catch up eventually.</br>  <br><br>I want to know what kind of Japanese qualification OP has. <br><br>How do we even know he speaks nip?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto threads were full of deviantart/tumblr shit. They were just as bad.<br><br><br>I highly doubt that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>freiza was actually stronger after he got BTFO by goku. mecha freiza was stronger than 100% full power freiza but SSJ Trunks and even SSJ Goku were still above him.<br><br>the reason why freiza can train for 4 months and be stronger than god ki is because he is a freak of nature/toei handwaving bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> I highly doubt that. <br>I was there, check the archive.</br></br>  <br>And you are certainly not from /a/.</br>  how long is this going to be on the air for?<br><br>every sunday until it ends?</br></br>  <br>BON PARA PARA PARA BON PA PA</br>  <br>I miss old Videl.

Modern Videl is the eventual fate of every tsundere.</br>  <br>I was thinking of this, I remember the wish too though</br>  I want to be cucked by 18.  <br>forgot to attach the picture</br>  <br><br>The very fact that it's one of the most popular western series is probably the reason why it's not getting a simulcast. <br><br>Toei is likely charging either several magnitudes of gorillion dollars for the streaming rights or are outright refusing to sell streaming rights so they can manipulate supply/demand and maximize profits when they do export the series overseas.</br></br></br></br>  Season 3 when?   JC Staff <br>Hopefully never.</br>  <br>It's been five years, so we're approaching the "never ever" horizon.</br>  <br> Implying JC Staff aren't the Goat </br>  <br>Never and it's going to stay that way since it's garbage.</br>  <br>Railgun aired in 2013.</br>  daily reminder that half of railgun is fanfic of index created by some fat japanese nerd living in jc staffs basement  <br>Why does misaka look hella cute in this?</br>  <br>Fuck off secondary scum.</br>  Raildex is ded.  <br>And?<br>Prisma Illya is literally fanfiction, and it's still better than the actual source.</br></br>  <br>Because she's cute.</br>  <br>Misaka always looks hella cute.</br>  <br>Index is Cuter tbh</br>  <br>She's always cute, you dingus.</br>  <br>Index is neither cute nor sexually attractive. Worst girl.</br>  <br>Not him but she looks okay out of that dumb nun's robe. And someday she's going to be damn beautiful. See Laura.</br>  <br>She looks better in the anime than the manga/LN.</br>  To Aru was pretty popular 6 years ago, but it gets old really fast.

Which is disappointing, because the manga is great. <br><br>All of the characters feel so hollow in the anime adaptation compared to the manga, they made the main cast into keion-tier husks.

Only LO is because she is a loli.</br></br>  <br>No it's because of that ahoge.</br>  <br> They aren't <br><br>But they are. The dull eyes do wonders to an otherwise plain and boring design.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Touma always have that, "Durr, what the fuck is going on?" look on his face in screenshots when he's doing something with a girl other than punching her face in?</br>  <br>Railgun is more popular than index and makes more cash.</br>  <br>Only the first season was. Index II sold more than Railgun S.</br>    <br>bumping</br>  <br> The Railgun anime adaptation is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.  <br><br>You really haven't seen much anime have you? <br><br>Season 2 was great if you stopped watching after episode 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, give me more of both, but I prefer Index even with all the annoying magic shenanigans because I want more WW3.</br>  <br><br>Soon.<br><br>JC Staff is a great studio that won't let us down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's impossible now since the mediafire folder is also gone. Time to give it up anon, Ingun is garbage anyway.</br>  <br>They should have never changed the eyes.</br>  <br> questionable characters doing questionable things <br>Oh well, at least my favourite character didn't feed another favourite character of mine their own leg this time.</br></br>  <br>Most of those shows are literally shit on there. I like the shows they are adapting currently though.</br>  <br>All trash except for Azumanga.</br>  <br>I don't know how they gonna animate all the retarded shit that happened in the last third of OT.</br>  <br>Changing viewpoints every 15 minutes? Golden hands? I'm sure it won't be too bad unelss they decide to slideshow everything.</br>  <br>That helps too.<br><br><br>Mikoto's design is simple and plain, but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth. But also important is her fierce and..sparky personality that creates a bold contrast. On top of that, she generally acts cuter and childish, which enhances the moe-ness she produces. Her clones look her like aside from eyes and panties, but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. LO is an exception mainly for being a loli, and is even more childish in various ways that burst with endearment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to admit.<br><br>On some level, I am kind of wondering what kind of canon assassination Season 3 of Railgun will bring to the table.<br><br>I'm assuming a Railgun S3 would be like the first two, with the first half being a serviceable to stellar adaptation of a canon arc (I'm thinking Liberal Arts City), and the second cour will be Nagai's playground.<br><br>So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wake me up when they finally make an accel anime.  <br>Does Accel even appear in the Railgun manga other than the Sister's Arc?</br>    <br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>Time travel arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Added to my backlog.</br>  <br>He does get prodded by a Daihasei rep to advertise, but because said rep brought up the Sisters project, he ate a brick.</br>  <br>I think he's learned his lesson already</br>  <br>Index PSP did time meddling. Please no.</br>  <br> but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth <br>But she looks best when she's not in her base design.</br></br>  <br>Oh hello there, I was thinking that you'd never show up in an actual thread.</br>   There are people in AC who don't know Accel   <br>The first question, the oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.</br>  I loved Railgun but I am 10 episodes into Index and I am just not feeling it. Half of each episode is Touma yelling into a really bright light while holding his hand up and they never even developed a relationship between him and Index before shit started exploding. Touma has no motivation beyond "lol me so awesome save cute girl!" And all the pseudo-church babbling and HAHAMAGIC nonsense just feels cheap and stupid.<br><br>Or is Index a masterpeace and I am a tasteless faggot?</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Only reason to watch either show is for biri biri but she can only do so much by herself.<br><br> I prefer railgul </br></br></br>  <br>No, it is not. Railgun is much better.</br>  <br> but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. <br>And that makes their moments of childishness all that much more adorable.</br></br>  <br>Index II is a lot better, except for a few awful magic arcs.</br>  <br>Mikoto has worn many outfits. I would say her best is that tomboy outfit, the white dress she wore for the violin play, and the winter school uniform.</br>  <br>Where were you when they were all splattered dead on the floor?</br>  <br>Yeah you have to wait until NT4 to get the barest minimum of Touma development.<br><br>At all. And after  alternate universe genocide the subsequent effects are barely mentioned again.  </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br><br>MODS<br>O<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0vqHSWkiRwS</br>    <br>Touma is still a very boring MC.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's depressing. At least he isn't unbearable, though.</br>  <br>Now I really want a literal taste of Misaka too</br>  Shirou &gt;Touma.  <br>Accelerator confirmed Misaka doesn't taste that good.</br>  <br>Thinking "FUCK YOU /A/ YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS CUTE GIRLS SOLVING CRIMES."<br><br>You can call me an idiot for watching a series without knowing anything about it but I was not expecting that at all.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br>How many times do I have to report this guy?</br>  <br>Why did he chew on her fingers? Nigga is disgusting. Someone should snitch to LO.</br>  <br><br><br> eating Mikasa raw <br>The reason the Accelerator hated it was because the food was improperly prepared.</br></br></br></br>  Her vagina is pretty popular.  <br><br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>First half of S2 was Misaka trying to save girls from cruel experiments from the dark side, leaving her friends behind and falling into depression to be saved by Touma. Then the second half was Nagai doing the same arc but with power of friendship saving the day<br><br><br>If the first half of S3 is Daihaseisai, where Mikoto and a level 5 team up to fight against a crazy scientist who's objective is experimenting with them, going crazy and finally being saved by Touma; then the second half will be Nagai having Mikoto team up with a super special snowflake level 4 girl who's almost a level 5 (pretty much every other level 5 doesn't give a shit, Gunha doesn't look like Nagai's style and Misaki again would be too much) to fight another crazy scientist who wants to experiment with them, Misaka going crazy but this time is saved by a friendship speech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what LO is actually for, making him sedated enough to not go out of the plan</br>  <br><br><br>Alright who is this fag?</br></br></br>  <br>That pose is way hot.</br>  <br> Implying accel even eats good meat </br>  <br><br>The problem is, you go to Index for the worldbuilding. Touma himself is literally a blank slate and after a while you realize the harem stuff is a mere footnote played for laughs.<br><br>Since the anime has to cut down on tons of exposition you end up missing a lot of stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, it turns harem? Fuck that.</br>  <br> look at me I think everything is lame fuck you mom </br>  Only good male character in Index.  <br>Indeed. And as a further bit of note...<br><br>Don't expect any concrete, lasting romantic development of any kind in this series. Some of /a/'s most virulent shitposters started out as people who made the mistake of latching on to a "ship" in Raildex.</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right? Hamazura is the original cuck.</br>  <br>Kakine 2 and Accel aren't too shabby.</br>  Index is the best.  <br> Beetle good </br>  <br> to be saved by Touma <br>I hated that crap. I knew the whole time how it would end and it spoiled a good story. Misaka is doing great as the MC only to become a useless crybaby wreck waiting for the big strong man to swoop in and solve all her problems for her. <br><br>I was almost hoping they would make Railgun a parallel universe asspull so they could change that arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Index has a pretty shit adaptation that only gets decent once index's novels start getting good (around the end parts of season 2)</br>  <br>You must be a special kind of retard. You cite volume 5 as your source where he explicitly gets sexually aroused by Mikoto as she's helping him with his homework.</br>  <br> Shit taste </br>  <br> Telling other people they have shit taste when you're clearly the one with really bad taste </br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br> Index has a pretty shit adaptation <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>You missed the entire point of that arc. I bet you're also mad about Touma having to save her in Daihasei as well. You sound just like the idiots who get butt flustered every time she helps/saves Touma in the main novels.</br>    <br>Remove your faggot shipper goggles. He just got nervous because Mikoto was getting close. Nothing sexually explicit unlike getting turned on by Index's legs and natural aroma.</br>  <br>When Accel spammer  returns to us.</br>  <br>Telling the truth here.</br>  I prefer Index.<br>Magic &gt; Science<br>fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Will the new season cover this chapter?</br>  <br>No, since there will never ever be another season.</br>  Reminder that Touma was unable to punch biribiri. Thus she must be the Chosen One.  <br>It must have been fun seeing your favourite character spammed everywhere to everyone else's butthurt.</br>  <br>You don't know that.</br>  <br>But that's right. Citing an old post listing all the fuck ups of the second season.<br><br> Vol 7 - Sheol Fear, downplaying the strength of the nuns, removing the special way Agnese talks, downplaying Touma's entrance into the church. The only thing that didn't have any problems there was the last episode. <br><br> Vol 8 - removing the talk between Touma and Kuroko, removing Mikoto's ladde, removing LO revealing to Accelerator that she regained her memories, removing the scene were Mikoto knocks out Awaki's companions, the berserk Awaki scene didn't have disfigured appliances, making Awaki crash into a wall instead of a metal net fence, removing the scene where Accelerator yells at her while falling to the darkness of the ground (they made him say his speech while he was walking away), etc. <br><br> Vol 9-10 - Removing Himegami's monologue while she was down, shortening both games, QUALITY everywhere, more QUALITY, QUALITY fights, downplaying Touma's injuries and the way he figured out Oriana's attack patterns, downplaying Laura and Aleister's tense interactions, spell auras that make Touma look like an idiot, etc. The only thing they got right here is the Lidvia scene at the end. Oriana fight would have been good if they didn't have such QUALITY flashbacks. <br><br> Vol 11 - The entire 3rd ep. Rushed as fuck, and once again Touma's injuries were removed. They also didn't even hint at the long history between Venice and the RCC, and the nature of the guardian fleet and why it can't be dispelled by IB was not explained or even hinted at. Vento's scene with Matthai Reece was also shortened. <br><br> Vol 12 - My only complaint was that they skipped the scene between Touma, Tsuchimikado, Aogami and LO. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chosen for what?<br>His dick?</br></br>  <br>I do, I know everything.</br>  <br>Touma is the fucking MC of the universe though, and it makes perfect sense that he has to save her. Besides, Gunha and Touma vs Mikoto was great.</br>  <br> Vol 13 - First ep was rushed as fuck. Vento's attacks were also nerfed as fuck, the building she and Touma were fighting in had almost no people and it wasn't even close to collapsing. The Hound Dog's first encounter with Vento were also changed, making it hard to realize what was making everyone unconscious and removed one of Kihara's character traits. The Hound Dog massacre was not suspenseful enough, and it didn't highlight the fact that Accelerator was not in esper mode that whole time. They also skipped the conversation with the driver (removing characterization for the Hound Dogs) and shortened the conversation with Doc Frog, downplaying his experience, skills and importance. Second episode, Index's scene with the SISTERS was skipped, and also the way Index found out it was Kazakiri. Building toss was a joke, and the the wings didn't look like wings where you can see a clear division at the middle. Ahegao could have been better, and they skipped the hints that tell how Kazakiri was still fighting back against the control of the virus. 3rd ep, Vento's entire character motivation and the reason why she's using Divine Punishment in the first place was skipped, Touma didn't punch her nose, they didn't explain what the scales did, they fucked up the positioning in Kihara's office, they removed all the explanations that connect what the virus in LO is doing to Kazakiri to the Golden Dawn's method of creating an angel, and they didn't make the phone call scene as awesome as this. And then for the epilogue, they complete skipped Aleister's past, his plans regarding Accelerator, LO and Kazakiri, and Doc Frog being the co-founder of AC. The first scene there could also have been put in the place of the previous episode's ED. Then, they completely removed the open declaration of hostilities between the RCC and AC. I'm sure there's more that I didn't mention. </br>  Electric twin dragon biribiri attack fuking when?  <br>Beyond that: She punched him when he wasn't living his life correctly.</br>  <br>When you kill yourself</br>  <br><br>I want to adopt a clone Misaka<br><br>They're adorable, pic related.<br><br><br>because Touma is a shit character 90% of the time. Actually the only times he's tolerable is in Railgun.<br><br><br>index is just shit, don't worry about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't just save her, he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes and make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless. He solve in a few hours something Misaka spent days agonizing over. It cheapened everything.</br>  <br>I wonder why Accel didn't just partly nerf the effect that gravity had him, fly slightly to the right, borrow a building and introduce Kihara's face to a flaming building.</br>  <br> make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless <br>But it was pointless. Mikoto is useless as fuck.<br><br>No. She can't go against AC. She can't win against AC. She can't try to shoulder everything on her own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The death of accel-spammer marked the end of times when we had based mods.</br>  <br> he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes <br><br>the entire point of that arc was for biribiri to stop being such a fucking mary sue and to start relying on others. That 'few minutes' was the climax of that character development. He basically forced her to ask for his help. The plot of accelerator murdering the clones is just window dressing for the real point of railgun: misaka doing cute shit and generally being adorable. That plotline is continued in the next arc of railgun S, and that also ends in like 5 minutes with misaka and her hideously overpowered friends shutting down the science faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto was fucking useless in the sisters arc though, without Touma she was just going to die. Accelerator could beat her in his sleep, literally.</br>  <br>You actually watch Nagaispace bullshit? Her friends are useless as well other than Kuroko, and even she is far out of her own league most of the time.</br>  <br> hideously overpowered friends <br>Baseball bats are so OP.</br></br>  Othinus a shit. <br>Accel a best.</br>  <br>But she didn't even ask for his help, he basically said "You sit here while I go save everyone."</br>  <br>Othinus a best.<br>Frenda a shit.</br></br>  <br>She was the reason the team managed to stop mecha-bitch.<br><br>They'd all be dead if not for her.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what he is up to now.</br>  <br>Science side is hideously underpowered with the exception of Accel and Rensa. Dunno why the author favourites the magic side so much unless it's for the Deus Ex Machina that quite literally appears from thin air.</br>  <br>Sasuga Nagai's waifu.</br>  <br>Heard he got a degree in something and got a real job.</br>  <br>Sucks dude.</br>  <br>Having money is nice.</br>  <br>Yeah I thought it was OK.<br><br><br>Well I didn't mean all of her friends, Uiharu's power is RETARDED. I mean, keeping things warm? What the fuck? Couldn't it have at least been to grow flowers out of her forehead? that would have made sense. And saten is also relatively useless in a fight except in deus ex machina situations.<br><br>But I was referring to snake girl and kuroko, who are each OP as fuck. <br><br>Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. "Oh shit I teleported a window pane INTO YOUR FUCKING NECK". Also her army of clones is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JC Staff already said Raildun S3 won't happen until after Index III.</br>  <br>Sure, but think of the time he could be using to shitpost instead of working.</br>  <br>But only if you can obtain it with PLEASURING OLD MEN</br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. <br> no vectors involved <br><br>I had exactly the same thought after watching it. But could she be convinced to kill someone that easily?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't understand Touma character too well.<br><br>Also, Misaka is shit in this regard, she shouldn't be saving herself in those positions as well. She is incapable of doing so, she doesn't have the power or connections to do so</br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. <br>No, she can't.<br><br> Her teleportation isn't instantaneous movement. It's hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors. If teleportation were instantaneous and vectorless, Awaki and Kill Point wouldn't have gotten their asses kicked.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko, Onee-sama will wash your back if you kill the mean man for her <br><br>it's not like she's easily manipulated or anything.... she just wants  senpai to notice her </br></br></br>  Someone should really just nuke AC.  <br>It doesn't work that way....</br>  <br>He can shitpost at work, just not as a mod.</br>  For a long running series with a bunch of ability users, there aren't that many good fights.  <br> hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors <br><br>sure but if accelerator were able to interact with hyperdimensional vectors, he would be teleporting shit all over the place. He doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Accel can manipulate vectors, but he can't do shit like tping everywhere. His powers aren't capable of that</br>  <br> which does have vectors <br>Not within this universe which is where Accelerator lives and where his power has control. He shouldn't be able to manipulate teleported objects unless his power includes extra dimensional reach.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wouldn't be able to do it if he actually tried to.<br>Accelerator has pretty much infinite potential.</br></br>  <br>Manipulating vectors implies that he can manipulate movements - disassemble/reassemble atoms into components because electrons/neutrons/protons all have specific movements.</br>  <br> Not within this universe <br>In the indexverse, everything has vectors. The cunt could probably time travel if he got exposed to the 'vectors' for time</br></br>  <br>The author outright stated that Accelerator could reflect teleported attacks, or at least the 12th-dimensional movement that comprises Academy City esper teleportation. True vectorless teleportation is the domain of magic side powerhouses like Fiamma.</br>  <br>Almost everything in our universe has vectors too and in any case even cheaty shit like magic would have the person at least on some level producing bioelectric signals deciding where they are going to end up.</br>  <br>Within that extra dimension it does, but as far as our existence is concerned the objects don't travel anywhere, they simply arrive.<br><br>At least it should work that way, muh OPness demands Accelerator be unstoppable after all.</br></br></br>  <br>But when you think about it, it's kinda silly that the objects don't 'travel anywhere' and merely 'arrive' because the information for the object composition and memories or any other biological blueprint must have come from somewhere. <br><br>It's silly to make a character so OP in such a way that the use of the character's powers could exceed the bounds of the writer's imagination. <br><br>Index would be better as all science or all magic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a literal fucking retard <br>Read the LN's.</br></br>   these espers trying to fight motherfucking Accelerator   <br>Accel reflection works as a whitelist not a blacklist, he doesn't have to know how things works to reflect them.<br>He explicitly said he can reflect things moving through the 11th dimension, which is how teleportation works, while thinking about Musujime Awaki.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded because his reflection shield exists in the same dimensions that he does so unless he is a 11th-dimensional being it should never interact with anything traveling in the 11th dimension (which is the basic principle that allows esper teleportation to work in the first place)."<br><br>But I agree that I can't refute shitty writing, the writer has final say and I am wrong.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Artist starting to put some effort <br> Edgy kids shitting their pants as they get blown the fuck out by the edgemaster <br><br>This manga finally got fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a 11th dimensional being, but apparently his power works on more than just the physical dimension, during his first fight with Kakine he propagated his vectors through the ream of God or something like that to hit him for example.<br>But I agree, Accel power is pretty bullshit.</br></br>  <br> try to be edgy as shit <br> the edgiest fucker in raildex pops his head in just to scare them straight <br>nice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The absolute undisputed king of edge.</br></br>  <br>The undisputed king of Edgy Large Ham.</br>  <br>S2. Watch for Sisters Arc. Be happy. Do whatever you want from there. The rest of the series is pretty meh if you don't like it already.</br>  <br>I don't know, when you kill over a hundred clones I think you're just a serial killer. Edgy is more when you can't back it up, or you put on a trenchcoat and not the same shirt pugsly from the adams family wear.</br>  <br>Read the manga, the anime is a disgrace in comparison.</br>  <br>Well Accel is quite literally Shadow the  h Edgehog who hasn't lost Maria.</br>  <br>I want to violate Saten.</br>  <br> Asphyxiation is my fetish. </br>  <br>proof that touma could kill biribiri</br>  <br>That's only because MIkoto allowed him to.<br><br>I wonder if it's her fetish.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot, reminder that this scene was replaced by Nagai with a Saten scene in the anime.</br>  <br>You have no idea how dimensions work. You don't "travel in the 11th dimension". You travel in 11-dimensional space.<br><br>You have no idea how teleporters work. Teleporters aren't "11-dimensional beings".

The JSDF is one of the best equipped armed forces in the world that rival many actual militaries. Their new Izumo class helicopter carriers can accomodate F-35b's but Japan has been very hush hush about it because they're treading a thin line between self defense force and a military with force projection.</br></br></br>  <br><br> GATE: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri <br><br> The military fantasy series begins when a gate appears in Tokyo's Ginza district sometime in the 21st century. From the gate pours out monsters, knights from middle-age Europe, and other fantasy-like beings, and they kill many of the citizens of Tokyo. This event is known as the Ginza Incident. <br><br> The government sends a small group of soldiers from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (a replacement for Japan's military) to the alternate world beyond the gate. Led by otaku soldier Youji, they find that the villages in the world are being attacked by a dragon. An elf girl who is a survivor from the dragon's rampage joins the group in their travels across the dangerous new world. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku Art Online</br>  <br> this new </br>  <br><br>That's right, Oni-san<br><br>Nippon's army is truly the strongest.

Like i'm getting real good vibes because it's not virtual bullshit<br><br>Of course /a/ will funpost it like every anime every season but I like funposting too so it's okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't, you just have shit taste and also prove it by using the elf meme</br>  <br>Wrong. The Roman knights flood the streets and killed a bunch of civilians when they first come out, but as soon as they organize a counter-attack they fucking slaughter the fools.</br>  <br>it happened in middle of the city. military generally aren't ready to react to that. as bases are usually built far away</br>  <br>More like the author needed to invent an enemy with ~2 millennia worth of technological handicap so the Japs could win against something.</br>  the show later turns in self insert otaku bait like sao ? becasue i liked the concep of the first episode  Bait: Thus the anions fought there.  <br>just try some chapters of the manga and you will get what is this about.</br>  <br>No. The Gate magna is way different. It's not even that much of a harem, if it is one at all.<br><br>Goth loli is over a hundred years old and is about to "ascend". Sorcerer and him are not the least bit romantically involved. <br><br>I can kinda forgive the lack of gore and violence seeing how the first battle is more less skimmed over in the first chapter, but if they take it out all together, I'll be upset. Same if they censor the nudity, slavery aspect, and not bring up the corruption.<br><br>Other then that, I can't wait for them to bring out the fire sticks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the sluttier look the anime gave her more.</br>   pig enemies <br>By themselves</br>  <br>It matches how slutty she is in the manga, I like it too.</br>  <br>Harem?</br>  <br>Kinda. Only one of them wants to fuck him, the others are filling the roles of daughterus and/or war buddies.</br>  <br>Which one is the romantic pair. The blonde girl?</br>  <br>The goth loli.

I'll keep that in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you are confusing Japan with France</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>All of these, Don't watch it, its like that dungeon girls show from last season cept with more asshole dirtbags and rapists males with MC being the only decent guy around, even tho he's a fucking 30 plus year old virgin.</br></br></br></br></br>   One day in the 21st century, a gate opened in the middle of the Ginza district of Tokyo. Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people. <br><br> They're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world. <br><br> also an otaku </br></br></br></br>   tfw   you enjoyed the first episode of Gate despite its flaws and look forward to future episodes   <br>ebin meme right there.</br>  sure is /pol/ in here. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to enjoy the show alone and avoid the threads. Elf girl is best girl until a dark elf turns up.  <br>There's a dark elf you'll like if you're into literal whores</br>  How come dark elves are always slutty massive whores?<br><br>How did this become a thing? When was the unanimous vote for this?</br></br>  <br>Why does an elf wearing jeans up the hotness by like 100?</br>  it seems MC has no problems with fucking the girls from his team, he has considered multiple times in his head when others imply he has already done it.  <br> 2D elves are usually like this <br>Only because Japan forces their gyaru shit logic on everything</br></br>  <br>No<br>Also No.<br><br> Episode 1 literally chapter 1 <br><br>How will it ever last when "nothing happens", the first episode?

This is like showing a US Military briefing and cutting the US flag because a bunch of mudslimes bitch. Why can't China and Korea just fuck off with their butthurt.</br>  <br>It was clearly cropped that way by whoever took the screencap and made the image. Unless the streaming site is so stupid they even cut off their own watermark.</br>  <br>CR did.</br>  <br>But there is US Army in this series<br>You can tell because the only country with black men among their agents is America</br></br>  <br>The elf is well feed from additional protein.</br>  <br> Russia <br> China <br>Black agents</br></br></br>  <br>Because the only countries in the world are America, Russia, China, and Japan right?</br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/kaigai_no/a<wbr>rchives/45416875.html<br> 以下、AS、MAL、Reddit、4chan、YTより引用。(CRで<wbr>公式配信中です。) </wbr> <br> not translating the shitstorms <br>What a waste.</br></br></br></wbr>  So...are we going to be seeing this in the anime?  <br>why the heck would minor powers be meddling</br>  <br> But there is US Army in this series <br>Incorrect, the only US forces shown in the series were CIA SAD Operators</br></br>  <br>Why would any other country try anything? They're the big ones.</br>  <br>I say US army, not BLACK ops</br>  <br> You can tell because the only country with black men among their agents is America <br>Yes, it may be Uganda or Nigeria, kek</br></br>  <br>Nope, CR actually cut the JSDF flag from the scene, you can see it your self. 18:31 mark on HS, 18:41 mark on the Ohys raws.</br>  <br> Watch episode 1 for the waifus <br> like 10 seconds worth of waifus <br><br>T-thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uganda or Nigeria <br> implying   they're expert enough to train some niggers to be a professional black ops </br></br>  <br><br>GB and France would meddle for sure.<br>And so would the jews, they meddle in everything.</br></br></br>  <br> the only US forces shown in the series were CIA SAD Operators <br><br>I don't mind the YAMATO DAMASHII but this fact is the one thing that makes the series full retard. Omitting the US military presence in Japan is more retarded than the premise of a magic gate to the elf-loli dimension.</br></br></br>  <br> And so would the jews <br>But America was already there</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish.<br>We knew the threads would be like that but it's getting awful.</br></br>  <br>Yes, comparing everything you don't like to something everyone shits on, has been around since forever.</br>  <br>Name? Sounds cool</br>  <br>Come on, I like story like this when the superior modern forces crush the inferior one. Then, you spout your cynical bullshit.<br>Holy shit, this is the first time I'm on this anime's thread, it really reeks of /pol/, huh.</br></br>  <br>Confirmed, new screenshot without streamshit.<br>Anybody want to take up the mantle of muxing CR subs onto Japanese raws?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck. CR isn't even streaming that show in regions offended by that flag.</br>  <br>#HeritageNotHate</br>  <br>So did the studio do this to the version they sent to CR because of the confederate flag drama or did CR do it themselves?</br>  <br>you could just download the subtitle file from somewhere.<br>thats what i did.</br></br>  <br> implying Japan even heard about the confederate bullshit happening </br>  <br>Nobody cares about the confederate flag thing outside the USA</br>  <br> confederate flag drama <br><br>It's not like that particular Japanese flag design carries particular weight with it, no sir.</br></br></br>  <br><br>More than likely they were just being extra cautious to avoid butthurt koreans and chinks in the US and Vancouver from bitching about it.<br><br><br>I'm not bothered enough by it to go through the hassle. It's still silly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If find it quite amusing that you can't wave a confederate flag in some state but a nazi flag is totally ok.<br> Not that I'm complaining </br></br>  <br>I was just gonna say, 5000 hours in GIMP</br>  <br>I don't know koreans hate Japan</br>  <br>You can still wave the Confederate flag around anywhere in America, just like the Swastika, or the Hammer and Sickle, it's you're right under the Constitution as a free citizen. The problem was that it was being flown over state government buildings by said state government, which is a problem for all sorts of reasons.</br>  <br>You didn't go to school?</br>  <br>Take the stars out, and then more people will be offended.</br>  <br> which is a problem for all sorts of reasons. <br>but its actually not.</br></br>  <br> Invaded and conquered by Japan for almost 50 years <br> During which the Japanese tried to erase their culture and committed a number of atrocities <br>Pick up a history book once in a while anon.<br><br> That said most Koreans you meet don't actually hate Japs, but there are a good number that do, and larger number that will bitch about anything that might be associated with the Japanese Empire during the 20th century. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's possibly the studio doing it.</br>  <br>My country did the same to most of Europe, yet no one is butthurt.<br>Fucking Koreans.</br></br>  <br>It is, aside from the fact that it represents slavery, oppression, and bigotry to a large amount of the population, there's also the fact that technically it can be considered a flag of rebellion against the US government as well as the flag of a foreign nation. Government buildings should not be permitted to fly it.</br>  <br> She had her chance, she choose revenge instead. She could have walked away, she did not. <br>Any chance it becomes different here in the anime? Lots of characters get to live even with the gravest of sins.</br></br>  <br>Are you a Mongol or Roman.</br>  <br>Why did they replace the JSDF flag with the French flag?</br>  <br> white flags <br>My sides.</br></br>  <br>Shut up Germany, you banned your one of your own fucking flags and an entire political ideology because everyone was so butthurt about it, and if you think Russians, and most other eastern euros aren't still mad about it you're deluding yourself.</br>  <br>Nah, it's Japan's equivalent of an American war movie.<br><br>Wanking over how cool we are and how we're totally better than everyone else and those guys are just nerds and wimps and jealous.</br></br></br>  <br>That's nothing compared to this one country. They bombed two of their cities and won the war. Yet they bitch about a chinese cartoon where they lose badly.</br>  <br>So they're french on the CR version.</br>  <br>Is there a Bait image of this yet</br>  <br>Don't poke the Germans about WW2, you know they can't respond without getting arrested for thought crimes.</br>  <br> Napoleonic Europe, but everyone forgot about it already </br>  <br>Everything pre-TV and Radio no one gives a shit about.<br><br>And really Nappy didn't go around committing genocide  unless it was his own troops </br></br></br>  <br> Invaded and conquered by Japan for almost 50 years <br><br>See, this here is the misconception that so many people see to have, and many S.Koreans seem to believe. <br><br>This NEVER happened. Japan invaded China and took over Manchuria, yes. But they did not take over Korea by force ever. <br><br>Korea was a vassal state to the Chinese, which Japan was in conflict with. The Japanese recognized Korea as a sovereign state, and convinced them to join their side and secede from China. <br>Japan fought China off to keep Korea independent, while plotting to convert them into THEIR vassal state. <br><br>So there you have it. I'm not saying Japan didn't have nefarious reasons for splitting Korea off from China, but "invaded and conquered" is a blatant lie. Historical bullshit that never actually happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This was probably aimed at the Murican audience because of all the butthurt the announcement got.</br>  <br> I like the sluttier look the anime gave her more. <br>I also like her adult slutty voice. She is suppose to orgasm when she kills people, I would look forward to her moans.</br></br>  Tyuule got her husbando, why did she have to die. Happy monster woman should be happy with husbandos<br>;_;</br>  <br> Everything pre-TV and Radio no one gives a shit about <br>Some latinos still butthurt about my country.<br> muh genocide <br> muh gold </br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF melon tits chick &gt; Goth loli &gt; Mage Slut &gt; Elf. <br>fixed.</br></br>  <br>Wait who's the husbando?</br>  <br>Is that the bunny queen or the waitress</br>  Best waifu, move along untermensch  <br> How come dark elves are always slutty massive whores? <br><br> How did this become a thing? When was the unanimous vote for this? <br><br>They are meant to be the opposite of woodelves. There are diverse fetishes out there, wood elves aren't enough to please everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny Queen.<br><br> Apparently the waitress got together with the guy she tried to kill, and ended up together with him in Japan. <br>So says the novelfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it seems MC has no problems with fucking the girls from his team, he has considered multiple times in his head when others imply he has already done it. <br>That's because he is divorced and know what a vagina looks like. He just doesn't want the hassle.</br></br>  <br>She had the choice to run away  with her love Furuta, but she chose to pursue her life-long revenge instead. <br>This decision cost her life. </br> <br><br>It was sad because she just found love for the first time, was acting like a little girl from this new-found feelings, but it was too late for her.</br></br></br>  <br>hmm... i like the manga art more.</br>  <br> Not reading the /ak/ scans <br><br> Elf girl thinks the MC is her dad because she can't get over the fact that her pops is dead.  <br> The United States and China actively try to fuck things up when they return for R&amp;R.  <br> The MC is still friends with his ex-wife, who writes dojiuns. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny queen getting raped by duckbill prince right now.</br>  <br>Hope we get to see more of her in the manga.</br>  <br>Then who is the husbando? The prince? I know he ended falling in love with her, but he deserved to die.</br>  <br>All the stuff you're talking about is pre-1910, after the annexation treaty in 1910, Korea officially became part of Japan after which it was subject to military occupation and colonization. It may not have been a hard invasion with pitched battles, but it was an invasion.</br>  <br> /ak/ scans <br> horrible scans <br> horrible editing <br> horrible grammar </br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean high elves, typically. Wood elves are usually portrayed as brash and violent.</br>  <br>A colonization of an already puppet state is not invasion, anon. <br>I'm not saying it's any better, but the choice of words are completely wrong.</br></br>  <br>Considering that the other scans were even worse, beggars couldn't be choosers.</br>  <br> virgin <br>he's divorced anon.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck no. Not the prince. It was a JSDF.</br>  <br>The chef. Furuta. <br>The one that is now a spy at the Prince's kitchen.</br></br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br><br>Fuck, I forgot about him. I think I should read the manga again now that the series started.</br></br>  <br>Depends on how much you want to argue semantics, lots of people consider a colonization backed by military force of arms an invasion, just ask the Native Americans.</br>  <br>Not the same at all. Native Americans were slaughtered by the white men. <br>Japanese did NOT slaughter Koreans. Ever. <br><br>Treated like shit? Yes. Like a second hand citizens? Yes. Tried to educate them to become Japanese? Yes. <br>Slaughtered? No. Not even a choice of semantics, it simply did not happen. <br><br>They slaughtered the Chinese. Not the Koreans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then again, the swastika flag technically wouldn't even count as one of our flags, considering the country was basically re-founded with east and west germany being a thing for quite some time before being reunited.<br><br> And Stalin killed more of his own people than Hitler killed throughout the war, if anything they should be pissed about themself first and foremost. </br></br></br>    <br><br>And me!</br></br>  <br><br> mangafox </br></br>  <br>Amen.</br>  <br>Quads speak the truth</br>  <br>This is the part where i knew rori was going to be the worst fucking character in the manga<br> effortless beats not one, not two, but 3 fucking special forces groups like they were a bunch of boy scouts with pea shooters <br> not to mention the JSDF effortless fuck up American SF with that japan stronk shit </br></br></br>  I just wanted all bunny girls to be happy.  <br>She wouldn't be able to do shit against those who knew what to do? Spec ops were too close in range for her</br>  <br>She's a demi-goddess, what did you expect.<br><br><br>I just all the monstergirls to be happy</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stalin killed more of his own people than Hitler killed throughout the war <br>This is a myth that was spread as a part of information warfare during Cold War. It kinda stuck because US won.<br>Now, Mao did kill more chinks than nips did in Nanking.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too.</br>  Basically, <br><br> <br>Tyuule plots to antagonize Empire so Japan will get finally get their ass off the couch and hit them hard, as her goal is to bring end to the Empire. <br><br>But she gets very close with Furuta, the Chef. She even learns of him being a spy (he's pretty much incapable of lying, a horrible choice to send in as a spy) but keeps it a secret. She finds herself more and more attracted to her, and acts like a young girl in love for the first time around him. <br>Furuta also finds her attractive, and wishes her to come with him to Japan and open a restaurant together. <br><br>Ultimately her vengeance gets better of her, and rejects Fufuta's offer, and chooses to see her plan to the end. <br>The Prince finds out about her schemes at one point, beats her and rapes her, but doesn't kill her. He really can't bring himself to kill her, but as he faces ultimate defeat in the end of the conflict, she finds the chance to finally kill the prince. <br><br>She is successful, but he kills her as well. <br>As she dies, she hallucinates that Furuta, her true love, has come to take her away. <br><br>Fututa escapes to Japan as the Gate closes, and hires Deliah (the bunny girl waitress who is now Yanagida's waifu) as his waitress instead. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>Triple dubs says it all</br>  <br>So you expect the special forces to just shoot a random goth loli holding an axe? They'd be confused as fuck m8, then that'd lead to the other people getting confused as fuck because of the radio chatter.</br>  <br>It didn't have to end like this.</br>  <br>what's wrong about it anon? you must be american hence you feel offended somehow.<br><br>You forgot to mention how Rori was actually hit several times but IS a demigod.<br><br>While I do agree it was farfetched how Japan took care of the americans, you have to realize that, the japanese knew someone would pull off something like that, also, they are at the home turf so they have the advantage, and third, the americans themselves said that the missions was thrown in too quickly and they didn't have proper intel.<br><br><br>did you forget she is a demigod? she should have been dead, but survived due to her status</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That logic is retarded. The soldiers shot her full of holes, she just didn't give a fuck because she's an immortal superhuman. Itami even walks in on her while she's showering and sees her body regenerating.</br></br>    <br>FUUUUCCCKKK</br>  <br> infuriated that a 950+ year old demigod took on your HOMEBOYS WITH GUNS and owned them <br> being this butthurt  <br><br>OOH SAY CAN YOU SEEEEEEE</br></br></br></br>  WHERE'S THE NEXT CHAPTER GODDAMN IT  <br> what did you expect <br>Oh idk, for some fucking modern day warriors to turn that little loli slut into swiss cheese. Theres no way all those years of intense training would make them that incompetent. Not to mention SOCOM wouldnt sent out any teams without proper intel on their enemy. Those guys in the manga basically went in blind.</br></br>  <br>RETCON WHERE!?!?!?</br>  <br>Damn, that's rough.</br>  <br>Exactly. There's no better scouts than the one rolling in armor.</br>  <br>SHE'S A BLOODY DEMIGOD</br>  <br><br>You have to take her out with something other than mere bullets. Explosives, stun her with flash grenades. She's too used to bullet tier pain.</br></br>  <br>holy shit you are a faggot</br>  <br>Cry more murrican</br>  <br> Gate closes <br>What's the point of joining JSDF if there are no more monster girls?</br></br>  <br>She can't die you fucking wanker bullets do nothing</br>  <br>This needs retconning</br>  <br>Can she survive  hugs? </br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>what about britain?</br>  <br>Bring her back with you. That's what some guys did.</br>  <br> One of the girls gets the ability to open the gate though it takes 4 years to find the same world again. </br>  <br>To busy dealing with muslims in there yards</br>  <br>Civil war raging through Europe, most likely.</br>  <br>There's was only one true american in that group, the one that was worried about his dead bros. There we're following orders but they deserve what they got. <br><br>I mourn for the Ruskies though.</br></br></br>    <br>i didn't know that ukrainians and/or canadians browsed /a/</br>  <br>in during pedos defending their shitty pedobait character</br>  <br><br><br>What do you think would happen if someone cut Rori's head off? Would she die then? Or would she grow another one to replace it? Or would her head keep talking while her body wanders around aimlessly trying to reattach it?</br></br></br>  They handled that last scene like shit<br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eal<wbr>4fep7pK4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She explains that any lost body part would eventually come back to her.</br>  <br>but they replaced the rising sun with your flag in </br>    <br>she has to be put back together.<br>i dont think they have mentioned what happens if you completely destroy a body part though.</br></br>  <br>What if that body part is destroyed?</br>  <br>lmao 10/10 upvoted.</br>    Prince Zorzal is responsible for: <br><br> <br>- Genocide of the Bunny girls whom he slaughtered and enslvaed as sex slaves<br>- Decieved Tyuule that he will save her people if she becomes his slave, but doesn't keep his promise<br>- Raped and enslaved Noriko, a Japanese civilian<br>- Abuses his sex slaves, bloodying them daily, dragging them in chains, etc<br>- Revoltes and takes over the Empire<br>- Sends in men to disguise themselves as JSDF and pillage and rape villages<br>- Sends in shapeshifitng monsters disguised as children to ambush JSDF from inside, killing many refugees and children in the process<br>- Have his inquisitors torture and kill nobilities involved in the peace treaty<br>- The above leads to murder of Sherry's parents, and orders his men to kill the girl as well<br>- Sends assassins to kill his own sister, in the process killing seveal named characters (Pina's girls)<br>- Kills Tyuule<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Not sure I forgot anything, I probably did. <br>Like I said in the previous thread, this guy is basically Joffery Baratheon of this series. <br>You know, "that guy" that everyone hates with passion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The surrender meme is my favorite meme of all time above pepe and doge</br>  <br>Why is everything in this story so fucking depressing?</br>  <br> This is a myth that was spread as a part of information warfare during Cold War. <br>Depends on whether you count the Holodomor and whether or not you trust the declassified Soviet document to have accurately recorded the numbers ( I really don't know why you would though), you can reasonably push Stalins number up to around the 20 million mark, while Hitler it's hard to push his numbers past 12 million.</br></br>  <br>Because war, war never changes.</br>  <br>You have me at genocide</br>  <br>War, war <br>SHIT<br>uh, War is hell</br></br></br>  <br>You're describing most of /a/.<br>It should be even easier for self insertion now.</br></br>  <br>To be honest this only makes me angry because she's a bunny girl, if she were human I wouldn't care that much.</br>  <br>Bullshit, war HAS changed.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=C2P<wbr>t-LnQ2po</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>thats one hard ass nigga.</br>  <br>but it's not the flag of a foreign nation (it's was a battle flag though</br>  <br> it's hard to push his numbers past 12 million <br>Not counting the gorillions of course.<br><br><br> Nothing wrong </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the author don't retcon this I'm gonna rage with the force of a thousand rustled gorillas</br>  <br>There's a LOT of similarities to Joffery, they are both a Prince, they are both a coward, they are both complete morons full of pride and confidence in themselves, and both are despicable as they come.</br>  <br>"Destroyed" is pretty vague. I'm pretty sure her cells would just reform and come back together—it's fucking magic that keeps her body in the same state, so I imagine even incineration is something she can recover from. Maybe.</br>  <br>A true fucking monster.</br>  <br>The novel has been heavily retconned when he practically rewrote the series for published novelization. <br>In the original web version Princess Pina is an antagonist, who goes insane towards the end and tries to kill Lelei. <br>She's been rewrote to be one of Itami's heroines. <br><br>It was a lot more grimdark with more characters dying. Hell Itami nearly kills himself in the end from sheer despair.</br></br></br></br></br>  I really honestly don't understand the hate a lot of you seem to have for this show. <br>The first episode was fine and it sets up the main character/events to come well enough.<br>I can understand if you already disliked the manga or something, but its honestly just a fun fantasy/military series.<br>I really hope every gate thread won't be bogged down to shit, otherwise /a/ won't be overly enjoyable for me. Plus I feel like the only other shows I'm gonna watch, Ushio to tora and prison school gonna get the same treatment.</br></br></br>  <br>i wanna read the original now.</br>  <br>Pls tyuule, live</br>  <br>But the MC is an "OTAKU XDDD"</br>  <br>We need another chapter dedicated to people beating the everloving shit out of him.<br><br>What a piece of trash.</br></br></br>  <br> I really hope every gate thread won't be bogged down to shit, <br><br>It has been called for since its announcement.<br>There's no escape.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So?</br>  <br>That's a fucking pain. I just wanted civilized discussion. I've been hyped for this shit since announcement.</br>  <br>That and replace one person with an entire nation.</br>  <br>It's Outbreak Company, but from the army perspective.</br>  <br>Just enjoy the ride and see the threads burn.</br>  <br>whys the background a austrian flag?</br>  <br>The rising sun as a background would be offensive anon.</br>  <br>And with a bearable MC.</br>  <br>Please tell me that at the very least  her people become aware that she didn't abandon them and that she tried to save them all. <br><br>She did some nasty stuff in the name of vengeance, but she doesn't deserve that. Let her at least have some closure.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>yeah but we kinda own the Earth <br><br>We are a superpower Japan is a demilitarized (by us) island nation with a low birth rate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> low birth rate <br>You'd have a low birth rate without blacks, spics, and mormons.</br></br>  I'm going to make a mental tally of every monster species they show in the anime.  <br>Cuz shit like dis.<br><br> Not propaganda </br></br></br>  <br>As far as I remember, no. <br>No one knows of what sacrifices she made, and that she never betrayed her people.<br>I don't remember if she told Furuta though, if she did perhaps he'll tell Delilah.

We actually wanted to get rid of it by the 50's since we wanted Japan to be a major ally in the Far East, but they stuck with it since they felt it protected them from the majority of the US-Soviet power plays and allowed them to focus on economic matters. The only reason the JSDF is as big as it is now is because we've been twisting Japans arm about it for over 30 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Post the source. <br>I can read moon, and 竿尾悟 竹島 brings up nothing. <br>You're gonna need some serious hard evidence.</br></br></br>  <br>Pure Nationalism at it's nippon finest.</br>    <br>to him</br>  <br>i think he means the illustrator for the manga. i can't find the picture, but ive seen it in previous threads</br>  <br> Japan <br> nation historically known for having shitty military technological levels in anything not related to the Tanegashima <br> users of tactics that are extremely unsound and generally only worked because they only fought other Japanese (don't forget how buttfucked they got when Hideyoshi tried to invade Korea) <br> got shitstomped by the IS when we actually focused our full attention on them and weren't fighting a 2-front war <br><br> France <br> historically has given us some of the best generals <br> developed tactics for fighting basically every different kind of european power <br> has always been on the same military technology level as everyone else at the top <br> the Maginot Line only failed because Belgium were shitheads and wouldn't play ball and build their share because "how could they EVER go through Belgium" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Japan is a demilitarized (by us) <br>Japan made Article 9 by their own you underage git.</br></br>  <br>I had to wipe my HDD recently, so I haven't got it saved any more, but I'm sure there's an anon about who can post it.</br>  <br>Who's that in the back behind Rory?</br>  <br>yeah buts 5¢ is special</br>  <br>The Dark Elf?</br>  <br>When is this?

I refuse to date guys who are into anime.<br><br>No, seriously.<br><br>All you are are either fat fucks or skinny meek faggots. You have no backbone, no impulsiveness about you, no desire to change yourselves, no aggressive or assertiveness and you think just because we like anime too we should suddenly fall into your arms. Can that stupid pipe-dream, we'll take a normal guy with a variety of interests (and yes, that may include sports - if he's athletic himself all the better) over a guy who is obsessive about anime any day of the week.<br><br>Personality wise you are either morose and lazy or 'intellectual' and pretentious. There is nothing down to earth about you whatsoever. The former likes to use his apathy as an excuse not to do anything and the latter likes to consistently harp on about philosophy, politics, psychology, history, science or whatever in the vain (and horribly obvious and subtleless) hope that we'll be impressed by his 'working knowledge' of such things. How about you gain a working knowledge of the female body first? What college you go to doesn't impress me at all, I'd be more impressed with a mechanic with a bit of masculinity than a meek, quiet little BOY who goes to an ivy league college, the elitism and fact your kind looks down upon people isn't helpful either.<br><br>Finally, yes I'm butthurt. I've lost a supposed 'friend' because he said my choice in partners (I don't do relationships at the moment, only 'mutually beneficial exchanges' shall we say) was 'awful' and went on a rant about it with the usual emo nonsense you'd expect from someone like that. What business is it of yours who I sleep with?

If you think of making a thread like this, how about you make it with an actual restriction and not one based on your bigoted ideas about the age of /sp/ users?<br><br>I was alive to see m00t and the exodus. I have seen more than you and whats better is that the closest thing to shitposting I did to celebrate, was masturbating to 30 2D qts in 10 days after we won the gg in 2014 and another 10 qts after we won in 2015.<br><br>Because, I am a NEET, and developed like a NEET.

He was show me American video game and then we are kiss.<br><br>We sex together. I never before now am tell my mother about gay because i am very shame. As i fuck this American boy it is very good to me but also i am feel so guilty. I feel extreme guilty as I begin orgasm. I feel so guilty that I pick up my telephone and call Mother in Russia. I awaken her. It too late for stopping so I am cumming sex. I am very upset and guilty and crying, so I yell her, “I AM CUM FROM SEX” (in Russia). She say what?

This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook.<br>Don’t be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I’m pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than “jack off to naked drawn Japanese people”?

Brother will slowly turn from asshole into decent person, but he will fuck up some stuff and he will force imouto to erase him and by that their father will be back. MC simply disappears from memories and reality. </br></br></br>  <br>She looks cute.<br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off wrinkle fag.</br>  <br>She's not gonna have spotlight, so don't bother.</br>  <br>Dropped after 15 minutes: the animation</br>  <br> suddenly he's turned into a nice beta faggot cookie cutter MC <br>Where are you getting this from? After he got exposed he ran away like a real man would and they literally had to beat and blackmail him to get what they wanted. That dude would have made it to vegas if they didn't have some high speed nigga on their team.</br></br>  <br> She's not gonna have spotlight <br>Yes she will. Pay attention.</br></br>  <br>So is P.A. Works gonna deliver again? People were shitting on them for taking some manga adaptation after Shirobako.</br>  <br>No she won't.<br>A secondary character and a little sister who has at most 2 possible uses:<br>Plot device and cheap drama.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wasn't this meant to be an original series?</br></br>  <br> P.A. Works gonna deliver again <br><br>They always do. Even if Glasslip just delivered fluffy and a god-tier OST.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. Don't believe those blatant lies.</br>  <br>No wrinkles here.</br>  Characters that deserve death:<br>Charlotte<br>Imouto<br><br>Characters that will probably live:<br>Charlotte</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this speculation. It's an anime-original work, after all. I'll take a crack at it.<br><br> The student council is actually a group of students that the government is trying to weaponize.  <br> They are placed on the student council to separate them from the rest of the student body so that they can leave class at convenient times to do missions and shit for the government  <br> The brother imouto and MC think they hazily remember isn't actually a brother, it's their sister, charlotte (who is currently disguised as Yumi).  <br> Charlotte has the ability to alter people's memories and outright erase them if she chooses to do so. <br> Alters MC and imouto's memories to forget her when she runs away from the school for super powered people (she was placed on the "student council" too) <br> Charlotte's power is flawed in that she ages backwards for every minute of memories that she alters <br> As such, she never graduates and loses the power because she always has to use it for government jobs which means she is never actually aging. <br> Can't take it anymore and runs away <br><br>and now depressing backstory because muh feels<br> Their parents died when they were little <br> MC always wished he was someone else (because then he'd have parents) <br> Charlotte alters their memories to become their single mother to get them out of their depression. Takes care of them <br> MC still longs to be someone else but doesn't know why, hence that opening scene  <br> Ends up having to leave them and make them harbor animosity towards her as the mother that foisted child custody on their uncle because she could never graduate super power school <br><br> Why is it even semi-plausible that Yumi/Charlotte is actually their sister? <br><br>Imouto and yumi have same ridiculous purple eyes. Their hair is similar (imouto always took after nee-chan, after all) in style/color. Yumi had to do bangs instead of parting it down the middle to hide her identity better. she also dyed it darker to hide her identity better. <br><br>Your turn, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just realized charlotte is already some blonde chick. disregard that part about yumi being charlotte. yumi is still their sister for the purposes of my speculation though.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br> best imouto <br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this semen vacuum?</br>  <br> semen vacuum <br>I'd play video games (Halo ODST) with, eat ice cream with, play Monopoly with, and maybe cuddle with, but never would I do something so lewd. Maybe even  hold hands with  while we talk about the secrets of the universe.</br></br>  <br>I once saw a screenshot with this green hair making a similar pose like this one; can someone post it?</br>  <br>please respond.</br>  <br>Komachi has a name you fucking pleb.<br><br><br>Nah, i was about to post it but nah. Impatient fuckwit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. One a lot of people around here should utilize every now and then.</br>  So how many Key anime VA cameos will we get?<br><br>So far we've had Mai Nakahara and Tomoe Tamiyasu.</br></br>  What if something bad happens to imouto?  <br>I think you mean game. Also, it still baffles me how Tomoe voiced Riki, Rin, and Sasasegawa Sasami all at the same time.</br>  <br><br>Here's a bonus since I'm such a nice guy</br></br>  <br>Almost positive something bad will happen to imouto since she is the only decent character in the show.<br>When she dies, the anime will truly become worthless.</br></br>  <br>Was Clannad voiced in the original release?</br>  <br><br>If imouto get hurt, we riot</br></br>  <br> .gif <br>I'll probably end up watching the show and make some proper .webm out of it. How shit is it anyway?</br></br>  <br>It came out in 04, there was a rerelease in 06, and the anime was in 07, so I assume one of the games had voices before the anime.</br>  <br>First season was actually pretty good.</br>  This is now an Oregairu thread.<br><br><br>It's a really well liked show even for the cynics of /a/<br><br>First season was better imo. Second was fine but a bit stale at points. It also leaves you with a cliff hanger as a result of the last couple ln's still being in the writing process.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maeda has not killed major characters in his stories since Little Busters, no idea why faggots still pretend he is some sort of edgemaster like le butcher</br>  <br>Can we please not turn this into another brand of generals? Like what happened to shitters such as </br>  Kinda on the fence with this one. The characters haven't interested me at all. MC is just a faggot with insecurity issues that likes to talk big. Imouto is cute though.  <br> Imouto is cute <br>This is reason enough</br></br>  <br>The MC is basically Kanye, with the same voice actor to boot.</br>  <br>Stop trying to police shit. Let the faggot talk about what he wants.</br>  <br>Look, I'm sorry. I just saw the "New thread" and "edition" in the OP and feared we were already devolving into generals.</br>  <br> This is now an Oregairu thread. <br>No. My thread, you slut. I created this for the discussion of Charlotte &amp; the ever-cheerful &amp; chipper Ayu!</br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry anon, these threads have been pretty descent and anons are polite enough to let the thread reach page 10 before making another unlike yahari threads last season.</br></br>  MC is funny as fuck, I don't get why some of you guys have an issue with him. It's pretty obvious he's going to get a lot of character development.  <br>The imouto is too young to have any powers.<br> a small percent of children manifest super powers upon reaching puberty </br></br>  <br>Of course, Im glad Nao stopped him on his tracks right away. She just saved us from the generic antics of another light/lelouche gary stu.</br>  <br>Funny? In what way, anon?<br><br>People in the last thread were bitching about the MC being "edgy" for cheating in school and manipulating people. Peep the archive if you want a better idea but that's the gist of it. <br><br><br> gary stu  <br>How am I supposed to self insert as a good looking, semi-insane MC with subpar superpowers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Fuck that bitch and fuck her derailing my fun plot for some generic magical school bullshit.<br>I would have been fine if it was just him manipulating people with super powers and regular folks trying to catch him in the act, or how he would adjust his powers.<br>But then this bitch comes in and was like "nope, I'm the boss of you and you go to join the xmen"<br>Fuck this show, fuck her, and fuck you.<br>Yes, I'm mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me what you expect from the next episode then, because you likely have the wrong impression.</br>  <br>I liked him too, and I hate Gary Stu characters. Gary Stu and Mary Sue were used to describe super idealized characters without flaws. But it was obvious from the beginning that the anime was painting him as a douchebag, that his hubris is, and evidently was, his downfall.</br>  <br>And it's also called a Tehepero you fucking fag.</br>  <br> not submitting to Nao-sama's will <br>Anon pls. Yu clearly lacks focus and insight, thats why he got caught. Inside the group he will develop and even learn how to use his power more effectively.</br></br>  <br>Go back to watching Death Note edgemaster.</br>  <br>But if she didn't stop him, he would have died of ClannAIDS or something. Now he gets to make lots of friends and watch one or two of them die of ClannAIDS instead.</br>  We're going to see her again, right? They didn't waste time designing her just to give her a minute's worth of screentime, right?  <br>Shut the fuck up already about that fucking bitch you fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Sure thing. This girl will be back too.</br>  This is obviously going to get dark and edgy, could be interesting.<br><br>From the looks of this, this appears to be the consequence of misusing your powers. Seems kind of extreme considering the powers we've seen so far are far too impractical to be used for anything big.</br></br>  <br>When I was in Akihabara and looking at all the advertisements for it, I thought it was a horror anime.</br>  <br>Why, don't you like pathetic main characters?</br>  <br>Looks more to me like the ones with proper and useful powers are taken away to experimentation, or otherwise are experimented on to make the powers stick or be more powerful, kind of like the level 6 program. I think they get anyone who abuses their powers pretty quick.</br>  <br>They shouldn't spoil, in my opinion. Just watching the first episode without looking into it (well I did know the studios involved in it so they are sort of a big hint but that aside) it looks like just looks like comedy chuuni stuff. Would have made a decent "surprise" I guess.<br><br>I really don't want imouto to get hurt. I know she will, though.<br><br><br>That's also certainly a possibility. Otherwise chances are Kanye might have already been hauled off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>delusions<br>Its the same everywhere, you get those who binge on all the material possessions and then you have the few who prepare for the future they want.</br></br>  <br> being this retarded <br>I honestly don't understand why everyone hates the MC. Aside from that stupid maniacal laugh and fake disguise, everything he's done has been pretty understandable. So the guy thinks he's the only one with powers. He is able to cheat his way through school and life in general, and he is physically attractive to boot. Would this not go to your head, anon? Would highschool you not think you were the shit? Then all of the sudden his world gets turned upside down when he gets busted (he loses his confidence in front of Yumi). And to top it all off he's forced to move. That's why he seems like a meek shithead now. Why is that pathetic?</br></br>  <br>People either like absolute betas that they can feel superior to, or powerful self-inserts that get everything they want while being a paragon of virtue.</br>  <br><br><br>God damn these qts.</br></br></br>  Good subs fucking when?  <br><br>Nigga, the protagonists of great fiction aren't great because of how they measure up to the viewer. Great protagonists are great because they are sympathetic characters. Because the audience can identify with them and understand their struggles. That's all that needs to happen. So far I've seen a protaginast who had a nasty reality check (who didn't think, at some point in highschool, that they weren't the shit?) and is struggling to control his surroundings. How the fuck can you not relate to that?</br></br>  <br><br>He's a pittiable douche in many ways, but the part where he stages the accident so he can save the girl was outright selfish and ridiculous. People keep overlooking this when they try an defend him. <br> b-but you would do the same thing too <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Way to take what I said out of context, friend. I'm talking about him being pathetic. Not about him being a douche. I never said he's a great guy.<br><br>He thinks he's the shit and he wants other people to feel the same way. So he rescues a girl from a speeding truck. Anybody with half a brain wouldn't do something that risky but its a testament to how full of himself he is.</br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. What you described is what makes a good protagonist. I'm talking about the sort of people who hate the MC.</br>  <br>And since this is a Key anime, the truck driver probably killed a father of four beautiful children, who are now orphans, and will have to be sold into sex slavery to avoid starving.<br><br>That's right, folks. Kanye is behind all the Japanese Truck killings you've ever seen. He deserves none of your sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>... so the sort of people who hate the MC don't know what a good protagonist is. That's my point.</br>  <br> QC finishing now. </br>  <br>Mazui?</br>  <br>Fyurie pls go.</br>  <br>This is at least the third time I see someone mentioning Mazui in these threads, what gives?</br>  <br>Right, but you replied and addressed me as though those were my views.<br><br> ... <br>Don't do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to post this on every single Charlotte thread?</br>  <br>That happened,he was busted, and he acted pathetic because of that, he wouldn't be pathetic if there was no reason.Was it bad? No, and I will keep watching.</br>  <br>My bad, m8. When you said "people" I thought you were trying to speak for everyone (including yourself, of course). That didn't read like you were only trying to speak for the people that did not like him. <br><br>I did that so that I wouldn't have to start the sentence with "So." It suited my autism at the time. I'll see what I can do.</br></br></br>  I like the MC, at least he isn't a disgusting beta like bell from danmachi  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>Don't really think I can enjoy this anime.</br></br>  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>I really think I'm going to enjoy this anime.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think he'll stay that way, anon? After having such a rude awakening from Yumi snd learning that he isn't the only special snowflake with powers?</br>  <br>I can see why you'd think that. No worries, it just keeps popping up a lot the past week.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, it's just me. <br><br> [GJM-Mezashite] Charlotte - 01 [40A3E193].mkv </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks baby.</br>  <br>Well considering all the edgelords here would be disappointed if he started acting normal I really don't expect him to change.</br>  <br> not expecting character development <br>why am I taking this bait</br></br>  <br><br>I just want my smug MC, my smug FeMC and that qt redhead.</br></br>  I like this asshole mc. So far its great.   possession power only lasts five seconds <br> "so I can't use it for lewd stuff' <br>MC would have been a real criminal if his power wasn't shit.</br></br>    I'd let her roll roll her hands in front of me if you know what I mean.  Look at this face. Is this the face of evil?  Is this going to be another anime where nobody in the threads refer to the characters by their real names?  Whats this show about?  <br>No. Its just the first episode. No one remembers names in the first episode.</br>  <br>What do you mean? Charlotte is Charlotte.</br>  <br>No one cares about your fun. Go post on your blog.</br>  <br>Too bad the VA of Misuzu (Kawakami Tomoko) won't ever show up. She passed away in 2011 at the age of 41.</br>  Calling it now, imouto brainwashed Yuu to forget his long, lost brother.  <br>Watch the first episode and read the synopsis, you lazy fuck.<br><br>It has the potential to be very good or very generic. Cocky MC gets a reality check and is uprooted from everything that's familiar to him. Hopefully this covers his personal growth and explores peoples' powers rather than turning into another generic schoolshit comedy</br></br></br>  <br>Why not both, maybe it'll be both a school life comedy/drama and sci-fi horror at the same time.<br>I trust that the brilliant mind of Maeda Jun can pull it off, complete with sad girls in snow.</br></br>  <br>is this harem?</br>  <br><br>So generic it hurts. They even stressed it.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Mai "Terminator" Nakahara <br>Oh, so she'll be back then?</br></br>  <br>No but this one is</br>  This show had the potential to be AOTS but they ruined it in the first episode.<br> MC is a smug asshole who thinks only of himself <br> Uses powers to cheat and get girls <br> No-fun-allowed student council shows up and everything goes to shit <br>I only wanted a 13 episode series of MC being an asshole then getting fucked when his powers fade, instead he is going to become Tomori's bitch and agree with her corrupted sense of justice</br></br></br></br>  <br>epic post +1</br>  <br><br>I came here for these two smugs. <br>Will the smug continue?</br></br></br>  <br> implying we know the student council is the fun police <br>They (presumably) stole his health records, made a mess of the town with teleportbro, and kicked the shit out of MC twice. <br>If  is anything to go on, these people aren't just at all.</br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>The student council and the underground lab are almost definitely not the same.</br>  <br>That's why<br> corrupted sense of justice <br>Student council is just as bad or even worse than MC if they are willing to do so much collateral damage to catch a guy who cheated on tests just because he is a potential danger.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>oh no, it is following me<br>begone I say</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has he finally discovered the joys of 2D?</br>  <br><br>Deathnotefag pls go.</br></br>   No qualms in getting other people hurt. <br>Damn, this nigga hard.</br>  <br>Don't know, I didn't even mean to post that screenshot but it's already too late, rip.</br>  <br>almost is good enough for my autism, at this point.<br><br>If they're just as bad as MC, why is that not "fun" to you? You just said that the show was "fun" when he was cheating and shit.</br></br></br>  When will he lost it?  <br>When Key happens</br>  <br>He's already lost it.<br><br> His memories, that is. </br></br></br>  What does it mean?  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Spyro please, go underground if you have to. Don't leave us waiting three years for translations that might never actually happen.<br><br>Fuck these news, now this is depressing.<br><br>It means nothing, even though I wanted it to mean something, OP.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  They're closer irl.  <br>Look on the bright side. If Spyro gives up this easily it just means that Iroha end is highly likely.<br><br> Spyro's not depressed, they said </br></br></br>  Paper in my pocket, hoes on my team.  <br>Yui has orange hair, Yukino has black hair. <br>8man doesn't drink orange juice.<br>He likes his coffee black= Yukino's hair. <br><br>Yuifags btfo once again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the delay until 2016 despite work having already started probably means they're waiting so that they can release a volume every few months</br>  <br>THIS<br>Pastebin translations/the archives/here are the best options.</br></br>  <br>cumpai!</br>  <br> Yui has orange hair <br><br>You fucking wot</br></br></br>  Please no more. I can't believe you anons doing this 24/7. Only been since the last episode and am about to lose it.  <br> He won't choose Orange Juice <br> Go away Nonomiya. </br></br>  <br><br>At least there's news to discuss this time around.</br></br>  <br>LN says it's peach colored.</br>  <br>Looks like BARF to me.</br>  change.org will help us  <br>That's some weak bait you're using there, Anon.</br>  <br> peaches <br> orange </br></br>  <br><br>I really don't get the fuss. Why can't you just post the translations on /a/?</br></br>  <br><br>Sure. Make a petition to Yen saying "Please stop trying to make money off Oregairu". We'll see how it goes.</br></br>  <br>Why not jump on to reddit's subreddit for yahari (not talking about fucking /r/anime) and translate it from there. Mods there seem like ok guys.<br><br>obviously &gt;reddit it has a comment section and is rather more accessable. Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there.</br></br></br>  It will never be as fun as before.<br><br>I'm just wasting my time here.</br></br>  The next Yahari thread will die before the bump limit.  Yo Ho, all together,<br>Hoist the replies high<br>Heave Ho, cunts and killers<br>Never shall we die.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year, one every 3 months for all their licenses and it doesn't seem like they will be increasing pace any time soon. I'd prefer it one every 2 months so 6 volumes per year. <br><br>They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. As authors releases like 2 volumes max per year in Japan. <br><br>So:<br> 2017 to get to volume 4 <br> 2018 to get to volume 8 <br> 2019 to get to volume 12 <br><br>Though within 4 years you can easily learn enough nippon to read anything you like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have began the thread with the announcement of Yen Press license for Oregairu.</br>  <br> Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year <br><br>This applies to manga too right?</br></br></br>  The Yen Press release is only step one.<br>How long until we get an English dub?</br>  <br> Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there. <br>It does, if reddit admins receive C&amp;D they will warn you and or shut down your sub if you don't comply. It's in their ToS.</br></br>  <br> They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. <br>Then Yen Press should take into consideration adapting the .5 volumes, also.</br></br>  <br>But it does look like puke.</br>  <br>Yes, sometimes it even 5 volumes per year for them.</br>  <br>What news? haven't visited Yahari threads for few days.</br>  <br>Yen Press is killing yahari</br>  Good Irohasu~, everyone!  <br>LN got licensed, Sypro will receive C&amp;D from Yen Press if he keeps his translations up into next year, if he doesn't comply Yen Press will shut his site down. They can do this and did this to DanMachi translator when he wouldn't give in.<br><br>So Spyro will now have to remove his translations off the blog eventually and go underground or we are stuck until 2019 to be able to read the rest of the story.<br><br>Not to mention Yen Press is going to localise Iroha's "Senpai's" and other horrifics to Mr/Miss/Mister/Mrs.<br><br>It's a sad day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally look at the last thread, it hasn't even died yet</br>  <br>Yukino's dependency issues and the club is not being genuine. They know there is a love triangle and they are too scared to confront it.</br>  <br> for few days <br><br>so close</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not upload pdfs on nyaa?</br></br>  <br> I can earnestly type that we may not get to volume five. <br>Nah they'll keep going with this one, Yahari will sell well for them considering how well known the franchise is now amongst the community.</br></br>  <br>even when it's links to pastebins? still it might pass under the radar.<br><br>Or actually just fuck everything. I don't want to lose hope.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope ISIS will behead them.</br>  <br>There are various ways for translations to continue such as you've suggested, SAO's translation still continues to this day. It all depends on whether Spyro is willing to go underground or not, and so far he's just left a vague statement.</br>   spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br> anime says fuck you, buy the LN, leaving us in a cliffhanger. <br> watari is a hack writer, more drama, more waifu wars. <br> then jew press strike again; volume 11 in next decade, volume 12 will be history. <br> yahari fan translation is dead <br> tfw its raining outside, just like my tears falling down in my eyes. <br><br>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK<br>Being a NEET in a third world shithole is suffering.<br>Thank you americunts for ruining anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fansubs are all underground, I don't see what's the big deal. It's not like he's translating for the e-peen right?</br></br>  <br>moderators<br> When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subreddits you moderate, you agree to remove it. <br>If Yen Press report it then they'll have to remove it. If they don't then it'll be fine, but Reddit threads quickly turn up on Google so doubt it'll go under the radar for long considering how on edge YP is about their stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> I still haven't read the fucking LN <br>Fuuuuuuuuuck</br></br>  <br> &gt;spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br>he's quitting because you guys kept saying this<br> fuck this gay earth spyro-sama don't leave us like this </br></br></br>  Spyro can just go dark, randomly show up with a pdf/epub of Vol 11, and go back into hiding. <br><br>Rinse/Repeat for Vol 12/13</br></br>  Whoa whoa whoa I've missed a lot. <br><br>So is Spyro quitting the translating?</br></br>  <br>;(<br><br>Spyro was cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Differences is that CR/Funi don't send out C&amp;D's and DMCA's like their life depends on it. They so far haven't gone out of their way to shut fansub groups and their websites down, however Yen Press will do this.<br>CR/Funi is even aware that HS steals from them and don't really do anything about it.</br></br>  <br>you could try learning jap<br><br>it's not hard</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/89<wbr>du4zd7n3hny/Oregairu<br>Quick.</br></wbr></br>  Here's where I draw the line.<br>Between this and being practically stuck with nothing but CR and Funi this season, I've lost it.<br><br>I'm learning Japanese.<br>Starting tomorrow.</br></br></br></br>  What did Haruno mean here? Also why was Yukino looking at Hikki?  <br><br><br>Yeah gonna start learning. maybe when Vol 12 comes out I can parse basic sentences when I get ahold of a copy</br></br></br>  Fuck jew press  <br>Yukino looked to 8man for help but 8man couldn't do anything and Haruno emphasized that</br>  <br> tfw I have japanese language manuals for dummies <br> tfw losing motivation to learn because of moonrunes. </br></br>  <br>Japan is weird, they literally treat every small difference in a product as individual licenses. This is why Yen Press doesn't always do digital releases since that's another set of red tape. Also why New Testament translations can carry on hassle free despite YP picking up the series.<br><br>The .5 are most require their own licenses as well which I don't think they got so I doubt they will be releasing them.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino wanted Hikki help, Haruno said no, Yukimom invites Hikki to the party, he sees what she actually means and fucks off.</br>  Pretty much everything that YP has licensed ends up getting underground fan translations anyway. I panic every time this happens, and I'm just not going to do it this time. I'm sure Spyro or someone else will keep underground translations going here.  <br>Yukino-chan wanted to have sex in public, but as an upstanding citizen and lady of high class, Haruno intervened.</br>  <br>Just visit the /djt/ learn your kana first before you start jumping into any books whatsoever. You have 4 years, you have more than enough time.</br>  <br><br> tripfags now rearing their ugly threads <br>Well that explains why these threads have always been so shit.</br></br></br>  <br>No way was Yukino going to lose her virginity before her.</br>  <br>Mahouka isn't going underground anon, DanMachi translations have also come to a halt same with Accel World. There is an equal amount of translators that have just quit it altogether.</br>  I'm going to capture Senpai<br><br><br>Also, I've confirmed the typo in it as the author mentions it in the comments.<br><br> Where am I going to make Iroha TL's now, since I only use 4chan. I hope there will still be LN threads. </br></br></br></br></br>  Is it ever stated in the LN whether Hachiman is good at English?  <br>Well Oregairu translations basically boils down to Spyro so we'll see what he decides to do<br><br> YFW we wont even get S3/Movie/OVA to cover the remaining novels </br></br></br>  <br>DanMachi was kill<br>Spyro is the only dedicated uptodate translator, if he's gone we'll have nobody</br></br>  <br>No, his only good subject is Japanese.</br>  <br><br>He's good at history, too.<br><br>But I don't think any two subjects have ever been emphasized as strongpoints for him except for Japanese literature and history.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Am Yukinofag <br> Spyro may quit translating altogether <br> Possibly no animation for remaining novels <br><br>Fuck Yen Press. These are some dark dark times. Time to learn moonrunes<br><br>We'll have Vol 12 Spoiler thread to look forward to I guess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought /djt/ was our home now, no use making more threads</br>  <br>Mahouka is still going on. Here's the latest volume  Accel World translations died a year before it was licensed.

She's ambivalently good. Or ambivalently evil depending on how you look at it.<br><br>She's definitely trying to help Yukino, but her way of going about it makes you realize that's not all there is to her motivations.</br></br></br></br>  8man's wet dream<br><br><br>Fuck that, please no.<br>I feel bad for the EOPs now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually yea, I was thinking a bit too much about monster hunter.<br>It's good to be bit liberal.</br></br>  <br> Mr. Harris <br>I laugh but it hurts so much<br>Spyro isn't here to save me anymore ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Only Yukinofags thought she was "bad", purely because she consistently soiled Yukino's image.</br>  <br>Oh sweet, Volume 15 is done as well then?</br>  Tsk Tsk<br>Putting such a nice Irohasu~ picture under a tag I don't check often.</br>    Why did 8man stop drinking Georgia black? is it symbolism? i was actually gonna try some but then he started drinking MAX.  no one is actually going to buy jew press' shit why are they doing this?  <br>He only drank it once when he was pining for Sensei.</br>  <br>It still needs some work, go check out the mahouka thread, the link for 15 is there, as well as several text posts with the missing parts. <br><br>I have no idea where these translations are coming from, but they get posted regularly in Mahouka thread's. I'm sure Spyro could do the same. Just throw out a google link in a yahari thread one day, then let the anons propagate it.</br></br></br>  <br>Shekels.<br>$$$$$</br></br>  <br>When he was in depression mode after StuCo arc he needed the symbolism to make genuine seem more significant</br>  <br>He's been drinking MAX since the start, he only drank BLACK when talking with sensei or when he was being a loner again.</br>  <br>Yen Press's target audience isn't people who post on 4chan. Its lonely girls in their young teens who hang out in the young adult sections of bookstores.</br>  <br>Shit, thanks for that. This kind of stuff should be a crime.</br>  <br>i diddn't even realize that. so MAX coffee is 8mans true character drink?</br>  <br><br>If Spyro quit his translation and they started with vol. 11, I'd probably buy it assuming vol 12 isn't the end and already out by then.<br><br>But I won't sit back and wait years for them to catch up to an already finished series we all know the ending to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Yuifags gotta step up their game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, I thought all signs where pointing to Yukino end?</br>  <br>You took bait too seriously, Yukino ship didn't sink</br>  <br>In the anime yes, in the LN it's left everyone on equal footing only favoring Yukino just a bit because of her request and being her final arc.</br>  <br>Well It's not like an Irohafag would've picked it up till Vol9., but as we know Spyro was already Tl'ing.<br>And Sakifags, well she didn't get that much attention for a fanatic to take it up.<br>But I still think in the end it would've been Spyro to TL the novel even if no-one had picked it up til Vol.9</br></br></br>  So since there's really no such thing as fujo's in America, and everyone's reaction to her shipping would be considered homophobic in today's culture. Who wants to bet YP completely removes the character of Ebina from their translations?  <br>Basically took Yui all of Vol 11 to catch up to Yukino <br><br>Yuki in Vol 11 seems to reach lowest point in series but can only go up from here on out (her request and Oregairu being her story basically since Vol 6)</br></br></br>  <br>The ship that did truly sink is sailed by Irohafags.</br>  <br>Are going to start shitposting again?<br><br>Ok, then let me tell you something that triggers people.<br><br>Iroha is genuine</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, then let me tell you something that triggers Irohafags.<br><br>Iroha is not a main heroine, she's a side character.</br></br></br>  <br>Underground is the answer, captain.</br>  <br>No, I think what really trigger other is this<br>Iroha is a main heroine.</br></br>  <br>What part of Iroha is genuine exactly?<br>I don't mean it as an insult I mean what is her genuine?<br><br>For instance Yumiko's feelings for Hayato have been proven to be genuine as soon as she admitted that she has no problem going through whatever it takes to just be beside Hayato, she's willing to struggle for him.</br></br></br></br>  Well at least we got over the licensing stuff pretty fast. Back to shipper shitposting!  <br>Irohafags never fail to shit up a thread</br>  <br>They are busy downloading yahari stuffs.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do we keep spyro motivated to continue translating?<br> s-should we send him chocolate? </br></br>  <br>Not him, but I think her relationship with 8man is the most genuine out of all the girls. They understand each other pretty well and don't have any secrets or any walls put up. Aside from Hayama and his sister, Iroha is one of 8man's most genuine relationships.<br><br> Still not going to win though unless WW asspulls something .</br></br></br>  <br>Buy him Yukino merch.</br>  <br>If he come here for a vacation and swimming, I will give him a  hug .</br>  <br>Buy him Yukino chocolates.</br>  Anyone have pdf download link for vol 10.5?  this guy has everything except for that  <br><br><br><br><br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like the characters and their interactions, but Hachiman and co. always speak in fucking riddles.

Also I don't understand some of Haruno's line. This is especially apparent in S2 episode 8. I'll list down some of it here.<br><br>I'll skip sensei's part since I get the general idea of what she's is talking about, though not the context behind.<br><br> You're being unfair, Yukinon. <br><br>What exactly that she did, that is unfair?<br><br> You bring that out right now? Talk about playing dirty. <br><br>Playing dirty? What did Yui bring out?<br><br> Hang on.

That's why ants are so much more dominant than people, right? That's why animals alter the terrain of their planet to suit their needs rather than adapting to it, right? That's why animals have gone outside of the planet on their own, right? <br> &gt;one of the deadliest things in human history <br>So is childbirth</br></br></br></br>  <br>but hes not blue</br>  <br> Because population means it's the dominant species on the planet, right? That's why ants are so much more dominant than people, right? <br>Yes that's exactly what it means. Humans aren't more plentiful nor do they inhabit more places on earth. <br><br>The only reason humans think they're dominant is because they're the only animal that even knows the concept of "dominant" to begin with so there's nobody to challenge the claim.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Animals adapt to suit their environment, while humans change the environment to suit them. Humans are the only species to change climates on a large scale. That makes them by far the most dominant thing on this planet. A single species has caused a mass extinction event.</br>  <br>And yet they could never do anything that would wipe out all bacteria on the planet. Humans are obviously going to go extinct far before bacteria do (if they ever do at all). That makes them dominant.

There are 2 nations at war. Nation 1 goes around shooting bombs everywhere for no reason and causing lots of destruction, while nation 2 just has an impregnable wall.

If they only kill themselves then obviously that's not dominating.

That lineart looks amazing, and you captured his mannerisms so well.<br>Take as much time as you need, I'm willing to wait forever for my husbando.</br></br>  <br> tfw not sure if I would be welcomed or kicked out of the first oldfag thread  <br><br>Life is suffering but this is the path I've chosen.</br></br></br>  <br>Why, who are you?</br>  <br>Watching Danmachi and saying fuck Hestia and go Freya.</br>  <br>I want to draw Tohka for a Tohkafag, but I'd be committing to this shit.<br>Thanks Mishafag..</br></br>  <br>Heh, so you've been secretly monitoring these threads, eh?</br>  Requesting Sawyer in an American flag bikini, much like this one:<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2745219<br><br>Alternatively, she can wear a sweaterdress with an American flag pattern.<br><br>Further character reference:<br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435982837219.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435982837219.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It feels like you haven't been here in ages.</br>  <br>Oh my, I probably should have kept the other thread open on a tab, but it's hard to do on mobile.<br><br><br>Really   lewd . How'd you know I prefer the leaner Vega just a bit more than his buff versions? Thank you Boxas and have a great week.  I should also make a proper ref too. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't we all?<br><br> I lurk around /v/ too, nothing to request there either. <br><br><br>I really have nothing to request and I was suffering from intense Hestia poisoning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting my waifu Suzuna cheering for the US women's world cup team. Hope the weekend finds you all in good spirits.  <br>Hestia is shit and the only good thing about her clothes were the gloves.<br>I have never been so confused by a fad in my life.</br></br>  Requesting Mao!  <br>Would you draw her for me anon? Bwaka a cute and while I love my waifu and that will never change, I also appreciate cute art of characters I like and Tohka is one of them. It's a shame what MF has done to these threads, but at the bare minimum there's at least one other person who likes her and she's 100%anime related. <br><br>I respect your commitment to draw only for legit waifu fags though, keep doing God's work anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It's cool anon, just wanted to make sure you saw it. You got till next weekend to make a reference so get on that.</br>  <br><br>Welcome back Clioneanon! I haven't seen you request in a while I think. I hope you feel better and request more often, I love drawing crying.</br></br>  <br>Loki is the best.</br>  <br>You just have shit taste. Or you're just gay, only explanation for being confused about why people like a woman.</br>  <br>A ghost of the past that no one remembers or cares enough to mention my name in years. I'm better off being dead.</br>  <br>Woah, that looks nothing like her!</br>  <br>Get a load of this guy.</br>  <br>I was confused by the Hestia fad too, I was choking on her being shoved in my face all day. Poison, Hestia was a harsh poison slowly killing me.<br><br><br>Freya for life!</br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as you aren't Surtic, all is well.</br>  <br>I'm going to have the agree to disagree and say Loki for life.</br>  Anything that is SFW is fine by me, maybe something zanny/comical like a bunch of /m/ anons in cosplay trying to save Hitomi from something incredibly mundane or kidnapping her to do something /m/ related that is fun for them and not her.  <br>I'm glad you're a reasonable person.</br>  There are faggots that actually like manbody, manface, man personality shitty ass Loki.  <br> surtic <br>I've only seen him posting on /a/ once for over a year.</br></br>  <br>You'd probably like a load from that guy, queer.</br>    <br>I never feel any better, I am always in a constant state of being depressed. Still seeing Clione's face covered in tears gives me a tingly feeling in my chest and I really appreciate you drawing her sorrow for me. Only someone like me would be a bit more happy seeing his waifu suffering.</br>  <br><br>ok ok I gave her colors</br></br>  <br>Thank you drawfriend, I love it even though its lewd</br>  <br>Not OR, but nice colors. I think OR wanted the burger with black buns though.</br>  <br>Oops you are right, I was too excited to draw her. Here is a quick kind of fix.<br><br><br>You're welcome, crying girls are very cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have some nice taste, Loki was alright. Still Freya for life!<br><br><br>I was waiting for that adaption for the longest time but then the Hestia got a bit insufferable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You used to be cool, Shinjiro. You have fallen.</br>  <br>Alright alright simmer down, or take it to a different thread.</br>  <br>You linked the wrong post. </br>  Sorry to bother you again drawfriend but it seems you forgot the shirt thing on her left, or was that intentional?  <br>I'm not into jealous, Over - bearing cunt sandwich. <br> <br>What are you even saying, nigger?</br></br></br>  <br>No you're just into men.</br>  <br>ah not really, it was lewd to begin with, but thanks for noticing</br>  <br>I feel that tears show the truest emotion, everyone can relate to sorrow. Thank you again, though I feel like trash for always wanting to see Clione's pretty face in a frown and her beautiful eyes pouring tears out.</br>  <br>O-oh, o-okay...<br> Thanks again drawfriend for putting up with my selfishness </br></br>  If your waifu had a dick would you swallow her babyjuice?  Requesting Kohaku, from Tsukihime, unleashing Ea. Thank you.  <br>Fuck yeah</br>  <br> I'm not into jealous, Over - bearing cunt sandwich. <br> I'm not into women that love the person they love </br></br>  <br>Need color on lewd squid.<br>Need this for reasons.</br></br>  Requesting anything with my mermaid waifu Mei Mer, preferably her hugging her own tail.  <br>What kind of fag would say no to that?</br>  <br>I wouldn't suck her dick.

See you next weekend.  <br>Requesting waifus talking and playing with each other</br>  <br><br><br> non-Americans <br><br>You're free to despair now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Murrica says Good night!  I have always hated this goodnight shit.<br>Wait until the thread hits 500, assholes.</br>  <br>Anon, it's over. It's dead.</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm still waiting too.</br>  <br>Canadian here. I pretty much knew to not expect anything this weekend because of that.</br>  Disappointed that Hexfag wasn't Murrican.  <br>Should have requested something to celebrate Canada Day.  Or your waifu burning the American flag. </br>  <br>I am American. Thanks for drawing her Ycake.</br>  <br>Thank you for the lovely Hanako, 34! I like how her expression looks.</br>  <br>The only thing I'm waiting for is the final fantasy collages. I got my delivery already.<br>I just can't stand this circle jerking, post wasting, inconsiderate attitude.</br></br>  <br>I wait unless we aren't near 500 posts when I need to head to bed.</br>  <br>I think phalanx only did one for this weekend. Maybe it'll be an ongoing thing and more will be posted this following weekend.</br>  <br>I did, but only on the last day.  I wouldn't do that to our southern bro-fags </br>  <br><br><br> Goodbyes before the thread hits post limit. <br>Scum, all of you. I bet you denied one hopeful anon a delivery I hope you are happy</br></br></br></br>  <br>The part that's crossed out is such because I realized that you copied pic related with the double magazine, which made it appear as if the magazine well was cut out of the side wall of the receiver.<br><br>Hope this helps!</br></br></br>  <br> Didn't request in the collage <br>I was sure her charm would get someone this weekend but oh well</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>all of these are really nice</br></br></br></br></br></br>  We have multiple sub options this time and the determination to fist is stronger than ever.  <br>How delayed is the CR simulcast?</br>   Episode 7   What is going to happen to Hibiki? From my rough trace, it looks like Hibiki's roight leg transfroms into a 3rd scarf.  <br>So delayed you probably can't call it a simulcast, since they say it's going to happen "after summer".</br>  <br>But summer ends on september 21st.</br>  <br><br>She's toast</br></br>  <br>Has to be her leg right?</br>  So close  <br>You guys should calm down 20+ hours with constant symphogear threads one after another is just asking for trouble.</br>  <br>It was the same past season, I dont see the problem</br>  <br>*30</br>  <br>I don't want her to die. She's just starting to have fun in her life again.<br> ;_; </br></br>  Who do you want to see die the most in episode 7? I hope it's Chris again.  <br>But I don't want to see anyone die.  Genjuro </br>  <br>It was also terrible last season when people kept pushing threads for no real reason, just because they were waiting on subs. No one is immune to eternally propagated threads going to shit when there's no new material.</br>  <br>It will be Miyu, then Biki will fuse with and become gungnir.</br>  <br>At least we keep it one thread unlike Fatefags.</br>  <br>Ogawa</br>  <br>Dont go killing off characters that arent in this series</br>  <br> Miyu <br>The plot thickens.</br></br>  <br>Not as bad as Yaharifags who switch threads immediately after hitting the bump limit.</br>  <br><br><br>Dont even respond to it. Its just shit posting at this point. He went on and on about it. He just doesnt want us to talk about anime airing this season.</br></br></br>  <br>In all seriousness daddy issues kind of seem like they're going to be a thing this season and Genjuro is everyone's dad so</br>  <br>The only threads that weren't just mindless posting were the stream one and the single one <br>At this point we are just Nanafags vs Aoifags comiie vs zoid and calling names each other</br></br>  <br>Another little girl daughtered.<br>How can one man be so based?</br></br>  <br>Almost like some kind of miracle</br>  <br><br>Hibiki will be forced into berserk mode by Carol and end up killing Genjuro and becoming an antagonist for the second half of the show until the finale.</br></br>  <br>That would be impossibly sad.</br>  <br>But imagine how hype the finale would be.</br>  <br>So which side would Miku be on?</br>  <br>Miku will kill anyone to protect her waifu</br>  <br><br>is wanting to talk about something you like so unreasonable? <br>We keep to one thread and stay on-topic. Who is it bothering?</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Hibiki? </br>  Is this show worth watching? Can anyone give me the lowdown?  <br>Did you not watch S2?<br><br><br>No. Waste of time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbians with Super Robot Wars tier of hotblood.</br>  <br>It's like Madoka with singing.</br>  <br>Magical girls use science armor and the power of song to fight evil aliens. It's dumb and fun and exciting. Are you down with exciting dumb fun? It's that. <br><br>Start with the first season obviously, this is the third.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like Love Live with Gundams.</br>  <br>He's upset cause he has one less thread he can shitpost in<br><br><br>It isn't, it's just SAO with singing</br></br></br></br>  I just want to let you guys know that I want to  see Miku  lick Biki's belly.<br> some Maria/Tsubasa mutual navel worship's fine, too. </br>  <br><br>May contain fisting.</br></br>  <br>It's like if you had a Madoka who watched all of G Gundam 11 times and learned everything from it, then put her in a situation where she has to sing and punch the shit out of everything while being mentored by a MAN who just so happens to be an expert in being a MAN</br>  <br>Except the songs are actually good.</br>  <br>It's macross with punching</br>  <br>I wouldn't speculate someone dying just because that producer guy said they made higher ups angry. I mean, look at Punchline, Amamiya Sora said episode 6 was her favorite or something and everyone took it as HUEG PLOT TWEEEST and everyone who hyped themselves got disappointed for no fucking reason.</br>  <br>Nanafags and Aoifags are friends with each other, there are faggots who go too far but they don't really fight against each other.</br>  what's this business about someone dying in episode 7?  <br>Hibiki is going to commit suicide in episode 7</br>  <br>Kaneko said he went over the line in episode 7.<br>Nana said she did a lot of screaming in episode 7.<br>And we all know that 7 is a very important number for Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br>Rumors, we do know Episode 7 made some higher ups angry.</br>  <br>Theres a ninja secretary pop idol manager who can run on water.<br><br>Theres a guy with superhuman strength whos almost as strong as the main characters if not stronger,hes not a mutant or anything he just like kongfu movies.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the last time he hyped up an episode it was the one where Hibiki got her arm ripped off.</br>  <br>PLEASE NO<br><br>NOT AGAIN</br></br></br>  <br> Christian religions consider 7 to be a Holy Number because in Genesis the first book of the Bible it says that God rested on the 7th day and man was created on the 6th day, therefore 777 is thought to be the antithesis of 666. <br> The numbers 3 and 7 are considered both "perfect numbers" under Hebrew tradition. </br></br>  <br>Loli spreading anus confirmed?</br>  So commie or H&amp;D?<br><br>I have no idea now</br></br>  <br>Commie</br>  <br>That on top of all the talk about how suffering this season is going to be and how depressed it made Nana.</br>  <br>raw</br>  <br>H&amp;D. Zoid has been translating Symphogear stuff for years and has a personal investment in it.</br>  <br> 3 and 7 are considered both "perfect numbers" under Hebrew tradition. <br> Aoi and Nana </br></br>  <br>Whichever is first</br>  <br>Raw or H&amp;D<br><br> using memesubs </br></br></br>  <br>H&amp;D has the better subs overall, but their encode is dogshit.</br>  <br>Commie. Consistent subs for all seasons.</br>  <br>I really enjoyed the subs for the last episode of season 2!</br>  <br>Live watch, raw, commie and H&amp;D</br>  <br>Terminology and style wise.</br>  <br>This guy gets it</br>  <br>How's their typesetting though? Commie has pretty nice typesetting for the songs.</br>  <br>That's styling you idiot, and this season styling is fucking shit.</br>  <br>zombie kanade when</br>  <br><br><br>This</br></br></br>  <br>Episode 7</br>  <br>Amateurish, but they're trying. There have been guys from commie giving them advice all afternoon  almost like it's not the stupid rivalry people on /a/ want to make it out to be </br>  <br>More Kanade figs when?</br>  <br>Because there's none, hating on commie is just a dank meme even when their subs are the best</br>  <br>haha epic man sick  burn </br>  <br>Dank kanade</br>  <br>commie are fucking retards<br>they are like gg except gg wasnt even trying</br></br>   you will never do it for free with a passion <br> you will never suffer from serious paranoid delusions about crack shipping to the point that you try to block out anything that might cause cognitive dissonance <br> you will never write pokemon yuri fanfic <br> you will never stalk another person with serious mental health issues because they post Goodra spam <br> you will never post futa on /u/ unironically because you thought it was yuri <br> you will never fuck a hotpocket while thinking of MLP <br> you will never have an OkCupid account to look for a 3DPD whore <br> you will never be Troid. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> s just a dank meme <br>No it's not. Their over-localization is actually shit and stupid</br></br>  <br> you will never write pokemon yuri fanfic <br> you will never post futa on /u/ unironically because you thought it was yuri <br> you will never fuck a hotpocket while thinking of MLP <br> you will never have an OkCupid account to look for a 3DPD whore <br><br> But I have </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when did commie pick up mahoyo?<br>How is it not out yet?<br>I actually learned fucking japanese in the time it took them</br></br></br>  When red and blue doll crash Chris's apartment next episode I hope Shirabe pulls out some sweet ninja tricks  <br> this guy thinks it's real <br>kek</br></br>  <br> yfw it's the fisting episode <br><br>Yeah no wonder she did a lot of screaming. The fist is going up her ass.</br></br></br>  <br>  "If you say that's not a miracle of god, then it must be the uncontrollable power of devils!" <br><br>So did Carol's father get a hold of a Relic or what?</br></br></br>  <br>It's like if G Gundam fucked Macross Frontier who then gave birth to Madoka.</br>  <br>Seemed like they were talking about alchemy, but maybe it involves relics somehow since that's probably what the dolls are made from and Elfnein is running away with Dainsleif.</br>  <br>he was selling viagra</br>  I want to fist Chris. Don't hurt me for this.  <br> you will never hai tachi shirabe after teaching her some sweet ninja moves </br>  The ass game this season is strong. Hibbie doesnt deserve a booty that huge.  <br>dainsleif mikugear confirmed?<br>hibiki dies confirmed?</br></br>  <br> Hibbie doesnt deserve a booty that huge. <br><br>She deserves everything and more.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Dainsleif is for Hibiki</br>  <br> does a hundred squats ever morning  <br> not a huge ass  <br><br>Anon do you even lift</br></br></br></br>  Why did they take the Symphogear rhythm game off the japanese app store?  <br>Probably didn't work with newer phones</br>  <br>What if its for Tsubasa and she accidentally kills everyone in episode 7?</br>  <br>Dainsleif is for  Anime. </br>  <br>Is Hibiki going to turn into a  God  in episode 7 so that we can all  worship  her? Sure looks that way to me.</br>  <br>We already worship her.</br>  <br>Guys.<br>what if thats not even hibiki?<br>what if thats kanade.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean officially. I want some tax exemptions.</br>  <br>But her hair</br>  <br>Kanade has sexy and glorious fluffy hair anon.</br>  <br>It's made with a low budget and very short development time that it has a lot of bug. Lots of people said it freezes before connecting to the server or couldn't work on iOS7. It seems like the publisher knew its problems so they didn't advertise it and removed it from store within 3 months.</br>  <br><br>Cutting of your hair means character development!</br></br>  <br>But her fluffy bird hair is her charm point</br>   7 minutes into first episode <br> everyone is dying <br><br>I think I'm gonna like this, thanks guys</br></br></br>  <br>You don't even fucking know</br>  <br>This needs to be updated for S3</br>  <br>RIP cute Zwei Wing fans</br>  <br>This need to be updated for GX.</br>  <br>So how does the intro to S3 fit into the charts?<br><br> OP posts the end of the arrow. <br> Several hundred posts later someone posts the beginning of the graph. </br></br></br></br>  <br>How about <br><br> There's a mountain in the way! Blow a hole in it! </br></br></br>  <br>Looking at Glorious Break's lyrics, it sounded like it described getting power out of desperation and embracing the consequences that come along with it. A long shot interpretation, though.<br><br>Kaneko did say that the ending credits song was going to give us an understanding for the tone of GX.</br></br></br>  <br> my fucking face when they just fucking blow like 1/3 of a mountain away </br>  <br> Kanade got replaced by Maria </br>  <br><br>Needs to be updated, S2 had some good eps (1-2, 10) and some really shitty ones (Maria being useless).</br></br>  <br>That chart is so old it's not even updated for when S2 was shit from episode 7-9 and then the ensuing QUALITY.</br>  I went into this show expecting non-lethal combat and battles ending in people being KOed, imagine my surprise to get this .  <br>Proper symphogear rhythm game for vita when</br>  <br>It was for the best. Maria is much cuter than, her voice is better, and cat hair &gt; bed hair</br>  <br>Plausible. If the dolls are so strong that their current gears aren't enough they might be forced into using Dainsleif even though it's probably cursed.</br>  <br>In a previous thread (that might have been on /m/ I forget) the chart went 3D.</br>  <br><br><br>Where have you people been?</br></br></br>  ITT: We make people read manga with one page.            So, can we all agree that GT is much better than Super?  <br>how is it not cannon you derp, its created by akira and it has a manga adaptation coming out along with the anime lmao silly human</br>  <br>Le's just agree you have shit taste, are you perhaps an amerinigger?</br>  <br>So far, yes.<br><br>GT was shit, but that was a fucking stupid first episode for Super. <br><br>It wasn't interesting in the slightest, at least GT had the (dumb) novelty of the black star dragon balls and a space journey. Super feels like a filler and the second episode doesn't look any better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> space journey <br> barely 20 episodes and every conflict had Goku saiyan it up  <br> that Muu bullshit <br> baby being a little shit until his big fight <br> Baby vs. Goku being actually bretty gud but Goku winning because he got a recharge after Baby's recharge machine got stomped <br> rest is dragons, literally. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no.</br>  Name of anime? I'd it an anime?  No, now fuck off.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/google/</br>  <br>Boku no pico</br>  3rd season when?    What do you guys think of Splatoon?  <br>I think I want to fuck those squid.</br>  <br>You and me both</br>  <br>Anbe approves<br>So much Japan is getting IkaMusume DLC!</br></br>  Left or right,/a/?  <br>Both</br>  <br>If the caliber is large enough I can probably get <br>both at once.</br></br>  <br>Left has nice clothes<br><br>but Right, no contest</br></br></br></blockquote>]
