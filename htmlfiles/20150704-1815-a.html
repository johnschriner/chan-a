[ Shibafu the best  <br>Reppuu<br>Fusou<br>Kongou</br></br></br>  laga  <br>烈風<br>扶桑<br>金剛</br></br></br>   (COMIC19) [Jouji Mujoh (Shinozuka George)] Hama-Pai (Kantai Collection -KanColle-) [English] [CGrascal] <br><br>I'll need two hands for this</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Chinkcolle or clonecolle refers to warship girls, the android and iOS based game that borrows from kancolle mechanics.<br>Piratecolle is the private server kancolle which got DDOS'd, and now slaps on some alternate sprites to call it a day.<br><br>Clonecolle has demo'd at E3, and it has the ambition of making a NA and international release (so App Store as well as Play store.) This is the most notable ripoff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Superior FMA series finally coming to Blu Ray:<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/6jIH-UbMP10  [ ]</br></br>  <br> B-But it doesn't matter!! <br>Your grasping now. Yes those things matter if you care about the characters. Your just being cynical to try to dismiss my points.</br></br>  <br>Kill your fuckingself</br>  <br> Ed and Al go off to fight in WWII. A badass ending like that can give way to a potential sequel. <br>I think its terrible. Japan can never get the fuck over itself and tying the FMA world to our world just so they jerk off to Japan more was generic as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah you're mature and cool don't worry. Watch K-ON with me and forget those immature losers.</br></br>  <br>But Brotherhood has already been released in BD OP, don't you dare to imply that the 2003 anime was any better than Brotherhood.<br><br>Although, I agree that 2003 had the best OP and ED, Brotherhood were a bit lame to be honest.</br></br></br>   you will never have a bro who sticks to you 24/7.   <br>Jouichirou had Souma when he was 23. Papa Nakiri being an heir of a mega business family would probably get married later than that, wouldn't he? Maybe he's the #1 when Jou was in middle school.</br>  <br>school aside, the fact remains that Erina got to meet Jouichirou as a kid and observe his cooking well enough to inspire her. I imagine her parents were around.</br>  <br><br>aka amplifies the flavor of things and increases appetitie; also onions, sea veggies, fish, miso, wine, balsamic vinegar</br></br>    I'd watch an entire anime with faces like these  Join the army they said. It'll be fun they said.  <br><br> OFFICIAL SONG OF THESE THREADS <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CPu<wbr>KWy0_cJ0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12756382 <br> timeskipped things that would be interesting <br>Turn on cspan.</br></br>  <br>Wehraboos and /pol/fags pls go and stay go.</br>  <br>loli is the only one who loves mc, you tell me</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8X-<wbr>QshkkDRg</wbr>  [ ]</br>    <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  Believe in Reina, she is Mary of our time. She will deliver Taki some healthy children  to build a band .   Takino: well anyway, it doesn't matter who you like since you're going to get rejected anyway. <br> Shuuichi: why are you deciding that for yourself? <br> Takino: Because if you get a girlfriend too, it'll piss me off.  <br><br>Takino confirmed to be on suicide watch next year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>slut kun looks like boku girl</br>  <br>Depends. Join on the middle of the school year because I'm a transfer student? I would go for alto saxophone and make my harem there since it'd be easier with slut lipstick-chan who would make things easier. I'd love to join the fagotts too but it'd be hard to score anything there since best girl A and best girl B are pretty much closer to each other and oboe only think about making those fucking reeds.<br><br> If you mean join on next year after they bombed on nationals I'd obviously join percussion and start my harem there just like Tanabe-senpai did and enjoy drumming-chan cuteness every single day while living the dream.</br></br></br>  <br>Shuuichi and Gotou seem so based compared to their hormone addled peers</br>  <br>Nozomi enters when shes 3rd year, they win gold at Nationals.</br>  Let's all come together and love Lain.  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  Done! Took a while to organize and I don't have the last few pages but I'll get on to tracking those down.<br>Enjoy.<br>http://imgur.com/a/g01nt</br></br>  <br>Nice. Thanks for this.</br>  <br>No problem. I might upload some of the songs/movies/audio from the bootleg album to youtube or something in a few.</br>  <br>Omega good job</br>  Remember when they would make an English version of an opening theme of a dub? Whatever happened to that? Why did that stop, because weeabooism became mainstream? Nowadays it feels like they aren't trying anymore and don't care as much.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=m4J<wbr>UZhF9Kx8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WUW<wbr>2hRQkegM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Guyver <br> dub OP is superior <br><br>Fuck no.</br></br></br></br>  The Skullman and Speed Grapher had english ops. Skullman's was very ominous and felt it was better than the original.  <br> implying <br>https://<span>youtu.be/Wy6ZKWq9Yug  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Because even decent English dubs of OP's are vastly inferior to the original music used. I adore the Ultimate Muscle OP but god damn is Hustle Muscle the better song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kID<wbr>VMcjHKVI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dread the prospect of returning to a world where dubbing companies cheap out and make shitty new songs rather than pay for the proper OP.

"loli sexual abuse manga" is a bit too vague.</br></br>  Your favourite mango is now animated by Toei.<br><br>How fucked are you?<br><br> not 90's Toei, but current Toei that made Toriko and Sailor Moon Crystal </br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no cute girls or proper fujobait in my favorite manga, so I'd have to go with Toei by default.</br>  <br>fuck everything kyoani<br>toei isnt that great but i enjoy what i get<br> but hurrr my pacing <br>who fucking cares you are set for 50 eps</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need nightmares, so I won't be even imagining it.</br>  <br>LN haremshit by toei.<br>will /a/ watch it?</br></br>  <br>yeah fuck those guys. WT doesnt have much chapters left all thanks to the author. Plus, theyre doing 2 chapters per episode too.</br>  Why is JoJo so popular when its gayer than a pride parade?  <br> eating Kakyoin <br>monster  image </br></br>  <br> eating Kakyoin <br>monster </br></br>  JoJo overall is kind of shitty.

What a goddamned beast that we should all aspire to be like</br>  A demon holds a book, in which are written the sins of a particular man; an Angel drops on it from a phial, a tear which the sinner had shed in doing a good action, and his  /ai/ - Idle Activities  are washed out.  <br>Blond, fluffy hair, blue eyes, twintails, cat ears and tail, Californian, sparkly personality, mildly tsundere, singer, dancer, idol<br><br>She is made of all parts perfection.</br></br></br>  I wonder if he calls her onee-sama in bed.  <br>Well that's the ED so there's no harm.</br>  <br> MÄRCHEN  ?! </br>  yoroshikutteyo<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hmsrjljtms.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  What's your favorite thing about Aoi Yuuki?  <br>Wow, didn't know she was only 19 and already one of the best GEHs around.</br>  <br>I'm going to write her and use です at the end of every sentence. I'll post results if I get a reply.</br>  <br>What's GEH?</br>  <br> 3DPD <br>Why are these allowed? Their voice alone has to do with anime, but all anyone ever posts are Photoshopped magazine pictures and circlejerk over disgusting 3DPD.<br><br>Isn't this what /s/ is for?</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hOn<wbr>OLOdVKJA</wbr>  [ ]  Talk about the new show or the movie here<br><br>previous thread got deleted<br><br>Fukkatsu no F is being subbed by an anon here since no one else in the english sub community is doing it</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know what that word means but I'll use it anyway </br>  <br>I never got the feeling Frieza has even the slightest chance of winning in that fight. <br> SSGSS Goku <br> SSGSS Vegeta <br> Beerus <br> Whis <br>hell he couldn't even beat Goku without cheating little alone beating Vegeta and Whis/Beerus.<br><br> jobber <br>yeah people use that word wrong a lot but you get his point. He means Pushover.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   not knowing spanish   <br>I was hoping Freeza would actually cut his losses and survive. They just use him as a learning opportunity, while he himself learns nothing. What would the movie be like if he had trained just a bit longer?</br>  <br>the explanation we get is that he is a prodigy and has never trained. So in order to beat Goku, he goes and trains for a while</br>  How will the manga end?  <br> 9 hours later <br>The artist fell off her bicycle and almost died</br></br>  <br>Just like Tomoko.</br>  <br> Not crouching </br>  <br>If Tomoko badly hurt herself would people be nice to her?</br>  <br>People are nice to her anyways. It's just her own paranoia that makes her think otherwise.</br></blockquote>]
