[ It seems Uta really fooled everybody and everyone believes his lies.<br>  /s  </br>  playing the devil's advocate here but if they really did know he's a ghoul why didnt they attack? especially urine.  <br>They were probably trusting Haise's decision here, Urine himself said Haise isnt an idiot.</br>  <br>hmm i guess so. twas a good chapter tho, imo. cant wait to see their masks</br>  <br>They're going to get dragged down the same path as Kaneki aren't they?</br>  <br>too early to tell i'd day. the only Q that remotely displays any red flag is only urie</br>   "Doesn't this guy look exactly like a ghoul?"  <br> "I feel like I've heard this voice before" <br><br>Why the Qs are so fucking stupid?</br></br></br>  <br>only tooru</br>  <br>Haise is just double buffing him.<br>Just wait for him to ask, you ever seen the film gay ghouls say no.<br><br>That's how they caught Arata.</br></br></br></br>  Man, I didn't expect that Ui would be such a hater. What the hell is this justice crap, this is one of the many thing the Qs should of been made for, going undercover as ghouls.  <br> undercover as ghouls. <br>But Haise is a ghoul. If anything he's going undercover as a human.<br>Maybe he either fears that he would turn or go crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>And apple head too</br>  <br>What are you talking about? This is Hasie plan, he wants to do this.</br>  <br> His name is Haise Sasaki. This name was given to Ken Kaneki after fatally wounding a certain ghoul investigator... <br>So. Seems like Kaneki's reputation has bloated in the underworld information network of the ghoul world, huh?</br></br>  <br>I think he meant Ui.<br>Kaneki isn't exactly the most stable person around actual ghouls, especially the ones he used to be close to.<br>So do we have any info on what became of the Owl dude? he was a cool old man.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant on Ui's side. It looked like he was there with Arima during the initial training. he must have seen what a liability Haise would be if he lost it. <br><br>My guess is that though Arima training he progressively got harder to take down. during that bit with Nishiki, they had to 1v7 and snipe him.</br></br></br>  <br>It was shown in Ui's flashback or something Haise losing control. <br>What if under those 2 years Kaneki came back or something and almost managed to kill Arima while he was trying to stop him?</br></br>  <br>Huh. Is that an Owl mask in the 2nd to the last panel? It's not exactly like the ones Yoshimura and past Eto formed, but it looks somewhat similar, doesn't it?</br>  <br><br><br>I don't think so. <br>IIRC he nearly killed Amon, and got badly injured himself, before fighting Arima.</br></br></br></br>  I refuse to believe Ui is a grown man.  <br> IIRC he nearly killed Amon, and got badly injured himself, before fighting Arima. <br>Oh yeah. My mind immediately leapt to Arima since Kanae said it was given to him after wounding a ghoul investigator, but Amon makes a lot more sense.</br></br>  Anyway. Apart from Haise, it seems like there are implications of Arima's students being pretty competitive about their rankings, huh?  So just how fucking powerful/insane does a ghoul need to be to even have a shot against Arima?<br>SSS+?<br>I've read a bit of TG;JACK and it seems like this guy was just born that good. Sounds like bullshit to me.</br></br>  <br>Why do people think Ui is jealous because muh Arima?</br>  <br>I said IMPLICATIONS, anon. The other guy with Ui was the one who brought it up.</br>  <br><br>Man, I feel so bad for Amon. Can you imagine how he feels like, now he's a half-Ghoul? Since he's Catholic, he probably thinks he's damned. Not "Oh, now I have superpowers" but as in "I am a damned thing. I am a cannibal horror. How the fuck did this happen?"<br><br>He probably thinks he somehow deserves it for betraying Ghoul dad, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean Take is the one all the other students shit on?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he feels about the same as Kaneki did when it happened to him.<br><br>However, I don't remember him turning half ghoul, but I imagine it was the same experiment that the Qs went through.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't even need to speak. It's in their eyes! They're looking down on him! But soon! SOON! He'll show them. He'll show them all! Every dog has its day!</br>  <br>Why are y'all so certain that Amon is a full-fledged one-eye? All the signs seem to say that the attempt to make him into a ghoul failed somehow.</br>  Saiko, shes one of us right?  <br><br>Not really. The Qs are deriative of Kaneki; They're the second-generation process, and even more watered down. Amon is likely a half-Ghoul, since they have that Doctor with them. (Because really, the Qs are piss-weak.)<br><br><br><br>Narratively, it's the only thing that makes sense. Amon being killed offscreen simply isn't dramatically interesting. He's definitely a one-eyed ghoul; Frankly, the story seems to imply he's one who broke free and is operating as Batman. Like, what else would he do, as a character? The role of 'insane weapon' is already filled by Takizawa, so Amon is clearly going to be a contrast to him.<br><br>I'm perfectly certain that Amon is going to be emo as fuck, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would also make sense that he broke free with Kuro there, Kuro knows and respects Amon after all.</br>  <br>So was/is Kaneki full ghoul or still half ghoul? And could the Qs become as powerful as some other ghouls be doing what Kaneki did?<br><br>If i'm remember it right, RC cells come from the ghoul liver, which was the exact organ Kaneki had implanted from Rize, right? Doesn't that count a full ghoul?</br></br></br>  Of cool. They're making a TG;JACK OVA.  Uta is gay right?  <br> Narratively, it's the only thing that makes sense. <br>It was in TG, yes.<br>  Amon being killed offscreen simply isn't dramatically interesting.  <br>Yes, and it wouldn't make sense either.<br>  He's definitely a one-eyed ghoul <br>Have you decided to ignore all and any mentions of floppy? He kills some ghouls and outsiders say the corpses were cannibalized. Yet we see that he has one of the one-eye twins with him, and likely had her cannibalize the corpse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's still a half-Ghoul. Sure, he might be as powerful as a full Ghoul - but he's still fundamentally a half-Ghoul. I fully expect Urie to degenerate further, though.<br><br>Actually, the whole 'passing as Ghouls' idea is pretty stupid, since we've established that Ghouls can tell that something's up. Then again, maybe Kaneki just wants to get in touch with his roots or something. I mean, I dunno; If I was in his shoes, minus the amnesia, I would do everything I could to act as human as possible. The only analogy I could possibly think of is a white man waking up as an armed nigger, and the police are breaking down the fucking door.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not ignoring any mentions of Floppy. Honestly, I think he's probably Amon. I don't see how that contradicts my statement, actually.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, there's no point in Aogiri not turning a dove into a ghoul. That desperation and need to eat flesh is something they need to turn them to their side, after all.<br><br>As an aside<br> (Because really, the Qs are piss-weak.) <br>Consider that 3 of them didn't even go to the academy like Urie, who's been shown taking down lesser ghouls (by which I mean, unimportant ghoul fodder) with ease on his own.<br><br>Although Shirazu's ukaku isn't strong, it's by no means weak. Of the ghouls that could block it, there was no doubt they were strong. And the regeneration his kakuhou has granted him has been a great help. He's not a powerful ghoul, but he's a good dove. He's got room for improvement.<br><br>Saiko is a mystery, but the implications of her rinkaku being powerful are strong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> RC cells come from the ghoul liver <br>No, that was a lie. Kanou said he needed to transplant a new liver into Kaneki to help him live, but what he actually did was implant Rize's kakuhou into him. The liver story was just a cover-up for the press.</br></br>  <br> since we've established that Ghouls can tell that something's up <br>What do you mean here? I don't really understand what you're referring to exactly.</br></br>  <br>Kaneki is already a full ghoul actually, his cells stopped being human a long time ago, like the doctor showed in the last chapter.<br>However, he is still human in mind and morally.</br></br>  <br>Based Sharkbro with his missile launcher ukaku.<br>You know there's gonna be a scene far into :re where he'll use that to wipe out a whole group of fodder ghouls  and maybe seriously injure a more powerful ghoul for his squad. </br></br>  <br>There really isn't a difference between ghouls and half-ghouls, though, right? Except for half-ghouls tasting "better" (or at least different) from other ghouls and only having one kakugan.</br>  <br>There is actually, the doctor showed us last chapter. Half-ghouls like the Qs dont have the RC cells running through their whole body, Kaneki however, has RC cells running through his whole body because of the torture and the continuous regeneration he did back in TG, his body is fully ghoul, different than the Qs that are just humans with kakuhou's by now, Urie is the one that is trying to get like kaneki though.<br>And there's the one-eye thing and that kaneki cant eat human food.</br></br>  I really liked this chapter, Seeing Uta interact with the q's was something i didnt know i wanted until it happened. Also that scene at the end with him telling yomo.<br><br>I have no idea if he's a good, bad or neutral character, I cant wait until we finally find out, itll be a good chapter then. <br><br>Im getting excited for the manga, it feels like the plot is moving forward more and more. <br><br> Also Uta is totally 100% gay r-right? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't wait to see everyone freak the fuck out when they see Haise with his old mask when they go investigating in the goul world  <br>he has a boyfriend, so yeah im pretty sure he is.</br>  <br>my cocks gonna be so fucking hard</br>  <br>Wait, did you misunderstand me? I'm comparing half-ghouls to ghouls. Ghouls can also get stronger by regenerating from injuries, right?</br>  <br> I think he's probably Amon <br>Come on, Ishida doesn't same face that hard to not identify him.</br></br>  <br>No, Ghouls cant get stronger from regenerating from injuries. When a half-ghoul gets injured and regenerates, the place that was injured originally had human cells, after the regeration it gets replaced with ghoul cells that are stronger than human's.</br>  <br>Don't think so. Most ghouls are kagune use heavy so it's hard to tell if they get stronger than they normally are.<br><br>It would explain Banjou's gains though.</br></br></br>  <br>It has been mentioned multiple times that one eyed ghouls smell peculiar. Especially Kaneki, who smells like a female (rize).</br>  <br>Would also make sense with Jason, actually.</br>  <br>Yes, but that's for ghouls with an excellent sense of smell. Not all ghouls are like that.</br>  <br>Amon is really gonna leave humanity behind then.</br>  <br> boyfriend <br>whait? what?</br></br>  <br>He's just calling Yomo Uta's boyfriend, I believe. Probably in jest.</br>  <br>Yomo.<br>The guy who took over Anteiku. They've been together for years.</br></br>  <br>mostly in jest, but it would not surprise me.</br>  Apparently, it's okay for Kijima to upload ISIS-like videos on CCG official site, but "it's bad for the image of champions of justice" to dress up as ghouls and go undercover.  <br>Uta is bisexual master race. You know he's making a mess out of Itori as well.</br>  <br>CCG is ISIS confirmed</br>  <br>Floppy's been called a failure, something to be finished off/put out of its misery. Doesn't really scream successful owl to me.</br>  <br>Failure could mean that they didnt managed to brainwash him like Seido.</br>  <br><br>I think the reason why they call Amon a failure is because he didn't fulfill Eto's expectations (since she said she's interested in him during the Kanou lab raid arc). He's most likely a full OEG but his abilities like regeneration or the use of his Kagune are probably not highly developed similar to Banjou.</br></br>   http://imperialscans.com/read/toky<wbr>o-ghoul-re/38-a-certain-m/1</wbr> <br>Here we go</br>  <br>Isn't it made fairly clear that Fura is being fulla shit?</br>  <br>This was a really nice chapter lol. I like how much scope Ishida has between tragic, comedy and battles.</br>  <br><br><br>I still want to know what the CCG is feeding Haise. Like if the Q's had no idea Haise was ghoul until he met Nishiki again, and he can pass for a normal human, is he eating normal food in public? Did they lower his RC cell count just below the point that he needs to eat flesh, or is he just faking it and they're actually providing him with human flesh from the morgue or something? What gives?</br></br></br>   I became friends with Sasaki <br>Uta a cute. CUTE.</br>  <br>At the end of Tokyo Ghoul, he was in a tank in the mad doctor's lab, so he's probably still being held by the Aogiri Tree in some way.</br>  <br><br><br>Did I miss something? I don't remember them ever showing Amon together with Kuro or Shiro in Re:. Granted it would be a likely scenario given their shared history but at this point I assumed that was only a fan theory.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't eat human food, the CCG is probably feeding him the liquified ghouls that Eto told Amon about.</br>  When are Kenki and Arima gonna double dip Eto?  I kek'd  <br>Uta and Saiko are hilarious together.</br>  <br>Fura didn't say that, Ui did.</br>  <br>Serves them right for trying to recreate based Kanekipede.</br>  <br>The real final fight.</br>  <br>Honestly, I think he'll go full-on crazy Gourmet if he thinks that it's impossible for Haise to regain his memories as Kaneki.</br>  <br>I completely forgot about that plot. Christ it's taking so long to answer some questions that I forget they exist.</br>  <br>Good chapter. <br><br>Hyped for everyone's mask and Ui being fucking salty when he finds out that Sasaki still went with the mask plan.</br></br></br>  <br> Uta was the auctioneer and he talked to Mutsuki directly. She didn't recognize Uta's voice <br> Urine, Shirazu and Haise fought Kanae in Auction arc. They didn't recognize Kanae, especially Urine who has a keen sense of smell <br> Shirazu thinks Uta is probably a ghoul but Mutsuki doesn't worry about it, Saiko doesn't give two fucks and Urine wants to trust the dumbest guy Haise so he doesn't do anything. <br>I just gave up. Qs' heads are full of shit.<br><br> &gt;after fatally wounding a certain ghoul investigator <br>So CCG still thinks Kaneki killed Amon? Why the fuck Akira didn't tell anyone about the possibility of Amon being alive since she knows Takizawa is walking around as a fucking ghoul? Fuck this shit.<br><br>Those fags are delusional, anon. Ui just doesn't trust Arima's pet since Ui sees him as merely ghoul. Well, I agree with him and Shirazu, all this plan of pretending to be ghouls seems pretty dangerous. Hopefully Uta is going to do fun things so that Haise and Qshit will get BTFO by real ghouls like Matsumae or Nishiki.<br><br> Amon <br> emo <br>He's not Kaneki. He even didn't get his hair white like whiny Seidou and Kuroneki. Amon is a strong-willed man, he is still fighting ghouls when he is probably a half-ghoul, and Kurona might be helping him. And unlike Haise, Amon has been doing serious shit in this timeskip  Heck, Amon was a strong guy as human, but now he is a half-ghoul and is cannibalizing. This man is the real deal, he will be a monster </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He went to Uta's shop before discussing with Ui though.</br>  <br> So CCG still thinks Kaneki killed Amon? Why the fuck Akira didn't tell anyone about the possibility of Amon being alive since she knows Takizawa is walking around as a fucking ghoul? Fuck this shit. <br>I do think they know Amon is Floppy.<br><br>Anyway, Kaneki really did fatally wound Amon. He'd have died without treatment.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that you overestimate how well people can remember smells or voices. They saw these ghouls once, and they will have heard literally a hundred other voices and smelled hundreds of more people since then. I can accept that as realistic writing, it's actually more bullshit to make characters perfectly memorize the smell/voice of somebody they've only briefly met once.</br></br>  <br>Clearly the key factor was Rize and a mother complex.</br>  <br>Ui is just being a fucking cunt. It's not like the public will ever know about the Qs going undercover as ghouls.</br>  <br>I don't see him ever really giving up on Kaneki.<br><br> What I want to see is his reaction to Hinami being locked up now that we know he misses her too </br></br></br>  ITT: best girls of their respective series    <br> pic unrelated </br>      <br><br><br>true<br><br><br>not true</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>i didn't even watch is and i know you're wrong</br>  <br>You really do love her don't you</br>  <br>Why not true?</br>        <br>Yes.

Seeing them laugh like that together was really cute</br></br>  <br>it's perdy gud</br>  <br>That episode, man<br>Damn, that guitar, man<br>I fucking love that episode, the best one-episode of the series.

I'm not sure how much I like her shipping of Gin and Hijikata but she's got the general dynamic between them down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there actually people who still don't know the core audience watching and financing Gintama?<br><br> Fujoshit stronk </br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah. One chapter where they finally get along is the reason to ship. Yeah nah.</br>  <br>But when you go to /a/ you don't expect to find a thread of fujoshits. There are no women on the internet, silly!</br>  Why did Gin stop drinking strawberry milk? It's been so long since I've seen him with any.  <br>Because he was drunk. That's your damn keyword. And he's repulsed by it when he finds out, so no.</br>  <br>It's no secret around here that Gintama panders to fujo, the show it's self jokes about it occasionally.</br>  <br>Gorilla doesn't actually tease the fujoshits that often. This and the Soul Switch arc are the most he's done. There's also the Scandal arc for those who ship him with Madao, but I don't see there being many.<br><br>And before you ask, the episode with the two chained together is anime filler.</br></br></br>   healthy grown up Kagura in the movie   <br> One chapter <br>You wot m8, Gintama is pretty gay</br></br>  <br>The fake yaoi dvd covers are anime filler</br>  <br>Never said it was.

From Kagura to Gin buttfucking Hijikata.  <br>You'd be surprised by all the "omg ginhiji canon" cries after this chapter. Fucking annoying.</br>  <br>From 13 year old tumblr grils then I guess? Somehow I really doubt the jap fujos would believe that for real</br>  <br>None. But drunk people do stupid and weird stuff they don't normally do, and Gintama exaggerates anything.<br><br>It was a punchline to add to Gintoki's horror, who is disgusted with himself for it.

The stress, age, and fatigue really show.</br>  <br>Jesus, how old is she?</br>  <br>Part getting older, part harsh lighting</br>  <br>Even if he actually was bi I'm pretty sure he'd still be disgusted at the thought of fucking Hasegawa</br>  <br> Hijikata on the list <br> Not Tae <br>I know she's not worth much, but come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh-huh, or something like that. She said it makes her seem cute.</br>  <br>she's the manliest of all of them</br>  <br>This.

That should be proof enough that Gin accepts the possibility of him fucking Madao which doesn't sound very straight at all. He doesn't even object to it on the grounds of him being straight.<br><br>Punchline was indeed him being disgusted but once again, he believes Madao.<br><br>Would a 100% straight guy so readily believe he fucked an older man?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because not only do they fit well together, they get great ship tease.</br>  <br>36.</br>  <br>Yeah this. He also wouldn't want to risk upsetting his fujo audience</br>  <br>Every time</br>  <br>He already thought he'd fucked 5 women he knew. He was already at a low point and willing to believe anything.</br>  <br>And here I thought asian aged well</br>  <br>I don't think it'll be because he doesn't want to upset his audience, but simply because he doesn't want him to pair up with anybody at the end.</br>  <br>Her beard would only fuel the fujoishi. In fact anything that is not the definition of female would inspire them to make even more Gin x Hijikata djs.</br>  <br> "Did I fuck 5 women yesterday? That means I probably fucked a man too!" <br><br>How gay do you have to be to even think that logic is solid?</br></br></br>  <br>...I meant that he was willing to believe anything at that point, simply because of how out there it was for him to fuck OTOSE in the first place.</br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>  <br>Fuck this, I'll drop it and stand by my point that the circumstances doesn't work to prove that Gintoki is bisexual.</br>  <br>What the fuck happened, any chance we can move the thread in a better direction?<br><br>Like towards best girl?</br></br></br>  <br> Expect something nice from Gintama <br> Be disappointed by the outcome <br>It's like the real deal.  GinxMadao OTP </br></br></br>    <br>I've always wondered, is it just one or two vocal Tsukuyofags, or do people here actually like her?</br>  <br>He doesn't give a fuck pissing off about fujos. Otherwise, he wouldn't made the Love Potion arc.</br>  <br> But what doujin was it? This? http://g.e-hentai.org/g/809420/9d3b<wbr>987f79/</wbr> </br>  <br> not wanting the magical fujobucks <br>Making one panderish arc is a different thing from ending the manga with Gintoki marrying Tsukuyo and having five children. The latter would completely kill the appeal of the series for fujos.</br></br>  <br>Well the series would be ended at that point anyway. I'm told that while the fujoshi are consistently interested in Gintama, they're far from the only ones keeping it afloat, and many of them aren't as interested as they used to be. It's not a new series after all.</br>  <br>Judging by the polls I've seen before, it does seem to me that people here like her a lot. What, you don't?</br>  <br>Well, I wouldn't say I hate her, but I definitely don't like her either. She's not funny, and just isn't my type.</br>  <br>Each to our own then. I find she has a great design and a cool character, which makes her funny moments even better for me.</br>  <br>Tae isn't taken yet (though she's getting close) and Hijikata is not a serious choice at all. There's nothing romantic there from either Gintoki or Hijikata, they just finally acknowledged their friendship. Madao has a higher chance and Gintoki was disgusted about that.</br>  <br>They know the homo helps with sales.</br>  <br>Most people would be repulsed if they found out they fucked a dirty, homeless man. Madao may be a bro, but god knows when was the last time he showered.</br>  <br>There is non-yaoi porn though, it's just very rarely scanlated. With Tsukuyo we have that funny one and the 4 NTR ones. There's also some on pixiv, just not doujins.</br>   All these perverts <br>Please do not sexualize the Gura! She is not for that! She is a daughteru.</br>  <br> romantic <br> implying what everyone wants isn't just to see them hatefuck eachother </br></br>  <br>You're too late for that anon, this thread has now turned into  It's time </br>  <br>Well as you said he did treat him like a dog though, and not seriously like the girls. And he does object to how that one stands out.</br>  <br>Thats fine, just don't sexualize Kagura.</br>  Shinsengumi episodes are the best ones.  <br>Maybe we'll get shinsengumi space adventures now?</br>  Serious question, did they fuck, Hijikata and Senzou?  <br>Often, in Gin's bathroom when he isn't around.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>I'm slightly ashamed that I know exactly which doujin it was.<br><br><br>It's already been translated. There's an eng version somewhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>white people age consistantly, and can be accelerated by being in stress<br><br>asian people age in spurts, with middle aged and ancient ancestor being right next to eachother, and stress just makes you jump up a tier.</br></br></br>  <br> Which was it? </br>  <br>Don't be. Harada is gaining some momentum and she did a great job finding a way to sell graphic rape, mindbreak, torture and similar themes to the fujoishi audience.<br><br>And if you liked the prisoner one, there's a really interesting one too about Hijikata getting stuck in a wall. She managed to turn Gin's indifference and airheadedness into a brilliant form of abuse.</br></br></br>   It's a Madao episode   <br>Okay what the fuck</br>  <br/>  <br> Gintoki x Hijikata </br>  <br>This anime got it all. <br><br>Best waifu. Even the scars are pretty.</br></br></br>  <br>Need more lewds like this</br>  <br>What are you, a faggot?</br>  <br>So there's fujoshi in the thread. Who'd have thought.</br>  <br>Hijikata gets stuck in a wall, head on one side and ass on the other, because Gin asked him to check out a hole. Gin then  has buttsex that is borderline rape with Hijikata . When he's finished he promises to seek help and takes off. He gets hungry though and figures he should first get something to eat with the wallet he "borrowed" from Hijikata. Meanwhile some  middle-aged men find Hijikata's ass and decide to use him as a toilet/gangrape him . Gin however is still eating and enjoying himself so he can't hear  Hijikata's cries for help . When he finally gets back, he cheerfully greets Hijikata from the face-side of the wall, apologizes for taking so long and starts making the hole in the wall bigger. He seems completely indifferent to  Hijikata's obvious crying/tears running down his face . Last shot we see is  Hijikata's ass all covered in semen, condoms and written above him 'free **** toilet' or something . We don't see what happens next and how/whether Gin reacts to it.<br><br>Hope I did a good job spoilering it. <br><br>Oh and that's a typical Harada dj.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukuyo is a miracle no girl in gintama can defeat her</br>  <br> There are people still falling for this </br>  <br> Alright that does sound kind of hot  but still, fuck off</br>  <br> no girl in gintama can defeat her <br>How about no</br></br>  <br>Falling for what?</br>  <br>I wonder if we'll ever see Kagura fight like she did in the Yoshiwara arc.</br>  <br><br>Endgame vs Kamui.</br></br>  <br>Best Kagura episodes?</br>  <br>The umbrella one</br>  <br> that name <br>Koreans</br></br>  <br>I want a SoL spin off about the Yato family.</br>  <br>Hope she gets raped by nigger dick</br>    <br>Miracle girl and best girl yes, but Kagura and Mutsu are probably stronger.</br>  Why she is so perfect?  Anyone remember that episode where there's Gin,Hijikata,Otae and Kondo go to a ramen stand but you don't see their faces, then at the end it implies Gin x Otae action but then it turns out it wasn't them at all and was just exaggerated caricatures with the same VA? (E.g. Kondo was a literal gorilla) Best fucking reveal aside from the one where Gin is revealed to fucked Madao.  <br>That ending was the best thing. It's from episode 156 by the way.</br>  <br>Kagura, Sacchan, Mutsu, Nobume, Kyubei, and probably Matako can defeat her<br><br>Gonna be long, close fights though</br></br></br>  <br><br> Kagura <br> close fight with anyone but the top 5 of the Gintama universe <br><br>Nigga, she was Housen-tier in berserk mode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jokes on you. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hZ0<wbr>NzYtE5jI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>And Tsukuyo is just as capable of beating most of them. Mutsu and Kagura would definitely be the hardest ones, though she did surprisingly well against Kagura in their only fight.</br>  <br>The girls are pretty much equal in terms of power, motivation and willpower would be the deciding factor since it's Gintama</br>  <br>Yeah, it's the same for most of the high tier characters. The Yato tend to have an advantage due to their strength and self-healing abilities (It's easy to forget, but they have this, just check Benizakura or Kagura's introduction episode) though</br>  <br>The girls vary wildly in terms of power except that you don't get to see that often because they usually serve as comic reliefs.<br><br>Sa-chan for example is supposedly one of the best ninjas out there with extraordinary skills and perfect aim. She spends most of her screentime being an idiotic BDSM fangirl though. Then you have the Yato's like Kagura who could probably wreck all the other human girls together.</br></br></br>  <br>Fights between most of them are still gonna be pretty close. Even if the Yato are stronger by default, that's not always gonna be enough.</br>  This fanmade ED looks so good you'd almost think it was official<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6nw<wbr>fQdXP0pU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> strawberry milky <br>i didnt know kagura was the kind of girl to do it during her period</br></br>  <br> yfw it means alcohol <br> yfw its canon <br><br>I can't wait for the guardians arc</br></br></br></br>  China is my weakness  <br>"To be".

Which selector would you infect/spread?  Peeping Analyze ch 10 raws when?

I wish we better have when we get more material to discuss and yes, 2016 is going to be awesome, but to be honest we will get the movie here subbed by 2017.  <br>It's card art.</br>    Sorry, no Re/verse chapter whichever trans yet. I did, however, see a cute Tama cosplayer and had the Ruuko and Tama Nendroids bought from right under my nose. I'll be getting that new Tamayorihime fig for sure though.  Did WIXOSS motivated you to do something different?  <br>There's a WIXOSS related thing coming in 2016? That's good news to me.</br>  <br>There is a movie coming.</br>   You know what I'm going to say   <br>There is going to be a Piruluk level 5 figma.</br>  Is Asenshi dead?<br><br>Did Akasutski kill it?<br><br>Why is Shitoe so shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I fuck it?</br>  Would you DO it?  HA HA<br>TIME FOR WIXOSS</br>          <br>This is short. Maybe tomorrow? I'm sure the thread will last for a couple days.</br>        How did the Midoriko guy to become an eternal girl?    <br>Is it a GK?</br>  I didn't know Ulith had this kind of assets to. What is she planning? Making people loathe themselves because of her music? Damn she is awesome.  So I watched first season, greatly enjoyed episodes 7/8 but then it declined. Didn't watch second season, heard it sucked.<br><br>Is there any reason to be hype?</br></br>  WEBXOSS now has a replay mode, also here's a couple of winning decklists from a WPS<br>http://pastebin.com/3MZcC5F2#6030</br>  <br>Because it's mostly guaranteed Destructed will FIX something in both Spread and Infected.  Or that's what at least we hope </br>  <br>Not for you, apparently. Enjoy your deconstruction ending and stay deluded.</br>  <br>Is this a new meme?<br><br>Another anon said the same thing in the last thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Ruu is cute</br>  <br>Hype for OKADA and maybe a manga cameo in the movie. <br><br>I honestly enjoyed spread, I don't think it was a masterpiece or anything like that but it definitely was my autumn 2014 AOTS. Wixoss threads were fun too.</br></br></br>  So it was supposed to have a 3rd cour where it went 100% relentlessly grimdark but they pussied out, right?<br><br> Right? </br></br>  WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?<br>WHAT DOES IT FUCKING MEAN!?</br>  <br> Hype for OKADA and maybe a manga cameo in the movie. <br> Spin-off cameo in a movie <br>Neither Oriko or Kazumi related stuff appeared in Madoka Magica. I already lost all my faith in that happening yet Takara Tommy guys could do something since they are so fucking based, like in the end of Spread.</br></br></br>  Speaking of Okada, since these threads often devolved into talking about her.<br><br>Is anyone here hype for Mobile Okada Gundam: TEKKETSU?</br></br>  <br>It can't really be worse than the last couple of Gundams.</br>  <br>I'm definitely going to watch it, even though I haven't watched any other Gundam</br>  <br>Yes I am. Everyone shits on M3 so I do, but there are literally a few good things in the series meanwhile I was watching it I was thinking how nice it would be if Gundam had them and now I just need to wait.</br>  H Y P E <br>I N T E N S I F I E S</br>  <br> city in ruins <br>WHAT COULD THIS MEAN</br></br>  <br><br>That the city got destructed, obviously.</br></br>  Is it okay if I can label Studio Pablo amazing work as somekind of Impressionism?    <br>Is this a good idea? I've always been curious about Gundam so I might give it a shot as well.</br>  <br>The backgrounds in Onslaught of the End were fantastic</br>  <br>This is bullshit!</br>  <br>Are you sure?</br>  I want to fuck Piruruk.  <br>S-Stop.</br>    <br> different filename <br>Off yourself m8<br><br><br>There we go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  I want to fuck Ulith  <br>But Ulith doesn't seem interesed in feelings. She is most likely to use you as a fucking pawn then get rid of you in the most convenient moment.</br>  <br>as long as my dick goes in it at some point, that's fine by me.</br>  <br> inserting dick in a sociopath </br>  How many tickets will be sold?  <br>I think it depends of the number of people who plays WIXOSS in Japan.</br>  Just be honest on this one. What is WIXOSS's truly appeal to you?<br>What charmed you one year ago to this threads?</br>  <br><br>all dem bitches be cray cray</br></br>  <br>Honestly?<br><br>The cute grills in the pic, and eventually  the incest </br></br></br>  I'm still waiting Fanbook scans.<br> ;_; </br>  <br> pic related <br>Also suffering.</br></br>  <br>Yes. What about you?</br>  <br>I don't actually remember. I might have just been interested by the summary and watched it since nothing else is coming to mind as a possible reason.</br>  <br> Waiting for the OST </br>  first time playing webxoss and nip guy quit on me after my first move<br><br>Where do I git gud enough to ride with the nips?</br></br>  <br>Seems like you will have to wait a couple of years for the Movie's OST now.  So I will. What is your favorite track? </br>  <br> Haven't listened to it in a while. Probably 15, can't beat the tanoshii.  <br><br>Has anyone ever uploaded the second OST on nyaa?</br></br></br>  <br>I was waiting for someone to upload it in .FLAC but I keep waiting. But as far as I know it seems it never happened but you could easily find Spread's OST in a couple of seconds.</br>    <br> I was waiting for someone to upload it in .FLAC <br>That's what I was waiting for. I remember someone said something about it.</br></br>      <br>fun</br>    Remember when this happened?  <br>Who is that boy?</br>  <br>A big guy.</br>    <br>For  Ru u</br>  <br>Only because same director as  Toradora. </br>  <br>Yuzuki and when we said Ruuko was going to destroy the world through a misinterpreted tetris reference.</br>  <br>I love how much overlap there is between Wixoss, YuYuYu and Symphogeah!? fanbases. In can drop in on any thread and know Im in for a good time, every time. <br><br><br><br>I wonder if we will ever get anything out of this or the Ruu is scary hints from season one in the new movie</br></br></br></br></br>    Mayu is so fucking cute. I would teach her the wonders of life.  <br>The concept seemed interesting. Really loved the series at first, was in almost every thread and wanted to watch the fanbase expand with stuff on the games. As it went on and the second season came out, it got less and less enjoyable as a whole.</br>  BATORU!  WE<br>CRY<br>"OPEN"</br></br>    WE CRY NOPAN  <br><br><br>I don't follow</br></br></br>  <br> looking forward to an anime that only exists to promote trading cards <br>Oh, how the mighty have fallen.</br></br>  <br>It seems you are not aware of the virtous circle of anime and commercial production.</br>  <br>My wish is that you "wouldn't" skip the opening</br>  KING OF GAMES!    Go nuts!  <br>I tried.</br>  <br>Oh, it's from S2. No wonder.</br>  <br>I hope we get the second season soon. I can't wait to see Iona corrupt Ruuko and crazy-ass Urisu shenanigans.</br>  <br> Everyone ignoring Iona <br> This scene <br> Mayu is a vengeful ghost with tulpas <br> Akira is a poorfag that gets beat on <br> Yuzuki upset a trading card is fucking her brother instead of her <br> How Ruuko solved Mayu's pick the correct card trick <br> After she gets Tama back, Yuki is barely acknowledged and isn't even in the ending sequence  <br>Spread was too funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have minded the plot if they just kept the tanoshii.<br><br>You had one fucking job, Okada.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, instead of eldritch abomination Tama like infected showed, we get a deviant art recolor.</br>  <br>Tomorrow, with the spin-off in HQ and re/verse pics.</br>  Nice, a Wixoss thread!  The show doesn't even explain how the card game works  <br>Get your ass ready for some glorious backgrounds.</br>  <br>I saw episode one and picked it up because of the backgrounds.<br>Okada shenanigans were pretty fun too even if Spread wasn't as good as Infected.</br></br>  <br>You shoot lasers until your opponent has no clothes left.</br>  I still have hopes for another anime adaptation. <br>I want to believe.</br>  <br>All the foreshadowing. Which, unfortunately, never went anywhere.</br>    <br> that scene <br>Ruu is a genius.</br></br>    <br>a.pomf.se/wmyujv.webm<br><br>I miss it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I love Tama.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Tama was supposed to stay corrupted, and Ulith was supposed to be the actual final villain, but for some reason they dropped it and threw in the shitty Mayu hikkikomori ghost plot at the last second.<br><br>I mean Ulith was developed as a major antagonist much longer than Mayu even existed in the story. Mayu herself was never developed as anything other than a plot device until like the last 3 episodes of Spread, and everything related to her was retarded. Ulith was shown to match and surpass Ruuko by both crushing Tama's will and getting level 5 on a whim, and winning the match between them. She gets a wish from Tama which they went pretty far out of their way in Infected to point out was a big deal. Hell, Ulith even went as far as saying her goal was to keep using Tama to make people suffer.<br><br>And yet none of it is capitalized on whatsoever. Dark Tama is never touched on again. Ulith suddenly doesn't care about battling other selectors anymore. Tama's wish is wasted and never becomes relevant. Ulith subjugates herself to Mayu for literally no fucking reason, and thus her beating Ruuko is never resolved. And then there was the entire batshit retarded fucking finale with two Mayus and all the other assorted bullshit.<br><br>It's very clearly not what Okada intended for the ending, and if I were her I'd be fucking livid that the studio pulled that level of retardation when her name is on the project.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck Mayu.  <br>Something clearly wasn't right in Spread. It lacked a lot of the finesse in the production that Infected had. It was even stated in an interview published while Infected was airing that they were having diffuculties. I'm now wondering if things were changed to accommodate Destructed. I don't think that Spread was terrible, it just wasn't as good as Infected. I rewatched it and I picked up on a lot of subtile plot points that I missed the first time round.</br>  <br>More like belive in Takara Tommy.</br>  <br>Spread has way too many major plot holes for it not to be considered terrible, and general stupid shit like Akira's entire handling as a character.</br>  Best LRIG.  <br>Akira was great to watch in Infected. Seeing her destroy Hitoe and Yuzuki were my favourite moments. She was always an emotional wreck with a fragile ege, this was highlighted in Peeping Analyze. I didn't like the way her break down was portrayed in Spread but it wasn't unexpected.</br>  <br>This kills the series.</br>  <br> It didn't go full edgelord like I expected <br> major plot hole </br></br>  I want this card, but forwarding services don't ship tickets and even if they did, from what I have gathered, you can only recieve ticket at the cinema. I am tempted to fly to Japan.  <br> signs all over the place <br> didn't deliver </br></br>  <br>It was definitely what Okada intended, but I don't think the execution of most of the middle was up to her standards. It's very clear that wixoss was intended to be two cour from the start, and it's equally clear that the series as a whole was meant to be a dichotomy of black and white (among other things), which leads to the deduction that she knew that the true ending of spread would be a happy one with redemption from the beginning. <br><br><br>Most of what you're thinking of aren't plot holes. You might call some of them dropped threads, but in the story that happened, everything makes sense and is justified, or else can be understood from context and a little bit of thinking.</br></br></br></br>  It's time to summoning HIM.  <br>He was already here. He's too busy to translate the latest re/verse chapter.</br>  <br>Summon harder.</br>   Most tomboy LRIG is actually the cutest girl <br>Why is this allowed to happen?</br>  <br>Because the production team were Piruluk-and Midoriko-fags. That's the reason why the WIXOSS specials feature these two.</br>  Shitoe a Hitoe.  <br>I really really hope Okada doesn't put someone like Hitoe in the new Gundam. Damnit, Hitoe should have follow the same pattern in development like Mahmu.</br>  <br><br>You opponent have seven magical LEDs, you sexy Lrig need destroy every LED with a Rock-paper-scissors combination of cards</br></br>  <br><br>Why is there german dub of Wixoss?<br><br>Are there german edition of wixoss TCG</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask that to the german wixossfag.</br>  <br>Thank you based Anon.</br>  <br>I'm so mad the promo card from vol 2 is another remember.

KanaHana is in my top ten.</br>  <br>I am the only one that does not give a fuck about voice actors? The only one I know about is this Hanazawa person because she's mentioned all the time, and even then I only know 2 of her roles so far. Why would I give a shit about the man/woman behind the voice?

She'll be playing the main heroine in Super Robot Wars BX  Aoi Yuuki is my favorite. Second place probably goes to Chiwa.<br><br>When it comes to "soft" voices I prefer Minaguchi Yuko, Mamiko Noto and Nakahara Mai all over Hanazawa.</br></br>  HanaKana is shit. Her only good role is Iris Heart.  HanaKana is  pretty good<br/>  and if you don't think so then you're just a  bandwagoner   <br>She is pretty good at her niche of soft-spoken characters and when voicing crazy bitches on occasion.<br>Outside of that she is mediocre.</br></br>  If it wasn't for him I would have never finished many shows, including Hyouka<br><br>He literally carried Hyouka on his back, he and spoiler]KI NI NARIMASU[/spoiler]<br><br> He'll always be Graham Aker for me though </br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do people care?
