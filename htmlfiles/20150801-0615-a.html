Considering the game is 12 years old and with time taken to level, assemble the guild, and farm stuff to build Nazarick neither can be over 10 years old.</br>  <br>I always imagined the age of consent was because it was assumed that by the age of 14/16/18 the person would be mature enough to understand what it is they're doing.</br>  <br>Actually it's because that's how long they think it would have taken to sell off their daughter.</br>  <br>im gonna go with titty monster since Ains backspaced the 'shes actually a bitch' part</br>  <br><br>oh ho ho ho ho<br><br>for that i'll post my best smug loli</br></br></br></br>  <br> pedophile <br>When it's a drawn picture<br><br>i want normalfags to leave</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vampire loli. Always vampire loli.</br>  <br> vampire <br> loli <br> vampire loli <br>How is this a contest?</br></br></br></br>  wasn't it implied albedo has another form?  <br> implying its not in response to ridiculous arguments about the age of 2d characters and what is and isn't loli <br><br>Plz go</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> thinking pedophilia has anything to do with age </br></br>  Neither. I don't like leeches and Albedo's mouth weirds me out.  <br>In order to date either one of them you need to first be an undead skeleton. Which means you can't get a boner even though you are all bones.</br>  <br>Magic son, he don't have to explain shit around somehow achieving an erect penis</br>  <br>Succubus titty monster.<br>Titty monsters have always been my favorite, in this life, and in each of my previous lives.</br></br>  <br>A chair please</br>  think of chairs and stuff when trying to not bust a nut, shalltear you fucked it for me  <br>Where is the loli? All I see is a succubus and a chair.</br>  Ive seen this smockin' milf around /a/ lately, who is she and what anime  What's the chair meme? I am fucking slow, please spoonfeed me. Or is it actually explained in a translated novel ?  <br>Albedo is the only choice.</br>  <br>Left has better  hips </br>  Is it true albedo is not exist in the WN?  <br>Yes, Albedo and her sisters do not exist in the WN. <br><br>It's a hard choice, they're both actually remarkably pure, though Albedo is more of a pure waifu after Ainz modification of her. Shalltear has a ridiculous number of fetishes and things though.</br></br></br>  <br>So does Demiurge take her role in the WN or someone else?</br>  <br>Albedo, Overlord</br>  I choose Aura    <br>I choose  Papa Bones  so  he could hug me and spook me at night. </br>    <br>autistic maido</br>  <br>Is there even a choice?</br>  I Shalltear that pussy up  <br>This is some grade A nightmare fuel</br>  <br>I'm afraid I already have a vampire loli but I suppose it couldn't hurt to have a spare.</br>  <br>This, fucking this.<br><br>The purest smile, based upon the deaths of humans.</br></br></br>  <br>A vampire loli obviously. in this particular case I might make an exception though.</br>  Vamploli I mean just hearing her talk makes my dick hard  <br>Aura is the daughteru, you can't fuck your own daughteru.</br>  Semen demon vs blood demon.<br><br>The answer is obvious.</br></br>  <br>Is it just me or does the thumbnail look more cuter than the full sized image for some reason?</br>  <br>I'd rather lose bodily fluids other than my blood, thank you.</br>  <br>i'll take the third option</br>  <br><br>Well when you post her then...</br></br>  <br>Why not the other dark skinned pointy ear?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128838239   <br>Both, that is an unfair question.</br>  <br> succubus titty monster <br>yes please</br></br>  <br><br>Mah nigga.</br></br>  <br> implying <br><br> niggers </br></br></br>  <br>By this logic, fapping to bara isn't gay.<br><br>I want pedos to leave.</br></br></br>  <br> succubus <br>Actually, she is an imp.</br></br>   faggots on this board actually passing on a lolipire   <br><br>She's both. She has 30 racial levels, only 10 of which are imp. Some of those are succubus and she has at least one more race since the max racial level is 15, but that isn't known. Probably Fallen Angel.</br></br>  <br>Just you.</br>  <br>I still think her last race is  Semen Deamon. </br>  <br> wanting to fuck a cold corpse who lacks empathy <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br> Its a trap </br>  <br> &gt;wanting to fuck a shitty chair. </br>  <br>Reverse i mean.</br>  <br>Loli has better personality while succubus is cuter in monster form. It's hard to choose</br>  <br>Why does this series have so many retarded faces?</br>  <br>vampire loli only because she good at shucking</br>  <br>Or maybe  Fluid Druid </br>  <br>The latter</br>  <br> implying vampires don't  <br> scrape <br> and lick </br></br></br>  <br> Implying mare isn't the master of all things fluid and druid. </br>  Would Albeido like Ainz if he hadn´t altered her description?  <br><br> though Albedo is more of a pure waifu after Ainz modification of her.  <br>And because of that she can't ride her lvl 100 mount summon</br></br></br>  <br>She'd jump his bones.</br>  <br><br>What's her mount? I'm guessing it's something from the LN? Will we get to see it in the anime? And why couldn't she ride it before?</br></br>  Albedo is too desperate unlike delicious Shalltear.  <br>Albedo would like everyone if Ainz hadn't changed her description.</br>  <br>Her mount is bicorn (dual corn unicorn) but bicorns won't let virgin ride them (they will collapse to the ground if ridden forcibly). That's one one reasons why she jumps ainz later on. This stuff from vol 8 so it's unlikely to feature in the anime (it could be added anyway since it doesn't affect the timeline)</br>  <br><br>So she's a virgin until volume 8? And succeeds in jumping him and doing it? Indicating that he can indeed have sex and does have the necessary parts? Or it fails and she still can't?</br></br>  <br>Her creator said she was a bitch.<br><br>In Japan, they treat the term bitch like how we treat the term slut.<br><br>Albeido wouldn't love Ainz but she wouldn't be only his personal slut since her creator intended her to be the guild exclusive slut so other guild members could have a go at her as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't read that far but some spoilers mention that she is stopped before she can rape ainz punished with 3 days of confinement . she probably just gives up the option of riding her summon and ask aura to lend her a high level mount (such as a unicorn which can only be ridden by a virgin). BTW we also learn that shalltear is virgin although she has sexual experience with the same aex</br>  What day does this anime air again?  <br>Tuesday</br>  <br>You mean that Loli who is that insecure that she stuffed her busts?</br>  <br> shalltear is virgin although she has sexual experience with the same sex <br>Go on</br></br>  <br>Loli Vampire is always the correct answer.</br>  <br>She says that she only likes undeads but she can't stand decaying meat of most of them</br>  Loli, she's sweet :D      How can you impregnate and have an actual kid with a Succubus? That makes no sense.<br> Discovered Kyonyuu fantasy yesterday </br>  <br><br>I doubt they work the same as most succubi in that world.<br><br>Also, she's an imp and at least one other race. Probably fallen angel or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbian sex isn't real sex, silly.</br>    <br>I think Albedo would be more fun to date.</br>  <br>Albedo will always be my choice. I like big tits, and I also like loyal minions to the point of fanaticism.</br>  <br>no bully please</br>  <br>I'm fairly certain that Imp is the base class for all daemonic types and once you've gained a certain amount of levels in Imp you can get levels in a higher daemon class. Demiurge has levels in Imp as well, just like Ainz has levels in Skeleton Mage, which is probably the base type for Lich.</br>  I am currently infatuated with Albedo  DARK ELF<br>A<br>R<br>K<br><br>E<br>L<br>F</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-aniki?</br>  <br>That elf needs a hug.</br>  <br>There's only one choice for grown men.</br>  <br>How about a succubus loli?</br>  <br>Smug vampire lolis are the worst kind of lolis.

This is one of the drawbacks. You need to stop thinking about radicals and just recognize the kanji as a whole. If not I don't know what the problem is. I've never had to zoom in to see kanji.</br>  <br>I just only finished so I'm still transitioning, I did RTK late though and have some study under my belt aside from that, so I'm not stupid enough to read Japanese with English keywords. You mark a point though.<br><br>To be fair I might simply need to change my glasses. Anon up there made me notice my vision got worse.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks by the way.</br></br>  For people who learned kanji through vocabulary and things like an anki deck (that is, without mnemonics), how do you recognize different kanji where only one stroke seperates them?<br><br>I get that it is different from person to person, but I just want to know how it is for different people. If there are two kanji that look really alike, do you sometimes have a difficult time reading them?</br></br>  <br> Did you do RTK or something? This is one of the drawbacks. <br>Maybe if you're still learning them. The end result of RTK is recognizing the Kanji as a whole.</br></br>  the end result of RTK is flushing it down the toilet  <br>No it isn't. The book says keyword to kanji, that is not recognition, that is construction.</br>  <br>You misunderstood what he said. What he meant is to stop focusing so much on individual Kanji parts and instead seeing words as words. Example : 意味, the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as "idea" and "not yet", or even worse, "sound, heart / mouth and some young tree". Which is kind of what I'm going through at times, I need to stop thinking of these things and instead seeing words as words, like I would read English or my native language.</br>  <br><br> media <br><br>Anon, this is why I deliberately made the distinction between proficiency (undoubtedly years away), which is what you're describing, and fluency (probably months away).<br><br>I know that I'm not six months away from reading every VN ever made without touching a dictionary.<br><br>However, will I have enough vocabulary to be able to handle damn near anything that comes up in everyday conversation in six months? Based off of what I can comprehend now, I think I will. If you've listened to normal Japanese people having a discussion with their friends and family, you know that they're usually not throwing around 電磁 曳光弾 (you might be able to take a guess at what I've been reading), or any other terms along these lines that turns near-native proficiency in Japanese into such a long haul. The vocabulary pool for the conversational Japanese needed to be an active, functioning member of Japanese society who can get completely cut off from an English-speaking environment and still work and make friends is much smaller.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  熟語jukugo is more inportant than kanji alone. its have one meaning per a jukugo. so that simple and less mistaken  <br>baldr sky? more like baldr shit amirite</br>  <br> That anon saved the image from about a year ago. <br>More like two months actually</br></br>  <br>I'm most productive during the night. My comprehension drops to shit in the early morning.</br>  <br><br>I'm enjoying it. The setting is a bit depressing, but the story is interesting.<br><br>Unlike Flyable Heart. Goddamn, Flyable Heart was miserable to read, especially moving at a snail's pace like that. If I were to make a list of least favorite tsunderes of all time, Kururi might top it. If I were to make another list of protagonists who need to press charges on their harems, Shou would definitely be on it. Even being the miserable douchebag that he was, it was still pretty unpleasant watching him get abused at every turn, and it was made even worse by how he didn't so much as raise his voice at them (a double standard, since he treats dudes like shit). I think that the story was about to let up on Shou abuse, but I just didn't care to continue. Water gun tag wasn't enough to convince me.<br><br>At least it served as an easy place to get acclimated to grammar, since if you misunderstood something, you'd probably only be lost for the remainder of the scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  do you smoje, /DJT/?  <br> learn meanings and readings of some 2000+ symbols when several of them might have double meaning/reading <br>or<br> learn meanings and readings of 15000+ words but hey, at least it's not ambiguous now, right? <br>Hmmm.</br></br></br></br>  ぱっつん　like or hate?  What is Japanese equivalent of fuck off?  <br><br>ファック・オフ</br></br>   fourth <br> 五 </br>  <br> Example : 意味, the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as "idea" and "not yet", or even worse, "sound, heart / mouth and some young tree". Which is kind of what I'm going through at times <br>1. The second kanji's keyword is "flavor". 未 is "not yet".<br>2. If you're breaking kanji into radicals as you read, you're doing RTK completely wrong.<br><br><br>Recognition is obviously implied if you have mastered production. And RTK faggots who aren't writing the kanji as instructed deserve to fail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm running down that slope, the wind feels great.</br>  <br> If you're breaking kanji into radicals as you read, you're doing RTK completely wrong. <br>Don't be retarded, I never said I was, I said this as an example of "what-to-not-do". As for "kind of what I'm doing" I meant seeing Kanji indifivudually instead of seeing the whole picture (i.e. words).<br> the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as X or Y. <br><br>Bu you knew this already right? You just came here because your ego is shitty and you felt like vomitting in the thread to feel better about yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> know enough to spot a variety of fuck ups, both "hard" mistakes like that one and "soft" mistakes like the translator's inability to capture the flavor of that particular line <br> don't know enough to actually enjoy raws; if I want to treat anime like a relaxing activity instead of as intense practice, have to use subs <br><br>I-I'll get back to reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Water gun tag <br><br>I think I spent weeks on that part. It was like the endless lunch in Hanahira.</br></br></br>  I don't understand what とる is supposed to mean when coupled with a (n/no-adjective) and に<br><br>like<br> 最強にとれるわけがない </br></br></br>  cluster amaryllis曼珠沙華　曼珠華　彼岸花　葉無花無<br>kanji cluster</br>  <br>This, I did RTK in a month and now I can watch anime without subs and write fluently like a japanese person</br>  I've been playing Aiyoku no Eustia and the grammar used is pretty easy. If it wasn't for the amount of vocab that I don't know, I guess that it would be easy to play without using VNReader.  <br> I did RTK <br> now I can watch anime without subs <br>I fail to see how it's related.<br><br>Also, one month? How many Kanji a day were you doing? 75? For that one I'm not doubting you, it's doable, but still quite intensive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it did run a bit long. Especially if you were trying different options out. I think that it tired me out, and combined with not really enjoying the story, it was enough to make me not come back.<br><br>If I ever go back to finish Flyable Heart, it will probably be when I can boot it up without AGTH and not be inconvenienced by this to any significant degree.</br></br></br></br>  If you have a group of people like in 多くの田舎者は都市に行っている or something, can 行っている have a repetitive meaning? Like, a group of people are going one after another.  Reading yotsuba before finishing tae kim is physically hurting me  <br> I fail to see how it's related. <br>Because if you know the kanji you know all the words too.</br></br>  <br>はやく死ね</br>  <br><br>Yeah, the first time is murder.<br><br>It gets easier pretty fast, though. It's not something that you think about when you haven't taken on a task like this before, but you build up stamina for mental tasks, too. Soon, reading for ten hours straight won't be an issue for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just don't go back to it. It's not like it's one of the top games, even among moege. It just happens to have a low kanji count so people take that to mean that it's one of the easiest things to read. I'm sorry you're ruining Baldr Sky for yourself so early though<br><br><br>大変申し訳ありませんが、今はちょっと…</br></br></br></br>  <br>I take like 10 minutes per page holy shit<br><br>Just noticed my first pun though so that's pretty rewarding I guess</br></br></br>  どうも、助かりました。お蔭様でした。<br><br>My first thought was "okay they're trolling".<br>But actually they were only half-trolling.</br></br></br>  <br> 侍魂 <br> translated as "Samurai Daruma" <br> TL note: A Samurai Daruma is a .... </br></br></br>  okagesama is king of japanese  <br><br> ruining Baldr Sky <br><br>I'm a bit lucky, in that I don't inherently find reading at a slow pace unenjoyable. Some people just can't stand it.<br><br>Of course, it depends. I think that with the water gun scene, I was ready to see if character interactions were going to change for the better and make the game cozy like SoL should be instead of obnoxious, so such a long skit put at that point just seemed to drag.<br><br>And Baldr Sky is interesting enough that you want to see what happens next, so that makes it a good pick. If I get lost (don't think I will; I'm fairly confident in my grammar), I'll just drop it and come back to it at a later date to enjoy looking at how my view of the story has changed.<br><br>Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm not eager to increase my reading speed. It's still more relaxing to read a work when you don't have to put any effort into it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't planning on trying to read Yotsuba before reading through the grammar guide. Should I?</br>  <br><br>It was the same for me. It wasn't long before it became 10 minutes per chapter, or less than that.<br><br>Try to get through Tae Kim. That helps out a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not. Misery loves company after all.</br>    <br>Be sure to have a dictionary ready.

There are much better quality raws than what is currently scanlated, so surely someone should have done it by now?  <br>I don't claim to understand the ways of the EOP scum.</br>  <br>You mean the ones in the CoR are bad? Where did you find better ones? Nyaa?</br>  <br>No I'm saying the scanlated versions. The one from the CoR is great quality.<br><br>Scanlated yotsuba seems to have been done ages ago and badly too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Sorry for the confusion</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh alright, I see, my bad too.</br></br>   a 5 year old knows japanese better then you ever will. <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>In your case you might want to study some more English.<br> then </br></br>  <br>The manga has furigana, friend.</br>  <br>Who knows. If I were a scanlator that would be one of the first things I would do, considering the overall importance of よつばと！. Then again there are a lot of things I would do that scanlators seem to ignore. Oh well; EOPs don't know any better.</br>  <br>Jisho is pretty good.</br>  <br>EDICT is useable but it's worse than pretty much every other dictionary.</br>  <br>It was pretty easy for me.

Bonus points for how she becomes talkative when she's into a conversation. <br>Also, her soothing voice.</br></br>  <br>I love seeing TakeP and AkaP as friends in fanart and stuff</br>  <br><br> Name-dropping a much more successfully anime to cover for shitty and disappointing CG. <br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, you're in luck since there's ought to be new fanart of TakeP trying to NTR Hibiki off AkaP based on the Anniversary Live.</br>  <br> much more succesful <br> shitty and disappointing CG <br>Yeah, just look at those sales. It's flopping so hard<br><br>LLfags, everyone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-1 really doesn't give a fuck about CG. Million Live is on the way and they have a much bigger hand in ML's development and success. They're only doing CG out of obligation, kinda of like if you married somebody who already had a kid.<br><br>Or, another way to put it would be that ML is Dudley Dursley and CG is Harry Potter. Scamco and A-1 the parents.</br></br></br>  <br>It must be nice having your dad work at A-1</br>  Nana feels like some kind of alternate universe of Yukarin, if Yukarin failed to become success.  <br>Not when he's silly dumb muggle scum.</br>  <br> ML: Dudley Dursey <br>Muggle<br> CG: Harry Potter <br>Wizard<br><br>nobody wants to be a Muggle</br></br></br></br></br></br>   megane idol <br> psychic idol <br> kigurumi idol <br> usamin idol <br><br>This is a pretty nice episode</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody wants to be a Muggle <br>I do actually.

You know, that one.</br>  <br>The episode basically about gimmick Idols belonging in the trash. I agree with Mishiro.</br>  <br><br>ML is more like Draco Malfoy I think.<br>And CG is already overcoming the odds with its popularity.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja and samurai idol too</br>  <br> couldn't protect NG's egao <br> couldn't protect his own egao <br> EGAONATION's Queen delivered the job <br><br>Sasuga EGAONATION.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  It's just A-1 being A-1, the 2011 anime was also awful.  <br>REMOVE YUKO<br>REMOVE MEGANE<br>REMOVE SUZUHO</br></br></br>  <br> CG is good because muh sales <br>So ironic.</br></br>  <br>It helps that they made the Producer a fun character</br>  <br>At least it had some animation. It's not that still abuse wasn't prevalent there either, but at least it hadwell animated scenes to make up for it.<br><br>CG has neither.</br></br></br>  <br>We can criticize both for their QUALITY, but truth be told, we're enjoying them. I'm personally enjoying CG more. People who glorify 2011 over CG quality-wise should probably rewatch it.</br>  <br> the 2011 anime was also awful. <br>but what about that chihaya live scene man</br></br>  <br>Maybe but the 2011 it also had terrible characterization and just horrible writing.<br>No amount of quality animation can fix that.</br></br>  <br>Uzuki saved NG and Producer's EGAO<br><br>Kaede provided inspiration for the EGAO Nation</br></br></br>  <br>2 minutes of Yaksoku and 2 minutes of Smoky Thrill don't really make up for 24 episodes of shit. Azusa's episode was good though.</br>  <br>But that's halfway through the second cour. CG hasn't even reached that point yet</br>  <br>TakeP was a revelation, sadly couldn't help to feel that CG anime was a bit lacking compared to 2011 anime.<br>We can feel the love of the staff towards imas in the 2011 anime, especially with Nishigori and co.<br>Whereas Deremas staff seems like they're just barely giving any effort.</br></br></br>  Based Oda Non  <br>I thought the Chihaya arc was godawful. The concert scene was nice I guess but everything that lead up to it was downright stupid.<br>They removed all character until nothing but a sad backstory was left.</br></br>  <br>This. Nostalgiafagging is really hard in this thread</br>  <br>Ｔａｍａｍｉ　ｉｓ　嘉山未紗</br>  <br>To be fair to deremas, another problem is having the same setting and themes, but not trying to retread over the same steps. Not like animas was even that good, but it had the advantage of nothing coming before it. People just have a soft spot for it, because for most people it was their first proper engagement with iDOLM@STER as a franchise.<br><br>I was thinking that LL:Sunshine may have the same problem, but that actually has competent staff working on it. So who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>The thing about the anime is that they over dramatized everyone. So the cause of Chihaya drama was drawn out and awful. I think the resolution was beautiful.</br>  <br>First ep was unbeleivably good, but it eas obvious that it's got to be a strange exception.</br>  <br>I hope we get lots of doujins of Stepmom</br>    iM@S is having a resurgence and Japanese fans are enjoying the danketsu <br>  Meanwhile /@/ makes tinfoil conspiracies about an alleged rift between original iM@S/ML staff and CG </br>  <br> tinfoil conspiracies about an alleged rift between original iM@S/ML staff and CG <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you!</br>  <br>this isn't /@/, here people come just to shitpost</br>  <br>Not yet; she still on "gambarimasu"; she is not ready to take on the EGAONATION's flagship.<br><br>BTW is Nana part of EGAONATION when she can't even protect her own smile?</br></br></br>  <br> resurgence  <br> danketsu <br>There's no danketsu in CG, and the franchise is turning cakefag pandering while ignoring fans who like more fresh girls.<br>It is not like Im@s was, and it will never be for the same audience again.</br></br></br></br>  kek    <br><br>See <br><br>It's hilarious whenever this lolicon pipes up everytime.<br><br>  "Muh loli idol screentime" <br>  "Muh loli idol navel" <br>  "Cakefags gtfo" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But she didn't even say anything?</br>  <br>/@/ is just buttfrustrated that ML is the least popular wing of the franchise.  DS doesn't count. </br>  <br>Yea, but that shitposter posts only here on /a/. Your post said /@/</br>  <br>/@/ is right about one thing though, that muh loli idol navel bitch is just a troll and should be ignored at all costs.</br>  <br>CG is just a cash-in project. You don't see the love or dedication from the staffs like the original im@s or LL. It's like: "Here are the idols, here are their traits. Don't like those? Here are more idols and some dramas. Buy our products please." <br><br>I see the same problem with between GBF and GBF Try. The new staffs don't have attachment to the originals so they can't carry over the same spirits. <br><br><br>This is not @ hug-box.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   as episodes progressed, more idols are joining his side <br> yfw last episode TakeP, Chihiro, and all idols under his wing defected from 346 Pro &amp; making a new agency </br>  <br><br> troll <br>The navel fag? Maybe. It's true however that loli fans are the ultimate losers of CG adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Except it's all /a/ shitposting. All the loli-conspiracies and "A-1 doesn't care about CG" memes are only here.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter anyway. There is more than enough loli fanservice in the mobage and if you've been playing for a decent amount of time, with it being almost four years old now, you should be able to afford any loli you could possibly want via trading.</br>  <br> no lines <br> still has a voice unlike Momoka </br></br>  <br> There is more than enough loli fanservice in the mobage <br>That is also wrong. I remember maybe 5 slightly erotic loli cards, and they're nowhere near on the level as your average cake (just look at Helen's last one for example).</br></br>  Stream's up!<br>http://www.daisuki.net/anime/watch/<wbr>TheIdolMasterCG/Zkd</wbr></br>  <br> A-1 doesn't care about CG. <br>Of course they do. It's just that they are incapable. Just look at SAO.</br></br>  <br>Cakes aren't erotic in the slightest though. They could be naked and my dick wouldn't waver.</br>  <br>This episode was great for cameos. Hell, I wonder if this level can even be called cameos anymore, they were more subcharacters to the plot.<br><br>I was a little upset Tamami and Ayame got so little attention, but hopefully I can say from hear on we'll see more of them.<br><br> Meanwhile... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nana still needs to assume her role as the H@gswarm Chief Executive Officer first, before she can take a role in the EGAONATION army.<br><br><br>c@kefag here, I like ALL of the idols<br>I like the christmas cakes, the various assorted non seasonal cakes, the cupcakes and fancier sweet breads, the cookies, biscuits and non-descript confectionary, and the cookie dough<br><br>Do I have a preference on whom I want to princess carry? or whom I want to go out drinking with? or whom I want to  hold hands and intertwine fingers  with? Definetly<br>It's My prerogative if and when I share it, because I'm proud of my  shit  taste and want to celebrate what I like that idol (not just what age bracket she falls under)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes she did.</br>  <br>Cakes just have more to show, lolis don't.</br>  <br>That's one thing, but you wouldn't feel satisfied if they got the treatment like lolis do.</br>  Kirari a cute.  <br>Absolutely wrong, but what could I expect.</br>  <br>Seems to me that you're just being cynical.<br>From all the little references, allusions, and jokes they put into the anime and NoMakes, it seems to me that the screenplay writers and producers care a lot about the CG anime, which is a part of why the overall tone is much more serious than goofy; this would be an important "first" for CG.<br>The downside is that they don't really seem to have the manpower or budget to deliver top-of-the-line animation.</br></br></br>  <br>The lolis in the CG anime, however ignored you think they are still get more screentime and love from A-1 than say Chieri and Kanako.</br>  <br>Not really, they are on the same level.<br>Not one impactful or memorable line in 16 episodes. And certainly not getting any from now on.</br></br>  <br>Read the thread next time before replying to obvious baits, anon.</br>  <br> not one impactful or memorable line <br>So you're just looking for one LINE? Something you could repeat ad infinitum like a MEME?</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? The point is that they didn't do or say anything as a character. A few gimmicks here and there, not a whole lot. Their episode was upstaged. We didn't see them perform. No fanservice. Nothing.</br>  <br>That just show that it's not that they dislike lolis in general but that they dislike or don't find a purpose for those particular characters since they also ignore other idols on the same group.</br>  <br>No, I'd agree with him. If I were a secondary I think I'd consider Kanako and Chieri much more forgettable than the lolis. The latter both stood out much more in the Dekoration episode, as opposed to how memorable the former were in the Candy Island episode. Plus I think Miria and Rika's characters simply stand out more as well.</br>    Episode 2 has NG learn about Nobility of Heart from Kaede <br>  Episode 3 has Miku learn about gimmicks being an important part of your character from Nana <br>  Episode 4 is "Where does this road lead to?" <br><br>Speculations now? Who learns what from who and who gets a new voice?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't no satisfaction<br><br>Theres way too many good/fun/interesting idols and not enough VA's and screen time to develop them  but that's all business/marketing decisions by Scamco and pushed to A-1 to boost sales of any given idol's merch/music <br><br>So, now I'm stuck with enjoying what I can get.<br>And while CG is not the best anime out there, every week it has me coming back for more.<br><br>TL;DR<br>enjoy your idols, <br>get their merch<br>download their songs<br>fuck Scamco<br>and headpats for all the idols</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The CI epsiode was also hijacked by other idols though, it's not something exclusive to Miria and Rika.<br>It's just A-1 playing favorites.</br></br>  <br> Plus I think Miria and Rika's characters simply stand out more as well. <br>No thanks to the adaptation you gotta admit.</br></br>    I'm amazed you people don't get tired of replying to that lolifag every week  <br>SOON</br>  <br>I'm not saying it's exclusive to lolis. <br>I'm just having a bitter time since none of my favorites from the main cast get to do anything.</br></br>  <br>They learn love from <br><br>M O M O K A<br>O<br>M<br>O<br>K<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Different people I guess.</br>  <br>There are a lot of thing to be bitter about, you are not the only one suffering you dipshit.</br>  <br>So it's alright to do the same circlejerking for your favorites ad infinitum, but complaining about the lack of others' is somehow trolling or some shit?</br>  <br>And I'll be bitter till the end if they keep this up.</br>  <br> road <br> vehicles <br> bike <br>Takumi next week guys</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanna say that it's a Riina episode because of Natsukichi and bikes but.</br>  <br>No, yes thanks to the adaptation. Especially in Miria's case. <br>Before the anime, Miria didn't really strike me as anything but just another loli with no real stand out features besides being overpoweringly cute. Which most of them already are.<br>Thanks to the anime she now has some interesting and curious quirks like being able to understand Ranko speak and not being afraid of no ghosts.<br><br>Rika admittedly is more of the same, but I still feel like her personality's come out more than Kanako and Chieri's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have some peculiar and strange perception of things then.<br>Meanwhile they are losing the few fans they had because they are so uninteresting in the anime.</br></br>  <br> Miria didn't really strike me as anything but just another loli with no real stand out features besides being overpoweringly cute. <br>That's really all she is in the mobage too. She's the mobage's innocent genki cuteness personified.</br></br>  <br>Kanako, Chieri and Anzu are even more uninteresting than those two.<br>It's clear who they hate more.</br></br>  <br> You have some peculiar and strange perception of things then. <br>How do you mean.<br><br> Meanwhile they are losing the few fans they had because they are so uninteresting in the anime. <br>I don't think it's just them. I never said the anime is doing a good job overall.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I still say they're on the same page.<br>I could mention them too, if they were my favorites.</br></br>  <br> bait <br>What? Fuck off.<br><br>I'm not saying they don't care, they just can't create the original magic without copying it exactly. Fans either want to see more of the same for the sequel or a unique take on the premise. The CG staffs was trying to balance both of that but they have failed so far. Btw, they did have a big budget for CG just by how much Bamco spent on marketing.<br><br>As for the Bamco executives, they just see money for a cash-in sequel. I hope LL Sunshine does not have the same problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think it's just them <br>It hit them the most. For example Miku got a huge popularity boost since she got very biased focus.</br></br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br>It's probably moreso that people are discovering idols through the anime they've grown attached to that they otherwise ignored because money problems and other things. Like Miku got a big popularity rise through the anime.</br>  <br> That's really all she is in the mobage too. <br>I know, I'm a primary fag  and a PassionP.  That's why I said "before the anime".</br></br>  <br>I want to do Nana from behind.</br>   I like ML because they are 765pro   <br>Nice left arm there, Sae, it goes well with the terrible foreshortening.</br>  I feel like this second half is worse that the first.<br>We barely have any interactions between the main 14 and some don't even get any screentime. <br>Even when the anime units were formed they still interacted with the others and it felt more like a group.</br></br>  <br>They're getting more and more retarded, what's new.<br> "Guys, we don't have time to develop most of our 14 idols!" <br> "Bring in more!" </br></br></br>  <br> We barely have any interactions between the main 14  <br><br>That's exactly the reason why it's BETTER.<br><br>The main 14 are an overall horrible selection.<br><br>S2 already gave us Kaede, Nao, Karen and Nana.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Mayu.</br>  <br>I sort of feel this way as well. The fact that the show has them show up at all and give one line of their gimmick is even worse than them being ignored completely. <br><br>And things were getting this way in the first season, but this second season has so far really been pushing P as the main character, with the idols as accessories.</br></br></br>    <br> The main 14 are an overall horrible selection. <br>Why do you say this? Please give a reason besides "because they're not [your favorite idols]".</br></br>  <br>But that's exactly why it's better</br>  Since this was a Miku episode the dream of a Riina/Natsuki episode is pretty much dead, right? No way they give 2 episodes this cour to a single unit.  <br>If they can give multiple episodes to the NG members and still have their own unit episode surely they can do the same for asterisk.</br>  <br>We'll see.</br>  <br>Have you even seen the original im@s? Even Iori, who was my least favorite was fun to watch and I never hated her and completely memorable. CGs main cast has Uzuki, Ranko, and Rin. Every other character is either unlikable, unmemorable (so far)</br>  <br>The 765 anime was shit though.</br>  <br>The difference is that the girls in NG are the main characters and pretty well liked by the fanbase. Asterisk has one popular character and one who used to be popular but now barely ranks in character pools.</br>  <br> Have you even seen the original im@s? <br>Of course.<br> Every other character is either unlikable <br>What makes them unlikeable is my question.<br> unmemorable <br>How they're treated in the show doesn't have much to do with them being a bad choice. If the show had chosen different girls, they possibly would have gotten as much love (or lack there of) from the story as the ones we already have.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People just liked the characters, but the anime was terrible. It's the games that lend weight to their popularity, the anime just exposed them to casuals  and gave them a terrible impression of what most of the characters are YUKIHO STOP DIGGING YOURSELF IN </br>  <br> Every other character is either unlikable, unmemorable (so far) <br>Shit opinion.</br></br>  <br> What makes them unlikeable is my question. <br>Because they have flaws, of course. The bad things that happen are their fault. <br>What a silly question to ask.<br><br>765pro is much more likable in that the things that go wrong for them are not the girls' fault at all. It's either a matter of circumstance or evil villain antics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must have some sour taste if you think Rin is likable and the others who haven't been able to do anything aren't.</br>  <br>Well at least she's not Mio i.e. shit.</br>  <br> flaws make characters unlikable <br>Sasuga Rinfags.</br></br>  <br>Rin has flaws, even though the anime doesn't want to admit it she has a shit tier singing voice.</br>  <br> Because they have flaws <br>How the fuck do you expect them to develop flawless characters? Besides, Uzuki is the most flawed of them all so you're kind of biting you own ass here.</br></br>  <br> Because they have flaws, of course. <br>All characters have flaws. Or at least should have flaws. Rather, I'd think that if a character IS flawed that should make them more likeable than a character that isn't. <br> The bad things that happen are their fault.  <br>You can make this argument about Mio, but what about the others? What bad things have they caused? Certainly not this current arc. <br>And even in Mio's case, almost everyone knows that was poorly done forced drama. Even the seiyuu had to explain in their radio show the reasoning that the show could not.<br> What a silly question to ask. <br>The answer to which you seem to be beating around. I won't press you anymore, since you don't seem to have an answer to it at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> she has a shit tier singing voice. <br>Not really. <br>But even if she did, that's not much of a flaw to being an idol. Just look at Riina, Yayoi, or a good half of AKB48.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a literal fucking retard aren't you? I wish the anime CG never fucking existed so it wouldn't attract morons like you</br>  <br>They aren't treated as the second coming of Chihaya like Rin is though.</br>  <br> ur dumb <br>Touché.</br></br>  Any examples of Riina's VA being bad at singing? All I heard of her was Twilight Sky and I thought she did pretty well there.

The only time it's really been brought up was when Rin was still a background dancer and showed Mika that could use her voice as well.

Symphogear streams are great, but not if I have to spend the whole 20 minutes trying to do stuff to increase my connection</br></br>  <br>use livestreamer instead</br>  <br><br>Well obviously Gary kills Carol so Elfnein can sit on the throne and play with her dolls</br></br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br> eleven´s <br>It's a chink site, not a nip one.</br></br>  <br>the yellow button next to volume?</br>  <br>I can't stop imagine her actually yelling this while everyone else ignores her.<br>She is so cute.</br></br>  <br>I've got it to work on Pale Moon. I had to disable noscript and request policy, but it's going.</br>  <br>its ripped from Nico Nico though</br>  <br>The comments aren't.</br>  <br><br>I imagine her standing on a street corner in Tokyo just screaming at everyone until she gets made and starts jumping up and down commanding them to pay attention to her</br></br>    Why does it 404 it's never done this before on chinese site   <br>livestream works with this site?</br>  <br>Certainly does. An anon a few dozen threads back mentioned it.</br>  <br><br>I know one chuuni she might, they both try to act edgy.</br></br>   MC does something nice, that literally anyone would do <br> BLUSHING DOUSHIO DOKI DOKI </br>  <br>I fixed it please don't bully</br>  <br>oh<br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, that show is pure fun</br>  <br> Canceled chuuni </br>  I'm expecting Hibiki to wake up perfectly fine and say something like  "Oh, hey Miku. Where am I? That concert was a blast, we must go together next time. I'm starting to like those Zwei Wing girls!   Brown girl looks like a slut  <br>I'm watching it right now, and I'm not having fun.</br>  <br>Why does Hibiki suddenly talk like an old woman</br>  <br>She's a pure maiden on the inside though.</br>  <br>Pixiv seems to think so too.</br>  <br><br>Because Gary's a dick like that</br></br>  <br>They're all sluts. They'd all suck his dick for a bit of salad.</br>  <br>There is a lesbian pair too, if that appeases you</br>  <br>Gungnir Datto  what's that? MIKU RUN, IT'S THE NOISE</br>  <br><br>I always like how defensive people get when I post Curren.</br></br>  <br>I hope there are more gary faces this week.</br>  <br>Depends on which girls it is.</br>   That ad making fun of US <br>My sides</br>   arbitrary tentacle rape imagery serving little to no purpose <br>At least I can cleanse my palate with Geahs immediately after.</br>  <br>Are they "lesbians who still fancy MC because he's so special"? <br>Like that stupid whore in Date a Slut.</br></br>   All this hate on based Shokugeki <br>The show's great. Also, just because Soma's competent doesn't make him a Gary Stu</br>  <br>Maybe back in the days it leaved a strong impression on people.</br>  <br><br>They would probably have been great allies.</br></br>  Fuck Douyu is being shittier than usual today.  <br>Not really, she dislikes the MC actually</br>  <br>SnS's foodgasms are weird like that. I still remember the one that involved one very muscular dude voiced by Koyasu going MS</br>  <br> ojou-sama cunt who has a perfect tongue <br> everything she tastes is shit <br> MC comes along and makes her orgasm for some reason <br> she falls for him <br><br>Yeah, that was more than enough for me. Fuck that. It's the same old shit in a different setting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear it's worse and worse each week.</br>  <br>I had literally no problem with the stream last week but now it's fucked beyond all reason.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128851465 <br>IRC please go.</br>  Man, douyu is unwatchable right now  <br>The MC is soma, not his dad.</br>  <br>Why is a cute wiener witch like her be so evul? She could have just enroll in Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>Same here. Usually it's passable but it's stuttering today whether through browser or livestreamer. Chinks can't do anything right.</br>  Nice symphogear thread people.  <br>No it isn't, you retard. She didn't even fall for him</br>  douyu being shitty for me as well.<br>anyone here its not being shit for?</br>  Is the stream delayed again or is it back to 10 past?  <br>It definitely happened. It was the second or third episode I think.</br>  <br>what a dumb hat</br>  <br>yea its really bad<br><br>is the livestreamer still kill?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, guy.</br>  <br>So far the only likable thing I've seen was this chick in the OP.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she did and the flashback is one of the earlier parades where they did the real thing instead of just reenacting.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Could be worse<br><br>Imagine if Tsubasa walked in and Hibiki started fangirling over her and  asking if she could get Kanade's autograph </br></br></br></br></br>  too much lag  Is this it? Have the Chinese killed Symphogear?  I hope this lag in the stream goes away before it starts.  <br>It was perfectly fine about 30 minutes ago. Now I check and it's horrible.</br>   More food porn <br>This is like Fairy tail x koufuku graffiti.</br>  Fucking laggy Douyu is making me inmensely sad.  <br>Erina hates Soma,you retard. And if she's Tsundere, let me tell you she stil lhas to show some dere to him (and we're in the second cour already). <br>So, you're a retard</br></br>  Symphogeneral kills a japanese stream because it can't handle the cross-ocean internet connections.  <br>Mine is working fine but with my luck it will shit itself during symphogear.</br>  What cliffhanger will await us today?any prediction?  <br> Failed to render file with MPC <br>fuck</br></br>  <br>Worse come to worse, someone could stream the raws once they come out if we all collectively decide the stream is too shit to watch. The hype would be more or less the same, we would just have to wait an extra 2 hours or so</br>  <br>Have you even watched the show? Or are you just judgng it based on an stream of an episode of it's second cour?</br>  <br>Blame the influx of EBIN HYPE TRAIN LIVESTREAM kiddies.</br>  <br> everything going to shit <br> scene changes to hibiki waking up in a hospital <br> where am I? who am I? </br></br></br>  <br><br>Maria with Gary's fist through her chest</br></br>  <br>I for one looks forward to watching the  slideshow  live.</br>  <br>It takes forever for her to stop hating him. Hell they aren't even anything better than acquaintances at the latest chapter.</br>  <br>miku dies</br>  <br>Shirabe dying</br>   E60  is up, will they be streaming it?  <br>The manga artist literally drew hentai before making Shokugeki<br>What do you expect?</br></br>  Is  5275  the only option for streaming? Because it runs like shit.  <br>I've dealt with worse streams in the past. Even with the bit of lag it's still worlds better than the keyhole days.</br>  <br>The latter.<br>Brown slut a shit.</br></br>  is this shit stream 2fps now?  Stream works pretty well here in Europe, check your undersea cables.  <br>It's more cinematic that way, quit yer bitching.</br>  <br>There is atleast one more alternative but it seems to run just as bad.</br>  <br>THANK YOU MR SHARK</br>  Two seconds of video every five seconds. I don't think this is going to work.  <br>She doesn't like him at all. It's obvious she'll end up with him in the end, I'll give you that but we're nowhere near that point yet.</br>  <br>If only there were an alternative to douyu. It's nice quality, but even with a 20Mbit connection and livestreamer with multiple segments I can't stream it without it dropping frames and eventually running out of buffer space. sgdq on the other hand streams perfectly with it at 720p60 for hours on end.</br>  <br>they haven't been before, unless something changed.<br><br>Also holy fuck it keeps getting worse. Yet another reason not to spoonfeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you have no place to talk<br>Also, brown slut is irrelevant as fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Oh god, /v/ really is here.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, it just almost fully died.</br>  <br>They did for the first 2 or so episodes, then the streamer was off for something else.</br>  <br>No anon, you are the /v/.</br>  there are no delay today right?  <br>That one 2fps anon is right. It really is that bad for some of us.</br>  Where's the other stream? I remember there being two.  Any stream alternatives?  <br><br>0.2 is more accurate.</br></br>  <br><br>It's just as bad.</br></br>  <br>Britbong here,streams ded for me.</br>  <br><br>Mine is fucking blocked.<br>And two minutes left, please no.</br></br></br>  Works completely fine here.  being symphogear fan is suffering  fucking sluts  <br>Suddenly adds in 60fps, 4k, no problems.</br>   streams fine during commercials <br> Hyper lag on anything related to anime <br><br>This is the worst</br></br></br>  Now it works, it always goes to shit when that thing is streaming.<br><br>It's because of that anime's popularity I guess.</br></br>  <br>You can try appending ?cdn=lx to the url. It apparently reduces lag for some people.</br>   3 MINUTES   well i watch at douyu  It's going to start now...  E60 is showing souma ed right now, will might show symphogear next.  3 minutes  <br>I tried doing that and mustard gas is coming from the screen what the fuck is going on</br>  Something's happening.  Only 2 week before ep7 . My body isn't ready.  Fuck this. See you at HS. It's only like an hour away.  And the Stream is back.  <br>E60 is what service? I've always used 5275.</br>  OH YEAH ANOTHER MMO BASED ANIME JUST WHAT I WANTED  It's still a bit laggy, but it's certainly watchable now.   painting the mural with him holding a fucking grocery bag   CHINKS GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER<br>FISTING IS AT RISK</br>   This PV <br><br>Okay, I'm interested.</br></br>  <br>elite60</br>  That looks edgy.  KITAAAAAAAAAAAA  <br>They fucked up Kantoku designs.</br>  <br>God damn, that actually worked. Thank you.</br>  <br><br>Just as a sidenote, some people actually started developing a SAO MMO.</br></br>  That YuYuYu looking anime looks nice  STARTING ON E60<br>DOYOU IS BEHIND</br>  THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG THIS LAG  <br>Its PLAYING AND ITS SMOOTH</br>  Airing on elite60 right now.  KITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  It's ON  IT BEGINS  HERE WE GOOOOO  HIIBIKIIII!!!!!!  KITA!!  IT BEGINS  KITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  PROJECTO IGNIGHTO  ITS HEREEEEEEEEEE   ads are fine <br> anime starts <br> lag </br></br>  <br>I hope the fans get stuck there</br>   lag <br> no Heavenrend in the video </br>  NANA PLS WILL A LAG FREE STREAM  E X T E R M I N A T E   Amenohabakiri <br>What? They spelled Heavenrend wrong.</br>  HERE WE GO WHATS GUNNA HABBEN  no heavenrend?  <br>It is the reason why Ponycan has not authorized a yuyuyu S2 yet</br>  <br>Read the thread, elite60 works fine.</br>  Impossible to watch. Screenshots have more fps than this.  Is the pitch being fucking weird for anyone else?  IT'S TIME!!!  Was there an opening scene or just straight to the OP? Just got E60 working.    I thought this was going to be some edgy bullshit so I put off watching it for ages, but it's actually bretty good  subscribed  <br>Go back to tumblr to actually subscribe to anything, faggot, this is an imageboard.</br>  <br><br>btfo</br></br>  <br>So just because Papa Bones is a skeleton his edgy? You racist scum</br>  <br>What did you expect from a smelly fleshbag?</br>  <br><br>Modern anime would be greatly improved if we had more skeleton MCs.</br></br>  The lack of effort by which he curbstombs everything is offputting. It lacks excitement and satisfaction for me. Doesn't help that he obtained his godly powers by gaming hard. Even Alucard and Dark Schneider make a better show of their conflicts.  <br> who is Saitama. </br>  <br>Man, that guy is great!<br><br>I would love to see him and Kero-sensei have a one off, but we all know that Saitama would win.</br></br></br>  <br>Did old anime have a lot of skeleton MCs? Actually has any other show ever had a skeleton MC?</br>  <br>I don't think so. Not that I know, anyway.</br>  <br>But I actually like that about it.<br><br>I'm so bored of "drama" and "oh no the hero is going to die", no he isn't there are 10 more episodes, fuck off.<br><br>I'm really interested in how the relationship with the horn lady will go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because Alucard and Dark Schneider are show-off. Ainz doesn't seem to make any effort since he doesn't care about fighting scrubs. Hell, he doen't care about fighting at all.</br>  <br>It will be only like that until MC has to fight other Yggdrasil players (im assuming thats the only real time where he will struggle)</br>   「Heaven’s Downfall」 <br> Skeletal MC <br> Evil <br> Fucking god smite your shit </br></br></br>  <br>There might be bosses to challenge him if he decides to complete a dungeon for whatever reason.</br>  <br>Depending on if he's asian, we all know who's going to win at videogames.</br>  <br><br>Show? Maybe a few western ones, or at least villains, but I can't think of any anime.</br></br>  <br>True... but isn't he a dungeon boss himself, in a way?</br>  <br>This series isn't about the struggle to become stronger, it's about protecting what's important to you and how that doesn't only mean keeping it sheltered never to leave your side.<br><br>There's more of a reason he's called Papa Bones than just because he's the guild leader.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm really interested in how the relationship with the horn lady will go <br><br>At the pace the adaption is going, you won't see much change unless we somehow get to a third season, where she will  try to rape him </br></br></br>  <br>The artist does thighs so damn well on every design.</br>  <br>Skeletons are usually mook level or some kind of mummy boss. Ainz isn't exactly the hero here either.<br><br>I can think of the skeleton lady from jigoku shoujo, though.</br></br></br>  <br>I really fucking like how this show doesn't have its overpowered MC have life and death struggles against opponents. It's not insulting me by pretending the protagonist is anything other than massively overpowered for the situation.<br><br>"Oh no, will Kirito win this battle? Yes, yes he fucking will obviously since he's literally invulnerable snowflake but we're going to waste twenty minutes pretending otherwise."</br></br></br>  <br><br>Does he even have a dick to rape?</br></br>  <br>She has horns.</br>  <br><br>Who knows.<br><br>Does she look like she cares?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly Ainz is broken as shit in this world, a different broken than Kirito, but still, if the anime does a good job with the fight with  Chair  you'll understand Papa Bones is OP</br>  <br>If you want an underdog protagonist who has to struggle to win and get stronger then watch a different show. <br><br>The show is called OVERLORD, it's not about a plucky hero. It's about a Japanese salaryman who became an evil lich, and now he has to keep up appearances in front of his minions while trying to conquer the world, all while grappling with the fact that he's slowly becoming less human in his thoughts in actions.</br></br></br>  <br>He's OP in this world, but in the game he was pretty weak, because of his RPfag tendencies. All his p2w shit probably helped with that though.</br>  <br> but in the game he was pretty weak <br>No, he was still pretty strong, and with his insanely high-tier gear he was far stronger than 99% of the players in the game. <br><br>You could only call him weak compared to the strongest members of his guild and the other top 10 guilds, who were so strong they could take on raid bosses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He place himself "just above high tier player" I think somewhere in the LN, he isn't weak but he was certainly not as OP as TOUCH MUH, which was due to, yes, his RPfaggotry and also even though Necromancy looks neat, it wasn't that powerful in PvP</br>  I still don't understand why Touchme, a self described Hero of Justice, would be in an Evil guild..  <br>He's just OP in his current universe. In the game he was just a no-life max rank player with top-tier gear who was pretty good but not insanely good and min/maxing (that would be TOUCH ME).<br><br>It's more about him trying to understand this new world and keep his posse of super evil top-level NPCs in line while doing lich things.</br></br></br>  <br> M-muh tension <br>When did this become a thing?<br>Like are there MCs of series you were ever afraid would die for ANY reason?</br></br></br>  <br>Back when TOUCH MUH was the guild-master I think they were PlayerKiller-Killers, they became Evil after he left</br>  <br> even though Necromancy looks neat, it wasn't that powerful in PvP <br>Also not super useful in boss fights either. Summons and instant-death spells don't help much against super strong enemies, be they NPC bosses or PCs. <br><br>Necromancers are pretty good at solo-questing and clearing low level dungeons though, they just end up playing a support role against harder enemies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me was a hero of justice only for the heteromorphic races though. Makes sense that he'd be in AOG.</br>  <br>Probably to combat the human players who were prejudiced againt non-human races, which I really don't understand myself. He probably stayed so long just because me made friends, though.</br>  <br>No, they were always PK-Killers. Protecting heteromorphic races is what Touch Me was about, even if that included pking.</br>  <br><br>I never understood this stigma against "player killing" in Japanese online games. They treat it like some kind taboo, but if it was wrong it wouldn't be allowed in the first place. <br><br>Are they just that polite?</br></br></br></br>  <br>MMOs attract a lot of sperglords who just want everyone to behave even if the game says othervise.</br>  Who's your favourite character guys? I think Ninya added a lot of comic relief to the story.  <br>Japs in MMOs are autistic as fuck and generally fucking terrible at whatever game they're playing too.<br>People who suck complain the loudest when they lose.</br></br>  <br>Probably the penguin.<br><br>Fucking Penguin.</br></br></br>  <br>Even western MMOs have huge carebear tantrums.</br>  <br>Another hilarious scene</br>  I really want to be inside solution.  <br>But it isn't good. Sucking up the anime isn't good.</br>  Can someone explain this show to me? So the main guy was a normal person playing a video game, and then got sucked into the game. How didn't he realize this happened until he tried to call the menus up? Like, surely he realized that he wasn't sitting at his computer anymore and oh yeah his hands turned into bones. Am I missing something or is it just a really shitty premise?    What if Momonga is actually a girl?  <br>They said it was a virtual reality mmo.</br>  <br>Please refer to the opening scene where they clearly explain what kind of MMORPG Yggdrasil was.</br>  <br>VR dayo onii-chan</br>  <br>If you are 12 years old...</br>  <br>Yuusha Ga Shinda's MC is sometimes a skeleton</br>  <br> Good <br>How?<br>So far it's boring as balls.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what your mum said ;)</br>    <br>Demiurge. No contest.<br>But my Nazarick-Waifu is Aura.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Who's baiting retard? Having an all powerful MC who can beat anyone as of right now is just plain boring. If this were a comedy like OPM maybe it would be good but the comedy in this is shit tier. I'm expecting this to get even more stupid later on. This shouldn't even start with the MMO shit if it isn't going to do anything with it.</br>  <br>My baits aren't working, I guess I'll have to wait until the anime eps come out.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I don't have a mum. Only 2 dads.</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> what is power fantasy <br>summer pls</br></br>    <br> nuuhhh me no understand anime that don't follow cliches nuhhhh <br> me want underpowered protagonist! <br> nuhhhhh me no like confusing setting that isn't video game! </br></br></br>  <br>It isn't funny or interesting.</br>    <br/>  <br>How humerus.</br>   OP gets 100,000 more views every next day I open it <br><br>JESUS, it might not be SnK OP levels of views, but it's still fucking huge</br></br>  <br>As expected of Ainz-sama. Truly, everything he imbues with his presence is superb.</br>  <br>It's around 800000 in a month, isn't it? Apparently, it has stockholm syndromed a LOT of people.</br>  <br><br/></br>  Hey guys, what's the best MMORPG out there?  <br>I just put it on my playlist so it probably plays a couple of times every day, would assume others do the same</br>  <br>Wait and watch for the more retarded response that anon will come back with.</br>  <br>But this anime does follow cliches.<br><br>I want an interesting protagonist not some self-insert power fantasy.<br><br>They shouldn't have used any mmo shit from the beginning. Start with a real fantasy world. This isn't like LH where they actually use the MMO world to its fullest capacity. The game setting is just basically the author being too lazy to create a real lore. Think of it like this. Some powerful beings suddenly shows up. It's MMO players for about 3 fucking times already. Fucking lazy piece of shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mmorpg <br> good <br>Hopefully the new "vr" things will bring a new golden age of mmos.</br></br></br>  <br> They shouldn't have used any mmo shit from the beginning. <br>Except the fact that it's a huge plot point.<br>I don't even know why I'm wasting my time responding to a retard who believes 4 episodes is enough to make snap judgements on an entire 9 volume series.</br></br></br>  <br>Then don't watch it faggot.</br>    <br>Usually I'd agree with you, but in this case the author makes a real show of pointing out his declining humanity and his growing need to act evil or cruel where it isn't necessary. <br><br>Also, his inner thought process on most things like how to acquire information without giving away that he's not from this world or his logic on battling different enemies is interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>mmo's require being social and having social skills so vr or not its not for me.</br>  <br>He founded the guild. They started out as PKKers, and when human players started calling them "evil" they just sort of played along.</br>  <br> I want an interesting protagonist <br> watches log horizon <br>holly golly jee, another one of these faggots</br></br></br>  <br>ff:xiv<br><br>or at least its the only one ive found in the last 5 years to keep my attention for more than a month</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't really evil, they just PvP'd a lot. They probably made the Nazerick NPCs evil because they were all non-humans and they thought making an evil bastion would be cool.</br>  <br>If the mc doesn't need to give a fuck, why should I though? I'll take the word of those novelfags that him wanting to protect what's precious to him will lead to something that's interesting to follow, but so far the fact that he and his minions are so far beyond everything that gets thrown at them, makes his desire to keep his happy family a simple exercise in simply doing it at his leisurely pace. If the other stuff in the fantasy world could put up a decent fight, then his exercise in caution would feel more exciting, if at least those he holds dear could be put in harms way.</br>  Imoni-kai next week, r-right?  No, not next week. Never.  The Imoni-kai will be an extra story in the tankobon, calling it.  Please tell me we will get an pool OVA.  <br>Since they're animating most if not all of the volume extras, they probably will save Alice and Erina's pool for the OVA.</br>  No spoilers pics yet?<br><br>So... Someone could translate these dialogues?</br></br>  <br>Though it's set a little before the prelims, it is a side story chapter, so it could be done as an OVA. If they keep teasing it and don't animate it at all though, then that's just wrong.</br>  <br>It's been translated and typeset.</br>  <br>How old?</br>  <br>Here, anon. You can find all the translated extras here:<br>http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd/</br></br>  <br>Not him, but thanks.<br><br>These are always cute.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the only thing missing is the recipe book omake. That's been translated, but since casanova said they'd do it, the typesetter here deferred, iirc.</br>  Will Gigganigga save this arc?  <br><br>Already have raw?</br></br>  <br>Yes. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128222683 </br>  <br>No. He is easily one of the worst characters in the entire manga.<br>I'm sad they brought him back.</br></br>  <br>I'm looking forward to the extras from volume 14.

The sauce was really tangy and salty, but when paired with the roast it really adds to the flavor.

O.o  <br>So Tosh made Souma's eyes look overbright on purpose because he had this scene in mind all along? BASED</br>  <br>Maybe because she is too bland and people are tired of her. Seriously does she feel like a main character during this arc?

English chapter can't come soon enough. <br>I really want to know how Souma and Mimasaka formed a partnership.</br></br>  <br> The combination of Souma, Mimasaka and Megumi will beat an elite 10 leading one of the strongest clubs in Tootsuki <br> Erina and Hisako as 1st years are doing exceptionally well, whilst being in the most competitive area against many of the other elite 10s <br> Alice, Hayama and Ryou are only going to be 1st in their weak district <br>They just wasted their festival.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be 2 more festivals thought.</br>  <br>Oh shit....</br>  I love this chapter.   Yugi literally getting fucked because his restaurant is TOO popular   <br>A nail that sticks out will just get hammered down, after all.</br>  <br>Not really. It's common in real life especially in tourist areas that when a restaurant gets popular it attracts similar restaurants trying to catch the segment of people discouraged by the queue, those in a hurry, or new visitors who only know the area as "the X food district" and don't know which specific restaurant is good. If the competitor is no good of course some people would just see that the inconvenience (long queues/wait/higher price) is worth it. But if the competitor is just as good then they can choose not to be inconvenienced.</br>  <br>I wish Mimasaka was the MC</br>  <br>Yeah but the only reason Souma can snatch away customers like this is because Yugi's restaurant is attracting such a large amount of attention.<br>People love his food but even with the big-ass building he uses customers have to wait in line for longer and on one page it looked like they were being asked to leave their table to make way for new guests. <br><br> Queue Souma rant about how you can't treat your customers like that </br></br></br></br>   giganigga gets a waifu, he copies her blushing   <br> being asked to leave their table to make way for new guests. <br><br>Holy shit that would never fly here.</br></br></br>  <br>He will win the childhood friend acting as Souma.</br>  <br>I think he might get meat instead.</br>  <br>I don't know much about that stuff, is that from redrawing?<br><br><br>yeah I mentioned before that Erina would have the line problem if she wasn't using a reservation system. But Yugi is focused on making money over everything else (presumably for his promise with Tsukasa) so it's not surprising.</br></br></br></br>  <br>things I never knew I wanted, until now</br>  <br>I imagine it went something like,<br>"Hey, I need someone who can cook exactly like me. You in?"<br><br>Souma doesn't sweat the small stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't redraw, sorry.</br>  <br>And that goes back to Yugi's motivation being happiness at people being enslaved by his cooking, rather than happiness at them being happy.</br>  <br>The big question is whether or not Mimasaka still works for Eizan. We haven't been told whether he does or not. If he does, Eizan might have told him to help Souma any way he could just to screw over Yugi.<br><br><br> When Souma travels the world, Mimasaka steps in as Souma and runs Yukihira's. <br> no one ever notices </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one of the tracks<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pjt<wbr>Y4l6iWak</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That's a really good OST.</br>  Karaage arc soon.  <br> Horizon meets Oda Nobuna </br>  <br>I want to see more Takumi in the festival.</br>  <br>It comes from bad scans, which are usually magazine scans and stuff. It's why weekly series are usually done by experienced cleaners/redrawers. Look at the page of this scan. You can see the art from the previous page seeping through because the pages are so thin. Normally scanners put a white sheet behind the pages when they scan something iirc. But cleaning's pretty easy once you get some experience, which I don't have. It's probably not the cleaners holding it up, most likely it's the QC guy taking a long time. It's always the quality checkers for some reason.</br>  <br>I tried</br>  <br>kek. <br>At least you tried anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh god, poor Hishoko.</br>  <br>ah, gotcha. I suppose they could have asked anon if he would rescan it with a white sheet behind it. He might not have done it, but no harm in asking.</br>  <br>YESYESYES</br>  Mah Giganiggah!  <br>Ayyyyyy</br>  <br>She needs to wear the glasses more often.</br>    <br> that filename </br>  <br><br>should be something about how people are wrong on the internet, or cant stop now people are talking shit about my waifu etc<br><br>alternatively, she sees your dick/porn folder</br></br></br></br>  how long until live? same place?  1 hour until new episode.  <br>Neet isn't listing it. If he don't stream it just use Douyu.</br>  <br> those eyes </br>  What I hate the most about this show is how much it makes me want to cook.  <br>I ship her with Takumi</br>  <br>Why is that a problem? Sounds like a good thing.</br>  <br><br>I bought a cast iron skillet and I've been using the shit out of it. This anime awakened something in me.</br></br>  <br>SHIT TASTE</br>  <br> Not bad </br>  <br>Learn and practice an useful life skill that's both potentially healthy and saves you money in the long run. Why hate that, anon?</br>  <br> gay x lesbian <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>*jobber x jobber</br>  <br>Any more?</br>  <br>Hishoko didn't job against currynigger though, she plain got beat when she was expected to plain get beaten. She's simply weaker than him, not a jobber.</br>  <br>he is talking about Hisako, not Alice anon.</br>  <br>It's their servers.</br>  I wonder who would win between kurase and megumi in an awawawawa-off   episode airing <br> thread up <br> nobody discussing it <br> nobody posting screencaps <br>am I in the twilight zone or did we just stop caring all of a sudden</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the first time I'm not seeing the livestream, since it's Kaarage I would just see it later.</br>  <br>I will miss the stream, I want someone to post screencaps.</br>  <br>I keep having to change server on this shitty chinese site.</br>  kurase in the ED running behind meat  <br>Did the OP change this week?</br>  eizan's full body and face shown after the ED, not just a shadow with glasses. him and isshiki following erina to meet the other E10 members at a round table to talk about election candidates  <br>missed it, sorry. the part that changed last week though was the broccoli around megumi, week before it was tomatoes iirc. so that will probably be the same kind of deal this time too.</br>    Next week of course should wrap up karaage. I think this week was the first two chapters, plus the end scene from 37 to introduce Eizan as one of the elite 10.  <br>Jesus, I still can't understand the difference between simply losing and jobbing. As far as I can understand jobbing is when stronger character loses to weaker character because plot armor or shit like that. But why do we assume that Takumi was stronger than Giganigga and not weaker like in Hishoko-Hayama situation? Giganigga got one more point in preliminaries and he was in harsher block too.</br>  <br>So how well did Sugita voice Eizan?</br>  Will Yugi run away in shame?<br>Will Houjou take over China RS?</br>  <br>Deep as fuck.</br>  Have you worshiped Erina-sama today anons?  <br> yfw Eizan removes his glasses when in serious mode </br>  <br>when people say jobbing on here it usually means one of these things:<br><br> they lost to set up some other guy as a real threat <br> they lost to someone who really wasn't a big deal after all <br> they lost because they were overhyped to begin with <br> they lost for bullshit reasons and should have normally won <br> they lost because the other guy isn't supposed to lose in most cases <br><br>in takumi's case, it's some combination of the first three. in alice's case, it's mostly the last two, but also a bit of the third.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Imagine Yugi ending up in red and getting expelled.</br></br>  <br><br>FUUUCK</br></br>  <br>3 days selling well, I don't tjhink so</br>  Who's your Prison School waifu?

Because she's only 1/4 Saiyan, the form consumes Ki faster than she can gather it just like when Goku was SSJ3. Wat do?<br><br>a) Gather the Dragon Balls and wish to be made into a full-blooded Saiyan?<br>b) Have Trunks build a time machine and travel back to before Frieza blew up the planet in search of what few good-hearted Saiyans there were in order to repopulate the species?<br>c) Other?</br></br></br></br>  <br> c) Other? <br><br>I would go for this.<br><br>I would guess there's still pure Saiyans around the universe, Toriyama would just pull a Tarble and pop some out of nowhere that survived.<br><br>Also, I prefer that Pan being a 1/4 shouldn't be an obstacle for her SSJ form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gather the Dragon Balls and wish to be made into a full-blooded Saiyan? <br><br>You know what? Why not?

She might as well not be called a saiyen, maybe like a "pseudo saiyen" or something.  <br><br>Tsk, yeah you're correct.<br><br>But I was thinking more in lines in just sticking with one style and with a relatively "new" cast and start from scratch.<br><br>I mean, Oob, Pan, Bra and Marron are practically blank slates while Goten and Main Timeline Trunks could use more characterization and development. Hell, Pilaf Gang can also be thrown there.<br><br>Just having the old characters, hmmm no, Just Vegeta and Goku either taking the roles of mentors or doing something else somewhere with appeareance here or there and having these kids take the spotlight.<br><br>I read in another thread that Trunks and Goten decided to become sword masters and Pan trains to become a master herself according to a game whose story Toriyama wrote. That shit has potential.<br><br>Same with Bra, who also got fighting potential apparently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Next episode Murderfish incoming, some people is going to hate it and others gonna love it (specially TF).<br><br>The playlist with specials (actually 20, this guys throw one after another):<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And the character songs of every girl<br><br> Miia <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oeZ<wbr>A87zIICk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Papi <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e3R<wbr>xycLwmnQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Cerea (I'm spiderfag but I love this one) <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qJO<wbr>Q2siJ2j4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128832704#p128832704">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck that's a huge snake.
