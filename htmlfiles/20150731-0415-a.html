[ Chapter 48 was translated by an anon last night<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128726<wbr>493<br><br>What do you guys think of the time skip? Was it inevitable? <br><br>Hina grew up to be a fine woman. Not sure if mature though.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  i don't think she matured enough but i bet she got some common sense.     Chapter 48 was translated by an anon last night <br>At first I was "Are you fucking kidding me, I read chapter 48 a few days ago"... and then I realized "oh I read the raw".</br>  Can't wait for Norway scans to insert their MEMES  There's only so few timeskips I don't mind.  Just gimme Anzu,  <br> Nitta is even more of a grumpy old fart now. <br> Hina is the exact same. <br>I bet Hinami is at least mayor of Tokyo by now.</br></br></br>  <br> Hinami <br>Hitomi! Fuck me.</br></br>  <br> Oyabun: Isn't it because he is imitating me? <br>Oh my god.</br></br>  HOLYFUQ where has this been mai whole life, this mango too grood.  <br>you are too slow.<br>was there a time skip? <br>did they ruin the lolis?</br></br></br>  typeset scans where? mega/mediafire where?  <br>Norway scans should be doing it</br>  When is the next hinamatsuri release on magazine? August 1st?  <br>August 20<br>Norway scan can take their time.</br></br>  <br>the magazine is coming out on the 15 august but the raw are availabe a few days later.</br>  <br>Damn<br><br>Thats too damn far from now. How can I wait for that long</br></br></br>  <br>She's like a perfect incarnation of a JK.</br>   I don't really mind the NORWAY, to be honest.   holy shit i can't wait to see how hitomi changed and how much of a perfect daughteru anzu has become.   I'm back bitch <br>Perfect chapter.</br>  <br>What if Hitomi's schtick now is "mature girls in childlike situations?<br><br>Also, this might have more character development than most shounen manga I've read.</br></br></br>  <br> What do you guys think of the time skip? <br>I don't like it.</br></br>  <br> Chapter 48 was translated by an anon last night <br><br>Fantastic, thanks guys.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, Nitta and her have a similar pose in the "after" image.</br>  <br> Hina: You still only do stuff to make it convinient for yourself <br> Nitta: Peacefulness is the best <br> Nitta: Then I will be resting there <br> Hina: That room again... <br> Hina: He only shuts himself in there ever since we moved... <br><br>Oh shit, Hina has clearly more neurons now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Suddenly a flying Nitta. </br>  <br> Nitta: At modern times like this, Yakuza are a thing of a past. <br><br>And here we go.<br><br> Naito: But you did cause an incident once before... <br><br>I'm glad the characters still remember it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oyabun: We can do whatever we can within our power for you <br><br>When they want they can be surprisely nice.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love Hina and Nitta together, is like having a slice of life of Gin-san and Kagura.</br>   TIMESKIP <br><br>What the fuck? With literally no warning?</br></br>  <br> Hina: But it is big amount of money <br><br> Hina can distinguish between big and small amount of money now. <br><br>I'm moved to tears.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> With literally no warning? <br><br>You missed the previous chapter.</br></br></br>   skipping Big Mom for Kaidou <br>GODA<br>O<br>D<br>A<br><br>Also faggots it's clear that after Kaidou fucks off the Kidd Alliance will also go after him making one of the following arcs (besides zou/wano) Two alliances Vs Kaidou!!<br>Get hype you stupid niggas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SHANKS <br> Kaidou we're busy being drunk <br> SHANKS PLEASE KILL ME <br> Kaidou go home please we don't have time fo- <br> SHANKS PLEASE TORTURE ME TO DEATH </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Big Mom is already Sanji's Nakama</br>  <br><br>Well that might be true, but I would think because Kaidou appears to be really negative also.</br></br>  A few seconds later.<br><br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Irrelevant, that one doesn't have One Piece in the title you retard.</br></br>  <br> Kaido went to the war in the hopes that Whitebeard could kill him <br> Shanks intercepts <br> "Yo Kaido, remember when Roger gave you that scar on your stomach?..Well i've put my faith in a kid called Luffy, he really reminds me of Roger, so if you want a proper fight, wait until he develops some more. <br> "Someone like Roger you say? Okay sure" </br></br></br></br>  <br>It does.<br>Catalog finds it when used in text, title or picture.</br></br>   &gt; <br> no subject <br>retard</br></br>  <br><br>And no niggertalk in the OP.</br></br>  So who beat Kaido 7 times?<br>It's fairly obvious they didn't 'beat' him.. he only allowed himself to be captured to see if he could die then strolled out on his own accord when they failed.<br><br>I'd say his scar was given by Roger so<br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whitebeard<br>rogers<br>shanks<br> moria </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he didn't wait that long for Luffy to do it then, since he just tried to an hero off a sky island once he heard his drug dealer was busted</br>  <br><br>Honestly, if you don't you that it's enough that the word is anywhere in the OP post, you're showing your new.</br></br>  <br>Sengoku, Garp and Kong for the marine side.</br>  <br> garp beating anyone <br><br>hearty laugh<br><br>He needed sengoku to take on shiki</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>If you think that the subject field has no value, you reveal yourself as release day cancer.</br>  <br>I'd find it kinda lackluster if all the big guys from now on are taken down by alliances. Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. Luffy wants to be the new Roger, and can barely solo Doflamingo. He'd need to be a hell of a lot stronger than what he is now. If all the big bads are taken down not by singular man, but a group of weaker men, then that would mean that this generation is weak as shit.</br>  <br>Garp is grandpa Monkey, don't underestimate him.</br>  <br>It has little.</br>  <br> Whitebeard, while sick and injured and dying stood up to the top marines all at once <br><br>Maybe those three all at once, but pretty sure Kaido would shit on them 1v1.</br></br></br>  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</wbr></wbr>  <br>The question is how the hell is Luffy supposed to beat him. Up till now, nothing points to the direction that Luffy can take on even a single admiral, yet he's supposed to beat Kaidou, who is arguably capable of taking on Kizaru and Akainu at the same time.</br>  <br> Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. <br>That's never been stated.</br></br>   A kaidou   <br>  Roger apparently could solo Whitebeard. <br>No, they were equals.</br></br>  <br><br>It distinguishes the true thread and is supposed to prevent multiples like this.<br><br>Unless you want it becoming the same level as Narutofags.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not showing his eyes <br>Kaido is Doflamingo all over again.</br></br>  <br> Kaidou wants to be hardcore but Shanks won't let him </br>    <br> Two alliances Vs Kaidou <br>One can only hope. I'd definitely prefer this over Kaido/Kid/Apoo/Hawkins vs Luffy/Law/Big Mom.</br></br>  <br>He'll steal his shades</br>  <br><br>I thought the statement was that Whitebeard could at best fight Roger to a draw, but otherwise lost their battles.</br></br>  <br><br>Not while it is 'live' - but it has greater value when searching on the archives.</br></br>  <br>Luffy won't solo any Yonko until Blackbeard, for now with Kaido going suicidal again, he'll probably fight another Yonko<br><br>I would then guess the all of the Strawhats will take on the weakened victor of that battle, just like when Blackbeard's crew beat a weakened Whitebeard<br><br>Shanks will be taken out by another Supernova alliance or Blackbeard, which leaves Luffy with defeating Blackbeard alone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off release day cancer.</br>  <br>This multiple would have happened anyway, they posted it a few seconds apart from each other.<br>Multiples are prevented simply by making it possible to find the thread in the catalog by searching for the keyword (One Piece in this case). Do you know that you can search the catalog?<br>If it's in the title or somewhere else in the OP is fucking unimportant.</br></br></br>  <br>no it was stated that ROGER could fight whitebeard to a draw<br><br>not the other way around <br><br>Whitebeard is the marker you compare everyone else to. Roger's fight style apparently has some trick to it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure when Whitebeard was introduced it said he fought Roger as equals.</br>  <br>Nah. Roger was the king due to all the conquering and sight seeing he did. Not by all he defeated.</br>  <br>It was.</br>  <br>Kid is so cute.</br>  <br><br>See;<br><br><br>I know you can search in the catalog.<br><br>However searching in the archives is a bitch as it brings up every instance of one piece if done normally - searching subject field only brings up subject field.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> of course I am <br><br>Alvida had no idea who she was talking to</br></br></br>  How hilarious that mangastream gave manga panda so much hate for translating Fujitora's conversation correctly in the previous chapter, when it was mangastream who was wrong.  <br>Roger was way older than Luffy with a lot of experience behind him, when he ruled the Grand Line.</br>  <br>Just realized, this implies that when roger and whitebeard fought, no one on white beards side ever died.</br>  Question: How the fuck did Shanks take on this beast, how strong is he? The fight would seem ridiculous because there's literally an order of magnitude between theirs respective sizes...  <br>Also buggy says without a doubt whitebeard is the strongest pirate. Kaidou fags btfo<br><br>I take buggy's word over everything</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Lao G.</br>  <br> rubber man vs quake </br>  <br>Whitebeard is dead</br>  God Usopp vs Captain Buggy fight where they're both scared shitless of each other when?  <br>Kaido has been defeated 7 times, captured, etc.<br>It is most likely a mistranslation saying he's the most durable since both panda and stream translate badly.</br></br>  <br><br>WB isn't alive anymore though.</br></br>  So does kaido know doffy is done for or not?  <br><br><br>Last thread or the one before that people were discussing creature over man which was the strongest during whitebeard's reign</br></br></br>    <br>Shanks defeated Kaido day before Marineford if Laws statement that he can't be reasoned with holds true.</br>  <br>Soon. The warlord system is closing in on dismantle. Buggy will have to go or stay in the new world.</br>  <br>Fucking western assholes! Because of them WB's badass Jolly Roger must be changed.</br>  So now that the arc is ogre, what has been the most satisfying moment in the entire arc?<br>For me it was this one</br>  Poor Doffy. Got his kingdom taken away from him, got his ass kicked, betrayed by Viola and Law, Trebol and Vergo are most likely kill, and now a suicidal,immortal giant wants to personally murder him.  <br>benbe D. man?</br>  <br><br>I don't think Kaidou is going to fight the starwhats. Luffy is strong with his new, MUH GAINS skip leg day-gear, but Kaidou appears to be an endurance fighter, while Luffy is a one pump chump.</br></br>  <br>Well shanks was able to use his conq. haki to knock out whitebeards men when he boarded their boat. Rodger probably did the same to avoid other casualties or maybe they were the only 2 that fought.</br>  <br><br> defeated <br><br>We don't know that for sure - Shanks just stopped Kaidou going to MF.<br><br>Maybe he showed him a cool place to try and suicide?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you mean lock doffy up in his rape basement until he produces a smile. Every morning he comes down and asks Doflamingo if he made another smile. Doffy says I told you I can't. Gets raped. Door slams shut. repeat<br><br>It's like a modern day prometheus</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Luffy does have someone in his crew who matches that.<br><br> inb4 the never-ending battle of Zoro and Kaidou <br><br>10/10 would read.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if you cut up a devil fruit in half and two people ate one half each?<br>Eating the whole thing doesn't seem to be mandatory since Kaku peels his.</br>  <br>Luffy oneshot Hajrudin just fine</br>  <br>Why do I love these?</br>  <br>Oda already answered this<br><br>there will always be someone who eats one piece first. The other pieces loses it's power immediately<br><br>even if it's down to nano or picoseconds.</br></br></br></br></br>   &gt;implying Shanks &gt; Kaido   <br>I never knew I wanted this until I read this post.<br><br> Zoro learns how to cut lifeforce </br></br></br>  <br>followed up by the complete letdown of robin not even needing observation haki to stop hakuba completely. Rebecca barely dodge his shit. Hopefully kaidou fight will be much better.</br>  <br><br>Strongest Man=/=Strongest Creature. <br><br>Also, he's dead. Kaidou took on the title next.</br></br></br></br>  Kaidou's reveal did not disappoint me in the slightest. I actually love how he has a goofy side to his character.<br><br><br>maybe not the most satisfying one, but when Doflamingo activated the birdcage it was a truly 'oh shit' moment.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well either that or they both give up because they can't win.<br><br> Kaidou goes off and cries because he can't die again <br> SH continue </br></br></br></br></br>  OFFICIAL YONKOU STRENGHT RANKING<br><br>1.

Is it any better in the manga?  It's like she is wearing diapers.  <br>Well, it could be that it's somehow not a 6 inch deep ocean and that she was snorkeling somewhere that's not the shore.<br><br>Just a thought.</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought Yuki's holes in her socks where because they were ripped.</br>  <br>The manga is infinitely times better yes.</br>  <br>Is this especial true with how they manage past and present events?</br>  <br>They'll be all together dancing and eating at the end.  The zombies I mean. </br>  <br>where did the stockings go?</br>  <br>There are only two(?) flashbacks in the manga and it's all about Megu-nee, seeing how the anime is going it's going to be nothing but flashbacks for the next couple episodes.</br>  <br><br>Shovel-chan has the best butt.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jyjytrqxtp.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>   18 years old girl    That soothing ED music <br>Who said this wasn't a healing anime</br>  <br>How did they get away showing this multiple times?</br>  <br>Draw something better then, you twentysomething man.</br>  <br> That ED </br>  <br>Took them off so they don't get dirty while she slicks to the though of Kei.</br>  <br>WTF man.

A PS4, Wii U, and Not-Splatoon game show up in the recent manga chapters.</br></br>    I don't understand, isn't she the tomboy? Why is she wearing a fucking garterbelt?<br> Not that I'm complaining. </br>  <br>It's probably one of those perpetual present-day settings.</br>  <br>I really, really, really like this picture.</br>  <br>I wish to bite her thighs lightly and enjoy licking that area with my tongue.</br>  So that ending some confirmed she died right?  <br><br>Tomboy is shovel, she's just the kouhai</br></br>  I think this is first gakkou gurashi ep that I was disappointed with. They removed the silly boys hitting at Miki at the shopping mall and made Kurumi somehow super competent compare to the rest of the people that fell prey to zombie.  Animation error on the door sign at 10:33. I wonder how they missed it.  <br>yes, that's the joke, congrats on figuring it out</br>  <br>I still can't draw as well.</br>   removing every other character from the mall <br>For what purpose?</br>  What's the purpose of fucking up the timeline like this and filling almost half of the anime with flashbacks?  <br>Shovel is the tomboy, Miki is just a slutty boy.</br>  <br>But the color fading out and Kurumi becoming The One was the best part of the episode.</br>  Interesting.  <br>They finally dropped the ball and it was going so well too.</br>  <br>All it confirmed or me was that they were crazy lesbians for each other. Previously just thought they were friends.<br><br>Also this anime is making me a manga snob. Everything they change is worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Just the stream, downloading the subs.</br>    They need to stop cramming that fucking dog into everything, Jesus.  <br>Their relationship reminds me of those 2 girls from corpse party that were in a similar situation and the other girl leaves and consequently dies too.</br>  <br>But there's a reason audio is better on vinyl and it's not a technical reason, they just fuck it up on purpose on the CDs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudn<wbr>ess_war</wbr></br>  <br>That's no way to talk about Megu-nee.</br>  <br>I wouldn't talk about Megu-nee like that, I love her.</br>  <br>You can't expect every episode to be 10/10, no anime has ever done that before.</br>   Megu-nee suddenly in the car <br><br>They don't even care anymore.</br></br>    <br>I would guess because it's harder to animate and the VA are too expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. The mall episode and the other survivors were the best thing about that entire volume.</br>  I'd let her eat my brain  <br>That's real art.</br>  <br>According to the anime timeline I thought this was taking place before she died or something?</br>  "It was like the ending of the movie we saw a long time ago."  <br> implying all the past three have been 10/10 </br>  Is the anime any good?<br>I read up to 35 the other day and I forgot the anime was airing.</br>  EP3&gt;EP2&gt;EP4=EP1<br>I still love it.</br>  <br>Its death will probably be the last episode or something.<br><br><br>This was the only good part of this episode...but it was so good.<br><br>Did anyone else think the ending was like painfully corny? The song was great but I feel no emotional connection towards 'whats her face' at all so it all felt kind of forced? Like the anime was super aware and cocky that it was creating an emotional scene but it really wasn't at all and just came off as embarrassing.<br><br>Like when a starving artist isn't aware that their art sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow there.  <br>Yuki pls. The outing was after the Megu-nee reveal and now they're fucking up because they skipped things.</br>  <br> 35 </br>  So when do they eat the dog?  <br>this came out better than expected</br>  <br> Megu-nee bites Taroumaru instead of Kurumi </br>  <br>Corpse Party the one girl was explicitly gay for the other though.</br>  <br>She needs to be sure not to let go of Kurumi like that.</br>  <br>Go away Akane.</br>  <br> You can't expect every episode to be 10/10 <br> every <br>Keyword anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Batoto still only goes to 35, guess he read it there.</br>  <br> I feel no emotional connection towards 'whats her face' at <br>You a shit, animeonlyfag.</br></br>   The escalator doesn't work <br> We're trapped here! <br>Fucking first world bums</br></br>  <br>Nothing is skipped everything is flashback worthy.</br>  <br>It's like he elevator in L4D.<br>You're forced to use it even though you really don't want to.</br></br>  <br>Oh...oh god that could actually happen...</br>   dat ED <br>anyone who knew the title?<br>Is it their original composition or just borrow it?</br></br>  <br>Did the mall refugees at least made a cameo appearance? At least the cool guy (was he a medical student?) and the girl who NTRs Kei?</br>  <br>Couldn't be assed to search the archive for 36 and 37.<br>Did read 38 earlier today.</br></br>  <br>I was expecting camera to pan out while Kei slowly bends towards Miki.</br>  I keep forgetting that Miki wears garter belts. Every time I catch a glimpse of 'em I just get this ravenous surprise boner. Fuck.  Any shots of Miki's delicious garters?  <br>I wish I was as stupid as you so my raging boner occurres more often.</br>  Why is Kurumi so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  I really like the manga, but it says a lot about it when HOTD's outbreak is more realistic than this. Really? No quarantine or anything? Everything goes to shit in one fucking day?  <br>Memory of a goldfish, anon.<br>Memory of a goldfish.</br></br>  <br>Miki pls.</br>  <br>She has as little (maybe even less) dialogue in the manga, you serious?</br>  <br> everything is flashback worthy <br>That's the fucking thing though it shouldn't be a flashback. You expect me to believe a teacher would let a student to drive a car who has no experience in it?</br></br>  <br>The zombies are the worst part of this series. They stopped being relevant a long time ago, besides zombie Megu.</br>  <br> audio is better on vinyl <br>Lol. It demonstrably isn't</br></br>  <br>Her character is more fleshed out there, you can see her fall in love, you can see her overprotecting Miki. It's not all about how many lines the character has.</br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loud<wbr>ness_war</wbr> <br>It wasn't even emotional. The song felt corny as fuck. This episode is the very definition of manufactured drama.</br></br>  <br>Who said there wouldn't be any /mu/tants in Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  Ruu appears fucking everywhere, it's the tanuki all over again.  <br>That's not what I wanted to quote, damn it.</br>  Didn't anyone told those idiots to not use ELEVATORS in case of emergency?    <br>People lose common sense in panic.</br>  So I take it this episode was shit?   using an escalator in an emergency situation <br> feeding the useless dog precious supplies <br> leaving the safehouse alone and unarmed <br>this anime is still getting better and better <br> Miki best girl </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was sub par and is setting a trend of perpetual flashbacks that don't need to be flashbacks and weren't flashbacks in the manga.</br>  <br>They even get a kiss  in a dream. </br>  Why did they overdramatize Kurumi getting to the car? There is too much action in the anime.    <br>You really think that the teacher is still alive?</br>  <br><br>*elevator, sorry</br></br>  <br>It's kind of silly to have her origin flashback story in the 4th episode. They could have just not had her in the first 3 episodes and then introduced her in the 4th. The decisions they are making are so questionable. Also that fucking dog.</br>  <br>It's not that vinyl is good but CDs are made bad.</br>  that ending  <br>No, people like to exagerate.<br>Some retards even think Megu-nee is alive in the anime.</br></br>  As a filthy fucking secondary the only thing that keeps me interested in this shit is Yuki's sanity. Even the zombie gimmick has taken its course.<br><br>Man, I knew I should have just read the manga when I had the chance.</br></br>  Shovel chan a best  <br>Nah. Loved the classical touch to the ending.</br>  <br>She's Daryl if he was a cute little girl. There has to be action.</br>  <br>This is an imageboard, not a thumbnail board.<br>Stop using tumblrshit.</br></br>    <br> muh reading comprehension <br><br>No I'm saying they should've shown the bathroom scene before the outing because they're dragging it out unnecessaryly now.</br></br></br>  <br>They're blowing it.</br>  <br>Exactly, especially because they didn't give her any role whatsoever. She was even more invisible than Megu-nee. The direction is really sub-par.</br>  <br><br>Well no shit. Go read the manga.<br>Everybody knows it's superior anyway.</br></br></br>    there will be a happy ending, right?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Best girl of this season, no doubt.</br>  <br> leaving out the shovel <br><br>Nigger what are you doing.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like it how she kicked dents into the car roofs. She isn't only the best, but strong as fuck.</br>  <br>Shovel a filthy slut and worst girl.</br>  <br><br>you're right, havent noticed it when I was downloading it</br></br>  They cut out the part with the other survivors so people can't shitpost how much of a slut Miki is.  <br>Why couldn't they do that for Kurumi too? I guess they just couldn't stop every character from being a slut.</br>  <br>Instead they have her holding hands for half of her appearance and wearing garters in bed.<br><br>She's even sluttier than I thought.</br></br></br>  <br>God damn you shovel fags are annoying, and this episode isn't doing you any favors.</br>  <br>It's not slutty if they're both girls.</br>  <br>Just reread the chapters she's in. <br><br> she's concerned when her friend trips <br> they make two signs together <br> she thirsts for the leaders cock <br> she lectures her friend about drunks <br><br>She is in no way "fleshed out" and definitely not a character to feel attached to. She is just there to help Miki's backstory and in that regard I think the anime did it better. But as a whole the the manga builds the universe a lot better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garter belts </br>   Caught up with mango after last week's ep <br> Finally feel safe in these threads <br><br>It's a good feeling</br></br></br>  I thought the episode was fine. The big problem is that they are cramming everything pre-outbreak at once and seeing a zombie outbreak from different perspective is rather boring, the show makes huge "back and forths" and the storytelling suffers from it.<br>No mall incident kinda ruined it.<br><br>I really liked the ending. I have a knack for blues and thought it summed up the episode pretty well.<br><br>So far, not disappointed. Granted, NNB2's episode 4 was superior but this was good as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zombie, please</br>  <br>You should just leave. These threads are shit.</br>  <br> Boost up Shovel's relationship implications <br> Tone down Miki's interaction with guys to nonexistent </br></br>  Disappointment of the season  Anyone else feel the CG people and zombies was jarring?  <br>Shovel is the only slut now. Where is your god now, shovelfags? Even the mangaka left her as a slut when he could've changed things.</br>  <br>They both lost their lovers in the outbreak, now they need to take each other's hands to heal their hearts.</br>  This would be a lot less forced if they all carried weapons instead of just the Rize-clone.<br>The zombies are clearly slow and brain-dead, it wouldn't take much effort to keep them away with an object more than one foot in length.</br>  <br>  NNB2' episode 4 was superior <br>Of course it was, it was episode of the year.</br></br>  <br>CG people always look jarring. Too bad they didn't take advantage of it and make the zombies uncanny as fuck.</br>  <br>Calm your tits</br>  <br>But shovel is the only athletic girl in the group. Running &gt; Fighting.</br>  <br>The lack of budget is jarring</br>  <br> twitter <br>Oh no, there goes your opinion, sailing into the trash.</br></br>  <br>The girls are to cheerful for me, I miss the difference between Yuki's illusions and the reality. Kurumi and Rii should act more serious.</br>  <br>If the girls wanted to live, they would have done good to build up enough upper body strength to swing a metal rod around.</br>  <br>It would be a lot better if they were less explicit with everything. The manga is loved by so many because of its implicit nature. And introducing Miki from the start just to have her do nothing is fucking awful. The whole idea of a club trip is something WAY more outstanding than the previous theme of the show, where they just chill at the school. All the suspense is lost by having them making it only a flashback.<br><br>And fuck Taroumaru with a rake.</br></br></br>  <br>You expect me to believe that in a zombie outbreak out their entire school only these 4 girls survived?<br><br>You expect me to believe that zombies are a real thing?<br><br>You expect me to believe these girls are actually 16 years and older?<br><br>You expect me to believe that anime isn't real?<br><br>You expect me to believe that you aren't new?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is number, you fool. You cannot keep several zombies away with a single weapon. The other girls clearly are not as athletic as Kurumi.</br>  <br>Shovel is going to die and Yuki is going to win the Mikibowl, this episode confirm it.</br>   most likely not even a week into survival <br> the mall already looks this fucked <br>Clearly japanese buildings are not made to last</br></br>  <br>Fucking moogy, that nigger has literally single-handedly ruined at least 4 generals on /vg/ that used to be good. <br><br>He is a walking definition of shit-eating wapanese.</br></br></br>  <br> Mall completely fucked <br> Building next to it is fine </br></br>  <br>Thanks for sharing the opinion of some attention whore, that really changed my mind. Guess I'll drop the show now.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? The girls were also "cheerful" in the manga. They are playing along with Yuki. You really need to re-read the early chapters.<br><br> captcha is "Select all traffic signs" and there are no fucking signs. </br></br></br>  <br>Zombies are predisposed towards breaking windows.<br><br>See the school, where they destroyed every single window including the top ones that you need a chair or something to reach.<br><br>Zombies are serious about their window destruction.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even sure how the zombies would break the wall and crack the columns.</br>  <br><br>'Cause we all know, zombies always prey on the sweet smooth windows.</br></br>  <br><br> muh athletics muh athletics <br>Do you think the majority of people who went to war were athletic?<br>It doesn't take any effort to hold up a pointy stick and thrust it about in the air, any athletics beyond that were gained by necessity of living in a tough environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Go legacy bitch. </br>  <br> moogy <br>I forgot that literal fedora existed. The actual definition of elitist weeaboo, knowing some japanese won't change that.</br></br>  <br>  most like not even a week into survival <br>See this is why you don't make assumptions, they make you look retarded.</br></br>  <br><br>m8, even if this was an entire year into the situation, the mall wouldn't look that bad</br></br>  So will next episode have a short flashback during the flashback?  This has to be some kind of controlled test by Randall, otherwise the JSDF or US marines would have handled this by now  Would you a Mor?  Dirty slave.  <br>Yes.</br>  where is her pantsu?  <br>She has shit taste in husbandos, so it's possible that she would a me, in which case yes I would a Mor.</br>   I want her to use her lower body strength to leglock me and force me to impregrate her.   i literally fapped to all of her doujins..  <br><br>I suppose.</br></br>  <br>Absolutely.</br>  Post more mor san goi  <br>Slaves don't need underwear.</br>  Mor a whore.  <br>holy shit.. muh dick</br>  <br>Banning of slavery was mistake</br>  <br>You realize American slaves were dirty niggers, right?</br>  <br>Not every slave was nigger.<br>But every nigger was slave.</br></br>  No.<br>But I would superior genes.</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>She gave me foot fetish.</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>Too old.

Good job. </br></br>  <br>I don't use ratios to tune just intonation, just tuning devices. I used up to 11-limit to tune Harry Partch's octave once on an experiment, and a guy that I watched tuning a prototype of Nicola Vicentino's Archycembalo also used ratios, but I don't remember what limit they were.</br>  <br> Vincentino's Archycembalo <br>Sounds like a pretty active early music department you have there. I have to admit just intonation, specifically the 5 limit, sounds great on paper with all those pure intervals but leaves much to be desired in practice, even for the supposed "white key" music of the early renaissance where not many chromatic keys are needed. It's probably best left to string players and singers who can adjust on the fly.</br></br>  <br>this is perfeeecccttttttttitties</br>  also requesting this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ds1<wbr>3GP09Of0</wbr>  [ ]<br>i can play guitar but don't know shit about music theory. i want to get a cheap keyboard too, so i can play muh anime songs</br></br>  What did /a/ watched, expected and got?

Gone are the days of shows not getting a single sub group since crunchyroll and funimation. Good fucking riddance.</br></br></br>  <br>Gangsta is fucking garbage and neither the dialogue nor the visuals are particularly precious, so I don't see why anyone cares.</br>  <br>Doesn't work because Daiz is Finnish and TPP is Pacific trade pact.</br>  <br>Nah, just life got real</br>  <br>Blame /sp/.</br>  <br>I knew it wasn't going to live up to Black Lagoon 10 minutes into the first episode.</br>  <br>L U C K Y S E V E N S<br>U<br>C<br>K<br>Y<br><br>S<br>E<br>V<br>E<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  there's plenty of old stuff to translate. most of it isnt good, but it's there. i'm interested in a show from the late 90s called gandalla for example  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128784241 <br>You should go back to /v/</br>  <br>And OVA and movies and a lot of things.<br><br>But that implies,you know,working on the subs.</br></br></br>  <br> Bit bland but oh well <br>No, I won't deal with this. I'm not a fan of memesubbing, but sometimes scripts are just BAD.</br></br>  <br>Are you telling me you expect the fansubbers to go through the effort of translating the show themselves?</br>  <br>At this point the best option is start to learning japanese</br>  Those three extra days to wait for a decent raw must be really awful.<br><br>Nevermind that we're weeks behind and nobody actually gives a shit about having to wait a few extra days.<br><br>Better drop it just to be safe.</br></br></br></br>  What a bunch of faggots.  There is a need for more FUNi OCR slaves.<br>But so called fansubbers prefer to copy&amp;paste CR subs.<br>This clearly shows in the series that are being "fansubbed": most are also done by CR.</br></br>  <br>This type of posting is older than your entire family lineage</br>  <br>I thought fansubbers are okay with releasing things late because of stuff like muh BS11 as long as it ends up being better than CR/Funi rips.</br>  <br>＞平成27年<br>＞まだ日本語が分かりません<br>そんな事をしていませんの希望がある。</br></br></br>  <br>I bet a group that put Funi scripts onto better raws would get a lot of downloads.</br>  I only DL from non-trusted groups. Death to the cartel!  <br>Downloading Funimation is one thing.<br>But what you're doing is just reckless.</br></br>   there's no point in doing subs for a show if we can't get the most downloads <br>Guess I'll wait for a BD group to do this show, at least they still care about anime.</br>  You cant die if you never lived  <br>TTIP is the same shit for Europeans.</br>  <br>gangsta is utter shit though</br>   pick up all shows being done by decent sub groups even if i wouldn't have otherwise for no other reason than to show my support <br> am unable to drop things i've picked up even if they're shit and i hate them <br> sub group drops show i originally had no interest in <br> can't drop it because autism and i have to know what happens <br>fuck ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Daiz and his ilk don't actually care about anime, it's about being popular. 3 days isn't a lot to wait for better subs, but it puts them too far behind Funi and the speedsubbers. And they don't see the point in subbing if they aren't the most popular release. <br><br>Hence why they "lost interest" in the project. They never really liked the show or cared about subbing it in the first place.</br></br></br>  So Gangsta is lost? Or will someone else pick it up? I was enjoying this  <br>Those already exist.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128784241 <br>"moeshit" is till much better than your poor man's Black Lagoon /v/ shitter.</br>  <br>だって<br>勉強すればもしなくてもったって<br>難しいし面倒いし<br>正月から頑張てみるのために<br>今更暇なんかと思っていいんだから<br>横の物を縦にもしない</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh me? I killed a guy. Watchya in for? </br>  <br>Your choices are funi, funi timed to a shitty TV raw, funi timed to a better TV raw, or somebody who added some fancy type setting to Funi's subs that you can mux yourself.</br>  <br>HS is fine.</br>  Hi I don't usually browse this board. Assuming the same reason for the delay for Gangsta is why Horriblesubs haven't released their episode yet, what is stopping the new episode of Umaru-Chan coming out?<br><br>At risk of being called a 'moeshit watcher', I am watching and enjoying both. I don't know if there's a board stigma about this sort of thing so sorry.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a nice meme tbh fam</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone want to watch Funi or Crunchy anyways?<br><br>I'll wait for somebody to rip the blurays. Patience is a virtue.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't know if there's a board stigma about this sort of thing <br>The only people who use the term "moeshit" are /v/ fags anyway and there is huge board stigma about being form /v/.</br></br>  <br>Lurk before posting.<br>Use google.</br></br>  <br><br>Basically normies ruined everything with their sports is what happened.</br></br>  <br>Truth. The fansubbers in the 80s and 90s actually CARED about anime. Guys who subbed Escaflowne and LotGH.<br><br>Fuck the people from HS don't even watch anime. Just bots ripping CR.</br></br></br>  <br>We forgot to sacrifice a virgin to appease Lord Daiz as well as make offerings to High Priest herkz.</br>  What about Chibiki?  <br>I happen to know the guy who runs HS in person and I can tell you he's an annoying gay faggot with a horrible taste in anime</br>   Gangsta <br>who gives a shit?</br>  <br>They released the last three episodes of Cinderella Girls.</br>  <br>I could tell you that from his twitter alone.

I am glad somebody rips all those streaming sites but fansubbing it ain't.<br><br>Like I said I'll get the BD rips. Streaming is shit, downloading streams is still shit.</br></br></br>  Fan subbing died last year.<br><br>The scene is dead and can't be revived, All the good people left and don't give a fuck any more.<br>We're only left with meh or barely acceptable ones.<br><br>Least Funi or CR will never die.</br></br></br></br></br>   not just trusting in HS <br> enjoying shows without the drama of the fansubbing scene </br>  <br>This is how bad it's gotten. Where people think moe is bad. My god. Shounenbabbies have overrun this board.</br>  So despite being here since 2006 I never really gave a shit about who's subbing what unless one group was way better than another.<br>Who's Daiz?<br>That's an embarrassing question to ask but I always see shit-slinging against him but I never knew why.</br></br>  <br> Least Funi or CR will never die. <br><br>I recall those days when we had to wait week for translation <br>god bless HS<br>now I need to wait few hours<br><br>so I dont get what you all flapping here about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Poj<wbr>c_F9E47s</wbr>  [ ]<br>Crunchyroll is taking over everything anime related.<br>Soon you will not be able to watch anime without paying.</br></br></br>  <br>People who use "moe" as a genre and call shows "moeshit" are 9 out of 10 times crossboarders from /v/ who like Naruto and have seen less than 20 anime. Their opinions are worth less than dog shit. <br><br>If one of them starts acting uppity just tell them to go back to /v/ with the rest of the faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>It's been dead for ages.</br>  <br>Wait what? I'm not getting Gangsta today? Sunday is actually better, I'll just watch it on monday with Akagami</br>  <br>It died the moment HS started posted early CR subs en masse. With time CR translations became pretty decent so I don't have that much of a problem with it. The real trouble begins when CR is big enough to confidently go after HS. Then we'll probably start seeing HS clones popping up. It's gonna be a shitshow.</br>  <br>Do not speak his name aloud, lest you summon him into the pentagram.</br>  <br> With time CR translations became pretty decent so I don't have that much of a problem with it. <br>I don't even care about the quality of the subs that much as long as they are bearable. What really bothers me is the video quality.</br></br>  <br>Daiz has forsaken us.</br>  <br>No I haven't</br>  <br>Yep HS is good for people who want to watch shows NOW and don't care too much about quality. Basically 90% of anime watchers.</br>  <br>Was show about mecha cars<br>Fuck that doujins are good</br></br>    <br> Just bots </br>  <br> coming home from work <br> turn on your pc <br> microwave food <br> Download the latest anime from Horrible Subs <br> bring food to the table <br> anime is ready to watch <br> didn't have to wait days or weeks for subs <br> mfw <br>Nothing is more comfy than Horrible Subs, they're doing gods work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> telling Matsuda not to follow Light's instructions on the Olympics  <br>Every time</br></br>  <br>God damn, this list has tripled since the last time I saw it.</br>  <br>This. All my RSS are horriblesubs now. <br><br>Feels fucking good man.</br></br></br>  I don't mind HS. I think they are sufficiently good, though if some other respectable group is also subbing a show I will choose them instead.<br>However, I absolutely refuse to download HS when it's a Funi rip.

Can't do anything about the horrible hardsubs though.</br></br>  <br>Just watch Horriblesubs they always release quality content rather quickly.</br>  <br>I have two for most shows, one HS and one Hiryuu or whoever nice group picks it up.</br>  <br> you make sure to download the 1080p rips <br>Expand on that.

Keep whining or learn moonrunes already, faggots.  <br> HS correcting colours  <br>Since when does HS correct anything?</br></br>  <br>Well, I'm guessing it's possible to export CR subs and then combine them with some nice quality raws. I don't know why we don't have that.</br>  People actually care about GodrobeSubs?  bump  <br>Someone would have to put in effort. It's easier to just bitch about things as they are and pitch ideas.</br>  Speedsubbing is dead.<br><br>There will still be fansubbers who do it for high quality subs but those will take up to a week if not longer to come out.</br></br>  fansubbing is fucking dead and Daiz killed it with his penis  <br>I wonder why they aren't using CR video if they don't wait to wait 3 days for better channels.</br>  <br>It's an excuse you dense motherfucker, nobody's interested, especially not Daiz.</br>  http://underwater.nyaatorrents.org/<wbr>?view=comments-disabled<br>http://utw.me/2015/07/30/fatestay-n<wbr>ight-unlimited-blade-works-25-end/<br><br>It really is dead. Not even a question anymore. We're literally going to have to settle for HorribleSubs' god awful fucking encoding and nonexistent styling for everything from now on because "funi and cr are good enough lol"<br><br>When are we going to get new blood? Obviously this is just an excuse to get out of something they've gotten tired of doing. Will fansubbing really die with this generation?</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr>  Who is diaz?  Well UTW is officially dead now as well.  <br>I love the UTW is good meme.</br>  I miss the first Chuu2 sub wars with gg and UTW.<br><br>Now both of them are dead ;_;</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe if there were less shitposts like these they'd be motivated to keep going. Do you seriously think HorribleSubs are better? You can't possibly.</br></br>  <br>You just need to mention the Fakku fiasco.</br>   only alternative is Funi <br><br>Just kill me now.</br></br>  <br> shit group isn't shit because the other shit group is more shit <br><br>Fansbus are dead. They died when speedsubbing became a thing.</br></br></br>  <br>UTW post 2012 sucked balls big time.</br>  <br>At least they're quicker at subbing than UTW, and y'know, not dead.</br>   2012 <br> multiple fansubbers compete for your attention with almost every noteworthy show <br> more options than we ever needed <br> constant source of reliable subs for pretty much any show <br>I miss the old days. Fansubbing is completely dead</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love this meme too.</br>  <br>Yeah but don't mention it on /a/ or else your threads will get pruned, it seems like it doesn't have anything to do with anime and manga.</br>  When BD groups die then it'll truly be over.  <br>That is hilarious, wrong as shit though.</br>  Fansubbing truly died when gg died.  <br>Let me try to fit in mmkay?</br>  <br> sacrifice a virgin <br>But herkz is still alive <br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That video is so cringe worthy</br>  <br>Just like your life.</br>  <br>Seriously Why would game grumps do a video on a streaming site even if they dont review or watch anime</br>  <br><br>Nearly every popular YouTube channel is insufferable. It's literally worse than television. At least people on television don't know how insufferable they are before they do it, so it's almost forgivable in some sense.

But I'd like if HS/someone could actually rip all the show that CR stream worldwide.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh well, dropped.<br>I'm not watching Funishit.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz's minion.</br>  <br> people won't even watch funishit for free <br> they actually charge for the service <br>I can't stop laughing. Who pays for that shit?</br></br></br>  I thought Daiz was the fakku marketer now?<br>Does he still do that fansub thing?</br>  <br>I'm unsure if I'd watch Funishit even if they paid me</br>  <br>He still rarely does encoding stuff for anime because otherwise he would be banned on sight for being a completely useless marketeer.</br>  <br> Marketer <br>What? He's webdev for fakku. <br>And working doesn't stop someone from fansubbing, plenty of working people still fansub. <br>There's even someone working at a japanese animation studio and still fansub.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely it wouldn't be that difficult to get semi-decent video quality when fansubbers can easily do it?<br><br>There's just no excuse for this. But thanks to how business works we've got literally no other choice to obtain it legally.<br><br>This is why piracy is still rampant. Why would I pay for something when I can get it for free and better quality to boot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well then I'm the idiot.</br>   Daiz doesn't have a source for TVA <br> some stupid russian has one <br><br>Daiz, where are those super secret cartel connections of yours you were bragging about?</br></br></br>  <br>If Daiz cared he could have masked Funi like Vivid does or used CR. The thing is, Daiz doesn't care.</br>  <br> mfw i tried that for overlord but since funi can't deinterlaced for shit, i'm stuck with bs11 and its nice artifacts <br>Life is hard.</br></br>  Why are people surprised that fansubbing is dead? These days literally the only reason to do it is epeen and instead of getting epeen all they get is hate and shitposting now, literally no reason to continue. This is the future you chose.  Hi this is Daiz, ask me anything.  <br>Hi</br>  where do I get my ka-ruh-ow-keeh from now?  <br>Fuck America, and fuck European leaders for crawling into America's asshole.<br>There are enough trees to hang all politicians and billionaires.</br></br>  <br>Just keep lying, Daiz. I'm sure nobody will notice.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  How many people are actually still mad about Fakku going jew? All their shit will just get uploaded on Nyaa and Fakku is way too small to pursue any kind of legal action, so who gives a shit, we'll just get uncensored porn and the people who circlejerk on Fakku can start paying Jewcob to circlejerk.  <br>I just enjoy being angry at people.</br>  <br>There's still a lot but that's not the real problem. The real problem is the fakku shills and those who argue with them. It makes the sadpanda turn to shitposting every single time.</br>  <br>I'm pretty used to it, not the first website who has done it. Didn't use it before, not going tu use it now.<br><br><br> Nice numbers mate. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch what you like, anon.</br>  <br>2deep4me</br>  Why is this allowed?  <br>Why are you allowed?</br>  <br>No, please, continue sucking those cocks.

Now Nendoroid are like 3.9k and BQ are 5.2k<br>(retail discount costs)<br><br>Really not much different. When 1/7 scales are in the 11k range, 5k BQ aren't really that close in price. It's pretty rare to find a really high quality scale figure in the 8k range these days. Probably the last ultra quality 8k figure you will ever see again is Alter's Mikan. Then you will have to compare 5k BQ to 9k+ scales.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They wouldn't drill screw holes through glass.</br>  <br>Then you forgot to mention the quality of wave figures also took a turn for the worse, unlike pretty much every other manufacturer who got better, at least enough to make the price increase bearable.</br>   some faggot already hotglued this pochaco <br><br>Sucks that my pocha is still in the mail, I wanted to hotglue her first.</br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br>Nope. The Nisekoi BQ are pretty amazing. Chitoge is super nice. Both her and Onodera sold out, got restocked and sold out again.<br><br>Pretty sharp contrast to the Megahouse 5k 1/10th scale figures which shelf warmed for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>ANd nothing to write home about compared to the bqs that were released just because the price increase. <br><br>Also, doesn't help your point to be comparing them to megahouse statues, they are not even average for today's standards, and the smaller scales are jsut shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Restocks are no measurement of quality, Griffon does plenty of re-releases as well.</br>  <br>That is done all the time, although you are correct in that an assembly like that doesn't make sense for glass plates.</br>    <br> letting the nigger from /gif/ beat you </br>  <br> no new parform. <br>This upsets me.<br><br>Hopefully people buy the shit out of yuudachi on release and realize how nice they are. <br><br>If not at least momohime will be a last chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so bad I wouldn't throw it in the garbage <br>Don't want to insult the fucking bin.</br></br>  <br> Don't want to insult the fucking bin. <br> the fucking bin. <br>Yes because you show it so much respect as is.</br></br></br>  <br>ebin bro</br>  <br>Hotglue where?</br>  <br>They are nice? I will order one then. Thank you for your recommendation, anon. Shigure is getting one too. Pairing them up will be good.</br>  <br><br><br>I honestly like them more than figmas and Nendos.

I have found with time an patients that you can find almost any figurine / Plushie or Goods that you may want. At what price that is a different story. As you peruse some of the profiles you will see some that have embellished them thanks to being a donor to the site. Some features like a back ground picture are activated that way. For me I used some Jpegs and made my profile that umph.  <br>There as many ways you can customize your profile and as you get to know the site features you will be able to make this site your home.

Why does she have to be so goddamn expensive.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if all the MFC "greeters" used bots to post their shit. It's the only way they can do it so fast, unless they're all just sitting around all day waiting for people to make an account.</br>  <br>It has to be a script, do they reply back if you reply to them?</br>   All of that lewd Amico merch   <br>I fucking love figma and nendo both.

Maybe that's why my account can't post or report anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Popularity ranking and profile views. I'm more creeped that he's 40+, made anime themed pants, and always has to leave that Goddamn fucking emoticon everywhere.</br>  <br>What I like are figures that aren't ugly toys. If it doesn't look good it shouldn't be bought. Only casuals buy jointshit, they belong on mfc not here.</br>  <br> Someone mentioned in a recent thread that sometimes they get upset and report if people don't accept their shitty "greeting". Maybe that's why my account can't post or report anything. <br>Pretty sure I accepted their greeting when I first joined since I thought someone was actually nice enough to greet me.<br>Thats pretty ridiculous though.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you calm down bitch?</br>  <br>Tiamat does sit all day on fucking MFC. He wrote a blog complaining his workplace blocked the site from their network.Despite being popular anybody who had a good work ethic basically told him to stfu, and that work is for work, not fucking around on a weeb filled figure database. MFC made me slightly proud that day.</br>  <br>No. Jointshit is a cancer.</br>  <br>Fuck off back to /v/</br>  <br>God can she just fucking die?<br>11 figures for one character in a few months for a brand new show is goddamn ridiculous. And it's a shitty character too.</br></br>  <br><br>is that the Dollfie?</br></br>  <br>You are the only one here blowing a head gasket right now. This isn't even voicing an opinion anymore it's just flat out shitposting.</br>    ;_;    <br><br>This is cute, is this that one girl from Space Dandy?</br></br>  <br>I want one. Just like pic related.</br>  <br>Some of the figures had to have already been planned before the show even aired. She probably won't have any staying power unless there's a second season, unless the LN and manga are super popular. But if that's the case they'd eventually move on to other characters.</br>  <br>No, retard.</br>  <br>Based taste anon</br>  <br>So, did this come with just one hand or both?</br>  <br><br><br>Fucking god knows I hate joints, but these kind of doll have something that just makes me want them harder than any scale or thing I've got in my life. <br><br> Some of them even turn me on. How fucked up am I? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well please enlighten me</br></br>  <br>No, some idol or something. The figure was announced 2 years ago so who knows if it'll ever be released.</br>    <br>Dolls are cute, dude. Dollfags being autistic enough to use expensive equipment for taking pictures helps, too. I don't have one but I'd like to get one some day.</br>  <br>I don't think I could collect dolls because of the maintenance that goes into them.<br>They can be cute as fuck though.</br></br>    <br>Dolls don't fall under jointshit. For dolls, joints are half the appeal in the first place.<br><br>I'd buy one if they weren't so goddamn expensive.</br></br></br>  Who cu-poche here?    how is a neet suppose too afford this? I wouldn't think they get that much autism dollars.  <br>I regret not getting Dekacchu Wo. Wonder if they'll ever continue the line.</br>  <br>They're pretty cute, but I have no interest in buying them. although I have to say Kuroneko's cu-poche is absolutely adorable and makes me want her.</br>  <br>It isn't even that expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're really cute and I find interesting how well the Madoka Cu-poches combine with the Madoka RAHs</br>     The kokeshi doll that looks like someone is exclusive <br>God fucking damn you GSC!<br> Fuck you.   ;_; </br></br>  <br>I would say they could give nendoroids a run for their money, but I highly doubt they'll take off and get as many licenses and put them out as fast as nendoroids.</br>    <br>What's wrong anon? The GSC Online Shop ships internationally you know.</br>  <br>You've caught my interest.</br>  <br><br>Please, anon. <br><br><br><br><br><br>That's basically the thing that stops me from getting one, they are around 600$~ and is not that I don't have th money, is just that it feels like it's too much just for one thing. That said I'm sure one day I'll give in and get one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have just begun, I think that they need more time and of course they should make characters from more IPs<br>Some of the characters that they have done by now, doesn't have a nendo counterpart or any aticulated figure at all<br>Like the Dark Magician Girl or the IM@S girls or the Destroyer Div6 girls<br><br><br> according to keikaku.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just a doll. Older exclusives were better</br>  <br><br><br>Planelegs pls go</br></br></br>  <br>Dispatched so far.</br>  <br> Planelegs <br>You lost me anon</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think it was a good choice to acquire IPs that don't have nendo counterparts to start with to set themselves apart from nendos, although they still have some characters like Aegis and the Oreimo girls that have Nendoroids too.<br>I'd love to see the line take off and give GSC some good healthy competition.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you<br>They even will release the character mascots, which I personally find really cute</br></br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?</br>  <br><br>I feel you man, if a single dolfie did not cost more than what i earn in a month i would definitely own a couple of them.</br></br>  <br>Do you work part time, or do you just have a shit job?</br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?<br>These figures have magnets in their feets and the base have a metal plate, so you can make stand on their own without the help of a articulated arm (they come with one anyway for flying poses)</br></br>  <br>third world country.</br>  Anyone have any of the Medicos Jojo figures? I order 2 from HobbySearch and was wondering, do the top and bottom flaps come taped up? My figures boxes look new, except that there aren't any tape on the box openings, and the bottom of one box has a little dent that looks like someone might have opened it. Also another figures foot seems to have been moved slightly to the right. Could that have happened during customs? I live in the US if that matters. Never order from Japan before so I am a bit confused. Don't want to open them and check because I am autistic about shit like this and like my figures sealed.  <br><br>Thrird world m8. My wage is actually in the top 40%.</br></br>  <br>Wow that's actually perfect in my opinion.<br>I always wished figures would do that instead of pegs and claws.<br>Wish all figures used those types, Might consider getting one now just to appreciate that magnet base.</br></br></br>  <br>which one exactly bolibia?</br>  Does anyone know why they aren't up on the ami international site?  <br>JAPAN ONLY<br><br>Elsa was available in HLJ the first time she was in PO, IDK if now will be there for PO</br></br></br>  <br>She is on HLJ but Anna isn't. I could just get her from BiJ or if I want to overpay, CdJp.</br>  <br><br>Argentina. After all the taxes the Dolfie would end up costing around USD 1200, and i earn around 1300 a month.<br><br>Not only we earn shit money, but they rape us with the taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out all the jointshit in /v/ buyfag threads.</br>  Which one?    <br><br>Right. Could be the photo and angle, but i like her face better.</br></br>  <br>I'm from there too(I earn 21K AR$), also any order above 1000 u$s can only be picked up through a customs broker.</br>  <br>Blue. Highlights her figure better and the blue/white contrast is more interesting.</br>  <br>Some figures really need to come with a yaranaika face.</br>  <br>Though I prefer the expression from the white one.</br>  <br>I've wanted them to make the Cu-poche mascots since they started using them as models for the clothes, but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown.</br>  Can't wait to have this figure.  <br><br>The stuff about the broker is only if the original price is over that amount, that means pre customs taxation and does not include the 35% credit card tax. So it'd be safe to order a dolfie.<br><br>There is still the problem of them costing U$$ 1200 for us though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it includes shipping cost, not sure about how much it could be, an 1/4 is around 10K by EMS.</br>   brown hair   <br> but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown. <br>Yeah, but they showed this in this past wonfes, maybe they have plans for a alternate faces set like the one made by GSC, At least that is what I think that this image means</br></br>  Found this on Amazon for $22. I say it's worth the price.    <br>i want to cum on this anime girl</br>  <br> Cu-poche Extra <br> Anne mood faces and ponytail set <br> Kirakira, depressed, "Wakya~!" faces <br>Hmm, could be interesting. Still sucks that everything has to be bought separately, yet the base figure costs about as much as other Cu-poches which come with multiple faces and accessories. The mascots seem like they're there to be marketed as mini dolls than anything else.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a fucking foldable plastic box that is worth maybe 20 bucks. Not 50 and definitely not 70. Anyone who pays for that is legit retarded.</br>  Guys guys I need your help, I spent the past 2 hours searching for this, used every keyword I can, "任務娘", "任務娘抱き枕カバー<br>", "zero戦", etc. and the closest thing I found was a bootleg on rakuten auctions.

I can understand if it's one with a whole bunch of joints visible. <br>But all those accessories</br></br>  I hear there's a bilingual Japanese/English print of Devilman that Kodansha put out in 2003, is it still around/what do the covers look like? I'm digging around on eBay and there's quite a few different editions of the manga from Japan so I have no idea what I should be looking for.  <br>some look fairly shitty. not just the joints, also the faces being off.</br>  <br>Unfortunately. I've learned my lesson.</br>  <br> RAHs are great <br><br>I could never use that term to describe them.</br></br></br>  <br>Send a request to cancel you retard. Ignoring payments just increases the chance of you getting banned.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>He deserves to be banned.</br>  <br>Some of them look terrible. Probably not worth bothering unless it's your waifu and even then it depends on which one it is. The megukas for example look fine.</br>  <br>Okay, but stop calling me a retard. Theres no need for tha.</br>  <br>banned for just one cancellation (unless he had more than four in the past or have been warned before)? what are you smoking?</br>  <br>Oh really, which ones? The only one I remember being terrible is the Yuno Gasai one. My RAH homuhomu is probably my best figure.<br><br>Maybe I just got lucky. Also Yukari's RAH looks pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean little shit, fuck off, people make mistakes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128799037 <br> lmao <br>ayy<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a retard, how do you preorder something and only realize you don't want to pay the price afterwards?</br>  <br>I miss the days when Amiko banned people first time instead of this letting people cancel nonsense.</br>  <br> people make mistakes <br>And people need to pay for those mistakes.</br></br>  <br> cancel nonsense <br>This shit is Amiami's fault. Don't let companies fuck you in the ass. A customer should always be able to cancel a preorder.</br></br>  <br>It happened to me once.<br>I can't explain it.<br>Probably autism.</br></br></br>  <br>WITH THEIR LIFE</br>  <br>that never happened, but they were less tolerant in the past, sometimes they sent you a warning after 3 cancellations, now the norm is 5 if not more, depending of the customer.</br>  <br>No. Or conversely: if they demanded deposits up front they would have some reason top keep that if you cancel.<br>But they're nice enough to not ask for deposits.<br> I would <br>Get rekt, casual-preorderers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I once missed a payment since I completely forgot that I ordered something. Luckily they didn't ban me, but I apologized anyway. Had to order my item from N-Y, though, since it was sold out on Ami by then.</br>  <br>That's another myth spread by buyfag.</br>  <br> thinking you can get banned just that w/o having been warned first. </br>  <br><br><br>Fucking homos the lot of you. <br>Its like you work for amiami or something, defending it because im canceling one fucking item. <br>Ha- laughable man. <br>It really kills me that you fucking queers are so ready to just be plain negative any chance you get. Im simply canceling an item and you autists get triggered to the max.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would rather a deposit if it means you can get a refund and cancel if you need to. <br>I seriously think it's retarded to defend this sort of mentality. You do not gain anything from a system like this where poor buyfags must live in fear of being banned by the great tyrant Amico.</br></br>    <br> poor buyfags <br>That's your problem, buyfagging isn't for the poor.<br>They don't like cancelations because most items are made to order.</br></br></br>  <br> register <br> place pre-orders <br> don't pay them <br>You'll get banned.<br><br>It's different as a returning customer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pretty cringy</br>  <br>My nigga got shoulders.</br>  <br> because most items are made to order <br>Err, no. But they have to tell the supplier how many they need and do some estimations of how many they will sell.<br>Alternatively the merchandise might be limited and cancellations screw with their bookkeeping.</br></br></br>  <br>I registered with my dad's name and had a combined order with three scales, I didn't pay because they wanted me to use paypal and not my credit card(I even emailed them), and didn't get banned.</br>  <br> cont. <br>Imagine they know they can get 200 of a certain exclusive item, the preorders are quickly sold out.<br>Then half of the people cancel their preorders or don't pay at last notice.<br>They just lost all those sales and have to sell the item again.<br><br>It also screws over those people who couldn't pre-order because it was 'sold out'.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant poor as in the other definition of the word. <br>I can understand why they don't like cancellations but I still think the customer should have the right to do it. Of course abuse of the system should result in a ban.<br>But anyway I think a lot of the fear may be not necessary. You don't hear about anons who are long time customers getting banned. It's just the uncertainty that's annoying. I also understand why they may be reluctant to clarify publicly, their real policy on cancelling.</br></br></br>  <br> I even emailed them <br>The reason is right there.<br> you tried <br><br>If you keep pulling that shit you're a goner, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope that nigger gets the 1/3 Pochaco and hotglues it to cuck all other fatty lovers.</br>  <br>I just didn't want to use Paypal, no problem with my credit card though.</br>  <br> implying being a Pochaco fag isn't punishment enough <br>Merciless, man.</br></br>  <br> fat-enablers <br> enough punishment <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>To them it's all about confidence in your orders.<br>If they think there's a bigger chance you screw it up again instead of actually buying the items you order they'll b&amp;</br></br>  <br>It's just one or two guys forcing that shit.</br>  <br>Maybe I'm some kind of humanist after all.</br>  Do the One Piece Excellent Model series figures look as good in person as they do in the photos?  <br>whoa</br>   Hand-bottled by amiami staff <br>Fuck. 7 years late on this.</br>  <br>Almost.<br><br>Not like Griffon or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>That looks hideous. Excellent model my ass.</br>  <br>It's not really their fault he looks like that.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>How the fuck can anyone hate Doflamingo's design. As for the figure set they just seem really 'solid' feeling.</br>  <br>still waiting on mine... I am so hyped</br>  <br>Hyped like on your way to McDonalds.</br>  <br><br>They might as well just start making cast off of her. She isn't even much of a character in the first place.</br></br>  <br>They look pretty good(except the older ones before 2010), plus many of them are cheap these days.</br>  <br>Fuck cast off. They should concentrate on the scale as it is not add some useless undressing feature.<br>Most of the time it looks like shit either with or without the castoffable components, depending on what they focused on.<br><br>I prefer a good looking and cheaper figure without paint transfer and shit like that.<br> or clothes I never remove/add </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> overlapping bases <br>Was that just to get them all in one shot or do you really have it like that?</br></br>  <br> overlapping bases <br>Please.<br><br>PLEASE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could help you but I really never heard of this and where to get it. Is this a series or just an individuals private work?</br>  <br>You know you can use your credit card through paypal.</br>  <br>The feathers are too much, I also dislike most of One Piece's designs.</br>  <br>A doujin daki sold last C85.</br>  <br><br>Yes, I arranged them that way just for that photo.</br></br>  <br><br>Will this Nami make all the other Nami obsolete?</br></br>  <br>That's fine, but don't trash talk the figure line please.<br>They do a good job.</br></br>  <br>Each to their own I guess. Personally I like the design precisely because it's too much. <br><br>Of course, I had faith in you Anon.</br></br></br>  So did badpicsfag every post the full wonfes album on an imgur?  <br> post timeskip nami <br> shit mouth <br> dumb pose <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have her? The Alter scale's face looks strange to me and the GSC scale is easily <br> $200 <br>now</br></br>  <br>This is worse than Porkchop.</br>  <br>The best one so far is without a doubt mugiwara v2</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br> pre-time skip Nami <br> only shorter hair and smaller tits <br><br>Distinction without a difference<br><br> shit mouth <br><br>It is staying true to Oda's art brah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For $200 it probably isn't worth it if for any figure if you're unsure about the face.</br>  <br>Contender for worst base ever.<br>A friend has it and it's a good looking figure, but dat base, mang.<br>Not too hard to fix, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This fig is super unimpressive.</br></br>  <br><br><br>disgusting. why is everything from one piece so hideous?</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those times they really didn't do a great job on the promo shots (and base).</br>  <br>work on your reading comprehension</br>  <br>and how much is that prize? I wouldn't pay more than 2K for her</br>  <br><br>That's your opinion</br></br>  <br>Maybe I phrased that poorly but I what I meant to say is that I love the GSC scale but it's too expensive. The Alter scale is cheaper but I'm unsure about the face. So I'm checking for prize figures of her and I rather like this one.<br><br>Really? I thought it looked alright for a prize fig<br><br>It really is but it's cheap and probably the only thing I can get of her. <br><br>About 3K. There's a normal Hanekawa version for a little under 2K I'm considering as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Foreheads.<br><br>Also mouths.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying prize figures ever have any good bases, but somehow her's is ill fitting and terribly contrasting.<br>The decal doesn't help.</br></br>  Is Viz's translation of All You Need Is Kill good?

However, due to certain problems with the genetic code Umaru ends up being extremely lazy and acts like a slob when not in the public eye when she hits puberty. As a result Umaru is sent to Taihei in order to "fix" her behaviour<br><br> Okay I lied about that, but given how the manga is essentially a gag manga it wouldn't be too farfetched </br></br></br></br>    <br>speak for yourself namefag</br>  ep 4 when?  <br>next week</br>  <br>Because she is a literal shit.</br>    <br/>  Any one know any other animes where the plot is focused around brother and sister but without them being in love or other incest shit?  <br><br>She's trending.
