How strong are the police shields?  <br>The gloves? Those were standard issue for us at least. Nice gloves. Great for punching someone, especially with the hard rubber on the knuckles.</br>  <br>The pilots in the series are kind of dumb and arrogant.</br>  <br>That's due to the activation altitude more than anything. You get more destruction by heat/blast wave at higher altitudes but that means you spread the waste further meaning it's less concentrated. You still need a fission "bomb" to activate the fusion core.</br>  <br>The smaller Dragons (Wyverns) are routinely shredded by AA fire and such.<br><br>The larger, more mature dragons like the Ancient Dragons and their offspring are significantly more durable, but they do eventually get downed by a hefty amount of combined arms.</br></br></br>  <br>They were trying to cause a sonic boom over the capital to scare them.</br>  ***,104位/***,100位 (***,922 pt) [*,**8予約] WORKING!!! <br>***,230位/***,255位 (***,489 pt) [*,**0予約] WORKING!!! <br>***,276位/***,267位 (***,416 pt) [*,**0予約] To Love Ru Darkness 2<br>***,298位/***,316位 (***,593 pt) [*,**1予約] To Love Ru Darkness 2<br>***,393位/***,357位 (***,806 pt) [*,**1予約] Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3<br>***,593位/***,614位 (***,*38 pt) [*,**0予約] Shimoneta<br>***,640位/***,670位 ○ (***,*76 pt) [*,**0予約] Hetalia The World Twinkle<br>***,843位/***,942位 (**3,400 pt) [*,*66予約] im@s CG 2<br>**1,202位/**1,408位 (***,123 pt) [*,**0予約] Overlord<br>**1,320位/**1,231位 (***,*87 pt) [*,**0予約] Aquarion Logos<br>**1,580位/**1,421位 (***,*20 pt) [*,**0予約] Wooser <br>**2,172位/**1,960位 (***,*24 pt) [*,**0予約] GANGSTA. <br>**2,366位/**3,305位 (***,*63 pt) [*,**0予約] Chaos Dragon<br>**3,669位/**3,499位 (***,*78 pt) [*,**0予約] GOD EATER <br>**4,726位/**4,418位 ○ (***,171 pt) [*,**0予約] Junjou Romantica 3<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127643813#p127643813">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are incorrect, but you tried.</br>  <br>what</br>  What numbers shows what?

Watch yourselves.</br></br>  <br>That was a fun day.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know.<br>It's a very common fan discussion of the game.<br>The Blue Dove for the Princess (in game tale)is interesting too.<br> a bird who has been gravely injured in an unspecified incident and is about to die when he is found by the Princess from the nearby castle The Princess nurses him back to health and puts him into a cage in her room. The Dove is satisfied with the situation and comes to care about his savior a great deal. <br><br> The Worm, he comments, cannot fly and can only set his foot onto that one tree, so he believes the tree is the entire world.The Worm tells him that he can fly, once he becomes a pupa and then, an imago, and that it doesn't matter whether you can fly right now or later. Later, when the Worm will be able to fly, he won't be able to run anymore, so now he is exploring the tree as much as he still can. <br><br> the Tortoise will never fly and is locked inside his carapace until his death, but for this reason, he has a long memory.The Dove flies to the lake where the Tortoise lives. The Tortoise tells him that the carapace offers a great protection, just like a cage. He is very surprised that the Dove voluntarily left his cage and says that the best way to deal with danger is hide inside the carapace until it is gone. <br><br> Long time ago, during a period of wars, Razgriz conjured a tempest that raged for seventy days, until no living being survived in the land, including the demon itself. After a long time passed, however, a traveler visited the land and healed it, helping people resettle it. The traveler then left, saying "I am Razgriz".The Old Tree, revealed to be the Orion Poplar itself, then gives the Dove a magic fruit, saying that it can become whatever he believes it to be, a medicine to cure the Princess or a poison to kill her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> file deleted  <br>What the fuck was it?</br></br>  <br>Go search it up in the archive, I deleted it because it's against the rules.</br>  <br>True love.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br/></br></br></br>  Requesting Tharja in a casual version of her outfit please, or a Mirage interpretation of her.

Anything would be appreciated, though since it's the 4th of July weekend a drawing of Mai eating a hot dog would be fitting. Perhaps something similar to this for example:<br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/16<wbr>39519</wbr></br>  Requesting my wonderful waifu, Mimi.<br><br>Possibly playing with fireworks or watching a fireworks display, but anything cute is greatly appreciated.<br><br>She'll share her vodka with you if you draw her!<br><br>As always, take it easy, and I hope everyone has an amazing weekend.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  As far as I can see /a/ agree this was a really good episode, which is a good thing.<br><br> Nice animation <br> Nice designs <br> Following the LN (at least for now)  <br><br>Now what are the studio going to do, rush the entire LN like retards or do a good adaptation with 3 volumes in 12 episodes? or maybe 24 episodes with the actual 5 volumes?<br><br> Use spoilers, /a/tards cry too loud </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shes more of a Monk Druid hybrid who also seems to have a bit of bowman abilities. Shes got farsight and can manipulate sound while in the mountains.</br>    <br>Notbad/10</br>  <br>Surely you meant read?</br>  <br>Accurate.</br>  Why does she wear the mask?  Great first episode but I can see it getting old pretty quick unless it goes in an unexpected direction   <br>Shit you just made me remember that Norigami returns in september.<br><br>Is Norigami even supposed to be a shonen anyway? It seems extremely female friendly</br></br></br>  <br>Is she getting the red rocket there?</br>  <br> forced <br>enough with the buzzwords</br></br>    <br>Thanks a lot anon.<br><br><br>It has a female mangaka if I recall correctly. <br><br><br> fanbase shitposting <br>You should kill yourself already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Elves are for  Precure thread   <br>Keep watching it on Himado until it's out  like I am. </br>  Here we go, into Smile's final arc!<br><br>Well that's fun. Whatever he's alluding to, they kept it under their hats all year, presumably to make the finale more exciting for their generals. I can live with that.</br></br>  Sure sure, but is this really their final form?<br><br>All kidding aside, I was really looking forward to the final 1v1 matchups. If it's going to end with a big group fight, here's hoping it's a crazy one.</br></br>  <br>Well, not their final form. But their final form isn't very intimidating.</br>  <br><br>Don't expect too much on the finale of smile. Just have in mind that the mid season climax was better.</br></br>  Why was Tokiomi so shitty? Why did he follow the strategy Archer told Rin when they first met? Did he really think locking himself in the basement and being a total pussy towards Gilgamesh would make him win?  <br>He'll have more personality since TM is trying to distance itself from the cliche eroge stuff. Tsukihime was made during a specific time so Nasu had to make him more of a self insert. He'll probably have as much personality as Shirou in the remake. Weebs will still be able to self-insert but he'll be an actual character</br>  <br><br>Pretty much this. Shiki always had a personality, but it had to take the back seat due to the nature of the VN. .</br></br>  <br>No he didn't.</br>  <br>Shiki seemed pretty chill in the beginning and then the further you went down every route the less personality he had aside from the crazy</br>  <br>I agree. That's why "Nanaya" is far more popular with the fans than regular Shiki. He even ranked above Shirou in one poll when they split Tohno and Nanaya as separate characters.</br>  Compulsory Gatchaman CROWDS thread.  <br>This is my favorite op this season for now. The music is nothing special but the animation and cinematography is amazing.</br>  <br>And yet everything he does has some sexual undertone?</br>  <br>Is there a scorebook for sale or something? Where's that from?</br>  <br>I dunno.<br><br>But they always go back to saying Katze is like a child and just wants to play.<br>He's flamboyant as all shit though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> OD is maybe gay. <br> maybe </br></br>  How does /a/ feel about this franchise?  <br>Exactly this, though I think The Different Story is great.</br>  <br> Madoka <br> force for good <br>She didn't do shit</br></br></br>  <br>Not mad,  ___sad .
