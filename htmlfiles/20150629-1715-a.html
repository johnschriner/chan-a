She's gay as fuck.</br></br></br>    Wait. when did a Ducky fig get announced? This is the first I've heard of it.  <br>And you are just a large maggot with limbs.</br>  <br>Proofs?</br>  <br>What are you so angry  boat? </br>  <br>No, but Mutsu is.</br>  <br>Noooo shut up its not canon yettt</br>  <br>The captain of the ship was gay.</br>    <br>It's made by FunnyKnights.</br>  <br>Are you serious?</br>  <br>The anime doesn't count for anything</br>  <br> No  </br>  <br>That's not how you spell kaga. Ill never get why people even ship NagaMutsu.</br>  <br>Nope, glorious Tanaka shall mandate Fubuki, Fubuki and Fubuki. Because god forbid that any other MC does not match up with Yoshika and Miho for the GuP x SW x Kancolle crossover</br>  <br>Just mindbreak her, it's way easier.</br>  <br>If he wanted to match with them he'd use a Fumikane ship.</br>  <br>She's cute in the apron I admit but she wouldn't love me and I don't have the nerve</br>  <br>Kaga isn't either.<br>Why don't yurifags stick to the actual yuri characters?</br></br>  <br> Ill never get why people even ship NagaMutsu. <br><br>I don´t like Nagato much, but fuck me if Mutsu isn`t retardedly hot.</br></br></br>  <br>Who would be a better MC?<br>I like the idea of Yukikaze as one.</br></br>  <br> Kaga isn't either. <br><br>did you even  watch the show </br></br></br>  <br>Kagerou, Zuihou, Akiduki, Shigure, Yukikaze, Zuikaku, Ooshio.</br>  <br> the show <br>laughing_dragons.jpg</br></br>  <br>The anime isn't canon.</br>  <br>Yes, and it was terrible. Good thing it's not canon.</br>  <br> What is Akaga tag <br><br>I never doubted that, Im just talking any ingame lines to back up their homo behaviour in fanart, and they even forced it in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Fanart is what it is.</br>  <br>I bet you think Kirishima doesn't need glasses either.</br>  <br> Good thing it's not canon. <br><br>Is there even canon to this?</br></br></br>  <br>Game lines.</br>  <br>The game.</br>  <br>So are we in a imaginary world where ingame lines are not canon and only kagawife fanart is canon? Ok.</br>  <br>Fanart isn't always based on game lines. The case of NagaMutsu is one of those.</br>  <br>We're in the world were Kaga says 私…感情表現が…その…。提督…私…これでも今、とっても幸せなのですけれ<wbr>ど… when you marry her.</wbr></br>  <br>I never said any fanart is canon at all.<br>There's nothing implying Kaga wants to fuck Akagi at all. Akagi doesn't even mention Kaga outside of seasonal lines. The reason she worries about Akagi is because she was Akagi's escort ship.</br></br>  <br>Technically Nowacchi was Akagi's escort ship.</br>  <br>Both of them filled that role.</br>  <br>Don't call her Nowacchi.</br>  <br> - Maybe Teitoku actually appearing <br>why does this matter so much? the anime ruined everything it touched, do you want TTK to suffer the same destiny?</br></br>  <br>So that means I can waifu her, yes?</br>  <br>Did you link the wrong post?</br>  <br>Why did they turn her into a Pokemon?</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  Guys what day is it? Its  Nenohi day   <br>Of course you can, only takes 1 million exp.</br>    <br><br>yes, it was meant for </br></br>  <br>Not really. While Japanese carriers were often grouped together in a strategic sense, they operated separately in the fleet itself. At Midway for example most of the carriers were typically several kilometers separated from each other. They were too far apart to be escorting any of the other carriers.</br>  <br>So all of her charming personality relies on that one line? Ok.</br>  <br>To be fair, the anime TTK seemed to be a bonafide kuso TTK anyway</br>  <br>He's saying that she can't possibly be "gay as fuck" if she says a line like that.</br>  <br> make terrible decisions <br> make even worse decisions <br> keep making bad decisions <br> all because you had a dream where you got to wife Fubuki <br>The most kuso</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why Fubuki<br>Just why Fubuki<br>I don't understand</br></br></br>  <br>Fubuki is not just a starter ship, but plain enough to be the MC.</br>  <br>Lost Kisaragi, lost Shouhou, separated Ooi and KTKM.<br><br>Full Indo. Never go full Indo.</br></br></br>    <br>At this point /a/ has sunk more ships than them.<br>Sinking ships makes you a kuso, unless it's Naka or a girl you dislike, then it's a-ok!</br></br>  <br>I can't even see how it's possible to sink a ship unless you're playing the game while you're half asleep or something.</br>  <br> separated Ooi and KTKM <br>But that's a good thing.</br></br>  <br>It became ridiculous the second she became flagship</br>  <br>Power leveling, we've all done it before.</br>  <br>You know it was because he wanted to bang Bucky</br>  <br>Yeah but we didn't yet know about it then.</br>  Do you like her swimsut, /a/  <br>I'd have liked it better if the show was about Fubuki eventually leading a ragtag fleet of boats to victory. And it was that, for one just episode. Writers didn't even know what their show was supposed to be about. Such garbage.<br><br>I loved Atago though. All thirty seconds she was in.</br></br></br>  <br> boats </br>  <br>Well, I never implied that she was Ooi CV version. But are we actually forgetting all of the other lines? There's no way with such lines she's 100% straight. Also where's the waifu trait that everyone sees? She literally gives you the time of the day, tells you that the food is ready (not that it was handmade from her), and some Akagi's stuff. Dont get me wrong, I dont hate her, just neutral, but she's just a tryhard that probably respect his superior, that's all.</br>  <br>Also, Murasame.</br>  <br>I'd hai hai her hai hais.</br>  <br>What does she hold in her mouth in the new official art? Also if she appears again, maybe Ill keep her this time, I promised myself If we had swimsuit sprites I would buy a new dock expansion.</br>  <br>I like Bono.</br>  <br> What does she hold in her mouth in the new official art? <br><br>:P</br></br></br>  <br>Can you tell me how having lines mentioning Akagi means she's a lesbian? Close friends are a thing that exist.</br>  <br> What does she hold in her mouth <br> hold in her mouth <br> hold <br>Its her tongue.<br><br>cute</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why's her tongue orange then? Too much nicotine? No wonder I scrapped her.</br></br>  <br>Look, you may not like it, but Kancolle was practically a yuri show. Some of the girls in this were pretty gay in this, including Kaga and Akagi.<br><br> N-not canon <br><br>It had the creators blessing, and if it didn´t, he obviously didnt care enough to object.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> glasses </br>  I like to think that shipgirls on the sea and below would held a big party when the event end.  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Fix your monitor, it's pink on mine.</br>  <br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br>  <br>Those hips, they could bear the child that will someday rise up against you, and fight you to the death.</br>  <br>literally who cares</br>    <br>While I agree the anime is pure shit, he is right in that there was some direction from the game's devs, or so the anime devs said there was when everyone turned against them.</br>  <br>laughing_dragons.jpg</br>  <br>Oh look, people trying to pass the blame for making a shit product unto someone else.</br>  <br><br>He's not wrong tough, wasnt the animation supervised by the game's staff?<br>I mean, most of the characters were accurately animated. For example,kaga was kaga, how would a "canon" version look then?</br></br></br>  <br> For example,kaga was kaga, how would a "canon" version look then? <br><br>Not gushing every time Akagi hit on her, obviously.</br></br></br>  Didn't Mutsuki's artist say that you should disregard the anime on her twitter?  <br><br>Everything was invalidated when the midway hime transformation happened</br></br>  <br>Yes, yes she did.</br>  <br>Akagi wouldn't even hit on her.<br>Seriously, she mentions Kaga literally twice in all of her lines.</br></br>  <br>She drew cute girls so I trust her ideas more.</br>  <br>When are the other drewships getting kai ni. I need revamped Akeboner and dank-chan and crab girl in my life.</br>  <br>Why though? Why is the idea that the Abyss doesn't evolve into stronger forms? Look at the original Anchorage and Seaport demons, and the newest ones from this event.</br>  <br>Listen to all of them, 7 times including seasonal ones, and admiral 4 times only. Akagi doesnt care, its obviously onesided.</br>  <br><br><br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> boat </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She hit on her once in the bathhouse whatever IIRC. Mutsu hit on Nagato all the time.</br>  <br/>  <br>Because they're supposed to represent an area.</br>  I want to make a child with daijoubu  <br>Airfield Hime is supposed to be the Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, not the Airfield at Midway that would also be named Henderson field after the Battle of Midway.</br>  remember to treat your hardworking destroyers to the gift of motherhood.  <br>Assuming you're talking about Kaga here, none of the lines imply she's lesbian for Akagi, it's not like Tatsuta or Ooi<br>Unless you're going to say that visiting a friend that you just said doesn't care means they're fucking</br></br>  Currently working on /g/796992/56de71c097/<br><br>I'm going to work on /g/827103/243cf4822d/ next, which is by same artist as Fubuki to Hajimeru<br><br>Dumping won't be done until  3 weeks from now </br></br></br></br>  <br>After Darwin now suddenly appears at Sri Lanka I don't even know anymore.</br>  <br>so you hate the anime because you can't self-insert rather than the horrid CGI animation or things like , ok got it, you're cancer.</br>  <br> wanting S2 to ruin all those girls <br> implying S2 will show the TTK <br>They'll continue with the "TTK = viewer" bullshit. They may have recognised the anime was underwhelming, but they won't learn a lesson. They won't change a thing.<br><br><br>You don't expect much from retards.<br><br><br> It had the creators blessing <br>And that was exactly the problem with it.<br><br>Tanaka just forced his fantasies on the viewers. He also obviously didn't think enough of us players to think that we'd even be half as incompetent as anime TTK.<br><br><br>Sure, but their personalities were anything but accurate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I dont know shit about Kancolle but theres a few I liked. Shimakaze, Nenohi, and that 18 submarine. What are some good Kancolle who are loud, angry, and obnoxious that I would love?  <br> Kancolle </br>  <br>Eugen and Hiei comes to mind.</br>  <br>When the fuck did I say any of those things? What the hell? I happen to DO hate it for those reasons. I don't want a self insert character, either.<br>I just it was out of character. I can dislike that too, you know.<br>Stop strawmanning.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaga and Shiranui</br>  <br>Its a widely accepted abbreviation stop sperging out at people.</br>  cute?  <br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br>  <br> Nenohi <br><br>That's a first.</br></br></br>  <br> loud, angry, and obnoxious <br>Sendai,  It feels great to marry her <br><br>Kagafag plz</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but it is not an accepted terminology for the characters.</br>  <br><br> using the name of the franchise to refer to the girls <br> implying it's acceptable here <br>'no'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuu.</br>  <br>literally how did you get all those assumptions from that post</br>  <br>It's the opposite. We were forced to self-insert as the admiral.</br>  <br> Fubuki: wait, that's not my pantsu </br>  <br> Sure, but their personalities were anything but accurate. <br>Weren't some of the girl's lines changed to correlate with the anime though?</br></br>  <br><br>Im not following what in the world you mean.</br></br>  How many images have you saved from Pixiv today /a/? I'm at 551 right now.  <br> Yuu <br> Not superior tanned </br></br>  <br>I certainly didn't feel forced to do so at all.<br>Stop assuming that everybody is a loser like you, when we are really all of us many different kinds of losers.</br></br>  <br><br>I rarely save images anymore. Mostly due to there being too many created and myself being satisfied with my collection.</br></br>  <br> Weren't some of the girl's lines changed to correlate with the anime though? <br>I'm sure you meant anime's lines were changed to correlate with the game. The word you're looking for is "added".<br><br><br>You mean we were forced to see from Tanaka's point of the view. Or are you just simply new here?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> who are loud, angry, and obnoxious <br>All the best ships are</br></br>  <br>Ooi went full psycho lesbian</br>  <br>In  the poster said "What are some good Kancolle." In this instance he used to word "Kancolle" as a way of referring to the characters, which is typically frowned upon in /a/ Kancolle threads. This prompted these responses   pointing what those posters took issue with, the use of "Kancolle" to refer to the characters instead of "Kanmusu".</br>  <br>Only some of the girls, and only some of their lines. For example, CL Ooi is still the same as before.<br><br><br><br> You mean we were forced to see from Tanaka's point of the view. <br>Preety much this. It wouldn't have been bad enough by itself, but they had to go on to say "the admiral is the viewer".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the flying fuck would a guy who just said he knows nothing about it know that term and use it? Plenty of people say "Who is your favorite SHOW TITLE/GAME TITLE?" in sentences here.</br>  <br> the use of "Kancolle" to refer to the characters instead of "Kanmusu". <br>That autism though.</br></br>  <br>Well, they're the fleet collection, though. It's not wrong, per se, just not the best choice of autism.</br>  <br>I will do it for her. She will see my dedication then, yes?</br>  <br>How big is your collection if you are satisfied with it?</br>  <br>You're not really dedicated unless you're like that one Hagurofag.</br>  <br/>   Finally got Kumano <br>I have the five bears, I no longer need this life.</br>  <br><br>Who's he and what did he do</br></br>  <br>Use them for next event then.</br>  <br>Can you not tell? He married 6 pages worth of Haguros.</br>  <br>6 Pages at 100 plus an unremodeled Haguro, a Kai Haguro, and a Kai Ni Haguro at 150 I recall.</br>  I did it.  <br>25 times now. What's it like having 25 kids?</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  Arashio.  Is Yukikaze a beaver or a hamster  <br><br>Sexiest loli ship.</br></br>  Is it me or does Wo really love her yogurt?  Sieg heil.  <br>What happened in the image?</br>  <br>A pantless retard.</br>  <br><br>Well that describes it a little better. Is that considered poligamy or just a continuity error?</br></br>  <br>Is it agreed that the best Bismarck doujinshi are the ones where she pisses herself?</br>  <br><br>1583 images. <br><br>This was the first image of my collection. ‎July ‎02, ‎2013, ‏‎11:40:45 PM.

Yui is a nice girl.  My mostly baseless speculation on Yukino's request:<br><br>1. If we have more than one volume, I can see Yukino asking for distance from 8man/Yui, thinking she needs to be alone to overcome her issue. Which would be a mistake because I don't think totally isolating herself from her friends is the way to go. That sort of arc would take more than one volume though to conclude the LN.<br><br>2. Some sort of request about dealing with Haruno. Perhaps "Help me make peace with Haruno". Exactly how it would be phrased and what it would entail (When Yukino says it it might actually sound like it concerns Haruno at all) I don't know but care would have to be taken that Yukino doesn't lean on her friends too much in it. It's got to be something she takes the initiative on and Haruno has to see that.<br><br>3. Help me steal one of these cat sharks from the aquarium because I think they're cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Isshiki Iroha~!  <br>I can support a yukino going off on her own journey end. Make her rethink her priorities.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm</br>  <br><br>I prefer "going off on a journey" for Hayato more than Yukino.<br><br>I mean she can well go abroad for college, but I would rather it not to be for the purpose self reflection. That's that hand-wavey trick author's use sometimes.<br><br>  I have a problem. <br>  Go somewhere far away. <br>  Some stuff happens. <br>  Come back and I'll all better. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukinoshit is reduced to a moeblob autistic damsel in distress dragging everyone around her into her bottomless pit of loathing and self-hatred negativity <br><br>Ew.</br></br></br>  A few thoughts. This series is kind of strange in a way because the protagonist of the entire story has basically already experienced his catharsis and it happened a long time ago. 8man has realized the importance of genuine relationships and knows that even he can find love despite his character's beginnings as someone that thought he was above it all.<br><br>So that brings us to the love triangle, and it's not something 8man can solve on his own. The way he shot down Yui's non-genuine solution is just a giveaway that the only proper way to bring closure for the three of them will be through an open confession or just letting the course of time dictate which pairing becomes the strongest naturally. But in the context of this LN, we are literally running out of time. This story is now firmly about how Yukino decides to deal with her problems and whether or not part of that involves opening up to 8man and Yui about her true feelings along with solving her family situation.<br><br>So now that that's all out in the open, who's going to make the move and what will it be?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>To me, it'll be her studying abroad at an elite university overseas or something. It'll be her own desire that isnt influenced by anyone else. She's in International Class J for a reason<br><br> Goes on own path <br> Family understands is accepts her decision. Her going to Harvard wouldnt tarnish family reputation (which is everything for an affluent family like hers) <br> Also allows hachiman to get over idea that relationships will always reset in life as people grow up (see his convo with Hayama about relationships in Vol 10) <br><br><br>I think if she goes off to college, it be under her own volation because thats what her heart desires. Her self reflection would have happened already and this is the path she chooses</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Yukino ends up half moeblob and half ice queen in the end. 8man won't be able to keep his genuine article away from her.</br>  <br><br>  I think if she goes off to college, it be under her own volation because thats what her heart desires. Her self reflection would have happened already and this is the path she chooses <br><br>I agree completely.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about what happens to the cunt</br>  How the fuck did Yukino not even notice Yui's feelings for 8man in the first place? It was pretty obvious.  <br>The love triangle can only really progress after Yukino solves her family problems, after that Yui will probably make a move, get rejected, then Yukino will take the 8bowl.</br>  Now that's alpha.  <br><br>Well he's not really central to anything except as a comparison to Hachiman and whatever involvement he had in Yukino's past.<br><br>But the exchange between him and Hachiman throughout the series needs to be addressed with some finality before the LN concludes. I think it'll be Hayama being inspired by Hachiman to confront his own demons and insincerity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious to 8man because he's extremely perceptive, not to mention Yui usually tries to show her feelings when she's alone with 8man.</br>  <br> Worst girl winning by doing literally nothing  <br><br>Sounds par for the course for Japan.</br></br></br>   tfw trying organize my yahari image folder <br>fucking christ I have too much of everything<br><br>how organized are your  Iroha  folders anons?</br></br></br>  So where in the novels does ep 13 leave off? Just from reading threads it seems like there's still a lot of Hachiman x Iroha interactions that haven't been animated yet and I'm curious about where those are.  <br>why is she the worst girl iyo?</br>  <br>  I have a problem. <br>  Go somewhere far away. <br>  Some stuff happens. <br>  Come back and I'll all better. <br>Nah. Her problems are still there, she'll be back ready to struggle to fix them guns blazing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop trying to turn this into another shitty waifu wars thread</br></br>  <br>Probably because she's the sole character that Watari uses to force drama and move the plot<br><br>But its because she will undergo the greatest growth by the series ends that she is likely to win (coupled with all the other tropes Yuki has that aids her victory chances)</br></br></br>  <br>She's no longer a character, but a plot device.<br><br>Also, you type like a 12 year old niece..</br></br></br>  <br> a lot <br>there were only 2 things:<br> Iroha actually licked the spoon before she put it in 8man's mouth making it an indirect kissu <br> Iroha gave 8man cookies in private and told him not to tell anyone <br>Other than that she didn't get any more screentime</br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't get the ending, was the love triangle aborted?  <br> Also, you type like a 12 year old niece.. </br>  <br><br>No. Hachiman kept Yukino's ship from sinking.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is the best girl.</br>  <br>Thats not how a abroad ending works for Yuki<br><br>Her issue is she cannot make choices based on her own desire so is dependent on others to make choices for her<br><br>She wont be leaving, problems still abound, and coming back magically healed. <br><br>She leaves because that is her choice and desire. Her leaving on her own terms (to study abroad) is the culmination of her healing process Thats the big fucking difference</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you saying character growth only happens if you get the guy?</br>  <br>He didn't let Yui opt out of the love triangle</br>  <br>Yui pretty much baited him into doing it.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>I mean generally throughout the series. Like entire chapters of development that haven't been animated because the show didn't get there yet. I could be wrong, it just seems that way.</br>  <br>http://<span>youtu.be/gI8-3x2e7S4  [ ]<br><br>GUNS BLAZING<br><br>WA2 was too good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha* is the best girl.</br>  <br>Yui gave a semi-nuclear option to the group by offering to become 8man's girlfriend, allowing Yukino to focus on her own issues while keeping the club together. It's unclear if Yukino realizes that Yui's love for 8man is genuine, but what is clear is that 8man doesn't want a non-genuine solution to their current stalemate, so he squashes it and says that they have to work it out some other way.</br>  <br><br>Well vol 10.5 has not been animated. And that has the mock date with Iroha.</br></br>  <br><br>Well regardless, it was Hachiman who prevented it. It will never be seen what Yui would have done if he'd not intervened.<br><br>Thinking about it, what would Yui have possibly done to "fix" Yukino's problem? She can't really do anything about it single-handedly except to remove Yukino's reliance on Hachiman. She was bluffing big time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So the love triangle is still on? I hope it isn't an unpleasant one, I like them as friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>No im saying its common trope that those who fall the hardest often get rewarded the most in the end. Im not saying I like it but thats how it is sometimes<br><br>Its why dere girls often beat out genki girls in japanese media. They undergo the most changes/growth with the MC or something so their relationship is "special"<br><br>Blame Japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how you spell  Rumi </br>  Random question, why did Hayama choose the Science courses for his future instead of the Liberal Arts or whatever 8man suggested  <br><br>Yes it's not yet resolved.<br><br>I don't think it'll be an unpleasant one. But it would be funny to see Yukino and Yui go all out for 8man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Friendship between the three of them seems untenable. Something has got to give. Yui will be the catalyst (like she almost was in this last episode) to push a ship out to sea, whether it's hers or Yukinon's.</br>  <br>In the LN both Yui and Yukino smile to each other after 8man goes "genuine" again, they know what will happen bu it doesn't look like Yukino resents her for giving her that option.</br>  <br>8man suggested the Sciences. Hayama is going Liberal Arts because everyone else is doing that.</br>  <br>I literally have no idea what was going on this entire two series.<br>Why is everyone so serious about nothing.<br>What the fuck is going on.<br><br>So far it seems like everyone is losing their shit over "keeping things like this"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was it ever really determined? Hachiman kind of parsed and twisted Hayama's words and decided it was "not the sciences, probably." But I don't remember Hayama ever confirming that.</br></br>  <br> Why is everyone so serious about nothing. <br>You haven't watched many dramas have you?</br></br>  <br> Her issue is she cannot make choices based on her own desire so is dependent on others to make choices for her <br>No shit. Why do you think sticking around being in the middle of all these forces will fix a walking wind vane like her? She needs to be away from it all to figure out what she wants and how to proceed in that direction on her own. Being alone to reflect is the best way for her to get over herself.</br></br>  I feel like the end of it wasnt all doom and gloom at the end. Yeah Yuki got shat on most of the episode but I felt after Genuine Speech V2, that was one of the final growths the club will undergo (final growth being resolving love triangle)<br><br>Yuki's request whatever it is will be the catalyst for resolving everything</br></br>  <br>Because it's literally "nothing happens: the anime"<br><br>At least that's the case for S2<br><br><br>Even for a drama there isn't much of anything going on. How fucking long do we have to hear about Yukino's fucking problems before something gets done about it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hayama did choose the sciences then 8man sort of screwed Miura over with her request.</br>  <br>Yahallo~!</br>  <br><br>She was alone for a long time before Hachiman and Yui came into the picture and made no progress towards helping herself.<br><br>Being alone is not the answer. She needs to learn how to depend on others in a healthy way. So she needs her friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's all internal. Just like real life.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not sure, when I read it it thought it was it was Hayama's slip mid discussion and 8man pointing it out, but the episode made it seem like 8man used reverse psychology telling Hayama where to go.</br></br>  <br>No, I generally find them to be too much adieu about nothing, but this is completely different.<br><br>Like, everyones always side looking at one another, with random shots of a fake smile, then everyones like "they don't know the real me I'm a bad person".<br><br>And I'm just sitting here like, what the fuck is wrong.<br>Why are you all upset.<br>Why is there some kind of pseudo tension and hostility with no evident cause.<br>Why does every slight remark of strangers saying hello make everyone lose their hope in life.<br>TELL ME YOUR SECRETS YOU FUCKS!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was alone and no one needed her quite like those two. You need to watch honey and clover dog. Being away from those important to you is a good way to figure out how much they really mean to you and what you really want to do for them.</br>  <br>Friendship can happen as long as there is no hard feelings, I don't think either of them would be destroyed by losing 8man.<br><br><br>So they telepathically declared war?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  She was alone and no one needed her quite like those two. <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not as nice as she makes her out to be.</br>  <br>You sound really autistic.<br>Have you ever had friends?</br></br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  <br>She's perfect</br>  <br>There's a difference between her being alone then, and her distancing herself for a bit, now.</br>  <br> I use another fictional story to prove my point </br>  <br>None that act like these faggots.<br><br>Though I'll grant you that I'm socially inept, so that's probably my problem.<br>I just can't wrap my head around what the fuck is going on.<br><br><br> hey you know that series you aren't enjoying <br> you should read the book of it <br>nah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whats wrong with that?</br>  <br>It's pretty grounded in reality. Am i supposed to use my own experiences now to prove my point? You want to turn this into a blogfest?</br>  <br> nah <br>stay confused then</br></br>  Haruno is legit insane and starts shit because she's an agent of chaos.  Will Hachiman accept Yukino's cookies when she give them to her? Will he understand what she means as she is giving it to him<br><br>Fuck, if he rejects the cookies after she musters up the courage to finally to do it on her own accord.</br></br>  <br>Haruno was right.</br>  <br> Am i supposed to use my own experiences now to prove my point? <br>not him but I wouldn't oppose it if you did it tactfully.</br></br>  <br>Have you ever felt like everyone was just getting along with you for the sake of it and don't genuinely enjoy your company? For people who have found a real friendship, especially bullied loners, shit's a pretty big deal</br>  <br>Of course he'll accept them. He practically begged her to confess at the end of the last episode with genuine pt.2 8man boogaloo.</br>  <br> Haruno insane <br> Hitler insane <br> Haruno starts shit <br> Hitler starts shit <br> Haruno was right <br> Hitler was right <br>Coincidence?  I think not </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's basically my opinion on everypone I speak to at university.<br>Is this their problem?<br>It seems to me that they've made it pretty clear that they're friends by now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>In the first place, why are they giving cookies instead of chocolates?</br></br>  <br>Haruno is the /pol/ aryan who hates 8man because he doesn't hide his powerlevel.<br>It all makes sense.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think so. She was alone before and knew her problem and it didn't get resolved. She can be alone and know about her problem now and it still won't get resolved.<br><br>She won't fix her total lack of self worth by isolating herself from the people she cares for and cares about her. She needs to be able to depend on her friends for emotional support. Every human being needs that whether they have 'issues' or not.<br><br>If she totally cuts herself off from Hachiman and Yui, she will either get worse and worse or she will end up back as ice queen she was at the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Yui gave cookies because Hachiman is cookieman (her first request was to make cookies for someone. Guess who)<br><br>We think its cookies that Yuki has. But she did say she was planning on giving chocos (see ep 12) We dont know the contents of the bag</br></br></br>  <br> Hitler did nothing wrong  <br> Haruno did nothing wrong <br><br> both names start with H </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's that feeling multiplied because they're in a love triangle but still want to stay friends.</br>  <br> Have you ever felt like everyone was just getting along with you for the sake of it and don't genuinely enjoy your company? <br>all the time</br></br>  <br>They've been sidestepping all over each other's issues for quite a while now. Real friends don't hold back. They're all clumsy awkward messes.</br>  <br>Well don't really know if Yukino had cookies in that bag since Haruno asks who she was making chocolate for.<br>She only made cookies for herself and Yui.</br></br>  <br> real friends don't hold back <br>You sure about that?</br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out of the thread, Haruno. They're trying to figure it out, didn't you hear what Yui said?</br>  When is vol 12?  <br>Never.</br>  <br><br>  Too long  </br></br>  <br>Fuck off Haruno<br><br><br>Next year, after 11.5</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're all hiding skeletons and can't be open about anything, are you really friends?</br>  <br>Okay, so let me see if I've got this right.<br>They're friends, and they enjoy being friends, but they're in a love triangle.<br>They all know they're in the triangle but don't know how the other parties feel on the matter so they try to maintain a false status quo to avoid breaking the triangle.<br>This is why everyone is obsessed with "keeping it how it is" and they become awkward whenever anything external prompts a resolution?<br><br>Is this correct?<br><br><br>So they're not friends at all?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Man, that ending did not justify the 24 hour generals. Not by a long shot.  <br>Real(best) friends know WHEN to hold back and WHEN to rip you a new one.</br>  <br>I hide a skeleton from my friends.<br>They don't need to know, it can only cause harm.<br>One does not have a duty to reveal everything just because you're friends.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck<br>Well I guess ill have to forget about this show for a year again<br>Gl in life anons</br></br></br>  <br> So they're not friends at all? <br>They're all bothered about the situation at least so they're on the right track</br></br>  <br><br>Well to be truthful, most people keep at least a little bit to themselves. Something about the last 10%. You can give people 90% but you have to hold just a piece for yourself.</br></br>  <br>It's not like Hachiman has to know what underwear Y&amp;Y wore today.<br><br>Full disclosure of information is fucking stupid.</br></br></br>  <br> vol 12 <br> next year <br>bruh please be joking</br></br></br>  <br>Normie friend groups are fucking cold war tier holy shit.<br>Someone makes cookies and it's suddenly fucking deafcon 1.</br></br>  <br>I'm hoping it'll come this year, but it's very slim chance considering how profitable half volume filler can be.</br>  <br>relationships aren't easy...</br>  <br>More importantly people don't act freely unless they have privacy.<br><br>If there's another person always watching them then they act differently from how they truly.<br><br>See Hayama for example.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless a vagina makes the complexity exponentially rise then I would have to disagree.<br>Unless you mean romantic relationships, I wouldn't know about that.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I know how it works but i'm speaking from the service club's context where they struggle to communicate just a bit of what they really want. Usually they're full of sophistry, defense mechanisms, what have you</br></br></br></br>  <br>why wouldn't you?</br>  <br>I would like to know that. So would 8man. I think they would benefit from a little more openness. <br><br>He should tell the girls about all the time times Iroha flirted with him, that time Ebina pretended to come on to him, the fact that he looks at Yumiko's legs, the times Saki was dere with him, how he thinks he would have fallen for sensei if she was 10 years younger, everything concerning Orimoto, and how sensei texts him desperate novels.</br></br></br>  <br> Unless a vagina makes the complexity exponentially rise <br>I'll probably get shit for saying this but it kind of does.</br></br>    <br>Because I'm a potent combination of ugly and an asshole. <br><br>Unfortunately me and my friends have humour based on insulting one another, which doesn't translate too well to normies.<br><br><br>Guess that explains it then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly<br><br>All the teen cast in yahari has problem distinguishing ideals and reality, or making compromise for that matter.<br><br>Hachiman might want to sound edgy and sophisticated, but in the end he has morality of a fucking panda. It's all black and white. <br><br>It's incredibly naive way of thinking.<br><br><br>And he wouldn't be labelled creep how?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to ki ss  this fucking cu te. </br></br>  <br> he has morality of a fucking panda. <br>You don't say.</br></br>  How to get over my autism by searching for something intangible - The anime  i dont know whats wrong with me but i counldnt follow this show at all. i loved the first season but the 2nd was confusing.  <br>They already think he is a creep so it won't be a big deal. I am sure they would just laugh at it and him and move on. <br><br>Nothing about that is creepy except looking ar Yumiko's legs.</br></br></br>  <br>EXACTLY<br><br>You know what to do when mods asleep</br></br></br>  <br> Can I join in? </br>  <br>They'd probably shut him saying he doesn't need to be that open.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>   we will never get a doujin of 8man dressing up as pan-san and hiding in Yukinon's bedroom closet then busting out of it in the middle of the night <br><br>why go on</br></br>  <br>Of course</br>  Why doesnt Yui get a Pan-San equivalent that she likes? Even Muira gets that Marie the Cat<br><br>Or does just because Yuki is main girl that she has to display affection for Winnie the Pooh</br></br>  <br> dressing up <br>Why would he do that? He's already in perfect cosplay.</br></br>  <br>Is it me or does Pan-san resemble someone?<br><br><br>I wonder if it would make them insecure if he had that much interaction with other girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She had Sable<br><br><br>see</br></br></br></br>  Who else here got dubs or greater during the great dubs storm the other day?  My life is shit<br>I dont know why I watched this show<br>I almost felt a bit of jealousy for 8man<br>Might as well end it all</br></br></br>  <br>Well Yuki has a cat fetish as well</br>   sonnet writing intensifies   Have the delusional Irohafags apologized to "denialfag" yet?  <br>How can one Ishikki be so based?</br>  <br> I almost felt a bit of jealousy for 8man <br>If you don't feel a little bit of jealousy for a SoL anime MC then you have autism, so at least you have that going for you anon. You aren't autistic.</br></br>  What the fuck is 8man wearing?  Although right now, Yukino looks like she is on the up-swing, but that is just because her issue has yet be resolved.<br><br>Yui is the real winner. Why? Because she got shot down by 8man and gave no fucks. Cute-genki-girl-next-door always wins. I'm sorry, that's just fact.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, even most dramas has more 'content' than Yahari. Watari seems to make big deals out of next to nothing and when he does make actual issues, he piles them all onto one character.</br>  <br> The Icy Queen was too strong. She had no need for show. She was the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, seriously. “So naturally, you ended up feeling bad and came out here.” <br><br><br>Rereading that passage, can someone explain what she meant here? The summer camp arc was my least favorite<br><br> Whoosh, the wind blew, rustling the treetops. In that silent night, the sound of the leaves amplified; it was like hearing a pin drop. <br><br> Even with all this noise, Yukinoshita’s voice reached me. <br><br> “Even so… I’m glad I came here today. I thought it was impossible.” <br><br> “Huh? Why?” <br><br>Why did she think it was impossible for her&gt;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like kilt?<br><br><br>Honestly, I can see non-NTR version of WA ending. 8man end with Yui but then break up with relatively good note, then Yukino return from overseas... an open end with hints.<br><br>(I'm a Yuifag and want her to be true end though)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is everyone so serious about nothing <br>This is typical for a bunch of high school children. What did you expect?</br></br>  <br>Its called fashion you dumb fuck</br>  <br>Probably because Haruno hadnt been there</br>  <br>He forgot he had to be there that day so he threw on whatever he could find in  Watari's closet .<br><br>He would have been late if hadn't, so just appreciate the fact that he's there.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that's a valid excuse</br>    <br>I was involved in two love triangles and I can tell you real life is never this serious or cryptic.<br><br>It's just fantasy, nothing more.</br></br></br>  <br> I almost felt a bit of jealousy for 8man <br>there was no almost for me, did feel envy <br>I dont know why i even get up every morning, habit I suppose</br></br></br>  <br>I've known a bunch of people who takes these things seriously. I agree, never this cryptic, bet yes, this seriously.<br><br>It's normal.</br></br></br>  <br> Might as well end it all <br>Anyone who feels the need to tell other people they're going to kill themselves doesn't actually want to kill themselves.<br><br>You're just looking for someone to help you. You should already know what your problems are. You need to solve them on your own or else you'll end up like Yukino with dependency issues.<br><br>Of course there might be a chemical imbalance in your brain so try smoking Marijuana, it might help fix or at least cope with the issue.<br><br>Other than that it's all up to you. If you die then you were simply too weak to exist in this world. Humans are on the top of the food chain because they can adapt to anything that threatens them. If you cannot cope with your own personally manifested internal problems and end up dead as a result then you were simply not worthy of passing on your genetic code as it would weaken humanity. Even my words as you read them weaken you, for it is knowledge you did not achieve on your own. Stand, move forward, adapt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would be then?</br>  <br> so try smoking Marijuana <br>stopped reading there</br></br>  <br><br>Is this 8man and Watari?</br></br>    <br>Her mom probably didn't want to let her go to the camp, as soon as it ended Yukimom sent Haruno to pick her up, Komachi wanted her to go shopping with her and 8man.</br>  <br>having no testicles while being in a coma.</br>  <br>Yes. And damn, that is a lot of meat.</br>  <br>Sorry anon, I can't meet your high standards.</br>  <br>Try reading between the lines less, 8man.</br>  <br>Watari looks like a cool guy.</br>    <br>Ya, the one with the glasses is 8mans VA. Hilariously, he is also Takeo's VA (from Oremonogatari)</br>  <br>Why? It's a crutch and has usefulness in select situations. How is it different from any other medicine? This one just so happens to be readily available in first world countries.</br>  <br><br>fuck both, two faced wenches</br></br>  8man despair getting cucked by Hayama end is the only true end.  <br>Gay as fuck</br>  So Yukino loves 8man. Since Yui already loves him isn't that going to cause problems between them in the future? Like what would happen if one gets him and not the other, that isn't going to feel good.  <br>That's why no one is doing anything.</br>  <br>Do not bully.</br>  <br>You are truly the deepest most profound poster i have come across<br><br>Bravo</br></br></br>    <br>Never this seriously to me, at least not to the level where everyone starts getting cryptic as fuck for no reason.<br><br>But hey, you're arguing anecdotal evidence so there's really nothing further to be said.</br></br></br>  <br> How is it different from any other medicine <br>you don't use a drill to hammer a nail.</br></br>  Will 8man confess first or will one of the girls?  <br>does he even like either of them that way?</br>  <br>I see a mutual one with Yukino, time skip, 8man drinking the promised tea with Haruno.</br>  <br>Well maybe it isn't a perfect solution but unless you have health insurance finding more suitable aid would be ludicrously expensive.</br>  <br>Oh, so the last episode the three are agreeing to do something about the fact that both of them are in love with the same person?<br><br><br>Be nice silly</br></br></br></br>  Yui is a master strategist. Why does she pretend to be dumb?  <br>Yui isn't dumb she just doesn't know some big words or  that penguins are birds. </br>  <br>8man is basically forcing them to do something by refusing their attempts to continue the status quo.</br>  <br>Girls unless he somehow realizes who he has romantic feelings for (assuming he has any) before the girls confess<br><br>Both girls will do a proper confession by the time the series is over. <br><br>If Hachiman were to do a confession, it'd probably be to Yukinoshita only because he had monologues in the past of him asking a girl something (in this case to be his friend). Flimsy argument but its something Watari made Hachiman do twice <br><br>The interesting bit is the timing of when he asks Yukinoshita. The first time was when he literally met her for the first time (first image of her he makes). 2nd time is when he gets over the Yukinoshita never lies subplot (title of that chapter is he and she find an answer)<br><br>I have no doubt Watari will put him in yet another situation where he asks Yukinoshita to be his (girl)friend once the final growth of Yukino occurs and he will pose the question to that version of her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  <br>Is it ok being late like this?</br> </br></br>  Why is he called 8man?  <br>If Yui wins 8man confesses, if Yukino wins Yukino confesses. <br><br>Yukino needs to confess, she needs to know what she wants and do something about it for herself.</br></br></br>  I want to fuck Yuimom.  <br>Master strategists often conceal their intellect. Why would the devious or cunning ever let others know they have it in them?</br>  I required a defibrillator.  <br>Why would he force them to have a love triangle? He doesn't even acknowledge they both love him.</br>  New scans are out.<br><br> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=51150080</wbr> </br></br>  <br>He's a siscon.</br>  <br>Gahamama*</br>  <br>If cats go nyaa do sharks go shaaa~?</br>  <br>Yes you are right. But the problem is not only the love triangle but the fact that for the first time they feel like they found real friends, people that if they lost life wouldn't be the same, the love triangle just aggravates the situation. <br><br>There is also the theme of life moving on, if you lost most of your friends when you moved to university for instance you will the understand it better, this is reflected in Hayama´s group and their attempt to stay together which is regarded as fake friendship by the main cast.</br></br></br>  <br> yukino has to solve her own problems </br>  <br>I seriously hope Hachiman isn't Watari's self insert because Watari is ugly as sin. Christ he can't even get a proper haircut</br>  <br>I think I mostly understand now, thanks anon.<br>Much appreciated.</br></br>  <br><br>Who wouldn't a Gahamama? She is so comfy and soft.<br><br>If Yui will look like that in 20 years 8man is a shithead for not going with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hammerhead sharkuuu <br><br>Fuck he was hilarious in that scene and Yukinoshita was amazed at his reactions</br></br></br>  <br><br>My heart</br></br>    <br>You have some pretty unrealistic expectations of people if you consider that to be ugly.</br>  <br>Yui will look even better.</br>  Does the fact that Yukino got the final end card and will probably get the last LN cover mean anything long term?<br><br>Will Hachiman ever be on another LN cover as well?</br></br>  <br>He probably is WW's self insert like somebody pointed out last thread.<br> <br>8man kept looking at Iroha's lips in multiple occasions during volume 11, and apparently on a similar way to how Watari tweeted about his kouhai and her lips sometime ago</br> </br></br>  <br>nigga watari is swaggy as fuck<br><br>the fuck are you on about</br></br></br>  <br>Truck-kun will appear.</br>  <br> Will Hachiman ever be on another LN cover as well? <br>He'll probably be on the cover with Yukino, if anything.</br></br>  I like new Yui. Finally, a pro-active female romantic interest who goes for what she wants but doesn't resort to underhanded tactics to do so.  <br>So Yui being in love with 8man is one of Yukino's problems?</br>  <br><br>What if all 3 of them get killed by a truck?</br></br>  <br>What happened to their faces here. Jeez. <br><br>This is true more for Yukino. She can look really cute at times but then FEEL makes her uglier at others</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't resort to underhanded tactics to do so <br>Are you even aware of what she just did ?</br></br>  <br>God, for all this show's navel-gazing it really is just a competition to see who wins the MCbowl.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's probably the main reason she won't give 8man the chocolates or confess etc.</br>  <br>He's pretty much a black haired Zaimokuza without glasses</br>  <br>The final solution to the Yahari question.<br><br> Haruno is driving it. </br></br></br>  <br>No, explain.</br>  <br>Bah, I can tell already he's going to go for the mopey dark haired girl instead of the based looking girl on the left.<br><br>Fucking Japs.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just written (arguably poorly) in a very cryptic and vague way but at heart it's still a love drama, which I suppose is Watari's special style. But I guess that's LNs for you.</br>  Dick status: muh.  Ruri is life.  <br>second for yuya</br>    Muh status: Dick.  xth for Hippo  <br>I still say Yuya's ultimate dragon will involve combining Odd-Eyes with the hippo.</br>   Yuya's seeing hallucinations of Yuzu now <br>This nigga needs help.</br>  <br> Seeing Yuzu in the cards. <br> Forgets to Pendulum. </br></br>  <br> WE DIDN'T GET TO SEE FISHERMAN ODD-EYES BECAUSE YUYA HAD A BONER FOR YUZU </br>  <br>He can already do that with Beast Eyes if he wanted</br>  <br>How much are they gonna censore this episode?</br>  With the power of [insert card here] Sawatari will surely stay relevant.  <br>slifer the sky dragon</br>  <br>Block Spider.</br>  M A N L Y    I'm not the only one who thought of Digimon when he saw Raikiri, right? R-right?  <br><br>Hippo is doing Constanza face</br></br>  This episode was really great  <br><br>Crow has always been the Crowmon of Yu-gi-oh for me.</br></br>   pervert stuff and violence all in the same episode <br>this isn't a children's show anymore is it</br>  Every YGO gets one  <br>I envy Yuzu almost as hard as I pair her with Yuya</br>  <br>Yep. Truly great. That sad looking Tomato makes me feel happy.</br>   RAPTORMAN BEGINS   <br>Crass Clown and Dream Clown</br>  <br> forgetting about Rei and Serena </br>  <br>Oh yeah, wouldn't want to let the innocent children of Nippon see bloodless cartoon violence when things like Arslan air in an earlier timeslot.</br>  <br>I was kind of doing a main heroines thing</br>  <br>I'M THE GODDAMN SHUNMAN</br>    <br>this scene was perfect</br>  <br> he gives it away for a bit of food <br>Sasuga Neo New Sawatari</br></br>  <br>This was funnier than it should have been.</br>  <br>It wasn't so funny for the guards.</br>  <br>Why does that boy have tits?</br>  <br>Raptorman, Raptorman, doing the best that he can<br>Raptorman, Raptorman, revolutions in Heartland<br>Oh here comes the Raptorman<br>Raptorman, Raptorman, fighting guards in prison<br>Raptorman, Raptorman, saving Ruri from fusion<br>OH HERE COMES THE RAPTORMAAAAAN</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He got them from his mom.</br>  <br><br>Truly the next cardgame Jesus</br></br>  <br>Some boys have tits anon. They're called girls.</br>  <br>He's even done the NAKAMA speech.</br>  Wait so we have Batman: Reiji and Raptorman: Shun?<br><br>So does that make Sora The Candyman? <br><br>First he has the have a better record than Serena.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry. Serena's next on-screen duel will result into a loss, then it will be followed by more. That's always YGO tradition.</br>  <br>Either way she still has the most wins out of any female duelist in the series already.</br>  <br>Sawatari a best, Serena a cute, Tokumatsu a bro, this episode a good</br>  <br>Personally, I prefer the moxen since they're still worth something if they're not in your opening hand.</br>  <br> Serena will never get to lead her pet dog Sawatari around on a leash  <br> Dennis will kidnap her <br> Sawatari will get carded trying to save her <br> Yuya vs. Yugo will get Yugo poofed by Yuzu to Fusion where Yuri will eat him <br> Yuzu will then get kidnapped <br> Dennis destroys all of them and escapes with the Ruris <br> Sawatari and Ninja are carded and out now <br> Reiji shows up and is like JUST AS PLANNED WE FOUND THE TRAITOR, LETS GO GANG </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When the ruris don't get a daily dose of being crude and strong they pout.</br>  <br><br>Anzu literally never lost a duel</br></br>  <br>She's probably just upset she hasn't had her sweets or Sawatari to yell at.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see Gon and Shun's beautiful combo next week.</br>  <br>Neither has Serena, also Anzu only dueled 3 times. She may be undefeated but almost every other YGO female has more wins than that because they actually got to duel more than 3 times.</br>  <br>Where is Aki in her benchwarmer outfit?</br>  <br>Gon comes out with strangely situational cards and uses up his hand to make it easier for Shun to bring out Rise Falcon. Rise Falcon uses an overlay unit and brave claw revolutions. Enemy's LP hits 0.</br>    <br>Will Ebina's love for Ruris at least make it a well animated duel, with new Moonlights?</br>  <br> new Moonlights </br>  <br>I hope to God, I'm tired of seeing Moonlight Cat Dancer and Moonlight Blue Cat and then her opponent losers. The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out.</br>  <br> Shun mercilessly beating Synchro Nico Smiley </br>    <br>She needs a new level 4 Moonlight monster so she can  OVERLAY  them.</br>  <br>She would never do something so disgusting.</br>   her face when she has to ride bikes now whether she wants to or not <br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES, YUZU<br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she and everyone else in the Lancers should Pendulum Summon since they're part of the Sawatari Generation</br>  <br> What Shun sees when he looks at Yuzu </br>  <br>Fucking bird hair</br>  <br>She would if Kurosaki-sensei taught her how.</br>   Yuzu will finally stop wearing her Nazi outfit.   <br>She should keep wearing that shorts+sleeveless shirt combo.<br><br>And her riding suit should have no sleeves too. If Yuya can keep a cape in his, she can do that.</br></br></br>  <br> implying she isn't a better fit for Sawatari  <br>see </br></br>  New protagonist coming to Arc-V 2  <br>I want Serena and Sawatari to ride off on Daibak into the sunset</br>  <br>Ruri~</br>  <br>Yuuya becoming evil confirmed.</br>  <br>Same here.</br>  <br>YUGI CONFIRMED!</br>  <br>Wait he is blonde?</br>  <br>Well yeah, I'd assume he's meant to be dirty blonde with blonde strands.</br>  Is it so much too ask for a full Underworld Troupe Duel? They seem to have the potential to be quite fun.  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>BAD END CONFIRMED</br>  <br><br><br>Ruri~</br></br></br>  <br>Chances are we'll get it when Sawatari tries to save everybody, comes close to winning, and ends up carded. Like Jonouchi's Shadow Realm duel with Marik. <br><br>I'm gonna guess he stays in EGAO mode once Yuzu gets mad at him for eating Yugo.</br></br></br>  <br>W H E N</br>  <br>You've got it backwards. You won't be seeing any more Moonlights, unless the cards are coming out.</br>    <br>Yuzu is going to be leg locking and telling Yuya to come inside so much when they reunite that their kid will probably be able to take over by Arc V 2</br>  <br> The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out <br>Cookmates say otherwise</br></br>  <br> Cookmates have enough cards to fill out a deck. <br> Print Aqua Actress' instead. <br><br>Ironically this is what gives me hope that anything can be printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc V writers are a bunch of waifufags, which means Serenas cards will probably be printed</br>  <br>Your Tomato knows how to ride a motorcycle, why can't you?</br>  <br>Free token cards from the official Konami girls-only Yugioh meetup they have every month or so</br>  <br>Not how that works, they rarely push cards that come out before they do in the anime. It's why I'm baffled seeing people assume Ryo or Jonouchi are coming back solely because they're pushing Cyber Dragons and Red Eyes cards.<br><br>A few archetypes say otherwise, like the Dinosaurs from GX. Either way he is right, the more cards you see in the anime the better chance they have of coming out at least a little bit. <br><br>I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly, especially when we have so many other more deserving cards that need to be printed, and not just in Arc-V, we still have tons of cards from the other series that need to be printed, let alone about half of the archetypes in Arc-V. Konami really needs to try and start producing more cards instead of focusing on the Entermates, there are a ridiculous number of them already, or trying to push older cards that half of them don't even fit into any decks people even use anymore, even with some of the new supports.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br> I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly <br>Because they had to print SOMETHING for Arc-V.</br></br>  Yuya may be the cutest and most perfect looking and sounding and acting and everyt- <br>Just answer the question<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770619</br></br>  <br> there are a ridiculous number of them already <br>Is the number of Entermates Blackwing level yet?</br></br>  <br> No Yusei <br> Dub Judai name </br></br>  <br>Could have printed a lot of different shit instead.<br><br>It's getting there. I feel with how much Shun gets pushed in the anime, BUY RAID RAPTORS is gonna be the new one along with BUY ENTERMATES and BUY ODD-EYES.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya and Yuzu fuck the multiverse up bad  <br> both go their own separate ways <br> miraculously save child individuals that reminds them of their former selves and raise them. <br> 10 year timeskip Yuya becomes an Archer-tier EdgeLord and Yuzu becomes morally grey. <br> Try to travel back in time to change what they did wrong but multi-verse theory happens meaning no matter how hard they try it won't affect their recent world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot that blonde girl with glasses on the first Yugioh, you know the one who actually kissed Yugi.</br>  <br>If you count anime only, there totals around 40 Entermate monsters.</br>  <br>Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? Most of his cards stick to an archetype (hence, Entermates and Magicians) since in the past the MC's deck would be more mish mash.</br>  <br>Yuzu confirmed MC for Part 2.<br><br> Gongenzaka  confirmed MC for Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br> no yusei <br>i know he would get all the votes, but come on.</br></br>  <br> Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? <br>I cant imagine he comes anywhere close to all the garbage Hero cards Judai had printed</br></br>  <br> 40 Entermate monsters already and we're not even halfway through the show <br><br>For what purpose</br></br></br>  <br> Meanwhile Reiji is time traveling with Yliaster and Paradox trying to save the worlds from utter destruction <br> yfw the Domino City Paradox comes from is Synchro Dimension after Fusion is done with it <br><br>Elemental Heroes got a lot, but for the most part, yeah Yuya is getting tons of cards printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's his time to shine</br>  <br><br>Judai probably will forever hold that record.<br>Yusei and Yugi probably have similar amount of cards printed, but it's harder to keep track of the number of their released cards because they don't stick to a specific archetype that much</br></br></br>  <br>Arc-V 2? Incoming Yuzu taking the spotlight. Which makes me ponder just what exactly they are gonna do to Yuya to take him out of action for a good chunk of the season. I mean, it's not like Judai got a replacement during his time as the supreme king</br>  <br><br>No</br></br>  <br> there are people here RIGHT NOW dumb enough to take that post seriously <br>You guys are not often the brightest, even for 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>More like 30</br></br>  <br>Yusei had nearly all of his cards printed didn't he?<br>All the Synchrons, Warriors, Effect Veiler, Ghost Gardna, the Stardusts, Armory Arm, Quillbolt, Level Eater<br>Fuck, what didn't get printed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yugi at first didn't have many at all, by now he probably does yeah. But solely because they re-release cards, they've added tons of supports for older cards the past year or two with DM cards, they've been trying to give them Synchro/Xyz shit and everything. <br><br>From a straight show base I believe it goes.<br><br> Judai <br> Crow <br> Yuya <br> Yugi <br> Yusei/Yuma <br><br>I'm not even sure if we can count Yugi as the OCG/TCG was just coming out so of course they'd get cards printed. <br><br>Chances are it'll have something to do with Yugo getting nom'd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Eita won't be the new protag </br>  <br>I know right<br> There are people who dont know Arc V 2 will follow Neo New Sawataris revolution </br></br>  <br><br>Yusei was pretty prone to using the same cards over and over again though</br></br>  <br> Implying Nega Neo New Sawatari won't be the final villain </br>  I'll be the new protag, I've already stolen Yuzu, and I'm going to steal the spotlight when I beat Jack instead of Yuya. <br><br>What would you guys think if Yugo was the one that ate Yuya instead? Just hypothetical because it's obviously not happening.</br></br>  <br> Speed Warrior wa shokan! <br><br><br>Later on they start missing a few cards, I was watching the ZONE duel the other day and they never printed some of the cards he used there, like Clear Effector. All his Syncro monsters did get printed though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I would like Yugo as the main, even if I like him as he is right now. Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing.</br>  <br>Hey man, I like BAD ENDS. I really, really like BAD ENDS</br>  <br> Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing. <br>This. exactly hotheaded idiots are good if they're just a secondary character they're tolerable that way. Them being in the lead makes it cringe worthy</br></br>  <br>Why? Every character I like just dies or get replaced. Now with the MC too? Fuck this gay earth.</br>  <br>HYPE'S DEAD<br><br>NO BAD END<br><br>POST IS FROM 2014<br><br>BUT TRUE DETECTIVE JUST PULLED A FAST ONE<br>https://twitter.com/justfal516/stat<wbr>us/523801862579843074</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It probably would work great for an extreme shocker nobody ever thought was gonna happen, then be interesting for a bunch of episodes but ultimately be extremely shit and will probably make me drop the series. <br><br>Especially because Yugo is the kind of guy who is extremely awesome in doses but if the focus is too much on him his personality and wouls get old pretty fast. Arc-V would basically turn into the equivalent of the a spinoff of a popular character of a series and those are alway shit.</br></br></br></br>  crotchal region status: hurt.  <br>That sounds fucking terrible.</br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>The poster is from 2014. Yuya's staying as MC.<br><br>If they were to have him go full EDGE the best move would to have Yuzu be the MC due to the show's mythology arc, but, as I said, the poster is from 2014. Probably just some gayass promo card where you insert yourself in the card.</br></br></br>   yfw Yusho is the EGAO in Yuya because Yuya ate him too   <br>KNOWLEDGE IS NUMBER 1!</br>  <br> insert yourself <br><br>RED HAT ANIME CONFIRMED</br></br></br>  <br>It's this <br>The blank token card is for a photo of your choice</br></br>  <br>THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ONLY 1!</br>  <br>Is a picture of giveaway tokens and some moonspeak really all that's needed to fool /a/rc-v?<br><br>You guys are so dumb sometimes, holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>Aww. I wanted Yuya to go insane, and then Yuzu to be MC, and for her to go insane too, forcing Gongenzaka to be the MC to stop them. Why won't Konami indulge my edginess?</br>  <br> Yusho kept hypnotizing Yuya trying to draw out his untapped power until he went too far and Yuya accidentally absorbed him <br> the evil force inside Yuya's head was actually Sky Magician all along </br></br>  <br><br>Oh look the anti fun police has arrived</br></br>  <br>Is it really so bad to want SUFFERING?</br>  <br>We're just trying to have FUN</br>  <br>sora is cute too.</br>  Post Manzai Serena  <br>if yuya dies i stop watching</br>  <br>Who?</br>    So this is the perfect opportunity for Dennis to kidnap Serena and take her back to Academia. If he doesn't take it now he's either a bigger fuckup than Sora or a quadruple agent.  <br>Manzai Serena  :&gt; </br>  <br> a quadruple agent <br>I've been saying that from the start.</br></br>  <br>How many days has it been since the Battle Royale ended? How many injections has Sora had since then?</br>  <br>He doesn't have either of their duel disks with them to teleport, so I don't think he can.</br>  <br> Sora comes back SWOLE as fuck because of all the injections </br>  <br>I'm looking through past sets and Yusei and Yuma seemed to get around 4-7 cards per set, which is the same for Yuya.</br>  <br>Don't tell me what to do.</br>  <br>fixed<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770863</br></br>  What was Serena pouting about?  Yugo is fucking retarded. He knows he's a wanted criminal amd still wants to enter the friendship cup. Like JM said that's just him serving himself on the silver plate while also serving as a warning for all commons  <br>No sweets or people to punch. <br><br>I don't think Yugo cares as long as he can beat people in duels.</br></br></br>  <br>Bored as fuck. The same as her entire life in Academia.</br>  <br>Say goodbye to Yuyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</br>  <br>She missed the manzai with Sawatari-san this week</br>  How relevant is Yuzu to the plot?  <br> my body is ready to take down xyz scum </br>  <br>Yuzu IS the plot.<br><br>Look at all that plot.</br></br></br>  <br>she's a great  self insert </br>  <br>She was a window through which we saw most of the plot at the start of the show, now she's Yuyas main motivation. Reasonably so</br>  <br>Eye Duel 3 when?</br>  The animation quality in this episode seemed better than usual. They got Ebina, didn't they?    <br>no it was ufotable</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Do you think that they are going to combine Speed World - Neo and Cross Over?<br><br>Maybe by materializing ramps they could use those ramps to jump on the platforms that float in the air, and they could get action card by grabbing them while the are drving. past them.</br></br>  <br>Yuya would have no chance of performing motorcycle stunts, even on AUTOPILOT. Now Jack, on the other hand...<br> STANDBY </br></br>  <br>Jack with kids is always adorable for some reason. I really wanted him and Carly to have kids for that reason alone.</br>  <br> that shun <br>Every goddamn time</br></br>  i'm on episode 13 right now<br> yuya's face when reiji pendulum's 3 monsters into play <br>mega kek</br></br>  <br>Even Ebina knows that Yuzu is still the best. Hope he animates her first duel in the tournament.</br>  <br> b-but only I can pendulum <br> im da mc!! <br>It was great.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there any kind of picture that can't get better by adding Shun in it?</br>  HEY GUYS I FOUND YUZU!  Sora would have won this duel, his hand was closer.  Is that time anon.<br> Your cardfu/huscardo <br> Say something nice of her/him <br> Be fully autistic or chuuni to write something related to her/him   Hard Mode: Writefag on </br></br></br>  <br> implying it wasn't an Action Trap </br>  <br>Go to bed Yuya holy shit.</br>  <br>Is this what Ruri finale~ looks like?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4za<wbr>HLhj8jjA#t=2m22s</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Action Trap: Mirror Force </br>  <br>Hopefully Kamishiro writes her duel.

Kaiba or Jack?  <br>Reiji.</br>    <br>Kaiba is easily smarter than Jack.</br>  <br> Jack <br>Fuck no<br> Kaiba  <br>FUCK NO<br><br>Honestly, it's Reiji, since he understands Card Advantage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Kaiba cheated half the time, especially early on. <br><br>Honestly for as dumb as Judai is and forgetting the rules half the time, he's one of the few that actually tries to set up strategy and shit. <br><br>If we're talking straight up just how good they are at dueling, then it'd be Yusei, Shun, Serena, Jack, or Judai, likely Yusei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon please leave. Nobody will post monster if they are not Ruri herself.</br>  <br>Reiji, he's pretty much Pegasus, Kaiba, Atem, Jack, and Yusei all put into one. Dude understands shit way too easily. <br><br>If there was a meta in the anime, he'd be Super Nekroz.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br> Sawatari <br> Shun <br> That fucking hippo <br>Ebina confirmed for Arc-V poster</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Reiji isn't as popular as Kaito, Kaiba, Jack, et al. Crazy Imouto Man and Crab Girl stealing his thunder.</br>  <br>Shun go away.</br>  <br>Shun sees visions of Yuto.<br><br>It's Yuya who hallucinates Yuzu.</br></br></br>  I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode.<br><br>Kinda bored with everyone just knowing how to Motorcycle.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if Reiji did more than sit in his NEET cave and spy on people and figure out prep time like Batman. <br><br>The animators seem to love him though considering how broken he is and how many themes he has though.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh. After seeing this I guess Yuzu's hair isn't as unnatural as it seems to be.</br>  <br>They have an auto-pilot mode for that very reason. Kaiba wasn't about to have card games on motorcycles without a backup plan, he doesn't want to get sued.</br>  <br>I love how animators on this show are<br> the script writers <br> monster and card designers <br> AND music composers <br>Amazing that they have all these anime Da Vincis on board.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> principal pissing yuya off directly after a tiring battle <br>not fair</br></br>  <br> butthurt failed AOTS non-virgin detected </br>  <br>Hey, Shuzo died to teach Yuya an important lesson. Have some respect.</br>  <br>It's a joke on how it's only in the Arc-V threads that people seem to think animators have anything to do with all major parts of a series' production other than drawing frames for the show.</br>  Yuya a thirsty mofo. Beginning to show signs of scurvy. Someone throw him a bottle of orange juice.  <br>Sora had the inside track, but Yuya has longer and presumably stronger arms. He could've grabbed it too and probably would've won a tug-of-war.</br>  <br> the principal is pendulum summoning <br>holy shit yuya's going to be so butthurt<br>if i wasn't in love with him i'd be laughing my ass off</br></br></br>  <br>Shuzo cemented himself as best dad simply by being there as a father figure and reaching out. Yusho will probably end up being nothing but trouble when he finally shows up.</br>  <br><br>Oh you know what he meant. <br><br>If that happened Yuya would probably just let him have it so the duel would continue, chances are all it would have done was destroy Odd-Eyes Rebellion, Yuya still wouldn't have lost.</br></br></br></br>  Yugo confusing Yuzu for Rin after her shower gets me every time. What an adorable dumbass.  <br>The harisen seems like a powerful tool for keeping Yuyas in line.  Why didn't she just use it on Yuri when he was chasing her? </br>  <br> I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode. <br>That would actually feel pretty pointless after showing that first timers have no trouble picking it up because of auto pilot.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how close and intimate Yugo is with Rin.</br>  <br>Yusei and Jack were incredibly intelligent duelists who had seriously fucking next-level ability to read their opponents and predict their moves. Jack's flaw was that he let his emotions get the better of him, which is why Yusei beat him the second time. <br><br>Shun's good at this too, but he's a cocky little shit, which is why Sora outlasted and eventually trashed him the second time. It seems like he's really good at preparing for bad scenarios, but not necessarily adapting to them as they come. <br><br>Yugi was an incredibly smart duelist too, but his strength was less in strategy and more in being able to come up with ridiculous combos in the moment and being able to play all sorts of bullshit mindgames with his opponent (see: the time he eyefucked Mai into not attacking him). <br><br>I'd say Yusei, then Reiji, then Yugi, Kaiba and Jack probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, unless she reacts the same way whenever he does stuff like that (which he obviously is used to doing, otherwise he wouldn't have reacted that way) I'd say they can almost be considered couple-close  though, for the sake of argument and purity, stick with as close as siblings. </br>  <br> Yuzu hits Yuri with a harisen <br> Yuri rubs his head  <br> "W-what is this feeling...I-I remember this...? Huh?" <br> "What did you do to me, Hiiragi Yuz-ouch" </br></br></br></br>  Will Jack summon all 3 Red Demons in one turn??  <br>Shun's deal is his deck is made specifically to counter the special summons of Fusion Duelists, which in turn just sort of fucks everything up as far as the current game goes since everything important is a special summon. <br><br>And Reiji doesn't even need to read his opponents he's just overwhelming and has the same Atem mindfuck speeches going on with him too. He did make a point to Yuya that emotions will cause you to lose. <br><br>Reiji and Yusei are pretty much on the same level, maybe Reiji is even beyond just because of his ability to fuck with people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Odd-Eyes Rebelliion went down, Yuya was pretty screwed since he didn't summon any wall monsters with his last Pendulum Summon (seriously, he could've at last summoned Stargazer in DEF so he could revive OERD if it WAS destroyed)<br><br>Sabre Tiger would've attacked him directly and that would've been it. Although Sora probably would've just gone "lol, 1-1 now faggot" and left anyway when the cavalry arrived instead of carding him.</br></br></br>  <br> Crow and Jack appear in Arc-V <br> Arc-V has the best side cast <br> New Protagonist    Even Though It's 99% BULLSHIT  <br><br>Being Yuya is Suffering, they don't even give him a chance to show off like other MC's did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine Yuya had a card in his hand to set or would have looked for an Action Card in that scenario. Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br><br>But yeah you are right, Sora wouldn't have cared, just bit his lollipop and walked off while Yuya screamed about having fun. Shame we wont get to see him ever smile or duel Yuya again since Shun is probably going to fucking kill him the next time they meet.</br></br></br>  <br>If there was no action cards Yuya could've won because Sora used them to reduce the amount of life points he'll lose whereas Yuya used them just to gain his attacks</br>  <br>Pretty much. Shun's deck is made with the expectation that you'll keep throwing big SSes at him and he'll just turn it against you over and over. <br><br>Problem with that is that, apparently Sora just rope-a-doped him and outlasted his OTK. When a card came up that could just wipe Shun's field instantly, he had NO answer for it. <br><br>Although he seems to have wised up a bit, since he used Raptor's Ultimate Mace to counter the potential of his monster getting rekt against Dennis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even worse when you realize that Yuya's overall dueling record is barely above Yuma's who has the worst record as far as the MC goes. Though if we aren't counting the duels before the show began where he was under 60% then he's a pretty good duelist.</br>  <br> Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br>It's hilarious that this is true for the most part, but in the specific case of Sora, he'd be such a fucking joke without Action Cards. Shun would've embarrassed him even harder than he did and Yuya would've destroyed him.</br></br>  <br>Damn Yuya is likeable So I feel sympathy for him losing a lot of screenime as a MC, However if Yuma was in his position I'd choose the side cast characters anyday</br>  <br>Yep, he's good at adapting. I'd imagine someone like Kaiba though whose deck mostly relies on tribute summoning barring the couple of fusions he has would be able to overwhelm Shun, since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing. Makes me excited to see what cards he has in the new movie. Imagine Kaiba with Azure Eyes and Pendulum Summoning and shit.</br>  <br>True SYNCHRO doesn't use auto-pilot, though.</br>  <br><br>Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion as far as the Slifer, Ra, and Obelisks go. But so far all we've really seen him do is beat scrubs and Shun once. Especially considering Serena and Yuri both (though I don't know if Yuri counts) have so far been the better duelists by far, hell Dennis too. Not sure if he counts either. I'd imagine Yuri and Dennis were Obelisks as well though.</br></br>  <br>Off-screen duels don't count, Sora.<br><br>And Yuya is good because of the sidecast.</br></br></br>  <br>Use it as an excuse to teach Yuzu Synchro or something, I dunno. <br><br>Yugo and Yuzu need more screentime. Definitely the best part of this arc, along with ENJOY man.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion <br>Neh. Yuri's obviously stronger than him for one, as Yuri shitcanned Yuzu and Yuzu's one of the stronger duelists in the series. Serena's probably stronger than him too. <br><br>He might be one of the strongest STUDENTS at Academia, but there's probably all sorts of absurdly powerful adults there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And Yuya is good because of the sidecast <br><br>Not really even if the sidecast weren't good, he's like Judai 2.0, although the relationship between him and Yuzu makes him more likeable</br></br></br>  <br>He might just be the strongest Obelisk then at least from what we've seen. But yeah it's clear that Yuri, Serena, and Dennis are better duelists than him, at least so far.</br>  <br> Dennis <br>Pshhh, what are you talking about, he's just some LDS scrub.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah right. I'm really hoping he is some sort of Triple Agent or some shit, the Ocelot of the series.<br><br>I'm curious though, I'd assume that his Xyz summons don't give off the readings like Yuto/Shun's did, which is why he's able to infiltrate Standard so well and doesn't bother using Fusion, but I wonder why the other dimensions only have aptitude for certain ones. Like is Shun and Dennis' pendulum summoning also babby tier energy wise compared to Yuya, Reiji, Sawatari, etc.?</br></br></br>  Dennis the __________  <br>Bennis</br>  <br/>  <br>Are Serena's Serenas big enough for Bennis' Bennis?</br>  <br> since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing <br><br>No kidding, you ever play against him in Tag force special? You'll always hear "Ore no prido, Sosti ore no tamashi, Ideyo, Blue Eyzu Whito Drogon!!" by the second turn. The only way to truly get rid of those fuckers is to banish them. Kaiba has no answer for that in his deck</br></br></br>  <br> KOURIN SEYO, WAGA TAMASHII </br>   That Laugh   <br>And now we'll likely get Blue Eyes Pendulum Dragons that go to the Extra Deck and can just be summoned every turn and Overlayed and Tuned and all sorts of shit. At least I'm hoping. <br><br>Also unfortunately no I haven't go to play TFS, I don't understand enough to get what's going on and I can't read Japanese worth a shit, mostly because I'm lazy and wont bother practicing and the translation for it are good, but the story translations are just Abridged Tier, some of it is straight ripped off. <br><br>We get a trailer for that movie come the 9-12 at San Diego Comic Con don't we?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably got Yuki Usagi didn't he alongside the Yang Zing. At least his deck got a boost.</br>  <br> Yuya loses to Jack <br> Disappears for half the arc <br> Yugo takes over as MC for awhile  <br> Yuya comes back this time he ditches the entermates and uses DRAGONS and Magicians </br></br></br></br>  1st Panel<br> Serena: Hey Sawatari! <br> It seems like I am a 'les' and I seem to be doing 'yuri' with Yuzu... <br> What does that mean? <br><br> Sawatari: Eh? Well―, <br> It means that it's girls that are really getting along and are really best friends. <br><br> Serena: Hmmm... <br> Below first panel: Wonder what's that box in front of her? <br><br>2nd Panel<br> Serena: I want to play with Yuzu... <br> Ah! Yuzu! <br><br> Yuzu: Serena? What's up? <br><br> Serena: You see! The truth is I am a 'les'! <br><br> Yuzu: HUH? <br><br> Serena: I wanna hurry up and do 'yuri yuri' with Yuzu! <br> Do you have time!? <br><br> bgsfx: intense breathing <br><br>3rd Panel<br> Yuzu: Serena, <br> Let go of me. <br><br> Serena: What!? Why!? <br><br> Yuzu: You're pretty close, <br> a bit. <br><br>4th Panel<br> Serena: Yuya! What should I do!? <br> I said something to Yuzu that Sawatari told me and she hated it! <br><br> Yuya: Well, you see! <br> Just by all means, stop believing whatever Sawatari says, got it!? <br><br>5th Panel<br> Masumi: What!? <br> Yuzu isn't a Lesbian!? <br><br> Yaiba: You're too noisy, Masumi! <br> You're saying such a thing with a loud voice! <br><br> Box: The person who received the most damage. <br><br>Man, this 5D's artist's favorite in Arc-V really is Serena. His latest comics are all about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't need pendulums, they need an xyz.</br>  <br>Best part is that if they want, Serena can be a main stay in the cast due to her being voiced by Yuzu's actor as well. Now wouldn't that be strange if they got into a tag duel together?</br>  <br>He does now.</br>  <br>Whose isn't besides Ebina? <br><br>Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. I'd imagine Yugi gets Xyz and Kaiba gets Synchro and they both get Pendulum.</br></br></br>  <br> Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. <br>No it isn't.</br></br>  <br>Legendary Magician of Dark can't be used in duels.</br>  <br> Hippo Taking Yuyas Place <br><br>Ebina is not fond of Yuya is he?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the Xyz Dark Magician. That's a Match Winner.<br><br>And it's technically not banned, it's illegal. There's a difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Ebon Illusion Magician.</br>  <br>A good number of his Arc-V sketches on twipple are of Yuya</br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about that card, my bad then.</br></br>  Can we discuss why this guy is the best secondary character ever introduced in the entire YGO franchise?  <br>He's really not. I don't think a lot of the staff likes Yuya very much at all considering there was an interview about why Yuya is no where near as balsy or hardcore as previous protagonist. The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional.</br>  <br>Ebina is a fan of Serena too. He changed his profile pic, when the high res of her default manzai face was released on the anime's official twitter.<br><br>He changed it back to Hippo again though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a total bro to Yuya, he's like Synchro Gongenzaka</br>  <br>He also changed it to Kurosaki once his icon was released on the anime twitter. No surprise that the best regular animation director on the team also has impeccable taste.</br>  <br>I read that producer interview and all they said is that they wanted to try something different with Yuya. Is saying that<br> our new MC is not a total badass gary stu <br>now equivalent to hating your own creation?</br></br></br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>I want him to finally snap and make him be a baddass character for an entire arc</br></br></br>  <br>Ebina just loves all Ruris.</br>  <br>Why do you wanna bully the tomato?</br>  <br>Really? A shame since he's pretty much a good character that actually develops and is down-to-earth compared to previous protagonists.<br><br>He's my favorite compared to previous protagonists.</br></br></br>  <br> boyshorts confirmed </br>  <br>This makes me feel sorry for him his Soo much potiential but fortunately arc-v was blessed with a good side cast</br>  <br>So he likes Yuya?</br>  <br>It's quite obvious that his favorites are Shun and Ruris.</br>  <br>Yuya could've been serious but his family and friends stop him it's like there sealing away his real personality (not including edgemode)</br>  <br>Judai was pretty down to earth and not badass until Season 3 at least. In fact didn't Judai forget the fucking rules to duel monsters sometimes?</br>  <br>Enough to spend money he makes working for Yugioh to on Yugioh merch</br>  <br>Isn't that just most of Japan?</br>  <br> No where near as ballsy <br><br>Dude he was about fucking leave his friends in order to save Yuzu even Crow had to call him out, Fucking Crow. If that's not called determination I don't know what is</br></br></br>  <br>Sad too considering Reiji called him out on that shit too.</br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>Ha top kek, still the straightest protag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, yeah, he did say Yuya was being awfully focused on Yuzu despite claming he was avenging the fallen. God, Yuya would be been an annoying edgelord if he had come to Synchro without Yoko doing some parenting. especially after what those little bastard kids said.</br>  <br>Ruris &gt; friends</br>  <br>Yep, just rewatched the episode actually, he says something along the lines of "You only care about Hiragi Yuzu, but what of the other people who were turned into cards."</br>  <br>Nothing wrong to save your most loved one by sacrificing other lives</br>  <br>If Yoko hadn't dueled Yuya, he would have become an edgelord.<br><br>During Security's duel, he would have been put in isolation.<br><br>ENJOY Duel wouldn't have happened, and everyone would be out of half their decks.<br><br>Serena would have been "interrogated" by Jean-Michel.<br><br>So the Yoko duel WAS actually relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Weekend waifu/husbando drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to take it easy. <br><br>Thread #6:</br></br></br></br>  Requesting *Hyun-ae in a one piece zipper swimusuit.

I just hope no one mistakes me for you again.</br></br>  <br>He's not Oorafag though</br>  Requesting Junko Enoshima at a masquerade party in a costume of your choice.  Would any drawfriend be kind enough to draw Inaba in a cute sundress? Straw hat optional and entirely at your discretion, of course  <br>Thanks ssf, a good way to end the weekend! It's not an 'at least you got something' delivery, it's cute and I appreciate that you went out of your way to draw her, and with a smile at that.

If you put lots of time into something, figure new things out (bestwith reference) and really trying to improve then you really will learn something. Otherwise you just get faster at drawing things you already can do.<br><br>You're waifu is a cute though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Who cares about mistakes, just don't post it until you get somewhat confident about your drawings if you are so afraid, get a friend or two to show your shit if you REALLY feel necessary to show them to somebody and keep powering yourself up, stop being such pansy ass.</br>    Requesting my lovely wife, Yuzuko, getting a brain freeze from eating shaved ice.

Loli Maka is always appreciated and yours is cute!

Thank you.</br>  <br>That's really cute</br>   everyone calling shitty drawings cute <br>why have the drawthreads turned into da?<br>I mean I understand the basic thank you and all, but I've seen too many bad drawings get complimented far more than they should.<br> serious question, I don't get it. </br></br></br>  <br>Sunday night desperation shouldn't come now as a surprise.</br>  <br>Have no fear anon my shitty drawing didnt even get noticed!</br>  <br>Even if they aren't the best drawings doesn't mean they can't be cute and charming.</br>  Requesting Yomi sumbathing with a slight tan and either with visible tanlines or showing them off  Requesting Crona doing something comfy in the blue sweater outfit (bottom right).

I bet you are a Diego Umeharez fanboy.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, you got one before, shithead. In the last thread.</br>  I would appreciate anything of Kurumi. For example, wearing an evening dress sitting on a bed's edge, or at a bar or sorts. If you want a specific outfit, a classy dress fashioned after her Astral Dress.  <br>wahaha.<br> try again next week. </br></br>  <br>quickie, not too sure about the pose</br>  <br><br>Cute.</br></br>  <br>You seem upset. Did you receive a shitty drawing?</br>  <br>Shut up, BB. It has NOT been 4 years. You are not going to tell me that 4 years have gone by. You fucking stop that.</br>  <br>Dat butt.</br>  What happened to palette anons  <br>Positive reinforcement works a lot better than negative. They can always improve.  And a lot of what people think is shit really isn't that bad, I've seen far worse. </br>  <br> that spoiler <br>Do you honestly believe that you're so bad? That delivery i really cute and funny.<br>Believe in yourself!</br></br></br>  Well, I had a good run. 3 weeks in a row's not too bad. I salute those of you who persist until the very end, and will see you in the next week  <br>Cute idea. Reminded me of  Washizucopter .</br>   past 11 <br>I- I still have time to draw something, right?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>being worse != not being bad. and positive reinforcement != baseless praise. I get what you're saying, but encouraging and praising are 2 different things, and as a drawfag I personally would prefer a critique over calling something cute.<br>likewise I've also seen plenty of people -see deviantart- who think they're at a perfectly acceptable level because other people praise it. this shouldn't be allowed especially on 4chan of all places.<br><br>what you should do is something similar to just telling them to keep drawing and point at things they're doing right while giving them advice on what they're doing wrong, but telling clearly bad artists they're doing great will probably do more harm than good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should finish that. OR will love it.</br>  <br>You probably have another 12 hours or so at the least. WWD doesn't end until the last thread does.</br>  Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  Hope is dead and nobody likes her  <br>Cute style. Have you drawn here before?</br>  <br><br><br>I like to have dynasties in sports, so Diego or one of the previous winners. Momochi would also be acceptable.</br></br></br>  希望はありますか？  絶望!    <br>Oh man, didn't think I would get a delivery this late.<br>Thanks for creating hope from where there was none, and have a pleasant week!</br></br>  <br>I can wait until next week.</br>  <br>Next week will be the week of weeks.</br>  <br>request her as a loli next week and I'll do it.</br>  <br>I've been meaning to do that so I just might.</br>  Any streams?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Galilfag here, I actually want this girl<br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Girtablilu<br><br> If that is ok with you, if not any other desert monsters would be fine. </br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> Boo~ </br></br>  <br>ダメ？</br>  Don't worry, anon! You're waifu will be drawn by Sharkbro next weekend!  <br>have a good weekend kafukabro, and everyone else. Be sure to take it easy this week~</br>  <br> as a drawfag myself <br>Lol ok</br></br>  <br>I hope he delivers Sunday. I don't want a weekend ruined by shitposting.</br>  Requesting waifu's with their hair cut for summer.  <br>*week</br>  <br>Seconding this, but specifically with Reisen.</br>    <br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?ut<wbr>f8=%E2%9C%93&amp;tags=reisen_udongein_i<wbr>naba+alternate_hair_length+</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Diego better win.</br>  <br>Have a nice week Kafukanon!  and everyone~ </br>  <br><br>thx bros<br><br>I wasted a lot of time today trying to fix another piece so maybe, but that will have to wait until next week<br><br>yeah, since February I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God bless you sir, I didn't even think of that.   I still kinda wanna see short-haired Reisen in a drawfriend's artstyle, though, maybe I'm a tad selfish  </br>    Just wondering, do you guys care if the drawfag relies heavily on reference for a piece? As in, almost tracing the base sketch, although from different images.      <br>snazzy</br>    <br>such an earnest expression! i love it<br><br><br>most people are just happy to get anything of quality whether its traced or not<br>course then theres people essentially asking for the use of the template<br> <br><br>he looks amazing drawfreind!<br> glad i didnt take it <br><br><br><br>are we just in for a volley of deliveries then?<br>that crona is cuuuuute</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Volley of deliveries <br>I hope so</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are you posting all of these now all of the sudden?</br></br></br></br>  <br>hes saving this thread</br>  <br>It's the light at the end of the tunnel.</br>  <br><br>Hey, this is the OR again.<br>No idea if you would see this being as it's two threads later, but I managed to make your drawing resemble Yuuko a lot more.<br>I moved the nose up and to the left and the mouth some, and it made a world of difference.<br>I'd like to thank you again for the wonderful artwork and wanted to let you know that you drew a fantastic booty on Yuuko. Keep on drawing nice waifu butts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because 34 is the hero we need.</br>  <br>What a lovely smile.

Nice timing, I was about to head off to bed  good morning to you though, I guess . Oh 34, what did I even do to deserve so many deliveries from you? I think you already know well how much I love the way my husbando looks in your style, but I’ll say it again. I love it. I’ve been waiting for right time to make this request to fit the season and really hoped to get something, so you’ve just made my day once again. That little blush does things to my heart, it’s perfect. Also the way you draw Crona is very cute. Thank you so much once again, I hope you have a great week!</br>  <br>yesterday you said tomorrow</br>  <br>cute~</br>  <br> why are you saving the thread and giving hope to people <br><br>You for real?</br></br></br>  <br><br> doitmind </br></br>  There is no hope  <br>ojii save me</br>    <br>i already drew oora like 4 times today</br>  <br>draw justdoit-kun</br>  <br>He's dead jim, let it go.</br>  <br>But there were 2 of them!</br>  <br>They made a lover's suicide pact.

I do really appreciate effort though: your lines betray an unsteady hand or a lack of muscle memory but that will come with time. Thanks for taking the time to draw her anon-kun and good luck on your drawfag journey!</br>  I don't hate it as much as usual.  <br>I'm mildly irritated and sleepy</br>  <br>You are indeed my hero, thank you so much!

Im gonna start doing line exercised before I attempt anything from now on. I chose yukkuri's as a way to practice hair without producing something too abysmal, im definitely gonna make you something better once i git gud</br></br></br>  <br>I guess someone else can color this.</br>  <br>It's still Sunday here.</br>  <br>Cleanest lines I've ever seen. Really well done.</br>  <br>Same, but I don't hate it that much.</br>  Requesting Tsubaki dressed as Tsubaki, please.

Have a great week and I'll see you all again next weekend!    <br>goodnight kobenibro</br>  Guess I'll have to deliver next week          HERE IT COMES  <br>We've got over 150 posts left and you're saying this?</br>      <br>On second, thought, time to give up</br>  <br>BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE</br>  Promises were meant to be broken, huh?  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  lol!  <br><br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ONNNNNNNN</br></br></br></br>   it will never happen to you're waifu <br><br>Kill me now.</br></br>  <br>choco please go home</br>  <br>Why don't you follow your own construction lines? Why don't you limit yourself to a few layers?</br>  <br/>  <br>rofl!</br>  <br>Of course not, girls are just meant to be booth babes. They don't know how to play video games.</br>  <br><br>[Message was removed.]</br></br>  <br>Great work as always orz!</br>  <br>Damn those lines are amazing</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Such nice lines.<br><br> Please, draw more cute but lewd waifu-tan like the good o'l days. ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Oysm kobenifag. <br><br><br>In my very limited experience I've found that hair super hard to draw freehand. If you're gonna use photoshop with your new tablet learn to use the pen tool - it's really handy for making perfect hairlines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you draw my waifu some day.</br>  ITT: Girls that didn't deserve to lose  <br>I rber when that was confirmed.<br>/a/ didnt even rage, they just stared in disbelief</br></br>  <br>Fuck, everytime i think of this shit i always get pissed off.</br>  <br>And then she was replaced with a clone that has the same name but bigger tits.</br>  <br>This is one of those manga's that make me wish both girls could win.</br>  I will never not be mad   I'm gay, stop pressing your boobs against me!     <br>Okay, how does the densest material construct alive justify this as her not seriously flirting with him?</br>  <br>Ughhhhh, seriously though, how the fuck do people manage to get confused between the concept of "I'm gay", and "I would like to hear your opinion on this"? Cause that's just flat out insane.</br>  Girls are icky. This is an objective truth  <br>Actually I know EXACTLY how that can happen -- you're SO incredibly lazy and disconnected from reality that literally the ONLY thing you think about is marriage and sex. Am I right?</br>  <br>Did you faggot really endure 2 seasons of this?</br>  <br>Well I dunno, I thought the production values were quite good at least, and it's gotten better recently, it's just that it was CLEARLY the work of an insane person</br>  <br>Cut him some slack. Bitch wants to eat him and it's not necessarily in the way his spirit power overloaded self would like.</br>  <br>huh? what do you mean by eat?</br>  <br>she wants to enslave him, it's genuinely not cool at all</br>  <br>I mean, it's basically one of those "eye for an eye" things that Christianity and basically every other REAL, serious religion is specifically designed to prevent</br>  <br>Or in other other words, she's EVIL, and not in a cute or funny way. And she's a much much better character that way, so get over it.</br>  <br>Also, not in an "edgy" way, I mean in a seriously, horrifying, unstoppably terrifying evil way.</br>  <br>Anyway, obviously, yes, I'm talking about Eve from the Bible here</br>  <br>(along with all her so-called "friends")<br>Once Adam beats her at this dumb game, we can all go home</br></br>  <br>But it's not like this is some kind of conspiracy, they specifically agreed that she would be the bad guy. That's how this game works</br>  <br>In other words, the story goes something like, they both locked themselves out and Eve has the keys to get back in, but she needs to keep them from Adam because otherwise nothing would ever get done and we would still be hunting and gathering like retards</br>  I want to ____ Karen  dick  <br>PUT SOME PANTS ON</br>  <br>clothe</br>  Who is this semen demon?

I'd probably do it without her consent, as she would be even more turned on by it. I'd grab her after school in the classroom alone, and I'll fuck her hard from behind next to the window.<br><br> Alice <br>I would fuck Alice's mouth to the point where she would feel like she's choking on my dick. After I cream her, I'll grab her legs and put it up her butt. She will eventually forget she has a pussy, and beg me to do her in the ass every time. <br><br> Ayaya <br>Aya would be the only girl that doesn't really enjoy it. I would probably have to beat her into submission, which might get her a bit hot since's she's a sub for Yoko. While's she gasping for I'd start fucking her doggy style and pushing her face to the floor.<br><br> Yoko <br>Lots of foreplay; a lot of kissing and caressing. I would lick her whole body and service her breasts for a while. I'd finish her off in missionary, with lots of hugging and neck kissing.<br><br> Karen <br>She wouldn't really understand what's going on, she will just know that I'm making her feel good. I'd start by having her on all fours and fingering her ass and pussy at the same time. After I'm done, I would fuck her reverse cowgirl.<br><br> Honoka <br>Another troublesome girl. To save time, I'd just grab her hands and tie them above her head. After that I would turn her around and fuck her like Shinobu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are the mosaics so small when they actually in high schools?  <br>Smack</br>    <br> ctrl+f adopt <br> 0 results <br><br>What a disappointment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice body, girlie.</br>  <br>Nice body, girlie</br>  <br> Trying to adopt a girl from a stable family <br>Yeah good luck with that even in 2DLand</br></br>  <br><br><br>How does this gaijin fit in so well?</br></br></br>  <br>be</br>  <br>pat</br>  Isn't HS a bit slow on the subs today?

I thought he knew and wanted reasons to read it.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>But l know now, it was all part of my master plan.<br>I bet nobody remembers this was a monster tiddies discussion. Papi best grill. That is all.</br></br>  This thread is suffering from a serious lack of best girl.  <br>I've seen so much Cerea that I forget that she always has it in a ponytail<br><br>Girls with really long, straight hair are my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>She has two pony tails.</br>  <br>You have goo taste anon. <br><br>Oh shit.

Look forward to it Tuesday.  <br>Probably, who cares though, it does in the manga as well<br><br>Pic related, her tail length isn't even remotely the same</br></br></br>  <br><br>When I colored Suu, I just did traditional slime colors. No one knew her hair color at the time, so I guessed that wrong.<br><br>I colored vase blue because I thought she'd pay attention to something the same color she was. I made the cup pink because I saw one in an office depot catalog. I also chose red for the bug spray (Thanks google translate) and the alarm clock (also color referenced from the same Office Depot catalog).<br><br>Imagine my surprise when Suu was holding a BLUE vase in the preview. If she has a RED alarm clock in the show, I will lose my shit...<br><br>That or the crabman/animators like fan art?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   in a perfect world <br> there's gonna be an ending for every girl <br> even the shit ones like lala <br> and everyone will be happy </br></br></br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br>Pick one<br> perfect world <br> ending for every girl <br>Pick one<br> Everyone <br> Happy <br>Pick one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Everyone <br> &gt;Happy <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>jej</br>  <br>mem</br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br> Pick one <br><br> No </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vev</br>  <br>LOOK AT THAT SNOUT</br>  <br>geg</br>  <br>xex</br>    <br>cec</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Not sure how ANY Monmusu-race can compare with Lamias for top-tier cuddling.</br></br></br></br>  Is Polt the strongest Pokemon?  <br><br>It only struck me just now how huggable Mero looks with those big droopy ears and large, round eyes.</br></br>  <br>You ever heard of the Venus fly trap?

You have been drawn in by Mero's charms. Look at you. Already falling for her cute droopy ears and large round eyes, urging you to give her a warm embrace<br>But the: what's this? Suddenly you feel cold! A wetness in your side, followed with an excruciating pain! Oh, what is happening?

You have to mix it up</br></br>  The questions in the game the last few days have been pretty ambiguous.<br><br>I know its "Japanese herbivore simulator 2015", but goddamn.</br></br>  <br>Please get your eyes checked. You're not the same person who thought the anime threw out Zombina's heterochromia, are you?</br>  Since MMniN basically prints merchandising money, does that mean an S2 is guaranteed eventually?  <br>All depends on how the anime sells</br>  <br>Zombina looks ginger. Perfectly reasonable considering that she has no soul, being a zombie and all.</br>   No Yuru Yuri thread <br><br>Chinasue did nothing wrong</br></br>  <br>I would consider ruining yuru yuri as something wrong.

So there's that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fair enough.</br>  <br> that part from 2:30 <br>Ohgod ;_;</br></br>  <br><br>You've inspired me to try my hand at gimp too!</br></br>  <br>How is the yryr soundtrack so incredible? its as if they actually put a lot of effort.</br>  <br>Good VA's and instrumentals<br>Doesn't ayano have the same VA as hatsune miku?</br></br>  <br>Well shit. Learn something everyday.</br>  <br><br>Wow, I loaded the wrong one. Here's a slightly less shit version.</br></br>  <br>Make the glow more transparent</br>  <br>If it's too hot why does ayano wear them, assuming it's summer</br>  <br>Because it's hot.<br>She isn't wearing them here, though </br></br>  <br>Do you think the new studio will animate ayano with her thighs?  ;_; </br>  <br>The new season maybe, but Nachuyachumi takes place in the summer.</br>  <br>How's this?</br>  <br>gj anon</br>  <br>Rape machine</br>  How is the Yuru RPG coming along?  <br><br>Looks can be deceiving, Anon-chan. Don't you want your waifu to be good cook?</br></br>  I'm experiencing a troublesome problem /a/.<br><br>KyoAni's style is so damn appealing to me that it's ruined me for other anime.<br><br>I am now almost instantly put off by any other style that doesn't match this standard, this brilliant ambience.<br><br>When Hibike comes to a close I may simply return to the earth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  We still talk about K-On! after all these years.<br><br>I don't see anybody on /a/ complaining.</br></br>  <br>Kyoani find a way to be superior.</br>  Go outside, take a picture, blur the shit out of it. Live forever.  <br> I don't see anybody on /a/ complaining. <br><br>You liar!</br></br></br>  <br>You can always rewatch Hyouka.</br>  That's every kyoani anime for the past 5 years.  The magic of Kyoani.  <br>The manga was better.</br>  <br> The manga was better. </br>  As expected of KyoAni.  <br><br><br>I feel like they've out done themselves with Hibike, every scene blows my mind<br><br>it's so sexy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone actually be this autistic?</br>  Does anyone else hate the character designs?<br>I mean, they are cute, but not KYOANI cute. I feel ripped off.</br>  <br>It's a KyoAni thread, what do you think?</br>  <br>Which designs? Amaburi's or Hibike's?</br>  <br>Hibiki's</br>  <br> KYOANI cute <br>What are you even talking about?</br></br>   babbies getting impressed by filters <br><br>That shit is cheap as fuck.</br></br>  <br>This. I thought Kekkai Sensen looked good this season, then I saw Hibike. Wow.</br>  <br>It looks worse than your standard Kyoani character design.</br>  <br>But the chromatic aberration filter is impressive</br>  Still waiting on FFF  <br> Thinking Moeshit style is superior. <br><br>That's probably one of the biggest reasons why KyoAni these days put me off. Unless you're a moeshit eater you'll eat this garbage up. Like seriously was the pinkish dots on the female characters necessary, it makes them look cancerous. That one little clumsy character that had two huge red dots as well as her sister looks like fucking rabies. I really don't see how anyone finds that style appealing.<br><br>I really miss the style KyoAni had with Full Metal Panic as it was filled with blurry filter shit.<br><br> it's ruined me for other anime. <br><br>Get over it anon I can name so many other anime that better styles than the anime KyoAni makes. Watch more anime seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Edit *wasn't</br>   KyoAni draws so well and makes such great anime on a consistent basis that all butthurt "moe" haters (it is unknown exactly what they hate, but it seems to be centered around cute girls, which seems kind of gay, hating cute girls, but anyways) have to work with this season are "those must be filtered photos" and "muh yuribaiting."   <br>So your that same faggot that likes shiting on other threads with that image. It's good to know that KyoAniggers are that cancerous.</br>  I feel like I'm in heaven when I watch Hibike. I know this word has been ruined by memes, but it is literally a euphoric experience. It's just so incredibly beautiful and pleasurable and immersive to watch.  <br>its more than that, everything is so clean and the compositions are thought out</br>  <br> it's so sexy <br><br>Are KyoAniggers this fucking cancerous? This is some reddit tier shit.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAniggers <br>I like this term. <br>And yes. Yes they are.</br></br></br>  <br> filters are bad <br>Is this the new "forced animation"?</br></br>  <br> defending filters <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br>  <br>Madhouse before the creator left had god-tier atmosphere in their anime.</br>  <br><br>If this were any other studio than Kyoani I would call this an obvious trollbait thread but the OP probably just does think this way like all Kyoani fanboys.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>0/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sexy is now a Reddit tier term <br><br>I haven't been to Reddit even once in my whole life, believe it or not, I actually pulled that word from my own bank of words which I collected throughout my lifetime.<br><br>I'm sorry that I didn't use a more relatable term, I shall now amend my mistake<br><br>Autism<br>Moeshitter<br>Pleb<br><br>I hope this appeases his most autistic grace</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, tumblrfag kyoanigger</br>  <br>Cry moar.</br>  <br> moeshit <br><br>Stop reading right there.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't argue with trolls, that mean they won.</br>  <br> hating based KyoAni <br><br>I just don't understand it, do you hate production value?</br></br></br>  <br>No need to lie because the way you worded your sentence sounded superficial.</br>  Another fantastic Kyoani thread. Speaking of filters is there some way to filter these period so they don't show up? I have yet to see one that isn't just frothing at the mouth angry fanboys.  <br>The only thing going for them is the animation. The writing is fucking dogshit. Especially this latest series, it's boring.</br>  <br>the pogroms are that way.</br>  <br>Do you even know what a troll is?</br>  <br> KyoAni <br> based <br> filters = production value </br></br></br>  <br> do you hate production value? <br><br>What production values? KyoAni have below average production values. It's really sad that even their fanbase doesn't even know this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's literally impossible for me to get bored by something that looks this pretty. Your mileage may differ.</br>  Why is IRC suddenly trying so hard to troll Hibike now? There's only 1 episode left, it's too late to cause any damage.  <br>Why are you in a Kyoani thread if you don't like kyoani, shitposter-kun?</br>  <br>thats like saying you hate ambient occlusion</br>  <br>They've really outdone themselves with Hibike.<br>Returning to the Earth seems like a good idea.</br></br>  <br><br>Watch more anime like Ghibli films which are superior to anything KyoAni has ever made.</br></br>  <br><br> Confirmed: Only praise allowed for Kyoani, no dissenting opinions </br></br>  <br>Studios like DEEN have far better production abilities. Good to see someone looks past the smoke and mirrors of KyoAni.</br>  <br>Because its Kyoani and its popular. <br>At least they are easy to spot with their "lolol moeshit kyoanus liker".</br></br>  <br> Providing actual information  <br> Being called shitposter-kun  <br><br>Proves how really delusional KyoAnifags are.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ambient occlusion <br><br/></br></br>  KyoAni is my favorite studio.  This thread holy fucking shit  <br>Everyone knows Trigger is objectively the best studio.</br>  IRC is in full force tonight.  <br> below average production values <br><br>then why does it look so much better than every other series<br><br>I mean what looks better?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because KyoAnifags keep on making cancerous threads like these. Like muh there is no other studio that can ever top KyoAni or muh KyoAni have really high production values. All of which are bullshit. </br>   Hibike <br>The show is called 「響け！ユーフォニアム」which is japanese for "Sound! Euphonium". Quit giving it nicknames like that, it makes you look like an EOP.</br>   meme cop 5$ budget edition <br> Kill la overated shit <br> some harem anime no one discuss anymore <br> meme ninja 10$ budget edition <br><br>Based Trigger saving anime indeed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fite me irl</br>  <br>Okay, I will call it Hibike! Yuufoniamu from now on.</br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br>After seeing this perfection, everything else is not good enough</br>  <br>You forgot cute witches.</br>  <br>We know who it's for. Quit wasting post limit.</br>  <br>And it give you the right to shitpost?</br>  <br>Thats because its the only good thing about Trigger.</br>  <br> greentext <br><br>this is hardly a cancerous thread when Hibike is absolutely relevant right now  and always will be </br></br></br>  <br> I feel ripped off. <br><br>that's pretty ironic coming from an anime pirate</br></br></br>  <br> Production values. <br>You need to watch real anime like Fate Unlimited Blade Works or Bakemonogatari for real production values not this moeshit with forced animation.</br></br>  <br>This is hilarious, I genuinely wonder if these types are trolling at this point.</br>  <br> being this much of an autist </br>  <br>   and always will be <br>Anon, this show will be forgotten by next week and you know it.<br>Free! has always been the relevant show.</br></br></br>  <br>more studios should start using filters</br>  <br> Being blurry and filtered <br> Tracing backgrounds <br><br>They use all these cheap tricks to make it as if it looks good and just focus on characters, it really isn't authentic. Plus all this helps them keep below average production values.<br><br>And if you look carefully you can see that the character animation looks jarring as fuck with the background.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Why is her neck so thin? How can she hold her bobblehead?</br>  <br> I mean what looks better? <br><br>yahari and kekkai</br></br></br>  <br>Finally someone smart in this thread.</br>  <br> moeshit <br> forced <br>Epik buzzword ^:)</br></br></br>  <br>Just report and hide the Anti-Kyoani shitpost.</br>  <br>I wonder if Kyoani will make more fujobait if the Free movie is a huge success</br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen, despite being a thoroughly terrible anime, is selling well by fujobaiting, so why not?</br>  <br> My favorite Studio can't be criticized so muh report. </br>  <br>Kyoani will strictly be fujobait in the next 5 years.</br>  Not a troll or IRC, I just want to know what the appeal of Hibike is outside of the visuals.  <br> freefags are the most cancerous fujos <br><br>Please no more, can kyoani only produce more retarded fans?</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently if you were a nerd and played concert band its interesting.<br>I thought it was the worst moe show of the season, personally.</br></br>  <br> thoroughly terrible anime <br><br>So this is what Hibikifags actually believe, truly delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>Band drama. People that were in band but too autistic to participate in the drama want to see how the other lived the same period.</br>  <br>Kyoani is not even my favourite studio.<br>And<br> moeshit <br> kyoanus <br> lololol shitty fanbase <br> forced X <br>Yeah, thats tottaly citizism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else are we supposed to call it? The full title is too long to type every time, "Euphonium" is still too long, "Sound" is stupid, and the Japanese don't use "HibiYuu" or anything.</br>  <br>yuribait and hetbait working together in harmony.</br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> terrible <br> fujobaiting <br>Do you even know what those words mean? Having mostly male characters doesn't mean it's fujobaiting you fucker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whether you're an old-time casual fan pining for the days of Cowboy Bebop and FLCL or a hardcore otaku seeking out fluid sakuga and the biggest trending shows in Japan, there's something special waiting for you in the world of Blood Blockade Battlefront. It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've seen in a long time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015 season. <br><br>The series is more than just a pretty face. Its soundtrack is sublime, drawing inspiration from swing and jazz ditties of the 50s to blues and soul standards of the 60s and 70s, all wrapped up in a burrito of modern multicultural mayhem. (The most recent episode featured Indian and aboriginal Australian-inspired scoring, right alongside its usual rhythm and rock.) <br><br>There hasn't been an anime as wildly creative yet painstakingly cohesive as Blood Blockade Battlefront in a long time, and it's a crying shame that it's only slated for 12 episodes right now. Its world and characters are so wonderful that I want to spend much more time with them. I can't recommend it enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>UFO?</br>  <br>I wish more studios would implement these cheap tricks because honestly, I love it<br><br>The drawn back realism of the backgrounds is one thing but its the character detail that really pulls me in<br><br>Every frame has excellent illustrative work on the hair and eyes and impeccable colour refinement, you'd be hard pressed to find a shitty frame</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People who find band appealing and the blurry visuals, otherwise it's a really boring series that doesn't have anything good going for it. It's like Hyouka but ten times boring which is a feat.</br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen was a top tier fujo show. Everyone knows it. It's like saying Utapri isn't a fujo show. That's how ridiculous what you said is.</br>  A polished turd is still shit. Euphonium is crap.  I don't even know who is trolling who.  <br><br>This is truly one of the worst threads I've seen in a while, something special really. Only question is it going to run out it's post limit in a while and overflow into other threads.</br></br>  <br> ANN copypasta <br> on /a/ <br>Shameful. What's next, MAL?</br></br></br>  111 / 15 / 35 / 1<br><br>Nice stats. Probably just like 5 people trolling the fuck out of each other and 30 others that have made like a post or two to laugh at it.</br></br>  Nice shitpost IRC.  <br>Why is shameful that me and my fellow BBB fans enjoy the show and even professional paid reviewers indulge in its greatness.</br>  <br>You are definitively retarded. The male characters have no romantic chemistry, people who ship them force it because they feel like they need a homo pairing in every show.</br>  Hibike! UFO(lol) tots nails being a band nerd haters be mirin kyoani finds awaaaay    <br> be creator <br> two of your past works have attracted large fujoshi audiences <br> go, "hey, I'll make an anime with a mostly attractive male cast" <br> not fujobaiting </br></br></br></br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen  <br> fujoshow <br> comparing it to utapri <br>Are you just trolling? You do know that having more then 1 male characters doesn't make it a fujoshow.</br></br></br></br>  <br> top tier fujo show <br><br>Again stop using stupid buzzwords because you clearly don't know what it fucking means. Seriously by your logic Marvel would be considered Fujoshi because it mainly has men. Just fuck off and also Utapri should be used as an argument because that has men showing there literal bodies off while Kekkai Sensen doesn't do that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The thread was nice, until IRC hijaked it. <br>You can clearly see a total change in the thread starting here .</br></br>  <br><br> kekkaifags are this delusional </br></br>  <br>Nu-uh. Not how it works. If there's more than 1 guy, it's gay. That's the rule here.</br>  Preview when?  <br>UBW and Yahari had male characters too. Why is nobody shipping them together? Because there was no homobait in them. BBB is fujobaiting as much as Ufo is Yuribaiting. But I guess we know which bait sells better.</br>  <br><br> people can't dislike a show or a studio <br> better say it is the IRC boogieman <br><br>really faggot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to fucking watch Legend of the galactic heroes after investing time in like 4 shows this season. <br><br>Ugh, just gotta grit my teeth and push through. Hopefully the animation doesn't make me blind by the end of it.</br></br></br>  <br> The thread was nice <br><br>No the thread was shit to begin with when the OP acted like an obnoxious ignorant shit that thinks KyoAni is the only studio that has a good style.</br></br></br>  Is this really the Hibike thread?<br>Shouldn't the last episode PV be out soon?</br>  <br>you're retarded, also I already am from /g/</br>  I like A-1 at least as much as Kyoani  <br>So people can't call people out for liking cheap filters.</br>  <br> Implying Marvel wasn't preparing all the characters for the #Lovewins campaign. <br> reading comics anymore. <br>BBBfags everyone.</br></br></br>  <br> yahari and kekkai <br><br>absolutely not, I asked what looks better, not what could run for most generic style award</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't say KyoAni is the only studio that has a good style. He said that KyoAni has the best style, and he would be correct.</br>  <br>No, it's the thread for trolls trolling trolls. Make your own thread.</br>  <br>Do you want to die?<br><br>You wanna fucking die?</br></br></br>  <br>There is a difference between "I don't like it personally" and "lololol kyoanus licker so delusionnal fuck your moeshit worst fanbase evarrrrr". Thats just shitpost.</br>  <br>You can stop posting now OP.</br>  If Hibike (and every KyoAni anime but Free) is "moe pandering" then Kekkai Sensen is fujobait.  <br>I didn't say they were the only studio that had good style, they simply have the best style and all others are obsolete in comparison <br><br>calm down friend</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Blade Works <br>Kek. It would've been believable if you said Fate/Zero.</br></br>  Hey i wanna start watching jojo's bizarre adventure would it be fine if i just started from the 2012 one?  start with  killing yourself   <br>As opposed to...?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127255<wbr>360</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv226423308<wbr><br><br>This is where I am hanging out if you want to cause hijinks</br></br></wbr>  Can you even reduce your accent?
