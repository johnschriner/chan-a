[ Why is Enjoy so inspirational?  I FOUND RURI!  Because he's an old fuck still having fun unlike us.  why is yuya so bad at dueling?   KATTOBINGA ORE   For what purpose  <br> that quality </br>  <br> Secret <br>TREWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yuma had an even worse record.</br>  <br>Petdeckers have had the privilege of cheap cards for too long, enjoy your 20 dollar Toon Kingdom</br>  <br>Can't have old cards becoming relevant now can we.</br>  <br>I don't fucking care about Toons but soind that to Red-Eyes, I can accept Flare Metal being Secret but this is just bullshit, so fuck you.<br>And if you are reading this Trewart, I hope you be preparaed because we will find you and beat the dcrap out of you you gucking maggot pioece of shit.</br></br>  this tread is only for Selena/serena pics.  <br><br>No you don't understand. The Monarch guy was SHIT. This was his deck. I don't even know what the fuck he is trying to do with this deck. He can't summon a single monster in his deck on his own. <br><br>From </br></br></br></br>  <br>As I say before, I only finish in the frontal hole, but Serena is the only one who I would dare to finish in the back hole.<br> But if pic related happen I am not taking responsability </br></br>  <br>There is a reason petdecks are cheap, because they're petdecks. <br><br>Are you going to tell me that Minverva, a card that should be used in every Lightsworn petdeck being exclusive is good too? Exclusives and unnecessary rarity changes are stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Delete this<br><br>Wow, what am I even looking at? I guess that explains why he was tag dueling. I mean, I'm not the best at deck building myself, but I have no idea what I'm looking at honestly. My brain hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> And if you are reading this Trewart, I hope you be preparaed because we will find you and beat the dcrap out of you you gucking maggot pioece of shit. <br> Yugioh players <br> Actually doing anything and not accepting Konami dicking <br>They wouldnt do it if they couldnt get away with it everytime</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is what a butthurt write </br>  <br> Exclusives and unnecessary rarity changes are stupid <br>How are they stupid? The playerbase votes with their wallet and accepts it, causing Konami to make mad bucks. Why would they do anything else?</br></br>  <br>The OCG also doesn't deal with this shit and KoJ still gets mad amounts of money for cards, the TCG just does things to get even more money and not give two shits about the game unlike KoJ.</br>  <br><br>The fuck does he need all that draw power for<br>What does he want</br></br></br>  Haven't been in the threads for two weeks. Anything interesting happen besides the Crow thing?  <br>Ancient Leaf means he's only playing Tags and he's planning on Tributing his partner's monsters, or drawing into Storm Forth.</br>  <br>People need to stop thinking big multinationals are their friends, if people want a change they need to actually make a stand and adjust their buying patterns. Nothing will get better if Yugioh players keep acting like bleating sheep</br>  ENJOYEE<br>ENJOYEE<br>ENJOYEE<br>YOUR LIFETIME!</br></br></br>  <br>no i will never delete that pic her reaction is too cute...soon this will happen.</br>    <br>Red-eye suck nuts just like your mother, best set is this...soon we'll have more support.</br>  <br>KoJ rarity creeps all anime cards instead. They don't have the problem of people not buying the new pack unless it contains the next meta deck. Also, Japanese players had to deal with the DT stuff, like Trishula being ridiculously expensive.<br><br>Western players have nobody but themselves to blame for the powercreep, when sets like JOTL and CROS fail hard because they don't have broken cards.</br></br></br>  Best Yugioh protagonist. Prove me wrong<br>Protip:  You can't </br>  <br>Fuck you :v</br>  <br> Prophecy <br>I bet you prefer whore bitches cardfus from archetypes than things that really matter like Red-Eyes</br></br>  <br> No more Speed Spells in Riding Duels <br> all those faggots saying "If you want Speed Spells go watch 5Ds" <br> nobody likes Action Cards <br> Action Cards in Riding Duels <br><br>HAHA FAGGOTS ENJOY YOUR "MUH NO SPEED SPELLS" NOW<br><br> B-But there's no speed spells cuz you can't print them, r-right? <br><br>LOLNOPE<br><br>I WISH I COULD COLLECT EVERY MOMENT THESE THREADS WERE BTFO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So when are we all gonna duel to find out the Kingu among us?  <br>He only summoned his kawaii cardfu once<br>shit/10</br></br>  <br>What the fuck does that even say<br><br>I can't believe someone actually got paid to make this and now it will be mass produced</br></br></br>  <br>You don't put Action Cards in your Main deck, moron. And they are an existing mechanic.<br><br>There was 0 chance of them introducing a new mechanic just to stroke your nostalgic dick.</br></br></br>  <br> Books <br><br>I bet you actually stay silent in a library, faggot</br></br></br>  <br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br><br><br> There was 0 chance of them introducing a new mechanic just to stroke your nostalgic dick. <br>But they brought back Riding Duels to stroke nostalgia dick, it would have been a good idea to add something to them to make them not boring</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did someone said Books?</br>  <br>Well fuck, I've ordered two boxes of Clash of Rebellion and now it turns out the Red-Eyes XYZ will fight for the spot in the boxes with the fucking Egg. How it costs to order a playset of this things in Japanese? I'm more of a local/casual player anyway.</br>  <br>you mad that Red-eyes took this long to gitgud? but it doesn't change that fack that you're still a faggot.<br><br>yes i do because people are reading, something you cant do on your own.</br></br></br>  <br>And it doesn't change the fact that you are just a waifufag and metawhore faggot at the same time.<br> GET WRECKED </br></br>  <br> /jp/ </br>  <br>Riding duels are not a mechanic. They are normal duels, except they ride bikes. There's nothing to explain.</br>  <br><br>There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds. But the writers duped us and instead of using Speed Spells, they chose Action Cards.<br><br>Slimy fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br> reading <br> in a fucking public location <br><br>This makes absolutely no sense<br><br>How did you get to the library? Your car? Where do you sleep at night? Your house? <br><br>Why choose to go to neither of those places, in the comfort of your own area, instead of at a public place?<br><br>People who actually read at the library are hazards of life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise but are even cheaper because you don't need to draw them and those don't rely on Speed Counters to activate.</br>  <br> There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds <br>As opposed to regular spells and traps? At least Angel Baton led to skilly as fuck plays</br></br>  <br> reading comprehension <br><br>I was talking about the title of the card, asshole</br></br></br>  Greydles are fucking stupid<br>That is all</br>  <br>NTR-V<br>T<br>R<br>V</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w4w<wbr>q5_5dUhE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Masked Hero players are angry virgins </br></br>  <br>So is your mom.</br>  <br>What's wrong with being a waifufag anon? I literally made a deck with mine and the Red-Eyes cards in CORE set thanks that they are Lv 7, but after this I have to search another alternative, if you don't like it, don't buy it, I for sure am not gonna waste money for Konami and their rarity fetish, so I just stick with other ideas.</br>  <br>Does anyone have videos of duels where people are losing or do lose and throw a fit?<br><br>Neckbeards getting mad at a card game would be hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>When the opening of the season replaced the Action Duel thing with the Riding Duel, I had hope that we would get a break from them. I don't know about you guys but it kinda kills tension for me most of the time when a guy can always get a card that bails him out just by reaching offscreen and pulling one. At least resources have to be used with situational stuff. I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum. I just wanted a break from Action Duels.</br>  <br> I was talking about the title of the card, asshole <br> What the fuck does that even say <br><br>No, i'm pretty sure you just didnt make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> OP 4 will never be done by Nona Reeves <br><br>Kill me.</br></br></br>   tfw I read the script now and Gongenzaka has Pendulum <br>Now I can expect something for Yuzu right?</br>  <br>She still has her generic Pendulums.</br>  <br>They've both had Pendulum since the Championship.</br>  <br> Now I can expect something for Yuzu right? <br>No. Gon is working for Reiji who gave everyone Pendulums. Yuzu won't have Melodious Pendulums for now at least.</br></br>  <br>The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot.<br><br>I think you are just being retarded and reeling me in with this b8</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji probably just walked into her room and handed her new Pendulums. He does whatever the fuck he wants.</br>  <br> I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum <br>Why? They don't even treat Pendulums like they are half Spell Cards in the anime.</br></br>  Tadaima  <br>There are no Kingus among us, we'd all scrub out against each other and just draw constantly.</br>  <br> Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise <br><br>Not really. Speed Spells work just like regular spells just that they a little more restricted. <br>Speed Spell and Speed Counters were great because contrary to their name they slowed the game down and both player had to built up their counters before doing the big plays. Meanwhile Arc-V duels don't last longer than three turns for the most part</br></br></br></br>  <br>All could have been resolved if he was there instead.<br><br>I bet Chojiro could bring Sora's EGAO back.</br></br></br>  <br> I just dropped by to say hello and hope you ENJOY your stay at LDS' very own Maiami Medical Function </br>  <br> The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot. <br>Oh, so I was right the first time then<br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br>The English version of the card isnt even out retard, all we have is CAC version and the shitty scans Konami just put up</br></br></br></br>  <br>jokes on you, i dont local/tourny i just enjoy spellcaster decks. and i dont see how that "wrecked" me in anyway only thing i wrecked was your mom last night faggot.</br>  <br>Activating a Pendulum in the Pendulum Scale counts as activating a Spell Card.</br>  <br>That would be Serena's room he's going to walk into, not Yuzu's. And Serena won't be using those Pendulums for a long while, just like Shun-niichan.</br>  <br>This really looks legit</br>  <br>Pendulums become Spell Cards in the Scale Zone, it's like this in the anime too. Spell Destruction can easily ruin Pendulums.</br>  <br>there are very few videos but they are in the pits of youtube....</br>  <br><br>They could've easily made an exception rule for pendulums.</br></br>   Gogenzaka getting sent into a labor camp <br>He's probably going to befriend everybody there just like he did in prison, won't he.<br><br>It'll be hilarious if Gongenzaka is actually the one to end up uniting the Commons against the Tops.</br></br></br>  If I was Dan Green I'd learn whatever I could about competitive YGO, then enter tournaments under a pseudonym. Then once I sit down to games I'd mindbreak them by detailing every play I make in full Yami voice.  <br>Serena probably wont ever use them honestly, she's too prideful to Fusion. Besides what would her Pendulums even be, Moonlight Silver Crane and Moonlight Brown Raccoon?</br>  <br> just like Shun-niichan. <br><br>R-Ruri?</br></br></br>  Recently I was watching Monster Musume because I wanted to start watching ecchi anime, and after the third episode, I just though about how a Yu-Gi-Oh! harem ecchi anime would be and what monsters would appear, big points if Dark Magician Girl is just support Ms. Smith tier instead of one of the girls. Whaddya think?  <br>I say you should leave this place before you get your ass kicked and carded.</br>  <br>They'd be broken then. It'd be a lot harder to get rid of them and you'd almost certainly have to use certain monster effects to get rid of the Pendulums as opposed to the actual monsters on the field.</br>  <br>More like Yuya will make her pendulums though the magic pendant to give as a gift to her after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ and then finally Pendulum. And Yuya goes in reverse gaining Pendulum first then XYZ/Pendulum then Synchro/Pendulum and then finally Fusion/Pendulum.</br>  <br>Are you Shun or Sora? If you are Shun you can be part of that show with 4 Ruris. If you are Sora leave please I don't want fusion scum near me.</br>  <br>If every episode is a beach episode then sure, I'm down...maybe cute date episodes too.</br>  <br> after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ <br>Not too long ago you guys were sure as sure she'd learn XYZ during the championship arc. Maybe its time to accept Standard people learning multiple summoning methods (besides Pendulum) will mainly be reserved for Yuya and Reiji</br></br>  <br>Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it. Everyone else has their reasons for their specific summoning methods. <br><br>And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  I have a feeling that Masumi and Yaiba will be sent to Synchro as back up at some point.<br><br> And Masumi will Xyz Summon Gem-Knight Pearl </br></br>  <br>I doubt that will happen, but boy it will be popular.<br><br> cute date episodes too. <br>I ship Yosenju Kamamitachi (3) with Harpie Girl and Harpie Dancer so if something like this happen it will be perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rock up to your local <br> agree to duel some guy <br> you both sit down <br> IT'S TIME TO DUEL <br> wait what the fu- <br> I PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it <br>He seems to be more the Advanced summon guy than anything, he even did it with Yosenju<br><br> And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means. <br>We can be pretty sure Rin hasnt, and hopefully Ruri hasnt or Shun will cry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ooh, and Yaiba could pull out Invoker.</br>  <br>We have to find out if she Synchro summons when it is her turn in the tournament. If she does then it is a good likelihood of her learning all summoning methods. The irony is that the timing would fit since right now soon there will be a Synchro booster set, followed by a XYZ booster set and if the pattern follows a Fusion booster set announced soon after that.</br>  <br> other guy spends 5 minutes playing solitaire <br> declares his attack <br> mirror force <br> starts raging <br> MIND CRUSH <br> silence all around <br> Dan just gets up and struts off proud of himself </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High Speed Ruris.  <br>As a big Ecchi fan, that will be the best thing ever. Besides the classic ones, I think that they can put monsters that don't have anime or manga appearances based on<br> Level <br> Rank <br> Summon Method <br> Extra Deck <br> Ritual <br>And I think that Rituals will be either the most bullied for being non-Extra Deck or the most difficult to date because of their non-Extra Deck, but they will be the most worthwhile in both cases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, Sawatari is a lot like Yuya honestly, I could see him slowly starting to incorporate the other summoning methods.</br>  <br>Konami needs to release his archetype first though.</br>  <br>Multiple summoning methods is portrayed as a really highly skilled thing, Yuyas only able to do it because DRAGONS. I love Shingo, but I dont think he has the skill for it</br>  <br>At this point anything is possible. We really haven't seen much of the Underworld Troupe, besides that it's Pendulum. Hell, it could just be a pure Pendulum deck with a Pendulum boss.</br>  <br>not just dragons anon don't forget Yuzu</br>  <br>Before being stuck with troupe, he did study and incorporate new strategies (monarch deck, pendulum strategy with Yosenju), so him picking up stuff is not impossible.<br>With the scale 1-8 pendulums, 2500 Ace and ENTERTAINMENT DUEL focus, he is pretty much trying to be Yuya, so he could copy that too</br></br>  <br>Hiiiii</br>  <br>Sawatari has skill, he's just dumb and arrogant, like Serena. He clearly knows how decks and cards work outside of his first appearance/duel which he fucked up, everything after that he's been pretty on point and look at his deck now. <br><br> Pendulum <br> 2500 Ace <br> Entertainment Dueling <br> Bugging Yuya in the Manzai and trying to be his friend <br><br>He's trying to emulate Yuya, after seeing Gon Pendulum Synchro, I'd imagine he'd want to get even stronger himself and prove that he's not a weakling and holding people back. He's going to have that one amazing moment in Academia where he just goes off, but still fails in the end due to keikaku by Yuri or Dennis or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   &gt; Black Stone of Legend is a secret rare <br>YAMEROOOOOO</br>  <br>yuya a cute!</br>  <br><br>I want Sawatari to step his game up so badly, but even after repeatedly getting BTFO he thinks he's good, so he'll never git gud ;____;</br></br>  <br>What if he actually did lose on purpose though? We'll never know, like why do kids love cinnamon toast crunch?</br>  <br>But we still don't know what all of his new Underworld Troupe deck is like.</br>  <br> World where you can summon (by a big price) your monster and be with you <br> Level and Rank are usually rivals unless they have the same numbers, also numbers don't have any effect whatsoever <br> Normal/Non-Effect monsters and Effect monsters don't get along very well <br> There are multiple copies monsters in the worlds, but you can only summon 1 monster, and it have to be one that you opened in a booster (there are exceptions) <br> Monsters that you summon in real life depends on this: <br> Any Main Deck monster other than Pendulum and Ritual: they can get along very well with you and be bros <br> Ritual: the most hardest to summon because you have to Tribute something (though not necesarily lifes as a Hungry Burger was summoned using 6 burger found in the trash), and still will appreciate/support you/love you forever because you sacrifice something for them, depending on the genre/type/attribute they could be the best ones for anything, even better than Xyz in many cases, but you need to develop your relationship with them <br> Fusion: usually the more easier in some cases but not so worthy, because they were summoned using more than 1 monster, they almost always have some different personalities, but if you learn to deal with it, they are like the Main deck ones <br> Synchro: the most interesting ones as you can bring any Synchro monster with different monster and anything can happen, if you bring a Tempest Magician with an Effect Veiler she can get some breast complex <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br> Pendulum: literally newcomers and people need to wait for more information. <br> fuck my autism </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we do, we know they're funky and sassy</br>  <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br>I sense some butthurt</br></br>  <br>Ritual master race reporting in.</br>  <br>Are ritual Red-Eyes better than Xyz spam the whole field?</br>  <br> XYZ spam <br> in front of Lord of the Red <br>That would be fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Uhh isn't Flare Metal dragon not destroyed by card effects while it has Xyz?? Also Return of Red-Eyes still summons a Red-Eyes even when destroyed</br>  <br> not using both <br><br>I love having Lord of the Red, Flare Metal, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, and Azure Eyes Silver Dragon all on the field. I hope Red-Eyes get their own Synchro.</br></br></br>  How can I ENJOY the card game when my favorites archetypes are expensive, Konami-kun?<br><br>I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid. There is any other good cards on Clash of Rebellions which may become Secret Rare too on TCG?<br><br>Also, I miss Future Fusion/Dragon's Mirror combo to summon 2 FGDs.</br></br></br></br>  So when will Academia ruin the Friendship Cup? Before Yugo beats Yuya or when Dennis reveals he is a traitor like Jack?  <br>Archfiend Black Skull Dragon seems too slow with Red-Eyes fusion and has no protection</br>  <br> draw red-eyes fusion <br> use it to summon ABSD right away <br>It's pretty fast. And it's a pet deck, who cares if it doesn't have protection on it. It's meant for  fun .</br></br></br>  <br>I really love the design of the Xyz Red-Eyes.</br>  <br><br>But what I'm saying i that the anime doesn't treat them as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>Was that confirmed or are you just saying that?</br>  <br>When I mean slow I mean you can't summon/special summon anything else but yeah your right this deck is meant for fun</br>  <br>I'm going off the fact that no cards that have been used so far that target, negate, or destroy S/T's have been used on Pendulums<br><br>Also, even though the character point out "So Pendulum cards go to the Extra Deck" no one has made a remark like "So Pendulum card are half Monster half Spell?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari couldn't have used Cricket Close in his first duel with Yuya if the Pendulums weren't treated as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure it does</br>  <br>Ah you're right, my apologies then.</br>   TCG will never make mill viable   <br> What is BA <br>Hot garbage that somehow still manages to live<br> What is Diamond killing any and all mill decks <br>The reason why BA is hot garbage</br></br></br></br>  So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right?  <br>So, if I have an Herald of Ultimateness, will he be like, my most perfect attorney?</br>   Stratos still banned for 10+ seasons in murrica, while its not in Japan <br><br>Someone please do jihad on konami or murrica</br></br>  <br> he summons HoU <br> he always get in trouble because he is your typical bad luck brian "law version" <br> tfw he can be declared not guilty in every courtroom but he tries to be lawful till the end even if he sucks at it. <br>I actually love this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of Monarch's biggest issues is ratios between themselves and fodder. Looks like he focused solely on monarchs and tributing his partners' monsters in a tag duel like a real scumbag.</br>  <br>Someone needs to fire Tewart</br>  <br>Do you not know what mill is?</br>  <br><br>No he didn't. He did exactly what he would have done had he not realized that. It's just to make Gon   and his butthurt fans   feel better about losing. Otherwise he'd go on and cry the next episodes about how he failed to avenge Yuya</br></br>  <br> I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid <br> Trying to be hipster for a deck that was used in the original anime <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <br> So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right? <br>Gonfags are so delusional. They dont even understand the character they keep defending if they think that's something he'd ever do</br></br>  <br>KoA's evil truly knows no bounds.</br>  <br><br>It's not real Gonfags. It's just buttmad Crowhaters pretending to be Gonfags. You'll notice that every character wins will suddenly have an obnoxious "fanbase" that wanted to see their character win. Heck I bet even fucking Shinji will suddenly have a rabbid and butthurt fanbase when Crow wins against him next round</br></br>  Who will card ENJOY? I bet its that traitor Jack or Bennis  <br>Of Black Stone in Japanese? Like 200 yen. A playset of Ultra Flare Metal Dragons is about 900 yen. Although it'll be like $10 and $40 respectively for Burgerland.</br>  <br>  Crow <br>You mean Tsukikage?</br></br>  Reminder this will play at the last episode at the very last scene of Arc-V<br>https://<span>youtu.be/DRSxtqO9ajc  [ ]</br>  <br>I can see it now<br><br> HE HAS NO RELEVANCE WHY DID HE WIN <br> WHY IS HE EVEN A LANCER? <br> HE'S A FUCKING BODYGUARD NOT A FIGHTER <br> ninjas riding motorcycles <br> SHINJI WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT <br> WHO EVEN USES NINJAS ANYMORE? THAT WAS SO ZEXAL <br> I HOPE HE GETS CARDED </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean after Shinji beats Tsukikage and Crow and Shinji face off in round 2</br></br>  <br>I was talking about the stone. $10 bucks sound reasonable.</br>  <br> Implying it won't be Passionate Duelist Arc-V version because you know Yugi is going to be tied up in all this shit </br>  <br>Me, I misread and thought you were talking about if Tsukikage won</br>  <br><br> Enjoy is now a permanent member of the cast <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br>Nah I prefer worst ED to be played instead</br>  <br>Nah he was just happy he lost to someone with purpose and someone with guts to make sacrifices (aka Crow losing LP on purpose) to make better gains.</br>  <br><br>On the other hand Yuya shouldn't have been able to use misdirection wing if Pendulum cards count as Spell and trap cards. <br><br>Speaking of misdirection wing I wonder when Yuya will use it again. It's one of his most powerful cards and Reiji needed serious bullshit to get past that</br></br></br></br>  Have me, Shun  YUZUUUU I AM COMING JUST FOR YOU  <br>I'd wait to see if it's a bust Secret. Although Kinka-Byo is fucking $7 and the Critias cards did get stupidly high.<br><br>I hate importing OCG singles because it's always scalped. I'd rather just buy boxes from AmiAmi if they had any. CORE sold like lightning compared to DOCS.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, but that ending is so bad</br>  <br><br>I love how there's people who act like Gon lost on purpose when he did nothing of the sorts while the entire episode revolved around how Crow wasn't even paying attention to the duel implying he would have had a much easier time winning had he played serious from the start. (Shinji points out that Crow made a rushed start, implying his opening move wasn't his usual playstyle, Crow kept looking at the audience every 5 seconds and he even points out himself how he should have put his monsters in defense position)<br><br>Gon had absolutely no way of winning this duel at all.</br></br></br></br>  Ending of Arc-V will involve  Yuzu dumping Yuya's ass for irrelevant Masumi   I thought Gon vs Crow was gonna be a two parter.<br>Looks like we'll get Shota NTR instead</br>  <br><br>Was it confirmed that it's bracket system? Or are pairs randomly determined after evety round?</br></br>  <br>INSIDE YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>It's probably random pairs, look at the reactions of Yuya, Yuzu and Dennis, no one knows who is vsing who.</br>  <br>Shut up Masumifag, go back to Tumblr writing shipping fanfics.</br>  <br>Considering what Dennis said about all technological forms of communication being scrambled across dimensions, do you think Best Dad and company are watching the Friendship Cup from Standard with Mieru's Crystal Apple Uranai Baba-style?</br>  <br>But we get unrestricted RotA in place, which helps more decks out.</br>  What happened to mono?  <br>mono is kill</br>  <br>Too busy playing fighting games and getting aids to sub children's card games.</br>  <br><br>YGO EP066 Status: <br>Script/Timing - In Progress<br>QC - <br>Uploading -<br>(65 is on the backburner to be finished after 66)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will never be ready for this episode, holy shit.  <br>Protip: It never gets better.</br>  <br/>  <br>No, definitely. The remaining five episodes are all very good, but 59 is the high point of 5D's, for sure.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the quality of the series.  ;_; </br>  <br> Something in heaven was killed. <br><br>Jesus christ who the fuck named these decks? It's as fucked up as crazy Aki's deck names.</br></br></br>  <br>Well on the other hand consider Lucciano's decks. I tend to think he and Sora could have been great friends.</br>  So I believe long ago I told this thread that Majespecters would be the next level degenerate scum. Look how they turned out.  <br> I played my first Majespector opponent during the day the update was launch and I was sincerely surprised at how utterly ass devastated the guy I dueled was when I beat them with my Jack Atlas deck<br><br>I've never built a deck before and to see it do so well is rather uplifting</br></br></br>  <br>My  dick! </br>   Still no Abyss, Belial or King Calamity on devpro <br>I can't kingu to this</br>  So /a/, what old card would you like to see new support. I vote for my nigga here  <br>Lmao isn't devpro supposed to be faster at updating than percy?</br>  God, I just want to see Yuya and Yugo duel each other already. Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon vs Clear Wing Synchro Dragon is just too hype.  <br>I just want them to go D R A G O N S on each other</br>  <br>Seiyaryu. My cardfu back in the day.</br>  <br>I want to see new Magnet Warrior support</br>  <br>Thunder Dragon</br>  <br>You could always play...ARG format pff. <br> people were actually ok with losing 3 bubbleman to get fucking stratos. </br></br>  Anyways as badass as Gon's new synchro looks I hope it does more than get HUGE though maybe his deck will become more pendulum focused since that was a pretty high power combo for anime. 5k!!!!!  <br> Lmao <br><br> ... <br> pff. </br></br></br></br>  Shun is shorter than Reiji, what a manlet.  <br>I actually want Tsukikage to win now.</br>  <br>How tall is Reiji, exactly?</br>  <br>pshh...nothin personnel...kid</br>  <br>He's not winning. Did you forget the scene in the OP? It's the only one bar Reji confronting Leo and Yugo vs Yuya that hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>It's happened. Tsukikage was protecting Reira from Security.</br>  <br>If the scenes in the OP are anything to go by, Yuya, Yugo, Yuzu, and Crow will advance, while Gongenzaka, Serena, Tsukikage and Sawatari will drop out.</br>  <br>Not stated, I'd say 1.78 at most.<br>Have a Marco sensei.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for my LDS rocket.</br>  <br>Waiting forever.</br>  <br>Can he ever catch a break from his winning streak?</br>  <br> Serena will lose </br>  <br>you know mad chimera did shoot a rocket at Blaze falcon in sora vs shun 1</br>  Why can't you be more like /dng/, /a/?  <br><br><br>How about you fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tag Force 4 was a special game.</br>  <br>EGAO World hatsudo</br>  <br>She'll have to lose eventually if we make it to the end of the tournament. The only question is who defeats her. I'd like to see her duel Yuzu, but Bennis will probably take her out.</br>  <br>Is it bad to get an erection from the names of decks?</br>  <br>nigga those Aki deck's names IIRC</br>  <br>Explains why I have a throbbing erection, then.</br>  <br>You're likely right. Fusion nuts seem to be into keeping a clean win record and always going back to defeat who beat them before. Hmm, I kinda want this because they could show us what card Dennis planed on using on her before he noticed the obelisk force.</br>  Tell me /a/ what cards do you want to see cameo's of? Mine would be pic related.  <br>Fucking hate that fucking card.</br>  why did they choose to put the worst elements of 5d's into arc-v?    I can't for them to leave Synchro Dimension and we never see Crow again until he lays the finishing blow upon the final boss because Konami thinks everyone loves Crow.  Not enough fanservice.   return 1 BW <br> increase ATK until next draw <br>holy shit this card so good</br></br>  <br>You cannot attack though, so meh?</br>  <br> still no shirtless Yuuya </br>    <br> le Gale recycler <br>Its difficult to actually lv3 Synchro in Blackwings though.</br></br>  <br>Have meido Yuya.</br>  <br>Acceptable replacement</br>  <br>Oh right cannot attack, only good for first turn then</br>  <br> Look at thumbnail <br> "Why are her legs so short?" <br> That was from her knees down, didn't realize the middle area was her thighs and butt </br></br></br>  <br>There is also the bride Yuya.</br>  <br>So Shun would be about Yusei's height of 1.75?<br> tfw 1.76 <br>I-I'm 1.78 in shoes, so maybe I can wear a scarf and go full Reiji</br></br></br>  So does this mean Monosubs won't ever release 65 or what  <br>66 is taking priority. He'll probably release both around the same time.</br>  tfw it actually 3 different lv 3 BW synchro  <br> One can become a tuner <br> one can recover cards from graveyard <br> one minuses to deal 300 damage <br>One of these doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>300 damage anon. That 3/40 of their life points!</br>  <br><br>All three can become tuners I believe. We don't know what the secondary eff of the third one is</br></br>  <br>How about now?</br>  <br> Just topdecking a free Neo Tachyon, Dark Knight, or Giant Red Hand <br>Man thank god for that you have to draw it part or this card would be fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>This picture is a best picture.</br>  <br>Yuya would be wearing a EGAO in these situations. You can see all their personalities in their faces. So why is Yuya Y[uke]ya?</br>  <br>I've heard something about it having new support in one of the new Legendary Yugi's Decks that will come out soon.</br>   Ultra and Secret <br>Jesus, what are you doing KoA?</br>  <br>Are you surprised?</br>  <br>Why are you still playing TCG? You almost deserve to pay those unholy price tags for pieces of cardboard.</br>  <br>So in other words the duel was scripted. Real nice deduction. Even though Crow was distracted they gave Gon garbage for a hand, Crow two set up turns and a really weak Synchro that was deliberately shit as possible so Crow wins. So no shit Crow won, what a skilled duelist.</br>  <br>It'll be like $8 at best if people actually decide to play the deck, which they won't.<br><br>The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull.</br></br></br>  <br> The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull. <br> posts the dracoknight synchro <br>Have you not looked at Majespecter Dracoknights or what.</br></br></br>  <br>Not much but Luster P seems like the more useful card, and Ignister will probably just go up in price closer to the TCG release of DOCS.<br><br>Probably should have posted Tell or something, but I just remember literally every OCG CORE box opening I saw getting one or two of Ignister.</br></br></br>  <br>This only really happened with Crow vs Gon and Sora vs Shun. Both weren't exactly unexpected reactions considering Sorafags and Crow haters.<br>That's two duels.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Gon's hand wasn't really weak. Infact his hand was better than most of his duels.<br><br>If he had summoned any of his other Synchro monsters he still would've lost</br></br></br></br>  Anyone got a Red Demon's deck?  <br>But Crow could have found an Action Card that inflicted 4000 damage to Gon. Gon had no chance of winning.</br>  I wonder what archetypes the Tops duelists are going to run.<br><br>They'd have to be overpowered anime-only archetypes to make Crow not look like a faggot for whining about Tops while playing fucking BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  <br>Nobody actually buys cards anymore, they just use DN or Pro. At least anybody intelligent.</br>  <br>Who is he getting married to?</br>  <br>Someone crude and strong.</br>  <br>It really was, wasted two cards on Magnets, then the crappy shitty Pendulums reduced it further then no Souls either though they're a fairly large part of Gon's deck. Then the Synchro which had a restriction just so Gon couldn't take advantage of the misplay. I would have laughed hard if Soul buster Gauntlet showed up. Or any Soul really.</br>  <br>Crow?</br>  <br>Literally the only card in Gon's entire deck that would have saved him was the Glove</br>  <br>Shingo is the DSP of cardgames, except Shingo is funny.</br>  <br>That's probably why he decided to use Flutist as a random LV3 instead of the better Glove. Also not giving Flutist it's proper effect so it was straight up bad. What I'm saying is that a random Kabuto play would be better since that only wastes one card. But it was blatantly scripted like it was said before so Gon would have lost anyway.</br>  <br>Sawatari isn't running around like this constantly.<br><br> WHY WONT MY TRAP PLAY, I ACTIVATED CALL OF THE HAUNTED, BUT I HAVE NO MONSTERS IN THE GRAVEYARD, WHY CANT I TAKE IT FROM YOURS, THIS IS STUPID <br> Draw Phase: WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE, I DONT GET IT, THIS GAME ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH <br><br>etc. you get the point, Sawatari is dumb, but he's not that dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My deck maybe Xyz, but she is my ace.</br>    <br>I wouldn't call Sawatari dumb, he's just overconfident.</br>  <br>Yes, but he does blame Yuya for his own stupidity.</br>  <br>Nekroz.</br>  <br>I like how everyone ignores that Gon's cards were scripted so badly. Usually when someone makes a misplay they get punished for it but nah Gon can't do anything because his Synchro has a specific restriction. Then there's the Pendulums with insulting effects. Then there's blatant Magnet garbage which is obvious Raikiri bait. Then there's Gon not taking the first turn because he botches bike riding even though Crow's apparently distracted and shouldn't have made it to the first corner first then.<br>As a Samurai player this episode was really disappointing.</br></br>  <br>He only blamed Yuya for things after their first duel. Since their 2nd, he thinks of Yuya as one of his 'Sawatari Generation' disciples in an affectionate way.</br>  <br>Well, he must've forgotten that when they entered the Synchro Dimension. Because, he is reason security learned about Action Duels, and Pendulum Summoning. If Crow hadn't came along, they would've been sent to the facility.</br>  <br>Look I agree that Gon deserved the win more but there's not much you can do about plot armor sadly. Gon's cards were deliberately terrible especially the Synchro but blame the duel writing for that not Crow.</br>    Don't worry guys we probably won't have to deal with Crow's shit after this arc right. Right guys. He's not going to become a permanent cast member is he?      <br>Not likely. If they're really going to bring someone from Synchro along (since they were looking for strong people to join them), maybe Shinji?</br>    <br>fuck you, its going to be ENJOY guy he's pretty cool.</br>  <br>Enjoy is gonna die man.</br>  <br>Why is this a thing? I didn't get the impression Yuri and Serena were close.</br>  <br>He's old and old guys rarely get to help save the world in shonen so it's sadly inevitable. He's much more likable than expected. Why can't we have him instead of the boring thing that is Crow? I mean when he gets carded I'm going to be sad, if Crow gets carded my reaction will be one of happiness.</br>  <br>We know next to diddly shit about Yuri at the moment, and the other three pairs are close, so there's going to be something involving them for sure. The question is is there already a bond there (that was suppressed somehow) or will it form after they meet?</br>  <br>Because BUY BLACKWINGS</br>  <br>I want to  hug  shota Yuri.</br>  <br>The flashback of him as a kid is going to break some hearts, I can tell. A kid becoming THAT fucked up in the future can't not be a sad story.</br>  <br>My guess is they were, or would've been close, but Leo showed up and kept Serena locked up in academia</br>  <br>it'll be badass if he takes on more than 2 assholes from the DA.</br>  <br>They showed a few episodes of Tokumatsu. He's already likable<br>They showed more of Crow and I still don't like him. I guess he's a good person for raising the kids but still he just isn't interesting and I don't care really.</br></br>  Anon-kun, are you ready for bed?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Eh Sora vs Shun was a bigger outrage Probably because the show still had hype then. Crow winning caused anger but at least the thread was moving. Now it's near dead. Crow brutally murdered the hype. Though to be fair to him it was already massively declining.</br>    <br>It's good that the thread is slowing down, but it's far from dead. If you think this is dead, you should have seen earlier on in the show's run where we had threads lasting for upwards of two days.</br>  <br>WELL THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY</br>  <br>we already knew that Crow would win, even if we said Gon was going to deep down we all knew who'd win. the point reminds that Crow killed the fun anything crow touches with his manlet hands turns to shit.</br>  <br>Has anyone translated the names of Tag Force Special decks? The wiki doesn't have any</br>  <br>The english patch translates them if you want to try that.</br>  <br>Aporia's decks<br> The Current Despair <br> Just Despair <br> Inevitable Despair <br> The Hope Beyond Despair </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any interesting deck names?</br>  <br>Yeah this really. I had a tiny sliver of hope that Gon would win and something unpredictable would happen but no Crow won and it was just as meh as I thought it would be. It doesn't help that the new SHS Synchro that I was hyped for was really underpowered and blatantly designed so Crow would win.</br>  <br>It turns out Placido, like his namesake, is really into music<br> Wisel Overture <br> Wisel Prelude <br> Wisel Symphony <br> Wisel Armageddon <br><br> Wisel Concerto <br> Wisel Rhapsody <br> Wisel Divertimento <br> Wisel Requiem </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, not terribly funny but Meiru's is Happy Blue Unfortune<br> It's Necloths. </br></br>   yfw Ruri's eye color is   Galaxy   <br>Tried looking up the names in some Japanese wiki and I'm laughing at Sora's decks:<br> The Way I Use Scissors <br> Scissors Mischief <br> Scissors Mischief (the meaning is a bit meaner) <br> Seriousness of Scissors <br>I miss you so much, Sora...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just hope Crow doesnt become part of the main cast we all know whos going to be replaced pic related and it hurts me so.<br><br>even she is disgusted.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, Sora sure likes his Scissors. Any more, gems? What are Sawatari's decks called?</br>  I I had to come up with Tag Force style decknames, here's what I'd call Shun's<br> Falcon's Revenge <br> Falcon's Resistance <br> Falcon's Rebellion <br> Falcon's Revolution </br></br></br></br>  <br>Or<br><br> Must find Ruri <br> Found a Ruri, but not Ruri <br> Found a Second Ruri, still not Ruri <br> Ruri~ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I Am the Chosen One <br> Ice Emperor (Sawatari would fit SO well at Hyoutei) <br> Moebius Empire <br> Yosenju Phantom <br><br><br>His deck names are<br> Falcon Hunting <br> Eagle Hunting <br> Hawk Hunting </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are Yuya and Yuzu's decks called?</br>  <br>Glove only works on direct attacks so it wouldn't save him from that last attack, and frankly, someone having a shitty hand makes for a more realistic duel.<br><br>So many duels would have different results if the characters played their best pieces right away.</br></br></br>  ITT describe an anime poorly and others try to guess.

Also went to a date with someone in Disneyland <br> Yuka Iguchi→ Said in Radio that "I had Long become a lady" <br> Mamiko Noto→ Said in Radio "I am not a virgin". Also confessed to masturbate. <br> Kana Ueda→ Said in Radio that her boyfriend was thinking of the names for their kids on its own accord. <br> Yuko Goto→ Something on her own about a long distance relationship that failed. <br> Asami Imai→ Said in Radio "I had a kiss after a long time" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit she looks like a brown haired Hana</br>  <br><br>Do otakus care if the seiyuu are virgins or not? apart from idol-seiyuus.</br></br>  <br>Why do you keep making this thread?

And she loks dumb in this picture.</br>  <br>I'm sure all im@s seiyuu have been dating someone and are thinking about marrying once they're further in their 30s.

His voice turns me on.</br>    <br><br> &gt;Mizuki Nana→ Confessed to be sexually harassed as a young girl in her autobiography. <br><br>I don't think that means she's necessarily not a virgin, although I doubt she or most people in their 20s or higher would be.

Also confessed to masturbate. <br><br>This turned me on but I know exactly why.<br><br> &gt;Asami Imai→ Said in Radio "I had a kiss after a long time" <br><br>Again doesn't mean anything by itself.

I always thought Rickert was a girl.  <br>nice reading comprehension</br>  <br> I always thought Rickert was a girl. <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>in the early chapters he looked pretty girlish m8</br>  <br>Isn't berserk a harem now?</br>  Wow, it's finally out<br>Colour me amazed<br><br> I wish Rickert had told people the truth about Griffith, but I understand why he didn't. Nearly everyone is a blind Griffith worshipper now, so it would just be taken as false propaganda. <br>Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that.</br></br></br></br>    What if Guts dies &amp; Little Witch takes over?    <br>Shierke magical girl spinoff when?</br>  <br> magical girls <br> in my fate vs man manga </br></br>  <br>When  they get off the boat </br>  <br> in <br>That's not what a spinoff is.</br></br>  <br>He will be soon enough.</br>  <br>The only spinoff Berserk should have is a prequel about SK.</br>  <br> mahou shoujo witch piloting a corpse mecha </br>  <br>Are supporters supposed to tease you with their lewd soles like that ? Bitch.</br>  <br>I don't know, but bare soles are highly arousing.</br>  So yeah, we monthly now<br> but for how long? </br>  <br>Until idolmaster 4 and dark souls 3</br>  Is Guts a good person?  <br> Was a mercenary (out of need, not love of fighting) <br> fought to save his home country in the '100 years war' <br> left the band so the leader would recognize him as his friend <br> saves leader later because he likes him <br> is standoffish so people won't want to hang around him because of his curse <br> all he wants to do is save his gf <br>Yeah, Guts is a good person</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Was it Void who was reincarnated before Griffith? He is the oldest member so it would make sense.  <br>But he almost let vengeance consume him, to the point he was willing to let innocents die or even kill innocents.</br>  Why cant miura release at least 50 pages per chapter? Hes doing things monthly and he has the story planned out right? 20 pages is too short.  <br><br>Does it really matters, man, like whatever</br></br>  Silat Hype.<br>The true hero comes to save the boy..!</br>  <br>Silat a bro</br>  <br>Until the end!</br>  <br>We don't know</br>  <br>Sorry to ask, but what is this from?</br>  Can someone explain to me how Ganishka is kill?<br><br>I read it twice and the manga doesn't really explain it at all. Griffith flew into the trees, and then suddenly Ganishka flaskback, then Skull Knight arrived, trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? then suddenly Vatican sprout out of the trees, fairlytale creatures came out and Griffith became the 2nd coming of Jesus?</br></br>  <br> trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? <br><br>Neither.</br></br></br>  <br>Then what the fuck is he doing? I thought he's against the Godhand, why is he sprouting Vatican out of Ganishka?</br>  Is noname a virgin?  <br><br>Twice reborn and then cut with a sword that reaches deeper still, anon.<br><br>Skull Knight is bringing the God Hand closer to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does "twice reborn" means?</br>  <br><br>You have been reading Berserk right?</br></br>  <br>It means he was reborn once as an apostle and again as Shiva.</br>  <br><br>Ok I get that Skullknight tried to strike Griffith with his Behelit sword, but Griffith went Aizen and "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka.<br><br>But then where did the Vatican city come from? What is the extent of Skullknight's Behelit sword power? Would Vatican city sprout up if Griffith just killed Ganishka straight up without Skullknight's Behelit sword strike? What happened to Skullknight afterward? Did he just "well I dun goofed" and leave? <br><br>I'm glad that it finally ended the worst, drawn out arc in Berserk, but there are several things that doesn't make sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka. <br><br>No, Griffith is still dancing to Skullies tune here.</br></br></br>  Wait I don't understand. He got sad because Theresia hated him or because he fucked up her life? Between the weird character development of Gutts and the 0/10 literally worst translation i have ever read in my entire life it's getting kinda difficul to understand his character  <br>Falconia was the former capital of Midland that was buried beneath the earth which Griffith raised up using his god powers. <br>No idea.<br>Probably.<br>He fucked off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Skullomania's end game? What is his tune?<br><br>He can warp space and teleport anywhere he want, why can't he just murder all apostles in their sleep? Maybe not Griffith per say, because it has been shown that Griffith is omnipotent but Zodd, the Hunter, Lancer, Crystal Dragons etc stood no chance against Skull'O. <br><br>Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand, then I can't see any way Miura can come up with an acceptable way of Guts beating Griffith. Guts need to at least get Ascension and become Godhand himself, because no amount of Berserker armor power ups would help him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand <br><br>It's not only Griffith, all the other God Hand can do the same kind of thing. Void does it during the Eclipse when Skully breaks in.<br><br>Skull Knight outright states that he's planning on creating a portal to the "vortex" and trap the God Hand there. Right now I think he might be waiting on Elf Island for Guts to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no reason why the dragonslayer wouldn't hurt the godhand if it hit them<br><br>Hitting them is the hard part, though</br></br></br>  PLEASE I NEED HELP WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET THE DARKHORSE SCANS THIS SHIT IS KILLING ME  I don't understand how he managed to survive the heartbeats from the sea god <br>I really thought he at least would go blind after that</br>  Who or what is he?  <br>casca's son?</br>  <br><br>Wise magical negros apostle form</br></br>  <br>he's their son that griffith stole when he raped casca</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  can someone tell me why did he raped casca? <br>was it really just him being butthurt that she loved guts and not him?</br>  <br>Femto is devoid of humanity and compassion as is typical of all apostles.<br><br>All what's left in him was his bitterness and hurt over what Guts did to him. So he decided to punish Guts in the cruelest ways imaginable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reincarnated Soul of their son. It and Griffith (Femto) are connected. As long as one lives the other cannot die. To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child.<br><br>The fetus demon thing that Casca gave birth to was used as the vessel to bring Femto into the physical world. However when Femto manifested and took control of the body he forced the thing's soul out. This is it's new form.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A qt</br></br>  <br>Narrative. <br>But yeah, I think he was being possessive in order to destroy Guts. Something that not much people seem to notice about the rape is how "caring" Femto was. He kissed, licked and stimulated the way you'd do someone you want to give pleasure as well.<br>And to have the girl you love enjoying herself in an despicable act despite being so fucked up was enough not only to break Guts, but to break Casca as well.<br>Femto just killed two birds with one stone</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was one of the nicest moments in the manga so far.</br>  <br>You sure about that big boy?</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br> farnese <br>I really hope she gets hatefucked by a hundred apostles when guts has to choose if he wants to become a god hand</br></br>  <br>Almost and did are different things, Anon-kun.</br>  <br> Guts will never be your dad </br>  <br>You can use google, you know?<br> Witch Hunter </br></br>  <br>LOL Casca had the brand of sacrifice so i'm pretty sure she was suffering a lot</br>  <br>The brand wasn't bleeding and her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels.</br>  <br> Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that. <br>I always thought she was a smartass.</br></br>  <br> her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels. <br><br>You've been reading too much hentai anon. Arousal during rape is normal physical response. Doesn't mean she enjoyed it at all</br></br></br>  <br>she hasn't acted like she actually hates guts in like a hundred chapters, she just does retard comic relief stuff.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, probably silat and his outcast cloned friends are the only one who understand what griffith is.</br></br>  will rickert ever go through puberty?<br><br>where does he get his HRT prescription from?</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>A bit of both, actually</br>  <br> her body <br>You're not reading enough</br></br>  So I'm re-reading after stopping when they initially got on the boat. I currently just finished the volume where Griffith is reborn. <br><br>This time however, I read the excluded chapter 83. <br><br>Is there any good, well thought out speculation on what "Fear God(ch.83)" wants with humanity? Griffith just asked for wings. I want some exposition. If it's a reflection of humanity, then what the is it doing projecting more fear on humanity. It leads me to think Guts is either a character that's being guided by some opposing force.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*shit I'm pretty drunk<br><br>disregard that "either"</br></br></br>  <br> that awful quality </br>  <br>Schierke wants the dick so hard is unreal. I wish Guts would pound that loli ass already.</br>   a retarded homosexual actually thought that Rickert was a girl and he probably thought that Griffith was a girl too   Best girl  <br>Ooohhh! Mr. Silatt and his Pillar Men has finally arrived. I wish they did this pose after saving the Femto Slapper.</br>  <br>Could Dio take any of those three on?</br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  <br>holy shit this <br> <br>it's blatant how bad the manga is now</br></br></br>  <br>I'd kill myself.</br>  <br>Silly anon, the boat ride never ends.</br>  who's Miura favorite idol and why?  <br>Even good people make mistakes, the fact we are saying "almost" and not "did" shows that he is strong enough to remember that he still has morals. If Guts was a mindless killer, like when he is in the Berserk armour, things would be very different.</br>  <br><br> mahou shoujo bersekah magica </br></br>  <br>For all we know they may still get hurt from being hit with weapons such as draonslayer. I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part.</br>  <br>Chihaya, because "look at Casca".</br>  <br> I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part. <br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong but they've only ever pulled that out for Skully.<br><br>Slan herself manifested in that troll den and took a dragonslayer through her troll-intestine torso, that might have just been a remote astral body thing similar to what the dread emps was pulling though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Discuss all things Tsuyu Here  <br><br>Mina is second best girl, right behind Mei.<br><br>Also does anyone get an Amalia (gif related) vibe from Mina? Horikoshi did say he liked Wakfu.</br></br></br></br>  Deku x froggirl is my otp  <br>Yes, yes it is.</br>  <br>SOME DAYS YOU FEED ON A TREE FROG</br>  i think this is best girl  No new anime announcement for 2 seasons.<br><br>What the hell are they doing? Free and KnK movies are finished so they cant be workin gon them.<br><br>Can they still announce anything for Autumn season yet or next will be only Winter?</br></br></br></br>  Hibike! Euphonium S2 when?  Haruhi S3 never  <br>new full metal panic coming finally. fuck yeah!!!</br>  <br><br>Kyoani is finished.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>   its a recap episode   By the way, the mods/janitors are dead.<br><br>pepe threads usually get deleted in like 2 seconds. The fact that this one has been up for an hour means there are 0 mods on right now.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br>Please post more pepe image for my folder.</br></br></br>  SAGE SAGE SAGE SAGE   7 minutes of recap before the episode starts   <br>Report the thread you chucklefuck.</br>  I was shoveling snow from my driveway after a particularly bad blizzard. Suddenly a 1994 Honda Civic rolls up and parks right on the fucking sidewalk. Out steps Hideaki fucking Anno with a big ass grin. He takes wide strides as he walks towards me grinning. I knew he was up to no good. I try to disarm him by telling him how much I loved Evangelion and its soundtrack, but he just kept coming. He ignored me and just kept coming. I held my shovel firmly. When he entered into my personal space, he took one long step right in front of me and emphasized it, slamming his unit 01 themed shoe on the pavement. I flinched, big mistake. He was right up in my face screaming at me about how pathetic I was and how I should just die. I am a worm to Anno. I try to retort but I am reduced to a mumbling, stuttering bitch. He began imitating me and laughing loudly. The back door of his Civic opened and out stepped Rei, Asuka and Misato, who all surrounded me, jeering and howling. I ran inside and they have since taken up residence on my lawn. I can hear them having sex at night through my thin walls.
