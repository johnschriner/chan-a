It's imperative that you watch until the end.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Megu-nee is not a corpse! She's diejobu!</br>  <br><br>Wait until Megu-nee dies. When they show the reveal of her face in the OP it'll be half-rotten.</br></br>  <br>It's a psychological zombie apocalypse dude, the first episode is all the delusions of the MC until they reveal the zombie twist.</br>  mall next week<br><br>hype or no hype?</br></br>  <br><br>Where the hell do those side hairs come out of anyway?</br></br>  <br>She's  Hungry </br>  how often do chapters come out  <br>Kei need some loving</br>  <br>Hyped for Kurumi visiting her house.</br>  <br>It's in one of the Manga Time Kiraras, so monthly.

I think she was just a weirdo with no friends.</br></br>  <br>Yuuri is the cutest.</br>  So just re-read some of the latest chapters and my mind started going places.<br><br> I think Rii-san used Yuki as an accomplice to help her with her self delusions. <br>The first 2 pages of chapter 35, she has a conversation with her asking for something. Then it cuts ahead to the four of them reading the note from the elementary school. <br>It's set up to make it seem like the note was what she wanted to talk about, but I think she used the time earlier to convince Yuki to bring the bear along with them, so Rii could "discover" it later.</br></br> <br><br>I could be completely wrong, but there's more than enough to be suspicious about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck, that was the first scene that really made me cry.</br>  <br>Isolation is bullying, too.</br>  <br>Anon, you're a faggot.</br>  <br>Read between the lines.<br>It might not have been physical, but she clearly wasn't left alone.</br></br>  <br>People were laughing at her and talking shit behind her back. They said they felt sorry for Megu-nee for having to deal with her. Not only that, but Yuki appeared lonely and depressed. I think she was bullied, even if it was only lightly. Bullying is more than hiding her shoes, drawing on her desk, and insulting her to her face.</br>  <br>Holy shit thank you<br>At least I'm not the only one who's thinking this</br></br>  <br>I suppose it is. It kinda reminds me of those sad Lucky Star comics: pointing out that a cutesy strange girl would probably be ostracized in real life.</br>  <br>I know I am, but watching her curl up in her bed after her family has (presumably) turned... I couldn't take it.</br>  <br><br>Shit, that actually makes sense anon<br> FUCK a lot of sense </br></br></br>  <br>What bothers me is that it feels clearly made for 400x(400+90) but not only that the blue background is 91 px. high, it's also pushed up by 1 px., showing that ridiculous white line underneath. Goddammit whoever made that one Atelier Totori pic I copied.<br> Triggered. <br> Right after I hit Post in the previous thread, my OCD knew I fucked up. </br></br></br>  <br>Man up and be her replacement senpai.</br>  I want to protect that   hat    <br>fuck, man.</br>  <br>That sounds really stupid though. Why would she do that? It's not like they'd have known no one would be at the school either. This whole thing does seem suspicious though.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>Would you swim with drunken Gurachos?</br>  <br><br>Part of it was because of the hat. Why does she even wear the hat? She looks better without it.</br></br>  <br>I would if I could. But we're separated by dimensions.</br>  <br>While it does make sense, I can't help but stop and think: Why would Yuki agree? Why would Yuuri want to do something like that?<br><br>Just why?</br></br></br>  <br>It's cute</br>  <br>She's chuuni.</br>  <br>She's just crazy. If anyone's chuuni, Kurumi is.</br>  <br>It's cute AND she's childish as fuck. Even Megu-nee said that she acted too much like a little kid.</br>   Want to read the manga. <br> Norway scans. Translated by AP. <br> Fuck this, I'll read raws. <br> no raws of first few chapters on senmanga. <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>    So, we finally learned that senpai had already.graduated. When will we learn about the different colored uniforms for students in the same year?  OP or ED?  <br>She's also reverse chuuni.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mqQ<wbr>8Y9Sjp7o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>gakkou_gurashi.avi</br></br>  Post Megu-nee  <br>Like 3 weeks ago<br>It's symbolism</br></br>  <br>I was under the impression that only Yuki and the zombified students that she believes are alive have the blue-colored uniform, while everyone else has the white/green one.</br>  <br>Or, what if everyone is crazy? <br>Like, what if Kurumi, Yuuri and Miki started a zombie survival club, spurred on by their fandom of zombie media and the like, and this is the result of overactive imaginations on their part? They started out harmless enough; playing survival games at school, and recruiting one lesser-enthusiastic girl, Yuki. All is fine and well, until one day one of the girls goes too far and kills a "zombie", one of their classmates. The school is instantly thrown in a panic, and evacuated. The girls take this as a zombie invasion, and begin their process of boarding up the school to protect themselves. The police quickly arrive at the scene to apprehend the girls, but their traps and violent demeanor render the situation too dangerous and risky for standard police to interject.<br>We then learn, with time, that the girls were secretly apart of an underground cult that values purity and innocence above all else, living in a world of near-perpetual corruption. They kidnapped a girl, Yuki, and brought her to a place where no one would intrude and poison their rituals, an abandoned school. The girls keep Yuki here in order to develop an object of purity worthy of their worship. The zombies/police are actually agents of a secret organization, determined to keep corruption spread, and eliminate innocence entirely. Soon, the agents start infiltrating the base, to retreive Yuki for corruption, and eliminate the other gurashis.</br></br></br>  <br>ED<br><br>The OP only worked for me with episode 1 and kinda for 2. I was hoping it'd be changed to something more overall appropriate to the series</br></br></br>  <br>One day you'll be able to meet her.</br>  <br>All is not over yet, however, as it turns out that actually this is the stage of a hit reality television show gone completely wrong, where three actors bring in an unsuspecting girl and see if she can live a cutesy school life while three actor girls are pretending to protect her. The show is a hit; sweeping across japan, and the three actors that chaperone yuki start developing rabid fans. One subsect of those fans, one would argue rightfully the most extreme, is a trio of girls who look up to the three actors in an almost obsessive way. Overwhelmed by this obsession they break onto the set of the show one night while they're sleeping, and kill them in their sleep. They then pull off immaculate cosplays of their heroes, and live as the idols they'd loved so dearly, while no one is all the wiser. Well, almost no one.<br>Eventually, the other extreme fans notice slight character changes in the "new" Gurashis; no one is perfect at pretending to be someone else, after all. Conspiracies develop that question the legitimacy of the girls, and soon a sect is developed to capture them and reveal to the world their illegitimacy. A rogue faction of fans tries to break into the set, as the three super-fans once did, but these three thought ahead; they fought back against the otaku, until they were eventually forced to retreat. Not to take the situation lightly, the fans devised a plan; let in a dog, bugged with a microphone, to spy on the girls. This would work well, as the girls are known to hold fondness for small dogs. A dog is gathered for the operation. It's small, so it should be harmless. Or so they thought.</br></br>  <br>That's real stupid</br>  <br>The dog was actually one they found as a stray. It seemed peaceful, though almost weak, so they captured it for the mission. Little did they know, however, that a few nights earlier, the dog had been bitten by a rat with a strange disease, and was afflicted as well. This showed in its steadily increasing rage upon being caged and transported to the school with a group of elite fans. The moment they released the dog, it viciously turned and attacked its owners. It bit and scratched every one of them, before eventually sucumbing to its own illness and dying on the spot. They decided to abandon the mission and implement a secondary plan of some sort. They went home that night, defeated, and slightly nauseous.<br>It didn't take long for the disease to spread through Japan's dense population. One by one people were killed and brought back, until all that remained were few secluded factions. This is the story of one such faction. A group of girls whose dreams became reality.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah but in the flashback other kids had her uniform color</br></br>  <br>What is that expression supposed to be?</br>  Is it wrong fapping to the garashis?  <br><br> No </br></br>  <br>It won't be the same.</br>  I know zombie survival isn't the main point of the show but holy fuck are these people inept. They're up against easy mode zombies that move slow as shit, how have they not cleared at least the school building of zombies and locked the doors so more can't wander in  <br>No, wait, I've got it!<br><br>Yuki is real.<br> The other girls are puppets! </br></br></br></br>  My friend told me to get into this because it was LITERALLY MADOKA XXDDD.<br><br>It's not Madoka, but in some ways I think it's more disturbing. There's this real quiet sense of despair, which waves and wanes but overall seems to be building up.. It's pretty spooky.</br></br>  <br>And don't forget that forshadoing, the teddy bear and the helicopter</br>  <br>They're like 14.</br>  Nice touch showing Megu-nee's location at the end of the ep.  <br>They're like 17</br>  <br>Second and third year high schoolers. 16-18 years old.</br>  <br>I had already completed around 4 call of duties when I was at that age.</br>  <br> holy fuck are these people inept <br><br>No shit, only one person in their group carries a weapon even though there should be plenty of baseball bats and materials to make weapons laying around.</br></br></br>  Will they show Megu-nee's suffering next episode? Until some real suffering i won't be really satisfied with the anime  <br>Why do you want to see cute innocent girls suffer?</br>  <br>They should've literally been able to clear the school grounds by now.<br><br>Just lure the zombies to the wall and drop shit on their heads from the rooftop</br></br></br>  <br>I don't want suffering. I want everything to stay daijobu for a few more weeks.<br><br>Everything has to be daijobu ;_;</br></br></br>  Now this is the kind of Megu-nee I like  <br><br>Kurumi being forced to brutally beat her first love to death with a shovel coupled with Yuki's first breakdown wasn't suffering enough for you anon? I got a little choked up when Yuki ran over and hugged Kurumi and sobbed.</br></br>  <br>Megu-nee doesn't shower in the morning.<br><br>I thought all girls showered in the morning.<br><br>And that is the saddest breakfast I ever seen in anime.<br><br>Just cheap toasted bread with no butter, jam, or cheese in sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee a cute</br>  <br>That got me excited.<br><br>Fuck I'm a deviant.</br></br></br>  <br>The  alive  one?</br>  <br><br>Be careful not to cut yourself on those edges.</br></br>  <br> having time for breakfast </br>  <br>I most say that scene did shock me a little, no music, good camera works and sound, really nice, but that's just the tip, if they don't show Megune-nee reading the book then later on that "scene" won't be that much of a shock</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure most elevens in general don't shower in the morning. They take showers/baths at night before bed and then just wash their faces and get dressed in the morning. <br><br>If you think about it it's actually probably a better order of operations in many ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>eric</br>  Hey hey Nozaki-kun!   You will never marry Megu-nee <br> She will never say "It's not Megu-nee, it's Sakura-sensei!" to you <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>Why would I call my wife Sensei or Nee?</br>  So when are we getting Korean scans for chapter 38?  <br>Questionable hobby?</br>  When you see it  <br>Because you want to bully her.</br>  <br>The suffering in just getting started.</br>  <br>Because Onee-san and also this: </br>  what kind of shitty track team members can't outrun zombies  <br>Just a little translation.</br>  <br>THIS<br><br>The zombies are slow as fuck.<br><br>I can't believe the track team can't outran literal mindless retards.<br><br>It's like they never played Tag before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta kill as many people i can and as fast as i can, and peole woulnd't react that fast thinking "oh, its a zombie apocalypse!" only diehard zombie fans</br>  just caught up fuck im excited ep are they gonna adapt up to  <br>The ones that trip. Good fucking job, guy.</br>  <br>Oh, fuck you</br>  <br> Tfw when blue/green colorblind. <br> Tfw can't tell which ones are wearing blue and which ones are green. </br></br>  <br> Part of the track team <br> Trips on thin air <br>This is why they make certain people sit out</br></br></br>  <br>Would you Taroumaru her Brazilian flags?</br>  If rii is yuri then what is ruu?<br><br>yuru?</br></br>  <br>Everyone knows what a rabid dog looks like.<br><br>Normalfags know to stay away from people stumbling around which is why it is easy to react to zombies or drunk people.<br><br>Nobody in real life is gonna get close to someone walking weirdly much less touch them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they're coming at you from multiple directions and you get cornered, then you're fucked.</br>  <br>They will if they're your friend, or if you're in the middle of practice and someone collapses and you think they might have heat stroke or something.</br>  <br>Japanese cold sure is a bitch</br>  I genuinely wonder how I'd act if I was caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak in a world where the concept of zombies didn't exist.  Two ways for zombies to be real and they'll be sprinting zombies no matter what in our future:<br><br>1. Advanced Mad Cow Disease or Rabies that evolved i.e. 28 Days/Weeks zombies<br>2. Nanobots in the far, far future where it kills the host from the inside and takes over to make your corpse go nuts</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck. I didn't come back to read this until it was done.<br><br>That was a mind rape of a twist. I didn't get why the halls were barricaded at first. But then I started to figure something was up.<br><br>This is dark as shit. I love it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be more wary of truck-san</br>  <br> Zero ways for zombies to be real <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>Zombies don't have good coordination.<br><br>They are also easy to trip and push around.<br><br>Zombies are far less coordinated than Big Dog.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>FUCK OFF NO. Shovel will be diejobu.<br><br>R-Right? ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you're panicking and there's ten zombies coming at you, you're not going to think straight.</br>  <br>I'm not stupid enough to touch someone that is collapsed even if they are my friend.<br><br>The first thing I would do is call 911 because in fiction and in real life, they always repeat to people to not touch someone that is collapsed and call for help, instead, because you could make the injury worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Seems all the females are laying down for their male classmates.</br>  <br>her ears. She is 90</br>  <br>  2. Nanobots in the far, far future where it kills the host from the inside and takes over to make your corpse go nuts <br>That's fucking Jason X<br><br><br>The only monster more dangerous than zombies and man</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But humans are the strongest when they are panicking.<br><br>The adrenaline rush makes you forget pain or fatigue and makes you capable of strength that you normally wouldn't be capable of using.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, anon.</br>  So i'm about to start this series, what i'm getting into?  What kind of zombies they are? 28 days ones? Resident Evil ones? Walking Dead ones?   <br>While a few people die every year, 99 percent of humans still survive Black Friday.<br><br>And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies.</br></br></br>  <br>Well most people will do the contrary and check on them if they are ok or something.</br>    <br>Pain and fatigue, yes.<br>"There's three thingies over there, two over there and one over there. I need to run this way, which is in the middle of them, to get away.<br><br><br>I don't have a proper reply for this. Have a cookie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just cute girls doing cute things, anon.<br> Romero type, except things don't add up somewhere. </br></br>  <br>They're walkers, but the focus isn't really on the zombies. Don't expect tons of zombie chopping action.</br>  <br> And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies. </br>  <br>No, most people will call 9-11 than touching an injured person. <br><br>You're not a doctor. <br><br>Who do you think you are?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The walking dead ones<br><br><br>Anon, you evil genius</br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy on the track looks headless. Did I see it?</br>  <br>It's just a slouch.</br>  <br> And Black Friday humans are way more dangerous than zombies. <br><br>Yeah, fighting over cheap made in [insert sweat shop country] products.</br></br></br>  <br>The brazilian shirt?</br>  How fucked would the School Life Club be if the zombies were 28 Days type?  <br>Then what was I supposed to see?</br>  <br>I love how you're generalizing<br><br>You're not a doctor.<br><br>Who do you think you are?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They would be already dead by now, those fucking monsters were unstoppable</br>  <br>In a situation I see someone sprawled across the ground, the first thing I'd do is get close first and ask if the guy is ok or something. What happens next depends.<br><br>I'd have to be really paranoid or careful to stay away a good distance the whole time without knowing the situation and call 9-11<br><br>And no I'm not a doctor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there wouldn't be a series</br>  <br><br>I wanted you guys to see a torso standing up but its shadow is the whole body. It tickled my fancy.</br></br>   Gakkou Gurashi   <br>Rii is sex, and so's her voice. Who voiced her anyway?</br>  <br>You have no idea. All it takes is one idiot to screw everything up. I once saw a guy get hit by a bus, and some guy just comes running and flips his body right side up, killing him in the process while asking if he's okay. People aren't as smart as you think.</br>  <br>M.A.O</br>  <br>I once almost stepped on a drunk guy sleeping in the movie theater parking lot and almost jumped backwards in the air in fright and just get the fuck out of there without wondering what the fuck was that guy doing there. <br><br>It made me regret not using the elevator and like I think I would have shat bricks if that guy just suddenly opened his eyes and looked at me.<br><br>This was at night too. Common sense would dictate not to stick around in weird situations.<br><br>I could have gotten body slammed by the drunk guy if I tried to ask if he was okay or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichimichi, Mao who also voiced pic related</br>  <br><br>Even as a medical worker and good Samaritan act protecting me, the only help I'll give to a collapsed person is calling an ambulance if no one does it. No more after that.</br></br>  <br>These aren't strangers though. These are friends and classmates in your school and club.</br>  <br>Based M.A.O.</br>  <br>I'd do the same, but I wouldn't touch the injured fuck. There's a difference between getting in talking distance and being in touching distance.</br>   Is Megu-nee dead?   <br>This is why Chinese people are so shitty.</br>  <br><br><br> also voiced Aoko and Vorona <br> looks this pretty <br><br>Holy wow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8/10, I kek'd</br>  <br> Are you? <br> You sure? </br></br>  <br>Of course not.</br>  <br>And what if you can't get through to an ambulance like in ep. 3? You just gonna let your friend sit there and die on the ground?</br>  <br>Her Kansai-ben is sex to listen too as well.</br>  <br>to*</br>  <br><br>Everyone ignores her existence except for hat. It could be like a fight club thing, where she keeps her alive in her head to a high degree. To the point where she's attending classes by herself and learning from herself, but even she sometimes forgets she's there. Deep down in her mind, she knows it's a zombie apocalypse, but the trauma made her splinter the last teacher she met into an alternate personality.</br></br>  <br>Not everything can be solved by locking lips with an unconscious person.<br><br>At this point, you should yell out loud if there is a doctor or nurse around you.<br><br>Even a local pharmacy worker would be better than nothing because at least they are knowledgeable enough to give you vaccine shots or compound medicine.<br><br>Some drugs have nasty side effects if you accidentally get them in contact with the skin so a pharmacy worker should be knowledgeable enough about first aid and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Am I clueless like every other background character that gets bit easily or do I know what's going on and don't wanna get bit by a soon to be zombie? Also nigga I'm off the clock, sign yourself in to the waiting room when I'm wearing the uniform. <br><br>Also! You wanna know what's the closest to a zombie on the job? PCP patients.</br></br></br>  <br>nah dawg i kinda just noticed now as well since you've pointed it out</br>  <br>What if you're actually replying to yourself right now?</br>  <br>Realizing your limits is key to survival.<br><br>How many people drown trying to save their pet dogs in the water?</br></br></br>  <br> I know for a fact that one of those isn't me because of the timestamps, but that really fucked me up. </br>  <br>Man those articles are a bummer to read.<br><br> Pet gets swept away by strong current/wave/etc <br> Owner goes in <br> Fast current drowns them <br> Pet survives regardless in the end and gets to shore a few minutes after </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Japanese kids really stay late after school.<br><br>I remember my highschool janitors would start kicking kids out long before the sun started setting because they want to get their job done asap and then go home too.</br></br>  so is yuki still bein delusional in the latest chapters cos she seems more capable  <br>The worse ones are ones that cause a chain reaction.<br><br>Pet owner starts drowning and then his or her entire family go into the water trying to save him or her and they all end up drowning and this is all because of a pet dog.</br></br></br>  Where the chink scans at  <br>No one fucking cares. Shut up.</br>  <br>Or lose their memories saving other people's pets? RIP Prison School Chairman, best character in that manga.</br>  <br>She's pretending to be retarded</br>  <br>In the manga: she has pretty much accepted reality as it is but Rii's now the delusional one<br><br>In the anime she's still, even more than she was in the manga</br></br></br>  First episode was fun but I sure hope this gets better. Writing an average zombie story on the lower end of mediocre and making all the leads cute girls doesn't make it good.  <br>Someone should edit that one comic with Yuki.<br> hurr look I'm so delusional! School is so fun! </br></br>  But how did they defeat all those zombies before they set up the barricades with just one girl wielding a shovel?  <br>How well would Chiyo do in a zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br>Her mental state is inversely proportional to Rii-san's.</br>  Phones are always down in an emergency situation but how about radios?<br><br>I heard there is a cellphone app that lets you still call people through radio or something.<br><br>Is that shit legit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sports teams at my school were frequently at school pretty late (6-8pm).</br>  <br>It was after school hours, so the students were either outside the school, doing sports club activities, or at their houses. You see a lot of students because zombies return to the places in their memories. So, they just had to defeat a few zombies, not a whole school.<br><br>The few zombies that were at school are still around, but they are a minority (we see one at the library and one just outside the barricade, for example). Kurumi has probably killed most of the zombies that were inside when the outbreak happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Should be easy at night though since the zombies kind of retreat.<br><br>A shovel is more than enough for the stragglers.<br>Add to that Yuki was still kind of capable during that time so that's +1 lookout</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's important that people know that medical workers are human too and most won't help collapsed people on the street.<br><br>Kurumi realized how dumb and low the zombies were in groups less than 3 and probably just cleared them out nice and slowly.</br></br></br>  <br> making all the leads cute girls doesn't make it good <br>Certainly makes it better, though.</br></br>  i like how their only weapon is literally a shovel. I youd think theyd all carry around weapons  <br> radios <br>There's a character in the manga that has her own radio station. The girls listen to her at one point.</br></br>  <br>How is it an average zombie story?</br>  <br> weapons <br> In Japan <br> In a Japanese school <br>You can thank Nevada-tan for that. All they have is a shovel (because gardening club) and a knife (which is pretty damn hard to use against zombies, anyway).<br><br>Though it makes me wonder why didn't they just steal a baseball bat from the baseball team. Miki is capable enough of using it as a weapon, unlike Rii-san and Megu-nee.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are still Japanese high school girls.<br><br>Exception for Shovel since she's already tasted blood.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yuki does use a baseball bat in later chapters. It's strange why they don't use gardening tools or try making makeshift weapons like a desk leg.</br></br>  If a zombie outbreak happened in highschool and I couldn't get out of school, I would head to the autoshop or gardening club.<br><br>I avoid the fuck out of the shit like the football lockers because knowing how big football players much less jocks are, I rather not deal with zombies that are large and more powerful than average.<br><br>I wouldn't survive by teaming with the jocks as well, seeing that they consume a shitload of calories than average and food supplies ain't gonna last with jocks.<br><br>However, things would be different if I was in a Japanese highschool.<br><br>Pretty much dash to the archery club or kendo club.<br><br>Those kendo club "armor" would be pretty useful to have.<br><br>And if I was in a Canadian highschool, the first location to run too would be the hockey team.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fighting is tiring, so it's better to evade them, not even Kurumi fights one or two at the time.</br>  <br>They're all the same:<br> shit happens on the news <br> "oh dear" <br> protag sees zombie in the flesh <br> "oh dear!" <br> survivors edge out <br> now we must survive <br> usually some sort of objective secondary to survival, to provide a framework for a plot <br> this anime's plot relies on expecting me to care about these girls' shitty backstories <br> "muh boyfriend, m-muh shovel" <br> "muh spontaneously contracted schizophrenia" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just a whack on the head. The hard part is getting over the fact that they look human and smell bad.</br></br>  <br>It's not schizophrenia, it's PTSD. Get your shit straight. :^)</br>  <br>Your description is so generic that it works not only to zombies but battle manga, vampires, SOL etc.</br>  <br>Now, every time she sees her boyfriend, she's going to hit him with a shovel.</br>   Watch the ending <br> The fucking red mini cooper </br>  <br>Even so they aren't strong fighting them it's more risky than trying to evade them.</br>  <br>Is this the part where the zombie expert starts dishing out zombie movie recommendations? i hope it is</br>  <br>What, your school didn't have an archery class? Ours had one and even a rifle team.</br>  <br>but only Kurumi gets the shovel, anon.</br>  <br>What is a British car doing in Japan?</br>  <br>Megu-nee has good taste in cars</br>  <br> vampires <br> fucking SOL <br> "now we must survive" <br>Literally what</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was part of PE for me. New England here.</br>  <br>Should have bought a SUV. <br><br>4 wheel drive, man.</br></br></br>  <br>It's more about the characters lleft alone in this situation than the zombies anon</br>  <br> Had* </br>  <br>Okay I exaggerated with SOL, but the rest applies.</br>   when Kurumi and the others go down in to the basement of the school after Mii-kun has gotten the medicine for her and cured her Kurumi opens this door and sees something spoopy and then closes it and says "coward" is it implied that Mii-kun didn't kill megu-nee and just locked her in that room I don't understand   <br> vampires <br> now we must survive <br>You survive the fucking vampire onslaught, see jojo or something.</br></br></br>  My highschool was next to the community golf course.<br><br>I would have broke into the country club and overpower the golf club membership owning elites with my highschool mates to survive this zombie apocalypse.<br><br>And there's a lot of ducks and swan that hand around the lake in the golf course.<br><br>I don't know if they would be suitable for eating but I would be desperate in a zombie situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The principal killed himself. </br>  <br>yeah principal</br>  <br>Denmark doesn't have high schools, 0th to 10th grade collected in one school. No special clubs, only rooms for the subjects which require it like biology, gym or psysics. So i would probably run to woodshop for saws, hammers and screwdrivers, to the kitchen or canteen for knives and lastly to the gymnastics for aluminium bats.</br>  <br>She sees someone else  presumably the president  who apparently hanged himself. He took the easy way out.</br>  <br>Look at her fucking eye. Jesus Christ holy shit.</br>  <br>In this episode I think it's the Vice-Principal</br>  <br> what the fuck lmao </br>  <br>Was he the same guy that gave her the emergency manual in the manga?</br>  <br> Kurumi refers to the Principal who was aware of what was going on in the basement but couldn't take it so he hanged himself </br>  <br>I think so.<br><br>It's kind of an investment to give a char design for both the Principal and Vice-Principal, so I assumed it's the latter.</br></br></br>  <br>God how do you even read any other manga if you didn't see that</br>  <br>It wont change, it'll remain as your average, lower mediocre zombie story, drop it now.</br>  <br>Just wait, in a few minutes he'll be back asking what happened to the pilot and radio-chan.</br>  What happened to the pilot and radio-chan?  <br>No one cared who she was until she put on the hat.</br>  <br>  Just wait, in a few minutes he'll be back asking what happened to the pilot and radio-chan. <br>This goddamn speedreaders</br></br>  <br>I'll bash yer fooking 'ead m8</br>  <br>They are the ones locked in the classroom in the elementary school.</br>  <br>彼女はもう死んでいる</br>  In a zombie scenario, the Drama Club would be the first to die.<br><br>The most clueless would be the Computer Club.<br><br>Anyone disagree?</br></br></br></br>  <br> clueless <br> computer <br>They'd have fucking internet access to the news and shit, and would be able to harness technology the best. <br><br>The real clueless club would be the  anime club </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's probably some tragic backstory. <br><br>It was a gift from a friend/family member who died (pre-zombie) or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how the Hibikeks would have fared with their oversized instruments.</br>  <br>I really hope not. I don't like that cliche.</br>  <br>Or it's just cute and she wants to express her individuality with a cute hat.</br>  <br>Anyone that is outside or that drinks the water is probably screwed. Sports teams would probably get hit first and the hardest.</br>  <br> they play music <br> zombies flock to autism-chan doing her trumpet solo <br>They would actively bring zombies to them, so arguably worse than the drama club</br></br></br>  <br> They'd have fucking internet access to the news and shit <br><br>Who the fuck reads news on the computer in the computer club?<br><br>In my time, it was Counter Strike all the time in the highschool computer club.<br><br>No one reads the news.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Dawn of the Dead, the zombies were intended to be analogues for mindless consumers. They just sat in a mall all day.</br>  <br>But highschools love blocking the shit out of sites like youtube.</br>  <br> CT B41 master race </br>  When it hit me that Meguu nee is  Deader than 2pac.  <br>I'm slow ;_;</br>  <br><br>Does blunt damage even affect zombies that much? They could probably survive a few brain injuries.<br><br>More zombies would keep coming from all the noise too. A quick silent shovel to the neck is all you can do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Makaveli is alive.</br>  When Kurumi beheaded her zombie boyfriend she earned back her purity as otaku waifubait.  spoilers when  How many zombies can I go through with a wooden bat? It's all I have.  <br>  slow as her lol  </br>  <br>it all depends on your physical fitness, and stamina levels.</br>  <br>Depends on how well the bat is made, but I can't imagine too many since bats are designed to hit balls, not bludgeoning multiple human bodies.</br>  <br>the dog is  not actually in the manga for that long </br>  Will picture related be featured in the anime like it did in the manga?  What would have happened if they kept the gun?  <br>most baseball bats are made of white ash, which is an extremely hard and durable wood. add the fact that zombies are usually more decomposed than your average human, they should last just fine.</br>  <br>If you're fit you'll porbably need about 3 hits to get one zombie, which means you wouldn't survive against even a small group of them.</br>  <br>yeah it was in for like one chapter</br>  <br><br>Miki wouldn't have to kill Kurumi.</br></br>  <br>Probably no changes so far. I still think they would have ran from the biker dudes even if she had a gun.</br>  <br>They should have kept the gun.<br><br>Those males with motorbike helmets wouldn't have tried chasing them, then.</br></br></br>  <br>gun shots attract more zombies, using it would be bad and you'd just run out of ammo quick.</br>  <br>  Ya want a fight, ya piece of shit? Come and get it fucking maggots! <br>Never played "I am alive"?</br></br>  <br>No bully! It only took me like half the episode, I haven't read the manga in a while, and didn't even remember how things developed time line-wise.<br><br>Just like  Meguu-nee </br></br></br>  <br>Yuki would accidentally shoot  Ruu .</br>  <br>That's why it's a last resort anti-human weapon.</br>  <br>But Kurumi would probably have killed herself and there'd be no zombie superpowers to save Rii.</br>  <br>Maybe Kurumi's death would have snapped Rii out of her delusional spiral, and got her back into being a responsible nee-san.</br>  <br>Their RV car makes more noise than a gun shot.</br>    <br>Gun shots are definitely louder than a car, but I still think getting rid of it was a waste.</br>  <br>Rii-sama is really popular among japs</br>  <br><br>Or it would make her even more delusional and pretend that there are two people with them.</br></br>  <br>I wasn't ready in the manga, and i'm not ready for the broken voice with despair</br>  <br>I can see the appeal.</br>  <br>I would grab the plastic butter knife from the school cafeteria and activate my Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</br>  <br>She's the least popular of the four main girls, and far behind Yuki and Kurumi.</br>  <br>So, Miki is best girl then?

You should watch it (instead of those "cute girls doing cute things and trying to be gangster").</br></br>  Tempted to read this but I don't want to ruin my experience of the anime.  the most epic show of the season  <br> tumblr <br> epic <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br><br>You too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like this entire show is going to be the main character being the only prepared fuckass trying to round up his herd of sheep and attempt to keep them from murdering eachother/arguing/being idiots the whole season.<br><br>Everyone's name has meaning with what they do so I guess that's why he's the Mayor.</br></br>  <br>But he's the one trying to lead the sheeps to death.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br><br>He's "The Most Interesting Man In The World (As Oppose To Being The Strongest)."

Not saying it's well written though.</br></br>   epic <br><br>But how the fuck is this pandering? Do you just like using buzz words?</br></br>  <br> tumblr filename <br> epic <br>an epic thread indeed</br></br></br>  So far it set course of becoming an epic failure alright.  at least it's not Chaos Dragon  I want to impregnate Fremy.  Is this shit worth the investment of time? Because I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show.  Not at all.  Not at all.  <br><br>Does it have one of those endings where it all just amounts to nothing?</br></br>  I enjoyed it. <br><br>I haven't finished it all, but whenever I'm bored I find myself watching an episode or two more.<br><br>Railgun is more slice of life, and Index is more plot and story driven.<br><br>For the time investment, it's probably not worth it because it's a pretty 6/10 anime and there are 4 seasons of episodes so it's ALOT of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just tired of watching anime where the ending is something ambiguous, open-ended bullshit.</br>  <br>The story is ongoing. The anime are adaptations.</br>  I liked it, just watch it I did hate how it ended though  Are you interested in the characters? How touma and mikasa have that little thing going? Want to see it progress? <br><br>Then don't bother watching the show, it sidelines all that shit.<br><br>Do you like the idea of a city full of mutants with superpowers? Do you want to explore that idea in more detail?<br><br>Don't bother tuning in, all the shit gets pushed aside.<br><br>Want to watch a very generic battle shounen? Want to watch it twice from slightly different perspectives? Did endless 8 give you a semi, but you wish it could have dragged out a bit longer?<br><br>This is the show for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show. <br><br> Implying the main character isn't the one dragging the whole series down </br></br></br>  <br>What? The main character is a typical haremshit gary stu. I only enjoyed s2 of Railgun. Index was boring shit. <br>So no, it's not worth the time in my opinion. But if you actually like the white knighting preacher that is Touma, then maybe it's for you after all.</br></br>  im on episode 3 don't think i will continue  <br>I'd say it's worth it. Wasn't really a fan of the Raildex series until I finally decided to sit down and watch it just this year. Depending upon your views you may or may not like the TouMan but he's one of my favorite MCs. If not, you might like a bunch of other characters though because one of the strengths of Raildex is that it does bring a diverse cast of characters along with it.<br><br>Railgun is pretty SoL while Index is your generic shounen. It's pretty average but if you like Touma telling people why they're not living their life correctly and punching his way through tough opponents to the point where you might think he has plot armor, then you'll enjoy it immensely like me. <br><br>If you enjoy it enough, you can read through the 20+ light novels that take place after the anime ends and come discuss with other fellow LNfags. The newest volume is getting translated right now and we're discussing about  PTSD Touma and Misaka getting BTFO </br></br></br></br></br>  No  <br><br>Sorry but Accelerator isn't a main character.</br></br>  <br>The main character is the worst part.</br>  Index S1 is really mediocre. I tried watching Railgun but I dropped it 3 episodes in. I don't understand why this has such a big following on /a/. Maybe the Index LN and Railgun manga are just better.  <br>Railgun is way better than the endless 8.<br>Touma from misaka's perspective is just so flawless.</br></br>  <br> Is this shit worth the investment of time? <br>No.<br> I feel as if the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show. <br>You're not feeling correctly.</br></br></br></br>  Have you lived your life correctly today /a/?  <br> spiky haired gary stu generic beta self insert MC <br> redeeming factor <br><br>Nope</br></br></br></br>  <br>Railgun was a fine adaptation and is worth a watch if you skip the fillers. Index on the other hand got butchered hard but I still watched to the end. In the end I picked up the LNs and they are pretty great. The story is fun and the characters are interesting. Also the powerlevels and final boss shenanigans are pretty hype.</br>  <br> Railgun was a fine adaption <br>Fuck no it wasn't.</br></br>  <br>I don't see anything wrong besides the fillers.</br>  <br>Index is cheesy as hell and kinda shit. Just watch Railgun.<br><br> 32 hours <br> a lot of time </br></br></br></br>  <br>I sit around at home all day wishing something special would happen to me while becoming a worse and worse person to the point I cant even see myself being happy even if i was transported to a magical anime waifu world with super powers.<br>So no.</br></br>  <br>Nagaispace invades even the canon content. He constantly changes shit for no reason and has the characters act OOC. He removed Touma from a lot of the manga and replaced him with retarded Saten scenes for no reason.</br>  No, instead of watching 96 bad episodes of anime watch some good anime instead.  <br> not loving satan unconditionally <br>It's like you're some kind of a cunt.</br></br>  I honestly think that even if you want to watch the anime along with the LNs, you should skip Index S1. The Sisters arc and Accelerator's arc were the only parts they made enjoyable to watch.  <br>Saten a useless level 0 shit.</br>  <br> good anime </br>  <br>You're a shit, please die.</br>  <br><br>Good anime exist anon, just stop watching Typemoon crap.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Nagai you dumb nigger.</br>  <br>Ninety-nine percent of the cast is useless at this point.</br>  <br>Only when it comes to the main story of Index. Other characters can still be useful in side stories like Railgun. Saten isn't even useful in Railgun though so she's the pinnacle of worthlessness. At least Uiharu is good with computers since her esper power is useless.</br>  <br> Touma <br> not-Touma <br> Aleister <br> Fiamma <br> Accel <br>Does anyone else even matter?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fiamma <br>Literally worse than Stiyl at this point.</br></br>  <br> the main character is the only redeeming factor of the show <br><br>What did you just fucking say?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Best Kihara</br>  <br>He's right. Touma is the only real reason to read or watch this shit.<br><br> “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shounen-level cheesy speech that makes no sense if you actually think about it.<br><br>I suppose you can read it ironically.</br></br></br></br>  Old Thread <br><br>Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>OC stands can go here &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/<br><br>Okuyasu is best BroJo</br></br></br></br></br></br>  did anyone else think the shrinking people in part 4 were stupid as hell  <br>I dont remember the shrinking part?</br>    <br>Gay Priest will be arriving soon.</br>  <br>Did you read Duwang?</br>  <br>Why did Araki draw this?</br>  <br>No, I genuinely cant remember</br>   everyone is a mini version of themselves <br> except Koichi  <br><br>I am laffin</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama influence</br>  <br> flipping off Cell </br>  <br>Or maybe Joseph couldn't see stands while he was fighting Kars.</br>  He's almost here!  <br>Lock and Surface.</br>  <br>even closer</br>  <br><br>I've been gone for 2 months and the Pucci meme is further evolving?<br><br>Guess I should have stayed out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gay priest is dead<br><br>Gay cherry is new hotness</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop making it longer.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, I remember now I was just being dumb</br>  <br>He's passing the gates-</br>  <br> Kakyoin the MILF-hunter <br> gay <br>He's bi at most.</br></br></br>  <br>Finally</br>  <br> Not " Gay Priest is here now"  <br>Fuck..after all that build up..</br></br>  why does no one ever talk about part 3 breaking the fourth wall during the wheel of forutne scene? too bad its probably the only one out of the entire jojo family.  <br>But he is here now, he just said finally because it took him a while</br>  <br>Because we already talked about them</br>  <br>you've already posted this with different wording, we dont bother to bring it up because its not important</br>  <br>but its fun, you don't like fun?<br><br><br>damn.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you're right.

And I remember someone telling me that part 5 only has shitty translations, is that still true?</br></br>  <br>Mariah</br>  <br>Rude, she might not be the purest but it's still rude.</br>  <br>that was lewd.</br>  <br>You've got quite a bit before you end so you should enjoy it while you can. Part 5 has a good translation for a few story arcs but the rest is bad. Everything else has a good translation, though.</br>  <br>Don't remind me. I just want to cancer to get away from my favorite character. But it should be a few years, hopefully everyone has grown up by then.</br>  <br> hopefully everyone has grown up by then. <br>You're here on /a/. People come here to not grow up and shitpost. Pucci memes are still only half a year old but if it lasts till next year they're not going away.</br></br>  We all thought this was a girl<br>  for good reason too  </br>  <br> but if it lasts till next year they're not going away. <br>I give it until part 4 is animated, then the thread will be filled with shitty hair and Kira memes.</br></br>  <br>You are on a site, where the opening of a batman movie has been a meme for 4 years now.<br><br>You think Pucciposting is gonna die that easily?</br></br></br>  <br>KABUTOMUSHI is long gone so I'm quite happy about that.</br>  <br>Just maybe. The Heavenposting meme was killed by Pucciposting, so a bigger meme could overshadow it.</br>  Didn't see anyone else post the scanlation by shonengfamez yet.  <br>Has Jojo contributed to baneposting?

I've got a soft spot for King Crimson once I figured out how it works.<br><br>I honestly understand how King Crimson works more than Spice girl.</br></br></br>  The usual range of a revolver or pistol is 50 meters.

Which could explain the healing miracles, at the very least.<br><br>I think it would be kinda funny if all the other miracles were actually battles he had with other stand users. Like, the whole walking on water thing being just him fighting a guy who could make water solid, for example.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone should write this.<br>Redirecting misfortune could be a fun stand to work with, if written correctly. <br>Dont make it god mode, but something more akin to time stop. Exhausting and must be used sparingly.<br><br> Story ends with one final stand battle against Pontius Pilate.  <br> He successfully pins the first jojo to a cross with his stand [NINE INCH NAILS] <br> jesus dies. <br> Ticket To Ride kicks in and redirects his death to Judas three days later.  <br> JoJosus returns to kick ass and save souls. <br> Ticket to Ride becomes god mode at this point and is so strong that he loses his physical form and ascends to [HEAVEN] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yukako yamagishi would be cool</br>  <br>Well then, good news anon.</br>  <br> Dont make it god mode <br><br>You know where you fucked up right?</br></br></br>    <br>just as keikaku</br>  how long until the final bds for stardust crusaders are out<br><br>only then can we have our diamond is unbreakable preview</br></br>  <br>Well what i meant was that it shouldnt be god mode right at the start of the story, otherwise the story is pointless and boring.<br>At the end it could go full Gold Experience Requiem.<br><br>Ticket To Ride<br> Can redirect misfortune, such as moving an injury to another person, moving an illness or death to another person, or creating objects by depriving them of somewhere else. (create hundreds of bread and fish for people, but starve out another village on the other side of the world) <br> The ability is extremely exhausting and must be used sparingly. <br><br>This way in a fight, Jesus couldnt just say "lol im invincible."<br>The fights would go more like "I must hold out a little longer and then take that spear right in the gut. It will hurt like hell but i could send the injury to him afterword. I only have one shot!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming we'll have to wait until Jump Festa or something for a Part IV reveal.

I mean, is Giorno actually constantly cracking jokes in dialogue or something and us english-speakers are left out of the loop? Is he constantly cussing everyone out and rude and everyone hates him but keeps him around for some reason? <br><br>I just struggle to picture a situation in which just changing the text changes Giorno's character as much as you guys keep insisting. <br><br>And don't get me wrong, I like Giorno! I just feel like there's some overselling going on, is all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i love this shit</br>  <br>Doc has a whole album, the ones that are being posted here are probably coming from there hence the filenames.</br>  <br>Doc has a gallery of it<br>http://imgur.com/a/b2Ntd</br></br>  <br>I'm the one that posted those two, and yes they are from Doc's album</br>    Let us all praise Josuke's wonderful hair  <br>From what i understand, part of the style of part five is that all the characters had unique text fonts and styles in their speech bubbles which denoted their accents and attitudes.<br>It was the only part written like this and provided extremely subtle characterization.<br><br>From what I am told Giorno's personality is pretty much good guy DIO. He is authoritative and commanding, while also being quiet and slow to speak. Basically he is supposed to sound suave as hell. <br>This was totally lost in translation, and he comes off as flat just like everyone else. <br><br>Frankly he still sounds boring as hell to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TV-nihon, plz</br>  <br>  not didney worl in gif <br>one job, anon</br></br>  I just tealized Dio's Road Roller fail makes no sense.<br><br>No matter how you look at it, Jotaro seemingly teleported out of there, without Dio noticing. Even if Dio couldn't move he would still percieve stopped time, so it's ridiculous that jotaro could squeeze out from under that thing without Dio noticing.</br></br>  <br>because magical punch ghosts that can stop time in the first place makes sense either way, right?</br>  how  <br><br>The more you think about this stuff, the less sense it's going to make.</br></br>  <br>doesn't matter how weird the basic laws are. How time stops work and how percieving it works is clearly defined.<br><br>Then again they shouldn't have been flying like DBZ either so i guess Araki just said fuck it.<br><br><br>this one's actually possible by previously established things about Crazy Diamond, except for one main disregard of the rule.<br><br>The smaller part pulled in the bigger part, its mentioned to be the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Josuke's hair <br> wonderful <br>pick one</br></br></br>  I thought speedwagon died in the 50s, not in part 2's year<br>mistranslation I guess<br><br>I was going along the lines that okuyasu was fucking dead/disintegrated but i guess RHCP was just dragging his body away</br></br></br>  Stand Name: Salty Dog<br><br>Stand Ability: [Skin Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Skin_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - D<br><br>Range - B<br><br>Durability - A<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: Power to control skin of oneself or others.

However, he's still weaker than Nazarick's level 100 NPCs like Demiurge or Shalltear.<br><br>Doesn't that mean that Nazarick is completely invincible?

He didn't go gallivanting around but when he did deign to do something, you can be sure everyone knew about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Does Ainz ever impregnate her to make the descendant the floor guardians all want?</br></br>  <br>Nazarick has more firepower stored on the 8th floor and the lvl100s aren't the strongest. Strongest is Rubedo, and there's another lvl100 there we don't know yet.<br>Barring all of that, Ainz still has all those World class items and divine weaponry. Its fair to say that everyone is severely outclassed in everyway.</br></br>      <br>What make PDL so powerful isn't pure strength. If it came down to pure strength, the 8 Greed Kings and the 2 Heroes could have taken him down. What PDL lacks in pure power, he makes up for with deviousness. That's what makes him troubling.</br>  At what point will Ainz stop thinking in his human voice and start talking internally as Papa Bones? The final ep of S1?  <br>Overlord plays a very interesting game.<br><br>The volumes are written in a way that there's something big at the end of every volume, and a climax every third volume.<br><br>It's pretty much perfect for an anime adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably never. He keeps being his naive old self until at least volume 7.</br>  Does Ainz ever act on his lust?  <br>I've noticed.<br><br>Vol 3 was  Shallchair  vs  Ainz <br>Vol 6 was  Demiurge  vs  Momon  and  just general Kingdom shenanigans. <br>Vol 9 was  Kingdom massacre. <br><br>Too bad vols 6 and 9 won't ever be animated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Skeleton can't get a boner, so no.</br>  <br>I know, but it looks like it's planned out in a way that will actually sell merchandise.</br>  <br> 2 Heroes <br> Neither are even close to level 100 <br> Taking down PDL <br><br>Fat chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, maybe they could have put up more of a fight if PDL hadn't been, you know, pulling PDL stuff and tricks.</br>  <br>Can you imagine the end of vol 9 animated in all its glory? It would be positively glorious and  orgasmic .</br>  Asking this again.<br><br>Which is better, Funi 1080p or ayy's BS11?<br><br>Just asking since ayy's version has the logo on the top right corner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think two guys at the around the same level as Ivileye could possibly beat a level 100 with a guild weapon stuck on his back and countless other treasures at his disposal?<br><br>PDL is playing for the long term, that doesn't mean he wasn't capable of crushing sub level 70s like bugs. It just wouldn't benefit him since his powers are mostly soul based. <br><br>And if he just comes in and kills the two heroes who are ya know saving the world then he's the bad guy. Why would he want that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Volume 5 still has him thinking like a salaryman. Unfortunately no one in Nazarick has levels in accountant.</br>  <br>Even if he's devious would it even matter? There is no one remotely strong enough to turn against Nazarick, and all npc's swear absolute loyalty to Ainz. His best talent is completely worthless unless he can somehow trick his way into destroying the guild staff or kill Ainz himself with some WC item.</br>  <br>He probably doesn't have it but there's always the branch of tonelico. It allowed a mere goblin to wipe out dragons in one swing.</br>  <br> And if he just comes in and kills the two heroes who are ya know saving the world then he's the bad guy. Why would he want that? <br>But isn't that what happened in the end? Sure, he wasn't the one who personally killed them but he engineered their death. And considering the fact that they had, you know, just helped save the very world he claims to be protecting, he really didn't have to get rid of them unless he was still butthurt from what happened with the Kings. PDL seems like an ass, quite honestly.</br></br>  Are there any gifs or webms of the death knight hacking all those knights to pieces?<br>I was suprised they didn't just all get knocked back.</br>  <br>Could it be that World Class item? The overpowered club?</br>  <br>He also has the Floating City at his disposal. God knows what's going on there. Still might not be enough to take down Nazarick in its full glory but if he were to ally himself with natives from the New World who have relics themselves, well now that would be a different story, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>He IS an ass. That much is obvious. But we don't know whether the rest of the world blames him and that's all that matters to PDL. What's his face, the former blue rose guy who is 260 years old or some shit is his friend, and he's a former 13 hero. Ivileye is also a 'friend' as far as we know.<br><br>So PDL basically won. We don't know how he pulled it off, but he did. And well maybe he really does have a legitimate reason, like given how he's crying about how Yggdrasil magic is merging and changing the world maybe it's the Log Horizon problem where those who use wild magic and can't use Yggdrasil magic will eventually disappear or something. It's really hard to confirm the guy has absolutely no way to justify himself at this point but he's at least Ainz level when it comes to fucking people over for his own benefit.</br></br></br>  <br>That was what I was hinting at, given how Ainz clearly pointed out in Yggdrasil goblins can only reach up to level 50ish, and New World equivalents always seem to be even shittier. I mean dragons were a big deal in Yggdrasil which I believe meant they were raid bosses but maybe Ainz was just over exaggerating.<br><br>But the point is, most of the tales and myths cited over the course of the novels most likely have a bit of truth to them, even if distorted when presented to the reader.</br></br></br>  <br> but he's at least Ainz level when it comes to fucking people over for his own benefit. <br>Ain't that the truth. Anyone thinking because he can't personally match Nazarick power for power means he's any less of a threat is being a smidge bit too optimistic.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah and think about it. In Yggdrasil it's pretty obvious you can't just break someone's guild base by attacking it, otherwise the butthurt 1500 raid would just collapse the tomb from outside where they are safe from Victim. So this meant the tomb was safe from the club presumably.<br><br>What about now? If you have a sufficiently charged world savior is Nazarick gonna survive one swing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Ainz seem to have a feeling of vague recognition when he heard about the floating city? I wonder if it was formerly another top guild base.</br>  <br>It's heavily implied to be a guild base from the game. Don't know if Ainz personally remembers it but I wouldn't be too surprised if he did.</br>  <br>Please comeback!</br>  <br> If you have a sufficiently charged world savior <br>CLIMB.</br></br>  <br>Well his biggest advantage is that he clearly had a lot of time to root his influence and gather more WC items and such.<br><br>On the other hand, Ainz's biggest advantage is like others have said, that his posse is loyal to him. But it's not full proof as proven by not only Shalltear, but Demiurge's misunderstandings and Albedo.<br><br>Being too zealous is also something to manipulate. You don't HAVE to coerce people to betrayal.<br><br>Whether or not the author will allow PDL to one up Demiurge and Ainz though, is of course a totally different story. I mean this is my personal opinion but I don't even think PDL is the final boss. He's more like the mid-game crisis that reveals the big bad or whatever after his death.<br><br>That's only if Overlord is going generic, which so far it kinda hasn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I wouldn't know how he gets it, but sure!  He would tragically fail though cause of reader poll saying FUCK THAT KID KILL HIM </br>  <br>The only thing this guy would really have going for himself, is an alliance of weak demihumans, his own powerful items and those of his allies, and a potentially deadly floating citadel that Ainz doesn't need to assault. Unless this guy lucked out with one of the Twenty, there isn't anything worthwhile he could pull.</br>  <br> Being too zealous is also something to manipulate. You don't HAVE to coerce people to betrayal. <br>You have a really good point there. We've all wondered how the guardians loyalty would ever cause a big enough problem for Ainz.<br><br> I mean this is my personal opinion but I don't even think PDL is the final boss. He's more like the mid-game crisis that reveals the big bad or whatever after his death. <br>What makes you think so? I'm trying to imagine what the stakes would be for a "bigger bad" than PDL.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Don't forget Ourobouros or whatever is hinted at being in the new world as well. What are the chances that every creature in the world somehow managed to eat this 'translation konjac' nonsense so their descendents could gain the ability? Like how would that even work for the underwater races? Does Santa Claus exist in this world or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Well he can actually lose his cool even with his racial suppression, like when Shalltear was mind-controlled, he was so angry that every time his anger got suppressed he just got angry again</br>  <br>Do the Japs even like him?</br>  <br>If anything I kind of feel that it was used to create the special skill system used by warriors. The universal language idea makes a lot of sense too though.</br>  <br>I have a few reasons and none of them are good so feel free to bash them.<br><br> The author stated that Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL <br> All the build up towards the guild members and AInz's goal of reuniting with them gives a possibility to one of them being on an alt account, or one of the 2 people who didn't retire (we know Herohero was logged off at the guild base so he can't have snuck off even if he tried and it would be shit writing if it was him) and that's not even going into Touch Me/Ulbert or even Tabula making alts because REASONS <br> Brain gains Gazef's items, and Brain was always the more talented and now has more drive than he ever did presumably, though since I have no idea what happens to him precisely in vol 9 yet this is a shitty one and for all I know he's just a future opponent for Lizard Guy <br> I believe someone translated in a previous thread the shitty map and it showed the Holy Empire being way the fuck apart from the Baharuth Empire / Silian Theocracy / Re-Estize Kingdom so them housing a bunch of players and popping up outta nowhere is possible assuming the post was right <br> We've seen the giant ass level 85 tree and it was implied that 7 people, possibly an early group of the 13 heroes could barely beat one of it's branches; this dumb tree is from Yggdrasil so why can't a world boss have popped up somewhere? <br> Albedo / Spinel can always work as well, hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I figured it was used twice, assuming that once it was used it respawned in the New World as opposed to going back to Yggdrasil ya know? It doesn't have to be used by the same party after all.<br><br><br>I have no idea, but based on the current fatality rate it's better not to bet on survival.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Strongest is Rubedo, and there's another lvl100 there we don't know yet. <br>The last lvl100 is the area guardian of the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary on the 8th floor. The brief glimpse we get of her in the novels suggests that she's a miko. You can kind of see her to the left of Shalltear in pic related.<br>It's likely that she is Rubedo, which is why Ainz is willing to entrust the protection of the guild staff to her.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The author stated that Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL <br>That seems quite reasonable. Depends on how the author would frame the new conflict. Presumably after Ainz meets up and has a talk with PDL in a "Oh hey, guess what. You thought I was the bad guy, well here's someone worse than me" sort of way.<br><br>Is it possible that the unnatural presence of people from Yggdrasil cause the world itself to spawn stronger demihumans?<br><br> All the build up towards the guild members and AInz's goal of reuniting with them gives a possibility to one of them being on an alt account, or one of the 2 people who didn't retire (we know Herohero was logged off at the guild base so he can't have snuck off even if he tried and it would be shit writing if it was him) and that's not even going into Touch Me/Ulbert or even Tabula making alts because REASONS <br>REASONS would have to be pretty damn good for this to be plausible.<br><br> Brain gains Gazef's items, and Brain was always the more talented and now has more drive than he ever did presumably, though since I have no idea what happens to him precisely in vol 9 yet this is a shitty one and for all I know he's just a future opponent for Lizard Guy <br>Watch as Brain loses to Lizard Guy and goes back into his depression.<br> I believe someone translated in a previous thread the shitty map and it showed the Holy Empire being way the fuck apart from the Baharuth Empire / Silian Theocracy / Re-Estize Kingdom so them housing a bunch of players and popping up outta nowhere is possible assuming the post was right <br>Highly possible. There HAS to be players in the present. Like I'm positive (for which I have absolutely no basis)<br> We've seen the giant ass level 85 tree and it was implied that 7 people, possibly an early group of the 13 heroes could barely beat one of it's branches; this dumb tree is from Yggdrasil so why can't a world boss have popped up somewhere? <br>True.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS <br>Oh god yes<br> "World Items? Who do you think it was that you met in the treasury? Pandora's Actor swore loyalty to me long ago. Don't you think its strange that you haven't activated a single World class item yet? I have all of them within my beak. You can leave this Nazarick of mine... Satoru-san." </br></br></br>  <br><br> Albedo / Spinel can always work as well, hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS <br>The BIGGEST BAD was here all along.</br></br></br>  <br> Pandora's Actor swore loyalty to me long ago <br><br>OVER THE FUCKING LINE</br></br></br>  <br>They haven't talked much about the demi-human lands. Maybe they are all Gazef level and are just too far away now to give a fuck and will give Ainz a real run for his money.</br>    <br><br>Yeah, not cool, man.<br> Implying PA would ever EVER betray his creator. <br> I hope to hell it never happens. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I know its not albedo's sister but it would be pretty trippy if she was.</br>  <br>Also if you wanna go add in ALL the crazy theories, we have<br><br> Test run implying she's an automaton, therefore it's a ROBO MIKO <br> Automaton also means possibility of using Caloric Stone as a core or possibly crafting it as her body making her a world class NPC <br><br>I mean I doubt these are true, but it would explain why she's just that much better than the rest of the guardians.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone has to carry Penguin around.<br><br>Oh boy more meido the better son</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like they have a whole other purpose that the author's going to introduce after this whole thing with PDL's settled.</br>  <br> (for which I have absolutely no basis) <br>Its pretty reasonable. I mean with how popular Yggdrasil was, and having been around for 12 years, there had to have been dozens of players hanging around for the very last day of the game. Heck, I can imagine whole guilds partying it up in game one last time. Plus people who havn't played in ages coming back just for the novelty of the last day of the game.</br></br>  You're all thinking up of crazy and grand shit but I personally think the biggest conflict here is the simplest one.<br><br>None of the speculated potential final bosses in the story posed any real threat to Nazarick. They merely serve as vehicles to further advance Ainz as a character.<br>The big bad Ainz has to face at the very end is himself. That is, a larger than life introspection summing up his entire journey so far and the genuinely final conclusion and realization he'll reach at the end of the story</br></br></br>  <br> REASONS would have to be pretty damn good for this to be plausible. <br><br>Personally I wouldn't even mind if he never meets any of his old guildies. I'm just saying Chekhov's gun might come into play. I might be slightly more accurate with my shitty theories if we had a rough estimate of how long this series has left from the author but at this point it could end in the next 2 volumes or it could be the next Raildex.<br><br><br> Eclaire was actually just an alt account that faked being an NPC all this time <br>Code Geass R2 has a new challenger!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but has it really been 12? I thought the novels said it was 10 years but I could always have just remembered it wrong.</br>  <br><br>Damn anon.</br></br>  <br> big bad was Ainz all along. <br>How horrifying.  I like it. </br></br>  <br>And then what? Does he  commit sudoku? </br>  <br>Frame this up. We might just be calling you a precog in the future.</br>  <br>And so the story ended.<br>Not with a bang.<br>But with a whimper.</br></br></br>  <br> He wakes up and discovers it was all a dream and he has to wake up at 4am and go to work. <br>Shitty ending, here we come.</br></br>  <br>W-wow.</br>  <br>The adventurer who got the  potion  has a name.  Brita, I think. </br>  <br> Overlord was a psychological case study all along <br><br>AS DEEP AS THE MARIANA'S TRENCH<br> But seriously, I like that idea. </br></br></br></br>  <br> He wakes up and finds out that the shutdown of Yggdrasil was all just a part of his dream, and he gets a message from Touch Me telling him to hurry up and get online so they can try out a new dungeon raid that was added. </br>  <br>Don't you jinx the novel, take that shit back.</br>  <br>"I want to present you who I love with the world like this jewelry box and me..."</br>  <br>Better but still shitty as long as there's someone dreaming.</br>  <br>Anyone else notice that there's someone right under Ainz, with the ghost arms.</br>  <br> Series ends with Ainz dramatically putting the entire world to the torch <br> Momon appears out of nowhere while all the npcs are shackled <br> Momon stabs Ainz with a club and saves everyone becoming the   world savior <br> The world begins peace talks and all factions try to get along <br> Area 11 err I mean the Kingdom finally gets out of the shit hole it's in while Marquis Raven bangs Lupusregina Beta who finally regained her memory <br> Albedo and Shalltear are seen in the epilogue laying on a cart of hay being pulled by horse, with a mysterious driver dressed as a salary man at the front </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I'm sorry. I take it back. I TAKE IT ALL BACK.</br>    <br><br>In a way, it makes sense doesn't it? Shit's crazy but it actually makes a lot of sense.<br> As long as it's not the dream TWEEST <br> Also we need a Disappearance-esque confrontation between Satoru human and Ainz lich. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If Ainz ever regained his humanity somehow I could definitely see this happen. I'm not sure how he would cope with all that torture and murder. Maybe he would go defeat Nazarick himself.</br>  Would it be possible for Ainz's npc to take his form and take over the tomb from the inside?  The final fight will be Ainz invading and defeating Nazerick himself. There is a no more difficult final boss out there. What could possibly be harder than the legendary dungeon that repelled 1500 players? Nothing. Therefore, if he truly means to make the impossible possible, that is what he needs to do.<br><br>that said, I don't know why exactly he would need to do that, but it's the only final fight that truly lives up to the hype.</br></br>  <br>Start scrounging for clubs?</br>  <br>Capping this for posterity.<br><br>Let's see just how right you are, anon.  Fuck. Now I'm going to be sorely disappointed if anything but this happens as the finale. </br></br></br>  <br>The guardians can automatically tell Ainz's presence when they see him. Even Pandora's Actor can't fool them.</br>  <br> we need a Disappearance-esque confrontation between Satoru human and Ainz lich <br><br>THIS<br><br>FUND IT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was because of his intimidating skeleton aura passive.</br>  <br>Why does it make me sad that this sounds like the most plausible theory here?</br>  <br> Overlord ends when Ainz finds a super world item completely original to the new world, it grants someones true heart desire, un-restricted, un-restrained <br> Ainz is sent to an alternate Earth, exactly the same as the old one, only Yggdrasil never shuts down, and all his friends never abandon him <br> Also he encounters a bunch of newbies in the game who are heavily hinted to be human versions of all the Floor Guardians, who quickly warm up to him and wanna be friends. </br></br></br>  <br>do you happen to have the picture of that translated map?</br>  <br> the newbies are the actual children of his friends <br> shalltear and albedo still want his dick </br></br>  Posting translations of the text on these pictures.<br><br>"The Three Poiints: Sexy x Skeleton x Action"</br></br>  <br>It's not translated, it was a phone quality picture, and someone in a previous thread posted it and translated the names for us. I'm not even sure he was the original source, might have just got it off a forum or something.<br><br>Take it with a grain of salt as always.</br></br></br>  <br>No, the narrative placed it on that all 41 would have "special aura" to them, that they don't notice it themselves. Iirc at least.</br>  "Is it true I can knead breasts if I become an overlord?"  <br> kneading padding </br>  <br><br>The most human character in the story all along was the grand skeleton god deified and feared by all.<br><br>Doesn't that sound romantic as fuck? It makes for good storytelling.</br></br></br></br>  Wow look how much less shitposting there is when you don't start a thread with a bait for the OP.  <br>You clearly won the thread, so answer the real question  what happens in the epilogue? </br>    <br>10/10</br>  <br>There's no escaping your fate Ainz.</br>  <br>But will it be the human inside us or outside of our skeleton carriage? And PoV matters, will it be from Papa Bones or from the outside?</br>   /a/ in charge of writing endings <br><br>Oh fuck off /a/. I didn't want to get depressed today.<br>I just want Papa Bones to be happy.  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Well he could always get on a boat or something with his npcs.</br>  <br>Nice boat, Overlord edition.</br>  <br> Ainz's desperation to find his friends is his attempt at holding on to his humanity.  <br>Once he acknowledges that he will never find his friends, he will truly lose his humanity.</br></br>  <br>And they lived happily ever after.  But still got off before Guts. </br>  <br> not HungryChair.jpg </br>  <br>Fuck that. Infighting between personalities never ends well. Play the mediocre Tales of Symphonia spinoff if you want that shit.<br><br> With no enemies left to focus his attention, Ainz remembers that he should be appalled if not for his undead apathy and, lest he start committing senseless atrocities, figures out how to summon Touch Me to the world to defeat him and take back the guild./spoiler]<br><br> Lunatic mode: it was actually Pandora's Actor, and Ainz used one of the world-class items in the treasury to become a more respectable monster species and elope with Albedo. </br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>i love his running animations, he's like welp bye</br>  <br> yfw the first food Ainz gets to taste again is cheap ass Japanese ramen </br>  <br> Implying they won't have space ramen by then </br>  <br>I was a little disappointed. He just starts sprinting off instead of darting away like a fucking train. Come on animators.</br>  <br>I don't know, it's elegant in its own way. Like the tide washing away a bunch of fleshy sandcastles. No rush.</br>  Still waiting for that PV.  <br>Later today.</br>  <br>Well, I just imagined him as a screaming nightmare rushing around at the speed of sound. His roar was really weak and his murder-run was underwhelming. The slaughter was fun, but I expected his intro to have more umph. If it was drawn instead of CGI'd it probably would have run like I expected.</br>  Are you guys fucking ready for BLACK HOLE?  <br>Agreed. For some reason I always thought it was night or at least dusk during the attack. Made it a lot more menacing in my head. <br><br>His shield bashes definitely should have vaporized, if not dismembered the bodies.</br></br></br>  So, why did this turn into cute girls doing kitchen things all of a sudden?  Not that I complain   Reposting if anyone missed it.  Which one would you kitchen?  <br>As if there's any other option.</br>  <br>Because it's their last majo bit of screentime before Hibiki lets them all die next episode.</br>  <br>you truly are a man of refined taste, anon</br>  <br> tfw can't waifu2x it </br>  Symphogear SoL OVA, Drama CD, 4koma spinoff series when?  <br>We do have a SoL OVA though.</br>  <br> Symphogear SoL OVA <br>We got those for G</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure he means something more than a bunch of 30-second shorts.</br></br>    <br> hey let's make kirake's transformation scene BTFO every other scene in terms of quality and animation budget <br> and not show shirabes at all because she's shit <br> kekkekekkek </br></br></br>  Well, this tasted surprisingly good.

For aesthetic purposes.</br>  <br>Ask Carol</br>  <br>I want to bully Carol by asking detailed questions about the sexual anatomy of her dolls and homunculi.</br>  <br>She has to get energy from somewhere so I'm sure Carol made a practical butthole for her. Although without genitals I imagine she's like a bird in that she poops and pees at the same time from her ass.</br>  <br>Is Carol the most bullyable character in anime history?</br>  <br>Rip the Hibiki CD in lossless, since the Japanese apparently can't do it</br>  <br>She's pretty close.</br>  <br>It's part of the source of his power, he just doesn't tell anyone that bit. He's a level 38 Muscle Wizard.</br>  <br>Is it really bullying? She's going to give you autistically straight answers explaining the mechanics behind the creation. <br><br>The real way to bully her is to "overly compliment her ability to create dolls and how perfect they are"<br>She seems the type that would falter under heavy compliments.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I second this.</br></br>  <br>Gets embarrassing quick when you build homunculi based on your own body.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>I want to non-sexually rub Elfnine's thighs</br>  <br>If she's really just going to Tsukkomi me then I'd change up my tactics, get lewder with my questions or if all fails then just cum on her hat.<br><br>But I don't see how she wouldn't just give you autistically straight responses too, maybe too full of herself to say anything other than 'of course they are, I made them'.<br><br>Either way, I just need her to be bullied.<br><br><br>I would only bully Doublas with my dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>I want to platonically thrust my tongue into Elf9's navel.</br>  <br>I need more.</br>  I want to hug Carol until she starts crying and lets out all her anger and frustration, and doesn't want to hurt people anymore.  <br>Hibiki pls.</br>  <br>You're the one that needs to be hugged, Bikkie.</br>  <br><br>Miku please.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully, never.<br><br>Look at how bad it turned out for Nanoha.</br></br></br>  Not long now until best girl murders all of Hibiki's friends.  <br>I want to permanently rob Hibiki of her smile</br>  <br>i cant wait, this show needs to get good somehow</br>  <br>If they kill Anime Girl, we riot.</br>  <br> mfw mine's still stuck in customs </br>  <br>YOU SHUT UP!</br>  Anyone got a webm (or mp4) with sound of the entire Radiant Force scene, starting with the girls jumping out of the missile in space and ending with the epic suplex?  <br>I would kill for a Nanoha middle school/high school SoL anime series, fuck you.</br>  <br>The 4-koma Nanoha manga is funny, some of the Drama CDs are awesome and Innocent (the SoL manga) is great.<br>I don't see the problem with Symphogear having those quality spin-off, just add a game and it is perfect.</br></br>  <br>I honestly dropped all when Nanoha stopped being about Nanoha.</br>  <br>When was that?<br>Because aside from Vivid, everything has been pretty Nanoha.</br></br>  <br>After StrikerS. Too many new characters with constant focus, so little Nanoha.</br>  <br>Nanoha Force exists.</br>  <br> Beef stroganoff was just a death flag <br><br>No, please no.</br></br></br>  <br>That thing isn't canon anymore. It's cancelled, I hope at least.</br>  <br> It doesn't have to be beef </br>  <br><br>So next ep we get dolls singing Beef Stroganoff song while making it out of girls' bodies?</br></br>   bought Galaxy Cross super late <br> still got the card <br>Jackpot. Thought that was a first print, unless I was mistaken.</br></br>  <br>What do they say?</br>  <br>Pleasure of being fisted inside</br>  <br>Maria &amp; Tsubasa's card says I LOVE YOU.<br>Hibiki's card comments on the wild arms whistling.</br></br>  <br> tfw will have all these in storage in japan waiting to be shipped. </br>  <br>I want to see her try to kiss someone and end up slobbering all over them like a dog</br>  <br>Your guess is as good as mine. Looks like Galaxy Cross has some effect that boosts it's number; cause 500 is super low.</br>  <br>Its an assist obviously</br>  <br>Left is assist with some other effect. Right is probably +1000 during your turn or opponent's turn.</br>  <br>I don't know anything about this card game.</br>  <br> is there a source for this or is it just fanart? </br>  <br>one of the artists was drawing too many lolis and it carried over.</br>  <br>Its from the second G OVA.</br>  <br>derp, made a mistake when seeing which post was being replied to</br>  <br>A little more push and Tsubasa can motorboat those Marias.</br>  <br> 白皙の少女 マリア&amp;翼 <br>Girls of white Maria&amp;Tsubasa<br> みなぎる闘志 響 <br>Full of fighting spirit Hibiki</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everytime I glance at that image I think Maria is cradling Tsubasa's head because of that line of flowers.</br>  <br> suddenly it's a slice of life musical <br><br>It was a little jarring, but if they keep it up through the season, I'm okay with it.</br></br></br>  <br>The whole series should just be one big musical</br>  <br> one big musical <br>Hopefully the movie will be.</br></br>  Anyone else think Chris's singing voice is absolutely terrible? It sucks they made her sing the EDs.  <br>Less pleb than me. I heard it in 2010 in a certain NDS game OP.</br>  <br>No, Ayahi is a pretty good singer.</br>  <br>Shit do you even watch anime?</br>   Kirika and Shirabe will never kiss like this <br><br>why god</br></br>  <br>The tongue is what makes my dick hard.</br>  <br>I do. But the anime that I watch didn't have Mizuki Nana in it.</br>  <br>What are you, anon?<br>Now I have boner another time thanks to the scene.<br>I don't even know how many times has it been.<br><br>And Symphogear will never be that lewd.<br>Holding hands is the lewdest the gears will get.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not too bad but preferred a different person singing the ED for GX. Too tired of her voice</br>  <br>Hibiki and Miku in bed together in season one and the FIS girls showering together in season 2 was way more lewd than holding hands.</br>  <br>Yeah, maybe have Nanjo or Aoi sing it next time.</br>  <br>Hibiku and Miku scene was gay, not lewd.<br><br>The shower scene was definitely more lewd than holding hands, my bad.</br></br></br>  <br>All the gears sing while all the dolls dance. Haruhi style ED.<br><br>They were barely wearing any clothes though.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he means that Ayahi singing in character is a problem.</br>  <br> next time <br>Just how many seasons do you think this can get? If shit doesn't ends here and they don't expand it with movies/OVAs, then I don't know anymore.</br></br>  <br>Thank god, that's just too much.<br><br>It's okay in Prisma Illya since they just exist to be fanservice loli sluts but the Geahs are pure.</br></br></br>  <br>Bikki's card gains +1000 when the opponent has less than 3 characters</br>  <br>But she doesn't sing the EDs in character.</br>  <br>I know it is an unpopular opinion, but I would like if next season Nanjo did the ED.<br><br><br>They thought the same of Nanoha back when in aired and look now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ViVid was absolutely awful, though.</br>  <br>Nigga fuck your purity. I want two girls that actually love each other kissing like this. Two cute girls like DMJii would be so much better than the onii-chan cock-craving sluts in Prisma Illya.</br>  <br>You already had Sakura Trick but you fags didn't appreciate it. It's literally impossible to satisfy yurifags.</br>  <br>Aoi can't sing for shit</br>    <br>I'm not talking only about ViVid which the manga is like a watered down Prisma.<br>I'm talking about everything the franchise has spammed, and everything is mostly good.<br><br>Symphogear could have season four without any problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But could it get a fifth season?</br>  <br>The fifth one will be a game.</br>  <br>The third season is beginning better than the other based on the CDs sales, and the Symphogear Live has been updated to be a bigger event.<br><br>Depending on the trend, a fifth season should be possible, but risky. <br>A movie is more probable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>whoa wait what the fuck<br>I don't remember this shit</br></br>  <br>But the kissing in Sakura tricked sucked balls. No saliva, tongues were drawn half-assed, no smooch sounds, etc.</br>  <br>But </br>  <br>At least they were actually in love. The only problem with Sakura Trick is that these two haven't kissed yet. They are getting there though.</br>  <br> No saliva <br>But there was, just until the last episodes.<br><br> tongues were drawn half-assed <br>I thought they were cute. Prisma's tongues are gross to be honest.<br><br> no smooch sounds <br>But they were. This was literally the thing that was hyped the most before the anime since the VA confirmed some weeks before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She might not have technical skill but she makes up for it with heart, and that's pretty fucking important in a medium intended to convey and induce emotion.</br>  Wait are there people who watch Symphogear for the yuri? Seriously?  <br>There are people who watch literally everything for yuri.</br>  <br>Sakura Trick lures you in with sweet yuri kisses but then you realize that the whole thing is completely devoid of anything beyond that. It's a cruel joke.</br>  <br>Is there another reason too?</br>  <br>Not really. It's a SoL with cute characters that sometimes kiss.</br>  <br>I watch it for the yuri, the baddassness and the songs.</br>  <br> The kissing in ST was fine. The problem with ST is that the plot is melodrama and characterization is terrible to prevent relationship advancement. <br><br>This is also a bit off topic, even if post quality won't be very good anyways the day before an episode.</br></br></br>  <br> sometimes kiss <br> sometimes </br></br>  <br>I don't think there are actually people that see it for yuri.<br>Still, you need to be at least tolerant with yuri to see Symphogear or be in a strong denial that every girl is straight.</br></br>  <br>You can watch it for other reasons and still wish for more yuri in it at the same time. The hot blooded fighting, singing, and even lewdness have all been arguably improved through each season, yet yuri level is the only thing that stays the same.</br>  <br> lures you in with sweet yuri kisses but then you realize that the whole thing is completely devoid of anything beyond that. <br>That's literally what yuri is</br></br>  <br>What if you don't give the slightest shit about the sexual orientation of characters in a show that's obviously never going to have any actual romantic development?</br>  <br>Some of the characters haven't even kissed yet.</br>  <br>Can confirm. I actually drop shows when a cute girl shows signs of heterosexuality, specially when it wasn't stated since the beginning and it's moeshit.<br><br>I already dropped Gakkou Gurashi this season.</br></br></br>  <br>Then that means you are tolerant with yuri.</br>  <br>The only hetero girl dies though.</br>  <br>I don't care. I can't stand hetero in the main cast.</br>  <br>The only way Symphogear could get any gayer would be an on screen confession or kiss.</br>  <br>You sound like a real faggot, anon.</br>  So Hibiki's CD bonus from CDJapan was a random screenshot of her. Knowing this, I'm 100% certain Kirika's will be Kirika Yuusha  <br>They can go even as far as 10 seasons as long as the CD sold well.</br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br> I can't stand hetero in the main cast <br>Does Chris being a former sex slave trigger you?</br></br>  <br>Not really because she isn't one of my favorites, also because she didn't do it willingly.</br>  So will CR (badly) sub the songs tomorrow or not?   anons starting to get Hibiki's charasong CDs <br>Will we finally get lossless rips</br>  <br>I'd settle for a "fade in black" or "pan to the background" kind of kiss.</br>  <br>Within the time it takes to make all 10 seasons, we'll have a few movies and games. Also new character songs, singles, an OVA and a live for every season.<br>My body is ready.</br></br>  <br> games <br>I need a Symphogear game. Fighting game, brawler, beat 'em up, rhythm game, anything  just please not a JRPG .</br></br>  <br>*teleports behind you*<br>*unsheats beef stroganoff*<br>"Anime ja nai, dolly"</br></br></br>  <br>What about a brawler rhythm game.</br>  <br>Character Action game based on Rhythm would be great.</br>  <br>That would be fine, and I'd actually be very interested to see how it plays. If they got a decent developer behind it it could turn into something amazing</br>  <br>I would love a fighting game where meter build or something was based off the rhythm of your moves or some crazy stuff like that. <br><br>But an action game would be pretty cool too</br></br></br>  HI <br>BI<br>KE<br>KI<br>ZU<br>NA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NEGAI TO TOMO NIIIIIIIIII</br>   DAIJOBU   <br><br><br><br>Seeing as we'd need a  little  miracle to get more than one game, I really hope Kaneko would realize the need to go all out in the first one and have EVERYONE playable. Genjuuro, MikuGeah, Kanade, Maria in both Airgetlam and Gungnir, hell, maybe even Ver riding Nephilim for shiggles.</br></br></br></br>  Was there going to be a delay again this week or will it be normal time?  <br>15 minutes late.</br>  <br>The episode where chris and tsubasa were fighting in season 2</br>  <br>Need sponsors. <br>Agematsu said he wants a Symphogear fighting game though.</br></br>   Can someone list all of the soundtracks that are piano versions of the inserts? I just found out the last track of G OST 2 is Monochrome Classroom   <br>To be honest, I think a fighting game (either 2D like Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat/etc or 2.5D like JJBA: Allstar Battle) would probably be the best combination of easy-to-make and fun-to-play. A good art style that mixes 2D art frames for characters with 3D models for weapon consistency a la Skullgirls would be quite nice.<br><br> Captcha: Select all the pick-up trucks <br>Bastards are getting creative</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the store bonuses for the CDs are printed screenshots from the show. Each one gets a different screenshot assigned to them as their bonus.</br>  <br>What about making it a hack-and-slash game like Gauntlet?</br>  <br>While I'd personally prefer a hack-and-slash, it would be more difficult as that would require much more modeling. Modeling characters, environments, attacks, etc. A 2D fighter could be drawn art frames for all character movement as opposed to having to model, rig, and animate everything, as well as having 2D art backgrounds instead of modeled environments.<br><br>Having a good fighting game engine would be difficult, but so would a good hack-and-slash engine, and it would be dramatically less difficult in the visuals department.</br></br></br>   Symphogear game <br> Evangelion sound impact with geahs <br>Please no.</br></br>  <br>Well, Nanoha pulled off a fighting game decently enough, so I don't see why Symphogear wouldn't be able to...........aside from how to implement the singing.</br>  Ar tonelico vs Symphogear game when? It's the same thing basically, just change Nana to Shikata  <br>You could honestly do a more unique hack-and-slash with singing.<br>Like attacks only available when you follow certain rhythm and action scenes where you have to press buttons according to the beat.</br></br>  <br>So Patapon?</br>  <br> special attack bar charges as you fight <br> when the bar is charged enough you can start singing (BGM changes completely to character song)  <br> while your character is singing you get all sorts of special bonuses like extra damage, extra defense, new attacks, but these vary from character to character </br></br></br>  <br>My information about the game comes from a trailer I just saw in youtube, but it didn't seem action heavy, it seemed slow paced and somewhat boring to be sincere.<br><br>Symphogear needs a fast fighting game.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Singing would be a lot easier to implement in a hack-and-slash or beat 'em up than a 2D fighting game, yeah, unless all the characters had a 'super mode' activated by singing or something. Which, again, would be much easier to implement in a beat 'em up.<br><br> Absolute dream would be a P* game, but P* doesn't do well with multiple player characters and you'd need to have at LEAST six playable characters, ideally nine or even ten </br></br></br></br>  <br>Never played Ar Tonelico, in what way it is similar to Symphogear?<br><br>Also, I would prefer a duet between Shikata and Nana instead of changing one of them.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems that way to the one watching the game, playing it is a different story.</br>  <br><br>I don't know why that artist gave her a snaggletooth</br></br>  <br>Fangs are cute I suppose.</br>  <br>It's a rpg with a main system based on song magic.<br>The second one even have a rythn based defense system</br></br>  <br><br>Fang moe is great.<br>We really need a fang geah.</br></br></br>  <br>it's like a goddamn moe lamprey</br>  <br>Sounds like the perfect Symphogear RPG.<br><br>When will they make a game?<br>I'm sure it will sell, just add a song for character and one more of Nana and you are good to go.</br></br></br></br>  13 hours until broadcast  We're almost 4 episodes in and still no  JAM .<br>When are we getting  JAM ?</br>  <br>Part of me secretly hopes  we never get it.  It'll happen eventually (probably by or in episode 7), and I know this is confirmed to be the season of suffering, but part of me hopes vainly it won't happen.</br>  <br>Sauce &gt; Jam</br>  <br>For a second I read it as Space Jam.</br>  <br>I don't mind the suffering. It just makes the cool moments sweeter.</br>  So is the final attack going to be Exterminate or Glorious Break?<br><br>What is Glorious Break anyway?</br></br>  <br>Glorious Break is the ED of episode 1.</br>  <br>Both, plus another third one, since I believe Glorious Break doesn't have FIS.</br>  <br>Glorious Break is Nanas last battle song.</br>  <br>Die in magma.</br>  <br>What.<br><br>Are you confusing Glorious Break and Radiant Force?</br></br></br>  <br>Sup Tsunako?</br>  <br>G has two versions of Hidamari Memoria (Miku's chara song) in CD4, including one playing during the battle intro of Mikugeah.<br><br>The others usually have the name of the original inside, if I remember correctly.</br></br></br>  <br>Sauce Jam</br>  <br>Yes, yes I am. My bad.</br>  I like how they're wearing Leuir's ugly chastity belt thing.  <br><br>If Noise ever had any dignity it is now completely gone.</br></br>  <br>When they find Fine's test symphogear relic which was made from a piece of Baba Yaga's cooking stove, then Anime-chan finds it and accidentally transforms when she sings the beef stroganoff song. Jam ensues and a new hero is born.</br>  On the note of Fine:<br> Fine’s descendants exist throughout the world, and a new Fine will be born if any should come in contact with the aufwachen wave pattern that emits from an awakening relic. She can continue to exist as long as those opportunities continue to occur. <br><br> It is not clear how much is left up to “chance” in the likelihood of this event actually occurring, but Fine continues to exist with an eternal moment regardless.  <br><br>The possibility of her returning is always given.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of Fine.<br>It seems stupid that a new Fine would have the memories of a previously awakened Fine.<br>Like Shirabe-Fine had the memories of Ryoko-Fine.<br><br>That doesn't make sense, unless Shirabe is a descendant of Ryoko, which she isn't.<br>Shouldn't it be a blank slate every time?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if she did, wouldn't she just watch from the sidelines again and we'd never know she's there?</br>  <br>Nigga it's fucking magic I ain't gotta explain shit</br>  VER VER VER<br>VER VER VER</br>  Do we have a webm of beef stroganoff with sound yet? A look through the archive proved unhelpful, though possibly I just need to git gud.  <br>check worksafe gif archive. There was a thread about 3 days ago that had the original and a slowed down version of the song played over someone actually making beef stroganoff. The latter was called slow cooked or something to that effect</br>  <br>What about one of the entire Radiant Force scene, from the girls jumping out of the missile to the suplex?</br>  <br>I imagine Fine to be some kind of omnipresent spirit that usually lies dormant until another vessel awakens which the spirit then occupies. Thus she can have all experiences and memories of all past existences.<br><br><br>Good question. There's still that ominous slit eye in the OP and it's most likely Carol's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea but its worth checking wsg for. Their anime threads usually have stuff</br>  <br>I'm still hoping that it actually belongs to secret weapon Carol's got hidden away, voiced by Yukari Tamura.</br>  <br> Carol's <br> not Eruerufu's <br>Homunculi need souls.<br>Carol let her infiltrate S.O.N.G in order to hear an aufwachen pattern and awaken as Fine,  her mother .<br><br>Keikaku doori.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just waiting for him to comically pop up out of nowhere when they start talking about LiNKER.</br>  <br><br>Okay, wait, what if Carol is indeed a vessel of Fine but she hasn't awakened yet. Then at some point later they awaken Deinsleif and its Aufwachen pattern awakens Fine in Carol and erases Carol. That would be a twist worthy of Symphogear.</br></br>  <br>I already checked there and couldn't find any of the full scene.</br>  <br>Didn't the blow from Igalima kill her off, though?</br>  <br>the  jam  is waiting for it's glorious return</br>  <br><br>Since I still don't understand why Carol and Leiur let Elfnein get away that easily something like that will probably happen.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully he's still in completely crazy mode.</br>  Symphogear shifts from SERIOUS to OH GOD CUTE SCHOOL SLICE OF LIFE in the fastest and most weird ways.  Is this show big with the incest teasing and pandering?<br><br>All of the porn I've seen is brother x sister. Hard to tell if that's got a basis in the series or if it's just siscons being siscons though.</br></br>  <br>Losing it is worse. Watching the sisters who raised you turn into people you don't even know is terrible.</br>  <br>I don't think Masaki will get Miyuki but Miyuki won't get Tatsuya either.</br>  <br>No, you don't think that, it's impossible for anyone to actually think that without being mentally challenged. You hope for that. But we all know that, that's how it's going to end up at this point. Tatsuya and Miyuki will end up together, and if you actually had to bet something of worth to you on it, you'd say that as well.</br>  <br>This is more delusional than any ship considering Tatsuya overall.</br>  <br>Don't be an idiot. Mahouka isn't topping and 15 has more sales than 16. <br><br>http://aramajapan.com/news/otaku/ma<wbr>nga-and-light-novel-sales-rankings-<wbr>for-the-first-half-of-2015/19176/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  You wouldnt sexualize a Chinese Neptune right?  <br>a shit</br>  <br>Awful taste.</br>  So are you going to give the name of the game so we can go download it and play it or what  fucking chinese, that looks like shit. keep your god damn hands off of neptune  <br><br>My heart aches when I see Nep bully Noire in the game. She deserves someone to hold her hand and tell her it's going to be all right.</br></br>  So now that the dust has settled can we all agree that Kyouko won the Sayakab owl?  Isn't Kyouko pretty much a psychopath?  <br>I found mine a few times. My sis drank them all.<br><br>Go to Japan.<br><br><br>A lovable ex-psychopath.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Since this is the only active Madoka thread let's get some Homu going.    This is the anime of the century. Ive watched every anime of this season and none come close to this. It has plot, prostitutes, twilight, sexy black girls, one eyed bad ass, deaf bad ass.<br><br>Why arent you watching the anime of our generation? Why...?</br></br>  <br>Do you have one for the bot making Rokka no Yuusha threads too?<br><br>/a/ is such a miserable sight these days</br></br></br>  <br>I like it but in my opinion its a 6/10. Something to watch to spend the time.</br>  le manime  I liked it until all the power level bullshit and people flying in the air DBZ style.  Has Daiz confirm that he's dropping it? Should I swallow it and watch Funi instead?   Precure Thread   <br>I hate you.</br>  <br><br> The dead thread is finally about to 404 <br><br> LET ME BUMP IT </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we should just get this thing to 500.</br>  <br>There are only 10 more posts to go, I believe we can make it.</br>  <br>PRECURE WILL NEVER DIE</br></blockquote>]
