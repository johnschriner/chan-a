It's okay.<br>But I have question. Will MC have more based moments?</br></br>    <br>The days ago when Charlotte debuted. This has had like twice as many posts at least, though.</br>  <br>He will be a huge Beta but the girls will get better every episode. Specially Mia will get funnier and Cerea will also be great.</br>  <br>I love you, tentacle witch!</br>  <br>Horsefucker</br>  <br>On a scale of 1 to Orgasm how did you guys enjoy this episode?</br>   Darling <br> beta </br>     you'll never know the joys of horse pussy    You will never have a centaur daughteru   <br>~1.25 hours of light edging with some breaks included</br>  <br>That makes me sad</br>  <br>Thank God, that would mean I'd be a pony fucker.</br>  <br>Someone doesn't browse enough</br>  <br> Projected episodes:(At the rate of 2 issues per episode) <br><br> Episode 2: Papi and Cerea introduced <br> Episode 3: Bath time with the girls and FULL MOON <br> Episode 4: Miia's deadly cooking and snake peeling followed by Cerea brushing down in the bath and Suu's arrival. <br> Episode 5: Suu carried off by Papi scared for her being deported, with Darling running off after Papi. Then trying to hide Suu from Smith and all the girls getting molested for the first time then her being accepted into the harem and the remodeling of the house for the first time <br> Episode 6: Orc Thug Episode and M.O.N introduction. Then Mero's introduction and moving in <br> Episode 7: Darling sick episode with all the girls taking care of him.

Ends with Rachnera sneakpeak <br> Episode 8: Rachnera's introduction. Rachnera kidnaps Darling then Darling gets 'rescued' and then Rachnera joins the Harem.

Plus Rachnera trying to take a bath with the girls and getting molested by Suu for the first time. D Letter Finale with Date with the M.O.N. <br> Episode 12: Lala's introduction and inclusion into the Harem. <br><br> This, of course, precludes any 'extended scenes' or 'original content'. But if they stay on the same pattern for the next 12 episodes, they'll end with Lala. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Silly anon, fucking ponies doesn't get you daughterus.<br><br> Now, if you could find one with hands to hold, that would be a different story. </br></br></br>  <br>Did that happen in the manga or was that just added? I don't recall.</br>  <br>I wish they didn't put the introduction of Papi and Cerea in the same episode, even if it means we have to deal with filler.<br><br>Miia's orgasm inducing tail-tip is from the manga.</br></br></br>  <br> finally after all the foreplay you get ready to put your dick into her Lamia vagina <br> as you slowly enter her tight vagina she makes a slight rattling sound followed by drool dripping from her mouth <br> using her lower snake like body she puts pressure on her vagina making it tighter and tighter as you keep plowing her <br> as blood soaks past your dick you can see pain and incredible enjoyment in Miia's eyes <br> d~darling.... its ok, plow me as hard as you want, I am a pet under your complete obedience </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a pony is the same as centaur <br><br>- you</br></br></br>  Is manga more lewder than anime?  <br>Okay, I thought they just added it in.<br><br> yfw the peeling scene is coming soon </br></br></br>  <br>Yes and no. The anime has lewd sounds, the manga has exposed nipples.</br>  <br> plow </br>    <br>It is. You're having sex with a horse vagina. You can't even grab the tits when sex happens cause you're fucking a horse vagina. I hope cerea isn't popular. I donly know the results of that one poll.</br>  Which Monsume would actually be a good wife?  Were are the nipples? I watched 3 new shows today with ecchi content and none of them had nipples.  <br>Okusama ga Seito Kaichou have nipples.</br>  <br>That picture</br>  <br><br>Conflicting responses.</br></br>  <br>But it isn't. You do understand that a pony is one thing and a centaur is another. That's like saying a Werewolf is a badger. It doesn't make sense.</br>  <br>I'm reserving judgment until after the girl who lives off pussy juice is introduced.</br>  <br> Smith looking like black haired Rider in a business suit <br> Dat Yuu Kobayashi VA <br> Dat ED <br>Fuck diamonds, my dick is 15 on the mohs scale</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you ask questions that you know the answer to?</br>  <br>well the synopsis sounds interesting</br>  <br><br> pet under your complete obedience </br></br>  <br>Obviously</br>  <br>Horse vagina's don't have nipples.</br>  <br> snake carton </br>  <br>In the entire manga it's<br><br>Yuki-Onna&gt;Manako&gt;Mea</br></br></br>  <br>Suu.<br>She's a living trashcan, and can heal pretty much anything. And I wonder how great she feels.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, I'll do better next time.</br></br>  <br>Moar best waifu</br>  <br> mea <br>It's Miia.</br></br>    <br>Probably like sticking your dick in jello</br>  <br> Wanting to have sex with trash </br>  <br>More like Meh<br>Amirite?</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Guh damn</br>  <br>There are horsefuckers in this thread. Trash can is a lot more acceptable.</br>  God damn I have been waiting for this for so long. It is finally here my brothers! Let us rejoice!  <br><br> having sex with a household appliance </br></br>  Remember: if you ever end up with a Lamia, give her all the eggs.  <br> not wanting to have sex with trash </br>  <br>There are people so jalous of Cerea that they would rather have trash. I can get you like a girl more but jesus christ man.</br>  <br>No you are not right.</br>  <br> Implying you wouldn't fuck your computer if you could. </br>  <br>It's okay, Suu still loves you.</br>  May i remind you all that Cerea is the only Mammal with Fish slut. Thus she have the best chance at getting master.  I want to wander into a Lamia village.   You will never work beside your Centaur Waifu at Medieval Times <br> You will never display in beautiful armor with her before the screaming crowd <br> You will never participate in jousting competitions on her back, helping her steady the lance. <br> You will never act out an injury from the 'evil knight' that enrages your waifu <br> You will never have her avenge you by crushing the Evil Knight and winning the tournament <br> You will never unite in the winner's circle and share a passionate, loving kiss then raise your arms in victory and bow to the crowd. <br> You will never ride off with your centaur wife, both sweaty and content... and she will never fully indicate she is going to be the one riding you once she gets you alone with how turned on she was from the show <br><br>God, I want this so bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No anon, don't! It's a wretched hive!</br>  <br>Of Rape and Lewdness</br>  Have not read or watched anything, just tell me who the lewdest girl is.  <br>I see what you did there</br>   BtB Monster Musume <br> edition <br>Fucking stop this.<br>Do you want it to become the new Yahari Threads</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder.</br>  <br>Why are you doing this.</br>  I WANT TO FEED CARROTS TO CEREA!  <br>i think the board you were looking for was <br><br>surprised actually it still exists</br></br></br>  <br>Should have gone for this</br>  So, when do the first blu-ray come out? I want my damn uncensored episodes.  https://d.maxfile.ro/luxbzlkhdc.web<wbr>m <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/afivjaxuni.web<wbr>m <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/vmwqlcdvxm.web<wbr>m <br><br>Important webms from the episode  and lewd pic </br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br> lewdest <br>Miia's mother.</br></br>  <br>   You will never be forced to stand there while a burly male centaur mounts her. </br>  <br>Because I can.</br>  <br> tumblr nose </br>  <br> "just tell me who the lewdest girl is." <br>It's easier to answer who isn't lewd. Pretty much most of the main girls are full lewd.<br>Just go and choose which one you like the most. Personally I'd love Suu (slime) or Rachnee (spider who's into bondage)<br>Oh, I didn't remember </br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Kimihito raped Cerea.  <br>Rachnera is up there. The whole shibari thing is pretty damn lewd.<br><br>But really, the lewdist is Suu.<br><br>She is the one who goorapes and molests the other girls periodically. If you get wet or covered in tasty things like splashed... whatever. She is going to molest and violate and bring to orgasm</br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking Ryuuji.  This show was cute. Too bad it looks like it will turn into shitty monster girl harem instead of cute monster girl romance.    <br>Suu is probably the best. Has an actual humanoid form, rather than half human half monster shit, can change her form to whatever your dick desires, and you won't need lube.</br>  <br><br> falling for your rapist <br><br>sasuga cerea</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kimihito <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Anon has a point, the vagina is on the horse part so you would be fucking a horse vagina - albeit it the horse part of a centaur.<br><br> Also her vagina is probably only fit for male centaur use. She probably won't even feel your human apparatus. Like a hotdog through a tunnel </br></br></br>  Rachnee best girl  <br>What a lech.<br><br>Centaur women like human males well enough.</br></br></br>  <br> Kimihito <br>It took me a good while to figure out who you were talking about. How do you even remember his name? It hasn't been mentioned since like, the first issue of the manga.</br></br>  <br>I just watched the episode yesterday, how could I not remember it?</br>  <br> Centaur women like human males well enough. <br><br>Whatever helps you sleep at night friend :^)</br></br></br>  <br><br>truly</br></br>  <br>Not all of the girls are cockcravers</br>  <br><br>Spidermind.</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ read the fucking manga</br>  <br> Whatever helps you sleep at night friend :^) <br>Male Centaurs wished that you were right...</br></br>  <br/>  Isn't there a monster girl thread on /jp/? is it any good?  <br>Lala during full moon probably.</br>  Does anyone like her.  <br>lots of people<br><br> Myself included.  </br></br></br>  So the Tokyo MX being any less censored than AT-X or CR was a ruse, right?  <br>BACK THE FUCK OFF?!?</br>  <br/>  <br>Do I have to put them in a bowl first?</br>  <br>Oh well, it won't be mentioned in rest of the series.</br>  Reminder that monster girls are heretical and should be slain.   I like spiders   <br>Yes there is and no it isn't, and I say that as someone who frequents it almost every day.</br>  <br>Sigh. Do you really need me to explain this again? There are some very disturbed individuals in the world who have... done things... and they freely share information. So we know how a Centaur's Pussy and a human's dick would interact.<br><br>A centaur's pussy will be loose at first, but there is an incredible level of muscular control inside. The insides are hot, like steaming on a cold day hot, especially when aroused. With the muscles clamping down, what goes from a loose, hot tunnel goes as tight as a virgin pussy.<br><br>Further, the muscular control is so intense that your Centaur waifu will be able to effectively milk your cock with the contractions.<br><br>Now, Stallions, or in this case, centaur males, have very big cocks yes... but they also have very little staying power. 10 seconds of penetration and pumping before they cum and go off on their business.<br><br>This fact, along with the fact that centaur mare pussies most eroginous and pleasurable zones, including their clit which is large enough to rub along the underside of your dick as you penetrate her as she tightens and 'winks' as you make love to her, are right at the 'mouth' of her pussy. Just inside. IE, where your cock is going to reach.<br><br>So, with enough stimulation, you'll find centaur mares very receptive and orgasming to a human sized penis compared to a stallion sized.<br><br>In fact, many centaur women prefer the smaller size.<br><br>There is the old 'its not the size of the vessel, but the motion of the ocean'? It certainly applies to Centaur Maidens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lots of people </br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>wat do</br></br></br>  <br> Get rock hard faster then I ever have ever. </br>    <br>This again?</br>  <br> tfw no paladin onee--san to protect you from evil mamono <br><br><br>If you call a thousand post shitstorm better, then yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same as <br><br>It's not something to start going to if you're completely new to monstergirl stuff and dont know anything about the history of these threads<br><br>It's just the best option out of a buch of really shitty ones for monstergirl discussion</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>All i remember from the canon is that they use human males to get the female centaur horny enough for the male centaur to start his business.<br><br>If your goal is to be a professional cuck then go ahead Moot, I'm not going to judge.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm into tragic romance, aswell. Of course I love her.<br> mfw you will never leave your baby to her after you've died <br> mfw you will never go out like romeo and juliet <br> mfw you will never have her child after she died while giving birth to the child. </br></br></br></br>  <br> There are some very disturbed individuals in the world who have... done things... and they freely share information <br>Isn't it fucking dangerous to fucking a horse? What if it drop kicks your dick anytime you're trying to fug it?</br></br>  <br>Who would ever want to harm someone so perfect?</br>   wake up <br> see this <br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Get raped.</br>  <br> Liking spiders <br><br>How much more of a social outcast can you be</br></br></br>  <br>surrender myself to her.</br>  Reminder that Miia is a slut that used MC to get his sperm and get more lamia's  <br>grab a hose and spray her away</br>  <br>That's europark in germany right?</br>  <br> Image related <br> Not really. Fuck the shit out of her </br></br>  <br>Is getting full-body hugged by a slime considered vore?</br>  <br>You can easily steal away and marry your own centaur waifu without them being part of that horrible polygamist marriage culture. Look at Cerea. She is pure and unmarried.<br><br>Darling is going to get some mint, perfect horse pussy.<br><br>Oh yeah, its dangerous. But these disturbed individuals are experienced horse handlers. You can easily tell when they want to be touched and when they don't. If they don't, the horse fuckers arn't dumb enough to stand behind them and try to stick their dick in.<br><br>And those that are get kicked. And get weeded out of the gene pool<br><br><br>Probably, but its also the same design as Medieval Times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if you actually read it you would know that that's just a front for the centaur women and the teasers to knock the husband out and fuck over his unconscious body. <br><br>Cerea's mom confirms that that's common in the mom bonus chapter<br><br>Honestly though it doesn't make their culture any less shitty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take her to a romantic stroll under the hard rain.</br>  <br><br>Sweat furiously.</br></br>  <br> implying twenty seconds of grunting and failed penetration is worth the risk of retard meathead babies. </br>   wake up <br> see this <br>What do?</br></br>  <br> Darling is going to get some mint, perfect horse pussy. <br><br> implying Cerea is going to win </br></br></br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>wat do</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of Lala, anyone here got that Irish accent edit of her going all chuuni for the D</br>  <br>I think even most of the smart ones are getting weeded out of the gene pool since horses can't give birth to humans</br>  No matter who you think is the best, you can't hate Suu  <br>The author already confirmed that either Cerea or Mia would win.</br>  <br>Touch the spidercow, do it now!</br>  <br>Be sad that Crabman has yet to include an Ushi-Oni in the manga</br>  <br> Remove her seal <br> Close my eyes </br></br>  <br>Call the cops, tell her to go away while my waifu hugs me close</br>  <br> Implying they aren't going to Harem End with him marrying all the girls due to a passing of the Extraspecies Polygamy Act. </br>   waking up and seeing all these girls gunning for my dick <br>Is it the full moon or something?</br>  <br>"Here, have this."</br>  <br>Full moon frenzy soon.</br>  <br>Trufax</br>  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  Does horse have the best singing voice or the greatest singing voice?   doujin abou suu becoming a literal cumdump after absorbing tons of semen   <br>Go without fapping until the time comes. I dare you. I double dare you, motherfucker.</br>  <br>I'm going to need a source on that, and honestly if you think that only one girl is going to win and it's not Miia you're insane</br>    <br>What does that achieve?</br>  The real question of the episode is how Darling managed to remodel the entire bathroom in one day.  <br>When has he ever said that Cerea could seriously win?</br>  <br>Come on man, at least read the manga, it explains it.</br>  <br>He won't. She's like Kenkou's main girl.</br>  <br>Don't ask for the impossible anon.</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br> Cerea is the cutest edition <br> edition </br></br>  <br>YES.

I never asked for such power.</br>  <br>Maple rumcake!</br>  Post fake NEET armpits, thank you.  I'm going to be so disappointed if she doesn't get at least a full episode dedicated to her.  <br>Well you'll most likely be disappointed, the only Non-CP CGs that will get an episode is Mika, Karen and Nao, the latter two only because they'll be in a Rin episode.</br>  <br>Isn't she pretty high in the fan rankings?<br>Why would they only include her as a short cameo?</br></br>  <br>I'd love it if they let her sing a bit of her song<br>https://<span>youtu.be/xox-Fzr4i1A  [ ]<br><br> img captcha: cake, how apropos </br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said she'll only be stuck as a cameo, she's most likely going to play a big part for CP in the second cour, but an entire episode dedicated to her even though she isn't NG or even CP is kind of stretching it.</br>  <br>SCAMCO thinks Rin prints them money, so they pimp her out pretty damn hard.</br>  <br>They kinda implied that she had some previous history with producer. They can make an episode about that.</br>  How is Rika so capable of corrupting good idols?  <br>Still funny how blown out of proportion that little scene was, it seemed like simple fanservice at first but after what happened it pretty much became it's own thing.<br><br><br>Nanchara</br></br></br></br>  Uzuki's messy hair can bring about world peace  We were destined to choose this thread afterall. I guess it's what you call a  thread of fate      Triad Primus <br> Natsuki <br> More Kaede <br><br>This season is absolutely crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They have a bit of a long dark pouty faced girl fetish so not that surprising</br></br>  <br> pouty <br>Not even that, it's a scowl.<br>Nips are masochistic to the days</br></br></br>  Is Rin a little tsundere?  <br>But you know that NG will always be there to steal to show every episode.</br>  <br>A overrrated</br>  I actually cried at the last episode of Cinderella Girls, when Mio is reading the fan letter.<br><br>I've never even cried at anime that tries to be sad like Anohana or Angel Beats.<br><br>But I cried at an anime about little girl idols.</br></br></br></br>  How can Mio gain popularity?  Mai idolfu in the anime never. ;_;  <br>Star in a JAV.</br>  <br>Why are they so bland?<br>It's like a big block of tofu surrounded by plenty of different spices and flavors.</br></br>  <br><br>I laughed at Iori and Miki looking at theirs.</br></br>  <br>She's more jealous than tsundere. Rin wants the Producer all to her self.</br>  <br>Same my friend; I will riot! Kaede is the perfect "lady" to make Rin and Mika jelly.</br>  <br><br>So she is a level or two down from Yandere<br><br>She is possessive but not crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br>I laugh so hard to your lame puns.</br>  <br>That's only in fanon, canon Rin is tsundere</br>  Only secondaries hate Mio?  <br>Please don't compare the greatness of tofu to shit like NG</br>  <br>No. Mio a shit.</br>  <br>Anyone who does not laugh will receive thorough  punishment </br>  <br><br>Rin does something, I don't quite know what it is though.<br><br>The cutest thing I have seen Rin do and it was only for an instant</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn, where did you find those puns?</br>  <br>Do they get sent to a  punitentiary  ?</br>  <br>Rejoice bcuz we have the power bruh.</br>  <br>In the weapun shop.</br>  <br> Not the Puwn shop <br>You're losing your edge.</br></br>  <br> The trailer shows that we are still focusing on the same characters and not Kaede's group <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br> Weekly dose of Anya is coming back <br>Hell yeah</br></br>   so much Kaede in these threads all the time <br>It's so great.</br>  <br><br>I hope we get a full Love Laika episode</br></br>  <br>Sorry, but Puwn looks more like it's pronounced Poon than Pawn. But I am still  pawndering  using it.</br>  <br>Anya is still due for an episode and she can't have one without Minami and Ranko</br>  How do we know she's getting more screentime this season?  Is Kaede the most likely to get convicted for rape?  <br>Let's just forget everyone but those 4.<br>That would make an awesome show.</br></br>  hello friends are we ready  <br>Yeah, that last scene was a really good way to round off Mio's subplot. If her drama in the earlier episodes hadn't been so badly handled to make her look like a bitch, she might've been my favorite CG in the first cour.</br>  <br>I would watch the shit out of a show with these 4.</br>  <br>She's so fucking gorgeous. I don't even know how because her design is fairly simple, but she's definitely the prettiest Cinderella.</br>  <br><br>Lions &gt; cats</br></br>  <br>I am ready for more Miku. As always, a cat is fine too.</br>  <br>but anon, わかるわ Candy Island ep<br> and ep1 getting massaged </br></br>  <br>Foxes are better than both.</br>  <br> Adventures of a punny hag, Cute Slav, Chuuni and Minami <br>Yes please</br></br>  <br>I meant second season, since she wasn't listed as one of the side characters if I remember right. But yeah those were basically my favorite parts of S1.</br>  <br><br>Still love that it's become a strong fanon</br></br>  <br>How will the anime start? I'm guessing it'll just do what the original series did with Uzuki thinking 'Time flies, we're famous idols now lel"<br><br>Also, P-san probably will probably show up even less as with the other girls as they head into Rin and Dookie focused arcs.</br></br></br>  I want Kaede to wash my back.    <br>Fuck you, that entire idea is shit.</br>  My favorite idol isn't even an idol at all.    <br><br>TakeP too strong for any idol to handle.</br></br>  Is the cat idol slutty or pure?  <br>What are they riding in?</br>   Natsuki voiced <br><br>I'm so happy. I can't wait for Asterisk shenanigans.</br></br>    <br><br>Prude, she is really a normalfag underneath her cat ears</br></br>  Delicious temptress.  Who Uzuki here?  <br>NOW I can honestly say<br>I am L@DY</br></br>  Kaede or riot!  <br>Natsuki will ruin this relationship.</br>  <br>But normalfags are whores</br>    <br>They are riding in KITT from Knight Rider.</br>   other characters in the PV <br>those are the only seconds they will be on screen</br>    <br><br> Ruin <br> Not improve with Miku being jelly </br></br></br>  <br><br>No you don't Chihiro</br></br>  <br>That list was apparently debunked.</br>  <br>Then I can still hold out hope right?</br>      <br>It's pretty shit but that's the most likely way they'll do it. <br><br>The start of the second cour is going to be almost exactly like the start of the second cour of the original.<br><br> Yay We're famous now <br> Big bad will step up to the plate <br> Reaffirmation of why being an idol is great. <br><br>WIth the way they handled the last cour this is pretty clear.<br><br>I'm not saying it's good, just the most likely</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wanting to eat some Christmas cake in the middle of summer.  <br>tfw not the only 1 who has those saved</br>  <br>I guess so? The website makes it somehwat clear it intends to complete Blue Napoleon voice set which is what Mizuki is part of, and just Sarina and Hina are left.</br>  <br><br>Uzupaca the cutest</br></br>  <br>Best Idol</br>  <br>I want to ruffle her hair.</br>  Going on onsen excursions with Kaede!   There will never be a crossover OVA   <br><br>Ruffling that hair.</br></br>  <br>Did you not watch the PV at all?</br>  <br><br> 765 pro doing Goin'!!! <br> Cinderella Project doing Jibun Rest@rt </br></br></br>  <br>765Pro would improve Goin'!!<br>But CP would probably sing a worse Jibun Rest@rt, even though CP has great singers, they feel so far apart compared to 765Pro, even in CG merchandise they're separated into their units.<br><br>Which is the exact thing that dragged CGs episode 13 so far down besides the still frames.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we will never learn who truly is the boss of this gym </br>  <br>No, actually. I've always been more into the games than the anime. I only just watched the first cour of CG a couple weeks ago. Hell, I didn't even watch the original IM@S anime until about a year ago even though I've played the games for like 5 or 6 years. Guess I was wrong then. Sorry.</br>  <br>How big is Billy Harrington over there? I know he's a meme but I'm not certain how widespread he is.</br>  <br>Probably only popular among the NEETs just like in the west. Couldn't say I'm not a jap.</br>  <br><br>I like that strip<br><br>It shows the differences between a large company like 346 and a small one like 765.</br></br></br></br>  Gloomy Fumi never.  <br>I always liked the butterfly shirt Anya wears, too bad the anime removed the design.</br>  <br>Why is there a 17 year old in there?</br>  <br><br>AkaP isn't strong but he has other ways.</br></br>  Why do they call them TakeP and AkaP?  <br>Their VAs.</br>  <br><br>Come on, man.</br></br>  At least she got a Magihour with Kanade.  <br>Takeuchi Shunsuke and Akabane Kenji are their voice actors.</br>    <br>I'd call them producer and PRODUCER.</br>  <br>Man is there more strips like this? It really put a smile on my face.</br>  <br>i wanna give her the  brush </br>  <br><br>And then there is P</br></br>  <br>Kiss me, Kanade!</br>  <br><br>So fluffy.</br></br>  <br>The world needs more friendship</br>  <br><br>I'd give her the brush after taking a bunch of pictures of her bed hair while in her uniform.</br></br>  <br>Yes, "friendship".</br>  <br>it's like Christmas in July!</br>    <br><br>Can you brush my hair next?</br></br>  <br>The perfect balance between pure and lewd created an equilibrium, Love Laika is a miracle.</br>      <br>i want to lick her asshole through her pjs</br>  <br> Bwahahah, gross! <br>Oh Producer.</br></br>  I love you Iori.<br>I love you.</br>  Beach episode this season?  <br>Hopefully soon<br>Look at those lovey ladies</br></br>  <br>Go to fucking sleep, Verty.</br>  <br>L@lis in bikinis?</br>  <br>I wanna see Minami in a bikini.</br>  <br><br>Boobie monster bikini when?</br></br>  <br>Not without you.</br>  <br><br>Iori is so lewd</br></br>  <br>So basically if they exchanged P-san's, Original amime may go well at the start but things would totally go to shit during Miki's arc where they may even lose her, while in CG things would definitely go worse but may turn out better.</br>  I want to protect his  egao.   <br>For me.</br>  <br>Is it even necessary?</br>  I want to make Nana happy  <br>Only the sweet release of death can make her happy.</br>  <br><br>Mika is the best part of CG</br></br>    <br>Mika is always in revealing outfits, I want to see the others in one too</br>    <br>What are you some kind of a gay? Of course its necessary because Mika is at the top of the list for beach bikinis</br>  <br><br>We need to make her happy</br></br>  <br>Why shouldn't it be?<br><br>Are you a muslim or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Kaede, please.</br>  <br>It seems we will get her room animated, I expect good things.</br>  <br><br>RUMIIIIIIIIIIII</br></br>  <br> ロックしたい </br>    Hagfags need to be stopped.   9 more days <br><br>This is too much.</br></br>  <br>Syoko a cute.</br>  <br>Are you pulling my leg mate?<br><br> did she finally get a voice? Haven't been here for the past few weeks. </br></br></br>  <br>Listen to the latest Magic Hour. It's magical.</br>  <br>Noooooooooo!</br>  <br><br>One day the mushrooms will take over.</br></br>  <br> rape </br>  <br><br>Looks like the tables have turned</br></br>  My iDOLM@STER custom PMAG for airsoft.  <br> No Anastasia or Aki Yamato <br>Come on man.</br></br>  <br>I want to shw her my mushroom</br>  <br>Hi Iorist. I make those Iori /c/ threads you post in, good to see you here.</br>    <br>I remember when Anya was one of the coolest CG when she was introduced, then the anime came along and turned her into one of the cutest.<br><br>My mind is conflicted</br></br></br>  <br>I vote both<br>both is good</br></br>  The other side of PMAG.  <br>Both is good indeed</br>  9 more days until the best idol, SHIBUYA RIN, returns on screen.<br><br>I hope she gets a nice 5-episode drama arc. <br><br>Now that the introductions to all the shitty idols (cat furry, rock poser, lazy ass, tall autist, russian hooker, etc) are done, we can focus on the characters who truly matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your trolling won't make me hate her as much as I already do.<br><br>Which is already a lot as is.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not trolling. I really do think that Cinderella Girls could be better off with only the New Generations girls being the focus, just like Dearly Stars had their trio.<br><br>Even with the TV focus spread across all those other useless gimmick idols, Japan STILL voted Rin as the best idol. <br><br>That's saying something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's over, Anon. <br>The show's already done its damage.</br></br>  <br>Mfw I don't really like her voice, especially when she's singing solo</br>  <br> I hope she gets a nice 5-episode drama arc. <br><br>May it conclude with character development.</br></br></br>  The pain never leaves.  <br> Absolutely <br><br> Disgusting </br></br></br>  <br>You're saying that like Japan is one person, the others are popular in their own right.<br><br>And really, from the first cour Miku, Riina, Anzu, Kirari and Anya have proven to be more relevant and matter more than even Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>rin a shit</br>  <br> Deal... <br><br> with it. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm kinda fine with this</br>  <br>Please don't ruin Kanade with a shitty edit</br>  <br>That's pretty insulting to Kanade.</br>  <br> lolis <br>AHAHAHAHA<br>No. This is still A-1.</br></br></br>  <br> May it conclude with character development. <br><br>Her kidnapping and raping Producer?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Thinking that it wouldn't bring destruction as nations wage war for the right to brush her hair <br><br><br><br>That'll cost ya</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondaries hate Mio because they barely know shit about her.<br><br>Primaries don't necessarily hate Mio, but legends of HAHA ITS MIO HONDA TIME still trigger some bad PTSD and make them shake in their boots.</br></br></br>  What will happen to Uzuki when Rin deserts her for Triad Primus?  <br>I doubt it.<br><br>If TakeP was in charge, the misunderstanding that would've made Miki leave wouldn't have happened. Hell, TakeP might've sniffed out most of Kuroi's plans and debunked them even before they went into action. As long as it's serious business, TakeP has it covered.<br><br>I doubt he would've gotten close to any of the 765 idols though. Most of them are high maintenance. And hell, the Futami Twins and Hibiki's animals alone would have probably made him go on temporary leave due to stress.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Her kidnapping and raping Producer? <br><br>That's insulting to P</br></br></br>  <br>If anything, TakeP as 765Pro's Producer would have made the idols more independent since they always have little communication.<br><br>PuchiP is the best regarding being a P.</br></br></br>  <br>I call the AbeP bruhducer and TakeP moeducer</br>  <br>Jeez, man. <br>Man.<br>Jeez.</br></br></br>  <br>Main Red Dramatic Event Horizon</br>  <br>Nothing much?<br><br>Uzuki is the type that would go "Good for you Rin-chan! I'm so happy for you!"<br><br>Besides, it's not that unusual for an idol to be part of multiple units IRL. Hell, we have that in the CG anime itself. All the girls are under the Umbrella Unit of Cinderella Project while they are divided into specific units themselves.<br><br>The kicker for Drama will be Stepmother bullying Uzuki until she breaks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm I wonder what type of music they're listening to?<br><br>Hmmm.... https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jha<wbr>4OkG-ixw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Does TakeP even have hobbies?<br><br>We know that AkaP enjoys vidya because he outright says it in Makoto's episode. Hell, we learned more about AkaP's background from the 2011 rebroadcast NoMake+<br><br>But we know next to nothing about TakeP other than the fact that he's a goddamn cyborg that lives for his aidorus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he collects rocks</br>  <br><br>And he has a rock collection inside his office.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, he's actually quite capable as a Producer and he doesn't forget to have fun with the idols.<br><br>But MajiP isn't human. He's a magical being from the land of Producernia. He's essentially a higher being even more transcendent than the Puchis. The follies of being human don't apply to him so its unfair to place him as a point of comparison between AkaP and TakeP<br><br><br>He's too manly and ripped to be Rockfucker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think TakeP would have lasted past Yukiho's episode.</br>  <br>That was the wrong number.</br>   S-Suffering!?   I will never cum all over Kaede's face, and this makes me mildly upset.  <br>There are always ways to make it happen.</br>  More gyaru idols, Japan.  <br><br>yes plz</br></br>  <br><br>Rina a cute.<br><br>Hugs, kisses, and riding our motor bikes into the sunset.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fake gyaru</br>    I want to fill her with creampies.  <br>Her and Rika need to end up tanned in the inevitable beach episode.</br>  <br>I'm really having my doubts about a beach episode and focusing on any of the lolis.</br>  <br>Takes Idols on dates; being side dish for cakes.</br>  <br>So he's going the TheaterP route?</br>  <br>Top left of the picture. Two arrows.</br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>Pretty much</br>  <br>Dooky is a lovely girl. I like her hair. <br>I want to give her presents and a kiss.</br></br>  <br>R O C K<br>O<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> wanting to fuck trailer trash </br></br></br></br>  Is she the best slut?  <br> she gives kisses away for free <br> but she will never kiss you <br>I'd say thats pretty slutty indeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. It shows that she's serious when it comes to you.</br>  <br>She only kisses other idols though</br>  I want to protect this intoxicated smile.   Kaede will never greet you when you get back home  <br> Kaede will never wear your used shirt <br><br><br>My suffering is real</br></br></br></br>  <br>guilty</br>  <br><br> Presumably complimenting Riina <br> Usamin <br> Shine <br><br>I'm fucking hyped. Next week can't come fast enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Please post more of the girl called Kaede.<br><br>I know nothing about Idolmaster but this girl has me completely mesmerized. Could it be I've finally found my waifu?</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Zk<wbr>Qhx_foqM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>That soft instrumental version of Yubae present always gets me.<br><br>Anyways, some choice lines from the PV<br><br> Onee-chan can you give me Love Advice? <br><br>Looks like for the Rika episode, Rika goes full Lewd and asks Mika for some advice she obviously can't give. So spaghetti Mika antics incoming.<br><br> That partner of yours, she's pretty cool huh? <br><br>This is an unfamiliar voice. But it's presumably Natsuki. She is obviously talking to someone here. But it can be Riina or Miku. For hilarity's purpose, I imagine Natsuki telling Riina that Miku is the cool one. And it's actually in line with her Theater characterization. Because in most Theaters, Natsuki calls anybody BUT Riina as Rocking or Cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hyped for them Natsuki/Niwaka antics. Its gon be sweeet.</br>  <br>Look for a doujin called Canis Major. You won't regret it.</br>  Kaede will die of old age before she gets her own episode.  <br>Never give up hope.</br>  <br> For hilarity's purpose, I imagine Natsuki telling Riina that Miku is the cool one. <br>Well Miku does pull off the rock getup better then Riina without having to put much effort into it like a try hard niwaka.</br></br>  <br> Major <br>It's Canis Minor<br>Wrong one</br></br></br>  More of TakeP's sultry manly voice.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Wxf<wbr>59vmjFSA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>He's the White Haired Fighter Guy. <br><br>Goddamn. You don't don't wanna fuck with his Aidorus man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Clock ticking down to midnight at the end <br><br>Happening?</br></br></br>  <br> I imagine Natsuki telling Riina that Miku is the cool one. <br>That's what I was thinking as well. And then switch to a few scenes later where Riina has begun wearing cat ears.</br></br>  <br>I'm confident that it's Natsuki telling Riina that Miku is pretty cool.<br><br>For Natsuki, anybody who is fully assured of who they are and passionate in what they do is cool and Rocking. And Miku's passion about her Cat persona perfectly fits that bill.</br></br></br>  <br>That seems quite foreboding.<br>Going with the cinderella theme, if one or two of the girls had to stop being idols and go back to being normal girls at "midnight" who would it be?</br></br>  <br>Uzuki for sure, the second could be anyone that isn't Mio or Rin.<br><br>Maybe Anya gets deported?</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki or Rin, considering that the former failed her audition but still got in and the latter didn't even have an audition.</br>  <br><br>Hope we get hair down Natsuki.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make any sense, Cinderella wanted to go to the ball and didn't want to leave either, Rin didn't want to be an idol and had to find reason to like it.<br><br>Now that i think about it despite her popularity, Rin is the worst metaphorical Cinderella.</br></br></br>  <br>You're right. I was just following the train of logic of which girls fit under the "became Cinderella through a spell that runs out at midnight". Those were the only two who fit under that, but you're right in that Rin doesn't fit as she didn't even want to be one in the first place.<br><br>Uzuki best Cinderella. S(mile)ing will be the best insert for her arc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Goddammit anon. I did not ask for these feels.</br></br>  <br> became Cinderella through a spell that runs out at midnight <br>Well using this logic, even the girls who auditioned fit the bill, considering where they all come from, it's safe to say the auditions were nationwide, and yet those 11 were chosen by "the Prince".</br></br>  <br> Kryede </br>  <br>Don't worry AbeP can take Kotori; TakeP will deliver it.</br>  <br> "I want to climb up with the fans". <br><br>Who is she telling that to?</br></br></br>  <br>Dude line up.<br><br>Theres alot of cake lover here.</br></br></br>  Momoka better show up or i riot.  <br> loli <br> show up </br></br>  <br>Believe A-1 will deliver.</br>  <br>We all know that A-1 hates lolis.</br>  <br> *cricket noises* </br>  Kancolle reference, or we riot.

Extremely devoted to Producer, she needs nothing but Producer. All her thought processes boil down to Producer, and all her actions correlate to putting her and Producer together in any way possible.<br><br>Chieri: "Dependency" type Yandere<br>- Primary trait is her excessive loneliness and abandonment issues. Her types usually have a bad past. Usually very shy and low key as a person, she acquires calm and stability from Producer's presence. Extended separation from Producer will easily drive her mad with fear and anxiety<br><br>Yukari: "Obsession" type Yandere<br>- The very serious (albeit airheaded) and hardworking type. She relies on Producer too much, but in a different vector from the "dependency" types. Her primary obsession is acquiring the validation and acknowledgement of Producer. Her life is about earning the praise of Producer. Because of this, she acquires an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Producer's likes and dislikes.<br><br>Kyoko: "Insanity" type Yandere<br>Unlike the other three which has some obvious flaws that points out there is something off about them, she is otherwise a perfectly functional and reliable human being. Highly skilled in many things and sociable with most people. Her type can easily switch between normalcy and batshit insanity. When in her mode of insanity, her natural talents are tools in cornering Producer. The concepts of right and wrong does not exist to her; she can (and will) break into someone's house or murder someone in cold blood and she'll think of it as a perfectly normal thing to do. And actually, if one isn't aware of her hidden madness, one would think her to be the perfect girl. The scariest thing? When something does go wrong, nobody will suspect her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get the fuck on my boat, I don't need it anymore</br>  <br>I look forward to getting all but two chapters this year Miura.</br>  <br>Fuck up faggot<br> https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/n<wbr>ews/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confir<wbr>med-to-resume-as-monthly-series-thi<wbr>s-month/.90187</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>We all want the same.<br><br><br><br>No we riot every episode Kaede doesn't appear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Kaede deserves less obnoxious fans.</br></br></br>  <br>Black hole calling the kettle black.</br>  I just want us to be alcoholics together forever.

His only hope for victory is a surprise Fusion summon.</br>  <br> dick socks </br>  <br>I'm not even sure they could do the tourney, even if they wanted to. Bear in mind that all of the Lancers are supposed to be entering, as well as their pals in Synchro. There's no way to satisfyingly resolve an entire tournament that size.<br><br>My guess is that either Academia invades and starts carding people  like Jean please please , or the Lancers have to emergency port because Standard is being invaded or some such.<br><br>I just don't see way to actually play the entire tournament out, aside from doing a timeskip to the last 8 or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wanting Shun to win even more <br><br>Bird boy needs to get a good loss to Fusion. Not this Sora off-screen shit. Just Dennis motherfucking Mackfield playing him like a damn fiddle then Fusing Xyz monsters to win. <br><br>But that will never happen because Ruri Raptors are more marketable than Entermages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Dennis is a double spy </br>  <br> not triple spy </br>  <br>I hope not. I mean I want Yuuya to be happy as much as the next person who obsesses over him but Jack shouldn't lose his potency within the universe just because new characters show up.<br><br>Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora?</br></br></br>  <br> not quadruple spy </br>  <br>Penis is actually rooting for the winners, so, as soon as academia starts losing, he turncloaks.</br>  I'm just catching up on the last 16 episodes now, and I really regret missing all the threads. I'm certainly ENJOYing this new arc, though. Time to stock up on fanart, I guess.<br><br> mfw either Yugo or Yuya will be dimension-ported as a result of the upcoming proximity with Yuzu <br>Please don't make the fruits stay away from each other too long. Please.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't want him to win, it was just a bad joke about how Shun never loses. If anything I want him to be crushed so badly he's left in an even more pathetic state than Sora was after their first duel.</br>  <br>Arc V has a hard on for group duels, they could knock 75% of participants out with another Battle Royale in a few episodes if they wanted</br>  <br>I want him to watch Yuya vs Yuri in the shadows and I want him to see Yuri get blown out and have him just straight up not ever go back to fusion.</br>  Ok, I had enough of this shit. I want you to say to me, why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain, Infinity or Vanity deserves the ban.  <br> See that Yuri I was only PRETENDING to be retarded </br>  <br> fusion requires xyz monsters <br> effect based on the number of materials on the xyz monsters at the time of the summon. </br></br>  <br> Finals of Friendship cup is Yuya vs Yugo, winner gets to vs Jack for title of King. <br> Yuzu is sitting in the stands right next to the ring <br> As Yugo and Yuya are riding along side each other they pass Yuzu, bracelet starts acting up and ports one of them </br></br></br>   Sawatari and Gongenzaka are literally fodders for Shun.   <br> why it's not bullshit when I say neither Lavalval Chain <br>Its a great utility card that helps a ton of decks, but it isnt broken. The only really bad interaction it has is with Clown Blade, and you should hit either of those before you ban this<br><br> Infinity  <br>Would be perfectly fine if only shitty Rank 5 decks could use it. Ptol is the problem card<br><br> Vanity  <br>Probably should be banned yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/dng/ <br><br>Also<br> Chain <br>It's a staple for almsot every deck with R4 access, a plethora of them being casual fun decks, and there is absolutely no reason to ban it because of the meta, since everything using it only has it to have more consistent access to the broken shit that deserves banning and would have more than enough alternatives even with it gone<br> Infinity <br>Ptolemeius is the problem, no need to take away CyDra's alternate win condition<br> Vanity <br>It's fine at 1 and helps keep things in check nicely enough</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis is going to make sure that Yuzu isn't around so Yuya can absorb Yugo.</br>  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>43798</wbr>  <br>After, like, 90% of that duel being offscreen. Bird boy needs to have a full duel with Dennis onscreen. Shun pushes and pushes and just when he thinks he has Dennis on the ropes BAM! Big reveal that Dennis is Fusion in the form of him pulling an Xyz Fusion to beat Shun's 9x Ranked Up Cuntcrusher Falcon.<br><br>God I fucking hate marketing.</br></br></br>  THIS ARC OF SMILE<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>11556</wbr></br>  Why did they pick fusion as the bad guys?  <br> Still won't change his best boy status </br>  <br>Lavalval Chain helps many decks to have access to broken cards, but I don't think it's broken.<br>Infinity is overpowered, but not broken, Ptolemaius is the big problem.<br>And Vanity is fine.<br><br><br>Gonna ask you something, the hands are still good?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  WE FINALLY HAVE A MMD WITH A RIN MODEL!<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm265<wbr>78783</wbr></br>  <br>Superpoly was super evil.</br>  <br>Good enough to splash in anything that needs to fill some monster slots and can use them.<br>Just lost a bunch of their power lately.<br><br> Seriously, &gt;&gt;&gt;/dng, though. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Wasn't he blown down the stairs by Sora? <br>That duel was terrible compared to their first one. I wish they skipped Serena vs Dennis to show it properly.</br></br>  I'am free so who wants a duel on<br>Ygo Pro it just got an update with new cards only for the android version</br>  <br>Maybe. I thought for sure that when Dennis said Serena would be right along during the prison break that he actually meant he'd ported her back to the Fusion Dimension, but he didn't.</br>  <br>The first one is literally the best YGO duel of all time, most duels suck in comparison to it.</br>  His face looks more fox-like every episode.  <br> Lavalval Chain <br><br>why<br><br> Infinity <br>Agreed<br><br> Vanity <br>why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his forehead nose conjunction must have hurt that mom pretty badly in childbirth</br>  <br>No, but that one wasn't even a duel. They showed the beginning and the end and that's lame.<br><br>Meanwhile, if they skipped Serena vs Dennis, things like Tricklown wouldn't exist too.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't make it xyz as those are their big money makers and nobody cares about synchro and Ritual is a bad joke so it had to be Fusion by process of elimination.</br>  RURI~<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>05685</wbr></br>  <br>Q U A L I T Y</br>  <br> Lavalval Chain <br>It's fine<br> Infinity <br>The problem is the card in conjunction with Ptolemy that and the fact that you're allowed to use overlays on opponent's turns, it effectively can shut down anything if used properly, which is a bit much, deserves to at least be limited or allocated solely to Rank 5 decks, having it in Tellar is too much especially multiple.<br> Vanity <br>Needs to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't make this game more complicated than it already is.</br>  <br>Synchro already got to be the evil one in 5D's and Xyz was a bit overdone in Zexal<br>And Fusion makes the most sense story wise as it makes sense that Fusion dimension would be the one trying to fuse all dimension.</br></br>  <br><br>I like that we learned that Jean-Michel is actually just some lower dog and doesn't have that much power after all. Makes him somehow more interesting, dunno why</br></br>  <br>And what about the fags like me who just like Cyber Dragon and the fact that you can use Infinity with a lot of deck you may like (like NK or LS) is something I can love even though everyone else can also do it?</br>  <br> not overlaying the dimensions </br>  <br>I love Cyber Dragon too, but the card is a tad much considering it's not limited and can be used on either turn and keep consistent Xyz materials. It mostly just needs to be banned from Tellar, they can easily get two of them out in short work.</br>  <br>How do you make Cyber Dragon Nova or Infinity in NK or LS?</br>  <br>In LS you can use Clownblade and the milling does the rest. NK it's something I have never see tho.</br>  <br>how do you Noble Knight into infinity I need to know for science reasons.</br>  <br>How soon until he turns on the Council and attempts a coup or joins up with Leo as head henchman?</br>  <br> not fine tuning the dimensions </br>  <br><br>It's more of a tech anyway, I have a weird use of outdated cards like Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge, and sometimes I can make a Ptolemaius&gt;Nova&gt;Infinity, at least with NK, with LS is what  say.</br></br>  <br> outdated cards <br> Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge </br></br>  <br>the only NK combo that goes into infinity on its own would be. Brothers +2 fillers into pto into nova into infinity. But even then why would you even run it in Nobles? When will you ever have 3 monsters on the field.</br>  <br>The problem with Ptolemaus is that it took a deck that was already incredibly easy and cheap (Rank 4 spam) and then gave it Rank 5 spam. Now, there's basically no reason to play CyDras because Tellars do it better, and that's just a very sad place to be.</br>  <br>I've seen plenty of NK decks that get three monsters on the field rather easily.</br>  <br>tbh I don't even know why tellars exist except to raise the price of good xyz's. Komoney pls.</br>  <br> Not Penduluming the dimensions </br>  <br>Could you post the Ygopro download link? I'm a devpro user.</br>  <br>Because fuck, designing cards is hard. Here, have a Stratos, a Tin Goldfish, and a Wolfbark. They're archetype-specific. That's an archetype. It counts. Where's my cocaine?</br>  ALL THE POSTS IN THIS THREAD ARE NOW OVERLAY UNITS FOR MY MONSTER  <br>ah good it's only rank 105<br> xyz encore </br></br>  <br>I wanna bang this girl but she is my sister</br>    <br>Who are you? Are you even a Yugioh character? Because of Overlay you couldn't have been in DM, GX or 5Ds and I know you haven't been in Arc V. Are you a shitty OC donut steel?</br>  <br>Err what about Zexal aka Yugioh XYZ</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>Never heard of it. Some kind of fanfic?</br>  <br>I wonder if there is going to be a remix of his OST, fuck that shit was awesome.</br>  <br>Because it's even more unsure where Jean will end up or what he'll do in the future. He tried to brush off the dimension stuff as nonsense in front of the council until he was called out by Azul, so he doesn't seem to be too loyal to his bosses.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Infinity can stay the fuck on the game for all I care, he can negate only once per turn and any beater can beat it, the one who deserves the ban is Trishula, no matter what form he takes, once broken, forever broken, and so, needs to be banned. And no, I don't care about the negate target effect, matter fact, that's another reason for it to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fusion: Leo <br> Standard: Yusho <br> Synchro: Jean <br>There you go, evil power trio.

The only reason her prediction for the match with Yuya didn't pan out was A) because he has some kind of fate-breaking power, as also seen by the Headmistress' crystal ball shattering, and/or B) it's difficult to properly predict fate using only one tarot card. Even if it was less than accurate, though, her ability to see the future would have been handy, and her ability to scry even more so.</br>   /a/ was afraid Crow was gonna steal the show <br> He still hasn't had a single proper duel yet <br><br>I know what they're doing.

I don't think her predictions are specific enough to be that helpful to the Lancers, and she'd be another head to keep count of and out of trouble.</br>  <br>The real reason is that Aoi Yuuki is expensive and they already have Kakki as pseudo main character.</br>  <br>Think how confused Jean-Michel would be, seeing someone ritual summon.

There was no reason to bring him back to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Huh? Jack is telling him the exact opposite. If anything Jack tells him to not use Egao dueling only to make himself happy so basically Yuya is supposed to go even beyond Egao and needs to entertain the crowd no matter how he himself feels. Which of course is bullshit, but that's exactly what Jack is doing as KINGU. <br>The only thing Yuya can take from this is being more persistent with his Entertainment dueling and just use it when he feels like it, which is also what Yoko told him</br></br></br>  <br>For all the crap he gets, Crow actually didnt win much at all in 5Ds. He jobbed more than Jack</br>  <br><br>This is just stupid. Arc-V Crow has nothing to do with 5Ds Crow and brining your hateboner for Crow to Arc-V is absolutely retarded. There is literally nothing wrong with Arc-V Crow</br></br>  <br>There is literally no reason for him to exist here either. Shinji could have easily taken Crow's role so far.</br>  <br><br>He didn't have a single loss in part 1 but in part 2 he jobbed quite a lot</br></br>  <br><br>The same logic Shinji has absolutely no reason to exist</br></br>  <br>No he didn't.

Give to me straight doc, does he have a chance?  <br>Because his ideals are retarded and not even his in the first place.</br>  <br>Yuya won't say ladies and gentlemen anymore. That's good enough</br>  <br>He'll struggle at first because of the riding aspect but I think he'll be alright.<br><br>He'll most likely lose, but his deck doesn't really counter Crow's and vice versa so it'll be fun to watch for the going back and forth part of duels people love</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm giving him 40%</br>  <br>The only way he's winning is if Crow lets him win.</br>  <br>There is one reason: They're in a fucking tournament</br>  <br> And then, appearing before Yuya, is a teenage boy with a card in his hand. <br><br>Inb4 Yusei</br></br></br>  Why is the construction of the overlay network so satisfying compared to other summoning animations?  <br>Whatever it takes for Yuya to start tuning like a motherfucker for the rest of the synchro arc.</br>  <br>They may be retarded but they are his, it's not wrong.</br>  <br>Because nobody tries to challenge them. The only ones who do are portrayed as the villains. For example, Kachidoki and his two pawns mocking Yuya's mindset are portrayed as douchebags. Sora rejecting EGAO is self-explanitory since he is currently a villain. Yuri will probably reject the EGAO too and he is the villain. Even Reiji comes off as a dick for saying Yuya's kindness won't do shit on the battlefield, which is true.<br><br>Now Jack will probably be portrayed as an asshole for saying that Yuya's ideology is flawed even though Jack is right.</br></br></br>  <br> They may be retarded but they are his <br>But his ideals are copied from his father.</br></br>  <br>It won't be Yusei.

That's literally his goal in this series. Especially because Jack is the guy who sold his soul to be rich and be used as a government puppet to entertain the crowds. <br>If this leads to anything at all it's Yuya learning how to show Jack true egao</br></br></br>  <br><br>It could be Jack calling Yuya out for his Yuzufaggotry.<br><br>Not that Yuya has really done anything bad as a result of his Yuzufaggotry</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Summaries also said the different ideals between Yuya and Crow would create hostility between them and it turned out to be a friendly joke duel.</br></br>  <br> I don't necessarily want to see Yusei return but if he appears just to give Yuya a card I'll be up for it <br>That'd be shit because it'd make Yusei look like an asshole for not doing anything else</br></br>  <br>If he's a Topfag in this dimension, why should he do something?</br>  <br> Not that Yuya has really done anything bad as a result of his Yuzufaggotry <br><br>He was willing to abandon the rest of the lancers in the jail to go see Yuzu. At that point he might of been willingly to inflict violence on Yugo and drag Yuzu back by the hair at that point. Yuya really needs to relax, he's stretching himself thin as hell with trying to be the De-facto leader of team baka, supervise a crazy shota, keep up the Entertainment ideal, try and rescue Yuzu and keep his promise to Mieru, the kids, his parents and his teacher, Yuto AND be as good, if not, better than his legendary father who discovered the method he duels with now. That's a tall order for a 14yr old with personality issues.</br></br></br>  <br>If he's a topfag why is he giving Yuya a card? And do people really prefer Yusei being back, but just being some random fuck who doesnt effect anything rather than just not existing?<br> The VA said he isnt coming back anyway and there's no way they wouldnt have promoted it the same way they did Jack and Crow </br></br>  <br><br>We have absolutely no idea what Yuya would have done after he broke out. That's all just your headcanon, anon.<br><br>I can't imagine Yuya not trying to take his friends with him when trying to break out or trying to break them out once he got outside.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the sound.<br>  it's the only reason why I watch all the Zexal 1 episodes  </br></br>  <br><br>No the VA said that he's busy banging Aki, not that he isn't coming back</br></br>  <br>DID SOMEONE SAY IT'S TIME FOR AKI-POSTING?<br><br>BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I HEARD SOMEONE SAY IT'S TIME FOR AKI-POSTING</br></br></br>    <br>Please no<br>Everybody gets unreasonably lewd when we Aki-post</br></br>    <br>Why on earth did this remind me of the MEATBALL PARTY, thing?</br>  <br>Dude, there's a reason why Crow told him to treasure his friends when he asked to be included in the escape.

I think there's a good chance it won't feature the Straw Hats at all, actually.</br>  What if the reason Zoro gets lost so much is because of Sandai Kitetsu  I have this theory about Sanji being from a place where all men act the way Sanji does<br><br>like ants or something. He'd be naturally strong, naturally hardworking with an inclination toward protecting 'queens'<br><br>he cant fight women because he's genetically hardwired against doing something like that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro's always had a bad sense of direction<br><br>He didnt get Sandai Kitetsu until Loguetown</br></br></br>  Post big mom's face when she opens fishman island treasure and the bomb explodes right in her face  <br>That's a pretty neat idea but it's probably not going to happen. I think it would really improve Sanji's current characterization just by knowing that he can't help it.</br>  <br>Oda already confirmed in an SBS that Sanji is actually incapable of hitting/kicking a women. He doesnt say why that's the case though</br>  <br>Did he? Now that I think about it did he ever get lost before loguetown? Like at usopp's and nami's villages</br>  I thought Zoro getting lost had to do with japanese traditional story telling where every hero had to be one minor flaw to not be utterly perfect, so most heroes got a bad sense of direction (because it wouldn't matter to them anyway since they'd just brute froce through everything if they needed to).  Doffyfags BTFO<br><br>remember when Doffyfags said Doffy was going to flee Dressrosa completely unharmed?</br></br>  <br>I just looked for some evidence but it seems Zoro didnt start getting lost until Alabasta<br><br>I'd thought that the reason he wasnt with Johnny and Yosaku was simply because he'd wandered off but seems that isnt the case. You might be on to something</br></br></br>  The curse is getting worse because he's had the sword for so long  <br>apparently Zoro set out to find Mihawk but got lost while looking.

I'm not very serious with my brushing either, I only brush my teeth when I feel my mouth is getting stale, yet I never ever got cavities. I went to the dentist last month for the first time in 5 years, still nothing.<br>It all comes down to what you eat and whether your teeth are genetically superior.</br></br>    <br>someone who hasnt been born yet obviously. my bet is on Sabo's kid<br><br>I'd also put money on Ace's 'will' being passed on to Makino's baby<br><br><br>did they x-ray your mouth or just poke around. If you don't floss, you'd likely have a cavity between each one of your molars. I had one really bad visible cavity(still do) but something like 15 between because I never flossed. Getting that fixed was a bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why can't Thursday come earlier? I've been waiting for a bounty raise, Kaidou, Doffy's eyes, Luffy and Sabo talking more than a few seconds, Sanji and the rest of the crew, or whatever should happen at the end of this arc for way too long.  <br> did they x-ray your mouth or just poke around. If you don't floss, you'd likely have a cavity between each one of your molars <br><br>I never floss and I usually only get one cavity a visit. Often times none at all<br><br>Anyways we should probably get back to One Piece<br><br>Are Luffy's teeth made of rubber?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's Doffy that is supposed to be a puppeteer. Why are there so many such pics of Cora and none of Doffy</br></br>  <br>Luffy's everything is made of rubber<br><br>rubber hair must be a bitch to brush. Not that he ever seems to bother</br></br></br>  <br>Brush your fucking mouth</br>  <br>Cora is voiced by the jap who voiced Donald Duck so Cora gets all the Disney crossover pics</br>  how do you go from this...  <br> Are Luffy's teeth made of rubber? <br>That sounds impractical. It's probably true though.<br><br><br>Poke around. I thought flossing was bad ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly it will probably catch up with you later, so be careful. A lot of people who don't get cavities have a predisposition for periodontal disease, which tends to hit at early 40s.</br>  <br>to this?</br>  <br>Ooh I see, thanks for the information.</br>  <br> I thought flossing was bad ? <br><br>what<br><br>why would you think that? Do you have a magic toothbrush that 360s your teeth for you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>training</br>  <br>  I thought flossing was bad ? </br>  <br>I don't know I just heard it was bad after all, my dentist never told me to do it and I don't know anyone who's doing it.<br><br><br>O-ok, I'll be careful from now on. Not that I wasn't, but still.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He will probably carelessly and almost unknowingly marry Boa. There will be a wedding and everyone will be there, while his one thought will be how great the meat will taste during the feast (that's what will probably sway him to agree to Boa's proposal). Then, we the readers will observe a hilarious chapter, where that night Boa attempts to finalize the wedding tradition, while confused and scared Luffy will run around the castle/home trying to hide... until she baits him with meat and catches him. Darkness rolls and mating is implied. Next and last panel we see what follows, which is Luffy laying in bed with Boa while rocking a huge smile saying "That's better than meat!". And that's where Luffy finds the true One Piece. The end!</br>  <br> &gt;my dentist never told me to do it and I don't know anyone who's doing it. <br><br>You're a eurofag aren't you</br></br></br>  <br> "That's better than meat!" <br> not happening </br></br>  <br>Well yeah, why, is dental floss just like circumcision ?</br>  <br>cant blame you for not knowing but you have literal shit between your teeth right now. Grab a string, rake it between your molars and sniff it. <br><br>Literal. Shit.<br><br>A toothbrush cant reach the area alone. your teeth are likely rotting from the inside out</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's Doffy that is supposed to be a puppeteer. Why are there so many such pics of Cora <br>Doffy isn't Japanese Stitch/Donald/Genie/Mushu/Beast/Don<wbr>key</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>MUH GAINS<br><br>But fuck leg day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No way I'm doing that if I know it's going to smell like shit.<br>I'll just buy one at the drugstore and give it a try.</br></br>   Where are you Master <br> This place is cold  <br> Why did you send me here  <br> I hate those shitty brats <br> Caesar is an autist  <br> I wanna go home  <br> Is Sugar acting like a cunt? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He left her there because he doesn't care about her</br>  <br>Is Bepo first mate and navigator? I hope we eventually find out why the hell Law's crew loves him so much. Too much?</br>    <br>Well, when Jean Bart joined, Bepo made a point to yell at him about rank, so Bepo must be up there. <br><br>My bet is either Bepo or Penguin are first mate.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would Ace's "will" be passed on to Makino's baby? I wish it's Shanks' baby, too.</br>  <br>I think he saved them all from various diseases for free on the condition they'd join his crew. <br>Do they really need a reason to love him though ? He's tall, dark and handsome, sometimes that's enough.</br></br>  <br>I kind of like the idea of Penguin being first mate for some reason. It's like Bepo's got his hands full being navigator already. But Law's all like "BEPO!!!" on Sabaody. I don't even remember how I found out Shachi's name was Sachi.<br><br><br>Saving them from some sort of disease or epidemic is possible. Although I'd like to believe they joined him on their own accord, but yeah, making it a condition to join his crew sounds kinda like Law. I mean Law's not super mean, but I don't think he's as nice as Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Could the same be said about Vergo ?</br>  <br> &gt; I don't even remember how I found out Shachi's name was Sachi. <br><br>Shachi and Penguin have only been named in SBS, actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Doffy and Vergo are both 41, that pic is inaccurate</br>  <br>Oh. Well that clears things up. Thank you!</br>  <br>i dont know why does Ace look just like Shanks?<br><br>why did Luffy get Roger's will?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh dear god this picture. Law is not amused!! Does anyone have the full image of this? Thank you!</br></br>  <br> why did Luffy get Roger's will? <br>Good point.</br></br>  So how far d'you think the Straw Hats would've gotten in the New World without the timeskip?<br><br>Surely they could've at least gotten past these losers, right?</br></br>  <br> what is an AU <br>Hey look, pic related is inaccurate too, that doesn't make it less awesome.</br></br>  <br>Maybe, this is their first fight where they didn't have much injuries. However, Luffy can still be defeated by Hordy though, because most of their fight is underwater.</br>  <br>I say they stop at the Punk Hazard Trio if they get enough rest between the Pacifistas and the Fishmen (Pacifistas were BRUTAL pre-skip), stop at the Fishmen without enough rest. I can't see the Fishmen being above CP9.</br>  <br>something like this i hope</br>  <br>Emerald City perhaps?<br>Whole Cake Island, Big Moms home with an Alice in Wonderland theme or Hansel and Gretel?</br></br>  <br>Try asking with less exclamation points next time.</br>  post yfw when Fuji shows Doffy tied up to the entire world  Thank you! Didn't notice the double exclamations, but okay.      <br>This pic just made me remember how shit tier Moria and Hody are compared to other villains</br>  <br>But Moria isn't shit tier? Re-read Thriller Bark and you'll see his mastered his fruit perfectly. When we see him again his will should be back to normal and he'll decide to fight on his terms rather than relying on his subordinates.</br>  <br> they wasted the Great white shark gyojin with hody <br>I know there can be more but the chance is low</br></br>  <br>he got his ass kicked by Jinbei in ~3 seconds during Marineford, he's shit-tier</br>  <br>Hody could've been so much more.</br>    <br>He ended up as a bounty hunter because he got lost looking for Mihawk</br>  <br>that's what I remember hearing but I couldn't find the page where it was said</br>    <br>I feel you, anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127760303 <br>Don't open any porn links</br>  <br>Even if they did win 90% of their crew would have died</br>  <br>implying the unconscious have a choice</br>  <br>You know Big Mom is gonna eat the explosion like a fat bitch.</br>  <br>If Luffy was a walking pair of tits like Bonney maybe.<br><br>The rest of Supernovas have survived just fine. At worst Kidd lost an arm but he probably likes it that way.</br></br></br>  <br>is it actually an explosive?<br><br>I alway figured it was the Dragon Palace box that makes you old when you open it</br></br></br>  <br> is it actually an explosive? <br>yes</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127760303 <br><br>Damn you anon, I don't know why, but I have this urge to watch the water 7 arc up to the revel of Cipher pol. It's been many years since I read that part in the mango and I never took much interest in the anime at the time. <br><br>Cooooo coo</br></br></br></br>  <br>You think so? Like I said I think they were weaker than CP9, who the Straw Hats did beat.<br><br>That said, I can see them winning just by attrition, considering Luffy wouldn't have the necessary Haki to drop the 50,000 fodder.</br></br></br>  How many people in the New World do you think are Doffy level or higher?  <br>Yes it is. And Big Mom will eat it in the same fashion Kinemon can cut flames. She can probably eat and digest anything, even explosions, cuz she ate the yadda-yadda fruit. Calling it now.</br>  <br>Only Yonkos and 2/3 Supernovas<br><br>Doffy is slightly stronger than a Yonko's right hand</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly? The Admirals, Emperors, Mihawk, Kuma, and Dragon. And maybe Magellan and the Emperors' first mates.<br><br>I'd find it extremely weird if someone between Doffy and this bunch shows up. Like, why would we not have heard of this person before?</br></br></br>  Sabo been pinging anyone else's Mary Sue-dar? He can apparently defeat Emperor commanders with a Fruit he's had for a few hours, and seems to be pretty much a saint in personality.  <br>Maybe the Mera Mera is just really, really OP.</br>  <br>Ace was pretty unimpressive IMO. The best thing he did was tie Kuzan, which was more due to his powers than him.</br>  <br>Sabo is the 2nd most powerful man in the entire Revolutionary Army. He's Dragon's right hand man. That was before he got one of the best Devil Fruits in the world.<br><br>He's Mary Sue, but it was coming, frankly.</br></br></br>  <br>I still think an Emperor commander, who's proven to have Haki, should be able to at least hurt him.</br>  <br> sabo <br> saint in personalty </br></br>  <br>How? Both (Sabo and Burguess) were kinda tied on haki mastery, add the fruit and you have Sabo having an overwhelming advantage, BB guy should be fine once he find a fruit that suits his brawler attacks.</br>  <br>For a shounen non-pacifist character he's as nice as you can get when he's not fighting his enemies.<br><br>I think the creepy look there is a side-effect of Oda's giving Sabo Luffy eyes that don't fit the rest of his more adult design rather than an intentional attempt to make him seem like a psycho.</br></br></br>  <br>He's just Ace 2. They could at least have shown him struggling with Burgess a bit.</br>  <br>They could've shown him struggling with the fucking admiral. All he did was make fugitora look shitty by having a draw.</br>  <br>Fuji was having the upper hand thou, however I just can't stop thinking Sabo handed an admiral just as the mother fucking Dark King handed Kizaru.</br>  <br>I prefer the Sabo-is-messed-up school of thought.</br>  <br>To each his own<br>I just don't see Oda going at that angle</br></br>  <br>But Sabo did struggle. They were tied, until at some point Sabo was like "stop holding back" and Fujitora did that "horizontal gravity" thing, after which Sabo seemed impressed/worried</br>  <br>Agreed I'm annoyed Burgess was in his re introduction arc.</br>  Gamma knife ruined doffys organs<br>He used his string to stitch them together<br>Once he's placed in seastone manacles will his stitching come undone his organs fall apart he,ll die on live TV and akainu will give fujitora a medal?</br></br>  <br>Sabo came out with more wounds on his face than Fujitora</br>  <br>It's ok I think, Kizaru &gt; all other admirals so Sabo was on par with Fuji but would've struggled against Kizaru.</br>  <br>It has to happen!<br><br> Doffy-fags BTFO </br></br></br>  <br>That's not Dragon Ball bruh.</br>  <br>Kizaru got man handled by that gay kid with the mohawk forgot his name it was like Miracle or something. He sounds like Ichigo from Bleach.</br>  <br> Kizaru got man handled by <br>No one yet, afaik.<br><br>Dunno who 'that kid with the mohawk' is, someone from Sabaody?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the fag from the war with whitebeard</br>  <br>You mean Marco the Phoenix?<br>His looks are a bit strange  yeah, he looks like a fag , but he's pretty fucking strong (he's Whitebeards right hand man).<br>I'd have to reread it though, dunno anymore if Kizaru really had problems with Marco. He was just irritated by his Haki if I remember correctly.</br></br></br>  <br> pretty fucking strong <br> one shotted by old man Garp </br></br>  <br>Garp's on a completely different level (even in his high age), somewhere around Rayleigh, Whitebeard and Sengoku.<br><br>I'm still sure Kizaru is the strongest admiral, he just doesn't care about becoming Fleet Admiral  he would've kicked Aokiji's and Akainu's ass with the speed of light </br></br></br>  <br>then why didn't Garp do shit in the war he just stood there crying the whole time</br>  <br><br> It's not my war to fight. <br> Let the youngsters have their fun. <br> New generation of pirates. <br><br>Something along those lines I'm guessing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>garp is still old as fuck</br>  <br>Are fans this retarded? Garp is suffering from dilemma during the war since he doesn't know which side he should take.</br>  <br>Never liked Doffy that much but it sucks that we're running out of characters that have been built up as a constant threat to the Strawhats throughout most of the story. We still have Blackbeard and his crew sans Burgess but they're obviously being saved for the penultimate or final arc.</br>  <br>There's a hojillion chapters between now and the end of One Piece. There will be time for buildup.</br>  <br>Alright, that settles it then. So he gets lost because he's stupid. That's reassuring</br>  <br>Burgess can still make for Franky's final opponent or something.</br>  <br>Why the fuck there's so little One Piece character with pepe edit like this?</br>    <br>Well that doesn't reveal much.</br>  <br>We still have Mihawk, kizaru, akainu, kid/apoo/Hawkins, the other supernovas, kuma, the yonkos (special mention to shanks and his crew), the celestial dragons themselves (plus cp0), the gorosei, vegapunk and for sure some other I don't remember.<br><br>On another note, about shanks and buggy being on Roger's ship: they have already been to raftel and shit, they know about the one piece, the will of D and everything. Then what are their goals? What's shanks goal? Why is buggy such a jobber? and why didn't the marines hunt them down?</br></br></br>  <br>/r/ing translation</br>  <br>if it wasnt such ass quality I could get a rough translation going</br>  <br> all of this yet Luffy still needed handholding from ~a thousand people to win this fight <br>Truly is pathetic.</br></br>  <br>Riku says is it okay being seen in public like this to Issho, Issho says something about justice, sorry too small.</br>    <br>You have to remember that not every one is all about treasure and stuff. Whitebeard's 'treasure' was his family. Shanks' is probably the hat too. Buggy wants to find Captain John's treasure, I believe.</br>   yfw three chapters in a row of nothing happening    yfw there is a marine ship with fujitora going to akainu to explain what happened on dressrosa and another one going to impel down with maynard <br> suddenly crocodile attacks that ship out of nowhere <br> he saves doffy <br> we see him again and hear his reasoning 400 chapters later <br>   He explains that Doffy died anyway because if Law's nasty attck </br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer three chapters of dialogue to 50 straight chapters of fighting.</br>  <br> yfw Croc makes Doffy eat sand and then create strings with sand. </br>  <br> he saves doffy <br><br> Croc makes Doffy eat sand </br></br></br>  <br>Jinbei was stronger than Luffy pre-timeskip though, so its reasonable.</br>  <br>Where is the proof of this assertion?</br>   finally get around to watching strong world <br> that final battle </br>  <br> You think so? Like I said I think they were weaker than CP9, who the Straw Hats did beat. <br>Hody was stronger than Rob Lucci; and I don't exactly know about the other New Fishman Pirates but they were also pretty strong after taking their roids (probably stronger than the rest of CP9 in the end)/</br></br>  <br>Moria could also have been weakened from TB<br><br><br>We saw what he could do to Luffy in FI. Without any haki at all, Luffy would be in a bad position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By comparing their capabilities.</br>  <br>What is your defintion of "nothing happening"?</br>  <br>Perfect soundtrack too. I replayed that shit so many times</br>  Any chance we're going to find out what the fuck happened to law's crew anytime soon?  <br>Fujitora put very little effort into that fight and used it as a diversion for later use. Sabo even commented on this. Even with this in mind, Sabo came out of the scuffle all roughed up and cut/bruised while Fujitora was unscathed.</br>  <br>Sabo is not on-par. He's not far below, but not on-par.</br>  <br/>  Speculah theory: Lets say some animal/being eats some DF user, does this animal/being gain its DF power as well?<br><br>Since the DF is practically a part of the user and all.</br></br>  <br>Marco did shit all to Kizaru; he's even joking/mocking him of how weak it was.</br>  <br>And then later on Kizaru almost shot him dead.</br>  <br>What do you mean? They're waiting at Zou just as Law said. We'll see them shortly along with the rest of the Strawhats.</br>  <br>No ? If the User dies while being eaten, the fruit goes to a nearby normal fruit. Same thing if the user is being digested inside the monster. <br><br>You gotta pay more attention bro</br></br></br>  <br>Even Oars was more menacing than Moria and Hody just plain sucked, he was nothing<br>that being said Crocodile and Enel are still the best in terms of being antagonists, Lucci was a great fight but as an antagonist he was lackluster</br></br>  <br>Unlikely, because after being eaten the user would die, thus leading to the reincarnation of the DF elsewhere in the world.</br>  <br><br>He also got distracted in the middle of a damn war and let a Vice Admiral cuff him.</br></br>  <br>I never noticed how weird his face looked like in this opening.</br>  <br>Oars was menacing because he was just so unstoppable and rekt shit for ages. Moriah had the capability of taking down an akin giant solo (minus the other interventions here, he still could have taken down Oars Jr I imagine).</br>  <br>Even Spandam was a better antagonist than Lucci, I have a soft spot for villains "that you love to hate"</br>  <br>They may have gotten rekt, but as long as they weren't killed then hordy and his crew would have aged in theend so that they would be forced into defeat.<br><br>But isn't he protected by his bloodline?</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, Spanda was kinda cool looking too.</br>  <br>He's protected by the secret. Someone in a previous thread was saying that covering his mouth was unnecessary but think about it. He can't say shit now and no one can hear him in Impel Down. Fuji's got this in the bag.</br>  <br> But isn't he protected by his bloodline? <br>Why would he be? He is not a Tenryuubito any longer and only had leverage over the WG due to the secret of Mariejois he knows. He was shunned and rejected by them even after executing Homing. He is no more than filthy trash like anyone else.</br></br>  <br>But is he stronger than the Great Captain Buggy?</br>  So, tomorrow we have chapter or we don't have chapter?  <br>We do.</br>  <br><br> Makino's baby <br><br>More like the farmer girl's, you know he tapped that up. <br><br> THE BLOODLINE LIVES <br> Akainu's face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moda goes back all the way to East Blue to give the baby to Makino.<br>"Give him to Daddan when he's like 7. Cya, got a business to run"</br></br>  <br><br><br>Explain Teach then.<br><br> Inb4 Darkness is the only DF that can store DF powers </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But last chapter had Sabo finishing off Burgess, a bit more of the Revolutionaries shown, Doflamingo and his executives being apprehended by the Marines, Riku having everyone want him to return as king, Fujitora bowing to him and apologising on behalf of the World Government for letting such treachery occur with their system in front of the world, etc. I get this "nothing happened" meme is overused, but at least use it when it's semi-applicable.</br>  <br><br>Right, thanks for clearing that up.</br></br>  <br><br>... and him having to definitely decide between not hurting a woman and saving his nakama.</br></br>  <br>Teach didn't eat Whitebeard though ? And Marco fucking went out of his way to say "his body is weird".</br>  <br>It's been obvious really, and I've seen it this way all along:<br>When the DF user dies, the fruit respawns into the nearest corresponding fruit in the world to it (canon). Blackbeard knows the DF information book off by heart, and likely knows all the corresponding fruits. He took the Gura Gura's fruit with him to Marineford knowing that one way or another Whitebeard was going to die. Upon his death, the fruit morphed into his and he went under the cloth to mask the process he used (since it seems to be unknown even to the WG perhaps). Evidence of this is how Burgess can also knowingly kill a user and acquire their fruit. All Blackbeard then did was proceed to eat the Gura Gura.<br><br>How he has two is another matter, but how he got the fruit itself can be logically and canonically explained. This method was likely also used by Doflamingo to get the Mera Mera, as he has Caesar as a subordinate (who knows of this process), and since it was Ace's execution he likely just took the corresponding fruit on hand along with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly he took some Oranges with him just in case.<br><br>Or is it a Mandarin?<br><br>The squigly flame pattern doesn't really make it easy to recognize the fruit itself.<br><br>Ope Ope is definitely Strawberry, since they both look like hearts and Strawberries are actually fruits.<br><br>But the weirdest thing is that Bananas aren't actually fruits, but legitimate berries, and we share some of our genes with bananas as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oranges most likely. Aren't berries a type of fruit though? I don't think Oda would get too technical with it all.</br>  <br>Ope Ope could also be a peach. I read somewhere that it might be parallel to the Immortality Peaches in Chinese mythology. I can't remember where I read it though.</br>  <br>The wiki.<br><br><br> Bananas <br>I really don't think Oda would give two shits about such technicalities. I mean the main dude is blowing air through multiple bones in every arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably nothing happens again this chapter<br>except cliffhanger<br>"one piece on break next week"</br></br></br>  <br>Well meme'd my friend</br>  <br>Well, two fruits for Blackbeard ale pretty self explanatory - his flag has three heads, he'll probably het a zoan, a logia and a paramecia, because of his weird body.<br><br>One thing I find stupid is - if Blackbeard came so prepared to Marineford, as to even have a fruit for Whitebeards death to get, wouldn't it be better to get Ace's fruit too? It was his execution, but he didn't have it with him, since we find out Doflamingo somehow got it.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe BB can't have two fruits of the same type?</br>  <br>No excuse, Kizaru was shooting the key when WB attacked him from the rear, and guy still dodged.<br><br><br>Teach of the 100 Devils sound scarier thou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally - I think he can, he just doesn't want to. It's more shonen to want to get three strongest DF from each class. Now he has the best logia and the best paramecia - only thing left is the best zoan.<br><br>He can create earthquakes and black holes that take in gravity and DF powers... what would match these two in terms of raw, physical animal power?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I know he was a jobber himself, but Marco's would be pretty useful.</br></br>  <br>I always assumed it didn't involve him actually eating the second fruit. <br>My guess is that his black hole bullshit can drain devil fruit powers before they manage to find a new fruit.<br>I mean, he wouldn't obsess over obtaining it if there was nothing more to it than its raw power.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Doffyfags <br><br>I always hear this, but I have yet to see one doffyfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Chopper's fears were justified and human Zoan is the one BB wants </br>  <br>Since because of his logia he actually gets MORE hurt than without it, I think Marco's fruit wouldn't work for him... probably?<br><br><br>Yeah, there must be a reason he got to Whitebeard's ship and went first for the logia, and didn't even think about the old guy's paramecia. Maybe there really is something to it, something that lets him do more than just attack DF's without haki.<br><br>Maybe BB will get some rare, special SMILE zoan DF? Since Ceasar created a SMILE dragon DF, it's probably possible there exist other ones.<br><br>The closer we get to Kaidou, the more I start to think it's the end game for the series - it'll be a long arc, but it'll probably end with BB getting a zoan, and then maybe an arc or two later we'll get to One Piece and the final fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What benefit would it give him though?</br></br>  <br><br>It should work - it isn't 'unlimited', but Marco's fruit just regenerates him, it still takes the damage.<br><br>So it would help BB I assume since he would at least regenerate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that will be Oda's chance to explain what he meant by "if you eat a Zoan of your own species, you become enlightened."</br>  <br>Except through the whole arc Fujitora was bluffing and under playing his strength. He's a skilled gambler after all.</br>  <br>So it'd give him the ability to fly and to regenerate his damage. From what we've heard, BB is a real monster - the guy has a logia that makes him a lot weaker to ANY attack, but he can tank Whitebeard's and Ace's attacks easily. So, maybe he's not looking for regeneration, since he was aware of this and could've attacked Marco too, when he was on old man's ship.<br><br>The funny thing is, some people forget that BB was able to kill a guy that was on Marco's, Jozu's and Ace's level BEFORE he got his fruit. He killed Thatch like it was nothing - shows how strong he is. It's just that so far we've always seeen BB as careless - he let's Ace and Whitebeard attack him, let's Magellan poison him, but we never really see anyone defeat him in a fight.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because everybody is a Doffyfag to some degree.<br>Well, maybe me moreso than the rest.</br></br>  <br><br>Well he can already tank the damage, being able to regenerate a large amount of it too would make him ridiculous.<br><br>Like, he already has enough destructive power - he should look for a support Zoan that can make him untouchable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it bad that I would like to see a lengthy filler arc about his crew past exploits?</br>  <br>Look at the guys they lost to and ask yourself again if that's a good thing.</br>  <br>The thing is, we knew he got the logia, because it was the only one he needed - he was ready to put his whole life to live on Whitebeard's ship for years, just to get it.<br><br>We also know he got the Quake fruit, because it was the most destrucitve one in the world.<br><br>As for the zoan - we had no info about this. He never mentions what he'd want, we only know he wants One Piece and (probably) can take three fruits. So it's all speculation - best bet is that Kaidou is closely tied to BB plan of getting the best zoan there is. Maybe even better than Marco's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it means you have good taste.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, I think it will be tied with Kaido's for all means of the story.<br><br>Marco's was an example - I was just talking optimally, rather than what will probably happen.<br><br>There's other ones too - but any tanky support Zoan would make him ridiculous as he already tanks enough damage due to his special body, and he has the destructive power from his logia and the Gura Gura.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Maybe... there's a zoan that lets you be immune to seastone? I mean, Marco's problem was, that after he was cuffed, he was useless. If his logia was to attack everyone, his paramecia was to have the power to attack everyone, maybe his zoan will make him as immune to most possible attacks as possible?<br><br>fuck, I don't know - I bet Oda has some obvious way and we'll all feel stupid after it's revealed. As always.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would there be a zoan like that ? A fish Zoan ? You fucking suffocate when you're on land and you fucking lose all your powers at sea ? It's probably going to be a Hydra or Cerberus or something.</br>  <br>Luffy aims at becoming the pirate king though, his main goal is not—even if he dislikes them a lot—beating the blackbeard pirates.</br>  Would you want Robodad to be your dad?

We've also got DameDesuYo and Vivid as the fansub options for the show.<br><br>After a pre screening in Japan a few days ago, someone wrote up a summary of the first episode: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa The most important piece of information to be gleaned from this appears to be that, due to the original GG author being the showrunner of the anime, it appears the anime will move events around e.g. something that happens in Volume 4 happens in the first episode.

Taroumaru bring stuffed toy with a beard and cause licking Yuki. Although tries to wake everyone, there are only Yuki to bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of Yuki where Yuki has established a dressed. Yuki is running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. Encounter with the OP after Megu-nee. "It's not Megu-nee" scene. Then follow arrived for the school life club. It has been modified to the scene to eat rice morning by adding the Mii-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of first volume. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Mii-kun is not liked by Taroumaru. Rii-san is scold Taroumaru. Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. Yuki toward the classroom for day duty. Here it can be stopped by to Megu-nee. Shadow is thin (and censored?). Conversation ① of character of image and its entourage two people and the classroom. ② teacher also appeared. <br><br> Start of classes, as beginning one Volume and even though it is sleep in class, such should be in class junior of Mii-kun comes to the classroom. Yuki can say as no good to come because during class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Mii-kun visited because gone is Taroumaru. Yuki to Mii-kun "Mii-kun are tense. We'll got to nervous from entering the senior" says while walking, but is immediately denied. Looking Taroumaru from here. Yuki say that unraveling tensions in Mii-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Or it is closed windows could not be confirmed, but it was a deliberate sound effect) Here Taroumaru barking of. Headed in the direction in which voice is heard. Here A part end. After there is CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story </br></br></br>  <br> While chasing Taroumaru he go towards the barricades of the desk but then turn to classroom before the barricade. Mii-kun also tries to enter the classroom, but is stopped and is said to be during class to Yuki. Confused look of Mii-kun. Mii-kun to enter the classroom from the greeting. However Taroumaru escape without being grabbed. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taroumaru is directed to the roof. There are Kurumi and Rii-san, Kurumi is joined to said capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel, again Taroumaru distant foot race. But Taroumaru is I get angry in that entered the rooftop garden. Angry also other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life club knowledge part. Because it Tarou capture, scene change to school life club. <br><br> Put lead in Taroumaru. From here the contents on page 11 to page 19 combined content. Yuki is to classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Mii-kun became worried to act alone was also to be chasing after Yuki. "I like school recently" part. Yuki to be arrive in the classroom and conversation to the characters of ① about Taroumaru. Between here Mii-kun is coming, but as disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of where Yuki roughness of pages 22-23 is at classroom and Mii-kun is a at classroom door. Yuki that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall with Mii-kun, the wind blows. While the wind raging since windows and close the window because it left open has broken windows. So face of Yuki becomes up ed rush. <br><br> ED after the next episode notice <br><br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Taroumaru <br>Why is the anime trying to make this useless dog so relevant? <br>He had almost zero appearance time in the manga yet the anime makes him out to be "important".<br><br>Or is this just going to be a one episode thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've got some fresh news for you but I'll post them several hours later.<br>Also wanted to remind that the scriptwriters here and in Gunslinger aren't from Nitroplus - if you see somebody in the staff with "Nitroplus" in brackets that doesn't always mean that they are from that company. All of them are hired by Nitroplus to writer the scripts for the anime, and several of them are freelancers (Norimitsu, Sakurai, Higashide).</br>  <br>*to write</br>  <br> Miki is coming in early <br> that Shiba Inu is alive <br><br>Look, I'm fine with turning events around, but Miki should've been added around episode 3 or 4. This is most likely gonna backfire really hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They're probably making the dog more relevant so that it's death has more impact </br>  <br>If this thread survives the day, it'll be better than several people making threads right before it airs.<br><br><br>It is possible that the dog is another of Yuki's tulpas.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories <br>Maybe they're planning to get rid of him in the 2nd episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you're only thinking in terms of a 1:1 adaptation. If they handle it well, I could see them changing things up in the anime.<br><br><br> I've got some fresh news for you but I'll post them several hours later. <br> several hours later <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be awkward if the dog is a part of the main cast. I legitimately can't tell from that translation whether the dog is part of  Yuki's delusions  or not.</br>  <br> It is possible that the dog is another of Yuki's tulpas. <br>And that's why they were searching for him for almost the entire episode?</br></br>  <br>I'm at work now and the thing I'm going to post about is at home.</br>    <br>What number of hours are your several hours?</br>  <br> bad idea to do three shows in one season <br>Yeah tell that to A-1 as well. Last season was absolutely trash.</br></br>  <br> Dem OPs <br>Cute little girls doing cute things in a SoL school life show. What could possibly go wrong?</br></br>  <br>2 hours maybe?</br>  <br>OP ED Lyric when?</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>I refuse to believe anything can be as horrible looking.<br> this is supposed to be a slow panning service shot </br></br>  <br>I also think that Tanomaru just Yuki's imagination.</br>  Yuki = Glenn<br>Kurumi/Shovel = Daryl/Crossbow<br>Yuuri = Rick<br>Miki = Carol</br></br></br>   LolisRDead <br><br>Keep calm.</br></br>  Maybe that was a introducting epsiode and we see Miki's rescue (and backstory) in the following episodes...  <br><br><br><br><br>Yeah, that's another possibility. I was thinking it would be a flashfoward of sorts, but that seemed weird with the dog.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>re-link chapter summary<br><br>btw, the comic anthology to be release in a few day is subtitled stable?</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't get Ushiki to make an illustration, dammit</br>  <br>Not sure if it's actually such a big deal but at least it's something official.</br>  <br> subtitled stable </br>  <br/>  <br>Where's it from though?</br>  <br>From the one of the writer's site.</br>  <br>He was supposed to have been a goner from the start though, making his death have more impact is pointless.<br><br><br> survives the day <br>Yes, another thread that starts around the time i sleep. Every fucking time.<br>Though i do agree its best we can discuss the pre-air of the anime before all the anime only fags arrive.<br><br>And no, i doubt the dogs a tulpa.<br><br><br>I'd rather know what the ED is more than that.<br>Why do they not preview the ED for anime.<br>I usually like them better then the OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which?</br>  <br>Didn't they want to make the anime something that can even surprise the manga readers? <br>Giving the dog a bigger role is probably just part of the spicing things up for the veterans ploy, he might even survive if Norimitsu feels like it.</br></br>  <br>Because the ED is by Maon Kurosaki so it will likely be more edgy ergo a spoiler. It's something similar to this:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TGG<wbr>qH1jeicg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>For one thing, I get suspicious the instant I see a dog in a series like this. If I didn't know any better I could see it working, which is probably what they're aiming for.</br>  <br>Well until i see that he's done a good job all he's managing to do is make the manga readers nervous. I get that the whole before thing could definitely have been explained a little more, but i just really don't want him to play around with it too much and screw up.<br><br><br>Well, aslong as its edgy i don't mind.<br>I just don't want something happy or passive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well until i see that he's done a good job all he's managing to do is make the manga readers nervous. <br>The impressions from the pre-screening on twitter from people who had read the manga were all positive, though.</br></br>  <br>I can see a ED with sad faces,loneliness,rain and the like</br>  <br>Because it ends exactly like the first chapter of the manga; they just extended it because otherwise it would have been 20 minutes of nothingness.</br>  <br>I'm still wondering if they changed how the whole apocalypse thing is revealed, i mean if they didn't then i can't see the manga readers being too surprised.</br>  <br>It's true... They must have extend the story to that "real world" scene will fit the end. <br><br>Without it that scene happen to early. So they need some "slice-of-life moe fun" before the shit hit the fan.</br></br></br>  <br> Though i do agree its best we can discuss the pre-air of the anime before all the anime only fags arrive. <br>Just as long as nobody shits up the threads using animeonlyfags as the excuse like in the JwWw and MonMusu threads.</br></br>  <br>I suggest not to use the term "secondary", because it will make anime only fags go apeshit, if the past is any indication.</br>  <br><br>I know, i have nothing against secondaries. Its just that i want to be able to discuss the series before i get yelled at every 2 minutes for spoiling them.</br></br>  Why is Mii-kun so sexual?  <br>Look at it that way if he gives the dog a bigger role with more emotional attachment but still let's him get infected down the line they might scratch the shovel part altogether. Wouldn't shovelfags in the whole fandom rejoice if she might be able to survive in the anime canon at least? <br>On the other hand it removes one of the big simmering future conflicts although I don't have a clue how far they will come pacing wise anyway. The graduation feels like a good cut-off and it would feel odd without it happening then, but who knows how far he wants to change things up.</br></br>  <br>Resident secondary here<br>I'm thoroughly excited for the show and don't mind spoilers at all. Once this show is over, I'm picking up the manga.</br></br>  <br> garters over panties </br>  Ararararararararararararararararara<wbr>rararagi-san</wbr>  <br>lets skip the discussion and declare Hachikuji best girl from the start this time. then, after, we can talk about the actual anime.</br>  <br>No arguments here.</br>  They are all best. <br>By all, I just mean these three, of course.</br>  She's 20 something years old, why does she remain in the form of a grade schooler?

Makes me wonder now if she watched Bakemonogatari because I knew she watched anime, but she was always so shy to discuss it with anyone.

I don't remember the name but that one had a different picture every time. In this case I'm assuming it's a slightly related old reference. Neat.</br>  <br>So are they just going to throw in minor characters that never appear again in the ED?</br>  <br><br><br>back to tumblr</br></br></br>  <br>Balance Doll</br>  <br>Nice meme</br>  <br>Lewd version</br>  11 minutes before subs   [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 279 [720p].mkv <br><br>It's out!</br></br>   Image dump begins                 <br>Pandemonium-san is my waifu.</br>  A cute    A cute     Gedomaru OST <br>Nice, it's been a while<br>I'm waiting for the episode where they'll get back the Stand arc ost</br></br>        <br>They used one of the songs from the stand arc in the reunion arc.</br>      <br>Is the quality good like last episode? Or is it QUALITY-infested again?</br>    And next week   never read into the manga this far <br> dat plot twist  <br>HYPE</br></br>    I laughed the most for the realistic close-up shot of sukonbu.  <br> the most fanservice Gintama has is of male characters. </br>  <br>There's fanservice of the female characters too though.</br>  <br>Is Gintoki the worst executioner of all time? One of the people he tried to execute even came back in the current manga arc.</br>  Now that I think about it, wasn't there a law against carrying swords in Gintama?  <br>For most people yes. But people affliated with the Bakufu or with a certain status (like the Yagyus) are permitted to keep their swords. Everybody else are screwed.</br>  <br>Of course government people would be allowed to. But the Reaper was walking casually around the town with a sword, without trying to hide it, even before the murders started. That should have made her stand out even more.</br>  <br>There are also supposed to be Amanto walking around everywhere. It's best not to pay too much attention to what's supposed to make sense in Gintama.</br>  <br>The arc where they make them all go back was too racist to print, so they skipped it.</br>  <br>back home*</br>  I need more Kondo butt  Sudoku    <br>Wow, that the fuck.</br>  Hopefully this arc will have a good ending unlike the others this season.  <br>It will.</br>  <br>Based Yabuki.</br>  <br>A lot of people walk around without the permission to carry swords. I'm not sure why, but I guess they only really care if you get caught using it by the police.</br>  Right now I'm starting the anime and plan on just reading the manga when I get to the last episode (so far) and then watching each episode. Is the anime pretty close to the manga?  <br>Latest chapter in the manga is 548, while the anime is jumping around animating the chapters from 400-500, shifting around the order of arcs.</br>  <br>Then so episode 1 is around chapters 400-500? Or do you mean that lately they're jumping around chapters?</br>  <br>With the newest season. Current season starts with episode 266, but is actually animating chapter 484, and then jumps around animating chapters in the early-mid 400s.</br>  Does anyone have the media player classic opening screen versions with Gintoki?
