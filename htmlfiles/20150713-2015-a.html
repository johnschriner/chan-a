[ So the latest chapter was interesting to say the least.<br><br>Keith explained a few gray areas but also created a new one, what the hell was Eren's Dad doing on the outside of the walls? Where did he come from? Was he from a human comunity outside the walls more advanced then the inside of the walls? He seemed to have had more advanced medical knowledge.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if his time in America is where he got the idea for 3dpd Shotawin.</br>  <br>He got it from a music video.</br>  <br>That guy doesn't fully look like Erwin to me.</br>  <br>That's what Isayama said though.</br>  So do we have a status chart for ch 71?  Does anime make you happy with your life?  <br>Yeah listening to the OST for the series is good too, I especially liked Legend of the Martial Artist when reading HxH, even though it was kinda spammed during the show at times. It allows you to be the director for your own experience.</br>  <br>More like it makes the sting of real life harsher.</br>  Not really. It's mostly a distraction.  Yea, it made my life great. Before my life was all about was grades and making money in high school. That being said, i didnt really get to appreciate high school. Or even college. I did hang out a lot, but i felt like i did it just to keep my network big. A year ago I was stressed from work and tried some anime series and omg. I fell in love with it. It destresses me and helps me appreciate life more. I watched and read a lot of slice of life anime/manga such as nisekoi, non non biyori, koe no katachi, nichijou, daily lives of hs boys.. list goes on. Made me realize what i missed out on. I recently went to my friend's party at a park in san francisco and i was only able to appreciate it because anime made me realize how much fun i can be having irl also. The golden gate bridge was more beautiful that the thousand times ive seen it before. Anime made me appreciate life more ^____^. <br><br>Also, other anime such as shokugeki, one piece, naruto, kuroko.... The competitive ones where they try to be number 1, try to be the best makes me want to work harder in my life goals! so much better than western cartoons where "trying your best" is enough. and we should just have fun... winning is fun. and working on what you love is fun! (IMO)</br></br>  <br><br><br>Faded = Drunk &amp; High<br><br> Learn your terminology, anon. </br></br></br></br></br>  With legs like these, who needs boobs?  <br>Nice try, Kumiko.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wKs<wbr>waXC1FwU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  This shit is not funny  <br>Wrong board buddy.<br/></br>  Are you going to post the contents?

HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK  <br>this</br>  <br> fate <br> good <br>Better than this shit, yes. Are you too stupid to understand my point?</br></br></br>   God Eater <br> A psp game <br> A monster hunter clone <br> A monster hunter clone got an anime <br> A clone got an anime(full series) before Monhun <br> Out of all the monhun clones this one gets anime <br> Not toukiden soul sac or freedom wars <br> God eater <br><br>Yeah, it's pretty shit. Like no joke, the source material was bad too, but his is just shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UFO <br><br> what? <br>The studio making it newfag.</br></br></br></br>  So since the Holy Grail couldn't make his wish come true, instead of making another wish (to revive his wife), he kills his family and destroys the Holy Grail?   WTF?    Special delivery for /a/!  <br>What about this one?</br>  <br><br>I'll take them both, thank you.</br></br>  <br>That isn't my dragon dildo.</br>  <br>Use this instead</br>  Whilst the their counterparts are the opposite, thin arm Puchis &gt; fat arm Puchis  Holy shit, has there ever been a worst Opening song than Parasyte's?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yy1<wbr>BShbtVOQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I mean, FUCK.<br>I dare you, /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  All the shit taste in this thread<br>Fear and Loathing and Maximum the hormone are better than 90% of the generic jpop openings out there.</br>  <br>Fight me m8. Both openings are amazing.</br>  <br>Is that Squid Girl dressed as Index?</br>  <br>dam this brings back memories, I don't even think it's been a year<br><br>truly being a hxh fan is the worst</br></br></br>  <br>Not being able to appreciate this is as sure a sign of being a musical plebian as any. I'll bet you also hate Trout Mask Replica, because it's "weird."</br>  So NT13 getting translated when?  Which Dragon is your favorite and why?  <br>The one who fucked up Izzard</br>      What should imouto call her brother?  <br>Has the fandisc ever be translated?<br>I want to read this shit again now</br></br>  nigger aniki  <br>never ever be translated</br>  teme  kyodai or get the fuck out.  Madoka Thread.<br><br>Also, thought I'd ask: Has Rebellion been given the Meduka Meguca treatment yet? And if so, why can I not find it?</br></br>  I'm going to start Mamiposting<br>Theres already too much homu in here</br>  <br> That was the point where Homura came to the conclusion that, once again, She fucked it up, and this time, she couldn't do jack shit about it. <br><br>If that was the truth she would have turned into a witch IMMEDIATELY after being dropped out of Madokami's dimension in Ep.12. Epilogue, where she understands Madoka's intentions and wishes and decides to live honoring them woudn't have been possible.<br><br> It's only natural that she snapped and went to incredibly extreme measures in order to keep Madoka safe and happy, regardless of the costs to herself. <br><br>"Costs to herself" are besides the point, though I wouldn't call "becoming a nigh-omnipotent being that can do whatever the fuck she wants" a "cost". She imagined that Madoka is unhappy, counter to Madoka's own words, because SHE was unhappy without Madoka, and decided to enforce her version of happiness on Madoka, by stripping away memories, character development, everything that did not fit her image of Madoka and trapping her in a comfortable cage. People kept under tight guard with electrodes constantly stimulating pleasure centers in their brain can be called "safe and happy" too, but I doubt that anyone would want this sort of safety and happiness for oneself. Even Homura herself understands, deep down, that it is not at all about Madoka, it is about Homura, that's why she calls herself the devil. <br><br>In short, Homura is the character that was assassinated the hardest in the Rebellion, though Sayaka and Kyubey are not far behind. If you like Homura as a character, not just as a fap material, you should not like the Rebellion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hey,  !Akemi.  Be stoked for the YuukiYuuna thread that's going to be made later today.   <br>Go Mami poster, your drills will be drills to pierce  Madoka </br>  <br>I'll join you.</br></blockquote>]
