It doesn't help that there's nothing else to discuss.</br>  <br> I waved my hands and declined the offer. If she does any more and I suffer even more body injuries, I’ll become used goods and I’ll have to have you take responsibility and take me for a husband. But wait, that’s actually my goal all along… <br><br>Biggest flag for senseifags.<br><br> ;^) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complain about people discussing things and that there's nothing to discuss in the same post <br>Now this is shitposting.</br></br>  Where is 8man's left hand going?  You wouldn't a Mikan  <br>or because it's not real you fuck nugget</br>  <br>I see you're trying to get the last saying in the argument, that's classy</br>  <br> maybe your dad will give you that hug you always wanted. <br>Projecting isn't healthy, of you're so desperate for your parents approval you should do something about it</br></br>  <br> FUCK I LOST WHAT SHOULD I DO <br> I KNOW ILL KEEP SHITPOSTING SO EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD GET AS MAD AS I AM RIGHT NOW </br></br>  <br><br> HEY I KNOW HOW TO STOP A SHITPOSTER FROM SHITPOSTING, I'LL KEEP RESPONDING TO HIM! <br><br>You and everyone else in that conversation is a fucking moron.</br></br></br></br>  I FUCKING KNEW IT<br>She's all talk and no substance.<br>All bark and no bite.<br>Anyone with half a brain would know Anna was the real pervert.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the different? They have hearts in their eyes? It's unnatural.</br>  <br>this one is new.</br>  <br>From the thumbnail I thought that was the pink-haired Brynhildr girl.</br>    <br>Not gay, honestly. They look unnatural. If those characters with those eyes existed and you tried talking to them, they'll just rape you.</br>  Would you a Suzuya?  <br> that ring <br> Im not sure if i should but if cucking is allowed id cuck the husband </br></br>  <br>In Nagasaki?</br>  <br><br> you will never have cute destroyer loli's deliver you pizza. <br><br>why live.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Samidare is cuter.</br>  <br>What is Shiranui</br>  SAY<br><br>MY <br><br>NAME</br></br></br></br>  <br>Acting kinda shady</br>  <br>Willy Wonka?</br>  Someone called me???  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>     Watch first ep <br> MC cheats his way into an elite school and drives a lorry at a girl to manipulate her into falling in love with him <br> Awesome, this guy isn't the typical beta male protagonist <br> Ep2-4 just does what the invisible girl tells him to do without doing any scheming or offering any input on these plans <br> Why Japan, why? <br><br>Seriously what's wrong with being an anti-hero?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon posted in portuguese for some reason<br><br><br>Link? I'm curious. It's very weirdly written, it looks like it was google translated from english or some shit</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 1: <br>First 15 minutes, MC not a beta faggot, smart, uses powers wisely in his own interest. Last 15 minutes: Whipped straight-man for a design-by-committee gag show.<br><br>Episode 2:<br>Whipped straight-man for a design-by-committee gag show.<br><br>Episode 3:<br>Whipped straight-man for a design-by-committee gag show.<br><br>Episode 4:<br>Whipped straight-man for a design-by-committee gag show.<br><br>I'm seeing a pattern here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tomori was jealous the MC, just because he was delighted with the charm of Yusa.  In this anime, what is the number of characters who are ruthless, good-looking, and care about their siblings?  <br><br>This justifies <br>leap time displayed in the OP.</br></br></br>  Could Vegito reach Super Saiyan 3?  <br>Just gonna leave this here for ya. ;^)</br>  <br>Whats with these sudden DBZ threads flooding /a/?</br>  <br>Just yanking your chain. I'm surprised Vega Tale is still even alive. What's the point of his existence anymore? He might as well be Yamcha at this point</br>  Could he reach ssj10?  Cell can.  What changes do you want made for this upcoming remake and why?  Imoutohime when?  <br>She was created with Earthling properties, on Earth, which is why Shiki can see her lines, so while her ancestry isn't Earth based, she's still technically Earthling.</br>  <br>Probably soon since they chose to omit the secret Sacchin route.</br>  One thing I would like to add to this is Crimson Moon offered Gaia himself as a model for the true ancestors only in exchange for him to be able to live on Earth in order to take it as his own kingdom. He didn't just do it out kindness.  <br>In other words, you are full of bullshit, since the fact nature created them means they are natural beings. So if God creates humans, humans are artificial?<br><br>Arc wasn't created. Nasu said she was extracted from nothingness using a method CM taught them. The TAs didn't "make" her as if she were a frankenstein monster.</br></br></br>   Don't you wish your papa was hot like me?   <br><br>They were legit in the year 1812 when the heaviest artillery ordinance was on a man o'war. They're not legit today, they're a ridiculous extravagance at the expense of taxpayer money that the JSDF didn't even need to fend off some 200k+ troops anyway. But lets just build the motherfucker anyway to show dem stupid Americans that forts shouldn't be made out of trailers and crates - even though the JSDF could be ordered to abandon the base and RTB at any time.</br></br>  How mad are you that Tomato-kun gets the fuck Booze every night while you can only jerk off to her doujins?  <br> brain-damaged <br><br>Hate to defend Chibi Usa but SMC and the manga both go into further detail as to why Chibi Usa behaves the way she does despite being 900 years old. It's understandable at that point.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't be mad<br>she don't have doujins<br>none of them do<br>I'm more mad at that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish there were doujins</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>A lot of people rate part 5 as being really high because of the fights and 6 as being really low, I wonder why that is. <br><br>So lets get a consensus on part 5 vs. part 6 only. No 1-4 or SBR universe. Just Golden Wind Vs. Stone Ocean.<br><br>Which to you think had the better:<br><br> Jojo <br><br> Villain <br><br> JoBro <br><br> Team <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128636362#p128636362">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but Doc posted this a while ago.</br>  <br>Okay. Thank you.</br>  <br>Meant for you.<br/></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure time erase was still active when Bruno was punched, the background was still dark in Diavolo's monologue.<br><br>And the blood thing is kind of iffy, seeing as how blood is counted as part of your body. until it dries that is. I meant like what he did to get his daughter out of the elevator, or to Narancia, or breaking the gun in erased time. As opposed to him not touching anything when we do see him erase time.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks pucci</br>  Reminder that we still have 10 more songs this season, not including the character songs we haven't heard yet.<br>Who else will get character songs this season?<br>Do the dolls get songs?<br>How long until the training montage song?</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's lewder things that require her attention than an old hag trying to get into a young girl's panties<br><br><br><br>You might as well say that a goldfish doesn't appear to own a bicycle</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> That is what she's been doing for most of her life, yes <br>She also spent a lot of her life sitting in a cell waiting to get raped again.<br><br>I'd say hanging out with some occasionally lewd friends is a major upgrade over anything else she's done previously.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> shipping <br><br> Maria and Tsubasa <br><br>I dunno did you ship your mom with your dad?<br><br>It'd be about as obvious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense when the original tune was composed with vocals in mind. You are saying an incomplete version is somehow better.<br>Please kill yourself.</br></br>  Would you consider this anime?  <br>Here's your reply m8</br>  Is this anime? <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ETw<wbr>8pBZ3xSo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No, I'm pretty sure that's because Japan had a far bigger influence on than anybody will care to admit</br>  <br>That may be the case but do you not know the stereotype of the French being sex freaks?</br>  <br>In france, that's an Italian stereotype.</br>  https://dreamscopeapp.com<br><br>Let's have some fun /a/</br></br>  <br>Kumiko has transcended.</br>    <br>That looks really cool</br>    <br>Best obaa-san</br>  Why does she wear the shorts?  <br> wings <br>She's a God anon.</br></br>  <br>She was basically turning into an angel.</br>  <br>Kakine and Accelerator grew wings.<br><br>Mikoto turned into some weird...thing. Alot of Nuit imagery as well, and Nuit certainly isn't an Angel.</br></br></br>  <br>They cared enough about her as a loli to map her DNA and make a clone army.</br>  <br>I haven't really read the latest novel.<br><br>So she's Magneto now. Kamachi really has a hard-on for cliche super powers.</br></br></br>  Did nothing wrong  <br>No, just that ones introduced so far are all males. I will laugh my ass off if Issei doesn't have a single daughter.</br>  <br>I would fucking cry.<br><br> Although the more boys, the more they can repopulate the entire universe. </br></br></br>  <br>Koneko/Kuroka should be a safe bet.</br>  <br> Quarta <br>Wait, Issei hooks up with Sister Griselda? What?</br></br>  So Akeno is the first huh?</blockquote>]
