Or at least a wider audience/not gunota.</br></br>  <br> Yoshino is writing the series and the code geass director is directing it <br><br>Unless Yoshino comes back to work on Mai-Hime continuation/new series then the leak is bullshit <br><br> Then my hopes for Sunrise to work on a new Mai-series is real </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First people thought it's going to be because Tomino was saying how he wants it to be enjoyed by younger generation, then it got really late timeslot and obviously kids aren't watching it in the middle of the night. Then he explained something like "G-reco will be understood by kids better than adults" but who knows if that was just his usual ruse. Maybe he meant that kids have much more open-minded way of thinking compared to adults, nevertheless G-Reco was the first Gundam show to air in "otaku timeslot".</br>  Would you shave her anon?<br><br>Also, god bless Lerche for the best adaptation this season.</br></br>  <br><br>Cerea, Miia and Mero are the only girls I know of who had a "if I had a kid with Darling" panel.<br><br>Mero's was kind of boring, which is a shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mero's was the best one.</br>  <br><br> That look on Rachnee's face. <br><br>She's up to something devious and I don't like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fur <br> furry </br></br>  <br>She is furry, but she's not a furry.</br>  Best girls that aren't even girls  I hope you haven't missed these two anthologies that got uploaded a few days ago.<br> http://exhentai.org/g/831124/2d41a1<wbr>a7c5/</wbr> <br> http://exhentai.org/g/831284/7ee2f4<wbr>e765/</wbr> </br></br>  <br> tfw still have them open in tabs <br>Hung trap 2stronk<br><br> Thanks again qt </br></br></br></br>   draw a girl <br> call it a girl <br> but it's actually a boy <br>I love it.</br></br></br>  <br> draw a girl <br> call it a boy <br> &gt;but its actually a girl </br></br></br>    what is it about Haruhi that gives her that raw sex appeal?  she's such a smug sexy bitch and she'll force you to have fun whether you like it or not faggot  <br>It's called talent, she did Konata aswell.</br>  all the Haruhi    <br>Crowds S1 was after her "everybody but the bassist" thing.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127808<wbr>792/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  https://twitter.com/AkioOtsuka/stat<wbr>us/619604474022096896<br><br> コジプロは解散させられてしまったが、チームの奮闘により作品はどうやら<wbr>ほぼ完成となった。掛け値なしに最高の傑作となった筈！早く「待たせたな」<wbr>と言いたくて仕方ない(笑)これが最期になったとしとも…MGS は 不滅 です！</wbr></wbr> <br>コジプ...<br><br>Every source I see keeps translating どうやら as "evidently" rather than "just barely or "somehow" or something like that. To me it reads like he's saying that against all odds the game has managed to achieve near-completion, which is consistent with the troubled development history, whereas other sources translate it as "the game has apparently been nearly completed". When どうやら means "evidently" it usually seems to be paired with らしい or そう or thereabouts, so I don't think that's correct.
