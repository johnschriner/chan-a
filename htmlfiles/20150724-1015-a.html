[ The new dragon ball reminded me that I feel really bad for Videl.<br>She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell, but Gohan is actually a massive faggot who hates to fight.<br>If only she had been born 2 decades before, Goku could have ended with her instead of that insufferable bitch called Chi-Chi.</br></br>  Episode 3 got a 7.0 in ratings. As figured, last week was just a bad week for pretty much all the normal top 10 shows  <br> Told Goku if he gave her the Dragon ball she would let him see is panties, she thought he was younger than 12 <br> Flashed Roshi for the Dragon ball <br> Almost fucked Oolong on the spot <br> Tried to fuck Yamcha the moment she met him <br> Tried to fuck the gay general of the RR army <br> If any hot guy appeared she would get her pants and had to be reminded she is in relationship with Yamcha <br>PURE SLUT<br>I bet Vegeta simply fucked her too hard or beat her at least once to take out the slutiness from her,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Piccolo essentially being infant Pan's nanny <br> insists he's just doing it as a favor to Gohan but is really protective of Pan <br><br>Just in general the idea of Mr. Satan, Buu, and Piccolo all taking care of Pan is adorable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying the universe wouldn't be retconned into whatever the hell Toei execs want <br>See comics "events" like Crisis on Infinite Earths or Flashpoint</br></br>  <br> mfw Krillin/Jaco fight on the level of Usopp/Chopper vs. Mr. 4 and Ms. Merry Christmas </br>  Old Thread <br><br>Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>OC stands can go here &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/<br><br>Okuyasu is best BroJo</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>Oh you're right.</br></br></br>  <br> that Avdol <br>never<br><br>Perfect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saying thanks again for new wallpaper doc</br>  <br>I'd fuck that Abdul tbh</br>  What if being defeated was exactly what Doffei was aiming for ?  <br>fuck, i mean elmy's introductory chapter<br>10 pm = brain todt</br></br>  <br>Also the fact that the way Sanji and the crew are fucked right now, what thing could possibly save them from Big Mom's crew?<br><br>The only bullshit I can think of is the Lola card that Nami can pull.</br></br></br>  <br> looks like Ryuuma <br>I can't really argue that although both were made very early on and both were swordsmen <br> Ryuuma personally gave him his sword <br>Because Zoro is a good fighter? I can't see what evidence that gives, he didn't just hand it over.<br> Ryuuma is depicted defeating the Sunflower Knight at the end of Monsters. <br>Mihawk is a very outright mirror of said defeated opponent, with sunflowers literally drawn on his clothes.<br><br>This is where I really can't see it. Cyrano was a scumbag who was destroyed by Ryuuma and was a thief. Mihawk is none of those things and his relationship with Zoro in no way mirrors Ryuuma's with Cyrano.<br><br>I'm not the one you replied to, nor am I trying to go out of my way to disprove your theory, your basis just seems off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He looks like Ryuuma. <br>Not really solid enough. That was hundreds of years ago. Young Roger looks like Luffy and they aren't related.<br><br> Ryuuma personally gave him his sword. <br>That's quite debatable actually. The Arrow Notch Slash move, personality, laugh and voice are Brooks. How much of Ryuuma's personality was really in there? It was Brook's shadow. I'd wager that it was a mixture of both.<br><br> Ryuuma is depicted defeating the Sunflower Knight at the end of Monsters. <br> Mihawk is a very outright mirror of said defeated opponent, with sunflowers literally drawn on his clothes <br>Definitely a good detail but were not entirely sure how long Monsters was a part of One Piece. Could have been intended from the start. Could have been an idea he had from much later.<br><br>I'll be honest, I don't hate the idea. There's just not really too much going for it. I guess soon enough we'll get more clues if there are any.<br><br><br>I'd like to check if the phrasing is exactly the same in Japanese for both instances. If it is, I'd definitely take that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Laffite has that.

Very original.   <br>haibane renmei, tex, amagi brilliant park, lain, tatamy galaxy, algel's egg, and hibike euphonium</br>  Why even participate in the Grail War when people can summon unbeatable demi-Gods like Gilgamesh? He only loses to plot-convenience, asspull shield of fairy magic and "Ea is too good for you".  Yadayadayada once in a lifetime opportunity yadayadayada some root yadayadayada mage's pride yadayadayada associated artifacts aren't necessarily easy to find so you might luck out yadayadayada  Because most heroes are more balanced, and the chance of him being summoned is fairly low out of all the other heroes and means of obtaining catalysts.  Why is she so cute?  <br>Less Umaru being a fucking bitch is always better, so yeah.</br>  <br> those funbags <br>I want to slash them off with a samurai sword and then make fun of her accent.</br></br>  <br> Ebina's accent <br>Too perfect.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch, why you have such a  magnificent  taste?</br>    Check the guide before posting:<br><br>Http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Her face looks like shit, but how can you ignore day body?</br>  <br>Oh my lord, how much cum do you think that mouth can hold?</br>  <br>Ignore that poster.

Shirou's abilities are just broken but everything is hinted at or is thematically consistent. Gilgamesh is an owner of weapons who just spams the shit out of them, Shirou projects enough to counter and he gains the skill and technique of the original owner of said weapon. Gil's got no skills and he's an arrogant fuck.<br><br>Also Fate isn't shonen.</br></br></br>  <br> It was never foreshadowed <br>The Cell saga made it clear that there are levels past regular SS and this was after a time skip.<br><br> only exists as a way for Goku to have a chance with Majin Buu. <br> who is Gotenks? <br>Nope Goku never beats Buu with it and if Toriyama wanted Goku to have a chance against him, he could have easily done so without SS3.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> exodia decks will never be good </br>  <br>Hunter x Hunter is complete generic shit that occasionally makes pathetic attempts to shock its little kid audience by doing the opposite of what's expected, even though that's still cliche.<br><br> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HH THE MC IS TRAUMATIZED THIS SHOW IS SO UNIQUE AND DEEP</wbr> <br>Fuck off back to Tumblr.</br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday to best sensei!  <br>Karen is the only hetero slut.</br>  <br> Shino <br>She's just a pervert, but she's faithful to Alice in serious moments.</br></br>  I hope Alice and Aya hook up soon.  <br>This is first time I've heard of that ship.</br>  Why is everyone so gay   It's time.   <br>Only watching for the detective.</br>  <br><br>Mako-chan?</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone's watching it for the trap butt. I do like the ridiculous cases though and hashiba's homolust is entertaining enough</br>  <br>Togashi draws his traps with the male features he tends to use for males, and Kurapika doesn't look like a girl entirely, but could be mistaken for female.<br>Can't think of any others right now.</br></br>  <br><br>Kobayashi isn't any more girly than Kurapika though.<br><br>Honestly people use "draw a girl" wrong pretty often. It's more like the characters look androgynous especially when they are young and when people find them cute then they must look like girls to them.</br></br></br></br>  Clips that make you want to watch their associated anime?  <br>Took me 5 seconds to get the name.</br>  <br>A-Channel</br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Like  said, it was actually there and I'm just retarded. <br> Don't feed retards. </br></br></br>  <br> For  (You) <br> For you. </br></br>  <br><br>grisaia</br></br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-23/monster-musume-anime-r<wbr>eveals-cast-for-lala-draco-kii-lili<wbr>th/.90798</wbr></wbr></wbr>    <br>She's voiced by Sento?</br>  <br> At this moment, no matter what happens, <br> If I’m with you, I’m O.K. <br> I can already tell, without a doubt – <br> This has to be the greatest journey in the whole universe! <br><br>Why I have so much feelings right now?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, maybey</br>  <br>Episode 12 can't come fast enough.</br></blockquote>]
