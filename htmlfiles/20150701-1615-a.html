She's the one who first brought it up that there was a DNA test.</br>  <br>please be true, I would fuck evil judging by her nails</br>  <br> And now she's lying again about Karin being the mother. <br><br>Nah. She was honest about the DNA test, then SS freaked out, so she said she was lying, but in reality she was lying about lying.</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy your ban. <br><br>Also anyone that wants to discuss the spoilers.

Doesn't matter. <br><br>Don't reply to shitposters and report them.</br></br></br>  <br>See the third line<br><br>Be persistent if you want to get what you want in the face of corruption</br></br></br>  <br>SASUGA<br>A<br>S<br>U<br>G<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know if it's legit, but there was an interview with Kishimoto leaked a few months back where Kishi said if it were up to him, Sasuke would have ended up with Karin, but the problem was Karin's lack of popularity compared to Sakura.  <br>I hope she's not lying. I would be pretty mad if she is.</br>  <br>that was legit</br>  <br>Don't think it's true.<br>And I wanted Naruto to end up with Karin.</br></br>  <br>Because you want things to be different<br><br>Everything points to Sakura being the real mother but you secretly hope that Sarada has at least Karin's DNA</br></br></br>  I'm beginning to wonder that Kishi got the entire DNA plot after browsing forums  <br> Kishi liking Karin <br>Didn't he say in an interview that he thought of hemorrhoids when writing her powers?</br></br>  <br>Inb4 she is mom of Suigetsu's kids.</br>  <br>that was written with google translate japanese. takl and other translators saw it was fake</br>  <br>Nah. <br><br>Suigetsu didn't give a fuck when the DNA test came out. <br>Dude doesn't care, he likes chopping people</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything points to Sakura being the real mother </br>  <br>Does this mean we can finally make Yuru Yuri threads bannable? I hate those faggots.</br>  There was this baseless SS rumor going around for the Bolt movie about SS having a boy named Saizo.<br><br>It would be funny if this was true but the one having the new Uchiha kid is Karin.</br></br>  <br>Her power is causing hemorrhoids in every Sakura fan.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413917 <br> If I was ever going to end the story with romance I had been planning to let Sasuke end up with 香燐 (Karin). In the process I decided to make her a member of the うずまき一族 (Uzumaki-clan) <br><br>KISHIIIIIIIII</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, I see, never mind then. carry on.</br></br>   I would love to see him doing something like a 10 year time skip though, and only few of the kids still around, with Sarada and Boruto as the protagonists in a crazy, post-apocalyptic world where all the adults were slayed by some uber-powerful enemy - think of Future Trunks' in DBZ, that sorta thing. But really, I don't think Kishimoto would ever go there... unfortunately. <br><br><br>Why is mangastream filled with such shit taste</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Kishi really needs some balls</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>That was bs you fag, even nips in 2chan were laughing at it.</br>  <br> wants to make her Sasuke's love interest <br> puts her in the same family as Naruto  <br>what the hell man</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>I can pinpoint the moment he tried the NaruKarin thing. <br><br>I hate this popularity stuff</br></br></br>  <br>I got it... Blood Transfusion</br>  <br>So, this the power of no editors</br>  Dont forget to report these threads  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127413963 <br>Do people still fall for bs interviews?</br>  <br>if you feel like i do, you just really want sasusaku fans to go full meltdown<br><br>also...i guess karin teaching her daughter salad how to autopsy corpses and hide lock pick sets all over her body is a nice image.</br></br></br>  <br> [pottery intensifies] <br><br><br>That could work. Somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I don't keep up with these things very much. I'll just delete it so it doesn't get quoted by idiots looking for straws.</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised sakura has fans. How the hell people could like her?</br>  <br>I can't stop crying when thinking of what could have been if Kishimoto didn't have to mantain Sakura and Hinata around. Well not Hinata because she's barely relevant and 10 chapters out of the entire serialization are about her but still. <br><br>Makes me wonder if Naruto could've been a really good manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Chakra chains are the shit and you want SScucks to be salty and butthurt until the end of time.<br><br>Also because nobody wants Pink Shit 2.0 from Salad.</br></br></br>  <br>That was some random speculation from the Boruto movie site having a countdown timer for a secret to be revealed some time around July 28th and somehow the first thing that was conjured up was a kid for Sasuke and Sakura.</br>  <br>She's main girl. <br><br>People like main girl, doesn't matter how she is. Look at Taiga in toradora</br></br></br>  <br> Skrillex will never be your waifu </br>  <br><br>Amifag please</br></br>  <br> K <br> A <br> R <br> I <br> N <br><br> I <br> S <br><br> M <br> O <br> M </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying taiga wasn't best girl <br>Amifags still mad</br></br>   karin is mom <br> when salad meets her shes pregnant with sasuke brat #5 and there are a bunch of salad looking siblings running around bc sasuke's dick never gets a break  <br><br>i'm only dreaming though, i just want ss fans to be as mad as possible.</br></br></br>  <br><br>THE HEART<br><br>NO EDITORS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Adult Karin is a qt.</br>  Has evil posted any spoilers apart from this? she did say she wanted to troll the ending, so she could still be lying.  The real spoilers will be out in 24 hours, right?  <br><br> she literally is wearing Sarada's school girl outfit </br></br>  <br>Rai is the most reliable but doesn't know Japanese so he can only tell us his own interpretation of the panels.</br>  <br> I don't know if it's legit, but there was an interview with Kishimoto leaked a few months back where Kishi said if it were up to him, Sasuke would have ended up with Karin, but the problem was Karin's lack of popularity compared to Sakura. <br>Kishi probably wanted Salad to have Chakra Chains. So maybe this is his roundabout way to get it?</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, kishi is a confirmed faggot.</br>  Someone 'cracked' Evil's message.<br><br>Collect the first letter of each sentence. <br>Then you get the letters: kaarihinpitsmgonm<br><br>When you unscramble it, it reads<br>Spoiler: <br>Ha, Karin isn't mom, pig!<br><br><br>No I'm not kidding either, that's really what it reads when you unscramble it. <br><br>Bolt is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Karin <br> loli Karin <br>It's not even up for debate in this panel.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if Hinata got main character development, that shit would have been tight.<br>Also karin replaces sakura in basically every way and does it better. Shame kishi has no idea how to write girl characters, though.</br></br>  <br>Because Pink is a shit character and is a shit mom to Salad?</br>  <br>If Salad has chakra chains then that just made pic related a whole lot more interesting.<br><br> Also doujin potential just went up by a factor of ten. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Come on, you really think she's that smart?</br></br></br>  What if Sarada is Karin<br>/kubo</br>  <br> Because Pink is a shit character and is a shit mom to Salad? <br>Also because she has nothing to offer genetically. She can teach Salad everything she knows skill wise, but genetically Sakura had nothing to give.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this, cuckura has shit tier genes.</br>  <br>Why is it team taka stayed super hot but the konoha ninja look awful? cus hot damn, Karin has become hottest girl.</br>  <br>Orochimaru</br>  <br>Best health care plan</br>  <br>That could become the default answer for a lot of things in this series</br>  <br><br> Karin is Sakura's daughter <br><br>ultimate cuckold</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering the kind of "development" that the main characters received, Hinata's irrelevance is almost a blessing in disguise.</br></br>  <br> Why is it team taka stayed super hot but the konoha ninja look awful? cus hot damn, Karin has become hottest girl. <br>Because Oro had been researching eternal youth for decades, and there is probably enough discoveries that are safe enough to use on the other members of the lab by now.</br></br>  <br> Combo Ougi with Boruto <br><br>SHIP CONFIRMED! HYUUGA EUGENICS CONSIPRACY PART 2!</br></br></br>  Sarada is Karin's clone as saskue and sakura's adoptive child  <br>It's too obvious, but the again she's a evil troll so who knows.<br><br>Personally, the self-destruct, Orochimaru arriving, and another Chouchou joke about her dad, now with Shin, all sound possible, so whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Also doujin potential just went up by a factor of ten <br> Uzumaki stamina  <br> Uchiha perseverance with just a dash of DARKNESS-induced crazy <br> Raiton for electroshock play <br> chakra chain BDSM <br> kinky bite play that heals him so he can go even longer <br> Shadow Clones </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop spreading shitty tumblr lies, faggot</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Yet she's the strongest girl BY FAR in the series (behind Kaguya and probably Tsunade/Mei) <br>All of those have magical bloodline superpowers. <br><br>Sakura is great in that point anon, nobody can deny that. I don't like her, but she has my respect in the fact that she can claim she punched the shit out of kaguya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The person posted who "cracked" the code missed an I at the beginning of a sentence and threw in a G from genjutsu which did not begin any sentence, they're an idiot.</br>  <br>It was fake.</br>  <br>AND* there's the fact</br>  <br> implying there was ever any doubt </br>  <br>Temari gets shit done.</br>  What if Sarada is product of Sasuke attempting to create shadow clone to pleasure himself, but he's too dark that shadow clone literally become real?  <br>that was done by a ss fag, there was no g at the start of any sentence<br><br><br>self insert</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her punching kaguya was bullshit and you know it.</br>  <br> It's too obvious, but the again she's a evil troll so who knows. <br><br>It's possible she made it obvious after saying "What if I said that Sakura is the biological mother?" But that's assuming she's encoding anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure but can you deny the fact that she's stronger than any other kunoichi aside from the ones I said.<br><br><br>Yeah I really like Temari but she is weaker than Sakura. She's the second strongest I think tho.</br></br></br></br>   <br>league term for killing the all the enemy team on your own</br>  Apparently the last time Evil put a bunch of fake spoilers and a real one. The real one turned out to be "Obito teleports back from the dead"   tfw karin probably wont chakra chain swing in like spiderman, make out with sasuke and steak salad's heart in order to ruin the sasusaku fans day like i want her tofeels bad, man    Sarada is actually a experiment of Orochimaru using Karin egg and   Madara's  DNA<br> But he decides to stop it becuase Combining Uzumaki and Uchiha only seems to produce girls in 100% of the experiments <br>rate theory guys</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Even more shit about Sasuke?</br>  <br><br> Still believing that shit <br><br>Fuck off, Fujoshi, just because you are projecting your failed homo ship into these kids, it won't make it any more canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine Sakura punching Kaguya as two neckbeards heavily involved in a DnD game, playing Sasuke and Naruto respectively.<br><br>However, one of the neckbeards has a girlfriend, who doesn't really care about stats or roleplaying but got dragged to the game.<br><br>Sakura's player rolled a natural 20 in the end of the campaign, then rolled a natural 20 on the confirmation, and another natural 20 after that.<br><br>Hence, Kaguya got punked by "that guy"'s girlfriend. RNG too stong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hetero ship <br> fujo <br>Fujoshits hate Bort and Salad precisely because they see it as Kishi "giving in" to the hetero, anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Still pushing the eugenics meme. </br></br></br>  <br>Sakura got that hard work going for her, which is pretty neat. However in terms of defending against her clumsy but powerful punches, kunoichi who are either long range, can counter abilities based on precision chakra flow or just have superior dodge/stamina like Temari, Hinata and Karin would all have the distinct advantage.</br>  <br>Oh c'mon there's no doubt Kishimoto is doing that. He's so fucking predictable</br>  <br>Wut? What homo shit? We are talking about Kaguya 2.0 as possible MC for Naruto GT.</br>  <br> From "cool bad boy" to deadbeat father that goes missing for 12 years and doesn't even recognize his own daughter </br>  <br> "The DNA of the Number 1 Unpredictable (Ninja, Naruto's nickname) is strong (in me)!!!" <br> Gaiden is all about cloning and genetics <br> implying it's just a meme anymore </br></br></br>  <br>Eugenics has staying power, anon. The series is built on gene shit, so it's just to easy to joke about it.</br>  <br>Karin could Seal her for a little while but that's it, she has no way of harming Sakura and then would eat teeth soup.<br><br>Hinata stands no chance, she hits the points and they regenerate. Sakura Punches hard and breaks her skull. <br>Temari cuts her but she regenerates, moves forward and punches her really hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The real one turned out to be "Obito teleports back from the dead" <br><br>This is likely true.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying Boruto isn't the walking flagship NaruSasu children <br><br> Implying they aren't into BoruSasu already </br></br></br></br>  <br>DNA is the name of a band.</br>  <br>You don't regenerate points nimrod. Hell you can't do anything because your chakra is sealed off.</br>  <br> liking skrillex </br>  <br> failed homo ship <br>From what it seems Naruto and Sasuke are going to spend nearly all of Naruto GT either with each other or babysitting the other's kid.</br></br>  <br>That's the beauty of this series, it's so fucking stupid literally anything can be a spoiler</br>  <br> she hits the points and they regenerate <br>she heals chakra points and makes chakra control unstable, which means no regeneration</br></br>  <br>The chakra using Byakugo doesn't flow normally idiot. <br><br>Stop wanking Hinata</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Naruto ends up kidnapped. He can't babysit anyone. Plus Hokage so even less time for him.</br>  <br>That just means the eugenics meme failed given that Boruto doesn't consider his Hyuga genes to be worth shit.</br>  Just one more day and I can post my collection of cringeworthy "KARIN IS DEFINITELY THE MOTHER" posts in order to make fun of all you gullible fools who fell for Kishi's ruse. <br><br>Though many will deny it, there is no such thing as a person that does not get a smug satisfaction rush out of the simple act of saying "told you so".</br></br>  <br> Hinata stands no chance, she hits the points and they regenerate <br> and they regenerate <br> chakra flow is cut off <br> regenerate </br></br></br></br>  <br>He spent the entire gaiden babysitting Sarada.</br>  <br>She posted 5 spoilers then stopped, with KARIN IS MOM being last, so that might be it.</br>  <br>Go ahead and post them already, it's obviously a ruse.</br>  <br>And when Karin is the mom, we'll never see you again because you'll be too ashamed to hear it yourself</br>  <br>Are you stupid? Byakugo doesn't work like that. It's the fucking seal that's giving the power up.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone but one guy is expecting Sakura to be the mother. Whether they wish for it to be otherwise or not.</br>  <br> Naruto is actually another "We are actually inside a MMO" story </br>  <br> Boruto doesn't consider his Hyuga genes to be worth shit <br> what is Lightning nature </br></br>  <br>But Kakashi's friendship-powered intangible perfect Susanoo from beyond the grave done with no sharingan wasn't?</br>  <br>There is no evidence to support this</br>  <br>chakra points can't be regenerated once sealed off, we know this because Naruto got his points sealed off before and couldn't regenerate to get them to open up again, instead he needed to force them open with Kyuubi's chakra. <br><br>Sakura's ability to regenerate requires her to be able to use her chakra, and Sakura doesn't have a whole lot of chakra, put two and two together.</br></br></br>  <br>A day's worth of babysitting is hardly anything. Meanwhile Sasuke is actually going to train Boruto which will take a while.</br>    <br>64 trigrams decimates the chakra flow, cutting off Sakura's regen and power long enough to knock her out. <br>Karin has complete eternal regen from biting herself and drawing on Uzumaki chakra, and sealing/detection abilities to avoid the fists. Sakura's disadvantage is always gonna be her low speed and reliance on pure chakra/dmg output. She's most effective against armies and groups rather than single opponents.<br>idk if she can still resist Ino since she lost the split personality thing.<br>The real game changer would be her summoning Tsunade's slugs imo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce is still missing his arm?</br>  <br><br>When Karin is the mom, I will saddle my winged pig and fly down to hell in order to ice skate.</br></br>  <br>I added this to my collection of SSfags for the day the truth is revealed.</br>  <br> Implying that chakra nature won't be associated mainly with Sasuke. </br>  <br>Something Hinata never used in the series?</br>  <br>The villains had done so much bullshit, I was not even surprised. Meanwhile Sakura kept getting owned every time she tried to 'help'.</br>  <br> Sasuke is his mom </br>  <br>he didn't want another arm.</br>  <br>she still needs to control it and she can't do that if her chakra network is fucked</br>  <br>The only relevant Hyuga was Neji.</br>  <br>It was never stated that, Byakugun works like using pressure points. Its not an actual seal.</br>  <br>Yeah I can see it.<br><br> Boruto pulls the chidori in the chunnin exams the exact same way Sasuke did in his. <br> Everyone in the crowd goes "That sure is Hinata's kid" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes it was, but we weren't talking about kakashi were we.</br>  <br>yes and ss fags are super pissed about it</br>  <br> Boruto is introduced as Naruto's son <br> meanwhile all the other kids are introduced as two characters' children <br><br>Possibly.</br></br></br></br>  If Sasuke were female, nobody would say Boruto was Hinata's kid.  <br><br>Everybody on /a/ already got out all their rage last week though, or did you miss that?<br><br>Most of the responses you're gonna see this week if Sakura is the mom will be "meh, what a waste" so I think your glorious opportunity to wallow in some sense of victory has already passed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Might as well be</br>  <br>Chidori = Lightning = Sasuke<br><br>That's the main reason why Sauce will teach him shit. Don't be surprised if they never mention Hinata in the equation, even though by logic Boruto inherited his lightning nature from her.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Hinata kinda is a female Sasuke.</br>  <br>More like<br> "Oh another one of these faggots. Where's his onesie?" </br></br>  <br>Apparently Minato had lightning nature too.</br>  <br><br>The people who raged last week were those who were too dumb to understand that Sakura's strength isn't an inheritable trait. Surely there is a lot of overlap, but there are still enough people left who think Karin is the mom. Just look at the reaction ITT when evil's "code" was cracked.</br></br>  <br>if sasuke were female naruto would be a much better series.</br>  <br> Plus Hokage so even less time for him. <br>Didn't Tsunade and Hiruzen and Tobirama all train people while they were hokage? And Nalt is serving during a time of peace, disregarding the sudden appearance of Edward Rinneganhands I honestly can't imagine what the fuck he's been so busy with.</br></br>  <br>kek. No she isn't</br>  <br>Self destruct seems to be the true one.</br>    <br>Yes. <br><br>They cut her body chakra, not the chakra she has sealed APART. <br>She would just keep on regenerating the SAME WAY NARUTO DID.<br><br>Jesus christ stop wanking Hinata. Hinata stands no chance of touching her anyways, go watch Sasori fight again. <br><br> Low speed <br>Watch sasori fight again<br>Karin also can't keep biting herself. <br><br><br>You said it yourself too, Sakura has Katsuyu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madara or Hashirama should have been female so they could literally be Ninja Romeo and Juliet</br>  06/30/2015, still no sign of Chouchou being in the movie.  <br>They have the basic storyline, minus the edge, and muh vengeance.</br>  <br>only in the way she wants naruto's dick in her.</br>  <br>I guess a susano arm would be viable</br>  <br>Naruto winning the day and giving TNJ sounds likely.<br>So does Shin self destructing.<br>Kabuto raising the rest of the shins sounds good.<br>Orochimaru being himself also sounds likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good. I've had enough of that fat parrot.</br></br>  According to Evil, this guy is showing up this chapter.<br><br>We might see Kabuto and his snake penis.</br></br>  <br> Sauce and Bort enter the arena in the exact same fashion as him and Kakashi did with leaves and everything <br> a recovering Salad pops another tomoe from sheer butthurt </br></br>  <br>It's very possible.</br>  <br>Naruto didn't regenerate, he used the Kyuubi chakra to force his gates back open. There wasn't anything to regenerate anyway</br>  <br> Jesus christ stop wanking Hinata. <br><br>srop wanking sakura<br><br> Watch sasori fight again <br>the one where chiyo did most of the work?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ironically, Hinata actually has Ligthning affinity</br>  <br>No, that's Salad. Even the captcha agrees with me.</br>  <br>Fight is over.<br><br>Hinata almost died to Zetsu and Naruto saved her, she had to go all out against mini-jubi jobbers</br></br></br>  <br>Who's this again?</br>  <br><br> Surely there is a lot of overlap, but there are still enough people left who think Karin is the mom. <br><br>What's your point? The fact that you have gone through all this trouble to supposedly save a bunch of screencaps in hopes of creating a most ebin reply makes you look more invested in this shit than anyone else.<br><br> Just look at the reaction ITT when evil's "code" was cracked. <br><br>Jokes and banter. Anyone who would have been genuinely upset at the prospect of Sarada being Sakura's kid afterall has already let off their steam or come to terms with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind seeing Kabuto again. He was my favorite Nurudu villain.</br>  <br>one of the orphans that was at root's orphanage of horrors with kabuto</br>  <br> srop wanking sakura <br><br>She is the fourth strongest female character. Hinata and Karin don't even come close to her.</br></br></br>  <br> she had to go all out against mini-jubi jobbers <br>No, that was Sakura.</br></br>  <br>More like Sasuke is the female Hinata.</br>  <br>Except Chiyo stopped controlling her body after she realized Sakura was way better than she could ever move her. Check how she dodges the puppets, Hinata can't beat Zetsu.<br>Sakura also saved Chiyo.</br></br>  <br><br>I only liked him as Oro's assistant. The two had an interesting dynamic.</br></br>  <br>That's hilariously correct.<br><br>Chidori isn't Hinata's technique, though.<br><br>That's why is more likely the crowd will be doing Sasuke paralels than any mention of Hinata.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And again doesn't help the fact that she's slow making such an attack useless in a one on one fight. It only really works for a large group of enemies, not a single opponent.</br>  <br>Mods like that are cancer <br>I miss moot at least he understood how threads worked ie deleting the ones that went off topic fast..sonetimes</br></br>  More shit from attention whore<br><br> Oops fell asleep.  <br><br> I should have mixed up the paragraphs so you wouldn't find that so easily. Ah well, hindsight is always 20/20. I guess I should probably clear this up, we do find out who Chocho's real father is in this chapter. </br></br></br></br>  Evil is back  <br> the one where chiyo did most of the work? <br>I don't understand this. Yes, Chiyo did most of the work, against a guy that killed the strongest kage the Sand has ever had.<br><br>Yet it's by far the most and best we get to see from any of the female Konoha kunoichi in a fight against a decent opponent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Chiyo it was proven was controlling her through out the entire battle. It wasn't Sakura who was fighting, get over it.</br>  <br>What are you even posting? <br><br>really just stop, it's embarrassing. Also if you want to discuss powerlevels so much go check comicvine or something. <br><br>Sakura is the strongest and that's a fact, 64 palms can be healed just like Naruto did, Hinata stands no chance against her and like I said Hinata lost to Zetsu. <br><br>Karin WOULD trap her in the chains but she can't keep them all the time and she can't avoid being killed by KATSUYU in the meantime. <br>Temari is a no go either because she focuses on cutting her oponents and cutting Sakura does not effect.<br><br>Bye anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 20/20 <br>Eyesight confirmed</br></br>  <br>I dunno. Dragon Sage was pretty cool.</br>  <br><br>I usually don't visit spoiler threads. Can you tell me where he posts?</br></br>  <br> Yet it's by far the most and best we get to see from any of the female Konoha kunoichi in a fight against a decent opponent. <br><br>not like the other had fights<br><br>sakura is strong, but the hyuuga are tailor made to fuck up her main offense</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And what does she say now?</br>  <br><br>So, wait, Karinfags really did win?</br></br>  <br><br>I couldn't enjoy it because Itashit was there.</br></br>  <br>Haven't read the manga have we? Chiyo stops controlling Sakura after a while because Sakura is just better.<br><br>Go read the manga see you</br></br></br>  <br> 64 palms can be healed just like Naruto did <br>It's not even something you heal you retard</br></br>  <br> hindsight is 20/20 <br>Salad's Rinnegan confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Purple color motif<br>Eye powers<br>Father who pays more attention to sibling <br>Inferiority complex with sibling<br>Older brother figure<br>Devastating battle with older brother figure<br>Older brother figure sacrifices himself, entrusts Naruto with caring for them<br>Yin type<br>Watched Naruto from afar with secret admiration throughout childhood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And now she's gone again.</br>  <br>Salad gets 20/20 vision and Chou Chou's father is someone other than Chouji.</br>    Why don't hinata's kids have Byakugam? Naruto is dumb you guys should stop liking bad things.  <br>It's just something you ignore. Like Naruto did. Get over it and go read the manga again. <br><br>Seriously this is my last post, Hinata lost to Zetsu while Sakura was punching Kaguya. Get over your fanwanking, Hinata is just weaker I don't know why you're obsessing over it. <br><br>Stronger or weaker doesn't mean better or worse, in this case they're both shit in the writing department and none of the two are good characters. One has the advantage of being main girl that's just it.<br><br>I'm out wanker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't this apply to every fucking thing?<br><br>One Piece threads every day<br>Fairy Tail threads every day<br>Tokyo Ghoul threads every day<br><br> and so forth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh Izanami accept yourself asspull <br>That was bullshit. Orochibuto had that shit in the bag.<br><br><br>I miss old Shippuden.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sasuke confirmed for Chouchou's real dad </br>  <br> C-Chiyo's not controlling Sakura <br>you can still literally see the wires on her.</br></br>  <br>Don't reply to shitposters</br>  <br>You've been talking to multiple people you idiot, I only was correcting you on the palms chakra sealing shit, Sakura would probably win anyway</br>  <br>That's a speedline</br>  <br> Why don't hinata's kids have Byakugam? <br>Kishi don't give a shit about it.</br></br>  <br>it's just bantz m8</br>  <br><br><br> Kishi rused us with Sarada learning about her paternity when the story was really about Chouchou the WHOLE time. <br><br>I can live with this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you want to watch the world burn as do I</br>  <br> we do find out who Chocho's real father is in this chapter <br> almost dies trying to rescue your edgy ass <br> reward him by cucking the shit out of him and having him raise the kid </br></br></br>  <br>It would be Kishi pulling an actual Kubo.</br>  <br>No, it isn't. Look behind the sound effect. It twists. It's a string.</br>  <br>She stops after that, I'm sure that's the reason anon posted it. You don't remember the manga do you?<br>I mean I don't blame you it's been quite a few years since that fight but you should stop trying to argue something you don't know about.</br></br>  <br>Naruto never ignored it though, he legitimately couldn't access his own chakra, which is why he had to resort use the Kyuubi chakra. Its not something that you can heal from.</br>  <br>You were the one who posted that image, not him.</br>    <br><br>sasuga, Kishi. You learned from the best</br></br>  <br> only one where sakura is the mother <br> K A R I N I S M O M <br>so I pair the orphanage one with karin being mom.</br></br></br>  bruhs if sakura's chakra system is pinched off, she'd be unable to forehead diamond because the chakra would have nowhere to flow. she would have to fall back on basic taijutsu.<br><br>however it would be lretty wasy to psych Hinata out. Karin outclasses Sakura staminawise by strength of uzumaki reserves alone. Her chakra chain ability level is currently unknown though, and she's more of a stealth/noncombatant ninja which means she would wear Sakura down rather than face her headon.<br><br>Sakura's at her best punching out giant powerful enemies, but would have immense trouble with either a loss of chakra or an opponent who could outlast her chakra reserves and wear her down. If she had good fallbacks for her weaknesses she'd be A+++, but I don't believe she does.<br><br>also without inner sakura shes fucked against Ino.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orphanage makes zero sense with what we know about the Onions. It's the self destruct one or none of them.</br>  <br> Naruto ignored it. <br>No he didn't.</br></br>  <br><br>the Orochi snake one sounds plausible</br></br>  <br>Remember how when after it was revealed Hinata won some people said in reaction to everybody going crazy that "Oh yeah, well you would be whining about the same thing in NSfags' place" and everybody was like "No, Sakura winning was the obvious outcome. If that happened, everybody would just be like 'meh, Kishi a boring shit what else is new'"<br><br>That would be this if Sakura is the mom. In our heads everybody knew that because this is fucking Weekly Shounen Jump</br></br></br>  <br> hinata is a female sasuke </br>  <br> we do find out who Chocho's real father is in this chapter. <br>Yes. It's Chouji. I'm guessing that's the joke</br></br>  <br> That would be this if Sakura is the mom. In our heads everybody knew that because this is fucking Weekly Shounen Jump <br>Basically.<br><br>Karin being the mum is the FUN option. I just want to be entertained, I don't care about shipping.<br><br>As another example, I abandoned Bleach years ago. But if Orihime suddenly go on a killing spree, I would start watching that just for how fun it would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> minus the edge, and muh vengeance. <br> minus sasuke </br></br>  <br> Like Naruto did. <br>Okay in case you forgot what actually happened during that fight, Naruto was on his last legs because his points were blocked but then used Kyuubi magic to force that shit open.<br><br>Normally in real life people can't actually do that</br></br></br></br>   karin is chouchou's real mother   <br> They have the same basic storyline <br> Minus the two things that basically defines one of their characters </br></br>  Why are people going on and on about powerlevels when the manga already left that clear. Nobody has a chance against this. Naruto is a pretty clear manga about powerlevels and it's already known who is the strongest. Going further than that is just being a moron. <br><br>Someone please post powerman and end this<br><br><br>I don't believe Evil this way around, she just loves attention I wish people stopped giving it to her. <br>Why does she always has spoilers anyways? never knew that. Who the fuck is she?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As another example, I abandoned Bleach years ago. But if Orihime suddenly go on a killing spree, I would start watching that just for how fun it would be. <br><br>I dropped Bleach too years ago, and oh man, Orihime pulling a twist and becoming actually evil and going full killing spree would really spice things.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep on dreamin<br><br>Kishi loves his drama. If making Sarada the mother is what it takes he'll do it.</br></br></br>  <br> Orphanage makes zero sense with what we know about the Onions. It's the self destruct one or none of them. <br>Orphanage seems likely considering the very first spoiler she posted today, before all this decoder ring trolling bullshit, was a flat "Urushi reappears"</br></br>   Uzumaki clan arc never   <br> Sarada is her own mother <br><br>u wot</br></br></br>  <br>This was the fucking worst filler episode.</br>  <br> Who the fuck is she? <br><br>He dad works at Shueisha.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't believe Evil this way around, she just loves attention I wish people stopped giving it to her. <br><br>Evil knows she'll lose that attention the moment she loses her credibility<br><br>Why are people so resistant to Karin being the mom? Stealthy Sakurafags or people not realizing the moral?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus this way sauce gets closer to reviving his clan.</br>  <br> If making Sarada the mother is what it takes he'll do it <br> If making Sarada the mother  <br> Sarada Marty McFly's it and fucks her own dad in the past <br> Sakura is a double cuck </br></br></br></br>  <br>I lost my shit when I read this<br><br>Good job anon</br></br></br>  You know, a part of me feels bad about being pleased if Sakura is confirmed cuck considering this would mean that Karin is once again the victim of the Uchiha Evil.  <br>They're dead bro.</br>  <br>Becase we're dealing with SSfags and Sakurafags.</br>  <br>Well Kishimoto ruined that when he decided to marry Naruto to some blind Yamato Nadeshiko because <br> muh submissive traditional japanese wife </br></br>  <br> sasuke pierced karen!! <br>yes....yes he did.</br></br>  <br>It's a trap! I hope none of you seriously are falling for it.</br>  <br>Depends on what her choices were in the matter. tbh i wouldnt be surprised if sasuke genjutsud her and sakura to keep his cuckspawn safe inside konoha.</br>  <br> submissive <br> hinata <br><br>pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br> people not realizing the moral <br><br>Then does it mean that Sasuke isn't Sarada's true dad?</br></br></br>  <br>All that salt</br>  <br>  Fade into movie <br>  Sasuke watching a young boy run around in the yard, he's leaning back easily, resting on his hands <br>  A figure appears at the doorway, wearing the stereotypical apron <br>  SS fans start going nuts <br>  Slowly pans up <br>  Pink hair <br>  People flipping their shit <br>  Camera angle changes <br>  It's Karin, hair colour was a trick of the light </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll pick both</br>  <br> Well Kishimoto ruined that <br>Pretty sure all the other Uzumakis are dead minus her and does Naruto even know who she is?<br><br> implying Hinata is still submissive </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata actually slapped Naruto.</br>  <br>My dad works at nintendo<br><br>I don't believe it because it's too good to be true and Kishimoto doesn't have the backbone. JUMP would shit on him too. <br><br> People don't think the same as me so they're Sakura fans!!!!!!! <br><br>I swear to god I hate you fucking paranoid fuckface, every fucking thread there's someone like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They are all dead.</br></br>  <br>I have to warn you Anon<br><br>You are playing a very dangerous game.</br></br></br>  <br> uzumaki clan rebirth is going to be more successful than Uchiha rebirth <br> uzumaki genes so stronk any uchihas that pop from sarada will also be uzumaki </br></br>  <br> You know, a part of me feels bad about being pleased if Sakura is confirmed cuck considering this would mean that Karin is once again the victim of the Uchiha Evil. <br>Depends.<br><br>To come full circle with the morals and make Sakura look good in comparison, Karin could be sacrificed and made even WORSE as a parent than even Sasuke. It would justify the argument that DNA isn't everything, and that Salad is much better off with Sakura than Karin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had a hunch that this is NOT spoilers but the actual chapter. Fuck you evil, this is all probably true and not a single thing is false.</br>  <br>Forever mad.</br>  <br>Considering the posts made from the people who were against the idea, it is a safe bet that they're SSfags and Cuckerafags.</br>  <br>Didn't the survivors scattered around the world?</br>  <br><br>All she does is cook his meals and stay at home taking care of the kids like a fucking maid.

JUMP would shit on him too. <br><br>That's why he built the moral around it to make Sakura look like a better person</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I honestly don't know what the point of all this is.<br><br>By the end of the chapter Sakura will still be Sarada's "true" mom, Sasuke will poke Sarada's forehead, fuck off and still get called the coolest papa, and Naruto will forgive his husbando and eventually give him full custody of his kid.</br></br>  <br> All she does is cook his meals and stay at home taking care of the kids like a fucking maid. Fuck off if you think otherwise <br>Actually if she is your stereotypical Japanese wife, she would control the finances and give Naruto his allowance for every month. That's the duty of the husband, to give the wife his entire paycheck and let her decide what to do with it.</br></br>  <br><br>I just can't see Kishi going that far to make Karin look bad, especially when it isn't necessary to make Sakura look good.</br></br>  <br> Kishi <br> not reviving Itachi Sue and making him supreme Jesus Emperor of the World </br></br>  <br>Kaguya x Hiruzen is OTP.</br>  <br> I honestly don't know what the point of all this is. <br>To give Salad more powers than just Uchiha eyes. Because we already saw what Uchiha eyes can do, she needed to mix it up with other bloodline limits like Chakra chains and healing bite.</br></br>  <br>She also rips the eyes out of moon kebabs heads without hesitation. More than we can say for cuckura.</br>  <br>  Strongest girl BY FAR <br>  Still would lose to a bowlcut with no ninjutsu or genjutsu to speak of </br></br>  <br>The point is to burn SS down to the ground and salt the foundation just as "SS month" is starting.</br>  <br>Ugh why did you have to remind me of this?<br><br>Shithiro a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I just can't see Kishi going that far to make Karin look bad, especially when it isn't necessary to make Sakura look good. <br>But Karin had ALWAYS looked bad. Since when was she ever a heroine?</br></br>  <br><br> By the end of the chapter Sakura will still be Sarada's "true" mom, Sasuke will poke Sarada's forehead, fuck off and still get called the coolest papa, and Naruto will forgive his husbando and eventually give him full custody of his kid. <br><br>ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because where I live we give people more chances with their kids than their pets.

It could be an omake if the last chapter would be the final chapter in Gaiden.<br><br>Also, <br> underestimating the power of waifu fuggery </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet all she ended up getting was a normal sharingan and the super punches.</br>  <br>Everyone would. Fuckign Madara did<br><br>Bowlcuts are just too AWESOME</br></br></br>  <br>Kisame only got wrecked because he no longer had his sword to compete with Gai. And even then Gai still opened 7 gates.</br>  <br> But Karin had ALWAYS looked bad. Since when was she ever a heroine? <br><br>Karin was an antagonist. She wasn't a villain. And we were supposed to feel sorry for her when Sasuke penetrated her and left her in the gutter the first time.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime looked pretty fucking GOOD last episode, I think we're getting a great GaivsMadara this week.</br>  <br>  Ok, I'll use my incredible chakra control to store an insane amount of excess chakra in my forehead <br>  Better hope my chakra control doesn't get messed up <br>  Like, by my chakra points being blocked <br>  I hope that doesn't happen <br>  When I go up against someone who can see them <br>  And who's entire fighting style is closing them off <br>  Man, that would suck </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>NSfags declared November 2014 to be NS month. Look at how well that turned out for them.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't change a thing. The sword will only act like a shield against Hirudora, the end result will be the same with guy apprehending Kisame.</br>  <br>He still needed Kakashi's and Minato's help though.</br>  <br>Hinata canonically did a super-hero team up with Naruto and stopped the moon going full Majora's Mask on the planet.<br><br>I'd call that fairly relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Madara pls leave</br>  <br> Yet all she ended up getting was a normal sharingan and the super punches. <br>Because it isn't yet time. If she pulled out the chains then the game is up.</br></br>  <br>we all know how sakura would've ended up had she not been paired with nart and sauce.</br>  <br>The tears<br><br>They're so good</br></br></br>  <br> November <br><br>the same month we got the last hype? you have to be kidding me</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody gives a fuck about a movie tho.

Can you make magic happen again?</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Naruto do everything against the moon cuck?</br>  <br> nobody gives a fuck about a movie that is literally the highest grossing anime movie of all time. </br>  <br>Taka arcs. but then again Taka was just GOAT.</br>  <br>No.Stop it.</br>  <br>Isn't that Film Z?</br>  <br>Copypasta tear</br>  Speaking of movies, just found out that the co-writer of the Bolt movie is the author of the Gaara Hiden novel. Kishi is still lead writer, though.  <br>Senju genes 2 stronk</br>  <br>No it was The Last, the Last broke those records.</br>  <br>Actually, the good staff is on パパの青春.

It's not that important. <br><br> But if it makes you feel better, Sarada is totally okay with Sakura not being her biological mother, because of all that beautiful nonsense Naruto said with his TNJ. </br></br>  <br>Which means Sakura didn't just say "What? No. Of course I'm your birth mother." Which means Karin is the mom.</br>  <br>Then she should not care who her papa is.</br>   Originally Posted by Klue View Post <br>Where is Karin now, Evil? <br><br> She returned and gave Suigetsu shit for touching her stuff. </br></br></br>  <br> Elsa Let it go <br><br>The Frozen song? <br><br>Heh, if that's true, I knew it, Kishi would leave it like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hurry up and eat your own shit already.</br>  <br> didnt it barely break even <br>I'm pretty sure it's not the highest grossing anime film of all time but I'm also sure it is the highest selling Naruto movie ever which they were constantly promoting about it so that definitely isn't true</br></br>  <br>Why do you people play games with some egotistical attentionwhore on a forum?<br><br>Are you really that desperate for even the slightest hint at a spoiler that you'll eat up this faggotry while waiting for actual spoilers to a manga that's coming out in a day or 2 anyways?</br></br></br>  <br> Then she should not care who her papa is. <br>She doesn't want to care.

But they're usually irrelevant and played for laughs, which I admit bugs me.</br>  <br> Evil also refers to Naruto's TNJ to Salad as "beautiful nonsense" <br><br>She could just be mocking SS posters.<br><br><br><br>Not to mention Sakura ran like hell just to cover her ass and apologize to Sasuke and Sarada.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope everyone here realizes that Evil is poised to deliver the final blow to the SScucks.

If you go in expecting something hilariously overdramatic and fun, you'll consider it one of your top anime of all time.</br>  <br>Watch the first and second episode again or wait? The last two episodes will arrive later this year, the fourth episode is being shown in Japan this Saturday.</br>  <br>How did you liked Cross Ange? <br>That's the same kind of train wreck but with more fabulous and likable MC.</br></br>  So is there any reason why this shit airs once a year  <br>It was supposed to come out way earlier, but it kept being delayed due to production issues.</br>  <br> Cross Ange <br>Bad example. I never liked that. This was much better.</br></br>  <br><br>They are actually airing a minimum of two and a maximum of three chapters this years, so the average will be lower than that.</br></br>  <br>The average wait, to clarify.</br>  <br>Pretty good but this isn't something you should ask. Watch it yourself.</br>  <br>I feel like waiting for the last two to be honest. <br>I can't feel as invested in the story with all these long breaks so I'll probably do that.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>That everything<br><br><br> Not having an AB account <br>pleb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's a good piece of advice.</br></br>  <br><br>Well done Sunrise, keep the spirit of Gainax alive.</br></br>   Lelouch doesn't bow to anyone   <br>And then I remember Suzaku stepping on his face after he bowed down before him.</br>  Post C.C. scenes if any, I'd watch it if theres more Lelouch and C.C. antics instead of LiterallyWhokito  <br> AB </br>  <br>Episode has a lot of Suzaku and Lelouch scenes but only a single scene with C.C.</br>  <br>What exactly is C.C. doing? Trying to figure out where Lelouch is I'm guessing?</br>  <br>No, she's in a flashback giving an unknown Geass to Leila.</br>  <br>No, she saved Leila from drowning on the night her father was assassinated and her mother died in a burning car, gave her geass, but said she didn't have to commit to using it until she was an adult. Way more luxury than the nun ever gave C.C.</br>  <br>Leila was a kid at the time, so it's way before C.C. even met Lelouch</br>  Anyone else pissed how badly the european soldiers treat the jap brigade?<br>Fuck, Japan, can't you ever let go of your victim complex? They literally go "MUAHAHAHAHA DIE, DIE FOR US!" towards the regugees of a country occupied by the archenemy. <br>Were the Brits assholes like that towards the Poles and Czechs who fought for them in WWII?<br>I'm also very disappointed that Europa Universe is just Britannia Light, but that's another thing entirely.</br></br></br>  <br>Britannia is a glorious empire, EU is a corrupt populist shithole with no guts.</br>  <br> Were the Brits assholes like that towards the Poles and Czechs who fought for them in WWII? <br>The Americans were assholes to the other Europeans who fought for them, and even today, American soldiers are assholes or have prejudices against the Afghan and Iraqi soldiers they work with.<br><br>And this should be normal. The Code Geass world is not some kind of white guilt filled world. The Europeans never practiced slavery in any appreciable amounts and the Asians in this universe were just as capable as the Europeans, so in essence, it was like a worldwide Eurasian supercompetition. They had no such things as "sensitivity training" shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Americans were assholes to the other Europeans who fought for them <br>Though for full disclosure, a lot of it was national rivalry.<br>And on the Afghan/Iraq thing, a lot of them did end up killing American soldiers. And the way Akito's Japanese troops act, I wouldn't trust them either if I were the Europeans.</br></br></br>  <br> And the way Akito's Japanese troops act, I wouldn't trust them either if I were the Europeans. <br>I wouldn't really trust them for the fact that they ambushed a European general.</br></br>  <br>Why did they do that again?</br>  <br> That's not lulu, unfortunately. <br>Wouldn't be the first time he's dressed in a similar style of clothing and been a "dancer".<br><br> Though apparently this was not considered canon despite a ton of other non-anime content apparently being canon </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god, fuck off. This has nothing to do with /poltumblr/ bullshit.<br>Also<br> Afghan and Iraqi <br>Different, they're from the enemy's nation.<br>Japanese are from a neutral nation occupied and oppressed by the enemy. You can't compare Iraqis in Iraq with Czechoslovak and Polish exiles who fought the nazis on allied side.<br> The Americans were assholes to the other Europeans who fought for them <br> for them <br>Jesus Christ.<br>And I doubt they made fun of Brits and French in the same way, saying they should die into their faces.<br>Suuure, there are in-universe explanations for this behaviour. But I have no issue with them (still stupid, those jap soldiers would be good propaganda material).<br>It annoys me that Japanese of course have to be victims again, and it feels so fucking forced here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I wouldn't trust them either if I were the Europeans <br>Maybe they shouldn't have treated them like garbage before that.</br></br>  <br> I'm also very disappointed that Europa Universe is just Britannia Light <br>Do you mean the EU-Britannians ruling in EU? There's a reason why they're "better" people than the Britannian mainlanders, and that's because they're old European nobles.<br><br>But I guess it doesn't matter that much because conquered territories by Britannia even in EU are turned into colonies and the people are labeled Numbers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks like spinzaku is still in good form</br>  So, does Suzaku beats the shit out of Akito with Lancelot, or is just drama all over the place?  <br> EU-Britannians ruling in EU <br>That doesn't make much sense, doesn't it?<br>The whole EU feels so lazily constructed, it was just an uninteresting afterthought in the main show, but if you focus on it you should at least try.</br></br></br>  <br>In this episode? Suzaku beats the shit out of a bunch of Britannian knights with Lancelot.</br>  <br>Not until OVA 5, m8.<br><br>This episode Suzaku wrecked some mutineers while Lelouch had a seizure on the floor in the other room.</br></br></br>  <br>This one was half SOL where Akito opened up considerably and half Suzaku killing other Brits and Lelouch fighting Charles' geass.</br>  <br>Not really. The EU is a union of European nations under a democratic nation under the influence of oligarchical aristocrats.<br><br>Being a democracy doesn't mean the people are "kind" rather, it means the people vote people into power by the majority.<br><br>Case example is Egypt and them voting in the Islamic or Arabic Brotherhood (is that what they're called?). They voted in people to power that within the first year of elections literally went and started oppressing their 10% Coptic Christian population down the Nile.<br><br>Code Geass was pretty realistic with what they did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Europeans in this universe are the result of Napoleon conquering/vassalizing all of Europe including the British Isles (minus Russia? I can't remember the official map) under a proto-EU alliance under French leadership.<br><br>That's why the Brittanian goverment moved to America (they also hadn't lost the 13 colonies which was part of the reason Napoleon beat them, they were spead out too thin).<br><br>This early proto-EU had its advantadges and drawbacks for society, namely that French citizens, culture and customs became favoured over other citizenry in the early stages (though it seems the german nobles stroke some sort of deal as they are still prominent in the military hierarchy) but after a couple of generations you had the continent united against "outsiders".<br><br>The Japanese are quite literally refugees in this scenario and the attitudes you see in Geass are not that different from how the EU sees refugees in real life. If they have some useful skill/are educated, sure you might stand a chance to get a decent living (and even then you'll get second looks) but if you are a run-of-the-mill guy you will be seen as someone "stealing jobs and mooching social benefits" (regardless on if it's true or not) by a population with prejudices against people who are not their own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder what the Arabs are like.<br>They were mentioned as nations who respect human rights and stuff.<br>But unfortunatelly worldbuilding is not one of Japan's strengths, so I wouldn't expect much.</br></br></br>  <br> French <br>I'm not detecting any French-ness in the Euro Universe though.</br></br>  I wonder why none from the Imperial family is conquering or ruling in EU, there are a shit ton of them and we haven't seen a single one of them aside from Lelouch. Would be cool if they would show Schneizel arriving in EU in episode 5 tho  Why are Lancer types always such great guys?  <br>Russia is the stronghold of the assdevastated descendants of the nobles who fled Europe (it wasn't only Brits who fled), the Imperial family is already privileged in their land so the ones with an axe to grind are the other nobles.<br><br>Not sure what Hyuuga is thinking though, obviously Euro Britannia can't fight against the Britannian Empire and the EU.<br><br><br>pic</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Japanese are from a neutral nation occupied and oppressed by the enemy. You can't compare Iraqis in Iraq with Czechoslovak and Polish exiles who fought the nazis on allied side. <br>Different anon but you should look at American Pre-war entry WWI attitudes against German and Irish Americans vs WASP Americans.<br><br>If you want British/French examples just look at how they treated their colonial citizens compared to their "own" population. <br><br> Japanese are from a neutral nation occupied and oppressed by the enemy. You can't compare Iraqis in Iraq with Czechoslovak and Polish exiles who fought the nazis on allied side. <br>You cannot equal Brittania to Nazi Germany either. And the Japanese are not even geographically and culturally similar enough to make the comparison to Poles and Czechs, it would be a different thing if it were the Chinese (like in the regular anime) using Japanese troops to "reconquer Japan" as they are culturally closer in that regard.<br><br><br>Admittedly, I cannot come up with a real life example as convoluted as the Japanese divisions in Europe (culturally and technologically), it's akin to having a South Viatnamese army division with stealth F-117 being under German/French/NATO command against a possible attack by the Soviet Union.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant that it looks like Britannia and somewhat feels like it, since they show little of it's workings. It's very minor, I agree, but I always expected something that looks and feels very different.<br>And why are the british so important? <br><br>I know that. And yes, Russia is part of the EU, so are parts of Africa.<br>I once read a great (fanmade) timeline that explained how the CG world looks like it does, but I'm afraid the writers wouldn't think up anything that makes as much sense.<br> The Japanese are quite literally refugees in this scenario and the attitudes you see in Geass are not that different from how the EU sees refugees in real life etc. <br>Again, those are in-universe reasons. I could argue that those japs are fundamentally different from arab refugees (I compared them to exiles from Nazi-occupied countries), but I won't, because it's pointless.<br>It's a meta-reason, I think it feels forced for the sake of getting cheap sympathy for a japanese audience - again, those two soldiers could have worn top-hats and twirled their mustaches after laughing at the japanese.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any french fag who can tell if this is properly written?<br><br>I ask because elevens tend to fuck up english, I wouldn't be surprise if they did the same with french</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not detecting any French-ness in the Euro Universe though. <br>If you pay attention all official documents are primarily in French, with the occassional translation into whatever local language is the scenario of the week.<br><br>French is the lingua franca and de facto (probably also de jure) language used by the armed forces and in general of the european state burocracry.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I was about to write a lenghty reply, but I propose that we end this before the thread gets derailed by me. I hate this when other do it, and therefore I should not do it myself. Talijng about worldbuilding and so on is fine, I guess, since it's at least topic-related.<br>Only one thing:<br> You cannot equal Brittania to Nazi Germany <br>They are certainly much less racist.</br></br></br></br>  Does this turn good later? I watched the first episode and wanted to fall asleep from boredoom, but my hate for most creative decisions they did kept me awake. <br><br> Also, call me when Lulu's back and alive due to an asspull </br></br>  <br>French might also be the language Brittanian nobles use as a court language.</br>  <br> they also hadn't lost the 13 colonies which was part of the reason Napoleon beat them, they were spead out too thin <br>I thought the War of 1812 drew Royal Navy resources away from the Napoleonic Wars IRL.</br></br>   Lelouch <br> Wins by being intelligent and plot armor <br><br> Akito <br> Wins by rushing everything and plot armor <br><br>Does anyone even like Akito?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>French is my second language, and I can't read the exposé bit of the right most window as its too blurry, but otherwise the French doesn't seem that bad to me. That "de" in the red window should be "des" though. "Top priorité" also seems off to me; "Priorité majeur" would probably be more accurate.</br>  <br> I once read a great (fanmade) timeline that explained how the CG world looks like it does, but I'm afraid the writers wouldn't think up anything that makes as much sense. <br>IIRC the official timeline (main points) goes like this:<br> Arthur and his celtic troops kick Ceasar out of Brittania, meaning it won't get romanized and christianized until much later. This will later retroactively be turned into the beginning of the Brittanian calendar. <br> Vikings happen. Control British Isles until Harold II gets killed and the Normans take over, bringing Christianity with them. <br> Auld Alliance does not disintegrate and Scots remain independent instead of bankrupting themselves by trying to build the Panama canal 3 centuries too early (don't remember the details) <br> Thirteen Colonies revolt and fail (thanks in part to Benjamin Franklin becoming a traitor for nobility and territories). The Americans remain rebellious though, necessating increased troops by the English, who end up thinning themselves out <br> French Revolution/Napoleon/yaddayadda. Instead of trying to attack the Brits with the continental blockade Napoleon sees the chance to strike and attacks England from the channel + the Scot army. English Royal family and goverment flee to the Americas and the Scots unify Great Britain becoming a sattelite state for Napoleon's chart of European countries under French rule/"alliance". <br> British America + 13 Colonies become Brittania, peace is settled with the French forfeiting Louisianna in Exchange of the English forfeiting European possessions. Brittanians go open the frontier to expand across the continent <br><br>You can figure the rest, no British Empire, a French-dominated Proto-EU (Prussia and Austria were nominally free) and each continent becomes its small island of protoempires with a few outliers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should watch it because from episode 3 and onwards it will feature Lelouch, C.C. and Suzaku. There might also be details about Geass in the coming episodes as there's supposedly a higher being than V.V and C.C in the universe.</br>  <br> I thought the War of 1812 drew Royal Navy resources away from the Napoleonic Wars IRL. <br>I don't recall the details of the timeline anymore TBH but the war of 1812 was pretty much a non-issue IRL as far as Napoleonic Wars were concerned, the Canadians pretty much curbstomped the Americans and the only victories the Americans made were after the peace treaty had already been signed.<br>The Napoleonic Wars if anything became an issue of contention because Britain was impressing (forcibly recruiting) US naturalized citizens who were born in the British Empire which in the eyes of the US was akin to enslaving their citizens and forcing them to serve in a foreign army.</br></br></br>  How many more parts are planned for this?  <br> the Canadians pretty much curbstomped the Americans <br><br>This is bullshit Canadian propaganda. It was british troops, from britain, that curbstomped america. Canadians didn't do jack shit.</br></br></br>  <br>2. Episode 4 in cinemas this Saturday and the last episode this Fall.</br>  <br><br>Damn Gypsies corrupting my pure French aryan mechafu; REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!</br></br>  <br> and the last episode this Fall. <br><br>More like Fall 2018</br></br></br>  <br>Damn why is everyone a fucking stick? Fucking CLAMP.</br>  <br>Fuck off fat sympathizer.</br>  <br> Code Geass Akito the Exiled - 03 <br> it FINALLY FUCKING AIRED <br><br>YES YES YES GIVE ME MORE</br></br></br></br>  <br> Damn why is everyone a fucking stick? Fucking CLAMP. <br>Such is the nature of noodlepeople</br></br>  So let me get this straight;<br><br>Lelouch is right now under the Emperors Geass, and being made to fight for the Euro Britanians. <br><br>The Euro Britannians are the force sent to re-conquer Europe for Britannia. And the EU are using Japanese refugees as suicide squad fighters, because they don't want to loose actual EU citizens. <br><br>Anything I'm missing here?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Euro-Britannia (mostly Hyuuga) declared independence in this chapter and will get rekt from trying to fight both the Empire and the EU</br>  <br> Anything I'm missing here? <br>The Japanese are being used for the missions deemed to suicidal to use European troops rather than the Europeans not wanting to use any European troops at all (rather using them in safer operations).<br><br>Aside from that, pretty spot-on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost, the Euro Brits are now revolting against Charles thanks to a coup led by some geass crazed Japanese guy who just had half of his men murdered by Spinzaku.</br>  <br>Anon I don't think you know what a healthy body looks like and Lulu does not look healthy at all.</br>  <br>Also, didn't the first Akito mention that Napoleon was executed? Seems like his rule didn't last long, or the officisl history we know is not really the official one.</br>  <br><br> declaring independence from Britannia <br> still trying to conquer the EU <br>Wow jesus christ these fucking nobles man<br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lelouch isn't there to fight for the EU-Britannians I think, he planned the whole thing with Velaines for example. I'd say he's there to keep the noble EU-Britannians in check more than anything.</br>  Akito doesn't really win so much as just survive. Akito has gotten dozens of elevens slaughtered because he battle rages everyone in his unit to become suicidal. Lelouch, meanwhile, always just blew up the ground and achieved flawless victories.<br><br>how the fuck can one more hour-long ova wrap up all the hanging hooks sunrise has set up, though? Between trying to build a newtype AI program that will make everyone FEEL RAINBOWS and the Geass becoming a trans-dimensional existence that is instilling order on the chaos space-time continuum, shit's getting complicated.</br></br>  <br> Also, didn't the first Akito mention that Napoleon was executed? Seems like his rule didn't last long, or the officisl history we know is not really the official one. <br>Not really that surprising, he was a great general, not so much a great Emperor.<br>And for the French it was "Killed one monarch already, might aswell kill this one" once the economy didn't work as planned and surely the German and French aristocracy (what was left of it) would have spared no expenses to ensure the French population go through with that, a French Republic in a "proto-EU" was still better than a european-wide French Empire.</br></br></br>  <br> how can they wrap it up <br>By having the Britannia retaliation force kill everyone. Literally they are going to kill an awful lot of the minor characters</br></br>  <br>2 more. They extended the run to 5 OVAs. And then there's that movie we know nothing about.</br>  <br> how the fuck can one more hour-long ova wrap up all the hanging hooks sunrise has set up <br>2 more.<br><br>But I don't think they will wrap it up. It wouldn't be a surprise if they're working on another project.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the statement about the movie and it being about Lelouch's story still stands.</br>  I don't remember but where the Euro Brittanians just Scot-lead Great Britain or did Britannia reconquer territory in Europe?  <br>Holy shit finally. Can't wait for the last one 4 years from now.</br>  Anyone feels Akito has been mediocre so far? It hasn't captured the essence of CG at all. It's basically a CG with all the grandiose fun sucked out of it. The main characters are also still unlikeable compared to Ledouche and Spinzaku.  <br>OVA 4 is out in literally 3 days, anon. OVA 5 is in the fall.</br>  <br>Good to see this again.</br>  <br>Euro Britannians are literally just Britannians who went to reconquer it. They call themselves Euro-Britannians and have a 'special' administrative relationship with the formal Britannian empire because they are reconquering Europeans, compared to other ethnicitys.</br>  <br>Woah there's a fifth now? Anyway it'll be at least a year until we get to seem them both.</br>  <br>What are you sniffing? Episode 4 is confirmed on Blu-ray in October, and Episode 5 in Winter.</br>  <br>I could watch this all day</br>  <br>The CG in my opinion is one the best in the anime industry, I don't mind it. I also don't like the main characters, with the introduction of Lelouch and Suzaku they're definitely stealing the show.<br><br><br>Episode 4 already has a confirmed BD date late October. Fifth episode already has a confirmed cinema date in October as well. Fifth BD release 2-3 months after that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And of course I now realize you were talking about Code Geass and not CGI.</br></br>  <br>I actually really liked those scenes. Really helped defined the Wyvern as a family instead of the edgelords from the first two OVAs.</br>   only 1 lewd webm from an ova filled with lewd webm material   <br> It hasn't captured the essence of CG at all. <br>So its actually good.</br></br>  <br>Nah, this episode was really fucking good and worth the wait. I was worried that Akane's directing style wouldn't fit Code Geass but ge proved himself this episode. After the setup the story is moving forward with a lot of interesting revelations and its good to see its been extended so they won't rush out a conclusion.</br>  <br>Some parts of the third episode definitely felt like it had the essence of Code Geass, like <br><br><br>Other than that I completely agree with you</br></br></br></br>  The original cast benefited by the fact we saw them all on a weekly basis (EXCEPT KALLEN SINCE SHE WAS IN THAT FUCKING BOX FOR HALF OF R2)<br><br>Akito's characters only get to compete for some face time in hour-long ovas that have had a shit-tier release schedule since Sunrise was busier working on their big name, Gundem Unicorn.<br><br>Akito himself is sort of generic fujobait, too. Emotionally damaged protag with an edgy past and a murderous intent towards the onii-chan who killed the whole clan; he's sort of cool like Saskay</br></br></br></br>  <br> The original cast benefited by the fact we saw them all on a weekly basis <br>We saw CC on a weekly basis?</br></br>  <br>This. What /a/ means when they say it doesn't capture the essence of CG they mean there's not enough memes.</br>  <br>Yes? Did we watch the same TV series? Might have been an episode or so without her but she was in pretty much all of them</br>  What's currently the best release of this available on nyaa? Should I wait for something else to pop up?  Ayano needs to do something about all her death flags  <br>This webm makes me feel really uncomfortable</br>  <br>BASED SUNRISE DELIVERS</br>  <br> This webm makes me feel really uncomfortable <br>You might be gay</br></br>  <br>You don't like gypsies?</br>  <br> What's currently the best release of this available on nyaa? <br>Get Ghetto because they actually edit the subs.</br></br>  <br>Is that the same animator who did the titty ninja anime? the artstyles look similar.</br>  <br> murdered by Spinzaku <br>Sounds horrible to be honest</br></br>  <br>Readjust your pants</br>  <br>The new cast just isn't likeable. Far too serious and oftentimes edgy.<br><br>There's a reason why episode 3 became significantly better now that the old cast is slowly returning.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much the whole point of this third OVA was to make the new characters likeable, though, by discarding all that serious and edgy crap from the last OVA for 30 minutes.</br>  <br>Can only hope Sunrise realizes that as well.</br>  <br> There's a reason why episode 3 became significantly better now that the old cast is slowly returning. <br>I'd also credit it to the new cast showing a softer side, and only Akito being edgy (although he loses his edge somewhat).</br></br>  <br> There's a reason why episode 3 became significantly better now that the old cast is slowly returning. <br>It became "better" because the pieces are coming together not because Lelouch and Suzaku came back. Their roles here aren't even important just fanservice.</br></br>  I know it's probably a stupid question to ask, but are the OVAs worth it?<br><br>I liked CG and I think the ending it got had good closure.</br></br>  <br>No, I'm pretty sure the episode is much better just because people missed Lelouch and Suzaku. Their roles are what made the episode, at least for me.</br>  <br>It takes place in between S1/S2</br>  <br>Why does C.C. look good in literally any clothing</br>  <br>It depends on your answer to this question:<br>Is Lelouch alive at the end of S2?</br></br>  <br> not because Lelouch and Suzaku came bac <br>That is exactly why it was better than the previous episodes. The brought back the essence of Code Geass for a moment.</br></br>  <br>I came to like the new cast this episode because of the fun slice of life times.</br>  <br>Actually, they're the main reason why we're returning to a CG-esque feel.<br><br>inb4<br> CG is bad </br></br></br></br>  <br>After the third episode I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Geass. It's not on Code Geass TV series level, but it's not bad.</br>  <br> people <br>You mean you?</br></br>  <br> It hasn't captured the essence of CG at all <br>Thanks god</br></br>  <br>You honestly don't think people miss Lelouch and Suzaku? Read the fucking thread buddy.</br>  <br><br><br>The episode was mainly about the Wyvern Squad and Shin making his move, Lelouch and Suzaku were just fanservice who only played a minor role. If their appearance made the episode better for you then you really weren't paying attention.<br><br><br>There's not much in this thread other than people who still don't know anything about this and people who still think its not great with or without them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it an interquel? Why does it matter what you think of the ending?</br></br>  <br>I'm only testing him to see whether he's a pleb that thinks  Lelouch isn't the guy driving the cart .</br>  <br>There's nothing in this thread that says that's the case.</br>  What the fuck is going on in this episode<br>   the gang desert and become gypsies for abit  <br>   the blonde has GEASS powers which are dormant <br>   Lelouch now has social media experience  <br>   a fucking coup be the order or rejects manages to overcome not one, not two, but three forces of similar size <br><br>Plot progression, but  no resolution for anything. Better then 1 +2, though could use some more just as planned shenanigans  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Skinny and well proportioned, long luscious hair, long legs though some might say too long and twiggy. She also has those sex eyes and that smug grin pretty much always.</br></br>  <br>It's not a sequel, its set between R1 and R2. You can consider it non-canon if you like, its still more Geass and I am fine with that</br>  <br> no resolution for anything. <br>Gee its almost like this isn't the end.</br></br>  <br> no resolution for anything <br> No resolution in Part 3 <br> Of 5 <br> The exact middle </br></br></br></br>  GYPSIES? What the fuck Japan, why would you add gypsies to your cartoons?  <br>They got the stereotypes abit fucked. Gypsies like that don't really appear in Warsaw very much. But its an alternative universe so hay, go nuts</br>  <br> If their appearance made the episode better for you then you really weren't paying attention. <br>Or you know, the rest of the episode was mediocre as ever and Spinzaku/Ledouche made it better.</br></br>  <br>I think it's pretty. The jewel accents his eyes perfectly.</br>  <br>Delicious midriffs and dancing.<br><br>Not even the first time they have done something similar, just the first time it was animated in the CG anime/OVA</br></br></br>  <br> And on the Afghan/Iraq thing, a lot of them did end up killing American soldiers <br>'Muricans shouldn't have invaded their countries then if they were about to bawww about that.</br></br>  <br>Right so you're just delusional</br>  <br> Spinzaku <br><br>This bring back memories</br></br></br>  <br><br>Each OVA has managed to pull in about a 25-30K average so it wouldn't surprise me. How many active money printers does Sunrise have going right now. I count Love Live, Gundam, Code Geass, Aikatsu, Yamato 2199, Tiger and Bunny (I think that's still going), Gintama, possibly Mai Hime if they're actually doing anything with it again.<br><br>Literally everything they are doing this year seems to be movies and OVAs still though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> a fucking coup be the order or rejects manages to overcome not one, not two, but three forces of similar size <br>This was just hilarious. It's like the guy watched too much CG went crazy and expected to pull a Lelouch out of his ass.</br></br>  <br>They knew exactly what they were doing</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll bite. AB?</br></br>  THORA release when?  <br>I wonder how many people will sit with their dicks in their hands after the fifth episode and at the 10th anniversary,  myself included </br>  <br> being this new </br>  I want to quench Julius Kingsley's thirst if you know what I'm saying.  <br> active money printers <br>And still, no signs of Horizon S3.</br></br>  I am convinced that /a/ is a board dedicated to hating anime  <br>animebytes<br><br>You need to jump through stupid-ass hoops for an invite tho</br></br></br>  <br><br>No just anything actually enjoyable to watch for things beyond fanservice and high school students engaging in school life, club activities and banter. /a absolutely fucking loves shit it can jerk off to like SHAFT, Kyoani and iDOLM@STER anime but is indifferent to or outright hates pretty much anything else I've noticed.</br></br>  <br>Anything below decent gets shat on.</br>  The retard staging a coup thinks having magic eye powers gives him the power of the King, but shit don't work that way. A king plays the game; Charles sent Lulu and Spinzaku there just to stir that shit up and laugh as Europa and Euro-Britannia are both fucked by Kingsly's "help" <br><br>Euro-Britannia might've held some influence in Britannia but with that dumbshit eleven pawn murdering the Euro-Britannian nobles Charles won't have to worry about that archduke's faction gaining any influence.<br><br>Also General Smiles would've done nothing wrong if he had executed the parasitic banker aristocracy which is sabotaging the defense of Europe out of their lust to profit off it, but having a strong Europa doesn't play into the geass witch's long-term goal of LOLI PRINCESS TRIUMVIRATE RULING THE EARTH.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More like what the fuck is going on in your post<br><br>-None of them "deserted"<br>-It was obvious since even the very first episode that she had a Geass of some kind<br>-Social media is just another form of media and this is using imperial resources against a more democratic society. Business as usual<br>-The size of each individual force is not important if they can be attacked independently and with the element of surprise. Especially in a motherfucking coup. Those can succeed even against much larger forces if planned right. <br><br><br>It's Part Three out of Five. What resolution did you expect?<br><br><br>-</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's more like I feel a good chunk of the audience is made up of manbabies like yourself who have the mental flexibility of a stone wall.</br></br>  <br><br>It's essentially a regular mecha anime and good enough by that standard. Code Geass is not the only series in the entire world, mate, nor does everything related to it have to be a copy of the TV show.</br></br>  <br><br>They don't actually own the rights to it. I've noticed Sunrise/Bamco seems apprehensive about continuing projects they don't own the sole rights to. Bandai Visual is kind of the king of the whole fuck you we own this shit and we're going to distribute our way on our fucking terms on our exclusive platform and did we mention fuck you. They're doing it with God Eater and probably iDOLM@STER CG next season too by only having it on Daisuki which is the content distribution platform they own and it's just going to needlessly make it harder for people to get access too in the West. They've also blocked pretty much any programming they have on youtube with Japanese dubbing as of a couple weeks ago. Go ahead try to upload a video on youtube with anything they own the rights to and see how long it lasts even if you invoke fair use.<br><br>Anyway I don't expect to see Sunrise do another adaptation for a while unless it's something someone else distributes like Gintama. Light Novels seem pretty much out of the question, doesn't seem like it's part of their M.O anymore.</br></br></br></br>  I like how Lancer instinctively knows not to let Ayano go.<br><br>From what I've seen Leila hasn't been too public with her obvious favoritism, so Ryo has good instinct. Probably had dozens of bishes when he had his own group.</br></br>  <br>It's because people don't have patrician taste and are most likely leechers.<br><br> inb4 muh sekrit club </br></br></br>  <br><br>The animation period looks very high detail and fluid most of the time. It's always neat whenever Sunrise decides to grace us with a sci-fi series these days and I'm suddenly reminded they actually have this thing called a budget and animators with experience at drawing this sort of shit. Unless of course it's given to Fukuda in which case you get what you get.</br></br>  <br><br>He is destined to lose, but I think you're assuming too much without sufficient information about his goals and methods. It seem he has a more complicated connection to Geass beyond simply killing people off. <br><br>Yeah, Charles was going to purge them all in any case. Julius would have done that even without Shin, and without Julius then another member of the Royal family would have sufficed. <br><br>Smilas is also going to lose too. Also, you forget that in the long term all child rulers grow up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I didn't knew that. So tl;dr, don't expect a new Horizon in a short time period. Fuck.<br><br><br>This, if you want to just hit and run, then fuck off and don't even apply for the invite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never hit and run, but I'm not active enough and had 2 accounts suspended due to that.<br><br>Fuck that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Liking Lelouch and Suzaku is fine. The problem is with people who are incapable of enjoying anything else and yet they do watch lots of different anime without this inane Pavlov-derived reflex.</br></br>  <br> Opinions <br> Delusional <br>You're not very good at arguing, m8.</br></br></br>  <br> The problem is with people who are incapable of enjoying anything else <br>You're making a dangerous assumption here by thinking that if someone doesn't prefer certain parts of old CG, that they can't enjoy anything else. <br><br>For me, CG was carried by Lelouch and Suzaku. The mechs and mess of a story didn't draw me in. Claiming that my dislike for Akito means I can't enjoy other anime makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First language French, it's surprisingly good. Disregard the previous answer, it's not "des". <br><br>If you consider that they skip a few articles for briskness' sake, as they should in a military context, there aren't any mistakes. I'm impressed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Akito's characters would definitely benefit from being around on a weekly basis, but failing that I think they've done a decent job showing us in three episodes that they're not necessarily bad people at heart. <br><br>Akito is definitely meant to be a twisted person. He's messed up in the head and that stops him from being normal on the surface. If you really think brother issues in anime began with Naruto you are a newfag of the highest order of newfaggotry. <br><br>Btw, complaining about "fujobait" is so ironic that I'd die with a sword wielded by a masked man crying.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't feel the same fun i had with R1&amp;R2 with /a/.</br></br>  <br>Because that's exactly what Akito is.</br>  <br> but I'm not active enough <br>Become power user and forget about it. 10 torrents is easy as fuck.</br></br>   127407186 <br>Unless you don't have a similarly dismissive attitude towards other shows with mecha, then I think that accusation remains warranted.<br><br>I am describing some, admittedly not all, of the reactions which correspond to that category. <br><br>There's having preferences and then there's being conservative in the worst possible sense of the word. <br><br>Akito is definitely not for everyone, but I think it does a good job combining some of the old and some of the new. That is, for those who do not demand IMMEDIATE SATISFACTION out of something that isn't airing on TV every week.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You can go watch a lot of other shit to have that same sort of "fun" then.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone who uses the terms Ledouche and Spinzaku is qualified to speak about the essence of CG without putting a foot in their own mouths. I prefer the original show, but I think</br>  <br>You need to upload 10 torrents that are downloaded, right? I'm not a content creator, so I'm fucked.<br><br>But yeah, just saying. I stick with public torrents now, no sense going for animebytes when you get kicked for inactivity despite having a good ratio.</br></br></br>  <br>Akito's characters are terrible stereotypes you'd swear came out of a 14 years old fanfiction. Japan likes those.</br>  <br>*I prefer the original show, but I think Akito is fine as an extension or side story. It doesn't to be the same.</br>  <br>There's nothing about immediate satisfaction here, stop trying to project negative connotations to my post.<br><br>I'm someone who wouldn't have watched CG if not for the more lighthearted tones and dramatic actions of Lelouch and Suzaku. Akito doesn't capture that sense of grandiose narrative; thus, I don't enjoy it.<br><br>Saying my tastes are somehow unwarranted and implying I'm a pleb for not liking Akito for anything other than Lelouch and Suzaku is dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your post is a terrible stereotype that you'd swear came out of a 14 year old's mind.</br>  <br> I don't think anyone who uses the terms Ledouche and Spinzaku is qualified to speak <br>Ad hominem is not an argument.</br></br>  <br><br>Was mugged by a gypsy twice. The suffering of a lowly Romanian surrounded by more degenerates.</br></br>  <br><br>True, but after this long it be pointless to just stop.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch was both too serious and edgy, for what it's worth. The new cast isn't all that far removed from him in that respect. They're simply playing different roles. Besides, the new episode had them being less serious and less edgy. I guess it depends on what type of viewer likes or dislikes specific ways to develop characters in a non-weekly format.<br><br>Although, it sounds like you weren't paying a lot of attention about what happened to the old cast by the end of the episode. Lelouch had a mindscrew and is not going to do anything important after this point. Suzaku might, but that's the most I can see.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Has Sunrise ever considered doing hentai? They'd probably destroy virtually any studio on that front. I guess Cross Ange was like a half attempt at it and some scenes in Horizon were halfway there as well but the former really didn't look like an average Sunrise work in terms of production values.</br></br>  <br>its probably even before maoh, hell she was still in the code back then from her followers and cloak</br>  <br>If you don't feel alluded to, fine. But I think that does cover those who see Akito in that manner.<br><br>But I'll give you some credit. This OVA is definitely more serious because it's meant to be a more somber and depressing story. However, it's not without moments of a lighthearted nature, nor did they ignore the use of some dramatic over-the-top actions for those who like that sort of thing. <br><br>Still, it's a more local narrative with only a few grandiose implications in the background rather than the foreground. It might tie up some loose ends for those who wanted to know the origins of Geass or something to that effect (a complaint I never had, personally, but some folks did use to make a big deal out of it).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The EU-Britannia war has been going on for longer than WWII and Japan was not an innocent victim of circumstance. Genbu Kururugi was a big fat jerk. The EU is not a shining beacon of democratic stability and prosperity either. They have more in common with a mix of today's EU and the Roman Empire shortly before its fall than with the UK of the Blitz or the US during the time of their rise to power.</br></br>  <br> best argument is ad hominem <br>Appalling.</br></br>  <br>Responding to ad hominems with ad hominems is fair.</br>  <br> still can't prove a point or explain his reasonings  <br> argument  <br><br>You should pratice what you preach, kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Saying my tastes are somehow unwarranted and implying I'm a pleb for not liking Akito for anything other than Lelouch and Suzaku is dumb. <br>That is the very definition of a pleb. You're like the faggot that calls War in a Pocket shit because Amuro and Char weren't in it.</br></br>   I don't like the cast because they're edgy and unlikable  <br><br>Guess you don't like R1 Lelouch either.</br></br>   tfw there will never be an Oz adaption   <br><br>Sunrise, Toei and maybe P.A Works are about the only studios still in business whose ratios of original works to adaptations are either in balance or tilt the other way. You're probably more likely to see Sunrise animate some sort of cross promotion multimedia thing as Bandai Namco Pictures than you are to see them do an adaptation nowadays as a result of the restructuring that's gone on within the company in the last couple years. They've kind of got their own thing going on that's unique to them. Most anime studios animate stuff that's adapted from light novels or manga and take commission from a publisher. Sunrise is like it's own multimedia thing as part of Bandai Namco, where they work within a certain internal structure to benefit a whole. It's a bit hard to explain but they work totally differently than virtually any other anime studio pretty much because no other studio is owned by a company that does pretty much everything to do with media aside from print which they just have Kadokawa for. Personally I'm surprised they don't have a print division still as they could likely just buy one rather easily.</br></br>  <br>Thank fuck</br>  <br>S1 Lelouch kept you entertained. I'm apathetic towards these new characters, which is probably worse than hating them.</br>  <br>Lelouch could get a free pass because he was full fabulous. Akito and his brother are painful edgemasters.</br>  <br><br>Wasn't their a picture drama for it a while back? That's the one with the whole princess knights of Britannia thing going on right? At least that's the vibe I've gotten off of what I've read and several frames from the manga.</br></br>  <br> Sunrise, Toei and maybe P.A Works are about the only studios still in business whose ratios of original works to adaptations are either in balance or tilt the other way. <br>BONES too.</br></br>  <br> S1 Lelouch kept you entertained <br>Not really he was just a dumber version of Light.<br><br> MUH MEMES <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This chick has the exact same power as Lelouch from what I understand.</br></br>  <br>Someone could at least translate the fucking manga.</br>  <br> these new characters <br> the useless princess who tries not too hard at being less useless <br> the dark, brooding warrior that won't talk much <br> the japanese folks in charge of comic relief <br> edgy, edgy villains being edgy villains <br> the rest are exposition devices at best <br><br>Aside from the boobs and arses and fail to see why anyone would care.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> MUH MEMES <br>Execution is just as important as contents.</br></br>  <br>Are you describing the cast of Akito or Lelouch of the Rebellion?</br>  <br> princess <br>You can at least pretend you know what you're talking about.</br></br>  <br> the useless princess who tries not too hard at being less useless <br>Euphie?<br> the dark, brooding warrior that won't talk much <br>Suzaku?<br> the japanese folks in charge of comic relief <br>The BK?<br> edgy, edgy villains being edgy villains <br>Britannia?<br> the rest are exposition devices at best <br>Too many to list.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's too bad your mind works so simply. I think that's how a child who does not care for any details or nuances would describe them. There is a gist of truth to your mentions, but also a lie, because of what you ignore and spectacularly fail to present in good faith.</br></br>  <br><br>I almost still just consider Bones Sunrise studio 2 operating under a different name that's semi-autonomous. Similar structure, similar kinds of shows, lots of shared staff. They still find themselves working under that whole Bandai Namco umbrella pretty damn often along with I.G and lately a lot of their works still do come from adaptations. You don't claim independence from a company and then pretty much still work with that company as the senior member of a production committee for pretty much everything you do.</br></br>  <br> Are you describing the cast of Akito or Lelouch of the Rebellion? <br><br>Both and neither since it's a bad way to describe either of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Euphie feels like a stretch to me. I also think Layla is a good character he's not giving enough credit to, though.</br>  <br> I also think Layla is a good character <br>What next? Asuna is a good character?</br></br>  Finally got around to watching this. Leila and Ayano are delicious.  <br><br>Is he talking about Leila? As far I gathered she's part of the nobility but not a princess. I think her family was stripped of it's titles for disagreeing with the monarchical structure.</br></br>  I downloaded the AB subs, and in the beginning, when Leila and Ayako are talking, there's a part of their conversation that's not subtitled because the subs decided to have the translation of the onscreen text ("United Republic of Europia Army Garrison Former Warsaw Sports Stadium"). Was that supposed to happen?  <br>French as first language here.<br>Its suprisingly good.<br>Seems that nips are better in french than in english.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Euphie's whole shtick was that she was trying not to be a useless puppet and wanted to help Suzaku and the Japanese with her power which almost worked.</br>  <br><br>You mean Ayano? Who the fuck is Asuna? What is it about Sunrise shows that just completely fuck with peoples abilities to pick up on any details. Like I know it has politics and stuff and most of /a is just around for the SoL stuff and fancy action but Jesus people. What are you all going to do with that GATE show if it actually does have politics scenes that take time away from the waifus. That shows going to be fucked if it does.</br></br>  eh.  <br>Nope. She's had less screen time than Asuna, but there are more details to her. There is a conflict in her ideals beyond what she might think of the protagonist (which is not a sin unless you hate having potential love interests in anime).</br>  <br>No, it shouldn't. It's your setup, I assume.</br>  <br>Lulu a bijin.</br>  <br>I haven't really messed with my settings. I'm pretty sure I have all the defaults. It did that again with the other subtitles when they were in the Warsaw office</br>  <br>gg forever ded</br>  They say that the ship doesn't transport any bombs, then why they hide it in an old sakuradite mine?  <br>What?</br>  Oh shit, its Spinzaku.    <br> Lelouch is the cart driver.  </br>  <br>lelu grew tits?</br>  Why is Lelouch suddenly alive again?  <br>[AH] Code Geass Boukoku no Akito - 03 (BD 1920x1080 x264 FLAC).mkv <br><br>How does this version compare?</br></br></br>  Leila best Geass.  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Takes place between Season 1 and 2.<br><br>Turns out the Emperor decided to use his son with super genius intellect to help him conquer the world while brainwashed instead of just sending him to school.<br><br>That's honestly the thing I like most about Akito.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Shit.</br>  <br>Nah. Akito character who kind of looks like him.</br>  <br>Shit what?</br>  <br><br>Never mind, I misread the subs, they're AH subs. Also I checked the subtitle file, that part has no additional subs. So whoever subbed it simply didn't sub that dialogue</br></br>  <br>Why is Ayano so sensual?</br>  <br>She's waifu bait, kinda like Kallen, or really just about every girl in this series aside from Table-kun's molester.</br>  <br>Or Nana</br>  <br>Is that female lelouch?<br>Only watched the main series.</br></br>  <br>Indeed. Code Geass girls are all great.</br>  <br> Table-kun's molester <br>Let's try to forget all about that</br></br>  <br>For you</br>    <br><br>You absolutely have to watch it. Even when it doesn't particularly make sense or when the plot moves in a completely stupid direction-- it's entertaining as fuck. Everything about that show just pushes you to the next episode. There is never a dull moment.<br><br>Code Geass is like Muv Luv Alternative, but without the depth and the intelligence-- but with all of the constant movement, feeling of intrigue, etc. It fails to be meaningful, but it never once fails to be entertaining and captivating.</br></br></br></br>  My sides. These plebs thinking they can beat motherfucking Kururugi Suzaku. Go get them, my boy.  <br>It's either that or making nukes. Not a lot to remember Nina by.</br>  <br>Yeah, that scene was fun. They are like "He's only one man!"<br><br>Cue Lancelot taking them down one by one.<br><br>Really put things in perspective since this is the same group that beat the Alexanders even with the pilots going Geass Crazy.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Are you sure you don't have that shit reversed? I know people have these raging hard on's for visual novel stuff nowadays and think it's like the pinnacle of writing because it's all wordy and full of constant expository shit but people need to really get over themselves with this shit.</br></br>  <br><br>I really wanted to wait for everything to be out, but I guess it can't be helped after seeing tits and Spinzaku.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck, do I rewatch the other 2 then watch this one or just jump straight in? I had a Geass marathon recently but skipped out on Akito because I knew 3 was coming soon.</br>   everybody else being a bitch <br> suzaku is skating up walls and launching off the ceiling <br><br>r2 really made you forget Suzaku and Kallen were supposed to be special because of how good they were piloting a knightmare, but a lot of that was lost when they both just flew through the sky beamspamming</br></br></br>    This episode is basically Europe succumbs to shitposter.  <br><br>Jesus fuck that scene was good. Guess we know now why it took so damn long for this to be released.</br></br>  <br>He who controls shitposting controls the world.<br><br>Julius Kingsley knows this.</br></br></br>  <br>a FABULOUS shitposter</br>  <br>Because that's their forward base to approach Western Europe from the North, I imagine.</br>  <br>It's actually pretty well written.</br>  <br>Where did my 2D mecha go, Sunrise?</br>    <br>That's what happens when you make all posters equals. <br><br>In Britannia only the best posters get to have opinions. <br><br>All hail Britannia!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dear god, that anatomy.</br>  <br> Code Geass is like Muv Luv Alternative, but without the depth and the intelligence <br><br>I hate it to break it to you, but Muv-Luv is neither of those things. It just has a more grimdark setting and despair to go along with it. That's what people mistake for "depth" or "intelligence" when in reality it's just a space monster/horror movie with robots.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, not quite sure if you've actually read it. I don't think you'd be saying what you were saying if you had.<br><br>Muv Luv Alternative is one of the best stories I've ever read. Period. All mediums. And I read a lot of novels.<br><br>The downside is that you have to read garbage to read MLA. But its worth it. And the parts that are the best are not at all the expository segments. It's mostly about the setup and the way that MLA is able to create believable surprises. The foreshadowing and world building allow for surprises that feel immediately plausible without being predictable.<br><br>Contrast this to like.... Huck Finn. Everything is foreshadowed. Mark Twain reveals damn near everything he's going to do by like chapter 20.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're mixing things up. There are millions of people in the world and thousands of pilots in armies. It's insane of you to suggest that Suzaku and Kallen should be the only good pilots in the universe. Especially when the thing that's the least attributed to a pilot is the use of acrobatics. That's technology and not some sort of monopoly of two people. Rolo used Vincent well too and jumped around just like the Lancelot did.</br></br>  <br><br>Gundam Unicorn (which also had some 3D mecha in between 2D scenes of robots) ate them. BF got the leftovers.</br></br>  <br> Code Geass is like Muv Luv Alternative, but without the depth and the intelligence <br><br> Muv Luv Alternative <br> depth and intelligence </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>M-L is just another variation on Higurashi with a ton of stuff bolted on the sides, man.</br></br>  Muv-Luv was a generic SoL harem romance VN or something that basically transforms into XCOM in the middle and then you go insane watching your waifus get eaten and raped in front of you until you burn with the rage of a thousand suns, joining up the military where you distinguish yourself as Anon "Mad Dog" Moose, earning the recognition of the Commander who sends you to ESP Academy and eventually become the Volunteer who will be imbued with the net psychic force of all mankind and send those ayyliums fucking packing ALL BECAUSE MAI WAIFU IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAD.  So damn cute.  <br>Man, if you can kill your imouto you're trash.</br>  <br>Why she want Akito D so much?</br>  <br>Because they're both sole survivors<br>And because Akito is literally a zombie and she feels sorry for him</br></br>  Because Leila is canonically a huge weeaboo, and Akito is a prettyboy eleven.  So, basically, Lelouch is just the biggest shitposter of internet?  <br> Canadians pretty much curbstomped the Americans <br><br>You mean the British, right?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Takes place inbetween S1 and S2 <br> All this time thought that Akito was after R2 </br></br></br></br>  <br>Explain</br>    <br> thought this was after R2 <br> after watching all 3 <br> acedefective.png <br>Hehehe</br></br></br></br>  <br>R2 was one gigantic shitpost, think about it<br>It just snowballed to the point where when he said every body get on the floor and do the dinosaur, you cried because he dieded</br></br>  <br>dank af</br>  <br>This post make me laugh so much.<br>What where you thinking?<br> Lelouch is dead/have dissapear at the end of R2 <br> zomg come back alive out of nowhere under his father geass influence. </br></br></br></br>  No  <br>That's wrong.</br>  Leila  Leila's lesbian gal pal  <br> 'bring back memories' <br><br>God dammit you and your pun, anon.</br></br></br>  femLelouch  <br>She has a real talent for being worst girl.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Goddamit. Should I just wait until we have an authoritative release that people can agree on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's the Bake girl on the left? I'm drawing a blank here.<br> crop and reverse image search <br> Higasa <br>Literally who?</br></br></br></br>  Hyuuga's girl toy  <br>You gotta admit, Maaya Sakamoto's voice is pure sex. Whenever she voices a character, it's always orgasmic. <br><br>On topic: did Akito survive the whole fucking clan massacre thing because he's an experiment? It seems that him and his brother were orphans to the clan.</br></br></br>  <br>I used ghettoFlax. They basically used the BD's official BDs with some adjustments and one meme reference <br><br><br>She only appeared once, in Hanamonogatari. Kanbaru's classmate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The release on the OP is fine. Don't be autistic.</br>  <br>BD's official subs*</br>  <br>An extra on the Hanamonogatari (Suruga's 2nd Arc). She's one of Suruga's friends.</br>  So I liked R1 and even R2, would I like this? Does it still feel like CG? My problem with OVA's is that a lot of the time they feel distant from the series they are from  <br>If you're expecting a trainwreck like S2 or a flamboyant MC like Lelouch you'll end up disappointed.<br><br>The OVAs are more focused and sober, though you do get cameos of Lelouch/Suzaku/C.C.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn that is what always keeps me coming back to CG, I just love how much of a maniac gets when drunk on his own power. Not to mention the out of no where plot turns.</br>  All I'm waiting for is the Geass Remake that will be announced after Akito ends in October as part of Geass' 10th anniversary celebration.  <br>If you want to watch a CG without all of the fun and personality, then pick up Akito.<br>If not, then don't even consider it.</br></br>  <br>Story is more of the same, but you can't really compare Akito to Lelouch or Suzaku. Dude is more cold and serious.<br><br>Also see  . If you don't mind 3D KMF fights you should give it a try. Plus Leila a cute.</br></br></br>  You think there'll be a Kallen cameo? She wasn't in captivity so might be possible.<br><br>On that note, Hyuuga revealed Zero is still alive. I guess the nobles didn't took that news seriously otherwise the world wouldn't have been surprised that Zero was still around in R2.<br><br>Space-time what. I smell the groundworks for a new series.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Geass Remake <br>Nah, maybe a prequel or sequel involving different characters.</br></br>  Someone refresh my memory.<br><br>Didn't EU get completely steamrolled by Britannia by the time R2 came around?<br><br>Does this mean we're going to have a bad end where Leila and Akito get fucked? And to be honest, I don't think they can stand up to the combined might of plot armour Suzaku and super genius Lelouch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they do a CG remake they best leave lelouches death up in the air still.<br><br><br>I'd love a prequel of just C2's/V2 interactions with Geass early on as well as the rise of britannia. However, it wouldn't be CG without lelouch</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. That's what we're all waiting for I think, for Suzaku to murder the shit out of everyone.</br>  <br>by remake do you mean those Lelouch of the Rebellion movies they said might happen?</br>  <br>fuck yes. ill watch anything sunrise does as long as theres mechs and fanservice. they have perfected the combo for entertainment.</br>  <br>I'm not sure if you could successfully remake CG, I mean you could just out some of the filler, but you would still lose a good amount of character building and re-enforcement that is needed to understand why lelouch continues to do what he does</br>  <br> mfw her clothes matches the Geass symbol </br>  <br> Does this mean we're going to have a bad end where Leila and Akito get fucked? And to be honest, I don't think they can stand up to the combined might of plot armour Suzaku and super genius Lelouch. <br><br>Nope, it's heavily implied in this OVA that they're going to escape to Japan when shit starts going down. The real question is, how would Leila's Geass come into play?<br><br>Also, can someone really clarify wtf is wrong with Akito and Smilas' connection with the Geass Organization? It seems that Sunrise is planning another sequel and/or side story in time for the 10th anniversary. If they're doing a sequel, I hope that whatever they do with Lelouch's character, they put it into good use. Not just some knight in shining armour comeback like Inaho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Leila and Akito abandon the EU?<br>Where were they during R2 then? Didn't even seem them as part of Lelouch's resistance.</br></br>  <br><br>Depends on what kind of person you are. There are fans of CG S1 and R2 that like Akito. It feels more like CG than a lot of the other shows that have come since, but it isn't exactly the same. I would find that boring, personally, despite enjoying the original series very much. That said, unlike you I always appreciate the concept of OVAs trying to do their own thing without slavishly following their main source material.</br></br>  <br><br>Well that sucks, I never really thought of CG as being a super serious anime. It has its serious parts but should not be 100% serious.<br><br>I mean come on magical eye birds that change everything? It can only be so serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it really lacks the flair of Code Geass. At least until Julius Kinsley appears. <br><br>It does have cool robot fights and you actually get a look at the EU which is something that was really missing. Also, hot girls, because this is CG.</br></br></br>  <br>What made R2 work wasn't the real or perceived trainwreck but the fact it was fun and wrapped up well, with a regular focus on Lelouch. It doesn't mean you need that to happen in every other part of the show, but I can see why people should adjust their mindsets to be more flexible.</br>   akito was cart driver <br> he was taking her into the european countryside to have lots of yuri sex with the witch Leila </br>  <br> why wasn't this character, who was created years later, in a show that already ended? </br>  <br>I just got burned on a lot of OVA's ending up feeling like cash grabs/fanservice call outs instead of something that could fit well into the plot. LotGH, Gintama, and a FEW other ones are the only ones that pulled it off decently enough to where it felt true to the original series.<br><br><br>Fuck you S;G, your ova was shit, at least Amagi's OVA(but that was just an unaired episode) was nice and got my faith back up</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There will be more Code Geass but you are heavily jumping the gun by unilaterally assuming there will be any remake or that they would feel it is even necessary.</br></br>  <br>That's what I'm asking. It makes much more sense that they died, since I can't see them fleeing to Japan and then laying low instead of joining Zero instead. Doubly so that they are both aware of his existence.</br>  <br><br>This is not even 100% serious either. Just more emphasis on the darker side.</br></br>  <br>Would it work as a drinking game? might marathon all 3 this weekend since I have the 4th off</br>  <br><br>Technically Shin said:<br><br>"Julius was Zero!"<br><br>"But now I killed him!"<br><br>"Anyway, you're fucked. Britannia is coming after us and we hate them anyway, so let's fight!"<br><br>"Or not. But then you'll get your heads cut off rather nicely. Like this".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AB even has a thread that specifically spoonfeeds you links to stuff that you can upload to there. I've seen quite a fair number of people hit PU just from the contents in that thread alone.</br>  <br>Yeah, by R2 Suzaku and Schneizel had pretty much beaten Europe. <br><br>As it is we have three things going on right now. The European Brits declaring independence under Akito's brother, the military about to launch a coup in the EU who has some connections to the Geass cult, and Suzaku and Lelouch. <br><br>So it's all a big SNAFU.<br><br>Chances are this ends with Akito and the others leaving the military and maybe going to Japan. Provided they survive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Although it'd be an edgy drinking game more than anything.<br><br> Marathon <br>It's only like 3 hours long dude.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This character was a perfect excuse for more material</br>  <br>Honestly I wasn't a fan of R2. To be more precise the 2nd half of R2 (save for the final episode). <br><br>The plot developments made no sense whatsoever and you can tell Taniguchi was pressured to change hinted story lines so that the show could be more easily processed by a mainstream audience that demanded twists for twists' sake (it aired at ~5PM or so).</br></br></br>  <br><br>We don't know if this is the same Geass organization or a different one that is separate from C.C.'s group.<br><br>It's hard to tell what Sunrise is planning.<br><br>A true sequel would work only if they have concept that's so great it can make up for messing with the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is this show getting more dubs<br><br>This ended years ago</br></br>  <br>I'll give you a hint, it's a word that begins with "M" and ends in "oney".<br><br>CG is a cash cow</br></br></br>  <br>And a Marathon is about 2.</br>  <br><br>Honestly, anime exists to make money. It's all a cashgrab. <br><br>The thing is, it's possible to make something interesting or at least entertaining (and vice versa) even within that framework. 0080, 08th MS Team and other Gundam spin-offs were cool, in their own ways, despite having big differences compared to Tomino's shows. Unicorn itself was nice too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats that?

Second half was still fun, but it just felt a bit off to me. The elf MMO wasn't nearly as interesting as the original MMO, Kirito's fairy avatar sort of sucked and big titted sister wasn't nearly as likeable a sidekick as Asuna. It was nice to see Yui return and have a larger role though. <br><br>Death Gun arc is okay, but it's a bit disappointing that all the previous characters haven't really been doing much. Especially Asuna. I'm hoping she'll return to being the action chick she was instead of just the girlfriend who does nothing. <br><br>Also, what the fuck is up with Kirito's avatar in GGO? Hoping it'll be explained why it looks so feminine and how it's apparantly a rare character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> someone posts not-/a/ related pic <br> he must be a crossboarder!! <br>I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/</br></br></br>  <br>this cancer infested /v/ and /g/ as well</br>  I almost killed myself during the S2 second arc.<br><br>I didn't learn from S1</br></br>  <br>/v/ has been cancer for years now, newshit.</br>  This scene was just bad and awkward. <br><br> Actual sex implication <br> Asuna confirmed slut <br> Virtual reality fucking period </br></br></br></br>  <br>2 YEARS OF SEMEN</br>  <br> Sleeping with your boyfriend makes you a slut </br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/filena<wbr>me/1429958174521.jpg/<br>I wonder why someone would bring 3DPD reaction images and their garbage memes to other boards and then pretend to belong to the board.</br></wbr></br>  <br> I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/ <br>sure dude<br><br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br><br> if you don't follow the rules you don't "belong" to /a/  <br>How does it feel being no fun allowed faggot?<br>Must be hard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel World <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Nope.

Or more like sad.</br>  <br> I can take out 50 other players alone just because I'm that good! <br>This is bullshit<br><br> Kirito can take out 200 players alone because he wields Excalibur <br>That's at least slightly reasonable b/c we dont know stats of that weapon<br><br>but still<br> they clear 40 man dungeon in 5 because they're just that good <br><br>All decent MMOs copy WoW and they have berserk timers and they'd just get wiped for not having enough DPS. This entire show is fucking fake.<br><br>Good this I only watched it ironically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>iirc, character models are randomly pulled so that feminine looking model type is rare in terms of RNG for male avatars</br>  <br>This makes me happy.</br>  <br> a zerg rush of Korean and Chinese gamers <br>Fund it.

All he did was buy enough time for Asuna and friends to break through the party in their way and get into the boss room<br><br> this entire show is fucking fake <br><br>Fair point but they're bending the rules in order to help tell the story. Is it poor writing? Debatable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can write pages upon pages of what I found wrong with the characters and story, but as far as an action show goes it was pretty decent aside from some of the scenes in the gun arc. Although there was so much unintentional comedy during those scenes.</br>  <br> Any words on S3? <br>One of the producers said he'd like to see it animated. I guess that's a good thing?<br><br> Are the latest books translated yet? <br>All of them are translated...

Is it worth buying the console and game just to play?</br></br></br>  <br>buying a console for a single game is always bad idea IMO.</br>  <br><br>Grabbed it early a couple days ago, reading through it right now. Kirito is aware that he's autistic.<br><br> In the month that I'd been trapped in this castle, I'd been hell-bent on survival, on powering myself up through whatever means I could find. Had I ever even stopped to regret my decision to jump into Sword Art Online? <br> Regret would be the normal choice. Anyone who didn't regret getting stuck in here was insane. But no matter how far back I scrolled through my emotional event log, despite the presence of terror or homesickness, there were no hits for "regret." <br> So either I was insane, or the circumstances never gave me enough breathing room to even consider regretting my choice. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the shitposting general?   SAO lets you bathe dark elf NPCs <br><br>Man, even without the two years glopping, how were they allowed to sell this to kids?</br></br>  <br>Wasn't in the beta. Not even the glopping.<br><br>Once your game becomes a death game that traps its players, it doesn't matter who it sells to, you can put whatever you want in the final release.</br></br></br>  Seems like you can marry dark elf NPCs as well, if you have the permission of their queen.  <br> Marrying NPCs <br> In a game set to delete itself upon completion <br>Is it encouraging you to kill all the front-line players?</br></br></br>  <br>Laughing Coffin did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Speaking of,<br> Morte <br> It's Showtime <br><br>Man, they've been around since the third fucking floor.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much rape will season 3 feature?  <br>Some off-screen mind-rape, and then some very prim-and-proper double rape with fancy silk rope in a fancy bed, with just a few centimeters away from penetration.</br>  <br>Elegant rape isn't rape.</br>  Considering how Asuna treats NPCs in Progressive, I don't see any way for her reaching the point of using them as bait for the field boss.<br><br>Another retcon can't hurt that bad, I guess.</br></br>  <br>She will use her self sacrifice attack to save them from a boss or something in future floors I bet since she should have originally died anyways. This will be the sad moment.</br>  Seeing the Afterword mention volume 14, Eugeo and Alicization and what not is an odd feeling since the English volumes are still at 5.<br><br>Aria was confirmed for being written for the anime, but the content was twice the amount requested. I suppose the way it turned out couldn't be helped after all.</br></br>    forgot to clarify this is this recent episode of SAO where Sinon gets almost allegedly raped  Are there any more situations in the novels where Sinon openly flirts with Kirito?<br><br>That shit she pulled during that short thor arc was fucking perfect.</br></br>  <br><br>The butthurt is hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I'm honestly surprised someone didn't make something like this sooner.</br>  If they wanted this to be a harem anime, why'd Kirito get with Asuna so early in the series?  <br>Despite how shitty SAO is, that scene was really cute.</br>  <br>Oh, I haven't checked in on Toonami General since they got into the cave.</br>  <br>Well I only started doing it as I needed something to feel in the time between shows I didn't want to watch like naruto</br>  <br>Oh wait this is recent?

So no, basically, default Elf stuff does not apply.</br></br>  <br><br>dammit, saw people posting about everyone being elves now so i was wondering if sinion the cockmocker was an elf too</br></br>  <br>Oh god. I'm going to get very angry at the two assholes for the second bit</br>  <br>Cats are a type of elf in the game, aren't they?</br>  <br>well they can fly, but they act and look like cats.<br>so unless they go to heat, they don't enjoy the dickings.<br><br> poking a fire-arrow into your nostril </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Did the /a/ threads blow up as hard as these on the same episodes?

Was the ending good enough for you?  <br>Neutral here. I think yuri fags score a massive win over hetero fags. No doubt about it</br>  <br>I am. It could be better but it was good.</br>    I MISS KUMIKO ALREADY  Wow, OP.<br><br>There was another untapped Hibike! thread somewhere in the catalog and you plowed right through it.</br></br>  <br>i was expecting a bit more, it kinda ended without ever explaining anything. did they get to go to nationals or no? <br><br> <br>shitichi's glum face in the scene right after this was priceless.</br></br></br></br>  I HATE YURIFAGS  <br>apparently so does  Kyoani </br>    <br>It was good but it wasn't really an ending. There needs to be a second season.</br>  <br>What a gay picture.</br>  I didn't watch this, but tell me if Shoe-kun won  <br>What?, how dense are you?.</br>  <br>He had this scene, so you be the judge.</br>  Wait, so what happened? I admit, I didn't watch the show at all, in the slightest, but went to the threads anyways. Who won?  <br><br><br> someone winning in a kyoani show <br>Mochi doesn't count.</br></br></br></br>  Well that was nice and all, but there better be some kind of sequel or that's going to stand as an extremely weak ending  <br>No one. Anime ended the same way the first volume of the novel did.</br>  <br> reina holding her own hands <br> yuri </br></br>  <br>Short answer, no one<br><br>Long answer, Shuichi, see </br></br></br>  <br> her own hands <br>I'm not even a yurifag, and I'll still say you're retarded.</br></br>  <br>Shoeitchy got friendzoned so fucking hard, it's a riot! Hetfags are doing their silly little dance of damage control, but LOVE WINS once more!</br>  <br>Crunchyroll lied<br>Romance died.</br></br>  <br>CR pls leave</br>  Was hoping for atleast a kiss.

That was like a promise for a second season, right? or at least a movie or something? I think just a movie to cover the nationals competition would be pretty good.  <br> KyoAni <br> Kiss <br><br>First timer?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko shuns the guy and the ending is Kumiko and Reina holding hands tightly<br><br>how is that an open end?</br></br></br>  What was her name again?  <br>It's an end that basically means yuri, but plays it safe by not being explicit.</br>  <br>Opal-chan</br>  Hey did you guys know that anime was based off American cartoons?    <br>why is Maki playing a euphonium?</br>  <br>Because Reina still loves Taki and the point is hammered home when she looks all hot and bothered the moment she sees him wearing his classy tuxedo, which means there's no fucking conclusion to any romantic loose ends. Shuichi still wants to bone Kumiko but doesn't get anything. Reina still wants to be boned by Taki, but doesn't dare to approach him and thus had not even a chance of getting rejected. And whatever you believe it is that Kumiko wants in regards to romance, she didn't get it either. That's how it's an open end.</br>   We got to hear the entire song <br> They animated the shit out of all of it <br>Aside from like 10 seconds of background CG, that was a phenomenal last episode. Obviously I want another season, as that was only a fraction of the entire story, but as a first season that was great.</br></br>  <br>There isn't going to be a 2nd season.</br>  <br>Those ugly feet. Yuck!</br>  <br>Midget-chan</br>  <br>How do feet look in your world, anon?</br>    <br>This.</br>  good ending, though they didnt explain anything, obviously they are going into then nationals. Kimiko said "our piece goes on" which mean they made it. It leaves it open for a season 2. I read that the studio will pull a k-on on this show and bring it back next year. I hope its a full on 25 episodes. Great show, enjoyed it to the last minute. <br><br><br>http://when-will.net/anime/1333-wil<wbr>l-there-be-sound-euphonium-season-2<wbr>-release-date.html<br><br>^ not sure how reliable but its something.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>D E N B T S<br>E<br>N<br>B<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ponytail scene was better than a kiss  <br>The "our piece goes on" was already a fucking confirmation in my book.

Ah well, here, have the non-fucked version.</br></br>  I screwed up the font size on three of the bubbles so I went in and fixed that. Sorry about that.                      I want you to imagine a world in which every rom-com/harem manga had Oka in it.  Imagine how often misunderstandings would get solved. How quickly they would get solved...  Did you think we were in for 20 chapters of confusion and wavering resolve?  Fuck that noise.  <br>poor akalyn, someone should just marry her already</br>  Oka, best wingman you could ever have.  Next time on Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa,<br>HELL YEAH MOTHERFUCKER!</br>  And now... for something different.  Special shout out to everyone on the staff who worked their butts off to not only bring you chapter 84, but this as well.<br><br>They really kicked a lot of ass this week.<br><br>In honor of the anime starting, here's the re-edited, re-translated, chapter 1.</br></br></br></br>  I'd also like to point out there are a lot of parallels between chapter 84 and this one. It hits a lot of the same notes.      <br>Thanks for the chapter</br>      <br><br>Any time. Glad someone's awake to see it.</br></br>    <br>Empty speech balloons?</br>    <br>  Glasses calls her Akalyn <br><br>Balls of fucking steel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Son of a bitch. Let me fix that.</br></br>  <br> I want you to imagine a world in which every rom-com/harem manga had Oka in it. <br>I swear if he doesn't get the Mikan then there's no justice in this world.</br></br>                    Oka is best boy.      See what I mean? Whenever Asahi is wavering or doesn't know what to do, Oka steps in and says what needs to be said.  Man, forgot how much I still liked the first chapter.    <br><br>It really is a good series. Consistent quality with the writing.</br></br>    This chapter is fucking long.          Tarage,<br>Are you planning on re-doing Underdog's releases?</br>    <br><br>All of them? No. I had always wanted to re-do chapter one with better scans. We might do a few more, but most of the Underdog chapters are just fine in terms of quality.</br></br>  This was mostly just a fun side project in celebration of the anime starting.                  It's hard to notice since she's always so happy in the manga, but Youko was really sad and alone before Asahi found out about her secret. She lived a very depressing life.            <br> it might not want you want to hear <br>add "be" after not</br></br>  <br>Give Sakura a couple of years<br><br>Also I'd love to hear Demon's stories of love.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Thanks! Fixing right now.</br></br>    <br>It's so weird to think that Dumon is a grandma, meaning that she at one point popped out a child or two.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you put "sfx: ..." at the bottom or side considering it's an important one</br>  And that's chapter 1... but you already knew that.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for reading guys! I'll upload the archives to Batoto/the FwPA website after a bit more TLC.

I know she's dumb as a box of rocks, but is she really that dense?  <br><br>Yep... fixing that right now.</br></br>  I noticed Dumpire doesn't speak with an accent anymore did that get removed in later chapters or do you just not bother with it?  <br>She actively tries to suppress it and it only appears when she lets down her guard.</br>  <br><br>Partially because we don't want to make her sound TOO southern, but partially because we forget sometimes. Sorry.<br><br><br><br>I wish we were that clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's fine I was just wondering</br>  <br>Really, from here, Youko can look like a 'cool beauty'.<br><br>Too bad Asahi changes that, all for the sake of her having a happy school life.</br></br></br>  Compare <br><br><br>with<br><br><br><br><br>Pottery</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "my complete opposite" <br> turns out incredibly similar <br>Poetry?</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, you're right about it having the 'same beat', Oka is once again the one with the most insight and the most balls to actually bring up Asahi-related romance.</br>  <br> "Hurry!! Towel!!" <br> "Someone throw in the towel!!" <br> "Hurry and stop the match!!" <br>Best bros<br><br>Also, unrelated to anything, why do Japanese use two exclamation marks instead of three? I don't think English ever use "!!" in anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's why I love this manga. The author knows when to do callbacks to previous chapters, and knows how to apply them correctly. Not everything has to be a flashback.<br><br>He's a lot more skillful than people know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Shima looks halfway cool and decent here.<br><br>What a difference 2 years worth of chapters make.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had a crush on her because of how she looked and acted, but he actually fell in love with her once he realized who she really was. Oka even comments about it at one point.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if the series will end with Youko entering a classroom with Asahi doing something secretive. <br><br>Like, I don't know, write "I love Youko" several times on that blackboard.</br></br></br>  <br> Actually, I think you're ridiculously cute <br>Based</br></br>  <br>I wonder if this is how Youko's dad responded to Youko's mom finding out he's a vampire.</br>  <br><br><br>Shame Oka is just a Ghost.</br></br></br>  <br>The way she's going, she still wouldn't get the memo</br>  <br>You know, I forget Asahi can't keep a secret and is super easy to read. Was it ever brought up in recent chapters? Besides the beginning of 84 where he's just dead, of course.</br>  <br>Oh man, this chapter already introduces the three girls that will be part of Asahi's harem, two of which starts off rather antagonistic, albeit Alium's more cold than cruel.</br>  <br><br>He still can't. He's just surrounded by people with secrets and he's too busy tsukkomi-ing to spill them.<br><br>Plus everyone around him is an idiot, so no one would notice anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This can't be square 1, they didn't start out kissing.<br><br>This is like square finish minus 8 spaces.</br></br></br>  <br>This is dumpire we're talking about. It's square 1.<br>Even after this, it's fuckign square 1</br></br>  <br>Wait to chapter 101. Her accent appears in the best place.</br>  <br> chapter 101 <br>This is just a ploy to get me to read a super lewd chapter!</br></br>  <br>Ok, you have my attention. Do you have proof?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure densei actually killed him during the Maid Cafe incident</br>  <br>God, even the guy who has a crush on her is scared out of his life. Poor Akari.</br>  <br>I don't know why.</br>  <br>The look of fear on everyone's faces is fucking great</br>  <br>I can see Oka getting Mikan, and Sakurada getting Sensei (eventually), but I can't see Shima getting a happy ending.</br>  <br> densei actually killed him during the Maid Cafe incident </br>  <br>Maybe Alium's brother will embrace the homo inside him</br>  <br>Either new character or one of the Alium.</br>  <br>One of these people?<br><br> if they can get out of Asahi's harem </br></br></br>  <br>Poor Granddumber.</br>  <br><br><br>Shima will get  Dumon </br></br></br>  <br>That'll just make Dumon even sadder than she already is.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to Shima anon.<br>Anyway it's the only way that her family will continue</br></br>  <br>New girls are really cute.</br>  <br>That fucking Shima. How can a character be so funny?</br>  <br>The new boy is also really cute.<br><br>I want him with Asahi's sister.</br></br></br>  <br> Even Sakurada is afraid! </br>  Missed out on 83, that ending.  ;_; <br><br><br>Damn.<br><br><br>Not with this manga. It pretends it will then goes right for your heart.<br><br><br>They are such bros.<br><br><br>Fantastic. You go asahi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep forgetting that Kuromine even has a sister</br>  <br>How can you forget someone who beats him in the popularity poll?</br>  <br><br>Oh man. There's never a shortage of reaction faces in this manga.</br></br>  <br> harem <br>Isn't Durriken another granddaughter?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>The glasses dude looks too much like Rin to be unrelated to Asahi. Box girl might be yet another granddaughter.<br><br>Is Succubi from the future too?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Succubi is just a normal girl. Think of her as a new generation Dumpire, a girl with a secret who evades people so the secret doesn't come out.<br><br>And the only thing we know about glasses guy is that he reads porn mags all the time and maybe his glasses are the pervert god of fortune.</br></br></br>  <br>What about his sword?</br>  <br>Well the theme is sill there, like everyone and their mothers know who Asahi actually loves, but because Yoko is really fucking dense she just doesn't notice. It isn't the main point anymore, but it is there.</br>  <br>He's Asahi's great-grandson</br>  <br>That's too moe, my heart</br>  <br>She has her moments</br>  <br>Nobody deserves Shima.</br>  <br>I wonder what's Dumon's plan. Half the school are monster girls and the other half are Asahi's family. And there's Shima too.</br>  So how long until dumpire completely gives into the dark side?  <br>goddamn, Asahi has one sexy neck.</br>  <br>Shiragami sure thinks so</br>  Dumpire/Eromine best couple 2015  Kuromine has a sister? Wow.  <br>And she's more popular than he is with readers.</br>  <br>And she's the tsukkomi of her generation, too.</br>  <br>  alternate futures implied to exist <br>  glasses guy is alternate Rin, if she were born male </br></br>  <br>The sword is Asahi's great-grandson?<br><br>Dammit, Asahi's grandson, what are you fucking?</br></br></br>  <br> street sigh </br>  <br>Deskpire is a cute</br>    <br>Tell me the letter hasn't been in there this whole fucking time.</br>  <br>I hope she has a harem.</br>  <br>Too late, everyone died.</br>  <br>There's a glassless Oka on the far left, first row?</br>  <br><br><br>Sakurada went full merchant mode.</br></br></br>  <br>I care, thank you for your efforts</br>  <br>Myabe it's just Escherichia coli O157.</br>  <br>Back to your containment board</br>  <br> merchant mode. <br>?</br></br>  <br>What's she saying? All I get is "could it be that my dream" and something about asahi's path</br>  <br>Thanks for your hard work.</br>  <br>That's the chapter when both decide that they will become teachers, so something about that I guess.</br>  <br>They've been talking about their plans for the future in that chapter. Here, she's saying that she was thinking maybe her dream is the same as Asahi's future plans.</br>  <br>Could it be that my dream is the same as Asahi's path</br>  <br> path <br>Path? What the fuck? How did I get path?<br><br>Anyway, what this  said.</br></br></br></br>  Some new anime art from Nyantype.  <br>Course, route, path, it's kinda the same to me</br>  <br>Oka and Dumon best pair</br>  <br>I guess 'course' should be a better word because 'life course' makes sense to me, than 'life path'.<br><br>But English is like my third language, I'm not sure yet of its subtleties.</br></br></br>  So then. This will need a hentai dōjinshi at some point. Aaaaaaaaaand you know, some one will have to do it.  <br>It will get one faceless men doujin and one really poorly drawn vanilla and forgotten about.</br>    <br> them hips <br>HNNNNGGGG my dick is diamonds<br><br> aliums tits stuck together <br>boner ded</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we only get those scanlated <br> the very few vanilla ones won't even be scanned <br><br>Who do you think would be the 'breakout' character, so to speak? Mikan? The Pervert?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It will get one faceless men doujin  <br>If Fatalpulse does it, I won't mind.</br></br>  <br>I will change the faceless man for Shima's face.<br><br><br>That's a nice color page. I hope for a cleaned version.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3DPD <br>Fucking horrible.</br></br>  <br> I will change the faceless man for Shima's face. <br>The hero we need.</br></br>  <br> no box girl <br>What a shame. Also, any anon care to remind me what did she say to Mikan?</br></br>  <br> Shima rape doujin <br> The raped is Alium's brother </br></br>  <br>Something like that Mikan will be the one who will decide the future, that something she will do will open different timelines or something like that.</br>  <br>That's not a doujin, that's the manga itself.</br>  <br> my monster secret is I'm a vampire </br>  <br>looks like everyone simultaneously crapped their pants</br>  <br>What point?</br>  <br>I guess he means this</br>  <br> Rejected by girls can take care of themselves </br>  <br>So are the antics of dimouto and friends closer to the comedy SOL aspect of the manga than its romance aspect?</br>  <br>So far yes.</br>  <br> he's gotten a lot better over time <br>Subtle lampshade hanging over how his defining characteristic has been set aside in favor of making him generic bland self-insert MC-kun</br></br>  <br>He isn't that bad. At least the denseness is concentrated in the girls instead of the MC.</br>  <br>His feelings still show on his face all the time, it's just that everyone around him has gotten almost as bad. The only reason why he's been able to keep secrets is that the important ones are so crazy that no one would ever ask about them.</br>  <br>He was aware that Alium was going to confess in the beach. Just for that he's better than 90% of harem MCs</br>  <br><br><br>But that anon is right, Asahi isn't bad in the sense that He can't be annoying because He's literally nothing, just a walking plot device meant to cause the girls' interactions. Better than a dense AND hyper bland self-insert MC, but He's still barely a character. I never liked his original characterization, but it's still much better than being nothing.<br><br>Inb4 but He's the normal guy among weirdos. Normal doesn't mean bland.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also didn't mean that as a BAD thing. It's just how the genre is.</br>  <br><br>If you are , you wrote that His characterization got blander, it's hardly not a bad thing.<br><br>Anyway, if many manga of this genre share the same problem, it doesn't mean that it isn't a flaw, especially when it's something that could be fixed without causing side effects for the rest of the manga.<br><br>Talking about change, Even Mikan's characterization changed, but it just got much better. With Asahi we had just a de-characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you planning on re-doing Underdog's releases? <br>what's the poing on doing this?</br></br>  <br>It was me, yeah.<br>Mikan is different, because she's a girl. She's actually a character. MC-kun has to be bland because theappeal of the whole genre is that you can easily self-insert into him and see yourself interacting with the cue, quirky girl of your choice without thinking "oh yeah but if I was MC-kun I'd fuck it up because of this weird personality trait he has." He's got none!<br>Is it a flaw of the genre? I don't know, I think it's more like a feature. Personally I think that's what most of us see even in Jitsu wa... Even if it's kinda embarassing to admit.</br></br></br>  <br><br> He <br> His <br>Fucking Germans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They might just think Asahi is God.</br>  <br>Fixing chapters with low-quality raws, bringing every chapter to the standard of quality of recent chapters, things like that.<br><br>It'd be a total waste of time, though, and I'd really rather they put their efforts more towards catching up with the weekly releases than anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>In German you don't capitalize pronouns, just nouns though.</br>  <br><br>We're never going to catch up to weekly raws for reasons I've stated before, but mostly because as soon as we switch from tank raws to magazine raws, things get much harder. There's always going to be a gap.<br><br>We're just going to fix a handful of chapters that have some quality issues. Like I said, most of the Underdog chapters are perfectly fine. There's no need to replace all that hard work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any particular chapters you're going to fix?</br>  <br><br>Of the top of my head, I know 2 needs a bit more love. Other than that, I don't remember.<br><br>Feel free to call out some chapters that you'd like to see redone and we'll definitely take a look at them.<br><br>Keep in mind that we're going to do this when we have spare time, so there is no time table for when these v2s will come out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Keep in mind that we're going to do this when we have spare time, so there is no time table for when these v2s will come out. <br>Of course. Maybe not to the point of catching up, but new chapters will always be the priority.<br><br>Speaking of that, what is the current hard wall of tank raws at right now?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We've got 11 in our grubby hands, and 12 is coming out shortly I believe.</br></br>  <br>Which chapters are in those?</br>  <br><br>Volume 11 goes up to 97. Don't know about volume 12 yet.</br></br>  <br>Any idea if you'll hit that wall by scanlating everything already available in tanks?</br>  <br><br>Not for a long time. Expect a chapter about every week for a good long while. Give or take a few days of course.</br></br>  <br><br>Is this real? I've seen nothing in the raws to support it... but damn, that makes a ton of sense. <br><br>The future is ruled by Charismatic Pervert II. Glasses boy grew up in a world where everyone is a pervert. So reading porn mags is a perfectly normally thing to do.</br></br></br></br>  On full covers of each volume there is always small picture of cover girl and speech bubble saying "I am...": vampire, time traveler, etc. <br>What does Mikan have there? (vol. 5)</br>  <br>Don't quote me on this, but I think it's something to do with the god of fortune.</br>    <br>I hope we finally get chapter about Oka, revealing that he liked Mikan for long time since if she calls herself Asahi's osanajimmie then definitely knows Oka for similarly long time and it's foreshadowed since second chapter</br>  <br>So the cover it's about Fuku-chan more than about Mikan.</br>  So Youko's mom has the same haircolour as Evil!Youko in that coverpage?  <br>Unless those two are one and the same.</br>  Man. The comedic timings in this series are so spot on. It really blows most comedy manga/anime out of the water, a lot of which rely on lelrandum bullshit. The unique artstyle also makes the overdramatic expressions that much funnier. Really hope it translates over to the anime well.  <br><br><br> Mikan doesn't even get the focus of her own cover <br><br>As expected of worst girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikan is just the person that carries Fuku-chan. That's her job.</br>  <br>Alium is the most popular character, so she'll probably get a lot of focus.<br><br>I see Dumon and Slutwolf getting a good share as well though.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the host.</br>  <br>I wish Fuku-chan was a girl.</br>  <br>How do we know he isn't a girl?</br>  <br>In an untranslated chapter   we see him at a love hotel with some feminine glasses </br>  <br>He fucks other glasses.</br>  <br>This fuckin manga, I swear.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What if   They're both girls </br></br></br></br>  <br>Just another day in Jitsu wa</br>  <br>There's a lot that can be done fetish wise with the suit and her real body.<br><br>Slutwolf is basically asking for some kind of sex change doujins for obvious reasons.</br></br></br>  <br> There's a lot that can be done fetish wise with the suit and her real body. <br><br>My god, the potential!</br></br></br>  <br> only just now realizing that a tiny humanoid with a normal human-sized mechsuit has enormous fetish potential <br>That aside, the Jitsu Was are not for sexual.</br></br>  <br> the Jitsu Was are not for sexual. </br>  <br>But they're not beautiful and pure. They're all messy, flawed individuals trying to reconcile their true selves with the facades they've been projecting for years.</br>  <br>That is beautiful though.</br>  So I've been trying to get into this and have gotten through the first 20 or so chapters. <br><br>Goddess Tier<br>  Nymphomaniac Lycanthrope <br>  Draculaura <br><br>Okay Tier<br> ayy lmao <br><br>Shit Tier<br> Horny Grandma <br> J. Jonah Jameson <br><br>Am I right in my reasoning?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br> having a shit tier <br> Though I guess Mikan would fit there at the point you're at in the story. </br></br></br>  <br>She gets better, I assume? At this point, she's basically being a cunt so she doesn't get into relationship drama. <br><br>Which, considering this is sort of a harem, does make some sense. <br><br>Also, those "I'm 100000 years old but I look like a little girl" characters are rarely ever good.</br></br></br></br></br>  Warning. This post contains demons, vampires and single hags doing sexy lewd poses. View at your own risk.  <br>Dumon is great, though. She ends up producing the greatest Magical Girl show of all time.</br>  <br>Pretty far off.<br>Alium and Dumpire belong in Goddess tier. Slutwolf probably belongs in okay, along with Densei.<br><br>You're right about Orange though.<br><br><br>Dumon is actually pretty great. She's not a little girl for sexual reasons, in fact the series makes a point of how unsexual she is. She looks like a brat because she is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But she's the one who gave Densei her singleness. </br>  <br>Do you think she ever forgets?</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/EbVco <br>Cute</br></br>  <br>Until it isn't.</br>  <br>No, Densei did that to herself. Between the 100 visits and her totally unrealistic expectations, Akari really is an extraordinary case of romantic ineptitude.</br>  Cool MC's.  That haircut is not cool    obligatory kiritsugu  <br>Gintama</br>      <br>Every time, I still don't know where this came from but I love it<br><br>Pic related for a cool MC, this season sucked ass though</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the image I wanted, I chose this one <br>Clearly Onii-Sama summoned himself with the power of double dubs</br></br>    <br>she's not mc</br>  <br>Issei is not cool. He's a dumb kid.<br><br>Pic related is cool as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>she was the mc of muh dick</br>    <br><br>Kanji is better</br></br>      Rurushu is pretty cool. <br>The only saving point of the average series he stars in.</br>  <br> yeah just give me that school shooter cut </br>  Check your favorite manga site.   Looks like tota might not be a cuckold afterall...   <br>He's the original crush. Dere Eva is a miracle of the gods.</br>  Give me a minute and I'll dump the chapter  It begins  CR was late this week. Anyway, it's in the folder now.        <br>Cheers, man.</br>    <br>Man watching immortals train is funny.</br>        <br>P-picked up --<br>I-I still have forgiven you for Negima!</br></br>      For a chapter that did a lot of nothing plot-wise. It did a shit ton feels-wise. <br><br>I think I might be having a hnnnng moment just from that last 1/3rd of the chapter.</br></br>            <br>I- I just want her to be happy ;_;</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!CAlXEY7L!cooK<wbr>ERhviytsGX16p2iVMg<br><br>Thanks Mega guy.<br><br>Eva ;_;</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Stop making me like this ship Akamatsu, I was all set on Negi and Eva being together don't you pull this shit on me  So when will we get back to the future? I was not ready for these feels ;_;.  <br>I still have my hopes set on at least a little bit of Touta x Kuromaru development. But I can accept this on occasion.</br>  <br>Negi doesn't see Eva that way. Nagi only ever held affection for Nagi because he reminded her of Touta. Come to think of it Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Touta.</br>  <br> Eva <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br> I was all set on Negi and Eva <br>youre a fucking idiot</br></br>  <br>I'm not thinking straight, allow me to fix that entire post.<br><br><br>Negi doesn't see Eva that way. Nagi only ever held affection for Eva because he reminded her of Touta. Come to think of it Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Negi.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagi held affection for Nagi </br>  Eva...<br><br>Is the second time a headpat to a vampire has make feel</br></br>  <br>When was the first time?</br>  <br> Nagi only ever held affection for Nagi <br>That kinda makes sense in some really retarded way.</br></br>  <br>I'm betting Shinobu</br>  Well at least Akamatsu realize Eva is the only selling point of this manga at the moment.  <br> Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Touta. <br><br>Nagi only ever held affection for Eva because he reminded her of Touta. <br>Go to bed</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagi only ever held affection for Nagi <br> Come to think of it Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Touta. <br><br>Anon, you are drunk. Stop posting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>No please I want to see a three for three</br>  <br>Your new fix confuses me.<br><br>Selfcest nagi OTP?</br></br></br>    <br>FINAL TRY, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.<br><br><br>Negi doesn't see Eva that way. Eva only held affection for Nagi because he reminded her of Touta. Come to think of it Touta resembles Nagi more than he does Negi. He's not a booksmart neat freak like Negi was.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he knew that since the first chapter.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>My man, Ken's delivery train hasn't stopped since Kitty/Eva showed up in this new arc and I like it. This is what UHQ should had been about from the start. It's always better when Eva is involved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm proud of you anon</br>  <br>Man, the number of drunks in this thread is increasing,</br>  <br>Congratulations anon, you got it right.</br>  <br>You don't read UQH while drunk?</br>  <br>We can't really know how Negi felt about it for certain, he liked "someone" and all we have are some hints about who it wasn't more than who it was. You're probably right about Nagi, it felt shallow and this development fits in with it nicely but that doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not her mind could have changed in the future once/if she got over him</br>  <br><br><br><br>Yes. YES. As an Evafag, this pleases my heartpenis. I don't care if it is Negi or Touta, both are alright so I'm fine with whoever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is the only way to enjoy any Ken Akamatsu work</br>  <br>Eva has never gotten over Touta, she is the one who gave her a reason to live and she has always cherished their memories together. Even when she was saying her final goodbyes she couldn't let go. To me it looked like she was stocking up on enough Touta love to last her an eternity.</br>  <br>Actually Love Hina is best enjoyed stoned, Negima and UQH are better drunk.</br>  <br>This is a complete assumption on your part, she certainly got over him enough that she fell for Nagi and enough that she doesn't recognize that the boy she's taking care of is literally him</br>  i really like<br>loli eva</br>  <br>he is the one who<br>you know what fuck this. Night you faggots. Have fun shipping without me here to rub it in the faces of Springfags that they were just shoddy replacements of Touta to Eva.</br></br>  <br>yep</br>  <br> tfw Naru is my favorite <br> I'll always get called out on my shit taste <br><br>No regrets though, she was pretty much my waifu in the early 2000s and Horie Yui is GOAT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably recognized him when she rescued him, but she wasn't sure if he meet her pre or post amnesia.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, Naru was one of my favorites too.</br>  I wonder how old past Eva actually is at this point.  One starts to appreciate Yukihime more once we learn that Eva is just copying her mom's haircut  <br>That's only worse for your case if she does recognize him, because that would mean she was over him enough that she could just play a mother to him and not worry about any special feelings for him</br>  <br>28 probably, a lovely Christmas cupcake</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she wandered for several years across the countryside before ending up at Dana's according to her recollections.</br>   The dolls come out <br>I have a bad feeling this is the closest we'll get to an appearance from Chachamaru for another 100 chapters</br>  <br>Little less than 40, she was 17 when she first met Touta and since then 18 years have passed so she's 35 now. She would have to wait more than she has presently lived to have a sliver of hope of seeing Touta again and it's not even certain that he will be capable of attending when that time comes.</br>  <br>Mentally and physically she is still 14. which are the only things that count.</br>  <br>She was turned into a vampire when she was 10</br>  <br>She is physically 9 or 10. Mentally, she'd be around 30-40 ish now.</br>  <br>Nagi is timeloop shenanigans Touta</br>  <br> Touta dyes his hair and NTRs Eva with Arika <br>I'd laugh, but I doubt it</br></br>  <br>Nagi doesn't have Touta's skillset. He has neither the light of Ostia, nor the darkness of demons.</br>    <br><br>yeah, my mistake. <br><br>Anyway, she says she's 16 here, and this is the page she got petted. So that would make her 34 in the newest chapter.<br><br> Mentally, she'd be around 30-40 ish now. <br>Experience in life does not equal mental age.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what everyone means when they say mental age, especially when you're talking about immortals.</br>  <br> So when will we get back to the future? I was not ready for these feels ;_;. <br>Man. She nursed a crush on him for at least 10 years. And in the series' present day, he got Dana-rifted right in front of her. Her being off balance in that entire scene could have been a mix of memories and hope.<br><br>When he gets out of training, she's going to be right there, he's going to be all "sorry for making you wait".</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what it means in regular situations. When a person has downs that is not what it means, when a person suffered brain damage that is not what it mean, and when a person is immortal and because of that never goes through puberty, thus doesn't have his brain structure and hormonal balance change, it certainly shouldn't be what it means.</br>  <br>No, dont make me hope please ;_;</br>  So what happens that makes her go evil enough Nagi confines her to the school?  <br> Making this more complicated than it needs to be <br>Mental age is how long your mind has aged, physical age is how long your body has aged. Bam, done. If you're 14 and had a coma for one year you're physically 14 mentally 13, if you're a loli vampire who's lived 700 years you're mentally 700 and physically 12, bam done. You know this is why immortals always talk about how old they really are and what it's supposed to convey so pulling "muh puberty, muh fully developed brain cortexes" when KA probably hasn't even thought of that in the first place is stupid.</br></br>  <br>Misunderstandings.
