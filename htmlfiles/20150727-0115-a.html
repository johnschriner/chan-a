She speaks like a retard.  <br>She's the only hetero in the show, what do you expect?</br>  <br><br>It's her addiction to tacos, it has caused her to suffer mental failure.</br></br>  Zenno?  To every Toki, there is a season.    Shitrue status: #rekt  ｷﾀ━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━!!    <br>RINKAI CONFIRMED GOING TO THE BEACH<br><br>Eat shit, Nellyfags</br></br></br>  <br>saki is pretty much responsible for ruining the beach for me<br><br>glittering waters and the sun shouldn't be depressing, but ritz exists and now they're purgatory</br></br></br>    <br><br>So that's where she is going to send her sister!</br></br>    I think these are new pages from volume 14.        It's highly possible that she's one of the finalists for Hokkaido's individuals.  <br>Or not. Either way, she's pretty cute.</br>  We're getting quite a few Usuzan extras. I guess those breaks were warranted after all.  Usuzan confirmed for finals.  <br>If anything, their trip to the beach is pretty much confirmed.</br>  <br>sample sample sample - no Kyouka</br>  <br>no Kyouka here either</br>  <br>Biyori - no Kyouka here either</br>  <br>last one... and oh god, Maya.</br>    <br>Is this even possible? Are you sure she isn't even bi?</br>  I was thinking it'd be pretty easy to classify all the Sakis like pokemon.<br>I think there'd be a lot of Psychic types though</br>  <br>Aislinn, it's time to grow up.</br>  <br>Aislinn would be a Flying type</br>  Anyone here wants to play riichi on Tenhou?  <br>Sorry, I only play American Mahjong on Tenhou.</br>  <br><br>But wait, isn't it a flightless bird?</br></br>  I recently started with Dawn of Age. Is Ritz trying to put up a real story? Because this Lost-mother-thingy feels somehow stale  <br>What it lacks in flight it makes up for in falling.<br>Also, fun fact, New Zealand didn't have any mammals at all until European settlers introduced them.</br></br>  <br><br>I thought the Maori predated Europeans finding New Zealand.</br></br>  <br><br>You weren't supposed to put tanoshii in the OP. This thread is going to Toki before 300 now.<br><br>Proof is in the Captcha: 296</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What is that? Sakibowl?</br></br>  <br><br>You're going about that the wrong way.<br>It's not purgatory, it's the rallying area for boobs too bi/hetero to make it to finals.<br><br>What all males dream of, in other words.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maya is purple-haired? Dyejob?</br></br>  <br>Dyejobu</br>  <br> No anime <br>Disappointment<br><br><br> Harue lose <br>Double disappointment.<br><br><br> No Kyouka <br>Triple disappointment<br><br>I'll never Tanoshii thread hyping shit up again. You guys deserve to toki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>come anon, let us go to the graveyard of hopes and dreams<br><br>see you at the beach  with rinkai </br></br></br>  <br><br>Beach will soon achieve critical boob mass. Boobalypse in august confirmed?</br></br>  <br><br>Boobs, they keep your Toki alive.</br></br>  If Saki wants to win, what does she have to do to defeat the Magical Girl who is her deadliest enemy?  <br><br>The sealed thing. You know, the one that caused Teru to leave in the first place. When she sees it again, she'll snap and kill Awai, and almost manages to kill harvest toki until Sumire stops her.</br></br>  <br>How tragic.</br>  <br><br>Don't do it Teru, except in bed!</br></br>  <br><br>It's the flipside of the light and tanoshii.</br></br>  Maybe Saki and Teru have a bad relationship because they liked different book genres.  <br><br>Saki likes dark themes (RotR) and Teru likes ecchi stuff. Yeah, I can see it.</br></br>  I really like this new role of Saki-san.  Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released.<br>Please look forward to it</br>  <br><br>Confirmed.</br></br>  If you could write Rord of the Rings, what would it be about?  <br>I think that Saki is connected to Shino, at least as a fan, maybe as family.<br>I hope that Shino won the Zenkoku and found her mom, and then gave up on mahjong in a way like how Frodo got rid of the ring.<br>So Lord of the Rings is about Shino.</br></br></br>  Continuing from the last thread:<br>Posting Saki, Chapter 4</br>  <br>non sequitur taco page</br>  <br>Reporter Nishida wants to interview Nodoka.</br>  <br>Stop this shit. It's not like you're doing some "deep analysis" or anything. You're literally just describing what's on the page.<br>Just let the thread die peacefully.</br></br>  <br>Nishida's assistant steals the page with a comment.</br>    <br>I kinda like it, actually. I'm not really feeling like going back and rereading everything, but tittering about the early stuff after seeing it isn't the worst thing.<br><br><br>there were only two weeks between "we have 5 memers" and the tournament starting? What a lax entry.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Saki is the person Nodoka fears the most.</br>  <br>Teru speaks.</br>  <br>Saki's rinshan kaihou connects her with her sister.</br>  <br>But her sister is far away.</br>  <br>Saki is having tanoshii as a new member of the mahjong club.</br>  <br>Nodoka does not like losing to Saki, or beating Saki when she's not trying.</br>  <br>Yuuki appears.</br>  <br>Tacos explained.</br>  <br>Nodoka sulking by herself.</br>  <br>Nodoka is playing solitaire mahjong to duplicate Saki's break even scores.</br>  <br>Game on.</br>  <br>Nodoka is serious.</br>  <br>Nodoka rons Yuuki.</br>  <br>Nodoka is on a roll.</br>  <br>But Saki's making another comeback.</br>  <br>Teru's words motivate Saki.</br>  <br>the winning hand</br>  <br>it's a big one</br>  <br>Saki wins, but Yuuki is upset she lost.</br>  <br>Second match. Yuuki is winning, but Saki is hesitant.</br>  <br>Saki deals into Yuuki's hand.<br>Nodoka is suspicious.</br></br>  <br>Kyoutaro confirms the suspicion.<br>Saki was hiding a kokushi, and she could have won.</br></br>  <br>Saki threw the match and broke even again.<br>Nodoka is angry.</br></br>  <br>Hisa hears the story.</br>  <br>Saki chases after Nodoka.</br>  <br>Nodoka is furious.</br>  <br><br>I'm fine with it as well, it's a decent distraction.</br></br>  <br>What an awkward pose.</br>  <br>Nodoka asks Saki to quit the club.<br>End Chapter 4.<br>Taking a break.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I would be fine if it was just a dump. The comments are just embarrassing to read. The sky is blue, etc.<br><br>The lewd posting are the only few decent parts of tanoshii threads, and this is just wasting images.</br></br></br></br>  July 25 is Aislinn's birthday.  <br>Your posts are embarrassing to read. Nerd.</br>  <br><br>No lewds please, she's mai waifu.</br></br>  <br><br>As if there's any lewds of her to begin with.</br></br>  <br><br>there's a lot of sick people on the internet.<br><br>Look at this lewd picture of Awai and a monkey.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>One minute photoshop copypasta. 1/10 because of Awai is in it.</br></br>  <br><br>Would you prefer something with Saki?</br></br>  Ron those who sexualize Sakis!  <br><br>I like to ron with a Yakuman, but then pretend the baby isn't mine.</br></br>  Dead thread<br><br>Dead love<br><br>Dead fanbase<br><br>Dead game<br><br>Dead Toki</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Toki isn't dead!</br></br>  Posting a 6 page list of character bios found on Baidu.

Whether to leave for friends that he's lost or stay and protect his only remaining family.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want to read about guts' extravagant voyages</br>  It's a surreal feeling seeing previews for the next chapter so soon. It's going to take a while for the fact that it's monthly to sink in for me.  <br>Fuck is he just going to skip the whole thing of elf island and do a time skip? I know that sounds far fetched but taking this much time away from the main character when we finally were about to some closure.

It was already released by Evil Genius.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rakshas.</br>  <br>Well what do you know, this anon's right. Just go to EG</br>  <br>Holy shit, i was screaming at the top of my lungs when i saw this shit.<br>How long has it been, 8-10 month or something?</br></br>  <br> Berserk CCCXXXVIII <br><br>Oh EG you so silly</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/334914/berser<wbr>k_v38_ch338_by_evil-genius</wbr></br></br>  <br><br> Only Guts is looking at Rickert <br> 18 year old Guts <br><br>The old days ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  Alright anon's, while we still have a chance. Tell me how you picture the focal shift back to the boat to go.<br><br>I'm thinking it will be a falconia chapter focusing on rickert's new trouble and getting ready to leave for the wild unknown with silat. His thoughts wind up turning to guts and casca and the final page is a massive spread of pic related overlayed with rickert's thoughts on where they might have ended up since he last saw them.</br></br>  <br>Nice. Some lines are rather off, though.</br>  <br>compared to what? the translation of a translation stitched together by random anons?<br><br>personally i trust this one more.</br></br></br>  <br>SK.net translation.</br>  Shit Falconia looks like a paradise. If griffith wants to sacrifice it all nobody with a right mind can say that Griffith did nothing wrong  So is this all going to amount to Dressrosa Berserk version? Rip down the false paradise to show the seedy underbelly (with 900% more death and rape)? Coming in 2043.  <br>I think Rakshas is working alone. <br><br>Rickert isn't a threat to Griffith and I doubt he would order to kill him. <br>Locus couldn't really order Rakshas to do something because they are equal. Maybe he nicely asked him or something.</br></br></br></br>   I have been rejected  <br> Time to rape somebody </br>  <br> seedy underbelly <br>Nothing indicates that.</br></br>  <br>All the apostles barely placated by fighting each other, who will all go on a rampage at the slightest means?</br>  <br>hue</br>    <br>Besides the monster that old monster dude keeps, besides they are gathering all the humans for a great sacrafice, propably to bring the rest of the god hand to this plane.</br>  <br> they are gathering all the humans for a great sacrafice </br>  <br>Yes it seems falconia is truly paradise. Our heroes are turning into villains and our villains are turning into heroes. Guts is fucked.</br>  <br>Common, it's the only reason the apostles are doing this</br>  <br>What is Gaiseric's united Empire?</br>  I like how arab dude saved the day.<br>Man... I remember when he first showed up... 13 years ago or something.</br>  <br> barely placated by fighting each other <br> barely placated <br>Why barely? Stop making things up. <br> will all go on a rampage at the slightest means <br>Source? <br><br><br>Why would they want to sacrifice the humans of Falconia? <br> propably to bring the rest of the god hand to this plane <br>Why would Griffith want to do that? And I'm sure they are already there. They don't need physical bodies anymore like Griffith.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was 7 at the time.</br>  <br>Yeah it's not really an underbelly when it's in plain sight</br>  <br>We don't know anything about his empire and why was it destroyed.</br>  <br>The rape that will follow will be glorious</br>  <br>Because it was part of there plan Griffith could still be a pawn in all this</br>  <br>I don't know. <br>Silat seems pretty keen toward knowing griffith secret. <br>Maybe if Silat learns griffith secret, something would change.I bet if some one would introduce griffith as an demon or some sort, I would generally cause panic within the city, afterall, the city is pretty new.</br></br></br>  <br>They are doing this because of their own free will to serve Griffith/Femto.</br>  <br> Why would they want to sacrifice the humans of Falconia? <br><br>World domination, Griffith always sacrifices what he haves so he can grasp more and more. <br><br>You are an idiot if you think he will sit in Falconia with a thumb up his ass when there is a whole world to conquer. You think those giant steelworks churning out cannons are for show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looking back on this scene, the only reason Locus brought Rickert down there was to threaten him not to start shit with Griffith during his meeting right?<br><br>He arranged it once he realised Rickert was an original hawk and likely had some idea of what Griffith had done. Even questions him on in on the way.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be a terrible twist. And for all we know they are equal.</br>  <br>Really? I don't think they would put up with dealing with humans much longer. Their food, probably creating a farm of humans to feast on.</br>  <br>Kentaro Miura just wanted a random irrelevant character to receive attention.</br>  It would be nice if this series could actually finish. I'd even be fine if he just cut down on his art quality by like 50% just so he can consistently put it out without having to give up on his idols.  <br> his dream is a castle <br> he achieved it and now his city is literally a paradise <br> he will sacrifice it for... world domination? except there is no other castle as perfect as this one in the whole world  <br>Makes sense.</br></br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions buyfag.moe  bump because principles and /a/ being full on gay    I'm actually glad most of the announcements have been boring.<br>Closed wallet season won't hurt.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Holy shit have I been broke past couple of weeks.</br></br></br>  The thing that got me hyped was the sakamoto figma. <br><br> I don't even like jointshit too </br></br>  Another bump because fuck fatties.  ded thred<br>ded wonfes</br>  <br>I dunno I'm pretty hype on account of GSC</br>  I don't understand why people post in Pochaco threads. It's like they see the "Buyfag thread" and the link to the guide and think "Oh, this must be the buyfag thread', and completely ignore the fact that it's a fucking Pochaco thread. Does /a/ even have any mods, how do those threads not get banned instantly?  Did they show off Celty's figma?  <br> Believe in Vomit Dog </br>  <br>Nope. Just the announcement picture.</br>  Mako nendoroid up on the GSC online shop.

I might buy my first figma.<br> fuck </br></br>      I'm not that into figurines and stuff but I saw this one... so beautiful.  <br>That's all kinda self explanatory then.</br>  <br> worst saenai <br> beautiful <br>Anon I got news for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Did mfc compile a list yet</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>At least it does not have a shitty face like the one you posted.</br>  Feria 【フェリア】 from Comet Lucifer 『コメット・ルシファー』.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/P57C-Io44dA  [ ]</br></br>  I'm glad I waited.  <br><br/></br>  Say something GSC  <br>the PV isn't telling me anything, but it sure looks pretty</br>  <br>Right, because having 1 figma and around 50 ordinary anime figures makes me a /tv/isionist.</br>  <br>She keeps getting stuff of her in alternative outfits, its really annoying. Is it just too much to ask for a scale in her regular clothes?</br>  <br>the part of your brain responsible for figmas goes there. the rest can stay .</br>  <br>I get the art style and all but this shit just looks lazy as fuck.</br>  <br>I'd rather get a lobotomy to remove that part.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>331765</wbr>  <br>I'm reserving judgement until I see the final product. If he looks like that when he's up for order I can't see him being over 3k, which would be something.</br>  <br>as you wish, onii-chan.</br>  I didn't have a lot of faith in this but it looks pretty good.  he better come with 4 arms and legs  <br>Everything else is good but the tiddy just looks so bad.</br>  <br><br>Myhipsaremovingontheirown</br></br>  <br>They look like two beach balls stapled to her chest.</br>  <br>R;N is dead and buried.</br>  <br> voiced by hashi <br>Will watch.</br></br>  Should have known GSC is gonna milk it dry  Time to take a nap before Wonfest 2nd broadcast happens.

So, pretty soon, maybe.</br>  <br>I'm fine with that instead of continuing it by beating a dead horse like S;G 0.</br>  <br>Their paintjobs are pretty flawed. I don't own any of their figures yet, but this WonFes made them my heroes. Three must-buys.</br>  <br> Nozomi's tail <br>errytime lmao</br></br>  <br>I see. Well, that's fine, no price whatsoever will keep me from my waifu,  not even fabric clothing. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287872<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287880</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I think you may be confused with figma R Ichirou.</br>  I see no one posted OSs Tsukiumi.  <br>No, he's not.</br>  <br>Looks shit.</br>  <br>Oh my, I missed him. This is nice too. But it's not a figma. It's by UC, so is it even an action figure?</br>  <br>That fedora.</br>  <br>He won't look like that once he's out. They have a bad record with realistic faces. But at least he comes with a helmet.</br>  <br>Vulcanlog is Union Creative's poseable line apparently.</br>  <br>I imagine that most people who buy him are just going to use the body for headswaps.</br>   summer wonfes 2015 <br>If you don't love boatshit, swordshit or idolshit, you're fucked.</br>  Next DickFes, right?  <br>This, at least we don't have shit taste brah</br>  <br><br>Cry more.

I remember seeing an image for half of the Vulcanlog stuff, was wondering what that was.

Also getting , already preordered.<br><br>Jesus fuck, I'm afraid of the moment all those announcements hit preorders, it will be bad for my mental health.

This is hell.</br></br></br>  Anyone got a good picture of the wall?  <br> you're fucked <br>At least my wallet is safe from Japan's horrid taste.</br></br>  <br>Well, Union Creative owns Revoltech and Kaiyodo, so they've got experience with poseables. I think Vulcanlog was originally made for Monster Hunter poseables, but they saw the profit figma was bringing in and widened their options.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I can't blame them, I don't barely watch anime anymore. The only figure I cared for this entire wonfes is a damn nendoroid.</br>  <br> no new chitoge <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to twitter and tumblr</br>  <br>I know, right, not a single Giganigga announced. Fucking anime killed all chances of getting more.</br>  <br>There were some figures that got me mildly interested. but nothing exciting.</br>  <br>It';s the anime that made them release it in the first place.</br>  <br>Not like you need, she has dozens. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/searc<wbr>h.php?character_strict=1&amp;character_<wbr>id=42743</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, cry more.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, man, we could be getting more of those top-notch sins, pochaco and sonico figures, amirite?</br>  What are you going to spend your money on instead of figures since there was nothing good at Wonfes?  <br>Wow, then they're banking. I had thought Kaiyodo was the owner of Revoltech and owned themselves.</br>   not a single Shit la Shit figure <br>Damn, it sure feels good being right.</br>  <br>Books and their buttrape ship rates just like every year.</br>  <br> You had ONE JOB, GSC. <br>Yeah, their job is not to make nendos out of shity characters</br></br>  <br>Well, Kaiyodo technically owns Revoltech, but Union Creative owns Kaiyodo and is putting them to work on their new Vulcanlog line.</br>  How are you guys keeping up on Wonfes news? I was out for the last two days and wanna catch up on what's new.  <br>Guess I'm finally going to save up for a scalped Mark Sein</br>  <br> liking Shitoge <br>She has enough figures already faggot. If there were to be any more nisekoi shit i'd want Marika but the whole series would be better off just dying at this point.</br></br>  <br>Browse through all the threads. Check MFC for your favorite tags. Done.</br>  <br>Companies really fucked up with the anime related content, mainly because of idolshit.

Even fans didn't expect any new figures this wonfes.</br>  <br> mainly because of idolshit <br>Was there really that much? There was way more boatshit  and I'm immensely sad I can't really afford them all. </br></br>  Is this a joke?<br><br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287732</wbr></br></br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/<wbr>22995<br>Lurk more next time friend</br></wbr></br>  <br>It wasn't that different from past wonfeses, lots of announcements, maybe a few things that I will actually order. I was hoping to see Purple Heart's prototype the most this wonfes but a Sento scale by Alter is more than enough for me.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/BadDragonNews/s<wbr>tatus/623669293847162880</wbr></br>  The love is alive and well.  I'm on the Shinkansen. <br><br>So, my report on this WonFes.<br><br>- Boatsluts everywhere<br>- That new tanned submarine loli got the spotlight<br>- Literally no Touhous. I have a sad<br>- More monster stands compared to last winter<br>- More generic figures selling stands compared to last winter<br>- Griffon only had a stand about Jurassic Park (?)<br>- Not many figures that were also being shown last winter<br>- Practically no Gakkou Gurashi besides 1 unpainted figure<br>- There was a Gakkou Gurashi show at 1:30 pm but I missed it ;_;<br>- Lots of Fate as usual</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh damn, I've actually been thinking about buying them</br>  <br><br>thx</br></br>  <br> hating chitoge <br><br>DUDE</br></br></br>  <br>They should at least give us rainbowslut</br>  <br><br>  - Literally no Touhous. I have a sad <br><br>I thought they got nendos?</br></br></br></br>  Somewhat relevant, but<br>Should I sculpt my own figure digitally then print it<br>Or get whatever material they use to sculpt and do it traditionally<br><br>What material is it even</br></br></br></br>  <br>He musn't have seen them.</br>  Did griffon not announce anything? I thought they had a booth there?  <br>I looked through the list on MFC and idols took up the entirety of two companies announcements. I didn't even notice many boats or Saber. I've been going through everything on my phone, though, so I could have easily spaced them out.</br>  <br><br>Spotted a couple of nendos. Still too few</br></br>  <br> thx <br>Motherfuck.</br></br>  <br>Actually the only must-buy for me is none of those, so I'm pretty content.</br>  Weak wonfes for me, but my wallet can rets easy for a whi-<br><br> 20K~ish Erza <br>FUCK</br></br></br>   waiting for Saitama figure <br> the first ones are both jointshit <br> anime will probably be shit so minimum figures will be made <br>Life is injustice.

No San?</br>  <br>The new Erza from X-Plus is great news, but what the fuck GSC, are you ever going to tell us what happened to your planned Erza?</br>  Quick preview. A pic of a pic   letting kotobukiya have hotarumaru <br>why did you let them do this GSC</br>  <br>Who are those in the back row?</br>  Base bodies for FAGs?  <br>I love idols but I didn't see anything worth getting at all.</br>  MAI WAIFU  So they did two Nicos in the same pose.  <br><br>That's a present I want to unwrap.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I'll finally buy Kino</br>   Pirate Sento <br> Ludger <br> That cute as fuck Kirby <br><br>Even though a lot of this was boats and Love Live, I'm pretty okay with the other stuff they showed. That Ramlethal was also cool as fuck, but she's a GG character I don't care too much about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like violent tsunderes nor do I like the tsundere trope in general. I suppose her design is fine, but her personality is incredibly appalling.</br>  <br>Is this what they call neo-/a/?</br>  <br>Is not even in the wall, I assume they cancelled her.<br>For some dumb reason since Lucy pretty much sold out right away when she released<br><br>Natsu and Gray shelfwarmed for a while (not even that long) but was expected</br></br></br></br>  <br>This girl is what tempts me to watch Love Live</br>  What is the point of Figfix?  <br>She is the only good thing about Love Live.</br>   No news <br>WELP</br>  <br>Nah man, look at the feet. Different. Same with the placement of the hands.</br>  <br>Scales for the financially challenged.</br>  <br>Not their most recent ones. It really didn't take long for the prices to inflate.</br>  <br> I assume they cancelled her <br>Yeah, this is what I was fearing. Oh well, they should at least had said something.</br></br>  <br>Do you think Alter's Nico might come with another hand?

Not the best GK but dat base.  Who oppai master race here  Worst Wonfes ever. Glad I didn't stay up for this shit.  <br>ok</br>  <br>No one cares.</br>  <br>Y-you anon.</br>  <br><br>Can't do much from the phone. Here it is the Ramlethal</br></br>  <br>Yeah. The only reason I really want to get it is because she's stepping on the best character in the show.</br>    <br> Dark-skinned swordgirl <br>I completely forgive you anon. Have a blessed night.</br></br>   11 boat scales <br> 10 sword scales <br> no touhou scales <br>It's dead.</br></br></br>    <br>Reporting!</br>  <br>I care.</br>  <br> there are actually people who want more touhou, miku and saber <br>Kill yourself. You are what's wrong with the figures industry.</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Shit.</br>  <br> 2hu in 2015  <br>Fucking seniors.</br></br>   All this swordshit <br>It's over. Buyfagging is dead.</br>  <br>Wait, is swordshit just fate stuff? Is that what it means?</br>  <br>Does the a58 have NFC so you could use the play memories app?</br>  <br>So what if I buy it. How do you explain it to your 10/10 hot gf?</br>  <br><br>Ah yes, the infamous Cum Gun™.</br></br>  <br>Swordshit is Touken Ranbu. Basically hot male swords for girls</br>  <br>It means gay figures for fujos and homos. Hence "swords."</br>  <br>It's kancolle for landwhales.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need a side view</br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wow, this looks remarkably terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too. Hopefully she will have some cute panties like Kotori.</br>  <br>We got more than 10 fujoshit scales.</br>  <br>This is the master race.</br>  <br>What does each male represent? A literal sword?</br>  <br>Yes, real Japanese swords.</br>  <br> Raita rori <br> Yukari Tamura ears <br> ugly fingers <br> bulimia body <br> skidmark eyebrows <br> flightdeck forehead <br><br>2/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>somebody is into lolis</br>  <br> preordering new donut Shinobu <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>Huh. Like which?</br>  <br>I don't think anybody expected anything from KLK.</br>  <br>I occasionally buy cowtits too. They just have to look REALLY good.</br>  Oh shit, there was a Sharo figure after all!<br><br>All is not lost.</br></br>  <br>http://touken-ranbu.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Characters</wbr></br>  <br>Why not? Kotobukiya did a good job with their first Shinobu.</br>    <br>Because it looks like shit? You can't even see her panties.</br>  <br><br>Not sure why is says 1/8 here and 1/7 in the announcement.</br></br>  <br>They could've at least put them in interesting poses or used the ones who actually look like males but nope. Why are fujos into feminine boys I'll never understand.</br>  <br><br>.<br> Still no Cocoa <br>2 nukes etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you expect anything else from raita?</br>  <br>Feminine boys are good but those poses were really boring. Also no best sword, fuck this shit.</br>  <br>Be careful, that is a lot of shit taste anon.</br>  <br>That little triangle of dress in between her legs will probably be removable, like it was with their Sena.</br>  How many years till painted?  <br> this <br> good </br></br>      <br>Which figure do you think is shit taste?</br>  <br><br>That seems to be a problem with a lot of male figures, really. They're all just standing there. I want more male figures but there are so few interesting ones.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Kashuu a shit. They chose all the worst swords. <br><br><br>I've noticed the same thing. It can't be that hard to make interesting and cool poses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow I didn't even notice it's Ritsu. Thought it's a random GK of a character I'm not familiar with.</br>  <br><br>This, plus bunny Erica.</br></br>  Finally woke up. Please tell me there were news on Tougou, or even Yuuna  <br>Forget Cocoa, where's Chiya?</br>  <br>All they need to do is give us their Shinken Hissatsu forms. Same hot boys but more dynamic and naked. Everyone's happy.</br>  <br>haha, nope.</br>  <br>MY LIFE FOR HER<br><br>Also besides her definitely the Medicine Seller from Mononoke and the German Boats.<br>I'll wait for the coloured version of Bismarck though first as I'm not completely sure how she'll turn out.<br>Prinz Eugen though is definitely a Buy.<br>Poi Poi~ from GSC too if it's good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there was no worthwhile iM@S news, unless you mean secondary idolshit in which case whatever.</br>   Sentinel <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Sentinel isn't bad, just expensive</br>    <br>Wasn't Sentinel the one with fucked up Levi?</br>  <br>You tell her to deal with it</br>  :&gt;  <br>Where was it Alter? <br>W H E R E</br></br>  <br>In the trash where it belongs.</br>  <br>My bad, it was Pulchra.</br>  <br>insufficient ribs</br>    <br>Oh man, you got me.</br>  <br> those crease lines <br>holy shit</br></br>  This is a nice Miku<br>The detail on the toes and fingers is a little overdone though</br>  <br>Hoping for ponytail and red ribbon accessories</br>  <br>ooga booga me miku</br>  <br> no touhou scales <br>we didn't see anything from griffon.<br><br>also, touhouvania remilia made some progress.<br><br>there is residual hope.<br><br><br>I think the swordfags are reasonably well-crafted bishis. I wouldn't buy one but i can appreciate the craftsmanship.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I love it, I'm tired of figures having weird unrealistic salami for hands and feet, and dangling phimosis penises for toes and hands</br>    Ten million swordboys things announced and not one of my swordbando. Why? Tell me why.<br><br>Is his crotch strap too lewd? Is that it?</br></br>      Where is this new erza I heard about?  <br>Who's that? he's a qt</br>  <br>Because he's shit and one of the newcomers.</br>  Why Lucky Star ?<br><br>Kagami  best   girl</br></br>  <br>Why, the best sword, of course. Nagasone Kotetsu.<br><br><br> Because he's shit  <br>You take that back, swine. He's the sexiest and his personality is fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukasa is objectively best LS. We reached this conclusion years ago.</br>     pre-order goods <br> the day after you order it it's sold out <br>Why does it feel so good?</br></br>  <br>The lumpy torso doesn't look that good.</br>  <br>when you're rubbing your dick on it it will feel good</br>  <br><br>Not as good as managing to get the last order in.</br></br>  <br> alerted something back in stock <br> order minutes later <br> instantly back out of stock  <br><br>This one feels even better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> preorder <br> never closes <br> available at release <br> still there months after release <br> reissue </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this happens <br> aftermarket price still climbs to 2-3x the original price <br><br>Feels good man.</br></br></br></br>  <br> sold out as soon as you preorder <br> seeing people bitching about not getting there in time <br> price shoots up immediately after release <br> no re-release even though it's an extremely coveted figure <br><br>The best feels a buyfag can feel</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> day one PO <br> POs never close <br> ever <br> bargain bins <br> ends up with 70% discount <br> aftermarket is still about 50% of the original price <br>I-I still love you, Meiya  I just wish I hadn't spent so much on you so I could also buy S00mika. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expect fig to bin after release like the others in the series <br> don't preorder because the month it's scheduled to release is very full <br> figure shoots up in price after release, also hard to find <br> everything that month got delayed anyway except that one figure <br><br>Why does it feel so bad?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br/>  Very soon.  <br> mfw this happens and I ordered two </br>  <br> didn't preorder <br> available at release <br> binned <br> bought <br> sold out <br> price rises <br>What happened to me when i bought that Alter Clalaclan and the early GSC Bakemonos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel, anon. I love my Airi but I could have saved $35 on her if I had known she would bargain bin as hard as she did.</br>   become heavily invested in something years after it aired <br> every fig is scalped as fuck </br>  <br>what figure was it, anon?</br>   greentext stories   <br>Tell me about it...</br>  <br> Amiami <br>It's going to be shit anon</br></br>  Still sad at the lack of scary light cruiser considering the amount of other boatshit.<br><br> I might just order Ques Q's at this rate. </br></br>    <br>Alter's Heidemarie.<br><br>It's grating that I got some of the others for as little as 3k but I'm expecting to pay upwards of 15k for her. In hindsight I really should have expected it though.</br></br></br>    <br>Rerelease faggot.</br>  The Ilya figure seems questionable now, not sure if it's the lighting which is making the stomach seem weird.  <br>Is that not already sold out, too?</br>  <br><br>Just order the Ques Q one, it looks good. I've bought her and her sister.</br></br>  <br>does anyone who owns that figure even play the game?</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>I would be one if I had the figure.</br>  Is this another nendoroid more Pz IV?<br><br>It's got the same hatches as the early version so I assume it can still fit the nendo petits or something.</br></br>  Ok nigs, I'm home. 620+ pics.<br><br>Currently transferring them to the PC, then I've to resize them, then the dump begins</br></br>  <br>Even if, then they'll just reissue it -again- and I hope all the aftermarket buyers get mad.</br>  <br>God speed anon</br>  <br>Post the absolute best and make an album for the rest.</br>  <br>you better have a 4chan pass or this will get really tedious for you</br>  <br><br> I indeed have a 4chin gold account </br></br>  <br>Just make an album or something instead of clogging the thread, it'll be easier for you as well</br>  What's the highest markup you've paid for a figure on the after market, friends?  How long does it usually take for BiJ/NY to list an exclusive? I'm assuming that it won't be for another 9 hours at the least seeing as it's 21:00 on a Sunday over there.  <br><br>I enjoy dumping pics. Will make the album tomorrow</br></br>  <br>full speed ahead then.</br>  Every wonfes looks like shit but somehow I always end up spending a lot of money.  <br>Now, if GSC has at least one ounce of intelligence, they could maybe rerelease those GuP Nendoroid Petits. Ah, who am I kidding. <br><br>Or maybe, this time they could paint the tank so it's the same color as the Miho Nendoroid turret stand. But hey, that's assuming GSC knows what they're doing.<br><br>Yes, I'm THAT buttmad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bought momohime for about 18,000 jpy</br>  <br>I bought a second hand GSC Yami for about 12k-15k yen.</br>      <br>Oh you've got no chance of this one being the same colour. The Ausf H was brown.<br><br>But yeah, re-releasing the nendo petits sure wouldn't be a bad thing. At the very least they're at least finishing Anglerfish team as nendos.</br></br></br>  <br>I have the Wii version and the Vita version. Arashimaru and Shirohebi fucking when? That was the best dlc  even better than loli oni and husbando </br>   no Hoshijiro or BeniJiro figures <br> only EnaJiro gets any at all </br>  <br>7th Dragon Hacker for $135</br>  <br>you mean her mecha form? there were figmas I think</br>  <br>Never. I don't buy figs for more than msrp.</br>  <br>Alter Selvaria Valkyria Ver. for 16.5k</br>  Resizing now  <br>No, I want a figure of the original Hoshijiro or Benisuzume's placenta clone of her. But I want the former most of all.</br>  <br>It's one of my favorite games, bought both versions and all the DLC. Momohime was the figure that got me into buyfagging.</br>  <br>I have the Vita version but personally I prefer the HD retexture version for PC.</br>  Ehrm, any advice on how should I resize the pics? Just 50% smaller?  <br>Looks bad. Azusa is the only good one so far.</br>   P4D Rise <br><br>YES</br></br>  <br>I paid $140 for this. It was ¥9,450 when it came out. Though I have the original 2001 release. Pic related is the 2012 re-release.</br>  Day fucking 1<br><br>Is there some Artorias/Souls bro here?</br></br>  <br>That's a gk.</br>  <br>You the same guy from the /toy/ thread? It'd be nice if Devilman had a good, articulated figure. The statue is nice but I wish he had wings</br>  <br> You the same guy from the /toy/ thread? <br>Yup. And I agree. A figma or figuart would be great. Maybe we'll get something when the new movie comes out. And wings would be nice. I love my vinyl though. It's probably my favorite thing in my collection.</br></br>  <br>Souls bro here. You can't buy that. Or any of the other Souls things shown at the event, as usual.</br>  <br>Maybe aim for like 2k vertical or less. I'm not sure what resolution they are right now but 50% might be too much.</br>  <br>That is wonderful.</br>  <br>Er, horizontal.</br>  Commencing dumping  Dem legs  <br>open on paint<br>resize<br>50%<br>save<br>Is it smaller than 1mb? <br>Yes - Upload<br>No - Resize again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> resizing in paint </br>  The next 500 pics or so are from circles.  <br>It's a fantastic vinyl. If he did get a figuarts or figma I'm worried that they would use the design from that 009 vs Devilman movie or whatever it was, the overly long arms are just strange.</br>  This is a really bad picture.   I don't care about statueshit <br> see pic related <br> fucking Di Molto Bene. </br></br>  Goddammit Mashiro.<br><br>I should have taken a pic from above too.</br></br>  <br>If you're an idiot, sure.</br>  <br><br>Damn boatsluts, give me back my touhous!</br></br>    <br><br>I don't even know this mech.</br></br>  <br><br>Carriers having a snack</br></br>  <br><br>Ha, gayyyyyyyy</br></br>  <br><br>Dolljoints</br></br>  <br><br>Temjin from Virtual-On, a Sega arcade game.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, they got an anime after all</br></br>  <br>I love boatshit, but I didn't get anything good out of this one.</br>  <br><br>There were many more "monster" themed circles than last winter.</br></br>  <br><br>Lewd</br></br>  <br><br>More lewd</br></br>  <br><br>"Holy shit I'm fucking fabulous"</br></br>  <br><br>Never seen her before</br></br>  <br><br>Idolshit</br></br>  <br><br>I don't even like Kill la Shit, but goddamn</br></br>   Nadeko dayo!   <br><br>Uicchi akutibiti</br></br>  <br><br>Hang in there, medic is coming!</br></br>  <br>That's a real nice GK</br>  <br>Rin where</br>  <br><br>Is this idolshit? I don't even know</br></br>   some guy on mfc wrote mail to Amakuni to alter the prisma figure for him   <br>I can't tell them apart. They look all the same to me.</br>  <br><br>Please do not desperate</br></br>  <br>It is. It's Kotori from Love Live.</br>  <br> sword that doesn't look like a total fag for once </br>  <br><br><br><br>I feel you man, I've the same problem. Can't enjoy Knights of Sidonia cause I can't tell the characters apart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or alternatively get Irfanview, open the picture and press ctrl + r.</br>  <br>That's pretty well made.<br><br><br> someone actually remembers witchii actibiti <br>It brings a tear to my eye.<br>How was the event experience btw? Would you do it again?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Emonzaemon is a pretty cool guy. Killing waifus and not afraid of anything</br></br>  <br>There are a few of them but they're not popular and fujos prefer the fag looking ones anyway.</br>  <br><br>The dynamic trio<br><br><br><br> How was the event experience btw? Would you do it again? <br><br>Of courshe. I live in Japan and I've to take pics for you guys.<br><br> It was quite tiring </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, seriously? They have a sign that essentially tells people to not cry about it?</br>    <br><br>Even legends have to... Eat?<br><br>Uh, there's "Meal" written on the can. I didn't notice.<br><br><br><br>Yes, please go being desperate somewhere else</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber's face looks terrible</br>  <br><br>Some mechafag asked me to take pics of mechs.<br><br>And I did.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shadows clipped on the left hand side </br>  <br> fujos prefer the fag looking ones anyway <br>And this is why we'll never have good male figures.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I wanted that one too,</br></br>  <br><br>I don't even</br></br>  <br><br>Uh, at least she's not naked.</br></br>  <br><br>Of course you could buy it; that and the bell gargoyle are kits, meaning you have to put them together and paint them.<br><br>I found this little guy though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't even know this loli</br></br>  <br>If you break the statue does it give you shitty gear in your inventory automatically<br><br>Godlike, but not really practical.

I can see 2 and 7, but why do people like slice of life jojo that much?</br></br></br>  <br>No u.</br>  <br>Because they like JoJo and SoL. Part 2 is a lot worse than 4 as well. Reading 7 and 8 has made me hate the villain of the week stuff in the first 6 parts as well.</br>  <br>seven stand of the week but pretty much all of them advanced the plot or built character in some way.

He was the leader of a crusade against humanity from 2000 years ago that an entire army of humans fought to seal away. Literal first thing they do is impale human beings to feast on their blood. It's later revealed that their race had lived secluded from humanity and didn't need to go out and feed on humans. Kars killed em all, and didn't even leave a woman alive for some reason, now being guilty of genocide against two races of beings.</br>  <br><br>Part 6 isn't going to get animated and neither will Part 4. They animated the part normies care most about, they will stop now.</br></br>  It's kinda ironic that a gay priest got killed by an underage shota.  <br>Kars did nothing wrong.</br>  7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;shit&gt;the rest  <br>It was only Kars that hated humans and wanted to kill them, though.</br>  Gay priest is here now.  <br>Gay Priest might not come to a thread full of heretics.</br>  <br><br>Oh, nevermind, he's here now.</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting this shit from?</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>vs<br> strohiem is suddenly on the plane <br> vacano ride into space but that only worked because kars decided to get off the rock, got hit by joseph's hand which shouldn't even be able to pierce his skin, get hit by several rocks which pushed him into space <br> also joseph survives the fall back to earth that should have killed him even if he landed in the water <br><br><br>OK nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  Joseph best Jojo  <br>2 is heavily overrated and it lives only on Joseph being entertaining as hell, most of the other characters are crap and it never compares to the best moments of the other parts.</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br>to give stands<br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br>getting manageble powers through the arrow. Bites the Dust isn't that powerful and can easily be defeated as shown.<br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>In a way that completely defeats all build up, requires no talent or using your brains and is nothing more than 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge". Even Jotaro used his brains to defeat Dio.<br><br>Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall<br>Kars lost because he got distracted by Joseph using his "your next line will be X" trick while volcanic rocks were clearly flying up everywhere around him<br>The surviving part I'll give you.<br><br>So on one hand we have a MC who wins through sheer luck, the same luck that has saved him his entire life.<br>On the other hand we have a lousy final battle that only happened because Araki wrote himself into a corner, forgetting that they already had a working trick against Diavolo that didn't involve pulling an arrow out of your butt.<br><br>Part 2 might be have asspulls, but they are completely in line with the main character and actually get a reasonable explanation why they worked the way they did.<br><br>Part 5 didn't have that. It had powers that were immediately abandoned the next issue because the whole frog thing with Luca removed every challenge later on, same with the slow motion brain acceleration punch of Gold Experience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only hate part 2 because you don't want to look like an animefag</br>  <br>I don't hate any Jojo part. I just don't like part 2 as much as most of the other parts.</br>  <br> 6&gt;7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 </br>  4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;5&gt;1<br>Just starting part 7 now</br>  <br> 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge" <br>except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo<br><br> the same luck that has saved him his entire life. <br>Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky.<br><br> Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall <br>doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. He also made sure Kars was stuck to the plane as it crashed and saving joseph in situation where he would be dead otherwise is no small thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Change 3 and 5 and I agree<br>Would be m8s</br></br>  7=2&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5  <br> complaining about GE's powers <br> while supporting the constantly broken/bent rules of hamon <br><br>Reminder<br> star finger, seeing throw your stands eyes <br> josukes constantly changed fixing abilities <br> jolyne needing to unravel her body to make stone free <br> johnny needing the corpse for his stand, steph steel knows the goldern rectangle running technique, steel ball failed because it wasn't perfectly round while nails work, <br> Everybody does it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo <br>Diavolo literally did all the work for them.<br>Then it went "Hey Diavolo check this out" while Giorno stole the arrow.<br><br> Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky. <br>The majority of his tricks relied on luck. Best example that comes to mind is where his sledgehammer sticks t his ring. Most of his tricks are not much more than quickly adapting to a sudden change of events. Deepest he ever went was against esidisi with the rope trick.<br><br> doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. <br>Actually if you look at the panel where Joseph flies over Speedwagon you can see that Stroheim was no longer there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>About a year ago I tried getting into the anime to see what all the fuss was about. I really enjoyed part 1, made it pretty far into part 2, then lost interest. I picked it up again this year, finished what little I had left in part 2, then watched Stardust. <br><br>I think Phantom Blood and Stardust are much more interesting than Battle Tendency.</br></br></br>  7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;5  <br><br>They are. But Part 4 onwards is more interesting than Part 1 &amp; 2.</br></br>  <br>You know there's more than three parts, right?</br>  Was he an alien? Or just a dumb stand user?  <br>Swap 5 and 6 and this is perfect</br>  <br> Diavolo literally did all the work for them. <br>The only thing he did was figure out how to beat SCR they kept the arrow from him on multiple occasions using sex pistols, spice girl, the blood trick, and GE's life making power. <br><br>I still think it a bit much put joseph's stuff off as luck. Even when they are it was still planning that got him that far, there was no planning in the final bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The greatest fuck ups of hamon were the magnetism trick, that it could destroy rock in part 1, but not harm the petrified pillarmen in part 2, which resulted in Caesar's battle with Wamuu having no other possible ending that Caesar dying like a bitch.<br><br>One could say that Hamon has shown less inconsistencies than stands did.<br>Not that stands are less fun, but Araki should keep a memo of what he is doing at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What magnetism trick?</br>  <br>He would have won if he didn't try to backstab Johnny. Clearly he cares more about his ego than his country.</br>  <br> final ripple <br> dire's head using hamon on the rose </br></br>  <br><br>I can see japan not caring about 6, what with strong female protagonist and all. But 4? Seems right up japans alley.</br></br>  <br> 5 that high <br> 2 at the bottom <br>You are so full shit I can smell it through the screen</br></br></br>  <br> what with strong female protagonist and all <br>What</br></br>  <br> the blood trick <br>Which was perfect to use since it clearly worked, shows tactical insight and would have made a better death for Diavolo than Gold Experience lol instant win for me Requiem.<br><br> there was no planning in the final bit. <br>He only said to Kars that he planned it, only to immediately refute it afterwards, almost explicitly stating that luck saved his sorry behind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but part 6 was less well received partly due to American setting and female protagonist.<br><br>Aka they have shit taste. They put 5 above it..</br></br></br>  <br>Japan likes cute girls, not girls that act like men.<br> This is why Japan is infinitely superior to America in terms of social media </br></br>  <br>Isn't part 4 the most popular in Japan</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying he's a alien. <br><br>But he's a alien.</br></br></br></br>   doppio will never be a part of the gang in part five. <br> helps them out of sticky situations, bonds with them all through hijinks. <br> keeps getting mysterious "calls" though we're unsure of why <br> the guy they were looking for was with them all along </br></br></br>  <br>Is this true or are you pulling it out of your ass?</br>  <br>Its true.</br>  <br>Okay I believe you anon</br>  <br>When they fled from Tarkus using the leaves.<br><br><br>I'd consider both Zeppeli's being able to properly breathe after the shit they've gone through much more unbelievable than giving your ripple powers to someone else.<br><br> dire's head using hamon on the rose <br> not the fact that Dire's head still functioned after being frozen and nothing more than a fucking head. <br>Honestly the hamon rose was the least bizarre part of that moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most clues lead to him being an alien or some other being, but not a stand user.<br><br>even Holly could see stands and she was barely conscious of her own at the time.<br><br>If he had a stand he should have been able to see Crazy Diamond, but he didn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  Josuke &gt; Joseph &gt; jolyne &gt;johnny &gt;Giorno&gt;jotaro&gt;johnathan <br><br> kira&gt;funny&gt;priest&gt;dio&gt;Kais/pillarm<wbr>en &gt;diavolo </wbr> <br><br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon I didn't mean the zeppeli's final ripple.

Followed closely by Josuke</br>  Why is the manga so boring? Jesus christ. I'm trudging through part 6 just to get to cowboys.  <br>How is it boring?</br>  why are there 3 jojo threads? cant you retards keep it together?  <br>Just stick with it.</br>  <br><br>I started reading it after watching the anime, so maybe I'm spoiled by DP's color changes and ost.</br></br>  <br> Muh Jotaro died <br>Good, Gay Priest a best.</br></br>  <br>The problem is that KC can kill during the skip narancia, and cutting the guys hand off. Making it useless for anybody getting attacked by KC.</br>  <br>Absolutely. Too bad saying Joseph is best Jojo results in being called an anime only these days.<br><br>Joseph&gt;Josuke&gt;Johnny&gt;Jolyne&gt;Jonatha<wbr>n&gt;Giorno&gt;Jotaro</wbr></br></br></br>  6&gt;2=4&gt;3=5&gt;1<br>Didn't even know so many people hated part 6</br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>You forgot 7<br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;3&gt;5</br></br>  <br>I didn't forget it.

Steel Ball Run is overrated.<br><br>And so is JoJolion, while I'm at it.</br></br>  <br>Only thing i'd really change about Part 4 would be giving this fucker more screen time. They even show that he's still in the town, you think they'd visit more often.</br>  Just finished the anime's part 2, I'm really fucking enjoying it. I can't believe I waited this long.  <br>Just read through white album, Mettallica, and the final arc. They're pretty much the only good things about the part 5</br>  <br>Listen here you little shit<br><br>Do you even know what overrated means?<br><br>Sword Art Online is overrated.<br><br>Shingeki no Kyojin is overrated.<br><br>Mirai Nikki is overrated.<br><br>Something is overrated because it's trash that doens't deserve to be popular or considered good.<br><br>Meanwhile, Steel Ball Run is fantastic and deserves all popularity it gets. Just because it's popular doens't mean it's overrated, do you understand? Yes? No? Ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything will change. For the better, although you might not see at first.</br></br>  <br>Is D4C objectively the most useful stand</br>  <br> Listen here you little shit <br><br> Do you even know what overrated means? <br><br> Popular thing I dont like is overrated. <br><br> I dont like thing and no one else should either <br><br>you rn</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it, he is right. SBR isn't even that popular to be overrated.</br>   Gay Priest will be arriving in toy form shortly   <br>Not going to deny that, but the use of the word overrated in general is  overrated </br>  Who is best all in all the Jojo's series, and why is  Diego?   <br>jotaro and star platinum oraoraoraoraoraora he killed diego</br>  <br><br>The art in 7 was phenomenal.<br><br>Part 8 feels too stiff which is disappointing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he killed Diego <br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br>have you even watched the anime? jojotaro killed dio</br>  <br> Awakened head with White Snake <br>I mean I know that he'll probably have his first head, but all this means we'll get Kira all over again. Meaning just his alternare hair, no alternate expression.</br></br>  <br> have you even watched the anime? jojotaro killed dio <br> Posts Joseph killing Kira </br></br>  <br>He's got a neat stand<br>He's very ambitious and worked for everything he had instead of having it handed to him like Dio<br>He made out with Hot Pants</br></br></br>  <br>Everything Joseph done is so entertaining. Definitely the best Jojo by far.</br>   Part rankings <br><br>Nobody cares, this thread is shit</br></br>  <br> 4's habit of following different characters for different chapters keeps things fresh. Even some stand-of-the-week villains like Highway Star get their own chapters <br> Above point results in the most compelling villain in the series, as Kira gets his own chapters. <br> Characters are more entertaining, goofy and lively than the previous parts   Joseph excluded obviously <br> stand powers become stranger and the fights become more unconventional <br> Koichi shows more character development than any character up to that point in the series <br> Small town setting gives protagonists opportunities to call in allies for back-up <br> Small town setting simultaneously provides excuses to drag ex-villains in as allies as the plot demands it; characters need to live in Morioh together after all, so its in everybody's best interests to get along post-asskicking <br> Protagonists forced into being reactive rather than proactive gives believable excuses for allies not being present for certain fights, as they all need to keep living their normal lives while searching for Kira/arrows <br> Highway Star <br> Josuke is top 3 Jojo material <br><br>I don't know if it's the best part exactly, but it's got a shitload going for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that it could destroy rock in part 1, but not harm the petrified pillarmen in part 2 <br>I figured that was because Jonathan was a Hamon prodigy or something. Nigger brought dead trees to bloom at the touch.<br><br>Didn't metal criss-cross between conducting Hamon and not conducting it a few times too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 and 5 are the big ones over there.</br>  <br> I don't like it so It's overrated  <br>Fuck you</br></br>  <br>y'know just that colored panel you posted would make a great piece of modern art.<br>i could see that hanging in a museum somewhere, with pretentious fucks trying to explain the meaning behind the snails and rainbows coming out of the negro cop.</br></br>  <br>Profound, isn't it? How the snails represent the darkness trying to block out the rainbows that could wash away the racism blocking his image.</br>  <br>I thought the snails represented how truly slow our society is at solving our racial issues. <br>The rainbow and black cop are supposed to show that we are living in a happy go lucky post racial society, but the snails and the fact that he is a policeman, shatter the image and show that he is still but a tool to enforce long held racial standards. <br>#blacklivesmatter<br>#justicefortrayvon<br>#justtitsformichaelbrown<br>#fuckthepolice<br>#comingstriaghtfromtheunderground<br>#youngniggagotibadcuzhebrown</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how the anime will interpret Funny transforming from a dwarf into that?</br>  <br><br><br><br>I swear I've seen this exact chain of posts before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't but it's entirely impossible because my comment was a meme</br>  <br>1-3 were pretty bad, but 4-7 were good, although 4 is the best.

Part 6 is better than people give it credit for too, Gay Priest meme be damned (to hell, seriously, go away).</br>  <br>It's okay anon, I really like Part 1 as well</br>  <br>Jonathan was best JoJo, though I think if Part 1 was longer it'd run into some really bad pacing issues.<br><br><br>Didn't you say in a previous thread that you were going t shitpost something other than Hotpants?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Part 5 ranked that high </br>  <br>I honestly have a problem where I can't rate things well. I kind of just liked all the parts, I didn't really hate any of them, either. Maybe it's because I've gotten used to what they are, and forgotten my first feelings on the parts when I had first read them. I remember being really uncomfortable with certain things in part 6, and maybe 5, but I forget and it's over with anyway.</br>  <br>I don't only just post HOTPANTS then leave the thread and no I never said that.<br><br> 7 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 5 </br></br></br>  <br> Part 4 is basically nichijojou </br>  <br>No I just told him after I apologized for telling him/them to kill themselves to shitpost something else along with Hotpants, no idea if they responded or not.</br>  <br> Jonathan was best JoJo, though I think if Part 1 was longer it'd run into some really bad pacing issues <br><br>Well, I don't think it should have been as long as, say, Part 4, but I think another volume or something would have been nice. It just feels really short. But maybe that's a good thing to some people.</br></br></br>  Just started Stardust Crusader <br><br>Does this guy get any better or will he remain an insufferable bitch throughout?</br></br>  <br>It just felt really average to me. I get that its a "slice of life" but there was barely any progression in the story. The other parts felt like everything was important.</br>  <br> You are right! </br>  <br>The latter. He is worst JoJo with a boner for one liners.</br>  <br>Gay Priest saves Jotaro's life in part 7.</br>  <br>He will reman an insufferable bitch.<br>In the anime they removed every piece of personality Jotaro had.

Unless you prefer your own imagination on the sound music and color that other's picked, whatever you'd like man. Also fuck gay priest</br>  <br> the art style shift in part 4 <br><br>I can only imagine how the rest of the series would've looked if Araki hadn't changed it so much.<br><br> I seriously can't stand his post-part 4 art style </br></br></br></br></br>   This motherfucker.   <br>I like his new style, the people are better proportioned</br>    <br>Part 5 art was bad for some reason, 6 got better but the proportions got really bad at some parts<br>Beginning of 7 looked good, Johnny didn't yell "JOJO" at first due to the early art but Araki hit his stride with middle to end of part 7, and I'm thankful to the monthly schedule for it. While i love the newer artstyles, Araki gets me annoyed drawing anyone before part 4, sans Jotaro, in his new artstyle.</br></br>  <br> MFW current art style Jonathan </br>  <br>Especially with him having Caesar's headband, I would't mind if Joseph wore it because he did at one point, but on Jonathan, plus being a twink is absolutely shit</br>  <br>Honestly first time I saw him I thought it was Rohan, then I saw Will next to him and went "Oh, it's a Zeppeli family pic- wait, but then why is Caesar next to Joseph in the next picture?"<br><br>Then after looking at it for a moment and realizing who it was I felt nothing but incoherent rage for defiling best JoJo.</br></br></br>  <br> Dollar sign hair <br><br>I'd totally missed that.</br></br></br>  <br> dollar sign hair <br>what u talkin bout</br></br>  <br>look at the side of the before pic</br>    <br>holy shit thanks for the point out</br>  4&gt;8&gt;2&gt;1=7&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br>stardust crusaders was god awful.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/334877/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h45_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>It's out on Batoto now.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Where were you Doc?

Even if he was weak he'd push through by thinking things out, he'd try to understand his enemies, and he put other's well being before himself.<br><br>He had a lot of human flaws but that only gave more meaning to his almost saintly actions, like forgiving DIO.<br><br>Joseph was a silly underdog, so I can understand why he's popular but I prefer Johnathan.<br><br><br>Part 8 will more than likely be the last part of Jojo considering the rate at which it's being written.

It's great. Just finished first season of Stardust Crusaders.<br>[spoilers]Probably gonna read the manga from now on. [/spoiler]</br>    <br>Because people outside of /jojo/ thinks it's gay?<br>You have plenty to look forward to in the manga.</br></br>  What if  Jonathan didn't die?   <br>part 1 is best</br>  <br>4 &gt; 7 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 5 &gt; 1</br>  <br> mfw i recognize every scene </br>  <br>7 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 = 3 &gt; 6 = 1 &gt; 5<br><br>You will not deny me the bro material that all Zepelli's are.</br></br></br>  Guyz, am i the only one who unsatisfied with the ending of part 7? I mean, zeppeli died for nothing, johny got fcking nothing, but recovered lis legs a lil bit. Seriously, even president's death was nothing. Joestar got tricked by dio fucking brando, defetaed by his own stand ability, he lost sacred remains and in the end the saviour of this world happened to be luci. LIke, for real? Wtf? Now i have this shit taste in my mouth. Arigato, based araki, you ruined it.  <br>those are some of the most well know scenes, people who don't read jojo probably recognize those.</br>  <br>Pls be bait</br>  1 &gt;&gt;&gt; Everything else<br>Fuck your stands and shit, soap opera jojo was best jojo.</br>  <br>Someone with great taste, at last.</br>  <br><br> Horrible taste. Parts 7 and 8 are also soap operas and they aren't 50 chapters long and bad.</br></br>  <br>If I got to ask Araki something I'd ask what was the point of his character because I don't get it.</br>  <br>exactly what I was gonna post. 10/10 taste<br><br>Not even hard really. 4 and 7 are undeniably best, 2 is a really close third (arguably best if we account for how great the anime adaption was), 1 and 5 are undeniably worst, 3 and 6 are middle but 3 has the edge for how great the Egypt arc was. 8 will probably wind up being pretty high-tier once it's actually finished.</br></br></br>  <br>you already posted him. Best villain with the best fucking stand.</br>  <br>Sorry, can't hear you over your shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm almost done with 4 and can say<br><br>2=3&gt;4&gt;1<br><br>I'm gonna leave now to avoid spoilers</br></br></br></br></br>  Started reading part 8 recently and already caught up. Wow this isn't even near the middle, is it? Is Araki ever going to finish this?  <br>It's probably gonna last 3 more years <br>Or more</br></br>  <br>You cannot be more wrong with that ranking</br>  <br>What chapter/page is this pic from?</br>  <br>Dude, that's fan art. It doesn't even look like Araki art.</br>  <br>What is it you like so much about 4? There's less of any sense of adventure that I liked about 2 and 3. There's no real threat of the world coming to an end, and I liked that aspect too. Also, some of the stands are just fucking stupid in 4.</br>  <br><br>Meant to respond to this. I'm drunk.</br></br>  <br>I feel kind of similar, though it depends whether part 8, which i just started reading elaborates on what happened johny</br>  <br>Love interest for jojo, except unlike Erina or Suzy-q he actually has some decent fight scenes</br>  <br><br>It felt more fun than most of the other parts. Part 3 was way too serious through the whole thing. Sure it had some silly moments, like the Mariah fight, but those were few and far between. On the other hand part 4 was so full of fun bits that I can't even remember most of them. <br><br> Josuke beating Aqua Necklace because he swallowed a glove <br> Yukako kidnapping Koichi and making him eat shredded dictionaries <br> Cheap Trick <br>Josuke and Okuyasu trying to get rich quick with Shigecchi<br> "I am an Alien" <br><br>It also had really cool serious fights as well, like everything involving Kira. I liked Shigecchi's Harvest more than DIO's World (widely considered the best part of SC), just because it felt more fun, and bizarre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  (8 so far, feel free not to count this) &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 1 &gt; 3  /r/ing pic related with Okuyasu and Shigecchi  <br>Stone Ocean began with a crappy masturbation joke and ended in a way that made me wish the last few chapters had been crappy masturbation jokes instead.<br><br>You cannot like 6. It is literally impossible to like 6.</br></br></br>  <br>It had several great 'wow' moments that made it pretty good. The mobius heart is one of my favourite bits in all of Jojo.</br>  <br>He's just the most irredeemable main character in JoJo and if he's seen as a love interest it pretty much undoes all of Jolyne's character development. Even Romeo is better than him.<br><br>I still stand by my opinion that it was one-sided to the end and Jolyne lied.</br></br></br>  What the fuck happened?  <br>I'll give you that, a lot of the character variety and development in 4 has been better than than previous chapters by far. I'd say Josuke and Joeseph are more interesting MCs than Jonathan and especially Jotaro. And I like that a lot of characters in 4 were handled in more complex ways than just some filler jobbers like in 3. But 2 and 3 just felt like they had a pace and setting that kept me more interested as far as action than 4. Love Deluxe is shit, already done with that guy that was Tarkus' partner in 1. And Enigma Boy was boring. So is the cat plant.<br><br>Maybe I'll change my mind once I've finished the other parts. I've def been reading 4 faster than any other parts do far.</br></br></br>  Let's just hypothetically say Araki ends up doing a sci-fi JoJo after JoJolion (he won't, I know).<br>Could he draw mechas well and how would something like that even look in his heavily human body focused art style?</br>  Is the new chapter out yet?  <br>part 4 seems to just drop a bunch of random characters.<br>Even though they defeated killer queen, most of the characters now dead (shigechi or aya for example) or the electric tower man, mikitaka and even main characters like koichi Yokako and Jotaro weren't shown in the manga much.<br>I think honestly Okuyasu or Rohan had more screentime than Josuke.<br>While incredibly good, it still felt a bit rushed of an end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, check Batoto</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>You got him friendo</br>  <br>What a terrible format but  what fantastic taste </br>  <br>Might as well come back to /a/ by 2030</br>  <br> Condoning skipping <br>Who the fuck let this post go?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but what the fuck did Araki do to Tonio? His nose was never flat like that. He isn't black.<br><br>In terms of anatomy, post part 6 seems to be heading in the right direction but the athleticism and /fit/ness is fully gone. Araki drawing pre part 4 characters is absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit fucking taste</br>  That single sunlight yellow overdrive.  <br>like faggy evas</br>  <br>He's the only good thing about part 6. Jolyne was a worthless JoJo who accomplished nothing in the end (at least Jonathan beat Dio in a fight), Jotaro was at his most useless and the crew didn't have a strong enough bond. Even DIO was acting too domestic in the flashbacks. <br><br>I'll give you Bohemian Rhapsody, so it's just slightly better than Part 1 with everything considered.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Part 5 you fucking faggots. Part 5 is the most popular in Japan.</br></br>  <br>Normie opinion</br>  <br>You have godawful taste</br>  4 is filled with fillers, so i'll put it last  <br>Part 3 is more popular. Part 5 fans are just louder about it.</br>  <br>5&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;4 <br><br>See?

That's the one of the first plot twists in this part. But we don't know how, why etc. yet.</br>  <br> colouring male lips just because Araki did it in part 7 <br><br>Don't do that</br></br></br>  <br>But Araki did it in other parts as well.</br>  <br>Exactly what happened in the cap, an edgy fuck of an anon talks about wanting to kill people for pleasure, causing the other anon to explodes into rage and Idealism babble. The two anons agreed to meet up and beat the shit out of eachother in real life, but only under the condition that if the pure anon loses, they'll have rough sex.<br>I've said this before but I'm so damn jealous.</br></br>  <br>You're a faggot secondary that probably just started reading. Shit even that is too generous of an assumption to make.</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1</br>  <br>Like the other guy said, he's both Josuke and Kira. <br><br> It sounds really confusing. <br>It is. It's 10 volumes in and we are still uncovering more mysteries than getting any closure.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Part 8 will more than likely be the last part of Jojo <br> considering the rate at which it's being written <br>How on earth are you arriving at this conclusion? Nothing at all has pointed to this being the last part, in fact it's the opposite. Part 8 seems to be a side part before the next big one.</br></br></br>  <br>That one, if it weren't for DIO's sexiness.</br>  4&gt; 7 &gt; 1&gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 3  <br>And Part 9 will begin a couple months later.</br>  <br>Then why the hell does he have the same name as Josuke Higashikata like the one in part 4.</br>  <br>Get yourself a cheeseburger and drop JoJo for good.</br>  <br>That picture is bad and you should feel bad for posting it.</br>  <br>He is half alien. His mother is human.</br>  <br>Part 1 is also my favourite part as a standalone, but that's not to say the other parts are "shit". Stands are great and the wacky powers are really entertaining.<br>Please don't give us a bad rep.</br></br>  <br>That's his name. He's only a couple of weeks old and a fusion of two people. One of them was called Yoshikage Kira and the other was Josefumi Kujo. Don't think too hard about the little allusions Araki throws in because there's not a single character you could call a 1:1 "counterpart".</br>  <br>He lost his memory and a qt girl gave him the name Josuke after her old dog that died.</br>  <br>Joseph &gt; Josuke &gt; Jotaro &gt; Jonathan &gt; Giorno<br><br>Kira &gt; DIO &gt; Dio Brando &gt;&gt;&gt; Kars<br><br>4 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could do an original story from between fights in Egypt, or a non-canon sequel to DIO's World with more depth into The World's timestop ability. DIO could really start throwing kitchen sinks this time.</br>  <br> The protagonist in part 8 is the alternate Universe version of Josuke, Jotaro or Kira? <br>The answer is to stop thinking about it like that.</br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Average taste</br>  <br> More posts saying Giorno is worse than Jonathan <br>He is the EXACT SAME fucking character but better. You people are retarded.</br></br>  <br>Most people don't put part 1 that high.</br>  <br>He is reading part 5 right now. He included Giorno, but he didn't judge whole part and antagonist.</br>  <br>Why? And why are you in these threads if you haven't read the whole thing?</br>  <br>Because JoJo threads are filled with absolute morons now.</br>  <br> He is the EXACT SAME fucking character but better. You people are retarded. <br>I agree and I'm not even a Jonathanfag.<br>Jonathan is more passionate and noble though, he's more of a sensitive gentlemanly Kenshiro, it seems more like Giorno takes more of his traits from DIO.</br></br></br>  <br>2 is literally the only good one. Stands a shit.</br>  <br>Giorno is way more one dimensional.<br><br>I liked the personality change between kid Jonathan and adult Jonathan.</br></br></br>  <br>I read everything JoJo related. I'm not that guy, but when I was at part 6, I was regularly in JoJo threads. In fact, I spoiled myself some of part 7 moments, but I don't know what wrong is to visit thread about series that are you actually reading.</br>  <br> Giorno takes more of his traits from DIO <br>I can only agree in regards to his ruthless and merciless nature. The rest of Giorno is pure unadulterated Jonathan in the way he values his comrades and speaks in a polite manner.<br><br>Araki really nailed the mafia boss personality in Giorno, it's too bad we'll have to wait forever for a proper English version of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read a proper translation of Part 5 before pretending Giorno is one-dimensional.</br>  <br> I can only agree in regards to his ruthless and merciless nature. <br>It's also the calm methodical way he presents himself. He desires to become a Mafia boss, and talked about taking control of the town, that's a latent desire for power. The only thing Jonathan and Giorno have in common is the polite way he speaks, but even Dio spent a good chunk of the time acting polite to get what he wanted.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. The real point I'm trying to make is that he's a fantastic character that hardly gets enough attention.</br>  <br>He gets plenty of attention outside of /a/, ever heard of Pixiv?<br>Giorno is easily one of the most popular Jojos outside of /a/ and they wank him hard.</br></br>  Takanashi, why? You were doing so well. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OGp<wbr>9P6QvMjY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Inami suicide generator.<br>http://ux.getuploader.com/anime2010<wbr>/download/62/Inamin_Shimeji.zip<br>pw: inamin</br></wbr></br>  Poplar is perfection  He has plenty of reason. His sisters have traumatized him with their violence and imposing features, then here comes Inami smacking him with a 5-ton straight for just being in a nearby vicinity. <br><br>Also him liking her ties him at least a little bit with masochism, which is something else he has a strong disdain for in part due to another family connection, his brother-in-law. They've even played off that joke with Nazuna, and now her reaction back then when she thought he was an M makes more sense with that character introduced.<br><br>Imo Takanashi is a pretty great person and deserves another pretty great person like Poplar instead of someone so flat, violent, and easily brainwashed. But he'll get with Inami in the end so there's no reason to bitch in the first place. Unlike Yachiyo and her thick skull, FUCK that girl's obliviousness is too much sometimes.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I came here to tell you you're an idiot</br>    Inami is cute!<br>Ｃ　Ｕ　Ｔ　Ｅ　！</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5028792  <br>Best part of the OP for sure.</br>  <br>Have other anime used the 'hnnngg' before?</br>  <br> Inami winning <br><br>My niggas</br></br></br>   Satou and Yachiya actually show progress <br> But still fuck it up just enough to actually be funny <br>I'm confused and scared, this is not how anime works. They're supposed to never go anywhere and beat the same joke into the ground.</br></br>  <br>It's all coming to an end anon</br>  You know Underling-chan has a point, Satou wants to be in a relationship with Yachiyo but he doesn't know a damn thing about her.<br><br>They can't even hold a conversation for longer than five seconds unless it's specifically about work or the people they work with. That type of relationship has disaster written all over it.</br></br>  <br>Eh, not like he's shown he's one to talk much. Besides, he only knows nothing about Yachiyo cause Yachiyo only talks about Kyouko.</br>  <br>It's funny I was laughing at the exact opposite of that. To suggest that knowing things makes a relationship is hilarious. It doesn't. Wanting to know does. Attraction does. Enjoying each other's company does. Why do you think lesbian insurance is so sexually frustrated and ultimately a failure when it comes to hooking it with boss?</br>  I want to live a normal life with Maya  <br>Yeah the episode plainly illustrates that he's a great listener towards Yachiyo, and it's not like knowing her blood type or favorite food offhand when they're not even in a relationship yet has any actual bearing on things.<br><br>Only crazies think memorizing trivial facts about the person they're interested in makes them a good match. It would have been weird as hell if Satou could actually answer most of Mitsuki's quesions beyond maybe birthday or favorite food/show</br></br></br>  <br>This is the last season anon.</br>  <br> If certain drama CDs are any indication, once they get together, Yachiyo starts talking about Satou all the time instead of Kyoko so maybe he's learned to deal with it. </br>    <br>With sound. </br>  ED Yachiyo has some serious wiggle  Your face when?  <br>From what I remember from the manga, after they start dating there's one of Yachiyo talking Kyoko about how "Satou did this" "Satou did that"</br>  <br> I don't know how japanese relationships work </br>  <br><br>Nazuna keeps getting bigger. Yet somehow keeps getting cuter.<br><br>This show is truly amazing.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Manager not even in top 5 <br><br>disgusting</br></br></br>      I don't get it. Is she a wingman or not? If she's bothered by Satou and Yachiyo's romance, why did she lock them in the storage closet together?  <br>So... they get together later on, right? Please tell me because I can't take this anymore. I need to know the truth.</br>  <br>The conversation before she locked them in clued her into the fact that Yachiyo might like him back.</br>  <br>So she's trying to help out, but she's also bothered by it?<br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 170cm <br><br>Maybe his sister isn't getting bigger but that he is getting shorter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She just does things without thinking about them.</br>    <br>She probably doesn't want Satou taking Yachiyo away from her, but she obviously wants Yachiyo to be happy too.<br><br>Therefor bat goes in wall, Yachiyo goes in stock room with Satou.</br></br></br>  <br>At Takanashi mainly</br>  <br> Todoroki that far below Yamada, even after two episodes showing off how adorable she is <br>What is wrong with you Yamadafags?</br></br>  <br> Wanting to know does. <br>That's the point. He should have asked her these things if he was interested in her.</br></br>  <br>Working has extremely high excellent adult woman concentration, Yachiyo's losing votes to people voting for Kyouko or the older sisters, who still think very highly of Yachiyo. I know this because I'm one of those people.</br>  <br>Gonna need a bigger bat.</br>    <br> big burden <br>FUCK YOUJ</br></br>  <br> Inami Mahiru 37 votes <br> first place <br>What the actual fuck /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>When did Inami become cute?</br>  <br>Did you watch the latest episode?</br>    <br> Yes  <br><br><br>I was so happy this development was happening and when Takanashi said that I wanted to punch that bastard. It really hit me the most when Inami threw that little punch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>After all they've been through together, of course Takanashi should be with Inami. What show have you guys been watching?<br><br>There are people in here literally complaining how Satou barely knows Yachiyo and how it's a superficial relationship. Well you don't have to look far to see one where the characters have gotten to know each other well.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking yes.<br><br>Will Takanashi be the one who confesses? Do they get to  hold hands? </br></br></br>  <br>First time she's hit someone all season</br>  <br> of course Takanashi should be with Inami <br>I agree with this statement, but I also think they are the two worst characters in the show.</br></br>  <br>It's almost like Inami is best girl or something.</br>   Both Yamadas are supporting Katanashi and Inami   <br>They're easily two of the best characters in the show. The worst characters are<br><br> drunk sister <br> delinquent siblings <br> absentee boss <br><br>Season one, I would have ranked both Yachiyo and Inami pretty low, but they've both gotten over the things that made them bad in the first place (attacking people).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maya bro _  ww@</br>  <br> tfw I forgot how this was resolved in the manga <br>At least I can watch this now without spoiling myself.</br></br>  This show would be much better if they removed Inami, just write her out somehow.  <br>Why would you list the surname first? And if you're going to list the surname first, why would you put a comma after it? That's retarded on two different levels.</br>  <br> Yuno is first <br>Everything in the world is right yet again.</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>It really pisses me off that faggots like you hate Inami, but give Yachiyo a pass.<br><br>Either hate both or slit your wrists.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Yachiyo a cute, Inami a shit. It's not astrophysics, anon.</br>   Top Tier <br>Izumi &gt; Kyouko &gt; Yachiyo<br><br> Very High Tier <br>Mitsuki = Kozue = Poplar &gt; Inami<br><br> Regular High Tier <br>Nazuna<br><br> Above Average Tier <br>Yamada &gt; Maya &gt; Kazue<br><br> Still Average Tier Also <br> Maya </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yachiyo is a lesbian bitch who regularly attacked and even tried to murder people for showing even the most innocent consideration towards Kyouko.<br><br>She was always worse than Inami. There's never been a point in the series when she's been better than her.</br></br></br>  <br>If you REALLY want to know, you can read the source material. I think Takanashi will be the one to confess, but it will be a very halfassed thing and Inami will have to pick up the slack.</br>  <br>Everyone works at a restaurant, Inami is the only one that wants to attack 1/2 of the population.</br>  <br>Somehow that fact makes me feel uneasy about their future.</br>  <br> wants <br>She's always been bothered by her fear of men, fool. And despite that, she's never attacked a customer.<br><br>Yachiyo, meanwhile, has regularly beaten up customers outside the restaurant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know opinions could be THIS shitty!</br>  <br><br> Takanashi is the one who confesses. Yamada jumps out of the bushes and congratulates him. Takanashi beats him up. </br></br>  <br>pleb list</br>  <br> WAAAAAHHHH LESBIANISM IS CUTE SO IT'S OKAY FOR YACHIYO TO MURDER INNOCENT PEOPLE <br> INAMI IS JUST A HETERO SLUT SO I DON'T FIND THE THINGS SHE DOES APPEALING <br>Fuck off, /u/ cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>I have been bullying Inami all day, this was terrible for my productivity.</br>  <br>Because she refuses to serve them. Honestly if this were race, ethinicity or sexual orientation people would understand that she doesn't belong in a restaurant, but because she hates men, it is endearing?</br>  Where did it all go so wrong?  Haha, no way. Your face during this moment?<br><br>I'm glad they resolved it eventually.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>If she hated men because she was a lesbian, you'd be all over her, so don't try to accuse other people of double standards, faggot.<br><br>And you're not supposed to like Inami for her fear of men. It's not put in there to make her cute; it's there so she can have an arc. The whole reason she gets cured of it and stops punching men is that it was a character flaw.</br></br></br>  <br>Lel, m80 I'm not the guy you were talking to, control your autism.</br>  <br>Eh, I knew it'd be played for comedy and moved past within a few scenes anyway</br>  <br>I've met people who were afraid of black men, I just told them to suck it up and do their fucking job.<br><br>She should have been fired ages ago.</br></br></br>  <br> she should've been fired ages ago <br> implying it isn't beneficial to the employer to hire someone with mental problems because then they get mad cash from the government for giving them a job. </br></br>  <br><br>see <br><br>Either hate both Yachiyo and Inami, or fuck off.<br><br>You don't get to just hate one, when they both have (had) a similar flaw.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate neither you fucking autist!<br> you don't get to hate one <br>I didn't know you had some sort of authority, fuccboi, my apologies.</br></br></br>  10/10  <br> I didn't know you had some sort of authority, fuccboi, my apologies. <br>You don't get to come to Working threads and be a hypocrite. You're not entitled to that.<br><br>I remember being on /a/ when season one was airing, and everyone hating Inami, but giving Yachiyo a pass. And that faggotry is still persisting to this day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess watching alone and later instead of with everyone else really affects how you think. I've always wanted Inami to reach her goals.</br>  <br>She's going to get me killed, I just fucking know it.</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br>In season one I would've loved for her to have some dream or some other situation where there is magic shit, so she got turned into a boy and had to deal with stuff, including a jerk like her so she could have some fucking sympathy. <br><br>But that season ended, and I just figured a character like her should not work at a restaurant.</br></br></br>  <br> you hate this character so you need to hate this one too <br>That's not how it works you fucking retard, my god.<br>people/characters having overlapping qualities, does not make them the same.</br></br></br>  <br> Popura being threatened by Inami <br>The fuck is wrong with you /a/<br>Get it together.</br></br></br>  <br>Justice</br>  Why is Takanashi such a violent freak?  <br>It keeps telling me to update Java or something.</br>  <br>Where is Kotori?</br>  Takanashi is a shit head  <br> yamada not first <br>What are you doing /a/?</br></br>  <br> filname </br>  <br><br>Kyouko is perfection</br></br>  She deserved the cold shoulder.<br><br>Inami consistently beaten the crap out of Takanashi for one entire season.

I don't know why I ever doubted you.<br><br>That said, the Inami "punching" him scene was really well done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was about to have a fucking stroke</br>  <br>There's no need to hate both of them.<br>Yachiyo is olev and inami a shit.</br></br>  Fuck those Kyouko titties.

Hope they fix this in BDs.  <br>As far as QUALITY goes that's not too bad.</br>  <br>I haven't seen an honest to god HNNNNNGH moment in anime in quite some time</br>  I can't believe he ran away. <br><br>What a pussy.</br></br>  <br>That scene was hilarious.</br>  <br>I laughed hard when he grasped his heart. I know that feel.</br>  the manga is more lewd than the anime sometimes    <br>isn't it the working x servant x service drama cd?</br>      <br> 若干ほんの少し微妙に微細に <br>He's even more tsundere in the manga, huh.</br></br>  <br>Ded.<br><br>Also he's also fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br> he's also fucked up <br>What do you mean?</br></br>  <br>Watching Working starts feeling like watching paint dry under a rainy day.<br><br>You were doing so well the past ep, just dry already for fucks sake.</br></br></br>  <br>Those last panels are soul-shattering</br>  Nothing sus at all. <br><br>Workplace shenanigans are the best.</br></br>  <br>Single handed mace is shit. Go two handed club/mace and what you lose in shield you'll more than make up with DPS.</br>  <br>Yeah no.<br>I was relieved there were more Inami scenes after all the Chief bullshit that went on for way too long.<br>Yashiyo = worst girl. She isn't cute like Inami, not adorable like Yamada, she's just a close-eyed retarded freak.<br>Pic related for true best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm also a Yamadafag, but please stop.</br>  <br>Never. Truth must be told.</br>  I also like Yamada  <br>i want to bully her with my dick</br>  It's all your fault Yamada. All the faults.  <br>Why the fuck would you post that ugly 3DPD shit?</br>  <br>Did she appear ? Or will she appear at the last episode like the last 2 seasons?</br>  <br>Do you not watch the show?</br>  Reminder that this is definitely the last season because the manga ended.  <br>I'm downloading this season right now. I don't like waiting for a week after a watch 20 minutes</br>  <br>Well it's not over yet so you'll have more waiting to do anyway.</br>  <br>I couldn't wait anymore. I want to see more Maya aka best girl.</br>  Is Popura going to have to stab a bitch?  <br>Considering that they are wrapping up the plotlines, this was obvious</br>  Will we get to see Inami's mother again?  Man why is Souma so good. Best boy.  <br>Welp.<br>Time to drop this shit.</br></br>  I haven't watched s2. Is it safe to just skip it?<br>Were there lots of development in s2?</br>  <br> Hey guys can I watch just the first and last episodes of this SoL series? Will I miss anything? <br>Watch it, you idiot. S2 is great, and you'll definitely enjoy S3 more if you've seen S2.</br></br>    <br>You mean spoil her with your dick.</br>  <br>I know. I already know how I will cope. <br>That or suicide.</br></br>  <br> I haven't watched s2. Is it safe to just skip it? <br>For what purpose?</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>What is your reasoning for this ? It's a SoL there is near 0 development.</br>   s3 of Working now <br> go to sad panda <br> 95% popura and inami doujins <br> the remaining 4.9% is yaoi <br> barely any shit about the takanashi sisters </br></br></br></br>  <br> barely any shit about the takanashi sisters <br>This shit makes me so mad. All three of them are at least 8/10</br></br>  <br> three </br>  You brought this on yourself.  <br>Meh, I don't like Nazuna that much.</br>  <br>I think Satou is as bad at contributing to the relationship as Yachiyo. He's just actually aware of his feelings</br>  <br> Circumstances fuck you constantly <br> Finally have a clear shot <br> Just walk out <br>I felt so bad for the guy up until this. Now I just want it to end so they can all stop being idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this program needs java to run, do you wish to install java? <br>yeah nah, fuck you.</br></br>  <br>S2 had the crossdressing, didn't it? Why would you want to miss seeing best girl?</br>    How come can Souma and Satou can have the same days off ? Don't they need chefs ?  <br>How can that restaurant survive with only two cooks anyway?</br>  <br> Circumstances <br>Yeah, no. He has always been a fag and could have made the first moves plenty of times. And then he goes and takes his frustration from being a fag by abusing the kindest girl Poplar. I like how people bitch about Inami, Yamada or even Yachiyo but give him a free pass.</br></br>  Archer tried to sell her out to Shinji. <br><br>He was also an all round asshole. The fact that he saved her later from the Grail doesn't right all those wrongs.<br><br>So why should she feel sad that he is fading?</br></br></br></br>  He was a hot piece of ass that loved to do housework, at least that is a reason to feel sad about him fading.  Because she  pleases old men for gems   Because he's Shirou. A twisted, broken version of Shirou, but still the same guy deep down, and just like how she wants to help Shirou, she wants to help Archer, but she can't, because he's stuck looping forever.<br><br>That's why she's sad.</br></br>  <br>He's a Shirou, not the same guy she saw trying and failing to jump high. He doesn't have the same life experiences as Shirou, although they're similar. He also doesn't have the same way of thinking as Shirou, although that's similar as well. But he's born in a different universe and he doesn't have the same soul as the ginger fuck she saw failing the high jump. So he's really just a guy who's kinda similar to the Shirou she knows.</br>  <br>Both have the same starting points, they start to diverge though when the war begins, but even then, Shirou sees into Archer's past and realizes he may very well end up on the same path as him. We know from a meta standpoint that he doesn't, but when you look into the face of your future, there's a bit of weight behind that.<br><br>Archer had the same ideals as Shirou, the same hopes, but they got twisted over time due to facing reality alone and becoming a Counter Guardian. Rin sees this, and wants to make sure her Shirou doesn't become broken like him, but at the same time, feels sad for the Shirou she can't save.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu is a hack.</br>  Because women have an irrational urge to look after emotionally wounded dark handsome men.  <br>She was in love with him. Girls like assholes.</br>  <br>She wasn't in love with Archer. She was pretty firmly in Shirou's camp throughout UBW, but she did care about him, because he was a version of Shirou.</br>  <br>She was clearly in love with him.</br>  <br>She really wasn't. Like, go back through UBW. Outside the prologue she is like, constantly wary of Archer. She uses command seals on him to stop him from hurting Shirou, chooses not to use him because she thinks he'll betray her. It made me realize that Archer was actually a lot less prominent in the route than I thought because of that.<br><br>She cares about him because of the dreams, but she directs that all towards Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>He's baiting you, stop responding.</br>  <br>She didn't get to fuck him. Now she has to wait who knows how many years for Shirou to finally get his dicksize.</br>  <br><br>You're wrong, Archer is to Shirou what Saber is to Arturia. That's why Seiba projected so hard into their duel.<br><br>Saber considered the boy and Archer one and the same. Do you think it was different for Rin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Two years. Max.</br>  <br>Because she has empathy? Not to mention she's literally seen his memories. Its like you werent even paying attention.</br>  <br>I love this meme</br>  <br> Because she has empathy <br><br>No she doesn't secondary . Rin doesn't give a fuck about things like that.</br></br></br>  <br>She is a massive cunt towards anyone she doesn't want to fuck. She cares about Archer because she wants to get fucked by him.</br>  <br>The only one she's rude to is Sakura really, and HF kind of goes into why that shit went down.</br>  <br>Physically, mentally, historically, spiritually, and metaphysically they are two different people. Two similar people, but still different. It's not the exact same as for Saber, who is the same Arturia from back when in both mind and spirit.</br>  <br> Rin doesn't give a fuck about things like that. <br><br>She might want other people to think that but its obviously not true. Way to fall for her tricks anon. I have read the VN btw, and there are moments where she feels empathy when no one else is around.</br></br></br>  <br> here are moments where she feels empathy when no one else is around <br>That's just Nasu pandering to the waifu-fags and shouldn't be taken seriously.</br></br>  Archer probably assumed Shirou already had a plan to rescue Rin and left it up to  fate . He knew the odds were stacked against him 4 to 1 and that one of them would attempt a rescue while the others fucked his shit.  Why can't Arturia dematerialize if her Servant body is made from magic just like everyone else's?  <br>Confirmed for having never read the fucking VN or even watched the anime</br>  <br><br>Because it's her real body.</br></br>  <br>So I should ignore what's written in the VN because it doesn't match your headcanon?</br>  <br>Isn't her real body back in ye olde Britain? Does she teleport away from her knights every once in a while?</br>  <br>She's stuck in some time loop shit. I guess she's just frozen in time on the hill there until she breaks up the contract.</br>  <br><br><br>Youre waifu is an educated prostitute.</br></br></br>  How can Karna be in the Throne of Heroes if he's a god?  <br>Really? Even someone whos only seen FZ would know the answer to this one.</br>  <br>Because he was enshrined before ascending in Apocrypha and divine spirits can be summoned in Extra/CCC</br>  <br>Sorry, meant to reply to </br>  <br>Better than a natural born slut.<br><br>One is doing it because she was forced, the other because she was born a whore</br></br></br>  <br>It can either be because a) Nasuverse Karna is not a god, or b) the Karna in the Throne is a fraud.</br>  <br>Nasu don't care about things like internal consistency, he just makes up things on the spot and then changes his mind later.</br>  <br>Heroic Spirits only get in the Throne after the hero has expired, otherwise they're not in there at all. It's why Merlin is not in the Throne, because he's spending eternity in fairy land. The Karna in the Throne cannot be the soul of the living Karna.</br>  <br> Physically, mentally, historically, spiritually, and metaphysically they are two different people <br><br>Physically: yes, separated by time.<br>Mentally: only as a matter of maturity and experience.<br>Historically: not until the divergences of the 5th Holy Grail War.<br>Spiritually: they are identical.<br>Metaphysically: they are two separate contexts of one unerring existence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karna is the son of Surya and Kunti. Kunti is a mortal, so Karna is only a demigod.</br>  How can a person of faith get this ripped as fuck ?<br><br>Does catholic church make its member do push-ups and all that shit before prayer every day?</br></br>  <br>Void shiki is god</br>  <br>The only thing they have to do right is the finale. Literally nothing else in that route is worth anything.</br>  <br>She's connected to the Void, and she has power to unmake/make thing, but she isn't God.<br><br>But still, the point is that she disappears, and even says that this might be the last time she speaks since the boundaries between Shiki and the world is nothing more.</br></br></br>  <br>She's an incarnation of a record. She can be likened to a god in potential power, but apparently has some sort of limits if Servants can kill her.</br>  <br>Void Shiki is an aspect of Alaya.<br><br><br>Alaya is NOT god.</br></br></br></br>  Was it drool?  <br><br>this is not okay.</br></br>  Did someone edit this scene to have her shout ALLAHU ACKBAR yet?  <br>grool is thicker.<br><br>Do you think MC will let Anna know she was being lewd? Will that speed up the plot? Will MC not tell her until later?</br></br></br>  This girl is fucking insane. I'm really hoping that the MC is a broken man after this and stays the fuck away from her  <br> This girl is fucking insane. I'm really hoping that the MC is going to fuck her for good <br>fixd</br></br>  that is, until SNK screwed it over...  <br>Don't they still make KOFs?</br>  <br>what's their latest one?</br>  <br>I wouldn't know, only fighting games I play these days are the Blazblue ones.</br>  <br>Exactly</br>  <br>The newest KOF is 5 years old or something, but they've ported it onto a couple of platforms since.<br><br>They made some mobile game called "Metal Slug Defense" that did well probably mostly with people that never even played Metal Slug. Other than that it's really just porting the old stuff.</br></br></br>    <br>Pure slut.</br>  <br>Pure best.</br>  <br><br> girls dont have needs and urges <br>thats very immature of you. you may want her to stay "pure", but she will still go around fucking as many doorknobs as she wants</br></br></br>  <br>you believe lies that she propagates</br>  <br>Rin is all talk when it comes to sex. She doesn't know what she's doing, and spazzes out each time. The fact that she destroyed a hotel room is proof enough.</br>  Gather around fellow donkeys because our daily dose of hyper oats is still raw.<br><br>Any word as to who's subbing it?</br></br>  <br> Is this the end to Psycho Pass or will there be more movies or series? <br><br>With how popular the franchise is? There's no way it's ogre.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's not so much a side story as things getting worse as Sibyl taking over more of the world and expanding power.</br>  <br>OP here. You are a gentleman and a scholar anon. Thanks a million.</br>  <br>That's true haha, anyways it was a really great movie to watch. It would be interesting to see what direction this series would take after what was shown in the movie</br>  <br>The hero we needed</br></blockquote>]
