[ So NT13 getting translated when?  Which Dragon is your favorite and why?  <br>The one who fucked up Izzard</br>      <br><br>Last I saw was that Baka Tsuki had done 4 parts of chapter 1, but the edit information says July 7 and there hasn't been any progress since then.</br></br>  <br>Is that a dick?</br>  Hopefully really soon so that I can get HO and Zashiki Warashi faster.  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127807<wbr>352/#127823926_58</wbr></br>  <br>This. I don't care what that faggot Touma do, I want my Yukari dammit</br>  <br>I want Heavy Object first since Zashiki is boring as fuck especially when detective parts starts.</br>  I finished Index II and I'm going to watch the movie later today, but what was up with the ending? For the last two episodes they started a semi-new storyline with Accelerator and GROUP, which was arguably more interesting than literally anything from both seasons of Index and on par with Railgun, but then it just ends. <br>S3 when?</br>  <br>Because HO isn't boring right?</br>  <br><br>If S3 happens you will have an arc early on that focuses on GROUP and the conflicts with similar groups in a big battle royale.</br></br>  <br>2016. Read volume 15 and 19 of the LN if you just wanna carry on with that accel storyline.</br>   s3 happens <br> it is a 4 cour adapting everything from terra of the left up to agitate halation <br> othinus arc is adapted into two movies </br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Hayabusa's part was awesome. It's Mai that's boring</br>  <br> S3 <br> happens <br>Heh keep.praying</br></br></br>  <br> s3 happens <br> It is a 2 cour adapting everything <br> othinus arc is 4 episodes </br></br></br>  <br>Index anime should end after WW3 then the anime would have stopped before everything went to shit.</br>  <br>That should be 8</br>  <br><br>Im sure we can all agree that Zashiki Warashi needs more Zashiki Warashi.</br></br>  <br>does Touma have an arc nemesis yet? i dropped this series after nt2.</br>  <br>He gets the Anti Touma at the end of NT13.</br>  <br>1 week</br>  <br>He's probably just some scrub who'll get taken out in a single volume so wouldn't say anything yet.</br>    <br> implying a good ending like this will happen </br>  <br><br>If anything, Touma should be thought of as the fucking savior of the universe, since that's what he literally is. Literally no respect.</br></br>  <br> Touma dying <br> implying that he will not suffer forever </br></br>  <br>I love hte angel one.</br>  <br>I dropped this somewhere at NT2 because of shit load of new characters and forgotten old characters. <br>Is he still adding new characters? <br>Who the fuck are those old man and a girl with hanafuda on a hat?</br></br></br>  <br> Touma should be thought of as the fucking savior of the universe, since that's what he literally is. Literally no respect. <br><br> kills 6 billion people because he wants to go back home <br><br>Yeah he's true hero alright.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It keeps getting worse so don't even bother picking this shit back up.</br>  <br>I meant ofuda</br>  <br>Touma wishes that he'd die, but he can't.</br>  <br>killing 6 billion fake people is okay</br>    <br>Yeah, too many characters. That old man was High Priest, a magic god, that girl was Niang Niang, also a magic god</br>  <br> "magic gods after my dick again huh" <br> "my butt hurts" <br> "please kill me" </br></br></br>  <br>I really like Touma's sweater. It's surprisingly stylish and durable for clothing found in a dumpster.</br>  <br>At least he didn't blow up every iteration of his home planet in every timeline because it was in a recursive loop and then store the data in his head leading to a consequent amnesia and then meet the last surviving member of his species who accuses him of genocide and then locks him in the basement and then consequently has the guy die on him leaving him forever alone only to restore his planet and blow it up a second time leaving him alone again because he again found a second member of his species only to find out that &gt;muh angst was entirely misplaced and the planet is actually in a painting after multiple other genocides. <br><br>Touman did literally nothing wrong compared to other main characters. He is still a hero.</br></br></br>  <br> touma <br> getting a peaceful end <br> not being hated and spat upon all across history while perma banished and trapped under a rock. </br></br></br>  <br>This. She's too fucking capable. It's boring to read.</br>  <br>And that's why in her chapter in volume 4 when Sunekosuri took the lead was awesome. He's like non-faggot version of Touma</br>  Do you think there was a world where Othinus tried to break Touma using post-orgasm torture?<br> she slowly teased his dick for hours with her fingertip to make it super sensitive <br> the second after he has finally come she violently took him inside her and brutally rode him while he was crying and begging her to stop </br></br>  <br>muh dik<br>also i doubt that.</br></br>  Railgun 78 raws: https://www.mediafire.com/?13f1672r<wbr>1ha84wa</wbr>  <br>Nice Hamazura cameo</br>  <br>Honestly after DRRR I can see Index 3 being split 3 cour and adapting the rest of Index.</br>  <br>No he needs to at least read the Othinus arc solely for NT9</br>  <br>Othinus x Touma forever, but sorry, her powers are a massive pile of asspull to the nth degree.</br>  <br> implying <br>othinus is literally female odin, shes allowed to do that anon, actual norse mythology is far more retarded in that regard.</br></br>  <br> 2016 <br>Given that Railgun S out just about 2 years after Index II along with the Index Movie, I'd wager that if JC Staff should want to continue adapting shit, we'd get an announcement this year for either winter/spring 2016, or if we're lucky Fall 2015.</br></br>  <br>Fall 2015 is not happening at all. You get HO and that's it. I'm willing to bet Index won't even happen for most of 2016 either. You only have one shot and that's Fall 2016.</br>  <br>couldnÂ´t she literally just drink Mead of poetry<br>to get her power back?by the way were are her<br> ravens?</br></br></br>  <br>Othinus isn't really important in NT9, it's all about Touma confronting himself, his goals and his reasons to fight.<br>Magic God powers were just a plot device to make that happen. Without them there would be no way to pull off the perfect world that is not just an illusion.</br></br>  <br>I've been thinking this as well. How well is DRRR! selling, comparatively? Perhaps they're trialling the format with that before doing it with other properties.</br>  <br>For that to happen, wouldn't she have to admit that she herself suffered the same thing?<br><br>The narrative implies that she subjected him to experiences similar to her own.</br></br></br>  <br>your right anon, it doesn't help the fact theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit.<br>even if she just had the idol theory crap from the crossover she could very well get her powers back that way.<br>finally i'm fairly convinced huginn and muninn are fucking around somewhere in an alternate phase, probably gonna show up sometime soon.</br></br></br>  <br> theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit <br>Now THAT's a good plot twist.</br></br>  <br>the thing is NT 12 pretty much hints about it, 1% of infinite is still infinite after all.</br>  <br><br>also why is anti touma comig after her if she supposedly lose her powers?<br><br>She is suspicious</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> anti-touma is coming <br> Othinus has intel that she will (eventually be defeated) but she knows that Touma could combat this threat <br> lay low <br>Well that's one hell of an interesting theory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that would get through OT at most.<br>i doubt that would reach the othinus arc.</br></br>  <br>Maybe in some previous world Touma got his arm cut off and Othinus was violated by yet unseen Dildo Dragon.</br>  <br>if you tack on the fact that she legitimately cares about touma a fair bit more then everybody else and seems secure with him after the whole mess of him fighting the entire world for her, it seems like a solid theory at least.</br>  <br>I assume by rest of Index he means rest of OT. I doubt we'll get more than 1 more season, maybe another season and a movie at most. Unless they decide to treat NT as a separate project or something.</br>  <br>It also seems like a fairly solid plot allowing for further development of her character. <br><br>I kinda expected Mikoto to get development after the whole Accel dev arc, but I think that maybe Kamachi isn't done with Othinus yet if the spoilers are right.</br></br></br>  <br>that's the preview released online before the book was on sale</br>  <br>ther is always a question that bothered me. In Nt10 Maria uses deinslef to summon Vishnu from his phase.Othinius is Odin so what would happen if <br>Maria would use Asgard to summon Odin? Are in the Toaru verse 2 odins?</br></br>  <br>There really were no panties, just like Haimura said.</br>  <br> 6 billion people <br> people <br>your imaginary friends don't count as people, anon</br></br></br>  <br>that is based off the assumption that othinus originally came from the phase the series is based on.<br>othinus clearly isn't and thats why it would probably work,<br>since essentially theres alt universe odin which is othinus and the odin of the toaruverse.<br><br>now the interesting thing is othinus could very well try taking the power of the odin of the phase she is currently in, i don't see why she couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touma isn't able to recognise accels voice  <br><br>Still find this shit retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't speak for that long and Accel was squealing through most of it.</br>  <br>Voices generally sounds different when they come through a phone</br>  <br><br>The thing is that the perfect world created by Othinus wasn't any more or less real than Touma's world. Of course state of a perfect happiness wouldn't last to long due to humanity's ability to fuck things up, however people saved by Othinus weren't just illusions. By returning to his own world, Touma reverted all changes Othinus made, so for example Sisters that were well and alive in the perfect world returned to being dead again in Touma's world. If he didn't take any action, they would stay alive. That was the entire reason of his breakdown.<br>He didn't actually kill 6 billion people like anon said, but he destroyed a possibility of thousands of people being saved.</br></br></br>  <br>well even in the cross over she is powerful enough to brute force IB back.</br>  Is there a pasta describing how magic works, or is Index all about "It's magic, I ain't gonna explain shit"?  <br>Read Birdway's explanation in NT 2.</br>  <br>Read NT2, it explains how magic works in Toaruverse dubbed Idol Theory</br>  <br>NT2 is the go to know how on how to into magic</br>  <br><br><br>Well then, call me a faggot but I'll read that when it comes out in 55 years.<br>How does it compare to the nasuverse's magic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/Idol_Theory<br>See for yourself.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Dude the volume was fan-translated and the best you can read before Yen Press reach that point. Check Baka-Tsuki.</br>  <br>That's why I told you to call me a faggot.</br>  <br>Faggot. But honestly the translations are pretty great.</br>  <br><br>Faggot.</br></br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br><br>Look at this fucking faggot</br></br>  <br>You've surpassed being a faggot, faggot</br>  <br>holy shit you are a fucking fag anon.</br>  <br> doubting js06loli's translation <br>faggot</br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ, NT 13? I had to stop at 3 because shit was just out of control.<br><br>To think, even now Touma is still not getting any.</br></br></br>  <br> not getting any <br>Not getting any what? Girl? He had too much</br></br>  <br><br>But did you see how much of a faggot  is?</br></br>  <br>He's a terrible mc.</br>  <br>He's actively going out of his way to avoid getting any at this point. He could have Mikoto or Kanzaki any time he wants, so I can only assume he's some kind of faggot.</br>  <br> ITEM fanservice <br>BASED</br></br>  New accel chapter fuking when?  <br>End of the month, same as usual?</br>   He held up his right hand, the sole area his reflection was activated on. <br> The water spear was smashed to pieces. <br> The water turned to a rainbow of light that flowed diagonally back from &gt;his right hand <br>and this happened in SS2<br> The mysterious guts guy naming himself Sogiita spread his arms wide, bent his back like <br> a bow, and announced this to the heavens. Haratani didnât know how it worked, but an <br> explosion of colorful red, blue, and yellow smoke appeared behind him. <br>coincidence i think not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Where are these pictures from?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice phone Touma's got there.</br>  <br>Fuyukawa and Kamachi must have finally remembered that Railgun fans feed off hype and pandering.</br>  <br>It's LO's. Touma keeps 'fukou da'ing his.</br>  <br>Has it repaired from vol 14? Or did he change his phone?</br>  <br>I think his power is the Manipulation of phasen.<br>when he use his Power this happened<br> it seemed like something was wavering like a mirage. <br>the same thing is with his AIm field.<br> the AIM diffusion field around this guy was rather unstable. Even <br> when he was not doing anything obvious, she still couldn't visualise him in this state. <br> Maybe there was some power obstructing the sighting of the AIM diffusion field. <br>He is like ollerus who changed his Mana into something Inexplainable.<br>And he said about his Power:<br> "Well, my ability is still baseless! It expands endlessly! <br>I am just guessing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering how Gunha's power is a complete black box, and basically all other Esper powers have been analyzed, Gunha might just be able to cause reverse causality.</br>  <br><br>I assume he has a new one because he has both Accelerator and Hamazura in his contacts.</br></br>  <br>yea but that would be to easy. <br>his power is related with Ollerus power.<br>what they are doing is basically the same.Like Thor and the Holistic Esper.<br> Iâm similar but different. It might be a lot like the relationship between Ollerus and the <br> exact same phenomenon, but Iâm not actually one of them. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They exchange numbers in NT2. What I want to know is his phone. Damn nigga got many durable things. The jacket, the phone, the hair gel, fucking nigga</br>  Next arc involving all 3 of them fucking when?  <br><br>We need another festival arc, but it may be too soon since Ichihanaransai</br></br>  <br> Touma <br> getting anything other than suffering <br>His harem is big but its shit and full of people that will beat him down if he try making a move on someone.</br></br></br>  Wait a minute, I bet the Misaka network can p2p infinitely. The ultimate bittorrent.  <br>You're not even worth of being called a faggot.</br>  HQ SCANS WHERE  I really feel sad for Touma. He's already sleeping in the bathtub but here comes another freeloader.  When will Accel fuck Worst?  <br>The Sand Worm.<br><br>Then the Cobra.</br></br></br>  <br>But she had shitload of kids.</br>  <br>He wouldn't be in this situation if he wasn't some little bitch.</br>  <br>Aynone who still denies that Kamikoto will happen is delusional. Eat a bag of dicks Othinusfags.<br><br> Damn I wish I could belive my own lies. </br></br></br>  <br>cant help that misfortune is in love with him</br>  <br>I really don't see how he can't tell index to fuck off and let him sleep im his own damn bed.</br>  <br>He has no idea why Index is even there. This is what he's used to, and it's literally the only way things have been for him from the start. You might as well as him to change apartments. Index is a part of his status quo.</br>  <br>i wonder what will index look like after she is 18</br>  <br>Like Laura.</br>  <br>Is this an actual question? It's already been stated that she'll look like Laura.</br>  <br>so i've been wondering something for a while.<br>is index actually biologically related to laura?</br></br>  <br> yfw index is Laura's granddaughter </br>  <br>Unknown. It's a prominent fan theory that Laura+Crowley=Index</br>  <br>With zero supporting evidence, just a fun joke really.</br>  <br>Index isn't stopping him, he's just afraid he'd lose control and dick her if he had to put up with this every night. Hell, she would crawl into the tub with him if he didn't lock the door.<br><br>And she'd probably fucking scalp him if he tried locking her in the bathroom instead.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Index has sex scenes.</br>  <br>Not from lack of trying by some characters</br>  <br>don't forget the entire anglician church would seriously try to kill him if he did.</br>    <br>He would be fine, really. He is a normal school boy after all.</br>  <br>So the reason why Touma keeps index is to cultivate and witness that growth so he can taste it fully?<br><br>And they say Aleister is a great schemer</br></br></br>  <br><br>They already think he has. That's why Stiyl isn't pleased with him even existing.</br></br>  <br> Stiyl <br> got a personal Marisa to dick (and two other sluts) <br> does nothing <br>14 year old faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>26 episodes:<br> 1: Vol 14 <br> 2: Vol 15 <br> 3: Vol 16 <br> 4: Vol 17 <br> 5: Vol 18 <br> 6: Vol 19 <br> 7: Vol 20 <br> 8: Vol 21 <br> 9: Vol 22 1 <br> 10: Vol 22 2 <br> 11: SS2 1 <br> 12: SS2 2 <br> 13: NT 1 <br> 14: NT 2 <br> 15: NT 3 <br> 16: NT 4 <br> 17: NT 5 <br> 18: NT 6 <br> 19: NT 7 <br> 20: NT 8 <br> 21: NT 9 1 <br> 22: NT 9 2 <br> 23: NT 10 <br> 24: NT 11 <br> 25: NT 12 <br> 26: NT 13 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 14 year old edgy faggot. <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br> cramming each volume into 1 episode <br><br>u fucking wot?</br></br></br>  <br>This would be so shit I couldn't even.

Kamachi will be fine with both of those things.</br>  Reminder that Frenda a shit and worst girl.  <br>We have limited budget, we can do it in 13 episodes:<br> 1: NT 11 (flashback parts, because we respect the timeline) + Vol 14  <br> 2: Vol 15, 19 (Thematically work together better)  <br> 3: Vol 16, 17, 18  <br> 4: Vol 20, 21, 22  <br> 5: SS2, Norse Mythology <br> 6: NT 1, 2 <br> 7: NT 3, 4 <br> 8: NT 5, 6 <br> 9: NT 7, 8 <br> 10: NT 9 (World Alpha, Beta) <br> 11: NT 9 (Panties Hell) <br> 12: NT 9 (World Omega) <br> 13: NT 10 + parts of NT 11 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Nda&gt;Fre</br>  <br>A single route VN would be relatively easier to make. Heck, you could just do it with Adobe Flash. Adding flags and shit makes it much more complicated. You'd need at least one story writer, one character designer, a music composer, and someone to program the entire thing (The last one could be all of the former three working together. Putting up something with ActionScript 2.0 wouldn't be that hard). The only thing I don't know how to make from a basic VN in Flash would be making saves and loading them, but a pre-set scene viewer is easy to make.</br>  I dislike Othinus and her arc for precisely the same reason I dislike Sakura and Heavens Feel. Othinus and Sakura should have gotten a Superhero or Sparks Liner High ending, not a good ending. Shame Touma doesn't have an equivalent of Saber. A Saberfriend would suit him well  <br>oh yeah what happen to the crossover?<br>is the manga raws up somehwere?</br></br>  <br>http://kodoku21.blog83.fc2.com/blog<wbr>-entry-3604.html</wbr></br>  <br>I dislike Sakura and like Othinus.<br>I feel the difference is that to save Sakura Shirou has to change his ideal, while to save Othinus Touma just had to keep his. Touma never wanted to save everyone or create a perfect world, he just wants to save the people in front of him as best as he can.<br>Also the fact that Othinus had so much less actual impact by the end (with not a single kill resting in Touma's shoulders, ultimately) might have something to do with it. Helps that Touma didn't have to get amnesia too.</br></br></br>  When will we see touma being pissed as fuck again and act like what he did in ot 2?  <br>Possibly next volume when notTouma is trying to kill Othinus</br>  <br>Touma's still being forced to save someone that it would be better to not save. If Shirou turns his back on Sakura, he dies, kills everyone, or is brain dead. If Touma turns his back on Othinus, he'll probably go insane and die. And Touma pretty much did admit his ideals are bullshit too</br>  <br>when othi is kill</br>  <br> Touma pretty much did admit his ideals are bullshit too <br><br>You know what, because of him admitting that he bullshits people so he can punch them made me respect him a little.</br></br></br>  <br>When accelerator beats the shit out of him.</br>  <br>so never.</br>  <br>Oh I can understand that. I was hoping for character development there but NOPE things are back to normal except with a little more waifubait and a sprinkle of PTSD</br>  <br> Respecting a guy who allowed two world wide criminals to escape punishment </br>  <br>When Touma inevitably stops living his life correctly, someone's going to have to punch him in the face. Who better than his greatest disciple?</br>  <br>shiage or Gunha.</br>  <br>But can they tank Touma's punches like accel can?</br>  <br>You know admitting is development do you?</br>  <br>When Touma stops living his life correctly, he's going to need way more than one punch.<br><br>Every one of his friends are going to get a turn. Accel, Index, Mikoto, and Shiage being the hardest hitting.<br><br>By the end of the novel he won't have any teeth left.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw the final fight is Demon Lord Touma vs Angel Accelerator with the full blessing of the Misakas <br> Accelerator wins and reverts him back to normal without killing him <br> Misakas are like "Holy fuck that was cool. Is it time to go hand Aleister his ass with my two favorite people?" <br> Aleister goes down like a bitch <br> Happy ends for everyone! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunha definitely.<br>Shiage beat him last volume like the pussy he is.</br></br>  <br>Literally this.<br><br>Touma a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Who better than his greatest disciple <br>Fiamma?</br></br>  <br> Shiage beat him last volume like the pussy he is. <br> mfw Hamazura fags unironically think this </br></br>  <br> yfw the final fight is Demon Lord Touma vs Angel Accelerator with the full blessing of the Misakas. <br>Yes<br> Accelerator wins and reverts him back to normal without killing him <br>just No.ThatÂ´s boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br> his teeth regenerate <br> turns out Aleister stuffed them full of dragons too <br> most of the series would have been a cakewalk if he just bit people like Index </br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Would you rather Accelerator just knock him out and a surprise Misaki saves him with an Othinus memory wipe</br>  <br>Gunha got trashed by a girl, he's weak as fuck. <br><br>At least shiage and accel been putting bitches on lock.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure?<br>He looks fine to me?</br></br>  <br>  Accelerator just knock him out  <br>No I want Demon king Touma just being Demon king Touma.Accelertor is and will always be the Last Boss.<br>Strong yes but in the end of the day he will be beaten.</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather it be a group effort by everyone relevant. Shiage too, since he's a protagonist after all.</br>  <br> Accelerator <br> Last boss <br><br>What? He'll be on the team against the last boss.</br></br></br></br>   guy who can cause earthquakes and whip out tornados lost to a normal highschooler with average street fighting skills <br><br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>Everyone woks together to pin down Touma, then Index stabs him with a dagger.</br>  <br>Well Shiage and Mikoto would probably be cleaning up Demon Lord Touma's mess anyway and save a good chunk of people</br>  <br> railgun will never get good like this again </br>  <br>It might, it'll take a year or two to get there though.</br>  <br> by everyone relevant. <br>I don't think you understand what he meant.</br></br>  <br>Best thing for me would be they think they have beaten Him but in truth he just deceive them kinda like Othinius in NT8</br>  <br>Index will be on Touma team.<br>She will stab Shiage trying to beat him.</br></br>  <br>Would anyone be on his side if he goes full Demon Lord?</br>  <br>Assuming Othinus is dead, Will.</br>  <br>Touma is quite charismatic if he he wantÂ´s to be</br>  <br> wanting to show then what they wanted <br><br>and thus why the cycle of hatred never ends. Why kill them when you can change them for the greater good.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting to show then what they wanted <br>huh?</br></br>  <br>Why not?<br>I'd be really surprised if no one will join him.</br></br>  <br><br>Is Demon Lord Touma would be Kumagawa 2.0?</br></br>  <br> a sprinkle of PTSD <br>i dont think breaking down and crying like a bitch in the floor triggered by just the mention of magic gods is a "sprinkle".</br></br>  <br>Hopefully?</br>  <br>It won't be his fault.<br> MedakaDex when? </br></br>  <br>Probably but with more blank stares</br>  <br> Will and clones <br> maybe Accel if Will can force him <br> Othinus if she isn't dead <br> Nephthys </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw kumagawa is basically evil touma with unlock IB/magic god power. </br></br>  <br>No one would side to him except will <br>nt9-nt10 pretty much showed how everyone will turn against him when his not living up to the expected role his given.<br><br><br> No one would go near a rabid dog they cant control.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto would probably just tell him to live his life correctly with another hug of 1 billion volts.</br>  <br>He wasn't Demon King there, through.</br>  <br>He'll never be as based as kumagawa.</br>  <br>I imagine Maou Touma to be someone like Mad Scientist Shinobu.</br>  <br>Yeah he reacted the same way when he say that zouken looking nigga right?</br>  <br> I will be better than the main characters.png </br>  <br> spent most of the day running away from him on a bike <br>Seems to be still scared</br></br>  Why are the Misaka's so best?  <br>heh</br>  <br>Do you guys really want this to turn into Shana 2.0? Obviously the girls closest to him (Mikoto, Index, Othinus) would team up to tenderly beat the living hell out of him until he starts living his life correctly again.</br>  <br><br> you will never see kumagawa as MC of Index. </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto <br> close to Touma </br></br>  <br>When jsloli gets his copy in the mail.</br>  <br>Pretty much, yeah.</br>  <br>The whole point of NT13 is that, in fact, she's not close to him in any way.</br>    Why is he so much better than touma?  <br> Wow~ We're riding together. <br> I am, right now, riding together with a guy on a bicycle! <br> If I'd see this coming, I would definitely have dressed white one-piece, oh... <br><br> Misaka, try putting this in your mouth. <br> Are you kidding?! On the contrary, *****-pack will be blown off due to overheat. <br><br> No! I won't give him to you!! <br><br>Wow, did she confess to him in NT volumes?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> smiling when he beat up Touma <br>He's shit.</br></br>  <br> The whole point of NT13 is that, in fact, she's not close to him in any way. </br>  <br>No, and after this volume it's doubtful she ever will.</br>    <br>Are you stupid?</br>  <br> not wanting to smile after beating the shit out of complete faggot </br>  <br> Touma trying to save his sorry ass <br> Hamazura barely manages to scrap a win even though he was in a fucking mech <br> Touma is the faggot </br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you replied to and not a huge fan of Hamazura but shit eating Touma cocksuckers are a good bit of the reason I hate Touma. Always have, always will</br>  <br>I'm not a Toumafag, but that's literally what happened in NT12.</br>  I like Mikoto, but I want her to get hurt.<br><br>Aleister's favorite or not, its getting silly how she keeps walking out of meatgrinders without so much as a broken bone or nasty cut when the other prominent fives have been horribly maimed, Kuroko has been shot and stabbed on multiple occasions, Saten nearly got murdered by Murrica, Uiharu got tortured and fucked up her hands stopping the truck, and Kongou got the crap beaten out of her. The most damage she ever took was the fight with Mugino and that was still so little she slept it off.</br></br>  <br> letting a fanbase affect you in anyway </br>  <br>Mikoto's plot armor is greater than Accel, Touma and Hamazura's combined.</br>  <br>Mikoto will never, ever lose a real fight. She will never be injured enough to go to the hospital, she will never get mindbroken. She will continue to be the perfect companion when you need someone reliable to help you out.</br>  <br>I want her to get hurt so   a nearby Accelerator can save her because seeing it reminds him of the Sisters Project. I want this so it will flip her worldview upside down </br>  <br>Touma is shit even without his shit fan base</br>  <br>That actually sounds like it would be amazing. However, the fact that it would be good means that it won't happen. Kamachi will just continue to maintain the status quo because  it  is a hack.</br>  <br>She is hardly in any fights though.</br>  <br>Kamachi is just a shit writer.</br>  <br>I want to see her face when she's like "Y-you mean not everything is black and white? T-things are more complicated than I thought?" It would be awesome.</br>  <br>I'm sure that you are a much better writer than it anon, why don't you publish your own book?</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Mikoto is literally so good that she managed to beat ITEM while running at like 5 percent her normal strength.</br>  <br>Oh shit not this again</br>  <br>ITEM is just incompetent as fuck, anon.</br>  <br>She still needed a man in shinning armor who can wipe the floor with her if he wants to defeat an Esper she couldn't ever hope to even scratch and stop the experiments.</br>  <br>That's fine, since it gave us one of the best scenes in the series.</br>  <br> Mugino <br> not retarded <br>laughinghamazura.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>It was still good when Frenda easily tricked her and kicked her bony ass.</br>  Reminder that Touma agrees that Mikoto is useless and a burden. Mikotofags BTFO.  <br>To be fair, there wasn't really many on the Science Side who cold take on Accel at the time.</br>  <br> Frenda <br>LOL</br></br>  <br> LOL <br> Mikotofags </br></br>  <br> Wasn't many <br>Pretty much no one.</br></br>  <br>Only two people I think.</br>  <br>Frenda is shit, so that makes it all more embarrassing for Mikoto.<br><br>Also, she's fucking retarded for paralyzing the tongue of someone she wants to interrogate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Amata and maybe Kakine. <br><br>If Touma didn't found about the Sisters and instead Kakine did, would Mikoto pledge loyalty to SCHOOL in exchange for the life of her clones?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Without Touma Mikoto would have just killed herself against Accelerator. Maybe if Kakine beat Accelerator and saved the sisters she would love him but that's entirely out of character for Kakine.</br>  <br>Maybe Gunha?</br>  <br><br>Electricity users are just that strong.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Cole a shit compared to Misaka. Even Last Order is stronger than him.</br>  Reminder that even if Mikoto and Touma had done nothing, the Sisters wouldn't have all died. Aleister would have called a halt to it or given Accelerator the okay to back out of the project which he never wanted to do in the first place  <br>Gunha's attacks are strange but still abide the laws of physics, right? So Accel's powers would wok on him. It would be a draw if Gunha can keep up or Accel wins.</br>  <br> actually believing Accelerator really would have killed her when he didn't the first time </br>  <br> still abide the laws of physics <br>Nah, they are simply bullshit, like, they just work.</br></br>  <br>He would have.</br>  <br> implying he wouldn't have just clicked his tongue at her, called her a moron and went about his business </br>  <br>No, he would be pissed and just kill her anon. Accelerator wasn't a good guy.</br>  <br>I think you're severely underestimating his psychosis at this point in the story.</br>  <br>He didn't fucking kill her the first time so why would the second time be any different? Even if she was retardedly determined to kill herself using his power, Aleister would have stepped in.</br>  <br>She was desperate enough to kill herself. She'd take that deal in a heartbeat, though she'd probably be nearly as desperate to get out after the first few jobs.</br>  <br> Aleister would have stepped in. <br>Touma was Aleister stepping in</br></br>  <br> filename <br><br>Post discarded</br></br></br>  <br> Implying  <br><br>Nigga would smack her shit up with that amp.</br></br></br>  <br>Original&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Clones&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cole</br>  <br> he doesn't think accel raped them </br>  <br>True, Touma stepping in meant Aleister didn't have to do shit. But I don't think he intentionally sent Touma in to fix it</br>  <br>He didn't although your edgy teenage mind thinks he did. Either that or you're just posting for replies</br>  <br>He's right you know. Accelerator must have raped them, it's the only logical thing to do.</br>  <br>Misaka is one of the weakest electricity users I've ever seen.</br>  <br> 1 billion volts <br> 360 Radar Sense <br> Iron Sand <br> Magnetism  <br> Hacking <br> weak </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All of that shit listed and she barely won against Item </br>  <br>Mad Scientist Shinobu meet Demon Lord Touma and Object Creator Quenser when?</br>  <br>U mad.</br>  <br>Why is her electricity attacks slow as fuck? Niggas be catching that shit.</br>  <br> light speed <br> "slow" </br></br>  <br/>  <br>I don't think she needs to be super hurt but she can at least get hit. dodging by skill is one thing but anything she can't stop is blocked by a third party. Or just get btfo by good magicians like everyone else.</br>  <br>The time will come, and Mikotofags will get BTFO when that happens.<br><br> muh super special snowflake girl that never gets hurt and everything works out of her gets a taste of her own medicine! </br></br></br>  <br> Light speed <br><br>Sure.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not unusual considering that modern fashion is all about making yourself look like a hobo.</br>  <br>Author descrpition&gt;&gt;&gt;your opinion</br>  <br>I'm sure there are more Mikotofags who want to see her get hurt in a srious fight than haters.</br>  <br> The authors description is never bs </br>  <br>Kamachi is just a retard with no sense of scale.<br>According to him, Mikoto's railgun is just as fast as a bullet and high powered AC sniper rifles apparently shoot bullets at a velocity equivalent to a low powered modern day pistol.</br></br>  <br>Kamachi puts a lot more research into his magic than his science.</br>  Didn't kamachi say that hamazura smelled the carbon monoxide in NT12  <br>No he smelled a byprodukt from carbon monoxide</br>  <br>Hamazura always has a good nose, it's probably his esper power or something.</br>  <br>Maybe they've got futuristic CO detectors that output a distinctive smell rather than beeping.</br>  <br>Touma and Gunha can both block attacks that are impossible to block.</br>  <br>He's a level 0 Super Sniffer.<br><br>The one power Touma is actually jealous of.</br></br></br>    <br>christ go back to your underdeveloped, needing help from middle schoolers Akatsuki Kojou</br>  I'm still reading volume 18...  <br> buy a fancy new CO detector <br> emits a pleasant cherry scent <br> just want to keep smelling it </br></br></br>  <br>Anon, don't tell you don't like British halloween.</br>  Not gonna lie, I stopped at vol 13 and SS1 because I want to experience everything in anime format before reading it. I think it's more fun that way.  <br>I still find the "ecchi parts" awkward.</br>  <br>Hope you have fun waiting</br>  <br>You can experience NT 9 in 20 years. That's something nice to look forward to.</br>  <br>Index is pretty much shit before vol 14<br><br>You're missing out on like 1/4-1/5 of the content by not reading it.<br><br>I'd say read through the entirety of it so you can get to NT9</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At this rate you'll probably see the actual WWIII before you see WWIII.</br>  <br>After all this time and countless anime, I still don't understand why do we need ecchi. If I wanted to watch a hentai, I would have watched a hentai. When I want to watch a battle shounen, I want to watch cool powers used in creative ways and over the top fights.</br>  Is it normal that I fucking hate Kamijou? Shiage and Accelerator are way more interesting.<br><br>I hope it gets better. I have seen many spoilers like people "crying" about Othinus arc or that Kamijou has dragon in his right hand.</br></br>  <br>Material for the waifufags. Unfortunately it's a staple of the genre. Very occasionally I find it funny, at least.</br>  <br>Tell me one successfull LN without ecchi.</br>  <br>Where are you up to? He's pretty bland initially but I can't think of anything that would make you hate him.</br>  I just finished watching everything Raildex related.. still have one question: What did Touma and Index hear at the last scene of Endymion?  <br> spoilers <br> that Kamijou has dragon in his right hand <br><br>You just watched the first few episodes of the anime and came here immidiately?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari.</br>  <br>I mean this <br><br><br>I'm  with Carissa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It does have fanservice, at least, in the earlier novels. Not as much as your usual novel, though, yeah.</br>  <br>Those, Dragons, oh. Well, they are from the Railgun manga.</br>  <br>Maybe I just have to give up on Touma and go for Biribiri.</br>  <br> Is it normal that I fucking hate Kamijou? <br><br>Completely. Honestly, outside of Japan and little fandom enclaves like the one at /a/, Touma's very much an acquired taste.</br></br></br>  What non saint or magicians can beat mikoto excluding obvious ones like olly and up.  <br>This. Touma a shit, and people just like him because the MC or as a meme. I can't stand him or Othinus. And I've never liked him.</br>  <br> tfw i use to kinda like Touma but then NT happened </br>  <br>It depends if they can block electricity. If they can't she can just fry them before they do their magic</br>  <br>People like different things, shocking uh?</br>  <br>I'm pretty much the opposite. Touma was just kinda there to me until NT</br>  <br>Touma's a shit. People only like him because he's the MC, he's a meme, for his retarded suffering, or as a waifu prize.</br>  <br>You sure know how to convince people with your arguments anon.</br>  <br>Mikoto is a better character than Touma when she's nowhere near him</br>  <br>Fuking this. Touma needs to fuck off from railgun.</br>  <br>But it's true. I'm not here to convince you or argue with you anyway</br>  <br>or they need to fuck off from interacting period. I hope NT13 seals a distance between them</br>  <br>I'd take a deal to get Touma off of Railgun and Mikoto off of Index</br>  so in the end what's it gonna be:<br><br>touma x misaka OR touma x index?<br><br>i am rooting for misaka x [spolier]kuroko[/spoiler]</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Only have Mikoto appear in the main series when she's needed. And by "needed" I don't mean shipperfag scenes with a guy who's shit anyway and probably not going to survive the series as is</br>  <br>But misaka sells index.</br>  I just started reading the LN and jesus fuck, why didn't anyone tell me Frenda gets killed of like that.<br><br> Why the fuck is it that every minor character I take a liking to gets cut in half? </br></br>  <br>It's not a battle royale if no one gets brutally killed right?</br>  <br> ctrl+s </br>  <br>I want to lick Mugino's belly.</br>  <br>How could you be in these threads and still not know? Half the jokes are about her.</br>  <br>Kakine not dying is fucking bs.</br>  <br>Because I don't bother with these threads until like 2 days ago.<br><br>I wasn't being serious with the whole "anyone didn't tell me" part.</br></br></br>  <br>Worst girl on the left kills the pic.</br>  <br>It tastes like silicon.</br>  <br>why?<br>shes insane</br></br>  <br>And Touma also improves sales for Railgun.</br>  <br>I see no problem with that.</br>  <br>That's because retards like the ship and don't care if the characters have shit chemistry and better off separate</br>   âG-gyhhhâ¦ I-I wonder if itâs true what they say about it feeling a lot better if you do it while being strangl- gogyhh!?â <br>Aogami always has his priorities straight</br>  <br><br>There are a large number of people who read Railgun for Touma and Index for Misaka. <br> I'm one of them, I think they're more fun when they aren't being the MC </br></br></br>  JS06 HAS TO FINISH HEAVY OBJECT FIRST  When did mugino burn her skin off? I thought she only lost the arm and the eye?   Toaru Majutsu no Index - Love Letter SS <br>was it rape</br>  <br>Are you a Mikotoshipper</br>  WHERE<br>IS<br>THE<br>TRANSLATION<br>OF RAILGUN 78?<br>FFFFFFFUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but I don't post about it in these threads. I can't help myself, the doujins are too good. </br>  <br>I just find it entertaining watching how incompetent those two are.<br><br>If they end up together or not is pretty much the author's choice, I dunno why it's a big deal or not if people actually ship them.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh doujin liking is fine as long as you don't take it too seriously. I don't think any girl will win and I think serious shipperfags are shit</br>  <br>It was probably that iron sand wind tunnel.</br>  <br> I would like for Mikoto to win the Toumab owl but I am fine with no pairing end. I just think they're cute. </br>  <br>I can't see Touma having an happy ending, he will become a door or some shit like that.</br>  <br>But there IS one, retard. The Vita game prequel to Endyomon</br>  <br>I can't see him surviving the series as he is. I mean Kamachi may pull another direction out of his ass but I just can't see him living a happy life with anyone.</br>    <br>Kek.</br>  So how do you guys will think this series will end now?  <br>Aleister wins, Laura BTFO, Touma suffers eternally, everyone else lives happily.</br>  <br>Fiamma saves the world again.</br>  <br>Kamachi has a hard drive failure and Miki releases his own fanfic ending where Mikoto wins</br>  <br>Somehow I can see this actually happening</br>  <br>How would that even go</br>  <br>When I first red this I hoped the dragons would turn out to be the enemy Fiamma was meant to defeat.</br>  <br><br>OT -&gt; NT -&gt; NTR<br>It's the final destination.</br></br></br>  <br>Today is write your own fanfic day.</br>  <br>I had given up hope</br>  <br>If either of Misaka's pairings are requited then they lose their whole charm. Cyclic love triangle is the only satisfying ending.</br>  js06 has his book. Translations begin tomorrow.    <br>Status quo end with Touma in the hospital and more suffering sure to come, or dead end where he fixes everything and dies satisfied.<br><br>NT13 might've opened up a third option though. If AC is sealing IB, Kamachi could just say the bad luck was side effect of IB not working properly, and let him live a long happy life after he stops the keikaku and fixes it.</br></br></br>    <br>MUH DIK!</br>  <br>Yes, I think NT13 will end up and be a turning point. Although I still find it difficult to imagine Touma will end up with a long, happy life. I think what you said would be literally the only way to do it and it make sense.</br>  <br>The invisible thing starts attempting to break free, Touma starts dying. On his deathbed, he asks Index and Othinus to seal IT, Othinus uses her Einherjar spell to maintain a retinue of undead guards to protect his tomb.</br>  <br>HE STILL NEEDS TO FINISH HO FUCKING HELL</br>  <br> js06 <br> his <br>anon</br></br></br>  <br>I'd have thought that Osiris suits Touma more, since he's the god of rebirth/longevity which is something required for a series to continue, whereas Horus if that symbolises self realisation etc. well did Accelerator not have that self realisation?<br><br>Instead it looks like Horus is Touma, Osiris is Accelerator and I'd presume that Isis is Mikoto.</br></br></br>  <br>But anon, Mikoto is Nuit</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that the genders are going to match out of sheer coincidence, too. Otherwise the second most likely is probably Kakine.</br>  <br>Yeah, and I'm moot.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;js06 <br> &gt;his <br>Is js06 a she?</br></br></br>   Mikoto: Come to think of it, we only want to know how to get our hands on the Bust Upper. <br><br> Mikoto: So whichever one of us gets it only needs to share the information with the other. <br> Saiai: A fruitless battle would be super silly. <br><br> Saiai: And to check through this many cards... <br> Mikoto: two is better than one! <br><br> Mikoto: We both want the same thing here. <br><br> Saiai: I super wish you luck. <br><br>Mikoto and Saiai sure became buddies quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>programs don't have genders</br>  <br>Mikoto always has enjoyable interations with every character that isn't Touma.</br>  <br>Neither do gods.</br>  <br> Gods don't have genders <br>In just about any theology with multiple gods they do</br></br>  <br>js06 = å¥³æ§ (JoSei) 06 = 6 year old girl</br>  <br> Mikoto always has enjoyable interactions with every character. <br>FTFY</br></br>  Does anyone really and truly believe that Touma's going to end up with a nice, happy life with one of the girls? <br><br>For example, Othinus. Does anyone really and truly believe that she'll return to full size and be his lover? Do you really think NT10 was the last of "people are pissed Othinus is alive"? Even if Touma can win against any opponent that might want Othinus dead, is that really a happy life? Then there's the fact that someone like Othinus isn't suited to happy homemaking, anyway.<br><br>Next: Mikoto. Is Mikoto even really in love with him? She's 14 and grateful he helped her out in a traumatic situation. Of course, she could easily misunderstand that as love. She might spend her free time chasing him around and she might want to be his moral support, but that doesn't mean she's as close to him as she thinks or wants to be. <br><br>Neither of them will get a normal, happy life with Touma even if he wanted to have a happy, normal life with one or both of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Of course it won't be a "normal" life; Othinus will return to normal size then her and Touma will always be on the run using the bone boat, saving random people they come across on their grand adventure.</br>  <br> that isn't Touma <br>Tsunhater pls go.</br></br>  <br>I'm fairly sure that I'm the only girl reading this series anyway keeping in mind the demographic.<br/></br>  <br> Tits or GTFO </br>  <br> Do you think NT10 was the last of "people are pissed Othinus is alive?" <br>If you read any of the threads you would know this isn't the case</br></br>  <br> I'm fairly sure that I'm the only girl reading this series <br>You'd be surprised.</br></br>  <br>I hate Othinus and this actually sounds good. Especially if traveling and helping others is her redemption.</br>  <br>I know several girls who read Index, usually it's for Accelerator</br>  <br>But it could be.</br>  <br>Did someone contact js already so we could get an ETA on translation of Railgun?</br>  <br>Tsundereshitter pls go and stay go.</br>  <br>Othinus doesn't deserve redemption.</br>  <br>If you really are female, I promise that you aren't the only female that reads this series and browses these threads to keep up with it</br>  <br>Sounds a lot like the sort of thing Misaka's dad does, could be fun</br>  <br><br>The only remotely decent interactions with Touma happen in Railgun.

Doppel is clearly best girl, not because she is a naked brown loli, but because she chooses to be one.

But there are some hints.<br><br> basing her meeting with darling on a manga trope <br> surprisingly knowledgeable about RPGs <br> some other third thing I can't think of maybe <br><br>At least two out of three. Points toward it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've learned to like spiders more after realizing Rachnee is the best girl, but I was never hugely afraid of them in the first place.<br><br>Didn't stop me from having a nightmare about a black widow the other night, though.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be me.

Same for the 'golden' part, their webs take on golden color in sunlight. It can be genuinely quite beautiful. <br><br>Granted 'orb' is still a misnomer, because their webs aren't spherical, but whatever. Their webs are actually quite neat. There's the 'orb' which refers to the actually sticky part that catches things, which can be over a meter in diameter. Then there are the support webs, which I've personnaly measured examples of over 11 meters across. Then on top of that, they also have non sticky guard webs in much more chaotic looking paterns, a few inches away from the orb on both sides, this is to prevent predators like bats grabbing them, while still letting bugs pass through. <br><br>The silk itself is really neat. In addition to the golden colour, it can be crazy strong. The type of silk they use in the support webs has a greater tensile strength than steel, and is being researched for use in all kinds of things, from clothing, to rope, to bullet proof vests.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm fine with Spider that won't poison/kill me.</br>  <br> that fuggin 'trying to blend in' just pointing vaguely at the crowd <br><br>It's gotta be a red herring right</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  So guys<br>What are you listening to while you watch people fight over monstergirls?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfR<wbr>9iY5y94s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Australlian Monster Girls <br>Oh christ.</br></br>  <br>Did Hound ever get around to recoloring that after I pointed out he miscoloured her left hand's fingers?</br>  <br>i'm fine with a spider</br>  "What did she do wrong?" edition   edition <br>Kill yourself<br>Also Pitou did everything wrong</br></br>    trips <br><br>Damn, bad roll.</br></br>  <br> she </br>  <br> she </br>  Objectively speaking, Pitou was no worse than any game hunter who kills for sport. So you'd have to start from there to discuss if she did anything "wrong".  <br><br> that quality <br><br>Well, she got extremely paranoid after Pufu's scene, you might say that was what she did wrong.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Oh well if we're going to nitpick, then I would agree that Pitou passed up on too many chances to take Gon out before things went south. I don't think anyone could blame her, though, since she literally thought Gon was able to read her mind or was at least too sharp to fall prey to sudden maneuvers. The latter may have actually been true.</br>  Would Kaito suffer from the same fate if he could fight at full power? seeing how happy Pitou was from their brief fight, it seems he could, at least, hold his own against him/her/it.  If Pitou killed Gon before he got the phone call then returned to the palace, would Killua have killed Komugi?  <br>Yeah, Killua and later Gon speculated that it wouldn't have happened if Kite was alone, but that might just have been survivor's guilt. He definitely would have fought better if he didn't lose his right arm, though.<br>Anyway it wasn't a fair fight and i'm pretty sure it's supposed to leave a bad taste in your mouth.</br></br>  <br>Considering that he only managed to scratch her face and that we don't really know what constitutes Kite's "full power", I doubt an extra arm would change the results.</br>  <br>Nothing, he is perfect</br>  What did you think of this weeks episode? Is anyone else hoping a super lewd romance develops between Ayame and Tanukichi? Because I sure am!

Here is proof:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Tu<wbr>voRVR2FY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The anime made some things better. I agree overall the manga was better, but for example the rape-girl was more fleshed and her motives made more sense. Other than that, I loved how the robots took hours to materialize, while in the manga they did it in couple of panels. The clanking sound zearth makes is wonderful.</br>  ;_;  <br>  the rape-girl was more fleshed and her motives made more sense <br>I actually thought she was one of the worst changes they made (along with that entire original ending, holy shit). Her arc was the most horrific one in the manga, but the anime completely neutered her character and changed the entire flow of the arc.<br><br>What about her manga motives seemed inconsistent? I felt like the rape background made a lot of sense with all her actions and made the bit with the shithead who piloted before her much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe they should have done that sad scene properly</br></br>  <br>It lost impact  every time it kept happening. The one where she gets pushed into the train tracks made me laugh. </br>  <br>Watch that edge, son</br>  <br>It's really disturbing seeing Okabe losing the feelings and purposely waiting for her time of death to arrive.</br>  <br>I don't go for hyperbole but in that case it truly was the Tears Of A Nation when it came out across the screens that day in the early 1970s</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SIb<wbr>BKpZWabQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why is it borrowing imagery from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann?</br>  <br><br>Kek</br></br>    <br>You're right on how it was horrifying in the manga. In fact so horrifying neither her or the sensei really felt like real people anymore. Sensei was just complete monster instead of being an asshole. For example in the manga the decision to kill the pilot came sort of nowhere, as it really wasn't implied anywhere that she could go full insane in a second. In this scenario I felt the anime portrayed both characters more humane.<br><br>Not to mention I liked how the anime killed the shithead-dude in an accident, the way how it "just happened" was somehow more shocking and grotesque.</br></br></br>  <br>This meme needs to end.</br>  For a three minute short, Furiko had me in tears pretty quick. The song combined with the story it was telling hits really hard.  <br>The sad part here is Bones continuing it on when it should have been left alone.</br>    <br> ;_; </br>  No one posted this yet? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=euU<wbr>Uxg0XnDM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>So I'm just waiting here to see when the board starts to shit on you</br>  <br>This is a thread for sad scenes you imbecile.<br><br>Nothing about Elfen Lied is sad for people who aren't retarded, edgy 13 year olds.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kE3<wbr>8SKRT4ak</wbr>  [ ]<br> First thing from papa;_; </br>  <br>  it really wasn't implied anywhere that she could go full insane in a second <br>She'd nearly killed the same guy like a chapter beforehand under similar circumstances. And right after she did kill him we got her whole background with her motivations and stuff.<br><br>Yes, sensei in the manga was a complete monster, but I thought that worked. The humane story the anime gave us was basically redundant and done better by some of the other characters, but the manga's violent version stood out - we weren't really given any other evil characters or revenge stories.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I guess it's been time since I read, I recalled it wasn't foreshadowed properly. If it had, I guess it boils up to the different preferences in characterization. I guess I never appreciated sort of "monster" characters, even if the manga otherwise was top-notch.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>so good that I don't mind to watch it again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh shit she might not die better drag her through the fucking snow to make the viewers cry  <br>Tomoya please.</br></br>    Pizza mozzarella    <br>Are you retarded? the image is still from tumblr.</br>    <br>Overrated.

I've been thinking how if there was a book series for the same demographic in the U.S. (For example all the Hungergames shit) with scenes like this, there'd be a shitstorm.</br>   In the last episode of the GARO anime, Leon talking to his dad as he rode out of hell <br> Maybe it hit me so hard because my dad died that week </br>  It was sadder in the manga, but still.

There are plenty that are older.<br><br><br>I don't want to become a lolicon or a pedo.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're really not a lolicon then it's just a phase that will eventually pass.</br></br>  The things I would do to her. That delicious body.  <br> am not a lolicon but <br>I have some bad news for you anon.</br></br>  <br><br> become lolicon <br> all of my friends now avoid me because they can read minds <br> lose my attraction to normal women because human sexuality only allows for liking one thing at a time <br> thought police break down my door and send me to jail <br><br>You're right OP, avoid it at all costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you have that image saved and don't think it's disgusting, you're already too far gone OP.  <br>How is it disgusting?</br>  <br>It is a nice picture. It is erotic without being dirty. It is well drawn so liking it doesn't make me a pedo. <br><br><br>I thought /a/ would be more sympathetic.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sexualized child/loli. I don't know my attraction is literal manchild tier, it hasn't changed since I was like 10-11.</br></br>  <br>Definitely too far gone</br>  <br>Because it's not Hibiki.</br>  <br><br> it's erotic <br> without making me a pedo <br><br>Paedophilia is the sexual attraction to children, your wording definitely makes you a Paedophile. Of course this is assuming 2d loli=child, which is some part incorrect. <br><br> You can argue that loli softcore isn't even sexual since they're children so they don't have their sex attributes, so only a pedo would find them sexually attractive. I know that's my excuse and it will shut them up due to the extreme stigma/fear around it. I just say it's cute, granted some of it is the actual reason why I have those saved </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki is good, but Akatsuki is fine too.</br>  <br>/a/ is being sympathetic. What you need to hear and understand is that liking what you like and hurting other people are two different things and only one of those is wrong.</br>  <br><br>It's sympathy in the form of helping you realize why you're being silly.</br></br>  <br>Fapping to well drawn art doesn't make someone a pedo. Most people fap due to good art, not because it has body shapes x or y.<br><br><br><br>I don't want to be a lolicon and I want help in not becoming one. I imagine a lot of people on /a/ are in my situation too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with being a lolicon?</br>  <br><br>I like how you completely dodged it. Just accept you're already a lolicon, nothing wrong with that.</br></br>  <br>It is a crime and leads you to like heroines based off of one trait. <br><br><br>I am not a lolicon, I just happen to like little girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am not a lolicon <br> I just happen to like little girls <br><br>But liking little girls makes you a lolicon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> liking little girls in itself is a crime <br><br>Alright, he's baiting, we can all go home.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it leads to crime. I don't want to become a criminal.<br><br><br>fapping to loli makes you a lolicon. Liking good art that just happens to have loli in it doesn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It is a crime <br>Not until the thought police become an actual thing. Do avoid raping actual children though. If you think you'll have a hard time avoiding that, you should probably see a therapist.</br></br>  <br>No, it doesn't. It actually distracts your attraction to real little girls. Keep fapping to 2D and you will also lose any attraction to any 3D girls.</br>  <br>She's the best.</br>  <br> attraction to real little girls <br>I am not attracted to little girls and I am not attracted to anything 3D</br></br>  Why are people still replying when he saw  and brushed it off? It's bait, he's not going to listen.  <br>There you go. Then you're not a criminal. Case closed.</br>  <br>Stop posting pics like this in my thread. It really bothers me.<br><br><br>I am just saying becoming a lolicon is a slippery slope.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Slippery slope to what? Your blogging? Man, that's a serious case indeed.</br>      <br><br/></br>  <br> being ashamed of being a lolicon <br>I can at least tell you this: only non-lolicons think like that.<br>Ergo you are baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Just like all those violent video games that are making the crime rate increase.</br>  <br><br><br>I said to stop posting loli<br><br><br>A slippery slope to becoming a stain on society. I don't want to be one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    What a roundabout way to ask for a loli thread.  <br>What a funny joke. If you cared about society, you wouldn't be coming here and blog about it.<br><br>Post more loli, guys.</br></br></br>      <br><br> one leg out <br> other at thigh <br><br>How does that even happen</br></br></br></br></br>  pedos  <br>By removing it from one leg and then lifting both legs up.</br>  <br>I think that getting caught was part of OP's plan.</br>  <br><br>It'd be more likely to catch on the knee wouldn't it?</br></br>  <br>It will drop down further if you lift it higher.</br>  Which is better loli pussy or cunny?  <br><br/></br>  I bet you perverts even want to tickle a little girl's tummy.    Post glasses loli please.  <br>Who cares. I don't like pedo or lolicon because of the implications of 3DPD and exclusivity, because I'm really just an overall pervert. Not gonna cry over being called one though. And you probably should have posted this in a loli related thread. This doesn't really seem worth having it's own thread.</br>    <br>Why is Akatsuki so fucking ugly?</br>  <br> is a slippery slope. <br>It certainly is, just like my dick a the moment.<br><br><br>Normies are the biggest stain on society and yet they are the majority. Who gives a fuck about what that scum thinks about you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Akatsuki <br> ugly <br><br>Your ugly.</br></br></br></br>  Why is that stomach so punchable?  <br>Maybe because Akatsuki is the most unattractive loli ever?</br>  <br> stop posting loli <br> on 4chan <br><br>now i'm gonna post twice as much</br></br></br></br>  <br> loli <br>I'll let you know she's a lady, not a loli.</br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is that she is shit? Yeah that seems right.</br>  <br> How do I stop being a little girl enthusiast? <br>By becoming a full-fledged lolicon.</br></br>      <br>Dont start posting elin you little shit</br>  <br>my bad, picking at random</br>        <br> Why is that tummy so ticklable? <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>This isn't how spats work but it's definitely how they should work.</br>  Curious to know, what is /a/'s thoughts on 3D CG lolis I mean, more'a'days now more 3DCG shows are popping up?<br>I'm talking about both the anime looking ones and more realistic looking ones, should they be banned? Do you support of free speech in that matter? Do you like it?</br>  <br>Why the hell should they be banned?<br>A well detailed 2D is always superior though.</br></br>  <br> the anime looking ones <br>They should not be banned.<br> more realistic looking ones <br>It's absurd to ban them because nobody gets hurt for creating them. I wouldn't mind if moralfags ban them, but then they'd have more leverage reason to ban unrealistic stuff too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe in your dick, OP. It's incapable of lying, and it's never been mistaken. Why would you doubt your dick?<br>And I just saw a Bane banner when appchan failed to load properly. When did we get new banners?</br></br>  <br>Banning is dumb, weeb-like styles &gt; realistic, but 2D is better anyways. That stuff that feels like it's in some sort of 2.5D is bretty gud tho.</br>  I like how lolis can still win here sometimes.  What is the best way to be a faggot  You guys are posting in a Pomf thread.  Perverts! Stop masturbating to me!  <br>Now I might be mistaken, but that looks like the face of someone who wants us masturbating to her.</br>  <br> that looks like the face of someone who wants us masturbating to her. <br><br>Die in a magazine fire.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I masturbate to Inazuma because you're fucking ugly.</br>  <br>They are cool... until you see motion.<br>Somehow the way their "breasts" or "nipples" move is like pudding or liquid. Too unrealistic.</br></br>  I'd rather snuggle a loli than fuck one tbh  <br>I know that feeling. <br>Ever since I was like 6 I was always trying to get girls to show me that pussy, then when I got into high school I tried to suppress it to fit in with what is supposed to be normal.<br>Only after I graduated did I accept the fact that I was fucked.<br><br>Thank you for reading my blog, please subscribe.</br></br></br></br></br>  You see a starving loli.

Ephe is a pretty normal attraction (aka highschool girls), just that most people wouldn't actually try anything.</br>  <br>You're hated for being a fucking pedophile. You don't belong here. Do you really not understand that?</br>  <br>"You're hated for being a fucking lolicon. You don't belong here.

Little children are not lolis. They are 3D. Lolis are 2D.<br><br>inb4 Loli is derived from Lolita<br><br>Matters not. Its different context. Black is derived from the word Blanc which is describing White. Black = White. Words change over time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hebephilia is by definition normal as girls in the Hebe range can reproduce. Sex and by extension attractions that result in reproduction are always natural and should always be legal.</br>  <br> it's natural so it's okay! <br>Let me guess, atheist?</br></br>  <br>It's just some /co/ or /v/ poster that clicked on this thread because of the lewd OP.</br>  <br>Lolis are 2d abstractions of 3d girls, if you weren't a complete normie you'd know just how similar they can be.</br>  Bla bla bla.<br>If you lust after real living kiddo's, seek fucking help.<br>Otherwise, you're fine.</br></br>  <br>The difference is negligible.<br><br> Words change over time. <br>I'm pretty sure that japs dont differentiate between 2D and 3D when they call someone a "lolicon" though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same anon but as long as a girl has curves it's perfectly fine to feel attracted, yes. Being in a relationship with said girl although you're older? Not really, maybe in some rare cases.<br><br>We're talking 2D here. I'm lolicon myself but I've never felt attracted to kids. It's just drawings.<br><br>And what does atheist have anything to do with that? If you believe in stupid shits it's your problem stop forcing it on others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey if impregnating a 12 year old girl is good enough for god it's good enough for me.</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure that japs dont differentiate between 2D and 3D when they call someone a "lolicon" though. <br>And that's fine, but he did mention context, and we're not japs.</br></br>  <br>  <br> Lolis are 2d abstractions of 3d girls, if you weren't a complete normie you'd know just how similar they can be. <br> muh abstractions <br><br><br>Normie japs don't differentiate. That's same with normie murricans as well. But in otaku circle, there is a clear difference between 2d and 3d.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No...its not normal. They are in EARLY stages of puberty, And its more dangerous to reproduce at that age. Hebe will always be looked at in a very very negative way.</br>  <br> Normie japs don't differentiate. That's same with normie murricans as well. But in otaku circle, there is a clear difference between 2d and 3d. <br>Interesting. You visit jap boards or something?</br></br>  <br>Why though? How is the age gap relevant ? The only thing that should matter is that it's consensual and that both parties are biologically ready.</br>  <br>Anon please, let that guy enjoy his fetishes in peace, they're okay as long as he doesn't go out in the street and starts doing things to real little girls.  proved that he's a pure person.<br>I'd rather have him (AND ALL OF YOU) keep the 3D talk out of here though.<br><br>Now post some fuckin loliships and be khorosho to each other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you type like the kids I jack off to?</br>  <br>No offense but have you already been in a relationship? The age gap will matter no matter how mature you think the girl is. If it's just a sex-based relationship then so be it, it's fine, but in most cases, thus a romantic relationship, it'll most likely end up badly and impact the girl's life negatively.</br>  <br>no .they dun type like tht. Dey type lke this u kno?</br>  <br>Hebephilia has been normal and accepted for pretty much all of human history up until the 1950s. And yes it's early puberty but they can still reproduce which they wouldn't be able to if they weren't biologically meant to be able to.</br>  <br>I want to be in Inazuma's position and just start molesting Ikazuchi all day.</br>  It's not even about being safely able to reproduce or not in the end, it's about sexual attraction. You can't control that, it's NATURAL. I bet you anything you want most people complaining about lolicons aren't fully honest with themselves. If you aren't able to fap/getting aroused to this  or  then you're simply a faggot.  <br>None of those negative psychological effects are intrinsic though, they're extrinsic. It's not really the relationship thats to blame it's the society that surrounds it. In a society that accepted such relationships (see anything not within the last 60-70 years) such problems do not arise.</br>  <br> Hebephilia has been normal and accepted for pretty much all of human history up until the 1950s <br><br>Barely accepted. Hebe goes from 11-14. Even around that age of consent was generally around 14-16.</br></br></br>  <br>What is normal and what is natural are two different things, normal is whatever furthers the existence of the human race, natural is anything that arises from genetics, unnatural is anything learned.</br>  Can't we just post and appreciate lolis?<br>After all, we all do love them, right?</br>  <br>My point is that age 11-18 is really important in a person's life / psychological development. If the partner of said girl is 10y older the relationship will be uneven and the chances of negatively impacting her are really high. Now I am not saying it's right or wrong, I was just advancing a point, thus why I said "not really, maybe in some cases" earlier.<br><br>I am speaking from experience.<br><br><br>Yes, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I hate that ugly shitskin.</br>  <br>For starters I meant to type 1940s secondly pretty much all premarital sex was shunned back then, what was more relevant were the lenient marriage laws. Pic related is from 1937.</br>    These little semen demons are the best thing to come out of Kancolle. I've lost track of how many times I've fapped to them.    <br>Yes. Sentiment is clearcut.</br>  <br>Your own negative experience are clearly coloring your views here. I'm still trying to find it but I remember reading a study that compared relationships between teenagers and relationships between teenagers and adults, the study found that there was no significant difference in internal strife or conflict in the relationships and that though the age gap relationships met with more external strife the younger partner rarely showed any signs of serious psychological scarring of anything else similar.</br>  When did /a/ become infested with lolicons?  <br>If you aren't a lolicon then you haven't been browsing /a/ long enough.</br>  <br>In 2003</br>  It's important that you cleanse the disgusting lolicon out of your body. <br><br>Here is a picture of best girl to help you.</br></br>  <br>Leave and take your shit taste with you.</br>  <br>Fuck you, how people don't see Nagato as best ship is beyond me. <br><br>Fucking faggot sack of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a fucking slut.</br>  <br>The boobie Kancolles are good, but the Kancollolis are the best.</br>  <br>Sorry anon I couldn't hear you over all of these delicious lolis.</br>  <br>If she's such a slut why has she never worked your dick?</br>   I am not a lolicon <br> posts a cover to a loli eromanga <br>It's time to come to terms, OP</br></br>  <br><br>The 4chan of my day didn't have lolicons, neckbeards, or pedos.</br></br>  I really don't understand why you all get so worked up about it whenever one of these threads is deleted; considering they're, in essence, identical to the many threads that are also image dumps focused on a certain fetish wherein the only real discussion is about, in this case, how much you want to fug a loli, the various sexual things you'd do with a loli, and joking around about taking loving care of a loli- totally nothing sexual involved  wink wink .<br>Whenever those other threads get deleted, no one really complains because it's like, no shit, they were image dumps with with inherently, and often literally, masturbatory discussion, not really a big surprise. But if a single loli thread gets deleted, oh, then suddenly the mods are on some sort of anti-loli crusade again, and then loli threads start popping up with much greater frequency because whoever makes these threads seems to think that the best way to rebel is to do the exact thing you were punished for about 5 times harder than before.<br><br>Like, I honestly don't have anything against lolicons and I'm ambivalent towards lolis as a whole, I just don't understand. Yeah, I know for some this is some sort of half-baked way of bringing back /l/, but that was years ago, and is having some space to post the same images repeatedly and jack each other off available 24/7 really all that important?</br></br></br>  <br> he hasn't been here since 2002 </br>  <br>That's what you get for being a time traveler and coming here from 2020.</br>  <br>Because I don't look at sluts.</br>  <br>It is just well drawn. Fapping to well drawn things means you appreciate 2D. If it has lolis in it then so be it, that doesn't make you a lolicon. <br><br>False flaggers are trying to equate being a little girl enthusiast with being a lolicon now?</br></br></br>  Lolicons are just pedos too beta to accept their feelings.  <br>What strange dimension are you from or are you sure you weren't trying to spell "reddit"?</br>  <br><br> Being sexually attracted to good art regardless of the content <br><br>There is probably a special circle in hell for you too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Many actually are. And some are just fetishists who enjoy a good fap.<br>We all love loli though. Through dick, unity.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much all men have at least some pedophilic tendencies, so it's not at all unusual to have people who are otherwise uninterested in little girls enjoy the idealized 2d version of it.</br>  <br>Only Ushio looks attractive.</br>  What the fuck happened here?  <br>Normies tried to pick a fight with lolicons.</br>  <br>Oh, okay.

I don't remember why I bought it and now I need to look for it.  <br><br>Sort of related, I would normally donate but I actually held out due to how shitty 3.0 was and how it fucked over Rei.<br><br>I'm sort of glad they didn't get to pollute the moon.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Delicious Canadian knife chocolate</br>    I never had an Eva merch folder before tonight, and now it's bigger than my Rei folder.      <br>Post the Kaworu one</br>  Official Dakimakura of Kaworu and Kaji. I don't think there's any official dakimakura of Rei or Asuka, but I might be wrong.  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, a bunch of feminists yelled at a Gears of War dev for having hat mousepad this week.<br><br>Best part is he literally had no clue who Asuka even is.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are actually super comfortable. They're also positioned perfectly.</br>   you will never own this   <br> Not the other way around <br>C'mon, son.</br></br>  <br>I know,   I bought one  </br>  <br> CliffyB <br>Not even once</br></br>  <br> inb4 asuka from evangelion <br><br>Does that faggot even know what inb4 means? Literally makes zero sense in his post.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Shinji have an official Daki?</br>  No one has yet to post my favorite shitty merch.  <br>No, only Kaji and Kaworu. Not even the girls have an official one.</br>  <br> tfw bought several <br>Importing the pillows got expensive.</br></br>    <br>Why the hell would you buy more than one?</br>  <br><br> They start to smell ugly after a while </br></br>  <br>Use shower and don't cum on them.</br>  <br>then wash it you troglodyte</br>      <br>I bought one of multiple characters. Kaworu and Kaji weren't the only ones they've done.<br><br>Wash it? Faggot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just got here.<br>I've got you covered.</br></br></br>  one of the top selling items on Eva store right now  <br>That looks so fucking messy holy shit.</br>  <br>the fuck even is it? fingernail clippers?</br>  <br>tweezers I think?</br>  <br>As far as I know, Khara has only officially released Kaworu and Kaji dakimakura. Where have you seen ones of other characters?</br>  <br><br>A brooch?</br></br>  <br>oh wait actually google translate says it's a tie bar.</br>  <br>That's not true, I jack off on my Kaworu one all the time and he smells good as new once I wash him.</br>   seen hundreds of anime and Eva is still my favourite <br> being reminded of all the ridiculous merch <br><br>I know that japs have less of a stigma against this sort of thing, but holy fuck. I'm absolutely crazy for Eva, and I still wouldn't even consider buying a fucking toaster or spoon set.</br></br></br>  <br>He means characters of other shows. He probably bought this one too.</br>  Fucking nips missed the whole point  Do people in Japan actually buy these? Is it a nation of autists?  <br> not toasting your bread in Ayanami </br>  <br>because of this for the longest time before I watched the show I thought Kaworu was actually an important character. I was so fucking confused that he was absent for the first 23 episodes</br>  <br> Is it a nation of autists? <br>It actually very much is</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's you that never got the point.</br>  I remember seeing that even Sachiel has a bit of merch but I can't find it  <br>They've actually got some pretty classy ties that hide your power level fairly well<br><br>I'd buy some if they weren't so damn expensive</br></br></br>  <br>They've got a number of designs, but I only saved these two</br>  <br>Same. After seeing him on every Eva poster and picture I assumed he was the second main character after Shinji. Almost as big of a mindfuck than the actual show.</br>  <br>I bought 3 sets of sake cups for whatever reason.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>I'm in the same boat, but I've resolved to get myself the best Rei Ayanami figure available once the franchise starts treating Rei with the respect the character deserves.</br>  <br> classy <br>Maybe if you're trying to rob a bank in Gotham by knocking out all the guards and clerks with laugh gas.</br></br>  <br>But does the toaster brand the bread with a logo? otherwise it just seems utterly pointless.</br>  <br> I bought one of multiple characters. <br>Gil? T&amp;B? Utapri?</br></br>  <br>What are those?</br>  <br> not peacocking </br>  <br>okay, if i had a kid I would buy this for them.</br>  <br/>  <br> Manju <br>It says what it is on the box.</br></br>  <br><br> Dewritos <br> Like Third Impact In Your Mouth <br><br><br>I love how the merch always has the five Children hanging out like best buds when they barely share screen time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The SBaHJ edits are the best</br>  <br> I love how the merch always has the five Children hanging out like best buds when they barely share screen time <br>I like it, they always look happy for once</br></br>  <br><br>It's not MSP but please tell me one of you has the card crusher edit</br></br>  <br>Sorry, meant other shows.

They found it buried in permafrost a long time before Sachiel showed up and stripped it down to the bones while experimenting on it. It finally broke loose at the start of the movie thanks to sabotage</br>  <br> Sorry anon, he's not my speed. <br>Faggot</br></br>  <br>I actually own one.<br><br>I'd use it but it's slow as shit compared to my iPhone so fuck it.</br></br></br>  I'm sure Anno likes the money but how does he feel about all these liberties taken with his "child" that is NGE.  <br>is it pretty in real life?</br>  <br>He's probably facepalming at this very moment, reminded that an entire nation missed the point of the series.</br>  <br>He probably doesn't give a shit.</br>  <br>Official merch has to be approved by the higher-ups, or so I've heard. So technically he's the one behind all of this.</br>  <br><br>You're both retarded if you think Anno gives a single shit.<br><br>Anno has raped his own franchise worse than merchandise ever did with Rebuild.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay.<br><br>Screen is nice, it's dustproof and splashproof I believe. Haven't tried it out.<br><br>The theme isn't as messy as you'd think since 90% of it is just for show.<br><br>Requires AT&amp;T I think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He hand approves every piece of merch they sell</br>  <br>source</br>  I fucking love Evangelion.  <br>in fact I hear he handcrafts all the merch himself<br><br>that's why it takes so long for them to release these rebuild movies</br></br></br>  <br> The name is written on the side <br> "I don't even know what character that is" </br></br>  <br>I'm jelly. I was looking into at least getting the OS onto my nexus 4 when I got it. I love me some high-density information.</br>  <br> All according to plan <br>That's how</br></br>  <br>Cliff Bazingsky is not the pinnacle of intelligence</br>  <br>Like I said it's nice but ultimately slow as fuck due to the fact it was released back in 2012. The 3D is pretty rad though I'll admit.<br><br>Get a NERV case for your Nexus and you should be good.<br><br>Also, if you want to buy it, Kyoex has it in stock.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure he has to approve most of it at some level so he clearly doesn't give a fuck<br>If an entire nation misses the point of his series and just wants to buy a Kaji body pillow then I can't really blame him for selling out</br></br>  <br>wasn't there a Magi system interface available to download from google play or something?</br>  <br>I supposed he's resigned himself to reckless abandon.</br>  <br>Maybe there still is, not sure. As I said the phone I use right now is an iPhone so I can't check.</br>  <br>Maybe he figures it all fits in as part of the plan. It's the proof for his thesis.</br>  <br>Which thesis?</br>  <br>dawwwwwwwww<br><br> A CRUEL ANGEL'S THESIS[/SPOILER] </br></br></br>  <br>This thesis:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fB1<wbr>r6-p7cGc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>THANK YOU HIDEAKI</br>  <br><br>Everything is as predicted by the Dead Sea Scrolls.</br></br>  <br>Well, I guess that explains why there's so much Kawoshin merchandise and none of my OTP ;_;</br>  <br>Anno is still an otaku at heart so he's not above shameless merchandising. He just wants to you wear your Eva shirt and shoes while using your Eva phone to talk to friends as you go outside for a hike.</br>  Wasn't there already a NERV phone?  <br>Which is your OTP? Just curious</br>  reminder that if you ship anyone in this show you are just as much of a faggot as someone who buys nge crocs  <br>He wants you to get Asuka and Kaworu T-shirts.</br>  <br> lance of longitude <br> longitude <br>are you serious?</br></br></br>    <br>  LAS ;_;  </br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;92992073 </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I usually don't visit evangaylion threads so I'm not up to date with all the latest memes the cool kids use here.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>Reminder that if it's canon it's not a ship</br>    <br>Her toes are also green and purple.</br>  <br>good thing none of them are canon</br>  <br>Growing up on Evageeks I always assumed LAS was super popular and everyone in Japan shipped it.

Is it all part of his plan?   <br>Enjoy</br>  <br>Anno is a huge otaku dude. The stuff he did that was actuallly liked by the mainstream isn't what he likes anime for.<br><br>People think EVA is anti-otaku but it's really, really pro-otaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Where were you when Evangelion became gay propaganda?</br>  <br> Asuka x Shinji <br>Never been defeated world champion</br></br>  <br>  Your crackship will never be canon, Evageeks.

Fanservice manga and games, everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, the Type:Magi one looks good...<br><br>I don't know for sure, but first, you will need to know what's the launcher's APK, the one that sources the NERV UI that's used.<br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/<wbr>details?id=com.ext.ui&amp;hl=en<br><br>This app might work, it claims it will work for system apps, so you might want to give it a try.<br>I'm looking online now to see if anyone tried this before, so I might save you the hassle.<br>If someone can port it, you might be able to get a better Android phone but still have the UI, the problem with Jap phones is that they are full of shitty useless apps, my little brother has one, and I fixed that by flashing an international ROM that's newer and lighter.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Doesn't anybody in Japan find it strange that a super serious anime like Eva is completely milked for everything it's worth with goofy products?  <br>the culture gap is truly incomprehensible</br>  <br>Shout-outs to all kinds of nerdy shit most people would miss<br><br> Shinji's ID card having the Enterprise's designation <br> Misato's Ghidorah rington <br> Unit 02's Inazuma Kick and now it has Yamato's horns <br> All those Nadia references in 2.0 and 3.0 <br> Jet Alone <br> The four Adams referencing Ultraman and the Ultra symbols on the floor in the 3.0 preview </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> super serious anime like Eva <br><br>The 90's were 20 years ago now. That's no longer the case.<br><br>"Super serious EVA" died when Anno himself decided to whore out the franchise and shit on characters like Rei just because he doesn't like them being popular.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he hasn't watched 3.0 <br><br>I can actually tolerate stuff like crummy spinoffs and whatnot, but Anno made that movie himself. There's no excuse for that.<br><br>Unless you're a lowbrow eva fan on the kaworu-fan level, you're better off dropping Evangelion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying gainax didn't whore out the series for the better part of a decade before khara came and reclaimed the IP by making a movie on it <br>Anno is just maintaining the status quo really</br></br>  <br>Then why are you still here, anon-kun?</br>  <br>Damn gay piano angel is /fa/ as fuck</br>  <br>SEELE picks out his outfits for him.</br>  <br>Fruity.</br>  <br>A high-budget, high-profile movie is where it starts getting bad. Any franchise that's popular will get merchandise. There's nothing wrong with a bucket with a NERV logo on it or a figure of Shinji or Rei. <br><br>But when you start producing mainline huge productions like Rebuild and after we're nearly done it's all about shipping and other otaku nonsense, that's when things have gone too far.</br></br></br>      <br>why is the first post always right</br>  <br>"Super Serious Eva" was capped off with a radio play produced by Anno that poked fun at the whole thing. It only lost the funny parts in the last half and the merchandise and spin-offs have always been pretty silly</br>  I wanna be inside Rei.  <br>you can't comment on yet definitively until it's done, you never know<br>do I have high hopes? fuck no I don't</br></br>  <br>I told you those things had shit-eating grins.</br>  <br>3.0 is the 25 and 26 of the rebuilds. 1.0+3.0 will make it make sense in retrospect.</br>  <br>Are you implying my waifu is shit, Carlos?</br>  <br>That's dumb. Don't ever say that again.</br>  <br>A radio play is just fun. It doesn't take itself seriously.<br><br><br>Rebuild is closing on ten years now. <br><br>Rebuild will soon have existed for as long as NGE+End of Evangelion has for the fanbase before there was Rebuild of Evangelion.<br><br>1997-2007 for NGE<br><br>2007-2017 (Anno is doing Godzilla in 2016. No time for Rebuild)<br><br>It's been eight years now. We can comment. We can see what it's done to the franchise and fanbase. It's not good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   no Eva toilet yet <br> no Eva toaster <br> no Eva condoms <br> no Eva nail clippers <br><br>Come on, Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> taking your chinese cartoons this seriously <br>You couldn't have missed the point of Eva harder if you tried.</br></br>  <br>How?<br><br>There's nothing in 3.0 that has it's equivalent in NGE, because NGE doesn't have a 14-year old timeskip nor does it attack it's own characters in a metafictional way, nor does it abandon character development or development to advertise a character.<br><br>There's nothing 1.0+3.0 can do to make that mess work out unless it attacks current Rebuild in a completely fair and honest way, something you will never get from a studio like Khara.<br><br>What do you think can make up for it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That or Khara will make some kind of interlude or spin-off covering the 14 year gap that will provide some much-needed context. They hired animators for some Eva project but who knows if that's 3.0+1.0 since Anno's off to play with Godziller soon.</br>  <br> dumb reply- the post </br>  Aw man, this thread is reminding me of all the great, silly stuff that was sold on Gainax's General Products store before it shut down and all the Eva merch moved to Khara.<br>I still want this thing.<br>It's 800mm long.</br></br>  <br>Hoping for this. An OVA or short TV-series detailing the timeskip would be great.</br>      <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA <br><br>no<br><br>It'll never make sense because 3.0 was so bad and occupied with pandering to dumbass Kaworufags and Asukafags there's literally no way to justiy it. You will need to add extreme asspulls like having Shinji emit some sort of anti-IQ field that makes people dumber, or rewrite him as a cosmic villain of sorts.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>You're the reason they're able to produce dumb stories with no meaning and just pandering.<br><br>Why would you even want a shitty timeskip series?</br></br></br></br>    <br> some sort of anti-IQ field that makes people dumber <br>fucking lol</br></br>     Evangelion vegetable juice <br>Would you drink you're waifu, /a/?</br>  You could cosplay as one of the NERV bridge staff.  Or even a NERV janitor.   you will never put all the people who liked 3.0 into an internment camp and gas them thirty at a time <br>Feels bad man.</br>      <br>Me too. I really want to see what the hell happened right after 2.0. There was some crazy shit in the script and storyboards at the end.<br><br> Tokyo-3 is destroyed and abandoned, the Geofront has become a lake with Unit 01 speared and sealed on the surface <br> Nerv staff imprisoned <br> A missing scene with a register of names on a chained door <br> Mark.06 goes spelunking in Terminal Dogma <br> Unit 08 <br> Four Reis running around meeting with Kaworu <br><br>Unit 08 clearly became Eva 13, so I'm wondering if Mari wasn't supposed to originally get the missing Unit 07</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Because I want to see what happened in the missing time period, dipshit.</br>  <br>I don't see the point since the outcome is 3.0 anyways, it's a complete waste of time.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><br>any security guard?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, never mind, seems like someone already did that.<br>Thanks for the attention anyway, hope I didn't waste your time that much.<br>Seems like porting it is not that easy.<br>http://forum.xda-developers.com/sho<wbr>wthread.php?t=2290194</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I just want to know what that whole thing behind the purple eyed Reis was. Also what happened to Kaji and why Misato is so bitchy. A lot of side characters were sidelined in Rebuild, and an OVA/TV series would be a great way at fleshing them out.</br>  I would buy every single item on the thread if I could.   Forgive me Anno.    <br>Needs an 02 variation so I snowboard in it</br>  <br>Why would you want to see that? Are you dumb or something?</br>      <br> You will never live your life purely on Evangelion branded merchandise.  <br><br>Is there some form of Eva home? It's the only necessity I can think of that I haven't seen branded.</br></br></br>  <br><br> actually wanting to see the time in-between <br><br>Did you watch 3.0? The characters end up shallow, retarded and pure fanservice. You can't add shit inbetween to fix that, it's like shoving butter on top of a fatty cake made of crap.<br><br>There's nothing that could have happened to make them this way, it's just a product of 3.0's poor writing and shitty plot. All you'll get is fanservice and that's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   go bowling with the Eva characters   <br>You can go live at the Eva exhibit at Fuji-land park like a homeless person.</br>  <br>Oh nah it's fine, I was looking into it but still had other things I needed to take care of, so I didn't start anything.<br><br>I think there's a few fanmade themes if that counts for anything.</br></br></br>    <br> few fanmade themes <br> from XDA <br>Most will be shit I bet.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alternatively you can buy an official Eva tent and live in their. Use the Eva buckets as your personal mobile toliet.</br></br>  <br> Cue ragtime version of main theme </br>      <br>They have a baseball collection too</br>  <br>Is there a faster way of nonverbally telling people you're a cockloving boyslut?</br>  <br> this will never be a spin-off SoL </br>  <br>Can you post a screenshot of the homepage? Does the UI look like the advertised pictures or is the real thing uglier?</br>  There is one official merch portrait where asuka is dressed like a nazi officer (Part of a colection of military uniforms, Mari was a redcoat and everyone else was WW2 Jap), posted it a few times but I don't have it with me right now  <br>Yes, the DSS bondage and gag set: the new plot device Anno will introduce in 3.0+1.0</br>  <br> The one place where you can be happy that it all comes tumbling down tumbling down </br>    What's the biggest asspull that you've seen in anime?  No one actually dying at the end of A/Z S1  Mai Hime ending  Didn't really feel like it was necessary for his revenge. His training didn't really insinuate that he could pull this off and he seemed angry enough to beat Pitou without it. <br><br>I feel like this was written in just to keep things interesting and going by how boring this arc had gotten, I can't blame the author.</br></br>  <br>Besides the end of Evangelion? <br>Well the End of Evangelion.<br>and then the Reboot of Evangelion</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still mad.</br>  <br>Ok granted I havent seen the show but a friend told me the ending to Clannad AS and I'm not sure if he explained it badly or what cause it sounded like the dumbest shit ever<br><br>Also even if I know the end is clannad worth watching</br></br></br>  <br>I dropped it an episode or two into AS. If anything AS does the rest of the story a disservice.</br>  <br>It's not an asspull. Your friend is dumb and wasn't paying attention. Yes, it's worth watching.</br>  The hacking in Zankyou no terror. They go under the assumption that the site has been hacked before because it's very secure at the moment, and find a 404 php shell that was left by the hacker who did it initially.  Lelouch Geassing god or whatever the fuck that tower thing was.  <br>Watch it</br>  <br>More like all of ZnT is a gigantic asspull.</br>  <br>I dropped it when this happened, gave me a good laugh at least</br>  The gorilla that's in the objectively shitty series that's called Samurai Flemenco.  <br>An asspull that not only managed to ruin one series, but TWO at the same time!</br>  <br>Should I actually watch it? I got 7 eps into the first Clannad and it was about that ghost girl Fuko or something, I dropped it at that point cause I found it so boring - if you still think I'd like AS I might give it another go</br>  <br>Probably this. I at least expected Hime to die.</br>  This faggot every chapter.<br><br> yeah i forgot to use "THAT" </br></br>  <br>If you didn't like it, don't watch it. AS is different in tone though.</br>  In Naruto when Pain brings everyone back to life. I was done with that shit after that.  <br>Baccano!'s ending. Fucking that was annoying. <br><br><br>Also What happened to faldio? In Valkyria Chronicles, He just disappeared and one one cared. I beat the games so I do know what happened, But in the anime's ending was fucking rushed. Faldio just died, and people didn't even blink a eye.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i actually forgot about that, this might be the biggest one yet</br>  <br>Michiko &amp; Hatchin End, just another single mother loser.</br>  <br>First season is a pretty solid romance/SOL series. Season 2 is practically a soap opera with all the melodrama it throws at you, and it completely ignores earlier character development to make most of that drama happen. But 10/10 Nagisa and Ushio die and come back best drama ever XD.</br>  <br><br> Didn't really feel like it was necessary for his revenge. <br><br>That's the entire point. He didn't need to give his live to beat Pitou but he did anyway cause he's just that crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Newtypes.</br>  Here's your new thread.<br> Still no news on vol.11 ch.2 </br>  <br>What's contrived about it? There are very clear rational processes behind the steps he takes with Yui, the honey toast dialogue and the pre-valentine's reminder being prime examples. 8man's justifying his interactions with Yui through logic, rather than emotion.<br><br>If I wanted to get into chekhov's gun I'd just bring up Sensei's dialogue. Also your argument about red herring has no basis, as 8man has similar reactions to multiple characters.</br></br></br>  <br> willing to reciprocate <br><br>Exactly</br></br></br>  <br> busting a guy's skull in on virtue of nothing but the idea that he might date Yui <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br> Hachiman was forced into the Service Club to change/become a better, more sociable person <br> Yukino constantly harps on Hachiman how he needs to change for his own good <br> Yukino and Hachiman are constantly clashing with their ideals <br> Hachiman changes (mostly for Yukino's sake/trying to live up to her ideals) <br> Hachiman's influence on Yukino is now also making her change as a person too <br> Yukino hasn't done a thing </br></br></br></br></br></br>  You guys are a bunch of waifu fags. This story, like haganai, was never meant to have much emphasis on romance. It is a story about friendship and finding one's true self. It is a story about the struggle to break apart from the shallow relationships that are often found in life and achieving a genuine, non-romantic relationship.
