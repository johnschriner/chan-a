What is this anime ever about.  <br>We need figures. One good thing about an anime adaptation. You get figures produced.</br>  <br> figures <br>I would take a Nendo or two just for adorable Skeleton and Crazytits.</br></br>  What's she gonna use it for? I'm not really using it, but...  <br>http://bato.to/read/_/314789/overlo<wbr>rd_ch5_by_ak-scanlations/20</wbr></br>  <br>this and i would buy best maid too</br>  <br>inb4 Pleiades collection babyyyy</br>  <br>It was worse in the manga version. Shame, too, since it was so well-described in the novel.</br>  <br> meant to quote this guy  <br>embarrassing.</br></br>  <br>You're right, I would totally buy best maid.</br>  <br> Pleiades collection <br>yes please</br></br>  <br> Square milk jug <br>Every fucking time America, never change.</br></br>  <br> “Be it cleaning, laundry or sewing skills, I am at the level of professionals.” <br> Pleased to see the shocked expression of Demiurge, Albedo boasted delightfully: <br> “For the child that might be born in the future, I had made clothes and socks. All the way till 5 years old.” </br></br></br>  <br> square <br>are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Yeah the descriptions were awesome, i thought the studio would do them justice<br><br>They just CGI'd the manga DK and it looked plastic as fuck<br><br>They could at least improve the textures</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you even tell from that? But square milk jugs save space when putting a bunch of them in a crate.</br>  Is it bad that I dropped overlord first episode in because of the whole stupid dive MMO plot?   wasting a 5th and 9th level spell slot on 3HD City Guard instead of using Color Spray to down both. <br><br>Ains can not into Wizard powergaming. I guess it doesn't really matter when you can craft Pearls of Power.</br></br>  <br>Unless you absolutely despise that sort of story and can't enjoy it whatsoever, yes. Should have watched the first episode entirely before making a decision at the minimum.</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>"wasting"<br><br>He could probably cast that spell all day without his mana going down</br></br></br>  <br>Considering how overused it is recently, I wouldn't call you stupid for doing so.<br><br>However it seems like it may simply serve as a launching point. Whether where it ends up going is actually any good remains to be seen. It's honestly moving kind of slow.</br></br></br>  <br>FAKE<br>TITS</br></br>  <br>Or he could just retreat to his Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion and rest.</br>  <br>I did watch the first episode in it's entirety before making the decision to drop it due to the dive MMO. <br><br><br>Eh, I might read the manga and decide if I wanna go further with the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lowest level Maid <br> could still fuck up anyone she sees <br>a true Sniper with an actual gun is an OCP for a medieval culture</br></br></br>  <br>You should consider reading 2 volumes of the novel and decide after that. The manga really doesn't do justice to overlord.</br>  <br>Wow, Funi's 720p is even worse than I thought.</br>  <br><br><br>He's level 100. He doesn't even need to waste a spell slot when a wack from the Skeltal Staff would autohit on a 1.</br></br></br>   all these people saying they dropped it because it's another "mmo anime" <br>it's getting to the point where i cant figure out who's baiting and who is just taking second hand information to heart</br>  <br><br>He's got what, like fifteen minutes of straight casting 9th/10th level spells until he runs out of mana for the day? Might as well just cast Ray of Enfeeblement a few times and whack them with his staff.</br></br>   What will madhouse do to vomit-chan when she vomits? <br>I may discover my new fetish</br>  <br> Using the motherfucking guild staff to whack shit <br><br>Are you crazy?</br></br></br>  <br> hoarding almost 800 spells and not having room for a ass ripping attack <br>The fuck's wrong with you? Grasp Heart is hardly a waste.</br></br>  <br>No, just boneheaded</br>  Episode 3 saved this series for me.  <br>That's a good thing. Flat is best for vampire loli.</br>  <br>I'd give her my D that's for sure</br>  <br>First he had to use his good instant death spell because he didn't know how NPCs worked. Some random knight could be a level 100 warrior for all he knew.<br><br>Then he picked a level 5 spell, which I agree was still too high, but Ainz is obviously risk averse.</br></br></br>  <br>He had no way of figuring out how strong they were excepting by trying to see what killed them.</br>  <br>No, I don't want our souls to let go.</br>  Grasp Heart is a Save or Die, and a Save and suck.<br>you fail the save and instantly die, but you pass and you take massive damage and are stunned.<br>there's a reason that it's Ainz favorite spell.</br></br>  <br>I want to commit a cirme.</br>  Didn't albedo have a sister?<br><br>I'm talking about the "real"most powerful guardian.<br>The Secret guardian and the MC's personal bodyguard<br><br>You know the one all the other guardians are terrified of</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is amazing.<br>This is literally the greatest power fantasy that I've ever experienced.<br>WORSHIP ME</br></br>  <br>Albedo a cute.<br><br>I'm an animefag but want more, is the manga or light novel better?</br></br></br>  <br> sullying the guild staff </br>  <br> rocks a sexy practical armor <br>That's Anime original, her actual armour is extremely bulky and completely conceals her figure.<br><br><br>This studio really keeps letting us down with the adaptation. I mean where was the fear in the faces of the sisters and villages. They were suppose to be literally cowering, while pissing themselves. There faces barely had any expressions.</br></br></br></br></br>  I heard something about martial users what are those?   Albedo's sexy armor that's completely covering her <br>That was nice. REALLY nice.</br>  <br>Guilds only have 700 character levels to make their guardians with, so everybody's pretty much accounted for.</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>But people are not terrified of her because she is strong, but because she was made as a horror. Like, horror movie-kind horror.<br>Momonga says he freaked out first time he saw her.</br></br></br>  <br>Mang, the LN made my imagination go full throttle.<br>I didn't sleep for 2 days just because I enjoyed it that much.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, except Finger of Death is a Fort save. Most SoD or SoS spells are Fort saves which is bad as Fort is usually the highest save a monster will have. Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield.</br>  <br>Basically melee skills.</br>    <br>If you enjoy the anime you will likely enjoy the LNs too. They're very close to the anime but LNs have some more details.</br>  <br>Yeah basically <br>you'll see next episode I'm sure.</br></br>  <br>Rubedo and Nigredo are different characters</br>  <br>MC's personal bodyguard?<br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>They're supposedly something that didn't exist in the game. If you're reading 'The New Gate', you can liken it to the 'Arts' from the series. Also martial arts don't use mana they use something else. Ainz is curious about them but they're pointlessly weak.</br>  That knight scene was more brutal than I was expecting from this kind of anime  <br>What kind of anime were you expecting?</br>  <br>Not genuine.</br>  <br>She has 2 sisters, the one with sensory magic that's kept in the prison area on the ice level and the other which hasn't properly been introduced only mentioned. Neither are the most powerful or anything like that. <br>MC doesn't have a personal bodyguard, he has the Guardians and the Maids (Unless you count NPCs he created but PA isn't really a combatant).</br></br>  <br>Most anime kind of cut away at the critical moments, you know? But I guess these guys are hardcore.</br>  <br>Turns out nips hate money Jews<br>Who knew</br></br>  <br>It was toned down compared to the LN, it was done from the Knights perspective and they were seriously scared shitless (The gore and the fact they couldn't even hurt it wasn't the only scary things, everyone killed with the sword becomes a zombie and starts attacking as well). The studio sucks at expressions as well either that or they're trying to make it teen-friendly.</br>  <br><br> Sucks  that she's  dead  hopefully they  bring  her  back .</br></br>  <br>Don't tax evade anon.</br>  <br>Isn't rubedo supposed to be the strongest?</br>  <br><br>Thanks guys, reading the prologue now. Going to try the first part of vol1 ch1 tonight before bed. Cant wait to get off.</br></br>  <br><br>So he is building a country full of these guys?<br>Or at least a country where these techniques are actively taught?</br></br></br>  <br>nah. Albedo is a bit too rapey. But once Aura Bella Fiora, the reverse trap dark elf girl, grows up,she would be worth siring an heir with.</br>  <br>Read volume 1 of the light novels after seeing the first 2 episodes. Thia shit is fucking golden.</br>  <br><br>Well the author certainly gave her death. It's a pity I really liked her rivalry with Albedo. Anyone know if she was brought back after all?</br></br>  <br>She's already 76 though.<br><br>When does puberty happen</br></br></br>  <br>chair forever.</br>  <br>She's 7-8 in relative human terms so maybe another 30-40 years.</br>  <br>Martial Arts did not exist in the game, they only exist in the new world, Nazarick residents have no idea what they are or how they work. Ainz ordered some people to capture martial art users and wants them studied/researched. He wants to see if the arts can increase Nazaricks strength. But basically the arts and their users are too weak by Nazarick standards to have any real value.</br>  <br>Clarify I have no fucking idea what that means.</br>  Reminder that in Japan, Bitch = Slut so in universe canonically Albedo would probably have been polishing everyone's spears.  I heard there's a regular demon lord in this world.<br>If he were to be compared to the Guardians what level would he be? And does he swear loyalty to the overlord?</br>  <br><br> she dislikes humans </br></br>  <br>you wouldnt need to remind anyone if they stopped watching horribly translated funi rips</br>  <br>So what you read part way through volume three then just stopped? Finish it off then you'll have your answer.<br> Ainz can freely revive people (via consumable item (which he has a hundred or more of)) and Nazarick members (Nazarick revival system, cost shitloads of gold). There's also probably revival magic as well.  </br></br>  <br>humans are nothing more than skeletons in hiding</br>  <br>Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that?</br>  <br><br>You caught me, I literally just finished that chapter before I posted &gt;&gt;  I'll finish the volume tonite.</br></br>   You will never slay these monsters and their eldritch master.     <br> Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that? <br>Dude how can I? There was no context unless it's a new thing which just means I've been neglecting /a/ a little too much.</br></br>  <br>Who the heck is Rubedo? She's never even mentioned from vol 1-5.</br>  <br>The majority of Nazarick residents dislike/hate/despise or otherwise look down on humans. There's probably multiple factors that contributed to it; their races (except for elf twins none are human or demi-human), Guild rule that only heteromorphic races can join, evil alignment, character setting and finally the fact that while it was still a game humans/demi-humans are probably the main groups that attacked the guild (and died doing so). Anyway they have every right to look down on them, in-game human/demi-humans had inferior stats to heteromorphic races and the guild was a top-tier guild that had one of the best players as a member (Touch Me is a world class player).</br>  <br>in Vol 7 I think</br>  <br> Touch Me is a world class player <br>That name never fails to crack me up. It's as juvenile as a Gnome named Parts with the Private title.</br></br>  <br>Becoming a chair normally results in being sat on. Get up to date with the latest LN translations. Also lurk more, fanart of the exact scene has been posted multiple times.<br><br><br>She did though, although it was brief and her name wasn't said she was only referred to. Re-read Albedo's conversation with her sister in volume three.</br></br></br></br>  Animefag here, did Ainz develop one of the guardians?  <br>Yes, but he hasn't been introduced yet.</br>  <br>Pandora's Actor, the Doppelnazi</br>  <br>Touch Me has a wife daughter and is a collage prof. on top of being the world champion for the Melee classes and all around good guy.</br>  does papa bones ever meet a worthy foe?  How competent is the TL for the Overlord manga? Because /ak/'s editing sure as hell isn't any good.  <br>At the end of this season. Then it'll be a while again.</br>  I wouldn't because she hates lower life forms and will obliterate my ass for just looking at her  <br>  Successful in life <br>  OP as fuck in game <br>Can he be more based ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  Is there an epub or pdf version floating around for volumes 3-5? Did a cursory Google search and didn't find any results.  <br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Pandora%27s_Actor<br><br><br>Yes.  Shalltear <br>Aside from that there are yet to be encountered (as of the translated volumes) strong characters (dragon lords and stuff) and the chance of meeting other players or NPCs in future.<br><br><br>It's fine. But if you haven't read the LN first then start with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Is there a group that's still taking the subs and muxing them into rips that aren't Funi garbage?  What race was Touch Me? I know he was Inhuman but was he an elf or something?  <br>I'm guessing you're referring to Spinel, Albedo's little sister? Where did the name Rubedo come from?</br>  <br><br>that name gets funnier the more i see it</br></br>  <br> pointlessly weak <br> bitch is over 50 levels lower than you <br> you are as strong as Kid Captain in melee <br> Kid Captain can tank crazy mode Shalltear no problem despite being vastly outleveled <br> Skill can tank any physical hit you dish out so long as she uses her block skill first <br><br>It's amazing. Martial Arts is the one thing that will allow Certain Death and future Brain to fuck with Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here; https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br><br>Does someone want to make an OP template, so we can reduce the repeated questions every thread?<br><br><br>My mistake. Just look at the wiki, moonfags have been working on it<br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Rubedo</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I didn't even think to check Mega actually. Knew I should have instead of /r/'ing.</br>  <br>Source on the college prof part.</br>  <br>The Demon God they'll talk about later is on par or weaker than a level 7 summoned angel. Which means it's leagues below Ainz level. Of course this all assumes Nigan knows what the hell he's talking about.</br>  <br>That's super dangerous, to ever trust Nigan's words. That retard thinks a WC item is worth less than his dumb angel.</br>  <br>I don't think its ever said what race he is. Some assume it's the same race as Sebas, namely a dragonoid.</br>    <br>your hours late ;_;</br>  <br> thatsthejoke.gif </br>  <br>must have been one of this threads as I can no longer find it.<br>that said World Break: Attacks target by slashing the space.

I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost. It’s even better because even mangaonlyfag can enjoy this because everything is changed in a good way and they make it new.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come because In the end,</br>  <br>The only harem that was ever AOTS was Bakemonogatari.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Hare+Guu <br> good </br></br>  <br> not posting the official, objective version <br> instead posting the pretentious version </br></br>  <br>evidence of /a/'s shit taste at the time</br>  <br> Bakemonogatari <br> AOTY </br></br>  <br> thinking well written shows that took actual talent to make being AOTY is pretentious  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> check chart <br> are there any Yuasa anime <br> yes <br>It's pretentious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>where? reddit?</br>  <br> talks about pretentiousness <br> posts a chart that has Paranoia Agent on it </br></br>  It'll probably be One Punch Man but seeing as how that hasn't yet aired I will withhold my opinion.  <br> Kekkai <br>Will it be actually finished before 2015 is over?</br></br>  <br> well written shows that took actual talent <br> Madoka <br> Hyouka <br> Shirobako <br><br>Those shows fit the bill perfectly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best AOTY list I ever saw on /a/</br>  <br>I'll defend Ping Pong as AOTY 2014<br><br>or die trying</br></br></br>  <br>How is Yuasa pretentious?

In fact I'd say it has the most realistic art style of any anime in the past 2 years. You don't see anime like Ping Pong everyday. If you had any sense you would know it was a creative choice to keep Ping Pong's art style like that to make the characters look real and believable but add a sense of artistry to it.</br></br></br>  <br> Art &gt; Animation &gt; Characters &gt; Plot <br>So I guess you liked Shitgatsu too?</br></br>  <br> runner up 2015 <br> hibike </br></br>  <br> Ping Pong has top tier art direction <br>I could draw better by sticking a pen up my ass and writing with my ass.</br></br>  <br>Winter and Summer been shit, still have hope for Fall, but so far the only posible candidates are Etotama or Kekkai Sensen.</br>  <br>You should put more effort in your shitpost.</br>  <br>I disagree. An anime with superb art and animation will still be shit if the characters and plot are badly written, whereas a well-written anime with good characters can captivate me enough to overlook subpar art/animation.</br>  Am I the only one who feels like the general quality of AOTY contenders have dropped since 2010 or 2011?  <br><br>It's true. Hibike is super boring, it's like Glasslip but with an extra layer of polish.</br></br>  <br> . Ping Pong is a walking sportsshonen/battleshonen cliche. <br><br>Nope, it's the most accurate depiction of sports competition with respect to the game and more importantly its players and the struggles they go through as athletes, friends, rivals, and humans. I'd say it's the best sports anime since Slam Dunk. Inoue is the Yuasa of manga.</br></br></br>  <br> quality <br>Feels more like quantity. There's less and less anime that I would consider even good.</br></br>  Nice, another shitpost thread.  <br>Care to give an example? I'm interested in what you consider subpar art vs good art.</br>  <br> idiots who don't realize Ping Pong's art style was done on purpose </br>  <br>If the characters are shit no amount of good animation will save it from being shit<br>See SAO</br></br>  <br>I will agree with this, but only due to the fact that this year has been pretty shit overall and there hasn't been anything I liked more. In a better year it wouldn't even be a contender.</br>  <br> using an image where the calque does not even fit the teamplate <br>Nobody can take you seriously.</br></br>  <br><br>SAO didn't even have good animation.</br></br>  <br>SAO doesn't have good animation, much less good art direction.</br>  <br> it's the most accurate depiction of sports competition with respect to the game and more importantly its players and the struggles they go through as athletes, friends, rivals, and humans. <br>This.<br><br> When I was getting into CARD GAMEZ competitively, the show helped me put into perspective a lot of things. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibike is like Glasslip <br>You're not even trying</br></br>  If sequels don't count then  Koufuku Graffiti .  <br><br>Hibike wasn't even AOTS. <br><br> Kiniro Mosaic <br> Punch Line <br> Yamada <br><br>Even Yahari was better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quality has gone down and quantity has gone up. This is the biggest problem with the industry and at the rate it's going Anime will collapse sooner than later. We need to stop all the pandering, cheap shilling of industry names, and reduce all the adaptations especially the fucking LN ones since LNs are just a horrible medium meant to target a particular audience and make a quick buck. We need to have more original anime.</br>  <br>I haven't seen it, but it doesn't look particularly interesting to me.</br>   2014 had Ping Pong, Barakamon and Shirobako <br> 2015 has fucking nothing <br>Why is this year so bad?</br></br>  <br><br>If KyoAni did Glasslip you guys would be all over it saying it's the best anime ever.</br></br>  <br> anime is dying <br><br>I love this meme.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime will collapse sooner than later <br>Good. From the ashes will rise a new anime industry to get their shit together.<br><br>Or Japan sinks.<br><br>One of those.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Binan Koukou anyone  <br> super boring <br><br>This means precisely nothing</br></br></br>  Someone tried to tell me Gate was the must watch anime of the season.<br><br>This either means he's full of shit or this season is just that bad.</br></br>  <br>It's true though. Financially it's fine for the time being, but you can't argue that the quality is going down. Anime is less of an art form nowadays and more of a poorly adapted commercial meant to promote something else which is used to make money which leads to more merchandise and creates a franchise. Anime is dying in a figurative sense and somewhere down the line, maybe 15-20 years from now the pandering might not work anymore and people will stop buying late night anime. Who knows?</br>  YOU LIE IN APRIL is AOTY  <br>The industry is just preparing their big guns for 2016, right?</br>  <br><br>Literally nothing wrong with Gate.</br></br>  <br> Actually responding to an obvious bait. <br>How long have you been here? One month?</br></br>  <br>Wait for Lupin.</br>  <br>Where the fuck did you read that recommendation, imgur?</br>  <br>This season is one of the worst seasons in some long time.</br>  <br> nowadays and more of a poorly adapted commercial meant to promote something else which is used to make money which leads to more merchandise and creates a franchise <br><br>Anime has always been like that you big dummy.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty disappointing season. Sure there's a lot of watchable shows, but I don't think a single show will be remembered in the long run or be a potential AOTY.</br>  <br>Paranoia agent is good.</br>  <br> Charlotte </br>  <br>People like this faggot are killing anime</br>  <br>It would be one of the worst if you were a faggot.<br><br>I'm not so it's one of the best. Lots of MANime going around. No faggots allowed.</br></br></br>  <br>There's certainly nothing right with it. That's for sure. Two episodes in and a few spoilers tells me it's Japanese propaganda with boring self insert who gets a harem. <br><br><br> irl friend. I'm growing to dislike him more and more. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Jun Maeda <br>At best it'll be remembered as forced dramashit, just like Angel Beats.</br></br>  <br> show will be remembered in the long run or be a potential AOTY <br>Umaru-chan<br>NNB</br></br></br>  <br> What's your 2015 AOTY so far? <br>Non Non Biyori.</br></br>  <br> I don't think a single show will be remembered in the long run <br>You haven't seen what Gate can do once it reaches the Japan arc.</br></br>  <br>All the new shows airing this season are fucking horrible.</br>  <br> Umaru-chan <br>Meme show<br><br> NNB <br>Touché, but it's a sequel so its popularity is already established.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He already said that he learned from Angel Beats.

I'm someone who doesn't like to watch boring shit and dropped Gate. You got me.</br>  <br> Two episodes in and a few spoilers <br>Let me guess it's when the internet told you Japan beat US, Russia, and China together right? Stop going to that website it's not true.</br></br>  <br>That too yeah, but even the new Mushishi felt lacking, which had all the prospects of being just as good as the first. I admit I've only seen 9 episodes, but it seems to me like it has a much lower budget than the first season. The scenery porn scenes have been very few and far between, and the amount of character closeups with a simple gradient colored background is frankly ridiculous. <br>Even the music, which is still composed by Masuda Toshio and sounds just like Mushishi, hasn't really grabbed me. I know it's just one example, but this example disheartens me particularly because Mushishi was just so fucking good, and we had to wait almost 10 years for another season.</br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br>American Pile of anime<br>Garbage show</br></br></br>  <br>Charlotte and NNB are good, the other ones are shit adaptions and LN trash.

He has a very laid back attitude and never wanted to be a solider, his original plan was to be a (historian/otaku).<br> But right now it's doing a pretty poor job of pulling me in. <br>Because you weren't watching LOTGH weekly you retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Shitrobako was mediocre hipstershit though.</br>  LOGH is almost as pretentious as Yuasa.

The most sophisticated anime ever created, a tour de force, the pièce de résistance of animation! LoGH is little more than plebeian dreck in comparison, the creators wishing they could have produced an anime with even an inkling of the genius contained within Our Holy K-ON. From the profound debates about eating cake, to the highly philosophical discussions about procrastination, to the marvellous musicianship exhibited by the Light Music Club, K-ON has established itself as the greatest intellectual anime. You cannot disagree unless you are a terrible person. Seriously. It's an infallible law of the universe. K-ON is a masterpiece. And we all know that K-ON has the superior tea scenes.<br><br>"A phenomenal chef-d'oeuvre. My fifteen years of work on Evangelion now feel trivial by comparison." — Anno Hideaki, esteemed anime director<br><br>"During a time of struggle, K-ON's beautiful story provided the influence needed for me to become an ideal president. I am now a better man." — Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States<br><br>"I am an uncultured lowborn with pedestrian tastes in anime." — Anonymous plebeian, speaking in reflection of his love for LoGH</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Full Metal Panic <br> good <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>   shokugeki no souma is AOTY   <br> muh overrated food manga <br> muh overrated porn artist designs <br> muh jshit staff low budget adaptation <br><br>It's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  2015 has been awful so far. Hibike is literally the best thing so far, and that's sad.  <br><br>YOU'RE SHIT</br></br>   anime has to look good to be considered good <br>Hate this meme.</br>  <br><br>Generally think these are okay lists, but AOTY for 2013 and 2015 should be  Kinmosa .<br> Not even kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>Pleiades</br>  How do you beat 2003?  <br> Hibike is literally the best thing so far, </br>    No plastic Memories <br><br>Why /a/ ?</br></br>  <br>1/10</br>  <br>It was bad.</br>  <br>By being 2007.</br>  <br>That was AOTS, not calling any AOTY until all the Fall shows are done.</br>   Hibekefags <br><br>Atleast Kyoani is busy restructuring their studio for the next months.<br><br>No Kyoani garbage for the next 2-3 seasons after this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ending was good, the rest was meh</br>  <br>I wouldn't say it was hipstershit though, it was an anime about making anime. It literally pandered to the otaku but it did it in a meaningful way telling them their lives aren't completely worthless and if they have passion they can pursue what they want as long as they never give up. It was a pretty simple anime but fairly enjoyable.</br>  <br> Mushishi <br> Barakamon <br> Nozaki-Kun <br> Ping Pong <br> Space Dandy <br> Shigatsu <br>Well, better than 2015 with it only having sequels and a few other decent shows. Cute girls doing cute things is much stronger this year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> restructuring </br>  <br>Looks like you accidentally posted the wrong image.</br>  <br>Shirobako was more recent than Ping Pong though. Ping Pong literally finished 1 year ago while Shirobako ended 4 months. It's newer which is why people are talking about it more than Ping Pong. Wait 8 more months and no one will be talking about it as much.</br>  <br> Shigatsu <br> good </br></br>  <br>http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/sta<wbr>ff/anibaka/blog/?p=1070<br><br>No Kyoani for summer, fall and winter.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It is good though. It does all the old school anime tropes correctly and has one of the most original premises ever. If there's one thing Gatoh is a master at it's creative premises. He knocked it out of the park with Military Boy meets Popular Normal High School Girl and gets into Comedic Hijinks and Narcissistic High School Boy Saves Amusement Park Full of Fairytale Creatures From Closing Down</br>  <br><br>Muh NIGGAS<br><br>Those two shows made 2014 worth it just by themselves. Stuff like YuYuYu added a little bit of spice on top of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saying Hibike is the best thing so far is sad</br>  <br>Eh, it's a guilty pleasure.</br>  2015 so far is Pleiades<br>2014 was Yuuki Yuuna. Fuck Ping Pong.</br>  <br> Planetes <br> Kino's Journey <br> Texhnolyze <br>All three are better than anything in 2007.</br></br></br></br>  <br> moving <br><br>Wow, it's nothing.</br></br></br>  <br> Fuck Ping Pong.  <br>Can you explain why?</br></br>  <br>Hmmm, actually this isn't far at all from the truth. With the Kekkai ballon flatening due to the delay and the "fun -&gt; drama" turn, Euphonium holds one of the top places despite its photorealism. You literally can't say the episode 12 wasn't worth it.</br>  <br>Stupid shit for vocal minority of circlejerking hipsters.</br>  <br>Not really.<br><br>Thats a big deal for such a small studio. Kyoani isn't like Sunrise with its gorillion animation studios.<br><br>Usually studios start working one the next show while the current one is still get made so having a break as a single studio is a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mountain episode solidifies Hibike as AOTS. There was just nothing close.</br>  <br>Not the same guy, but feel free to elaborate about what it is.</br>  <br> Shirobako for 2014 <br>Funny how no one even talks about Shirobako anymore, yet Ping Pong is an anime that will be talked about 10 years from now. No one bothers spamming Shirobako, because no one even fucking watched it.</br></br>  <br>But it wasn't a vocal minority, the general consensus is that it was AOTY.</br>  <br>Proxy polls are not a consensus.</br>  <br>YuYuYu was even more stupid, clichéd mahou shoujo garbage with a cop-out ending. 3/4ths of the show was just Madoka copy-pasted with shittier voice acting and visuals.</br>  <br>Shirobako is above average and will be remembered (and forgotten) as such.</br>  <br> hipstershit watched by less than 1/4 of the board <br> general consensus <br><br>This is what hipsters actually believe</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing wong with moving, it's not the death of a studio. I know you will like it to be exactly that but the truth is that they've grown a lot. It's obvious that you'll have to expand at one point. I'm literally not bothered or worried about this at all.</br>  <br>Not above anon but the manga actually managed to grab me and to get me to care for those girls where zombie survival usually fails. GG's charm lies in Yuki's delusions and how it creates a situation where you fear for the girls because it could lead them to their death, while allowing to give each or them a definite personality and how each is essential to the survival of the group. It isn't just a matter of "Moe / thrash" contrast.</br>  <br> Pleiades <br> Yuuki Yuuna <br> good <br><br> Ping Pong <br> stupid shit <br><br>Something tells me you haven't been watching anime for more than a year, summerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori Repeat.</br>  <br>Hi /mu/. Saw that band live a few months back, shit was insane.</br>  The Mushishi movie.  <br>Ok. So you don't have an actual argument.</br>  <br>Did i say its bothering me?<br><br>I just said they won't do any new shows during the next seasons because of it.</br></br></br>  Kiniro Mosaic  <br>How cute. Typical wannabe hipster who watches stupid shit to fit in and then randomly others of being newfags.</br>  <br> generic madoka ripoff dropped by more than 3/4 of the board after the first 2 eps aired <br> close to being good <br>YuYuYu, Pleiades, Shirobako, whatever else you think is AOTY 2014 has already faded into obscurity no more than 6 months after airing, while people still discuss Ping Pong more than a year later. I wonder which one of these shows are "hipstershit"</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you have to be hipster to like Ping Pong</br>  <br> No-one talks about Shirobako anymore <br>Jesus Christ, we've had talks about the anime fairly recently. Besides, how much a show is talked about has nothing to do with quality. See the endless "Railgun" threads.<br><br><br>It was nothing like Madoka, reveals aside.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> calls Ping Pong stupid shit without even watching it <br> defends two generic madoka rip-offs <br>Adorable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>YuYuYu still gets generals even now. Ping Pong threads are just shitposting.</br></br>  <br> dropped by more than 3/4 of the board after the first 2 eps aired <br>I wish. They all picked it up again once they realized that there were plot twists and edgy shit to circlejerk about. All of them bitching about the happy ending was beyond insufferable.</br></br>  <br> no one even talks about Shirobako anymore <br> Implying this is a sign of a good/bad show </br></br>  <br>Yeah it's definitely not because of the retards who call it "pretentious" and "hipster shit"</br>  <br>I dont like yucky tuna, shitobako or gaynax latest shitfest, no idea why you mentioned them or thought were related to the post you quoted. shit ping is still CRAP.</br>  <br> It was nothing like Madoka <br>Let's see<br> exact same colour scheme <br> grimdark suffering <br> characters fight enemies in a separate dimension away from civilians <br> cop-out happy ending   Rebellion aside <br>Keep eating shit, faggot.<br><br><br> YuYuYu still gets generals <br>Haha<br> generals <br> a sign of a quality show <br>Fuck off, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mahou shoujos are now madoka rip-offs </br>  <br>Pleiades isn't in any way similar to Madoka aside from the fact that it's mahou shoujo. You don't even know anything about the shows you're criticizing. Who's the newfag here again? Go watch some anime you stupid niwaka and stop championing your shitty tastes.</br>  <br>Please drop your Ping Pong goggles right now, you're not being objective. YuYuYu and Shirobako are still getting usual threads and where fall's most successful and marking shows. You literally can't deny that, with both selling over the 10k bar. You're just delusional.</br>  <br>Most Ping Pong discussion these days is about how ugly and pretentious it is.</br>  <br> Madoka <br> happy ending </br></br>  <br>So far Non Non Biyori Repeat.<br><br>It would have been JoJo part 3 if they didn't fuck up the ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Homu's happy</br>  <br> yucky tuna <br> shitobako <br> gaynax latest shitfest <br> shit ping <br><br>A tell tale sign of a shitposting MALfag is combining a show they haven't even seen's name with a swear word, thinking they're being clever or funny.<br>It's neither.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> homu happy <br> when madoka's gone <br>In rebellion, she is happy, though, so you're not completely wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> YuYuYu and Shirobako are still getting usual threads <br>Show me in the archive</br></br>  <br>The colour scheme is on par with every MS show, you dipshit. And there is no yellow or green Mahou Shoujo in Madoka.<br>The suffering is also a recurrent theme. Madoka just went all the way in.<br>cop-out happy ending is only for YuYuYu. Madoka's endings are always bittersweet.</br></br></br>  <br> mixing movies and shows <br>dumbass</br></br>  <br>Rebellion is the ending</br>  <br>You're supposed to put moe SoLs everywhere.</br>  <br> Pretentious: attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed. <br>please, PLEASE show me how Ping Pong was pretentious</br></br>  <br>This nigga gets it. How else are we supposed to keep the normies out?</br>  <br>It seems to me a fairly safe assumption that it was attempting to impress by affecting greater importance and quality than its choice of visual style actually possessed, as it seems to me a fairly safe assumption that it attempted to be something better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen, which is what it actually ended up looking like.</br>  <br>hope this means they're not doing Baku-On.</br>  <br>Took 11 meandering, lazy episodes to tell a story that could have been done in 90 minutes.<br><br>Looked like complete shit for no reason other then wow so unique.</br></br></br>  <br><br>NNB, obviously.</br></br>  Why do people shit on Ping Pong but no one shits on Tatami Galaxy?  <br>It was actually creative and had something interesting to say about its characters besides "HERO MAN U CAN BE HERO"</br>  <br>Tatami Galaxy is shat on for being pretentious, repetitive, poorly-paced drivel fairly often here, actually.</br>  <br>Your assumption is shit though. <br>It just respects the original art as do many other studios.</br></br>  <br>I would guess that the primary reason is that Tatami Galaxy does not look like a fat southern American woman's vomit after spending a few hours at Old Country Buffet.</br>  <br><br>Meanwhile, your precious Pong is missing from both current boards and the archive. There are no YuYuYu threads right now because most sufferingfags like me jumped on the Gurashi bandwagon. <br>And there are 3 Shirobako threads in the archive.</br></br></br>  <br>I've seen three threads in the past day saying just that about both.<br>I don't understand the criticisms but they've been receiving them lately in droves.</br></br>  <br> Your assumption is shit though.  <br>No, it's correct. I said it's safe to assume that it attempted to be something better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen. "An adaptation that is respectful of the original art" is better than dogshit mixed with elephant semen. The show attempted to send the message, "I am being respectful of the original art," but the message that was actually sent was, "this looks like dogshit mixed with elephant semen."<br>Do you understand now? This is very simple.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they do. I don't remember the last time I saw Tatami Galaxy being mentioned in a positive light.</br>  <br>Complaining about art style is the shallowest possible criticism.</br>  <br><br>The only people who dislike Ping Pong or Tatami either are trying hard to be nonconformists or are too stupid to appreciate them. <br><br>Anyone who think's the dialogues in Tatami are too fast probably does not read much literature. <br><br>Also using the word pretentious without knowing what the word even means is too common on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I stayed for the osts in the end songs and etc.<br><br>The manga aint bad so far.</br></br></br>  Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works.<br>Then again, it was better than every anime post-Eva so it isn't really fair.</br>  <br>It is, but that's a fact: a show with a weird artstyle is more likely to get bad criticism than a good-looking one. /a/utists are just that shallow but hey, don't forget that this is the place where nothing is good, anime are shit and people just pretend to watch them while dressing up as little girls.</br>  <br>Anyone who literally believes certain things are immune to criticism definitely doesn't read literature and is an obvious manchild pseud.</br>  <br>That was not the point though.<br>The initial claim that you made it that Ping Pong is pretentious since it wanted to be "superio" to the medium by "affecting greater importance and quality than its choice of visual style actually possessed" . This is wrong since the original manga is very close to the art style.<br>Now you say that the art looks like shit. That is subjective but in no way does it make the show pretentious.<br>Do you understand now? This is very simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not when you're talking about a primarily visual medium. That's like calling it shallow for complaining that someone with great lyrics sings out of key with the vocal tone of my grandmother's farts.</br>  <br>It'll be NNB again.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> Aria three times <br> Non Non Biyori two times <br> Sora no Woto <br> Hyouka <br><br>What is this abomination? And where is the old version?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only message you're sending is that you're a shallow faggot who thinks that art style is the end all be all and any show that happens to have unique art is shit, despite the fact that said show actually has excellent writing and was a standout of its year.<br><br>Hell at first I was reluctant to watch the show exactly because the art was off-putting, but by the end of it I was so immersed in the show that I wasn't even affected by the art and actually even came to enjoy it. You just stop caring about that shit when the writing and characters are good.</br></br></br>   Cinderella Girls.   <br>see<br><br>They're exactly the same thing. An anime with a great story (Ping Pong's is shit, btw) that looks like dogshit is exactly like a song with great lyrics sung by William Hung.</br></br></br>  <br> generalizing  <br>You can do this with any anime.</br></br>  AOTY will be owarimonogatari  <br>Depends entirely on what you're looking for. I found a show in Ping Pong which had an art style I liked, excellent direction, and realistic characters. That's why I think it was the AOTY.</br>  <br>I still need to watch half of this list but it looks correct for those that I know. NNB AOTY might be pushing it, tho.</br>  So is anything that isn't a shounen for 14 year olds or a moe SoL or a mahou shojo, "hipstershit" and "pretentious"?  <br>No, not every show has such awful pacing. The characters fucked around and repeated themselves for the entire show until they needed a resolution at the end. It got the message across but each person had maybe 2-3 moments that actually furthered their development and it could have been done in movie format.</br>  <br>edgy seinen, forced drama</br>  <br>was yatterman night this year or last, i dont remember<br><br>i enjoyed it a lot. also the OP was amazing</br></br></br>  <br>I would say "welcome to /a/" but no, you should just fuck off.</br>  <br> yatterman night <br>Literally poor man's zvezda</br></br>  <br>that show was such crap</br>  <br>zvezda was the shit. i hope we get more of it</br>  <br>Not exactly comparable. Music evokes emotions more through instruments and singing itself than lyrics; lyrics regularly play second fiddle. Most classic albums are classic because of what they did aurally, not because of their lyrics. Meanwhile, most classic anime are classic because of their stories and characters, not because they had groundbreaking art. Instruments and singing are the backbone of music, story and characters are the backbone of a storytelling medium.</br>  <br>It was winter 2015.

There really should be more anime/manga about something other than HS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked Ping Pong because it had solid character development, good pacing and excellent directing, so I guess it pandered to my desire to watch quality media.</br>  <br> solid character development <br>Ripped directly out of a textbook of sportsshonen/battleshonen cliches.</br></br>  <br>Pander? You really think they made Ping Pong to pander to a group of consumers? Why not just make an ecchi harem or a moe SoL then? Take off those cynicism goggles anon.</br>  <br>Texhnolyze was a real let-down to Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei, though.</br>  <br>Did you even fucking watch it, holy shit. Not to mention everything is a fucking clone of something, what matters is the execution, pacing and direction. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Useless post.</br>  <br>because unfortunately most of /a/ is divided into two sects: moeshit SoL or Shonenshit. Those are two most talked about genres on this shithole and comprise the largest percentage of /a/. The people who like anything besides those two genres are smaller in comparison and when they try to discuss those anime they get shat on by autistic faggots from one of those two groups.</br>  <br>Ping Pong still sold decently, a lot more than most anime this year. I think it was like 4.5k or something like that.</br>  <br>It's really fucking annoying too. Not saying teenagers in HS are annoying by itself, but the coming-of-age stories that all demographics of anime slobber over are annoying.<br> supernatural teens <br> teens in mechs <br> teens in military <br> teens in post-apocalyptic world <br> teens thrust into a war <br> teens experiencing the first pangs of love <br> teens stranded and finding a way back <br>It's usually one or more of these settings mixed together, put in a coming-of-age introspective story in it, and people will lick the asshole of whoever directed it. It's the same goddamn progression over and over again yet these same people will look down on haremshit or shounenshit for the exact same thing.<br><br>Elitists must go, fuck your show.<br><br><br>I'm not being cynical. I'm disgusted at people who think their coming-of-age shows are so far superior than shows that deal with more mundane things like nudity and action.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's moeshit SoL that panders to manchildren</br>  <br>Yes, it was a show about ping pong players who each had to find their own reason for playing sports and matured through the challenges they faced. It follows the basic template of character development for every show ever, and why wouldn't it? That's how fiction works. Hell, that's how life works. But it was well-written and believable, and the pacing and strong directing made it a joy to watch. It's all in the execution, as always.</br>  <br> Doesn't it tire you to watch the same thing over and over again about teenagers coming of age? <br><br>For most anime nowadays, yes. But that's because they're all generic, contrived trash reusing the same tropes over and over again, and changing some slight things to differentiate themselves from the other pieces of trash. But Ping Pong is much, much different in every way. This was teenage coming of age that was realistic and enjoyable.</br></br></br>  <br> solid character development <br>Hunter x Hunter<br> good pacing and excellent directing <br>which I can also find in Hunter x Hunter<br>with better fuckin' anime art and animation I might add<br>While HxH is also longer, has more content, is not just a one-off jackoff but a continual climax, yet you retards still say your taste is quality<br><br>How do you nerds live like that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> believable <br> Peco <br>Find me a sports nerd who had to visualize wings out of his back just to play his stupid ball game.<br><br>NONE. THEY'RE ALL FUCKING JOCKS unless you're a wuss who plays chess. Shut up with this believable shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever man. I'm not really sure what you're complaining about anymore (did you barely realize that most anime is shit, and most things are in fact copies of each other?), so I'll just chalk this up to another nothing post. Anime is shit, we all pretty much knew that. <br><br>What's you're favorite anime though?</br></br></br>  <br>Kuusen Madoushi</br>  <br> This was teenage coming of age that was realistic and enjoyable. <br>How much will you bet you'll be saying that shit with the next coming of age anime you'll come across?<br> because they're all generic, contrived trash reusing the same tropes over and over again </br></br></br>  <br> Find me a sports nerd who had to visualize wings out of his back just to play his stupid ball game. <br>fucking kek <br><br>Why can't you just accept that a lot of us liked Ping Pong for what it was? It was a very solidly directed anime, something which this industry desperately needs more of.</br></br></br></br>  <br> moeshit <br/></br>  <br>I don't understand the point of your post, or the need to bring HxH into it when I also happen to love that show. HxH is good, Ping Pong is good, tons of other shows are good. Why not just watch all of them and enjoy the variety? That's like saying you don't want to watch any other movie because you saw one movie you really liked.</br>  <br>It was a pretentiously directed anime.</br>  <br>There's several coming of age anime every season and 90% of them are shit, anon.</br>  <br> I'm not really sure what you're complaining about anymore <br>What made elitists decide coming-of-age anime was the best genre of anime when it's plagued with the same kind of repetitive cliches the same elitists accuse other genres for?<br> What's you're favorite anime though? <br>Penguindrum</br></br></br></br>  <br>Penguindrum is a coming of age anime.</br>  <br>I don't see any coming of age anime this season unless you count Gakkou Gurashi or Classroom Crisis. Of course, I don't know how those anime will progress but they give me those vibes.<br><br><br>Exactly. It was when I realized the same shit happened over and over again and people were falling for the same shit over and over again. It's like cheap drama except people think it's smart and well-directed.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What made elitists decide coming-of-age anime was the best genre of anime when it's plagued with the same kind of repetitive cliches the same elitists accuse other genres for? <br>This is boogeyman: the post. I'd love to see some of these "coming-of-age elitists" though.</br></br>  <br>Can we all agree that Barakamon was AOTY for 2014. I mean even 2chan agreed to that as well.</br>  <br>So you like Penguindrum because it's a coming-of-age anime but hate Ping Pong because it's a coming-of-age anime, even though they're both well-written shows and completely different in almost every way?</br>  <br> Find me a sports nerd <br><br>It's called a pre-game ritual and it's totally common among athletes. <br><br>For Peco, it's visualizing wings out of his back<br><br>For Jason Terry it's sleeping in his opponents' shorts<br><br>For Brian Urlacher, it's eating 2 girl scouts cookies <br><br>For John Henderson, it's getting other people to slap him<br><br>For Les Miles, it's eating grass off the football field<br><br>For goalie Sergio Goycochea it's pissing on the ground surrounding the soccer goal before a penalty kick<br><br>For Jason Giambi he likes wearing golden thongs whenever he was feeling down before a game<br><br>Even real people do weird shit before they play, and some of these are weirder than imagining you can fly which seems pretty normal</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are MAL cancer, leave /a/</br>  <br>You see them everywhere. It's why Bakemonogatari is so highly regarded when it's just drivel with so many words just to express that he wants to fuck this girl in front of him. It's why Planetes (great show don't get me wrong) is so highly regarded when it's just a whirlwind romance and her husband left him. It's why fucking Madoka sells so fucking much when it's just the director experimenting on whether magical girls dying would print some motherfucking money.<br><br>People fall for it every single time yet have the gall to point out the repetitiveness of ecchi, harem, and shounen. No, we don't have the right to do that anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>top posting this garbage saying this is official you fucking /v/ cancer</br>  Can someone please show me an anime better than Hibike Euphonium for spring season 2015? I fail to see anything that would beat it.  <br>Your favorite anime is Penguindrum anon, this shit is awful so no one can take you seriously.</br>  <br> Bakemonogatari <br> Planetes <br> Madoka <br>What do any of these shows have to do with people liking Ping Pong? They're completely different and target different audiences. You just sound butthurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Peco being compared to all these football athletes <br>Guess what they are? They're fucking real. They're also jocks. Shit that Peco isn't. So don't give me this pregame ritual bs, no pregame ritual involves hallucinations unless you're taking meth.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, boogeyman. Feel free to believe your delusions, no one can stop you. Just realize that you're fucking retarded too. <br><br><br>No, there was nothing close.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you fucking /v/ cancer <br> it's mostly "moe" anime <br>You appear confused.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw shitposting on an anime image board instead of watching anime and actually passing an informed judgement as to which anime was AOTY </br>  <br>You're kind of a retard, aren't you.</br>  <br>There was none.</br>  <br>Because you think Ping Pong is AOTS good.<br><br>It's not. Every fucking coming of age story has the same plot progression and the same kinds of characters dressed in different settings and tropes. And you swallow that phlegm dribble all the way to convincing others and yourself that it's good.</br></br></br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> 5.89% </br></br>  <br>1/10, please no one else reply</br>  <br> KEKkai Senshit <br> 5.89% <br>I knew that episodic bullshit wouldn't fool anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>OK. Make sure to stop watching literally every other anime in existence though, since they're all rehashes of each other. Everything is shit and a copy of each other. Time to grow out of the medium, anon. <br><br> Or stop acting like a retard </br></br></br>  <br>Nyanpasu.</br>  <br>Congratulations, you just discovered the basic tropes of all fictional works.</br>  <br> including continued winter shows in spring AOTS </br>  <br><br>You've never played sports if you think pregame rituals needed shit as complicated as that. It's just ordinary things done in a strange way. Hallucinating before a match isn't ordinary it's fucking drug use.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking dumb? You're complaining that Peco is unrealistic in what he does before a match but I give you a list of several real athletes who do weird things before their matches, and some of them are even weirder than fucking imagining you can fly. Peco is fucking realistic in that aspect because there are people in real life who do the same fucking thing.</br>  <br>Congratulations, now you can't put down SoL moe shows for not being AOTS since coming of age shows literally follow a more rigid progression than sols.</br>  <br>Did anyone ever it sub it to the end? I can't even remember the name of the group that was two months or more behind for every release</br>  <br>While Euphonium has some of the most interesting visuals I've seen in a while, the first half of Shokugeki no Souma was more enjoyable than that. But my spring AOTS is Pleiades, the most enjoyable threads I had in this year.</br>  <br>CSB time. I'm a USC alumni. I was there with a roommate who knew someone who was on the baseball team with Barry Zito when he was at USC. One day Barry was too nervous to pitch, so he ran back to the showers to rub one off. Ended up throwing a shutout. Ever since then, dude rubs one off before every start. Never shake the hand of Barry Zito or Moises Alou, who peed on his hands for grip on the bat.</br>  <br>Characters growing up and maturing is a basic storytelling technique, dude. I'm not sure why you even bother consuming media at all when the idea of character development is pissing you off.</br>  <br>but they don't</br>  <br> Yahari </br>  <br>Too bad your so called AOTS Hibiki couldn't even break 10K while Kekkai broke 20K.<br><br>Western fans don't mean shit, what matters is sales in Japan. Fuck the OST for Kekkai sold more than the OST of Hibiki which is an actual musical anime.</br></br></br>  <br>good to know thanks</br>  <br>How is it rigid? Each show has different writing and each character matures differently. You're literally looking down on the entire concept of fiction, what the fuck are you even doing here?</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> Western fans don't mean shit, what matters is sales in Japan. <br>The only opinions that matter here are the ones posted here. You know, the ones that crowned Hibike AOTS. KyoAni finds a way.</br></br>  <br>You know what also sold well? SAO. Now that's an AOTY for the ages, right?</br>  <br>Euphonium was great, but Kekkai Sensen is still better even without a final episode.</br>  <br> posting </br>  Well, this was one of the worst threads I've had the displeasure of reading this year.<br><br> show is good <br> nah uh <br> yah huh <br> muh 1 gorillion threads this week <br> is moeshit <br> is pretentious <br><br>Good job faggots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Take a few minutes to even try and think what would be my favorite of 2015 so far <br> Nothing has been that good, check out thread anyway <br> All this Ping Pong hate <br> Pretentious <br><br>Listen faggots, you can hate and argue about Ping Pong all you want, but don't make shit arguments. You are just doing your own side a disservice when you call something pretentious because it means you don't have an argument or have such a shit vocabulary that you actually cannot articulate the thoughts in your own head.<br><br>Pretentious:<br> attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed. <br> Than is actually possessed <br><br>Who is the judge of that exactly? No one, you're just alluding to this authority that doesn't exist because you're too much of a pussy to do the work and argue.<br><br> Hipster <br>Same shit different word.<br><br>For fuck sakes /a/. At least make sense when you don't like things.

I failed [/spoiler[ </br>  <br><br>Did you guys not watch Ore MOnogatari or Shokugeki?<br><br><br>But<br> Yahari doing that well <br>I take it back, /a/ does like bad, pretentious anime at times.<br><br><br><br>Ping Pong was 2014</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br>This is how all AOTS/AOTY threads are.<br>Usually the shows they pick shows what kind of people actually visit these threads.</br></br>  <br> This is how all threads that mention ping pong are <br>There, that's better. That show attracts some of the absolute worst shitposters, I have no idea what it is.</br></br>  <br> But <br> &gt;Yahari doing that well <br> I take it back, /a/ does like bad, pretentious anime at times. <br>For once I agree with you!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen basically all the relevant spring shows and you can't be serious. Ore Monogatari is fucking repetitive as shit and should have been 1 cour. All it's about is how stronk Takeo is and how lewd Yamato is. It's not even enjoyable anymore, it's boring and a chore to watch but i've already invested too much time to quit now. <br><br>Shokugeki is alright, but I wouldn't call it the best show by any means. <br><br>Only shows i'd really consider for AOTS are Hibike and Kekkai although Kekkai delaying the last episode and having a general lack of a good overarching story makes me believe Hibike is really the only choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it either, all the criticism sounds like shitposting nonsense from people who didn't even watch the show.</br>  <br><br> replying to tripfags with shitty taste <br>http://myanimelist.net/animelist/mr<wbr>runningbear</wbr></br></br></br>   Pongfags e-patting themselves on the back   <br> all the criticism sounds like shitposting nonsense from people who didn't even watch the show. <br>imagine that.</br></br>  <br>Goddammit Bear I swear to god Tokyo Magnitude is one of the shittiest shows out there. How have you not changed that already?</br>  <br>Clearly it's Non Non Biyori</br>  Etotama is the Ping Pong of 2015.  <br><br>It's because it isn't moe<br><br>That is the entire reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice false dichotomy faggot. Paint the whole world white and black why don't you, you little shitposter. This mindset of hurr durr TTGL is disliked because it's not LUCKY STAR, it's all LUCKY STARS fault! Fuck this thread. Fuck you</br>  <br>Dude are you serious?</br>  <br> acting like chobits wasn't great </br>  Posting in a shitpost thread   tfw I can't tell the people who generally think Non Non Biyori is AOTY from the people saying it just to troll.   <br> Hyouka <br>This is bait.</br></br>  <br><br>nnb</br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is one of the most well-executed SOLs of the past few years. <br><br> tfw not having to listen to constant internal monologues that explain every little bit of action <br>Like a pearl in a sea of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SHOCK </br>  <br>Thank you for putting the names this time</br>  <br> any amount of discussion about things I dislike is shitposting  <br>whatever you say dude.</br></br>  <br>R u new? I'm curious</br>  <br>The first 2 or 3 episodes were so fucking terrible for Yuri Kuma I can't even consider it anything remotely close to AOTY.</br>  <br>worst ikuhara production</br>  <br> Subete ga F ni Naru <br>Fucking what?</br></br>  <br>Chobits was good, but there really wasn't anything else that year that stood out for me.<br><br><br>But it's such an emotional and great show. The only other shows I would consider for 2009 would be Ippo, Cross Game or Spic Wolf</br></br></br></br>  Teekyuu  <br>I'm sure Charlotte will be remembered because it's the sob story of the season, like anohana, AB! and maeda's other stuff.</br>  <br>Overlord and Gakkou Garashi come to mind; the former is just plain gud and the latter is a slow burn.</br>  <br>Why is there never a 2014 AOTY in these bait pictures?<br><br>It's pic related by the way</br></br></br>  <br>I like Code Geass but how the fuck did the 3rd spinoff OVA get that many votes?</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori repeat</br>  <br>Hmm let's see<br><br> top anime is moe yurishit, waifu pandering to the nth degree, KyoAni which is already sure to get votes <br> 2nd is Genuine Understanding RomCom which has a protagonist most people who watch anime can relate to and waifu pandering that reaches unprecedented levels that most of the threads on this show are trash because they're all waifu wars <br> 3rd and 4th are both shonenshit but the cooking one is shittier and has waifu pandering, either way both are entry level shit that appeal to kids <br> 5th is RPG shit with Gary Stu voiced by the King of Stus himself and full of waifu pandering including an oppai loli to get the lolicons too <br><br>Man all that shit taste<br><br>Thankfully 6th place breaks that cycle of trash with a heartfelt, romantic/coming-of-age SoL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Muh nigga<br>Best canon yuri show of the decade so far</br></br>  <br> hurr durr I have literally no idea what I'm talking about </br>  <br>Houkago no Pleiades<br>too bad like 15 people on /a/ watched it</br></br>  <br>Pleiades.</br>  Why don't just make Shirobako as double AOTY if you can't find AOTY of 2015 yet  <br>Tell that to Garden of Words</br>  <br>because it wasnt very good</br>  <br>It was AOTY 2014 but NNB Repeat is better.</br>  <br> no game no life <br>atrocious.</br></br>  <br> Implying people were here for the TTGL funposting <br> Implying people still remember Lucky Star and not blame everything on K-On now. <br>Get along with the times grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br>Improved =/= made worthwhile</br>  <br>No, Ping Pong was AOTY, followed by NNB.</br>  <br> mahou shoujo <br> madoka rip-off <br>i see pong ping fags retard as usual</br></br></br>  <br>ITT : pretentious shit that sell like shit</br>  <br>Yeah, it's not just very good, it's a phenomenon.</br>  <br>/a/ hipsters still pretend shitrobako was a big hit? Mein sides.</br>  <br>It is big hit, and once again Mizushima Tsutomu saved a studio after GuP.<br><br>Besides, the hipsters show of fall 2014 was Bahamut, a show that average sales was about 20% of Shirobako sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry it ain't a phenomenon. Just a dark horse title that gained traction near the middle of its run and appealed to Otaku enough for them to buy it. It's a solid hit but by this time next year most people won't even be talking about it. Love Live pretty much stole all the attention from everything in 2014.</br>  <br> exact same colour scheme <br>Next thing you will say is that Garo ripped the color scheme of power rangers<br><br> grimdark suffering <br> Madoka invented grimdark situations with suffering  <br><br> cop-out happy ending <br>Madoka's existence literally disappears, fuck of.<br><br><br> YuYuYu still gets generals even now. <br>You seriously need to check the definition of generals. Also the same thing that anon said to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know Shirobako become a thing and stole all winter 2015 shows attention right? what's this have to do with Love Live which was a 2014 spring 1 cour show?<br><br> It's a solid hit but by this time next year most people won't even be talking about it. <br>Go dream about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> filename <br> gif <br> not even arguing <br>sasuga</br></br></br></br>  <br> become a thing and stole all winter 2015 shows attention right? <br><br>Nah that was Kancolle and IdolMaster</br></br></br>   there are actually people that consider generic sleep inducing trash like NNB to be the anime of the year   <br> Go dream about that. <br><br>You can keep being delusional about it if you want. Unless they make a season 2 or something which I guess isn't likely since Mizushima said he's booked for quite a while you'll only have people say "oh yeah, that show, it was pretty good" and it will fade away in obscurity but remembered as being good. Shirobako already hit its peak and it doesn't look like PA Works is looking to capitalize on it.</br></br></br>  Hey there.

Think how I have to feel going along with it all! I’ve been waiting this whole time for you to use Imagine Breaker against me just once!! To be honest, the one thing that was most like you was the courageous dive from the rooftop at the very beginning! Everything has been so boring ever since that girl showed up!!

If you had thrown her out and had her slip into the crowds, you would have been freed from that annoyance, so why did you keep her with you?” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  part 3  <br><br> “Take that grimoire library for example. The knowledge of those 103,000 grimoires might have been helpful. And Othinus might have been able to give you some accurate advice from the viewpoint of a Magic God. Then you would have been able to clench your right fist and challenge me to a battle focused on Imagine Breaker. That would be the proper way of doing this, but it all fell apart thanks to that girl. What do you think about this situation?”  <br> &gt;“Heh heh. Argue from a position of emotion or willpower all you want. It does not change the fact that she was, in fact, a burden. What does that girl understand of magic? Not to mention of the territory known as a Magic God. What use is someone who has fallen so hopelessly behind? Enough pretending, Kamijou Touma. You were honestly growing sick of having to lower the conversation to her level, weren’t you?”  <br><br>Hot damn. Mikoto was literally destroyed. Annihilated. BTFO is short to describe it.<br><br>Based High Priest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oho hoi~</br></br></br>  <br>Uho hoi</br>  <br>More like she'll now be aware of what she's facing and improve to help the Touman.</br>  Uho hoi~  All the shit mikoto has done this volume and only reasons for why it is good that she is there is because her ignorance allows him to pretend the situation isn't as hopeless as it really is plus protecting girls gives him strength. I guess that clarifies that he really is still scared shitless of magic gods and used mikoto tough it out.<br><br> all high priest wanted was for touma to give him a moralfag speech and punch him in the face OT style </br></br>   “You are letting that boring girl drag you around and it is just sad. You are not so small a ‘human’ that you should be contained here.”  <br><br>AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHA</br></br>  <br> so why did you keep her with you?” <br><br>I found this strange as well.<br>Why would Touma keep Mikoto with him? Wouldn't it be better to leave her somewhere else and continue away from High Priest? Touma didn't really answer that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not getting stronger than she currently is no matter what, so too bad for her.</br>  <br>Honestly, this volume is just proving that the "Kamijou Touma Magic God Fan Club" jokes were actually completely correct.</br>  <br>Is she going to learn magic because if not she isn't going to be aware of shit and even if there were gods left she wouldn't be able to get to their or even god's right seat level without help.</br>   If she had fallen behind, then she had to gather her strength and move forward more than anyone else. The greater her debt, the more she had to build up speed and catch up as soon as possible. Wasn’t that all this was?  <br>Well, that confirms it.</br>  <br> Is she going to learn magic <br><br>She can't.<br>That would kill her. She might still learn how it works, but using it would be lethal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, isn't he just evading the question?</br>  <br>Confirms what</br>  Does the imaginary number district work on magic gods?  <br>Yeah it didn't hit me until I already posted, but magic knowledge could help her counter some things.</br>  Is any other Level 5 a match for them?  <br>That she's getting a power-up in the next few novels.</br>   It was no different from seeing a plastic bag on the side of the road and wanting to remove it. <br>Oh, hey, a callback to the Volume 1 Prologue.</br>  <br>That honestly would be so cheap and stupid.</br>  <br>Even a full powered, white wings Accelerator would only do a tiny bit better than Mikoto. And even he would probably get called a burden, too. But maybe not as hard as Mikoto did</br>  <br>N U I T<br>U<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Accelerator, Kakine, and Gunha would all sure as hell be more useful than her.</br>  <br>I doubt even Accelerator with his White Wings would be any threat.<br>Also, Gunha was BTFO by Ollerus when he had impure Magic God powers. <br>Level 5s can't really compare to Magic Gods.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it would, if he really was protecting her that should be the first thing he does. No other escort mission has stopped touma from fighting NT10 is a prime example of that and he never really tested his fist on a MG.</br>  <br>She'll be useless at this point, even with a cheap power up.</br>  <br>It was already hinted in Railgun.<br><br>Connecting her to the Network would grant her a truly ludicrous powerup.</br></br></br>  <br>oh hell no, Not even all of them at once with their most powerful incarnations could stop Fiamma let alone a magic god.</br>  <br>Exterior doesn't exist anymore, and Aleister has plenty of better cards to play than her.</br>   "NT13 HAS MISAKA BEING BTFO BTFO BTFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO"</wbr> <br><br> Mummy-man says some shit but Touma says how it actually is <br><br>Why are shitposters so damn lazy nowadays?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exterior was only needed to hack the Network and force Mikoto to connect to it.<br><br>The only thing Misaka would really need to be able to connect to the Network would be a Testament machine.<br><br>A  "New Testament"  designed specifically for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he rectified it by saying he wouldn't mind having his hand melted just to shut him up. Doesn't mean it didn't happen, retard.</br>  So, guys, where is Mikoto getting BTFO?<br>I'm not seeing it.<br> gets called a burden <br> Touma defends her <br> HP gets literally BTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the "she's going to get a power up soon" crowd is stupid, but it honestly has been foreshadowed, which means it might happen. I agree with your "better cards to play" statement, however, I think his better card is not a single person but a group of people, of which she is part</br>  <br>And High-Priest was saying that just to make him mad?<br>Are you stupid?<br>Brain-damaged?<br>A baka?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aleister is just a silly human who couldn't see Kamisato Kakeru.<br>His keikaku will fall apart soon enough.</br></br>   “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called a burden <br> toumas defense is her being useless gives him strength <br> even misaka doesn't like that answer </br></br></br>  <br>HP was right about almost everything though. You're just a whiteknight faggot like Touma.</br>  <br>If he was just saying to to make him mad he wouldn't have carried on with it after Touma started running again and had left the room, he truly believes Misaka is holding him back</br>  <br>Except all the shitposters were claiming that Touma was the one telling Mikoto to go away, when it's literally the opposite, he wants her to stay.</br>  <br> being useless <br> she literally saved his life <br> if he went full IB on HP he'd probably die, as that was what HP was expecting <br><br>Come the fuck on.<br>Hell, Touma even explained that punching him would be stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Noukan alone and the Kiharas are more important cards than all the level 5s together.<br>Besides, at this point I doubt Aleister can't just produce more Level 5s if he needs.</br></br>  <br>That's why she's holdings him back, trueTouma would've punched him regardless the consequences.</br>  <br>What are the kanji for his name?</br>  <br>Yeah, he wanted her to stay so a magic god could rip her to pieces.</br>   (I’m only a burden to him!!)  <br>okay, no more misaka</br>  <br>And then this happened.<br><br> (I’ll do it.) <br><br> In that case, this was no time to be sitting around worrying. <br><br> (I swear I’ll do it.) <br><br> If she had any complaints and if she had things she wanted to correct… <br><br> (I’ll catch up to him!!) <br><br> She had to start by telling him!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And died horribly.</br>  <br> Just checked the Japanese wiki and it seems that the name of the new character that appears at the end with World Rejector is not Kamisato Takeru but Kamisato Kakeru.  <br>Kanj: 上里翔流(かみさとかける)</br></br>  <br> believing that bullshit when it was misaka who kept trying to confront PH directly  <br>He already hoped on the bike and was running when mikoto appeared.</br></br>  You guys do realize that even if Touma completely agreed with the High Priest he'd never come out and say that, right?  <br><br>This really should've happened way back in the first series.</br></br>  <br>To quote Touma<br> You’re a complete stranger, so quit acting like you know who I am!! </br></br>  If Imagine Breaker is so important to the gods, why did Othinus try to destroy it?  <br>I think it actually did. I know for a fact it happened back in NT 3, she just never had the chance to act on it.</br>  <br>Heh? Even thought they know EVERYTHING about him.</br>  <br>She didn't?<br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Saved him by being a burden. The desire to protect her is what saved him but that isn't what she wants thus she was btfo. She thought she was being helpful but she wasn't and she can't except that she was being helpful by being unhelpful.</br>  <br><br>So Laura is a step before Crowley in the main keikaku. <br><br>This can't end well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread NT9 because clearly you missed major points like Othinus straight up saying she wanted to use it for herself</br>  So what now? A Mikoto training arc?   “Grit your teeth, High Priest. This might ruin my right hand and I might really have to get it amputated at the hospital, but I’ll trade that arm for your face!! Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”  <br><br>ITS HEREEEEE</br></br>  <br>I want to build on this question. I don't quite understand Othinus. Why did she need to put Touma through those million hells to make him commit suicide? I vaguely recall something like "If I kill you, IB will find a new host and it'll be a pain in the ass to hunt it down again" or something, but that doesn't make sense because if Touma killed himself via building jumping, wouldn't that happen anyway?<br><br>Basically why did Othinus keep fucking reviving Touma, what good would it do to keep him alive? Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Two boring filler volumes.</br></br>   Touma trying to rationalize why it is better for misaka to be there instead of index and othi <br> even though he tried to call them as soon as he could </br>  <br>He would've denied himself if he said it out loud, even if it's true.</br>  <br>Man, you guys are really reaching. For the past few weeks it's all been "Touma's going to tell her off, she's going to run off and avoid him forever!"<br><br>When the actual scene is Touma saying he wants her around and Biri deciding to try and be more useful to him and find out more about him. You want to move those goalposts any further or...?</br></br></br>  <br> Kamisato <br><br>"Understands God"? "Admonishes God"?</br></br></br>  <br>AAAAAnd he didn't do it.</br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br>Yes, consciously at least that was the idea that he'd be easiest to use in that manner. Unconsciously she was also putting him through that to have him experience the hell that her life had been and achieve her other goal of having someone who understood her, which is why in the end having got it she brought back Touma's world to how it was</br></br>  <br> everyone on the internet is the same guy </br>  <br> Raildex <br> training <br><br>She'll get tossed aside while the England arc is up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's explained that she put him through what she herself went through as she wandered through endless worlds. She wanted someone to understand what she went through, since it's simply impossible for any living human to comprehend her history.<br><br>I think the last scene before she turned everything back had her admitting she was lying to herself about her motive.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, he's only an flawed, imperfect highschool boy isn't he?</br>  So ultimate 'being like him' turns him into the One who Purifies Gods and Slay Demons ?<br>and misaka's role is the stopper of that ?</br>  <br> England <br>Please more Kanzaki.</br></br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br><br>Maybe Othinus is into femdom. Wouldn't put it past her.<br>I found it pretty hot how she would torture him with the infinite worlds and make him smell her scent from time to time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The One Who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons <br> The One Who Admonishes Gods and Something Something? </br></br>  <br>Please stop injecting your shit fetishes into Index</br>  <br>damn</br>  Man, I have to agree with High Priest, Touma the utterly insane punchaholic is more exciting than Touma the Keikaku Science Man  <br>Well yeah.<br><br>It'd be really dumb.</br></br></br>   “Boring, boring, boring, boring!!!!!! At last, at long last, it looked like the winds were changing, but that girl!! Are you going to run away after all this? How many times have I told you it is only a matter of sooner or later? How long are you going to delay the inevitable!? What happened to Imagine Breaker!? What happened to your right hand!? What happened to the One who Purifies Gods and Slays Demooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn<wbr>nnnsssssssssssssssssssssssssss!?</wbr>   do you feel Touma in this volume is boring ?  <br>It's also because they already planned to ship HP into space. Into that comet to be more precise.</br>  <br>I'm not into scat, though.</br>  <br><br>Kamachi already did it.</br></br>  <br>I disagree honestly. The scene in the WW3 arc where Touma does freaking math to figure out the flight path of a bomber to fake a bombing run on some magicians was really awesome.<br><br>Or the scene where Touma uses heat expansion to disable a terrorist's gun.</br></br></br>  <br> implying punching the magma mummy wouldn't burn off his hand and release the dragons </br>    <br>I find Touma in general boring. But this volume wasn't as bad as usual.</br>  <br><br>I feel Touma is boring for the last 20 volumes. With few good moments here and there.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, yes, PTSD Touma is boring as fuck but you can see more of his flaws in his current self.</br>  <br>Touma always keikaku science man. but in his previous battle he never keep running away like this.</br>   Touma with Kakine <br>The entire city slowly gets destroyed and replaced with dark matter as they fight High Priest.<br> Touma with Accelerator <br>Increasingly ridiculous amounts of fire power until they eventually just chuck High Priest into space, like they did here.<br> Touma with Gunha <br>Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching.</br></br></br></br></br>  What if the entire series is really Touma's keikaku?  <br>That would be awesome. Damn Misaka</br>  <br>What was the most heated danger he faced off against? Innocentius was only 3k degrees C, compared to the possible 6k degrees C of the magma HP ate.</br>  <br>While they were cool Touma's best kind of moments for me will always be stuff like him just running straight at Gabe to run punch her back to Heaven even if it means drowning in the Arctic(or was it Antarctic?) ocean, along with riding a fucking sword thrown by a Saint to punch out a princess of England that has been empowered by the UK, and Archangel Michael</br>  <br>Innocentius is also magic so his hand would negate it.</br>  <br>Probably Fiamma's flame sword.</br>  <br><br>Did he write it in a certain magical index?</br></br>  <br>He's so-so, High Priest was the real selling point of this novel, fucker was even more glorious than Bullshit Master St. Germain</br>  Railgun 78<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!rwxVhajY!TG9wQ<wbr>-HI4QzOy6DtHzZZ8ZhjQrX-Qu842_HD_EuC<wbr>VB8</wbr></wbr></br>   people saying touma running away is good because fist fighting a god is stupid <br>as if any of this was fucking smart.</br>  <br><br>Finally. The only part of the franchise where Mikoto is a good and likeable character.</br></br>  <br>Word.<br>I love High Priest's antics.</br></br>  <br>When will the new chapter come out?</br>  <br>THANKS.<br>Finally Saiai using LN outfit</br></br>  <br>This is before amnesia in Volume 14 and muh feelings in Volume 16, mind you.</br>  <br>Both in the new volume and now the new Railgun, Hanzou's really getting around</br>  <br><br> Did THK forced his existence into the Raildexverse?</br></br>  <br>Wow I hadn't thought of that. God fucking damn it Misaka</br>  <br> Saiai actually have flat chest complex </br>  <br>The High Priest's rant does match up perfectly with /a/ rants about her</br>  So this is your concept of "BTFO"?<br> High Priest shittalked her, Touma told him to shut the fuck up and she realized High Priest was kind of right and decided to improve (which of course won't happen like all the other times Mikoto decided shit).<br> I don't see how this is her getting BTFO.</br></br>  <br>HP had a more viable and logical reason to say Misaka was very unnecessary in this volume.</br>  <br>I disagree, he just told him the obvious, I didn't saw any shittalk in his words.</br>  <br> could've gotten more info on the Dragons <br>Fucking Misaka, High Priest was completely right about you</br></br>  <br>I don't see any blatant over exaggerated shit talk but he was being antagonizing</br>   Naruto reference in my Railgun manga <br>I don't know what think about it.</br>  <br>She's still somewhat rekt since Touma said she was useful because of how useless she was and he had someone to protect, he didn't mention anything about her helping him or the like, it realistically could have been him saving any girl, and Mikoto realized that and was upset by it</br>  <br>Pointing out the obvious about the massive difference in level, knowledge, powers and importance in such a blunt manner is precisely blowing the fuck out of her.<br><br>The truth hurts, doesn't it? It's the same shit.</br></br></br>  <br> fremea massages frenda's boobs <br> those shadow clones <br>7/10 good chapter</br></br></br>  <br>What is BTFO?</br>  <br>it the truth though</br>  What are the chances of High Priest actually being right about imagine breaker? Hasn't everyone else who tried to say what it is ended up being terribly wrong?  <br> Biribiri and Touma Forced Operation</br>  <br>Blow the fuck out</br>  top fucking kek  <br>You realising that you're not a hero, just a trash.</br>  <br>Index is the Naruto of the LNs after all.</br>  Saiai best ITEM  <br><br>You mean the only part of the franchise that is still good.</br></br>  <br> Not liking the LNs </br>  i want in this room  <br>Haters blown the fuck out by Touma.</br>  <br>Is that a hotel rented by Mikoto or a safehouse of Saiai's?</br>  <br>The haters telling everyone to wait for the translation were just retarded, don't worry about it. Mikoto got the farthest thing from BTFO this volume.</br>  <br>some internet cafe</br>  <br> beds in an internet cafe <br>For what purpose</br></br>  <br>For the NEET on the go?</br>  <br>Too bad Mikoto indeed got rekted by HP.</br>  <br>For the nearly homeless and poor tourists<br><br>Source: A cheap tour of Tokyo lodging in net/manga cafes</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine, because HP got rekt right afterwards in more than one way.</br>  Based High Priest telling characters what we all really think about them all along.  <br> we </br>  <br>This. Just because Touma bullshitted a defense that was basically "she helped by being useless" doesn't mean High Priest wasn't right. Nothing's changed. It's still over.</br>  <br>Only by Noukan. Touma getting angry and replying back was exactly what HP wanted to begin with.</br>  <br>And tries to come back by crashing a comet, but gets BTFO by Noukan afterwards. Wow...This volume has a lot of BTFOs.</br>  <br>a lot of Japanese live in internet cafe since their wage not even enough for cheap apartment</br>   calls Othinus a failure of a Magic God even though she became one by becoming a real god, unlike him who became one by failing to rise to the position of Buddah <br> The only failure here is you, High Faggot.</br>  <br>People didn't want him to become Buddha though because politics.</br>  <br> Doesn't change the fact that he failed.</br>  <br>He is a real god though, just because politics tried to bullshit his righteousness and godliness away, doesn't mean he didn't do it</br>  <br>This<br><br>Humans are morons, HP only wanted to save people.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is failure for HP thought</br>  <br> It's still over. <br><br>What's over? I'm not even sure why HP's opinion matters. They're discussing the difference in power in Touma and Misaka's relationship. If Touma is fine with it and Misaka wants to become better and also still wants Touma in her life...why is HP relevant? He has no say in what they do (especially since he's about to get fisted by the new guy).</br></br></br>  <br> He wanted to become a Buddah. Did he become a Buddah? No. He failed.</br>  <br>Still became a wandering "Buddha" nonetheless</br>  <br>He perfectly ok with results so it isn't fail.</br>  <br>But did he become a God? Yes he succeed.</br>  <br>The procedure was correct. The judges were corrupt.</br>   dat Muginos     You would probably be in for quite a shock if you looked into the origins of Othinus who you keep by your side. <br>What does it means?</br>  <br>I prefer Fre myself.</br>  <br> That's not how it works.<br> He accepted that he couldn't become a Buddah and instead choose to become what humans desired him to be. Accepting failure and moving on isn't the same as not failing.<br><br><br> He didn't want to be a "God", he was trying to become a Buddah.<br><br><br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure.<br><br><br> Yeah, something close to a Buddah but not a true Buddah, which is pretty much the same thing Othinus was before the end of NT8, and he mocked her because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's referring to the how Othinus killed herself to become a Magic God by hanging herself</br>  <br>I think he means the stuff like gouging out her eye hanging herself from the tree and shit like that, I'm not familiar with Norse mythology though so there might be more to it but that's the basic idea</br>  <br>She's a viking she probably did some hardcore shit back in her day</br>  <br>Did Othinus ever tell Touma about how she became a Magic God to begin with?</br>  <br>Can you please spell Buddha correctly?</br>  <br>Well since they went for her eye he knows some of it at least, don't think she mentioned hanging herself though</br>  <br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure. <br>You're mixing the physical procedure to become a Buddha/Magic God with the subjective scoring to acquire the title of Buddha.</br></br>  <br>Thor did back in NT 5.</br>  <br><br>She's a man originally, baby!</br></br>  <br> Yeah, sorry. Should have checked how it was spelled.<br><br><br> But being given the title of Buddha is required to become Buddha. It was even mentioned in that chapter that the reason he became a Magic God instead of just becoming a Buddha was because of those shitty judges.<br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HP is a Buddha thought, the corrupt priests didn't give him a title/name so he's a wandering Buddha referred as "High Priest".</br>  <br>Can you point out where to me? Scanning for her name in it didn't give me much</br>  <br>Guys do make the best girls after all</br>  <br> But he isn't a true/complete Buddha, just like Othinus wasn't a true/complete Magic God.<br> I found it weird that he shitted on her for that.</br></br>  <br>someone need to massage Kinuhata chest</br>  <br>Wasn't he calling her a shit for caring too much about her own world or finding someone who understood her rather than giving no fucks like they did?</br>  <br>She and Mikoto can rub each other's chests</br>  <br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble. <br>Those other "Buddhas" either did the procedure incorrectly or gained their status thanks to politics.</br></br>   “If that girl is keeping you from saying you will destroy my illusions, then she is already tripping you up.” <br>So that's why he didn't say it at all this whole volume.</br>  <br>I think the only time he's said it in all of NT is in NT10.</br>  <br>And what a glorious moment that felt like.</br>  Did Kihara doge appear yet?   However, he did not clench his right fist and try to smash the mummy’s face in. The High Priest had already asked if he honestly thought he could save them all with only Imagine Breaker. <br>HP put Touma on those cautious rails to begin with. It's just more of him trying to break Touma through shifting logic.</br>  <br>She's a failure because she didn't realize what it really meant to be a Magic God and instead "wasted" her power on petty things like destroying world. The exact reasoning went:<br> &gt;Othinus was remarkable yet went a bit too far </br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>Raildex has had ninjas since forever.</br>  <br>Sorry I remembered it wrong. In NT 9 There was an exposition by Kamachi, specifically Ch. 8 Pt.4 to which it was said that Kamijou doesn't know anything about Odin's History. Also in NT10, Othinus only mentioned about her eye in the prologue as a part of her ritual to become a Magic God.</br>    Akasaki Chinatsu's angry voice <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>You haven't read Naruto I take it</br>  <br>Tomorrow</br>  so which Seiyu would be perfekt for High Priest  <br>He mainly meant the summons of frogs and shadow clones thing but...<br><br><br>You do know that it did not originate from Naruto right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah right, yeah I was sure he knew about the eye since they went to go fetch it but wasn't sure where it was said she hung herself from a tree and if he knew, thanks</br>  <br>Ninjas? Yeah, but the summoning of a gigantic frog being a ninja power I'm relatively sure isn't a normal association to make with ninjas</br>  <br>High Priest doesn't strike me as someone capable of being deliberately antagonizing. He has never lied and he always speaks what he truly feels, never wearing any masks, or having any hidden motives.<br><br><br>Thor did say this to a dizzy Touma in NT5 after their one-on-one:<br> &gt;“To befit the original meaning of the name, I headed down a certain path. If that girl hadn’t taken such ridiculous measures to gain knowledge even if she had to pull out one of her eyes and hang herself, I could have stood at the top of Gremlin.” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as how he was, appearance-wise, based on Fate's Matou Zouken, I'd say the guy who voiced him.</br>  <br>Houchu Ohtsuka. He'd do the OHO HOIs perfectly.</br>  <br>lol so I was remembering it right? Dang what's wrong with my brain?</br>  <br>He's already Terra's voice.</br>  <br>Jiraiya is an actual historical ninja. Hell, all three of the old guard come from the same Japanese folktale. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>   Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”   So weren't Kamikotofags supposed to be on suicide watch or something? I don't see it.  <br>Sorry, I was mistaken. NT6, not NT5.</br>  <br>Ninjas actually are associated with summoning things thanks to the legend of Jiraiya. Look it up in Kabuki theater and Japanese mythology.</br>  <br>Shit, I forgot about that. Wakamoto's already taken too, so I guess it's Zouken after all.</br>  <br>Kamikotofags aren't even a thing anymore. If there are some who still seriously ship them, I feel sorry for them.</br>  <br>Why? Touma literally just told everyone he likes having her around</br>  <br>What happen if my way is correct and right and yours is not Kamijou-chan?</br>  <br> everybody talking about magic gods <br> lets bring up that shipping wars shit posting </br></br>  <br>Kamijou's path is always right.</br>  <br>Kamikoto is still very much a thing.</br>  <br>It's alright. But Kamijou still didn't know about Odin's history though, so at the time that was said to him, he had no idea what that meant.</br>  <br><br><br>Well shit you showed me I guess, shows what I know</br></br></br>  <br>Would be awesome to see a Human othinius.She was probable quite awesome.<br>The Magic Gods have one Great problem they don´t take anything seriosly enough.<br>Othinius was different thats way i am expecting that next Volume the Magic Gods are freed and Magic god Othinius as their Leader will finally beginn the MG keikaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Touma check a book out from the library if he knew he was facing One Eyed Othinus eventually</br>  <br> I'd rather talk about Naruto than shipping </br>  <br> Magic Gods <br>You do know that only one is left right</br></br>  <br> MG keikaku <br><br>But True Gremlin is just a glorified and ridiculously powerful Touma Fanclub. They only want TouMAN-senpai to notice them.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still the most popular pairing despite what a very vocal minority thinks.</br>  <br>Magic Gods are great because of how little shits they give though</br>  <br>You do know there were a bunch of Magic Gods in that phase Aleister destroyed right?</br>  <br>Yeah no, after seeing how flawed he is, I will reconsider 2 times if he's right or not.</br>  <br>Why check a book out from the library when your roommate IS a library?<br><br><br>Kamisato killed them all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't count if they're not showing up on earth</br>  <br>That I don't know so I can't help you answer that really good question. In fact, why is Touma not doing any research in the occult at all? He could just ask Index, who started to become irrelevant to thanks to this plot hole(is it?)</br>  <br>It's important to remember that Naruto had extremely few original ideas, a good chunk of the abilities and naming came from Japanese Mythology.</br>  <br/>  I know it's just a quibble, but the height scale seems a bit off.<br>Shouldn't Mugino tower over the others?</br>  <br>Either or really, the point is you'd think the guy who's analyzing his enemies on his feet trying to find a weakness, how their power works or the like, if he has prep time would do at least minimal research into them</br>  <br> The ones mentioned were High Priest, Nephythys. Niang Niang, Zombie and Chimera.<br> So far Zombie is kill and we don't know what happened to Chimera. By the end of this volume only Nep will be left.</br></br>  So AccelxMikoto is Endgame OTP?  <br>Poor HP, that Touma died with NT9.</br>  <br>They're all highschool girls, except for Saiai who should be shorter since she was retconned into being 12, so not really</br>  <br><br> that sisterhood by fellow flat chests <br><br>Brings a tear to my eye.</br></br></br></br>  <br>10032xAccel<br>KakinexMikoto</br></br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>So basically Touma is shitting himself inside but because misaka is there he have a reason not to go despair.<br><br>Basically if. misaka wasnt there he would have given up already.</br></br></br>  <br>The only height we got from her was in OT15, and she was wearing heels + leaning forward. I would estimate her to be a few cm shorter than Accelerator (which is 168).</br>  <br>they are not dead just very far away.<br>I kinof see Kamisato as someone importent but also a reason for Othnius to act.</br></br>  <br> HP sees the events of NT9  <br> sees touma fight a god and refuses to give up despite many deaths <br> and he even comes close to punching her <br> HP hopped that could be him one day <br> finally gets his shot and touma lames it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> given up alread <br>He is Touma.<br>silly anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep apparently index and othinus giving magic side advice would only make it seem more hopeless. Misaka seems to think that means anybody ignorant to magic and easy to talk to could take her place. I don't really like his explanation but at least it filled the plot hole of why he is so cool with magic gods now when he was practically pissing himself with fear last volume.</br>  <br>Basically. Mikoto being there allowed him to be more lighthearted and keep him from despair. She doesn't know shit about magic(and obviously doesn't really care too much), so it put him in a good mood.</br>  <br>I mean, NT12 didn't seem like Othinus was making the situation worse but whatever works for Touma I guess</br>  why Touma did not just accept their offer but refuse their reward?  <br>Because they're being little shits and living their lives incorrectly.</br>  <br>Isn't that sort of torture?</br>  Mikoto BTFO.  <br> He was going full-despair till he found out St Germain was fake, though.</br>  <br> why Touma did not just accept their offer <br>HP would've killed him on the spot.<br><br> If that boy were to give in to him, the High Priest was sure to immediately behead him without a second thought. </br></br></br></br>  <br>In NT it wasn't a god so her telling touma that fixed him right up. right now he is certain HP is a god and othinus would probably tell HP is unbeatable or at least that is why he thinks. Even HP said the only threat to full powered magic god was other magic gods.</br>  <br> Because he wanted nothing to do with a bunch of shits who would give absolute power over the world to a normal highschool boy.</br>  <br>He's ptsd Touma after all, I don't think he knows where the moral line is anymore.</br>  <br>He almost got an even better show with dragons, too.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about the scene just before that, where he lost to Hamazura and he was assuming he was about to go challenge a magic god, Othinus only said "wait did you say Germain" after that. I'm saying during that he didn't act like she was making the situation worse and told her to help him out again in the future if he lost his way</br></br>  <br>I have the biggest boner now. Make it happen Fuyukawa.</br>  <br>If Thor has taught me anything it's that HP just needs to shoot himself to make Touma serious</br>  <br> She wasn't making it worse but she wasn't improving it either.<br> He was going full "GOTTA STOP THIS FAGS FROM CAUSING THE END OF THE WORLD AGAIN" before she told him to calm down and explained him shit.</br></br>  <br>I was counting calming him down from going full despair as helping but maybe that's just me</br>  <br>And Mikoto doesn't seem much taller than Saiai either even though she should be.</br>  <br> Yeah, but the point is that she wouldn't be of help in this situation because this is a legit Magic God.<br> She could only tell him " Yeah, he is genuine, you are fucked" and that's it.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't exactly the kind of calming down that was needed. It was just relief that St. Germain wasn't a real Magic God and he was all "Oh, ok, this isn't as bad as I thought" where if St. Germain actually was, he'd be all "SON OF A BITCH IT'S EXACTLY AS BAD AS I THOUGHT"</br>  <br>Yes, yes we hear hear you</br>  <br>flat</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128421960 <br>That was in response to him losing to Hamazura</br>  <br><br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? <br> So feeling ashamed that you lack strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows <br> itself once you accept what you lack and <br>think about what to do without that strength.”<br>I'll remind you this was before he or Othinus knew Germain wasn't a magic god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine &gt;superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? So feeling ashamed &gt;that you lack <br> strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows itself once you accept what &gt;you lack and <br> think about what to do without that strength.” <br> When he heard that, Kamijou’s eyes finally narrowed softly. <br> He reached a hand toward Othinus and rubbed her small head with his &gt;fingertips. <br> “You are being too friendly, human.” <br> “Sorry. But make sure to remind me.” <br> Kamijou spoke without shame. <br>Sure?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Deliciously so. Fre a best. Though Nda is good too.</br>  didn't know misaka met the ninjas in railgun.<br><br>around what date of the timeline is the current arc?</br></br>  <br>She's talking about Magic Gods though, he wasn't so worried about losing to Hamazura as he was the fallout he was going to create fighting a magic god</br>  <br>Meeting them in a dream doesn't really count, you can't even see his face</br>  <br>No, he said he was weak and she said that he can't be as strong as a Magic God and to accept that he can't do everything.</br>  <br>Frenda a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>She didn't meet them, it just happened to be one of the cards she got.<br><br>Its after Vento's invasion but before Battle Royale.</br></br></br>  <br>~October 4. 5 days before Battle Royale.</br>  <br><br><br>I see.</br></br></br>  <br>yep because index and othinus wouldngive him the cold harsh truth<br><br>Not knowing how fucked up the situation is a bliss afterall.</br></br></br>  What servants outside of Emiya, Cu, Heracles and Arturia have a chance to defeat Dr Gil?

How does that give him a chance, if he couldn't beat Gil in 12 hours then he isn't going to defeat him ever.</br>  All of them. Gil jobs hard.  Against serious Gil only Saber and Bazett.

But I guess that counts for almost every servant.</br>  <br> Chakravartin <br> Saver's minor noble phantasm. The implement that a normally unarmed buddha uses to defeat its opponents. <br> In the Vedic period of ancient India, a chakravartin (turner of the wheel) refers to the ideal ruler. <br> Chakravartin, the noble phantasm, is a seven kilometer long chakram expanding in the sky above the Buddha. <br> While slowly rotating, it fires bolts of light at Servants within the ring. <br> Picture it as being an omnidirectional mobile artillery platform. The ring of light would be a rail, and the artillery platform would move over it. <br> The number of rings increases with each combat turn until there are finally seven of them. The seven rings are synonymous with the seven jewels of the wheel turner. <br> Their appearance is reminiscent of a rainbow, and when the fighting has escalated to its peak speed, "transmigration into one", its ultimate attack from the invocation of its true name, is activated. <br> The rings of light would come clanging against each other to combine into one rapidly spinning ring that would soon turn into that halo-like thing on the back of the celestial buddha Vairocana, then pillars of light amass around the PC Servant from all angles and converge onto it like in a black hole, after which there would be a huge explosion. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missing True Archer, Achilles and Lancelot here.</br>  <br> Amita Amitabha. <br> Saver's major Noble Phantasm. The maximum deployment of Chakravartin. <br> According to the Indian idea of Brahman, all humans are reincarnations of Brahma and all of humanity is the same individual. <br> (There's a tendency for Indian reincarnation to ignore the time axis, so it's stupid to fuss over the details.) <br> When this ideology is embraced, all of mankind will achieve buddhahood. <br> This is because every human being ultimately transmigrates into the Buddha. <br><br> Um "even I don't know what I'm talking about but it's nothing cheap like reincarnation, immortality, it's far more-(?) <br><br> Basically, it's the "Everyone Becomes Me wheel of reincarnation" saving all sattva from suffering. <br>It deals heavy damage that no living thing, no human can take, but the protagonist isn't alive in the first place (spoiler!) so he has a small chance of withstanding it, since the protagonist has yet to be afflicted by the suffering of life or the four noble truths.<br> If the production budget for EXTRA had been ten times higher, I would have put in a gimmick where the protagonist would achieve enlightenment (gain strong convictions) over the course of the game and overcome this attack. <br> In the battle against Saver in the game, it's depicted as an absolute game-over attack that's deployed if you don't finish the battle within a set number of turns. <br> The damage is 5,670,000,000 by the way. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit and i was under the impression that Cu just immediately die since Avalon begins to heal his wound after they get to the graveyard.</br>  Was ever there a Grail War that went right? Like, only one winner and they get their wish fulfilled with no trolling.  <br>Fate Extra had enough overseeing that it went very orderly compared to most, and there was an actual wish granter to be found at the end.<br><br>Though the final master still  dies , but not before speaking his wish.<br><br>Apocrypha almost ended with proper wish making before a dragon carried the grail off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Some servants was screwed by their class or master.<br><br>Diamund as Saber would get him better NP.<br>Lancelot as Saber with ilya.<br>Herakles as Archer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. The grail war is a shame by default.</br>  Power rankings in Fate literally mean jack shit when circumstance dictates all.  <br>This, gil is the king of jobbers. But on the other hand is there any servant that can beat shirou? And i am not talking just about regular shirou I am talking about shirou with the tohsakas family crest AND ultimate blade works.</br>  <br> Lancelot as Saber with ilya. <br>Lancelot Berserker with Illya is far better.<br><br>In order for Lancelot to be nigh unstoppable as a Saber, he needs a Master that can Keikaku, and we have seen that Illya is full retard. Saber Lancelot with Kiritsugu would be sick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The grail war is a twist by default, rather than necessary a troll. Its always going to be some reveals at the end.<br><br>It isn't the cup of christ, but there's never been a grail war where there wasn't a wish granter at the end of the maze in some form. Usually the method of the wish is corrupt, so they have to kill it.<br><br>Its just, its an entire idea that because its a fake holy grail its real, since the real holy grail isn't like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it a rule that they  die  or was it just an unfortunate particular case?</br>  <br> And i am not talking just about regular shirou I am talking about shirou with the tohsakas family crest AND ultimate blade works. <br><br>All of them; if you read the novel or even watched the anime at all you'd know Shirou during the fight with Gilgamesh states in the most matter of fact way "I don't stand shit worth of a chance against any other servant, they'd all kill me instantly, but this guy is an exception. He's just another one trick pony like me who can only spam".<br><br>Shirou proudly at his peak states that any other servant against him there would kill him for sure, since they are a user, rather than just an owner.<br><br>Shirou is an owner, but he can never be a user, he can just match Gilgamesh in that one situation due to compatibility. If you actually think Shirou is servant tier or can match other servants there, you missed a lot of this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it like that in most animes?</br>  <br>it was the particular case. A normal person could have made their wish.</br>  <br>MC was considered an anomaly in the system, any other master wouldn't have died if they had reached the core.<br><br>MC was a computer program that gained sentience, and thus a soul or life of its own as it tried to find humanity and what it meant to be alive. MC himself didn't even know he wasn't a real boy until almost the end of the story. They were able to evade the system from realizing they were a mistake for quite some time, but upon reaching the core the system would analyze them, and deem them just to be something to be deleted. Just another malfunctioned program of sorts.<br><br>He knew this going into the core, but he still had to make his wish.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even fucking taiga could beat gil</br>  <br> Lancelot Berserker with Illya is far better. <br>Lets kick it up a notch.</br></br>  <br>How can you read through these threads and still be unaware of king jobbers best friend and equal in combat?</br>  <br> In the anime, there is a fight scene between Rin and Ilya, but are there any mages who could even win against Ilya in a magecraft fight in the actual 「Fate/stay night」, 「Fate/Zero」, or 「Fate/hollow ataraxia」 games? &lt;ukw&gt; <br><br>Nasu: Frankly, she is the top mage in Fuyuki. Still, first-class mages would follow the "since she's a child of nature, just cut her off from the land first" plan, so it's not like she's invincible. Kayneth and Tokiomi could give her a run for her money. Rin is just relentless. But if we're talking about the dark girl who contaminates the land itself...<br><br>Takeuchi: ...Sakura's magecraft skills are really fit for a boss, aren't they.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so team sakuralot would be a total rape fest?</br>  <br>In contrast to this, there was a far side route to Extra which shows the dark undercurrent which was there all the time during that war, where things get more crazy than any war to date outside of maybe Fate/Strange.</br>  Experienced types trying to shame the virgin  When will nasu write more holy grail wars?<br>I want more bad ass Servants</br>  <br>Six more servants just popped up in Fate Strange<br><br>You'll get to know them in the next novel<br><br>Fate/Strange is much like Zero in the sense its a novel that would be loved a lot, except it isn't adapted by Ufotable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't there a manga of it also?</br>  <br> Implying that being a slut is a good thing </br>  <br>Lancelot with Kiritsugu would be the equivalent of Batman with prep time.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's covered most of the first novel so far. Barely any translations out yet though.</br>  <br>It seriously sounds like Emiya could be construed as a direct counter to this guy.<br>- Not a hero<br>- Access to endless forms of attack<br>- Fighting style is constructed to reduce the effectiveness of martial fighting styles<br>- This life has no meaning; this life has already been lost and saved; post-human</br></br></br></br></br>   There will never be a holy grail war where Satan is the servant of the MC <br> She will never be genderswapped and actually be called something cute like Lucifera. <br> Jesus will never be summoned later as well as the servant of the main antagonist <br><br>Nasu, and perhaps even Urobutcher, please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well buddha have been summoned in Fate extra</br>  <br><br>No it wouldn't retard. Kiritsugu with Avalon already feels like shitting his guts out using Accel.<br><br>With Lancelot, Kiritsugu will feel like he is shitting his entire insides out and not just his guts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiritsugu doesn't need to use Accel, just make keikakus. Kiritsugu is the mind, Lancelot is the body.</br>  <br>We're talking about Saber Lancelot.

With ufo doing UBW and churning out a HF movie, its not likely for them to make a Fate route adaptation due to having a fair amount of same events going on in the beginning, right?<br><br>Or is a Fate adaption still on the table? From anyone I mean, not just ufo.</br></br>  <br>What does that even mean?</br>  <br>How newfag are you?<br><br>There's super obvious shit like Jason and the Argonauts.<br><br>There are also the Eight Immortals, human beings that reach the pinnacle of humanity and transcended.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think so. <br>Fighting is like foreplay to them.</br></br>   Gilgamesh sighed with exasperation. <br> “Are you going on about that again? You haven’t changed, even in death.” <br> “Meanwhile, you’ve been reborn as a living tyrant.” <br> The retort to Gilgamesh, who had been called a wise king in his youth, was equally sarcastic. But it too contained no animosity. <br> “Indeed. If my childhood self knew of my current state, I daresay he’d commit suicide.” <br> Gilgamesh spoke so casually compared to the time when he had manifested in the cave that one might wonder if he was a different person. If the magi that knew his usual attitude saw this now, they would probably be wondering why the androgynous Heroic Spirit hadn’t been killed yet. <br> The reasons were many, but there was one objective factor in particular that a skeptical magus would probably accept — though, this reason actually didn’t even register in Gilgamesh’s mind. <br> Even for the King of Heroes, this opponent could not be easily killed. <br> Such was the strength of this Heroic Spirit. <br> Anyone who had observed their clash would agree. <br> And, the children’s game still wasn’t over. <br> Still in Gilgamesh’s hand, Ea’s blade once again began rotating, and the space behind Gilgamesh began lighting up as if in response. <br> “Is that so? In your childhood, if you were the boy the Shamhat described, I think you would have chosen to live. Not for the future, but for the citizens of Uruk who were still alive in that moment.” <br> Countless tentacles stirred from the sand, as if they were a part of Enkidu’s body. <br> Seeing this, Gilgamesh again used his Noble Phantasm to float into the sky. Then, his treasury — the King’s Treasures — opened in the space behind him, and dozens, then hundreds of Noble Phantasms emerged. <br> Simultaneously, the ends of Enkidu’s earth tentacles transformed into countless different weapons, from spears, to swords, to bows. <br> One breath later, over a thousand projectiles thundered into each other. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   The cacophony of clashing metal rang out over the windy battlefield. <br> Only two Heroic Spirits stood there. <br> Still, the clash between the two Heroic Spirits, each an army unto himself, was so violent that it could only be called a battlefield. <br> The collected Noble Phantasms of the most ancient hero, said to be the prototypes of all Noble Phantasms, were innumerable. <br> Weapons that would be the ultimate trump cards of ordinary Heroic Spirits were shot forth without reserve. <br> To counter this, Enkidu became one with the earth, transformed the body given to him by the gods, and created countless divine weapons. <br> It was a furious, inexhaustible exchange of ultimate attacks. <br> The paradoxical scene illustrated the how well matched their friendship was. <br> The conversation had been cut short again, but neither was upset by this. <br> It was enough for them to be here together, in this place. <br> Whether it was a match of wits through words, or a fight to draw blood, all were worthwhile “conversation” to both of them </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Deus ex machina, plot armor or whatever you want to call it. What i am trying to say is the writing isn't very good.</br>  <br>Then the sweaty cuddling after would be the sex.</br>  <br>Not really. Maybe in 10 years or more.<br>There's just too much type-moon to adapt, they can't go back to Fate route.</br></br>  <br>Also Deen's Fate is ok. They messed up in the middle episodes but they nailed everything else. Also the OST is truly beautiful.<br>If you don't want to read the VN then yeah it's an OK choice, not great or anything, just OK.</br></br>  <br> they can't go back to the Fate route <br>Uuuugh why? It's the route everyone played and I just feel like it needs more love.</br></br>  <br> Gil says he has an artifact he could use against Gawain <br>Didn't Gawain beat him without Numeral in CCC?<br> Lancelot + five other Servants by himself in a single night. <br>If serious. He gets fucked without EA as explained by Prisma Illya. Kayneth entry also confirms Lancelot can beat him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its the one that got literally all the love and advertisement for about ten years, they move onto other routes after ten years, and the fans there immediately start complaining like they were shafted. Not the center for a month and then its immediately complaining that you were never loved.<br><br>Its had way more love than the others. They could give it a new rendition eventually, but not because it was ever lacking in love or attention.<br><br>Its so damn lopsided already how much this one has received over the others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention Saber is the poster girl of type and ther</br>  <br>And Saber is the poster girl of Type-Moon who also serves as a constant reminder of her route.</br>  <br> he could kill Lancelot + five other Servants by himself in a single night. <br>Never even implied it all of them together, just that he could win the Grail in a night, and only if he was serious.</br></br>  <br>people do know arturia is a little girl right<br><br>why does she look so old</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, I wasn't around for that. Only got into Fate last year, Tsukihime before that, but I just put off Fate for so long. Guess I should've gotten into the game sooner.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh slept for 2000 years before contracting in CCC, so all of his stats and abilities had rusted entirely as he can only laugh about it a bit while saying its Hakuno's job to bring him back up to his true glory. He can't even use his gates properly at first, he has to start out CCC as a low ranked E stat servant, and work his way up to not sucking.<br><br>You have an optional battle with Gawain as he was in the original Extra, or something like that, except in CCC you have to fight him like that near the first dungeon of the game. Needless enough you usually aren't supposed to win that fight in the first cycle through that game<br><br>You can do the NG+ option while retaining your stats and demolish him easily, but the first time around you're supposed to get fucked as your servant is still weak at that point.<br><br>Its because Hakuno borrows some money from Leo, and he sends Gawain to go collect on you.<br><br><br> He gets fucked without EA as explained by Prisma Illya. <br><br>Prism isn't really an example. Its explained in TM works that aren't Prism, that serious Gilgamesh isn't just "Pull out Ea", but rather "Pull out the most effective thing to kill someone, like their weakness".<br><br>Gilgamesh threatens Gawain with the "Shroud of Night" which can rid him of his power. Serious Gilgamesh just pulls out the most effective tool to kill what's in front of him, kind of like how Ko Gil just pulls out the weapon most effective.<br><br>Sometimes that's Ea, but its not necessarily Ea. Its not the most effective way to hunt rabbits with a nuke, when rabbit seeking missiles are just as good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because fanart/shipping.</br>  <br>You missed everything</br>  <br>Fucking christ.<br><br>I saw all these Fate threads on /a/ and didn't understand a damn thing that was going on. So I decided to read the VN and understand what the hell was being talked about, cause you all looked like you were having so much fun. <br><br>Then you tell me this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Achilles. One of his NP's would separate Gilgamesh from GoB, and Gil is bad at fighting compared to Heroic Spirits.</br>  <br>It seems especially true in Fate. It seems like every other Servant could win the entire war if they didn't have a shitty master, are under the effect of a Command Seal, or just don't feel like it.</br>  <br>Well, you can probably still catch up on parts of it or at least hear about them.<br><br>Its like when you're born into the world in the modern age. Sure you missed out on the Medieval times, also all the other things that happened before this inlcuding the great ones, and you weren't around for robot wars and space exploration quite yet, but you were still here for the computer age.<br><br>Systems haven't wiped over how the internet works quite yet by white washing it, so its still a bit like the wild west in here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You have an optional battle with Gawain as he was in the original Extra, or something like that, except in CCC you have to fight him like that near the first dungeon of the game. Needless enough you usually aren't supposed to win that fight in the first cycle through that game <br>Is NG+ even canon? I seriously doubt gameplay can be taken as canon. If you lost during the original storyline it was for a reason.<br><br> Prism isn't really an example. Its explained in TM works that aren't Prism, that serious Gilgamesh isn't just "Pull out Ea", but rather "Pull out the most effective thing to kill someone, like their weakness". <br>Have fun pulling out something like that against someone who never lost and wasn't killed by a NP. Gate spam alone apparently wouldn't work. He could throw some stuff like Gae Dearg, but it is unknown how that would work against an actual corrupted NP. He can still just catch that weapon anyways and do whatever, BP if he wants.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you lost during the original storyline it was for a reason. <br><br>What part of optional is hard to get, you don't even have to fight him. Its only if you borrow money for Leo to buy a certain expensive item from the item shop early on that's way too expensive for the first run early on, and necessary for the True route.<br><br>and yes the NG+ is canon, since the true ending is only achived after you've gone through some ending before. Kind of like with Steins Gate or Ever17.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Have fun pulling out something like that against someone who never lost and wasn't killed by a NP. <br><br>He has the weakness of all heroes, that's why he's stated to be the Servant Killer in the data books. Not because of Ea like some people think, but because he's the origin of all legends, thus he has their weakness in some form.<br><br>He doesn't just have NPs in his vault, he has everything. Wine, food, books, artifacts, art, etc.<br><br>Someone is bound to be weak against something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What part of optional is hard to get, you don't even have to fight him. <br>But if you do he wrecks you. Isn't Gilgamesh in CCC also a buffed version of himself? He isn't even restrained by Class anymore. How do the Gate power even scales with Gil level anyways, doesn't that go against the Gate whole point?</br></br>  <br>Literally the most baller motherfucker in the history of mankind.<br><br> At least 505 confirmed kills during the Winter War <br> Winter War was only about 100 days long <br> He killed about 5 people a fucking day <br> During the fucking winter in -40C weather <br> Preferred iron sights over scopes <br> Put snow in his mouth to prevent his breath from steaming <br> Packed the snow around him to prevent it from puffing up when he shoots <br> Soviets tried bombing the fuck out of the forests just for him <br> Stray shell knocks him out cold <br> He awakes during the fucking day they declare peace <br> Lives to 96 <br><br>Guess he would be too OP of an Archer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   all this people taking seriously the 3rd higuest ranked porn picturebook   <br>Someone is bound to be weak against something.<br><br>Can Gilgamesh defeat pic related, then?</br></br></br>  <br> every fate thread, without fail <br>sausage, anon.</br></br>  <br> Someone is bound to be weak against something. <br>Unless Guinivere counts as a NP then he really has nothing besides EA, as Lancelot was never defeated or killed by a NP. We don't even know how Gae Dearg type weapons work against KoH corrupting an opponent NP, they certainly wouldn't get sliced in 2.</br></br>  <br>Is she a mongoloid?<br><br>  are YOU a mongoloid? </br></br></br>  <br> Isn't Gilgamesh in CCC also a buffed version of himself? <br><br>Gilgamesh in CCC starts out as an E rank loser who's far below any other version of himself, so that he can experience what its like to be an underdog. He's gotta learn some humility to reach the heavens. Can't even use his skills or pull things out properly early on, he's too rusty. Skills have to unlock as he goes on, you talk about treating gameplay canon, something more canon than him losing in an optional fight he's not supposed to take on until the true ending, is his master having a conversation with him after their first few battles about "What is this, I thought you were supposed to be incredible but you're so weak" and Gilgamesh just having to laugh it off and agree for now. That shit isn't optional compared to what you're talking about.<br><br>Then he gets back up to his normal power, and he can dominate again.<br><br>Then he goes far beyond his normal power, and obtains the power of the origin of the planet and stuff. Ends up fighting Aristotle like beings and taking on the universe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Pretty sure he's still weak to raining NPs down on his ass. He could barely keep up at 16, just increase the Gate to 50 and nail him.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh :: …Completely blunted. It was a 2000 year sleep indeed. Was it not so simple to awaken? <br><br> …? Gilgamesh looks strange. We valiantly crushed that enemy program, but he makes a face as if we’d been defeated. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: –Well. Hakuno, you are to smile, and listen. It seems a thousand years of languor have cursed me. Unfortunately, my body has fallen into a dismal condition. <br><br> Wait, he’s telling me now he’s lost his power? I mean, wouldn’t that be a problem from the beginning? Why is he so incredibly full of himself, then!? <br><br> Gilgamesh :: You don’t need to panic like that. I slept in the netherworld for nearly an eternity. It’s no wonder that my mind and body have grown dull. What, it’s fortuitous for you. I do possess an elixir of youth, but I have no desire return to the past. I don’t care to restore this weakened body by my own power. Therefore, rejoice. Your task for the present shall be the treatment of your king’s body. You may devote all your abilities as a Master to my rehabilitation. <br><br>That's part of it, when Gilgamesh first realizes it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to pull out a weakness, he just pull weapons that's most effective like his battle against Saber in Fate.</br>  <br>Then later when Hakuno realizes just what this means<br><br> Gilgamesh :: A shabby room. It’s quite far from a king’s sleeping quarters, but for you it’s suitable. Well, I suppose cursing at cheap lodgings is one of the pleasures of travel. I’m not dissatisfied. I will use this chair. You can curl up in that nice-looking blind spot in the corner and sleep there. <br><br> ……well then. Before, I might have reluctantly obeyed in the face of his haughty attitude. But it’s different now. Though it was only shortly, I’ve the battle screen, and the King of Heroes’ hold over me has declined. Which is to say, what is with those stats? If I don’t bring it up this will never be settled. Anyway, it’s a problem that affects my personal survival. <br><br> I take a deep breath, muster all my strength, and turn to meet Gilgamesh’s eyes. <br><br>[&gt;] For someone so weak to talk so big is embarrassing.<br><br>Gilgamesh :: Mm. — I suppose so.<br><br> “I suppose so,” my foot. Just tell me. Even Leo said that Gilgamesh is an extraordinary Servant, but the Moon Cell’s speculation on that extraordinary power has crashed so hard, we might as well be in an oil crisis. Gilgamesh’s anecdotes aside, I won’t be able to accept this until some actually explains to me how he got to be this weak. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: …hm. It’s true, how this weakening came about is some only I can know. There’s nothing else for it, wait a moment. <br><br> So saying, Gilgamesh snaps his fingers. As he does so, the air ripples as if boiling, and a drinking vessel appears. There’s no mistaking it, it’s wine and a wine glass. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: What, it’s a simple story. I have manifested as Servant in the same way as the other heroic spirits. On the theme of “participate in the Holy Grail War held by the Moon Cell.” But my power was too great. What the Moon Cell wanted was not the strongest Master, but the last surviving Master. If I had been present, the result would have been decided from the beginning, so I was not allowed to enter the Holy Grail War. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just imagining Gilgamesh Nui.</br>  <br> Then he gets back up to his normal power, and he can dominate again. <br>So, can that version beat Gawain without Numeral?<br><br> taking on the universe. <br>Wasn't he a confirmed shit tier when compared to the beings of the Planets at the end of CCC?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Debunked by Iskander and Saber, also debunked in Prisma Illya and him being able to beat Gil according to Kayneth entry also proves it wrong.</br>  <br>Except his enemy can take that and use it against him. This is nothing like the Saber fight.</br>  <br>You fight Gawain near the first dungeon of the game as stated earlier, so he's still pretty weak.<br><br>Nasu says Gilgamesh when serious wouldn't lose to any servants so much or that he's the strongest, you think he's going to just say "Except Gawain" now? He has to create a buffer excuse for this, and that excuse is that Gilgamesh is still weakened.<br><br>At the end of the game when traveling to a new planet, he's considered just a newbie level 1 in this new adventure together. This isn't just in a literal sense however, but its also to say he has no idea what's going to happen and even the AUO is such a small thing to what they'll soon be experiencing.<br><br>He's nothing but a beginner wanderer now, starting over for real together on completely unexplored territory. Gilgamesh shows the face of a child in front of this new adventure which seems to match his dreams of reaching the stars, as he's wished for humanity to always achieve.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Which is to say, what is with those stats? <br>Gilgamesh power comes from the Gate though, not his stats.</br></br>  <br>They couldn't though.<br>The stronger you are the less likely Gil is to go full retard.</br></br>  <br> Nasu says Gilgamesh when serious wouldn't lose to any servants so much or that he's the strongest <br>Gilgamesh is only the strongest of proper Servants if he is serious, this shit doesn't apply to everyone.<br><br> At the end of the game when traveling to a new planet, he's considered just a newbie level 1 in this new adventure together. <br>So he is indeed shit tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Though they're still probably shit compared to these aliens which have overcome their home planet, since humanity hasn't done shit.<br><br><br>His body and mind are both rusty, he himself says he's so weak compared to what he was. He didn't say "It doesn't matter since I can just gates", he says "Man I'm so weak, its your job to get me back in shape now".<br><br>He needs his body and mind to use his gates optimally, just like how he needs his key. His gates aren't just automatic. its not just stats, but everything is rusty for him after an endless amount of time asleep in the abyss. You can say its bullshit all you want but that is what happened. Stats are just a visual way of showing how low he's sunk, and needs to get some exercise back in to use his shit properly again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These aliens have overcome Aristotles, overcome their planet.<br><br>I think everything so far is shit tier to them.</br></br></br>   you have to be protected by plot armor and luck to survive Lancer's NP, even if you manage to survive that and retaliate by using your greatest technique, you will be fragarach'ed by his master <br><br>Bazett and Lancer are truly the best master/servant pairing</br></br>  <br>Buddha is a Solar System ruler.</br>  <br>  I don’t care to restore this weakened body by my own power. Therefore, rejoice. Your task for the present shall be the treatment of your king’s body. You may devote all your abilities as a Master to my rehabilitation. <br>His body, he mentioned mind once too but that doesn't seem to be an issue if all he is gonna do is Gate spam.<br><br> He needs his body and mind to use his gates optimally <br>Not for Gate spam which is what he does 99% of the time.<br><br> You can say its bullshit all you want but that is what happened. <br>He only mentioned his mind and body being rusty, not his overall power with the Gate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The group that Karna fought against in his myth. Any of the Three Kingdoms factions.</br>  <br> These aliens have overcome Aristotles <br>Why are aliens always so superior?</br></br>  <br> His body, he mentioned mind once too but that doesn't seem to be an issue if all he is gonna do is Gate spam. <br><br>As said before, he needs his mind to use his gates. You think they're just automatic? Spamming wouldn't really do much to most servants anyway unless they're a loser, he's more dangerous when he applies himself and spams the right things, like against Berserker.<br><br>In CCC he tends to pull things out of his vault one by one rather than just spamming, which is much more dangerous, which is much more akin to serious Gilgamesh. Like when he does it in Fate route against Arthuria. Spamming is just going "I don't care", he's dangerous when he pulls out specific things the most.<br><br> Not for Gate spam which is what he does 99% of the time. <br><br>He controls his gates with his mind, and to be in peak mental and physical condition for himself is a bit necessary. Otherwise he gets his ass beaten the first time around by dragon idols, Alter Egos, demi gods, and whatever else he fights in CCC the first time around. He eventually gets revenge against them all, but first battle against each usually doesn't go well. When he fights Karna he seems to be back to his true self just about, but early on its clear enough he's lacking.<br><br>You think serious or regular Gilgamesh would lose to a dragon idol loli? Yet he says he can't currently match her because his condition is degraded, so he can't optimally use his power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they represent an idea of what we could be, if we didn't suck so much.<br><br>Humanity has the potential</br></br></br>  <br> You think they're just automatic? <br>They seem to be, he just increases the numbers as he sees fit. Doesn't seem like much brain is put into it.<br><br> In CCC he tends to pull things out of his vault one by one rather than just spamming <br>Which is why he seems to be boosted. If the Zero or FSN tried that shit on Gawain he would be dead unless he was constantly spamming the Gate in order to keep Gawain busy.<br><br> You think serious or regular Gilgamesh would lose to a dragon idol loli? <br>I wouldn't think King Arthur would be a midget girl either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems Gil's favorite things to pull out are an ancient machine gun, axe of the road, and certain twin swords that turn into a bow called Enki.<br><br>During special attacks he'll open a gate<br><br>However in order to open multiple gates he has to level up quite a bit, to unlock his skills again.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5ki<wbr>AcwtcfJ4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br> Which is why he seems to be boosted. If the Zero or FSN tried that shit on Gawain he would be dead unless he was constantly spamming the Gate in order to keep Gawain busy. <br><br>Same logic you'd say it wouldn't work against Arthur in Fate route, but the strangeness of the weapons he pulls out puts anyone on edge so they can't simply ignore the attacks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey fags riddle me this, if Archer is the bone of his sword, what kind of skeleton is he?<br>One big skelesword, an unlimited pile of swords that walks, a part RM skeleton that shits swords, dust and giant gears everywhere or something completely different?</br>  <br> an unlimited pile of swords that walks <br>P much this.</br></br>  <br> Same logic you'd say it wouldn't work against Arthur in Fate route, but the strangeness of the weapons he pulls out puts anyone on edge so they can't simply ignore the attacks. <br>That Saber was extremely weakened, and unlike Gilgamesh, her strength actually comes from herself. There is a reason why he ran like a bitch during UBW instead of trying that shit again.</br></br>  <br>A sword that freezes anything it touches, a sword that goes through armor as though it was nothing like Diarmund's lance, the swords he pulled out against her even with her superior skills could only cause her to retreat a bit or play cautious. Their effects were just too strange that she couldn't prepare for each one.<br><br>If you know your opponent can pull out anything with any effect, its because you can't gauge them no matter what you do that the mind games you do to yourself start to even weigh on you.<br><br>You can't gauge this man's potential, so you focus more on defense, some instinct inside of you tells you that advancing won't be easy. He was ready to do the same to her in UBW, but he could only laugh how it turned out with Shirou telling her she wasn't needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Types are Ultimate.</br>  she'd just Witch Time between GoB spam, and then finish him with a QTE.<br><br>literally infallible as a servant</br></br>  <br>Excluding types, are there aliens on other planets within the solar system?</br>  <br>Types are the strongest of their planet, they are the ultimate ones of their planet, but that's they limit. They are things beyond their tiers that have not been seen to date, that have only been alluded to. These are people, these aliens, they have overcome their home planets, and reached out towards the stars just as Gaia was afraid humanity would do eventually.<br><br>Conceptually you gain certain advantages if you go beyond your planet as well, and are no longer bound by its concepts.</br></br></br>  <br> , are there aliens on other planets within the solar system? <br><br>Closest alien hub world is 1500 light years away, as shown in CCC. A hub world of travelers from different parts of the galaxy that have gone past their world, and blah blah.</br></br></br>  <br> A sword that freezes anything it touches, a sword that goes through armor as though it was nothing like Diarmund's lance, the swords he pulled out against her even with her superior skills could only cause her to retreat a bit or play cautious. Their effects were just too strange that she couldn't prepare for each one. <br>The problem is using that shit against someone far above you like Gawain. There is something called Speedblitz, you know.<br><br> He was ready to do the same to her in UBW <br>No he wasn't he backed off because he knew the difference in power at that distance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They are things beyond their tiers that have not been seen to date, that have only been alluded to. <br>Buddha is a Solar System ruler. He is above the aliens.</br></br>  <br> someone far above you like Gawain. <br><br>You don't seem to know much about Fate<br><br> As no proper Heroic Spirit can match this man, he could be called the "Servant Killer". <br> Without a doubt, he is the strongest existence amongst the Servants. <br> Though he lost due to obsession against Saber… <br> Though he lost due to pride against Shirou… <br> Though he lost due to carelessness against XXXXX… <br> …the fact of the matter is that if he actually gets serious, he is a Servant that cannot be rivaled. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vergil literally has the Muramasa blade a weapon that can counter abilities like God hand hard. <br>Vergil also has summoned Swords that can counter GoB<br>Vergil has Yamato a blade that can cut through anything even a full Excaliblast into pieces.</br></br></br>  <br> ancient machine gun <br>Isn't that a drill? Why would he use a Machine gun at that distance, is he retarded.</br></br>  <br>Neither do you, he is a Servant killer because of the Gate, not because of himself, using those items at that range is suicide. The shitter can barely hold back a ginger kid at close range.<br><br>Talking about stats here. Gawain is far above him. If he tries to do that shit he should be dead before his attack has hit Gawain.</br></br></br>  <br>Types aren't the strongest of their planets, they ARE the planets. The strongest lifeforms on the solar system. This is a canon fact.</br>  <br>1500 light years isn't the solar system anymore<br><br>That's where all the beings that have overcome their planet are hanging out.</br></br></br>  <br>But most Importantly Vergil has  a bigger dick .</br>  <br> Vergil has Yamato a blade that can cut through anything even a full Excaliblast into pieces. <br>What if Yamato vs Arondight.</br></br>  <br>But he's right. Your speedblitz horseshit isn't nearly as big a factor as you believe. Whether you like it or not, you can't set apart Gilgamesh and the Gate.</br>  <br>If he can barely deal with Shirou at close what the fuck makes you think he can handle Gawain at close?</br>  <br>I guess the humans from Muv Luv are also superior to Types since they ran to another solar system? Nah, that's not how it works. Symbolically surpassing the planet by going somehwere else =/= becoming stronger than the planet even as a collective.<br><br>The Types had against the ropes a completely different breed of humanity far stronger and with more military might than they could ever hope to get normally.</br></br></br>  <br>What if you screw up and summon Vorgil instead?</br>  <br> Whether you like it or not, you can't set apart Gilgamesh and the Gate. <br>Actually, you can, this is the only reason why Gil even has a chance against 30% Arc.</br></br>  <br>Not because of his gates but because what's inside the gates, in the same way he's not dangerous because of spamming, but because he has the weaknesses of everyone in his vault. Since he is the origin of heroes he has the weakness of all heroes, which is why conceptually he is above them.<br><br>He's not the worst guy to fight because he can spam, as very few servants are killed by that alone, except Caster. Even True Archer in F/S calls spamming as pussy shit that only a loser would be killed by, people can't seem to realize that's not his real danger.<br><br>His danger is when he's taking it seriously and pulling out specific things, or shooting very specific things at you. Things that would really fuck you up in particular.<br><br>Its noted that Gilgamesh has the ability to gauge the talents and weakness of those he fights very well, he can tell what would be most effective against them, and in most cases can realize who they are or what legendary craft would supersede them.<br><br>Its not just pulling out what killed them in life, but also the origin of their weapons, or something they're not suited to fight. Like when Shirou pulled out Caliburn, so Gilgamesh was like "That legend really dates back to a German tale about a sword stuck in a tree, and here's the unnamed prototype of the sword that influenced that legend" which destroys Caliburn.<br><br>He's the worst guy against proper servants because he's their origin, he has everything about them since conceptually he's their basis. Its kind of his entire concept, he's the original one so he has everything they have and is the basis for it all. Their strengths, their weakness, he owns it all. When he really starts exploring just how deep his vault can go, that's when the enemy is pretty fucked, rather than just spam.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hitler or Stalin.</br>  <br>A second Gil?</br>  <br>We already decided this<br>Devil May Cry Dante = Dante<br>DmC "Dante" = Donte<br>Devil May Cry Vergil = Vergil<br>DmC "Vergil" = Vergin</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the reason is because Arc scales to Gil himself and not his armory. She loses exactly because you shouldn't exclude GoB from the equation.</br>  <br>They pass through each other, Vergil survives the slash, Lancelot splits in half while whining to some weird imaginary girls called Irisviel and Zecchan in his insanity about muh Arthur.<br>Or nothing happens, and motivated Vergil wins anyway and gets some pizza. Poor knight just isn't crazy and versatile enough to handle a Son of Sparda.</br></br>  <br>what if Witch Time vs. Gae Bulge?<br> an ability that warps time to dodge before an attack even happens <br>versus<br> an attack that warps time and space to hit before it even happens. </br></br></br></br>  <br>He stands more than a chance. She's the one who's fighting an awfully uphill battle, according to Nasu.</br>  <br>Isn't it because he had something very effective against 30% Arc in his GoB?</br>  <br>Gae Bolg vs Fragglerock</br>  <br> why Gil even has a chance against 30% Arc. <br> Even has a chance <br><br>It's not "Even has a chance", its "Arc even has a chance there"<br><br>She's the one fighting uphill without a paddle.<br><br> A. In the definition of Arcueid's strength, there's this thing where "her output changes according to her opponent". As an absolute order taken from her backup, the planet, she is allowed only an output a little stronger than her opponent. And. Single entity abilities of Arc and Servants are roughly on the same level <br><br> Servants use their respective Noble Phantasms while Arc uses her unlimited backup to fight, and differences occur depending on affinity. A simple-is-best Arc is an all rounder, and so generally her chances of winning are only high, but there are those opponents that she just has helplessly awful compatibility with. <br><br> For example, in cases where even if the guy's stats are about the same as Arc, he has a ridiculously large number of weapons with high versatility. As the amount Arc is allowed to take out is based on "single entity ability", against types like Gil-sama, well, you see? <br><br> And the "5 Servants + a" line is a comparison of simple "firepower". Like with the "corpses", foot soldier level opponents aren't going to be avoiding their attacks, so the ones who'd have the advantage are the ones who have more weapons. The reason why Servants excellent at one-on-one combat didn't stand out in Broad Bridge was because of this. Also, for normal Arc, she would get approximately the equivalent of 2 Servants single entity stats. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because she can't get backup against GoB, just Gil himself. She gets blown out by its versatility.</br>  <br> Since he is the origin of heroes he has the weakness of all heroes, which is why conceptually he is above them. <br>What if there is no weakness to begin with?<br><br> Even True Archer in F/S calls spamming as pussy shit that only a loser would be killed by, people can't seem to realize that's not his real danger. <br>Not talking about spamming. He can easily use that shit at a distance. Why the fuck risk going to the face of someone who can wreck you in less than a second.<br><br> Its noted that Gilgamesh has the ability to gauge the talents and weakness of those he fights very well, he can tell what would be most effective against them, and in most cases can realize who they are or what legendary craft would supersede them. <br>Isn't that only if he is serious? He has failed to gauge his opponent many times, an example of this is Shirou. With Lancelot he had to ask Kariya to know his identity.<br><br> Its not just pulling out what killed them in life, but also the origin of their weapons, or something they're not suited to fight <br>What about NPs that aren't inside the Gate like Avalon or stuff that's part of the body like KoH or God Hand?<br><br> He's the worst guy against proper servants because he's their origin, <br>Most shit after the 3rd War is not proper.<br><br>Going back to the point though, he can use the weakness at a distance. There is no way FSN or Zero Gil could just go to Gawain face and hit him. Or Karna. He just sucks at close range, he should stay that range he is most effective at.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, so the power comes from the Gate, not Gil. She loses because Gil power is not himself.<br><br><br> It's not "Even has a chance", its "Arc even has a chance there" <br>What I meant was that if Gil and the Gate were one and the same Arc would still fuck his shit up because she would scale. Since Gil and the Gate are 2 different things, she gets BTFO.</br></br></br></br></br>  So Gilgamesh vs EMIYA <br>who win?</br>  <br>EMIYA.</br>  <br>GoB is a part of Gil. You're just splitting his physical capabilities with his Noble Phantasms. You're always going to get the full package, not one without the other. It's a silly distinction.</br>  <br>Obviously EMIYA, his disarming smile always hits the mark without missing a beat.</br>  <br> What if there is no weakness to begin with? <br><br>Everything has a weakness, even if people don't think so or say "It didn't die from blank", it still has a weakness. Gawain's main weakness is his haughty and heated nature, which blinds him and makes him sloppy at times. That's not the biggest physical weakness, but if you were to say that then you're really underestimating how much stuff is inside GoB. If there's a technique for something, then there's almost surely an NP that correlates. He's said to have the origins of all NPs, even it wasn't something he collected in life, since he's their origin. It's a conceptual thing, his vault is the origin of human ingenuity after all.<br><br> Isn't that only if he is serious? He has failed to gauge his opponent many times, an example of this is Shirou. With Lancelot he had to ask Kariya to know his identity. <br><br>He realized Archer was a danger and took him out immediately, its just that his pride wouldn't allow him to say that this normal human who didn't even know how his ability worked was also a danger. It would be silly if he did in a way, since it was a real long shot, and he's a servant. Lancelot has an ability that disguises his abilities and identity, if you didn't know.<br><br>He was willing to admit Archer could stop him, which is why he took him out after checking him out once, but he didn't want to say the same about Shirou, it would just be too damning for him even if he knew his ability.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GoB being versatile does nothing for Gil capabilities by himself. He would still get BTFO if he tried to get close to Gawain or Karna without using Gate spam as a distraction.</br>  <br>So it's like the Citadel?Cool. This is slightly off topic but doesn't Gil only bring Hakuno there while the rest of humanity is left behind?</br>  <br>Depends which Gilgamesh<br><br> Natural enemy:  <br>None (Zero)<br>Archer (stay night)<br>None (CCC)<br><br>Officially that's where it stands, and natural enemies were listed in CCC even if those people never met in the game, and he even fought EMIYA in the game. Meaning if EMIYA was his weakness there it would have been listed.<br><br>Serious Gilgamesh who doesn't fuck around and has decent support, he's not as weak as Haughty Gilgamesh who just lets you put up your reality marble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but doesn't Gil only bring Hakuno there while the rest of humanity is left behind? <br><br>Yes<br><br>Gilgamesh's hope is that they'll all reach the stars eventually, but he also doesn't care enough to lose sleep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He means that someone with enough physical stats would fuck Gil up because he is still limited by his own average stats.</br>  Jesus because he can do anything  <br>What's your point? There is no "if." Arc's problem is that she simply can't scale to NPs like that, and NPs are what make Heroic Spirits so formidable in the first place. She was never going to fuck his shit up at 30% and you still can't have Gil without GoB.</br>  <br> own average stats. <br><br>Gilgamesh has some of the higher stats to date<br><br>Its mostly A and B</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't he lend humanity a spacecraft of his so that they can maybe disassemble it and figure it out? That would speed up the process significantly. Was there an explanation as to why he didn't do something like this or did he just not think things through? For a guy who really wants to help humanity reach the stars he doesn't really seem to be helping much.</br>  <br> Everything has a weakness, even if people don't think so or say "It didn't die from blank", it still has a weakness. <br>I don't see how the fuck a personality can now be used as NP.<br><br> If there's a technique for something, then there's almost surely an NP that correlates. <br>He has not shown anything close to God Hand or KoH, or Amita Amitabha, or, well, you get the point.<br><br> but he didn't want to say the same about Shirou, it would just be too damning for him even if he knew his ability. <br>Then why be so surprised when he got BTFO if he knew the danger already? Besides, Shirou is not the only case, look at True Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC Gil is cheating, he isn't even restricted to a class there, he is his own class.<br>It's like if you bring Heracles in a class named Heracles where he is more powerful than berserker Heracles, he would probably even win against archer Gil.<br>So, archer Gil loses to EMIYA.</br></br></br>  <br>Stats and fighting skill. Gawain would definitely fuck his shit up at close range, so why risk it. He backed off the moment he saw UBW Saber.</br>  <br>You're moving your goalposts. Gil supporting himself with the Gate at close range was the point.</br>  <br>But he isn't, he is taking shit one by one and going close without being supported by the Gate.</br>  If Lancelot or David take the Key for the Gate, who has control over the Gate, Gil or David/Lancelot? Does it split?  <br>His stats are far from average. I can see that people get the idea from how Gil mostly just sprays and prays, but that's stupid.</br>  Smexy.  <br>He had the Gate primed with a number of weapons with hazardous abilities. He wasn't firing it carelessly, but he was obviously still using GoB.</br>  <br> part of Gil <br>No, it's his treasure. Your wallet is not part of you. His treasure is not powered by him.</br></br>  Does anyone have that picture thats a guide for how to go through the fate series? I saw it once and meant to save it, but I didn't. At least where do I go once I finish all three routes in Fate/Stay Night?  <br>The key is not a weapon, Lancelot would not be able to use it</br>  <br> I don't see how the fuck a personality can now be used as NP. <br><br>That's an example, for those that keep saying Gawain has no weakness. Its an example to show even if you think they don't have it, they entirely do have weaknesses. Not to mention he does have weaknesses, as Gilgamesh threatens him with his very weakness in CCC, which is an NP.<br><br> He has not shown anything close to <br><br>says it right here<br><br> Gilgamesh: You idiot, did you think I wouldn't have a ship of light among my treasures? Just because I like the classics doesn't mean I don't keep up with recent developments. If there is a technique that sends somebody to the edges of space, then there will be a Noble Phantasm corresponding to it.  <br><br>If there's a technique, then there's an NP correspeonding to it. He has the origins of all shit; you can say "He hasn't shown us the origin of Fafnir, so clearly he doesn't have it", but we know he has it. If something doesn't have a source within his vault, it can't be considered an NP according to one interview.<br><br> Then why be so surprised when he got BTFO if he knew the danger already? <br><br>He knew Archer's powers, but he can read Shirou and see he's still a scrub. Even if this guy has an elemental advantage against you, he's still forty levels below you. Gilgamesh recognized Archer as something to remove, but Shirou was just a human. For Gilgamesh who is a servant to say that a mere human is a threat to him, even though he might have an advantage against him, its laughable for him, it can't be. He's just a human.<br><br> Besides, Shirou is not the only case, look at True Archer. <br><br>Bad example, its noted Gilgamesh cannot disern this guy's identity in order to figure out what to best throw at him yet. The divine cloth on his head is obscuring him enough that even Gil can't make heads or tails of anything yet, so he's fighting blind.<br><br>Kind of like if he couldn't figure out that Heracles is weak to A rank NPs, he needs to figure out this guy's identity first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't firing at all actually. At least not against Shirou Saber. CCC gameplay also makes it seem like he wasn't firing.</br>  <br>Watch/read Zero or read Ataraxia. Or Tsukihime.</br>  <br> At least where do I go once I finish all three routes in Fate/Stay Night? <br>Fate/Hollow ataraxia and Fate/Zero<br><br>Hollow is a fandisc, primarily SoL with some great serious scenes<br>Zero is a prequel to stay night<br><br>Or you can start tsukihime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a weapon actually, it's a keyblade. Now back to the point, would David/Lancelot have control over the Gate? Would Gil lose control over it? Would the control split?</br>  <br> He wasn't firing at all actually. At least not against Shirou Saber <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>GoB is operated by him and what minuscule amount of prana it does require is still supplied by him. I can lose my wallet. Gilgamesh can lose the contents of his vault, not the capability to use GoB.</br>  <br>Does Tsukihime actually have any correlation to the Fate Universe? It seems separate at a glance, just by the same people.</br>  <br>This is kind if outdated now because the anime is done.</br>  <br>During their first fight he didn't seem to be firing, he was using it with his own hands.</br>  <br> Gill get's desperate pulls out EA <br>Considering gill has golden rule. EA should work well with it</br></br>  <br>This is what I was looking for! Thanks man, yeah I know its alittle outdated but its fine, it still tells me where I need to go from here. Plus with the help of everyone else.</br>  <br>No. SF already showed he didn't need his key and GoB is E-A++ for a reason; it depends on your own personal wealth, not necessarily Gil's.</br>  <br>Everything in TM are connected, and they coincide at times, but not in too heavy of a way.<br><br>The characters from other works might show up on occasion.<br><br>They are the same world, everything is basically the same world, but infinite parallel universes based on that same world which show how things could have turned out very differently in very small or big ways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SF already showed he didn't need his key and GoB <br><br>That was a forgery key, it wasn't his key.<br><br>It was the thing that the guy summoned him with, a replica.<br><br>He says in CCC that he needs his key for optimal condition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>CCC was also different in that Gil had trouble connecting to the GoB in the first place.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh :: …You want to ask about my taste in clothes? Do you want to change my formal wear? Very well, do as you please. If you have clothing suitable for me I won’t stop you. This golden outfit merely guards against evil spirits. If there are no petrifying serpents, or gigantic bulls, there is no particular reason to be concerned with it. <br><br> From what Gilgamesh says, it sounds like his golden armor is anti-petrification equipment. So, it sounds like, though their may be other formal wear he’d like, that one is his default. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: In a serious, dignified battle, there are some restrictions on my appearance. But at play, it does not matter. Note that I don’t favor hand-to-hand combat. When I exercise my true power, all I need is my body and the key to my treasury. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's just nasu being nasu</br>  <br>Every non-divine servant</br>  <br> excuses </br>  <br>Ah, I see. Thanks for the heads up, looks like I have a lot ahead of me. I just finished UBW route, so I still have Heaven's Feel but I didn't realize how much farther down the rabbit hole it goes.</br>  <br>Oh right he didn't actually shoots any of them at Saber, he just shoot that one hammer at Shirou.</br>  <br>A KnK character is referenced at the end of HF.</br>  <br> If there's a technique, then there's an NP correspeonding to it. <br>Nope. He simply had a Ship of Light. This doesn't mean he has stuff like KoH or God Hand. GoB has 2 things, the prototype of NPs and the creations of the people of his time, in this case, the Ship of Light seems to be one of the creation of his people. He doesn't even have all the regular NPs, as proven by Excalibur and Avalon, or Karna armor. At this point you are confirming you are a Gilfag.<br><br> If something doesn't have a source within his vault, it can't be considered an NP according to one interview. <br>Interview never mentioned him having a NP for every technique, stop making shit up.<br><br> Bad example, its noted Gilgamesh cannot disern this guy's identity in order to figure out what to best throw at him yet. The divine cloth on his head is obscuring him enough that even Gil can't make heads or tails of anything yet, so he's fighting blind. <br>Didn't you say he could easily know the identity? Doesn't seem like it. He couldn't possibly know EMIYA either, he is from the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the point of having a nuke if you die before using it.</br>  <br>I don't remember it being this way on /cgg/.</br>  <br>You got rekt, just answer the damn question now, or shut up if you don't know it.</br>  <br>TM Ace has confirmed that Gil possesses Clairvoyance a la Merlin and can peer into alternate worlds. It's pretty consistent with his views of the future in CCC, so what makes you so certain that he "couldn't possibly" find out Emiya's identity just because he's from a different era?</br>  <br>Your questions only took a modicum of intelligence to figure out yourself. Don't be surprised you weren't spoonfed.</br>  <br>Even disregarding that shit, even if people don't want to understand it because "Fucking Gilfags", this is how it works. He can read people, and realize their abilities or strengths. Also in UBW we literally have the moment where he looks into Shirou's circuits and tells hm what he's doing before he does it, and Shirou asks how he can do it, as he says its but a trifle.<br><br> Q: Gilgamesh has no skills in swordsmanship, would Assassin win if Gilgamesh is caught in the range of Tsubame Gaeshi? <br><br> A: Most likely, he will just defend with his armour, or take out some really unfair defensive armament that protects against Multidimensional Refraction Phenomenon, from the Gate of Babylon. However, Gilgamesh is capable of accurately assessing his opponents' abilities, so he would not consider having a battle of swordsmanship with Assassin the first place.  <br><br>Its hard to explain what this guy can do without people just passing you off thinking its wank, but that's how he works. He still loses due to pride, despite having all of this shit somehow, but he still has it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PIME TARADOX</br>  <br>It must be tough to piss and moan about Gilfags when Nasu's an instance of one.</br>  <br> when Nasu's an instance of one. <br>Yet he still writes Gil as a jobber</br></br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Dude, he makes it rain during the finale. Saber had to turn on practically all her defensive cooldowns to survive.</br>  <br>That's an active skill, not passive, he needs to activate it first. Even if he does, he will disregard it as bullshit.<br><br><br> Its hard to explain what this guy can do without people just passing you off thinking its wank, but that's how he works. <br>I know it's not wank, I'm saying that apparently it is either only when serious or it doesn't seem to work against everyone, just look at Lancelot and True Archer, he was clueless about who the fuck Lancelot was and he doesn't know who True Archer is or what to do against him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Won two grail wars <br> Lost one grail war <br> Has beaten dozens of servants to date <br> Has only lost to the main characters before <br><br>People want to force this jobber thing, even when he's broken jobber status long ago. He's one of the most successful servants to date, its like people have still only read F/SN.<br><br>Heracles and Cu are far worse jobbers, who haven't ever won anything to date. Gilgamesh as a 2/3rds track record of winning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Has only lost to the main characters before <br>He lost the dogfight to Lancelot.</br></br>  Last Stardust comes out on the 29th, right?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128419357 <br>Did you even pay attention to the article? Dying to the shadow is what he'd consider bullshit, because we're talking about Gilgamesh. It never said he'd disregard everything he'd parse.</br>  <br>He can read people mostly, but not when they have something obscuring their status.<br><br>Lancelot and True Archer are two such people; although TA could just be explained as him being too angry to use it so much, since the situation with this guy is all at once and Gil is just getting more pissed and foolish.<br><br>Guy gets stupid when he gets angry.<br><br>TA tells him to pull out Ea and maybe they'll be equal, and Gilgamesh just says he won't pull out his greatest shit against a weakling and instead pulls out Merodach or whatever before rushing him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything that has him losing, he will disregard it as bullshit.</br>  <br>That had nothing to do with gleaming someone else's identity.</br>  <br>*Jmetsy.</br>  <br>So the best strategy against Gil is to get him angry.</br>  <br> assessing his opponents abilities <br>will gilgamesh win against saiyan? considering saiyan appears weaker than they are and they powerful immensely during a fight which will put gil off guard</br></br>  <br>He would still see EMIYA being a threat as bullshit. You are also assuming he even used the skill to begin with.</br>  <br>Yes. You need to act more arrogant and bluff to world's end.</br>  <br>Saiyans are 2 fast for Gil B AGI speed of reaction.</br>  <br><br>All Servants have a chance to beat him, because this is the Nasuverse where powerlevels mean little in the grand scheme of things unless you're talking about someone who is literally absolute in power like Archetype Earth. As long as the ideal conditions are met, any Servant could beat Gilgamesh, it's just that Gilgamesh would still beat every other Servant in 99.999% of scenarios.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Rin noted at the time she realized an oddity there after Gilgamesh attacked them, and it was blatantly labeled for the reader.<br><br>Among all the people in the hall he attacked Archer, before retreating. Not Saber, not any of the others, but he signaled out Archer.<br><br>Then this is laid out more later, in this image right here for those that seem to forget.<br><br>Its noted he knew Archer's ability, he had never seen it before, he didn't see the reality marble in the actual version, but he could read it, so he had to stop him. During the Shirou fight as well he speaks as though he can see into Shirou's circuits, see into them and what he can do, and confirms it.<br><br>Guy just got serious far too late into that one, but its already shown enough that he could read Archer as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fair enough. what about krillin then</br>  <br>Well, Archer was using Projection all that time. I doubt he knew about UBW. If he knew UBW was going to happen, if he knew EMIYA identity, if he saw the future, his defeat, then why the fuck didn't he do anything about Shirou and was so surprised at it?</br>  So, is there a theory of who this guy is?  <br>What are even Krillin feats? I think anything above Mach 11 should be able to fuck Gil up.</br>  <br>Shirou didn't go into the battle able to do that; it was a mere human who didn't even know how his own powers worked when the fight first started.<br><br>Gilgamesh underestimated both the fact that a lesser being might present a challenge, and that someone can rapidly advance in a few moments with a bit of stimulus. Even if Gilgamesh accurately judged him at the start of the fight as not really a threat, he might not have stayed that way.<br><br>Its the shounen MC sort of style, improving rapidly within no amount of time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Servants with command spell boost can go maybe mach 14, but typically they hover around the lower mach ranges probably.<br><br>Archer's arrows are said to travel as fast as Saber with command spell boost however, and he doesn't need a boost for that.<br><br>Gilgamesh can maybe shoot the same out of his vault depending on what he uses, or he has a ship that can go faster than the speed of light in CCC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mad hatter and Guy Fawkes.</br>  <br>Even before the corruption, the grail is a human endeavor, therefore susceptible to human weakness.</br>  <br>Yeah I based it on the Mach 11 arrows, Saber was having a hard time reacting to those, so I guess someone with inferior skill like Gil would get fucked up by anything of that tier.<br><br>Even if the Ship can FTL his reaction stays the same, it's pointless in actual battle.</br></br></br>  <br>Last line seals the deal. There are more losers in the world than there are heroes.</br>  <br>If his reaction speed is the same, he would have hit so many things on his way back to the Moon.<br><br>His reaction speed needs to be at least the speed of light to pilot a speed of light ship and not die. Either we can say that time is relative which caused his reaction speed to shoot up a lot since he was going that speed at the time when comparatively to others its going super fast but to him its normal, or the mind directly interfaces with the screen so that the command speed seems normal somehow.<br><br>Normal humans have to be able to pilot this light ship as well, it needed an interface that was possible for them to keep up. Time slows down relative to speed for the user, or the ship speeds up your thought speed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Going FTL means the Ship gets infinite mass. It should have no problems hitting stuff on it's way back. There is no way his reaction speed can be enhanced. At best, I could assume the Ship has an automatic system like the Vimana. His speed of reaction will forever be B.</br>  <br>a fucking faggot, judging by his outfit</br>  <br>Theory of Relativity</br>  <br>Don't see what that has to do with Gil AGI.</br>  <br>Arc is a "ru ri ka" class?</br>  <br>Protip, look two up and one to the left.</br>  <br>Funny Vamp</br>  <br>That would pretty much mean the Ship isn't faster than light to begin with. Real world rules don't seem to apply here.</br>  <br>oh I'm blind.</br>  <br>Faster an object moves the more your relativity changes. If a person is aboard a ship traveling thousands of miles per hour in space for the next twenty years, their perception of time would be far less than someone who was on Earth all that time doing nothing, without moving super fast all the time as they thought their perception was just normal.

Not so much binge reading though.</br>  <br>Sanji would probably fight Burgess.

You are right that value of a crew member isn't just fighting ability.</br>  <br> smokers spot of top jobber <br><br>please anon, smoker and sanji have jobbed equally post timeskip and sanji jobbed more than smoker did pre time skip, sanji is clearly the top jobber</br></br></br>  <br>You know you've gone full retard when Luffy calls you naїve.</br>  <br><br>Sanji actually won some fights. I don't remember when that was though. 10 years ago probably.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what point you're trying to make, but you still haven't done it. You posted the panel of Sabo riding away on birds and green texted something about Doffy being the king of birds, a title he was referred to by once by Luffy. What is your point?</br>  <br><br>That's back when Luffy wasnt yet flanderized into being a complete moron.</br></br>  <br>Wadatsumi.<br>Also, he won big by making Viola defect.</br></br>  <br> having any expectation for Burgess to begin with <br>He's a loudmouth brute, and not a main character. The fact that you didn't automatically recognize he wouldn't be a problem for Sabo or (Luffy) is your fault. The rest of the BB pirates will be tough, but Burgess was the obligatory first aggressive meathead to be beaten. And he'll most likely get stronger before his next appearance.</br></br>  <br>I hate you.</br>  <br><br>He's a top fighter in one of the most powerful if not THE most powerful pirate crews in the world.<br><br>And apparently that means he can't win a fight or at the very least not embarrass himself.<br><br>He basically didn't accomplish landing a hit on Sabo or Luffy and was smacked around like he was some random thug.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone says Bellamy will join Law, but doesn't this indicate he'll follow Bellamy in the Dickrider Pirates? He seems like a perfect fit, although I would prefer a solo cover arc with him  <br> faggots who think everyone has to join someone <br> literally worse than shippers <br>He has his own motherfucking crew, goddamnit. A captain who abandons his crew just like that is a shit captain and a shit pirate.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant Bellamy joins Bart. I don't think anyone "needs" to join anyone, but Bellamy clearly has dependency issues and can't live without kissing someone's ass anymore</br>  <br> He has his own motherfucking crew <br>Didnt they all died reaching Skypea?</br></br>  I've only watched 22 episodes and I already hate that stupid orange haired slut.  <br>Try watching Bleach instead.</br>  <br>Its okay, you´re meant to until you feel bad for her.<br>Also read the mango instead</br></br>  <br>bellamy doesnt have a crew anymore, and he has to join SOMEONE to be relevant</br>  I want a Logia to join the crew but Caesar and Sabo are definitely not doing it :(<br><br>And no, MONET IS DEAD.</br></br>  <br>Dude :/ Are you that same guy from last night who said that Koala is CP0 because it's unexpected and would mirror CP9 reveal? Because your logic with birds and Doffy is not too far off from the absurdity of that one special snowflake of an anon.</br>  <br>One Piece anime until end Ennis Lobby is pretty great (episode 330 or so). It is after that you start to notice issues with the pacing/art.</br>  <br>If a logia ever joins, it will most certainly be some useless element or something with horrible quirk or handicap (which of course the character will learn to exploit marvelously).</br>  <br>caribou is confirmed m8</br>  <br> :( <br>get out</br></br>  <br>Oda all but confirmed that number pattern theory, so you just need to see if any Logia is introduced that can fit. Any combination of 2 and 9 or 0 and 0 that can fit?</br>  <br> Oda all but confirmed that number pattern theor <br><br>If the number pattern theory was correct Kuma would be joining and that doesn't seem likely.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah you can watch up until timeskip id say</br>  <br>or he can just make a new fruit that follows, or kuma dies, etc</br>  <br>There can be other fruits that fall into 2 and 9 besides Nikyu Nikyu, the Fuku Fuku for example if that is indeed what Kin'emon has.</br>  <br>Oda did a really obvious confirmation though. He stutters and puts on a shocked reaction to the question then clumsily asks "why am I surprised, no comment" and changes the subject. That was him playfully acknowledging the theory as correct.</br>  <br> point you are trying to make <br>I just posted an observation which connects the start of Dressrosa to the end, I could start theorizing that Doffy is Uranus based on this and the painter DF users painting of the sun being blotted out (most likely a lunar eclipse) but there's no evidence so its just an observation anon.</br></br>  <br> D: Odacchi! I noticed an amazing thing!!! It is that if you show the Straw Hat Devil Fruit users in numbers, it will be the numbers from 1~10!! <br><br> Luffy→Gomu Gomu (5.6.5.6.), Chopper→Hito Hito (1.10.1.10), Robin→Hana Hana (8.7.8.7.), Brook→Yomi Yomi (4.3.4.3.)  <br><br> (1.3.4.5.6.7.8.10), but there is no (2.9), so is the one who ate the Nikyu Nikyu (2.9.2.9.) no Mi, Bartholomew Kuma, gonna be a Straw Hat next? Please tell me!!! P.N. SHANKUS.LOVE <br><br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! <br><br> really obvious confirmation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! <br><br>http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS_<wbr>Volume_59<br>Okay, he didn't stutter, but he wasn't exactly subtle about it.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Franky said they owed Kuma when they recovered the sunny, no doubt they will meet again.</br>  <br>It's missing zero, also the japanese craziness with multiple pronunciations also have a few other variations.</br>  <br>He also said that Kuma was a braindead robot WG slave.<br><br>Unless they find Kuma's brain in a jar somewhere or something I'm not seeing how he can be cured</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I meant for </br>  <br>I think the said<br> we have to repay him <br>Kuma saved them on Thriller Bark (imagine if Doffy came instead), saved them from Kizaru, and guarded their ship.<br>Vega seems too altruistic to kill Kuma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Franky said they owe him, but that next time they see Kuma, it wouldn't be him anymore so they need to treat him as an enemy.</br>  <br>I dunno I'm going off memory and could be wrong.</br>  <br>Why is this so ugly?</br>  <br> Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! <br>Why would Oda raise this question if the pattern was nonsense?</br></br>  <br>Using a ton of different quality scans and bad resizing.</br>  Very disappointed with the way Doffy was taken out. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Doffyfag, I just don't like the way Luffy didn't use King Kong Gun from the beginning. The flashback panels established that Luffy had already developed the technique during the time skip, and there's no evidence that it was particularly difficult to pull off or that it only worked in a special situation. <br><br>If you look at the final Croc fight and the Lucci fight, Luffy wins by pushing beyond his previous limits and developing new techniques. When he won there was a real sense of accomplishment, that Luffy had pulled off something that he wouldn't have been able to do before. In the Doffy fight he wins by using a pre-practised move designed for punching through powerful defences. He might as well have pulled out Bat-Anti-String Spray.</br></br>  <br>why did it take so much to beat doffy?</br>  <br> take so much <br> literally 5 big punches <br><br>This was the most underwhelming over hyped garbage fight in the entire series.<br><br>Oda isn't himself anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice.<br>I have the first one.</br></br>  <br>Because he is tough. Doffy stats and haki are pretty strong.</br>  would anyone really care if sanji died?  <br>Everybody would.<br><br>Who doesn't love Sanji?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Hey anon, I understand your concern about this fight and Oda having lost it.<br><br>Don't worry, this was to show us Luffys's based power and then enter Kaido.<br><br>The strongest creature, when that finisher move barely beat a gorilla.</br></br></br></br></br>  When did Sanji's character start slipping?<br>Around Ennies Lobby IMO, from Thriller Bark and onward he's replaced Usopp as full on comic relief.</br>  <br>Gear 4 is a mode that has a huge drawback that leave him vulnerable for 10 minutes without haki. Of course luffy isn't going to use it unless he have no other choice.</br>  <br>Sanji has historically been the third most popular OP character period and was only pushed down to fourth because of Law<br><br>This thread is really the only place ive seen that dislikes Sanji</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought of that as natural progression, Usopp had severe self-esteem issues that finally exploded in Water 7, and Sanji was his biggest backer throughout that whole saga, constantly reassuring Usopp of his worth. After he rejoined, the crew stopped making fun of Usopp and were a lot more supportive and complimenting towards him.<br>Sanji, having great confidence and self-worth, naturally became the new whipping boy, remember he gave that speech to Usopp about how each of them has their own roles to play, that there was something he could do that Usopp couldn't and vice versa. Sanji took on the butt monkey role that Usopp couldn't handle.</br></br>    <br>NTR?

He's as uncontrollable as Bakugou, but in a different way. At least Bakugou and Todoroki has understandably human-all-too-human motive behind them. Midoriya, not so much. He's a hero indeed. An embodiment of a certain value. A monster which can't be regulated by the machinery of society. It's unlike other 'heroes' that hero-killer wanted to eradicate. Hero-killer will probably grow fond of him. <br>Since the age of 4 he's been a nobody who's dreamed for a super power like everyone else. 11 years of that and suddenly he has a chance to become one, if he proves himself worthy of "one for all". It's 11 years desperation where he watched all the people who could do amazing things while he couldn't combined with what he sees as his one chance at a good life. He'd sacrifice himself in heroics since at least then for a instant he was like everybody else.</br></br>  <br>1. Deku throws the ball 0.1m further than he did in the athletic trials.<br>2.
