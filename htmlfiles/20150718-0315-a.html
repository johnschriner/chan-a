[ Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #1<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.</br></br>  Since it's my birthday this Monday, I'd like to request a simple POV of Tharja and my daughterus Morgan and Noire welcoming the viewer back home/saying happy birthday/anything of that sort. Both Morgan and Noire have black hair like Tharja, just a tip.<br><br>A more simple request would just be anything birthday-esque with Tharja, maybe her laying in bed invitingly or simply wishing the viewer a happy birthday.<br><br>Larger Tharja ref: http://imgur.com/krqO38r<br>Morgan(Middle)/Noire(Right): http://imgur.com/Jf9WBxu<br><br>Just ask if you happen to need anymore references for Noire and Morgan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, hope the day/night finds you well. Requesting Asuka sitting on the shoulder of a Gloucester, reference provided here http://a.uguu.se/ktjafw_Gloucester_<wbr>-_Line_Art.jpg Don't feel pressured to draw the whole Gloucester, the focus should be Asuka, of course, but if you can pull off drawing the whole Gloucester while adhering to the above caveat, go for it.

My first delivery from Boa. Thanks for drawing my pizza butt. I love it. Thanks so much!<br><br>Cheers!</br></br></br>  Because I know not everyone checks the general drawthread, I'm reposting this here.<br>I wanted to thank Orz and Sharkbro for drawing those wonderful images for me.<br>Also I won't be requesting this weekend, since I've gotten way too many wonderful deliveries the past weeks and this past weekend alone.<br>Have a nice weekend everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Crap, I was too late  ;_; </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>Shhh, don't let the Boa fanboys hear you say that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>oh, guess it wasn't the body</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>What's your problem?</br>  Boa is very decent but after that episode of "as good as doom!" yesterday the urge to shitpost is -intense-.<br><br>This is why ranking your drawfus is bad.</br></br>  Requesting Stocking drinking cocktails with chubby anon, please.  <br>It's all relative, body being too small or head being too large.</br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please. If the artist wants something specific they can have her legs on a desk while she's sitting or have her tied up in a glass cylinder like in Batman Forever.  Requesting Sailor Jupiter cosplaying as Mai Shiranui, preferably in her jiggle-crouch pose on the bottom right.  <br/>  <br>Jupiter's from an anime<br>Are you saying I can't request my waifu cosplaying as Chun Li or something? Doesn't mean Chun Li's my waifu, just that I like her outfit</br></br>  Requesting Taiga wearing shorts and a tank-top, or any other appropriate kind of Summer time clothes, please.<br>Anything would be appreciated.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209612 <br>Why were these deleted? Weren't they just some fixes to the pic?</br></br>  <br>Keyboard is broken so you get a pencil sketch sir</br>  <br>Are you looking forward to Odin Sphere HD?</br>  <br>Not him but who isn't?</br>  <br> keyboard is broken so I can't use a tablet or mouse <br>wot?</br></br>  Requesting more Oora in her oversized pink T-Shirt~  Unfortunately what is in the reference is all I can get   <br>hotkeys</br>  <br> but she's my waifu!  <br><br>Also I wasn't implying Mai was your waifu, seeing as you requested Jupiter. But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request.</br></br></br>  <br> But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request. <br>You must be new here.</br></br>  <br>You know I am, I wanna buy this game for the third time. I love the game that much.<br><br> If only I could play it on my vita... </br></br></br>  requesting this qt3.14  <br>Outsdide Mishafag and the other lewd requesters that request here and in the general who else does it?</br>  <br>Whoa that was fast! A pencil sketch is fine too, gives it a different kind of a feeling than a digital drawing. Thanks so much, it's really cute and a great way to start the weekend!</br>  <br>We do request less lewds in the WWD than in the regular drawthread, but nothing on the post itself hints to it being a haremfag, some sort of shitposter or anything but a person requesting his waifu. I mean, we do humor that fatchouli fag every weekend.</br>  <br> someone finally requested the best side-character ever created </br>  <br> Aside from the people who do it, who does it? </br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and outfit matching ribbons is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks!</br>  <br>I dunno. I haven't even the chance to save whatever <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209612  posted.</br>  How's the coloring on all those Sharkbro drawings?  <br>Slow and painful. I won't be done with mine for a few weeks.</br>  <br>4/14<br>though those 4 are still not complete</br></br>  <br> Mishafag <br> a person <br> not human excrement given life <br><br>Well that's a bit of a stretch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>WIPS?</br></br>  <br>Still stuck in husbando coloring duty. Next week I'll see what  and  have and pick some that haven't been colored or aren't in progress yet.</br>  <br>I am done with 3 which I'll post this weekend. Working on a 4th one.</br>  <br>It wasn't a fix, it was just a rough edit.</br>  <br>Was something wrong with it? Or I guess the one who drew it deleted it.</br>  <br>I love your work, by the way, even if my husbando is  a waifu .</br>  <br>It fixed the proportions but all he did is select and re-size the head and arm. The lines don't match up and he probably can't recreate Boa's linework.</br>  <br>So I don't get why it was deleted...</br>  <br><br>Here are the 8 I'm working on. I haven't had much time to work on them since Monday but they are all still in progress.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not much different than a simple semi-lewd request; if an artist who wants to pick mine up and draw her with her boobs busting out, that'd be fine, too. If push comes to shove, I'll just ask for a commission.</br></br>  <br>You're doing God's work Tamabro</br>  <br>Man, I love the thread police tho</br>  <br>I dont think people would take issue with this if you werent spamming the request in the general during the week and just so happened to appear here now. It looks like you are requesting here simply because it is more active as opposed to that actually being you're waifu.</br>  <br> Here are the 8 I'm working on. <br> 8 <br>Holy shit, dude.</br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br> __? </br>  <br>kek, nice stuff boa</br>  <br>no wip because don't want to open photoshop</br>  <br>Really cute. I like it a lot. Not OR.</br>  <br>Well, that is party true, as I thought it'd make sense to post in two threads at the same time for that reason, I admit it. I only requested this in the regular drawthread once yesterday, and I'll probably post in there once more before I give it a break. I have no intention of spamming it in both threads; once again, I'll go ahead and commission it somewhere else if nobody's picking it up, I have absolutely no problem with that. I'm just like most of the requesters here and don't want to start any drama regarding what makes "lewd" art.</br>  <br>Not sure if cute or scary, but good job</br>  <br>That's kawaii shit</br>  <br>No, you thought it would make sense to request it here because people actually draw in these threads.</br>  <br> this ain't candy </br>  <br>Again, partly true, but with threads like these, it comes down to trial and error and dumb luck depending on the request. I don't want to start any more beef, alright? If it's not done here, I'll fuck off myself without devolving this into a flame war. Simple as that.</br>  <br> 8 <br> a lot </br></br>  <br>How many are you working on</br>  Requesting riko taking a bubble bath  <br>When did she dress like Powergirl?</br>  <br>Roughly 40 in a queue.<br>3 are complete.</br></br>  <br>Just needs a black bar.</br>  <br>Why would anyone assume I'm anywhere near doom?</br>  <br>I see you've been the the /i/ thread too.</br>  <br>It's a new project. Not an HD remake.</br>  <br><br>Really? I usually work on one until I finish it.</br></br>  <br>Because they like you. Don't take it too personally.</br>  Requesting sleepy Tamaki wearing an oversized dress shirt as pajamas and yawning cutely please! As always anything else cute is appreciated as long as it's not too lewd  even cute lewd  . <br><br>Thanks for reading and have a comfy weekend!</br></br>  <br>Hey that was amusing, nice work Boa!</br>  <br>You made me do this</br>  <br>it seemed that you've got quite the fanclub, congrats</br>  <br>You made a real worm turn into a colorful dildo?</br>  Homura eating a big cookie  Requesting my dear sweet Lancer in Doutanuki Masakuni's battle clothing. Any level of the clothing is fine. I'm not picky however and will accept him having summer fun in any possible way, from fishing to beach time and anything in between. Tight swimsuits preferred, but draw what you are comfortable with.<br>Lancer Refs: http://imgur.com/a/Axfod/all<br>Doutanuki Refs: http://imgur.com/a/HsPXS/all</br></br>  Boa, may I ask when we'll see the completed collage? Last week it looked almost done.  I'm counting this, because I made it trippy. Luffy a best.  Requesting Musubi wearing a Zipper Bikini, struggling to keep it on or to zip it. Otherwise something like a halter top and short-shorts!  <br>Inanimate objects in mouths are better than than that, anon</br>  All I would like is a happy Ryoubi wielding powertools  she can be flat as well but has to be wearing naked overalls or something suitable.   Millia Rage please, anything would be fine.  Requesting my king Revo.<br>Him with a Léon plush would be amazing, anything cute or cool is appreciated though.<br><br>If anyone want to arttrade I'll be up for it.</br></br></br>  <br>And with cookie you mean...</br>  <br>I tried. Sorry.</br>  <br>Every time I open it I think "ehhh" and then go do something else.</br>  <br/>  <br>Chocolate chip</br>  Can somebody draw Gakupo? Or maybe Gackt  <br>Huge throbbing dick?</br>  <br>Okay, meant to quote </br>  <br> wanting to violate waifus </br>  Requesting Tsukihi dressed like a chef  <br>Hot damn, that is awesome!</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Haremfags <br>They would enjoy it anyway</br></br>  <br>Then you must be one because even they probably won't.</br>    Starting with this. Can't argue with that.  <br>Here's a manga where that applies.</br>    Arguable.<br><br><br>But Ema is also best girl along with Aoi.</br></br></br>  <br>the blonde one and goth girl are better.</br>      <br>But she's not even the main character</br>  Saekano.    <br>Literally worst girl in her own manga.</br>  Her mom, her grandma, Spoor, Atosuryua, Ekuryua are also best girls.<br>Arguable Sobaash.</br>  <br>Nice try, but best girl is Maya.</br>  <br>All girls are good in Shirobako, there is no best.</br>  <br>This. They are so good that is is hard to decide which is better</br>  It's  Ore-sama da! Hahaha!     <br>This one.</br>  no contest      Well that was easy.  <br><br> liking useless meat </br></br>  Wow, this is harder than I thought. Well, I'll just post the obvious I guess.    <br>Found the fag</br>  Main girl, but not love interest (thank god)    <br>Mai is the protagonist of her series.</br>      <br>But she develops into sex incarnate anon.</br>      <br>You don't know the meaning of that word. Mai is a girl.</br>  <br>Who is this beauty?</br>  If Erina is main girl then Shokugeki  <br>My brutha I thought /a/ forgot , but some of you still remember! Yes she is good, and Spoor is excellent. MC is kinda dull thought </br>    Honestly OP, I'm having a hard time thinking of any anime where main girl ISN'T best girl.    <br>At first I thought she was wearing a pantsu on head.</br>    <br> retards <br>Never, ever.</br></br>  <br> I'm having a hard time thinking of any anime where main girl ISN'T best girl <br> Sento <br>What massive shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> your opinion <br>Never, ever.</br></br>  <br>Excellent taste.</br>    It's a shame what happened to her, but at the same time, her "I can count to behelit" self is the funniest character in the manga by far.  <br>There's a number of good girls in SV2 but Noa is so top tier she has her own tier. She only really shares it with pic related.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Correct.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    I hope you've made your delta decision /a/.<br>I know I have.<br><br> Let's try this again. </br></br></br>  <br>Why the sudden death of the other thread?</br>  <br>Some in the OP triggered autosage. I don't know what though.</br>  <br>It really is better, isn't it? Goes to show just how inexperienced Ibuki and Eiha's players were.</br>  <br>I would say that what they added to Ibuki in the anime make him worse.</br>  <br>While it won't cause me to drop the anime, I still wonder why they gave Ibuki a sacrifice power just to have him crying for most of the first two episodes. <br>Do nips seriously think that's a good way of introducing an MC? Having him cry all the time?</br></br>  <br>I think they just wanted to push Ibuki's presence even if it meant the curse really fucking the story up at the start. I mean, isn't he the only character, now older and proclaimed king, from the original story to show up in the sequel mobile game they're advertising?<br><br>It's still fun though now that the entire cast has shown up. Gives me a real good picture of the show when I put on my table top goggles.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaguraba also appears in the game and Swallow can be recruited as a special unit for the ones who preorder the BD.</br>  <br>The execution was shit. I think the writer they're using isn't very experienced that's why.</br>  <br>I chalk it up to the director. They really should have gotten a more experienced director than the guy the show has now. I'm 100% sure that the show would be far better than it is now if they just had somebody good.<br><br>Ironically, the awkward handling of some the scenes were hilarious because it actually did remind me of some of the janky D&amp;D campaigns I had.<br> Damn these threads are dead than dead. Looks like everybody really did drop it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>True, the directing was shit. Having the MC kill his allies is a gimmick that can be interesting. <br><br>This show is M3 tier of dropped. Maybe something interesting will happen along the line and get a full thread, but it won't catch on.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh well, at least we can get nice threads like M3 had, while they're alive</br>  <br>Well that is true. Aside from everybody shitting on the show in the "What did your drop?" threads, the actual shitposting in the threads will almost be nonexistent.<br><br>And what is with Narita's character anyway? He seems like on another level from the rest of the cast. I usually don't see that seemingly huge powerlevel difference between PCs.</br></br></br>  <br>Swallow and Lou are stronger than Kaguraba. Well, Swallow and Lou are really strong</br>  <br>Oh is that right? His backstory just seemed far grander than usual.</br>  <br>He's supposed to be a neutral character. When they were having the TRPG sessions, The other players didn't even know that Kaguraba is not an NPC since Narita never attended these sessions with them.</br>  <br>He is fucking rich and good at social stuff though.</br>  GEN UROBUCHI IS CUTE!<br><br>EVEN AS A WOMAN<br><br>CUTE!</br></br></br></br>  <br> gets to pass a CHA roll against an airhead, an angsty shota, and a stoic loli <br> an angsty shota <br>This is what did it.</br></br></br>  <br>With the curse and his True Pact, Swallow damage is nine times the usual amount. Add to that that he has a Excaliblast. His CON is also nine times the normal amount.<br><br>Lou is a monster in martial arts and can add mana to damage.</br></br></br>  Don't you ever get tired of blonde loli vampires?  Vampires are inhuman scum which must be purged.  <br><br>Yes, that is why I have dark-haired melancholy vampires.</br></br>  <br>No. What are you, a faggot?</br>  <br>Racist</br>  I'll never get tired of long-haired little girls.  <br> Those lips <br> Katana <br><br>I think I prefer blonde loli vampires, as much as it hurts to say that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never. Blonde vampire loli is perfection.</br>  <br>I want to touch a blonde loli's womb with my hot throbbing cock as I thrust inside her wet pussy over and over until I seed her fuckhole deep. She's not your waifu. She's my slut. </br>  <br>Blonde or not, loli vampires are great.</br>  You can never have enough  <br>I'm not a fag, so no.<br><br> Pantsu or bandaid? </br></br></br>  <br>Yes I fucking hate them especially lolis.<br><br>Why are lolis such shit characters?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll be tired of blonde loli vampires as soon as I tire of twintailed tsunderes, busty christmas cakes, and tanned tomboys.</br>  <br>Vampires are monsters. They don't belong in this world.</br>  <br>Well you can  eat my liquid diarrhea as it sprays out of my rectum, along with the blood. </br>  <br>At least they give tribute...</br>  <br>Hey, it wasn't their choice that they were once again given flesh.</br>  <br>Ok Richter</br>  <br>Oh god I need sauce on .... Mondaitachi<br><br>Fuck it, I'm out</br></br></br>  No, and I never will.  <br>Only a faggot would get tired of loli vampires.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>I am in no way discrediting lolis, but mature, healthy vampire women are nothing to scoff at either.</br>  <br> liking old hags. </br>  <br> posting memes this old </br>  <br>If you ask me, they don't belong in this world.</br>  <br> Not having shit taste is a meme. </br>  <br>Yeah, they were brought here by us, humans, who want to pay them tribute.</br>  <br>I want to  _be  one.</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br> unironically having shit taste </br>  <br>Yes, that is what the other anon was doing.</br>  <br>They don't strictly have to be blond, I love all kind of loli vampires.</br>  They're honestly the greatest character archetype Japan has ever produced.  <br>If it's not a maymay, it's a condition.</br>  <br>Yes. Pic related.</br>  <br>That is what I was implying.</br>  <br> They're honestly the greatest character archetype the universe has ever produced. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>My condolences on you having chronic shit taste.</br>  They're wonderful but I prefer my non-vampire lolis.  <br> non-vampiric <br> wanting your loli to grow up <br><br>Fag</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the other anon that has shit taste. You really need to work on your reading comprehension as you do not seem to be following what has happened at all.</br>  <br>There are plenty of timeless lolis who aren't vampires anon.</br>  <br>They're all non human abominations that must be purged.</br>  <br>I already said I have nothing against lolis, as a matter of fact I often prefer them. But if you can look at such a ripe pair of vampire tits and say you don't want some of that, then you are the one with shit taste.</br>  <br>You mean like a crusade?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>That lolis got a fat butt dude.</br>  <br>Those aren't ripe, they are old and disgusting.</br>  <br>Sounds good to me.</br>  If only she was a vampire...

Vampires are a parasite.</br>  <br> 2 Flandre <br>Why did you change Remilia's name to Flandre?</br></br>  <br>What if you  let the  blonde vampire  grow up ?</br>  I don't understand the question.  <br> sucking off mens dick <br><br>Oh god.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Player 1 and Player 2</br></br>  <br> vampire <br> grow up <br><br>Also many has adult forms, but just let them stay superior loli.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kids actually don't have less brain power they just have less prior experiences to draw knowledge from.</br></br>  <br>The brain rapidly expands in knowledge as a child, but it matures and becomes more rational in making common human decisions during late puberty, say 18 or 19.</br>  FUCK NO<br><br>But here's some pink.</br></br>  <br>H-How did I miss that thread?</br>  <br>Are you retarded? It matures with experience, but not physically, Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Vampires are also magical, so they can ignore any of that type of nonsense.</br>  <br> NOT separating sword lolis into its own category. <br>Come on, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</br></br>  <br>Because Remilia is shit compared to Flandre?</br>  <br>From my understanding, you not only add experiences that improve your rationality, but the brain also expands in size to accommodate for the extra neurons and shit that let you process more things at once when you're more physically mature. <br><br>Another reason why I dislike vampires; the archetype is just a cop-out to make a character very strong and smart with no necessary explanation other than "haha it's vampire magic!"<br>It's a pussy move for writers, and often it shits all over the trope and makes it unbearable to watch in anime and Hollywood movies alike. <br>I see Shinobu and I think Edward Cullen, they're the same shit in my eyes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I hate magic, it's not real at all </br>  <br>magic is for losers fuckface</br>  <br>I just hope that we will be able to add Chachazero back to the chart sometime soon.</br>  <br>Does vampire magic also explain what they do to my dick? Because that's also a mystery.</br>  While blonde loli vampires are amazing, the true perfection is silver haired vampires.  <br> Rachel <br> loli <br><br>I'm getting tired of your shit you faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if they are just misunderstood?</br>  <br>We only got a handful of them so no.</br>  <br>Me too</br>  <br>Just look at her, not a loli.</br>  <br>yep</br>  <br><br>LRD pls go. We are tired of you.</br></br>  Don't reply to it, /a/    <br>There is only 1 loli in this picture.</br>  <br>Ragna is a filthy lolipedo.<br>He is scum.</br></br>  <br><br>She used her magic.</br></br>    <br><br><br>I fucked up as always.</br></br></br>  I'll take them if you're tired.  <br>Rachel is still in the list.</br>  <br>Zenkichi's Mom isn't immortal and Erika isn't a loli.</br>  <br> hurr everything and anything relating to fantasy is shit <br>You're spending way too much time on such a bad bait.</br></br>  <br>you don't belong in this world</br>  <br>What for?</br>  <br>I don't care if a medium features magic and fantasy. I'm just taking about the subject of vampires and demonic beings and how they're irresponsibly used to vindicate a character's strength; strength they probably don't deserve anyways.</br>  <br> I don't care if a medium features magic and fantasy. <br>So you have nothing against vampires. I'm glad we've come to an agreement.</br></br>  Rachel, Erika and Etna are more hebe tier, really.  <br>Hey, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Original eternal loli list anon here. Can you also change the title to Eternal Loli? Immortal might give the wrong kind of connotation.<br><br>It's fine now, but I still think you should differentiate between Swords and Objects.</br></br></br>  <br>Blonde loli vampires are like the air we breathe.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who sees how full of shit, insipid, and uninspired these characters are? <br>Enjoy fapping to your waifu I guess.</br></br>  <br>I never liked them in the first place. Most loli archetypes in general are annoying. Vampires are all irredeemable shit except one who isn't /a/ related.</br>  <br>Under 150 cm and little girls' body = loli.</br>  <br>can i rub my cock all over that girl's body? can i urinate on her? i have never seen the show, i have no idea how shed react.</br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>Thanks mr skeletal</br>  <br>Nopan is the only choice.</br>  <br> blonde <br>It's shit. <br><br>All loli vampires are great. And some of the most perfect don't have blonde hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Blonde is literally the best hair color for lolis anything else is shit especially blue.</br>  <br>I'm sorry, but the only thing that is shit here is your taste, anon. You might be beyond saving.</br>  <br>I can't even imagine how shitty some of the cutest lolis would look with blonde hair. Like Ren-chon or Yotsuba.<br>Blonde hair just wouldn't fit them.</br></br>  <br> get tired <br>They actually stimulate me</br></br>  <br> baww magic is only okay when it's not vampires </br>  <br> there will never be a proper Shinobu Couch figurine <br><br>Forever mad. Fuck Japan for putting way too much emphasis on the donuts.</br></br></br>  <br>I love all loli vampire, blonde or not and eva from negima is mai waifu. <br><br>But for some unknow reason I fucking hate shinobu.<br><br>Really don't know why, I just hate her so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its her shitty voice.</br>  <br> Really don't know why <br>Probably the amount of dick you are ingesting daily.</br></br>  <br> Really don't know why <br>Must be your shit taste acting up again.</br></br>  <br> and eva from negima is mai waifu <br><br>What is your opinion on UQ Holder?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really like her new design.<br><br>Thanks god Ken give us plenty of her old form in the current arc.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>But I do like Eva, Hazuki, nina, krul, remilia, flandre, rachel, leticia etc. It's only shinobu I hate.<br><br>Oh, and sunako too. But it's normal to hate sunako right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because you like another monogatari girl and hate that Shinobu is the undisputed best heroine in the series.</br>  <br>Don't be selfish anon, some of our favorite lolis don't have any merchandise at all.</br>  <br>That's true, but it's specifically because she's one of the ones that gets merch that it's so frustrating that none of it does her justice.<br><br>At least she has a lot of H.</br></br></br>  <br>It's comparable to breathing.</br>  <br>Would you add someone to that if it was a major spoiler?</br>  <br>Isn't Shinobu the /a/ loli vampire with the most merch and porn?<br>I guess Remilia and Flandre both beat her in that field, but they're /jp/.</br></br>  <br>She has quite a lot of merch and porn for a loli in general, let alone a loli vampire. That said, most of her figurines don't do her any justice. They just go for the generic cute loli appeal with donuts.<br><br>Doujinshi are better in that regard because they generally focus on Shinobu's mature side, but even they often take liberties with her character.</br></br></br>  <br>Hnnng</br>  Feels good to have shinobu as my waifu.<br>If i feel like fucking a beatiful mature 27 years old woman it's ok, but if i want to give some love to that sweet 8 years old mouth it's still ok</br>  <br>I'm not one for older characters so after reading Kizu and getting to know Kissshot I lost a lot of personal interest in her character, but even I can admit she is the best looking monogatari and a really wonderful girl.</br>  <br>You should add Hestia in the god category.</br>  <br>But he already did.<br> Sunako </br></br>  <br><br>I'd like to point out a few more for archival purposes:<br><br>Anime<br>Tsukumo Sakuya from Absolute Duo (I'm not even sure if she's a child or not, perhaps it's revealed later in the LNs? If not, probably Strange Existence)<br>Shimazu Nami from Isuca (Doll, debatable since she actually is old, but she only shows her loli doll form)<br>Scheherazade from Magi (either Magical or Construct, same as above)<br><br>VNs<br>Samael from Tokyo Babel (Angel)<br>Rino Reno from Taiyou no Promia (long-lived demi-human, not sure what category that would fit into)<br>Didio/Dedeko from Gyakushuu 5 (dragon, debatable if loli or not, but she's certainly presented as one)<br>Alesia from You∞Gaku (Vampire)<br>Banshee from Racial Merge (Strange Existence)<br>Hirayama Alice from Root Harem (Strange Existence)<br>Lycoris and Imnty (spelling not agreed upon) from Duel Savior (Grimoires)<br>Sonono Nene from Eroge! (Strange Existence)<br>Mephisto from Injoku Toshi (Demon)<br>Oboro from Aku no Onna Kanbu (Alien)<br>Vendetta from Silverio Vendetta (I'm not sure about her nature, I plan to read the VN soon. /jp/ may know.)<br>Ruu from Kuroinu (halfling, possibly under Dwarf?)<br>Carmilla from the Venus Blood series (Vampire)<br><br>Also, a few notes:<br>-In the "God" category, Tsurugi is from Sasami-san<br>-Ilya from Trinity Seven isn't a loli, she's just a bit short<br>-In the "Dragon" category, Sheeta should be changed to Theta (the makers misspelled that, it's meant to be the latter)<br><br>I also want to say that you're doing a great thing for /a/, and you have our thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's robot lolis, that also don't age</br>  The best immortal loli  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128207296 <br>not 100% sure but i think its a very special artwork of rou-kyuu-bu. her name is hinata</br>  <br>Why do I find the Needless girls so attractive?<br>Why are there no good doujins?</br></br>  <br>For me it was the opposite thing, after kizu i started loving her even more because the LN shows how's she's an innocent being and while she is a caring and mature woman that acts like a mother, she's still a kid in the inside. I want to pat her head and hug her, being a little shorter than her will reward me with some nice boobs under my chin. <br> ftw 170cm 5'7 manlet <br> ftw atleast i'm 5cm taller than araragi-let </br></br></br>  <br>Even with her  suicidal  tendencies?</br>  <br>It's just because she was sad and alone, nothing can be cured by some good old love.<br>I've watched the whole anime and read Kizu, and up to now those tendences are gone, bit since i don't know jap and i can't find good translation i can only wait<br>  i've read somewhere about araragi an her being the only left alive 100 years later or something, if you know care to give me a little sneak peek? I've heard something about ougi and killing who hurt araragi but i don't want to spoil more about it, I'm just curious on my waifu being alone with a strange guy[spoiler/] </br></br></br>  <br>Because, Kami is a lolicon who knows how to make good lolis and other girls <br><br> Why are there no good doujins? <br>It's not popular, but hopefully madhouse will eventually do a remake or something</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've only fully read what's been translated, but I have spoiled myself a lot. The 100 year thing is just people knowing that eventually Crab will die and due to Rararagi's vampire traits he'll probably keep living for awhile and eventually him and Shinobu will be the only ones left, basically Shinobu is playing the long game.<br>If you want real spoilers there's good book summaries on the wiki, also bakatsuki has a nice timeline of events if you just want to know all the major events without actually reading who all was involved and what not.<br>Though even if you don't want spoilers you should at least read http://bakemonogatari.wikia.com/wik<wbr>i/Monogatari_Short_Stories</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You know speaking of monogatari, fuck Bakemonogatari for stealing all the attention Needless deserved.</br>  I should read Needless  <br> mutations are know considered a race </br>  <br>You should masturbate to Disc first.</br>  <br>Araragi will probably live forever unless something kills him. It takes very, very little regeneration to counteract aging and Araragi's regeneration is even higher than some vampires.<br><br>Also I wonder if Shinobu will really be able to maintain status quo for that long. They've only been together for like a year and at times they both have a pretty hard time restraining their sexual tension.<br><br>She said they'd kiss in 100 years but Araragi ended up kissing her like a month later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someday you will be able to buy a robo-loli. Don't give up hope anon.</br>  Do blonde trap vampires count?  <br><br>traps are traps, not lolis.</br></br>  <br>How about if they come with their master blonde loli vampire ?</br>  Subs when? edition.

People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance programme administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians.

It's so clear why he has to dress up as a girl, it was stated that if he went out with her as Shidou it would cause a scandal so they decided to have him dress up as a girl. That's why you faggot.</br>  <br> retards actually believe this <br>It's like you missed the entire point of her arc and the date in volume 8 plus Ratatoskr have special places for dates. It's just blatant pandering hidding behind a bullshit excuse.</br></br>  <br>it isn't. I read a short story where Miku was talking to her manager through the phone and asking if she could post some pictures of her a Shidou which wasn't allowed becuase of the scandal it could create. She then asked if she could do it with a "female" friend, that point onwards it became like this. On the other hand, you just hate Miku, that's all, just becuase of her obsession with girls. She's not a bad character, you're just a trastalker and hater.</br>  <br>Did you miss her actual short story where Shidou becomes her manager? This alone makes it possible to date her since male producers exist in anime and maga, also again Ratatoskr has special places prepared for dates. We just saw one in volume 12, stop trying to defend Miku's current character because it's terrible and yeah she's shit because the only thing she does is flirting with girls and that's it, even the twins are less one dimensional especially Yuzuru who acts mature when she is not with Kaguya.</br>  So what's she like in the LN? Not the anime, I hear she's toned down in the anime. More gay but not gay for MC? Sounds like a dumb character.  <br>Miku was cure and likeable in volume 8-9 then she becomes a full lesbian for no reason after volume 9.<br><br>How can a girl be gay for a guy?</br></br></br>  <br>cute**</br>  What's your range?          <br>Who's in the middle?</br>  <br>Pico from boku no pico.</br>  Disgusting cowtits  <br> Delicious cowtits <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>    Concave  <br> B.O.T.Y.A.Y. </br>    <br>Patrician range coming through.</br>  <br>Kukaku Shiba from Bleach.</br>  <br>Was going to make a chart but this is pretty much my range.
