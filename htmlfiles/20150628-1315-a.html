[ The UBW adaptation is finally over along with her shitty heroine.<br><br>Rejoice, comrades. It's finally time for best girl to shine.</br></br>  Dubs for Mooki.  <br>:^)</br>  No HF info after the epilogue?  <br>Okay then</br>  <br>Agreed it's time the King got her due.</br>  Indeed.  <br><br>disliked her in FSN<br>wasn't present in UBW<br><br>just playing hollow ataraxia as we speak and already love her. dat manipulative passive agressiveness puts Ghandi to shame</br></br></br></br></br>  damn right.  <br>Why Sakura is so best?</br>  <br><br>UBW is finally over. We HF now, fuckers.</br></br>  <br>They just showed the same trailer as before and said it's on the way. TM is probably focusing on GO since it seems to be coming out at the end of July. Read the HF manga to hold you over for now since it's pretty good.</br>  Sure.    is Shirou cool and handsome like in UBW in HF<br> :^) </br>    <br>Do people actually give a fuck about Saber anymore? I mean back in the day she was pretty much the only thing available but nowadays you've got saints&amp;emperors&amp;treasonous knights&amp;whatnot and the welsh broad can't really hold a candle to them.</br>  Who hyped for the best fight in the visual novel here?  <br> Do people actually give a fuck about Saber anymore? <br>They're just in hiding. If you look at most TM forums or polls, she's still the most popular heroine. After episode 22 and even know, there were a bunch of people asking for UFO table to do the fate route.</br></br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br>Fuck do I love this part, no strategies, no magic and no weapons. Just duking it out in a final hurrah.</br>  <br><br>considering the amount of merchandise she still gets yes. good luck trying to find a decent Caster or Lancer figure. if pic related was done in a decent scale it would be an instabuy for me</br></br>    <br>What the fuck is Curry doing there?</br>  <br>HF is on it's way</br>  <br>Shirou is manly enough to steal bitches from another series.</br>  <br>Curry gives the Red Man his shroud, making him the Red Man.</br>  <br>Okay secondaryfag here, more or less i understand about this fight but failed to get the hype, what's so good anyway about beating an old man on it's last breath? he'll die anyway with or without this fight.</br>  <br>They are both dying. Shirou has swords literally impaling throughout his body, and even acted as armor against Kotomine.<br>Its two men beating the shit out of each other just so one of them can live a few seconds longer than the other.</br></br>  <br>It's two people with their lives on a timer, on their last leg, engaged in a battle of sheer will power to to make their goals succeed. What's not to get hype about?</br>  <br>Hopefully, if we get a decent adaptation, you'll know why</br>  <br>It's a fist fight between two dying men one good and one evil. it's so simple but it's so good.</br>  <br>I hope they animate this fight insanely realistic. doing crazy flips and shit is cool as a fuck but that's not what shirou vs kirei is about.</br>  SAKURA'S SAKURAS  <br>You'll get superman flips and you'll like it because that's what HF is about.</br>  <br>That's what I'm worried about as well. In fact, I want it slowed down a bit to emphasize that they are both dying and not Kotomine pulling off crazy martial arts moves.</br>  <br>If its directed by Miura I would expect it to be like the Episode 20 part of Shirou vs Archer when it comes to the fight and monologue.</br>  <br>I know it's too far into production but I hope it isn't Ufotable doing the movie. Or that the movie would be so bad it would need a reboot by another studio. HF doesn't deserve the same shitty treatment that UBW got.</br>  WORMSLUT  <br>If they animate it like KnK, it should be fine. It needs emphasis on the atmosphere rather than the shounenish action in UBW.</br>    <br>Any good place to read it ? I</br>  <br>Why is she so perfect?<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Who is this  cutie puppy ?</br>  <br>Ufotable animated the rape scene in the KnK movie format. Heaven's feel will be fine in movie format.</br>  <br>Miura took out the rape in KnK 6.</br>  <br>Shiki was supposed to be raped by her blond male evil twin ?</br>  <br>The girl who got drugs injected into her was supposed to be raped and pregnant instead.</br>  <br>Ok. Weird</br>  <br>Not after ufotable fucked up Kirei v Kiritsugu, I'm not.</br>  <br> best girl <br>Go back to being fucked by worms.</br></br>  <br>I would pay to see this.</br>  <br>Yes we better get DEEN to do the movie right?</br>  <br>You have no idea what you are talking about.</br>  <br><br>I thought the fight itself was fine. The only thing I didn't like was that they used The battle is to the strong instead of asking for new music.</br></br>  <br>You're that kind of guy that just likes to wail for every fucking thing aren't you?<br><br> Kill yourself </br></br></br>  <br>Because it's beautiful in the simplicity of its brutality.</br>  <br> this is literally a show for the same children as power rangers </br>  <br>They'll grow up like MEN.</br>  <br> one of the best fight on Fate franchise <br> fucked up <br><br>Go back to your MUH superior still image and MUH drama CD. <br><br><br> The only thing i didn't like was that they used the best insert song for the best fight scene <br><br>Literally wat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like the song, but it didn't really fit the scene. And again, that fight is a pretty big deal so it should've used new music.</br></br>  <br> movie <br> most /a/ will watch it after 2,3 years  <br>sadly, Sakura will be always in shadow of new TV anime heroine</br></br></br>  <br>The monologue Shirou has regarding their similarities, and the speech Kotomine gives, make the manly fist fight.</br>  <br>Of course!</br>    <br> no Shinji <br><br>How? Why? What.</br></br></br>  <br>Excellent comeback.</br>  <br>Who would Shirou brought up by Kotomine grow up to be?</br>  <br>Read F/A</br>  <br>why ufoWormslut is such a babe?</br>  W O R M S L U T<br>O<br>R<br>M<br>S<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura is the problem here. If he's not at the helm of HF, it should be all right.<br><br>Not only with changes of rape and stuff like that, the whole feel and pacing issues that UBW had, and that KnK6 also had.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll adapt RN anyway</br>  <br> If he's not at the helm of HF, it should be all right. <br>Isn't he doing the storyboards?</br></br>  <br>A  cute Mooki belonging to a certain pigtailed girl. </br>  Think we'll see rape?  <br> Best Girl <br> No Saber <br> No Illya <br> No Caster <br>I think we may have a problem here...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no medusa <br><br>A real big problem</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is at her best outside of her own route.</br>  <br>Yeah. Because she's barely around.</br>    <br> along with her shitty heroine <br><br>Don't talk shit about archer, you fcking wormfucker.</br></br></br>  <br> Wormfucker <br>*mongrel</br></br>  I will cry out if HF is directed by Takayuki Hirao. That would be the best adaptation of our times.  <br> fcking <br>Underage detected.</br></br>  <br>UBW was just the test run.<br>Sakura is Ufotable's waifu, and that's why she had the best character design.</br></br>  <br>Not that it'll see much use until at least 2016.</br>  <br> implying it's not Saber <br> implying Heaven's Feel isn't a test run for a Fate adaption </br></br>    <br> implying Fate adaptation won't be a test run for a new Illya route </br>  <br> Saber and Ilya <br>I have the weirdest boner</br></br>  <br> Best Girl <br> Posts Wormslut </br></br>  <br>Saber + Illya &gt; Any other waifus</br>  <br> 6 KB <br> 250x140 </br></br>  <br>But as far as we know, he's not directing. There's still a difference because the main issue is how content, character interaction and overall feel will be handled, and that's more the director's territory.<br><br>He did storyboards for /Zero too, not only UBW, so not doing it for HF would end up doing away with some of the visual identity of Ufotable's Fate adaptations.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, it'll be glorious.<br>A shame we'll have to put up with sakura too, though.</br></br>  <br> Offend mine eyes <br>Good.</br></br>  Did anyone else prefer the VN over the adaptation? The adaptation was almost perfect and expanded upon things like the epilogue and Caster's previous master but it lacked suspense and wasn't exciting to watch whereas the VN had me on the edge of my seat  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8qA<wbr>E_Th1b_4</wbr>  [ ]<br> 20 hour route <br> 90 minute movie <br>What could go wrong?</br></br></br>  <br> delusional Saberfags </br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it'll be multiple movies. They'll still have to make a lot to make it worth while though.<br><br>Also, no guarantee the movie will only be 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't agree more</br>  <br>I love Saber, but Medusa still makes me rock hard.<br><br>I'll be seeing myself out...</br></br></br>  <br>Can you tell me what tomorrow's stock prices will be, or do your oracle powers only work for anime?</br>  <br>That's what I'm wondering myself.<br><br>Even if they cut of all the boring cooking scenes etc. there's no fucking way it will be a good adaptation of the route as a whole.<br><br>Hell, the final fight and the aftermath of it should take at least 20 minutes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber would whore herself out for a sandwich and Illya exists to pander to pedophiles.</br>  Reminder that Rin was legitimately trying to kill Shirou  <br> whore herself out for a sandwich <br>I'm cool with that.<br><br> pedophiles <br>*lolicon. There's a difference.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that no.</br>  <br>I don't think that's true.</br>  <br>Reminder that Rin created a fucking reproduction of the legendary second magic in order to try to kill her sister.<br><br>Yet she chose to save Shinji in UBW without blinking.</br></br></br>  <br>Only for anime<br>I haven't been wrong yet</br></br>  <br> can't hit someone running down a narrow hallway <br>Rin is a terrible magus.</br></br>  <br>They could make a full movie out of just the last day and epilogue and still not have enough time to cover everything.</br>  <br> Saber would whore herself out for a sandwich <br>What if the sandwich is really good, though? It can't be wrong if it's a really good sandwich, can it?</br></br>  <br>Has Manaka fallen in love with this Saber yet?</br>  <br>Nah. She's still all about the D.</br>  <br>Then maybe Merlin can help.</br>  <br>Proto Saber's Britain, is exactly the same as Artoria's right?<br><br>Gawain, Lancelot, etc being all the same?</br></br></br>  <br>Minus knowing that seiba's a girl, assumingly</br>  <br>Nothing that really compares to her obsession with Arthur.</br>  <br>Higher res</br>  <br><br>Oh she was just playing around then?<br>Just joking when she was firing those deadly magical projectiles at him?</br></br></br>  <br>Read the bad end that happens if Shirou loses that fight.</br>  <br> Senpai... <br> S-senpai... <br> Um...Senpai... </br></br></br>  <br>Shinji is an actual character who can be redeemed and is the deepest character in the franchise. He's simply misguided, even Gilgamesh recognizes his greatness and chose to serve him. When found out Kirei died he barely cared, but having to kill Shinji was clearly something which he was barely capable of handling.</br>  <br> Shinji <br> Redeemed <br>Friendly reminder that he raped his sister</br></br></br>  <br>im just glad best guy appeared</br>  <br>Will probably continue doing so while Shirou is busy with being an ISIS jihadist.</br>  I just notice Sakura is wearing Taiga's clothes in the final episode. She really doesn't have anything other than uniforms does she?  <br>People kill eachother all the time in the war and his sister lusts for sex. If anything she's the one at fault for constantly alluring him, if she didn't want it them she would just reject, stupid bitch.</br>  <br> Shirou is in ISIS <br> Shinji is a rapist <br>Damn Fate has some good protagonists.</br></br></br>  <br>Rapist and a terrorist, good job nasu</br>  <br> meet a murderous bitch who's taking a break from summoning the motherfucking Beast of Revelation to practice her Scott Bakula impression <br> join her LARPing group in exchange for food <br>Goddamn it Seiba.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Gawain, if you only hadn't traumatized her with your potatoes she might have develop a moral system more complex than offers tasty food=worth of following.</br>  <br>Lance confirmed better knight</br>  <br> &gt;join her LARPing group <br>I love this about Manaka. She spends most of the time just building her harem of Servants and shitting on anyone who won't play ball.</br></br>  <br>wait they are really making the final alternate time line arc from the old visual novel where sakura goes apes shit on every one ?!?! why now ? it should have been after the one where archer survives years ago</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br>Or maybe it's similar to the original myth, considering Proto Saber IS King Arthur.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying it wasn't a good thing <br>Just ask Shirou. His cooking enabled him to obtain access to King Arthur's vagina.</br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br> Lance confirmed better knight <br> Lance <br> better than Gawain <br>Look at this fabulousness &amp; say that again.</br></br></br></br>  <br> King Arthur's vagina. <br>I just realized how weird this sounds when said aloud</br></br>  <br>I'd assume not, as Merlin wouldn't have to help Proto Saber make Mordred. Also, the existence of a Y chromosome would have given Mordred the potential to be a male, making it more similar to the original legend.</br>  <br>Lance confirmed better knight</br>  <br>Mordred confirmed better knight</br>  <br>Female Gawain &gt; Mordred</br>  <br>Try saying, "King Arthur is a woman with a penis and testicles."</br>  <br>Doesn't have the same ring</br>  <br><br>Anon(s) confirmed shit taste<br><br>Anon confirmed great taste</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Try "I ejaculated inside of King Arthur's vagina" or be Rin &amp; say "I had lesbian sex with King Arthur".</br></br>   thumbnail looks like Rin is about to give Shirou head <br><br>Oh baby.</br></br>  <br>Nope. Still Mordred.</br>  What was the part with the desert at the end supposed to symbolise exactly?  <br>Shirou surpassing Archer in removing ISIS.</br>  <br>I want to protect this smile.</br>  <br>Incorrect. Shirou IS ISIS. Need I repost the picture?</br>  <br>Slanderous propaganda. Shirou is a seigi no mikata. Are you saying a seigi no mikata would join ISIS?</br>  <br>[[Wasteland Scene<br>After the credits. The same wasteland as at the beginning.<br>Shirou is walking alone. Exhausted, he comes to a stop.<br>When he looks down, there are signs that somebody was here before him. (This is where Archer stopped.)<br>He sighs, and looks up. Though his expression is a little weary, it is also full of hope.<br>With a purposeful stride, he begins walking forward again.<br>The camera stays at Archer's footprints, watching Shirou's back as it recedes into the distance. End Scene.<br>(If you need to make it easier to understand, have Archer appear at his footprints after Shirou leaves, watching over him... though hopefully you won't have to do that.)]] <br><br>By Mcjon from Nasu's blog</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Everyone knows that ISIS members are seigi no mikata.</br>  <br>Dunno. He made best friends with Shinji in HA.</br>  <br>Movie when ? Still no fucking info since july last year</br>  <br>For some reason I feel like Fragments is kind of like an otome story with the MC as the villain. It probably has something to do with the fact that most of the cast members shown are magical bishounen.</br>  <br>Those things shes shotting kinda suck. Why not use a gun instead?</br>  <br>Next year, at the soonest. Ufotable got busy with God Eater and Tales, so they're probably not rushing to get HF done. They might be slowing down the pace at which they churn out Fate anime, so they can work on other stuff.</br>  <br>That Shirou doesn't stop where Archer stopped and keeps moving on living the life of a seigi no mikata instead of focusing about its ends.<br><br>Notice how the anime cuts to shirou foot stepping on a similar cinematographic spot that Archer disappears. Then you see Shirou's smile.</br></br></br>  <br>Any gun Rin touched would turn into a Glock.</br>  <br>A break from Fate is what they need for the Heaven's Feel movies to turn out good.</br>  there was a CM at the end of UBW's last episode., but nothing new. At least, we know they didn't forget about it.<br><br>but why last episode ??? (Last route?)<br><br>here is the CM: https://d.maxfile.ro/voinqduhks.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the context it is probably just a reference to HF's stutus as the last route in FSN.</br>  https://imgrush.com/E_hTp6VmhV0Y.mp<wbr>4</wbr>  <br> That Whirlpool of Fate <br><br> still no release date </br></br></br>  If there's one thing I'm hyped about it's this.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/6wLHKS6EOko?t=30m3<wbr>9s</wbr>  [ ]</br>   inb4 they don't use church on the hill YET AGAIN <br> inb4 they don't use this illusion piano </br>  <br>No, they are talking about the "Last Episode" (in the VN with the Avalon thing)<br><br>it is going to be included in Fate HF</br></br></br>  <br> Expecting Shirou vs Kotomine from thumbnail <br> goes right into Die Lorelei </br></br>  <br>LE's saberfag pandering doesn't really make sense as something that they would try to stuff into HF.</br>  <br> all those godawful days until the last 3 <br>Despite all the cool shit in HF, I can't even get hyped. Sakura and post-Sakura Shirou are just such unlikeable characters and I never want them to succeed.</br></br>  <br>I'm not quite sure how LE could work it's way into HF, they're probably with talking about HF being the last route or animating LE separately.</br>  <br> liking or disliking characters based on their morality <br>I bet you don't like Kirei either.</br></br>  I am the bone of my missile<br>Steel my body and jet fuel my blood<br>I have created over a thousand JETS<br>Have fired over a thousand missiles<br>yet jet fuel will never melt steel beams<br>So as I pray, UNLIMITED JET WORKS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, don't watch it.</br>  <br>I like Kirei, but both of them are such unlikeable fucking idiots. There is no reason why I should even want Shirou to succeed, he throws away everything for the worst person in existance.</br>  <br> inb4 they don't use this illusion piano <br>Sounds about right. It's a narration heavy scene there with the piano for atmosphere. Most of it will probably be cut for time.</br></br>  <br> no new teaser <br> show the old one <br>It's like they want to torture me</br></br></br>  Whatever. Right now Ufotable have problems with God Eater production, because of f/sn high quality.<br> HF first movie 2017-2018 <br> BD release 2018-2019 <br>But anyway I gonna watch HF movies in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really based on morality, but based on personality. I just can't stand Sakura's personality, and Shirou's not fun with her. Different anon by the way</br>  <br>Ok explain me what the fuck that ending, Shirou ended like Archer again? or he cums inside tohsaka every single day and live in happiness?</br>  <br> They don't care about HF </br>  <br>The word you're looking for it slow paced.<br>I agree that HF was definitely a harder read than the other two, but in the end that was only positive, at least for me.<br><br>Kirei literally wants to throw everything thing IN EXISTANCE away because he wants help some monster be born out of pure curiosity.<br>If you don't understand Shirou in HF then I am sad to tell you that HF was literally too deep for you. His character was a subversion of the previous routes in which he always chose the greater good above his personal happiness.<br>In HF he decides for pursuing what he wants over what's good for everyone else. I think it's pretty relatable.<br><br> Most of it will probably be cut for time <br> Sounds about right <br><br>Are you fucking nuts? If they cut out Shirou's inner monologue then HF would be fucking terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I like listening to this scene just to hear Kirei's lines again </br>  <br>GO Assassin is in Fragments?</br>  <br> tfw i sometimes listen to his voice in my head <br><br> EMIYA SHIROU <br> YOROKOBE, SHOUNEN </br></br></br></br>  <br> You said an older brother protects his younger sister, right? <br> ...Yeah, I'm the older sister. So I have to protect my younger brother <br>EVERY TIMEEEE</br></br></br>  <br> Post <br><br>The man had his fucking body broken just for his soul to liner until put into a doll. The fuck are you on.</br></br></br>  <br>Different person, I like HF thematically but the fact that Shirou throws away his ideals for fucking Sakura makes it less enjoyable for me.</br>  <br>Same with me - I like the concept of the route, but I just don't like Sakura enough to fully appreciate Shirou's change.</br>  <br>He goes on to become a hero and may or may not end up dancing at the end of a rope like Archer did. I guess that his hair not turning white from the overuse projection is supposed to be taken as a sign that he is somewhat smarter about his hero of justice thing than the Archer was.</br>  <br>So do you not like it because of Sakura or becuase he abandons his ideals?</br>  <br>I understand what his purpose and everything is, but after seeing how gallantly he followed his ideals in UBW despite being directly confronted with what would seem like absolute failure, discarding them just for Sakura was awful. Letting all those people die and killing fucking Saber was painful to even read through.</br>  <br> Saber: Mega rehash <br>Good shit.</br></br>  <br> throws away his ideals <br>You mean the ideals that were revealed to be hollow, based on survivors guilt and making him a generally unhappy person? Yeah, terrible thing to lose.</br></br>  <br>I found it the other way around. I thought Shirou's ideals in UBW were so hamfisted and all about how he is right and everybody else is wrong that Shirou came off as a literal retard, while the throwing it away to defend his family felt much more natural.</br>  <br>Because UBW was TALK TALK TALK, his ideals weren't really challenged as he had to experience nothing that challenged them first-hand, just stuff Archer told him.</br>  <br> and making him a generally unhappy person <br>Fate and UBW Shirou seemed to keep them pretty well. In fact, Fate Shirou pretty much gets eternal happiness and his waifu</br></br>  <br> based on survivors guilt <br>Here we go.</br></br>  <br>The bad end for that scene is literally one of the few in the game that you could really argue isn't bad.</br>  <br>I thought it made HF Normal a very fitting end. The crime judging him and all that.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>I guess that's a good point. <br>I marathoned Fate and UBW but read HF weeks later, so it wasn't really in comparison for me. I didn't like UBW anyway and I hated Shirou's ideals (as I think you are supposed to).</br></br>  <br>Yes. He's Bahsahka in Fragments, though. His Master died from a melted brain and was resurrected as a zombie just to fuck with Assassin.</br>  <br>I mean, it makes sense how Shirou himself cares for Sakura and discards his ideals for her. But personally as the reader, I think it's not worth it for Sakura, while Shirou may think so.</br>  <br>They were plenty challenged, but it was a type of challenge Shirou was built to fight again. He'd always been fighting against himself after all.</br>  <br>France vs Britain Saber and Ruler scenes please, Nasu.</br>  <br> That EMIYA ost start <br><br>Got an erection every time the fight begins.</br></br></br>  <br>They were definitely challenged, Archer was constantly telling him how his life would turn out if he kept following it. He knew for a fact that he was going to have to commit actions that would be considered regrettable but he'd still be steadfast in living his life in that way without regret. <br><br>It wasn't even TALK TALK TALK, that was just the anime. The actual route was mostly getting to follow Shirou's thoughts and getting to understand how he worked them through within his mind without needing everything said out loud.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean up to the start of fs/n.<br>Of course your mental condition gets better if you get loving waifu thrown at you.<br><br>I wasn't in the cancerfest that were UBW threads, but is that actually a controversial statement? Isn't that the literal whole point of UBW?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's explicitly pointed out in the VN that his ideals were not based on survivor's guilt.</br>  <br>I just don't like Sakura much. The abusive past thing fell flat for me and didn't make her as sympathetic as I assume Nasu was aiming for. Then again, I like UBW Shirou and sympathize with the aspiration to be a hero even if it's unreachable, so maybe I can't appreciate HF.</br>  <br>GudaGuda Order is great. Self advertising at its best.</br>  <br>No, Shirou admired Kerry and tried to be like him.</br>  <br>Got a screen or anything of that?</br>  <br> His Master died from a melted brain and was resurrected as a zombie just to fuck with Assassin. <br>Good times. Seeing the cutest Hassan suffering just makes her even cuter.</br></br>    <br>I didn't read the VN in a long time, but I'm petty sure Shirou repeatedly said something about him being saved and the others not being and having to repay that debt.</br>  <br>I do want to see Bedivere in Grand Order. GudaGuda Order makes a joke of him having a better chance than Nobu and Sakura Saber, but I'm genuinely interested in what his abilities would be.</br>  <br> discarding them just for Sakura was awful <br>As opposed to what, trying to save everyone including Sakura, then failing to save anyone?<br><br><br>"The fire ten years ago.<br>Because I was the only one who survived, I lived on, swearing never to let such a disaster occur again."<br>[PIC]<br><br>"The atonement.<br>Am I going to betray my previous self, who had to cling to that atonement to continue living?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Fate. Not in UBW, where the ideal is actually confronted and he admits </br>  <br> HF_Good_End.jpg </br>  <br>He also, says it In HF. <br>UBW is just conveniently changed.</br></br>  <br>Oh, he's blushing! Such a cutie patooty!<br><br>I will proceed to search and not be spoonfed then.</br></br></br>  <br> Everything in HF is shit until the end <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8y<wbr>e-eSdYxM</wbr>  [ ]<br>Opinion invalidated</br></br></br>  <br> UBW is just conveniently changed. <br>What the hell are you trying to say exactly?</br></br>  <br><br>Anyone who thinks Shirou doesn't suffer survivors guilt is fucking retarded, but I guess I can't prove that without digging into the VN again.<br>I can just say that the monologue of a character isn't always absolute truth. I'll be stopping now.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay yes, Mapo Tofu was good but that doesn't fix the entire rest before the last days.</br>  <br>I never really liked the criticism that "Shirou's ideals are borrowed". Pretty much every person's moral beliefs and ideals are borrowed if you take borrowed to mean "learned from parents, or from anyone else".</br>  <br>It's entirely possible that he does suffer survivor's guilt, the point of that scene is that that's not the source of his hero complex.</br>  <br>He does, but that's not why he has the ideal.</br>  <br>UBW is the only route he realizes it in. Shirou even makes a point of trying to block it out of his mind when Archer is shoving it in his face.</br>  <br>I love how everyone shits on HF for being boring until the last 3 days because it literally has no shounen bullshit when it has the shadow, Zouken, Ilya, True Assassin, then the whole school scene and the big reveal about the worm thing, Mapo Tofu, Kotomine and Shirou teaming up to save Ilya, and Archer's arm just to name a few.</br>  <br>Or you should realise that UBW Shirou digs far deeper than HF and Fate Shirou in terms of ideals</br>  <br>HF was a rollercoaster to me. It was pretty exciting at the beginning, then it fucking stopped for a while, and then it got really good.</br>  <br>well they DID have music they could have used<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8kq<wbr>ls64aYUs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  All we're ever going to get for Fate is that piece of shit that DEEN made  <br>I don't remember much but I was certainly interested throughout most of the route. It had a lot more mystery to it than the other routes.</br>  <br>Unless you actually like Sakura or Shirou after he's changing more towards Sakura, it's hard to bear with anything but the last 3 days. The last 3 days had some moments that were good enough to ignore that or just didn't make those things relevant.</br>  <br>It was the monologue of Archer, that Shirou tried to deny but knew was true.</br>    <br>I didn't mind Sakura at all. She isn't my favorite Fate girl but her yandere moments were some of my favorites.<br>I didn't like Shirou until HF anyway.</br></br>  <br>That version of Emiya is great, but I prefer  Prisma's <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jiR<wbr>dixLq38o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Better than nothing</br></br>  <br>Most of those people say that hate everything involving Sakura or all of her scenes were boring, There is a whole lot of Sakura there.</br>  <br>Literally the only parts of Fate that would have actually been exciting were off-screen. Archer vs Berserker and Lancer vs Gilgamesh were the only fights that had potential and we never got to see them.</br>  <br>You don't like a character who's being crazy heroic instead of selfish?</br>    <br><br>I don't think that's how the human psyche works.<br>Is he suffers survivors guilt then that's at least one of the reasons that cause his actions and thoughts, including the adaption of Kerry's ideal.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>Did you forget when Ufo animated like a two minute long scene of a guy drooling over a girl? They can do creepy rapey shit if that's what gets you off.</br>  <br>Shirou in HF was more heroic than UBW Shirou.</br>  <br>Saber = Best Girl all day</br>  <br> UBW Shirou <br>Saved the city without murdering anyone<br> HF Shirou <br>Couldn't even get by without killing himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on what you consider heroic</br>  <br> thinks HF is next <br><br>You clearly didn't bother to watch epilogue which was setting up Fate H/A <br><br>they aren't doing HF, get over it. H/A is next on the docket.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's not really a good example of a normal human psyche.<br><br>When Archer's about to pull the reveal, Shirou thinks that he must not realize it or "his foundation will crumble" and that it's why he's distorted.</br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br> they aren't doing HF <br>Do you live under a rock?</br></br>  <br>Only if you're using the ancient idea of hero as someone who does great feats.</br>  <br>They're actually doing a full length necoarc movie staring Sakura as the main heroine instead of Heaven's Feel.</br>  <br> no new HF trailer <br> my copy of volume 1 still hasn't arrived <br>Decided to read HF again. Currently on day 8. It's raining so I'm in a good mood.</br></br></br>  <br>Sensei pls.</br>    <br><br>Thug Life &gt; Daddy Issues &gt; Dragon Dick &gt; Gay Wayne &gt; King "Not-a-Crossdresser" Arthur &gt; Whore of Babylon &gt; Welsh Dickgirl</br></br>  <br> not liking the guy who chooses the most important girl in his live over an impossible sense of justice. </br>  <br>I don't know whether to be terrified or aroused<br>So I choose to be both</br></br>  <br>You have your arrows backwards, but okay</br>  <br>No one can top my king</br>  <br>Do you have the windows open, are you wrapped in a blanket, and do you have all lights and appliances that make noise turned off for a maximum comfy reading experience?</br>  <br>Nasu isn't trying to write something realistic.</br>    <br>No bully.

Nothing unusually good or likable about that.</br>  <br>It's because Rin is somehow even more shit than Sakura</br>  <br>Why do I want that female Hassan so badly? I want that female Hassan to hold me down, ride me and make me unravel my sweaty turban inside her desert oasis.</br>  <br>Who would even want to be friends with the worst Japanese in the world, a woman completely empty of any natural kindness?</br>  <br>All check, auto read, and wrapped like a burrito</br>  I have seen Fate/Zero and the UBW, should see the older fate stay night, and should I play the visual novels?  <br>Hassan confirmed for ISIS</br>  <br> liking the guy who refuses to kill the anti-christ to prevent the apocalypse </br>  <br>The anime just ended, that's the perfect time to read the VN again.</br>  <br>But everyone loves kotomine?</br>  <br>Deen adaptation is the best</br>  <br> she will commit crimes she does not want to commit. <br>I understand this feeling</br></br>  Just got to the first H scene, and it seems that the voices are muted. Did anyone else have this problem?  <br>You might want to go back and watch the DEEN movie just realize how good Ufotable handled things.</br>  <br>That's because the voices were only added in the RN version, which did not have H-scenes.</br>  <br> melt a perfectly good onii-chan's brain with comically lethal poison <br> anon says she dindu nuthin bad </br></br>  <br> should see the older fate stay night <br>Yes, it's the definitive version<br>  and should I play the visual novels? <br>No, they're dated porn games. The adaptations are what really cleaned up the source and made the franchise what it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a problem, the original H-scenes just aren't voiced because the patch adds the RN voiced version which doesn't have H-scenes.</br>  <br>Voices are from the non-adult RN version of the game. They aren't voiced at all.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> It's raining so I'm in a good mood. <br>Reading the rain scene while it's raining.

Fucking Britain.</br></br>  <br>But he refuses to kill the anti-christ to prevent the apocalypse and that guy was talking about "how could you like the guy who refuses to kill the anti-christ".<br>Kotomine is a pretty great guy though. He goes almost 10-15 years of denying sadistic urges, right? That has to count for something.</br></br>  <br>Kotomine is a shit waifu</br>  <br>She's fine<br><br>Germany</br></br></br>  get some tea and have a comfy read  <br>You got shit taste</br>  <br>She survives and dies about a decade later. Also something about being fatally ill and needing to win the Grailbowl to cure herself. On the other hand, she got to bro up with Cu for a bit, even though she gimped him from using Gay Bulge because it wouldn't be fair. And there's surprisingly a decent amount of fan art with the two of them together.</br>    <br> you can't be a servant because faglord isn't a class <br>Every time.</br></br>  I think we should be looking at the bigger picture here HF mean Claudia and  Milf Sakura   <br>She looks a lot like Rin from the epilogue. It's the ponytail, I think. Speaking of, I'm glad Rin finally got rid of the pigtails. That hairstyle is just an atrocity.</br>  <br>You made my day anon</br>  <br> gimped him from using Gay Bulge <br><br>What is with Cu and getting blue balled anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>She's Rin.

No need for romance, just having fun (like maybe Cri-cri make fun of Crow's height, the older/more mature members like Darudayu, Rom, Syuzo, and Chuchu drinking together or something) is enough. I guess they want to play it safe.

Are you implying it's so big it can be seen plainly even through those absurdly baggy pants of his?</br>  What do you think of the dub?<br><br>I was almost on board until I heard Retoree. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w18<wbr>QPtZZn5s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably also voted for her cousin Pompompurin-sama.</br>  <br>Just no.</br>  <br>I think it's amazing that there are people on /a/ who still pay any attention to dubs.</br>  <br>さあ。。。</br>  <br>We went through a period where nobody bought local releases so nobody had any awareness, but now they show up on Nyaa as stream rips and people are peering in again.</br>  <br>Huh. Retoree's going to take some getting used to. Same with Vic.</br>  <br>None of it needs to take any getting used to. You don't have to watch it.</br>  <br>Too late. I've been meaning to check it out for a while. I like to see the similarities and differences.</br>  <br>This show really could have benefited from a second cour for a better pace. <br><br>At least one more monster battle, some BRR-financial problems, perhaps Moa's species sending in additional investigators and causing trouble because they're unaccustomed in how to behave without suspicion, those things would have been nice. <br><br>Oh well, at least we got supersexy spy Angelica.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari knows.<br>Tsugi  grows. </br></br>    <br>So far, I'm more disappointed in Monica Rial's performance of Moa. A Moa without some pyuru mentioned at the end of almost every sentence just feels too weird, and she just doesn't seem to get them right enough. <br><br>But I'm currently also not so interested in watching the dub right now, since other shows are airing and worth watching, and focusing right now again on Show By Rock!! weekly after weekly just to compare the dub to the original will probably rather lead to some burn-out. <br><br>If I'm going to watch SB69 dubbed, it will be after some months in a marathon-session.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those eye-twinkles in MariMari's eyes really make it look extra-lewd.</br>  <br>She will do anything to protect that  巨根ショタ。 </br>  <br>That makes sense, and is kind of why I'm neglecting it too. I'm still not over the ending, myself.</br>  Just saw the poll results.

Vic is too old. Chuchu in later episodes gets all texan. The fucking school club always wanting to go to MidiCity has a very annoying southern drawl to them. Criticrista sounds like stereotypical college girls.

You truly mattered.</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/LiCORudA06Q?t=10m1<wbr>2s</wbr>  [ ] its pitched down due to copyright but you can still here what they did with their dub voices.  <br>Christ why do people in these threads care so much about the dub at all? Am I in bizzaro /a/?</br>  <br> Competition for the game <br><br>Laughing at Vic trying to deny his gayest role yet can be amusing</br></br></br>  <br>Fucked if I know. It's baffling to come in these threads and see multiple people discussing the dub as if it matters in any way.</br>  <br>This is what I'm wondering. Anyone who isn't a complete newfag knows most dubs are shit.<br>I don't see how someone can watch a minute or two on YT (after watching the original) and think it's remotely acceptable.</br></br>  <br>How did they manage to fuck up Jacklyn that badly?<br><br><br><br> We're running out of things to talk about. </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Christ is he already at it, or is this just in anticipation?<br><br>inb4 stop it you guys, Shuzo is a nice, Christian boy</br></br></br>  <br> Chuchu in later episodes gets all texan. <br>I don't get why. Even in episode one she had a unique speech pattern. Did she have some kind of regional thing in the moon version that I couldn't tell?</br></br>  How are the songs in the dub? I've only seen Shingan's entry at the end of episode 1  <br>The songs aren't dubbed except for those mini ones like the one you mentioned</br>  <br> Retroree-purin exposing her asshole </br>  <br>Chris Sabat could have done a more handsome, less Kuwabara voice for Rom.</br>  S2 when?  <br>Probably never. They wrapped up the one season too nicely.  ;_; </br>  <br>They didn't wrap up that much but they'd have to explain the ending if they wanted to continue from it.</br>     Perfect ending <br> Ruin it in the last 2 minutes <br><br>But WHY</br></br></br>  <br>You misunderstand me. I mean, "Congratulations, Tsurezurenaru Ayatsuri Mugenan, you beat Yoshikitty! What the hell is that thing doing placed so high in the first place?"<br><br>Tsurezures are life.</br></br></br>  <br>If that scene hadn't been there, there wouldn't have been any closure. Go fuck yourself.</br>  <br>It was an awfully shit way to end the series.<br><br>Everything ended perfectly then they had to ruin it with cyan suddenly going back to her world without explanation or anything just to join the music club in her original world for no reason at all.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree that I really don't like that Cyan had to go back to the dumb 3D world. She even said herself that she wanted to stay.  It's not fair. </br>  <br>Please don't tell me Rom's voice sounds noticeable similar to the VA's work as Kuwabara.  ;_; </br>  <br>Yeah it is pretty stupid, she even says she cant leave everyone behind just like that and returns to her friends.<br>Why would she suddenly go "Oh im going to abandon you guys because I REALLY want to go play with those girls I have never met before in my original world" when she's happy making songs and playing them with her friends at plasmagica?<br>There was nothing forcing her to go back or anything either.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.  I'm also just really butthurt about what it did to OTP. </br>  <br>But they meet again on the other side so it's okay.</br>  <br>Soon, Shinganz doing chuuni things.</br>  <br>A-And a Cyan clone was left behind in MIDI City too. Everything will be daijoubu.<br><br>R-Right?</br></br></br>  <br> He thinks everything will be daijobu <br>It's over. Plastimagica is finished</br></br>  <br>Should be any day now.</br>  <br> purazzumajica now has no way of living up to the reputation that cyan gave them <br> stress and infighting causes the band to splinter <br> it's all cyan's fault </br></br></br>  <br> Cyan went back <br> Moa went back <br> Retoree and ChuChu both released a single <br><br>And I'm not even making this up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fucking school club always wanting to go to MidiCity has a very annoying southern drawl to them. <br>Should have given them Yorkshire accents.<br><br><br> during Cyan's time in Sound World her game counterpart was going to school in her place <br> her counterpart had better gym grades on account of being half cat </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mentor figure King for S2 please.</br>  <br><br>It sucks too. Right when the band finally got big, they all split up</br></br>  <br><br>Do halfcats go into heat?<br><br>I hope Cyan's real world reputation is okay...</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're telling me is that Plasmagica = Nirvana. RIP Cyan. <br><br><br>Elvis didn't die. He just discovered Sound World.</br></br></br></br>  Cyan gave me diabetes.  <br><br>Cyan came from the Heavens. And she returned to the Heavens in a beam of light. It's like, poetry. <br><br>That's groovy.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Then I apologize.

I wonder how much ShuuzoRom interaction there'll be this time!</br>  <br>I can't wait for the Cyan and Retoree kissu scene that was in the preview!</br>  <br>Will they finally tie up the sexual tension that that last scene caused between these two?</br>    <br>Burn it all.</br>  <br>Just like Sanrio to cut away just before the lesbian confession and affectionate kissu scene.<br><br><br> tfw Cyan takes the lead and mounts Retoree in a tearful, emotional confession. <br>Retoree might actually explode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know if those two are going to have the sweetest love making session or the most brutal ass rape because of how much Retoree is obsessed with every inch of Cyan's body.</br></br>  <br>The sweetest ass rape</br>  <br>Being cuddled while in cute myumon-form would probably be fine too.</br>    So  how goes the event?   <br>I wonder what Cyan's breath smells like.</br>  <br> point:10k<br>score:15k</br> <br>Fuck boss events, too lazy for that shit</br></br>  Anyone order the BDs?<br><br> I really wanted to but I keep myself limited to those with English subtitles, which only Sunrise shows consistently have. </br></br>  <br>I'll also wait for BDs with English subtitles.

There are Stands in Part 7 that don't originate from Corpse parts if I remember right. I don't think In A Silent Way or Tomb of the Boom came from Sandman or the Boomboom Family having a Corpse piece, so maybe enough exposure to either pieces or Devil Palms enable the use of Stands without them.</br>  <br> Killer Queen <br> The Spin in general <br> Bohemian Rhapsody can probably do something similar <br> Diver Down <br> No idea <br> Yellow Temperance? <br> No idea <br> Atum? <br> Atum as well? <br> Rockmen? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why no other part did this?<br><br>Feels less complete.</br></br></br>  <br> and "I win" <br> loses against diego </br></br>  So I've been reading the manga because I finally thought that I should see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>I've started part 5. <br><br>My question is, does the plot ever get better than "let's fight a bunch of one-time stands, learn every infinitesimal detail about how they work, and then never see them again (because we killed or otherwise incapacitated the user so they're no longer relevant)"? I liked parts 1 and 2 a lot, but starting at part 3 and the introduction of Stands I started to feel this way. <br><br> Also, I'd just like to say that while I enjoyed him, I feel like Dio's popularity is way overblown compared to his actual screentime, especially Part 3 Dio. The last part/final fight of Part 3 was very anticlimactic.  <br><br>I think I might watch the anime, maybe seeing things animated and in color would make me more hype about things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missing ones were Spice Girl and the Pillarmen.<br>Oh and mind read could be Hermit Purple as well</br></br>  So if Dio decides to masturbate, does he end up jerking off or does he end up giving Johnathan a handjob?  <br>If you can't get used to the one-off stands, you probably won't enjoy the rest of the series.</br>  <br>its just jonathan jerking off with dio watching</br>  Post your favorite pose  <br>It's not so much the fact that they're one-off stands, really, so much as the fact that the comic spends so much time going into detail about the exact way their powers work. Literally pages and multile chapters dedicated to it. Hell, half the time the user is the one monologuing that shit directly to whoever they're fighting.<br><br>It's really like that the rest of the comic? Maybe I should quit, I dunno. The Italian gangster stuff in Part 5 has been sort of interesting so far, I'll probably at least finish off Part 5 I guess.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes, it's more or less the same flair.<br>Stand fights are more or less puzzle fights. They each have their own rules that need to be explained as their powers become more and more abstract. Part 6 has a lot of abstract stands.</br></br>  <br>It's a fighting manga. The whole point is to create situations that the protagonists struggle to resolve by brain and brawn. In a lot of ways Jojo is entirely responsible for the modern shonen "overcome all odds with my friends" genre. I can see why it'd become dull, the writing has never really been it's strong suit. I like it for the art.</br>  <br>part 5 also has an ass translation for a majority of it (thankfully the pace of the re-translation is picking up). Like, if duwang was bad because the translators didn't have the best grasp on english, the old part 5 translation is bad because the translators don't have the best grasp on japanese</br>    <br>It's been 100 years, the body is DIO's now.</br>  <br>The art is definitely part of what keeps me reading. The art in Part 4 started to get a bit more "generic" in my opinion, and I suddenly realized in part 5 that no one can do anything without posing like they're on a fashion magazine cover, but it's still beautiful to look at (weird hair and clothing aside). <br><br><br>Part 4 was absolute hell for me to get through because of that. Even besides the Duwang shit, I recognized two absolutely unnecessary references to Homestuck in the translation that made me pissed because if you throw in shit like that, how am I supposed to be able to trust your translation at all?<br><br><br>The fact that that body can produce a Joestar would indicate otherwise to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck?</br>  ITT: We post JoJo songs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e0q<wbr>3lby5bDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Wait, what were the homestuck references?

Doffy Nico for your heart!  Anyone else want God Usopp's bounty to go up by an unprecedented amount? Maybe from $30 million to $300 million? It might happening when hundreds of former pirates and other ne'er-do-wells leave Dressorsa spreading word of how Usopp broke the Hobby curse and how they revere him as a messiah.<br><br>Not to mention having Usopp's bounty the 2nd highest in the crew is like poetry.</br></br>  <br>Usopp is the best crewmember, so yes</br>  <br>He lost so quickly it's unreasonable or should I say unbelievable. When I was reading the chapter there was no sense of "OMFG!" it was just an "eh? Oh Doffy's lost oh well" I'm not even hype for the future arcs after this bullshit. This really is a poor man's alabasta arc.<br><br>I wish Oda stopped dickriding the chapters. had he just fused the final chapters together it wouldn't have been so bad. Oda's losing his fucking edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, 100m is the most likely. I think Usopp might be getting Luffy's previous bounties. Completely baseless, yea, but hey.</br>  Aokiji was haki stabbed by Shirohige, Akainu was haki sliced by Marco and Vista, Crocodile was (haki?) decapitated by Doflamingo.<br>How come they survived that? Can haki users with logia powers block haki attacks or something?</br>  <br>They changed shape so the attack didn't hit them. Crocodile was clearly not Haki decapitated. Aokiji literally does this like the next page after he gets stabbed.</br>  What powers will kaido have?<br><br>I'm betting on one of the following<br><br> Typhon Mystical Zoan <br> Hydra Mystical Zoan <br> Sabre tooth tiger Zoan <br> Blood Logia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A plain ol' Lion Zoan. King of the Beasts, motherfucker. Enies Lobby 2.0 with Chopper Rescue Plot incoming.</br>  <br>Quickly? Lmfao.<br><br>I was honestly getting bored with this prolonged arc. A one on one fight should in my opinion not take several weeks.<br><br>Not that realism and manga go hand in hand, but a one on one fight where both opponents are like fucking gods and it just never ends are really boring.<br><br>I think the reason series like Naruto and Bleach always turn to shit in the end is just that. The ridiculous power ups they always get. Shit becomes really boring when that last drop of realism gets thrown out the window.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then why don't they do that all the time when they get injured? Aokiji lost a leg for fuck's sake.<br><br>If they can just change shape to evade the haki attack, then what's the point of haki attacks? They were brought up especially so that a normal human being could defeat logia users.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because they can't ? They fought for 10 fucking days, dude. Both of them were heavily injured. You think Aokiji is going to be on tip top shape on Day 9th when Akainu was throwing a fucking Magma rock at him ? Hell no. The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel''</br>  <br>God Mystical Zoan. Or devil.<br><br>Probably not, it will be some generic albeit strong animal. But I want Oda to go all out here.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel'' <br>That was literally what it was brought up for in the first place though. And anyway, the fact remains that a haki user can hit logia users, and that rule simply did not seem to apply when Aokiji got stabbed.</br></br>  If Doflamingo could make clones of himself, why didn't he get more outlandish and just copied himself exactly to the detail? Why not go full Bayonetta and create some weird string beasts?  <br>Because Aokiji didn't get hit. It's that simple. The attack simply didn't hit him. You could say he just dodged. It's not that hard to understand. And iirc, CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia.</br>  Does anyone know what kind of island Zou is? Sounds like it would be related to wano/Kano  <br>Haki showed up in the literal first chapter.</br>  <br>Probably because it would be very weird. And Doffy could probably only make some Flamingo's which would have made Luffy lose his shit.</br>  <br>Hmm, in that case I find it weird that Aokiji looked so shocked when being stabbed.<br>Also, Rayleigh could stop Kizaru with a strike of his sword, wouldn't Kizaru possibly be able to dodge it the same way?<br>Then again he did not get hurt by that. Also, Marco sent him flying with a kick, so Kizaru probably just isn't that good at dodging things? Or does not care because he is Kizaru.<br><br> CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia. <br>Same difference. It circumvented a devil fruit power to hit the user.<br><br><br>But it was not adressed by name and described expositionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People speculate that it is the Korea to Kano's Japan.</br>  <br>King of Beasts fruit.</br>  <br>Big Dick 90inch Mystical Zoan, I'm calling it right now.</br>  <br>Remember when people thought Akainu had blood logia? good times</br>  <br>LMFAO</br>  <br>Black person zoan. Luffy will have to play basketball against him for the title of Yonko. When Kaido reveals his awakened zoan he turns into Shaqaido o'Neal and is like 20 feet tall. To keep up, Luffy will perform a full body gear 3, and also get back his afro power from the Foxy boxing fight.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl<wbr>wOe6WKz4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Aokiji just looks serious. Not shocked whatsoever. Kizaru is a lazy shit and you know it. And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. And Rayleigh kept up with a fucking Light dude. That could be also a clue. <br><br>And it still hits Devil Fruit users. You just have to not be a scrub. Which Luffy won't be when he fights Akainu.</br></br></br></br></br>  quote me on this one<br><br>its going to be a monkey zoan</br></br>  <br>quoted <br><br>ayyyyoooo lmaoooo</br></br></br>  <br>Mythical King Kong Zoan who gets taken out by Luffy's Gear 5 "King Kong Jet Pistole Pasta Machine"</br>  <br>kek'd</br>  <br>I can see this happening in Gintama very soon.</br>  <br>I think he looked shocked, but fair point. It just seems like a minor inconsistency to me, but I can write it off as "haki raises your chances against logia types" rather than seeing as like "haki always beats logia".<br><br> And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. <br>Well, he's been a marine for the same amount of time and was known as a "monster" back then aswell. So I just jumped to that conclusion.<br><br>Also, I find it kinda sad that we probably won't ever have a marine as strong as the red-yellow-blue admirals with Shengoku on top. Fujitora apparently is much weaker than the other admirals (though obviously he has still time to prove himself) and I don't have really high hopes for green bull (will he maybe be a zoan user? we don't really have any zoan marines other than The Buddha).<br>It feels like Luffy will never defeat the marines at the zenit of their power, even if he beats Akainu at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do you best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>We don't even know if they both had fruits back then. And if we're going by the movie info, Zephyr says that Kizaru relies on his fruit too much so we can assume that he is a cocky prick that won't think about dodging that much. And Rokugyu and Fujitora has been called ''Monsters'' too.</br>  <br>But Fujitora seems so much weaker than the previous admirals. It would seem unreasonable that the marines could simply replace their strongest forces that were intact for the decades without a drop in power - though obviously possible.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  Damn, I keep forgetting how few logia users there actually are. Seems like so many more because Smoker was introduced early, but many that seem to be logias from memory are just logiaesk paramecias, like Mr. 3, Jozu or Magellan.<br>It feels like thee are more characters that have conqueror's haki than logia powers (though that obviously is not true.)</br>  <br>An actual high bounty's capabilities horrified Usopp. He's not there yet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=egJ<wbr>_tcZC0Ek</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I wouldn't bet against Oda just yet, we've seen the extend of the Marines but not of the World Government. <br><br>We know for sure a new generation of Pacifista is coming, no clue what Vegapunk is up to, CP0 has been on the sidelines. World draft brought in Admiral-level candidates, who knows what else they drafted.

Plenty of nations could fight on the side of the WG, they might even posses an ancient weapon.

Still one of my favorite characters</br>  <br>kizaru is known to rely too much on his df power; atleast it was mentioned directly in war z whether you want to take that as canon or not</br>  <br>its a weird logia since he cant do that, alternately it makes his body weaker; so its easier just to think of it as a paramecia (unless he can turn into darkness in complete darkness like say under a cloak</br>  Coby has conquerors as well, He showed it at the end of marineford    <br>Ace used it at Grey Terminal yah, lets get real Roger definitely had it. Lets get it out of the way btw, YES only 1 in a million people have CoC, yea that rare. There where over 10 million people in Alabasta alone, that's 10 users right there. Why wouldn''t people with the ability be attracted to the big show in the New World?<br><br><br>Oh God my dream the Mizu Mizu. I want a villan to have a subordinate have it. He's a great fighter we think doesn't have a fruit because he's ashamed of it. It can only be used once, he soaks a fruit user and for that split second someone else gets a free hit on them and the Mizu user immediately is foam at the mouth mode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they may not know they have it</br>  <br>mind telling us exactly when he showed it?</br>  Would be covered in Snow or Ice cause a DF user to lose their power?  <br>Nope, only ocean water counts, I think?</br>  <br> Nope, only ocean water counts, I think? <br><br> O: First of all, let's discuss the problem of Devil Fruit users bathing themselves. People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are "hated" by the sea, and cannot swim. The "sea" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the "sea." When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the "sea." With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier. Also, rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore, hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now, in Crocodile's case, "water" is the weakness of his very powers, so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But it's not like there are enemies around when you take a shower, so I'd bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Don't you think? ---And to answer your final question, about myself bathing. As it happens, I do bathe. Twice! In a year! </br></br></br>  <br>You could easily rape crocodile while he's taking a shower</br>  <br>So let me get this straight. So if you want your kid to be strong, determined, and successful, all you have to do is make his middle initial D? Why isn't everyone a D then?</br>  <br>it is not the name, it is the bloodline</br>  <br>Because not everyone believes in that superstition.</br>  &lt;- who knew?  <br>If I ever have a kid his middle name will be D</br>  <br> opmemes.com </br>  <br> Shotamingo has an adorable girl voice <br><br>Nice<br>Now why couldn't they do that with Law?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou is Kaku with his awakened Giraffe Zoan, which turns him into a Kirin. <br><br>On a more serious note, I'm expecting one of the following<br><br> Mystical/Ancient Zoan <br> Godzilla Zoan <br> Lion Zoan <br> Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br> Paramecia that lets him summon animals rather than become them <br> Something that lets him turn into any animal and mix and match them (Something like Ultimate Kars) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffin Zoan</br>  <br>You're not serious right?

Why is Yukino such a psycho?  <br>Fuck off</br>  This show used to be funny.

I don't know if volume 11 has been scanned yet but earlier volumes will do too.  <br>I think "autistic" is the term you're looking for.</br>  Wait a fucking minute, where is the scene where Yukino gives 8man the max coffee and Yui has her trigger face?  <br>She wants the 8 so fucking bad now.</br>  <br><br>No that scene did not have an illustration.</br></br>  <br>Yes, more than a week ago. I'm not sure why you're so late to the party.</br>  <br><br>So what was this line about? My initial thought was that Haruno could obviously tell that Yukino was repeated verbatim what Hachiman told her, so she told Yukino to give Hachiman the phone so she could respond to what Yukino said since it was basically Hachiman who really said it.</br></br>  <br>Hey even girls like her need some happiness.<br><br><br>That was in ep11 but Yui was just smiling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your initial thought is correct.</br>  <br><br>She has had almost no appearance since her arc.<br><br>Has there been another character who has disappeared so utterly?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the one you're talking about?<br><br>Because this was from the episode they crammed 90% of volume 10 into.</br></br></br>    Season 3 when?

But then you have to question what honest means. Saying what you believe is true.<br><br>Now you have to ask what it means to believe something is true. Well if you're saying it to someone without a clear purpose then you're most likely only saying it because you have doubts in it and as a result you need to affirm those beliefs by voicing them to others. The problem is if you truly believed in the words you were voicing from the start then why would you ever voice them?<br><br>The more you try to break things down to their base components and get a very clear cut definition of "something genuine" the further and further you seem to get away from it.<br><br><br>In the end "genuine" is an irrational concept and so people who seek order and definition will greatly struggle with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Yui trying to get in their way of happiness? <br><br>WHY WON'T SHE FUCK OFF?<br><br>YUIFAGS KILL YOURSELVES</br></br></br></br>  <br>Update yourself, she affected reality that day.</br>  <br>fuck off falseflagger</br>  <br>You can tell its Yukino based on the syntax used;</br>  <br><br>That sounds good.

It's a means of making shortcuts in your head to skip past doubt and fear and go straight to what you truly want. It's about achieving harmony between logic and emotion. For those intellectually inclined it might seem like emotion only clouds judgement and thus it may seem right to deny or suppress them.<br><br>The problem is that they are an integral part of human nature and no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase them. Still though, from every logical perspective you could take it never seems right to accept something irrational like emotion and use it to make better decisions.<br><br>Overcoming that mental boundary and moving forward is a process that cannot be described, only known.
