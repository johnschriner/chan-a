[ Be honest, how many series have you actually watched?  <br>i dont watch anime</br>  <br>About 50 shows and most of them are/were popular ones. I don't watch bullshit like No No Buuri or whatever it is called.</br>  About 30.  Honestly  I don't count since I'm not a MAL faggot   <br>I don't count them but probably over 400 series.</br>  104 TV series according to MAL<br>Browsing /a/ since end 2013</br>  117 to competion. Not watched Eva or out of all that tho,,...seems overrated,  I've watching Anime since the 90's. How I am supposed to count all that I watched?<br>Frankly, the only people that keep a count on all the Anime they watched are MALfaggots that started watching Anime 5 years ago tops.</br>  TV: 65, OVA: 3, Movies: 25, Spcl.: 3, Eps: 1,846, Days: 31.87  229 actually.  29 in 6 years.<br><br>Get a job you fucking turbonerds</br></br>  9.5 shows and End of Evangelion  <br>Only around 500 entries on MAL, but that's an inflated number. Around 5000 episodes in total, since at least a hundred of those entries are OVAs, shorts and specials.<br><br>But in my defense, I only started watching anime less than two years ago when KlK started airing and /a/nons spammed about this cool new anime saving the anime industry all over the site and piqued my interest in the medium.</br></br></br>  over 300  Summer hurts.  I don't know, but my penis is probably marginally above average size, all things considered.  Probably around 60, more if I count the countless shows I've seen on tv as a kid.  <br>Around 600+, including OVAs, ONAs, Specials, Movies.</br>  <br>MAL says 271<br>I stopped using that site 3 years ago.<br>Only God knows how many days of my life were wasted to this Chinese scourge.</br></br></br>  <br>I never counted</br>  All these peasants, I have watched over 510 series, not counting ovas, movies or specials.  <br>Agree</br>  I've probably about 30 anime series. However, I've read over 500 manga series.  <br>This is 341 episodes btw</br>  <br>I have honestly lost track.</br>  About 20 anime, still more than average though.  Stopped counting when I got to 1100+ that was around 3 years ago  Blogging isn't anime now fuck off  TV: 322, OVA: 57, Movies: 105, Spcl.: 64, Eps: 7,321, DL Eps: 618, Days: 125.38<br><br>I've only been browsing /a/ since 2014 though</br></br>  <br>Since I didn't know that OVAs and second seasons count as another seriess I would say around 270.</br>  <br>Indeed. All this kids</br>  <br>No one is blogging, you upset? Did someone break your heart?</br>  <br>I watch about 60-70 shows a year and have been at that rate for 5 years +20ish from before then. So 350 for an approximation but I've never actually counted.</br>  I've watched roughly about 60-70.<br><br>I still post in threads about anime I haven't watched though. I can get away with it easily.</br></br>  <br> Look, just buy my game before things get out of hand. </br>  <br>I just finished my 171st TV series. I've also seen 98 movies, 36 OVAs, and 56 specials.</br>  Around 50 or so.  Stopped counting in 2013<br>Back then it was nearly 300 so I presume its close to 500 now</br>  <br><br><br><br>Get the fuck out of here</br></br></br></br>  <br> I still post in threads about anime I haven't watched though. I can get away with it ea <br>I barely watch anime, just skim through it, but I still post in nearly every thread up. It's pretty easy, you just have to copy what someone else says and change it around. I can't remember the last time I actually sat down without facebook or 4chan open and finished an entire show.</br></br>  A bit more than 200 shows. No one cares about how much anime you've watched unless you're retarded.  No idea.  <br>Yeah, no one care who I was until I watched anime.</br>  Not sure, but around 300 to 400 in 7 years. Started reading manga earlier so probably that ranges in a few thousands.  <br>Nope... nobody cares about you still.</br>  <br> facebook <br><br>Get the fuck out, normalfag.</br></br></br>  TV: 356, OVA: 55, Movies: 110, Spcl.: 65, Eps: 9,824<br><br>Stay NEET kids.</br></br>  fucking MAL niggers  <br><br>Exactly 949 .</br></br>  Watching anime is not a competition.  According to my  MAL : 649.  240<br><br>I see I have to no life it if I want to get to 1000 before I die.</br></br>  Around 400 titles probably, but I haven't been keeping track after 250 or so.  <br>who said it was, dipshit?</br>  <br><br>It is.</br></br>  <br>Don't bother. I'd reckon that most posters on /a/ are actually like that. Heck, judging by the quality of most airing threads and all criticism being the result of a clear lack of attention reinforces my beliefs.</br>  How many anime even are there really?  <br>This.Do you actually like anime? Do you even /a/?</br>  <br>Damn<br>TV: 217, OVA: 24, Movies: 75, Spcl.: 29, Eps: 7373</br></br>  I'm probably somewhere between 10 and 20.<br><br>I've had a pretty uneventful summer.</br></br>  Only 180, I'm getting way slower with watching than I used to be.  <br>According to MAL nearly 200</br>  <br>More than you can ever see<br>Last time I checked they were 15k+,but they are probably far more.</br></br>  TV: 278, OVA: 79, Movies: 85, Spcl.: 58,   This hole thread <br> that other "anon" who uses facebook <br> some have watched less than 200 series. <br>Oh, and to that anon who said 20 is still more than average, the only sample worthy is that from /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Stopped counting after 150 or so, it doesn't really matter how many series you've watched since you just need to watch enough to keep up with discussion in /a/.</br>  Only 311 but it's getting tiresome to watch or pick anything new up.  <br>No wonder so much shit taste on the airing shows threads.</br>  <br> le /v/ meme <br><br>Get out, retard.</br></br></br>  TV: 453, OVA: 181, Movies: 173, Spcl.: 67, Eps: 15,446<br><br>901 entries total.<br><br>Also, dropped (at 4+ episodes):<br><br>TV: 158, OVA: 11, Movies: 1, Spcl.: 0,</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I never counted them and everything new is getting shittier and shittier. Probably around 300-400.  <br> &gt;le </br>  <br>i'm not counting, yet i recall watching captain future when i was around 8 and downloading 30MB sized rm-files of slayers in 40x30pixels sometimes around 1997</br>  <br> counting </br>  ITT : MAL disguised thread  <br>Make me, shithead.</br>  <br>who's that dude watching them all in alphabetical order?</br>  I think I'm in the 250-300 range. Good chance I broke 300.<br>Has anyone ever broken 1k yet?</br>    <br>If by watched, you mean finished, then probably around a meager 50. I have a handful that I watched most of and have 250something in my backlog, then add the summer animes I'm watching.</br>  <br>10 or 15  episodes </br>  <br> going anywhere near the probability theory </br>    <br>This is what happens when you shitpost more on /a/ than watch anime, sasuga tripfag.</br>  <br>I started using MAL 8 years ago though.</br>  <br>I used Google docs recently to make a list of my backlog and watched anime. So not everyone uses MAL. Its a good idea to keep track so you could recommend anime to friends or casuals who want to try anime.</br>   TV: 173, OVA: 30, Movies: 29, Spcl.: 38, Eps: 3,183, Days: 49.45 <br>And I've been here since Winter 2013.<br>I'm such a fucking casual.</br></br>  At one point I nearly filled a whole 3TB drive with my backlog and 500Gbs with currently airing/more recent shows. Culled them and just now are getting close to being full again...  400ish, I once had a mal but it was a pain to update.  How many breads have you eaten in your life?    about 300, including movies but not series related ovas and shorts.

With the biggest crisis of his life being summoned to another world and no sign of the one who summoned him, things become worse when he is attacked. But when he is saved by a mysterious silver-haired girl with a fairy cat, Subaru cooperates with the girl to return the favor. When they finally manage to get a clue, Subaru and the girl are attacked and killed by someone. Subaru then awakens in the place he was summoned and notices he gained the ability "Returns by Death." A helpless boy that only has the ability to rewind time by dying. And beyond the despair can he save the girl from the fate of death?</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Both sides once she'd warmed up to you. She'd make a damn good wife if she existed.</br>  <br>There's also the fish-out-of-water concept to show off the alien nature of the world which is also used as a shameless way to "cheat" world building with comparisons to their modern world.</br>  <br>Then name the other anime that had the same setting as .hack before .hack. You can say the SAO author came up with the same idea about the same time at best unless you switch to western stuff like Tron.</br>  <br>Doesn't work for me to be honest. I always found this concept less interesting than a character from that actual timeline. Fuck normal fags, they're boring. I don't want them as MCs.</br>  <br>Monster Rancher is from '98 or '99<br>.Hack is from 2002 with a LN prequel in 2003</br></br>  sakura thread  <br>The worst TM used goods.</br>  <br>just stop already.</br>  I am starting to believe that the Rinfag boogeyman retard is not even a Sakurafag but a fag of another girl having a giggle by starting waifuwars.  <br>Did someone say Powerlevels?</br>  <br>And what exactly did you get from this?<br>That you derailed a Sakura thread just to be a cunt to anons who like her? Fuck you.</br></br>  New episode soon  I don't think she's saying that CR    This show doesn't merit such an awful thread.  <br>CR is slowly but surely turning into poor man's Commie. They even used "friendzone" in this episode.</br>  <br>go watch the op again</br>   go to your kitchen <br> see her <br>what do</br></br>  <br><br>Or better yet don't embarass yourself with shitty 2010-style reaction images</br></br>  <br> basically having tootsuki on your resume gets your foot in the door at a lot of places. being able to make it to a specific year before getting expelled gets you into even higher places. <br><br>A school system that is basically Survival Mode trying to see how far you get.<br><br>Have they heard of "grades"?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ketchup is a good source of umami</br>  <br>But the US Masterchef isn't even very good. The best one is probably AU.</br>  <br>Grades are probably the most bullshit of any metric of evaluating merit ever actually implemented and publicly accepted. Tootsuki's gauntlet is pretty unrealistic too but it's not fucking real. Still better than grades though.</br>  Hey /a/! Can you take care of my NEET for me while I'm away for the week?  Can I put my penis in or around it?

Staggering release of your menu is a good way to drive repeat business and garner interest over the course of something like a festival like this.<br><br>Meanwhile offering the full menu garners more interest day 1 but doesn't particularly spur repeat customers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH your opinion's different from mine! <br><br>alright, then just fuck off and drop the series if you hate the pacing that much</br></br></br>  <br>My opinion is the majority, brah.

You're just trying to be special.</br>  <br> fuck off and drop the series if you don't agree with my opinion </br>   Nossa, nossa <br> Assim você me mata <br> Ai, se eu te pego, <br> Ai, ai, se eu te pego </br></br></br>   Delícia, delícia <br> Assim você me mata <br> Ai, se eu te pego <br> Ai, ai, se eu te pego </br></br></br>  Idol Mami when?  <br>Never thought I'd see a reference to that here.<br><br/></br></br>  Are you ready for Papi's ass, Smith nips and legs and Horse pussy? <br><br>Also about Manga is there any early raws or we need to wait until 19th as always?
