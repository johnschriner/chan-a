Who do I give money to?<br><br>Is the fig on the left a real thing?</br></br></br>  <br> here. On two occasions, I've received Past-Due notifications and then this Order Cancellation notice. I could have sworn I got some angry email but I can't find it. Maybe it was under a different email address.</br>  <br>Fuck man I'm the same way. I hated the show and dropped it EP 3 but a Hestia fig is enticing me. <br> <br>Shes so cute.

How many here gonna order the cutest?  <br>Id rather a cattleya than this obese rat face.</br>  <br>Something about her right hand seems off.<br><br><br>I am. She's adorable.</br></br></br></br>   Amiami sent me the letter that Kotori's been delayed <br>First of many im sure.</br>  <br>Not me</br>  <br><br>Thanks for your opinion.</br></br>  <br>I blame James for spamming her in every thread.</br>  Well, the motorcycle is on the way, but the racing miku figma was delayed.<br><br>Do I unbox the motorcycle by itself, or leave it be until they can be opened together?<br><br>I'm serious, this is an actual dilemma I'm having.</br></br></br></br>  <br>about tree fiddy</br>  Pochacho is the most disgusting piece of shit I have seen in my entire life, it's literally a fat sonico. I hope nitroplus rots in hell for the lack of creativity.  <br>It's only really excusable when there's a super long lead time on an item.<br><br>Ten months can bring a lot of changes in one's life.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna see a fat miku now.</br>  <br>Taking away Abyssal exclusivity has lost them a customer.</br>  <br>I fell in love with Hestias fig that <br>posted, the only reason I sort of regret ordering it is cause I haven't watched it yet. Those titties and belly tight dress thing fuck. My dick and credit card cant handle this!</br></br>  From the thumbnail, I thought the bridge of the glasses was a mouth and it had an uguu face.  Is there a place that does a random selection or blind box (or whatever) for figmashit? I'm trying to get over my gambling addiction and I'd like to find a waifu in the process.  <br> Those titties and belly tight dress thing fuck. <br><br><br>Your grammar and stupid wording made me audibly laugh. 10/10, though not sure if your post was serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at her. Just jeep on looking at her. Wouldn't you like to hold her at night? I would. And i will.</br>  <br>Buying as soon as it's availible tomorrow. So fucking adorable.

How can that work on the flat surface of a hugging pillow?</br>  <br> Dec Release <br><br>How I wish this was true. Seeing as how Re-Class was delayed like 2 months we're looking at a January/February release. By which time putting her with the Santa and Christmas tree will be just dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ please stop I'm this close to buying my first daki.</br>  <br>On just figures? A little under 9.1k USD including shipping, over 4 years. Over 14k USD if doujinshi, BDs, CDs, various books and  localized  manga and LNs are added in.</br>  <br>So the BD comes with official nude art?</br>  <br> KI GA KURUISOUI remember. <br><br>I'm not feeling that figure, though. Unfortunate.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait to  cuddle with her while I watch season 2. </br>  <br><br><br>Does anyone here read japanese? Is that fig real? Are there swimsuits under that film? These are important questions.</br></br></br>  <br> Season 2 </br>  <br>You can spoon with her anon. Get creative with it.</br>  <br>Am I the only one that take down Christmas decoration 1 week before easter?<br> I am actually just lazy </br></br>  <br>Pre-orders for the fig start tomorrow. There's nothing on the nude but I guess there will be a swimsuit and not plain nudity</br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>Which onaho would hestia be? Lolinco?</br>  <br>robot girls z figures when?</br>  <br>what display case is the 3rd one on the bottom left pic?</br>  <br>All it says is you can change their outfits. It doesn't say what's underneath. Most likely underwear.<br><br><br> Pre-orders for the fig start tomorrow. <br>It says 7/25...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK meant for </br>  <br><br>I usually take it down the first week of January.</br></br>  <br>The day after tomorrow. Tomorrow/Today is 24.</br>  <br>Favorite? I don't know. But have, I haven't posted this one yet.</br>  <br>That'd be a safe bet, I'd say.</br>    <br>I want my GSC scale Doublas already!</br>  <br>I usually take 'em down around mid January. A couple years ago I left Halloween decorations up until early December.<br><br><br>I'd like to think that they'd make her a priority now that they've drawn attention to the Christmas accessories. But you're probably right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember. The music was great.</br>  Am I not doing it right, or is figinstock's mandarake search pretty shit? I'm looking for pre-owned alerts for a figure of a character with a generic name, but can't seem to be able to add more than one word without the search shitting itself completely.    <br>It's a display case from an optical practice. They were going out of business so I bought it off of them for 50 bucks.</br>  <br>Be honest<br><br>When I saw the first image of her pop up on Booru I knew I had to get a nendoroid of her as soon as it was made as she is too cute.</br></br></br>  <br>Dang,lucky</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Around 1k, over 1 year. Should calm down this year though.</br>  <br>500 bucks at this point? More on manga over the years maybe. I have a huge collection but a lot of it was through grabbing my friends stuff when they fell out of the phase</br>  <br>then provide a better one</br>    <br>Millia when?</br>    <br> Nice display, nice quality.. oh fuck amiibos <br> Razer Orca headphones <br><br>So from what I can tell you have eyes but you are fucking deaf.</br></br></br></br>  Did they really leave out Ranko and Anya?  <br>All boat nendos look like dickbutts.<br>Especially Re, who was a huge clusterfuck and I didn't like anything about it at all.</br></br>    <br>anytime soon now<br>https://twitter.com/h8nny8/status/5<wbr>64350032585830401</wbr></br></br>  <br>ugly GK</br>  <br>Everybody knows they suck.</br>  <br> leave out Ranko and Anya? <br>What the fuck are they thinking???</br></br>  Is this a bootleg?  <br>Correct! As a reward have a pretty one.</br>  <br>Probably because they didn't show up for the concert</br>   CAD still dropping   <br>unf Shizuka</br>  <br> Probably because they didn't show up for the concert <br>Which concert?</br></br>  <br>Beautiful face but I don't like her bimbo hooker boobs, if only they were smaller.</br>  <br>The 10th anniversary one these things came out of</br>  Just ordered this Goddess. Anyone have her?  <br>shit I didn't know that polypropylene breast implants existed for anime figurines.</br>  <br>Over $15000, oh god.</br>    <br>Ohh, I see</br>  <br>Good. Now get the rest of them.</br>  <br>There are a large amount of images on mfc for you to look at to see for yourself.</br>  <br>But Hibari, Katsuragi, and Yagyuu are shit.<br><br>I'd literally want everone else in the series except those 3.</br></br></br>  <br>I would, but I can't. That pose isn't fitting for her at all. Good figures of them in their Shinobi outfits are too much to ask for.</br>  <br>Who is this figure based on? Looks pretty neat.</br>  <br>yeah but Iâm not totally sure, what do you think?</br>  <br><br>I have it. I love it really. Would like some good poses in the shinobi uniforms though.</br></br>  <br><br>The Phat katsuragi is truly a great figure.</br></br>  <br> Katsuragi <br> Shit <br>Yeah you can fuck off with that opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad her design is shit.</br>  <br>Not sure how that is relevant<br><br>http://idolmaster.jp/event/10th_liv<wbr>e/information.php<br><br>CINDERELLA GIRLS<br><br>å¤§æ©å½©é¦ï¼å³¶æå¯æå½¹ï¼ãç¦åç¶¾é¦ï¼æ¸è°·åå½¹ï¼ãåç´åéï¼æ¬ç°æªå¤®å½¹ï¼ã<wbr><br>éæ¨ç çå­ï¼å¤ç°æè¡£èå½¹ï¼ãäºååµè£ç¾ï¼åèæå½¹ï¼ãå¤§ç©ºç´ç¾ï¼ç·æ¹æºçµµ<wbr>éå½¹ï¼ã<br>é»æ²¢ã¨ããï¼èµ¤åã¿ããå½¹ï¼ãæ´²å´ç¶¾ï¼æ°ç°ç¾æ³¢ï¼ãé«æ£®å¥æ´¥ç¾ï¼åå·ã¿ãå½¹<wbr>ï¼ã<br>æ¾åµéºï¼è«¸æãããå½¹ï¼ãå±±æ¬å¸æï¼åã¶å´èåå½¹ï¼ãä½³æã¯ãã(åã¶å´ç¾<wbr>åå½¹)</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I think he meant to say that Senran Kagura is fucking shit in total; because it is.</br>  <br>She's shit. Based Japan with good taste.</br>  <br>I love katsuragi but almost all her figs are shit.</br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>Looks legit to me. The bootlegs for this one seemed rather sloppy. Where did you get her from?</br>  This is not a GK. Original character made by Q-six.  <br>Jesus fuck. Please provide pics of your collection.</br>  <br> Yumifags <br>Yeah you and Japan sure showed me.</br></br>  Based off of this art. I hope they can pull it off. This might be exciting for the anons who were upset about Lala not having pubic hair.  Anyone have Cu-Poche? I really loved the episode that featured the four torpedoe girls. Plus the tickling of akatsuki's tummy is one of my favorite memes.  <br>from the seller. thanks Iâll check it more carefully. <br><br><br>fuck, even the hikage fig isn't that good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she holding a long turd in her hand</br>  I want to make this piggy squeal.  <br>Who's this</br>  <br>Is that Hibiki nendo out yet?</br>  <br><br>Looks super cute, especially that face, but I'm not terribly thrilled about the pubes. Def won't even consider it if those are actually included.</br></br>  Big spenders, how old are you?  <br>For a while now, yes.</br>  <br> fuck, even the hikage fig isn't that good. <br>Really none of them are. I did get that Hikage by Milestone since she's my favorite and she probably wouldn't get another figure. Turned out alright to me. I also have the Phat Kat. Quality wise the Alter Asuka is the best but fuck that pose.<br><br>Then there's<br> everything else is Griffon <br><br>At least I have my petits.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>turkey-sensei</br>  <br>Do you even know how tits work?<br>When you raise your arms they do that kinda thing</br></br>  <br>18</br>  <br><br>She honestly look like shit, and I'm a Hibiki fag.<br><br>I'll wait for the QuesQ one.</br></br></br></br>  A bunch of amiami merchandise will be available at wonfes and some should be up on their site.<br><br>http://amiamiblog.com/amiamiblog/20<wbr>15/7/22/o98vky7n8xf3df9hmunzuoxg1kj<wbr>m3x</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>What are these called again? Makaizoku? Makaizou?<br>Auctions if I want one right?</br></br></br>    <br>I need these</br>  <br>You said the exact same thing last time this was posted and I remember because I corrected you.</br>  <br>Even though I know that would never happen a chiyo.</br>  I forgot about Winter WF and didn't even realize until I saw twitter hours later.<br><br>I don't even remember what was announced and barely check AmiAmi anymore.<br><br>I think I'm off the slope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only interesting thing is the stands.<br>I'll get both</br></br>  <br>ugly cunts</br>  <br>What is Lilco?<br><br>Amico is amiami as in the name but is Lilco a reference to anything?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> the good quality Senran figures are too lewd <br> the good poses and stuff medium to bad quality <br><br>Why is so hard to those companies make them in good poses?

I'm even thinking in getting her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no multiple thumbs girl </br>  <br> pubes <br>My dicks been waiting.</br></br>  <br>The surgery was a success.</br>  <br>This reminds me of that picture of the creepy uguu girl that always gets posted in QUALITY threads for some reason.</br>  <br> Too lewd. <br><br>Which one?</br></br></br>  <br>Is it just me or does the printing on the eyes seem kind of dull?</br>  <br>I'll glass your ass, m8.</br>  <br>Please let them paint the pubes.</br>  I really wish all the nice mohun garage kits got standard releases.  <br>Every time I see that thumbnail, I keep thinking that best moth girl is getting a scale. Fuck this gay earth ;_;</br>  Flare is making something cool.  <br><br>More like fucking cat hair.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't even know what were you trying to accomplish with you post.</br></br>  do you people jack off to this stuff?  Well, the Australian government thinks we're not paying enough for imported goods despite our garbage exchange rate so now we get to pay GST on them. I've heard some websites will lower the cost of the package so you can dodge this jewery, which ones are they? I know Amiami doesn't but what about others?  <br>I need to find nicer backgrounds around my house.</br>  <br>I like to move some of the lewder ones onto my desk while I fap. <br><br><br>The guide has them marked. Mandarake has had a recent policy change so each store is now different. There were a few posts in the archive about how requests for undervaluing went with each store. Search for individual mandarake store names and it should come up.<br><br><br>I love this photo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope this is painted by this WonFes, it's been a damn year  <br>Certain mandarake stores. Check the archives which. I just transacted with toycoin.sg and they're fine with it but you need to talk to them by email.</br>  <br>Some people will jack off to anything, what a dumb question.</br>  <br> so now we get to pay GST on them. <br>I remember hearing about this when your budget came out but I can't actually find anything about it except about GST on digital goods and services.<br><br>Don't you still have that $1000 limit for parcels?</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/ne<wbr>ws/nsw/gst-deal-state-premiers-agre<wbr>e-to-charge-gst-on-overseas-online-<wbr>shopping-purchases-under-1000/story<wbr>-fni0cx12-1227453472235</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Looks like I'll have to buy preglued from now on. Thanks tone.</br></br>  <br>That's awfully vague. So nothing's actually happened yet?</br>  <br><br><br>I've done it 6 or 7 times already and got this</br></br></br>  <br>I get the urge to but I haven't done it yet. I always feel regret after Cumming to any sort of porn</br>  <br>They've talked about it before but haven't done anything, but it seems like they're serious this time considering what a big conference it was. When it comes in is a different story, might not be for years.</br>  <br>Interesting. I might try my luck for a third time then.</br>  <br> I always feel regret  <br>So did I, when I was fucking 10.<br>How the hell can that persist?</br></br></br>  <br>I have a few and they are cute figures, I understand that some anons don't like them, but then again there are people thatt don't like SD/Chibi proportions</br>  <br>Maybe it's that nagging voice in my head telling me I'm a virgin loser with no friends or family</br>  <br>What happened to your family?</br>  <br>That happens to me but when it's something truly morally questioning. Other than that, no.</br>  <br>Jesus fuckin christ anon</br>    <br>I estimate about $3500, with about $2500 of current preorders.</br>  <br>They're too "skinny" for me. Also hands/feet are too big.</br>  <br>They've already done feasibility studies on it before and found that collecting the tax would cost more money than it would make. That's the entire reason the threshold is there.</br>  <br>this is not the place for that shit go to /jp/ if you plan to blog about that.</br>  Around $500. Not bad.  <br>They have the proportions of a toddler so they are accurate IMO</br>  amiami please give me my invoice already  <br>About $3,000</br>  <br>Satsuki.<br><br>That's not happening though.</br></br></br>  <br>Amicos waifu.</br>  <br>But they are sisters. <br><br><br>Why not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The eyelashes are a bit dull, if that's what you mean. They contrast well with her pale colors and allow her bold red/orange eyes to stand out more.</br>  <br>Sibling love is the purest.</br>  <br>I think it depends on how much you have ordered in the past though, I guess they wouldnt easily ban a good customer</br>  Anyone know how to get items from P-Bandai if I live in Australia?<br><br>They announced a new Digivice on it and I want to actually get it this time.</br></br>  <br>Only when it's oneechan and little brother.</br>  HOW DO I GET AUTOGRAPHS OF DOUJIN ARTISTS? MAINLY YUZUKI N'.  <br>Proxy. P-Bandai don't like gaijin dorra.</br>  Instant pre-order.  <br>ewwww</br>  I think that everyone will want to see this. A huge amount of scales have been announced.

Mikotohaters BTFO.</br>  <br> being happy because Kamachi outright stated Mikoto will never accomplish anything with Touma <br> implying this isn't just more fuel for detractors to shit on her in future novels <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night.</br></br></br>    Best Kihara.  <br>I don't get why it isn't making more people angry and that Kamachi basically confirmed her for never reaching her goal of being with Touma. He literally ripped Misaka apart this volume and then said she's nothing but fodder now. How can't people see that?</br>  <br>Nice try, but that's not what the author said.<br><br> Also, Misaka Mikoto was an important part of this story. <br><br> Sheâs been with us since the very first volume, a lot of information has been presented along the way, and she has accumulated a number of emotions. Sometimes she is becoming aware of her romantic feelings, sometimes she is feeling the shock of being pushed away, and in New Testament 10, she gave Kamijou a pat on the back to see him on his way. But âright nowâ, what is she thinking, what is she worrying about, and what is she trying to overcome? My answer to that is Misaka Mikotoâs troubles here in New Testament 13. <br><br> How far can the title of Academy Cityâs #3 take her? <br><br> Has she perhaps fallen behind? <br><br> When words like magician and even Magic God are being used like normal, wouldnât she feel the fear of possibly being left behind and not being able to walk alongside the person she longs for (and had thought she was courageously seeing on his way)? <br><br> And now that the hurdle had been set up, how will she overcome it? There are a number of options there. She could make sure Kamijou can do his best by giving him an everyday life to return to. She could decide everyone has fields they excel in and therefore support him only in the areas where her skills lie. <br><br> But given Mikotoâs nature, I want her to keep at it from head on. I want her to keep running after Kamijouâs back no matter how hopeless or reckless it seems. <br><br> It was those feelings that guided the direction of the story here. How did you like it?  <br>Mikoto will do what she pleases and makes her happy no matter if it's reckless or hopeless. That's a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi should really write suffering volumes.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Kamachi didn't confirmed that. Besides, everyone and their mama knows that Touma won't end up with anyone. We will have a status quo ending. So why should people get mad at something they already knows? <br><br>Kamachi's isn't trying to make Mikoto be together with Touma romantic as an end game. You're missing a major reason behind why she wants to chase after him, it isn't simply because of romantic feelings. It's more complicated than that and Kamachi is taking steps to build up for a obvious bro-friend relationship for Touma and Mikoto. Even if she won't end up with him, she'll still be happy come for her acceptance and be the type of girl that sends him on his way with a pat on the back while she stands by his side on the battlefield.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;But given Mikotoâs nature, I want her to keep at it from head on. I want her to keep running after Kamijouâs back no matter how hopeless or reckless it seems. <br>He basically says Mikoto won't give up on catching up with Touma. It's so weird that these haters keep twisting that. What drives these people to such delusions?</br></br>  <br>The only delusion I see is people thinking that somehow means she will succeed.</br>  <br>The only thing haters have left is to twist what Kamachi said despite the fact everything he said is positive for her.<br><br><br> succeed <br>Irrelevant. Kamachi didn't confirm anything regarding that. Go see </br></br></br></br></br>  Always remember that Index is not a romantic light novel but a story of a highschool boy's downfall to darkness (along with other edgy shit Kamachi can offer).   another thread is getting shitted up by Mikotofags and Mikotohaters <br>Why can't we all get hyped about the Dragons/Invisible Thing teasing</br>  <br>It's really not very edgy.</br>  <br>Mikoto was involved and Kamachi confirmed status quo</br>  <br>Who cares.

Hawk scans are rife with mistakes and intentional meddling.<br><br>That said, there are a few lines I like more, too. Like when Wyald is about to hit Guts with a tree, he says "Now let's see you fly...like a hawk!" in the Hawks scan. I felt that was a much better line for that character than the official translation, which you can see here.</br></br></br>  <br>ACTUAL ACTUAL story<br>Theresia got raped by trolls. Jill was murdered by an unicorn.</br></br>  <br>Because it's old bait. Pretty bad, too.</br>  <br> Jill was murdered by an unicorn. <br>Raped, then murdered. Unicorns love deflowering virgins.

He's too small, he's got shorter hair, it's in a different part of the world happening almost at the same time as the Lost Children stuff. Also different hair color.

Berserku started in 89, and didn't get mainstream popular until the tv show in 98. Berserku just came out at the wrong time. If it was a 70's manga, it would have gotten at least a few OVAs, like Debruman.</br></br></br>  <br>Please do. <br><br><br>I feel bad for them.  ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.

We have a Griffith dickrider.</br>  <br> Ricket: Yeah (you fucking penis-breath whore) </br>  <br> there's only one person besides me in the thread <br>Your autism is impressive.</br></br>  <br><br>If you could keep going I would greatly appreciate it.</br></br>  <br> filler <br>MIIIUUURAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>I didn't read +30 volumes in 15 days for this you fucking cunt</br></br></br>  <br>The director for Dark Souls 3 has gone on record saying that From are literally taking animations directly from Berserk, as well as letting you attack really fast like Gattsu.</br>  <br><br>Welp I just started a game of dota so wait until it's done  sorry </br></br>   morons misuse the word filler because they want to fit in   <br> More Berserk References <br>Good.<br>That Artorias battle was sick as fuck. Wonder what they got cooked up next.</br></br></br>  Why is he so tsundere?  <br>I fucking hate newfags like that.</br>  <br><br> morons calling obvious filler anything other than filler because they want to feel superior </br></br>  <br>Agreed, that'd be so much better I think.</br>  <br>Do you mean everything before the Golden Age?</br>  <br>Symphonic metal would be ideal</br>  <br>I hate to be one of those guys who calls everything he doesn't like bait or is just too stupid/legitimately autistic to pick up on a joke but <br> Requiem for a dream <br>Anon..Are you'a yanking my chain?</br></br></br>  <br>those grind marks/brush strokes.. really?</br>  <br>I thought there werer supposed to be 100+ chapters, is the Korean translation team not done with these translations?</br>  <br><br>100 page recap, with a new chapter. The series has had so few updates in years new readers will have no god damn idea what's happening.</br></br>  <br>hell Yeah! I wish there was more fast, special attacks available in dark souls, like the dark wood grain ring, but for offensive. I wonder if a skill tree like system would ruin dark souls..</br>  <br><br>You better continue anon or god helps me i will...  Do nothing  </br></br>  <br>So the one posted above is basically the new chapter? Now we have to wait until next month in order to get the story going???</br>  <br><br>Yes. Welcome to Berserk.</br></br>  <br>He's comic relief  until he dies just like chichi </br>  <br>still autist</br>  <br> Those sluts thinking they have a chance wth Rickert, bitch-slapper of God Hands. </br>  <br> call someone else a moron <br> use a cum dumper girl image reaction </br></br>  <br> Gattsu <br>???</br></br>  Can gattsu kill Griffith without sacrificing the whole world?  <br>Lucie is the blonde, wavy haired one. Foucet is the rather plain, black haired one. Pepe is the smug one who nearly got hauled off by the HICKs to the happy fungeon.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> Gattsu <br><br>Guts. Stop reading the shitty Hawk scans.</br></br></br>  So are the new chapters gonna be 20 pages long ?<br>Really?<br>Only 20 pages per month?</br></br>  <br>At least it's something, better than nothing for 6 <br>months...</br></br>  <br>So then what was that thing on the leaked paged about 100 pages?</br>  <br><br> per month <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br></br>  Does Miura even give a shit anymore?  how was the new chapter anyway? I can't read moon  <br> Pepe is the smug one <br><br>how did he know</br></br></br>  <br>But its confirmed for monthly release from now on</br>   have Berserk on Backlog for 2 years <br> everyone keeps talking about how great it is <br> get into Dark Souls/Bloodborne <br> apparently Berserk everywhere <br> just finished reading entire manga + anime <br> mfw <br>I couldn't imagine the agony of waiting for that hiatus to end. Hunter x Hunter has it bad enough. But at least Berserk's art didn't turn into scribbles.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the point of posting that /v/ pic?</br>  <br>Don't insult my /v/ pics</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Aw shit.<br>Just found a fuckton of redraws for the DH scans, so no more annoying white lines in the middle of the spreads.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!uc8UzTwI!T2kt<wbr>Hl5jliz5vkPI1mjnzA<br><br>Enjoy, fuckers.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you fucked your oni-chan yet?</br></br>  I've gotten this far, and want to ask: are the human soldiers ever shown putting up any kind of decent fight against even trash mobs like these?<br><br>The Berserk world even seems to have entered the pike-and-shot era - y'know, like in Warhammer. It would be pretty cool to see one pitched battle in which the coalition holds any ground on their own against the Kushan demons.</br></br>  <br>The Dark Souls OST honestly. Sakuraba's music is heavily uninspired as of late but listening while reading is quite fitting. For dramatic fights anyways. <br><br>Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin's theme makes me think of Casca's rape and Skull Knight. Skull Knight is so cool. Legitimately surprised me when he actually appeared multiple times and helped people out.</br></br></br>  <br> trash mobs <br>Pretty sure those are elite tropes with superhuman strength.</br></br>  Think of reading the manga again. Cant remember if 3rd of 4th time but anyways, which chapter should I start with? Thinking of skipping the "flashback" arcs.  <br>Dude you have to keep in mind that they have never ever laid eyes upon demons before, and suddenly there is a horde of them invading.<br>Noone thought it to be possible, they are probably all in shock seeing their enemies, unable to put up much of a fight due to moral.<br>Moral is extremly important in battles, keep reading, they put up a better fight in the later volumes.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are those weapons even</br>  <br>Yes</br>  For some reason I stopped reading Berserk last year around the part where Guts meets Farnese and Serpico. Now I want to pick it up again but I've pretty much forgotten most of the lore. What do  <br>bullshit</br>  <br>Yes. Griffith's human soldiers are competent and good at killing monsters.</br>  <br>What would you call them, relative to the other beasts?<br><br><br>Yes, it's to be expected in that situation. But I'd like to see what they could do when prepared for what's coming. <br><br><br>Alright, very good then. I assumed Miura would try to emphasize the hopelessness of the fight by continuing to make the regular soldiers fucking useless, but I'll take your word for it and expect some show of competence on humanity's part. <br><br><br>demonic duck cocks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reread all of it</br>  <br>reread it, you lazy fuck.</br>  <br> expect some show of competence on humanity's part.  <br>Volumes 33-34.</br></br>  I wonder if Rakshas transforms next episode.  <br>I hope you read the DH version.</br>  <br>only band of the hawk humans can stand their ground</br>  <br> beeing a newfag <br>We all know its gonna be monthly for 2 or 3 months and then we will get hiatus again.  And about the upcoming chapters before a new hiatus? still on boat. </br></br>  <br>Nice.<br><br>Actually, I'm asking if they're able to mount some organized resistance on their own. It's not just that Griffith-sama comes to save them with apostles, right?<br><br><br>That's what I've got.<br><br><br>Well shit. I suppose that's enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. And technically Berserk was biweekly.</br>  <br> It's not just that Griffith-sama comes to save them with apostles, right? <br>No, but this is a huge spoiler.</br></br>  So apart from femto, what is the purpose of the other godhands?<br><br>I mean what do they usually do? <br><br>Do they give a fuck about the world at all?</br></br></br></br>  <br>a little of both</br>  <br>They're similar to the chaos gods from warhammer.</br>  <br>Wasn't one of them spreading plagues?<br><br>Void is super big on causality, maybe he fights time travelers.</br></br></br>  someone explain falconia<br>I'm still trying to understand</br>  <br>Agents of chaos?<br>We honestly know next to nothing about them.<br>We know about the 'idea of suffering' or whatever it was called but the god hands exact role is unclear.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll get there myself, then. <br><br><br>Exactly what I wanted. Very good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>real life shitposters</br>  are there any people that actually hate Berserk?  <br>They are the executors of Idea's will. <br><br><br>When the worlds merged a fantasy city from old legends (the fabled Gaiseric city) appeared along with other fantasy creatures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Gaiseric's sunken city risen from the ground.</br>  <br>I do.</br>  Fucking rickert. It's been a while but rereading 337 is satisfying as fuck.  <br>Why?</br>  <br>it's too good.<br>the thought of me or the author dying before it's finished scares me, adn that makes me mad.</br></br>  I don't even remember some relatively important characters, who the hell is Jill?<br><br>I better just read Berserk again</br></br>  I don't want them to get off the boat. What will I joke about when they do?  <br>Well anon, I dont know if you believe in an afterlife or ghosts, but I take comfort in the possibility that if I die I can come back to haunt Miura and find out the ending myself.</br>  Who /boughtall37volumes/ here?  <br>Is there a way to do that without going broke?</br>  <br><br>Hope that they pull a HxH and sell the entire series for a reduced price.</br></br>  <br>My love for you is like a truck, berserker!</br>  <br>Of course, seems a bit harsh to not pay for it after so long reading it<br><br>By having a fucking job</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's the little kid in the fake elf arc. I forgot what it's called. <br><br> Doesn't really matter because she's dead. Stupid Jill, screams and shouts won't save you </br></br></br></br>  <br>Jets Comics or Dark Horse?</br>  <br>Dark horse as I don't into moon and it was the only one I could get hold of easily<br><br>I didn't fuck up did I?</br></br></br>  I get that fujos ship everything, but I dont see how anyone can ship Guts and Griffith. Even that splash fight by the well didn't give off homolust. Why is the writing so good?  <br><br>I agree about the writing. It's pretty rare to find a good manga with a grimdark theme that is not cringe-inducing.</br></br>  <br>Jerome (that random knight who fell in love with the prostitute) decapitated two of Mozgus' executioner angels IIRC. Also the new Band of the Hawk in general is pretty competent.</br>  <br>Having a water fight with your naked effeminate friend isn't gay though.</br>  <br>Where is the best place to buy them?</br>  <br>I don't like some smaller parts. I still think that all this troll rape was unnecessary. I love Ganishka, though.</br>  <br> the new Band of the Hawk <br><br>They're all Apostles, though. Maybe not Rakshas, but still.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Nah, there are a bunch of normal humans in it like Mule. They're actually good at killing trash mobs, it's only op shit like trolls/cockatrice that they need the apostles to save their asses.</br>  <br>Apostles are just a small part of Griffith's army.</br>  How is Serpico so good at fighting? I get that he trained with nobles and is good at using the terrain, but that doesn't really explain how he's stood toe to toe with Guts multiple times without getting destroyed.  <br>Working on it<br>never done this before<br>thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't he's just clever and uses strategy so he didn't get fucked instantly</br>  <br>Big dick Rickert is the man.</br>  Serpico vs silat <br>normal weapons only, <br>who wins?</br></br>  <br>serpico relies on circumstance to fight, I'd say in a straight battle silat would rek him</br>   Berserk then <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K1M<wbr>uvvS_xSw</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xqB<wbr>AKptamUk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oq9<wbr>dspskCEE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P7T<wbr>Wm3Akw-s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Berserk now <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gnd<wbr>1wSIyN-g</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=f55<wbr>RlA9mVec</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=S-J<wbr>dqiJA1rg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> tfw moeshit killed Berserk </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok, I thought you just meant the Bigshots Griffith has hanging around.</br></br>  <br>You'll like it eventually, anon.</br>  <br>I don't think he's an apostle</br>   they finally found the elf king <br> he returned casca's memory <br> she couldn't handle the truth and went crazy again <br><br>Good job guts</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure he is one.

He's not that good at sword fighting but he made up for it with planning ahead.</br>  <br> she couldn't handle the truth and killed herself </br>  <br>Unless moon speak bro comes back i can probably only do one more page</br>  <br>Welp I think this is it for now</br>  <br>Jill is a teenage girl, that is a child.</br>  <br>Album'd First 8 pages.<br>http://imgur.com/a/SFZqV<br>I can do more pages later if anyone can translate.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br><br><br>Rickert thinks to himself: "if this city has been built on the cemetery of my comrade in arms, I can't stay here comfortably, even if this is a utopia."<br>Luca keeps it real: "Well, it's between men. But what will you do with this girl? Take her with you again, in the wilderness where monsters appear?"<br>Erica: "I...will definitely follow him, he's my family."<br><br>Luca gets into a grand speech: "In life, sometimes you get somebody precious. But whether it's somebody who is with you or somebody who already left you, somebody close or somebody you walked away from... No matter what you choose, there's always regret. But at least you shouldn't make excuses to yourself."<br><br>The girls are fawning: "Ah you are great Luca. Don't you regret about Jerome?"<br>Luca: "His wife is too fierce. I couldn't fool her, and I'm not that type of woman."<br><br>Blonde slut: "Hey you lazy people, come and help us."<br>Luca to Rickert: "You don't have to hurry, think on it well."<br>Daiba: "Being young is good."<br><br>Rickert, upon seeing the scale of things in Falconia: "It's huge... This energy... All the people here are so intent on things. Everybody is committed and driven. I think whoever lives in this city will be like them. This is falconia, the city of Griffith."<br><br>He's thinking about what Luca said to him... Then comments to himself, facing the city: "Family... I also had one..."<br><br>Someone replies : "Ah, that's too bad..."<br>Rickert: "Darkness?"<br>Rakshas: "Separation with your family, it's so hard and lonely, but you don't have to worry."<br>Rakshas: "Even if you disappear, your family will be taken good care of under the protection of the Falcon in this city."<br>Rakshas: "Your family will live without any problem."<br>Rakshas: "So, please go without having any regrets."<br><br>Silat: "Is it the order of the Falcon himself, or is it a trick of that knight, Locus or whatever? Anyway, that boy seems to know the secret of the Falcon..."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I found that site too, but I can't figure out what goes where and how to fit everything<br>also there would be empty bits.<br>This is the best i could do for page 9 using that.<br>What really fucks it up is all that luca is suppose to say<br>i dont even</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Silat's a pretty brave guy to challenge one of Griffith's elite apostles head on. Especially the one he has history with. He's clearly outmatched unless Daiba or someone else intervenes. The lumpies probably won't survive this. That is, if Rakshas even fights. I wouldn't be all that surprised if he made some odd comment and slinked off someplace without a fight.<br><br>If it were Locus, Grunbeld or even Irvine I couldn't see it happening, but with Rakshas it's a possibility.</br></br></br>  Question is, did Lotus show anger over how Griffith was treated by Rickert (and thus call the hit), or was Lotus showing anger over how callously and two-facedly Griffith put out a hit on his former comrade in arms?  <br> &gt;all these plebs saying metal <br><br>prog rock son.</br></br></br>  I wonder what became of Nina. Did she OD on ye olde medieval heroin?  <br><br>She probably succumbed to her disease.</br></br>  <br>Serpico would probably lose to the tapasa as well</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Lotor was mad about the disrespect shown to his patron and was the person who asked Rakshas to plug Rickert. The scene where he was looking down at the bridge all pissed off was moments after Rickert had walked away, so I don't see how he could be mad at Griffith for issuing an order before he even spoke to anyone.</br>  <br>Damn. Syphilis is a really shitty way to go. RIP worst girl.</br>  <br>Died of the STDs she got from all the plague ridden cocks she took at those orgies</br>  <br>I'm sorry but that pic was asking for it</br>  <br>That scene is set slightly after / further off from the previous chapter, and Lotus is also some ways distant from Griffith. It's very much possible that he had left some sort of command with the Knight like "If he refuses, fetch Rakshas" or some such. That he came back in time to see false-sympathy.<br><br>â¦ Or, as you suggest, it's possible Lotus takes matters into his own hands. That he couldn't take the disrespect and falsifies a command since it'd be VERY easy for pretty much anyone in his new Band to believe he'd put out a hit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>it's all in preparation for the big happening</br></br>  <br>Is lost Children ever going to get adapted?</br>  <br>Considering Logan's attitude from the previous chapter I really can't see it as sympathy for Rickert/anger at Griffith. Miura went out of his way to paint a picture of fierce loyalty toward Griffith and solidarity between apostles. From where I stand it's clear that he was outraged that someone would show such disrespect to their messiah.</br>  <br><br> Griffith's spirit tree moe-fies the entire continent <br> Guts crashes it down with sheer GAR and jawline  <br> im@s is kill  <br><br> it will never happen </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guts is going blind.<br><br>Or maybe he was just overwhelmed by dat Cass ass.</br></br>  <br>Who needs to see when you just need to rage</br>  I really want those spoilers to be at least hslf legit  <br>i-is she turning into a frog?</br>  <br><br>Are you people fucking blind? Since when did Jill wear pants and jacket? Also this kid's hair doesn't even extend past the collar of the jacket.</br></br>  <br> its another fucking falconia chapter and not simply guts and co getting of the fucking boat <br> kuzan dudes show up <br> will probably job like a mother fucker next chapter <br>fug, following berserk is suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought that was Blackdog trying to takeover again.</br></br>  Posting best true Hawk soldier  <br> implying hard </br>  <br>fuck her</br>  <br>That's not even Mule.</br>  <br>It's the only way, really.</br>  <br>I think you posted a page before Irvine shows up by accident</br>  <br> we're the band of the hawk </br>  <br>I can't stand this bitch.</br>  What if this Kushan fight is just a cliffhanger and the next chapter is Guts and co? <br>Please let me be right Miura, I don't want to wait any longer.</br>  <br>How much did that cost?<br><br> an arm and leg? </br></br></br>  How many pages is this chapter?  Shota Puck &gt; Chestnut Puck  <br>So is there any reason for the switch? Also I was surprised to see a comic relief character who isn't annoying. I liked his dynamic with Guts.</br>  <br>So how many days until theres 1000 different things replacing that right panel.</br>  <br>What if Miura was just biding his time and plotting, researching idolmaster, so he may better destroy all moe shit?</br>  <br><br> Not   an arm and an eye. <br><br>It's okay anon, you tried.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ what the fuck is that Parental Advisory shit? Can you even remove that? It triggers my autism.</br>   story turned from a man seeking blind vengeance to a family adventures(Kids included!) <br><br>This is fucking bullshit.</br></br>  <br> This is the living image of Berserk getting worse and worse. </br>  I want to fuck puck so badly, why isn't there any doujin of him...It is just fucking Casca.  <br>Somebody drew a lewd thing of Puck and Guts some time ago when tane was really horny.</br>  <br><br>Killing herself seems the most likely outcome, granting she probably lost her memories as safety measure.</br></br>  <br>Can someone confirm this is not shit-tier TL?</br>  <br>Yeah, funny story, the guy realized that blind vengeance wasn't actually helping anything, and was just causing him to drift further away from what he lost in the first place.</br>   Griffith's Failure Criteria <br><br> Fracture mechanics was developed during World War I by English aeronautical engineer, A. A. Griffith, to explain the failure of brittle materials. <br> Griffith suggested that the low fracture strength observed in experiments, as well as the size-dependence of strength, was due to the presence of microscopic flaws in the bulk material. <br> The growth of a crack requires the creation of two new surfaces and hence an increase in the surface energy. Griffith found an expression for the constant C in terms of the surface energy of the crack by solving the elasticity problem of a finite crack in an elastic plate. <br><br>neat, didn't realize Miura was a structural geologist</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same</br>  <br> blind vengeance wasn't actually helping anything <br><br>Come on now, he made that far because of that and that alone. Not magic bullshit or plot armor Now the author is materializing power of friendship bullshit like every other manga into it.</br></br></br>  <br>While you were waiting for the gore scenes to show up, foreshadowing was happening.<br><br>Did you miss the part about how Guts is becoming increasingly injured, and how he has a behelit?<br>And how he now has people important to him to sacrifice?<br><br>And your power of friendship complaint is horseshit. Give me one page where the power of friendship alone magically solves all problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is removeable, but I attempted it on one and it did that thing stickers do where part of it gets left behind so I just leave them on now.</br>  <br>go wild, anon</br>  <br>The fight with the big crystal dragon guy, which makes the story pull out a magical armor out of the ass to beat him, but HEY it is okay, right? There is consequences aside from the fact the goddamn little witch kid negates said bigger consequence of the armor driving him insane.</br>  <br>A major theme of the story is Guts struggling between choosing to keep pursing vengeance, and protecting Casca. He now needs the party because his anger got the better of him and she won't stay with him anymore. With their arrival on Elfheim, Guts' big decisions will be whether or not to restore Casca's sanity, and whether to settle down with her or keep trying to kill Griffith. At the moment Guts also needs his JRPG party to keep him from completely losing it and turning into an animal. Like it or not, the party was naturally to keep Guts growing as a character, even though the past few years he's remained fairly static.</br>  Been reading the eclipse and Miura created perhaps the best hybrid of disturbing insectile properties merged with human flesh. Funny how Berserk first equated evil with degenerate forms and now presumably finds horror in classical beauty.  <br>I don't think you understand how the power of friendship thing works<br>Also the armor is literally killing him. Do you miss the part where he is going blind and his hair is turning white or the part where he isn't being protected any more that normal arm and armor simply makes not feel pain and holds his broken bones until the fight is over. The Insanity thing was going before the army any way. If you want power of friendship then blame the witch and the kid stopping his rampages.</br></br>  <br> tbh <br><br>Why is this a thing?</br></br></br>  <br> being protected any more that normal arm and armor <br>anymore than normal armor while the armor</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he's not allowed to sleep due to the curse mark. Casca is also curse marked. They can't be free until he dies (at which point his sacrifice is complete and he is sucked into hell...), or possibly kills Griffith?</br>  <br>I love you.</br>  <br>I don't know how I feel about that image</br>  <br>Of course I forgot to mention that the thing that prevents him from sleeping is being surrounded and attacked by hordes of demons at all times from all dimensions.</br>   no getting off the boat <br>Dammit<br>So when's the next chapter?</br></br>  <br>The point of going to an island of elves is that elves live in places protected from evil. This is the reason Casca lived in an elf cave for two years. The reason they can sleep on the boat is because of Schierke's seals warding off spirits.</br>  <br>Im on mobile. Would you mind terribly, the 2nd photo in the thread of griffith and caska?</br>  <br> It's an actual sticker <br><br>And this is on every volume of Berserk?

I dont think Griffith knows about Silat being there.<br><br>I dont think he knew Rickert was going to slap him across the face like a bitch.<br><br>And he needs Sonia to be his future telling guide and shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can wait till she gets her shit slapped by witch loli whos name I cant remember cause I havent read in years</br>  <br>It cant be Guts'.<br><br>I refuse to believe he'll become an apostle.</br></br></br>  <br>He won't. The situation will get desperate, he'll be offered the chance and just say "Nah" and cut down the void itself.</br>  <br>I'd love that but would a behelit open up if you are destined to refuse it? I think the counts case in the beginning might be a special case. <br><br>I mean, how many behelit users refused to become an apostle/godhand?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure SK nomed that behelit</br></br>  <br>Getting back on the boat.</br>  <br>Guts still has it m9</br>  <br> how many behelit users refused to become an apostle/godhand? <br>With the sheer amount of apostles I honestly can't say. I mean, normally I'd guess that there had to be someone out there who chose to go to hell, like that guy who couldn't sacrifice his daughter, but he was already an apostle when it happened. I guess not feeling sadness or fear was too neat of a deal, also hell looks spooky so there's that.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure but causality is not synonymous with "determinism" or whatever the fuck. Guts can have this huge imperative to use it but ultimately he'll refuse to become an apostle.</br>  <br> out there who chose to go to hell, <br>I dont think he went to hell because he refused the sacrifice but because he was already an apostle and he was basically dead. If you take a healthy regular person in a ceremony and they refuse, I assume they just go back to normal life.</br></br>  Has it ever been stated what dictates the strength of an apostle? Griffith was a special case, but he also had tons of sacrifices meanwhile, everyone else had like 1 or 2. But some just turn out absurdly strong while others are like pushovers.  <br>It probably correlates with the amount of desperation they felt at the time</br>  <br>It's Pucks.<br><br>Jk. He's the struggler. He's going to be the one capable carrying a behelit and not using it.<br><br>(or using it to summon hell, kill Griffith, then throw him in hell)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AVv<wbr>hihA9gRc</wbr>  [ ]<br>This video has gameplay, it works really well.</br></br></br>  <br> mfw this song <br><br>It's just too good.<br><br>It's also a bit weird, I noticed that Hirasawa doesn't do too many songs like this one, they're all pretty much reserved for Berserk, like, we see another side of his music.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2Yz<wbr>HTt2Pns4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Best fucking dub outtakes.</br></br>  <br> Best fucking dub outtakes. <br>I'm gonna have to disagree since FMA: Brotherhood exists.

And can Mayuri solo every elite?</br></br>  <br><br> general <br> sigh <br><br>Bleachfags everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  Well this chapter is kind of messy. I can't really tell what happened. Did kenpachi just rip off his arm? I thought mayuri stab kenpachi with his shikai. How come Pernida was affected by Ashisogi jizo ability instead?  God damn it, I'm sick of this cliffhanger shit where it's the damn same cliffhanger EVERY few chapters!<br>I expected we would see his face at the start of this chapter, but no, then I thought it would be a the end, but nope, I won't be surprised if we don't see his face next chapter at all.<br>At least now I can sleep.<br><br> Fuck you, Kubo, fix your pacing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think since he extends his nerves into the bodies of the enemies, Mayuri can infect his nerves by stabbing his enemies as a proxy.</br>  <br>I am a bit impressed with Pernida. His/her powers sure is dangerous.</br>  <br>Jesus you're dumb.<br><br>To put it simple, Pernida's nerves were inside Zaraki. Mayuri stabbing Zaraki took control of Pernida's nerves.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Pernida is controlling with its nerves. So whatever happens to Zaraki will be felt by Pernida through the nerves.</br>  <br>So. When is he fianlly finishing Mayuri? you know it's happening this Arc</br>  I'm guessing we'll find out about happened to Yachiru at the end of this fight.<br><br> Part of me thinks she's Pernida </br></br>  <br>That's dumb and you should feel dumb, also. Holy shit, Zaraki just up and cut off his arm. No more bullshit Kendo asspull.</br>   Zaraki jobs: the chapter <br>Wow, makes Unohana's sacrifice so much more meaningful.</br>  <br>It is, but it makes me wonder a bit, why are his "nerves" invisible?<br>Also wouldn't that mean he needs to protect the nerves going outside? As slashes and random attack going around might harm/severe them, a person with a defensive/offensive aura should be able to protect himself from the nerves.<br><br>Anyway, at least we have Mayuri being Mayuri, it's bound to be entertaining, and he better be.<br><br>It's Mayuri's turn for fun now, no time for Zarakai development, we might not even see the fight next week.<br> Part of me thinks she's Pernida <br>And all of me thinks you're stupid if you're serious.<br>This reminds me that I read the chapter in like 2 minutes if not less...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't cut it, he tore it off.</br>   implying that thing isn't going to turn into a bishie next chapter   Good ol' Batman. Can always be expected to make things interesting-ish.  <br>I can handle a bishie being fucked up by Mayuri's work.</br>   fights with her nerves <br> head grows bigger when slashed <br>Obviously, Pernida is a brain in the jar, same as Gremmy.</br></br>  <br>Fucking Kubo, I liked Unohana and insisted that she would be strong way before it was cool, then she jobbed for THIS.</br>  <br> a person with a defensive/offensive aura should be able to protect himself from the nerves. <br>Only if that Aura is strong enough. It can get by Zaraki's constant monstrous aura easily, so they might be pretty durable.</br></br>  <br> General <br>Fuck off cancer. Mods, please.</br></br>  Well, for a guy relying solely on his body an enemy who relies solely on opponent's body, especially after hax magic power-up, is a perfect counter.<br><br>Also, yet another person loses an arm. I wonder if he'll get it fixed like Soi Fon.</br></br>  <br><br>Eh, I don't know, the only reason Mayuri was able to even get close to Perinda was because Zaraki took one for the team. I think this was just a good case of how team work between Mayuri and Zaraki would pretty much go down.</br></br>  This isn't Hyourinmaru is it? It kinda looks like those ice thingies shota boy makes  <br>Obviously, I think all shinigamis' riatsu function as some sort of shielding Aura, doesn't Zarakai say something like that in his fight against Ichigo?<br>Anyway, yeah, not any aura or shield will be sufficient, and seeing that this is an elite guard, it would probably be something hard to do, but then again, these are nerves, so they should be much more fragile supposing no special Quincy magic.<br><br><br>I have no idea what Mayuri just threw up there.<br><br><br>I don't think this is that kind of general, OP just fucked up in his haste to make a thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kenpachi sure doesn't look as unbeatable as he used to be. Pernida is sort of a bad matchup for him. Mayuri on the other hand seems to be on a roll in this arc.</br>  <br>Looks like ice, either that or Kubo's horrible drawing. Maybe he cut up Hyourinmaru and got his powers or something</br>  <br>I think it's just a liquid splashed.</br>  <br> so they should be much more fragile supposing no special Quincy magic. <br><br>It looks like it's like a specialized blut vene. Ywach also did something sort of similar in his battle against Ichibe.</br></br></br>  <br>I really don't think so, it has to be something that caused the nerves/riatsu to go visible.<br>Probably some solution he made to make such invisible forms of energy visible to the naked eye.</br></br>  <br>At least the elites are living up to their hype for now.</br>  <br>Except Kenpachi</br>   GOAT captain continues being the most based character of this arc <br>The pacing of this fight is pretty slow so far but I definitely enjoyed the chapter.</br>  so nerve controlling is "Compulsory"?  <br><br><br><br> yfw we already saw Yhwach use this technique on Ichibe </br></br></br></br>  <br>she makes you do things. those things she wants to make you do become compulsory. even to the point that your limbs become distorted.</br>  <br>Seriously. He's the only captain who hasn't jobbed</br>  <br>Ishida did beat him once in the soul society arc.</br>  <br>He jobbed in his first fight against Judas.</br>  <br><br><br>losing =/= jobbing<br><br>God you rasselfags are retarded</br></br></br></br></br>  It became kind of a trend to lose an arm in shounen. <br>This chapter was a bit confusing.</br>  <br>would you say the arm loss was a little  disjointed? </br>  <br>fuck off nigga, just go suck a cock and relax</br>  <br>Not only has he done well fight wise, I also think hes had the best character interactions and comedy moments this arc.</br>  <br>Well it's cliche but its a cliche for a reason. It doesn't bother me that much.</br>  <br>yes it is somebody has to do the job.<br>losing = jobbing its the fucking definition you fucking rukiafag.<br>somebody has to go over and somebody has to do the job.<br>mayuri did the job for ishida and made him look strong as fuck.<br>then they made ishida still look strong by making his loss to tousen basically mean nothing since he was already losing his strength.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i would maybe understand if you said jobber but, jobbing litteraly means the guy who is booked to lose.<br>jobbers on the other hand are the people who typically eat the pin.<br>if anything you should probably look things up before making yourself look stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>I-is that a bajingo?</br>  <br><br>Not that guy, but he's right. Jobbing isn't simply losing, its losing easily to hype up another character. Having a good fight and losing (Mayuri vs Uryu) is not jobbing.</br></br>  <br><br>I think reducing Bleach to levels of rasslin 'writing' is selling it short. But you kids like your maymays...</br></br>   Based Kenp- <br> Based Fucking Mayuri. <br><br>He could solo the elite.</br></br></br>   Mayuri Saving Kenpachi's life and acting lieka boss vs a quincy even shutara didn't knew what to do <br><br>Holy shit Kubo really has a hard on on Kurotsuchi lately.<br><br> He should be Captain Commander. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  god this shit sucks. bring back aizen  <br>its called a clean job jabronie. <br><br><br>all writing can described with wrestling terbs you mark.<br>you gimmie an arc or any fight and i can tell you any and all ways it used a wrestling writing style.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's really nice about Mayuri is that he always seems to know exactly how much he can handle. A lot of the other captains get over confident and slip into bad situations, but he's never been in a fight he wasn't ready for. <br><br><br>Nah he needs the freedom. If Kyoraku dies I want either Urahara or Aizen. Mayuri works great as the mad scientist advisor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shutara fought the Wind, not Compulsory. Yoruichi was the one who got messed up by the C.</br>  It seems to me that Unohana died for nothing.<br>kenpachi amyb e stronger now, but he didn't learn anythin about fighting seriously or studying your enemy before slashing them up.</br>  <br>Royal Guards were off-paneled in the biggest job of Bleach history, so we have no idea who Shutara fought before.</br>  <br>People have this impression that Unohana was sacrificed for the sake of Kenpachi's character, but honestly that fight was way more about Unohana's character arc than anything else. Her story was wrapped up very neatly, people are just disappointed that she was destined to be a minor character.</br>  <br>yeah its like newspeak for retards.<br><br><br>that shuutara fight was a shenanigan.<br><br><br>Also i really want to know about mayuris origin. I think it is telling that he got away with talking back to Yamamoto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Until Ishida shoved his Quincy cock in his ass.</br>  <br> someone  <br> finishing mayuri. <br><br>and then a clone pops up in his lab where his soul can go before dispersing.<br><br>Mayuri is reaching this guys level of hax, he may not be able to defeat everyone, but sure as hell he can't be killed either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think you guy your own personal definition of the word mixed up with the actual definition.<br><br><br>you should probably go back to saying kawaii and being a weeaboo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No that's just Kubo using samesfx like he does with sameface.<br><br>Have you not noticed Kubo is a master of recycling?</br></br></br>  <br> No more bullshit Kendo asspull <br>You sure you don't mean Mayuri? I don't hate him but Mayuri and his infinite drugs is nothing more than a "reasonable" way to convey asspull and dues ex machina.</br></br>  <br> zaraki lost an arm and both legs maybe some internal organs. <br><br>I sure hope mayuri can fix him somehow.</br></br></br>  <br>So Fine didn't job. Neither did Captain Woof.</br>  <br>fuck you ;_;<br>im holding out for a return by her and seeing her smack ken one and say 'i didnt raise a coward'.</br></br>  <br>So you're saying that every single time a character loses a battle, they jobbed? That just plain doesn't make sense.</br>  <br>a weaboo? on my /a/?! well i never!</br>  <br>Well it being reasonable is kinda the point. Some people were really bothered by the Kendo thing, at least the science stuff is easier to swallow.</br>  <br>why is she so perfect</br>  <br>if someone loses they're a loser right?<br>yea mayuri was the loser for the match that's what job means.<br>jobber is somebody whos only reason for existence is to lose to make someone look strong.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah and ichibei just tore it with reiatsu saying somethign along the lines of<br><br> how do you dare to touch my body! </br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about Orihime-san?</br>  <br>because shes tough as nails</br>  <br> jobber is somebody whos only reason for existence is to lose to make someone look strong. <br>This is correct but it clearly doesn't apply to every single fight. A weak character being beaten instantly by Aizen isn't jobbing, and two strong characters having a close fight isn't jobbing. The important bit is the "lose to make someone look strong".</br></br>  Jesus fuck Zaraki. I know he's the brute, but christ, why attack again when you know that there is potential that you will lose two arms?  <br> &gt;yeah <br> &gt;sorry <br><br>someone make it happen please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do hope it doesnt end up with a cliche'd ichigo vs ishida battle. it would be gay as fuck</br>  <br>Jugo was worried about Ishida, so I think he might pull a Gin.</br>  i hope kubo does a high school romance after bleach  <br> expecting character development from cardboard cutouts </br>  <br>but ken isn't a coward.<br><br>He is a retard though.</br></br></br>  <br>I still hold hope for the RG to have some relevance in the arc, but with kubo one can never know.</br>  So does Mayuri just have Hitsugaya on ice or what  Orihime is the best character discuss<br><br>I wish kubo would make her even more stronger</br></br>  good o' drugs <br>can't go wrong with them<br>heck i bet he could beat fucking aizen and yhwach</br></br>  <br> Mayuri <br> Desty Nova <br><br>I wouldn't mind seein some kind of crossover ith these two interacting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes for a jobber specifically a jobber.<br>job = losing cause every outcome needs a loser.<br>jobber = purposely lose without effort on the other persons part to make them look strong.<br> A weak character being beaten instantly by Aizen isn't jobbing.  <br>of course it is. "Look at aizen annihilated those guys like it was nothing!" makes him look strong/remind the reader how strong he is.<br> two strong characters having a close fight isn't jobbing <br>thats called a clean job it makes both people look good without "burying" aka making them look like weak pieces of shit.<br>to do a job isn't a bad thing somebodies gotta do the "job" of losing while the one who goes "over" has the job of winning.<br>here maybe the wiki definition can help you understand better.<br> Job, in professional wrestling slang, is a term that describes a losing performance in a wrestling match.[1] It is derived from the euphemism "doing one's job", which was employed to protect kayfabe. The term can be used a number of ways. When a wrestler is booked to lose a match it is described as "a job." The act itself is described with the verb jobbing, while the act of booking (rather than being booked) to job is called jobbing out. To lose a match fairly (meaning without any kayfabe rules being broken) is to job cleanly.[2] Wrestlers who routinely lose matches are known as jobbers. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kenpachi vs Valkyrie, and Mayuri vs Naak le vaar would be more interesting</br>  <br>Ywach can see anything, he would debunk all of mayuri's crap easily. <br><br>Only an asspull would beat Ywach.</br></br></br>  <br> one can evolve past the drugs' potential and other can just nullify it <br><br>Yeah I don't think so</br></br></br>  <br>I think for ken to truly evolve as a character he needs to fight someone in a different fight. not just the old 'rushing headlong into battle' cliche. i liked where he actually thought and destroyed the oh-so intellectual Tosen's bankai. on recent evidence that was a fluke  and that pisses me off </br>  <br>I think it will be ichigo vs elderich horror yawach, but there WILL be an ishcida vs ichigo before that.</br>  <br>Naak Le vaar already measured mayuri and decided that it would be too ahrd and in the end he would probably lose the fight, so that won't be happening.</br>  <br>He said it would be too tiring to get him to die. he didnt assume he would lose the fight.</br>  <br>or a nakama powered getsuga</br>  I was wondering who was gonna bury who.<br><br>Turns out Mayuri buried BOTH Zaraki and Pernida.<br><br>Normally, I wouldn't mind seeing Zaraki getting buried, except if Mayuri or Byakuya were the ones holding the shovel.</br></br></br></br>  <br> bury <br>Seriously fuck off with your wrestling shit. Do you have to dumb everything down into your retards vernacular? read a fucking book.</br></br>  <br>fe feld, so he wasn't confident that he was going to win.</br>  <br>ever thought he was just bullshitting? this is a guy who was running full pelt from grimmjow only to one shot him.</br>  <br>There are enough bishies in Bleach already so I don't mind that one being torn apart by Mayuri's  dick[\spoiler]. </br>  <br>I think Mayuri has a better than average shot of beating him. If you think about it, he's really one of the best suited to kill someone with weird nonsense immortality powers, Nakk le varr probably realized that and left to fight someone he had better odds against.</br>  <br>grimmjow will use the first resurection and fuck up the D.</br>  <br>well yeah id say mayuri has a great shot at beating anyone.</br>  <br>grimmjow should of much to weak to do anything even remotely close to that.</br>  <br> his other arm gets infected <br> he bites it off and then runs at it again with his sword in his mouth </br></br>  <br>you understimate the kubo.<br><br>But I'd be much more surprised if it was orihime rejecting the D's effects the one to beat him.</br></br></br>    <br>Well that goes without saying, I just meant that he's a particularly bad match up for someone like Nakk who seems to be incredibly strong in a regular fight. His weird power would give him a really good chance of beating most captains but Mayuri is a worst case scenario for him.</br>  <br> daily reminder bleach is shit because each chapter has less content then the last </br>  <br>No i say with full knowledge kubo will pull some nonsensical illogical garbage.</br>  I'm pretty sure that C is a plant.    <br>This manga is really getting on my  nerves. </br>  Still calling it, anyone with me?<br><br> inb4 Quack! </br></br>  <br>CARLOS</br>  Don't you guys think the enemies are really outnumbered by the good guys now? Quincy has like 6 people? How are they even gonna fight Ichigo party + Espada + Shinigami captains?  <br><br>So close</br></br>  <br>That's why some people say that royal guards will switch sides or they jobbed against yhwach.</br>  <br>would also explain why most didn't have a proper fight.<br>I could see Ywash granting them a quincy letter in the process too.</br></br>  <br>How indeed...the royal gaurds combined are stronger than the captains and they got stomped. Espada are useless irrelevant trash now. The remaining elite gaurds were the best and have the combined powers of all the other sternritter which fucked over many of the captains. But Kubo logic works somewhat funny</br>  <br>Espada are with Ichigos party and one of them is already down, by milk.</br>  <br>Don't forget Aizen, Ginjo and facebook, who are going to do something this arc still.</br>  is mayuri salty dhad he wasn't conidered as one of the 5 war potentials and ken was?  <br>kenpachi is stupid, lost an arm attacking, attacks again and risk losing his only other arm but doesn't take off eyepatch nor fucking release.</br>  <br>What would your reaction be if Mayuri hadn't stepped in and Kenpachi would have turned into a pile of gore for real? Like, he's dead for good (until Orihime)?</br>  Mayuri being on point is just to hype him up so he can job to Ishida and transfer all the hype to him.<br><br><br> Unohana dies so Kenpachi can fight without holding back. <br> Kenpachi gets rekt because he's holding back. <br>Unohana died for nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kenpachi had not a single good fight with his new abilities, and he might not get one.<br>Fuck that, he should have totally fought Mask de Masculine, leave Gremmy to a weak, but smart character.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>The qustion is, why did Shunsui wanted Unohana dead? But for real, as we see Kenpachi is not a payoff compared of the asset unohana was.<br><br>So thre must be another motive.<br><br>Was to finally end Yamamoto's yakuza squad? Which has now been accomplished too with the death of the royal guards?<br><br>I know Ichibei is still alive, and he can probably resurrect the others, but I don't think he was part of yamamoto's gang.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gremmy vs shinji <br> shinji shits the fuck up. <br> everything gremmy imagines happens the ooposite way he imagined it <br> shinji keps turning on and off his power so gremmy dosen't know how to act. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention he almost really did die after beating gremmy but still had his fucking eyepatch on the entire fucking time. At this point i think its beyond Kenpachi being stupid and maybe its just Kubo.</br>  Why aren't Ancient Evils awakening as much as they used to?  smug thread    <br><br>That's barely level 2 smug</br></br>  Every smug thread until the sequel    <br>Source nigger</br>  <br>Looks like manga.</br>  <br>Hold on a second, I know this.

Yes, but I didn't finish it.  Yes but I didn't get very far. I'm saving the rest of it for later.  It needs a bd.  <br>Yes it's my favorite anime and I watch it every year or so.</br>  nicky  <br>Why doesn't it have one already?</br>  <br>not yet it's on my list.</br>  <br>I'll probably get back to it once I finished Urusei Yatsura and Mobile Suit Gundam.</br>  Just finished the Black Army arc in City Hunter 2 a couple days ago. It was just so fucking good, probably the peak of the series for me so far and there have been a lot of damn good episodes.<br>But the moment this song kicked in at the climax of the arc just solidified it as a masterpiece to me. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9og<wbr>Bk8wPwpc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's just such a fun anime that I can't help but love it.</br></br></br>  <br>Liked the first season, 2nd was ok, the rest is shit with exception of some of the movies, ovas.</br>  <br>Why is Akira Kamiya so good?<br>He's probably the greatest VA of the 80's and one of the greatest ever.</br></br>  Just finished ZZ less than an hour ago. It had some good episodes here and there but it was overall pretty dissapointing. I feel like I would be able to appreciate it more if it weren't a sequel to Zeta. Also, pic related is the best suit in ZZ.  <br>ZZ had a variety of nice Mobile Suits.<br><br>If you think the Queen Mansa is nice, you're going to like the Kshatriya from Unicorn a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Ryo, Mendou, Coach mitaka<br><br>he truly plays the basest characters.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched Unicorn yet but what I've seen of the NZ-666 looks amazing.</br>  Will there ever be another series like Patlabor?  <br>No. Anime has changed. The industry has changed.</br>  <br>Don't forget.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W3c<wbr>3ScxUUEk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>That playful voice and then serious voice.<br><br>SO FUCKING GOOD MAN.</br></br></br>  <br>The nummer of episodes puts me off. Is it good and what could I expect? Is it comedy?<br><br>Also I got the BD of Rose of Versailles downloaded and muxed the subs for all episodes and now it's ready to be rewatched in glorious 1080p. Too bad the subs from episode 31 upwards are from the DVD release and are badly timed.</br></br></br>  <br>Kenshirou, Roy, Akira Hibiki and a lo of other characters too.<br><br>Kinnikuman just isn't the same without Kamiya and Daisuke Gori.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vs5<wbr>2iyo559o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more than just that, though. There was never really anything like Patlabor at any point in time. It's the only thing to have ever come of Headgear, which was one of the greatest collection of creative talents the industry has ever seen. 'Labor of love' (pun not intended) does not even begin to describe it.</br>  <br>under arrest or whatever it was called with the 2 cop girls is pretty similar</br>  <br>Are you planning on following up with more Gundam, such as CCA or Unicorn?<br><br>CCA is a treat visually but some of the characters and motivations are a little lackluster. You'll see what I mean (or maybe have a contrasting opinion) when you get through it.<br><br>After that, Unicorn and Victory have some slick Mobile Suit designs to look forward to. Victory especially has some that break from tradition while retaining the humanoid shape, but not nearly as much as Turn A.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of City Hunter, I saw that the manga is being scanlated again. <br>Is it any good?</br></br>  <br>It's similar to the point of being slice of life about police. Beyond fairly superficial elements there isn't all that much in it.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm going to check out CCA and Unicorn next. I'm looking forward to the focus returning to characters from 0079 in CCA but like you mentioned I've heard some negative stuff about Char's characterization in the film which I'm not looking forward to.</br>  <br>That's not Daisuke Gouri though. Toei recast everyone except for Kinnikuman and Meat when they adapted the Throne arc.</br>  <br><br><br>I watched the first movie today and it was just fucking great. It had the typical Oshii movie structure of begin with action, proceed to drama, conspiracies, and politics, and finish with action.  Type 0 vs Type 98 fight was baller as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>While I wasn't fond of what they did with Char in CCA, I had bigger gripes over the newly introduced characters. There are a number of aggravating scenes, especially as your progress through the film, all thanks to their meddling.<br><br>You may or may not find the ending to your liking too.</br></br></br>  <br> AV-98 versus AV-0 fight <br>Just about the best moment in the franchise. Noa put all but the most extreme of badasses to shame.</br></br>  I miss the golden age of anime.  <br>There are still some nice anime here and there today.<br><br>If anything I miss my OVAs.</br></br></br>  <br>that pic gave me warm, fuzzy feelings</br>  <br>I'm trying to think of a series with a better dynamic between two main characters. I'm coming up blank.</br>  <br>I don't know, Patlabor reminds of Planetes in a lot of ways.</br>  <br>GE999, though it's a bit different in nature.<br>Well, generally most Matsumoto couples have really good dynamic, be it Maetel and Tetsuro or Harlock and Tochiro.</br></br>  <br>*reminds me of<br>Though yeah, I can't think of anything else.</br></br>  Watched the  dub  of Space Warrior Baldios film from an ancient VHS rip with tracking/mono and stereo issues.<br><br>Despite being an original work, it felt a lot like the Korean Gundam ripoff, Space Black Knight. The stilted voice acting, the absolute ridiculousness, etc. Even with regards to the original voice acting, it doesn't seem like it would be particularly enjoyable. If anything, the shoddy actors made it more entertaining.<br><br>That and the English song "So Long Ago" by Brian Haverty/George Reseter thrown in as the OP and ED. Somehow, it sounds more fitting than the original Japanese song, especially with how the Baldios mech is barely present throughout the entire middle of the film.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well,  anime Tanabe is space Noa and Hachi isn't exactly dissimilar to Asuma.</br>  The oldest one I've watched was Captain Harlock. It's good, but it hasn't aged well at all.  <br> but it hasn't aged well at all. <br>I want this meme to end.</br></br>  <br>It gets even more amazing once you find out that a literal whore pilots it</br>  I have not seen it. Funny that i have seen teh jackie chan movie version and the shitty fuckboi korean soap opera version. <br><br>It's like 30 gigs of the whole thing. I need to check it out.</br></br>  <br>I picked up an OVA of the show on VHS format at some Library sale. Had no idea what I was getting into at the time, Shit was God-Tier</br>  <br>In all fairness, lack of Baldios seems to be only a problem with the movie.<br><br>From what I've heard, the TV series itself is pretty decent. But a lack of English subtitles is keeping me from checking it out.</br></br></br>  <br>I heard very conflicting opinions on City Hunter so I haven't given it a shot yet.<br><br>But I'm running out of high-quality OVAs to watch so I might pretty soon.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow, it sounds more fitting than the original Japanese song, especially with how the Baldios mech is barely present throughout the entire middle of the film. <br><br>The lyrics of the Japanese theme do fit the series pretty well.  In that they are pretty ironic. </br></br></br>  Yes, City hunter is a lovely show. The opening is classy.  <br>Yeah, from the looks of things the original TV series has Baldios present in almost every episode. The movie focuses a lot on the character interactions, though I can't say if it's for better or worse. A shame about the lack of subs, I would check it out otherwise.<br><br><br> The blue of Hope loved by father, mother everybody, will be revived <br> Blue Blue Blue Fixer, Baldios, save the future! <br> The colour of memories lost somewhere will revive the blue of Earth <br><br>I'm going to go out on a limb and assume the TV series follows the same events as the movie? If so, that's hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe that the plot points are mostly the same albeit very compressed in the film version, but the film has the slightly less depressing ending.</br>  <br>It depends on your ability to handle a long series with a mostly strict formula.</br>  currently watching its. Is very funny but I dread that it might get repetitive after a while, particular the, perverted similar jokes.  <br>i wish there would be more main couples in anime with so natural interaction as those two</br>  <br> Couple <br>They're clearly just friends.<br><br>But seriously, I agree completely. You can feel and see it, you don't need to be told THESE ARE THE ONES WITH SEXUAL TENSION. It emerges naturally from the two characters and how they interact with each other. It's also handled with a remarkable respect for subtlety not usually seen in anything Japanese. Most of the time it's a source for cute interactions or gags but there's also a bunch of very nicely handled and often quite touching scenes between them. TV in particular did a great job showing how their bond develops, culminating in pic related at the very end of the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It helps a lot when you have two people that enjoy each other's company. Most anime romances don't seem to go for that.</br>  Has anyone seen Dangcougar? General consensus from what I've seen is that it's nothing special for an old mecha series. But the final dancougar design in SRW Z looked so fucking cool I got curious about it.  <br> it's nothing special for an old mecha series. <br>It's OBARI at his finest, the hell are you talking about?<br>Dancouga is great.</br></br></br>  Lately watched the Queen Emeraldas OVAs, pretty nice and Emeraldas is a cool character, loved the anthology feel to them but I was wondering where to go next for Leiji Matsumoto stuff, I've only seen that and Arcadia of My Youth.  <br>Hey man, that's just what I've seen from looking around for reviews.<br>I'll check it out then.</br></br>  What are some 80s series that got BDs anyway? They're obviously too old for it to be somewhat sensible, but I know Zeta got them since Sunrise got the dosh and fanbase.  Why does anime before 2000 look significantly less embarrassing and gay  <br>Queen Emeraldas OVA is goat, shame for that CG ruining ruining the opening and the last two episodes but the first half of the show is absolutely gorgeus.<br><br>Don't trust reviews anon, Dancouga is as OBARI as you can get and if you like combining robots and rock it's a damn fine treat.</br></br></br>  <br>How is the TV series? I enjoyed both movies and the OVA series immensely.</br>  <br> if you like combining robots and rock it's a damn fine treat. <br>Then I shall now proceed to pleasure myself with this series</br></br>  <br>cute, girly, etc have always been around<br>even worse, you had furry back then</br></br>  <br><br>The opening looked pretty silly and it has not aged well at all but my favourite episodes were probably Siren and the one where Hiroshi and the old man fought the cyborg. The western inspired elements also gave it a really nice charm towards everything too.</br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/JSaDZL7W<br><br>More important question, what are some that actually have subs and you can download. I already have a good number in glorious 1080p but it's kinda hard to look for them all.</br></br></br>  <br> Pre-2000s <br><br>Yeah, I LOVE DBZ!!</br></br></br>  <br>That's a really simple but really important point. I think that this is an issue caused by people drawing more on other media than real life, but so many romances lack any actual chemistry or even the ability to believe that the characters more than tolerate each other.<br>Before you get to anythign else it's apparent that Noa and Asuma just really like being around each other, with the rest of their relationship flowing from that point.<br><br>All of Patlabor has an excellent BD release. By some miracle it's even getting picked up by distributors in the west. It's a much loved IP in Japan and also just got a live action series.<br><br>Softer colours, art shifts.<br><br>It's like an extended and fleshed out OVA1. TV and OVA2 are personally my favourite entries in the franchise, since they give the characters room grow and the setting the ability to stretch its legs. It's a strange mix of OVA1 style shenanigans, straight up bizarre premises (remember the time that SV2 became Colonial Marines?) as well as some excellent dramatic presentation and character moments.<br>Watch it. Watch all of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Siren was a cool episode but if you followed the Harlock universe there are so many contradictions you'll probably feel puzzled, even so it was nice to see Tochiro.<br>The Cyborg episode was nice but I didn't like it as much as the first arc and with the animation quality being much lower it was a bit of a let down, the plot was well written though I liked the idea of a man turned cyborg who continuously upgraded parts.</br></br>  <br> 1980+35 <br> still needing subs for chinese cartoons </br></br>  <br><br> Leiji universe has so many contradictions <br>Having only watched Arcadia of My Youth the flashback to the Siren and Emeraldas's fight where she got her scar confused the shit out of me considering in Arcadia is basically an origin story of how it happened. I'm guessing Matsumoto is either forgettable or just likes to contradict himself a lot?<br><br>The way they took down the cyborg was pretty creative too, using the very elements themselves along with the gravitational field was a smart idea, you can tell a lot went into the writing process.<br><br>I think I'll watch the Harlock series next then start Galaxy Express 999 sometime in the late summer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm guessing Matsumoto is either forgettable or just likes to contradict himself a lot? <br>Matsumoto just flat out said he doesn't really care as long as the story is good, all the stuff in the Leijiverse doesn't really make sense in the little particulars, if you've noticed, in Queen Emeraldas there also is a fifth Dragoon, whereas in SSX and the normal Harlock universe the Dragoons were canonically 4, so there's that.<br>GE999 is also great, I warmly suggest you to also watch the OVAs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Has anything come out on bluray lately besides cutey honey?<br><br>I know we're getting slayers soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been on my backlog forever.</br>  <br>Tobikage and Orguss came out in 2014, and Megazone 23 will be released in the next months.</br>  kaori a shit cockblocking faggot  I want this so badly.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/Orcm7fUx4Z8  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Polymar <br>Good taste Anon, and that bluray release looks fantastic as well.<br>Did classic Casshern get a bluray?</br></br></br>  <br>I caught some of it on a foreign TV channel while i was on vacation as a kid but I haven't gotten into the whole series as of yet.<br><br>That should happen soon though, as I'm almost done with the first half of the 80's section of my anime backlog (Maison Ikkoku, Dirty Pair, Area 88 and a bit of Urusei Yatsura left).</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. It got a Japanese BD release a few years ago and from what I gather Sentai Filmworks actually put out their own blu-ray set. No idea if they are pretty much the same thing or not though.</br>  <br>Thanks for the info Anon, I'll hunt it down.<br>Casshern is one of my favorite old shows,  might even consider buying a copy for my mother since she liked it as well when she was young. </br></br>  Finished Gundam X the day before yesterday, and am almost halfway through with TurnA.<br>I was slightly disappointed with Gundam X, despite having an interesting setting and premise, as it turned into more "Hurrdurr Newtypes" bullshit like with most of early UC. Nice Gundam designs though. The ending, while obviously rushed due to cancellation and cliche, negated all the Newtype stuff, and I think it was the first Gundam ending that I fully enjoyed and was happy with since finishing 0079. <br>TurnA so far is excellent though. Intriguing story, great setting (sometimes it feels as though I'm watching a Ghibli film, or something like Akage no Anne), great characters, breathtaking art and animation(the sheer amount of detail on the close-ups of most Mobile Suits and vehicles turns my dick into diamonds). The pacing is perfect - action scenes are used sparingly and when there is one it's usually worth it, and when there isn't an action scene the story slowly develops and you learn more and more about the world and characters. I can definitely see why people who liked the more action-heavy Gundam series would say it's boring, but it's perfect for me. It's like Tomino spent most of the 90s laying eggs of dubious and varying quality, then accidentally laid a golden one.<br>One thing that I don't about it is the editing or visual direction, or whatever you call it. While most of the show is gorgeous, there are some shots that genuinely make me wonder how it made the final cut, and the sheer amount of wipe transitions, sometimes after consecutive scenes, bother me. It reminded me of Star Wars, and upon googling to find examples I found exactly what I thought of, https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=usX<wbr>ca7W_jvM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Other than that, planning on watching Genocyber and Ninja Scroll later this week. Genocyber for the over-the-top M.D Geist-esque gore, and Ninja Scroll because I heard it was quite popular in the US in the 90s. Are there any other "must-see" short OVAs or films?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem. Hope you  and your mom   enjoy it.<br><br>Speaking of Sentai though, they really ought to release the rest of Urashiman.</br></br></br>  <br> Are there any other "must-see" short OVAs or films? <br>Well, since you're going to watch Ninja Scroll you should also watch the other Kawajiri adaptations from Madhouse, Makai Toshi Shinjuku, Youjuu Toshi, Cyber City Oedo and Vampire Hunter D, they're all great OVAs, maybe MTS is the weakest of all of those because it's kinda too normal and shonen-esque but it's still great.<br>Also, I suggest you definitely check out most of the Madhouse stuff from that time the two Midnight Eye Goku OVAs, Robot Carnival is also a must see for me though it's not from Madhouse.<br><br>Thanks again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had to guess, because Sunrise is focusing their remastering budget on smaller projects (like Patlabor) or old Gundam.</br>  I've been going through City Hunter. About 1/3rd the way through City Hunter 2 and I adore it. Sure it's kinda formulaic, and the status quo is like, sacred and untouchable. But the characters are fun, the jokes are good, and the whole thing is actually surprisingly well animated and cleverly written. It's kind of amazing how self aware it is too. It's like they know about our jokes!  Bump with easy Webbum maker for use with your favourite retro animÃ©.<br>https://euclide.me/webmbuilder/</br>  <br>Still halfway through Patlabor and Cobra, too many stuff to watch in too little time. I have developed a liking to older anime however, it definitely has its charm and some things like Roujin Z or Cyber City Oedo are fucking amazing stuff that isn't made anymore.</br>   Client comes to him in the immediate aftermath of her sister being murdered <br> He hits on her furiously  <br><br>That kind of turned me off from watching more. He seems like an asshole.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's action mixed with comedy fueled by everything 80s.</br></br>  <br>Yes and a new OVA came out a few days ago. No raws for it yet though.</br>  <br><br><br>Dancouga is a interesting show in that it was an attempt to lightly 'deconstruct' mecha shows of the time, especially super robot shows. what Gundam was doing was clearly working at the time and so the creators decided to make a very Super Robot show (ie it combines, alien invasions, team of 4-5 youngsters work together) but wrap it in more grounded/gritty/realistic storyline and setting (much of humanity is part of the resistance group/lots of casualties of war/character fates do not fare well/the opponents and enemies are more charming and formidable than the good guys). A major point being that the main robot, Dancouga does not combine until episode 16, and even then they barely win.<br><br>Dancouga's downfall is that it got cancelled because toys were not selling but people still watched the show and liked the characters. Being cancelled the story was cut short and the last 8 or so episodes really throw a lot of what made the show good out of the window.<br><br>Dancouga is not a 'traditional' show by any means, it focuses more on character relationships than battle sequences (much of which is just punching things or shooting things).<br><br>I enjoyed the show, but I felt let down by the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not so sure how I feel about a new cast but we will see how that goes.</br>  Violence Jack is the best.  <br>Didn't it get an OVA though?</br>  <br>Blame it on dagumi jdm</br>   Toei can make Saint Seiya not shit <br>holy fug<br>they had a lot of great source material to work with with their other series but they can polish a turd when they need to</br></br>  <br> I miss the golden age of anime. <br><br>But we are in the golden age right now!<br><br>It will be no longer a golden age if the number of anime shows gets reduced to say 90% of this year's output</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of like saying that the late nineties/early noughties were the golden age of e-commerce.</br>  <br>Ryo Saeba is based as fuck he pretty much is how I think Ataru is going to be when he grows up</br>  Is this the Bastard thread?  <br>That hair is the tits.</br>  <br>SAINT SEA HAT!

I'm sad this anime didn't get that popular. We could've had great douijins.    <br>It's hard to find the good ones</br>  Time to finally pick this up.

They'll yank down his pants and each take turns giving him a blowjob, trying to be quiet as possible. The girls will draw straws to see who gets to start. He has 1 guess each time a new mouth takes its turn, and the first girl to be correctly guessed gets to take his virginity.<br><br>Of course, Iida and Gonou sensei will walk in on the whole thing and for reasons decide to take part.</br></br>  <br>Her insert song was based.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dmn<wbr>yz0wOLsU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Perfect breeding material right there.

I'm expecting trains, i even thought I can watch this with my vehicle-loving toddler nieces. Good god I didn't do that...</br>  The show was shit. But what I wouldn't give to fuck the shit out of Aoi.  how did this end?, i can't remember  <br>He fucked all the bitches and everyone got pregnant.</br>      Did MC's boss want his dick as well?  <br>Of course</br>  poor vestbro<br><br>he never scored</br></br>  Reverse trap needs more love  <br>Neither did the MC, despite the fact that pussy was being thrown at him left and right.</br>  AOI BEST GIRL  My three favorite things; trains, ass, and tits  <br>Don't bother. Just watch the compilation vid on fapservice.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fqc<wbr>7relf_IE</wbr>  [ ]<br>lol</br>  <br>Japan entrusts guns to teenagers now?</br>  I don't really think Aoi's that sexy. It's a shame she's the main girl. All the other girls are sexier.  Wasn't the chick with the long, light brown/pinkish hair a nutjob or was that just funposting?  <br>Only when they learn to draw them correctly and keep the same model.</br>    <br>One of the more epic scenes in anime history was watching 2 of the, erm, "females" activate the "D-unit" on the support vehicle.<br>Oh yeah, don't forget the parking snafu @ the main depot LOL.</br></br>  <br><br>I love it when official art is so fapworthy</br></br>  <br>Appalling trigger discipline.</br>  <br>That fucking shit trigger discipline.</br>  <br> This whole post </br>    <br><br>OP picture is way worse on safety to the point it actually bothers me.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I didn't even notice the gun in OP till you said something.</br>  <br>u wot</br>  Fuck, now I want to re-watch this shit.<br>Please stop me, I do remember how shitty it was.</br>  <br>Listen to your dick, anon.</br>  <br>I won't stop you</br>  <br><br> "I can warm her up for you if you want, Anon-kun..." <br> "D-don't do that..." </br></br></br>  <br>Exept for the left grill's foot... can not unsee</br>  <br><br>Im@s cameo when</br></br>  <br><br>But I'll have to watch the bomb defuse scene again!</br></br>  <br>But do you remember that episode where they thought they were being chased by assassin cats?</br>  <br>He's fine as long as he has food.</br>  <br>I'd defuse her bomb, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br><br>wait a minute, that pool</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you will have to froze her first.</br>  <br>yes, it is That Pool.</br>  <br>You should checkout those two doujins then. He scores big time.</br>  <br> This show only got 2 doujins. </br>    <br><br>Shit, I remember now.<br>Didn't Aoi point her gun at MC at some point?</br></br></br>  <br>And his patlabor vest</br>  <br>I was referring to the two vest bro doujins, there are more but they aren't really that good.</br>  <br>Something about this image is really terrifying.</br>  <br>This show really deserves good doujins.</br>  <br>Yes. Pellet gun granted but yes.</br>  <br> Pellet gun </br>  <br>No escape.</br>  <br>Airsoft whatever.</br>  <br>I'm quite sure it has her service weapon. I don't recall air guns at any moment.</br>  <br>Doesn't she fire it and just miss? I can't remember, you might be right. I thought there was an offhand line about it or something but with this show, anything's possible.</br>  <br>Now I am curious, let me check it.<br> I still have the show on my HDD </br></br>  LN translations when      I want to see Aoi brutally assfucked.  <br>its the pool from shionmeta they blew up</br>  <br>She fires at them by accident, but it isn't told if it's a real gun or not. It makes common sense for it been a BB gun, but I don't remember her carrying anything but her real gun with her.</br>  <br> It isn't told or explained  <br><br>That was basically the MO of this entire show huh. What a wonderful clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  You had one job Passione, one job.<br>http://www.youdubber.com/index.php?<wbr>video=2Jy0ocIF7QU&amp;video_start=0&amp;aud<wbr>io=pl57hN4EaLU&amp;audio_start=158</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> you came to the wrong neighborhood motherfucker </br></br>  I love how at the wiki page the summaries of the episodes suddenly stop at episode 6, it's evident that whatever editor was doing just dropped the show at that point.<br>Also:<br> The An adventure game developed by 5pb. for the PlayStation Vita has been announced. The game was due for a November 27, 2014 release, until it was delayed. </br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2014-10-24/rail-wars-ps-vita-dela<wbr>yed-until-further-notice/.80324<br> that the delay is due to "various circumstances."  <br>Right.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  So which train has  inverted nipples   <br>Inverted nipples are shit-tier because you can't play with them.</br>  <br>I like that it's the cat episode too, just "fuck it, I'm out".</br>  <br>Look at that ass.<br>Look at it.</br></br>  It's such a shame that we live in a society that sexualizes women so much. This anime had the potential to be one of my favorites (since I truly like trains and their mechanics), however, the only thing that I got out of it was boobs and fan service. I just don't get it, if they are going to be going to such extremes why not just make a hentai? That way the audience that is actually looking for a show with trains as its main focus doesnt leave disappointed.  What was the reason pink breast monster was in love with the MC again?<br><br>It was something about their childhood but I don't have the anime on my hard drive anymore.</br></br>  Jesus, this show got nendos, and 2 of them.<br>It even has the fucking bomb defuse accessories.</br>    <br>I would've paid for a scale Nana figure, honestly.</br>  <br>He rescued her after she got trapped inside an office by some boxes. Of course the dense MC won't remember it.</br>  <br>He rescued her when they kids from...getting locked in a closet, at the train museum, I think?</br>  <br>Actually I think a bunch of us picked it up because of the train, or at least because it was gonna be something interesting.<br>It ended up being interesting in many ways I wasn't expecting, sincerely I regret nothing.</br></br>  <br>She also flipped her shit just because MC went to go meet another girl at a church.<br><br>She might be crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>Also echi =! hentai</br>  <br>Yandere love is the purest anon.</br>  <br>You realize they pop out when they harden from arousal don't you anon?<br><br>Of course not, you've never touched a woman in your life.</br></br></br>  <br>He is right, though. If the elevens want to make a show fill with fan service, then make it a hentai. If they want to make a show about a specific hobby/topic, then make it with that idea as its main plot. There is no reason to intermingle those two genres, especially when one of them is Safe for work and the other isn't.</br>    <br> those eyes </br>  Are real trains this comfy?  <br>Then why does anons get mad at me when I say that "plastic nee-san" was shit because it wasn't about scale models?</br>  Which train has the best  feet?   <br> those cars </br>  <br>Sleeper rail is comfy as fuck, if it wasn't expensive I'd do it all the time.</br>  <br>Yes they also rock you to sleep and sing you a lullaby.</br>  <br>I am a Harukafag<br> without doubt Aoi </br></br>  <br>And you have? Yeah okay buddy.</br>  <br>Fun is, I'm still not sure which one is correct.</br>  <br>Just so you know, most women don't have inverted nipples. It's extremely rare.<br>I don't see how not knowing how they work means you haven't been with a woman before.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I have, touched your mom last night.</br>    <br>fucking kek</br>  I want to board this train  The arts were even more delicious  <br>She already got a ticket to Fucking Dense MC's Harem</br>  <br>Why is she wearing riot gear?</br>  <br>Can't even remember.<br>I think it was something about terrorist.</br></br>  <br><br>The LN has an actual plot and antagonists rather than just completely random, nameless dudes wanting to blow up the railway for fuck knows what reason.</br></br>  <br>Terrorists trying to board her caboose.</br>   not adorning yourself in Rail Wars goods to show your superb taste to everyone   <br>250x237<br>let me guess you are still in 199X, right?</br></br>  <br>Is this a t shirt for ants?</br>  <br><br>Only picture on the goods site.</br></br>  <br>Jesus that's a cheesy motto</br>  FUCK THIS SHIT <br>Uno Makoto was put on this Earth to fill it with the beauty of healthy shemale incest and now he's doing this train shit.<br>There is no justice in the world</br></br>  <br> not when there's a rail, there's a way <br>Oh come on.</br></br>  <br>Can't fight those trains</br>  <br>I don't think doing character designs for Rail Wars was exactly so time intensive that he's abandoned all other work or something, not exactly a long running franchise or something. Nigga took a paycheck and went on his way.</br>  <br>I did</br>  <br><br>Those are some of the most generic designs I've ever seen</br></br>  <br>That's true, but our time on the planet is limited so he really should be devoting everything he can to producing more futa doujins<br>I think it's been a couple years by now</br></br>  <br>What is you're country?</br>  <br>Fuck this show. I was sold on cattle cars rolling up next to each other, sliding open, and cops and crims giving each other fucking broadsides. I wanted a god damn war on rails, and I didn't fucking get one.</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot.</br>  <br>I didn't think a fanservice show could be bad, then I started to watch Rail Wars. <br><br>Such a shame, the characters are hot as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>For most of them yeah, but Aoi is 10/10</br>  <br>They had to delay it until they could make a sufficiently advanced ass physics engine</br>  <br>Totally not a biased statement.</br>  <br>But I think it's true. I can't recall another similar character.</br>  <br>They did?</br>  <br>Aoi is thristy as fuck right there.</br>  <br>Entire dev team too busy fapping.</br>  <br>Maybe she should have stopped for a drink before boarding the train</br>      <br><br><br>I can definitely recognize Makoto's style in this, but my heart is crushed when I realize they don't have cocks larger than their thighs</br></br></br>  <br>She's gunna have such saggy fucking tits in about 4 or 5 years.</br>  yu-gi-oh! ARC-V<br><br>ruri a worst ruri.</br></br>  YAMEROOOOOOOO  Friendship cup when so I can force everyone to be friends with cake cuties?  <br>Reminder that the only reason she's the worst is because she hasn't shown up yet and therefore has no positive qualities attached to her</br>    <br>nope, she's worst ruri because she a shit, she's Xyz scum, and she's shun's sister.</br>  Why is he so perfect?  <br>She's going to be the "bad" Ruri, which means she's the good Ruri, but since Yuzu wants to protect Yuya's EGAO Yuzu will have to become the "bad" Ruri, and Selena who was the "bad" Ruri will become the "good" Ruri, and Rin will be neither "bad" nor "good" but attack Yuya because she wants her husbando back, but Yugo was the "bad" Yuri, and Yuri is the "good" Yuto, at least he was before the Professor brainwashed him into being the "bad" Yuya<br><br>We'll have a time travel arc where Yuya and Yuzu go back in time, Yuzu helping out her incarnation who is evil and Yuya helping out his incarnation who is good<br><br>But as it turns out Yuzu is helping out Yuya's incarnation in the past and Yuya is helping out Yuzu's, their past selves were the opposite gender.<br><br>It's pretty straight-forward</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sora pls go<br><br>He's so fun to watch</br></br></br>  <br>You can't even get the title right, jesus christ OP.</br>  @monoker0s Â· 4 hours ago<br><br>Update on YGO I was sick after my trip to EVO so shit got even more delayed, I still plan to do EP065 but it will be late. posib this Friday</br></br>  I've only watched the entirety of the Duel Monsters anime, read the last few chapters in manga form.<br><br>Only caught the GX dub in passing when it was on tv (the script sounded a lot like the Abridged Series).<br><br>If one wanted to get back into YGO, which series would match the feel and tone of the Duel Monsters series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>5D's is the best post DM yugioh (aside from Arc-V but you want to watch the rest of the series before this one)</br>  <br>5D's maybe the best to start with. It has a darker tone than DM but it has all the crazy ancient civilization motif. Just so you know, card games has been combined with motor sports and alot of people find it awesome.</br>  <br>Just started 5Ds a few days ago myself, on episode 10 and I'm really enjoying it</br>  <br>Arc-V does not capture the spirit of 5Ds with the riding duels. No VROOOOOOOOOOOM inbetween plays or anything like that.<br><br>I even prefer Arc-V to 5Ds but they need to get the fuck out of Synchro Land and go back to their ninja shit</br></br></br>  <br>5Ds then Arc-V</br>  <br>What?</br>  Where do I watch/download GX with good quality?  <br>You forgot, Arc-V doesn't have based MC<br> EVERYBOODY LISTEEN </br></br>  <br>but the VROOOOOOM is shit. that's not how bikes sound like</br>  I pray everyday to Z-One in hopes Jacks gets crushed and carded for being a traitor.  <br>What asspull power does tomato have? I only watched the first episode please   spoil me </br>  <br>EGAO</br>  <br>Search GX subber on the archive.<br><br>If you have seen the first episode you already know that.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't tell him to watch Arc-V as they pretty much fucked up riding duels. If they wanted to bring back fucking card games on motorcycles, they shouldn't have done away with speed counters, speed spells, and fucking Speed World upgrade. Seriously, we could have done without Synchro being basically fucking Neo Domino. And we could have done without Jack and Crow being there.<br><br><br>Search the archive. There is a mega link to GX subs. But you can always go to NAC as well.</br></br></br></br>   RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNN   <br>But it has based Hitler.</br>  <br>The all consuming power of  Egao </br>  <br>he has EGAO mode and he invented pendulum summoning, then pendulum fusion, then pendulum Xyz.</br>  <br>Sam please stop posting.</br>  <br>Shivers</br>    <br>Have I ever told you how good it is to laugh?</br>  <br>RENKETSU DA</br>  So its going to turn out that Sam is a retard who never read the card's effect and that this card is actually awesome, and will show everyone that Jack still cares about the commons / isn't a massive dick right? cause that's the only place I can see this plot point heading  <br>Yes most Commons can't read or write, Fusions can read but can't write.</br>  <br>Sam is commons, you expect him to be able to read, look at Yugo, he can barely write.</br>  <br>Obviously<br>Yuuya's going to use it to beat Jack and then Jack will be all "it was never an insult, but a way to show a boy that big shivers come in small packages"</br></br>  <br>I presume he just wanted to give the kid some decent jerk off material<br> Has Pivix taken to the design yet? </br></br>  <br> tfw you will never have a card blessed by THE KING's seed </br>  C A R D I A N S<br>A<br>R<br>D<br>I<br>A<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you will never seen anyone on the show using a skull servant deck <br>true pain</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>God I hate Synchro Arc, Academia please arrive and kill all these stupid niggers</br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never seen anyone on the show using best cardfu and summon method, not even as cameo or plot <br>post yours</br></br>  Ipity the poor fool who gets to fight the legendary duelist of miami city,since they have no real chance of making it out alive.  <br> tfw my main deck right now just so happens to be an anime deck <br> second and third movements that summon more melodious WHEN? </br></br>    <br>has he won a single duel on his own yet?</br>  <br>When Yuzu start tuning her monsters, it should be soon.</br>  <br> Reira vs Sawatari </br>  <br>Yes ;)</br>  <br> a single solo win vs some nobody character <br>goddamn he sucks.</br></br>  <br> Infernoid <br>kek</br></br>  <br>I would pay good money to see that and love every minute of it.</br>  <br>Hey, you can't talk about Sawatari's lackey like that!</br>  <br> sawatari  <br> minute </br></br>  tfw stopped watching and forgot what episode i was on  <br> his only win is against some nobody who probably let him win </br>  <br>Obviously the one of Sora vs Shun, and if not, rewatch it again</br>  <br>People have been thinking Yuzu is "just about" to learn syncro. Its the same as when everyone kept thinking she'd learn XYZ</br>  <br>They would obviously take at least a minute to show Sawatari's face contorting in terror at the realization he is about to lose to a child.</br>  <br>I fear Yuzu won't go beyond Fusion and Pendulum at this rate. If they were going to have her Synchro, this arc would've been perfect set up to show her practicing it with Yugo before the Friendship Cup.</br>  Let'sall ENJOY<br><br>KOI KOI KOI KOI <br>KOI KOI KOI KOI</br></br></br>  <br>People have been thinking Yuzu is "just about" to learn syncro for ages*</br>  I've been watching Zexal because it's the only YGO series that I haven't seen and holy fucking shit is it awful. Yuma does something good but resets to complete idiot by the next episode. Only 2 duels have got me hype so far because the action is lacking.  Isn't Sawatari vsing Yuzu in the Friendship Cup??  <br>I guess we'll have to wait for her next duel to see:^)</br>  how do you feel about dub names?<br>rate them:<br>gongenzaka&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gong  I like it <br>yuzu hiragi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;zuzu boyle  retarded <br>kurosaki shun&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shay  could be better, could be worse <br>sawatari shingo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Silvio I like it <br>LDS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LID(leo institute of dueling) feels kinda pointless, but both names are good <br>akaba reiji&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Declan  I like it. gives a mature name that relates to english speakers. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't confirmed</br>  <br>Just a rumor.</br>  <br>lying and editing neo new sawatari's win/lose ratio is not ok anon. don't do that.</br>  <br>If she does learn it, it won't be before Yuya.<br><br>Yuya will probably use Synchro on his R1 opponent.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Reira is getting mindraped by some jean lackey<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hwN<wbr>dAXkc8Kg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>yuma's a fucking idiot that can't duel for the first couple arcs. by the finals of the heartland cup he actually learns how to play, and ZEXAL II is a lot better.<br><br><br>I think he'll use it in his rematch vs jack, and he'll use the tuner jack gave the kid. as for yuzu, I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll use pendulum synchro against Jack to go even further beyond so he needs to learn synchro sooner</br>  <br> S-She is going to learn Xyz from Shun <br> Tfw they never interacted again after episode 21 </br></br>   Yuzu <br> Dueling ever <br>lmao she's going to job first round then become yuya.wav for the rest of the series</br></br>  <br>I can see him doing some form of Synchro.v2 in his rematch vs jack. <br>And for that to happen he has to use normal Synchro before duelling Jack again. Like how Yuya used Dark Rebellion a lot before going full OERD.</br></br>  <br>he learned pendulum fusion in one duel, why not pendulum synchro?</br>  <br>God I hope not</br>  <br>You can't damage whats already broken. Reira will eye rape them in return. <br><br>Why did they give Ruka such a good theme. It's almost criminal.</br></br></br>  PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, she's been shown to be actually competent at dueling, I doubt they'd shaft her like that.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals <br>No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first. Yuzu was getting fusion lessons from Sora, and Yuya still did it first. But I dont think they'll have another of of the Lancers (who isnt a villian) besides Yuya and Reiji do multiple summoning methods<br><br><br>People overrated how many shits Shun gives about non Ruri Ruris</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first </br>  Yuya is going to  PENDULUM ACCEL SYNCHRO  during his duel against Jack  <br>I have a brother called Declan, he fucking sucks at Yugioh, we laugh about this all the time.</br>  <br> Dueling Jack again <br>It would be pointless and a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Alright, during the Fusion invasion then</br>  <br>He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him</br>  <br> He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him <br><br>Not that anon you responded to but no, Yuya doesn't "need" to beat Jack. By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito. If anything, Jack will get BTFO and carded by Yuri to hype Yuri up as being ridiculously good, only for Yuya to beat Yuri when the Lancers go to Academia. So by beating the person who carded Jack, it is kinda like defeating Jack himself. Since it would show that Yuya has surpassed Jack.<br><br>Just like how Yuya indirectly proved he was stronger than Shun by basically defeating Sora in their rematch. Then again, YGO is cliche as fuck when it comes to the protagonist losing only to win in a rematch.<br><br>Yugi's real losses were Pegasus, Kaiba (Duelist Kingdom), and Rafael in that order. Yugi beat all of them in the rematch. Judai beat Ryo and Edo in their rematches (well tied with Ryo, but Judai didn't lose), and never got to duel Kaibaman because he was filler so it didn't matter. Yusei lost to Jack (off-screen) and Kiryu but beat both of them in the rematch. Yuma beat everyone in a rematch who he lost to, except Kaito (although their last duel was the only one Yuma actually lost, even if he would have lost the first duel too).<br><br>If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch. What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gonna be curious, do you have a cosplay for your favourite monster? It could be anything, from your cardfu to an eldritch abomination, and don't say me that there can't be a cosplay for a dragon, unrelated to topic I saw a very tall man doing a perfect cosplay of Dukemon, so if that is possible then even a Stardust Dragon is too. Just don't use Dark Magician Girl, it's already too used.  <br> By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito <br>Yuma never really strongly cared about showing he was better than Kaito (he never really did actually, Kaito never lost any match without bullshit involved). He just wanted to be friends with him. Yuya and Jack is different, Jack destroyed the entertainment duel Yuya base himself around, he wants to prove it isnt just self satisfaction directly to Jack.<br><br> If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch <br>Its not really cliche so much as basic storytelling. Have the protag lose the first fight for a stated reason, set up a rematch for the future, have the protag develop in the lead up to it in response to the reason, then have him overcome his foe at the climax<br><br> What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot? <br>What point was there in Yuya fighting Jack the first time when we knew Yuya would lose because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Crow and Shinji don't join the lancers. Sure, the goal is to take allies from Synchro, but those two are boring and shitty characters.  <br>Who would join the lancers? certainly not KINGU</br>  <br>fugg meant for this </br>  <br>Unless Carly has something to do about it with the Lancers or Academia. I HOPU </br>  <br>Well it's good if you have a high level dragon... And Sam has no other cards so</br>  <br>How about no one? It would be funny to see Reiji's keikaku fail.</br>  <br>I'm guessing Yuya's new Synchro Dragon would follow the levels and naming scheme of Beast-Eyes and Rune-Eyes</br>  <br>Do you want me to give you some DMG cosplay or you prefer other ones? Because my folder only have DMG cosplay</br>  <br><br>Akababowl is NOT confirmed</br></br>  <br><br> Going into a basaka modo just to play children's card games <br><br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Better not post 3D, mods dont like it</br>  <br>Anon, she's not coming back ever...</br>  <br><br>AKABABOWL IS CONFIRMED YOU DUMB BITCH<br>GET FUCKING HYPE</br></br></br>  <br> just to play children's card games </br>  <br>They haven't really said much about Shinji besides him being Crow's friend. Mostly waiting to see where they go with him during his duel.</br>  <br>I wanna see Yusei crash the tournament with Stardust Warrior.</br>  <br><br> Not going BASAKA SOUL MODO to play cardgames <br><br>What's even the point of playing cardgames if you don't do that?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-9N<wbr>BvsmQ2Ik</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SHUT UP I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN<br>They know that people are still with a scar in the heart after the fiasco with Jack and Carly so I know they will fix it.</br></br>  When is this glorious bastard coming back?  <br><br>I require Kotori coplay</br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PHM<wbr>EW_hbjsA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>clear wing? soon as yugo duels again.</br>  <br>That's a really cute cosplay, not a monster, but still a cute coslay.</br>  At least the show is self-aware.  <br> tumblr for ants <br><br>FAGGOT</br></br></br>  <br> Vector <br> Not Rei Saotome <br>The artist blew it.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't this the filler with the red demon noodles and shit?</br>  Will Gongenzaka and Tsukikage lose to Crow and Shinji?<br><br>I don't want Crow to win.. I don't want to buy Blackwings..</br></br>  <br>It's amazing what make-up, the right lighting, and photoshop can do.</br>  <br> He doesn't want to buy Blackwings </br>  <br><br>Both Arc-V and 5Ds are good points to start. If you only want to watch one series go Arc-V because you'll be able to speculate with us. If you feel like you want to get full back into it start with 5Ds. Arc-V has a lot of callbacks to 5Ds</br></br>  <br><br> Arc-V doesn't have MC <br> implying <br> M  elissa  C laire </br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei Shingetsu <br><br>It works, but other Rei would have been better, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't as based as 5D's MC</br>  <br><br>I'm a complete fucking retard. How have I not noticed that</br></br>  <br><br>She is a whole lot sexier though</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Yusei didn't BECOME Stardust Warrior </br></br>  <br>I'm dropping ARC-V if Gongenzaka loses to Crow.</br>  So Jack's deck still doesn't have any reason or thought put into it. It's still random monsters and Resonators to make Red Demons Dragon  <br>He runs a lot of fiends</br>  <br><br>Lol <br>Bye</br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be absolutely retarded if Crow lost to Gon</br></br>  <br>On your way out remember to  BUY BLACKWINGS </br>   yfw Crow wins every duel and the final duel is Crow vs Jack     Crow is cool! COOL!  <br>How so? All the monsters in his deck so far are of the Red archetype and Crimson Blader</br>  BUY BLACKWINGS<br><br>KOI KOI<br><br>KOI KOI</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think "Red" is really an archetype. Unless Red Eyes is a sub archetype of it</br></br>  <br>It's probably going to be Red Demons archetype</br>  <br><br>KOI KOI KOI</br></br>  <br>Why am I reminded of Weevil?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br> yugo absorbs yuya and synchro characters replace 5d's cast </br>  <br><br>First episode whete he creates pendulums.<br>Then standard MC power to create extra deck boss monsters<br><br>Aside from that he can go berserker mode but it doesn't really make him more powerful. Rather it makes him go into a very primal state where he only does basic and rudimentary plays with no combos whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  What did Jack the savior do right?  <br>Will Jack be able to have his waifu this time around?</br>  <br><br> Even if Carly returned she would have a different VA <br><br>She's an ugly nerd anyway.

Special summon Hat Trick. Oh man that was hard</br>  I miss the days when we all just shipped Yuzu with tsundere brown girls...  <br>Gaia and Buster were never explained. The new BLS stuff implies that Gaia becomes BLS, but that's clearly a retcon.<br><br>The Silent monsters were basically Yugi's soul in Card form, Black Luster Soldier was Atem's Ka or whatever, Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl were the creepy old visier and his loli pupil. Buster Blader just showed up one day with a resume written in crayon that reads "Me kill dragons dead", and got hired on the spot.</br></br></br>  <br>BLS is Gaia who charged into a path of chaos created by light and darkness or w/e, that's how it was in the manga</br>  <br>Gem knights sucks.</br>  <br>Gishki Emilia.

I usually absolutely detest this kind of stupid character, but with him I just can't resist.
