She saw first hand how much trouble that type of parenting can cause.

Why do you think many abused children become abusing parents when they grow up?</br></br></br>  <br>Except once she becomes genuine she can change that, she's not going to be fully Ice Queen like Yukimom anymore.</br>  <br>I just went through every thread after the finale aired.

Right now he's just enabling her.  <br>Tsun as fuck</br>  <br>As the anons suspected, cancerous threads would continue to baffle the medical community for years to come.

She's a masochist.<br><br>She has no brain.

You doesn't fit in the house and you can't even give her a  full body hug  or  make love  while looking into eachothers eyes.</br>  <br>Let her tenderly dominate you. As you lie in your bed, tied down and unable to move, let her overwhelm you with her love and wipe your tears away.</br>  <br> Not doing couples yoga with your centaurfu to do all of the above. </br>  <br>Ask her to blindfold you.</br>   manga about monster girls <br> some people think Ms. Smith is the best girl <br>Why</br></br>  <br>fap to spiders every day</br>  Friendly reminder: Suu is, without a doubt, the best girl  <br>There are those among us who believe her to be a Succubus.</br>  <br>plebs gonna pleb</br>  <br>get over it with counseling or something <br>that's what i did with Miia and snakes and she's been my waifu for 3 years now</br></br>  <br>The same folks who go to Baskin' Robbins, ask to use their restroom, then drink from the tap.</br>  <br><br>Mizore shiriyuki is the best monster girl ever created. <br>This one does not hold an icicle to mizore.</br></br></br>  And normally I hate anime openings.  <br>How can anyone be afraid of snakes? Spiders I can understand because of how absolutely alien looking they are. But snakes are just these big soft squirmy guys with big kawaii eyes who you can wrap around your arms and have big snakey fun time. The only way you could make snakes better is if you added cute girls, which are why Lamias a best and Miia is best girl.<br><br>Then again I'm terrified of beetles and beetles alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Legs and now ass.</br>  <br>For me it's the endings, but this time the anime was sold on me at the end</br>  <br>I love suu's opening appearance.<br><br>I seriously want to fuck a slime though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's how I've learned to see them, but i had a bad experience with one when i was a kid where one bit me and scared the fuck out of me, made me really spooked of them for a long ass time <br><br>which is strange because i've been bit by a lot of things since i worked with animals a lot growing up, and the snake was the only thing that really stuck with me</br></br></br>  <br> Then again I'm terrified of beetles and beetles alone. <br>But they make the best heroes.</br></br>  So what do you do if you're with her and this happens to you on the job ?  <br>They clearly made her hips and thighs wider in the anime design.  No complaints here. </br>  So I'm really not a fan of harem anime in general, mostly because I hate the concept of love triangles or characters "competing" for someone's affections. I love me some MonsterGirls and cheesey romance, though. Would I like MonMusu or would it just piss me off? I know the obvious "Watch it yourself, faggot" but I hate only watching part of a series.  <br><br>She may not be entirely Human as far as we're aware or its just assumed that she Human.</br></br>  <br>She's a gag character, so no matter how many bones she breaks while falling on top of you, you're guaranteed to be completely healthy by the next frame save for a few bandages.</br>  <br>The MC has seven girls living under his roof, competing for him. If this idea puts you off, then it puts you off. I don't really care, because they play off of each other well.</br>  <br>I don't.<br><br>I want to cum inside her arachnid pussy and have arachnid babies with her.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the question is more "Is the MC waffling about between girls or is it apparent which girl he likes/is going to win?"</br>  <br>The series will either end without any conclusion, or then the first girl will win. That's how these things work.</br>  <br>slime &gt; snake &gt; bird &gt; all else</br>  <br>Friendly reminder than Miia is still very much in first place in the darlingbowl<br><br>Even if she's not best girl</br></br></br>  Keep the subhumans for yourselves while I impregnate Smith.  <br><br>What if that had happened to Manako ?</br></br>  <br>Two sides of the same coin.</br>  <br><br>Are there going to be BD nipples?</br></br>  <br>Fear boner best boner.</br>  <br><br>Miia being the adorable snakegirl, right? Alright, I'll give this a shot then. Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br>Maybe humans are the real monsters.</br>  <br>deepestlore.webm</br>  <br>This<br> was first girl, so automatic harem advantage <br> Papi and Mero are no competition, Suu isnt really either since she would just do what anyone in particular wants. Meaning her competition is horse pussy, femdom spider, and dullahan of no screen time. <br> Darling communicated with her mom the most, as the other moms were pretty focused on their child, not on Darling <br> Being an all-female species, is most suited for human shlonging </br></br></br></br></br>  Finally watched the first episode<br><br>I forgot Lerche was so good at animation. No wonder you guys were so hyped at the announcement. They should do more stuff.  Lerche Fate adaptation when? <br><br>Not a huge fan of the OP, but I like that the girls sing different lines. Good episode. Great ED.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Miia is the silly snake.

That is probably part of her spider anatomy.</br>  <br>In MonMusu, there are some males depicted (male orcs come to mind), as well as implicit males of species with only female depictions (like how everyone assumed Lizard Lesbo was a boy).</br>  <br>Don't worry, it's a very dull edge by now.</br>  <br>I just feel like Rachnee showed up way too late in the game and hasnt gotten nearly as much screentime as the earlier girls, I mean she will probably get more time later, but poor lala needs to at least show up somewhere.</br>  <br>Some female lizards in the animal kingdom can have children without a male.<br>They basically function as a genetic clone of the mother.</br></br>   I like spiders   Episode 1 did a much better job of showing the monster half of miia than the manga did.<br><br>When the yankiis were laughing at her a second time she began to hiss and bare her teeth and shit, it may have been overshadowed by darlings touma punch, but I like the animal side of miia as much as her deredere human side.<br><br>I'm still a slime fan though, so hopefully they handle kaiju suu and poison suu equally well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think there's a type of lizard that can reproduce asexually. The mother just produces a clone of herself. But there are males as well, and they can also reproduce heterosexually if they find one.<br><br>I think?

Hang from the ceiling? AWKWARD in any case.</br>  <br>Note that while they have many eyes, they are nto compound eyes<br>I'm stupid, so what does this mean?</br></br>  <br>Have we seen Cerea with her hair down? <br><br>Should be cute as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>  Spider <br>  Not cuddly at all <br><br>you lack imagination</br></br></br></br>  <br>I totally can imagine cuddling with a cage of cold chitin. I can even see comfort in that.<br>Still isn't as comfy as being covered by warm feathers or being completely engulfed in a snek.</br></br>  <br>A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular). The image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual "eye units"), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions. Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large view angle, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light. Because the individual lenses are so small, the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming that they do not function as phased arrays). This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number. To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around 11 m in radius.</br>  <br> Still isn't as comfy as being covered by warm feathers or being completely engulfed in a snek. <br><br>I have to agree with that</br></br></br>  Now that the anime started airing<br><br> NTR doujins when? </br></br>    <br> To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around 11 m in radius. <br>..FUCKING HELL.<br><br>So it's basically saying that Rachnee has simple eyes, like humans do. Still, it's hard to imagine what the world looks like if you have six eyes. Assuming all of her eyes are fully functional.<br><br> If her eyes aren't compound, why doesn't she have pupils? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long does it take to make one</br>    <br>She's more reverse-NTR</br>  <br>We already have a rape doujin with Papi getting fucked by some random gonky fat fucker.</br>  <br>Literally can't miss anything in front of you</br>  <br>Considering she doesn't wear any covers for her human behind, I doubt that it's there.<br>Also, normal spider physiology has the major part of their digestive track in their large hind section. with the anus located close to the spinneret.</br></br>  <br> spider legs work by essentially bio hydraulics <br> only works because they're small <br> Rachnee is fucking huge <br><br>How does she move?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm waiting for something where Cerea gets fucked by supreme centaur dick, and Mia sluts it up heavily, only thing I have now is that one centaur from Ahobaka, but that's getting boring </br>  <br>What the fuck is this</br>  What's so important about moisturizing your tail anyway when she's just going to shed it later?

Her upper half is mostly human, and she has two big fat warm tits to bury your face in.</br>  <br>Still won't be as tight, still would be wobbly and won't feel like flesh. I mean yeah you can fuck a blob everywhere, but it still will feel like a blob. No bones to grab onto, no flesh to redden with your slaps. Hence the limited rating and arguable cuddliness.</br>  <br>It's anime physics, I don't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>You're right, the poll should be held later on.</br>  Are we all in agreement that if the girls were humanoid they'd be arguably hotter?  <br>Why would I care what animeonly fags with shit taste think<br>Miia's been my waifu for 3 years and I've had basically every argument you can have with horse and spiderfags<br>We've all been getting ready for this<br>Those faggots can suck our dicks</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> all in agreement <br> arguably <br>If everyone is in agreement than it isn't arguable.</br></br></br>  <br>Japan having good taste for once</br>  <br>Grab a bunch of plastic tubes, heat them a bit over the oven and try cuddling with them.

I could have sworn she did the super-low almost belly-crawling slither during Papi's intro chapter, but can't find it.</br>  <br>It's the torso you want the warmth from, the arms and legs are just for security. Her torso is warm so there's no problem. And do we know if her arm chitin is even cold? Considering it's just a covering and directly connected to her human upper arms, they might be warm.</br>  Why haven't you watched this SOL masterpiece yet, /a/?<br><br>Anyways I'm pretty sure we're supposed to have Yuyushiki threads on Tuesday</br></br>  <br>I watched it when it came out and I didn't like it</br>  I only watch shows that get two seasons or more, so I will never watch Yuyushiki.  One day we'll have YYS S2. I'm sure of it  The best day of the week.   Kinema Citrus does Gochiusa S2 instead of Yuyushiki S2 <br>It's ogre, guys.

And we all watched it together laughing and crying with the girls who brought such joy into our lives.  Truly the best week of the day.  <br>Congratulations, parallel universe inhabitants!</br>  <br><br>Even though there are infinite parallel universes, in literally every single one all Yuyus are equally best,  but Yukari is simply more equallier bestieriestererererererererererer.

Yes  <br> 5'7'' <br>It's actually the average height of a Japanese male, so taller than average, yes. actually in the 90th percentile of women's height, assuming Japan has the same height standard deviation as everywhere else. So yes, unusually tall.<br><br>But notably: not so tall she'll likely be taller than him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was fairly disappointed that Rider was only 172. I want my waifu to be a head taller than me.</br>  <br>Are you similar to Vegeta?</br>  <br> O-Of course, it is. </br>  <br>To the Japanese, yes. Globally? No.</br>  <br>It is more than every country average except maybe germany or northern europe<br>In japan the average height for women is about 157cm IIRC, so yeah 172cm is quite tall</br></br>  <br> Globally? No. <br>Men rarely reach 170cm in some parts of this world, m8. Even in Europe 172cm is above average for females.</br></br>  <br> so yeah that's pretty tall for a woman, especially in Japan. <br>But isnt she Medusa or w/e?<br>She's not from Japan.<br>Gorgon sisters came from Greece.<br> Nasu a shit </br></br></br></br></br>   172cm to Japs is tall   <br>i thought the average male height in japan was around 5'10"</br>  <br>average women height here in netherlands<br><br>I'd kill for rider to be like 180cm here</br></br></br>  <br>It kinda is for women.</br>  Im 21 cm taller than her, Rider a cutest.  <br>It's not THAT tall. Even in Japan no one would call her a freak.<br>A complex doesn't have to be reasonable though</br></br>   she's 2 cms taller than me   Maybe she was tall in her time?  <br>It's actually around 175cm(5'8" i think).</br>  <br>That's my height so I'm good.</br>  <br>It's not even 2 fucking inches above average. By that logic I'm tall and that's just fucking stupid.</br>  <br> 172 <br>I wasn't aware of this. Rider truly is the best girl. My dick is diamonds when I see any girl that is taller than me (182cm), which is something anime rarely panders to. Even when they have tall girl characters, they're normally around 175cm.</br></br>  <br>same here, bueno.jpg</br>  <br>It's actually 171cm. Or at most 172cm.</br>  <br>hhhnnnggg, who is she</br>  <br>Uh, no. It's 170cm (5'7").</br>  <br>Nope. I'm 185cm tall so she would seem short to me.</br>  <br>Some original tall girl character by wokada.</br>  <br>What? No, it's 165cm (4'9" or so).</br>  <br>172 is tall for a woman, and humongous for an asian woman. Fuck off manlets for disliking women that are taller than you.</br>  <br>This is the reason why you are not cute.</br>  <br><br>Nah, Nips are definitely taller than that nowadays. 180cm+ is still a rare sight but 175-180 is not uncommon at all.</br></br>  <br>That's the average height of a gorilla too</br>  <br>+/- 10cm isn't really rare.</br>  <br>I'm 1.70 and thought I would fit right in the average in japan, dont fucking take this from me anon</br>  <br> average women height here in netherlands <br><br>Then I'll move there to meet taller than average women</br></br></br>  <br>tfw 165cm x 65kg<br><br>I'd really like to have a taller woman, I'm just sure no woman would date a guy shorter than her<br><br>Medusa was so cute that moralfag goddess of politically correct got butthurt and fucked her dna because was jelly.</br></br></br></br></br>  Even if she's average height, she's not short and therefore not "cute".<br><br><br> but she's from ancient greece, not japan <br> ancient <br>Average heights might have been lower back then because diet etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Olden times didn't have very good nutritional standards, so most peasants grew up to be manlets.</br>  <br> Nips are definitely taller than that nowadays. <br>No they aren't. from personal experience, I don't remember seeing anyone taller than 170 cm walking on the street</br></br>  <br>People used to be shorter.</br>  <br>She wears heels so she'll probably reach 180. Which is kind of funny considering her insecurity</br>  <br>I think you're just too tall so they all look short to you.</br>  <br>It's 139cm, actually.</br>  how do i fug rider?  <br>Only where people relied on farming. Vikings were tall because of shit soil/ability. Later scandis were fucking midgets because they started relying on their shitty soil and abilities. Now they're tall again.</br>  The way they're drawn and the numbers Nasu uses are a little conflicted. This goes for heights, weights, and three sizes.<br>Sakura's bust is nowhere near as large as it should be statistically, Shirou's practically made of styrofoam for how light he is in contrast to his musculature, and so on.</br>  <br>I'm 165cm.</br>  <br><br> 2014 October 12th, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology released the 2013 data of people's body measurements.

They're always the most fun part of whatever show they appear in.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>There is a lot of GER power scale arguments, but outside of Giorno's plot armor stand, is there any stand that could possibly defeat the green baby realistically?<br><br>Anyone or anything that gets close just stays the same distance as they approach it getting smaller until they are erased at the zero point. <br><br>C-moon seems light a complete downgrade from Green Grass of home.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the effect work in stopped time?</br>  <br>Anything that doesn't require physical contact could defeat him. Green Day, Grateful Dead, probably Hanged man, Heavy Weather, Highway to Hell, Jail House Rock, Doobie Wah. <br>It's a purely defensive stand, but it's defense has a lot of holes. C-Moon at least has some offensive capabilities.</br></br>  stroheim is best brojo  <br> green day <br>Mold still has to reach him. the altitude is just where it spreads, but it'd never reach him.<br><br> Grateful dead <br>Is the baby a vampire, a tree, or human? how would that even work on him? It looks like the stand only works on humans.<br><br> hanged man <br>light still would have to travel to get to the baby. It'd hit zero. <br><br> Heavy Weather <br>This might work with the Oxygen. but rain, lightening, and poison frogs would all hit the zero point.<br><br> Highway to hell <br>does he have to make contact or does he just have to look at someone to infect them with it? If its just sight, then yeah that would work.<br><br> jail house rock <br>That has to make contact. Zero point. And even still, what is memory loss gonna do to him?<br><br> doobie wah <br>tornado and stand would shrink and hit the zero point.<br><br> purely defensive <br>If the baby had the will, he could just run at people until they shrink to be killed by large things or until they reach the zero point. <br><br><br>Well its a constant effect, and like magnet fields, those work during time stop. So SP and World would still shrink and hit zero if they moved towards the baby in time stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>D4C: Love Train?</br>  <br>That's also a definsive stand. The only offense it has is redirecting "bad" things, which would not be able to hit the baby, so no.</br>  <br>Then my only option left is Cream since it goes in a different dimension when it erases matter. GGGOH is quite the defesnsive Stand.</br>  <br> Green Day <br>The mold would just spring out of the baby as soon as he crawled downhill, it never has to approach the baby. <br><br> Hanged man <br>In order to teleport into the baby's eye, yes the light would need to hit it. But I'm pretty sure that in order to attack from a mirror no light needs to touch the baby.<br><br> Bites the Dust <br>I just thought of this, which would work to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't know why they didn't give pucci and the baby a GHA in ASB before he finished saying the heaven chant it totally could have worked if each of his stands had an individual HHA and GHA<br><br> whitesnake <br>HHA: disk steal<br>GHA: throws you at the baby, you shrink, and then green grass of home would fuck your tiny shit<br><br> C-moon <br> HHA: have pucci step on a wall or girder sticking out of the ground or something and shift the gravity and then a fuckton of projectiles fly at the enemy <br> GHA: Time for Heaven <br><br> Made in Heaven <br>HHA: speeds up time even more, making the enemy slower than even before<br><br>GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Supers for Made In Heaven <br>Absolutely not. The slowdown effect is just enough to wail down on your opponent.</br></br>  <br> GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars. <br>never design a fighting game</br></br>  <br><br>If your opponent was stupid or bad enough to allow you to reach Heaven then that should be enough. The slowdown and easy timeout win is like adding salt to the wound. Story as Jolyne was pretty fun when you try to cheese Pucci as much as possible at that point. Playing as Pucci was ridiculous</br></br>  <br>Fuugo Stand.</br>  Risotto can beat it since he can turn the iron in its body without touching it from a distance of 10m.<br>Weather report can too since the slug power is nothing but an illusion.</br>  <br>Imagine if GGGOH was the stand of a grown person. Its be the most danger offensive stand as simply running at you enemy would kill them by bringing the zero point to them.</br>  <br> risotto <br>10 meters, which means he'd have to get in range, and he'd shrink getting in range and never actually get in range by the halved distance. Also the baby is a plant, so no iron in it like a human. So he'd have to attack it with outside iron. And bringing anything into GGGOH range will hit zero point before it can harm it.<br><br> Weather  <br>Slug power only affects animals, baby is a tree. And even if it did, that wouldn't kill the baby, it would just make it a slug. And the slug eaters that try and get it would all hit Zero in its range. But it's oxygen in a closed room could possibly kill it. <br><br><br>Purple haze's range is too short to be able to punch it. And even at night with no sunlight to stop it and the wind carrying it towards the baby, the virus would shrink and hit zero before making contact with the baby.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its not necessary touch the baby, just puch a rock or the earth for active the virus. Abouth the virus, little or big objective is not great difference.</br>  It just hit me that Green Baby's design is actually really cool. I wish we had seen it grown up.  <br>Pretty sure you can get 10m distant from him without being shrank at all. Also plants do have iron in them.</br>  <br>Nero definitely could get in range, he'd just be tiny. I don't think ten meters was anywhere near the "zero point" you keep talking about, Jolyne and Anasui got closer than that.<br><br>And plants do have iron you dumbass, ever heard of spinach?</br></br></br>  <br>But the virus hit zero before it touches the baby.</br>  I can't tell what's happening in this comic.  <br>madoka and madoka2 gets killed by made in heaven</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51300492<br><br>Just read the whole thing. I think I'm missing something because I never watched the show.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I watched the show too and I still have no idea what's going on<br><br>also I can't speak moon</br></br></br>  <br>Because you don't need them? Whitesnake and C-Moon are strong enough without them and if you manage to get to heaven and lose somehow, it's your fault.</br>  Why was white snake able to fuck up Annasui and FF so fast?  <br>Because Araki wanted Pucci to achieve Heaven.</br>  <br>He got the drop on them.</br>  <br>Fate.</br>  <br>Bohemian rhapsody and underworld</br>  <br><br>Tusk IV probably could hurt the babby since the spin will always exists ( like it exists beyond dimensional walls or stopped time ). <br>Maybe it could reach the baby, considering it is a rather OP stand.<br><br>The Sun probably could defeat the baby.<br><br>Rolling Stones. If the Stone starts to roll at the Green Baby, it would be never be able to reach it, thus breaking and damning the Baby to die a horrible death?<br><br>Death 13 might be able to, depends if Green Baby sleeps. Probably not.<br><br>Bites the Dust might work, but it might not trigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about Tusk act 4. Thing's unstoppable because it transcends gravity.</br>  <br>king crimson might work since things stop happing to it during skipped time, see how he got out of this despite being in the process of getting punched and the bullets with rissoto</br>  <br>Which of the gravity based stands is the strongest? There's surpringly a lot of them however c-moon is usually the one I think of the most.</br>   rereading part 6 <br> this appears <br>Really araki? Pretty sure 90% of part 6 stands would whoop Star Platinum's ass</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's hyperbole.</br>  <br>Things don't stop happening during KC ability,they do happen but a considerably slower speed than KC. Remember the blood drop thing?</br>  Could Green Baby kill Demonbane  <br>even some of the part 3 and 5 stands could have beaten top form jotaro</br>  <br> the fucking meat rat. </br>  <br>What I meant was things can't harm kc but kc can harm other things. When he was getting hit he should have had something like when jotaro punches dio during stopped time since everything is still moving. However kc the hit continues and kc moves past it despite him being hit prior to skipping.</br>  <br>It wasn't really strong,it's just jotaro being retarded.<br> oh look its stand is shooting something <br> better catch the bullet mid air oh wow I'm so cool right </br></br></br>  <br>Bruno's punch just made contact, Diavolo used KC ability and in that moment Bruno's punch became considerably slower letting KC avoid it.</br>  <br>I want to argue but you're right. Fuckin' Jotaro</br>  <br>btw, is there some translation for jojo-a-go-go!?</br>  <br>blood drop works because KC keeps inertia and movement working, but nothing else<br><br>blood flow still happens, but you can't get harmed because bullshit stand rules</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eUX<wbr>nBG9nYvA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The concept of Joseph not being able to get a date is vastly amusing</br></br>  <br>I always just remember it by "time skips for everyone else BUT Diavolo". <br>Things happen, people will perform actions like eating pastry, but they will not remember it, just notice the time skip occasionally.</br></br>  Soon.  Cardfight Vanguard is better.<br><br>Fuck Yu-Gi-Oh!</br></br>  YUZUUUUUUU!!  <br><br>I don't even know what that is lmao</br></br>   tfw no Yuuya of my own   <br>Dunno, sounds like shit</br>  <br> Yuya needs some emotional support and moral compass <br>It'd probably be more interesting if he lost one of his big supports and had to work through his issues by himself</br></br>  TEFUDA SUBETE CARDO SETTE<br>TAN ENDO</br>  What if it's Yuya v. Yuzu in the Friendship Cup finals?  <br><br>Also Gon losing a duel doesn't stop him from being Yuya's emotional support. In fact it will land him straight in the audience bench to cheer on for Yuya</br></br>  <br>NO MATTER WHAT</br>  What's stopping Yuya and Yuzu from meeting up in 66?<br>Why won't Yugo get ported away from the friendship cup?</br>  <br>The whole point of his character right now is that he can't. he's already damaged by losing Yuzu, if he lost Gon too, I bet he'd slip into permanent edge mode.<br><br><br>i wonder what happens to the losers.. If it's some horrible thing the name of the tournament would be even more ironic than it is now. But an horrible penalty would serve to deter commons from entering the tournament while still being technically open to them, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that fate of the losers will totally land him on an audience bench.</br>  <br>Was it really Clear Wing that caused Yugo to teleportal the first time? <br>Not some bullshit involving Ruri's and rings and Yu's? Or do the Dragons have some connection to the mix too?</br></br>  <br>I don't disagree with that, I just responded to the anon who said that Gon has no role whatsoever in the story.</br>  <br>Can't be, because we have to save that for the final duel,Yuzu vs. Supreme King Yuya.</br>  TUNER MONSTA HARISEN TOKUSHUSHOKAN!  <br>Maybe the fate of the losers is landing in the audience bench   which is otherwise populated entirely by shiberu clones  </br>  <br>Dennis Rurinapping her and Serena.</br>  <br>Being Yugo in this passed episode must have been suffering.</br>  So are we getting an opening update this week?<br><br>All the scenes at the end right before Jack summons RDASR are outdated and have been for a while now</br></br>  How would you rank the Lancers in terms of 'power levels'?<br>I'd think the top three would probably be EGAOmode Yuya, Reiji, then possibly Shun.</br>  <br>Having bombshell grills that clearly resemble your waifu walking around your house in sweat shorts does sound like suffering to me.</br>  Why does Zexal have the best Sound Duels?<br><br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>akjmb_yu-gi-oh-zexal-sound-duel-5-t<wbr>he-fight-isn-t-over-d2-t3_travel</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Maybe Serena's bracelet will counteract that somehow?

When was the last time she could comfortably pull out her harisen?</br>  <br> I should ass <br> Yuya will more duels <br>You wrote that really fast, huh?</br></br></br>  <br>Selena won every duel she`s been with only a tenth of her deck and the fact they`re from fusion dimension aka dimension where everybody is trained to be a duel warrior should rank them pretty high</br>  <br>I like both.</br>   Autists do power levels for fucking YGO of all things.   <br>Yep, I did.

Can bystanders get caught in duels between two people?  <br>I don't know what those are.</br>  <br> Can bystanders get caught in duels between two people? <br>There was visible shockwaves when Yuto dueled Sawatari</br></br>  <br>There was a image of his face replacing Sephiron's face but I can't find it</br>  <br>About how I felt when Kagemaru hijacked the Phantom Demons and went full Zyzz.</br>  <br>Well the shockwaves from outside of Standard do cause real damage, so I guess with good reason.<br><br>More importantly, why don't the Lancers do insane damage while in Synchroverse anyway? Was that shit ever explained?</br></br></br>  <br>Favorite YGO villain ever. He did it all for them gains.</br>  <br><br>Yuto is just a chuuni beta</br></br>  <br>Shun still does it but I don't know about everyone else</br>  <br>It's not like the damage from action fields has ever been consistent. But Reiji probably lowered the intensity of the lancer dueldisks compared to Yuto's original settings   At least until they get to Academia, hopefully  </br>  <br>Shun is still using his original disk no?</br>  <br>Well in the last episode when Rise Falcon DESTROYED the Elite Prison Guard they got sent flying at least 15 meters back out of the tunnel through the shockwave.<br><br>I think this is mostly an Xyz &amp; Fusion thing, something Standard Duelists don't naturally have.<br><br><br>He honestly did. Like there was no greater goal he had in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone is.</br>  <br>He launched three dudes out of a tunnel at least a hundred feet long. There is a very firm possibility they're all dead.</br>  <br>I thought everyone but Shun and Selena had their disks modified or replaced to generate action fields and travel across dimensions.</br>  Why do Shun and Yuto refer to their fellows as 'comrades'? Yugioh has been pretty persistent with everybody being 'friends' up until now.  Will we see Reiji vs Jack? I seriously can't think of who would win.  <br>Well yeah. You think Reiji of all people took out the ability for them to create real shockwaves when they are about to fight in a war?</br>  <br>I don't think it's a thing about the duelists themselves, but the dueldisks. Like, the XYZ and Fusion disks are intended to be war weapons, while the Standard ones are simply portable action field generators that are no more dangerous than a Standard action field.<br><br><br>W A R M O T I F S<br>W<br><br>A<br><br>R<br><br>M<br><br>O<br><br>T<br><br>I<br><br>F<br><br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You thought Heartland was in Japan? <br>Nope, turns out it's been in Russia this whole time.</br></br>  <br>Because they are in war.</br>  <br> Reiji and Jack repelling the invasion together <br>I need to see this happen</br></br>  <br>Well Reiji beat Yuya, and Yuya beat Jack, so what do you think?</br>  <br>Kek, Jack is actually  in league with Academia. <br>Remember that  he uses Fusion. </br></br>  <br> Yuya beat Jack <br>I know it'll happen, I still don't want it to</br></br>  <br> &gt;Yuya beat Jack <br><br>We have literally zero evidence this happens.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I'm sorry, where are you from, two weeks ago?</br>  <br> &gt;yfw he plays Multiple Piece Golem and pulls off a vectorface </br>   Yuya beating Jack because of Egao no Sekai   <br> le 9gag face </br>  <br>Red Demons actually ties with Odd Rebellion pretty squarely. <br> Yuya goes Egaomode 3, destroys Jack, Yugo has to duel him back into submission, consequently gets absorbed </br></br>  <br>It's been eight years, rage faces are now ebin retro now. That's eighty years in Internet time.</br>  How do you convince the strongest duelist in the universe to join your Fusion-fighting club? <br>Beat him in a duel.<br>I think Yuya has a vague chance.</br></br>  <br>Don't the summaries actually point to Yuya losing against Jack, or are ya'll talking about the potential rematch?</br>  <br> Le meme face </br>  <br>Potential rematch,  which I hope is interrupted by the invasion </br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote.</br>  <br>Whatever m8 you gonna guard or nah?</br>  <br>But Fusion are too busy invading Standard to invade Synchro.</br>  <br> eighty years in Internet time <br>What?</br></br>  <br>There aren't any Ruri's there.</br>  I want Shun to fuck me!  <br>Be careful what you wish for.

Yes, I said more! Bring me more pictures of C2!  When you say CC's name in your head, do you pronounce it as Shi Tsu or See Tu?  <br>Ask, and anon shall deliver.</br>  Oh, so they never fucked? Then why is he grabbing her ass on the promo pics and why does she look like she needs his D to survive? <br><br>Is it all just shitty fanservice or something? Wait, didn't Karen want to fuck him too? Did the tripfag name himself Lelouch because Lelouch is a literal faggot?</br></br>  <br>See See</br>  <br><br>Shi Tu<br><br> I know her real name though. I also have seen parts of her you haven't </br></br></br></br>  Say "Ahh~" Anon-kun  <br>Stop posting, Ruru.</br>  <br>Lelouch had more important things to worry about than sex.<br><br>And C.C. had fucked so much she probably didn't even care about it anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't listen to the Kallencucks. They confirmed for fuck buddies. Lelouch even brags to Mao about how he's seen parts of her he has never seen. He also knows her real name, that nobody knows, and they have a literal mind-body link connection that might as well be something more than vaginal sex anyway.</br></br>  Does C.C. do anything in the show? I watched the whole thing and outside of her eating pizza she's the most forgettable character outside of the Mao arc.  <br><br>Ahh~</br></br>  <br><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br>  <br> Lelouch even brags to Mao about how he's seen parts of her he has never seen.  <br><br>He was trying to get his goat and upset him. Mao fucked CC more times than Lelouch ever did. Heck, CC was probably molesting Mao ever since he was a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Does saving lelouch's life numerous times count as doing anything?</br>  <br>excuse me gentleman but how is this tail attached to her ass?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts?</br>  <br> le dead sister face </br>  <br>Oh silly anon, you know how.</br>  does geass work on animals?  <br><br> This obvious Kallencuck bait </br></br>   Akito Exiled episode 3 is out and subbed for about a week now <br> haven't seen a single thread on /a/ about it <br><br>I'm not even sure what I expected anymore.</br></br></br>    <br>I thought you were dead</br>  <br><br>it looks like she's eating that one pizza with the hotdogs in the crust</br></br>  <br>G-Glue?</br>  <br>typical Kallencuck fag</br>  <br>There were a couple when it came out.

It'd be anticlimactic if they just ended up being released at the end of the series without a fight. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does C.C. like pizza?<br><br>Not even good pizza, but shit tier Pizza Hut delivery, that's stuff is awful.</br></br>  <br> I like that 70s look she has. <br><br>But does she have a 70s bush?</br></br></br>  <br> implying /a/ dislikes Code Geass </br>  <br>Product endorsement.

He would destroy anyone.</br></br></br>  KALLEN&gt;ALL<br>EVERYONE ELSE CAN EAT SHIT</br>  <br>Die</br>  <br>Fat slut<br>Just imagine how that pizza is gonna look on belly years from now.</br></br>    <br> Suzaku is on a whole other level than every other pilot in the series <br><br>what are you talking about? did you see their battle in the R2 finale? Kallen and Suzaku fight till a stalemate. They're totally evenly matched (even though Gino does say that Kallen won... let's consider his opinion biased).</br></br></br>  <br>Kallens knightmare had higher specs though.</br>  <br> Suzaku coordinates the fight perfectly so that he can fulfill all these conditions: <br><br>i. disable Kallen's mech without killing her<br>ii. take exactly enough damage to blow up his mech and fake his death<br>iii. time this perfectly so it looks like a stalemate<br><br>And all against a machine with better stats.<br><br>Did you even watch the show?<br>He would have fucking destroyed her if he was trying.<br>But he wanted to fake his own death.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, that fight isn't really a good reference for anyone's power level really, since Suzaku was only fighting to 'survive' and not to 'win', because the plan involved him being perceived as KIA.<br><br>At the very least Kallen came very, very close to killing Suzaku even with his geass, so that has to count for something.</br></br></br>  <br> official CG <br> Megami promo art <br> official </br></br></br>  <br> (Source: /a/)  <br><br>Jesus Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> so new it hurts </br>  Can you guys just please post more c.c          <br>The spec difference isn't a significant amount at all. They're both 9th gen so it is minimal at best. Plus, Suzaku himself attributes his difficulty to her own skill during the battle, so its not that big of a gap at all.<br><br><br>Suzaku and Kallen are equals.<br><br><br>Add in Orpheus and Oldrin(Protagonists from Oz the Reflection) and Bismarck to tier 1.<br>Bismarck, you have to remember, was holding his own against the Albion in an inferior KMF, and Suzaku was only able to win by using his "Live!" command. Bismarck is also shown to be so much better than Xingke when they fought.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are so many C.C. fans so antagonistic to Kallen fans? Especially since pretty much all Kallen fans like C.C. a lot as well.  <br>Suzaku and Kallen are both aces. But i dont think they're equals.</br>  <br>Lots of hot glue, if you get my drift.</br>  <br>no one gives a fuck about Kallen</br>  Hey, CC just stole that guy's pizza!  <br>Well, thats just wrong though. One of them has never been portrayed as significantly better than the other. And theres no evidence to suggest that they aren't.</br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>His homolust pretty much led to the betrayal of the Black Knights and consequently, Lelouch's death, so fuck right out of here with that shit</br>  <br>No one gives a fuck since her character got dropped on it head on R2. Like, all that buildup she had on R1 was just gone and the bodyguard spotlight was given to Rolo</br>  <br>He earned his spot by killing that annoying cunt Shirley</br>  <br>One tragic annoying cunt getting killed by another less tragic, more annoying cunt does not make him a good character.<br><br>Shirley was a generic boring happy-go-lucky support character, but I sure as fuck would've like her getting more screen time than fucking Rolo</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta pander to the fujos.

Do they explain why Lelouch never seems to care about bitches? Also why did he chose such a silly hat to rule the world with in the end?  <br>He's a man that gets shit done. Bitches don't fit in the "Get shit done" part of his schedule.</br>  <br>Because he's a true manly man who cares more about his goals than bitches.</br>  <br>Did you not pay attention? <br> He spends eternity with CC </br></br>  <br><br>You'd think he'd find time between his chess games or something.<br><br>Yah she's hot, but she's kinda confirmed to be a stanky ho that was getting dicked since the 19th century. I feel he'd be above that.</br></br></br></br>   All this hate for Shirley, who is obviously best grill.   <br>Lelouch is too pure for bitches.</br>  <br> And what about the others?</br>  <br>It's still not wrong and it was justified.</br>  <br>I want CC to Spider-Man kiss me.</br>  <br/>  Why that shitty wikia of code geass doesn't mention that he obtained the code from Charles.  <br><br> but she's kinda confirmed to be a stanky ho that was getting dicked since the 19th century. <br><br>She's been alive since medieval times in the story, so she's been a ho since before that. Her original Geass was making men want to do it with her.<br><br>Plus, she was both Mao's lover and mother which is part of the reason he went crazy when she abandoned him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's still best girl and waifu material</br>  <br>Based Rolo</br>  <br>I forgot when this happened</br>  <br> prostitute <br> tight pussy </br></br>  <br>C.C. is my eternal waifu.</br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>Me</br>  <br>Because every other attempt to create something crazy and keikaku-fueled like that has basically crashed and burned.</br>  <br>Huh I didn't recall this scene</br>  <br>No she wasn't.<br><br>She was the Geass Directorate's leader</br></br></br>  <br> Ability to regenerate anything <br> Unlimited Hymen Works </br></br>  <br> Just finished the mission to beat Snizel and take back Nunnally + former black knights <br> Cue this scene <br> Next scene is literally a month later when Zero Req comes to fruition <br>I am convinced they fucked either at this point or at some point between this scene and Zero Req.</br></br></br></br>  I don't even remember what that faggot Ruru wanted.<br>All I remember from the show is C.C.'s big ass.</br>  <br> i. disable Kallen's mech without killing her ii. take exactly enough damage to blow up his mech and fake his death iii. time this perfectly so it looks like a stalemate <br><br>"Not killing her" was never an objective and he would have if necessary. The only thing that you can say for sure is he had an escape plan prepared and it somehow worked, but everything else is not clear in terms of where to draw the line.<br><br> He would have fucking destroyed her if he was trying. <br><br>Oh, that's complete bullshit and you know it. He's better on paper, but that doesn't mean it would be an easy fight. It never was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think your interpreted that whole thing backwards. Her deal was always about how to perceive Lelouch and R2 did spend some time on that. Nothing was "gone" except for her family, which was a closed issue with her mother in jail/hospital as a motivation for winning. Rolo was a replacement for Nunnally, both literal and figurative, not for Kallen in either way.</br>  <br>No, you first.</br>  <br>Are you 12? <br><br>C.C. is fine but that's a juvenile attitude.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure is fanon here.</br></br>  <br>I dislike her character because it's so Lulu focused. I understand that her family issue was pretty much done by R2, but she becomes stale quick in the face of complex characters with hidden agendas like C.C and Rolo. Basically everything she does, to me boils down to "I live to be a Zero's sword! I also want to be his woman. Watch as I immediately become hostile to C.C within moments of meeting her and ever thought and comment toward her is in reference to the MC of the show!"</br>  <br><br>This guy has a point. Kallen became one of the most shallow characters in the show. I feel like had she admitted her feelings for Lelouch sooner, she could have been a lot better though.<br><br>Personally, I feel like they could have also played up the idea that CC is second-in-command in order to drive it home more that she was a threat to whatever Kallen's ambitions were. And from the romantic angle, it would have been a constant in-your-face to her that she'd always just be side-chick at best. And watching her deal with that could have made her entertaining. But they dumped a lot of that aspect onto Rolo and his jealousy of Nunnally.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I dislike her character because it's so Lulu focused.

Watch as I immediately become hostile to C.C within moments of meeting her and ever thought and comment toward her is in reference to the MC of the show!" <br><br>I don't exactly agree with that. C.C. was using Lelouch to die and Rolo was not interested in how other people perceived him since he was a psychopath and a brocon. He only saved Lelouch for purely selfish reasons. There is a flip, but it happens in the end, when Lelouch decides to sacrifice himself and Suzaku so that neither of them can live normal lives anymore, so he keeps people out of his plans in order to allow them to live in the new world. <br><br>C.C. and her weren't really all that hostile to each other. More like nagging and slight envy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, there's plenty of characters in the show that are incredibly shallow to a greater extent. Kallen was somewhere around the middle. Probably underused though. She does get some fun interactions with C.C. and all in the sound episodes, if you've heard those.</br>  <br>Why couldn't they have just gone with a C.C x Lulu at the end? It's not like it would be unexpected or poorly received. Plus, they have such great chemistry and shippy moments, they might as well have chosen her.</br>  <br>They didn't feel that way towards each other, you deluded shipperfag.</br>  <br> he </br>  <br><br><br>Rolo was a replacement for Kallen in as much as Rolo vied for Lelouch's attention. I like Rolo better than Kallen, character wise, but that's only because, I think, they took what probably would have been Kallen's role and gave it to him. Instead of a deep drama where Kallen is dealing with wanting to be Zero's sword only for Suzaku and/or CC to take his place.<br><br>So, a lot of that drama was given to Rolo's character arc while the most Kallen really got was a few passive aggressive moments or what have you with CC and a single little bitch fight at the end. Maybe it wouldn't have fit her character to become a psychopath about it like Rolo, but had they focused a bit more on how the other characters perceived CC with an emphasis on Kallen's suspicion of her masking a deep insecurity, I think that would have been a good direction. Like how when Lelouch was missing and CC tells the BK's that Lelouch is still alive, and they're all "what would Zero's lover know blah blah blah." I'm surprised there was never a part where Kallen asks the others "Hey, who do you think she really is?" And that could have been a good way to jump into CC's backstory.<br><br><br><br>Underused may be the better way to put it.<br><br><br><br> Why couldn't they have just gone with a C.C x Lulu at the end? <br><br>They didn't?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably experience from real life events. Thanks for the hypothesis, /out/ poster. Stay in /a/, dubs poster.</br>  Kallen is love  <br><br>CC is cruel</br></br>  <br> shitty girl Domon </br>  <br> The spec difference isn't a significant amount at all. They're both 9th gen so it is minimal at best. <br>Not this fucking shit again. Let me make this clear. Generation gap has nothing to do with anything, Gawain was a generation lower than most models and it was still strong due to the power output, Shen-hu was weaker than Guren Eight Type but was able to fight toe to toe with it, just because two KMFs are of the same Generation doesn't mean shit. The Albion was made for Suzaku in mind and no one else, SEITEN was made as a powerhouse sine Cecile and Lloyd went overboard with it. SEITENB has better specs than the Albion this is fact Kallenfag.<br><br><br><br>Suzaku fought Kallen in a weaker KMF and still beat it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> implying /a/ likes anything at all </br></br></br>  <br> implying it doesn't </br>  <br> "Not killing her" was never an objective and he would have if necessary <br>His objective was to make sure no one pursue Lelouch. That's it.</br></br>  <br>they did</br>  <br><br>all anime is trash</br></br>  <br>Then go back to the shithole you came from</br>  <br>Thing is, nothing on-screen shows one model better than the other. They were matching each other blow for blow. And you really think that Lloyd and Cecile would make sure the Albion could fight on par with the Guren? You really think that Lloyd would make sure his masterpiece wasn't as good?<br><br> Kallenfag <br>Wrong. I'm a C.C.fag<br><br><br> Suzaku fought Kallen in a weaker KMF and still beat it. <br>But he didn't beat her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not removing the logo </br>  <br><br>CC fucked George Washington (possibly she herself being Martha Washington) and cucked Ben Franklin enough that Ben Franklin defected back to the British Empire and was able to kill the Revolution. It's partially implied that Washington also had a Geass that was given to him by CC.</br></br>  <br> Thing is, nothing on-screen shows one model better than the other. <br>It is stated that the SEITEN is the strongest KMF. The Albion is stated to be made for Suzaku.<br><br> And you really think that Lloyd and Cecile would make sure the Albion could fight on par with the Guren? <br><br>Except the Albion was finished long before the SEITEN was stolen, they said so themselves that they went overboard with it.<br><br> But he didn't beat her <br><br>Most have imagined the Gurren being knocked offline then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Albion was completed before the SEITEN retard. They left it as it because they deemed it impossible to pilot and also Lloyd doesn't seem to take much regard to rivalry since he didn't even know Rakshata made it. <br><br>Jesus you Kallenfags are hysterical. He knocked the SEITEN off line and destroyed its head knocking her out causing the KMF to plummet to its death while he managed to escape. How is that not beating someone?</br></br></br>  BISMARCK WALDSTEIN FUCKED LULU'S MOM.  <br> It is stated that the SEITEN is the strongest KMF <br>Its not stated<br><br> Except the Albion was finished long before the SEITEN was stolen, they said so themselves that they went overboard with it. <br>What is upgrades?

As well as the fact Kallen fell after she already beat him when Suzaku conceded defeat.<br><br>And like I said, I'm a C.C.fag. I just acknowledge Kallen won.<br><br><br>And let me say, I can not wait until Oz the Reflection gets to the end of R2 some it can use its KMF elaborations to debunk a lot of the myths about the performance difference between the two 9th gens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there any translations for Oz?</br>  <br> Its not stated <br>It is.<br><br> What is upgrades? <br><br>How does that debunk anything? The Albion was completed before they even worked on the SEITEN and they were just toying with it until they deemed it impossible to pilot, they never built the Albion as a successor to the Conquista or to go tow to toe with the Guren it was built for Suzaku from the ground up <br><br> But Kallen also destroyed his KMF in the process. <br><br>How does fuck does that change the fact that he beat Kallen? Your first argument was that he didn't. If he didn't beat Kallen then he didn't accomplish his objective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to believe that Lelouch is the cart driver and live together with CC for an eternity.  <br>The show states that the SEITEN is the strongest KMF at the present and various side materials as well. <br><br><br>Lloyd never beat the Lancelot just so it can defeat the Guren, that's just your stupid fanfiction<br><br>  As well as the fact Kallen fell after she already beat  <br><br>That doesn't make sense. The Guren was knocked offline before she made the final blow. This is you making shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sadly, no. Plenty of scans, but no one wants to translate them.<br><br><br> How does fuck does that change the fact that he beat Kallen? Your first argument was that he didn't. If he didn't beat Kallen then he didn't accomplish his objective. <br>Oh, you're that same autist saying this shit on /m/ then.<br>Now it all makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man, I think Bismarck got shafted hard in the series.  <br> But Kallen also destroyed his KMF in the process. <br><br> And his KMF was destroyed in the process. <br><br>Not him but you clearly stated he didn't beat her, what does pointing this out accomplishes? You're just ignoring the fact that he dismantled the Guren and shut it offline. That's beating someone<br><br> As well as the fact Kallen fell after she already beat him when Suzaku conceded defeat. <br><br><br>And this is bullshit in itself<br><br> I can not wait until Oz the Reflection gets to the end of R2 some it can use its KMF elaborations to debunk a lot of the myths about the performance difference between the two 9th gens. <br><br>What myths? Everything can be easily found in side materials or watching the fucking show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do CC's lips taste like?</br>  <br> That doesn't make sense. The Guren was knocked offline before she made the final blow. This is you making shit up. <br>Nope. Kallen punched a hole through the Lancelot's chest before her systems went off.</br></br>  <br>I'm with you anon, I understand your feelings</br>  <br> Gets fucking told by his own stupid logic <br> calls /m/ boogeyman </br></br>  <br>Anon, I know that's your headcanon and that it's bullshit,  but I believe it  </br>  <br>Yes, he did knock out the power from the Guren with his last attack, but that was after Kallen had already dealt the final blow, which Suzaku himself concedes that she got him.<br><br><br> calls /m/ boogeyman <br>Its not a boogeyman when he says the exact same stuff there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nope. Kallen punched a hole through the Lancelot's chest before her systems went off. <br>Wrong. The Harukens destroyed the Guren's frame.</br></br>  <br>You would like to hear that they taste like pizza, too bad anon, it tastes like 1000 years old woman <br>I stil love it though</br></br>  <br> Yes, he did knock out the power from the Guren with his last attack, but that was after Kallen had already dealt the final blow <br>That doesn't make sense.since teh correlation between the two means that Kallen did it after the fact because the blow would have stopped the Lancelot. <br><br> which Suzaku himself concedes that she got him. <br>....that was after the Guren got shut down dumbass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The party never ends, does it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the harkens only hit the head. Moreover, The Guren Seiten was largely undamaged, only having a severed arm, with the other arm only falling off after the Guren fell.<br>Especially when you contrast how damaged the Lancelot was with its own limbs that Kallen had destroyed.</br></br>  <br>So that means the Lancelot put the Guren offline before she gave the final blow because there's no way the Lancelot could have moved if she did. <br><br>It's the same argument that has been going on for years because Kallenfags (you) just can't listen to reason/</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Guren upgraded just to defeat Lancelot?</br>  <br>Nope, Lloyd did it just for the hell of it.<br><br>IMO, THe Guren SEITEN seems to focuse more on one-on-one combat compared to the Lancelot, which seems to be an all-rounder.</br></br></br>  Keep on going guys, we're going for the top  <br>You know, (incorrectly) accusing people of being Kallenfags doesn't make you right. Especially when the series itself says Kallen won, even more so when Suzaku outright states he can't beat her.</br>  <br> The Guren Seiten was largely undamaged, <br> Frame was destroyed <br> Both arms were off <br> Legs gone <br><br>Okay<br><br> specially when you contrast how damaged the Lancelot was with its own limbs that Kallen had destroyed. <br><br>Lancelot still had its head and torso on and one of its legs were still in tact.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Especially when the series itself says Kallen won <br>Now who's lying.</br></br>  <br>I don't really want to interfere but wasn't lancelot already after some fighting and also wasn't it inferior to Guren? I mean, they were both really good pilots but i think Suzaku was still a better one</br>  <br> Especially when the series itself says Kallen won, <br>So you just want to change events to fit your own fanfiction? <br><br> even more so when Suzaku outright states he can't beat her. <br><br>....and then precedes to beat her?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Frame was destroyed <br> &gt;Legs gone </br></br>  <br>C2.</br>  <br>Lancelot flawlessly beat the other KMFs so it wasn't damaged or anything and yes it was weaker than the SEITEN which everyone in this thread has been stating.</br>  <br> Guren Seiten was largely undamaged, <br> undamaged <br>Also<br><br> I don't know what a frame is. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much or undamaged.</br>  <br>Then what's this agument for, it's stated in the series that they are both good pilots, and the thing that they had somewhat a draw at the end shows that Suzaku is better as he was fighting at disadvantage</br>  <br>I said it lost its arms, but that was it. Body is intacts, and both legs are undamaged.</br>  <br> I said it lost its arms, <br>It lost its head as well. The only portion that it still has left are its legs.</br></br>  <br><br><br> The Guren Seiten was largely undamaged <br><br>That sure as fuck does not look largely undamaged. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which is more than the Lancelot had, since it lost its arms and right leg. And thats without the fist shoved through its chest.</br>  <br> Which is more than the Lancelot had <br>The lancelot still had its head torso and left arm retard.</br></br>  <br>And left leg right?</br>  <br>The same place where Guren's head and arms went.</br>    <br>HOW THE FUCK DID SUZAKU BEAT FUTURE EYES.<br><br>Also, Suzaku was stronger than kallen with his die command but kallen's gurren had better specs</br></br></br>  <br>Ah kay then, sorrey</br>  <br>Well the curse was just ordering him to use his skills to the limit, which Kallen did in that fight too probably</br>  <br>It probably ups his reactions. Due to how Geass works, he won't hesitate and thus csn act and react faster</br>  <br> Rolo was a replacement for Kallen in as much as Rolo vied for Lelouch's attention. I like Rolo better than Kallen, character wise, but that's only because, I think, they took what probably would have been Kallen's role and gave it to him. Instead of a deep drama where Kallen is dealing with wanting to be Zero's sword only for Suzaku and/or CC to take his place. <br><br>Which is why we will never about this, since I don't like Rolo and can only tolerate his presence in the show out of obligation. Rolo's role (is that a pun?) has nothing in common with Kallen other than the fact they are both piloting robots. But he's not a good pilot (it's all the Geass time stopt work) and the things Rolo says to Lelouch and why he even acts that way towards him are all completely different. Even the sacrifice sequence wouldn't make any sense if any other character did it.<br><br>You speak of Rolo's drama, but again...the reasons for it are unrelated. He had no family and was a child soldier at best. I think you're also being rather sloppy by downplaying that Kallen does get a few more scenes with Lelouch that should be analyzed (ep 2, 7 and 22 for instance). I don't dislike your last suggestion though, that would have been fine too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Generation gap has everything to do with performance range. The Guren SEITEN does reach a higher point, but the Albion is right below it and then there's a huge gap before you come across any other robot in the series. Gawain was from the 6th generation and was never of any use against Suzaku's 7th generation Lancelot. It rarely faced higher generation mecha in general before its destruction by Jeremiah. <br><br>Shen Hu was also the equivalent of an 8th generation as they made it "too strong to be piloted" at the time.<br><br> Suzaku fought Kallen in a weaker KMF and still beat it. <br><br>Suzaku fought her in a slightly weaker KMF from the same technological generation and they tied with a double KO.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The Albion was completed before the SEITEN retard <br><br>False. It is first mentioned in episode 20, two episodes after the SEITEN debuted, and sees no action until episode 22, months later. <br><br> Jesus you Kallenfags are hysterical. He knocked the SEITEN off line and destroyed its head knocking her out causing the KMF to plummet to its death while he managed to escape. How is that not beating someone? <br><br>If he did that with his own mecha intact, then I'd applaud him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Suzaku had a better robot than Bismark's and that final blow teared right through it. Future sight doesn't give you better armor. Bismark was wrong to not dodge (or he wasn't fast enough).<br><br>For one thing, Kallen doesn't have a magical power preventing her from feeling tired. Which is why she lost consciousness. Add that to Suzaku being superhuman.</br></br></br></br>  Are the Lancelot Conquista and Guren Kashoshiki considered 7th Gen or 8th Gen?  <br> False. It is first mentioned in episode 20, two episodes after the SEITEN debuted, and sees no action until episode 22, months later. <br>Wrong again dumbshit. They said they had completed before the Guren and Cecile confim that it was ready to go in that episode meaning that it was already set to sortie before then. <br><br> If he did that with his own mecha intact, then I'd applaud him <br><br>Just can't take losing gracefully can you?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wrong again dumbshit. They said they had completed before the Guren and Cecile confim that it was ready to go in that episode meaning that it was already set to sortie before then. <br><br>If you're so sure about it yourself, then please quote the specific episode, take a screen capture of the conversation and prove it. What do you have to lose?<br><br> Just can't take losing gracefully can you? <br><br>You haven't been a good teacher.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Generation gap has everything to do with performance range. <br>Nope. Characters such as Xingke, Lelouch, and Orange beat characters despite having lower generation models.<br><br> The Guren SEITEN does reach a higher point, but the Albion is right below it and then there's a huge gap before you come across any other robot in the series <br><br>Nice fanfiction.<br><br>  It rarely faced higher generation mecha in general before its destruction by Jeremiah.  <br><br>Gawain was a generation below the current models and was a protype, it also beat Cornelia's KMF and her Knights as well despite them being stronger<br><br> Shen Hu was also the equivalent of an 8th generation as they made it "too strong to be piloted" at the time. <br><br>Wrong again. Nothing was stated that the Shen-Hu was an 8th generation model.<br><br> Suzaku fought her in a slightly weaker KMF from the same technological generation and they tied with a double KO. <br><br>Jesus Christ you're pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8th. Albion actually comes with less features than the Conquista.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh boy, here we go again</br></br></br></br>  <br> During the gap Lloyd says that he is working on his masterpiece  <br> In episode 20 Cecile tells Suzaku that the Albion is ready to sortie meaning that it had been prepared before the SEITEN since the battle just ended less than a day prior <br><br>But yeah..Albion was made after the SEITEN just like you said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? I'm pretty sure Cornelia in her Gloucester was handing the Gawain its ass because of her KMF was faster. In terms of Generation, hers was the inferior machine (5th Gen Gloucester vs 6th/7th Gen Gawain).</br>  Chirico&gt;Kallen&gt;I AM GUNDAMU&gt;everyone else&gt;shit&gt;jewgi  <br>Holy damn</br>  <br>Wrong about the Gawain. It was 6th gen, and a whole generation superior to Gloucester and Sutherlands, which are 5th gen.</br>  <br> Nope. Characters such as Xingke, Lelouch, and Orange beat characters despite having lower generation models. <br><br>Orange had a Knight Giga Fortress. In other words, a Mobile Armor. <br><br>Lelouch never beat someone from a higher generation in a straight fight. <br><br>Xingke basically had the Wing Zero.<br><br> Nice fanfiction. <br><br>Then how would you rank the robots, genius? <br><br><br> Gawain was a generation below the current models <br><br>This is bullshit. Gawain was 6th generaiton. It didn't beat Cornelia's mecha, which was 5th generation, either. Darlton stabbed her in the back. You call that a fair fight? Gawain was almost defeated right before then too. <br><br> Wrong again. Nothing was stated that the Shen-Hu was an 8th generation model. <br><br>Outside of the show it is classified as such.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;In episode 20 Cecile tells Suzaku that the Albion is ready to sortie  <br><br>Yes<br><br> meaning that it had been prepared before the SEITEN since the battle just ended less than a day prior <br><br>Both robots were in usable condition.<br><br> But yeah..Albion was made after the SEITEN just like you said. <br><br>You're a big fat liar. <br><br>I said<br><br>  It is first mentioned in episode 20, two episodes after the SEITEN debuted, and sees no action until episode 22, months later.  <br><br>Nothing about when it was made. Both were being worked on at around the same time unless you somehow think the Albion had been rotting for months and everyone was stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shut the fuck up faggots and post more delicious ass.  <br>Conquista has a big ass hadron cannon but the Albion's Super VARIS can shoot hadron blasts too.</br>  What if we get a post R2 scene in the last movie?  <br>If we do, its only gonna be focusing on what happens to the new cast.</br>  <br>I'm positive they will if the characters manage to survive this.</br>  <br>I don't remember that scene, when does it happen?</br>  <br>In imaginations</br>  The heavens call...

So I got a big stack of Aikatsu character/setting materials (mainly S2) in the mail. I know this stuff has been somewhat mass produced, so are there tons of scans available? If not, I'll scan some at some point then if there is interest.

Preferably online, but maybe an artbook or something?  <br>I haven't seen this. A lot of this kind of thing comes in little segments in magazines.

If that's the case, you could try to be more clear about your questions next time.<br><br>It makes communication more precise and clear, what's so bad about it? You don't need more of a reason than that. <br><br>This is just my opinion, but I think you're probably seeing it as unnecessary because you think having a kanji just for that small purpose is too big a price to pay in exchange for a little bit of precision, but that's just your bias because you're having to learn a bunch of kanji in a short period of time, so it seems to you like having less Kanji would be a great advantage, when it really wouldn't be so in the big picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just stick the english sentence on the front</br>  <br>Maybe?

Nothing feels better than being able to fluidly read a script which uses over 2000 different characters. <br><br>Also, don't worry about their pronunciation. You'll learn that as you learn actual words. However, I'd recommend going into vocabulary sooner rather than later. Don't wait until you've learned 2000 kanji to start learning words. Once you've got a grasp on the basic radicals and how they're used to form kanji you could already start working on your vocab cause you'll already be prepared to look at a kanji the way it should be looked at and not just as a bunch of scribbles.<br><br>Anyway, congratulations on making it so far, but be warned, the further you go the slower your progress will be.
