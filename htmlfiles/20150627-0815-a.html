[ Looking for Koreanbros!          Isnt that the same kid with the dog from before?       Chairman in South America spinoff when?               Motherfucker has changed. Not even blatant ecchi shit interests him anymore.          Kate bullies Meiko   clothes bully Meiko   food bullies Meiko  What doesn't bully Meiko?        koreanbro?   Meiko.     mari bullies meiko   andre bullies meiko   gakuto(?) bullies meiko  not sure for the last one         Nope. Meiko's Meikos are the biggest Meiko bullies in the entire manga.    That means he won't be able to enjoy the Wet t-shirt contest anymore?   Oooooooohhhh is the VC finally going to make her return and tame the beast known as Andre         Wow why does it look like the author wants Fat boy to end up with Meiko    Im sure hana in a two piece would have his desire going wild like it usually does when hes with her.   To see the boys &amp; USC sitting together &amp; eating lunch? That's some huge progress from the 1st arc. Is It going to be doomed once Chiyo discovers the truth about Hana &amp; Kiyoshi.        progress  I already saw hana kicking kiyoshi in one panel and wait till we see mari's dialogue translated. last time she was calling kiyoshi ungrateful trash, I wouldn't be sure on progress yet.        Andre's legs  H-how    Aaaaaand done.  Oh shit is she gonna be back? Please let her be back!  Some extra pages incoming       They are eating their food, uninvited.    Sorry, forgot the image    Shes not just kicking kiyoshi shes kicking them all out because they are eating their food.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286   filler    Extra page 1    excuse me for not knowing korean    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286   filler     I don't know korean, it's called 'looking at pictures and figuring out the context'.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286  Do you even know what filler is you fuck?    Look at maris reaction to kiyoshi eating their food.    just wait for based koreanbro   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286  What the fuck are you talking about nigga (btw, extra page 2)     it's happening     Thanks mister!

Shit, it shouldve been,   Mm... it's dangerous to fly a rotor in a place like...     this...    ...    I'm sorry, I'll be careful... so please may I have that back...    ......    There's something... that I can feel from this rotor...    However... what is it? I can't remember...    Wait a second... that... isn't that dangerous?    Mister- Please give it back now-    ...    A pair of underwear?                            V for victory, yes Hana.    New Manoeuver: Gensis     Hey you, sir!    What are you doing in such a state!?    Stay well, young...    Man!                   Why is this the best manga ever?    because of hana... because of hana anon.      I'd nearly forgotten.. But I am a warrior...    Even if I'm distressed, I cannot stand still. Even if whilst bearing pain, a man...    I'm sorry... I am a bit late, but...    Ought to strive towards the next battlefield!    I have returned after a complete revival!    Heh...!?   Bottle: Mayonaise                Because the fanservice is the plot and both are compelling.    anyone good with photoshop care to get rid of everything surrounding Hana? Its a great picture of her if not for the adverts.     Genesis, not Gensis. Mistakes everywhere today.     Heh~ehhh!    Are you alright!?    Vice-president! If you don't have to worry about that kind of mayona...    Um... I have returned after a complete...    What!? Where have you been, it's lunch already!    I... I apologise. Whilst returning...    Kiyoshi! Bring something to clean up with!!    Ah... yes                      Are they having strawberries with mayonaise? Mayonerries?      NICE CATCH-! Andrei! Return!!    Good- Aren't I nice! GOOD BOY!!    TN:  She's speaking in English.         Lisa looking so happy  It'll hurt to see Meiko take Andre away from her.     ... Since a while ago they've been showing us how perfectly their synchronisation is going...   Are they trying to lower our morale...    Toppling that over seems quite difficult...    An anti-Andrei countermeasure... ...    Ourselves shall lend a hand!    Guys!    We'd be grateful to have you all, who were the closest to Andrei, participate in our strategy meeting...    And... It seems I haven't had the chance to properly express my thanks to you all face-to-face for your cooperation     Uh...                    I can feel it. Old VIcePrez coming back in few chapters.   Pretty much the only thing thats actually been predictable. I mean it makes sense given the andre/meiko dynamic. Then again maybe it wont happen like we think it will.     &gt;Ourselves shall lend a hand!  Are you missing a speech bubble in the first two panels?      Thanks... It was thanks to you guys that the jailbreak succeeded... ...    And that we were able to see the school festival and the day of judgement...    I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart    Uh... No... Such a...    That being said... How did you decide to cooperate with us?    Well, it would be long to explain... but to put it simply...    It is because rather than the cram-school lifestyle governed by the school festival of light, your...    Side which is governed by the school festival of darkness is more enjoyable...                  W-what if Assman was actually on his way to the school grounds to re-inspire Meiko?   Hes on his way to south america given all his reactions to things that fly.    I think I'm missing a memearrow, but that should be it. Correct me if I'm wrong.     That's...    That's how it is...    On top of that... Those bastards weren't content with crushing our souls, and took out the recyclable garbage...    'Tis nigh unforgivable!    *cough*...    Then let us quickly eat while holding our strategy meeting!    This sandwich is delicious-!    Rubbeth a dub dubbeth, thank ye 4 the grubbeth    Of course, I made them    Um... We... have come with a plan in mind...    Sure! Let us hear of it                             Rubbeth a dub dubbeth, thank ye 4 the grubbeth  You glorious bastard      Andrei Capture Plan!    It's a plan where, when Andrei is caught unawares in a large snare, we stab him with spears!!    You... Do you plan to stab a friend to death using a spear? He's not mammoth    I cannot think you're in your right mind...    Huh? No, that's... the spears are... how should I say it, a figure of speech... kind of... for example, a round end...    You can't use tools in the jockey match! That's obvious, you retard!!    We also lack the time to set up the trap at the beginning... Do we not have other methods?                 are the boys going to grope Mari? I remember she agreed to that if they helped her in the jailbreak.     There aren't!? It's only the mammoth!?    Of... of course we have... mm-... "Andrei Sleepiness Plan", "Andrei Hypnosis Plan", "Andrei Freezing Plan"...     From only hearing the names, I can tell that we can't use those!    You guys aren't worthy to eat my lunch, eat the school lunches!    Eh eh...? No way...    That's right... For you lot who aren't of any use, even one homemade lunch is wasteful    Anyways... You guys, like get your stuff together...    Kiyoshi you too!    If you can't think up any plans, eat as you will over there!    There, get out!!                       Didnt kiyoshi say he wouldnt do that? Idk about the boys.     P... Please wait, actually we do have a plan that we've thought...    Up of, but...    ... Meiko... huh    Mm... Andrei's sole weakness is the vice-president    However... For a person to have changed this much... ...             ANDRE HAS TURNED INTO A DOG, HE'S STANDING LIKE ONE     If... it were the Andrei before he were to become Lisa's assistant    When shown a photo of the past vice president, he would for a few seconds... revert to his past self    Yeah... If that were to be true, if we were to bring some photos of Meiko to the jockey match...     That is not so... For before coming here we have tested this, but... The current Andrei did not show the slightest interest...    ... So in order to revert Andrei to his past self, Meiko...    thud...               TL     Grrr...    Meiko... I'll revert her... ...    I must object...           Oh jesus. Meiko comin back is going to fuck with risa.    Um... This...    Please take this, Andrei... san...   Grrrrr!!    Maiko-!!    Hweh~! It hurts~!!     Calm down Andrei!    Whack!    Hu... I must apologise... Andrei doesn't listen to anyone but for me you see...    I'll be sure to give him plenty of punishment so forgive him...    That... Something like that is not the vice-president that we know    To be bitten by Andrei and not to retaliate...    Mm... 'Twas shocking... However...                              After witnessing the events just now, I thought once more. We must without fail, succeed in the revival of the vice-president!    It is the F (Vice-President)    Of Revival!         Thanks based koreanbro    Hell yeah, Andrenomics investments will become profitable again.    Thank you koreanbro, you live forever in our hearts    thanks for translation     &gt;It is the F (Vice-President)      &gt;Of Revival!  Something something chilling elegy.  Thanks koreanbro.           Mari hasn't changed   she's the same boys hating cunt as always  What do you have to say now, Mari haters? Right, shut the fuck up and crawl back into your holes.        u know im kinda going to miss the current Vice prez once she revert back to her usual self    Full staff Anime   There we go, I knew I was missing something.    Much obliged for the work.   so we enter into Pig Arc?   I hope you realize what this means, right?  We will NEVER EVER get off of cavalry Namek.       50+ chapters of cavalry  This could be good or bad.     Its going to be great, we have meiko changing back, andrenomics possibly returning, more hana and kiyoshi interactions, chiyo probably finding out about said interactions, and somebodies incriminating photos/videos being released   When is the next KyioshixMari scene?  Their snake bath was the hottest thing in the manga.     Don't forget the lewdest miracle.    Wasn't that the hand holding scene?    Thank you based Koreanbro.    I disagree. Plenty of others were way hotter. That specific one suffered in that it was solely life saving fused into extreme fanservice. There was no desire like kate and maris scene or literally all of the hana ones.     the hottest thing in the manga.     I don't find lesbians hot      They just desperate hos my niggah.    He invested somewhere else already.     implying he's not playing the long game   implying he's not going to make out like a bandit on masochism's Wall Street when he has two queens battling to control him      Pretend it's a guy sucking on the nipple in that page, or Kiyoshi with a wig in the whole chapter.    He is no longer a broker, he became the stock.    Risa is investing in him, andres market crashed when meiko went moe.    It doesn't work that way anon    For me it could.     the hottest thing in the manga     Jesus christ that just ruins it all. Why do people do this..?    This guy gets it. Love+lust is the winning formula.    Care to explain why you don't like two hos going at each other like they eating ice cream, homie?    I want to taste their cones too.    It's just not interesting. Lesbians can't even have sex without toys    not him, but women who can't please (or don't even want to) men aren't arousing, to me    It was just a way for him to enjoy the scene like the rest of us, calm your autistic tits.   cones  Either you're a closet homo or your first language is spanish.       You don't have ice cream cones in your country?    Bitch, the redhead and crow have been waging war on each other for years because deep down they have feelings for each other, but they afraid of everyone's views on it. All they got to do is say no lesbo.     because deep down they have feelings for each other  Thisi s a delusion fitting of /u/     Pfff, I'm Italian. If think hard enough you can figure out that a cone resembles more a male genitals than a female ones.     You can always lend them ya dick, bro.    Underrated post    Amico hai il cazzo a punta?  HEY GUYS! I've found pointycock!      Perchè, esistono donne con la figa a forma di cono gelato?   Which DD would you x?  Mai waifu   You mean mine.     Koneko     No, mine    Neither! Xenovia is best waifu   <br/>   Koneko doesn't have any D's though.    No....Mine.    But that's wrong     I never liked the D's in DxD they just look like implants from the 90's.     Left   We still have a thread use it.<br/>   It's correct.    Rias, Akeno and Irina at the same damn time.    Ross.   Serafall is best DxD    100 yen coin   not fine ass rias and sexy ass akeno  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ne8<wbr>DgiJdzCk</wbr>  [ ]     rias and rossweisse are best but rias is best   Silly rabbit, Akeno is for me.   Guys stop fighting over Akeno, her breasts are big enough for all of us.  I call dibs on Sona.    That's a negatory     It is fact.    This. Xenovia is best DXD.    Followed closely by Koneko.     asia for some reason.    This thread needs more Zenovia.      It's funny how they had to make Rossweisse a useless retard, so that she wouldn't steal the best girl status with that dynamite body.              You guys need to find yourselfs a new girl Akeno is mine             Anyone else waiting for BDs before they watch this for the first time?    Ophis.    Back the fuck out, m8. She stays with me    There can only be one.    Does she show up in the anime? I just started season 2. I don't know who she is but my penis is certainly familiar with her.    Posting best doujin   She does, she is in the 3rd season. I can't remember if she appears in season 2 though.    Eh, I've only ever read one ntr doujin that turned me on. Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot. HOW DO YOU ENJOY BEING FUCKED BY A TRUE MANS COCK INSTEAD OF HIS TINY LITTLE PECKER YOU FILTHY WHORE       Whatever, Issei impregnated his harem canon now.     Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot.  That one is even more hilarious considering it gets nothing right about DxD´s world, and the idea of a runt like Raizer ever being considered as leader of the underworld is just too funny to take seriously     in manga?   This one. After casting resurrection ofc.  And yes, M&amp;M Resurrection restores eradicated bodies.    Extra scene for the last episode in the Bds of S2 she shows up outside Issei´s house with Vali, its how they teased that S3 was going to happen.     Which DD would you x?   There is only one answer to that anon, all of them.  ALL OF  THEM except  ashy tits               Author confirmed on his blog.   http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/      I would like to bully Valkyrie. anyone else?   LNs   Only of bodies that matter. there is still no reason what so ever to bring back that pile of ashes back, specially considering that even asia can probably one shot her and turn her to ashes again        Stop being delusional   I'd like some Irina chan myself.   I would bully her by taking her to super expensive stores and buying her everything she sees    Usually, girls like Rias are my fetish, but for this show, I'm more interested in Koneko than all the others.   I love a show that has really.... eye catching eye catches.  What does it feels like?   bretty cruel mane.    Are you really asking what boobs feel like?  Boobs feels like a cantaloupe.      Bags of salty milk   Is this FAT TATS: the anime?   Pretty much    more like  ALL TATS: The anime.  the range of sizes is pretty good, even if the main focuse are big fat tats.       whichever one has the biggest DDs     Poor Sona looks so sad it's practically heartbreaking.    MAY DAY... MaY... daYy  THIS IS THE QUEEN XENOVIA      that view     Left is too yellow.    Its karma, Sona used to steal Ria's toys when they were small. But don worry Issei will give her a piece of the DxD from time to time to keep her happy     Small perky breasts are fine too.    I don't think Ishibumi is that cruel to Saji.  Otherwise we will see child who can control dragon water      Sona is great in threesomes because she balances out the girls she is usually paired with    I seriously hope not. Sona is a bitch for neglecting Saji.     Sona is a bitch for neglecting some one she never liked as anything but a brother    anon expecting her to like Saji is like expecting Rias to like Kiba.  And Saji neglects momo and twintails even harder, so i guess you dont want anyone to be happy.         why this season of dxd is so bad ? it feels like watching naruto fillers    Superior nordic girl    That's because it is fucking filler.    Saji tries so hard, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.   Rossweisse is not alone for C88, Rias getting another one. Can't post pictures because of lewd. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51068763</wbr>   Loki ruined the anime. Fuck Loki.    becuase they decided to mesh together a bunch of arcs, and skip a couple others, so they could use the second half of the season for a shitty completly anime original filler arc that will have no fucking impact on the actual story because  LOL they wont remember anything that happened  but it will impact the audience becuase it steals the hype from some of the events that would happen in S4 if it ever gets made.     Would you let a horny cat suck your dick?   Dude Saji tries but in all the wrong ways, the mother fucker basically does backflips into the friendzone and then dives deeper and deeper into the otoutozone and puts weights around his feet just to be safe.  And its not like he doesnt have help, Issei tries to bring him up any time he is talking alone with Sona, but she has no interest at all in saji as anything but a member of her peerage.  Saji should have taken the two girls that are after his D and then get them to help him convert Sona, but instead he ignores them which in turn makes them plot agaisnt him ever getting together with sona and makes them shove issei more into sona's face so she will go after him.       https://jerutz.wordpress.com/slashd<wbr>og/</wbr>   Rias always gets a couple so thats no surprise.  lets hope the Ross one is good and not like the Irina one we got when S2 aired, the cover was pretty great and then it got scanned and it was shit.      Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.     Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.  and she grabs your hand with her tail to keep it there on her head     that explains everything  its not just him, overall new characters and the plot is weak hell i'm not watching this show for plot but god damn this level of story writing should be banned, even PLOT didnt deliver.   S4  After what i have just watched i'm not sure if want.  Also all girls are best girls Rias and Sona just happened to be my favorite             Well it isn´t totally bad, half of the season was good, we got neko sisters    Yes because it's her fault he keeps chasing her when she's never shown any interest.    That's not true.  What happened is a typical scene between two children.  one doesn't want to lend her toy. (Rias)   the other wants to play with it. (Sona)    In the end, the teddy bear's ear was torn off as they tugged on it and both cried:   Rias because the toy Sirzechs gave to her was damaged.   Sona because she was sorry for damaging the toy.             the level of fuck ups in the last 3 epiosodes overshadow the good things from the first half, hell not even the Oppai Dragon song took the shit taste off of the last episode.   yes at least we got Kuroka, and genki koneko out of it, and i guess a half assed soft Akeno  though that just pisses me off because there was no real build up or payoff either because of all the shit they skipped     Well at least now they are fighting over a much stronger teddy bear who can just fuck them both and keep them happy.           A cat is fine too.     Where is a japanese anime Gordon Ramsay when you need him  Someone needs to give a lesson to that studio     Ravel.   A cat is more than just fine.          I didn't like it because it made Issei look more than the typical oblivious harem protag he usually is in the LN. And that says something.    showdown with Sairaorg  New mobage event is teasing season 4 god damnit.          PLEASE MORE    The artist making the Ross one is pretty good in my opinion. I particularly liked the Daimidaler doujin he made.     THE ASS WAS FAT     tfw Rias doesn't do it for me   tfw can't fap to Rias at all   Only DxD I have yet to fap to   Other than me possibly being gay as fuck what the fuck is wrong with me?         <br/>      And that's all I could find for this event.    red heads might not be your thing?...but even then anon, i would be seriously worried, the gay might be starting to take you over.    You don't like motherly girls.    Red heads may not be your thing. She may be too much of an Onee-san.         YES        Season 4 when?   Sometime between Winter and Fall 2016.    I myself don't like Asia. Not because of her cockblocks (I know that won't get anywhere anytime even without her because harem series), but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.    Irina     See? No one would post like this a few years ago. The cancer people bring from generals is astounding.     sauce?    his ass.     but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.  I dont mind girls being too nice, but yeah she is too nice AND boring .  hell her tits have more personality than she does.      That S3 was laughably bad.   The sad part is that they had all the tools for a decent fun season but decided to just throw it all the fuck away for anime original shit.  they could have tweaked the sitri game to fix some of the things that they felt would not really work, work in some new things, and hell maybe even bring loki back for a final showdown at the end of the season, but nope they just went full retard with it.      How can you find AKENO of all things attractive and not find Rias attractive?     Akeno hater   I only browse and post in these threads occasionally, but even I think you are annoying.      let keep our fingers crossed then, in S2 we did get a couple of pretty good one like the Akeno one, the Asia one if you are into that particular fetish and even if not the art was good and mostly in character, and the harem one was nice as well .  I hope we get another good harem on and a good Xenovia, or Koneko one (no the gasper/koneko one is not good), basically for all the girls to get at least one good one would be nice.      Based on stalker points where the BDs(there are two editions for each format) have about 3.6k and the DVDs have 1k. It's pretty likely a season 4 is coming. Though I bet a winter or spring release. That's not even counting the other retailers where it constantly ranks.   Who would be the best wife?   Realistically speaking I'd say Rose due to her being the best at budgeting, but take it as you will      Wouldn't Rias be the obvious answer?    pretty much , yeah...unless you dont want a harem.   understanding   rich as fuck   sexy as fuck but still with a cute jelly side   lets you have a harem   awesome family so you dont have to worry about shitty inlaws   that said, the right answer is actually  all of them               Koneko doesn't have any D's though.   Anime only anons are so cute.        She will never ask you to monster battle her dad to break an engagement and then awkwardly tell you how cool you looked and try to ask you out on a date   Abe deserved so much more than what she got, I hope that with D2 we get some more side stories with her involved in them.      tfw she's been irrelevant for over 10 volumes now     It would be great if Issei had some issues with his dragon body and that they call her in to help him...or anything really.  then again we do have a blode ojousama with drills in the main cast already, so the posibilities of Abe being brought back are really really low which sucks because she would bring her monsters and their shenanigans which were always great to read about.  Its weird how hard she gets side tackled by Rias, considering she has been ok with most girls hanging around issei.        That side story happened right before volume 10 iirc so that explains why she acted like that.    It happened right before Volume 6. That's still a long way before Rias' drama acting up in v10.    Will we get a short OVA with her in it?   Maybe because she is human?       hmmm you might be right, it was too close to her limit and abe got hit with a bit of the backlash   nah, i think the anon above got it right in that it happened close to a time when Rias was in a emotional state and Abe just had bad luck.  also yeah lets hope that she shows up in an OVA or something.   the second side story with her and her father happened latter anon.            Oppai of Tennis happens after Volume 4 Issei SOS happens right before Volume 6    Non-DxDfag here. Can someone please post that screenshot of Loki (?) crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her, it gave me a heart attack but I didn't save it.   I ought to burn you alive for mistaking Rossweisse with Loki.    I'm very sorry. I just thought it'd be too vague without a name so I went with my closest guess. Thanks, though.     crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her  more like her boss left her behind.    faggot made another thread for it , but just in case some one still has not seeing it.  http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/23319433/<wbr>  6-part novel "Highschool DxD EX" was announced to be bundled with S3 BD.   Someone who calls Asia "Mother".  No idea if its her kid, or just another harem kid that just calls her mother as they were all probably raised together with all the girls being their "mothers"   Mysterious ○○ with black hair that uses lightning  Issei/Akeno's kid   Mysterious ○○ that has Holy sword Durandal Ⅳ  Issei/Xenovia's kid   Nekomimi ○○ in white kimono.

But this is something that's gonna be in next month's dragon magazine and if google is to be even slightly trusted, this says they're going to talk about the decision to go original this season.     Actually they all call Asia mother and the implication is that she dies in their timeline. So either Asia is barren as fuck, or she died before she could have her own child.    Kiryuu...she knows everything.     someone is called mom   it means she dies  that's quite the leap in logic namefag      where the hell is Rossweisse and  Raynare's  kids?   A lovely cat and a lovely  Precure Thread !    If we made love would she leave scratch marks on my back?     Otokichi can help with that.     I'm going to marry Haruharu!  megu midriff    I wish her Precurel form had midriff     That was the lewdest outfit in the entire franchise. Toei's been so bold recently. I guess the soccer moms just don't pay like they used to.     Sluttiest pink     Ah. Jerked it to her so much you lost you ability to cum or get hard anymore then?   I just finished HeartCatch.   The last four episodes was amazing. I kept reading how it's considered the best season so I think I went in expecting it to be miles above the others and was slightly disappointed, but the last few episodes completely changed my mind.  I didn't really care much for Yuri throughout the series, but the scene with her dad made me tear up and grow to love her. I loved Infinite Silhouette. It's a shame though super-Tsubomi purified Dune with a punch and not a hug though.  I liked seeing the Generals all get happy endings, especially Sasorina for some reason. She was my least favorite, but it made me happy seeing her as a teacher. Itsuki growing her hair out and sparring with her brother and the last scene with Futaba holding a precure Perfume was great. I really enjoyed HC and I'm sad to see it go, but at the same time I can't wait to start on Suite tomorrow.           She pulls off subtle lewd off pretty nicely     I'm going to pafu Pafu's pafus!        Everytime someone finished HeartCatch.   Proof there is a lewd god   Now neither of us will be virgins!   This movie's great.     Why do you all watch a show made for little girls?    topless mermaids  Nice.         Is that the Bandai Tamashii Web Exclusive S.H.Figuarts Cure Sunny?! Lucky!    Noise?!  This is the exact same plot as the HaCha movie...     mermaids aren't topless anymore  You had one job, Toei.    Is that a fucking Magikarp?   Well that was anti-climactic as fuck. At least Nico got a Dracky out of it, I guess.   Nico wants a dicky       The Smile movie was everything that I wish Smile had been.   The Smile movie was not particularly original in terms of plot, but PreCure movies usually aren't very original, and I seem to enjoy them anyway.   I liked Nico, and Miyuki's cluelessness was actually plot-relevant in a good way.          I wish Monkey Yayoi was my girlfriend.  Mana's going to marry  a deceased canine .   There isn't enough fanart of Mana being fucked by a dog    Is any Cure safe from dog love?   I kinda hope the lovely cats are safe from dogs.      saucenao   this work was deleted from pixiv  why      Little brown idols are the best.    pixiv   why  Because Japan.        I want Hime's cherry.   She's already given it away, and claimed to be giving it away a few dozen more times.    It was a play punch, really. I think they made that much clear.     I want to give her cute round belly.  Gokigenyou!  He's even doing the squat.   SLAV L A V        Wow you're pretty ignorant of Japanese culture huh?    I know what you're talking about. Still makes have a lel    interspecies couples is wrong that's why   I love this ending. The CG looks great. Did they do one with HapCha's CG? The HapCha CG had more texture and better colors. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qvw<wbr>g-qkjAZA</wbr>  [ ]    Yuri looks so out of place.    I hate it when people upload videos with 720p as an option when the original encode was shit to begin with.    That's because she looks so ay lmao     Doki has the best EDs, they are upbeat and the dancing is pretty good.       Erika remains the best.    I prefer the first ED to the second but yeah they're really good.   Can Ako twinkle?   Maybe in a few years, but right now she can only Muse about it.    Only for Souta.   Honoka is really cute.   She sure is.   It's a shame Toei rehashed so many designs from FW when they made SS. When you get past that it's pretty good and has a deal enough to set it apart from its comparative.   I'm sure if the MC and fairy designs were different then more people would give this season a chance.      The fairies looked different enough.        They should have given it some time before airing right after MH. I would have given it at least 2 to 3 years minimum.    I want to lick their collar bones.   Flappy sure did, the other one not so much.    Aside from the designs SS is pretty dank. I'm glad I chose this as my last season. Though, if I could I'd rather choose Fresh or HC. Oh well, this is not bad at all.      Will we ever get another subbed musical show?    It had some awesome fights and I feel like the dual transformation is good compensation for the lack of team members.        Why does Itaoka make the best transformation sequences?    Iona is my angel.    dual transformation is good compensation for the lack of team members.  I love it. I hate the bigger teams. I think 4 is as high as it should go, 2 or 3 is most optimal. I only gave a shit about half of the Yes 5 and even less than that many Smiles.   Now you'd think that I'd love Max Heart, but in truth it is my least favorite. Maybe someday we will get a Precure with just 3 Cures but I don't think Toei would ever want to give up the money you can get from shilling multiple Cures.        heart beat   Cannot be stopped. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KMV<wbr>TbAS1Psc</wbr>  [ ]    beat is not crash    resound  It's a shame this was only used like 3 times, it was a great idea: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2Q0<wbr>8us3GK_U</wbr>  [ ]   So how are you guys going on those coloring books?  For those who would be interested, CDJapan has the DokiDoki movie at 50% off (3800 yen, about $30). They only have one copy left. I'm passing since I just bought the HaCha movie, but maybe someone else ITT is interested.  http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/TC<wbr>BD-320</wbr>         knpk    mktn       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mfn<wbr>IpzoqpaQ</wbr>  [ ]   Daisuki Shin     earrings in the shape of her symbol  that's cute as fuck    Suite doesn't really have any wild boys does it, also what's up with Hakushaku, how does it fit the naming theme of Ouji, Baron, and Knight?  Rare footage of Cure kigs and Kamen Rider suit in the same place as Super Sentai statues. Also OBAACHAAAN  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yrY<wbr>T_-hvr_0</wbr>  [ ]     Yes, in fact I believe it usually translates as Baron itself.   Geez Kanade calm down.  Heartbreaker!  I wonder who that could be.      guys  We're all little girls    A Hummy note!  This is the cutest note!     Usually translated as Baron or Count.    Wait, why is the Rider there? Did the Beat costume get ruined or something?    I bought a 300 dollar tablet last week specifically so I could scribble all over those pages like with real crayons, but it just takes so long to color those things that I never finish one before I get bored.   I guess if I had to pick I would pick Kishi     mktn is the best.      Suite and OOO were on TV at the same time.     Not posting the shower gif  Why do you do this?     banana peels  kek     I don't have that one, sorry.      Look at this cute, cute, cute cat      This cat is cuter.    They always say the cupcakes are oishii, but all they're eating is the frosting.     Sonna banana    This bothers me too     That always bothered me when I watched it.     I too am bothered by that.     ayyyy lmao     Who the hell eats cupcakes for the actual cake?   Frosting is gross. There, I said it.  Time for summer uniforms!  Nine seconds in and we're already getting started.   Suite has some of the worst male uniforms I've ever seen.   I never would have guessed   And why do half the male characters have Hibiki's dad's faggy haircut?     faggy   Most of the guys in Suite come across that way. Ouji and his crew are the worst, but a lot of the others too. Not Souta though.        Hibiki's dad   You mean grown-up Rin?         Hummy yelling  Off-screen though   Hummy is a devil!         Not even Hummy can deal with their bullshit forever.     Now I'm kinda sad   Those two episodes were pretty sad.    I liked them, like a lot   That's just mean.   Two?       Man this super terrible Siren, literally the worst thing you've done.  Now that I think about it, Hibiki's family situation reminds me of Tsubomi's backstory, that made me cry a little too.     Isn't it a pretty common family situation in Japan? Everyone's always busy busy busy no time for the family. I don't like it.    I want to make Hibiki not alone by being alone with her all night    real Hibiki mama  Fucking great   We are not alone together     Lewd    Mix and match dildos   Suite had a kind of weird progression with their finishers.  They went from Passionato which needed both of them to do, to getting separate finishers with their Belltiers that they could use together, and now they combined them again for a duel finisher.       This was the best Suite finisher, yet the only used it about three times.     This mom and daughter pair are super pretty.  I really do live the Suite designs  for the girls.      Hibiki doesn't remember any lullabies by her mom    I want Hummy to fall into that pot and be boiled alive    Yup, two. But then you're probably realizing that right around now.   These last two episode have been really nice.   It felt like this was the moment Hibiki really came to life and became a much more profound and maybe even relatable character. It's a shame they didn't do the same with Kanade.   I love it when Precure makes me feel things  Absolutely love it.    One of my favorite Precure episodes.  Hibiki's mother is gorgeous.   well she sure as fuck didn't get her good looks from her dad    That would require some genetic relationship to her dad.     Kanade was a bitch to the very end.     I'm not sure I like what you're implying.   There are people who like David Production's anime. There's are people who think time stop isn't stronger than King Crimson or Gold Experience Reqiem. There are still people who don't think Heaven's Door isn't the most broken stand. There are people who still skip parts or don't read in order.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   New JoJolion translated today/tomorrow.

Email killahspectah@live.com.  Jebus is late edition.          Who would win in a fight, DIO or Eva-01?    Heaven's Door.      There are people who like David Production's anime.  What are you implying?      That it is sub-par and part of thread bait.       TV DIO's voice &gt;&gt;&gt; OVA DIO's voice<br/>   New season when?    David do well      Capcom Dio the best.      watching anime     Yes.      Never.   Requesting this picture but with "Yare Yare daze" instead of moonrunes!   If I were to nt do the opening vocals should i just record blank until then or actually start the recording at my vocals?    god these are so bad and unfunny   Website updated, how cute.   The OVA was directed better. It was devoid of stupid poses that don't make sense in context and had better tension building and pacing.    They're great.    That's not even what the moonrunes say.    How's this?    Whoa, David even copied the position of nearly every knife heading for Jotaro in the manga.    Fuck it!  Thanks so much, anon.      Not really, look again.    I don't feel arsed to compare every single knife but it looks so similar that I'm impressed that they tried since those knives are CGI.    In the OVA, more knives were thrown after that screencap, they were just aimed torwards Jotaro's head.     It was devoid of stupid poses  do you know what an adaption means?    I will have passionate, consensual, hand-holding, loving sexual intercourse with the first person that gets their hand on that damn Runaway Girl doujin and scans it.  I miss it already   I think he means that the OVA is just a better piece of visual entertainment ; it obviously doesn't adapt the manga well, but that doesn't it's bad.     but that doesn't it's bad.  it isn't good either, that grain scratches my eyes.     Go get someone who knows Japanese to bug the doujin writer. The book is out of print. Information is in the last thread.    So basically it's never ever    Most likely. So stop moping or do it yourself.    we could be watching the first episode of DiU right now    But DP need a break anon!    With DP's budget? Stardust Crusaders already showed that the budget was running out in the later episodes, and following that up immidiately the next week after with DiU would result in a really shitty looking first episode of Part 4.    No no no, I don't think you understand. They were SAVING the budget, for the part 4 finale of course.    I will do the same for whoever scans the Pucci and mob of faceless men doujin     OVA Dio looks better than both manga and anime one  You had one job, david     Post the doujin cover or a link and I'll see what I can do.    What up with the shitty face lines in the anime?     yfw 90% of the budget was reserved for animating Josuke's dog turd of a hair style     The same artist with a couple other people are releasing an r-18 anthology so you can always order that one if you want to.   So is Jonathan just a complete cuck?    Entirety of season 2 was bad and season 1 was mediocre. D'Arby the Gambler episodes were eye cancer especially with using storyboard frames for D'arby's defeat is an utter joke. The anime fucking sucks.     http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>2538422</wbr>   H O T P A N T S O T P A N T S          How? He did beat the shit out of the guy who tried to kiss his gf     Are you retarded or just an OVAfag?    As much as I loathe the OVA, it did D'Arby the Gambler and DIO's World pretty godd    I'm not blind, if that's what you're asking And as for that, I actually enjoyed David's Battle Tendency adaption more than the manga     Technically Dio is the cuck since when he has sex with women it's Jonathan's body that gets the sex.    GER is stronger though you idiot       It's okay Mr. Animeonly. You'll get the joke in 2020 or whenever part 6 gets animated.      jonathan's playing the long cuck       JoJo is great with their over the top handsome characters and DIO in the OVA really looks just like a normal anime villain guy      Jesus Jonathan looks like one of those faggot fuckbois that even the nerds in high school would pick on.    He's right. Those things stopped being funny long before that one was made and it's even worse for resorting to yet another lazy "Jotaro sure likes sea" joke.   So cute      stronger than time stop   le kill Giorno face  Complexity doesn't beat power to stop time.           Nah "read the manga" jokes are funny, that one is just shite.           What part of "resets everything to zero" don't you understand? Even King Crimson's time skip bullshit got reset to nothing so why wouldn't time stop.      In what way is GER complex. Even in the god awful translations its pretty laid out. It nullifies anything. It'd just undo the time stop as soon it was activated.        You can't reset things to zero when your user has died during the time stop.  Muslim and Buddists 1 - Catholics 0          GER acts independently of Giorno.     At what point did Giorno die during KC's time skip?    Who is the next purest JoJo after Jonathan?  DiU's budget went here.     Gappy, probably.     Kill GER then if that matters. Preferbly through timestop for more safety and so you don't get looped like a retard.        stupid poses  Excuse me?     But you can't kill him because the attack would be reset to zero.     How is it it going to use its ability when it dies before it can use it?     Don't even bother responding to that dumbass. He's literally just baiting you.   Part 4 anime when    "GER can survive timestop this guy is just baiting"  - /jojo/        old fat faceless men   add for ryonaket in sidebar      When David blows all their budget on buying the rights to DiU back from Warner Bros.   Why is Josuke so moe?      Could Tusk Act 4 be beaten by GER?  I don't think it's possible to reset 「Infinity」back to 「Zero」     Never.     Null infinity.     It'd probably cancel out and just turn the nails back into normal projectiles.     The leaked emails   Still waiting for a sauce on this.       this kills the universe     Possible.  It's just those things could tear through time stops and dimensions too.  Could Tusk Act 4 Escape a GER induced hell?  Then again I suppose Giorno can kill the will of the user to do such an act before he does it, but he's not psychic.           It's just those things could tear through time stops     GER can move in stopped time, but Giorno cant, during the time skip which acts similiar to the time stop GER was active so its not beyond a reasonable doubt that GER could act freely in the time stop    he didn't have to    During the final fight with Diego from Another Universe, Tusk Act 4 moves during the time stop.   Just like Jotaro could use Star Platinum during the Time Stop, although I don't think he has a limit on movement.      I'd go with yes on tearing a hole through ger hell, but only after a few thousand deaths for maximum Araki.   Never ever.   Even 「Infinity」 can be set to 「Zero」. If GER's ability was to reduce things until they became zero it, I think it would work on TA4, but it just sets it to zero. It would be neat to see TA4 against Green, Green Grass of Home, since it would be infinitely halving infinity.     Johnny would still shoot a bullet that spun infinitely, but it would never reach Giorno. It would reset back to zero just before it hit.    I will never understand the shadows on the noses     I really don't think King Crimson ever had the ability to stop time so I'd like to see some evidence.    Then how would you know what happens if GER or Giorno are killed before they can do anything?    Oops forgot about infinite rotation but it was more directed at GER.              0 × ∞   ∞ − ∞  You'd think these would set infinity to zero but they're actually indeterminate.      Warner Bros. was part of the group that made the anime. They claim copyright on most of the video content on Youtube.  The fact that they own part 4 is a good sign that it, too, will be animated. You guys are fucking retarded.      Truly this power of 「Lesson 5」    Thank you, Gyro      I want to bully Doppio.   in the shot where GER fucks up diavolo finally, everything is stopped, during the skipped time only king crimson can move, same as how the world and dio are the only ones who can move in his stopped time, but king crimson has more abilities beyond that, part V is a mess, and we must also take into consideration that every series the power levels rise at the end beyond what the previous serious had at their end, gappy could take on most of the jojos pretty easily     Let's be honest that was him skipping time and King Crimson is definitely not as strong as The World.      during the skipped time only king crimson can move  But that's wrong.     That would not be wise.    I will send my application tomorrow. Do we have to voice everyone or we can just pick who we want to sing as (TOMMY, CODA, Jin)?    Gappy has to rely on his plundering ability though and Soft &amp; Wet nowhere near as strong as Star Platinum. He broke his arm stopping Born This Way.     Can we include Mudas?      stand user using his stand ability in a stand fight  Shocking.      gappy   pure      I'm trying to say that Soft &amp; Wet isn't as powerful as you think it is. It's just that it's ability is just Heaven's Door levels of versatile and proof that you can't just punch your way through things.     stupid poses     I just want to see Highway Star get animated.   Reminder we won't see more brown qts  So what happened in that final fight between Dio and Jotaro? All he did was punch ZA WARUDO's leg and Dio exploded    THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MEN IN THE WORLD !!  kek      LUCY LAND       I couldn't forget someone like you even if I tried.   Damn, Karera's stand sure is wierd looking. What do you guys think?   Is her stand like Love Deluxe?    I like it, so far Part 8 stands have been boring looking.     requesting laughing burning chicken egyptian man   No, it allows a target person's hair to grow out of anything that they touch, within 80 meters of Karera. Once they leave that range the hair falls out.    Someone should cross everyone but Joseph and add Pucci_after there    I can't be arsed to cut out Pucci_After, but I can probably knock out the idea simple enough.    Oh never mind, there's one on google.    Cross out Jotaro and put a turtle over Polnareff's face.    Good      So the soccer twins are Rockmen and after Karera? Does that confirm she isn't a Rockman?     This makes me want even more for her to be a major ally so we could see it team up with S&amp;W and Paisley. The whole part is full of interesting stand designs that I can't help but wish would get a little more use.      The whole bruno being dead bit, made no sense. gio could regenerate bruno's body then have his soul pass into it, or fucking have bruno jump into the fucking turtle.    saved for future use, thank you very much     Looks like a hairy Stone Free.     It at least confirms that she isn't in league with those specific rockmen. I've always viewed rockmen as a species with several groups rather than as an organization.   So why was Dio dressed up like a banana?   If you have to ask, you'll never truly understand fashion, and not in the way those over on /fa/ bandy it about.    Vanilla Ice dressed him     so we could see it team up with S&amp;W and Paisley  I doubt Gappy would Karera anywhere near his pure waifu even if it's to help     Nigga cant into fashion after 100 years. Or blame Cool Ice for it.     jesus christ, their hands.    Gappy would probably just leave Karera with Joshuu or something.     Araki in charge of accurate hands and feet    GAY PRIEST CAN NOW GAY MARRY   He doesn't need marriage anyway.     every marriage ceremony he does for the next year   pic related       Not using the vector version of that pic   Also glad to see the general hasn't gotten removed yet.      His gay lover was dead anyways    It's the weirdest thing, the art books that are supposed to have his most impressive stuff always look like garbage, while the serial manga always looks really good. I dun get it.    I've always wondered- if a real life priest wore Pucci's cassock, will it be, according to whatever laws the catholic church enforces, a 'correct' cassock?    I dont think there will be anything gayer in Jojo than the Pillar Men. Not even an actual gay character.     I think these two girls would make excellent foils for each other though. It would be a wasted opportunity to not let them interact.   It's been some time since I read Part 3, but I just finished watching the anime adaptation of DIO's The World.  Is it me or DIO never said "CHECKMATE!"? Or WRYYYYY with the iconic pose? (He did say it on top of the road roller, for some reason)  Is this one of the cases where the fandom remembers everything wrong, Star Wars style, or David skipped it?         There's are people who think time stop isn't stronger than King Crimson or Gold Experience Reqiem.  Tusk is stronger than Time Stop. King Crimson counters time stop directly. Time doesn't matter to GER.         The first time your read part 3 was with the shitty B/W scans by any chance?    The WRRRRY is the "iconic" pose was HFTF invention, he says WRRRRYYYYYYAAAAAAH on the Road Roller, he didn't say Checkmate for whatever reason or "This, Kakyoin... is my World".    King Crimson counters time stop directly.  There's absolutely no evidence on either side of the argument to make this point and it depends solely on whether or not King Crimson can see frozen time with Epitaph to erase before a time stop would happen. Araki has never said either way, so it doesn't counter it directly. There's no answer at all.        Yasuho got butthurt just from thinking bathroom girl was his girlfriend when she first met him. I can only imagine what she would do if she saw Karera touching his dick now that they're involved.     whether or not King Crimson can see frozen time with Epitaph to erase before a time stop would happen  Why would Diavolo need to see frozen time?      Using the wrong scenes    Also nitpicking.       This, Kakyoin...is my World".  Shit, I was expecting that too, but instead I got  Yeah Kakyoin, taste My World lol now go die  It was weird.  he didn't say Checkmate for whatever reason  Fucking David.   It was  spanish scans. They had better quality at the time.            The OVA was superior for a very simple reason. Cairo actually looked like Cairo    I don't get what is so complicated about this. He doesn't need to see time stop, he just see's DIO teleport and knows that he doesn't want that, so deletes it.    I don't think the church would like a cassock that hugs your hips and ass all lewdly like his does.   So I'm reading Part 6, starting Bohemian Rhapsody.  Is it me or Hermes is the most useless character in the whole series? Holy shit, she hasn't done anything to help Jolyne; it's like she fucking dissapeared after Sports Max. Even Caezar was more useful. She doesn't even know about F.F.'s fights or Annasui being best character.     I'm pretty sure "This, Kakyoin is my World" isn't the way he actually said it and that's just how it was translated.     Annasui being best character   anon you are absolutely  right       She's a reincarnation of Speedwagon.    Because if he can't DIO stops time, gets close and kills him during it.   Except DIO kills him during Time Stop so his prediction would be "DIO's over there and then nothing". Epitaph shows him time as it will be and all he can do is fulfil premonitions to kill people if they're shown to die within it. Time ends for him if he's dead.       No, Speedwagon barely fights. He hasn't even killed anything.    Nigga, I hope you're not comparing fucking Hermes to THE most useful and loyal character in the whole franchise.    She gets a little more involved later on but her and Weather disappearing for along ass time meant I never cared about them too much compared to the other characters.    Well, what does Diavolo see when he dies? At an rate, he's gonna notice and skip over it.     WHY  is he so perfect      most useful      Annasui being best character.    Insinuating       He's responsible for the Speedwagon Foundation, and I think that's it.    Araki is doing the same thing in Jojolion right now.  tfw Hato will never be relevant       wanting at least 3 months for Hato chapters     Speaking of gay priest and Weather, how did Pucci manage to disguise White Snake as Weather Report? All I saw as an explanation was  Oh shit, it was an illusion!  Or was it just Araki being Araki?   Speedwagon Fundation, which is the reason the Joeastars have so much money. Without it, they wouldn't even have traveled to Egypt.  Also, he was pretty much the guy in charge of taking care of Erina and her family once Johnnathan was gone and Straits took Lisa Lisa. That means both financial help and taking care of child Joseph, who crashed a plane.

This doesn't really answer his question, since つゆ is just an exceptional case that has nothing to do with any of the readings for 梅 or 雨      I'm already about 2000 words into core 6k   is it really going to be beneficial picking up individual kanji learning this late  You've hardly started.        Just learn radicals.   Imperial finally cought up to the raws! So I'll be dumping the newest chapter, a bump or two would be appreciated.               I realized it was shit after the flashback to the MC's past and his brother being an edgelord. Did it get better since then? Also I forgot, can MC only hold a single power at a time, or can he store powers? Also, did the guy with the disassembly ability ever become relevant again?             can MC only hold a single power at a time  this, but MC is actually glasses-kun, they somehow changed that midway. Also this is now part 2 with a new MC Duo and yes, it's worse than before. I still have hope that Jin will be the MC for part 3 again.   Also, did the guy with the disassembly ability ever become relevant again?  yeah, but not much.          Hm, art alone is worth my time in checking it out and I've been hankering for a survival story lately. Thanks, OP      I'm glad that someone else will read it too now          part 2 with a new MC Duo  Yeah, I'm dropping it then, I hate when Manwha do this, and they do this way too often.  Cavailer of the abyss   Tower of God for a while   now this            absolute shounen angsty protag  ugh        Tower of God  This series is better than ToG even atm, not even kidding               And that's it already, pretty spooky   Does this have a plot?   yes, the first part had an actual plot, but now these kids showed up and find everything about the island out. That's literally what's going on now.    These boobs are surreal   http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/176/  FUCKING DROPPED  </wbr>   hello fellow otters!   see you next week   You should marry him   IS THIS THE FUCKING CLIMAX    how many weeks have we dropped this?   Tsugumi confirmed to be around 10 years ago  Told you, guys.    176.      Don't kid yourself nigga. He's gonna keep this shit going for at least 10 more years.        HERE WE GO AGAIN     CHEAP DRAMA GO!  I tell myself I'm gonna drop this shitty series. For some reason I never do.  How many weeks until we go back to the status quo?   the legend continues...   about time Raku loses his harem. Hope the Marriage partner is a genuine cool guy  Best thing that could happen is Yui realizing she likes Raku in a sisterly way and her exiting the harem, of coure that won't happen seeing as the marriage proposal is probably from some douchebag ntr acrhetype    believing it won't just go back to the status quo     I know i just want to dream anon, don't take that away from me     implying he even exists     Maybe, just maybe, she'll propose and then get rejected by Raku who is having a existential crisis about Chitoge and Onodera.    Astounding.   Woah timeskip?   Raku's head:  Chitoge likes someone   Yui will have to marry someone   Yui is going to marry Chitoge       This seems to be approaching the ending, I hope I'm right.   Did I do something   Is Chitoge retarded?    SEE U NEXT WEEK   Actual comment from my friend: "Nisekoi only has 12 episodes this time? I guess I'll just read the manga to get closure."    Hope the Marriage partner is a genuine cool guy   Actual, cool and nice guy in a harem? It's like you've never haremed before,anon. I bet you think this manga won't end with all the other girls deciding to love Raku anyway and remain forever virgins because nobody can replace them in their hearts.        Marika is the only one that deserves to win. She cares about every other girl's feelings and well being while not inhibiting her own happiness.  That being said, it is also the reason why she won't win because Japan hates perfect girls.       Implying it isn't Raku and it was set up by his father and the chinese midget      Raku getting close to Onodera   Raku conscious of Chitoge   Marika gonna die   Yui gets a marriage proposal. Marika saying ominous things about her   Tsugumi decides Chitoge is the most important when she's going back to America   Keep laughing, but this is definitely not going back entirely to status quo.           Komi will find a way.  I dunno how he'll do it but he will. I know he will and we will all be mad otters stuck here for the next 5 years reading this shit.       Please don't do this to yourself. You should know better by now   Will SHAFT eventually do justice to all these bath scenes? Kosaki already had her fair share of wet sexhair, everyone needs their own turn.   People also said that Double Arts wouldn't be cancelled.   tfw no more Fallan   tfw no more Sui            Yui has a job teaching 17 year olds as a 19 year old  AND HERE I THOUGHT THIS SERIES COULDN'T BE ANY MORE RETARDED           Holy shit that hair.       The loli meant there was a better candidate than Raku.    Have I got a series for you, it's called Pani Poni Dash.      no s3 announcement   I need Yui      Did something happen between Yui and Marika in previous chapters?   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1OPZh2OepUEqUR62CgkfU52Ja_ry2cx<wbr>M0kUdhXJwMhJ8/edit?usp=sharing</wbr></wbr>      Jesus Christ, kill it with fire.    Chapters 118-121 answers your question.   we all know this is going back to status quo in a few weeks .. right?   Is that what happens when you take off it's ribbon?    yfw the perfect candidate is Shuu   yfw he's the heir of some top-tier super sekrit mafia ruling the banks, governments and corporations     No Onodera this episode  Dropped.    Picked up.   Well, these last few chapters have cemented a gorilla end. Fuck everything.    Feels like it happened 5 years ago    Yui's feelings are not 「ＬＥＧＩＴＩＭＡＴＥ」   It's been like that for the longest time but all of this will be forgotten soon (once again) in order to keep the status quo for a few more years.   More on the way.     Himeko can you do the scared Kosaki in page 4?    Hmm, that's a strange one. How do you specifically want me to do it?       Yui you are never selfish and do what you want to do say no to the marriage   But I can't   Just do it faggot, do as I say   Okay  See you all in 3 weeks.        What the fuck do you mean told you guys, she was around since Chitoge was a kid.    arranged marriage   So I guess this kills the Yui off.     just her face, to use as an scared face reaction, doesn't matter if you cut part of her head because of the speech bubble      Alright. Seems easy enough.     ED card without sponsors soon  Yui is an old maid she never had any chance of even being included in a harem. She's too old to even have children with Raku. It would be like Maria winning in Hayate no Gotoku.  So according to yui, the best fit for raku would be Chitoge or Marika.   Kosaki is not even mention hah    kosaki BTFO     a marika/Yui/Chitoge chapter   thank you jesus, the plot will actually move forward this time.    50 chapter Mafia Gang Wars arc incoming.      Why is the last episode about Chitoge? I thought they'd do the Haru conclusion.     she's the main girl    As it should be.    Yes, if you read nisekoi, the plot does move forward very slowly. And with this chapter, since we have yui and marika, the plot will move ever so slightly.      v1    I keked so hard at this because it's true     v2      We all felt the same       v3 Final     So half the Chop Suey gang is pandas.       thank you based Himeko     Reminder that Yui, as part of the chinese triad, is complicit in human trafficking, forced prostitution, gun running, drugs, murder and black market medicine that actually kills you. And we're suposed to sympathize with her and care about her romantic life       Keep laughing  Yes, that's the plan.    Nothing else really worth making for now.  I'll be lurking the thread so if anyone has another request feel free.     The same can be said of the yakuza and the mafia, it's a wacky romcom don't think that hard about it.    Paula and Tsugumi have over 100 confirmed kills.      Oh boy, I can't wait for nothing to fucking happen!      To happen what?        Chitoge transparent please.     blanked out worst Onodera  kek    SHAAAAAAAAAAFT  For a sec, it looked like she was putting her hand in his pocket.  <br/>   <br/>     <br/>       Komi hypes chapter 300 as the last chapter   Marika died 20 chapters ago due to an accidental kiss with Raku-sama   Yui got married to colombian druglord   Tsugumi in a coma after getting shot in the Mafia Wars arc   Raku and his now smaller clique depressed as fuck   by this time Chitoge and Kosaki found out about both of them liking Raku   they decide to confess together and have him choose   Christmas eve huge party   Shuu invites everyone over because he wants to show off his brand new relationship with Ruri-chan   Chitoge and Kosaki follow Raku who was sneaking into a dark room   they find him and confess   both of them with the biggest blush you've seen in the series   "Sorry but, I already found the real key girl and it turns out she loves me as well hahahahah!"   he's holding hands with someone   never get to see her face   "EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"   Thank you for supporting us all these years! Be sure to follow Komi Naoshi's next series! (END)                   what chapter do I read from, following this episode?  I can't take it, I can't fucking take it. I need some closure in anime, the past two seasons haven't given me jack shit and I really need these creators to fuck off with open ended shit   she's only hitting ichijo because she needs to be the fucking man in this relationshit        If you want closure, you're in the wrong manga.    Remember all the Haru we got for the amount of hype Shaft did?    1080p Cleaned and Denoised    this is how s2 looks, now think about that fro a secong    Wait, they are actually 18?    17, second year of highschool     dude, dont play with me     They were 16 at the start of the manga and we've had 2 new years festivals so far IIRC. Their 18th birthdays should be soon assuming Yui's is a bit earlier than theirs. Their final year of high school is approaching.     which of these extremely attractive women should I allow to date me?   existential crisis      So does this mean  guys  roll with me hear  guys  does this mean that something will actually "happen?"            The end is near.   So no S3?   How can you even thing about this man      I shouted "You motherfuckers" when I saw that.   Holy shit the animators for episode 12 had some serious hair fetishes.   motherfuckers.   Who drew the end card for ep 12?   Komi.      Unfortunately, that's true...     implying it won't be like Savages with Raku being with both Chitoge and Kosaki     Everyone is retarded in this manga anon. The surprising thing about this is you without realizing.   I find amazing how the second season of the anime managed to throw the plot even farther away than Komi does on a regular basis.   This season felt like a bunch of OVAs airing once a week.     fucking this. so true ...    Best panel in the chapter.    And pls stay go.     <br/>   Kizu  HAHAHAHAHA Holy shit, sasuga Shaft      WORRY NO MORE ABOUT FILLERS. WE HAVE JUST SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED AN ARC.   It's an arc filler, nobody cares about Yui.    I wonder if Yui's agent loli is cute under her garment.    She's like 50 years old, calm yourself.    But anon, she looks cute.    S3 never Haru at the festival never     Haru winning the best girl contest never.    Didn't she did win a best girl contest on their high school against Kosaki though?    Yui is best girl, nee-sans need to win.    She did, in the wedding dress, and successfully got senpai to notice her.    She has even less chances to win than Marika.   Shaft really enjoyed making Chitoge look good this episode.    Yui chapter    Confirmed this year  Why only 12 episodes this season?   Said Anon many years ago.    Because Shaft noticed halfway through the season that they shouldn't have done a sequel to Nisekoi.   Do you hate yourself anon?  Do you read this as retribution for your sins?     Seriously   I feel like in harem series the characters are only 20% human. Behavior-wise I mean. Their minds have to change and warp to make them presentable to a large audience.   I'm shouldering Komi's fury after Double Arts being axed.    Seishirou a cute!   I rather liked Marika's insight this chapter. She's pretty cool when she's down to earth.  Raku should just say "fuck it, I'm mafia" and marry them all.     The only girl that really deserves Raku though is  Fuu.    HARU WILL WIN  Service Club's first request, its biggest request, and its final request The grand finale is about to come  Welcome to Yahari thread, enjoy your stay        Just look at him, no need to kill   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210928   WA2 OP   Fuck off, brainfucked retard      When I look at him I see 8man. They're basically the same character minus the social standing.   I want to kill this fucking cunt.   Good night, hope this proper thread will make it.      Now that's alpha.     How many times must we do this   Where are the fucking subs      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]  waiting for subs    Going off to gym bros   Just give up man, this is Commie's most ebin meme yet! They're going to delay the subs until god knows when or just not release it. Watch the raw, you'll figure most of it out anyway.    look at all that POWDER    edition       Why did we need a new thread? Since there is nothing to talk about other than "subs when?". Should have just waited till the subs were out and made a fresh thread then.   This anime made me lust after genuine things, not replicas and fairy tales.   But subs are already out    They're waiting for CR subs since Commie staff apparently is infected with a serious case of anal flu for trying to copy HS   Who else thinks that Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man?  Brothers?   good for you     &gt; Trying to deny the obvious   You're fun anon      hai!    She still likes Hayama.    Nothing about that bitch is genuine.   Singles and CR will release before commie   Some die-hard NTR fags and Hayato worshipers, and a handful number of retards who're actually suffering some serious reading comprehension issue  And then you know they will keep spewing same bullshit even after the series is over so who cares?      No one   Reminder that she will never ara ara~ at your dick and put her yuis to good use.   Genuine photoshop?    Doubles and there's no subs till monday.    Yukino has no feelings for 8man Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Am I doing this right?       Why do you need subs anyway, when all the key moments of volume 11 that are on anime have been scanned and translated already?       Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Iroha is falling for 8man in the most genuine way possible    WHERE THE FUCK ARE SUBS WHAT THE FUCK    I don't. I saw stream.    https://d.maxfile.ro/xwkbmrkjkw.web<wbr>m  If she had actually given us an "ara ara" in the episode I'd be dead right now.  How can 8man pick anyone but Yui knowing he'll have this to look forward to in a few more years?    </wbr>    lurk more    What, you mean by always pretending that she just wants his help to snag the Cunt?    Are all Irohafags this new?   Good Irohasu, everyone!  What is 8man trying to show us, /a/?   Blank paper.    I wish Yuimom had Black Hair    An exploitable meme.   Yukino - Linkin Park, shoegaze Yui - pop, chart music Iroha - boybands Sensei - dadrock 8man - emo, punk Haruno - indie rock, experimental Komachi - EDM Orimoto - pop rock, pop punk Saki - classical, jazz Saika - trap Ebina - metal, goregrind Miura - j-pop              Do you really think 8man is going to base on who he's going to pick based on looks, especially on what they might look like in the future?  He wants something genuine.     Commies translation status    Yukino totally listens to classical stuff     Out before FFF's.     Commie still being lazy shits   Where are those subs from that "only for the desperate" guy?     Well fff just released episode 4. They could catch up, you never know    Their mom&amp;daughter interaction is so sweet it's poisonous to me.   Is sensei really a japanese teacher? All she does is sperg over 90s anime, I think I've seen/read her talk about actual japanese literature like twice. The worst thing is she has shit taste, liking scryed and all.   Yukino need to see a psychologist, not involved in romance   Then why is she always shoegazing?    your brothers are long dead   So  8man  Wants something "genuine" but doesn't really know what that is. He probably seeks a friendship where everyone can be themselves, no facades at all. They can't.  Yui  I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  Yukino  Wants to stop chasing after her sister and become her own thing. Sadly, she's now chasing after 8man and doesn't realize it. Her mother is a bitch. Her sister is a bigger bitch.  Hayama  A cunt. Wants to maintain the status quo because reasons.  Irohas  Wanted the Hayama D, but couldn't get it. Now she just wants senpai's attention, but won't admit it.  Haruno and her fujoshi friend  Want to maintain the status quo of their group at the cost of the feelings of their members.  Did I get it right? I can't remember shit from S1, so I'll start reading the novels this weekend. Apparently, they skipped a lot of stuff.                  Implying music taste has anything to do with personality.  I'm pretty sure 8man's taste is diverse, he has 5-6 years to diversify his taste    Subs when?   I bet 8man listens to idolshit    Haruno did nothing wrong. She's a good sister who wants Yukino to stop being copy-pastenon     &gt;Yui   I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  I think its something about a dog.        You got most of shit wrong.    Hayama one is wrong, cunt  And did Haruno have a fujoshi friend?      Treats everyone like shit   "She just wants to help!"  Well, she's not doing a good job.       Irohas  Easiest way to spot a secondary     Shit, that was supposed to be Miura, not Haruno.  Haruno a shit.       &gt;Treats everyone like shit  Apparently exposing Yukino's dependency problem is bad now.     Orimoto is totally the girl from those old iPod commercials     Treats everyone like shit  Nice fanon. She is hard on 8man and Yukino. That's it.      LN gets translated   Suddenly, anyone who didn't bother reading them is a filthy secondary and no anime-only discussion is allowed  No, fuck you.  You don't go to fucking Rokujouma or Mondaiji threads complaining about secondaries; you just discuss what you know.       Holy shit. Really? That was a fucking joke. It felt like a shitty filler episode.    fuck you man fuck I didn't save the edited one     ? Ellen Feis?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l2-<wbr>UuIEOcss</wbr>  [ ]       Blogshit    There is no love triangle, there is no love triangle.   Romance isn't part of the story, Yui has given up on it and Yukino doesn't love 8man.     FTFY     Opinion on anime   blog  Guess this whole board is a blog now.      Of course the idiot who gets names wrong is the guy who actually falls for it when Haruno plays the villain.    ok   I knew this would happen. 8man didn't choose anyone in the end.  Also, Iroha isn't even in the episode.       "she's only PRETENDING to be a cunt, guys!"    Thank you     TLfag   I want to kill this cunt   IROHA OR DEATH  Are you?       Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it.  Yui hasn't done anything wrong!      you drunk?    Unlike Yukino Kazusa was an actual villain in her series.    IROHA AKBAAAAR     Wants to help her sister   Has to act like a bitch to do so   Nope, there's no other, more gentle way to do it!   Her sister fucking hates her guts now   "But guys, she's just trying to help!"  She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all.         Yes, that's what the author constantly points out. Are you retarded?     Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it   What did she do wrong?      I think my favorite was the brown haired girl from ww   Which volume/chapter have Yui moments?  I just want to read Yui moments and feel fuzzy inside.     I should go and watch that. I could probably download and finish all of it before subs come out.    I actually am    She manipulated her friends so she could get the D. Didn't you watch the last two episodes?  She knew everything that was going on but played innocent.        Volume 7    Apparently they share the same director   Anon subs pls  The world needs you now      She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all  Yeah, letting her spend the rest of her life as a spineless, parroting autist who can't even properly function in a theme park is less evil than hurting her precious feelings.     It's one of the few romance anime of the last years that are actually good.   what's the best romance anime of the past 5 years?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"   stop trying to fix shit that isn't broken, Haruno. you're not any good at it.      He likes Yukino so that's a given.    Nisekoi.    I'm disappointed in my old self for thinking this series was something special.    Natsuyasumi   What are the chances Yui gets heart shaped pupils if 8man started putting moves on her?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"  I don't even     Fireworks in Vol 4,5,. Alone time with Hikki in 8. Destinyland in 9. Aquarium/cookies in 11  All I can think of at the moment      Very bad shows in general, but I would say White Album 2 is really decent compared to others.    How about actually being constructive instead of just putting them down and making them feel like shit. That isn't helping them overcome their issues, that's just making them doubt what they have.  Even if she is just "pretending" to be an asshole, her way of "helping" them is still terrible. Sensei helps Hikki by giving him advice and setting him on the right path, whle also not completely coddling him and just doing everything for him. She helps the three grow through their issues. Haruno just walks up to them and goes "WOW LOOK AT THESE RETARDS CAN'T EVEN GENUINE LOL"      She wanted the D and saw that her friend is also wants the same D. So when there is chemistry between those two sparkle she quickly made a move to develop the relationship with the person she loved. And the person she loved agreed to it. I don't see anything wrong with that. Love is a competition ans usually wins the more brave one. That's how alfas get the girls while that omega normies who aren't blessed with 2D waifu are mopping, sulking and getting stuck in the friend zone. The only one who did everything wrong was MC who agreed to everything while loved another girl and cheated on his gf with her friend.    Was it wrong as you expected?  There are similiarities yeah but plot wise Oregairu is better than the mess WA2 became.   Never really got why people though Oregairu was groundbreaking; its a very well written series but it embraces tropes all the fucking time         WA2   Mess  I don't see any mess in this series. It's not that good, but I think is quite well done. Explain.      Fuck off    White Album 2.     omega normies  fuck off     You know it's true.    Okay, but not chitoge, fuck off pls    You can't name a single show that's better than Nisekoi faggot    But chitoge is best girl    no the white silhouettes with the colorful backgrounds    shitoge      All I can say is Touma looks way better than Yukino     speaking suspiciously like a 12 year old girl.  underage b&amp; nao      shittaste      chitoge   best girl   when Marika exists  Nope.       I disagree   who /skeleton/ here?   Literally any other show    Nisekoi is better than literally any other show, so checkmate    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]    That's fallacy    It's much worse than 虚無戦史MIROKU    Nisekoi S2.     I ready my chips but there are still no subs, how is it?   Regardless of tropes, I liked it better when it was The 8man Show.   where are the subs where are my fucking subs    I suspect skiddicks read the retarded anon filing a formal complain post      I feel sorry for you and your shit taste, anons.     commie what the fuck  1. Chitoge 2. Yui 3. Haru 4. Tsugumi 5. Iroha 6. Saki 7. Haruno 8. Sensei 9. Everyone else Power Gap  9999. Yukino 10000. Onodera               What have you done    Swap 1 with Marika and im okay with this   Commie I will NEVER download your subs again.   It's interesting how watching Nisekoi correlates with shit taste    is there any Iroha in it?    this    but Yukino was at the bottom where she belongs   HS when?   Commie are Irohafags  Deliver the subs bastards.    You're looking in the wrong medium if you want good romance.  WA2 is arguably the best though, followed by Yahari.      I bet you watch Nisekoi    Anon, what the fuck    Yukino should swap place with Onodera.   Toradora is objectively the best romcom of recent times.  Orange Road is superior, though.      You see Yukinoshita, this is how it's going to be     Agreed.    CC becomes a bit of a mess since they get hit pretty hard with some common dorama and k-drama cliches.   Girl leaves for different country because muh love pains   Girl decides to come back to 'settle her feelings' despite everyone knowing the truth   Drama ensues as everything starts getting fucked again   Introducing 3 heroines was also pretty unnecessary and takes away from the main story. Coda was decent though - too bad CC wasn't as focused.           Toradora   Not Nisekoi       Iroha's dead     Yes I do. I love harems, which is why I watch nisekoi and oregairu   Can't wait for the final episode! :)   theres no romance in nisekoi     Eh? Take responsibility?   I don't I'm the one you should be asking.      Then you have shit taste. Congrats   This series wasn't really a harem until Iroha got introduced.  Can I sue commie for this?   thread is now about nisekoi, wa2 and whatnot   Amazing how waiting for memesubs can affect people.     Read the LNs.     the theme of the series is wanting something genuine so desperately   not even the series itself is genuine       Shall I dump?      Dump Pan-san     Two girls aren't a harem. You don't count sensei.      love triangles end up with someone losing   Big surprise huh?      I would like compensation for their unprofessional behavior.    It was us that truly lost though     forgetting Kawasomething-san  Read the LNs.     yeah, but I can't help it; Oregairu is so funny to me     Has Haruno ever lied?   Read the LNs.     ACTUALLY mentioning Kawasaki  Saying "Read the LNs" doesn't mean your posts aren't retarded as fuck.    Only girl I care for in this series is Komachi. Will she pass her exams? Will she find happiness?   No never.   Are FEEL :  A) Iroha-fags   B) Yui-fags   C) Yukino-fags   D)   BUY THE LN-fags        Read the LNs.    When was the last time a character in anime didn't pass her high-school exams, specially when her brother is at that school?    D obviously    Nigga the enemy of the series was Setsuna.    Well maybe Komachi needs some suffering too in her life    see   The MC in WA2 was a terrible, generic, self-insert harem MC, and he's completely not likeable to boot. He is flawless in all ways, doesn't have a single original thought in his head, but still manages to come off as an idiot and an asshole, and if he rang true to you at all then you have terrible taste. WA2 was bad because MC was shit, end of story.      If you don't think Saki wasn't part of 8man's harem before Iroha showed up then you need to  Read the LNs.      E) All of the Above  E of course     Hai!     She wasn't.    She just wasn't.        F) BUY THE VN COMING OUT SOON     The worst thing was that the MC started out interesting: being popular, competent, and pretty intelligent. Then that all gets tossed out the window and he turns into a generic indecisive faggot.  I'd say he's even worse than 8man, who went from an interesting character to a wish-fulfillment one.       Read   the   LNs.      Has the OST for the anime come out yet?    Denial.     You need to  Read the LNs  denialfag    I'm not the one in denial, anon You still haven't Read the LNs, have you     FEEL is not one person.    Ya, I agree with this. The best MC scene in that show was in either the first or second episode when setsuna comes to the council or committee or whatever and says she doesn't wanna be the girl, and MC lays down the law. At that point I was like "okay, I'm on board." But that was the last time he had a character.   I guess the part where he climbed out the window was okay too...      Without going full "read the LNs fucking secondary" (because seriously, I wish I had time to read 11 volumes), HOW is Saki part of the harem.  What did she do in the LNs that she didn't in the anime? Did she EVER show ANY signs of having ANY kind of interest in 8man?  No, don't give me your ultra funny "read the LNs" answer. Seriously, just what was so different with her character?  inb4 you answer "read the LNs" anyway because you're a smartass  Seriously, only Yaharifags are this rude. Not even JoJofags are this retarded over original material.          meant for        I wrote all these posts.       yfw CR releases in less than 10 hours  Commie BTFO.   I know they are delaying this on purpose, but I think it's gone on long enough. Just give it to us, please.   An "s" at the end of nouns signifies plural and so does the word "are", you fucking troglodyte.    You're just asking for it. Read the LN's     There's a lot more development for her in the LNs.  If you read it you would know. Don't talk like you know shit when you don't  Read the LNs.        After solving her family issue, she's all dere dere on cram school and haunted house.    yes     There's a lot more development for her in the LNs.   Examples?     She had en entire volume dedicated to her, the funny thing is that in it she  Read the LNs     Read the LNs.    why a drink?   Who would take losing the 8bowl the worst, Yui or Yukino?   HS subs are going up before Commie     She acts dere   People consider her part of 8man's "harem"   Even though there are people who DON'T believe Iroga is part of it  Why?       Barely anything happens with her. She has very little interaction with him to make her a real contender.  8man says he loves her jokingly one time and she gets all flustered        The waifufags    Yukino likes Hayama, for fucks sake.    Yea You can find them in the LN's     /a/ would lose either way    Iroha is clearly just a golddigger there for 8man's future editor money. That's why.    Yukino would double down on the snow queen act if she loses. Yui would just find some other guy that would probbly be a better match for her than 8man anyway.    Who even cares??  Yukino end is bad end. yukino is a psycho, strange girl.  Listen to how she parrots 8man word for word , on the phone with Haruno.  Listen to how she almost lets Yui railroad her -- and then, when 8man firmly objects, she suddenly follows suit.  She looks for someone to depend on for everything. They become responsible for her well-being. I bet even her current "personality" is really just a carbon copy of Haruno's.  TLDR: ERASE PSYCHO BITCH YUKINO.    YUI END BEST END.                   Fucking hilarious, man. My sides are in orbit. The read the LNs station. What's next? Posting it AGAIN? I love this Read the LNs meme!         Any subs would be nice at this point.

Read the LNs.    Yui would get really hurt and might be scarred for awhile  Yukino might an hero if he rejected her at this point      no habla espanol :(     filthy secondary     It's "no hablo" you fucking imbecile.    Why don't you stop whining and  read the LNs?     Read the LNs.     Don't. Please. I beg of you     People are saying Yukino but she's only been in the running for a short while now. Yui has been in it for 2 years and there has been a great effort made towards building up her suffering and ultimate heartbreak.  If you read her diary entry prologue it's clear that she's absolutely terrified of making the wrong decision and losing.      If Komachi doesn't pass. I'll personally pay a visit to Watari and, let's just say, theoretically, he'll be submerge in wet concrete until it become dry cement.     What if they're a grill?     Who the fuck cares about your stupid, dead language    People who defend Haruno's completely uneffective way of educating Yukino, just because her intentions are supposed to be good   People who think Saki acting dere means she likes 8man and not that being dere is part of her character   People who think Iroha acting dere means she's just like that, but doesn't really like 8man   People who will answer READ THE LNs to every single question ever made, even though it's a show from this season, finally making the sentence in question a fucking meme   People who want Komachi to suffer and not just be THE supporter of 8man   People who want this to go the WA2 way.   People who think every person with a different opinion or theory over the characters is a secondary   No discussion allowed; time for waifu battles and memes  I miss the S1 times.  I really miss them. Everything has gone so wrong since then.             I said I couldn't speak Spanish you jerk    spontaneously just found a reason to like Iroha     subs when  How much better would this show be if the characters would just sit down and actually talk to each other?   That's not even the point of his post you stupid fuck. He means you can't categorize FEEL only liking one girl, like you can't /a/    Then don't try.    Read the fucking LNs   I'm actually secondary too     One day you'll have to come to terms with the fact that not everyone is going to spoonfeed you stuff whilst browsing /a/, and no amount of calling it a "meme" will change that.    How the fuck do you solve a love triangle by just talking it out?   Rewatching S1 while reading the novel side by side, I can't make any sense of this scene, what is the truth?   As I let out a deep and heavy sigh, I looked around the window of the now deserted classroom. Yukinoshita had been standing there just a while ago.    It wasn’t even two metres between where Yukinoshita had been and the seats Yuigahama and I had been sitting on. Yet for some reason, it was hard to cross that looming distance, and I could sense an unseen line drawn there.    It would not be long before the two of us discovered what exactly stood between us – or rather, you could say, the truth.           Discussion is now spoonfeeding  Stop using buzzwords you don't understand.   Are you that drunk guy who thought someone was blogging? Stop it, dude.        I imagine thats what will be happening from now on    You've seen the light. You can't leave the ship now or ever. Irohasu~      HOLY SHIT IT'S A HAREM LIKE, SAKI WAS DERE THAT ONE TIME A SHIT TON OF TIME AGO IN A SIDE-STORY  IT'S A HAREM YOU FUCKING SECONDARY READ THE FUCKING LNs LIKE LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE            People thinking Yukino will win   People thinking it won't be open/friendship end   You should add that to the list       No one is doubting that Yui wouldn't be absolutely crushed by it. She might even find it hard to love again for awhile but she is far more stable than Yukino. She has friends and family, Yukino has 8man and Yui.   If Yui and 8man got together it would hurt her too much to become an outsider to some of the only human relationships she has, not to mention the heartbreak of losing her love to her best friend.  People are completely ignoring that this triangle might get bloody and hurtful.        maybe if someone would actually admit that they like someone else that would set something in action. Also this doesnt only apply to the love triangle    Your anger amuses me.    Reallistically speaking, even if someone "wins", I don't think neither that person nor 8man can handle being in a relationship.  Not to mention 8man would have to endure Haruno's bullshit all the time if she ever dated Yukino, even though Haruno said she'd be friendly and invite him a drink if he dated her sister.       Retards. Denise Milani is all natural     Read the LNs.     rude  read the light novels fgt     A love triangle can be a subset of a harem you fucking mongoloid. Learn some basic set theory.     an hero  If Yukino attempts to an hero off a building I will shoryuken her so she can fly back to her apartment while she fall off her apartment     Did someone say set theory?    99% of the show is the characters sitting down and talking.  The problem is that they prefer to make vague analogies, deep commentaries and hypothetical situations instead of actually saying what they feel, which is kind of unrealistic for teenagers, but this is a LN, so I guess no one really cares.      Read  the  LNs.   we're not going to spoonfeed you           Believe me I don't, I mispronounce everything in that shitty language intentionally    Spoonfeed me what? I didn't ask anything.  Did you just want to post your meme?      Who? The tits are fake for sure.     The point is that there is actual evidence to say Yui would take it the worst where as with Yukino it's all speculation based on how little we know of her problems.    Yui definitely listens to pop punk/girlpunk, just look at her phone. Top 40 girls don't usually go in for the pink skull and bones motif. I guarantee you Pink is her favorite artist, bar none.    Read the LNs.    But I need my spoonfeeding!    Yukino knew about the car accident that brought the 3 of them together.     It reminded me somewhat of House.   Genius(?) antihero with issues   Problem of the day   Antihero saves the day through means everyone else disapproves of   Antihero is proven right again and again            he still didn't read the LNs     やはり俺の青春ラブコメはまちがっている。 第11巻   Im going to spoonfeed you, google it and  Read the LN faggot   if you can read moonrunes      The subs. The path we all walk. Blind man who told the directions, left unpaid by sand. Oh sand, the sound of sand. Music that I became to love. Mirage before me, the goal behind me. Or it is the other way? Has that march changed us? And the wheel keeps turning. Crushes the old and rise the new.     he still didn't spoonfeed me the things I didn't ask for     Read the LNs.    Some model I fapped furiously in 2007. People claim her boobs are natural including herself and some industry guys, but whatever works for me    Spoonfeed me.    Those waiting for commie cares.    Well, are you the one dude that barges into the threads of every anime based on VNs, LNs or manga, refuses to read the source material and demands people fill you in on what happens in them?  Because those are pretty much the worst people on /a/.     Reminder subs have been out for a while now   http://animeflv.net/ver/yahari-ore-<wbr>no-seishun-love-comedy-wa-machigatt<wbr>eiru-zoku-13.html</wbr></wbr>       Saika - trap   this nigga      you mean this Spoonfeed ?    Spanish subs left some things vague and parts untranslated at all.    Okay, you are right on the fact that we have pretty concrete evidence that Yui would take horribly. We also know she tried to stop all romance in the club in order to not lose.  Yukino is very unstable and in love with him, speculation says that those types take shit the worst. We see how losing Hayama in elementary school fucked her for years, losing 8man now might shut her down for good.       Read the LNs.      http://animeflv.net/ver/yahari-ore<wbr>-no-seishun-love-comedy-wa-machigat<wbr>teiru-zoku-13.html</wbr></wbr>   spanish. worst subs ever. even though i know spanish, i preffer commie's      So you prefer Cuba?    Read the LNs.     Streaming   Spanish   Spanish Streaming       Worse people are the ones who think every person should read 11 volumes just to ask a question.  No, wait, there are worse people. Those who respond "read the LNs" to people who did actually read them, but wanted to ask about something they didn't understand. I've seen this happen in both Fate and JoJo threads, but people eventually reply because you know, discussion. You can't reply "no man, go read the manga again, I won't spoonfeed you Made in Heaven to you!".  That doesn't happen in Yahari threads.       Mouth of an ogre and a crow inside the mouth. Where subs, I asked. The crow with the human eyes tells words with the snake's tongue. Words like pebbles falling on ground. The tower before me. The tower of lies we all have to climb. However before the top, we meet the ground.     subs  Read the LNs.     8man sure know how to hide his power level. Will they still like 8man if they know how much of a Precurefag he is?   Read the LNs.   subs where   Where can I read Vol11 then faggot?    Ctrl + F   Read the LNs   30 ---- 315/48/83      That's the problem with general threads. Shit that's asked has been discussed among the regular circlejerk a billion times. Generals basically just make this place animesuki except without the convenience of post permanence.    That translation is horrible. JKAnime's is better, but also bad.   What the fuck do these Commie self-entitled weebs have to do better than producing subtitles for the last episode of my fucking addicting chinese cartoons?  This is not like Communism is supposed to work, work your asses of for the purpose of my enjoyment, you fucking proletarian scum or provide me a bottle of XO Rum already, how the fuck am I supposed to spend my time otherwise?    It's the hottest meme now, right next to "I want to kill this fucking cunt".  Can't wait to post it in every single thread of anime that has fan-translations! I bet Rokujouma threads will be full of LN-readers master race!      She turns into a dere mess at the cultural festival after 8man casually shouts "Love ya Kawasaki!"  Clings to him in the haunted house during the Kyoto trip.  Gets all embarrassed when she tries to explain why she thinks 8man would be a good candidate for StuCo prez at the twitter psy-op planning meeting  She even makes an offer to let him come play with Keika more when they meet at the community center. With how Saki feels about her siblings, that's practically her begging 8man to go out and buy a ring.           Yui is emotionally stable. Losing Hachiman would hurt her yes but eventually she can move on. I think Yui has grown a lot since the time she though Hachi and Yuki were on a date back in s1; she's fully aware of Yuki's feelings for him and yet she always tries to get Yuki to move forward (see all of Ep 11). At the end of the day, she has a stable life with her only real problem is not being with Hachiman  Yuki is an emotional blob at the moment; she has no support structure outside of Yui/Hachiman. Hachiman is probably the only guy in the series that we've seen that can support her (yes she needs to be independant but she doesnt have to revert back to S1 loner status. There's a happy medium here ). I think she'd take losing harshly  If Hachiman gets rejected by Yui and Yukino (hypothetical), he always has komachi. Even when he was a loner at the beginning of the series, he was still emotionally stable. Partly due to his sister that he dotes on         I agree. Yahari threads went to shit when they became a 24/7 thing. Things like Highschool DxD, DanMachi, Shin Maou, Spice &amp; Wolf, Blade Dance and Mondaiji-tachi all have translations, but you don't see people demanding everyone to read every volume just because they're available, simply because the threads aren't THAT common.  Actually, it's kind of weird how JoJo has 24/7 threads, too, but people answer everything anyway.  I want Yahari S1 threads back. This thread is buyfag thread-levels of MAD right now.         hottest meme right now  When has it not been the hottest meme?      he always has komachi  Taishi would like a word     Sorry Anon, he's gone.    And you're completely forgetting that one of the main plots of the story is Yukino learning to be her own person. To argue that she'd be unable to cope is basically saying that the character development she needs will never happen, and Oregairu is going to end with "Haruno was right".  Whichever girl wins, it won't be the end of the world for the other, and if you think otherwise maybe it's time to  read the LN      Saying "read the LN" should really be reserved for things that only happen in the LN. Questions pertaining to the adapted parts should be fine to discuss.   Yukino needs to lose hard in order for her to grow out of her dependency issues. Just like toujo aya.    Maybe things might get dramatic on Yui's side, but Yukino's current family drama is completely divorced from whatever feelings for 8man she might have. So is 8man's, whatever romance stuff is happenin in his head is still completely secondary to him just wanting to get closer to both of them and to reach a genuine friendship with them.  Even with Yui, her problem is actually not being honest enough with her feelings and trying to shut them away to not hurt the other two. It's still a little hard to say how specifically she'd react to 8man and Yukino admitting they like each other, whether she'll react super badly before deciding that she still wants to continue her relationship with them (if it doesn't hrut it's not genuine etc etc) or she'll try to shut away her feelings behind a smile before 8man and Yukino convince her to finally open up about her own feelings.  Or it'll all take place AFTER Yui's character arc has finished and she'll already be acepting of (and still obviously hurtby) the fact.        rated by LN readers    Nope, gotta read all dem 11 volumes, you filthy secondary!   Then this communist bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “Though thy crest be fat and greased, thou,” I said, “art sure not deceased, Ghastly smug and oldfag High Priest wandering from the Eightly shore— Tell me what thy translation is on the Eight’s near-Genuine shore!”  Quoth the High Priest “Subs no more.”        Honestly, I'm not seeing any romantic attraction from Yukino's side to 8man. I don't think 'losing' would do anything, unless you refer to 'losing' his friendship.   She really gives a poorfag vibe now   Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing　in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making. So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it.   8man: You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now.   Yukino: Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad.   Yui: I wouldn't be happy with it...   Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai... So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer?   Is the azw-epub version of v11 not available yet?            Yuu x Mika   Fujoshit chart     Anyone have webm for this scene?   But 8man's methods were actually wrong and literally the entire second season has been about making him realise that  Hell, even the first season didn't hide the fact that 8man's lifestyle was legitimately just making him more miserable, though since it all takes place from 8man's perspective it was still easy to fall into the "he's the protagonist so what he's doing must be right" mindset       Hachiman x Yuki   8man can barely stand Haruno and Yuki's mother. Yuki is too reserved to do or talk about anything. 8man doesn't know how to handle a relationship with a girl his age. They both spend their time reading.    Hachiman x Yui   8man can't deal with Yui's excessive energy and can't deal with her group of friends that include the kind of people he dislikes   Honestly. only Saika is a good option here, just because he doesn't seem to have any problems at all when talking to 8man, and 8man wants that trap D. He wants it BAD.          Read the  LNs.     Does Hachiman like Yukino or Yui as romantic partners at all?   zaimokuza is a fuckin underrated bro   This singularity is even better than the Saturn rings and the deep space travel.

Cause if that's what Subaru genuine wanted, they wouldn't have been able to retireve the last fragment and eventually Earth would be kaplutz.    How wrong is the science in this series? I missed all the astrophysics discussion while it was airing and I can't into astrophysics.   They didn't really bother with science all that much. They referenced it but in the end it was all magic.    Nanko, no matter what form I take, you'll always be the true Houkago no Pleiades.   Seriously? What the fuck?      The referenced real and interesting things however. While not very accurate, it was nice to recognize stuff that other anime never reference because the writers plain don’t know anything about that stuff, here they made their research. Things like Tyche are a nice touch, and that episode’s time dilation was even pretty accurate, comparatively.    Minato-kun   Black holes are way brighter than that, Japan fucked up, did they even watch Interstellar    hetshit  This garbage deserved to bomb. Hopefully gainax fucks off for good now.     More accurate than in most shows. They got the effects of traveling near light speed fairly correct.     I wonder what being sat on by Itsuki feels like.    Is that what makes a Subaru a Subaru?     Shit, I'm not the only one who thought of that. Imagine if all stars were described that way, you could misinterpret it as a sky full of dead babies.    tfw your AotS is a car advert and anyone who didn't watch it thinks you're trolling    It's okay anon, we can be anime hipsters together.    see on the news 72,000 Subarus recalled this morning     2015   not a fake-ai hipster       lack of love     Maybe they're recalling them back to the Big Bang.    Stars are said to represent dead people since a long time anon.    He'll be back!    Bones has been pretty solid this past year. Maybe they could make another sequel that doesn't suck.    The science was surprisingly correct     They got time dilation pretty accurate (although that may have also been a reference to Gunbuster) and the effects of traveling at near-lightspeed. They even mentioned Hawking radiation in the last episode.      mfw I was able to persuade a friend, who isn't into mahou shoujo to watch this, and he liked it.     They're going back to their own universe.   We'll never listen to Stella-rium again ;_;   I couldn't believe that it wasn't used as an insert song at the end or something.    I wanted the ED of the ONA.   Anyone else immensely unsatisfied with Minato's end? Everything else was great, but Minato being forced back with promises of more kissu just to wind up forgotten and comatose was fucked up.   Subaru is a cruel person.    He had tears in his eyes, somebody in the last thread pointed out that that's a sign that he's probably going to wake up soon. Plus his respirator was off.    Still no kissu action.    Yeah. It would be nice to see him and subaru meeting again though. But we can believe that they will. After all, if we don't see how it ends, it hasn't became something, so the potential for them meeting remains in our hearts.  I would like a little on ova maybe, but it was still a good ending. Also-when subaru returns to her own world, she arrived back at the same day ep 1 was at did she, and the differences in everyone was because of the different worlds right?        I personally think that if she met her own universe's versions of the pleiades, there's no reason why she won't meet Minato as well. Plus he stole her purity, she won't just let him off that easily.    So, is Subaru's fate to become a burglar, since she doesn't seem to be able to leave any door locked?    Constant handholdings, hugs, eyefucking   Subaru wearing his jacket   2 kissu   in a fucking mahou shoujo anime  Eh I'm satisfied with        Subaru was a great MC.   Kissing? In my moe moe anime?  Chart anon, where are you?   Dropped.     not having Stella-rium on your phone, and listening to it when you go out  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GNk<wbr>PJvVEm0s</wbr>  [ ]   Not really, we saw him crying so he was   probably   no longer in a coma, so he might meet Subaru again someday.           the differences in everyone was because of the different worlds right?  Yes, that's just how the girls looked like in her timeline.     Because of this scene we will get zero doujins.    And zero porn. Thank god for that.    Let's be real here this show was never getting any doujins      Thank you, Sakurako.   I tried.   Why not using this?    I wanted to have all of them twice of course! I wanted to count the dying of the potential threads relative position on the timeline to real extinction events. So I needed the entire line to be visible.     Let's be honest, no-one watched this show, except for us.    I watched it too!    Then remove characters, they ruined your image     Minato is cut in half in that one.     So much death and despair on this picture. So many branches that end in nothing but darkness.    Anyone has all the end-cards? The HS release didn't have those and I want to fill my Pleiades folder.   One of them is you slipping on a soap.   Hestia forever.      Actually, World break considered success, to the point that the author celebrated it on twitter.       The original wasn't made by heph, retard.    [x] rape the barmeido    they were sex partners before  with hermes     Production got dull after MINOTAUR   Fuck EVERYTHING    To get Futabu uncensored.    ITT: Gays in denial    The anime? Probably not going to happen. Fakku is uncensoring the doujins though.      Why yes. I have a successful/active social life, with anime balanced into it in.  Why must your turn this place into a house of lies?     Ask him to draw balls   Next week: Back to the swirly-haired pirates!  What if the whole clan of D were like the original progenitors of Devil Fruits or something. Like by birth or through some method of cultivation. This would speak in favor of D = devil.  Having the WG take them out, lead to death of this secret and instead started spreading these fruits as temptation of power (like how biblical devil offers eve the apple), to perhaps one day fight the WG again. What if the DF's are the main part of the equation of the will of D.     if the marines refused to use them and were made primarily of haki/rokushiki users like vergo or garp I think you would have credence but it's way too unlikely they would rely on so many devil fruit users if they knew how dangerous it was to them.     dropped        Brook (Austria)  You know rest of the world. Austria is more than Vienna Opera Ball and Mozart.     Tickets are up for a few places, anyone planning on going?  http://www.nisamerica.com/pressrele<wbr>ases/LoveLivetheMovie_theaterinfo_2<wbr>0150626_v5.pdf</wbr></wbr>     tfw no showings near me     Not traveling to the closest location  Do you even love live?     But the closest one is near Detroit and I don't want to die just yet.    I was about to post the same thing.     no showings in the 5000 kilometer radius    So how many chapters do you give before All Might dies?   most likely just japan since they are most likely are different economies that work separate from each other, japans too busy worry about its own problems just like most likely any other nation. America would probably be more used to the super powers and further developed due to the concept of heroes and heroics already existing. other places like Russia and china are probably fucked up    That would be the best thing.  Also, that reminds me: do you guys think Icyhot will give himself an actual hero name once he stops being the mope master?       I don't think having All Might die would be a good move for the story's purpose. He provides a very crucial and important part. All Might, allows for our heroes to be in mortal danger yet safely as their life line. This means that our cast can lose, get beat on and almost die. If you remove the safety net that is All Might, then there goes all the fucking tension cause then you KNOW nothing truly bad could happen.   All Might is also the voice of adults in the series. Adults and kids have different concerns and views, All Might is the speaker box for the adults and the link to the kids in the class. Not to mention the most obvious role All Might provides; he is the force that keeps Deku driving for more.  Killing All Might would be too edgy of a move, and the pin point that this series starts going to shit. Only people decriept of imagination would want such a ham fisted ass pull like killing All Might.  All Might is a better character kept alive than dead.           Where'd all the hype for this manga disappear to, I remember there was a thread almost daily pre-golden week. Now unless its a chapter thread we barely reach 200 posts.    I think that there are still pretty large thirds when the spoilers come out around Wednesdays, there is or was some anon who did live translations of the Chinese spoilers or something, so people generally have discussed what they intended by the time the fallen angels translation is out    only country in the world making fuckton of fantastic porn comics   censoring everything   Will Japan ever quit being a laughing stock?      Better question, why the fuck did censorship become this horrible in the last two years?.    Olympics    Olympics coming to Japan. They're trying to clean up a bit for the incoming tourists so they don't end up looking like hong kong did. </blockquote>]
