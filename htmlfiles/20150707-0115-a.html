The question is will she be able to top Nami and Robin in lewdness?  <br>Robin is lewd, but there is nothing lewd about Nami. <br><br>She's a slut that would fuck a aids ridden fat old guy for money and her bitchy attitude is a turn off.</br></br></br>  <br> I wish to know how many of the people/crews on the island will pledge allegiance/fealty to the Strawhats and/or Law Pirates <br>All of them. Though there will be various degrees of honesty and tsun about these pledges.</br></br>  <br>CP0'S GONE. THEY LEFT DRESSROSA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARC.</br>  <br>I just hope for a different body type. Flat or fat, loli or granny, lewd or not, I don't care, I'm just tired of hourglasses.</br>  Well Doffy brought up some secret the Gorosei are keeping under wraps that he was after.<br><br>Also the implication that the ope ope fruit was used before to make people immortal kinda hints at the Gorosei being alive since the void century. <br><br>Also the D clan thing would be interesting to hear about more.<br><br>Hopefully Dragon will now pop up in the story more since we have Sabo reconnecting with Luffy.<br><br>I think that realistically the Big Mom situation will make the strawhats rush off the island real fast so we won't get much in the way of exposition and small talk.<br><br>I'm hoping that Jinbei catches up with the crew since he's awesome and it's about time he joins up proper.<br><br>On top of that it would be good to find out about the remaining admiral and shichibukai and see Akainu react to Fuji's behavior on Dresrossa.<br><br>No to mention that it's a perfect time to introduce Kaido as he reacts to the SMILE operation being wiped out by the strawhats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   sabo doesn't murder burgess <br><br>o-okay</br></br>  God I wish you newfags would just realize the truth. I don't know why people still watch this series. Every arc is just a ripoff of a Disney movie. Do you people really like this?  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656377 <br> tripfags </br></br>  <br>Hopefully more about the Will of the D.</br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br><br><br>I like how Law becomes utterly confused with the chaos that is Strawhat, but ends up being overpowered by Luffy's will anyway. I almost want him to stay as the only sane member of the crew just to watch him go nuts and try to keep up because "I owe this kid. I owe this kid. God, I owe this kid. WHY" Not gonna happen, though. He has his own crew whose hearts I don't want to be broken.</br></br></br>  what if luffy grew up around doffy instead of shanks?  <br>Law doesn't owe him shit</br>  <br>Well, maybe. It's just fun to think about.</br>  <br>He would be just as insane as he is now, just not as nice.</br>  <br> <br>Kid sure is a lewd girl</br></br>  we need to know more about that secret national treasure in mariejois.  <br>You have plenty of time to guess cause we're not seeing it until the Reverie most likely.</br>  Hardcore Chopper.   "Quick Robin, distract them with your fat tits!"     <br> that hammer going through the trophy </br>  <br>i need some nude filter action like with nami and rebecca</br>   Robin qualified for dominant lead heroine <br> you will never have even an alternate universe manga with Robin as the lead heroine <br> Robin wont guide your way in that manga </br></br>  I'm supposed to be watching OP with a friend so he can enjoy the series (I already read the manga), but I watched the Davy Back fights without him and don't wanna rewatch them. It's been a while since I've been through that part. If we just skip that part and jump straight to aokiji, is there anything my friend would be missing out on that's important? I don't remember Foxy having any point at all besides silly fun shit.  <br>Then One Piece would be about the Sunglasses Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy, wielder of the Ope Ope no mi.</br>  <br>I mean I guess not anything crazy, it's an off part of the story but I feel it's still pretty crucial to what One Piece is<br> Kuzan ties together the long ring island arc and you would just be skipping the meat in the middle <br><br>But up to you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you just have him watch that part without you? Or fucking whip out your phone or something and dick around while he watches, I dunno, man. Why deprive your friend from any element of One Piece just because you already saw it.</br>  <br>Skip it it really doesn't affect the story in any way</br>  <br>Anime actually makes Kuzan happen on a separate filler island, so skipping to him would literally leave out nothing of the Water 7 arc.<br><br><br>I told him he could borrow my dvds but he was the one that suggested skipping it for now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, there's that fight with Aojiki right after<br><br>It introduces some of the bigger concepts for the next arc and backstory for others</br></br></br>  <br>Such as? I can't remember the details, it's been a long time since I read through water 7. That's why I asked.</br>  <br>poor Romeo looks like a piece of paper<br><br>Why doesnt Barto get Dynamic Abs Shading Toei?</br></br></br>  <br>love where the budget goes to</br>  ITT : Stuff that Oda manages to hide perfectly<br>Her being a mermaid</br>  <br>Sabo?</br>  What if the Strawhat is One Piece?  <br><br> Recently reading a physical copy of the manga at the library for kicks <br> Read one of Oda's answers to questions <br> One of them mentions how hidden behind some promotional text on the cover story for ace's grave there are three sake cups </br></br></br></br>  Start getting hype.  <br>Sanji's eye<br><br>no one had ANY idea what was going on behind that fringe until Oda decided to move it</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy versus Drake imminent?<br><br>i'm down</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy ripping Drake's jaw off in g4 confirmed</br>  <br>Law being a D?</br>  <br> ITT : Stuff that Oda manages to hide perfectly <br><br>his true nature</br></br></br>  <br>He's not even looking anywhere near his ass.</br>  <br> manages to hide perfectly </br>  <br>im sorry for having started the ant zoan thing...now this fucker posts in every single thread</br>  Im keeping up with the manga but forgot everything relating to drake. Can someone bring me up to date on any backstory,his past etc?  <br>used to be a marine<br>now he's a dinosaur who may or may not be riding Kaido's dick</br></br>  <br>How do i forget moments like this, this is awesome, why did he have the sword again? Any other forgotten awesome moments out there?</br>  <br>Zoro got rekt (by Lucci iirc) and dropped his sword while falling to some far place</br>  <br>His papa was a meanie pirate who tried to sell the Ope-ope fruit. They got fucked over, Drake was rescued by the marines and he joined them. When he was a rear admiral he realized that WG is fucked up and became a pirate instead. Then he fucked around on one of Kaido's islands, then joined him.</br>  <br> tripfag <br> pasta <br>ayy lmao</br></br></br>  I don't understand what Cobra realized at that moment  <br>He realized that the killing of people who could read the poneglyphs might have been dumb?</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>I wasn't telling you, I was suggesting it. Hence the question mark.</br>  <br>Then why did we protect something potentially dangerous from the WG even though we're supposed to e on their side. <br>That's because his family was a mole/on the Ancient Kingdom's side, the Alabasta royal family refusing to go to Mariejois after the void century is enough proof of that.</br></br>  <br>Chimney</br>  <br>we dont talk about that</br>  So, since ope ope users obviously are able to operate on themselves, and they are able to give their life to perform an immortality operation: could Law make himself immortal by dying for himself?  <br>No, he's not Jesus.</br>  <br> could Law make himself immortal by dying <br> immortal by dying <br><br>Somehow I don't think it works that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No no, Jesus did it differently: he got himself killed for himself to make everyone else immortal since he would just resurrect and is immortal anyway.<br>Or maybe Jesus does have the ope ope no mi. Makes you think, hu?<br><br><br>Not with that attitude, atleast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's like, Jesus died for other people so he could be immortal and then make others "immortal" after they died.</br>  <br>But he died so God would forgive the primeval sin, or sin in general, since he took all of Earth's sin on himself. Like, he was Kuma'ing the sin out of everyone who folloed him and went full Zoro on it, which he could do since he was God. So he sacrificed himself to himself.</br>  <br>Yes, he sacrificed himself to himself for others. He also used the Ope Ope fruit to perform all of his miracles. And that is the end of the theological discussion.</br>  <br>So, basically he used the immortality operation on himself, died, became immortal, and can now grant eternal life since he wouldn't die anymore during the immortality operation. Clever bastard.<br><br>For real though, the gonosei, did they get immortality treatment?</br></br></br>  <br>The Gorosei are just five dudes with a lot of power, politically speaking.</br>  <br>Yeah, but that'd be boring.

Women have 30% less muscles than men, they're physically fragile. Swordsmanship is all about reflex, agility etc, women who perform that are doomed on arrival.</br>  Wait.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>Koala is Koala. As in, Fisher Tiger's Koala. How the fuck did I not see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her father killed her because he didn't want to give his top sword to a woman.<br><br><br>All we know is that she was in fact older than him, and for smaller children even one year is a world of a difference.<br>Only thing we can know about Zoro's strength is that it would probably be much smaller, due to the missing motivation.<br><br><br>He ate the stair stair no mi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that stupid slave girl who never stopped smiling.</br>  <br> Mihawk fully concentrated on Zoro at beginning of the series. <br>u wot m8</br></br>  <br> men have more muscles, they're stronger <br> swordsmanship relies on reflex, agility, etc <br> thus women are doomed when it comes to swordmanship <br>I don't think reflex and agility are brute strength dependent.<br>But let's not get technical here. Whatever the truth, I still think it's stupid to give women such a handicap in a series where people can turn into gum or fire and create earthquakes. Moreover the most potent force in One Piece is willpower. Anyone is able to overcome their shortcomings with sheer willpower, so why wouldn't women be able to overcome their lack of muscles ? When I look at Tashigi and her resolve, I think she should be strong, yet Oda keeps shitting on her.</br></br></br></br></br>   Trafalgar D. Water Law <br> Water Law <br> Waterloo </br></br>  Am I the only one who genuinely thinks that Rebecca will join the SH crew?  <br>Welcome to 8 months ago.</br>  <br>You don't believe it either, so the mathematical answer to your question can only be no.</br>  <br>More like 10 months ago<br><br>Damn it feels like yesterday</br></br></br>  <br>Tashigi ? What's her resolve ? To get a bunch of swords from criminals. What's Zoro's ? To be the best in the goddamn World. Better than literally anyone. Of course Tashigi is going to get shat on. Her dream doesn't compare to Zoro's. And Kuina had already pretty much given up. She was crying, claiming that she'd definitely be weaker. She had no will at all. If you want to see strong willed women, look at Rouge. What she did was fucking impossible and even Sengoku knows it.</br>  <br>Still one of the worst names in One Piece. Just Trafalgar Law was fine.</br>  <br> Trafalgar Law <br> Trafalgar <br><br>HOLY SHIT GUYS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and that's why Kaido is likely to have a Napoleon theme</br>  <br>It's going to be Gaimon's fucking brother, isn't it.</br>  <br>He already has a beast theme.<br><br><br>Yuwhat m8?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyros said that he protected Rebecca so that she won't have to fight anymore,</br>  <br>He can have a beast theme and be based on napolen....both Scotch and Drake wear french musketeer like hats.</br>  <br>If he is french he will likely be a dolphin, since the gayest animal on earth was already defeated.</br>  <br>Dolphins are smart enough to enjoy rape. Surely they have nothing in common with the French.</br>  <br>Gaimon, the short midget stuck in a box ?</br>  <br>Didn't Gen say something similar about Nami?</br>  <br>Nami doesn't really fight anything though. She is only involved in soapy rapes.</br>  <br>I think he made Luffy promise to protect her smile.<br>Or something.</br></br>  <br>Box midget is Kaido's brother? What're you basing this on?</br>  That giant who was with Rayleigh during the human auction, did he ever show up again?  <br>It was a joke, you funless bastard. A joke on being short.</br>  <br>Didn't he join Magneto?</br>  <br>Well he said he's going to pay back his debt to the strawhats or something.</br>  <br>I think that's kinda the problem with One Piece now. I sure as fuck can't remember what happened two hundred chapters ago. I'm pretty hazy on what happened to Sunny/Sanji&amp;co to be honest and that can't've been more than a couple of dozen chapters ago. Problem is that amounts to about half a year in real time.</br>  Possible spoilers for ch.71<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Also, the question about Erwin.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>進撃舞台挨拶in池袋④<br><br>先生「エルヴィンは見た目ありき」<br>　　「『パリスヒルトンを大統領に』のバックのいかにもUSA、スーパーマ<wbr>ンができそうな男性<br>　　落書きして、描いてるうちに（人物像が出来上がっていった）」<br><br>「今月号に過去のエルヴィン」<br>「団長になる過程みたいなのを」<br><br>source;https://mangahelpers.com/for<wbr>um/showthread.php/3000633-Shingeki-<wbr>no-Kyojin-Chapter-71-Spoiler-Pics-S<wbr>ummaries</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127674291 <br>Annibot why?<br><br>Why are you doing this?</br></br></br>  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>Because I love her and I will not allow her name to fade into oblivion.</br>  <br>GO to the link.

Hopefully the nips are bored like us and are just trolling.  <br>Why does Isayama have such a hard on for cuckoldry?</br>  <br>He's not the most imaginative writer.</br>  <br> inb4 Eren's real father is Keith </br>  Why are there no black people? snk needs diversity.  <br>I'm suspicious of it, it sounds a bit too much like the whole thing with Erwin/Nile/Marie. <br>Also Keith apparently only met Grisha on the day he stole the coordinate.</br></br>  <br>They were wiped out along with all the other races except whites.</br>  <br>They probably have that from over here.<br>Someone was joking around with that possibility yesterday.Now it pops up a spoiler?<br>Either a high class prophet or what I said above.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga. They were wiped out.</br>  <br>Ymir is Swedish, so they're basically Somalian.<br><br>Hanji is maybe black too, it's harder to tell.</br></br></br>  キースたんはあれや ジェル見てカルラマッマは中出しセックスしたんやなーてしみじみ思うんやな<wbr>い<br><br>Keith and Carla had sex, Eren was the result which is why Eren resembles young Keith more than Grisha</br></br></wbr>  <br>It looks google translated.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I think they're just fucking around. Keith does sound like a real creep from the spoilers so far. Tampering with Eren's belts, lusting after Eren's mom. Yeah, someone's trolling.</br></br>  <br>I got it from the fujo thread.</br>  Also Marie was a whore.  This chapter sounds fucking boring so far if any of these spoilers are true.  <br>Fucking prophet.</br>  <br> So now that we're finally closing off Erwin's character arc, <br>Are we? Seems more like the chapter is about Grisha and Keith too, so there's more Erwin developments to come.<br><br> I think that his death is inevitable at this point <br>That was inevitable from the start. Only question is when.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying it isn't the samefag that's spamming that shit over 2ch </br>  <br> being this jelly because you weren't the prophet </br>  In the chapter it becomes evident that the Grisha-Keith-Carla love triangle is something similar to Eren-Jean-Mikasa. Carla/Mikasa were in love with Grisha/Eren for the longest of times, then there was Keith/Jean on the sidelines watching on.  <br><br>Please stop saying this. Those are not real Prophets.</br></br>  <br>I drew you an Annie.</br>  <br>Great.

She told him not to cum inside her but Jean did it anyway, proving that Jean is alpha.</br>  <br>They just see each other as siblings.</br>   ヒスちゃん壁マリア行きたいです <br>Historia wants to go Wall Maria</br>  <br>There's no use denying it, anon. Isayama is going to go with boring and predictable EM, especially now that it's apparently a parallel to Grisha/Carla.</br>  <br>Took her long enough.</br>  <br>Nope, he's a beta cuck.</br>  <br>You mean Armin?</br>  <br>Well of course she would abandon her loved one and her future husband -  YMIR__ </br>  <br>Jean deserves to die alone like a cuck.</br>  <br>Reunion soon.<br>Unless Ymir really did head for the walls while Historia went out.</br></br>  <br>Meh that was obvious</br>  <br>20 chapters</br>  <br>Curious: what would you have preferred as the main pairing?</br>  <br> inb4 she hears Ymir is kill </br>  <br>YH</br>  <br>This. It's not like he's going to have a working lower half by the end of this anyway.</br>  <br>Mate Jean the top shingeki that Isayama wanted him to be the main protagonist of the live action movie</br>  <br>I personally view it as the other main SNK pairing.</br>  <br>Isayama has shit taste though and he said he only likes characters because they're simple and honest.</br>  <br>I love to see her face when King Kong smashes Ymir face and then eats her in front of historia</br>  <br>Is this from dreamfag or random speculation?</br>  <br>Isayama probably cucks Jean because he likes him. Plenty of authors love to make their faves suffer.</br>  <br>You probably won't believe me, but I don't prefer any main pairing actually. I think Eren should die or go insane or face some sort of irreversible consequence at the end of the manga. Like Isayama said, romance creates unnecessary noise in the narrative.</br>    <br>Jean didn't deserve to be saved by Armin.</br>  <br>That explains a lot of MCs.</br>  <br>Wait, how come potato boy can still walk without a foot?Or is it just a case of same face?</br>  <br>Called it.</br>  <br>It's a future scenario. It hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>Nah, I do believe you. I personally don't mind it as long as it is well-written but I see your point.</br>  <br>That's just Jean's imagination when he decides to join the SL</br>  <br>Because she already said it in ch51.</br>  <br>No isayama hates Eren the only reason Eren even exist is because he needed to fit the requirement of the dense and Idiotic MC <br>Jean was originally meant to be the MC</br></br>  <br>People still doubted it.</br>  <br>I don't think Isayama is even capable of writing well-written romance. Most of them are either end up tragically or kept one-sided.</br>  <br>Source?<br>My impression was that Isayama made Eren MC because he couldn't think of anyone else and only came to like Jean while he was writing him.</br></br>  <br>Explains why Jean is such a huge cuck then.</br>  <br>I like YH and the way it is written, but to each their own.</br>  <br>Well i can't find the source but Isayama said that he wanted a Levi personality main character.<br>But the Editors didn't because you know typical shonen MC was what the editor want so Isayama had to change that</br></br>  <br>They're okay but I don't know if I'd call them a "well written romance"</br>  <br>Not really, it's quite typical, even for a lesbian "romance".</br>  Isn't Ymir his actual favorite? is that the reason why her also made her a cuck?  <br>That's the first time I heard about that. If you ever find a source, please post it.</br>  <br>Yes and most likely yes.<br>His top favorites are AT, FT, MT, Ymir, and Jean in that order.</br></br>  <br>Actually it isn't that typical. Most lesbian romance is sexualized and their orientation is emphasized whereas with YH none of that matters. It just is what it is.</br>  <br>Well not talking of the romance aspect <br>to me YH<br> EH, <br> Armin and Jean,  <br> Sasha and Connie  <br>  Levi, Hanji and Erwin  <br> Berthold and Reiner. <br>Relationship was well written.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't that typical.</br>  <br>Yeah it might take time this was along time <br>I think he said this during the end of SNK anime</br></br>  <br>Nope, most of it is angsty and pretty much identical to YH. The uglier, usually darker in colors girl is more manly and usually overshadows the cute blonde girl, angst ensues, cute blonde girl understands their love, lesbian love ensues.</br>  <br>I haven't really seen that many lesbian romances in non-yuri manga, but YH always reminded me of those het romances were male broody, selfish outcast (Ymir) falls for the cute pure girl. He mocks her and her ideals but he also wants to nail her until he finally becomes selfless to save her. YH seems more like het romance with the gender of one participant changed.</br>  <br>Get in line.I love her too and am going to legally marry her.</br>  <br>It's extremely typical.<br><br><br>I'm not only talking about manga, I mean in fiction in general. It's also really common in het romances, but it's a common trope in lesbian ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to beat me in a fight first</br>  <br>I agree. I like the YB friendship, too, and EAr is also well done.</br>  <br>Bert, please.CT a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>So you're calling it typical because appearance-wise that's what it seems like.</br></br></br>  <br>Anniebot was bert all along?</br>  <br>Personality wise too. Ymir is basically a guy.</br>  <br>Possible that I have read just different stuff than you, then. A lot of yuri manga seem to be cute best friends lesbians from what I saw. Lesbians outside of yuri seem a bit more diverse than that, though I agree that often, one is much more feminine than the other e.g. Haruka/Michiru, Antsy/Utena etc.</br>  <br>CT is best titan.</br>  YH may be typical but it is well written.  <br>Don't talk about my Husband like that<br>You wanna get squashed</br></br>  <br>Naah.</br>  <br>Not even close. You would know that if you knew how to read.<br><br><br> A lot of yuri manga seem to be cute best friends lesbians from what I saw. <br>That's the minority, not a lot. There are really few series with just cute lesbian romance, since even Madoka fall within the YH trope if you ignore the artstyle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is</br>  <br>Thanks, anon, and sure thing.<br><br><br>But do you respect her feelings on this matter?</br></br></br></br>    <br> YH is well-written <br> Anon1: No! <br> Anon2: Yes it is! <br> Anon3: No it isn't! <br><br>Repeat ad nauseum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay.</br>  Reminder that Annie and Eren already lost their Virginity to each other  <br> typical <br> well written <br>It doesn't work like that. It's meh at best. I think it's horrible but I can understand if some think it's slightly above average.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the typical for hetero romances or even for yaoi since one of the guys is always the asshole, but in yuri this is barely the case and especially not in yuri within a shounen manga.</br></br>    <br> Hanji's nose </br>  <br> Armoured Titan watching Brazzer <br>TOP KEK</br></br>  <br>She always had a hook nose.</br>  <br>You can take a concept that it typical and make something well written out of it.</br>  <br>Don't know why I kek'd so hard.</br>  <br>Not really. For hetero it's most of the time one sided and revolves around senpai noticing them, and for yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs. Yuri is usually manly girl being obsessed with girly girl.</br>  <br><br>Wow meant to quote this.<br><br><br>But seeing the Reiner tier delusion why the fuck not?</br></br></br></br></br>  No new spoilers?  <br>Sure you can, but not in YH's case.</br>  <br>  yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs <br><br>No, yaoi is manly alpha man raping a girly weak boy.</br></br></br>  <br>That too.</br>  Sorry guys I just won't fucking believe Isayama made Keith have feelings for Carla. I mean he already did this shit with JEM and Erwin/Marie/Nile and possibly BAE. He just can't reuse the same fucking plot device over and over can he?  <br>Nah.Still only at Grisha having ntr'd Keith who is actually a male Yandere and tried to kill Eren by manipulating his belt.</br>  <br> and for yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs <br>Most yaois are just plain ol' rape and the slow transformation from 'no homo' to maximum cockslut. Can't even find a goddamn homoge without rape in it.</br></br>  <br> Eren gets kidnapped <br> New team comes in only to get killed.Levi's, Mike's and Hanji's <br> Titan fight at the end of arc <br> We're just like Ouroboros! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds fun.<br><br>For serious, are the nips talking about Kieth like he's a possible antagonist now?</br></br></br>  <br>Well he did copy his own spinoff when he wrote about Kenny and Uri, but I'm taking these spoilers with a grain of salt as well.</br>  <br>How would it kill him? And why would he suddenly have a change of heart and help Eren all of a sudden? <br><br>Sounds more to me like Grisha and Keith were good friends.</br></br></br>  <br>What's so badly written about it?</br>  <br>It's the best written relationship in my opinion.</br>  <br>I like EH better. But mostly as just friends since they're not as obsessed with eachother as YH.</br>  <br>Historia was super dependent on Ymr because of her issues. She has obviously gotten over most of them so that would help balance out YH. EH is nice and all but everyone gets close to the MC.</br>  <br>You have talent</br>  <br> He just can't reuse the same fucking plot device over and over can he? <br>Kishimoto did the same for Naruto <br>he basically used the same plot device for each generation</br></br></br>  <br>Cause the belt is for maintaining balance and is there to ensure that the head won't hit the ground.</br>  <br>I think YH and EH are both equally good<br>because she can balance herself between both<br>Eren and Ymir. Also, because she can act herself around them more</br></br></br>    <br>EH has the same dynamics as YH's relationship except that EH has less history together and in my opinion what really helped Historia grow was having Ymir's support.</br>  <br>Pretty much. The MC usually hast the biggest number of developed relationships (friends, family, love interests, mentors, etc.).</br>  <br><br>I think both are good for her and came at the right time in her life.</br></br>  <br> Yuri is usually manly girl being obsessed with girly girl. <br>Not at all. Yuri is in 80% of the cases feminine girl with feminine girl who start off as friends and then go full yuri. I barely see yuri romances that are similar to YH's</br></br>  So which character has a best relationship with Eren  <br><br>Was even pointed out how he "almost killed himself" there.</br></br>  <br>it's usually best for people to have more than one support system. Eren being one of them kind of cheapens it a little just because he's the MC though.</br>  <br>I think manly girl/girly girl might be more common in non-yuri manga but there are a variety of dynamics for them.</br>  <br>I think EH is quite boring but it's a nice relationship I can give you that.</br>  <br>Well fuck me for thinking we were better than Naruto</br>  <br>Indeed, butch/femme is more of a Western stereotype.</br>  <br>70 year old special snowflake falls in love with princess for no reason? Because she relates to her? That's still retarded.</br>  For me the most "natural" friendship/relationship/whatever has got to Jean and Armin. I mean, yeah, their's is not the most exciting relatioship, but you can actually see how it develops in the background. It feels right, in my opinion.  <br>Armin obviously.</br>  <br>Armin and Historia.<br>Isayama is obviously going for that Eren is now the Frieda for Historia.<br>And Armin is well, Armin.Doesn't need an explanation I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>Armin.</br>  <br>Are we still talking about non-porn yuri? Because if we are, you're wrong.</br>  <br>armin the only one who understand his desire to leave the wall.</br>  <br>You say it's badly written because the concept is of a mean girl falling for the nice girl, but I think that the way their relationship was handled was good in the sense that they always support each other and helped one another grow as persons.<br><br> falling in love with someone because you relate to them is retarded <br>Seriously?</br></br></br></br>  <br>if we're talking about 3dpd, then butch/femme is prevalent everywhere. the asian equivalent would be T/P</br>  <br>Annie.</br>  <br>We are better than Naruto because Isayama dosn't use the same plot example instead of fighting Titans <br>Human fought humans to a short blond onto the throne.<br>Instead of fighting the titans every arc.</br></br></br>  <br>I like that it wasn't all dumped in one arc. You had the start in the FT arc, the scene at the end of Stohess and then the stuff in the clash of titan arc before it got more focus in the uprising arc. It was good that all their development wasn't stuff into one arc.</br>  <br>CT a cute.</br>  <br>Armin is the only answer.</br>  <br>Armin. Hopefully their wish to travel outside the walls together will come true one day.</br>  <br>I think Armin and him have the closest bond, but as of right now I think EH has better interactions.</br>  <br>Cause Armin set that flea into his head.<br>Remember it was Eren who denied at first what's outside the walls when Armin told him about lava, ocean and snowfields from his grandpa's book.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So Armin leads so far<br>with at tie Historia and Annie</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Armin because no drama and no forced romance</br>  <br>Armin, obviously.</br>  To me what sets YH apart from the other stereotypical yuri is that the girly girl is usually very shallow and exists solely as a love interest but Historia actually has much more depth than Ymir and takes action too.  <br><br><br>Armin still in lead<br>Historia <br>then annie<br>so basically anyone who is blond is eren favourite<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine them reaching the ocean. Eren is weak and close to death but he smilies happily that their dream came true and then dies in Armin's arms while Mikasa watches.</br>  <br>Mikasa</br>  <br>Pretty much. Them being fleshed out characters prevents them from being shallow stereotypes.</br>  <br>Armin.<br><br>Anybody who says Mikasa is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>How many yuri have you actually read? Because both the girls are usually the femmes.</br>  <br>I think the Annie one wasn't serious.<br>Clearly she was very important to him, but we know that bond got severed and is a thing of the past.<br>Until she starts talking about her motive perhaps, but for now it's broken.</br></br></br>  <br>Armin.<br><br>Historia is getting there.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm amused that Isayama accidentally wrote Eren as having a type that is the complete opposite of Mikasa.</br>  <br>Ask that question to yourself and stop thinking that porn counts as much as other kinds of fiction.</br>  <br><br><br>So Armin is clrealy 1st place<br>Historia and Annie are neck and neck<br>and a faggot ruined it by voting black hair mikasa</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it retarded?</br>  <br>Yeah, those are exactly my thoughts on it, anon.</br>  <br> yuri <br> porn  <br>Are you one of those retarded weeaboos who thinks that yuri = porn and shoujo ai = non porn GL?</br></br></br>  <br> accidentally <br>Not really, it was his intention. He keeps saying it in interviews and guidebook/smartpass types of content.</br></br>  <br>Shh.Don't tell her or she'll dye her hair blonde out of desperation.<br>Also, don't forget he also saw Reiner as a bro, looking up to him.</br></br>  <br> smartpass types <br>In smartpass he said Mina.</br></br>  <br>Yeah his affinity for small blondes is clear.</br>  <br>I don't think so, but if you keep claiming that most yuri is cute/cute, you either didn't read enough or you think that fanservice based yuri series are serious fiction.</br>  <br>Armin<br>Mikasa<br>In that order.</br></br></br>  <br>Eren finds her annoying most of the time. That's not mutual bonding or even a healthy friendship. That doesn't mean he doesn't care about her, but we're talking about well-developed and mutual relationships here.</br>  Welp after all the replies it is concluded that Eren and Armin have the best relationship <br>So I guess I can say Bros before Woes</br>  <br>Eren's relationship with Mikasa hasn't developed at all, even after chapter 50. Eren still treats her like she's an unwanted big sister and Mikasa's character developed has been reduced to nothing but "muh eren".<br><br>With Armin and Historia, both parties at least got some development with eachother and themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still the cute and feminine girl type, Mikasa is nothing like Mina.</br>  <br>I think I have way more experience with yuri than you if you claim that almost every yuri is asshole, butch femme with innocent, femme girl.</br>  <br>To be fair, Reiner is not 100 percent the Eren type because he is the second tallest boy in the 104.</br>  <br>Even though he cares for Mikasa, best isn't the word for their relationship.</br>  <br>not him but both girls tend to be equally fleshed out in the yurihime and tsubomi serializations I have read. I can't even think of that many butch/femme series to begin with, only some with the typical prince/princess dynamic and then it's usually the prince that isn't fleshed out enough.</br>  <br> asshole, butch femme <br>lesbian*</br></br>  <br>Eh, I actually think he is a little better. When she says in 70 that he shouldn't carry heavy stuff he apologizes and then apologizes again when she scolds him for getting to caught up in Grisha memories. In the past he would have flipped the fuck out. So baby steps.</br>  <br>Reiner is a tiny blond inside. And in his pants.</br>  <br> almost every <br>"Most" is not "almost every", but yes it's true. Even taking a small trip at /u/ you'll see that really quickly, not even having to read hundreds of series to get to a conclusion. By the way I read a lot of yuri, I'm saying it because you fags can't read and you'll misinterpret what I just said as not having read any yuri.</br></br>  <br> and then it's usually the prince that isn't fleshed out enough. <br>Just like Ymir.</br></br>  <br>I don't think butches exist in 2d. The closest you get are athletic girls like Kase-san but even then they've got more of a tomboy feel instead of a butch feel.</br>  <br>True. We've seen how Historia developed since their separation, we haven't seen how Ymir has developed yet.</br>  <br>Even saying that "most" of them are the butch/femme stereotype is wrong, let's take a hundred yuri manga, and only 4 or 6 out of those would have a butch/femme couple. You seriously take /u/ as an example of what really is out there? On /u/ you can easily find threads "only" dedicated to very manly girls with feminine girls, in fact there's one up right about now and I on;y saw about 6 different couples being posted in it.</br>  <br>Well, she became a pretty selfless person before she left with BR and she wasn't always this way. But we still know almost nothing of her past.</br>  <br>I remember in Negima it was the tomboy who was way more fleshed out than the girly girl she was in love with and that's usually what I see in yuri if it isn't just weird loli lesbian fetishes.</br>  <br>Can you really blame Isayama? There was barely any time to flesh her out whereas Historia has 2 arcs dedicated to her internal struggle.</br>  <br>Good thing I hide most threads on /u/. The majority of the threads just looks awful and sometimes I'd rather have some of the stuff there moved to /co/</br>  <br>When I say Historia is more developed I don't mean that Ymir is simple either.</br>  <br>I know you guys are defensive but you need to calm down, I didn't blame Isayama. It's a fact that she's not fleshed out whoever's at fault.</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>I hate most of the threads on /u/ since the majority of them aren't even yuri and there's even groww 3DPD threads on it.</br>  <br>To be honest EM peak of their relation ship was chapter 50<br>The only thing left is that Eren either chooses Mikasa or tells Mikasa that he is not interested.<br><br>If he tells Mikasa he is not Interested then if Isayama plays his cards right Mikasa can move on and be more Independent</br></br></br></br>  <br> Negima <br>I thought we were talking about manga that explicitly belong to the yuri genre and not dykes in harem manga.</br></br>  <br>If the topic includes Ymir there is a guarantee someone is going to get defensive over nothing.</br>  <br>gross*</br>  <br> and she wasn't always this way <br>She always had this backwards way of helping people out though. Like with Sasha.</br></br>  <br>Negima became a battle shonen.</br>  <br> defensive over nothing <br> saying that Ymir is flat character while Historia is deep and complex even though it's unfair to compare them seeing as Ymir's only been in 10 chapters </br></br>  <br>I said Ymir isn't so simple either. Learn to read.</br>  <br>Well the only left for Ymir is to tell her past and <br>maybe help humanity <br>but I think she will die in the hands of the MT</br></br></br>  <br> saying that Ymir is flat character <br>I didn't say that.<br> saying that Historia is deep and complex <br>I didn't say that either. <br><br>Nevermind, I give up, you faggots are retarded as expected. Sorry that not everyone else puts Shitmir on a pedestral.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>many threads are also full with broken English and smiley chatspeak. I have to cringe everytime I see the threads on /u/, at least /a/nons are able to type full sentences.</br></br>  <br>She will get some backstory then she will meet Historia one more time and then die</br>  <br> Shitmir <br>Of course, it is a waste of time to discuss with kindergarteners <br><br>You have no idea how to discuss something, you only use kiddie names to proof a point</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that by calling her Shitmir you are now giving reason to annoy others when we could of had an okay discussion.</br>  <br> proof a point </br>  <br>I don't get you.</br>  <br>To be fair you would get banned if you used smileys in /u/'s snk threads. I think it differs, anime and manga-related threads are usually the only decent ones.</br>  <br>Annie.</br>  <br>Some of us don't have English as their native language</br>  <br>I was calling her Ymir all the time and I hate that name, but since you showed what kind of a shitposter you are, I decided to stoop on your level. Expect more of that if you keep it up.</br>  <br>SnK /u/ isn't so bad. Shitposters tend to be dealt with quickly.</br>  <br>Why was Annie's titanform crying again when she lost Eren?</br>  <br>Good proving you are indeed just a high school kid on summer vacation</br>  <br>Because not getting Eren meant that she couldn't go home to daddy.</br>  I think both of YH will either survive or they will die together.  <br> fighting cancer with more cancer </br>  <br>Haha xD</br>  <br><br>snk threads are okay and I'm grateful for that. but lately it seems like smileys and all that crap become more and more accepted in other threads on /u/. I guess it's because /u/ is so slow and small that it is easily influenced by underage yurifags while /a/ teaches newfags to lurk and learn the board culture first.</br></br>  <br>I think their going to live and then adopt the orphanage kids</br>  <br> I'm allowed to shitpost, but if anyone shitposts back to me they're a high school kid on vacation! <br> muh Ymir! <br>Fuck off. First of all you should understand that if you don't want people to shitpost about Ymir, you should cut off your shitposting first. Don't whine like a retard when someone copies you against your favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>daddy is already inside of her anon.</br>  <br>She failed her mission.</br>  <br>I think Isayama is going to give them a happy ending and I could easily see them adopting the orphan kids.</br>  <br>Plenty of people on 4chan doesn't, but at least they know how to make a sentence. Also learn punctuation.</br>  <br>they even defend tumblr art.</br>  <br>Obviously Armin</br>  <br>/u/ is more welcoming towards Dumblr because of stuff like Korra.</br>  <br> doesn't </br>  <br> couldn't get Eren <br> can't go home <br> has to try and get Eren again <br>The loss is overwhelming. And despite her brutal killings, a part of Annie does feel guilty too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't shitposting, you are the one saying Ymir is flat character, you guys don't know how to discuss Ymir<br><br><br>I'm sorry that my English isn't perfect, I try</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we ever have a discussion about YH without either side turning it into an autism fest?</br>  <br>Some art from tumblr is okay, but it's more like the 1%. Defending art where all girls are hairy, red noses, everyone being fat and butch faces is retarded no matter what though.</br>  <br> brown Ymir with freckles all over her body </br>  <br>it's not just the /co/ stuff that leads to more dumblr influence, lots of scanlation groups are sharing their works on both dumblr and /u/ which invites lots of dumblrinas to the board.</br>  <br> you are the one saying Ymir is flat character <br>It's the second time I make it clear, but I did not say that. You keep being unable to read and you use le epic "deep and complex character" reverse shitposting to shit on Historia like you always do with Bert. I didn't claim Historia is deep and complex, just more fleshed out than Ymir. Which is a fact you should learn to accept.</br></br>  壁内に出生記録が無いらしい<br>おまけ<br>実写インタ抜粋、エレンの恋愛迫られる大人っぽい異性として</br></br>  <br>Anon, this should settle it.<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4841529</br></br></br>  <br>I say Historia is well written because she has more screentime than Ymir, I didn't shit on her anon, but that's no excuse to shit on Ymir because she has less time in the story</br>  <br> posting random stuff. <br>Instead of going full retarded, wait for the pics.</br></br>  <br>Looks like armin got the lead<br>then Historia, Annie and 0 for Mikasa kek</br></br>  <br>I only go to snk /u/ because I'm not interested in many other series yuri pairings.

Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake. But of course, it was directed for the mainstream Naruto audience, so majority buys it.<br><br>Well, now I´m sounding pretentious as hell for even explaining it.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>The answer for stopping the bloodshed is dumb, and I´m not buying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction <br>Yes, and some fools even believe than one day man will fly! Pish-posh!</br></br>  Wouldn't it be nice to have a worthy opponent?  <br>If you start, just remember when it stops that's it.. don't get your hopes up or dwell when it will finish.. it wont</br>  <br>There's always the book.</br>  <br> not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga <br>I disagree. In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that. The best part begins once Musashi can't fight as good as he used too anymore.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>to*</br>  I pray and hope everyday for ricefarmingsaga to continue  <br>naruto fangirl here, and i do like vinland because thorfinn reminds me of naruto. so dont shit on us narutofags.</br>  <br>You having a giggle there?</br>    <br> Musashi refusing the other Samurai's proposal of glory so that he can help a bunch of peasants <br> Despite the fact he's growing weaker every day, he's improving as a person and learning to understand other people and his surroundings. <br> That amount of despair when despite his efforts everything just goes wrong over and over again. <br> Old man becomming a total bro in the end and helping everybody out <br> Mushashi, who is now a walking hungry skeleton begging on his knees to the other samurai and making a deal with them so that they help that infertile land and help his friends/comrades <br><br>Pinnacle of the manga right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want REAL to genre shift into wrasslin' instead of cripple basketball.</br>  <br> refusing <br>casca is disgusting used goods. i rather read hitman reborn.</br></br>  <br>The artist probably would die before he can finish his remaining works.</br>  <br>Pro wrestling in manga? Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.  <br>Most sympathetic character.</br>  <br>I think most people understood that its korean drama or so i would suspect, but who the fuck watches that shit to know what you mean by it.<br>Christ nigger.</br></br>  <br>Unless Inoue decides to continue into Musashi's later years, it will end like the movie and the book do: he gets on board the boat leaving Ganryu Island, gets vaguely sad, the boat sails off to the sunset, THE END.<br><br><br> too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. <br>It's pretty realistic actually. The samurai who don't give a shit about fighting are not a part of the story in the first place, and for the rest it was pretty much like what is shown in the manga, a wide spectrum of characters ranging from old masters who have awakened to petty murderers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do go autistic on me know. If you already know what Korean drama is, you know what was implied.</br>  <br>I have no idea what was implied, I've never seen a single Korean drama and don't know how it relates to Vinland Saga.</br>  <br>I really dont, but whatever.<br>If this is your idea of "no spoonfeeding" keep at it.</br></br>  <br>Canute's change was sudden, but Thorfinn's change was not. There was a whole year when he went mindbroken and just did hard labour so he didn't need to think about anything, and then we got Einar's arrival, budding of friendship, and then after another year (or was it 2?) of working on the farm, Thorfinn realizes his new goal in life (vinland) only through the subplot of that slave woman and her husband. I'm hardly seeing any dramatic change in Thorfinn's character throughout. It was not a case of him being depressed one day, and the next day being motivated about not using violence for no reason.</br>  <br>Nah, it panders way too much to glorious nippongo. Reading it make you want to live in that era. Shigarui would be a better representation of the sword era, dishonorable, shitty, and inglorious.</br>  <br>Reading Vagabond didn't make me want to live in that era. People get killed left and right with hardly any consequences to the killers. It's a scary time.</br>  <br><br>Tetsuya Sariwatari, writer of Tough, has started writing a wrasslin' manga if I'm not mistaken.</br></br>  <br> Tough <br>I've been meaning to pick that up, but it's so long and I don't know if I can stick to a fighting series for that long. How good is it?</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>there's that buzzword again.<br><br>"edginess" aside the relationship and rivalry between Gennosuke and Seigen was far more interesting to me than anything in vagabond.<br><br>I also liked how the creator didn't have a romantic view of that era or the samurai class. these where violent cunts looking out for their best interest in order to rise in their shit heap of a society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The supposed edginess of Shigurui comes from the fact that the series is unnecessarily brutal, just like the time period it depicts.</br>  <br>Do not take that literally and go full retard. It is more in the line of: Damn, this is beautiful, such a romantic age, sword, manliness, and rice growing. I would like to experience that, of course with plot armor and not getting hunted down by forest bandits for a day. And then you realize how comfy you are on that room of yours with PC and Internet.</br>  <br> It is more in the line of <br>Dude, don't go taking your personal experience and pretending everyone else shares it.</br></br>  <br>I could see yaoi doujins of them if they wasnt drawn by somebody that couldnt draw.</br>  <br>HA! no</br>  <br>Then what is worth reading? Don't be shy anon.</br>  <br>When will you learn that people do not have to put IMO after every sentence to get that across. Is the Internet lad.</br>  <br>bleach is quite good, lol, only shonen manga i like, or read gantz, that is very bloody and good.</br>  <br>Shigurui goes to extreme of complete anti-glorification and does it on purpose. It has partly true elements but its whole cannot be taken as being realistic or accurate by anyone.<br>I agree with . The time frame presented in Vagabond isn't appealing.<br><br>Compared to Shigurui, the movie Sword of Doom (partial adaptation of the novel 大菩薩峠, "Great Bodhisattva Pass") is a more accurate representation of the times (just before the Meiji era) from the point of view of a sociopath samurai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I've only read part of Tough myself, I've been meaning to continue but other backlog priorities arose. It's pretty bizarre and not a very conventional fighting series, I remember: Bloodsport+Mortal Kombat-esque underground tournaments, mafia everywhere, borderline supernatural powers, some guys building up power and energy via sexual deprivation, strong and righteous MC who uses a super secret assassination art but doesn't kill people, some guy linked to his past because of his father, or something.<br>As for the author's other works, Dog Soldier is like dog shit, the Tough spinoff-prequel OTON is pretty good, and Igyoujin Oniwakamaru is great.<br><br>So yeah maybe give it a go and you'll see pretty quickly whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of youre wrong. Both Vag and Shi are unrealistic. One head to the extreme of showing the brutalization and ugliness of being a samurai. And the other one indulge in your desire of a romantic era. Men with dreams and ideals. <br><br>However, both should be read. As theres much enjoyment and learning to be had. Everyone should just put down their fucking fan flags.</br></br></br>  <br>After your description, I think I'll pass. I prefer martial arts stuff to be like Holyland.</br>  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>is okay at first, then turns very very very bad with evil uncle and the fights become a super power fights.</br>  <br>Compare, though: Shigurui doesn't show a single good thing about samurai life and the samurai, while Vagabond showed many bad aspects of them even if it doesn't focus on that.</br>  So how useful is dual wielding for real?  <br>Not very unless you can actually overpower someone with one hand.</br>  <br>Did the real Musashi ever actually dual wield? I know for a fact that he would utilize his short sword if he lost his primary weapon but I don't know if he ever used them at the same time as he's commonly depicted doing.</br>  <br> not useful until you got what it takes to utilize it. like every thing ever. <br>geez, do you moonlight as sherlock?</br></br>  <br>It's more than just skill or practice. That's like herculean strength.</br>  <br>Niten Ichi-ryu, he used his second sword as a parry tool. So yes.</br>  <br>never go full retard. you are assuming he is wielding a bastard sword on both hands or what? have you ever wielded a short sword? they are quite light and can be used to swing with one hand. dualwielding can be useful. throwing your other sword or use it to block.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being scrawny.</br>  <br>Absolutely. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Thank God there was 300+ chapters when I started.</br>  <br>Another thing is, Musashi did not take a vow to not kill or pick up the sword again like Thorfinn did. He just simply doesn't want to murder everyone who goes against him, like when his leg was injured and drew the circles when he was recognized as was challenged, yet all small fries stepped in.</br>  I want it to finish so I could reread or own it. I mean fuck I read it years ago and it was fantastic, but now can barely remember the events.  <br>yup yup. vagabond is the better one.</br>  Fuck yeah it's worth a read and when you're done with that read Vinland Saga.  <br>The Book of Five Rings states that it's superior but only after years of dedication. You should be able to wield the long sword with one hand as if you were wielding it with two.</br>  <br>Like I said, you don't have to like Thorfinn's extreme stance, which is obviously in its early stage and is obviously going to be developed throughout the story since there ARE going to be people who want to kill him. It doesn't make it pretentious though.</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't like it, or that I find it pretentious. I just pointed a major difference out.</br>  <br>Then why on earth are you quoting me? My original post was entirely about disputing the claim that vinland saga is pretentious. I never said one thing about Vagabond.</br>  <br>Excuse me, I didn't think getting quoted on an anonymous image board would actually offend somebody.</br>  <br>Not that guy quoting you. But I have to say it. A tad pretentious, is what the Thor moment was. Would make sense if the king guy got touched by it but would not admit it. And maybe cut of one his fingers or something. They instead become buddy buddy. And now that is how they will solve conflicts from now on. Suspension of disbelief works no longer after that.</br>  <br>Again, I'm going to have to say people really need to learn what pretentious means before they use it. What you describe is the problem of realism or believablity, hence your lack of suspense of disbelief after that.<br><br>A pretentious story has nothing to do with whether or not it's believable. It means that the story's theme is pretending to be much deeper or important than it is. A good example would be if a character namedrops famous philosophers, but those philosophers nor their ideas have any relation to the story nor its themes.</br></br></br>  <br>To continue, another example of pretentiousness is to use overly convoluted metaphors, symbols, or allusions so that the author can confuse the reader into thinking that there is lots of depth in his story when there is not.<br><br>When Thor states that a warrior needs no sword, he is stating directly. He's not hiding it in fancy words, nor is Yukimura drawing confusing symbols or whatnot. It's communicated to the audience in a very direct way. That's the opposite of being pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br>But it is pretending to be deep.<br>"Killing is not the answer, violence will never solve anything". The writer is trying to shove some idealistic bs down the readers throat. Now if it turned out that something like that would not work, then okay. But the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple. That is pretentious bs.<br><br>Why are you so triggered? There are people that actually stopped liking for that crap. And not for "hurr durr no more blood and gore".</br></br></br></br>  <br> if it turned out that something like that would not work <br>And I'm 100% sure it will not work.</br></br>  <br>I'm only triggered because people like you literally have no idea what pretentious is, yet continue to use it. Perhaps excusable if english is your 2nd or 3rd language, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br><br>Again, the message is not pretending to be deep in any way. Pretentiousness is concerned with the delivery of a message, not the content of its message. Its simply what it is. A stance advocating pacificsm. Its no more or no less pretentious than saying something like "violence is appropriate in certain circumstances."<br><br> the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple <br><br>Except we see directly IN THE STORY, that the solution is NOT that simple. Thorfinn's belief in pacifism is being continually challenged. And even if he himself doesn't pick up a sword, he can't make other people stop fighting either. He couldn't prevent Arneis's death nor her from utterly losing hope in the world. He can't do anything about the baby's family because he knows that blood feuds are an integral part of viking culture. It's like you completely missed every plot development in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> vinland <br> pretensious </br></br>  Viking mead&gt;sake  no thread so i'll make a new one<br><br>part 2 subs are up now http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>here's some quality Toei animation for you</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have the link to the Dbs torrent?  <br>It's on nyaa.</br>  Needs more piccolo  <br><br>Thank You biased anon.</br></br>  <br> first episode was utter, complete fillershit <br> The anime will use both BoG and RoF as ARCs = more filler <br> Gohan is a pansy <br> Goten is getting turned into a Pansy <br> Videl is waifumaterial <br> Chi-chi is a bitch as always <br> Satan is still a gloryloving faggot pansy <br> Satan is still not revealed to be a dud <br> Buu is hungry <br> Goten and Trunks are kids <br> Goten and Trunks fight a snake.

The next episode preview shows many events that happen in Battle of Gods, like Goku in a blue and white tracksuit on Kaio's world and Vegeta training against laser bots in the spaceship. The end of the episode with East Kaioshin and Old Kaioshin sensing Beerus also corresponds to the beginning of Battle of Gods.<br><br>This is not something that can act as a simple retcon to the movies.

It's always been the low-point of the movie for me. <br><br>Also, ever since Dragon Ball Minus we've known that Goku and Bulma are the same age.

He's 12 years old and she's 16, though he says he's 14 because he doesn't know how to count. Bulma just can't be 12 out of nowhere, and Goku can't be 16 either, or else he's 23 years old when he defeated Daimao Piccolo.<br><br>Maybe Minus took place at a different time than Jaco.</br></br></br></br>  Please tell me I can watch the Anime Labs subs online somewhere?  Was the first episode going for a slice-of-life type feel? I don't mind but at least make the episodes entertaining, this one was kind of meh.

His "ultimate" form in buu saga still lost.</br></br>  <br>It's more like turning more into a monkey<br><br>SS4 tried to copy this concept but for some reason it gave Goku pants, black hair and he lost the golden motif. Seriously, I have no idea why anybody thought that was a good idea</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, this is six months after Boo so he can still go to his highest state of Ultimate Gohan.<br><br>Another mark for Super against GT in that regard now that I think about it</br></br></br>  <br>It basically gets handwaved as "lol he didn't train so now he sucks more than Krillin, LOL NERD"<br><br>It pisses me off for a couple of reasons, for one there is no reason that he should be that much weaker, he slacked off for years between the Cell and Buu sagas and could still go SS2 (albeit a weaker version than when he fought Cell but he could still do it) but somehow, despite actually being even stronger at the end of the Buu saga he loses all of his strength in even less time. <br><br>It also reduces the amount of capable fighters in the show by one more, which pisses me off because it was already stale when all we had was Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Gotenks in the Buu saga and everyone else was too shit to do anything. Now we literally just have Goku and Vegeta as the only not shit fighters in the whole damn thing, it's so fucking stale having such a small portion of the cast being the only ones who ever actually DO anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it that those that complain the most about DBS are either niggers or mexicans? Niggers always claim that DBZ started with Raditz going to earth while Mexicans don't like anything not AAAAAAHHHHHHHH from the DB franchise.</br>  <br>Holy shit this is great</br>  <br>I'd like to think that Elder Kai unlocking his potential, while giving him a huge power boost, degrades faster without training due to being a super natural power up.<br><br>Besides it doesn't really matter if Gohan can only go super saiyan or still have his potential unlocked, the gap between him and Beerus is so big it isn't even relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>that's his Ultimate form you idiot<br><br>quoting:<br><br> "as Ultimate Gohan, he surpasses Super Saiyan 2 and even Super Saiyan 3 (according to the Super Exciting Battle Guide; he is confirmed stronger than Gotenks in the manga/anime). Daizenshuu 2 states that Ultimate Gohan is still capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, but even without utilising the form he surpasses Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks in power, if Ultimate Gohan was to become a Super Saiyan his power would likely rise to levels above even Super Buu (Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks absorbed)." </br></br></br></br></br>  Wait a fucking second, someone enlighten me please<br><br>Battle of Gods starts 4 years after the battle with Buu<br><br>Super starts 6 months after the battle with Buu<br><br>Both are canon<br><br>Why did they set the start of Super earlier than BoG?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try watching the original dragon ball in Japanese.

He's a god of destruction though so be nice </br>  Reminder that people who say BoG is filler slice of life crap with not enough action are shitters and it doesn't matter if they prefer DB or DBZ because they're simply wrong as it is easily the best movie we've seen for DB. Ironically the one of the fight scenes in that movie was possibly the best in the series and animated by the guy who did Krillin vs Goku for the Dragon Ball anime.<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/2a8250d<wbr>28ad500f15c277a25e829699a.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br>I see what you did there.</br>  <br> BoG babies <br> it's different than Z so that must mean it's good </br></br>  What is the best subs for DBS?  <br><br>BoG has the same tone as Majin, Buu and Super saga. People who are mad at BoG's comedic values are simply wrong if they say it isn't in the spirit of Z nevermind the series.<br><br>By the way, who are you quoting?  :^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>As hard it is to accept, Dragon Ball isn't the same without the cel shaded animation</br>  <br>What the hell has changed? He's gotten a tad bit more mature, but that's really it.</br>  <br>The character has changed very little, but his strength in comparison to the rest of the universe has grown at an insane rate and the scenarios he encounters have gotten cosmic in scale to cope with it.<br><br>Goku doesn't need to be like a kid, he either needs to be out of the picture, or simply weaker.</br></br></br>  <br> He's gotten a tad bit more mature, but that's really it. <br><br>Kid Goku was a naive hothead, but after he grew up and trained with Kami he literally became more of a generic hero.<br><br>Kid Goku murdered the fuck out of the red ribbon army, as well as King Piccolo and his demons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I think if you ask a lot of people they miss cel shaded animation. Digital painting is cool and can work very well (REDLINE) but most of the time the old cel shading method brought in some cool imperfections and effect that is too hard to replicate in digital painting.<br><br>Could be worse, could be CG like the fight through capsule city in that movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>man that part where the cams panning around goku gets me so pumped</br>  <br> BoG has the same tone as Majin, Buu <br><br>It's like we didn't even watch the same show. I think Boredom of Gods was passable as a whole but humor in DB/DBZ had cohesive value and good pacing while BoG was all over the place. If I really wanted to blame something, it would be that all of this wasn't made 10 years ago to be honest.<br><br> Although BoG had some cool ideas like Vegeta's shenanigans the rest barely compares to the 40th WSJ special, and that's saying a lot. Extra points for bringing Pilaf's gang back though. </br></br></br></br></br>  What subs are you fags using? Only tried animerg or something. They're passable but with some sync issues. <br><br>What do you recommend?</br></br>  <br>Only the first episode is out; just download all of the releases and compare yourself</br>  <br>I understood more without shitty subs than with shitty subs on. Shitty subs were just distracting.<br><br>Don't even speak moonrunes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's your problem. I guess you watch instead of reading the manga? I'm going to go through Majin and Buu saga before I get to my point with Battle of Gods.<br><br>There was an editor switch after Cell games arc was finished and Majin saga started to resemble original Dragon Ball comedy. I mean, the terror of the universe was literally pic related and the reveal around it was fucking hilarious. Also not to mention the tournament fights with Trunks and Goten, the fusion mishap with Supreme Kai and Gotenks in general. It was still a retarded power level battle shonen by this point but it was a strong call to form for the finale to return make the final villain become a good guy which hadn't been done since Vegeta.<br><br>Overall, despite Earth being FUBAR it was really light-hearted compared to Cell, Android, Namek and Saiyan sagas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched the anime and I own the manga, who do you think you're talking to? BoG's problem is that it resembled neither of them. It tried to be its own spin on DB. Some of it went good, some went bad. Super is not really trying to be good, but we're only on the first episode, so we'll see.</br>  <br>continuation<br><br><br>Battle of Gods for me was more of that in a feature film format. We already know the characters other than the two antagonistic figures we met in the film. We're introduced to a bit of mingling and characters interacting with eachother we've never really seen before outside of Toei non-canon bullshit and the events leading up to Beerus losing his shit were great and funny. <br><br>The rest of the movie is standard action schlock because Beerus threatens Earth like other series villains. However it has one of the few moments in the series where Goku actually has character development and becomes a little more selfless after the clash - even as a new character Beerus comes away from it all with a nice new perspective and new-found respect for our dumbass hero.<br><br>I cannot see the problem with the pacing other than the horrible sudden introduction of the legend of a 'Super Saiyan God' (was a lot better with Shenron than with Beerus and Whis.) The movie was honestly fine and well contained. <br><br>A lot of the comedy was lost on me in a re-watch for the American dub. Consider re-watching it at one point in the Japanese dub if you ever feel like giving it another chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can I watch this without having fully watched the old series?  <br>yes</br>  <br>Yes easily<br>If you like shonens then this is a chill watch<br><br>all you need to know is its late in the series, the MC (Goku) is an adult with a family, theres a whole bunch of established characters and abilities, and almost everyone of them is irrelevant anyway so you wont miss much</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>continuation<br><br><br><br>Something about Super's first episode has me really excited but I'm sure it won't last for long. It's that the series is finally giving more care to relationships with other characters e.g. Piccolo and Gohan, some well deserved Goku actually trying to be a father before he fucks off to King Kai's planet again.<br><br>The show is still meant for children who are a single digit of age but it feels like wish furfillment and still has the same magic of the old Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and the recent movie (not seen RoF yet) which all Toei originals have lacked. I guess it's something to do with Toriyama actually producing the stories and characters for these works and the Toei screenwriter he's working with since BoG being kinda cool.<br><br>tl;dr same tone, older movies (i.e. Broly) possibly think things like Uchiha Sasuke is cool or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toei non-canon bullshit <br>You mean like BoG?<br><br> events leading up to Beerus losing his shit were great and funny <br>It could have been done in a less bland way.<br><br> I cannot see the problem with the pacing other than the horrible sudden introduction of the legend of a 'Super Saiyan God' <br>I didn't even mind this, I have seen much more stupid junk before.<br><br>I see where you're coming from but you're really making BoG look better than it actually is. To me, it's not really worth a re-watch. But I'm no one to tone down your enthusiasm like this, so I'll just stop.<br><br>I didn't even see the American dub of BoG because I'm not American. Didn't even see my native dub to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>fans of older movies (sans Fusion)*</br></br>  <br> &gt;Toei non-canon bullshit <br> You mean like BoG? <br><br>Nah lad, done talking with you. It isn't just hype, he did work on the last 2 movies, OVA and Super.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Yo Son Goku and his friends return" was the only decent DB related thing to come out in the past 10 years.</br>  <br> &gt;Japanese voices are the best <br> literal tranny goku <br><br>nah</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Europe were in to DB way before mexicans and americans.</br></br>  So it's starting before BoG and RoF, but going through them reimagining them.....so are they also going to go through Yo! Son Goku etc. and bring in Tarbles??  <br><br>I love DB as much as the next guy, but you're sure you're not trying too hard to act as a special snowflake and treating perfectly standard stuff as a second coming of God?<br><br>Maybe the feeling of Funimation's DBZ (and its fanbase) was hammered so much in your head you're now realizing how DB and Goku's character was actually supposed to feel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how they made goten a lot smaller than trunks. reminds me of how goku was much smaller than krillin and then grew so tall. I loved that episode where goku grew up to a teenager at the tournament with piccolo</br>  Question for sub anon,<br>after you make all these srt files for the different parts are you going to put them into one single srt file? so we can put the subtitles with the torrent version?<br>Also good job man</br></br>  <br>Goku was never smaller than Krillin<br><br>Wen they first met, Goku was a bit taller</br></br></br>  Does anyone know when the english dub will come out? I don't think I can handle Goku's voice  is this done under toriyamas direction? and if so, anyone else feels like he should finally move past dragonball and create a new series?<br><br>remember when he moved past dr slump? and how everyone got the hots for db? imagine what he could do if he actually left it behind for good.<br>and not just like with that neko majin miniseries which was basically another db parody. i mean, really leaving this whole fighing, muscles, glowing golden crap behind</br></br></br>  <br>go watch japanese kid goku and then go to super<br><br>you'll get used to it that way</br></br></br>  <br>I've watched DB in japanese, but it just bothers me that an adult male talks like a japanese woman</br>  <br> anyone else feels like he should finally move past dragonball <br><br>Do you seriously think Toriyama wanted to do more Dragon Ball aside for some funny one shots?

I won't even look at the first episode.  <br>Why does the Animation look like shit?</br>  <br>She believes in chastity and follows the bullshit ideals of Mari, hence why she's pissed off at Kiyoshi. He caught her taking a piss, she's scared of anyone finding out, she is seeking vengeance, and her quest for revenge turns into an obsession for Kiyoshi.</br>  Can wait for the first episode and the series becoming more popular  <br>The animation for a manga that looks like Prison School will inevitably falter in comparison.<br><br>You don't need to watch it if you don't want to.</br></br></br>  <br>This<br><br>I'll probably just stick to the manga but if the anime gets more PS fans then great.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are not let them watch &amp; find out?</br>  The designs look pretty bad.

There was no way they were going to do justice to the manga's god tier art anyway.I just hope the animation isn't complete shit.

There would be no reason for that to be censored...right?</br>  <br>You mean the only fucking voice he knows how to do?<br>But seriously, the casting for Kiyoshi was spot on. It was close to how I was imagining his voice in the manga.</br></br>  <br> I know that Japan's broadcast will be censored, but what about Funi's release? <br>How fucking new are you?</br></br>  <br>DxD (both dub and sub) and Shinometa this season are censored through them.</br>  Holy fuck I've never heard a voice fit so badly.<br><br>Hana Kana does not fit her at all.</br></br>  <br>how do the designs looks bad?</br>   Hana Kana <br><br>Her voice just stands out so much now. I don't even hear a character anymore, I just hear Hana Kana standing behind a mic.</br></br>  <br> BotI's adaptation <br>Fuck, I had already forgot that exists.</br></br>  <br>Are you a faggot? I wish every character in existence was voiced by HanaKana.</br>  <br>Really? I actually hate her in every role she's had other than kuragehime and nisekoi, but I think she fits both of those perfectly. <br><br>I know it's kind of mainstream as well but I can totally see her being voiced by Yu Kobayashi using a very neutral tone into her batshit insane voice for the shifts.</br></br></br>   more angry Hana Kana <br><br>YES. MY DICK IS READY.</br></br>  I don't think the voice choice was bad. It is not like this is Beatrice in Umineko.  <br>Stop being such a faggot. You're gonna watch this shit like the rest of us</br>    I want Hanazawa Kana to shout at me more.  <br>Mah nigga<br>You and I, Anon</br></br>  <br>Then you should probably kill yourself<br><br>The voice does not fit Hana</br></br></br>  <br>Your dick doesn't fit Hana.</br>  Chiyo CM when?  <br>It's kanazawa hana, nerd</br>  animation look like shit  <br>God the art looks terrible<br><br>Dropped</br></br></br>  <br>Something's off here. But I do love me some Hana. Waterworks when?</br>  <br> Chiyo CM when? <br>tomorrow<br><br><br> The voice does not fit Hana <br>i think too, but they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Kanahana and think she would fit the roll better if she wasn't making her voice sound like nadeko. I was really excited for the mad hana scenes because i love kanahana's angry voice. The art looks good, its probably the best they could do given the manga art being on par with Onepunch Man in terms of beauty. I still have faith for the adaption being enjoyable but i know it wont compare with the anime; as long as the anime spawns new hentai Ill be happy.  <br>She was good in AgK as a batshit insane cyborg.</br>  <br>Compare with the manga* too early for me to be making coherent sentences.</br>  I kinda wish this was 3D instead. Sidonia looks good and JC staff never draws nipples. So shokugeki flopped.  <br>It will spawn porn, which will be the only good thing the anime ends up doing</br>  all these niwakashitters mad about their niwaka manga series being adapted not to their liking, fuckin comedy :)  I cant help but to keep image hanazawa peeing in my face.  <br>It's not such a bad image.</br>  <br>She... doesn't look like Hana.</br>  <br>I was kinda hoping differently, but that doesn't make any sense unless they are forcing the company to censor it? Yet, of the license agreement is with distributor/company there's no reason to give Funi a censored copy to broadcast.<br><br>Hell, Funi could even advertise having the uncensored one to entice more customers. If the show is, genuinely, good people will buy it anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>The reference design looks like her early chapter appearance but the artists couldn't remotely match that with how low the budget must be, ontop of not being able to animate this to any degree. Might aswell be Inferno Cop tier shit</br>  <br> Sidonia looks good <br> liking low framerate ugly CGshit <br><br>Opinion discarded.</br></br></br></br>  Kanahana sounds too far from what I had in mind. Lately anime adaptations are killing enjoyment from manga for me. I'm giving it 5 minutes max. Skipped SnS, probably gonna skip this too.  <br> that voice <br>Glad she isn't my favorite character anyway.</br></br>  <br>Cause all these cocksuckers want the plot spoon fed to them.</br>  <br>Lets be honest, noone's art work will do this man any justice.<br>I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either<br><br><br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>FML<br><br>Hopefully Chaos Dragon delivers with lewd seiyuus. I need sex in my ears</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   JC Staff <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>  <br> hana <br> hanakana <br><br>Japanese humour knows no boundaries!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kiyoshi <br> Hiroshi <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br></br>  she looks fine<br><br>you niggers whine too much</br></br>  So that's how you choose a V.A. for your anime these days!  <br> &gt;/out/ </br>  jesus fuck that voice.. kill me pls  <br>Of course not anon she isnt real</br>  I remember a lot of people wanting Hanakana as Hana long before the anime was anounced.<br><br>Now nobody wants her.</br></br>  I like HanaKana but that moe voice don't suit Hana at all!!<br><br>I imagined her voice would be deeper tho.</br></br>  <br>I absolutely love it, first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary.<br>Is this gap-moe?</br></br>  Doesn't look that bad  <br> first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary. <br>That's how it was supposed to be but it sounds too forced here. I really liked Nadeko's batshit insane voice, but apparently she forgot how to act since then.</br></br>  <br>Because she, along with everyone that likes her, is an insufferable autist.</br>  <br>He also can do the edgemaster Izaya\Levi voice.</br>  <br>VA is shit. Goddamn, it doesn't fit her at all.</br>  I can see the problem that everyone is having here as it's a bit off putting, but I imagine that, after a bit, we'll get used to it.  JC staff , please learn to lip synch. That shit is cringeworthy.  <br>SONANOKA OHOHAHAHAHA~</br>  <br>That's how she's supposed to sound. She acts like a nice girl at first.<br><br>People who say HanaKana's voice is unfitting have no idea what they're talking about. It sounds fucking perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds like shit.</br>  <br>This.Her insane rage voice &gt; her moe shit.</br>  <br>It's better animated than I expected. Hope it stays like that while airing.</br>  why does she have boobs  <br>is this from those digital magazine?</br>  Meh.<br>I like Hana Kana but I don't think her voice fits for this role.</br>  Meh, I'm not feeling it. I like HanaKana, but it's not exactly the voice I had in mind for Hana.  <br>HAI HAI HAI DICKITAL MAGAJIN DA YOO NEEEE~</br>  <br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br>  <br>Just a bro who obviously has good taste.</br>  <br> posts 9 seconds apart <br> samefag </br></br>  <br> 11:28:27 <br> 11:28:36 </br></br>  <br> Hana Kana has done only one lewd role <br> What is Neptunia and Iris Heart? </br></br>  <br>Why is the art so bad? Also her voice doesn't fit. This is going to be a disaster.</br>  <br> JC staff never draws nipples <br>You need to watch more JC staff anime if you think that. I bet you think they never draw toddlers in bondage too.</br></br>  <br>I think the problem is with the color palette. I don't know, it just feels off. Everything else actually looks OK.<br>I also find it amusing how everyone was saying HanaKana was perfect for this role, now we have plenty of people who don't agree.</br></br>  Dropped  <br><br>Oh wow</br></br>  <br><br>newfag</br></br>  <br>So cool onee-saaaan droppinga a show is soooo manlyyy</br>  <br><br> hanazawa voice didnt give you a boner </br></br>  <br> Nine fucking seconds <br> Samefagging </br></br>  <br>Better luck next time, kid.</br>  <br>The art looks good to me. I mean, it's impossible for animation to be faithful to such high quality manga art, but they got close enough.</br>  <br>Is Kate getting animated?</br>  <br>Not unless there a season 2. God i hope not.</br>  <br>no, they couldve done an ova covering certain chapters. The good chapters of course, but the japs chose quantity over quality</br>  She sounds too much like Mayuri and her angry voice isn't as good as her angry Nadeko.<br><br>Kinda disappointing.</br></br>  I guess because the manga is black and white but I feel everything looks a little too bright.  <br><br>Tuturu~ <br>Hanachan-desu~<br>Okarin~ did you get my metal umpa?</br></br></br></br>  <br>An OVA wouldn't necessarily have better art.</br>  <br>It's JC staff. They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre. The animation is subpar and the anime will have shit pacing. Don't expect it to reach the prison break out.</br>  <br>where the hell would it even end?</br>  Meh. Not a fan of hanakana for this role tbh.  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>Like you even need to worry about that.</br></br>  <br>I'll screen cap this for laughs when PS anime reach break out arc</br>  <br>Tuturu, motherfucker.</br>  <br>Anon, 540p is your friend</br>  <br>1080p!!!!60fps</br>   that blazer shading <br><br>They should fire the coloring staff, it looks like it was a baby's first time shading using photoshop.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's the shading that makes this look off. Should have just painted shit black.</br>   Mari PV...maybe 40 posts <br> Meiko PV...no more than 30 posts <br> Hana PV...already 130+ posts <br><br>Is it because of Hana's voice or is it because it's Hana? Is this going to be a case of everyone just bitching about the anime in these threads, because too many people read the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>People love Hana, Vice-Prez was pretty meh in the entire manga. Mari and Chiyo are more liked than her, even Risa might be more liked here than Meiko. <br>The complaining in any adaption thread always comes from people who want to see something they like done well, not done terribly. <br><br>I felt the same way for Sidonia no Kishi being ugly as fuck 3DCG.</br></br></br></br>  My god, JC staff made Hana look like the bland bitch from bakuman, but blonde.  <br>fucking disgusting</br>  Holy fuck this show looks ugly. Might actually drop it.<br>Snakefags will love angry Kanahana though and she seems to pull it off pretty well.</br>  <br> They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre <br>What the fuck are you smoking?</br></br>  <br> Watching Bakuman. </br>  <br>voice doesn't fit at all</br>  the show would be better if it was adapted by shaft or deen  <br>Are you high? Meiko was the cover and face of promotional material for the series before Hana's popularity soared.</br>  Hana doesn't deserve this much of love from /a/  <br>Hana's shit. Praise Mari, Chiyo and Meiko. cough</br>    <br>Talking about here, and Hana was always more liked than Vice-Prez.</br>  <br> the show would be better if it was adapted by (...) deen </br>  <br>the voice isn't in sync.......</br>  <br>Oh you.</br>  <br>The lines said are separate from the images shown, they are never in sync because they aren't from the same scene.</br>  I think it fits her initial appearance when the boys thought she was nice and cute before she started killing them. But I can't imagine hana sounding like that after that, especially with the more recent chapters.  <br>only for disgusting tsunderefags<br>the only time hana was even a little likeable is when she cried because kiyoshi wouldn't ourboros with her</br></br>  Meiko is horribly underrated on /a/.  <br>which makes no sense, she's the only usc who seems to be have the potential to become loyal and caring wife</br>  <br>Whats the name of that pv music?</br>  <br>Snore.</br>  <br>Even if we accept your point, snore &gt; kicked in the face.<br>For the same reason that 0 &gt; -15</br></br>  <br>It's the OP of the show</br>  <br>Yes because sweating cows are disgusting.</br>  <br>If we accept your point, since Chiyo is the most peaceful girl in the series, Chiyo &gt; Meiko.</br>  <br>If we judge girls based on their worst possible chiyo &gt; meiko<br>If we judge girls based on their best possible meiko &gt; chiyo<br>In both cases chiyo&gt;hana and meiko&gt;hana.<br>Hana a shit.<br>Only mari is worse than her and that's not saying much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With shows like this you always run into the problem that the porn tends to be boring.</br>  Are they even trying? The voice acting is so exaggerated it makes me cringe. <br><br>When she's nice, she sounds 5 octaves too high and when she's mad she's 5 too low along with the stupid guttural tone. Anime itself is generally an exaggerated fantasy, but this is a bit much.</br></br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' <br>Chiwa Saito is always there.</br></br>  <br>Chiwa Saito wouldn't have fit Hana. Besides HanaKana (which works, you fags are too whiney) I can only see Ayane Sakura or Aoi Yuuki working for her.</br>  <br>Somebody needs to go back to Logic 101. I've been told that won't cover achieving a refined taste, but maybe you'll learn something in the road.</br>  <br>Out of curiosity, with which of the 4 lines, -exclude the hana a shit one- do you want to try to disagree with?</br>  <br><br>What makes HIramoto's art distinctive is his attention to shadows and shading. <br><br>All of today's anime are done digitially so it is nearly impossible to do shading and shadows unless it is physically painted and shaded for specific shots in like pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was always liked tard. Clearly you forget the hand holding scene.</br>  <br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>That and binbougami. Rize y Sakura the best for me the rest it's a big meh</br></br>  <br> she was always liked <br>yes. <br>by tsunderefags.</br></br></br>  <br>And the kiss scene, and literally every scene shes in. People love unresolved sexual tension, hana and the MC are the only ones with ridiculous amounts of it.</br>  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>You don't. You really, really don't.</br></br>  <br> People like a character i don't. I better start shitposting their threads! </br>  Tuturu!  <br>I hate tsundere but like Hana. What now, faggot?</br>  <br>Not fond of tsundere but hana is great. You can eat shit.</br>  <br>ughhh.. too cutesy default voice</br>  Yuu Kobayashi would have been great.  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>She's not in enough things. <br><br><br>I think Hana is one of the better female characters in the story and it has nothing to do with her being an tsundere, at all. She's really unique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is though.</br>  <br> not omigawa chiaki <br>shit<br><br> all that QUALITY <br>dropped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it isn't, PS is unique</br>  <br>Her VA sucks balls</br>   artwork is shit  <br>Its the same artwork as the first chapters of the manga. However, PS manga artwork does progressively get better quality.<br><br> Voice is shit <br>Really? You should just drop it and move on, <br> Shitposting <br>Fucking Christ. In Every damn thread</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you defending it so hard?</br>  I figured HanaKana would be better suited Chiyo  <br> for Chiyo </br>  <br>I thought I was being neutral<br>I have a request<br>Can you compare the PV and Manga in the same scene where Hana introduced herself. I really like to see the comparison<br>Im on my phone, so I can't do shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sir, Would you kindly...... EAT SHIT</br>  Am I the only one thinking the viz prez tits are too FUCKING big? <br>They look awesomely glorious in the manga, here they are gargantuan air balloons, they break her form and aren't remotely attractive.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this<br><br>Hana is not this big<br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true with all anime adaptations.</br>  I don't really think the angry voice HanaKana does fits her too much, we will just have to wait and see  <br>Where the fuck are you when Meiko's PV was released?</br>  <br> tfw she has the least likes </br>  <br>The anime made her look ridiculous</br>  <br> First musume <br> Now this <br><br>What else is poor anime going to ruin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Though I really liked her voice.<br> Mari was also spot on. </br></br>  <br>Is that HanaKana?</br>  <br>You can't do any shading at all digitally?</br>  <br>Yes, it's the Psycho Pass chick</br>  <br>and mainstream</br>  <br>I dont get why people say this is poorly animated? That kick looked great. Are you all just finding something to complain about?</br>  <br>The art style. Can't ever expect it to look like the mangaka's work, but it's way too bland compared to it.</br>  <br>[url]https://<span>youtu.be/KE9WCa6MFk0[/<wbr>url]</wbr>  [ ] Meiko</br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br>That spit.<br>I'm not a Meiko fan but damn, that was hot as fuck.</br></br>  <br> let's make her boobs bigger than her head <br> the nerds will love that <br><br>Who the fuck thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast.<br>Unless you have those specific fetishes.</br></br>  <br><br>Those out-shape lard bags are ridicolous, they don't even look like fake assess...<br>Also, the "IT'S HER FUCKING NIPPLE" scene is going to look atrocious instead of boner inducing because of that.</br></br></br>  I don't think they could've picked a worse cast for this.  <br> She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast. <br>You saying you didn't want to lick the sweat running along her inner thigh, following its trail all the way up to her drenched cunt?</br></br>  <br>It's the anime that sucks design-wise, in the manga she's a sex bomb.<br> On a side note... u gay, nigga? </br></br>  <br>Fuck, I thought her voice would have been better, it's shit though.</br>  Can't wait to hear Kamiya cookie cutter voice and ruin this show even more.  <br>don't know how this works, so I put it like this</br>  <br>The fuck are those cowtits?</br>   HanaKana fans will defend this   <br>Your new is showing, go back to lurking.</br>  <br>Maybe you're the faggot.</br>  <br><br>Yeah that was silly to say, any effect/shading can be achieved nowadays, that stuff simply isn't in vogue.</br></br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence <br>So every seiyuu with actual talent?<br>Fucking burgers knowing shit about dubbing as usual.</br></br></br>  I havent read Prison School in what feels like forever<br><br>Which chapter is the one where the President says "No one has so much as put a finger inside me" ?</br></br>  <br>yeah, url... <br>I just said a while ago</br></br>  <br>I've tried to find what the fuck niwaka means for some time now without any success.</br>  <br>Who knows, It's probably around chapter 100 or even later.

He got a little quiet when I asked him and then he got started to get mad. I asked him what was wrong and it turns out he was furious over the fact a villain was named after him, especially one that killed two main characters.

Even worse than early part 4.</br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded, I was actually going to comment how the faces aren't actually the same but it's not official Araki art so it doesn't matter either way</br>  <br> part </br>  <br><br>Can you explain what you mean? Is it a reference to this song? Don't have headphones so I can't listen to it atm</br></br>  They're missing the continuous spine drawing but these are JJL volumes, aren't they?  <br>I think Araki is self aware of the sameface-ness in part 7</br>  <br>holy fuck is this photoshopped or is this really Araki's art? I never noticed the sameface</br>  <br>Reminder this nearly got her raped, twice.</br>  <br>Still waiting for any on-panel sex in JoJo.</br>    <br> covers <br> Anything outside the actual manga pages after 『Heaven』  <br><br>Literally even in the manga in most panels I can't tell the characters faces apart except for mista with his eyes. Abbachio's lipstick helps, but only so much. Everyone else have the exact same jaws, noses, and cheeks. <br><br>I would go on a stretch to say that all gang members and even many of the villains have the same eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has to happen, has to. It's obvious Araki is going for an actual love thing this part and both of them are technically adults so they just gotta have sex at some point</br>   Z fighters with timestop <br>How fucked would  the world  be?</br>  <br>Sex? Is that a『Stand』power?<br><br><br>Thanks as always, Doc</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a reason Whis is considered to be way more powerful than Beerus.</br>   Tarot cards <br> Egyptian gods <br> Music <br><br>Araki could use some movies too, stands like 「P u l p F i c t i o n」or 「S p a c e O d y s s e y」</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not,Toriyama retconned that</br>  <br>I just remembered that Bowie has a song named like that, my mistake.</br>  <br>And he also said that SSGSS is weaker than SSG. At this point, I'll just go with Death of the Author and follow what the anime and movies say.</br>  <br>「MADE IN STAR KILLER KING PLATINUM CRIMSON WORLD HEAVEN QUEEN」</br>  <br> Made in Heaven <br>Where's the horse dick?</br></br>  <br>correction, are the clocks at his waist from MiH?</br>  Why didn't Jotaro become a manga artist to rival/ surpass  Rohan with his Star Platinum? We all saw how fast and great his Egyptian Fly looked and that was just from some shitty picture.  <br>So this stand is basically the master of time ?<br><br><br>Jotaro doesn't have creativity or the will to write comics. SP was just a printer from what he saw.  inb4 Rohan said comics are based on reality so if he just writes down what he saw as a stand user he'd be fine </br></br></br></br>  <br>he isnt passionate about it</br>  <br>You mean like in some of the alternate universes presented in Jorge Joestar?</br>  <br>Plus, when was the last time Jotaro drew anything on-panel?</br>  <br>Weird Al posted about JoJo on his instagram.</br>  <br> So this stand is basically the master of time ? <br>Doesn't have Mandom in there.</br></br>  so how would you kill pucci before he achieves MIH?  <br>It's either the master of time or uses all the abilities at the same time resulting in nothing, which makes it the shittiest Stand.</br>  <br>Probably, I mean there were those posters on that store window somewhere in japan with Gouda and Yamato dressed as Gappy and Yasuho</br>  <br> Who is Guldo </br>  <br> ditch Jolyne  <br>All Jotaro had to do to kill Pucci</br></br>  <br>If Josuke or maybe even Giorno were there i'm sure he would've let Jolyne get hit since he knew she could be healed up just fine</br>  <br>Giorno was in Florida too, fucking shit Jotaro chose the worst time to be an actual father</br>  <br>He might have been. That's as committal as Araki was about it and it was only on an info page added to the tanko.<br><br>So basically, Giorno is entirely irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Guldo was NEVER creative with time stopping though. He just ran away with it and failed miserably at his one attempt at attacking with it. I mean fuck, he had telekinesis as well. He had those fights in the bag.<br><br>If he were smart he probably could have killed all three of them, but just because you have mind powers does not mean you have common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be so cute if afterwards Josuke gets excited about sleeping on a bed with Yasuho.</br>  <br> Sex? Is that a『Stand』power? <br>The first thing Jotaro said to his wife in bed.</br></br>  <br>Honestly there is no real feasible defense against time stopping. Unless you have a consistent aura or ward that prevents contact (Like the Hamon to Dio) then no armor or muscle tensing will protect you from whatever hits you in an instant. <br><br>All Guldo would have to do is use what minimal power he had to blast a hole in their chests and bam, he wins. I mean if Krillin could do it to Vegeta when he was not prepared, there is no way they could have been prepared for the very moment Guldo decided to blast through them.<br><br>I was never a fan of the 'nerf an immensely OP power by making the user an idiot' maneuver. It just makes it feel like wasted potential.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would 4 balls slapping during sex look or sound like?<br><br>Also why is part 8 so damn kinky?<br><br>Rape, dominatrix, bondage, underage seduction, incest attraction, yasuho being fondled by a child every other chapter, holly being all footplay with the nurse, 4 balls, boners, tons of josuke nudity.<br><br>Is this araki's blue ball period?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What would 4 balls slapping during sex look or sound like? <br><br>Just watch gay porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that part 2 literally ended by showing Jotaro, whereas part 3 ended with no teasing of anything</br>  <br>That's because Part 1 and 2 were building up to 3. They HAD to show part 3 to assure fans that they were going to get through the mainstream series of Jojo, since they were getting a year break.<br><br>From here on out, it's uncertainty, because the first major overarching plot is done. Starting with part 4, we start getting into crazy shit about arrows and such. <br><br>We'll see if we are getting part four in the coming months. I am betting we'll get an announcement sometime this fall.</br></br></br></br></br>  Explain how Jotaro's hat/hair works.  <br>Hair grows from his scalp.<br>Hat rests on his head.</br></br>  <br>It's just a weird oddly shaped hat, it's easily recognizable when you see white clothes Jotaro</br>  <br>Joseph literally pulled a tommy guny and a dozen grenades out of nowhere in his first fight, get fucked animefag.</br>    <br> Joseph only asspulled once <br>Joseph please<br>Call me when you figure out how The Sun works</br></br></br>  <br>It just works.</br>  <br>How do explain this from literally the page before all the Tommy gun and grenade stuff happens?<br><br>He was hiding it in his oversized fucking jacket.

That pic isn't the best indicator of it, but here's where his hair and hat meet.</br>  <br><br>You can really see in the early manga how Jotaro's hair was basically just like Joseph's but with half a hat on top of it.</br></br>  <br> jotaro's fucking eyebrows </br>    <br>It's amazing how Johnny became soulless<br>I mean,what the fuck is the third pic even supposed to convey?

I was saying the artstyle has changed. Hence why I used ""<br><br>It certainly looks a lot different now to the style in </br></br></br></br>  <br>meant to point to </br>  <br>Mid would really be anywhere from entering the second third to leaving it and we're definitely in the second third. We have the core principle of the series set up (defeat the rockmen, find out about the rokakaka, recover Josuke's memories) and we knew who Josuke is now and we have a potential big bad in Jobin.</br>  <br><br>It looks different, but there's no point in identifying a "mid" point when it might only be a third of the way done.
