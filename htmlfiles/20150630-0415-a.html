[ Bravo  Oh fuck, I didn't even catch that.<br><br>Literally bravo.</br></br>  <br>Ufo just loves those</br>  <br>True, some are easier to pick out than others though. Saber shots are from 19, and Shirou shots are from 20.</br>  <br>This shit though isn't even referencing anything Ufo's animated in the first place.</br>  <br>It's loveable</br>  <br> Bonfire Lit </br>  <br>Well done.</br>  <br>Goddammit that sloth mushroom playing vidya instead of keep up giving up good stories, at least he delivered.</br>  <br>Did F/Z have this amount of pottery?</br>    <br>I hate this one. They're not even remotely similar, what comparison are you trying to draw here?</br>  <br>is that archa and rin on the 2nd panel ?</br>  <br>dunno...</br>  <br>Dude, the intent of the scene is that they are similar. Saber outright says Shirou's copying Archer's style.</br>  <br>No, it's Archer and Bin; Rin's cousin.</br>  <br><br><br>Parry and then horizontal slash?<br> Kind of stretching it though </br></br></br></br>  <br>no, maybe, I don't know</br>  <br> Rin failed <br><br>Wow, I never interpreted the end of UBW this way.</br></br></br>  <br>couldn't really remember Rin wearing a white outfit and Archer having wraps on his arm.</br>  <br><br><br>Because Shirou = Saber parallel was official since the VN. That OP makes it even clearer, he's pulling fucking Caliburn.</br></br></br>    <br>First two images are from episode 5, where Rin and Shirou first become partners.<br><br>Last image is from some of the last shots of episode 25 where they say they'll have a happily ever after.</br></br></br>  they had sex off screen after holding hands. Camera panned out and sky darken  <br>Rin being the worst character is nothing new.</br>  <br>And we got this.</br>  <br> not the educated prostitute </br>  <br>Ahh thanks anon, So it was Shirou with the wraps.</br>  <br>She didn't fail. The after credits scene was symbolism.</br>  <br>Shit, wrong webm.</br>  <br> The after credits scene was symbolism. <br>who the fuck was talking about the after credits? Goddamn this autism triggers mine</br></br>  <br>Listen. Just because a rainbow tart decides to summon the best servant there is doesn't mean that she gets supreme executive authority over the throne of heroes. That is why Shirou broke her couch.</br>  <br>He grew some balls.</br>  <br> Lancer didn't crack the ground when he went fast <br><br>Is he slower than Archer?</br></br></br>  <br> sticking your dick into a can of worms </br>  <br>You should probably watch after the credits one more time.</br>  <br>People just tend to bring it up when people interpret the scene as Shirou still becoming Archer.</br>  <br>Better be something in the BDs.</br>  <br>Well there is no defending him there.</br>  <br>did Archer ever lose memory of his past in ep 00. Or was he pretending not to know</br>  <br>Canonically the second fastest after Achilles. But vn only fags will tell you servants outside of F/SN and HA don't count.</br>  <br>Shirou still becomes a hero, but he doesn't become Archer or anything like that. Nasu's notes for the scene confirm this.</br>  <br>It was a mistranslation.</br>  <br>drama cds</br>  <br>But Shirou from Fate and UBW will become Archer. Not a bitter jerk-Counter Guardian but still.</br>  <br>Pretending. It had been so long that he barely remembered Rin until that moment though. It was just by regular fading of long ago memories rather than failed summoning.</br>    <br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope. <br> Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait. <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br> (To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)" <br><br> He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point. <br><br>This?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer is a copy of the CG Emiya Shirou summoned into an Archer class container in the Grail War. Neither Fate Shirou or UBW Shirou are this person. Neither of them even make a contract with Alaya.</br>  <br>About speed does somebody has this ever been updated?</br>  <br>he maybe was somehow cloudy, but he seems to had recognized Rin, but apparently didn't remember her name. Everything was clear for him when he saw saber</br>  <br>So Nasu is retconning Shirou's fate then?</br>  <br> Tokiomi can maximize Gilgamesh's stats <br> Rin can't even maximize Emiya's <br>Rin BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>No, none of the Shirous in FSN become Archer. UBW in particular goes on to surpass Archer.</br>  <br>No shit, what else do you do with a sword? Play Catch?</br>  <br>Maybe she's inherently shit at being a master despite being a super magus. Like the opposite of Kariya.</br>  <br>Archer just tells half truths, he wasn't lying to her. He didn't remember her name, or the city at first, He had forgotten many things of his live in Fuyuki because of his time as a CG, he said that during his fight with shirou. He only remembers those things that marked him, the fire and Saber</br>  <br>He was lying to her. What she asked him was who he was and he said he didn't know. She didn't even ask him if he remembered stuff like that because she didn't know he was even from the modern age.</br>  <br>The QUALITY jesus</br>  <br>Ask Gilgamesh.</br>  <br>That's due to the fame bonus. Sort of.<br><br>Rin summoned Emiya prior to his ''kickass' time. Hakuno summoned him DURING that time so his stats get a boost as that was when he was 'famous' as it were.</br></br></br>  <br>People seems to constantly use the term "he'll become Archer" wrongly. I think what people are trying to say most of the time is that Shirou WILL become Heroic Spirit Emiya somehow. which makes more sense</br>  <br>He remembers Illya too.</br>  <br>Ok. So we know he goes to the middle east to escape from the clock tower because muh secreit reality marble. And he cooks there. Is he excelling in cooking? Last time I checked Shirou beat archer in cooking during UBW.</br>  <br>He doesn't so to speak. Whoever Shirou really is died in the fire.</br>  <br>Yeah from now on I'll probably use your wording.</br>  <br>He doesn't really remember who he was even as Shirou, so he wasn't lying that much, he's just a smug fucker.</br>  <br> Ok. So we know he goes to the middle east to escape from the clock tower because muh secreit reality marble <br><br>What? No. In fact he's staying in London for the next three years, it's just he's not going to become an official part of the Association. They don't have any beef with him. The desert scene was symbolism to show his determination and how he will go farther than Archer.<br><br>Alternatively it really is a future version of him and he's just wandering around the desert looking for people to beat up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He always said that UBW shirou wasn't going to be Archer.</br>  <br><br><br><br>failing in the hardest way possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's always only said that F/sn Shirou doesn't become Archer</br>  <br> I'm not content with the current state of my life </br>  <br>at the point he sees Illya I think he remember everything already. Also how can you froget about such a cute little big sister?</br>  <br>Right, so Fate, UBW, and HF Shirou don't become him.<br><br>Are you saying the anime version could?</br></br></br>  Rin's only charm is her morning mood. And compared to Luvia Rin is just a twin tailed old hag.  <br><br>Old Men<br><br>Money</br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't understand why Achilles isn't A++ in agility. They literally call him the fastest Servant there is with his noble phantasms.</br>  <br>I doubt any version of UBW can turn him into EMIYA. No matter how minor or big the change is, it's still UBW.<br><br>It all leads to the same thing.<br><br>Shirou vs Archer<br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>DEEN fate Shirou is archer. That would explain why he's such a failure</br>  <br>Her real charm is<br> her anus <br>And the real reason she goes full dere years later.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin just ends up being Maiah mage edition.</br>  <br>Nah, they're gonna have a happy ending.</br>  <br><br><br><br>The paralel is just that both of them are salty because they are being delayed of their goal of becoming a seigi no mikata</br></br></br></br>  <br>And where is Rin?</br>  <br>dead</br>  <br>kidnapped by desert pirates.</br>  <br>She says outright she won't be following him constantly, so probably back at their house.</br>  <br>Killing Sakura and the Greater Grail with Waver</br>  <br>Who would've won between Deermud and Sasaki?</br>  <br><br>Why would she kill her own sister? It's not like HF, with the shadow as an imminent danger?</br></br>  <br>Sasaki if it in the temple. Deermud spears can't do shit against him since he's just a swordsman.</br>  <br>Sasaki he literally very dangerous up close.</br>  <br>Deermud can just poke him to death the Jap doesn't even have armor.</br>  Out of curiosity, does anyone have an image of Shirou at Sabers grave?  So if Illya is just a cup what makes it so that she can't resurrect if she gets enough mana?<br><br>pic unrelated</br></br>  <br>That's not how Sorcery works you dumbass. You'd have to invoke the third Sorcery, Heaven's Feel, in order to do something like that. You can't just power through it.</br>  <br>Well, in UBW the greater grail is still around</br>  <br>Luvia won that fight though</br>  In F/Z what was assassins NP?  <br>Sasaki is ridiculous in 1v1 melee combat through his combo of skills, geography and temple buffs, and TG. Cu gave no fucks about fighting full power Archer and Saber at the same time so long as he was on the defensive, but was nervous about taking on Sasaki 1v1. He's that good at dueling. The only way to beat him is either raw power, or sticking to ranged combat. Saber was also able to hax through him because Instinct is OP, without it she would have been killed in their first battle.<br><br>tl;dr Deermud would get rolled.</br></br></br>  <br>Same one in HF right?</br>  <br>I havent gotten into Fate, just watched F/Z and F/SN for enjoyment sake. didn't understand why assassin had alot of bodies, just assumed they were mana coppies or illusions of some sort</br>  <br>It was Zabaniya: Delusional Illusion which was the ability to give all of it's multiple personalities their own separate bodies.</br>  <br>If only Caster bothered buffing the fucker, although she probably would if Berserker came for a visit.</br>  <br>Can Ilya save her from the curse of Emiya?</br>  <br>Why does Ufotable think the human face is a trapezoid?</br>  <br>They really didn't explain it all that well in the animation or VN. Honestly its a question for LN and material notes fags alike. <br><br>Who is Miyu? Is she really Shirou's long lost little sister?</br></br></br>  <br> Miyu <br>You'll know when she gets Angry</br></br>  <br>If you look closely, you can see that the distance between Saber's chin and the tip of her nose has increased between the HGWs</br>  <br><br>We'll know for sure next month. My money's on her being the sister who died in the fire in normal F/SN.</br></br>  <br><br>She's angra mainyu incarnation</br></br>  <br>For some reason I thought the fire still happened a long with everything else in F/Z. Why is she homeless if Shirou is with Illya and friends? Why are all the Eizenberns dead?<br><br> Miyu <br> You'll know when she gets Angry <br>That is funny anon. Your a funny guy. Goddam that was good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who is Miyu? <br>In Prisma Illya, she is  the Lesser Grail (like Ilya and Irisveil) of an alternate universe's Holy Grail War. Unlike Ilya and Iri, she isn't a homunculus, but was naturally born with the prana capacity of a Lesser Grail (this prana capacity is what makes her and Ilya most suitable for the Kaleidosticks). She was somehow sent to Ilya's universe, along with the Class Cards, by Miyu's brother who sent her away to protect her from the Ainsworths (their universe's much more competent and active equivalent of the Einzberns). After some heavy foreshadowing in 2wei, we find out in 3rei that Miyu's brother is in fact an alternate Emiya Shirou. <br> Is she really Shirou's long lost little sister? <br> Everything indicates she really is Shirou's little sister by blood. We don't really know the details since Miyu's world is very different from the F/SN-esque world of Prisma Illya (it's closer to how Earth was described in Fate/Extra, and will eventually become something like the world of Notes), but the next chapter is actually supposed to be about their backstory. <br>As far as other continuities, I believe Shirou only ever mentions remembering his mother's face in F/SN, nothing about the rest of his family (if he had anyone else at all). It's not impossible that he had a baby sister who died in the fire, but there's nothing suggesting he did either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought he mentioned walking where his house used to be and mentioned that he'd had a baby sister somewhere in the VN.</br></br>  <br>The fire never happened in Prisma; Kiritsugu and Irisveil aborted the Fourth (First, in Prisma's continuity) Holy Grail War long before it started to protect Ilya. Though, the Greater Grail still exists.<br> Why is she homeless if Shirou is with Illya and friends? <br>She's  from an alternate universe , which is somewhat foreshadowed when they mention things like  Luvia forging identity records for her .<br> Why are all the Eizenberns dead? <br>It's very strongly implied that Kerry and Irisveil flat-out killed them all. Which leaves questions like "why do Sella and Liz still even exist" in the air, but you can chalk stuff like that up to alternate timeline shenanigans, just like everyone except Ilya being their F/SN age while Ilya is actually only as old as she looks.<br><br><br>I'm almost certain he doesn't mention a sister.<br>Do you remember if that scene was from Fate route or Heaven's Feel?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Which leaves questions like "why do Sella and Liz still even exist" in the air <br>Go read F/HA. Great stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>It was either Fate or UBW. I remember very clearly he mentioned a sister. Maybe someone can clarfy either way.</br></br>  <br>EAT<br>SLEEP<br>PLEASE OLD MEN FOR MONEY<br>REPEAT</br></br></br></br>   just found out various fate franchises are on manga that I didn't know about previously     <br>I know what they are, the issue is that in F/SN they're only two years old and were created specifically to facilitate Ilya's role as a Master.<br>Obviously the circumstances of their creation must have been different in Prisma, but it's not such a major issue, there's no reason they couldn't have just been created earlier.</br></br>  <br>Rider is can run faster.<br><br>Lancer isn't actually as fast as the real GOTTA GO FAST servant's top speed, hes just got fucking amazing acceleration and reaches his top speed damn near instantly.</br></br></br>  <br>You're blowing my mind here man. So your questioning why they were made in the first place? Illya was supposed to be a supreme master/cup combo before Kiritsugu and Irisviel killed all the Einzberns off. And I'm pretty sure Liz supports illya in some magical way so that is the reason why she exists. What if they find out the truth?</br>  <br><br>He's also not the same Emiya as the one from Stay Night.</br></br>  <br>MOTHERFUCKER SUPLEX A TRAIN</br>  <br> Cu gave no fucks about fighting full power Archer and Saber at the same time so long as he was on the defensive, but was nervous about taking on Sasaki 1v1. <br><br>What when was this</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the gif shows absolutely nothing even remotely similar.</br></br>  <br>He didn't approach the temple to scout out caster.</br>  <br>Could be for a number of reasons (he got too caught up in Archer/Saber or Kotomine already pre-scouted them). He didn't scout out Rider nor Herc either. That's an extrapolation at best.</br>  <br>You'd think Kirei would have just okay'd him to throw a javalin and dip, not like he could dodge it or had anywhere to go oherwise.</br>  <br> He didn't approach the temple to scout out caster. <br>But that's exactly what he's doing before  he gets wrecked by the Shadow  in Heaven's Feel</br></br>  <br>He said as much just prior to the church fight in UBW. Episode 16 if I recall is the anime episode if you wanna quickly check.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this all the Pottery?<br><br>That can't be all the Pottery.<br><br>Is there more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 16 had the church where the three-way happened in Fate.</br>  <br> Fate adaption confirmed? </br>  <br>You mean where Sakura tore Kriei a new one?</br>  <br> this prana capacity is what makes her and Ilya most suitable for the Kaleidosticks <br>What's that supposed to mean? You don't need an excessive amount of prana, since Kaleidosticks provide you with it.</br></br>  <br>Don't they provide you with an infinite amount?<br><br>How is it even possible to lose?</br></br></br>    How is there not a comparison with Berserker's fight against Gil and Shirou vs Gil?  <br>Because Bazett and Dariuses skill sets are good against mages and card-Servants are still Servants?</br>   <br>Except Rin didn't join in on the fun.</br>  <br>His burst speed is higher than Rider's.<br>He's called "the fastest heroic spirit" multiple times in the VN.<br>Apocrypha retconned that with Achilles</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's a spoilsport.</br>    Is Shirou getting cucked while doing hero things in the Middle East?  <br>I demand more Pottery/Parallels.</br>  <br>Rin literaly says that she'll come with him</br>  <br>No, Rin lusts only for The Shirou.</br>  <br>But he was alone in the desert?</br>  <br>Why is Rin getting mad at the fact that she won the Shirou and gets to kiss him?</br>  <br>Rin walking towards Shirou at the end of ep24<br>Shirou walking towards Rin in the ED.</br></br>  <br>That spinning around in Zero was kinda cool the first time i saw it. But now that i see it again it looks like they were bullying Kirei.</br>  <br><br>She hates that personality. A such a woman is dangerous for Shirou.</br></br>  <br>That was symbolism you fucking imbecile</br>  <br>Because that's future Dere Rin talking to her younger self and teasing her.</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br><br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head.

It's Rin we are on about.</br></br>  <br>That bottom pic is lewder than the top one.</br>  <br>I wonder how Sakura would react to talking to Future Rin.</br>  <br>There's also the question of why Shirou is still adopted by Kerry and Iri. Why Taiga is still an english teacher with a crush on Kerry, Why Sakura is a Matou when both of Rin's parents are still alive, Why Caren and Kotomine both exist, Why Bazett still has Lancer's earrings and why Shirou has the hero complex still. It's just a fanfic that made money by selling loli ass.</br>  <br> We don't know yet <br> implying Waver won't seduce her in time when he checks on how Rin and Luvia are doing <br> implying we know if Rin's parents are alive <br><br>Was Caren confirmed to be from the Miyuverse?<br><br>Isn't Bazett a descendant of his?<br><br> implying Shirou will ever stop being a hero of justice </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That scene needs drilling noises.</br>  <br> Studio WIT reuses drawings for SnK until oblivion <br> Levi Hitler meimei <br> Ufotable reuses absolutely everything, from scenario to le light effects <br> "Pottery" <br>Epic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://data.archive.moe/board/gif/<wbr>image/1435/49/1435492063164.webm</wbr></br>  <br>Nigger you blind?

Do they mean a CG or do they mean a magic using hero of justice?  <br>Unhappy sad ending Magic using Hero of Justice.</br>  <br>Here is a parrelel and pottery within itself. Literally the same model being flung over and over again across the gap in the door.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> white hair <br> desert <br>Yeah rewatch the episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, to become "Archer" he must make a pack with Alaya.</br>  Hes going to need a lot of bones for all those swords. Tohsaka Rin's anus is a nightmare.  <br>The former, he becomes Archer 2.0 and surpasses Archer that was kinda the point of the route. But people will ignore that to shitpost.</br>  <br>How are Saber's and Sakura's anus?</br>    <br>That's Archer.</br>  <br>That's Archer.<br><br>This is Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>:^) Nice bait, I got caught.</br>  <br>We never saw Saber's anus. Sakura "honey pot" Matou however.</br>  <br>This is archer. That is Shirou.</br>  For someone with an unrealistically strong case of survivor's guilt, Shirou never thinks of his birth family or any other people who died in the fire. He's upset over him surviving the fire but he never connects it to the victims in his speeches and monologues  WHERE THE FUCK IS THE FATE ROUTE UFOTABLE<br>PLEASE</br>    <br>After the Tsukihime anime adaptation.</br>  <br>So Archer remembering is a pure retcon right?</br>  <br> He's upset over him surviving the fire <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br>What if UBW Shirou became a Heroic Spirit without the contract?<br><br>Would it just be a different form of EMIYA?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She has seen that maneater personality because Shirou is weak to straight affection with seductive tones. She has seen her sister employ it.<br><br>It's why she starts the conversation asking if it's Sakura playing a prank. You notice how many scenes Sakura just sweeps him off his feet, like the one where she has her kouhai take a couple self while they are out shopping.<br><br>Rin knows such a woman bags the Shirou easily when she goes all out. It's why Nasu says Sakura has the highest seduction quotient of the three heroines, and will "ruin" her man with her charms.<br><br>Rin knows. It just took her other self longer to get to that point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you want it from UFO? Everyone hated this adaptation, better if another studio does it.</br>  <br>So, in 3-4 years if we're lucky Nasu releases the remake after Dark Souls 3?</br>  <br> Shirou has survivors guilt <br><br>No he wants to become a hero of justice just like his old grand pappy.</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaptation <br><br>Good meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he would be called Heroic Spirit Shirou.</br>  <br>Give it to DEEN</br>  <br>Rewatch the conversation about Kiritsugu he had with Rin or any of his flashbacks to the fire<br>Or, you know,  read the VN </br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaptation <br>No.</br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaption <br> UFO is still doing Heaven's Feel <br> Only one route would be left and it'd make the most money </br></br></br>  <br>Notice the differences in skin and hair.</br>  <br>Nice projecting nigger</br>  <br> everyone <br>Dayum I got that empty feel after finishing this again.<br>And I havent had that in a loong time</br></br></br>  <br>Rin barely has any Tsun to begin with it only comes out when she is shy and getting comfortable with each other fixes that. Episode 25 showed her full dere side.</br>  <br>The only point in the VN when he has survivor guilt is when he finds the children under the church. And it only happens at that moment because he realises who these people are, it's not longstanding.</br>  <br>Well meme'd</br>  <br><br> Fate adaptation <br><br>Not happening</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaption <br><br>Finally. Someone who agrees with me. They fucked Emiya up. And the fight between Shirou with Redman was completely retarded at one point Shirou's feet doesn't even touch the ground and he FLYS over Archers head with broken bones everywhere.

I'd have to go back and reread the scenes.</br>  Nanako is most retarded shit in Tsuki.<br> lmao unicorn <br> mfw ORT is rori </br></br>  Who did it best  <br>Is there a Are you my Master version of this?</br>  <br>I hope that means Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is confirmed</br>  <br>He doesn't wear it because of some stat boost. It's a just a thing that he does, he even mentions in it Hollow Ataraxia, where he runs around without it the whole time, up until the final battle when he meets with Rin again and they hold the bridge together.</br>  <br>Better than Arc literally explaining everything.</br>  <br>I think that's more to do with his NPs than himself.</br>  <br>of course the vita op</br>  <br>UFO TV, shouldn't UBW TV be at the bottom?</br>  <br>I'm biased but I like the original the best still. Probably always will.</br>  <br>Oh, that. Yeah, but you sounded like you were saying he wore it because it made some big difference in battle. <br>Like when people say "Gil only wears his armor when he is serious".</br></br>  <br>The TV one the vita is good but too much hair and too much arm.</br>  <br>Does Bajiquan use open palm strikes?</br>  <br> He doesn't wear it because of some stat boost <br>That's what I said, genius.</br></br>   4 years ago in the final week of the spring season <br> F/Z ends with Shirou promising Kiritsugu he will following his path in his place. <br> Final week of spring season this week at the same time. <br> UBW ends with Shirou following through with that promise <br><br><br>Ufotable will still never top what they did with F/Z though<br> Mother's Day in Japan is the same day as Natalia episode <br> Father's Day in Japan is the same day Kiritsugu betrays he original wish and "Shoots Illya" <br><br>and the very best<br> Gil v. Rider fight airs June 10th in Japan <br> Alexander the Great dies June 10th in real life in Babylon </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But Nero Chaos already exists.</br></br>  reminder ufo has the pottery to the highest degree  <br>the bad pussy wasn't fast enough</br>  <br>Not traditionally, but neither of them are really using it properly anyway and Kirei is just flying (although he did use a stepping manuever from baijiquan)</br>  <br>Correctly adapting is not pottery.</br>  <br>Th redundant explanation in every route really was one of the big problems with Tsukihime. It felt like almost every route had to grind to a halt at some point to have the heroine handhold you through the nasuverse; something that really should've happened int he prologue but obviously couldn't because there was just too much exposition to dump.<br><br>It'll be nice having a proper kotomine, though. All TM heroines tend to homogenize into one indistinguishable nasu-personality when they explain things, so having that duty relieved from them will let them spend more time being their own character and less time being a mouthpiece for DnD worldbuilding.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and I repeated that. You made it sound like I think that he wears it for stat boost -"like when people say gil only wears his armor when he is serious"- which I don't.</br>  <br>B R A V O<br>B<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VN is Voiced <br> Nero Chaos is Jouji Nakata like in Melty Blood </br></br>  <br><br>I don't like how they tried to shoehorn that into the UBW route. The allusions to Archer's path and Arturia's path were there but not overstated.</br></br>  I have no idea what pottery means and I've used it at least 20 times in this thread.  <br>And who'll be in charge of explaining stuff about demons and demonhunters then?</br>  <br>Hisui as always, or Shiki meets Kiri Nanaya in his dreams while going insane or something.</br>  <br>Ciel-sensei</br>  <br>Assuming this new 'teacher' is from the church, she'll probably shoulder part of the explanation. The rest'll probably be done through a dream scene like all of Shiki's character development.</br>    <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br> Hayate censor <br>kek.</br></br>  <br>It's a funny way of saying poetry.</br>  <br>"Great".<br><br><br>Yeah but the Church doesn't give a flying fuck about these guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best Master-Servant duo.<br>I'd even say best last stand, but all of them were based.</br></br>  <br>The contrivance will be something like "the church is observing Ciel/Arc/Roa/SHIKI to confirm that they pose no threat and new teacher is the overseer" or somesuch. They'll make contact with Shiki once he becomes involved and begin explaining things left and right to move the story along.<br><br>On the other hand, it could be someone from the magus association keeping an eye on Shiki himself -perhaps even an Aoko tie-in since she's so damn popular now. It's less likely but would contrive a better reason for them to involve themselves in Shiki.</br></br></br>  <br> Nose <br>This again?</br></br>  <br> Not wanting redhead tomboy </br>  <br>Or it's a Taiga</br>  <br>I want this to be true</br>  <br> someone from the magus association keeping an eye on Shiki himself <br>That would mean they know about his MEoDP. Considering Aoko would more than likely be worried it makes sense she'd send someone she knows to look out for him, potentially protect him if he ever meets Touko.</br></br>  <br> Wanting Arihiko to be turned into a dirty slut <br>Please leave, take his sister or something.</br></br>  <br> potentially protect him if he ever meets Touko. <br>It's not like Touko would ever do anything to Shiki just because he's wearing the glasses she made. As long as he doesn't say the Dirty R-word, he should be safe.</br></br>  Is Hollow Ataraxia worth playing?  <br>Takeuchi's and ufo's TV are showing warmth in her smile.<br><br>The third picture... Did she fractured her leg?</br></br></br>  <br>It's great</br>  <br> It's not like Touko would ever do anything to Shiki just because he's wearing the glasses she made <br>It's not just the glasses she made, it's the Glasses Aoko stole from her and reinforced with True Magic. She'd probably steal his eyes if she finds out he has MEoDP.</br></br>  <br> She'd probably steal his eyes if she finds out he has MEoDP. <br>Like she did to Ryougi?</br></br>  <br> Gilgamesh: King of Children </br>  <br>Poor Lancer.<br>Those golden rods are hilarious though.</br></br>  <br>Touko found Ryougi first, which is why she didn't do anything to Ryougi if she worked for her.<br>Aoko found Shiki first, stole her glasses and gave it to him. She'd want to do something to one up her sister or piss her off.</br></br>  <br><br> Lancer finds a quiet place to kill time <br> Gilgabitch and EMIYAcunt appear <br><br>Fuck this game</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>drills</br>  <br><br>Forgot poc in </br></br>  <br>How is the voice transfer coming along?</br>  <br> She'd want to do something to one up her sister or piss her off. <br>So she will fuck him?</br></br>  <br>Touko x Shiki doujins fucking when?</br>  <br> She'd want to do something to one up her sister or piss her off. <br>Which would probably mean making a better pair of glasses and feeding him stories about what an awful person Aoko is.<br><br>And, y'know, teaching him to use his eyes properly without destroying himself.</br></br></br></br>    Why didn't we get the assfuck scene?  <br>Why not have Touko X Shiki X Mikiya?</br>  <br>I think infodump in Tsukihime isn't really the problem. <br>It's lacking of CGs in those explanations and  in final fight </br></br>  <br>Did Aoko do a decent job of being a teacher?</br>  <br>W-which Shiki?</br>    <br>The manga fixed the final fight, didn't it?</br>  <br> Which would probably mean making a better pair of glasses <br>I doubt you can make a better pair of glasses when the one you have is strengthened by True Magic.<br> y'know, teaching him to use his eyes properly without destroying himself <br> Touko in any way helping Aoko's property <br>Also that's kinda impossible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously the vn is different.

I don't recall ufo saying anything about adapting anything beyond Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br>  <br>Do they talk about knives or killing things?</br>  <br>It would be an all-out war<br><br> Ryougi's eyes work on Aoko's true magic <br> Tohno's eyes work on Touko's puppets <br>It would be like something out of a grail war, only with significantly stronger magi and no NP beamspam.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "So uh yeah... How is the Ryougi family been doing? Still killing those demons?" <br> "Nanaya please, we are actually better at other things than killing" </br></br>  <br>christ.</br>  <br>They had years to backpedal on that design. Arc is ruined forever.</br>  <br>They said H/A would be done if UBW breaks 100k if I remember right.<br><br>Tsukihime is up in the air till the remake is out.</br></br></br>    <br> Touko sends Aoko a picture with her fucking Shiki <br> Aoko storms down to Misaki and half the town gets destroyed </br></br>  <br><br>From normal people to ayy lmao</br></br>  <br>Don't listen to them, the whole " f/sn &gt; f/z" thing is just an ironic maymay. <br><br>I mean, you have to be some kind of bathrobe and sandal wearing autist to actually believe a poorly written hentaigame is better than anything.</br></br></br>  <br> And how's your family doing? </br>  <br> Friendly thighs at top-right corner </br>  <br>You shouldn't believe everything say, they'll say anything to increase the sales.</br>  <br>That reminds me, it seems that this girl is Mimi who becomes Illya's and Chloe's friend in Prisma Illya.

UCHIKUDAKEEEEEE comes back for the credits roll   <br>SEASON THREE FUCKING WHEN?<br><br>I SWEAR I NEED MORE, DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE TELL ME THAT RECAP AT THE END WITH OP1 MEANT CLOSURE FOR THE SERIES</br></br></br>  No Yuhata being stoked for you.<br><br>I never asked for this.</br></br>  <br>Anime Lem IX isn't filled with creepy gauna bugs and creatures but instead a lot of gauna hairy balls. But if Polygon only has this much money to animate balls and comes up with a cool way to exterminate them all in one swoop then I'm fine with that.</br>  <br>Happy Izana is the best Izana, after all those sufferings.</br>  <br>There was that one creepy as fuck motherfucker that chased Izana and the other dude though.</br>  Too bad tsunbot didn't make it this season.<br><br>Although, that might have been a good thing. S3, if there ever was going to be a S3, would be harem shit.</br></br>  Is Season 2 going to be on Netflix? dubbed too?  <br>This fourth of July, yes. You can't have enough of JYB and Sheh.</br>  <br>I don't think there is enough content</br>  <br>Content is not an issue, I can certainly wait a couple of years before a new season, but it's the fact of not knowing if there'll be another season plus the uncertainty that's left by that recap of both seasons at the very end that make me want to kill myself.</br>  <br> I don't think there is enough content <br>Really? If you are being sarcastic to the kid, it's difficult to tell.<br><br>I mean, fuckin' really? Not enough content?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is, but the current arc in the manga needs to be finished first.</br>  <br>It's more of Polygon wants to end its 2-years planned anime properly first, then considers future projects later.</br>  <br>They're peeing in this scene right?</br>  <br>Which episode was that scene in?</br>  <br>Pretty sure this is just the catheters going in.<br><br>It's probably not a super comfortable experience.</br></br></br>   Nagate got some of that nice Gauna mouth in him. <br>I'm jealous.</br>  <br>Man, the ass design of the female models is so fucking perfect, literally the best ass ever</br>  <br>Not really true. They got a lot of the harem shit out of the way this season.</br>  <br>Post piss drinking</br>  It's such a good time to be a Captainfag.  <br>Ep 1 or 2 of season 1</br>  I don't fucking care if Izana and Tsugumi fags are dominating these threads, but I FUCKING MISS HOSHIJIRO. All those flashes of her at the final ED continues to remind me how much I like her. She is such sincere person and actually had skills too. I wish Nihei brings her PERSONALITY back as I don't believe she can be alive in anyway. I don't even care if she doesn't win the Tanikazebowl, I just want to see her smile again.<br><br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br>Have you not noticed how goddamn loud the animeonly Hoshijirofags have been lately? They're almost drowning out the Tsumugifags.</br>  <br>Lately is not when I've been around. Almost means they're not the loudest either.</br>  <br> they're not the loudest <br>So? I'm just pointing out that they have a presence like everybody else. They're not some poor oppressed group.</br></br>  don't mind me, just being best girl  So how well does Sidonia do in Japan?  <br>So the battle will still go on. How can the rest of assault fleets achieve anything with all casualties at this point?<br><br>Death to Smoogy would be entertain to watch though.</br></br></br>  <br>Which unfortunately was completely forgotten minutes later. Everyone seems to now assume the planet secured.</br>  Why?  <br>I'm curious about this myself.</br>  <br>We're probably going to see Izana and the rest of the recon fleet show up soon, so they should at least have the numbers to retreat without getting completely BTFO. I'm also betting on Tsumugi dying either protecting Izana or as she and Nagate watch helplessly.</br>  <br>She'll come back.</br>  <br>How many times is she gonna die?</br>  The end is near.  What does this mean?  <br><br><br><br>I guess that kinda answers it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The second Chimera</br></br>  <br><br>Have you read the manga? <br><br>Did you watch the finale in its entirety? It was quite literally staring you in the face.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the ride will end </br>  <br>It's going to have a direct continuation sequel with the more accurate title 'Moe Alien Penis Monster of Sidonia'.</br>  <br> not Toxine's Tiny Sewer Adventure <br><br>0/10 wouldn't read</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I'd prefer 'Tit-Growing Suffering Cyborg Tales' but we can't always have what we want. Nihei is making fucking sure of that.</br>  All smiles here. <br><br><br><br>Oh, right. My bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the maximum possible suffering at this point that ensures all waifufags pull their hair out?</br>  <br>Watching her heart shatter into tiny pieces after she sees Tsumugi, Yuhata and the Captain fucking Nagate at the same time.</br>  <br>Probably homo end with Kunato, but that's letting fujoshis have a completely random win so it's not a good idea.</br>  <br>This. The reaction was bad enough when Tsumugi had a poorly foreshadowed pull ahead.</br>  <br>Funded.</br>  <br>So if izana detatched the head from the body, what was tanikaze sitting in?</br>  What chapter would you guys guess the manga will end on? I think around 90.  <br>All the waifus die. Nagate marries a genderbent clone of himself.</br>  <br>Toxine wins the Nagatebowl.<br><br>She isn't even interested in him so that would piss off EVERYONE.</br></br></br>  <br>100 views of Sidonia.</br>  <br>wait has the manga ended already? shouldn't there be a huge overhead for this?</br>  <br>Completely forgot about.How many sights have we seen so far?</br>  <br>I bet Nihei is dragging this shit just so he can have those 100 sights to compile as a special color booklet later on.</br>  <br>no it hasnt</br>  <br><br>Season 3's an eternal curse.<br><br>From Haruhi to Spice and Wolf then to Horizon etc. etc. all never get season 3. It's like an unwritten rule somewhere to never do season 3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he get gauna aids?</br>  Polygon you better have enough sales so you give us a season 3.  Did I remember correctly but is that smiling Hoshijiro in the MAD/ED actually Tsumugi? I don't think that has been shown in the anime yet? Flag for season 3?  Yep, sexually frustrated.<br><br><br>His cockpit you stupid fucking communist. <br><br><br>Placenta is uninhabitable to STIs. All good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She planted an egg.</br>  <br>He simply came.</br>  <br>No, but he did get a ahegao.</br>  <br> Meanwhile at High School DxD. </br>  <br> his cockpit <br><br>then how was he flying the ship if the cockpit was detached?</br></br></br>  <br>Were they going for a corrupted version of the standard shoujo manga flowers-blooming-lace-frame-sparkly<wbr>-romance-scene thing here?</wbr></br>  <br>And it was mediocre at best. You want to sully the greatness of those series with a mediocre 3rd season?</br>  <br>I like the space flower ebolaids vagina flowers</br>  <br>Would you stop being a retard already?</br>  <br>This fucking moron</br>  <br>Why wont Kouichi submit his male urges on her?</br>  <br>I blame pilot episode special numbers<br><br>usually when a TV show, particularly cartoons gets its air, they get 26 pilot episodes or some where around 26. Spice and wolf had 25 I believe, 12 in S1, 13 in S2</br></br></br>  <br>Outlaw Star had 26 episodes aswell, and never saw a season 2. The 26th episode ends with "Tune in next time...!" but there never was one</br>  <br>Tsuruuchi aside, females are the only ones to have a strong libido in sidonia.</br>  <br>It's not being called a cockpit for no reason.</br>  <br> Oh fuck my robot is infected! <br> quick detach the cockpit! <br> detach the cockpit <br> how do I fly ship if cockpit is not attached? </br></br></br></br>  <br> High School DxD <br> Greatness <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll spell it out for you. The cockpit isn't in the head.<br><br><br>I was jesting, f-for real!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didnt unless you have shit standards.</br>  <br> tune in next time! <br> there never was a next time <br>;_;<br><br> 1999 was 15 years ago </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, if you are spending all of your time fighting placenta, you might not want to make very meaningful relationships.<br><br>Look what happened to Akai</br></br></br>  <br> The cockpit was detached <br>Come on, guardians are the same basic shape as every giant robot ever.</br></br>  <br>Then if tanikaze is sitting in the cockpit<br><br>and they told him to detach the cockpit to stop the guana from infectin him further<br><br>and he detached the cockpit<br><br>and the head flies off the body<br><br>but the head is not the cockpit<br><br>how does detaching the head stop the guana from infecting the body?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What Izana detached was the head, not the cockpit. The gauna was finding its way in via the damaged head.</br>  <br>then why even have a head on the body?</br>  <br> detach the cockpit <br><br>Pretty sure they didn't say that.</br></br></br>  <br>The head is the hyggs cannon.</br>  <br><br>jesus christ how retarded can you be</br></br>  <br>Cause it looks cool and you can't see out of your chest.</br>  <br><br>They never say detach the cockpit. They say to close the head airlock or something. The Gauna tentacles are getting in through the head/neck area. The cockpit is in the chest region, (which you would know if you had been paying any attention to the show and/or manga). Jettisoning the head and sealing the airlock in the neck area severed the tentacles connecting the placenta in the cockpit from the body of Benisuzume, <br><br>Fuck anon you are retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>when was the last time that nigga used that higgs cannon before he got the gun?</br>  <br>Don't even think of it as a head. Think of it as a cannon. It serves practical mechanical functions for the gardes. It's not a piece of eye candy.</br>  <br>They use it constantly. It helps eat through placenta, as well as being easier to keep on target than the railgun.</br>  <br>Do you even watch the show? Stop acting retarded.</br>  <br><br><br>why is the cockpit in the body and not the head? put the cockpit in the head then the cannon in the body and it'd be better and like stuff</br></br></br>  <br>the bleach is above the dryer</br>  <br>Cut the head and the placenta is cut from the main body.</br>  <br> why is the cockpit in the body and not the cock? it'd make way more sense if it was in the cock because its a cockpit </br>  <br>Why would they put the cockpit in the head?</br>  <br> cockpit in a small, outer part instead of a bulky center part <br> better </br></br>  <br>so he can see out the top of the body so he can turn the head and see everything, like instead of being stuck looking out the chest and not being able to just rotate a bit to look behind you<br><br> wah what was that? <br> turn head around <br> wah what was that? <br> turn entire body around to look at it </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is the pilot in the cockpit? put the pilot in Sidonia and turn the robot into a big gun and it'd be better and like stuff </br>  <br>I'm dying of laughing here.</br>  <br>why not just pilot the guard from the ship like a remote drone so sidonia can stop losing pilots to stupid shit like putting the cockpit in the body</br>  <br>The camera's connected to he head, not the cockpit.</br>  <br>can mods ban people for being complete dumbasses?</br>  <br> guard </br>  <br> Why even have people? why not just make everyone a robot and give them guns and it'd be like better and stuff </br>  <br>I don't know what's he's been smoking, but I want some.</br>  You guys are being rused hard.  <br>then how does he see out of the cockpit when they detached the head? how does he pick up tsumogi and fly back to the ship without the camera on the head?</br>  <br> woah anon, you know drugs are bad for you </br>  <br><br>Holy shit anon. You are either the most hilarious troll in the history of Sidonia threads or the least observant moron in the history of Sidonia threads. <br><br>No one is looking out some little hole in the chest or something. It's all screens and cameras and VR. The pilots have a near 360 degree view from inside the cockpit but it's all projected images from sensors and whatnot.<br><br>I'm about to piss my pants laughing at you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guardians only have one camera </br>  <br>Ruse or not, I like to believe people in this day and age can still be genuinely retarded. It's more fun to live your life without doubting anything you see.</br>  <br> making excuses for bad anime design <br><br>this is why shit like this doesn't work<br><br> wow the head is important <br> dump the head <br> the camera was in that <br> I can still see fine <br> lemme pick up this bubblegum girl and bring her back to the ship <br> without a head <br> but I can still magically see </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Izanafags are being rused hard.</br>  <br>SZS managed it.<br><br> Ending OVA never  ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather Izana get fucked hard.</br>  Also where does sidonia get its gravity if its in orbit around the planet and the total force upon the people in the sidonia is zero because the gravity is counter acted by the centripetal force  <br>leave</br>  <br>They buy it at space-Walmart.</br>  How do people photosynthesize with artifical light from fluorescent light? thats not how photosynthesize works  <br>Think about it this way. There are cameras in the head. He can see through the point of view of the head of the frame while being protected in by the toughness of the body. <br><br>So he gets the benefits of being in safest part of the frame while being able to view his surroundings intuitively from head cameras.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the future, they can probably recreate sunlight, they ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>How do people not feel the massive recoil of firing a space gun out of the sidonia when it fired that big cylindrical can at a guana?</br>  <br>How do people photosynthesize without chloroplats? the people aren't green.</br>  <br>Big space pillows.</br>  Where do the people of sidonia make sugar from photosynthesizing if they don't breath in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen (which is the chemical mechanism for photosynthesizing)<br><br>excessive oxygen makes photosynthesis impossible without carbon dioxide and glucose can't be made without carbon dioxide</br></br>  <br>Space plant people don't have to be green.<br><br>They're using special space light.</br></br></br>  <br> What are backup cameras <br> What are redundant systems </br></br>  <br>Space photosynthesis.</br>  <br>Space-Walmart also sells shock-dampeners, which work to some extent.<br><br><br>It's the future, they integrated chloloplats without the need for green.<br><br><br>It's the future, they invented super photosynthesis which works different altogether.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think these are good questions  but read the manga right?   Nagate bang Samari when?  <br>Next tuesday.</br>  So if I haven't read the manga can i hop in on the chapter where the anime left off and be able to continue with the story or should I read from the beginning?  <br> Space plant people don't have to be green. <br>chloroplasts are green because that frequency of light absorbs light best so that the plant can better utilize proper light frequencies that help the acceleration of glucose production.<br><br>ergo, sidonia people can do photosynthesis without carbon dioxide, without proper light sources and without being green to absorb light properly<br><br>so they've got a quadruple double edged sword whamy and they're doing the worst and least efficient photosynthesis ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when season 3 happenes</br>  <br>It's better to start from chapter one. They've changed a few things around.</br>  <br> chloroplasts are green because that frequency of light absorbs light best <br>I thought they're green because that's the frequency that they don't absorb so it gets reflected (hence why you can see it)</br></br>  <br>Same as every other time this is asked, start from the start.</br>  <br>They did</br>  <br>All right thanks<br><br><br>I'm just hoping one time I won't have to<br>I'm still fucking reading TG, shit moves so slow once you know the gist of every arc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and if their super shitty photosynthesis reaction is so stupidly inefficient then what purpose does the pancreas even serve if the sugar this shitty process is producing is being insulinated to the cells through that<br><br>its like everyone on board has proven hypoglycemia with type 2 diabetes, malnutrition and hypertension all the while having Gender Identity Disorder and Autism<br><br><br>Yes because Green color frequency is bad for glucose production and less efficient than other color spectra. Ergo any other color but green is ok.<br><br>All of them being white on board literally reflects all the colors of light and makes photosynthesis really really impossible at that point. Since white is a conjunction of all the colors and reflects them as such</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Sidonia you can play 'spot the differences' though. And there's a few of em.</br>  <br>Don't watch this show, it has really really bad thermodynamic 4th wall breaking physics shit<br><br><br> its like everyone on board has proven hypoglycemia with type 2 diabetes, malnutrition and hypertension all the while having Gender Identity Disorder and Autism <br>Sidonia is literally a Tumblr Seed ship.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sidonia is literally a Tumblr Seed ship. <br>this is what Nihei intended</br></br>  <br>I watched both fucking seasons as they aired and liked them thank you very much..</br>  <br>That would make it anime of the century. Kunato is clearly best boy and hottest Sidonia.</br>  <br>That's a funny way to spell Seii.</br>  <br> Kunato is clearly best boy and hottest Sidonia. <br>no that's brochiai and Sei</br></br>  <br>I think they captured the feel of the scene quite nicely. It was not ever intended to be as romantic as you seem to have perceived it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Lets Recap<br><br>The guards have a cockpit, but the cockpit is in the head, not really its just a camera, the camera is in the head and detaching the head lets you still see through the cockpit which is in the chest now. The cockpit is in the chest and he can still see out like he normally would.<br><br>There is special gravity bought from space-walmart. The sidonia absorbs massive recoil through space pillows. People on sidonia are the epitome of Tumblr. People on sidonia have the worst chemical set up for photosynthesis by using fluorescent light, no carbon dioxide, no green layer absorbing materials and everyone has hypoglycemia because of it. Their skin is white which reflects any light energy they could get for photosynthesis, they breath oxygen which stifles glucose production, they exhale carbon dioxide which is where they should get their fuel source from to make glucose. Also they have gender identity disorder and autism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Guana are made of Women's Uterus linings (placenta)<br><br>And the people on the ship actively practice eugenics</br></br></br>  <br>And the perceived economic system of sidonia is totalitarian communism</br>  <br><br> Sei <br>He doesn't have Kunato's luscious hair.<br><br> Brochiai <br>Body deformation is gross but Koyasu makes it better, I'll give you that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just so the message get's across. begin from ch 1</br>  <br> Kunato Development <br> part of communism <br>it's obviously space fascism</br></br></br>  <br>Brochiai is canonically the best male sidonia</br>  <br>No one pays for it, its just developed and instantly deployed</br>  <br>seems about right</br>  <br>fascism is the merging of state and business. Are you surprised that they work so efficiently at deploying new tech?</br>  Tanikaze, pilot among pilots.  <br>Let's not forget that Izana is officially the most fuckable thing in Sidonia, all genders want a piece of her.</br>  <br> Completely fucked <br> Puts down anchor and goes for a last stand <br> Completely annihilates hundreds of gauna <br>Holy shit, how can he be this good of a pilot. Why not just give him the most advanced shit and let him solo everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's literally what they end up doing</br></br>  <br>That's exactly what they do. Izana to an extent as well, since in the manga she's actually a really good pilot.</br>  <br>So why did the Captain send the ace pilot, the only hope of they ever defeating the gauna, to rescue some rookies which were obviously mean to be cannon fodders anyway?</br>  <br>It was better explained in the manga. Tsumugi was probably going to hulk out if Izana was killed, and you don't keep an ace pilot on side by ordering him to not go save his best and pretty much only friend.</br>  Am I the only tard that cheered all the way from Hayakaze's orbital bombardment till the end song?<br>This anime is a great work of art with cinematographies never seeing in other animes.<br><br>I don't even care its CG anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Tanikaze does whatever the fuck he wants because he's the ace pilot, that's why</br></br>  <br>So why was Izana picked for the mission anyway?</br>  <br>She might have judged that the fleet was in more dire need of strong aid. Since Sidonia is still around, she judged correctly.</br>  <br>Because Tsumugi and Tanikaze are personally invested in one of the Garde's pilots and Kunato helps usher on Kobayashi</br>  <br>Her implants gave her both reconnaissance and combat utility far above the abilities of an average pilot. She demonstrates that regularly.</br>  <br>Probably the next name on the list. She ends up being the only reason anybody survived, but that's a different matter.</br>  <br>Yet she was not the first pick.</br>  <br>Her new mechanical additions allow for an elevated sensory experience that makes it easier to track Gauna. Atleast, something like that</br>  <br>It was different in the manga. The show made a blunder</br>  <br>Presumably ms crazy lady was not completely incompetent</br>  <br>Fuckface-chan had no sense of duty.</br>  <br>Because she has a soft spot a mile wide for Nagate, and her desire to keep him happy is bordering on a complex.<br><br>There are lots of good reasons he was sent on that mission that anons have already posted, but heres one more.<br><br>Not allowing Nagate to go save his friend would have resulted in a huge loss of Nagate's favour for the Captain.<br><br>And weather its for practical reasons or emotional ones, the Captain needs Nagate's support and approval.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I thought her tits grew naturally.</br>  <br> hot </br>  I'm going to bestow the Strangest Harem Award on this show.  <br>Someone else that shares my fetish</br>  That feeling when Benisuzume is just replicating what her human genesis wanted.<br><br>Hoshijiro wanted the Tanikaze, bad.

Does she have Hoshijiro's memories and emotions? Is Hoshijiro even technically dead, or is her mind in some sort of Gauna-limbo gestalt consciousness thing?<br><br>Is there even material for a S3 to be made? Does anything about the Gauna get explained in the manga from where the anime has left off?<br><br>Why is being an Izanafag such suffering?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a dakimakura cover.</br>  <br>We can't say for sure why she's sad. Her expression was a bit more ambiguous in the manga, though it still looked sad to me. The placenta has copied Hoshijiro's brain, so the Gauna was likely at least influenced by Hoshijiro's memories or desires. But since her brain was replicated, she might possibly at some point regain full consciousness as "Hoshijiro". Both placenta clones did definitely become closer to her personality.<br><br> Why is being an Izanafag such suffering? <br> implying it's even close to the suffering of being a Hoshijirofag </br></br></br></br>  <br>She's dead, Jim.</br>  <br> Why is being an Izanafag such suffering? <br>Because the anime director cranked it up even further.</br></br>  <br> he wouldn't accept his dead waifu's placenta clone </br>  <br>There is enough of material for the third season, and once the manga actually ends, there will be enough for another one.</br>  Meanwhile, on Aposimz.<br><br> When all's said and done, I'd really like something on how things went on the other seed-ships. Like if they developed anti-gauna weaponry from placenta like Ochiai did, or if they use different gardes completely, or if they don't use gardes at all. It actually bothers me that we don't know SHIT about the other 1000 or so seed-ships. </br></br>  <br>Pilot Tanikaze.<br>That is Gauna, not your waifu.</br></br>  <br><br> forgot my pic </br></br>  <br><br>no john, you are the gauna</br></br>  <br><br>I like to believe that somewhere there's a seed ship where everything went down like the seed ships in Macross 7</br></br>  I like how the captain was breathing heavily during the baiting, god I want to see her tensed face  <br> Both placenta clones did definitely become closer to her personality. <br> First clone <br> A retard <br> Second clone <br> Tries to strange/kiss Nagate, "Tanikaze-kun", Pretty much stops doing anything after it's disconnected  <br><br>I mean, I do think Hoshijiro didn't have much of a personality, but this is a bit too much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> strange <br>*strangle</br></br>  <br>EnaJiro goes from showing barely any personality, to smiling and wanting to impress Nagate with her dress. BeniJiro's "No..." comes after she's cut off and no matter what, the personality she did show was definitely a result of the copied brain.<br><br>I didn't say any of them completely regained her personality, but they definitely came closer to it throughout the times we see them.</br></br></br>   Flat out tells the Gauna to stop impersonating Hoshijiro <br> still gets concerned about the placenta sample from his cockpit <br><br>C'mon Nagate. You know that's not your waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she did go from from crazy alien bitch strangling him with tentacles to docile alien girl making soft moaning noises while sleeping naked in his arms the whole flight home.</br>   season 1 opening plays at the end of the episode   <br>After that "No..." it was quite obvious that he wasn't entirely sure what to think anymore.</br>  <br>Keep in mind Netflix had a huge role in Sidonia getting a second season in the first place so we can only pray this received just as good of a reception.</br>  <br>I'd grant you the first clone definitely did show signs of gaining some sort of personality, though I don't really remember Hoshijiro ever trying to impress Nagate or even liking short frilly dresses (that's more Izana or Yuhata. Even her kimono was long).<br><br>The "No..." is very much a result of the copied brain, but to call that a personality is reaching, it's just a memory of the time of death. Can't say anything until we see the clone again.</br></br></br>   detatched placenta has never shown the ability to attack humans <br> LITERALLY the first thing that the first Placentajiro did was try to stab anyone who came to the glass with her tentacles <br><br>Ochiai being a lying shit, or Ochiai being a lying shit?</br></br></br>  <br>Generics and training simulator. Remember, he's a clone of Sidonia's previous ace.</br>  <br>A clone of the previous ace WITH the immortality improvements, and about 15 or so years of training in the type 17 simulator.<br><br>Theoretically, he shouldn't be as good as Hiroki was with Hiroki's longer experience, but when he does fuck up, his whole "bounce back from concussion, cardiac arrest, blunt force trauma, etc." card makes up for it.<br><br>By the time he's gotten as much training under his belt as Hiroki had, he should logically be an even better pilot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, true, it's hard to say anything certain in the end. Nothing to do but to wait and see. But I'd still say that BeniJiro should have the potential to regain Hoshijiro's memories and personality completely. Until that plot point hopefully goes somewhere again, that's my head-canon.  ;_; </br>  <br>But, anon, it already has all of Hoshijiro's personality.<br> Which is to say, nothing except wanting Nagate's dick. </br></br>  <br> kind <br> patient <br> understanding <br> strong-willed <br>She might not be the most interesting person, but to say she has no personality is hyperbole.</br></br></br></br></br>   HAHA I have beaten you Benisuzume, I will now tell you what I plan to do! <br> Are you ready? <br> I am sorry, but I must stab your core! <br> I am now going to stab your core! <br> Here it comes! <br> It's nearly the- <br> Oh no, stop! Stop sucking my energy! <br><br>Fucking christ. All you had to do was give her a seconds worth of hesitation where she looks like she can't do it and then have her go in for the kill only to be stabbed by Benisuzume. It's not fucking hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Benisjiro encounters Nagate again <br> corners him or lures him out of the AO <br> infects the fuck out of his body <br> they both become the bane of Sidonia and the colony on the Ninth planet and either get killed or wipe the humanity out <br>This is my ideal edgemaster ending but nothing like that will ever happen.</br></br></br></br>  So whats the betting that Nagate remains a stuttering, submissive bitch boy right up until the end and he'll never act like Hiroki did?  <br> only got dvd quality broadcast copy <br>yeah, I don't think they'll be co-funding s3</br></br>  Is it possible for this to ever be not cool?  Why can't he just put Nagate and Izana together already?<br><br>Enough with the fucking harem shit. Enough with the sexual tension. Nagate needs to take resonsibility and make Izana his woman already. You don't need to save everything for the ending, have them get together now and focus on other things for comedy relief.</br></br>  <br>I feel like it's just the awkward teen stage for him.<br>I feel like after a few more years of military service, losing friends, and just growing up in general, Nagate will end up more like Hiroki.<br><br>It doesn't help that everyone has a soft spot for him and he can pretty much say fuck the rules and the captain will let him.</br></br></br></br>  That Uchikudake, missed that so much.

Every person on Sidonia contributes to that goal, even the guy who sells model kits is contributing to keeping people on the ship sane by providing them with something fun to do. Sure, they're all expendable but at least their lives were part of something bigger than themselves.<br><br>Whats our purpose? Humanity on earth isn't working towards a goal, we're all just chasing money, power and fame. Anyone who IS trying to do something "useful" like doctors or researchers is only prolonging the inevitable decay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still prefer the arm blade tentacle slice from his first engagement.<br> rocket powered giant mecha razor blade clothesline </br></br>  <br> Possibly in a few years. <br>Well IF there is another season, I'd suspect they'll start working on it around the time sidonia reaches ch90. which will give them enough time to plot out and animate everything in time for the ending at ch100. only 25 chapters remaining, 2 years &amp; 1 month left.</br></br>  <br> dvd quality &amp; tv broadcast feed; censored &amp; no ep12 directors cut <br>keep in mind the bluray is out for 37 on deepdiscount</br></br>  <br>Didn't some magazine say it'd end next year?</br>  <br> 2 years and 1 month <br><br>Wellp.<br>Animeonlyfag here. Guess I'm going to start reading the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which Nagate didn't. He told it straight to it's face that it was not Hoshijiro.</br>  <br><br>Don't be fucking retarded, import BDs directly. As many copies as you want.</br></br>  <br><br> netflix original </br></br>  <br>He is currently going down the same path as Hiroki and doing everything he ended up hating and Tsumugi is fueling this ride.</br>  <br>He wasn't very happy when he thought it has just killed Izana.</br>  <br>Perfect way to end S2</br>  <br>I think that is the point of Sidonia, the older generation needs to start putting faith in the new generations that they can handle themselves. And that doesn't mean let the new generation do their thing alone, but that you should be there to guide and help them, not govern them. Saitou probably thought he would become an instructor to the new pilots and not a Hero-unit that the Captain could send out at her will. Even Yure was embracing that idea when she made the third-genders.</br>  <br>I'm sure there's some social standards around 3rd genders turning for you. Even if you don't want a relationship, it seems almost impolite to not bone them.</br>  <br>Izana dying will break Nagate beyond repair even harder than anyone else dying.</br>  <br>Damn I got turned on like crazy from that scene, time to fap.</br>  <br>I still have the rickroll file in addition to the actually subbed first episode. That shit was too good.</br>  <br>I'll look forward to it in the manga.</br>  You will never make Izana cry tears of join.<br><br>Why even commission?</br></br>  <br> tears of join. </br>  <br>Why was she blushing in this scene?</br>  <br>yup</br>   You will never push up Izana's boobs   <br>Including his beloved Tsumugi?</br>  <br>I would not hold my breath for it even if it would be nice to see Nagate being sent into the biggest depression spiral because how him realizing what he actually had and could have. You never miss something until it's gone.</br>  <br>including benis, yes</br>  Did they fuck?  <br>Even if he did thank her for the first time relatively recently, he still really takes her for granted.<br><br>Yep. Izana is the closest thing to family he's had since 'grandpa' died. Tsumugi will be heavy, but Izana would be heavier.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, if you can't figure out why I suggest you reread the chapters that handled Hoshijiro's death.</br>  <br>I think either Izana or Tsumugi dying would equally break Nagate. Izana is the closest friend he has ever had while Tsumugi is the one he loves, romantically or like father-daughter.</br>  <br>Just a lot of dry humping with all the maneuvers Tsugumori has been doing</br>  <br> sidonia isn't at war with itself <br><br>Captain please, not everyone wants to fight gauna like you.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just a small percentage of moaners. They'd be in heaven on earth and they'd still be moaning that the wine is a degree too warm.</br>  <br>But all those people who don't want to fight gauna has been eaten by it already.<br><br>Captain is always right.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up you fucking tree hugger, and take your fucking tsunbot back to your grave</br>  <br> bouncing around in an uncushioned metal box while the pilot's pulling Gs rocketing around everywhere <br>I'm surprised they didn't break their necks the first time Nagate rocketed off after catching them.</br></br>    <br>Those are Toha Industries-grade suits. Most likely whiplash-resistant</br>  <br> he still really takes her for granted <br>Nihei actually gave some insight in this. Izana put's up a brave face not to worry Nagate about her having the augmentations while in reality she cries a lot about it in private. <br>So my speculation for this is that her putting up a brave face sends the message that she is doing ok, which Nagate takes for granted and diverts his attention to the ones in "need" because of his vow to protect everyone on Sidonia. And since Tsumugi is crying a lot and makes scenes she get's the attention.<br><br>I don't even think we have seen Izana break down in front of someone else in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After all this time I still can't quite swallow their apparent romantic relationship. Everything to that point had been pushing the father/daughter angle, including Nihei's constant reminders of how mentally immature Tsumugi is. It'd be like if Asuka was seven and Kaji reciprocated.</br>  <br>I'm surprised they didn't become splatter marks on the garde's hand when nagate caught them.</br>  <br>Nihei asspulled it on twitter that the trunk is installed with inertia deceleration system or some sort.</br>  <br>I don't think he would ever be able to comeback if Izana died. He would be able to comeback from Tsumugi's death. <br>Do the math of who is gone in both scenarios.</br></br>  <br>But he sure looked like he doubted his conviction just before he stabbed the core. That and he's still thinking about BeniJiro when she's taken away.</br>  <br> Implying Nagate doesn't love Izana  <br>Please</br></br>  <br>Not to mention all the hard impacts with the ground. For a show that makes clear the danger accelerating sidonia poses to it's occupants, they aren't exactly strict with that rule. They explain that the frame is built strong enough the survive the impact, but there doesn't appear to be any extra protection for the pilot or passengers against severe impacts. There ought to have been harnesses in the compartment shown in  at the very least.</br>  <br>It can be easily viewed as a puppy love from Tsumugi side while Nagate meant the polar opposite.<br><br>Smoogyfags just can't accept it.</br></br></br>  <br>Something similar to the artificial gravity in Sidonia?<br><br>Sidonian technology miniaturization at it's finest.</br></br></br>  <br> still thinking he's romantically interested in her <br>She's an important friend to him, get used to it.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't say I wouldn't try to fuck Izana if I found myself next to her inside a cramped space with very little hope of surviving.</br></br>  <br>I've always had the feeling that Tsumugi is artificially created by Ochiai.<br><br>And Nagate is simply substituting his blind ideal of who he thought Hoshijiro would be into Tsumugi. He seems very fond of holding on to his very shallow understanding of who Hoshijiro was instead of facing reality and accept she is dead.</br></br></br>   mfw tsuntsun never <br> S3 never </br>  <br>Who said anything about romantic love you dumbass? She is family to him.</br>  I swear to god Nagate better grovel on his knee's for Izana's forgiveness.<br><br>If they just kiss at the end and BAM they're together I'm gonna be pissed. She's always been there for him no matter what but he's put her aside dozens of times. I know he's not used to socialising that much but how fucking thick do you have to be to just accept it when your friend says "yeah no biggie about losing an arm and a leg, these prosthetics are great"?</br></br>  <br>He does, I don't doubt it. He just doesn't love her in the way she wants him to.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind a robo arm with 10 fingers and some other extras</br>  <br>Honestly, I'd accept it after seeing what those prosthetics can do. I'd love to lose a couple limbs and replace them with those.</br>  <br>This is a good point. Nagate really didn't know her all that well. They spent some time at the academy together, the exact same period he'd known Izana for, gone on a date and flown a combat mission where she then died.</br>  <br>It's not as simple as that.<br><br>Losing a limb is extremely traumatic.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, that's not the same thing as being mortally wounded in combat.</br>  <br>He did spend what was it? Two weeks with her in the shuttle. But what we know from that is that they still didn't know that much about each other. He also never bothered to look her up after her death we know next to nothing about who she is related to, what part of Sidonia she lived in and so on.</br>  <br>Well, they were all alone together for eleven days, trying to survive. An experience like that is bound to make people a fair bit closer, at least.</br>  <br>Hoshijiro is still the first girl, and the first girl wins.<br><br>Izana wasn't a girl at the time. She can keep on trying but it will still be very hard to beat the first girl, especially the one that keeps coming back in many forms after death.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you ignoring the time they spent together in that capsule, not knowing whether they'd live or die?<br>I'm an Izanafag and couldn't care less about Hoshijiro but le's try and maintain some intellectual honesty.</br></br>  <br> Nagate really didn't know her all that well. <br>He drank her piss. That's as good as it gets.</br></br>  <br> Shuttle <br>You mean Tsugumori's cockpit, right?<br><br>I feel like you've either missed the point or intentionally dodged it in order to push your stance on shipping.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Tsumugifags thought she was locked into winning, then Based Captain came along with many days. Your harem logic does not apply here.</br>  <br> He also never bothered to look her up after her death <br>First off, Nagate doesn't exactly have a hell of a lot of free time. Besides, we don't know whether he might have looked her up. Could be Nihei just didn't want to focus on that. But who knows.</br></br>  <br> Why is placentajiro sad!? <br>To make the finale more dramatic, really. In the manga the placenta's expression is pretty much blank (if you really want to satiate your Hoshijiro thirst you can say it looked "sad" and get some hope but it really was blank). It also doesn't say Tanikaze's name.<br><br>The placenta probably has some sort of semblance of memory from Hoshijiro, but whether it's capable of actually functioning as a human is a different story entirely. Hoshijiro is dead as far as we know thus far. There's no more development regarding this placenta copy in the manga, you've seen it all in the anime.<br><br> Is there even material for a S3 to be made? <br>Yes, there is enough material for S3 if they want to make it.<br><br> Does anything about the Gauna get explained in the manga from where the anime has left off? <br>Nope.<br><br> Why is being an Izanafag such suffering? <br>Because Izana can't actually act in order to further her own interests.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be honest, I kind of forgot about that. But aside from their deep and meaningful about gauna just wanting to be friends not much happened aside from piss drinking and blushing. My point stands, as far as relationships go that one was extremely immature. It had room to grow of course, but it never made it that far.</br>  <br>Scratch that "first off".</br>  <br> first girl wins <br> first girl is dead <br><br>If Izana doesn't count because she wasn't originally a girl, who's next in line in your order of Succession? Yuhata?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Izana can't actually act in order to further her own interests <br>Which is only the case because of how concerned she is with Nagate's wellbeing. Too fucking nice for her own good</br></br>  <br>If she did, she'd just be a prick. She knows how hard he has it and that he needs her as a friend, not a lover.</br>  <br>Shipping aside, he really owes her a bout of groveling. For all the reasons you listed and plenty of others.</br>  <br> Because Izana can't actually act in order to further her own interests. <br><br>Her interests are:<br><br>1. Nagate<br>2. Nagate<br>3. Nagate<br><br>and she never gets anywhere with him because every time she tries to he fobs her off because he's thick and she gets pissed off at him, which is to be expected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Point is that he never did that after she died, he sat around and sulked in his room while Izana tried to cheer him up and take him out to stuff (plenty of free time there). And as soon as the placenta showed up he started to obsess over it.</br>  <br> Because Izana can't actually act in order to further her own interests. <br><br>You take that back, mother fucker.</br></br></br>  <br> She'd be a prick for pursuing a relationship with the man she loves <br>At absolute worst she'd be human</br></br>  <br>Actually, seems like food is one of her main interests.</br>  <br>Izana, the friendzone that saves humanity.</br>  Shinohayu scans are out.<br><br>Man this girl is such a dumbass, funny though.

Whats so dangerous about Souma's hujiao bing?  So Souma's making steamed buns?  <br>JIBUN WOO</br>  <br>man this looks delicious</br>  <br>I can't cook shit .<br><br>To lazy to learn.</br></br></br>  Spread reminded that Risa Taneda sounds like an angel and I want to hear her do a falsetto again as Erina.  So I just noticed, the flashback is to Souma in his first year of primary school, and he doesn't have the scar. Did we already know he didn't get it until after he was old enough for elementary school?  <br>It's never that hard. I just made a bowl of ice cream</br>  <br>This. What exactly does hujiao bing have that dispels mabo tofu?<br><br>Relief against the spiciness?</br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Why cook when you can have other people do it for you?</br>  So what is rooster planning?<br><br>Sabotage?</br></br>  <br>He has it here. I wonder if there's an important story behind it.</br>  lol  <br><br>a dark chef tried to kill soma but his mom loved him so much it rebounded and killed dark chef leaving a scar on his forehead</br></br>  <br>Probably will have to do with his mom dying or something</br>  <br>Shit, you're right. Back story when?</br>  <br>Good eye. So he got it between his 1st and 4th years of primary school.</br>  Now I'm wondering what else I missed.<br><br>Fuck redrawing, how do people do it?</br></br>  <br> In Italy the children wait until Epiphany, January 6, for their presents. According to tradition, the presents are delivered by a kind ugly witch called Befana on a broomstick. It was said that she was told by the three kings that the baby Jesus was born, she was busy and delayed visiting the baby. <br> She missed the Star lost her way and has been flying around ever since, leaving presents at every house with children in case he is there. She slides down chimneys, and fills stockings and shoes with good things for good children and it is said leaves coal for children who are not so good. <br>Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>Primary 1 Souma is the cutest.

I had no idea cooking would be so fucking badass.

There was just too much of it. <br><br>We're on ch 124 right now, for now the arc has literally been half of the manga's serialization. That's insane.<br><br> Depending on who you ask, many will also blame this on why Erina's screen time and development has been so lackluster. It's hard for her to be involved in the arc when she's relegated to an observer role for the entirety of it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nigger <br>Was there any reason to have that word in your post?</br></br>  <br>Season 2 is going to kill Season 3 in the womb if it's all tournament.</br>  <br>Go back to tumblr</br>  <br>Anon, we are all niggers on 4chan.<br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/ </br></br>  <br>why'd you spoiler that?</br>  <br>Ehh it depends on how they do it<br><br>As long as they space out the battles with stuff like erina and alice's swimathon and only have 1 episode each for the first round battles it should be fine</br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't offend me in anyway it just makes you look like a child.</br></br>  <br> J.C.

With the absence of his mom and that scar I have a feeling that she and Souma met Truck-kun somewhere.</br>  <br>Yes, Shokugeki no Soma is the only WSJ manga that has a color chapter each week by Jump+ staff.<br>But it's not the only WSJ manga that has a color version.

GUNDAMMIT</br>  <br>He means your mother.</br>  <br>I hope this doesn't preclude the manga from doing field trip arcs.</br>  I always thought Erina's attraction to Souma made no sense.<br><br>But after giving it some thought, she's very competitive, and the fact that he made a dish that made her wet her panties shows that she refuses to accept someone who can surpass the expectations of her God's Tongue. She's childish at heart, but she knows deep down Souma's talent is extraordinary, to the point it impresses her, but she'll keep stubbornly denying it and act all oujo-sama towards him because of her superiority complex. <br><br>I can't wait for their eventual shokugeki and when she admits defeat, it will be   delicious  .</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooked the eggs benedict with salmon roe, it was surprisingly good. That one addition makes it taste like an entirely different meal, like a fishy seafood version. I served it to someone who had never tried it or seen the anime beside a plain version, he really liked the roe more.<br><br>I have almost never cooked in my life, youtube gordon ramsay and you can really do some amazing shit. If the hollandaise sauce starts to thicken or chunk, mix in a teaspoon of hot water to fix it.</br></br></br>  <br>Your sauce ruins it. Otherwise it looks pretty good.</br>  <br>So extra saltiness makes eggs benedict taste real good? I've had regular buffet eggs benedict and it was the most impressive meal I had in that one buffet I can't remember where.</br>  <br>Shit looks budget as fuck bro.</br>  <br>What  said. Looks like the eggs were cooked when making the hollandaise sauce.</br>  <br>I thought Yukihira wasn't talented, but just had the drive and tenacity to keep pushing forward and win it all. And that personality complements his inherited cooking style of pulling ideas from any source he can find</br>  Oh hey, the Chanko guy's still around.  <br>And I just finished eating the chaliapan steak, which a friend and I tried tonight. Its deceptively hard, so we didn't exactly nail it. We couldnt find pickled plum sauce and tried with regular plum sauce, it was moderately refreshing rice but didnt have the kick it needed.Our steak also turned out shit and tough because of a poor tenderizing process and forgetting to cut slits in the meat. But now that I have said everyone that has gone wrong, let me be blunt.<br><br>This recipe is fucking AMAZING.<br><br>The anime reactions are 100% accurate with literally no exaggeration, we were fucking shoveling these onions down and the dish just kept begging us to eat faster and faster. I just ate literally the best onions in my entire life. If you can nail the plum sauce rice, and even make a quarter decent steak, this can easily be your big guns showoff recipe. Like holy shit, I can't even express how accurate the anime taster reactions are. The refreshing rice balances out what would normally be a heavy handed taste.<br><br>If I had one major tip for anyone trying this dish yourself: DONT MAKE ENOUGH. Next time I will half the steaks I buy. It's the kind of food that will have you crawling back for more, but if you make a fuck ton and eat it all at once until you cant eat anymore, it loses its appeal and can even get dissatisfying pretty quickly. Treat it like oil and only let people have it in small amounts, then promise them some more next time.<br>timestamp 11:52 for our reaction while eating the onion sauce also smells fucking delicious <br>https://<span>youtu.be/4j202mFMGAA?t=711  [ ]</br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Especially naked apron sempai putting his all into the song. I wish I had a sempai like him in high school, not even gay.</br>  <br>He is talented in the sense that he worked hard and gained a good level of mastery in the kitchen, but he's nor naturally gifted (like erina or currynigger) nor has an outstanding talent for cooking.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br> The reactions are 100% accurate <br>So you and your friend let out 20+ years wort of semen while eating it?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thats because it is budget as fuck bro. Like I said earlier, the sauce was perfect but as we cooked the eggs it really started to clump up and turn to shit, we thought all was ruined until we discovered the adding hot water trick. So it's not perfect, but it still tastes amazing and for my first eggs benny in history I think a little thick sauce is ok. The other thing I would improve is more pork, thin ham slices werent enough you need a real chunk of meat to get the most out of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rice looks terrible. Meat and onions look all right.<br><br>You're right about having too much meat. That thick slab looks like a fucking monster. compared to everything else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yes we did. Shit was unreal.</br>  <br>It's not just saltiness, it gives it a fishy taste. It's almost like seafood eggs benny.</br>  <br>I need to try this at some point.<br>While it isn't going to look like the animu counterpart, is it possible to make the onions maintain their golden colour after frying them in wine. It'd look much nicer.<br>Also, you added too much water to the rice</br></br></br>  <br>Also when she finds out who Souma's dad is.</br>  <br>Yeah I suck at rice. As for the onions, I really think that would be a challenge and that they exaggerated in the anime. Keep in mind the sauce consists of meat juice, red wine, and burnt soy sauce. No matter how you cook the onions those are pretty dark ingredients. I could be wrong, but i think you'd have to add something to color it. The spring onions on top might make it look nicer though.</br>  <br> Yeah I suck at rice. <br>4:5 rice-to-water ratio in a rice cooker always seems to work for me.</br></br>  Bro I just want the dad making a surprise appearance and saving souma in a drastic situation. Everyone would be flipping out by the sight of him and everything and his father would probably have make some plain af dish but would make the people tasting it jizz more than souma could make them  <br>Ah yeah, the soy sauce. I forgot about that.<br>It'd probably be doable if you put the soy sauce in with the rice instead. If you then caramelised the onions and didn't go too mad with the red wine, I think you could make those onions have a bit of gold in them. It'd be good to try it out, though properly caramelising onions takes a lot longer.<br><br>For the rice, just try to get the water ratio right. Apparently, you should have around 1.5-1.75 times as much water as rice volume wise when cooking. The longer the grain, the more water you'll need. But you also need to make sure you don't cook it for too long. 10 minutes I find is a good length of time. Around 15mins and you start getting mushy crap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think moving the soy sauce would work. The soy sauce is part of what makes the onions godlike, you dont wanna fuck with those onions anon. Putting it in the rice also removes the refreshing zest that they give to balance out the dish, and would make the entire thing heavy like nikumis dish was.<br><br>Also I want to reiterate, don't settle for plum sauce. It has to be pickled plum.</br></br></br>  <br>That actually sounds tasty.</br>  <br>Does the zest from the soy sauce come from frying it? if so, then yeah, I can understand not wanting to put it on the rice alone.<br><br>you really want to maintain a salty kick from the onions, then the only other thing I could think of to improve the colour and also buff the onions is frying it with hoisin instead. It's nowhere near as darkening and also has a great sweetness which both boosts the caramelised onion's sweetness and also pairs with the steak brilliantly</br></br></br>  <br>Would frying the onions with honey work?</br>  <br>Nononono, the zest is in the rice. Thats the refreshing kick. The soy sauce deepens and makes the flavor heavy and... umami. Watch the original clip, its exactly like the judges describe it. I recommend trying to make it once before tweaking, the hoisin really sounds like a good way to try on your second cook though.</br>  <br>You don't know until you try :) Post the result tomorrow.</br>  <br> italy  <br> no custom about Santa <br>Lies!</br></br></br>  <br>Prelims were fun as fuck</br>  <br>Have a try. It would certainly make the dish very sweet. Just make sure you add it late, or it'll caramelise and burn</br>  <br>Ah of course. Good point. Rice really is a different beast when it's got soy sauce mixed in.</br>  <br><br>Megumi is too precious</br></br>  What's with Yugi's scary look on Souma this chapter? Do you think that he realized what he's doing and thought of countermeasures?  <br>He recognized the oven. Also, reasonably, he's not going to be an idiot. So it's certainly likely that he's already though up plans.</br>  <br>truly a besy</br>  <br>best*</br>  Translation never  Nikumi a Shit  <br> You a shit </br>  <br>truth</br>  <br><br>You is best girl. Don't hate.</br></br>  <br>Index? Oh wait.</br>  <br>inb4 its revealed there was a childhood rivalry with Souma, about attaining recognition from Jouichirou surpassing him as a chef but she has since forgotten his face.<br><br>Gonna get Nisekoi'ed.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, the girls are practically Hinako and Fuyumi.</br>  <br><br> loli hair mandibles <br><br>what happens if you pull loli Erina's hair mandibles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's too cliche and it's not gonna happen. Erina looks a bit too old in the pic and if she could remember Jouichiro back then she would remember a childhood friend. She remembers her squabbles with Alice when they were 5 years old. So nope.</br>  <br>Although Souma can be just a guy served an impressive entry dish, could grandpa know Souma already since Jouichirou was hired?</br>  <br>Shell probably try to hit and kick at you.</br>  <br><br>her wig will fag</br></br>  <br>Her bodyguards jump you.</br>  <br><br>*fall</br></br>  <br><br> Joichiro says the secret to being a great cook is having a woman to devote all your cooking to <br> Soma declares he will exhaust all of his cooking skills to make sure Erina says it's "delicious" <br><br>sasuga tsukuda<br>like poetry</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Tsukuda still remembers these scenes and hasn't forgotten because of the looooooong pacing.</br>  <br> Implying Erina is whom Souma will end up with and not the whom she'll get her ass handed in cooking </br>  <br> in italy there's no custom about santa <br>Do they even Italy?</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it the first chapter? That would be easy to remember for him. I can imagine things in the middle can be forgettable but I don't think he'll have a problem with that plot point.<br><br>But then again, mangaka tend to forget many plot points as time, fanbase and society influences him/her to change shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>instant best girl</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> you will never be her onii-chan and bully her by pulling her god's tongue out making her cry  <br> you will never play with her hair mandibles and tease that she has a mustache now as you pull them under her nose <br> you will never feel her frail kicking and punching as you chuckle at her <br> you will never drive her to the supermarket to buy ingredients so you can cook together <br> you will never go into a fatal car accident and she'll survive but lose her onii-chan <br> your death will never be the reason she's such a bitch in the future <br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Future or Past  You?</br>  say have we ever seen souma hug anyone?  <br>Fumio</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  I like Meat, she's cute.<br>I wish she had a chance to win the Soumabowl.<br>I hope she doesn't end up with Don-senpai.</br></br>  <br><br> Past, though future is great, too. </br></br>    <br>I guess the only girls Souma is comfortable with getting in his personal space is old ladies</br>  <br> it's not an onii-chan <br> it's an onee-chan <br> it will be Souma's mom <br> employed as a maid <br> dies in the car crash <br> Souma's dad left the Nakiri employ shortly after his wife's death. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  How much trouble would have Erina got if others found out about her dropping Souma without being fair about his food?<br>Seriously, she was acting behalf of the school/Nakiri clan, and like the others said her words have weight - can trash one's career completely.

Bias faggotry at its finest</br></br>  <br>Now I imagine shaved bara Takumi. Oh god.</br>  <br>Anon that's a disgusting mental image.</br>  <br><br>I don't find Soma as amazing as most and I'd rather see him fight his way up cause it's more interesting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><br>Things will of course change between now and year 3 but as it is, current rankings have Erina &gt; Hayama &gt; Soma = Ryo &gt; Alice &gt; Takumi so the predictions follow that. Alice only gets a boost because Nakiri privilege</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd agree with ranking chefs if this was a powerlevel shounen, too bad this is a cooking manga.<br><br>The matches they participate are dependent on the menu and the specialties of the participants meaning even the strongest contender could still lose if he/she fights an enemy on the enemies turf.<br><br>It all depends on the setting of the match anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nakiri  alice </br>  <br> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </br>  <br>I agree with that, but since the E10 is a ranked list someone will be higher or lower.<br><br>And they made a point of discussing each contestant's strengths relative to the subject matter and how each tried to compensate for their weaknesses or not.<br>The saury during the finals was seafood for ryo, rich and aromatic for hayama, and popular for soma, soma had to compensate for his weakness in selecting fresh fish<br>Soma had the advantage during the bento match with Alice<br>Mimasaka had the advantage over takumi and soma, takumi had no prep time but soma did<br><br>You can argue shit like this forever but by year 3 none of this stuff could matter. Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling and drop to rank 9.<br><br>Erina is rank 10 now but she could very well be "better" than 8 and 9. The ranks are a ballpark but people treat them like absolutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling <br>That could easily get him expelled. But obviously Ryou isn't the type to do that anyway. I honestly don't think you'd simply lose your rank simply because your special talent is lost or impaired. With that logic Erina could drop as well if she couldn't use her God's tongue.</br></br>  <br>Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. All of them are highly competent but their specialties are what got them so high. Hayama without his nose would still have his knowledge of spices but he won't be able to pull out their potential entirely.<br><br>He'll still be good but he'll lose the edge that won him the finals. But maybe he'll learn to stop relying on his nose so much.<br><br>Hayama vs stinky sadatsuka might be an interesting match if her stinky stuff overwhelms his nose</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. <br>We honestly don't know that. Her skill and technique could also be complemented by her God's Tongue. Chefs still need to rely on their sense of taste more than anything else. She pretty much has been dependent on it all her life. The only time we can say she's still as good without it if she cooks without having a single taste of her dish.</br></br>  <br>Oh my bad if it sounds like I'm disagreeing with your assessment on Erina. I'm not. Without her tongue I think she'd be making food that's textbook good but nothing special or unique. Her whole thing is about perfection.</br>  Made a Fresh Orange and Cream Tart.<br><br>1.

Why she doesn't participate more? Is her cooking THAt good?</br>  <br><br>Her intention is just not wanting to run into him. I'm talking about her already at that slippery slope of caring or liking him and she doesn't understand why she's feeling this way due to her naivety to love.</br></br>  <br>She's getting more screen time with her tasting Souma's dishes lately</br>  <br>Her cooking is absolutely godly by first year standards.<br>Basically having her in competitions when she's already 10th seat is unfair to other students and her scores are most likely straight As.</br></br>  <br>A hurdle for Souma to overcome because her taste &gt; everybody else' taste</br>  <br><br>With how the series is with foodgasms, it's like he's declaring he's going to use all his power to have sex with her.</br></br>  <br>Would you be up for a civil union?</br>  <br><br>Erina's foodgasm was already lewd when she was suppressing Soma's furikake. Imagine how lewd it'll be when she finally embraces his food and considers it delicious.</br></br>  <br><br>Obviously you have not read Ichigo 100%. Erina winning the Soumabowl is not obvious a guaranteed shoe-in. She was clearly an antagonist for like the 100 chapters romantic interest. And you're implying that Souma will have any romantic interest with any of the girls in the near future. And you are an obvious Erinafag,</br></br>  <br>I think Erina will become something like Asuna in Negima  please no Negima ending  once it turns out they are related.</br>  <br> hujiao bing <br>Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that like uber-plebian food?<br>Although I have to admit it's a good counter to mapo doufu and being a pleb is Souma's strong point.</br></br></br>  <br>So does Soma subconsciously have the goal of impressing her every time he cooks?</br>  How would Souma even have the funds to make enough buns to rival a full-manned restaurant?  <br>I assume they get some funds from academy as a kind of loan, hece the whole expulsion thingy.</br>  <br>He's gonna fail spectacularly. He won't bee expelled thanks to Erina.</br>  <br>Nah</br>   NEW SOUMA'S GAZE! <br> lasts 2 chapters <br>I'm glad.</br></br>  <br>MEGUMI</br>  <br>Well Hujiaobao are cheap as fuck in materials compared to mapo doufu so I guess that's something. Are Yugi and Souma competing for highest profits or most portions sold, because Souma could cheese the system since most customers would buy more than one if they plan to eat a 'meal' in Souma's place but nobody really orders more than one bowl / serving of mapo doufu.</br>    <br>This. I was hating him already.</br>  <br> Megumi - lovable country bumpkin  <br> Meat - Meat <br> Erina - princess type <br><br>Megumi wins less hassle</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Where's that anon who said he would translate it? Is he still alive?</br>    <br> yfw this is how Erina will try to impress Soma after she falls </br>  <br>Lucky little twerp</br>  <br><br>I can't think of any situation for Erina to grow as a character except making her lose big time that she'll go into a journey to find herself. <br><br>Maybe something like lose a shokugeki where she loses everything (how, why, i dunno) that brings her down to the lowest of lows. It can set up as those stories where the big headed egotistical person finds more to life than what he/she knows. And why not make it that she loses all of her luxuries and ultimately land herself in the Polar Star Dorm and find herself there and go to some inspirational healing character arc?<br><br>The only problem with this theory is that I can't imagine her losing everything with her grandfather tied so heavily to the school. Though he seems the kind to let Erina go into a healing phase if she loses big time instead of pampering her further.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wait, has Souma even actually tasted Erina's dish?   you're cooking when this beauty suddenly appears  <br><br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Lose to Souma, disbelief on how his dish rocked her world, humbled/mellowed out,  marriage . Or she could just be that huge unchanging wall until the end</br>  <br>Keep cooking, I like being stared at</br>  <br> beauty <br><br>albinos are fucking disgusting<br><br>I bet IRL you could see all her veins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't even be shocked if there were some kind of custom in Nakiri main branch that if you lose a cooking duel you have to marry that person.</br>  <br>He's never tasted a dish she's made, not even her eggs.</br>  <br>Would explain Nakiris' reaction here <br>Thinking it was a marriage proposal? Who knows, its just crack theory at his point  but funny </br></br>  <br>Senzaemon won't really care if Erina loses and would likely see it as good learning experience for her. Remember he also vetoed her decision not to pass Souma for the transfer extrance exam which shows she prides herself too much. Her other granddaughter Alice already lost to Souma in the Autumn Elections and he was one of the judges.</br>  <br>How can she be so perfect?</br>  <br>Its the black/red evil eyes on her snowy white body and hair. I would love to tongue her butthole</br>  <br> a single harem title <br> against hundreds of harems <br>nice try kiddo</br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  I made an extra-bacony gotcha roast pork last night...  so glad it's finally a 24 ep series.  <br>seems light and nutritive <br><br> ... </br></br></br>  <br>I'm feeling a bit of mild stroke just looking at it, would still eat</br>  <br><br> she loses to Eizan or someone higher than her in the E10 <br> stipulation is she gives away everything she acquired (the clubs she's taken, privileges, etc.) to him if she wants the upper seats <br> Erina literally a hobo with no place to live <br> Hisako tries to help her but since she's Erina's aide, that makes her one of Erina's privileges she already gave away from losing <br> no place to go <br> trying to act cool and calm <br> only has her shoujo manga to keep her by <br> suddenly Soma  <br> he sees her predicament and invites her to stay at the PSD <br> Erina goes full tsun, trying to hide she has no trouble at all but reluctantly accepts cause she has no choice <br> PSD healing arc begins </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisako would follow her everywhere though, no matter what.</br>  <br>It pretty much fell apart once I got it on my plate but god damn it was delicious. The leftovers tasted even better this morning, all the flavors really blended well once it was refrigerated and then warmed up in the microwave.</br>  <br>I mean it is actually pretty common trope for  side characters in harems  from rich families to be bound to mc after losing to him. Would fit, even if Erina is more prominent.</br>  <br>Jesus, I don't think my heart can take that much meat and fat in one plate</br>  <br>I just want to see Souma serving her up and looking all smug and handsome,  no homo </br>  <br> He looks like a totally new person <br> it last 2 chapters </br></br>  <br>I would gobble up his d ish  and Im a hetero guy.</br>  <br>Looks like a semen demon.</br>  <br>I barely ever eat bacon but I think I got my quota for the year. I wrapped the potato-mushroom mix in this bacon weave so the twine wasn't necessary. I tucked sprigs of rosemary in between the weave and the potato. My only failure was the sauce. I started making the sauce while in was finishing the roast under the broiler... however my broiler is shit and took fucking forever to brown the top so the sauce got way too thick. Still tasted good though.</br>  <br>He looks older/with longer hair, but he's not been in that style since that chapter.</br>  <br>I bet, still sleeping off this mini stroke, thanks</br>  <br><br>I remember when the leaks came around, people thought we're getting a big timeskip.<br><br>Makes me wonder if we'll get a legit timeskip. However, this is a school-set manga so unless the manga still continues after school, I doubt we'll see a 2 year timeskip and have every guy be beefier and all the girls grow more voluptuous than they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That image was only to imply Souma had a big power up in his cooking.</br>  <br> once it turns out they are related. <br>nah, I doubt there'll be a connection like that. If there was, the other Nakiris would have at least left dropped a hint.<br><br>What I do expect is that we'll discover Jouichirou was the son of a noble, who was disowned after he broke off an arranged marriage, and married a mere commoner. And perhaps that woman he broke it off the 'engagement' to was Senzaemon's daughter. Senzaemon probably matched the two together himself, hoping to create the ultimate cook. But it fell through... so Senzaemon had to wait for the next generation to come about.<br><br>Now, given the cost of sending Soma to an elite private school, Jouichirou's employer is probably Senzaemon. In exchange working at his restaurants &amp; hotels, Soma gets a free education. Most likely. Senzaemon likely arranged it so the two would meet from the very beginning, hoping the two would one day wed. So that 'god tongue' and the son of (taking a wild guess here) 'god hands' will create the ultimate offspring. The old man watching them from the shadows and his crazy eyes can't be just 'coincidental'.<br><br>Course this is all theoretical, and probably will never be touched on or if it was, pieces of it wouldn't be unveiled til the very end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Senzaemon <br> commoner </br></br>  <br>How do you factor in Jouichirou apparently working for the Nakiris at one point, that's how Erina gets to know him.</br>  I want to stick my penis inside megumi.<br><br> And hold hands. </br></br>  <br>You mean Senzaemon has keikaku?</br>  This time: some images from GuP: Ribbon Warrior 2 and webraws for the latest Gate chapter  I just thought this was funny.

Could it potentially cause mass extinctions if used by the wrong person? <br><br><br>Does it matter to evolve? I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br>You lose out on the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP</br>   releases Goodra <br><br>He deserves it.</br></br>  Why is he standing on the podium with four Pokemon looking like an autist while the other two are by themselves?  At least it isn't Tobias<br><br>Cheating motherfucker</br></br>  Ash being in the top 4 of pretty much every pokemon league should have gained him some fame by now. He should be a world renowned top trainer.   losing while having hawlucha in your team <br>How bad of a trainer someone needs to be to accomplish that?</br>  <br> unevolved shitmons <br> not even eviolite <br>gee I wonder why?</br></br></br>  <br>He deserved to lose. Three of his pokemon are flying types. <br>Any Electric attack would fuck up 3/4ths of his party.</br></br>  <br>What is this? A random tournament or the real league?</br>  <br>It was a fucking flying league<br>Not the big one<br><br>Fuck, they didn't even really battle, It was a race</br></br></br></br>  If he had Pidgeot things would be different  <br>He has never even managed to beat a single pokemon of any of the like 30 elite four. He's not a top trainer.</br>  We will all die of old age before Ash wins the league  <br>Then my mistake, I apologize. <br><br>He could have still chosen better flying types however. Last I checked, his Charizard was still alive.</br></br></br>  Wait, did they actually have the league tournament already?  <br> implying Ash will get into the podium <br>That's not the league OP. He hasn't even completed the 8 gyms</br></br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  Wonder what Gary's doing.  <br>Subs out?</br>  At least he has a Hawlucha on his team, so he has decent taste  <br>Isn't it off boning all the female charizards on charizard island or something?<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127321 </br>  <br>It better be. Either that, or Oak's been studying it for the past 18 years</br>    <br>They're like the national team members, though. He's top sixteen in multiple championships. He's also ten. This is also the fucking Pokémon anime, so obviously I'm being overly autistic here.</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>We will die of old age before ash turns<br>20</br></br>  <br>manlets ass nigga on the second place podium and is still the shortest</br>  <br>That's because he's a grade schooler.</br>  <br> Manlet <br>He's 10</br></br>  <br>Like what said<br>  10 yrs old <br>  constantly in top rank of every league he's in <br>  did win orange islands <br>  anime for whatever stupid reason progressed, at most, two years <br>  Had an adventure with practically every legendary pokemon, including the fuggin god of their universe, Arceus <br><br>He's a walking PR machine considering every adventure is visiting another podunk town and being their posterboy darling by the end of the episode. Ash should be swimming in worldwide accolade considering how much he gets done</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or whom</br>  <br>If you're going to complain about this, you might as well complain about the fact that somehow he has difficulty with every gym leader.</br>  <br>so aside from being shit, how did he fuck up this time? what did the Pokemon producers have the guy who beat him pull against him, more legendaries?</br>  <br>Fuck you, onbat was awesome.</br>  <br>Ash gets cucked out of a win every time, it's been like this for years. Nintendo or whoever the fuck owns pokemon is just trying to drag it out as long as possible with as little effort possible. If they made Ash win they'd have to come up with a new MC every season.</br>  <br>Or they could make him win the tournament, lose to the E4 (so he doesn't have to stay there) and keep training, as happens with every actual sportsman who wins a tournament. But fuck that, kids don't know how shit really works.</br>  <br>He's busy catching new seasonal crap and testing their limits in relevant scenarios. Considering gym battles are free to any challenger, what trainer who wants to know the ins and outs of every pokemon wouldn't actually put their latest catches to the test in these sort of scenarios?</br>  <br><br>anime power levels aren't linear.<br><br>pikachu fucks up megas and legendaries and loses to dickass babymons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not enough to be famous in a sport. He's way worse than every Elite Four member so thats 30 people above him plus all the people who beat him in tourneys there's like at the very very least 50 people who are above him. Do you know the top 50 basketball players or football players? No you only know like the top 5 such as Kobe Bryant and Lebron James. Ash isn't even top 50 pokemon trainers in the world so why would anyone know of him.</br>  <br><br>because he's 10 years old. everyone better than him is way older. ritchie was the exception but ash has long surpassed him.</br></br>  <br><br>What kind of message is that sending to kids?</br></br>  <br>Sometimes you win sometimes you lose?</br>  <br>We also know people like Kris Jenner who's crap at the sport but because he tapped a Kardashian he ends up being in the news. Ash doesn't just go into leagues, he beats the shit out of an international criminal organization daily, globetrots to every goddamn place in the world, and pulls off local newsworthy endeavors every town he visits.<br><br>As an athlete, sure, he's pretty crap, but saying a kid of 10 meeting up with another legendary pokemon, who also is the same guy that saved town X from a fire, town Y from a a huge theft attempt, and town Z from a natural disaster within the same area somehow doesn't get nationally known?</br></br></br>  <br>Where's this from anon?</br>  <br> Filler bird tournament <br><br>Nice one, rusemaster</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of loser gets on the podium with his losing team.<br>Has he no shame?</br></br>  <br>I just found out who Kris (is it actually with a "K"? Holy shit, I wish I hadn't found out about this faggot) Jenner was about an hour ago, but I was told he was an Olympic champion, which sounds pretty far above crap.<br><br><br>Let's say he's like top-fifty in the world in an individual sport or something. Sure, my mom probably won't know him, but if the guy who placed fourth or whatever in the Canadian championships shows up at the American ones, you bet people there will know his name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's over already?<br><br>Was the last battle good?</br></br></br>  <br>he lost<br><br>so no</br></br></br>  <br>My bad, Kris Humphries. Either or, agreed Ash should show up on someone's blip when he goes somewhere</br>  <br>This. Only a few names in a sport have massive recognition, but athletes or big fans will know them. It's like how we act as though everyone knows what Madoka is, except in the real world only a tiny fraction of people do.</br>    <br>Kid needs to start finding new careers shit is clearly not working for him. If this things continue his future will only lead to him being a drunkard and impregnating some whore and being forced to raise a kid while being a deadbeat dad. Now i want a sequel</br>  <br>Of course he's going to stick with the Pokemon he's currently traveling with. Got to train them up.<br><br><br>Nah. Ash called it back during Unova after the league, and dropped it off at Oak's lab when he got back to Pallet Town.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like you'll always fails when it matters.</br>  <br> Ash Ketchum was 10yo in 1997 <br>He's 32 you ignoramus</br></br>  <br> Ash places 2nd <br> He looks like he's 3rd <br>Fucking manlets.</br></br></br>  <br> 17 fucking years <br> still hasn't done shit with his life <br> still hasn't even done anything with his NEET experience <br> has met gods and saved the world many times over but can't win a small tournament of amateur trainers </br></br></br></br>  <br>he lost...a fucking fly race competition you retarded mothefucker</br>   this competition is boring <br> my feet hurt <br> are they using NFEs? plebs <br> I wish I was riding my altaria through the skies <br> tfw superior taste in pokemon <br> oh god why are they so fucking short, manlets <br> tfw best looking guy in the competition <br> wanting first place, its about the sport kid <br> OH GOD WHY AM I BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this guy was actually in the lead when Team Rocket pulled their shit on him. <br> he'd have won if not for them </br></br>  <br>he was actually offered to be turned pokemon master by Hoopa (leading legendary pokemon in the next movie),  but he declined the offer </br>  <br>No, Hoopa thought a Pokemon Master was an object it could summon for him and he had to explain it wasn't.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, had Mega Fug.</br>  <br>Hoopa is actually the dumbest pokemon design I've ever seen</br>  <br>what's that pokemon in the left?</br>  <br>Fucking Tobias, holy shit.</br>  <br>Yeah? The actual set of fucking keys doesn't do it for you?</br>  <br> Can't win a single tournament <br> But ends up saving the world multiple times over while meeting legendary pokemon and Gods that people thought were legends <br><br>Honestly, I wouldn't be disappointed if I was his dad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"you tried"</br>  <br>You think I'm watching this kiddy shit nerd?</br>  <br>What is the Orange League, and the Battle Frontier?</br>  Reminder that pokemon movies are not canon  <br> Hoopa is stronger than Pokemon that created the universe and Mega Fug <br><br>I still can't believe it.</br></br></br>  <br> hating based klefki </br>  <br>OL was filler.<br>He didn't win BF.</br></br>  <br>The cutest little fucker imaginable.</br>  <br> He didn't win BF. <br>He did.<br>He was offered position as a frontier brain but turned it down.<br><br><br>I don't like him much. I'm still salty about Sylveon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that they are.</br>  <br>Is Hoopa the strongest Pokemon?</br>  <br>Hoopa is the master of all universes though.<br>Maybe. I didn't read the manga.</br></br>  <br>You would think creating a generic MC every 3 seasons or so wouldn't be THAT hard, just pick the next generation MC from the damn game. You could have loads of cameos from established world characters too. I'm really waiting for the entire show to end and a revival being done (better than the recent attempt) in a few years.</br>  <br>Hoopa did this.<br>Half as a joke.</br></br>  <br>Is that actually the league? He actually lost again? Ayyy and you faggots thought he would win and date that short haired girl</br>  <br> falling for a shitty ruse and not even reading the thread <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br> Ash <br> pokemon anime <br> ever getting anything done <br>We'll be dead by the time the writers actually do something innovative or just discontinue the abomination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lame. Red sucked in Origins.<br>I thank God that they knew what they were doing and didn't try making a new MC, we all know he would have been worse than Ash. <br><br>Plus Rica isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</br></br></br></br>  Sure is /v/ here today.  <br>This. Seriously the fuck are these autists doing here instead of on their actual board. No self respecting /a/non should be watching this garbage or taking it seriously.</br>  <br>I mean you, /v/tard. Go back there.</br>  <br>This might surprise you but much like Pokemon, much of the shit you watch is aimed at children.</br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be /vp/rather</br>  <br>WHAT? He actually fucking did that?<br><br>The fucking people over on TTP really do make better decisions than Ash in the anime.</br></br></br>   Ash will never retire <br><br>defend this bullshit<br><br>they can't develop his character any further he is stale and at this point he is in the show mostly for shipping purposes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He had to. It wanted to stay to protect its family.<br>It's not like he just said "Well, I don't want you anymore, goodbye."</br></br>  <br>No, /vp/ isn't dumb enough to fall for OP's ruse.</br>  <br>Ash is a good character. He doesn't exist for character development. The show doesn't exist for character development. It exists for fun adventures and advertising. Not everything needs or exists for character development.<br><br>Not to mention they actually could develop his character further.</br></br></br>  <br>the writters hate Ash<br><br> the last thing of worth he actually won was almost 10 yrs ago <br> they gave him a pseudo just to release it <br><br><br>it was poor writing <br><br> ash has no good pokemon to fight clemont <br> hurr durr here is a pseudo legendary <br> press win button to win gimmick <br><br>ruined the gym match for me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the anime would be slightly better if it had a main character that could develop alongside its travelling partners. <br><br>Ash is stale.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because Ash isn't supposed to develop. He's just here to demonstrate the pokemon from the current game.</br>  <br><br>The nice thing about Ash is that his performance is actually consistent with his skill level. He did poorly in season 1 because he was new and naive, then progressed gradually in each season and league (except BW).<br><br>Meanwhile Origins Red is a complete fucking idiot but just plot armors his way to victory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Electric pokemon defeated by electricity </br>  <br>I want to know why the grass-type didn't do anything to the ground type.</br>  <br><br> Cheater <br><br>You can bring your legendaries if you want, Ash has befriended so many of them that he could call them for the leagues, but he is a casual.</br></br></br></br>  Is he still waiting?  <br><br><br>I'm really hoping Ash swaps his Pokemon around in the XY League, like he did in Sinnoh.</br></br></br>  <br><br>of course he will, they need him to market megas.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck the hell on off. The show has no fucking concept of character growth, every season they pull the whole "ash loses to low level gym leader so he has to train and learn a valuable lesson!" bullshit, and everyone involved in making that show has no fucking idea how the game works.<br> fucking rhyhorn OHKOing a jolteon with thunderbolt <br>That not the character sucking, thats the writers having no idea/not giving a fuck about how the ingame mechanics work</br></br></br>  <br>ash gave it away, he's not coming back</br>  Good thread imo  <br>Did Ash's Primeape ever come back?</br>  <br><br> anime has to adhere directly to the games <br><br>found the retard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ash sucks, but Red doesn't suck, it's just the writer's fault! </br>  <br> <br>I don't know what game accuracy has to do with character growth, but I hope you're not implying Origins is better in either regard than the ashnime.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off. They're both steaming piles of shit, and I never said otherwise<br><br>It doesnt have to, but whenever i see something like hyperbeam being spammed with no consequences one episode, but then requiring the standard recharge the next I stroke out a little</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I don't even remember it liking him or him really liking it.</br>  <br><br>Remind me which episodes this inconsistency is in?</br></br>  So my brother is rewatching Pokemon on  Netflix  and Misty is cute as fuck.  <br>HAHAHA WHAT A FAGGOT</br>  At this point it feels like people are trying hard looking for reasons to hate ash<br> hurr hurr he doesn't catch'em all <br>dub exclusive tagline<br> durr he doesn't know type matchups <br>even though the anime makes it pretty clear that he does know about type advantages and disadvantages, but he is a trainer who thinks outside of the box and his battle style consists of doing unpredictable shit. Relying on types would be predictable<br> hurr he loses all his battles, he rarely wins <br>more like he rarely fucking loses. He might lose at the pokemon league but before that he's almost unstoppable<br> he's an idiot for releasing his strong pokemon <br>being a good trainer doesn't mean just having a bunch of strong pokemon, it means loving them, understanding them. Ash loves his pokemon and their happiness is more important to him than his dream of becoming a master.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any idea how many episodes there are?</br>  <br> tfw he will probably evolve <br>;_;</br></br>  <br><br>So they were expending less energy in one? Who gives a shit?<br><br>The game has stupid fucking rules too, like ground moves hitting flying pokemon that aren't flying types. Game mechanics are simplified abstractions of combat for the sake of playability, while the anime is more dynamic and not bound by arbitrary rules. It makes for more interesting fights.<br><br>tldr you're a faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ash is pretty based this time around.<br> Maybe a little too based, unless they seriously plan to end it. <br>I think he could benefit from having a strategy sometimes though. He's getting too cocky.</br></br></br>  <br> ashnime </br>  <br> being a good trainer doesn't mean just having a bunch of strong pokemon <br>Yes it does, /vp/ agrees, don't bother them about it</br></br>  <br> like ground moves hitting flying pokemon that aren't flying types. <br>Stopped reading there<br> Thousand arrows doesnt fucking exist.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember Pikachu doing this shit back in Kanto.</br>  I sometimes wish this show went the manga route and got new main characters for every season.  <br>He learns new moves every once in a while.</br>  <br><br>It didn't have iron tail in Kanto.</br></br>  <br>If anyone's in need of character development, it's fucking Pikachu. After it's complete 180 in the first episode, it's been essentially the same since.</br>  <br><br>I think you stopped even earlier because you clearly didn't fucking understand the sentence. Read it again.</br></br>  <br><br>are the manga MCs any different from each other? <br><br>they're blank slates in the games and i don't see the anime doing anything but generic hotblooded shonen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remind me again how Ash loses the leagues when his Pokemon are capable pulling off this stuff.</br>  <br>He faces some faggot who has a team of legendaries</br>  <br>Ash really comes close to winning it during Sinnoh. His team was at his best. The writers had to introduce tobias with legendaries in order to stop him from winning the league. And he even manage to defeat 2 of tobias legendaries.</br>  <br>:( This always happens. At least Ash won the Battle Frontier.</br>  <br><br>Well you are comparing a 4-ep ova used to promote a megas over a multi season anime(which can show more on the character's journey)</br></br>  <br>Ash didn't use Infernape or Charizard against Tobias<br><br>always pissed me off<br>he had a 3-6 pokemon team that could fight Tobias but he didn't use them</br></br></br></br>  <br>noice 8th gen confirmed</br>  <br>It doesn't matter what team he used since they intended ash to lose against him.</br>  <br>And the orange island league.</br>  <br> NFE non-gimmick pokemon in a national tournament <br>Retard alert.</br></br>  is he still 10? haven't watched this shit since I literally was 10.   mfw I stopped watching somewhere in the middle of DP. <br><br>I heard that the XY series is good. Can I skip Unova? Should I watch the first XY movie with my imouto for nostalgia's sake?</br></br>  <br>BW is shit so it's better if you skip it.</br>  <br>I didn't watch Unova so yeah, you can skip that shit.</br>  <br><br> Stealth Rock <br> walk into a closet and masturbate for 30 minutes <br> come back, oh I beat Ash </br></br></br></br>  How is Pikachu not level 100 and fucking up everybody?  <br> level 100 pikachu <br> fucking up everybody </br></br>  <br> not getting fucking lazy with the random encounters <br> Not just putting a high ish level mon in front and spamming their strongest move <br> Giving a shit about type advantage when you end up 10+ levels higher than them </br></br></br>    Wait what the fuck, I first watched this shit when I was in kindergarten, how is this nigger still 10 or whatever?  Wait he beat the league already? Does that mean he has to split up with Serena? Fuck.  <br>I think you missed his point<br>Pikachu is a shitmon</br></br>  <br><br>Infernape was exhausted from its fight with Paul. Not sure what happened to Charizard, but the fact he didn't beat Darkrai with a Guts boosted STAB megahorn means the whole fight was bullshit, so it didn't matter.</br></br>  <br> implying Ash can even win the league </br>    <br> Stealth Rock <br> Hawlucha <br>Ya goofed</br></br></br>   Ash   For a show with the premise of mc wanting to become a pokemon master, the mc sure fucking sucks at everything.  <br>You mean<br> Yes it does, smogon agrees, don't bother them about it </br></br>  It's a good thing that /a/ has regular Pokemon threads now. The anime threads at /vp/ have become cancerous due to their excessive love for Serena. I haven't been there in a few weeks, since the shipping posts there got really bad.<br><br><br>The show is trying to give a message that winning isn't always everything.</br></br></br>  <br> The show is trying to give a message that winning isn't always everything. <br><br>what bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Is Kirito your favourite character?</br>  <br>No but Kintaro is</br>  <br>His name is not ash ketchum damnit, fuken EFL</br>  shouldnt pikachu be fucking level 3000 at this point<br>why is he so weak</br>  For every moron here who clearly hasn't watched the anime in the last few years no that is not the League. Ash only recently beat the 6th Gym and and that's episode 77 that's a Sky Relay basically a race between Flying types the guy Ash lost to was it's Champion the last year and Ash nearly tied with him he only lost because his Noibat was born only a fucking episode ago (Episode 76) Can you fucks at least try with your hatred of Ash? Seriously for fucks sake.  <br>because the writters want Ash weak so he can easily lose the league and move on.</br>  <br>Didn't you know that the lifespan of one Pikachu is only one season? Right now he should be Pikachu #19.</br>  <br> being this ass blasted of an Ashfag </br>  <br>What i am ass blasted about are people who haven't watched the anime in years and somehow think they can talk shit about the Anime despite that and faggots like OP stirring up bullshit. Seriously how does Ash getting 2nd place only barely losing to the Champion of the previous year in a race mean he will lose the league?</br>  <br>And before anyone replies going 'hurr durr you think Ash will win the league XD' No i don't think that but i don't see how Ash losing a race to the previous Champion means he sucks dick and will lose the league. He WILL lose the league but i don't see why this means he absolutely will.</br>  <br><br> OL was filler. <br><br>The entire show is fucking filler</br></br></br></br>  <br>take a chill pill, Ash is definitely going to lose the league as seen in the previous 18 years. <br><br><br>you see you are being butt hurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that what i said? I know Ash is going to lose the league. My issue is that people somehow think a race means Ash sucks and will lose the league for sure. Instead they should base that upon the previous leagues where Ash has lost. I am headed to bed now goodnight you faggots</br>  <br>thanks for the blog</br>  <br>28 ?</br>  <br>Very little of what the average anon watches is targeted at kids.</br>  This actual league shit? Thought he still had badges to get.  <br> potential team filled with OU mons <br> trash </br></br>  <br>That shitty birb probably doesn't even have Gale Wings.<br> unironically using a Flame Body Talonflame </br></br>  Ash still has badges to get you fucking morons.  <br>Bravest bird doesn't need it</br>  <br>Faggots require so much<br> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tag<wbr>s=maydrawfag</wbr> </br></br>  <br>Sinnoh League was Ash at his strongest, so much so that the writers had to throw legendaries at him to justify him losing (he was also the only person to actually beat Darkrai in the entire tournament, and Tobias mentioned that Gible probably could've wrecked the rest of his team or something). XY is looking to be a return to that, especially now that they have a budget.<br><br>We don't talk about Unova.</br></br></br>  What bothers me so much is that Ash can't even grow up and be a mentor character to the next protagonist. <br><br>It would be easy as fuck. Have Cynthia be wowed by his performance and invite him into the Elite 4. Ten years later, a new trainer getting his first Pokemon meets him, and Ash offers to teach him the ropes. <br><br>But that status quo amirite<br><br><br>They are. For instance, while Red is obviously the most Ash-like and Green the most Gary-like, Blue is a con woman, Yellow is an ambiously-gendered newbie, Ruby is a clean freak contest nut, Sapphire is a gym expert raised in the wild, and Platinum is a rich girl with Diamond and Pearl as her wisecracking bodyguards. For starters. <br><br>Not to mention every protagonist has one part of Pokemon they excel at (Red for battling, Gold for raising Pokemon, etc). Crystal, for example, is known as the Pokemon Catcher because she has at least one copy of every non-legendary Pokemon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tell me again when ash wins kanto league</br>    Pikachu can defeat legendaries <br>  Loose against a fucking snivy on BW <br><br>I wish they could just throw this serie and start over with a true MC</br></br></br>   people reading nothing but the first post <br> falling for OP's ruse <br> shitposting about other people being retarded <br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Black is hyper obsessed with beating the E4 to the point he needs a munna to clear his brain or he kinda blows a fuse.<br>White is obsessed with stage shows from what I recall<br><br>B2/W2 has Black being a detective and White being part of Plasma from what I remember as well<br><br>And then XY has Calem being a good trainer but hyper shut in because of paparazzi and Serena was flying co-ordinator I think? I honestly forgot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ash will kill himself before he turns 20</br>  Ash will progress in development the moment Misty and Brock come back. So never.  <br><br>We dont talk about BW</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they wanted a new protagonist in best wishes but then the idea was shot down and instead he was reset to moron for no real reason.</br>  Thanks Obama.  <br><br>What's also bullshit is that Darkrai could take a Megahorn from Heracross.<br>Should've OTK'd him right there</br></br></br>  <br><br>So what happened to Serena? Did Ash drown the soul of another virgin to stay forever young?</br></br>  <br>I think he had a Charizard at some point and always pulled it out of his ass to win gyms. That must've been the first season of the anime or something.</br>  <br>I'm have to give ash credit for coming in 2nd with his team not even being fully evolved.</br>   110 posters <br> at least 50 of them are retards falling for OP's ruse and making a single shitpost in response </br>  <br>not yet</br>  <br> serena <br> virgin <br>fahnny joek</br></br></br>    Cute Serena is cute<br><br><br><br>Still following him</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have an entire neet based summer to get this marathoned, would you say it's worth it? From the little I've seen it looks leagues better than the previous seasons in animation.</br>  <br><br>Its happening again!<br><br>Everybody is aging and growing and Ash is stuck in his time warp.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Easily the best Pokemon series yet.</br>  <br>Animation is better, writing is better, characters are better... if you liked Pokemon at all at some point, it's absolutely worth it.<br><br>Incoming pasta:<br> http://pocketmonsters.edwardk.info<wbr>/</wbr> <br><br> Best Wishes Decolora Adventure 20 is the last episode of the previous season. It spends most of its time setting up XY and XY1 really assumes you've seen it, so it's the recommended place to start. <br> XY episode 0 is a promo special, it's half clips from early Kanto to introduce new kids to some of the show's basics and half clips from the first 10 or so XY episodes to hype you up. Watch if you want, but it's not essential. <br> "Complete Overview! Pocket Monsters XY Special!!" and "Pocket Monsters XY New Year's Eve 2014 Super Mega Special" are clip shows summarizing the previous year's worth of XY episodes and showcasing some upcoming events. Not a bad way to get a taste or the show. <br> Pocket Monsters XY Special - The Strongest Mega Evolution Act I/II/III are special episodes starring a different group of characters. They're in continuity and are full of important setup. Act I aired between XY21 and 22, Act II between XY49 and 50 and Act III between XY64 and 65, the next episode previews will remind you of them when you get there. <br> Best Wishes Season 2 Decolora Adventure Special - Iris VS Ibuki! The Road to Dragon Master!! aired after XY21, it MIGHT be important later, but can probably be skipped. Has some delicious Clair and some XY promos in it though. <br> The XY movie and movie short premiered between XY35 and 36, but appears to be set between XY42 and 43 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By Pokemon standard, it's worth it.</br>  At least going from Kanto to OL to Johto actually felt like progress was made and the characters grew somewhat.  <br><br>Enjoy it</br></br>  <br>Why did she cut her hair again? it looks hideous. I saw the siancie movie and the girl with the sword Pokemon had better short hair.</br>  <br>It's very worth it.</br>  <br> having this shit taste </br>  <br><br>Ok, here goes my autisms.<br><br>It's generation 1 mechanics in this Anime, Jolteon did not have Volt Absorb, either that or he had his second ability.<br><br>Either way, Rhyhorn has a poor special stat, so maybe, since it was the Eevee from Celadon, he was still weak as shit and Red evolved him as soon as he could, then, Rhyhorn landed a crit, that's it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the writters hate Ash <br> proceed to hand him a free victory <br><br>Explain yourself. Also, &gt;writters</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2hx<wbr>JKbQKwqw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>We got new hotness inbound</br></br>  <br>Nah</br>  <br>These four are so cute it hurts.</br>  <br><br>XY has so many cuties</br></br>  <br><br>its not just for me. more power to you.<br><br><br>yeah people showed me that a few a days ago its a good scene. it was a kinda shitty decision, but whatever at least alain vs ash is coming soon according to the op I was linked to a few days ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what do you think of Millefeui's haircut?</br>  <br> generation 1 mechanics in this Anime <br> Mega Charizard X </br></br>  <br>They could just use the male player characters for every region. They already force the girls in every season except for the gen 5 ones.</br>  <br>she has hair? <br>her legs making my dick diamonds its all that matters imo.</br></br>  Serena is so cute  <br>Johto was absolute garbage.</br>  <br> Good taste </br>  <br> Misty <br> progress after togepi <br><br>uwutm80?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They arent going to get rid of Ash because that'd mean getting rid of Pikachu, and that little nigger is the entire franchises mascot</br>  <br><br>Just like in the manga too.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think it's alright except for the hat.</br>  What is the most bullshit anime-only trick Ash has pulled off?   TPCI's dub is so bad it makes the 4kids dub look good in comparison   <br><br>Getting beat by a rookie</br></br>  <br>its the voice acting<br><br><br>you posted it</br></br></br></br>  <br> watching dubs <br/></br>  <br> hilda will never   be ruined by the absolute shit the anime is<br/> <br>feels good</br></br>      <br><br>I am glad they were not in the anime, you are right, Ash would have messed them up</br></br>  <br>Nate is my favourite main character, he's cute.</br>  <br>You little shit.<br><br>You've been granted eternal youth. you've been in several dozen tournaments.

But Pikachu becoming so popular did fuck any chances of that going over smoothly. I wish that they would at least do an OVA series for the player characters like they did with the gen 2 protags.<br><br>That.</br></br></br>  <br> there will never be an anime arc where him and Yancy have a relationship like in the game <br><br>truly the biggest waste in pokemon in a long time, would had picked it up immediately.</br></br></br>  <br> Ash is a good character. <br>He's one of the worst characters in fiction.<br><br>  He doesn't exist for character development. The show doesn't exist for character development. <br>If that were true then they why do you always praise the pokegirls for having development?<br><br>  It exists for fun adventures and advertising. <br>Other shows existed for advertising and had development or at least not stale shit. It also doesnt help that it isnt fun at all.<br><br><br> The nice thing about Ash is that his performance is actually consistent with his skill level. <br>Yeah, he always sucks.<br><br>  then progressed gradually in each season and league (except BW). <br>He didnt, if he did, he wouldnt make the same mistakes and had actual progress.<br><br> Meanwhile Origins Red is a complete fucking idiot but just plot armors his way to victory. <br>Yeah, because electricity armor was the result of wonderful writing that was also consistent with the lore right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> enters skill-based competition he's never even heard of before <br> competition takes place in the same course every time, giving veterans with knowledge of it an obvious advantage <br> enters with a Pokemon that just learned to fly earlier that day <br> just barely loses to last year's winner <br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what a fucking loser</br>  <br>She's gotten so much fanart with Paras that she's become an honorary Pokémon character.<br><br> Yancy <br>The only reason to play a male character in BW2.

BW2 is also the most fun I've ever had playing Pokemon.</br>  <br>You are breaking my heart.</br>  Did Ash ever go back to visit his Pidgeot?  <br>no, but it's really close to pallet town so it probably comes visit professor oak every once in a while</br>  <br>Anon we must face reality, even if it hurts...<br><br> &gt;yfw nate and yancy would have had one last ride in the ferris wheel while they reach for each other's hand and embrace each other </br></br></br>  <br><br>I bet if we did that we would not have had the Gen3 drop</br></br>  I just want him to stop<br>All he is teaching is Hard work never pays off</br>  <br> thinking the Gen 3 drop happened because of anything related to the franchise <br><br>It happened because kids were growing up.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want him to have a happy ending... its that too much to ask?

I wouldn't get my hopes up for the naval warfare in war thunder either, as they'll certainly find a way to ruin it just like everything else<br>this is coming from a person with over 800 hours in the game.</br></br>      Bumping with more Maginot.<br> https://mega.co.nz/#!XUw02A4Q!9ND_x<wbr>9tYNs1gko6ykUr8H4SJEoh7cq-lKQircmv0<wbr>dw0</wbr></wbr> <br>The wiki's still being difficult, so if someone else wants to put this link there, that'd be helpful.</br></br>                          <br>And that's that.</br>  a bonus.  <br>Thanks, m8.</br>  <br> Uuh, sir, you appear to have a car wash stuck on your mudguards. </br>    Do your weekly quests!

E8 was, when all's said and done, just a standard 76mm A3 with a better suspension that gave it a more comfortable ride (the source of its very nickname). It had no better armor nor gun than other 76mm A3 Shermans. A Firefly had the same armor, comparable off-road performance (if you weren't a lazy ass who wanted your tank only for peacetime -with my respects for the 3rd Guards- and were willing to get where you wanted even if it wasn't a comfy ride), and a vastly superior gun.</br></br>  <br>It's among the best of the slav grinding games, but being the least smelly turd in the septic tank isn't much of an achievement.</br>    <br>What exactly is your point?<br>If you expect to me to care or be offended they still use a swastika...good luck.</br></br>  <br> still missing the point </br>  <br>Nigga, I am super drunk.<br>Just tell me your point please.</br></br>  <br>The Von Rosen Cross IS what the Finns call it, you tosspot!</br>  <br> if someone else wants to put this link there <br>done</br></br>  <br>they stole its machine gun.</br>  Why british girls are so hot and classy?

FREEDOM!   <br>I want to play dirty with Alisa.</br>  Not enough GUTS in this thread.  <br> Polish First Army Corps in USSR <br>Just Polish First Army in USSR.<br>But yeah, the markings are identical with those that were used after crossing the Vistula in January 1945.</br></br></br>  <br>The Firefly had god awful accuracy past 500 yards and both the 76 and 17pdr could do the same thing, penetrate a Tiger from the front but neither could engage Panthers directly. Only reason the Firefly has such a reputation was because it was in Normandy first. Crew comfort should always be high on your list for a tank, a cramped crew is an ineffective crew, making follow-up shots, target acquisition, and crew synergy worse.</br>  <br>Imagine tying her and  feeding her tomato sauce  instead</br>  <br>GUTS.</br>    <br>her eyes are so lewd they need to be concealed at all times</br>    <br>Truly a magnificent specimen.</br>  <br> tomato sauce <br> Not borsch </br></br>  <br>Over the line!</br>  <br>ayy</br>  <br>Anon, if you keep cherry-picking you'll make a fool of yourself.<br><br>The accuraccy problem of the 17-pounder was only with APDS ammo. Its "normal" APCBC ammo's accuraccy was perfectly fine. And even more, the greatly overstated "big accuraccy problem" of APDS meant only the guners had to just target center of mass instead of being able to aim for weak spots - not that they needed better with APDS, mind you.<br><br>Also, that "normal" ammo was the one whose power was comparable with a 76mm's scarce HVAP ammo. Both were the ones who had trouble with the Panther. However, the APDS ammo was perfectly able to deal with it.<br><br>Standard 76mm ammo was NOT able to deal with a Tiger, too (it was able to defeat only about 90mm at 500m - some sources ay 93, but that's still not enough). And HVAP ammo was not always available, as you should know.<br><br>So, if you want me to consider you as a serious scholar of the Sherman variants, instead of asuming you're just a so-called "shermanfag", please stop atributing the best characteristics of both kinds of M1 ammo AND the worst characteristics of both 17-pounder ammos AT THE SAME TIME. It's simply not working.<br><br> b-b-but muh crew comfort! muh synergy! muh easy ride! <br>They ammount to nothing in the face of greatly superior weaponry, Anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wehraboos <br>Won any world wars recently?</br></br>  <br><br>Thats not how volleyball works.</br></br>  <br>How is he wehraboo?<br>More like Britfag, if anything.</br></br>  Can anybody translate this crossover with "Fury"?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/812651/116abb<wbr>fba9/</wbr></br>  <br> only about 90mm at 500m <br><br>side armor of a Tiger was what again?</br></br></br>  <br> buzzbords <br>Learned any new one lately, m8?<br><br>Not even that.

It's hoped that people can connect with him better emotionally, and understand why Maeda made him the way it is <br> neither of the two visuals can be taken away from each other, and the connection between them isn't as simple as you think. The connection isn't something you can easily understand until the end of the story <br> the pacing of the show will pick up faster and faster. Maeda's emotional impacts will also hit hard. They'll put in extra efforts around parts designed to make you cry <br> Maeda is trying to create a very vivid world, and probably the strongest yet. Trying to pull the two worlds together is what he is trying to do <br> Most of the song lyrics is responsible by Maeda, and he has a very tight grip on the direction of the work <br> it's very difficult to see where the story is going at first, and it's hoped that you can stick with it to the very end. <br><br>Apparently some new information if anyone is interested.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man this is sounding pretentious. Looks like it's going the same route as Angel Beats and will try to do too many things and ultimately fall short of all of them.  <br> &gt;the two visuals released was not meant to spoil the story, but rather to better lead the audience into the main story <br><br>So I guess they all were once rat labs.</br></br></br>   &gt;it's very difficult to see where the story is going at first, and it's hoped that you can stick with it to the very end. <br><br>God, this is gonna be hilarious.

Hope he learns something like "Madoka Magica x Katawa Shoujo" in terms of invest time getting attached to the characters and the emotional impact comes from the plot advance rather than other source.</br></br></br>   Hey can you help me with this math problem? <br> Oh for this you do this and this. <br> Oh wow the way you explained it was so simple even I understood!

The preview for the 32nd issue teases, "What is the dream that Sarada has obtained now that she has passed her graduation exam!?"
