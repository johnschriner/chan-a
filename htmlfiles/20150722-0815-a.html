Censored and uncensored of the first episode but still cannot find the cock a doodle dick translation.  <br>Senketsu + RAW<br><br>unless you are using VLC in which case you deserve your suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>What should I watch with instead of VLC?</br>  <br><br> comedy <br> isn't funny <br><br>Is anime becoming hollywood?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm in a good mood: http://haruhichan.com/forum/showthr<wbr>ead.php?7545-KCP-Kawaii-Codec-Pack</wbr></br>  <br>Use media player classic when this is installed: </br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons. Maybe this will fix the weird high pitch noise I get sometimes when e.g. clothing rustling, some voices starting.</br></br></br>  <br> Kajou is actually a likable character who isn't a slut, nor a hypocrite, and has a very positive, healthy outlook on sex as more than just bumping uglies </br>  <br>no, you just hate actual fun</br>  <br>Is Gouriki a 45 year old in disguise?</br>  Not really.<br>Just meh.</br>  How does goriki not get expelled for his constant violent screaming outbursts<br>I'd be terrified to be in school with him</br>  <br>Nope, prison school is way more funnier than this shit. I like both of them though.</br>  No, it's good but Wakaba girl has better comedy  So Funi's double censor rip is the only choice for this show?  <br><br>Ah, ended up not fixing it. Guess that problem is elsewhere. <br><br>Also getting some frame jitter. Any idea how to fix that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you select to high on the performance question?</br>  <br>I'm surprised, I actually like it more with each episode.</br>  <br> glasses a shit <br>Nice homosexuality anon.</br></br>  <br>I liked this part.</br>  <br>It was either medium or high, don't remember lol.<br><br>Actually it seems like the stuttering only happens when my current window is something else, so probably just not allocating enough resources.</br></br></br>  <br>High settings use a lot of resources try lowering the setting.</br>  <br>4U</br>  <br>Yeah I'll do that. My pleb eyes probably aren't gonna notice any upscaling interpolation differences anyway.</br>  <br>RIP that pool</br>  <br>Ya I was pretty shocked by that as well.</br>  <br>She is a bit, but she's hot and hilarious, so it's ok, particularly on account of being hot. Doesn't work as well for that Charlotte bitch.</br>  <br>Feminism.</br>  <br>Wait, is there an uncensored version? Am I an even bigger faggot than I had thought for using HorribleSubs?</br>  <br>Hiryuu seems to release 4-5 days after airing, if you want to wait.</br>  Why's J.C. Staff so lewd lately?  <br>where is the gunkata then? chekmate atheist</br>  Isnt it hilarious how a show about censoring got censored to hell and back?   'you need to be this japanese to understand'-puns <br> lol sex, dirty jokes, sex lol, did i mentioned SEX???? <br><br> funny <br><br>Are there only 13 year old virgins on this board?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a moment I thought I was in a seitokai yakuindomo thread.</br>    How do I know if a subbed torrent uses either the censored or the less censored version?  <br>I didn't know SZS was for thirteen-year-olds. Hang on a sec, I'll go kill myself.</br>  <br>Those who rip from streaming sites like HS are usually censored.</br>  <br>You can literally hear the wordplay yourself like 3/4ths of the time, I have no idea why people have problems with shows that do this</br>    <br>It's not really a problem here, but half the jokes in the SYD manga went right over my head. Luckily, the puns weren't what I was reading for, anyway.</br>  <br>Cock-a-doodle-pussy -- doesn't sound natural<br><br>Cock-a-doodle-dick -- better, but you lost the pussy reference.<br><br>Maybe it should be Cunt-a-doodle-dick, but cunt sounds much ruder than pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Either way. I have an incredibly uncivilized desire to wear some panties on my face. I might go get a pair and answer the door in them. We get a lot of mormons.</br>  <br>Cock a doo vagoo?</br>  <br>Prison school</br>  <br>I want to fuck her in her normal school girl form while she wears her delectable glasses and is being lecherous.<br>She really turns me on in that state!</br></br>  <br>too much lowbrow americanized humor in this show</br>  <br>Muffa doodle dick</br>  <br>Great since "vagoo" comes from censorship itself, but I think it's just a meme, not used IRL<br><br>"Cock-a-doo-vagOOO" works in subs but only subs cause you wonder what she said.</br></br></br>  <br>Penes pichulas y sapos hediondos.</br>    How long til the pussy cookies?  <br> pussy cookies <br>This requires further explanation.</br></br>  <br>no it really doesn't</br>  <br><br> judging from CD only <br>just gtfo</br></br></br>  The sex jokes are something I would hear a grade school spew out. Simply replacing words in a regular sentence with sex related terms and screaming sex related stuff at the top of your lungs isn't my idea of funny, in fact it's obnoxious and juvenile<br><br> I bet your humor must be so mature <br><br>No, sex humor can be funny if it's done correctly. I think this anime handles it poorly to the point it's exasperating and hard to watch.<br><br>I'm going to have to strongly disagree with you, OP but I'm rather surprised and a bit disappointed at the fact many will agree with you. As disappointing as this anime is I still can't drop it out of morbid curiosity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Shit, this is a comedy? Why is it so unfunny then?</br>  <br>because your a humorless cunt?</br>   penis penis vagina vagina <br> best comedy of the season <br>Looks like this season is fucked</br></br>  <br>man the fuck up and drop it if you don't like it faggot. no one is holding a gun to your head and making you watch it. don't be a bitch.</br>  <br>Because I don't laugh when you put dick and vagina in a sentence? God, it must be sad watching the same shit for 12 episodes and pretending joke is funny after 100'th time.</br>  <br> not having a hearty laugh while fapping <br>2sad4me</br></br>  <br>Oh wow you've changed my mind you so nailed down what it's all about just dick and vagina jokes......oh wait IT FUCKING isn't. I don't think you've watched it at all. Why don't you go fucking work for a shit site like ANN you sound like one of those pretentious "highbrow" twats.</br>  It's a bit early to tell, but with all the shitposting going on in these threads, this show is looking a strong contender for AOTS  Actually what makes me laugh is the behaviour of chertain character rather than the sex jokes themselves  <br>Fapping to what? Literally everything is censored.</br>  <br><br>Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime, funny man. Besides I'm still interested in some scenes I've seen in LN and manga screen captures. I also hear there's drama from one poster but it may be just a rumor. I don't see this kind of series getting serious though.<br><br><br>Disagreeing =! shitposting. OP asked that to /a/ as collective if they agreed which means fans of the series and not. This isn't a circlejerk thread is it?<br><br><br>Laugh while fapping to someone yelling expletives? I don't find this sexually appealing but whatever floats your boat, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's basically all it has to offer when it comes to shit that hasn't been done may times in bad comedies, so yeah, it's all about terrible sex jokes. Besides, why do you sound so offended? Is Ayame you new waifu or something?</br>  <br> Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime <br>How much of a faggot can you be<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for proving my point even further. I'll leave you with this out of fear I may be responding to bait at this point, funny man.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br><br>which was the point I made and why his obvious posts aren't worth responding to anymore.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br>Why would you give a shit about that faggot, more so since it types like hes a MALtard. In-fact, why are you even giving the fuckwit the attention he wants? The anon I was replying to is a obvious crossborder, and should fuck off</br>  Op here. I just have to say I am severely disappointed about all this senseless drama and the even more alarming lack of lewd screen caps.  DUDE SEX LMAO<br>Yeah, comedy gold right here</br>   still no Hiryuu   <br>Yes you're right. <br><br>The correct answer is Chaos Dragon. It's shitty it's hilarious</br></br></br>    <br> those crotch shot scenes. <br>the ugly sleep deprived bags under her eyes<br>Why is this so fucking hot?</br></br></br>  <br> The sex jokes are something I would hear a grade school spew out. <br><br>You do realize that's exactly the point right? Or you're too much of a retarded faggot to notice?<br> That time comedy LN was 2deep4u </br></br></br></br>  <br>I would really love to satisfy her curiosity</br>  <br> You do realize that's exactly the point right <br>How does it change anything he said?<br>It's still boring cringe garbage</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128382566 <br>Oh hello, worst tripfag. It's no surprise that your taste a shit as always</br>  <br>Too bad you're the one with shit taste here this time</br>  <br>Yeah yeah your favorite anime is shit I know, I know</br>  <br>Yes!<br>Thanks our based god that gave Charlotte to people with wicked and mature sense of humor like us!</br></br>  <br>what a bitch.</br>  <br> strawmanning this hard </br>  <br>What does Chatlotte have to do with this?<br>You're getting desperate at defending this shit</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381765 <br> &gt;o noes my poor bitch faggot eyes are hurt by the naughty words </br>  so many sad people in this thread  <br>More like on this board<br>No one here likes pepe and feels even though they're so much fun.</br></br>  <br>I don't watch this serie, but CUNT A DICKLE DOO</br>  <br>so many underage people in this thread</br>  <br>seriously what's up with this meme pool?<br>I see it in every other anime that takes place in tokyo</br></br>  <br>Today's morning edition</br>  <br>it can't hold a candle to prison school though</br>  <br>You mean Light-ray School</br>  <br>even in light-ray mode it's way superior</br>  looks kinda hot, i'll just wait till the doujins come out though  Seriously how braindead are you people that you find a girl shouting "SEX SEX PENIS PENIS" funny? The comedy in this anime is targeted at retards, cant believe people are hyping this shit up.  <br>I like it even though i usually stay away from these kinds of shows, maybe.</br>  <br>Is this show actually censored? I thought that was the whole joke that they put censors over everything.</br>  She pretty much carries this  <br>What's wrong with her belly?</br>  <br>It's the japanese porn pool. Kinda the equivalent to this thing.</br>  <br>absolutely nothing</br>  I didn't get what the mirror truck was  <br>used for 'public' fucking</br>  just give me the lewd webms of Kajou already  <br>Instead of gunkata they use lewdkata.</br>  <br>iku iku</br>  <br>I'll watching this for the lewd slav president. I hope it's worth it.</br>  <br>Love honey anon</br>  I'm hyped for the next episode even just because of the cookie scene  <br>I don't find it funny, its dumb. What I do find funny is the setting and how awful it is.</br>    <br>I can get behind that. I've been looking forward to more episodes of it than anything else even. Really the premise is just spot on. I can't see anyone fucking this up so it should be a bunch of fun.</br>   people unironically like this trash <br><br>Explain yourselves.</br></br>  <br> Matsuki Miyu and Arai Satomi in one anime both voicing cock hungry sluts <br> not one of the best anime of the season </br></br>  <br> Targeted towards teen audience <br> Implying 13 year olds aren't teens </br></br>  <br> implying all the teens are 13yo </br>  <br>Like Fafner?</br>  <br>Navel, anon. The navel.</br>   Going from 451 to 1984 <br>rip brave new world, i will always love ya ;-;</br>  <br>Her voice turns me on I must be a faggot.</br>  <br>oh crap I meant Saotome. Why am I this much of a faggot.</br>  <br>Kajou's voice is pretty good too.</br>  <br><br>She's a good girl and I love her but the slut act is getting old, same for the non-stop dirty jokes.<br><br>Everybody has their flaws, but perhaps a good dicking would make her calm down a bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Her tiny body turns me on.</br></br></br>  <br>who /iku iku/ here?</br>  <br><br><br>She is literally one of the best girl of this year.</br></br></br>  <br>She's sleep deprived from staying up all night thinking about Okuma's scent.</br>   ctrl + F <br> no Gintama <br><br>This shit isn't really funny but it is entertaining. Gintama is automatically the best comedy of the season by default and your opinion is null.</br></br></br>  <br>Fun things are fun, anon.</br>  <br>if you are from /b/</br>  <br><br>Shimoneta is far more /b/ than Gintama.</br></br>    <br>You know you can use .ass with raws on VLC right?</br>  <br>I'll lead the way<br><br>have fun feget</br></br></br>  <br>What mango is this<br>I can't find anything with google or iqdb</br></br>  <br><br><br> shitposting about GIntama  <br><br>Thought I would never see the day. /a/ is pretty dead. Too much new to save it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what's the matter, can't take the heat?</br>  <br>she's all talk, as soon as it came to taking a dick she'd get all pure maiden</br>  <br>What a bummer, dosen't even have conviction behind her actions.</br>  <br>Her "conviction" is that she thinks sex jokes are funny. You don't have to actually want to have sex to joke about it, just like you don't have to actually want to murder babies to think dead baby jokes are funny.</br>  <br> Explain the funny <br>Implying that doesnt ruin the joke its funny that you think people think this part of the show is funny what she says doesnt matter its the premise thats hilarious saying this in another setting would be idiotic.</br></br>  <br>This is one step away from going full PP anyway, why not go the extra limb and go freedom fighter</br>  <br><br>She totally doesn't, a shame I didn't save that picture of her blushing and averting her eyes from Tanukichi's raging boner.</br></br>  <br>because 3DPD.</br>  This is literally the Family Guy of anime.  <br><br>Why is Kajo so unsexy?</br></br>  <br>Do you prefer formal Kajo?</br>  <br><br>She's top grade hand-holding material trying to forcefully act as a huge slut, this consumes all of her sex appeal.<br><br>Hence why she's at her best when using long skirt, braided hair and megane, it all enhances her inner pure waifuness.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I would also like to know where this is from for reasons.</br></br>   you will never make dirty jokes with your 2D waifu   And the silver hair girl is a pure slut that can take 10 dicks at once made pure by sheer ignorance.<br>Impressive.</br>  <br>I guess if you are 10.</br>  <br>if you like trash like seitokai yakuindomo, then this is your kind of show.</br>  <br>I know it's only a few episodes in, but I already find this a lot less repetitive than SYD (which I still enjoyed). It's really well-made, too. You can tell the whole staff had a lot of fun.</br>  <br> Formal Kajo <br>Thar formal design was tainted, and not so pure now.</br></br>  <br>Where is this from.</br>  <br>she looks fat</br>  <br>Busty, healthy girl.</br>  <br>where the fuck did that condom come from?<br>Wasn't that a pen at first?</br></br>  <br>Edit by a separate request.  It's a lot better, don't you think? </br>  <br><br><br>That looks like something Noise would draw</br></br></br>    I really like the character designs in a non-sexual way.  <br>It's not so much funny as it is absurd</br>  <br> BENIS BENIS XDD <br>fucking dropped after ep 3. Prison School is fucking superior than this trash.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Censorship School</br></br>  im just waiting for her to be unleashed, is it in next ep?  <br>Censored or not, Prison School cast is still more enjoyable to watch and looks better.</br>  <br>So a show that has been running for 13 seasons and probably is older then you are by 3/4ths and is loved by millions and only hated by people who hate it ironically?<br><br>That is a pretty nice compliment anon.</br></br></br>  <br> not reading the manga <br>the fuck is wrong with you?<br>shonen benis crap &lt; bros before hoes</br></br></br>  <br> Comparing a manga to a light novel adaptation anime </br>  This turns me on.  <br>Here are 3 hints<br> <br> Anna <br> love juices <br> cookies </br></br></br> </br></br>   yfw Otome's voice   <br>Spoilers dont work like id think on clover.</br>  <br><br> everything is fine until i hear the midgets gremlin voice <br><br>holy fuck worst fucking choice ever made for a va.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the benis benis is the worst part of the show<br> implying that's the only thing about the show <br> unironically using XD <br>Leave.</br></br></br></br>  <br> holy fuck worst fucking choice ever made for a va. <br><br>just get out</br></br></br>  <br>YOU<br><br>SILLY<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>WILLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kajo is best female lead of the season easily<br><br>And Shimon is probably going to end as AOTS</br></br>   DUDE SEX JOKES LMAO <br><br>Go watch American Pie.</br></br>  <br>Love honey.</br>  <br>So Goriki loves MC?</br>  <br>No. He loves Big, busty, and pure. Along with everyone else. She has several stalkers including the male MC.</br>  <br> DUDE I HATE ON POPULAR THINGS LMAO AM I /a/ NOW GUYS </br>  Can we expect Hiryuu today, or just say fuck it and use one of the HS + uncensored versions?   leglocking a leg <br> Edit when? </br>    <br>It can't. Even if Kyoani started setting all their series in exotic locales so they can basically take company subsidized vacations as "image scouting" trips, the fact that it's animated means they'd still have to do more real work than Adam Sandler.</br>  <br> not watching for the pure girl becoming more and more lewd aspect <br>Ishygddtlt.</br></br>  <br>Are there more of these? Is there one for the image of Fuwa in the credits?</br>  <br>Yes and it will grow as the cast does.</br>        <br> editing out the bags <br>as expected of the trogs that do 'bubble art'</br></br>  <br>Wtf is this garbage?</br>  <br>The smugness in this show is bordering parody.</br>  Nobody mentioning the Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Where the hell is Hiryuu?  <br>Shimoneta has the deepest lore.</br>  <br><br><br>I want to impregnate her.</br></br></br>  <br>Before or after explaining to her that cumming inside makes her pregnant?</br>  <br>Does she like penis?<br><br>I mean she seems horny and sex craving, but she makes jokes all the god damn time so I can't take her seriously. So she's straight or not?</br></br></br>  <br>While watching flies engage in cunnilingus or no?</br>  <br><br>I'd rather not explain it to her so she can tell me after she gives birth she needs to repeat the process a few more times in order to understand the process and review any variables she may have missed.</br></br>  <br>She's pure and is using being lewd as a cover up for being so pure</br>  <br><br>YOU BASTARDS! YOU BLEW IT UP! DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!</br></br>  <br>I think she is straight but also WATAMOTEWEEST when directly confronted by her feeling for MC she is going to turn out to be hesitant and a prude. Most likely jealous of his love for Anna. She likes to crack jokes and has a dirty mind but I think it is an act.<br><br>Maybe.</br></br></br>  <br> her views on sex <br>Makes me want to  grab her hands, do her in missionary position and maintain eye contact while at it. Maybe some kissing, too. </br></br>  <br>Going by this illustration and the show's OP, it seems like she's just shy against actual face-to-face sexuality. She threw a bag at the MC upon seeing his morning wood, but then playfully measured his dick on the way to school.<br><br>Kajo is a pure girl who loves to say dirty things.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jyk<wbr>AcrxAl3Q</wbr>  [ ]  <br>what a strange figure.<br>I've never found masturbating in the shower particularly enjoyable</br></br>  <br>Wait, hold up a sec. Who's that woman on the right of your picture?</br>  <br>It's probably the place with absolute loneliness in a standard japanese house.</br>  <br>I thought the place of absolute loneliness in standard Japanese household was the Japanese household.</br>  <br>Oddly enough I could never actually cum while in the shower, so trying to fap in there always became an hour long affair, and at some point I'd just quit because I wasting water.<br><br><br>Do the japs moan or some shit when they jerk off? I don't know how anyone gets through puberty with out mastering the silent fap.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also it's easier to cleanup afterwards</br></br>  <br>She is pure and probably very shy and vanilla sexually. She masks this with her outward perversion.<br><br>Anna, on the other hand, is a horny tart hiding behind an uptight, prude persona. She's the definition of lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets.</br></br></br>  Somewhere amongst the hundreds of people even the slightest bit involved in Shimoneta's production is at least one person who worked on Hen Zemi.  <br> 'public' fucking <br>Literally what.</br></br>  <br> shower fap <br>Holy shit I thought I was the only one. Maybe it is just a comfort thing. I am usually sitting while fapping and standing makes it too difficult to get "in the zone". Also cannot fap without boxers on. Without that pressure around my waist I just shut down sexually.</br></br>  <br>one-way mirrors</br>  <br>Jap doors don't have locks on them because you're "supposed to be considerate to others"<br><br>Nips are stupid</br></br></br>  <br> Without that pressure around my waist I just shut down sexually. <br>Oh wow...</br></br>  <br>You can't actually video tape some one having sex in public, so they use two way mirrors to create the illusion. It's an exhibitionism/voyeurism thing.</br>  <br>How it proves glasses a shit? You're talking nonsense...</br>  <br>Becomes more natural if you do it repeatedly.</br>  <br><br>A girl who's forced to be pure isn't as pure as a girl with the option to be a slut who is pure anyway.<br><br>Kajo only fights for the option to be a slut, and in not being one herself is the purest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah basically<br>its like, sure you could tug it for an hour and a half but it doesnt even feel that good and you'd never get to the point of orgasm<br><br>it only makes sense in that those neck devises might not be fully waterproof so they'd be able to be turned off in the shower, or otherwise not function.<br><br>deepest lore.<br><br><br>the boxer thing seems weird, good luck with that, really rooting for you though if you ever get a chance to strut that you dont just flop down after removing them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Woah that's kind of fucked up</br></br>  LN translation when?  <br>You mean pretty hot.</br>  <br>Although I do fap in the showers, and find it pretty easy to do so, I completely with you on the boxers thing.<br>Even fapping with boxers and shorts/pants on gets me off like nothing else. I've even started to pinch the tip a bit while I do it also, which probably isn't very good for me, but fuck, it feels pretty good.<br>I can't really explain why that is to be honest, but if anyone plans on doing it, finish in the toilet, I don't think I have to explain why.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> http://exhentai.org/g/718829/254ea3<wbr>1bee/</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>Great taste.</br>  The sound effects are 70% of the fun of these interactions.  <br>Goriki saw MC in drag and is now confused due to unreleased sexual tension and no understanding of his own sexuality</br>  That OHOHOHO is just golden.<br>I also really liked the ED</br>  <br>based as fuck my friend.</br>  <br> A girl who's forced to be pure isn't as pure as a girl with the option to be a slut who is pure anyway. <br>Not necessarily as pure but she could be. Kajo isn't really pure but she's definitely not a slut. I was more contrasting the inner/outer personas, not judging for purity.</br></br>  <br>gintama has always had shitposters, weeaboos, and tryhards.</br>  <br>I was more applying sophistry for the purpose of humor than as a legitimate statement.<br><br>I actually felt physical pain just typing the word "pure" that many times.</br></br></br>  which subs should i consider?

Leave this thread.</br></br>  Though most is surely bait, the few critics who say "hurr durr the jokes are just grade school humour" need to consider the setting. Yes these are high school students (protag being 1st year) but they literally never heard words like penis and vagina. The critics may have had their fill but to the characters these words are new. Point being the vulgarity is not the whole joke, penis penis penis penis penis is just the setup and the punchline is the reaction by the characters. You guys are missing the forest for the trees, shit's hillarious.  <br>And you're a faggot who didn't watch the episode</br>  <br>No I have shit internet so downloading episodes is a bit of a gamble each time, basically no matter how I set it up my whole net shuts down when I torrent so I can't do anything but torrent at 200 kilobytes a second.</br>  <br>Gorillia doesn't want his dick.

He obviously can't fit in the bed. Also Brooke is tall as fuck doubt he fits into these things too.  <br>At least your waifu isn't Conis.</br>  <br>I don't even know if Brook sleeps.<br><br>Franky probably built himself some sort of amazing secret room.</br></br></br>  <br>Brook can take his head off</br>  <br>Meh<br>He's better than anyone else so far. He's too much of a one trick pony. I do want to see him go sailing with the whole crew it'd be interesting for a small time.</br></br>  <br>Make me, nerd</br>  <br>He sleeps at a 45 degree angle</br>  <br>god damn I wanna see it</br>  Why does everyone think just because Mingos awakened fruit made him able to manipulate the environment that Luffys awakened fruit will be able to do the same?<br><br>Like I mean look at Kuma, I'm pretty sure the guy has awakened his fruit, since he can do a lot of DIFFERENT things with his fruit, it is kind of versatile.<br><br>There will be the argument that the impel down Zoans all had the same type of awakening - They had faster regenenartion and where able to take way more damage. To me it could either be that Oda did not want to show too much of what an awakened fruit could do, or maybe because fruits might share some common attributes when awakened - like Zoans in general getting more tanky, but they will still have different power ups on some aspects. <br><br><br>What are peoples thought on this? This is my own speculation though, and it might be totally wrong. I just think Kuma might be an awakened fruit user as his fruit seems rather odd, even for a paramecia. Though Vegapunk might had something to do with this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, Kuma's fruit seems 'weird'. Awakening probably has a lot more than we know about right now, I doubt it only stops to simple environent manipulation</br>  <br>environment*</br>  <br>where do the guys even masturbate? they only have a public bath, too</br>  Why is there a break?<br><br>Is the break for all shounen manga?<br><br>I'm panicing over here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OP has been taking lots of hiatuses, are you new or something?</br>  <br>Sanji masturbates in the kitchen<br>Zoro in the weight room<br>Luffy isn't sexual<br>Ussop and Franky both have personal rooms they can go and yank it in<br>Brooke doesn't have a penis<br>Chopper is a forever little kid so no boners.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People think that because Mingo said that - he didn't say 'my' fruit, he generalized DFs.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, the Impel Down beasts were probably WG experiments that achieved Awakening through artificial means, like Chopper turns into Monster Chopper thru drugs.<br><br>Their awakened abilities were extremely limited and being stuck in retarded beast mode could be a negative side effect of being forced to Awaken at such a weak level of mastery.</br></br></br>  <br>Stitches use strings too. The string-string fruit and the stitch-stitch are really really similar. It would've been boring.</br>  <br>Sanji masturbates into the women's food and spits in the men's.</br>  <br>Sanji doesn't hate men. He just hates Zoro.</br>  <br>In the Drum Island arc he admitted to feeding rotten food to the men of the ship.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure he doesn't hate Zoro either - it's a rivalry thing and they have been shown to respect eachother.<br><br>He just holds men in worse regard - e.g. when Nami got ill he said he has always given the women the fresh food.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji is a creep but I don't think he's that creepy he also has too much respect as a chef to do those things. Going into the girl's room when they're gone and jerking off I would guess is more his style.</br>  <br>Which was still good and tasty. And never got anyone sick. It just means he doesn't waste food, which is one of his main principles.<br><br><br>Dude put razor blades in Zoro's lunchbox in PH. Not Luffy's, who went to the Women's Island, who Sanji thinks trained with women for 2 whole years, but Zoro. Who spent 2 years training on a lonely dark Island with his biggest target and one other girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With Luffy on board I doubt food has a chance to turn he just gives Nami and Robin the best of it.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a love-hate relationship.<br><br>I think W7 and TB showed that well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Going into the girl's room when they're gone and jerking off I would guess is more his style. <br>I don't even think he'd do that either. He'd probably find it disrespectful.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you two forget Sanji's backstory ? You really think he was going to throw away spoiling food after the shit he went through ? Please.</br></br>  <br><br>No, I never said anything towards that.</br></br>  <br>It's more Hate than Love. I think we can all agree with that much.</br>  <br>The only devil fruit he would eat would be the Suke Suke no Mi (the invisibility one). So he can be the ultimate peeping tom I doubt that's beneath him.</br>  <br>So why did people point that out when the guy said 'Sanji doesn't hate men' ?</br>  <br>Not that anon but I don't think he hates Zoro at all. It's just a superficial kind of dislike, underneath I think they both care.</br>  <br><br>Because it shows he holds them in less regard? <br><br>It's not to say he would throw the spoiled food out, but it is implied he doesn't give them any of it when it is fresh apparently.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh right, forgot about that. <br>Man, I can't find it in my heart to hate Sanji but he can be real gross.</br></br>  <br>Hate, no. Rivalry, yes. They're nakama and it's normal.</br>  <br>Obviously he holds them in less regard. He puts Nami and Robin on a pedestal. He think they're angels, divine beings. Men are the opposite to women, so obviously he's not gonna think the same about them. That's not to say he hates them.<br><br><br>Thriller Bark will be the greatest reminded to that. What a scene.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was never saying he hates them, you responded to me.</br></br>  <br>I responded to whoever responded to my initial post. It's a bit hard to say who you are with the whole anonymous deal. I'm sorry.</br>  <br><br>I responded to your initial post.</br></br>  <br>He lived on a boat packed full of men all his life. Every girl he's hit on has rejected him. Now he's living on a boat with 2 very beautiful women. He could be even more of a creep.</br>  Friendly reminder Sanji is now stronger than Rufy.  <br><br>Never mind he had to spend 2 years on an island running from Okamas who wanted to molest him.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Here. I'm not sure if it's clear enough to show how he sleeps, but at least we know it's in the men's quarters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're <br>Gotcha.<br><br><br>He seemed to be doing pretty well in Baratie. I'm not entirely sure he fell for Nami more than Fullbody's girlfriend but personal preference, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and he can't even brag about being a famous pirate because of this picture. Sanji's life is pretty rough.</br>  <br><br>First Nami &amp; Robin were best.<br>The new models are for retards to enjoy.</br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean ? It looks just like him.</br>  <br>Brook's VA fucking killed it in that scene,</br>  <br>When you hit perfection you can only go down.</br>  <br><br>nostalgiafags please, just let it go already</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't give a shit I like both, POST MORE ROBIN</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.

This has been discussed to death. For one they are completely different types of paramecia and it would be a complete change to Luffys fighting style, which was the same for the start.</br>  <br>Bah, I honestly didn't mind that much until Usopp's Haki episode. The amount of slideshow-ing on that episode just sealed the deal for me. And the scenes always look zoomed in for some reason. But, let's be fair, they do Soundtracks really well too.

He wanted him to team up.<br><br><br>He could have went full smoker on croc if he wanted to. He seems to have a thing for croc for some reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>whatever final powerup he gets it'll look ridiculous as fuck and people will get mad. especially wano babbies. especially them.</br>  <br>There has to be other ways in and out. Mihawk got through on a little dingy. People sail back and forth all the time.</br>  <br>Unlikely: Crocodile's gained a lot of skill since Alabasta, and his hook's now way stronger. Even at Marineford he was already Doflamingo's equal.<br><br>EG: In Alabasta, Luffy breaks Crocodile's hook.<br>In Marineford, Mihawk can't break it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't "the other side" the new world?</br>  <br> equal <br><br>where did you get that from Doflamingo didn't even use haki in the string. He sat on jozu and asked him to join. Stop croc masturbating</br></br></br>  <br>no that was just the grandline<br><br>The new world is the part past the grandline AND the redline.</br></br></br>  crew is still to big.<br>sanji, franky and brooks should just die.</br>  <br>the 5 man crew was the best.<br><br>Sanji, Zoro, Nami, Luffy, Ussop. I miss those times so much.</br></br></br>  <br>*too<br>also, Franky is the only reason they even made it to the New World</br></br>  <br>I think you're mixing some stuff up. The new world is part of the grand line. You go around until you hit the red line opposite to where you started, and once you cross the red line you're in the new world. Which is just the other half of the grand line.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128390777 <br>2manly4u</br>  <br>Yes, what I'm asking is, since Raftel is the final island why not just enter it from the "end" and go straight to Raftel?</br>  <br>I suggest you kill yourself first</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I like Senor, but his backstory sucks balls.</br>  <br>That's what I said. It's grand line AND the redline. This part is just referring to them crossing into the grand line which was a big thing back then for their powerlevel</br>  <br>no</br>  <br> brooks <br>where do you fucks who get his name always wrong come from?</br></br>  <br>bleach threads</br>  <br>I dont know why, but that shit got me. It was a nice way to tie in his quirk too. Best love story to come out of Dressrosa.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128390777 <br> character development <br>Based gOda</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy.</br>  <br>this</br>  Post your face when Sanji outs himself as an okama and leaves the SH out of shame, before falling into prostitution and being picked up by the Heart Pirates as a the crew's official bicycle.  <br>That's not character development. Senor's character hadn't changed, we only saw the explanation about baby's clothes. And we didn't even need that because there are plenty of weirdos in One Piece and we're used to that kind of shit.</br>    <br> Post your face when Sanji outs himself as an okama and leaves the SH out of shame <br>Here you go</br></br>  <br> And we didn't even need that <br>yes we did since whe saw him looking completely different in the flashback, an explanation for his drastic change was needed</br></br>  <br>I'll refrain from posting post your face when posts from now on.</br>  <br>Senior Pink did develop during his fight with Franky as shown when he slams Franky on his front despite knowing Franky's back is his weakness.<br>It's not long, drawn out, character development, but it still counts as long as you accept that without the bond made Pink would have wrecked Franky.</br></br>  <br>Come on. Do we also need an explanation about why Monet didn't have bird body parts in her flashbacks?</br>  <br> that transparency mistake at the very last second </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't because it's obvious that Law gave them to her. Señor Pink on the other hand was a complete mystery up till that point.</br>  <br> seems to have a thing for croc for some reason <br>Doffy probably has a thing for everyone who's hot.<br><br>Gross. Law/Sanji is gross. There's no way Sanji's good enough for him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can. You can also enter through the calm belt.<br>You won't find Raftel without the talisman though.<br>Otherwise Doffy would have found it.</br></br></br>  <br> the calm bait </br>  I think it is cool how Oda foreshadowed Gura Gura being stolen, as well as "devil fruit hunting" of the Blackbeard pirates and strange how BB must have gained this knowledge from the WG.  Is Oda taking a break or are we getting chapter 795 as normal?  <br>Break. You should read the new chapter, anon.</br>  <br>if hes so smart how come he doesnt open door to raftel</br>  <br>He still has to overcome IRL obstacles such as weather and topography. His ability only allows him to escape to a paralel dimension to the OP dimension, in which everything is the same, exept there are no living creatures. It's not a portal.</br>  <br>What if the "whole eat two fruits become kill" is just a lie created by the WG to keep people from eating multiple fruits and powercreeping? Has there ever been a recorded attempt in OP where someone DID eat two fruits and died?</br>  <br>Too much of a conspiracy. People like Doffy would know the truth and exploit it.</br>  <br> yfw luffy eats a second fruit and doesnt explode </br>  Sakazuki = Sake Ritual (That Ace,Luffy and Sabo took part in.)<br><br> Sabo finds 'Sakazuki kills Ace' in the newspapers <br> His memory is jogged <br><br>GODA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People with the D can eat more, but nobody else.</br>  <br>Everyone eating multiple fruits and fucking with the devil fruit supply would probably drive the underground market fucking bonkers.</br>  <br><br>The caffeine in his cola keeps him up all night</br></br>  <br><br>I want to see Heavy Point and/or Monster Point in that outfit</br></br>  <br>gear 5</br>  <br> Sakazuki = Sake Ritual <br>I hate retards like you</br></br>  <br>on the topic of stupid transformations, remember when people thought this is what Gear 4th would be?</br>  <br>Why doesn't Franky just Coup de Burst to Raftel?</br>  <br>It's not because Crocodile has gotten stronger, it's because Crocodiles fighting style is just "different" from what we've come to expect from powerful people in One Piece, hence why he lost against Luffy in Alabasta, but seemed stronger at Marineford<br><br>The reason Crocodile has always been so powerful, the reason he was a Shichubukai, and the reason he was on Level 6 of Impel Down was because he's on par with the Admirals for control of his Devil Fruit, meaning you have to have God-tier mastery of Haki to touch him<br><br>Of course the catch is, once you do have that kind of mastery of Haki, or Crocodile's weakness, water, Crocodile is pretty screwed, hence why he was beat by Luffy in Alabasta<br><br>But if you don't know about his weakness against water, or you aren't a God of Haki like the Yonko or the Admirals, you're gonna have a bad time against Crocodile</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That thing is retarded to a whole new level of retardation.</br>  <br>BB can have multiple powers thanks to some weird condition of his body, Marco stated something like this. Anyone but BB will just die.</br>  <br>yep, 2 days after Gear 4th was shown off, I decided to see if this was still the most popular one on google images, if I remember there was a little over a page</br>  <br> akuma <br> rage face <br> all this edginess <br><br>American weeaboos are nothing but cancer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's pointless and not fun you freaking autist.</br>  <br>because that mountain is tall, you could slip and hurt yourself while climbing down.</br>  <br>it's probably not that easy to get to raftel for some reason we don't know yet</br>  <br>Its funny how bad it is<br> Post yfw you remembered that people used to agree that this could be a possibility </br></br>  <br>A complete Mr Fantastic rip-off. <br>Wrapping himself around opponents and pulling himself tightly. Then he launches long to execute attacks, that would normally be just dodged while his opponent is immobilised. <br>His awakening should cover this.</br></br></br>  <br>Because you will not find Raftel, just a bunch of sea everywhere, Raftel can only be reached by a log pose who point directly to the island.</br>  <br>So you could go on the island juste before and then Raftel ?</br>  <br>Reverse mode? Something like Lucci's Seimei Kikan, Luffy remain in base mode but can use every gear at will and can unlock unlimited stretching.</br>  <br>It can take years for a pose to set</br>  <br>And how do you do that? You literally can't navigate the sea if you don't have a log pose pointing where to go. That's the whole fucking point of why you start the journey from Twin Cape.</br>   Isn't even the bad boy of the marines anymore since Fuji <br> Lost to Doffy who Luffy then beat <br><br>Should he even be allowed to remain in the new world?<br>"Garp to Luffy's Roger" they said.<br><br>You don't think he'll be allowed to continue chasing the SH do you?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've always said that Coby was the 'Garp' to Luffy's Roger. The amount of evidence is just overwhelming - the same Bogart and actually being /trained/ by Garp.<br><br>Smoker can go and make love to Tashigi in Paradise. He's earned the break, even if he's not too strong anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>The very same problem, take into account OP earth is probably way bigger than real earth, probably Jupiter sized (It does have many more moons) Also New World islands tend to change their magnetic fields constantly, thats why Nami have three compass on his pose now. Anyone just trying to cheat could just sail years and reach no island forever.</br>  <br>While that might be true, I don't think the strawhats will wait years on an island just because. Not that can't be avoided by getting an eternal pose somehow.</br>  <br> Nami <br> his </br></br>  <br>You reverse in to death.</br>  <br>Gee, I wonder waht's an eternal pose...</br>  <br>Blackbeard does not use a log pose, he sails blind believing he is the chosen one, so far he has had great success.</br>  <br>Dunno why I thought for a minute Franky was the one with the log pose.</br>  <br> Blackbeard does not use a log pose <br><br>Citation needed</br></br></br>  <br>Laffite is the Navigator of the BB pirates, fyi</br>  <br> all those spines <br>C'mon step it up</br></br>  <br>considering the straw hats didn't even need a year to sail around half the world i'm not sure if it's really bigger</br>  <br>I'll believe it when I see it.</br>  <br>That setup is to make Coby's growth more impressive. The whole theme of his character is that he started off as 'nothing' and grew respectable and powerful by his own willpower.</br>  <br> implying he can't improve <br>He went from being a wimpy cabin boy on a scrubby pirate's to being a moderately competent mariner in the amount of time it took the Straw Hats to get to Water Seven. That's pretty damn impressive considering the level he started at.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with his hand?</br>  <br><br>Exposure to crystals</br></br>  What was he even thinking?<br> gee if I loose my eye I'm sure shanks will see how hard I am </br>  <br> And Shachi. <br><br>no that one's me, lay off</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to show them he's not afraid of being wounded.</br>  <br><br>"I'm not afraid of pain" is what he was thinking</br></br>  <br> I never meet a child in my life <br>God for you anon</br></br>  <br>Luffy is a sadomasochist who can only get sexual satisfaction from being injured. That's why he's always looking for fights and didn't resist Bellamy.</br>  <br>He's a kid. A lot of kids think that.</br>  <br><br>In the final arc most of the current WG and Marines will be rekt. Smoker will take Akainu's position and Coby will be sent on missions to chase Luffy until the end of times.</br></br>  <br> didn't resist Bellamy. <br>wow that sounds so lewd</br></br>  <br><br>Laffite may be the navigator but Blackbeard sailed without him after Drum Island all the way to mock town, was on a big ass raft with no log pose.<br><br>Citation is if you don't go to Skypeia from Mock town it takes three years for a pose to set to an alternate island. <br>Blackbeard just sailed relying on fate, even at Banaro Island Laffite was not there to navigate either.<br>He may use eternal poses to control his territory, but even that isn't shown or implied, only that he does not use them is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bellamy confirmed for nakama.<br>Luffy wants him as his SM fucktoy.</br></br></br>  <br> Smoker will take Akainu's position <br><br>Shirainu?</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer early Nami. I don't know why the fuck in like EVERY animu/manga after a time skip, the creator insists on accentuating all of the women's bodies to ridiculous cow-tit type proportions. <br><br>Just ugh.</br></br></br>  <br>Coby has grown as a fighter more quickly than Luffy, he just started out 1000 times weaker.<br><br>He went from "can't fight a single alvida underling" to "rokushiki" expert in like three months. Of course he wasn't at Lucci's level but he did just as well as Blueno vs Gears Luffy.<br><br>Coby is likely much closer to Luffy in strength now than at Marineford because he grows faster and is a higher potential fighter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3 of the 4 Yonkou are defeated, it's just Straw Hats vs BB now <br> BB is lost somewhere in the new world without a log pose </br></br>  Reminder that Smoker/Hina is OTP  <br><br><br>indeed one of the best scenes<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pal<wbr>3Q4i-VgY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> both smoke <br>I bet they fuck like monkeys</br></br>  <br>Except fate actually brings him on the right path.<br>He set out to find one piece and took the same chain of islands as Luffy after reverse mountain, the same path, sans the a ancient weapon related islands.<br><br>It is not a coincidence that Blackbeard and Luffy both went to Drum.<br><br>Blackbeard sailed underneath Luffy and was going to ambush him at Water 7 but Ace attacked himinstead. <br><br>If you don't believe, re read Banaro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Coby probably undergoes constant training, where as Luffy just had to be strong in order to survive his childhood. He had to get tough and learn how to fight to roll with Ace and Sabo, and also survive his Grandpa's visits, but it's not like anybody taught him one on one until Rayleigh. And after that his power skyrocketed.</br>  <br>they do shit like this anymore the face of zoroa t the end are priceless<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wh4<wbr>J0iA2Pdg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had a metal bar entrapment fetish.</br>  <br>Also it is implied that Ace was following Blackbeard and Ace went to Alabasta.</br>  <br> x marks the spot </br>  <br>Poor Tashigi.</br>  <br>Implying she doesn't want the Z.</br>  <br>Tashigi has sex with her katana. She's fine.</br>  <br>Tashigi has her swords.</br>  <br> Hina will never engage in heavy BDSM with you using her fruit  <br> Why even live? <br><br>Anyway, fairly excited to see her again.<br>I wonder if Coby will be with her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is preemptively friendzoned by looking like Zoro's childhood friend. Also they're both sword autists.</br>  <br>Coby developed CoO on his own, inherently, at Marineford.<br><br>So he had Haki, rokushiki, and constantly trained with garp while Luffy trained with Rayleigh.<br><br>He also saw how Luffy fights by engaging him at water 7 and Marineford, even though yes he lost badly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His two biggest male role models have scars on their eyes.</br>  Where are Zoro's parents?

This will never be.   Cliffhanger is gonna have the dumbest solution. The doll will realize that Hibiki won't transform, will remove the Noise and go away.  <br> Symphogear would be a worse show if Kanade lived. She existed to expand on Tsubasa's character. Kanade should never come back. </br>  <br>Or even dumber. Hibiki suddenly transforms again and the drama gets resolved in 2 minutes.</br>  <br>It's more likely that Hibiki's friends will do something to help her out instead, considering the quotes on the site. What that is, nobody knows.</br>  <br>Well, it's obvious that she won't go for Hibiki. I think it's more likely that she goes for her friends and DMJii come to save the day again, this time with Shirabe's song.</br>  <br>Fuck me with your sword!</br>  <br>This is all true. As has been discussed in previous threads, the only way to bring her back without it being terrible for the show would be an alternate universe where Tsubasa sacrificed herself at the concert instead of Kanade.</br>  <br>Alternate solution</br>  <br> DMJii saving the day twice <br>That won't happen. Garie just leaving them seems to be the most likely solution.</br></br>  <br> an alternate universe where Tsubasa sacrificed herself at the concert instead of Kanade <br> without it being terrible </br></br>  <br>The doll will realize that Hibiki won't transform, will remove the Noise and go away.<br>She will take Hibiki with her. Bullied Hibiki will finally try to protect herself instead of others, and will have some opportunity to talk with Carol, which will made her notice how stupid she was with all that talking about humans understanding each other while hiding own feelings.</br></br>  I want Gary to end the cliffhanger by making out with Hibiki no homo  <br>I know. As a Kanade fan I can say with 100% certainty she should never come back. <br>The dead should stay dead.<br><br>Doesn't make the situation any less bittersweet however.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Miku to fill up every episode by making out with Hibiki in a super homosexual romantic way.</br>  <br>Garie might kidnap Animejanai and friends, forcing Hibiki to go after them later.</br>  <br>Even better she kisses Miku while Hibik ican only watch.<br><br>Or Anime girl gets kissed and she will say it wasn't like in anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe is going to save them and gets seriously hurt because of the lack of Linker. Something more to add to the Hibiki suffering</br>  Noise Flies when?  <br>Even number : "Ahaha, just kidding!"</br>  <br>Calm down Maria</br>  Do Hibiki and Miku know about the dolls' kissing technique? Did they see the dolls kissing someone before?  <br>Well, that's possibility, but I feel like another "friends are in danger, I need to find my temporary determination!" won't change anything. Unless they're going to throw even more suffering at Hibiki in every possible way, but that would be too painful for my kokoro.</br>  <br>Yeah yeah, Symphogear without Nana is hardly Symphogear at all. I still prefer Kanade's design and personality more than Tsubasa's, but &gt;opinions.<br><br><br>This guy also gets it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Noise flies are a horrific concept. You'd have to always be in uniform at all times because one touch and you're dead and given the size and speed of flies you can't kill without a gear.<br><br>That's fucking horrific for a joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Carol sent Garie there to make Hibiki fight, she isn't going to just leave without trying something. If just threatening her with Noise isn't enough, maybe a dead friend or two will do it?</br>  So what the infamous episode 7 with all the Nana screaming can be about?<br><br>Dolls torturing her?<br>Kanade brought back by power of alchemy?<br>I can't really imagine what would make the Sword scream in pain or despair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obligatory episode of Miku bonding with the villains setting the stage for a heel face turn.</br>  <br>It's probably based on size, I doubt those enormous plane noise would just disintegrate if a kid touched it. So in the same way a fly noise would only get rid of a finger or an ear at most.</br>  <br>Maria saw it and she had the opportunity to tell them. We don't know if she ever did tell them, but she probably did.</br>  <br>I don't think they're bringing out Zerbiki so soon.</br>  <br>Who said it would have to be in pain or despair?</br>  <br>Flies probably would be only for scouting Gears' pantsu. Small, but without any way to inflict direct damage</br>  <br>or<br> Hibiki "I forgot the chant!" <br> Suddenly <br> "Be-e-fu-su-to-ra-ga-na-fu~" <br> Anime Janai-chan henshin. <br><br>Id be very happy with either of these two events</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 6 cliffhanger will be Carol revealing her 5th doll which is a re-creation of Kanade. Episode 7 will be 20 minutes of screaming.</br>  <br>That's still terrifying. Not as terrifying but losing a finger isn't exactly a good time had by all.</br>  <br>I'm just saying that's the sort of idea that would be going thorough Garie's head. Anything to force Hibiki to fight.</br>  <br>My money is on  Dainsleif becoming a huge problem, leading to  Carol's death  .</br>  <br>Evil Kanade torturing and molesting Tsubasa at the same time while Maria and Chris watch and gets all blushy about it.</br>  <br> Implying Maria wouldn't jump at the first chance to join in, or try to fight Kanade for it. </br>  <br>Just no of the girls is going to die. A bit too dark even for Symhpogear.</br>  Don't have time to do her hair or eyes but I'm already not really liking brown Hibiki. I'm thinking Chris might be the only one that looks decent brown.<br><br>Can't wait to see Miku and Shirabe brown though, they will look awful.</br></br>  <br>I agree, brown Chris was nice but brown Biki is not looking so great. Maybe with darker, almost black hair</br>  <br><br>Lal'C?</br></br>  Compared to S1 and S2, Tsubasa's voice got deeper this season.  <br><br>I remember that Strike Witches episode.</br></br>  <br> Dolls torturing her? <br><br>This is one thing I actually fear.<br>I really hope it's not this.</br></br></br></br>  More blush Tsubasa please!!!  <br><br>I would take that over Genjuuro dying. Swords are strong, my heart isn't.</br></br>  <br>is... is that Maria x Futa Tsubasa? I'm highly interested.</br>  <br>That's the only page.</br>  <br><br>True.<br>But I bet you can't just simply kill off Genjuuro.<br>That guy punches huge boulders out of the way and is able to block Tsubasa's giant sword attack with his fist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nana is getting old</br>  <br><br>Thanks for reminding me that I need to finish coloring that as well.</br></br>  <br><br>Nana doesn't age. She only becomes more powerful with time.</br></br>  <br> !!! <br> pic with subs on it <br>You don't deserve her love.</br></br></br>  <br> That Tsubasa skin color. <br>Anon that's the skin color of a corpse.<br>Just pick the colors from a screenshot of the anime in neutral lighting</br></br></br>  <br>He seems like the logical choice to kill.</br>  <br>Genjuro has to fight Leiur's giant sister so he can't die.</br>  <br>So does it translate to "Pulsate" or "Cry out"?</br>  <br>Girls' voices don't get deeper from age.<br>They get deeper from feminism. Some people actually made studies on this subject. You can look it up.</br></br>  <br>You missed the part where he used paint for resizing images.</br>  <br>Does Nana abuse Aoi during their recording time?</br>  <br>She's slipping deeper and deeper into SAKIMORI. Maria has to put her back into cute imouto mode and she'll go back to a girly voice.</br>  <br> Dolls torturing her? <br><br>Garie is the sadistic type and Micha does like to explore people's bodies with her knife fingers. Yes, I can get behind this.</br></br></br>  <br>They better not leave any lasting marks on her perfect idol body.</br>  <br> Tsubasa with battle scars. <br>MUH DICK</br></br>  <br> Cry out <br>It's more like cry/resound/roar loudly. 鳴る is a horrible verb to translate because it doesn't have a good English equivalent most of the time. <br><br>Still, considering the "G-Beat" after that, I'd say the pulsate interpretation would fit the translation better, so you can dodge that bullet. Either way there is similar loss in translation though, so it's mostly an aesthetic choice.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She'll have Maria to kiss them better.</br></br>  <br>If this wasn't an anime she would have scars from the surgery back when she Zesshou'd</br>  Hey, she smiled at least once so far.  GENKAI NANTE IRANAI SHIRANAI ZETTAAAAAAAAAI    BERSERKER MODE FOR EVERYONE   <br>TSUNAGI HANASANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIII<wbr>III<br><br> (bagpipes) </br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Wait, who are the eyes?</br>  <br>Dainsleif shards for everyone!</br>  <br>Right is prolly Carol.<br><br>Left is. Uh. Fine-Carol?</br></br></br>  Is Fine Genghis Khan?<br><br>She seems to have her DNA in dudes from Japan all the way to America.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about Nana but Aoi is an S.</br>  <br> Fine-Carol <br><br>I want to see Carol using alchemy to awaken Fine within herself, just to find out Fine was befriended and her whole plan just failed because of that. That would be cute.</br></br></br>  <br>Right really looks like Carol, left is probably Fine based on the slit pupils, so Fine-Carol seems like it might really happen.</br>   mfw Bikki's CD sold better than previous seasons in its first week <br>9.6k.</br>  <br>Has Carol been near Aufwachen Waves yet? Maybe when Hibiki finally fights near her she will get Fine'd.</br>  After downloading all the OSTs I am realizing Symphogear's music in general is fucking amazing, not just the character songs<br><br>Dark Oblivion kinda still sucks though</br></br>  <br>It's really catchy if you pretend it's not english.</br>  <br>Fine is a good person now.</br>  <br>The details on the eyes match neither of them though. It's more likely that they both belong to different characters altogether.<br><br><br>That might not mean much depending on the time over which her previous CDs sold (ie if the vast majority of sales are in the first week anyway).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which is really sad because Youko has a spectacular voice. Ressou Gungnir is probably one of the best solos in the series.</br>  <br> half of the season is skipped because Carol randomly gets Fined <br>I don't see it happening, unless someone else is true villain. I could understand using alchemy to get her back, but just out of nowhere during fight? Nah.</br></br>  <br>Really looking forward to her Airgetlamh song.<br>I'll be disappointed if it isn't at least as cool as KORT EL FES GUNGNIR.</br></br>  <br>Anyone else love how Fine somehow ends up as a thing every season?</br>  <br>And yet still no lossless rips.</br>  <br>We don't know for sure if she's there in GX. I would like it though, she was fine character.</br>  <br>I actually hate it. She was befriended after the FIRST SEASON, stop bringing her back.</br>  <br>I love Resou Gungnir.<br><br>Problem with Dark Oblivion is that it starts out really amazing instrumentally and then goes to shit quickly once Maria starts singing</br></br></br>  Eyes are probably the evil thing controlling Carol, who becomes the patented Big Bad(TM) after freeing Carol. Cue eternal Carol bullying.  <br>So you forget about others once you become friends with them? That's not how it works, anon.</br>  <br>WE CAN NEVER HAVE NOUGH SAWASHIRO</br>  <br>The lyrics are perfectly fine english too.<br>Someone needs to fly over and teach her how to pronounce it right and then rerecord it.

Thinking of what it could mean kills me internally. I want answers, even if it would be through spoilers.  <br>Fuck off Carlos</br>  <br>Depending on the type of screaming I feel like ep 7 might become my most watched anime episode</br>  <br>My bets are on the other gears, Tsubasa namely, going berserk and Hibiki can only watch.</br>  Is it Friday yet.  <br>Symphogear has started to become repetitive. Or at least Hibiki. Seems she's contractually obligated to be retarded and get emotionally crippled by something at the beginning of each season. It's pretty jarring now because in G she actualy grew on me and i felt her development was earned that time. But now she's back on square one. Goddamnit!</br>  <br>People complaining about this is already becoming jarring too.</br>  <br>Just ignore him.</br>  <br> Invite her to a barbecue on father’s day <br>kek</br></br>  <br> Somehow the conclusion Hibiki will arrive is that the whole point of the last two seasons (Understanding Chris, Fine, DMjii and Maria) was idiotic <br>Yeah no. She will just have to refine her views but she won't regret her previous decisions.<br><br>I'm still mad at Maria calling Hibiki a hypocrite, bitch please, if there is one hypocrite in the series is the girl who is complaining about what literally kept her alive</br></br></br></br>  <br>SYMOHOGEAAAAAAAAAAH!!</br>  <br> Maria calling Hibiki a hypocrite <br>Aren't you mixing her up with Shirabe.<br>Maria only called her arrogant, Shirabe was the one who called her a hypocrite.</br></br></br>  <br> how stupid she was with all that talking about humans understanding each other while hiding own feelings <br>I think this counts as refining her views.</br></br>  <br> Maria calling Hibiki a hypocrite <br> Maria <br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br>No you dimwit, important part of why Hibiki's stupid now is that she hides her own feelings and problems. You can't go all about "we can understand each other!" while giving no way to be understood</br>  Shirabe was right about Hibiki all along anyway. She says she wants to protect people but she refuses to do so if it involves fighting. She's a hypocrite.  <br>GX will reveal that Hibiki was completely insane after all.</br>  <br>inb5 DMJii defects to the alchemist faction</br>  I still don't understand how her privacy was invaded at all.<br><br>Is she talking about when she saw her crying?</br></br>  <br> will reveal <br><br>It already did. No sane person would think about themself so lowly to refuse equiping gear against enemy if there's no one else to protect.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I like how Maria actually developed over time as a character and yet is called useless while Hibiki continues to be stuck in a cycle of development for 3 seasons and everyone calls her badass and the best character ever. I like Aoi as much as the next person, but the writers have fucked Hibiki over.  <br>Of course you don't. She never even uses the word privacy. That's just translators being translators.</br>  The Hibiki hate squad is here I see. Well, it was a nice thread.  <br> I still don't understand how her privacy was invaded at all. </br>  <br> maria: lol bikki ur weak <br>Nah, she's pretty much the same bitch she's always been.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first GX thread? People stopped seriously calling Maria useless since episode 1 and people stopped calling Hibiki best character since episode 2. Though everyone will probably go back to worshipping her when she gets over her character development.</br>  <br> she's pretty much the same bitch she's always been. <br><br>Thank god</br></br></br>  <br>Except that isn't what she said at all and she didn't even interact much with Hibiki in G until the very end.</br>  <br>Seems Hibiki stilld don't quite get what befriending means. She needs more lessons from the master.</br>  <br>It is an issue beyond the writers. G tried to sort of wrap up her character because they thought it would be their last season workibg on the show. Just be glad Kaneko is adressing all these issues at all.</br>  <br>Denying her flaws is denying her as a whole. <br><br><br>Good. The last thing Hibiki needs right now is for people to be nice to her and allow her flaws to be perpetuated even further. She's unhealthy beyond belief.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Denying her flaws is denying her as a whole. <br>Nobody's denying her flaws. I'm just not so dedicated to bashing her character and the writing that I want to spend several hours and threads on it.</br></br>  <br>Now I'm picturing Adult Nanoha singing "I will make a man out of you" to Hibiki and other modern magical girls</br>  <br> Denying her flaws is denying her as a whole. <br>The only ones who denied anything were those retarded "Hibiki already was badass and now she's useless again what a shit writting and character regression" guys.</br></br>  <br> Denying her flaws is denying her as a whole. <br>Because her whole being as at fault or what?</br></br>  <br>This. I like Hibiki but it's really frustrating seeing her backpedal into a retarded trauma each time someone questions her. She doesn't show much confidence in her beliefs despite being a very determined girl.<br><br>Maria is right in calling her arrogant. While Hibiki is having second thoughts about her responsabilities people is getting endangered and a crisis goes on. Taking the luxury to stop to question yourself in such circunstances really fits arrogance.</br></br></br>  I prefer Nanafagging than Nanoha or bait shit.  Rainbow flower &gt; Seigi wo Shinjite = G-Beat &gt; Gekisou Gungnir = Little Miracle &gt; Watashi to Iu  <br>So you are saying she didn't regress? That this isn't basically the exact same thing that happened last season with Shirabe?</br>  Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br><br>Text translation<br> https://mangahelpers.com/t/kewl021<wbr>0/releases/41553</wbr> <br><br>Extra stuff in Tankobon 10<br> http://ls57tiger.freepgs.com/jojo/<wbr>phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=204672#p2046<wbr>72</wbr></wbr> <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>HWMN don't have the raws yet it seems, so we'll be waiting a few more days at the very least.<br><br>What's the general consensus on the new EoH demo.

In what way does time erasing allow you to phase people into shit? I've heard multiple attempts at explaining it, but never been convinced.  <br><br> Waaaaagh, goodies died <br><br>God forbid the results of the final battle actually accurately reflect the given abilities of the fighters and not hinge on the MC winning due to sheer plot armour like most parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like it<br>like all games that Time Stop has been in the rule has always been either prevent time stop before it happens, or have someone who can stop time to counter it<br><br><br> EoH is coming out on PS3 too right? <br>yes.<br> Hope it will get a Yurop release. <br>already confirmed<br><br><br>i always thought he used the erased time to place her over the bars and then when "time resumed" she was disoriented and confused (King Crimsons greatest ability) and then fell onto them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "i cant handle good guys losing and dying for once!! why didnt anyone pull something out of their ass like my other shounen?!?! Wheres Stone Free Requiem?!?!?!?!" <br>every god damn time.</br></br>  <br>King Crimson skips the cause but leaves the effect. With 「FATE」being a solid part in JoJo, seeing Narancia on the bars with Epitaph means it is absolutely going to happen no matter what. Maybe he was punched or thrown into it, we just don't know how he got on the fence, but as long as Diavolo uses King Crimson, Narancia would have absolutely died.<br>Basically if I was walking at 1m/s and King Crimson "skipped" time then I would find myself 5-10m from my original position, I just wouldn't know how.</br></br>  <br>It's been 20 years since GioGio, just let it go. It will never ever be explained.<br><br><br>Nigga it's not the fact that the cast died. It's the fact that Jotaro failed to beat Pucci. In a world where people have SUTANDO POWAH, wouldn't you keep your timestop power in check? Also, part 6 is still a really good part, I'm not denying that. Jolyne's smarts were Trickster-tier and I'd put her in the top 3 Jojos.<br><br> plot armour <br>If anything there was a lot of PIS in the last fight, and Pucci having a myriad of abilities with his stand also being a punch ghost is stacked as fuck when compared to Stone Free. You could tell Araki wanted to do something about quantum strings with Jolyne's mobius strip, but he never went through with it. Maybe he just got tired of that universe because of the shocking powercreep that happened as the parts went on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this looks like the work of a enemey stand haha ora ora bro jotaro dies read the mango  <br>who are you quoting<br><br>the ending would have been infinitely better if Emporio didn't win</br></br></br>  <br>haha ora ora bro read the manga</br>  <br> who are you quoting <br>some dipshit who thinks SO is the worst jojo part<br>it doesnt even have to be the best, but anyone who would put it that low is just a sore anime kiddo sad their favorite anime character Jotaro got killed with the entire cast except Emporio<br><br> the ending would have been infinitely better if Emporio didn't win <br>you're absolutely correct and i 100% agree<br>felt kind of forced to be honest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> some dipshit who thinks SO is the worst jojo part <br>it is the worst part read the manga</br></br>  <br><br><br>do not reply to shitposters</br></br></br>  <br> Pucci having a myriad of abilities with his stand <br><br>Name a single main character stand that didn't have multiple abilities. <br><br> stacked as fuck when compared to Stone Free <br><br>That was the entire point being made. The heroes SHOULD have died because Pucci not only outsmarted them and constantly achieved his goals but had a more powerful stand. Compare that to part 3 where Jotaro has a shittier version of the same stand and wins just because he is supposed to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so far im havin fun hopefully the older jotaro has a cooler GHA</br>  <br>haha ora ora bro *does a king crimson attack*</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br> shittier version of the same stand and wins just because he is supposed to. <br><br>No, he had the same stand as DIO, only DIO fully developed it faster than he did. He didn't win because he was "supposed" to, DIO lost focus because he was high and whatnot, and was not in his usual mood since he found it Jotaro could stop time too.<br><br> Stand with multiple abilities <br>Mosts stands had two abilities at most.

I think he thought "well KC broke the bars and put Narancia into them, then when time resumed the damage of the bars was erased but Narancia stayed inside" then forgot and broke the bars visually when he came back once he had decided KC can actually break inanimate objects...but it could also cut the hand of that one guy... fucking KC HOW DOES IT WORK</br>  Ayy Dio  <br>whats good?</br>  <br>Gay priest heard Dio</br>  Why didn't Diego just turn Valentine into a dinosaur?  <br>It was trademarked in EU.<br>I can't see them not releasing it in the US, but didn't ASB sell like shit in there.</br></br>  <br>0m range stand</br>  <br>Because Diego sucks dick tbh.</br>  <br>Do you really think he could win against a dinosaur with Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap? Valentine's patriotism is too strong to let him follow the orders of a limey, and Diego knows that he shouldn't turn Valentine into an even greater enemy.</br>  I've been told that there are things that are made up in the older Part 05 scans. Is that true, and if so, could you provide an example?  <br>They're lying, they're araki fanboys who don't want to admit he fucked up</br>  <br>He cut his fucking throat, m8. He obviously touched him enough times.<br><br><br>So basically Araki conveniently forgot about his ability to allow Valentine to win?</br></br></br></br>  <br>didn't he cut D4C instead of him?</br>  <br>Oh, if it's just boring or made poorly in parts, I can deal with that. I'd just like to avoid having incorrect information or interpretations of the characters if at all possible</br>  <br>The translation is emotionless and might miss on subtleties (which jojo doesn't usually have) , but that's it. It's boring and only the stand fights are good, at least those where Giorno doesn't pull a Jotaro.</br>  <br>Well, alright then. Thank you very much.</br>  <br>He did cut both, but maybe you're right. Maybe he only wounded Valentine with fatal wounds and thus did not need to turn him into a dinosaur. he could have just attacked his leg and made him one though. He can transform people pretty fast, like instantly.</br>  Well, I just finished Part 6, planning to start 7, but from what I've heard of Johnny he's completely different from Jonathan, who's one of my favourites  <br>I thought that Dr Ferdinand was the one that had the ability to turn others into dinosaurs, and Diego could only could control those dinosaurs and control his own state.</br>  <br>He's better</br>  <br>If anything Gyro is more similar to Jonathan, you'll probably like him.</br>  <br>Nah, Diego made dinosaurs for Soundman and also turned flees and other creatures into dinosaurs later. He even made two people into inanimate dinosaur objects(?). Oh yeah, his horse too.</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the info.</br></br>  New EoH is really fun.<br>I still can't figure out how picking N'doul isn't asking for death but they really stepped up their game in polishing and fixing everything that people said were wrong.</br>  <br>This might explain it</br>  <br>After Ferdinand dies Dio is considered the stand master. It's not precised whether he actually took control of the original Scary Monsters or if the stand makes copies of itself with each person it transforms</br>  <br>I think it is just that DIO was transformed, and then when he got the eye he made it his own similar to how Gyro and Johnny got their stands. It is still different from Ferdinand in the way he can also transform himself and have the speed and senses the dinosaur has.</br>  <br>i suppose it would correlate with the anime being dubbed here<br>that takes faith as well<br>im 100% certain theyll release it stateside<br> yfw   the subs are just as bad as ASB <br><br><br>yeah. read  for hype<br><br> I still can't figure out how picking N'doul isn't asking for death <br>because he has a bunch of good abilities to make up for his bad defense<br>he can call his water stand back to his and shit<br>try him out!<br><br><br>i thought "Scary Monsters" was Ferdinands and "Scary Monster" was Diego's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i thought "Scary Monsters" was Ferdinands and "Scary Monster" was Diego's <br>That's a translation error, they're both Scary Monsters.</br></br>  <br>You are supposed to find a safe spot and protect yourself from enemies instead of fucking around in the stage.</br>  <br>god dammit</br>  <br><br> DIO lost focus because he was high and whatnot <br><br>Oh fuck right off.<br><br> Kicks Star Platinums hand to pieces <br> Nothing happens to Jotaro because lol protagonist <br> The World's leg crumbles <br> DIO dies instantly despite being a super vampire with even better regeneration than normal because lol muh leg got kicked </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't look like it supports local play</br>  <br> being a level 1 reader <br>Bet you don't even read, just an animefag.</br></br>  <br>DIO kicked with a weakened leg knowing that what his stands does better is punching.

Multiple strokes to the same area, plus The Worlds' lower durability, means Jotaro was able to split the stand apart with a punch, and since damage to stands = damage to stand user...<br>You see what I mean.</br></br></br>  <br>because eye goo isn't better than twenty knives thron by the world.<br>because the last time he tried, DIO got Kakyoin'd<br>because's Dio's actually arrogant and hammy.<br>Araki is actually a good writer.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Can't muster any rebuttal <br> L-level 1 reader <br> I b-bet you don't read t-the mango </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not what level 1 reader implies.</br>  <br><br> The World crumbles because DIO kicked with his bad legs <br> Jotaro is fine punching with a broken clavicle and no ribs <br><br>Who knew 17 year olds were so much more durable than regenerating vampires?

Before it fully healed, he attacked Jotaro with his stand's leg, which is in the same condition as his real leg. Also, the left side of DIO's body heals slower than the right because he still isn't used to Jonathan Joestar's body. That's why Jotaro won that exchange. A punch ghost attacking with a punch with all its strength, vs a kick from a damaged leg that already has reduced vamipiric healing. I wonder who wins?<br><br>Now fuck off, you filthy secondary.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro didn't attempt to strike a power type stand with his broken clavicle and ribs, did he? <br>Also, </br></br>  <br>SP was shielding him. Kakyoin's stand isn't a punch ghost like Jotaro's and DIO's.</br>  <br>TOOL<br>a close range stand that resembles a bulky skinless human with 3 eyes<br><br>Can manipulate machinery like clay and re purpose it to the my needs like turning a microwave into fire spewing deathtrap</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Still no rebuttal <br> L-l-level o-one </br></br></br>  <br><br> Broken clavicles don't effect your ability to punch </br></br>  <br><br> SP was shielding him. <br><br>Anon, look at the page. Just actually look at it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>readers should know that user injuries don't affect the stand.<br>it's just that the world had worse durability and that Araki had to partially bullshit his way to the end.</br></br>  <br> i always thought he used the erased time to place her over the bars and then when "time resumed" she was disoriented and confused (King Crimsons greatest ability) and then fell onto them. <br><br>Narancia is a guy.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm done.</br>  <br><br>Now go read the manga.</br></br>  <br> likes tool <br> thinks microwave use heat to cook food <br><br>Underage pls go.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's just that the world had worse durability and that Araki had to partially bullshit his way to the end. <br><br>The only time we've seen SP: The World started he had an E in durability.</br></br></br>  What the fuck happened to Araki's art? It was pretty good in part 7. Is he getting tired of drawing JoJo?  <br>fuck its late man sorry</br>  <br>like three parts after.<br>Araki doesn't plan that far ahead.</br></br>  Dio was simply nerfed (and made stupid) and Jotaro was simply buffed for the fight, just to give the main character a chance to win.<br><br>Things simply happened like they happened because Araki put himself in a corner regarding how to make Jotaro win the battle, so he was made super powerful and got the ability to stop time</br></br>  <br><br> I wonder who wins? <br><br>I'm going to take the guy who doesn't have two busted arms and can regenerate instantly for $500 Alex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gee anon Im sorry my autism offended your autism</br>  <br> regenerate instantly <br><br>He can't, Jim.

After many days of being unable to get erect, despite wishing for it, his dick stops thinking.</br>  <br>araki drew the fight when he had an A in durability in mind no, he only changed his mind after.</br>  <br>It doesn't fully develop to that until part 4.</br>  <br><br> If I pretend he hasn't read the manga maybe he'll not notice I don't know what I'm talking about <br><br>You might want to try reading it yourself seeing as DIO instantly regens his hand and head without needing to drink any blood. <br><br>Also, nice attempt to ignore the fact Jotaro had broken shoulders. I'm sure you'll get over losing internet arguments about manga someday. Sorry I insulted Araki's shitty writing in front of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Any evidence for this claim?</br></br>  <br>Well there is the stat sheet we get of it in part 4 which describes that Star Platinum had developed, resulting in a weaker durability.</br>  <br><br>But that corroborates the point that timestop weakened him.</br></br>  <br>But it still isn't established until part 4, meaning that Star Platinum doesn't have a lower durability until it was established in part 4.<br><br>Of course it's reasonable to argue that with the changes, SP would retroactively have a lower durability during the fight in SC, but since it was never established at the time, he never got a lower durability when fighting DIO.</br></br></br>  Stats are bullshit anyways. Only idiots takes them seriously  <br><br> SP was shielding him. <br><br>We are specifically shown that NOT happening. Luckily Jotaro had all that PLOT to keep his head attached.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The World is a punching stand.</br>  I read the series in B&amp;W exclusively, but what part provides the most clarification and should be read in color?  <br>Mate you already got blown the fuck out here<br><br>, why are you still posting?</br></br></br>  <br>SP's body is still in Jotaro's body, SP just stuck his arms out. Think of it as SUTANDO ARMAA.<br><br>SP even stealth stopped a bullet, and you're trying to tell em that SP didn't shield Jotaro from fatal attacks? Nah</br></br></br>  <br>stone ocean, no reason not to</br>  <br> It's the fact that Jotaro failed to beat Pucci <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  So, is Part 8 still at the "beginning" and going slowly, or do you think it's nearly halfway through?<br><br>I'm hoping it picks up a bit now that Gappy knows who both of his halves are. I also hope he gets some more allies because just having his girlfriend and a little kid backing him up is kinda lame.</br></br>  <br>The hell are you talking about he has a C.</br>  <br>I'm sure Joubin is on his side. If he's not a villain.</br>  <br>Part 8 is iffy. We don't know who the big bad is yet and the slowest JoJo to do that was Part 4 and that was midway. We know sthe big bad has something to do with the Pillar Men knockoffs.</br>  <br>My bad. He actually has an A in Part 3 that devolves to B in later parts. The range is C.</br>  <br>he died instantly because his stand was destroyed you dopey cunt</br>  What's that website where you use photos to make custom ties? I want a Kira tie and the official one is way too expensive.  <br>The story still has to clear up things as to which side Jobin stands on and what's the deal with the fruits and the rockmen killing people who know about them. And we gotta see Hato and Jobin's wife's stands. Only after all that will the enemies and allies become more clear.<br><br>Part 8 is more mystery-centric than part 4 was. Every chapter is about uncovering more evidence and the battles will be way more scarce until the later half, I believe.</br></br></br>  How did Araki go from part 7 to part 8? It's as if he's a different(worse) writer.  <br>He was probably wanting to write/planning part 7 plot for some time and afterwards went with his usual making shit up as he goes along way of writing for part 8.</br>   The World looks live a diver because Ronnie James Dio's song "Holy Diver   Let's come up with some alternative Stand names! The Hand becomes Personal Space Invader, named after Andrew Jackson Jihad's song  <br>If anything I'd say it's a bit more focused and cohesive in handling its themes.<br><br><br>Part 7 is one of the most obvious products of him making shit up as he goes along though. The instant it changed magazines it shifted gears completely.</br></br></br></br>  I don't want Kakera to be kill  <br> We know sthe big bad has something to do with the Pillar Men knockoffs. <br><br>Maybe the equivalent exchange turns people into not!pillar men?<br>As the guy who had dealt with the dad of the kid said, they didn't see the entire equivalent exchange with the old pair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing they're either one shots or art books. Though 2 art books doesn't make sense so maybe both?</br>  7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3<br><br>Prove me wrong ya buttholes</br></br>  What happens if DIO stops time(I assume it's a sphere of a certain size) And someone outside of stopped time enters it? I guess they will be stopped too. How does stopped time look like for the people outside of it? The same way it looks for DIO?  <br>The time stop doesn't have a range.</br>  <br>Doesn't DIO stop the entire universe?</br>  <br> I can't, holy shit, that's exactly my taste ctrl+c ctrl+v </br>  <br>Fuck off with your retarded rankings. <br><br> It's shit, btw. </br></br></br>  Whats the worst fight of each part?  <br>He wants to kill him, not turn him into his pawn.</br>  <br>Ghaiccio talking about French when he's actually talking about Italian. Also, Polpo saying that he has a Buddhist painting when he just has some Van Goghs.</br>  is Kakyoin evil  <br>Just kill him when he's your pawn then. Turning him into a dinosaur would stop him from escaping.</br>  <br>What about the part that Bruno speaks chinese and Narancia says lolz?</br>  <br>No, he was actually bitching about how in english, we say "pair-iss" when in French it's "par-ee" or whatever, wasn't he?</br>  <br> 1 <br>Those four weird-ass zombies<br><br> 2 <br>Hard to pick one, nearly all the fights are good.

He would live AND have the corpse.  who has the best gun stand  <br>  ignoring how he turned those guards into lamps? <br>Well that's convenient. He also turned flees into dinosaurs instantly. I at least assume they were flees.</br></br>  <br>No, he's cute.</br>  CONFIRMED<br><br>EoH will have it's own original story WHICH is also being overseen by Araki himself</br></br>  <br>When you're so focused on your goal, you don't tend to think of more elegant solutions. Also. Araki.</br>  <br>Old news.</br>  does Araki have a skin peeling fetish  <br>Not it's not. Not the original story, that was only speculated you dumb fuck</br>  <br>You really are retarded.</br>  <br> Dark Blue Moon because it's SP bullshit at its worst. <br>Justice was worse</br></br>  <br>Oh really? Show me the post that confirmed this</br>  <br>He obviously did think that elegantly as he said it. I would have really liked it if he had kept his promise, it's as if Araki kind of set him up to do so, then decided against it.</br>  <br>You really shouldn't be thinking too hard about these fights when Araki has a track record for these kinds of things.</br>  <br> He also turned flees into dinosaurs instantly. <br>Time taken is proportional to body mass.</br></br>  <br>Bet you think Dio should really have gone through with making Jonathan and Erina vampires, too, and that there's even a miniscule chance that Jonathan would have accepted.<br><br>Face it, it was never gonna happen because that sort of thing just isn't what Good Guys DO.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at older threads.</br>  <br>That's not showing me faggot.

Okuyasu is pure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then we have the guys you mentioned.</br>  <br>Yeah I was kind of conflicted about it as it would mean the President would get away with everything he had done.

I guess I was just kind of charmed by his patriotism.</br>  <br>not the same guy, but I got nothin' there.</br>  <br>I read it as him knowing he's doing bad things but they don't matter because they justify the means.

Are you still sad Joseph went senile?</br>  <br>I dont think Jotaro is shit, but its more hes always overshadowed by personalities that are much more attention drawing, in Part 3, we got Joseph, who was very over the top and being the main humour based crusader, as well as this was the first time we'd seen a JoJo return, and continuing with SC, Polnareff is one of the best side characters in all of JoJo, in Part 4 he doesnt appear much, and even then hes thrown in with a clusterfuck of about 10 other good guys, Part 6 he appeared for about 20 chapters outside of flashbacks</br>  <br> Are you still sad Joseph went senile? <br>No, cause apparently he got better. Doesn't mean I like Jotaro any better though.</br></br>  <br>Why do you dislike Jotaro?</br>  <br>You don't have to like him, I just can't fathom how some people can hate a manga character so much that they have to pick apart every bullshit thing that involves him.</br>  The art got so much worse from part 7 to 8. What the fuck happened?  why is the fact Giorno is Dio's son never brought up again  <br>Because it doesn't matter?</br>  <br>because in the context of Part 5, no one would give a shit, also we had seven pages of him going "MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA" followed up by a page of "WRYYYYYYYYY" at one point</br>  <br>Why should it?</br>  <br><br>Bone Broke<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kRQ<wbr>jFB3MV4s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>A stand that takes the form of a 100 dollar note or 10,000 yen note or whatever the equivalent is for the country I'm in.

If anyone asked to borrow it or anything they bought with it they would get extremely possessive and drive themselves away from other people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was little more than an excuse to have a new Jojo not too far in the future without repeating the Josuke angle of Joseph having been unfaithful.</br>  <br>Araki doesn't like cool things.</br>  <br> Implying DIo would care </br>  <br>That wouldn't be cool, that would be stupid.</br>  <br><br>Imagine if Joseph had knocked up a woman at every location on the journey in Part 3 and there were a ton of little Jojos running around.</br></br>  <br>This.

Don't forget that.</br>  <br>The body wasn't trully his until he consumed Joseph's blood. Plus Giorno got the birthmark. So the semen is still brave and gentlemanly Joestar semen.</br>  <br> He reposts things from the archive. </br>  <br>Got it holds it for so long</br>  <br>Every brown grill. Due to the brown grill's amazing fertility rates (see Casca from Berserk), each and every one of them would sire a bastard with very high level stand abilities. Even if they do fail, Josuke can just turn MiH to money with Crazy Diamond Requiem.</br>  <br>This was already posted before, aren't you satisfied?</br>  <br>Joestar sex drive cant be diminished!</br>  <br>Dunno why you keep reposting it, but the answer is clearly that he's just having fun taking advantage of the higher freedom he has compared to what he could do back in Shonen Jump.</br>  <br>What kind of child would even come out of Joseph and Runaway Girl?<br><br>Or fuck, Joseph and Mariah.</br></br></br>  <br>Just cause one finger couldn't heal faster doesn't mean DIO wouldn't focus all his vampire essence wouldn't overwhelm Joestar semen so DIO's new vampire balls can produces semen at a a faster rate meaning the more powerful he gets the more he can cum.</br>  which stand is the scariest looking?<br> King Crimson <br>the whole body pattern, it almost looks like a flayed man, the constant frown the two, (that in itself is unnerving) faces, it really says a lot about diavolo<br> C-Moon <br>the fact that it's retarded makes it even more scary<br> GER <br>not the design or anything, but i have to mention it since it was so jarringly cold and really showed a darker side of giorno</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very much this.

So is Green Day.<br><br>I actually think Star Platinum is creepy when it has its eyes wide open. It was especially scary at the beginnng of Part 3 when you didn't really know what it was yet. <br><br>I think Baby Face is the cutest stand because of its innocence and niavety.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up.</br>   Kira <br> he's a killer </br>  <br>What a shitty Death Note ripoff.</br>  <br>Why did Araki just drop Fugo?</br>  <br>I find Cream to be the scariest looking, it just makes me feel intimidated</br>  <br> telling me to shut up </br>  <br>because he didn't know how to handle purple haze, also he was supposed to be a mole for diavolo but that was dropped, you can hear the dialogue for the dropped mole-plot in ASB</br>  I want to cum inside Pucci!  <br>he originally wanted him to betray the group for Diavolo but thought it was too sad<br>so he just left him behind and never did anything with him again</br></br>  <br>PH 2 OP</br>  <br>P-please don't.</br>  7 &gt; 5 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 &gt; 6  <br>I've said it before, shut up Dio</br>  <br>Gay priest is cute!

Don't really recall anything specific though.</br></br></br>    so did DIO steal Avdol's naming motif or is it just fate that we only had tarot stands + the last two on part 3?  <br>Got one with sound?</br>  <br>Since time is not a tangible concept and exists exists to measure and define other concepts such as gravity, velocity etc.<br><br>could you say that dio "freezes" the entire universe? maybe that's why it's so physically taxing, he keeps the entire universe still for about 9 seconds with the power of his stand</br></br></br>  <br>he did, but he meant places he cant reach, for example as fast as Dio was if someone was a mile away, that'd be out of Dio's range</br>  <br><br>He's out of range to get close. His stand can only stop time for 5 seconds at first, 11 seconds later. So he wouldn't reach the enemy in time. His stand can go within 2 meters of him.</br></br>  <br>Yep, Araki stated time-stop works for the whole universe.</br>  <br>He meant out of Range as in " To far away for me to get close enough to hit." Timestop may be universal, but The World can only move so far with DIO.</br>  <br><br> 7=5, 1&gt;3. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect. gj anon </br></br>  <br>The World's range is 10 meters, not 2</br>  <br>that's why it's taxing to both move in stopped time and to stop it</br>  <br> 7=5 </br>  <br>he's saying the physical stand has a 2 meter range, and then DIO has a 10 meter range when in stopped time</br>  <br>DIO doesn't do anything, he tossed aside his alcoholism as a human. I guess you can describe Joestar blood as his drug.</br>  <br> and then DIO has a 10 meter range when in stopped time <br>does he really state that?</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry bud, Passione fights were just too good.</br></br>  <br>He's wrong:<br>The World has a 10 meters range from DIO.<br>The time-stop effect works on the whole universe.</br></br></br>  <br> The World has a 10 meters range from DIO. <br><br>Nope, Star Platinum has a really short range and they're the same stand and have the same stat range, and we never see it be further away than 2 meters.</br></br></br>  <br>Except part 8 is a million times more interesting so far</br>  Why didn't DIO just ask gay priest for help against Jotaro and the crew?  <br>No it's not. It's exactly like LOST. <br><br> introduce 20 mysteries per episode <br> explain 5 at the end of the season <br> 10 become irrelevant and 5 are never answered </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gay priest was in the perfect position to bring him back if he died and could be trusted, you don't waste your extra life to get a +5 STR boost</br>  <br>It was explicitly stated in the DIO vs Kakyoin car chase.<br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br> Aqua Necklace was really forgetable to me. <br>And yet you mentioned it</br></br>  <br>he probably looked through a "stands from part 4" list and picked whichever one he had trouble remembering</br>  <br>Did the anime changed it?</br>  <br>Are you claiming to be from the future?</br>  <br> Dragon's Dream because I feel like it really drags on. <br>I appreciate it anon, even if no one else did.<br>But you have shit taste, Wired was a great stand to introduce the "no more punch ghosts, no more OP stands, everyone is as clever as the protagonists" trend of Part 7.</br></br></br>  <br>You can tell when something is actually going to answer the mysteries, like with Homestuck, you got answers at around the same time you got the questions.</br>  <br>Why would they change an important fact about the stand?</br>   tfw /a/ will never understand that SP is the world's strongest and invincible stand because it can pull random abilities out of his ass when the situation requires it to save the day <br><br><br>I haven't read the SC manga (read everything else) and I didn't remember 10 meters.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently there's a Part 4 mode where you have to break the walls in certain places around Morioh-cho to proceed (you can probably fix them later with Josuke, which is already possible in demo #1). I also heard that if you turn around in "that" alley, you'll actually see the hands behind you.<br><br>This is all from a loose translation of the recent UJ issue btw.</br></br></br>  Why did Araki hack it up with the main villain's power of part 4, 6 and 7? They all had to "level up" through some power unrelated to their previous one to even be a proper threat. I guess the same can be said for Giornio's GER  <br>Star Platinum? What kind of random abilities? Star Finger and Time Stop and?</br>  <br>Then you should have read it like the rest of us. And SP didn't pull anything out of it's ass when Pucci was fucking everything up, did it?</br>  <br> part 4 mode <br>You mean stage. The alley thing isn't confirmed. I got my info from the UJ issue too  and I actually know nip </br></br>  <br>Because it was irrelevant to the plot. Be thankful Araki mentioned it all, otherwise no Japanese reader would have been interested initially.</br>  <br>Man, what's up with your choices for points of reference? Lost and goddamn Homestuck of all things?<br><br>The thing here is that there are extremely few questions that aren't tied very close to all the other ones. Every new revelation is sure to answer several of them at once.</br></br></br>  <br> And SP didn't pull anything out of it's ass when Pucci was fucking everything up, did it? <br>Jotaro spent the ability which is why its potential is at E by then</br></br>  <br>Vacuum breath against Justice.</br>  <br>Bites the Dust was the most bullshit. If you stab yourself with the arrow again you get a new ability? Well just keep stabbing yourself, might as well get like 20 abilities just to be sure you can win.</br>  <br>So you just proved your own point wrong, good job.</br>  Why is part 1 so underrated? It had a great atmosphere, great characters, and didn't asspull in the same way that the other parts did. It was short as fuck, and I wish it was longer, but it's still a great part for what it's worth. I know people have been saying this before but it's true, the character development Jonathan goes through really sets him apart from the other JoJos because of how fleshed out it was. The fights were also great, and I can't think of a single actual asspull, everything was still within the range of trickery that made sense and was genuinely clever. I'm not saying that the other Jojo parts lack this, part 7 and part Part 2, hell every part ends up doing this to some extent but it's still riddled with asspulls that came out of nowhere or are so unbelievably lucky that it defies logic.<br>Is it just a big meme to dislike part 1 because of how old and different it is compared to the other parts of Jojo? I'm all caught up with the series now, and am waiting on new chapters for part 8 but I still can't shake the feeling that part 1 is one of the best written parts of Jojo, period.</br>  <br> two widely known and popular in 4chan mystery series </br>  <br>vampire eyes<br>two coffins</br></br>  <br>And hope you don't die in the process.</br>  <br>Didn't it only activate when he was desperate or something? Either way it's bullshit. He also ended up using the plant as a weapon. I guess there sadly wasn't that much you could do with Killer Queen as it had weak melee abilities(comperatively to CD) and you could only make one bomb at a time.</br>  <br>I remember it existed but I honestly can't remember how the fight goes other than Josuke fusing Angelo with rock at the end.<br><br>And I'm usually pretty good at remembering how fights go.</br></br></br>  <br> Dio having unexpected powers that are unknown even to him <br>Understandable.<br> Two coffins <br>When was this?</br></br></br></br>  Does Jotaro still age during the time stop?

If you stabbed yourself again you'd just get wounded.

Jotaro breathes during the timestop, his body works normally so why wouldn't it age?</br></br>  <br><br>Has anyone drawn the Stardust Crusaders dressed like actual crusaders?</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be mentioned and loathed here if it wasn't now, would it?</br>  Why does Araki hate women?<br> make female protagonist <br> make her fail <br> make the entire timeline/world fuck, probably ending the JoJo line in that universe. </br></br></br>  <br>There's always the chance that the arrow won't deem you worthy of another ability and you'll just die.
