[ Is moeshit the capeshit of anime?  So guys, who's the strongest NasuVerse character?  <br>ORT or one of the other TYPEs</br>  Well actually lets exclude the TYPE's nad leave it to beings on earth otherwise the TYPE's would be the winner.  I'm working on Heavens Feel and I'm at the point where Kotomine is surgerizing her, but I have a question: Why does Sakura feel guilt towards Shirou? I mean she's the one that got raped, does she blame herself for being impure and wanting him, or what? Or am I thinking in the wrong context and she feels guilty because she kept her being a master from him?  <br>It's the latter of what you're thinking, the master thing</br>  Takeuchi's libido.  Slash Emperor, Zelretch back in his prime  Type Mercury (ORT) = Ado Edem &gt; Type Jupiter &gt; Type Saturn &gt; Type Moon (Crimson Moon) &gt; Type Pluto = The Six Sisters &gt; Type Venus &gt; Arcueid (Full power) &gt; Balor &gt; Primordial Demons &gt; True Demons &gt; Primate Murder &gt; Original Roa &gt; Angra Mainyu &gt; Zelretch (young) &gt; Lancelot (F-15) &gt; Gilgamesh (Vimana) &gt; Counter Guardian Archer &gt; Gilgamesh (Tohsaka) &gt; Gilgamesh (Kotomine) = Arcueid (30%) &gt; Dark Sakura &gt; Dark Saber &gt; Lancelot = Saber &gt; 5th Berserker &gt; Dark Berserker &gt; 17th Roa (Elesia) &gt; 4th Rider &gt; Merem Solomon &gt; 5th Lancer (optimal) &gt; 4th Lancer = 5th Rider (Sakura/optimal) = 4th Caster (optimal) &gt; 5th Lancer (Kotomine) = 5th Caster = 4th Caster (Ryuunosuke) &gt; 5th Rider (Shinji) &gt; Nrvnqsr = Clairvoyant Fujino = Kurogiri &gt; Archer &gt; Kouma &gt; 5th Assassin = 4th Assassin &gt; Aoko = Barthomeloi = Arcueid (6%) = Kojirou = Ciel = "Ryougi Shiki" = Soren Araya (within the Ogawa Building) &gt; Gun God (Black Barrel) &gt; Touko = El-Melloi = Night of Wallachia &gt; Sion Tatari = Melty Blood Satsuki = R. Shiki = Akiha = Asagami Fujino = 18th Roa &lt; Tohno SHIKI = Alba = Heaven's Feel Shirou = Kiri &gt; Nanaya Shiki = Reinforced Kuzuki = Sion = UBW Shirou = Waver = Bazett &gt; Avenger = Rin = Kotomine = Zouken = Luvia &gt; Kiritsuhu = Irisviel &gt; Maiya = Leysritt = Tsukihime Satsuki = Lio = Avalon Shirou = Sakura = Ilya = Kariya = Len &gt; Kirie = Caren = Meruka &gt; Azaka &gt; The Dead = Possessed Corpse = Misayo = Dragon Tooth Warrior = Fuji-nee &gt; Gun God (unequipped) &gt; Fake Shiki &gt; Ryuunosuke &gt; Tomoe &gt; Keita San &gt; Shinji = Hisui = Kohaku  <br>Gilgamesh <br>inb4 Shirou beats him <br>That was BS</br></br></br>  I'm the night.  <br>how was that BS? Shirou is the most likely to beat Gilgamesh than every other servant or human, his ability is almost the exact same as Gilgamesh's along with gilgamesh arrogance on using Ea at the last scene, he ended getting overwhelmed and destroyed because of his arrogance.</br>  <br>i thought Angra Mainyu was weak</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I'm gonna go with Type-Sol or maybe Type-UY Scuti</br>  <br>From Nasu its Arcuied then Ryougi followed by servant tier characters like aoko, dark sakura. Servants werent in his list but theyd be ranked amongst the servant tier characters.</br>  <br>The fanbase's collective autism.</br>  <br>Not the fake one, not Avenger, the real Angra Mainyu</br>  <br>Gotcha, ty.<br><br><br> Tohno and Nanaya Shiki's on the bottom half of the list. <br>Against non-humans, doesn't he jump up a shit load?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh (Kotomine) = Arcueid (30%)<br>I'm sorry, what? Also Kouma would stomp EMIYA</br></br>  <br>ORT-chan is the strongest and the cutest.</br>    <br>My ass</br>  <br> Can't understand all the backstory and plot placed into Type-Moon works. </br>  <br><br>That single &lt; between Roa and SHIKI kills the linear progression. Is HF Shirou stronger than ORT or not?</br></br>  <br><br>Please not this again.<br><br>Yes Gilgamesh is stronger, yes it was bullshit he got beat, but thats where arrogance and a badass reality marble gets you.</br></br></br></br>  Any chance on a Fate X Jojo Doujinshi out there?  <br> JoJo </br>    <br>If you're implying that Gilgamesh even comes close to Arc then you best realize you're wrong now.</br>  <br>It all depends on who lands their trump first. Plus Arc has the whole You+1 deal.</br>  <br>Can someone tell me which is Arcueid 30% and 6%.<br>The full power is Archtype Earth right ?<br>Which one who got slashed by Shiki ?</br></br></br>  If Lancelot was paired with illya, they would be unbeatable. Prove me wrong.  <br>30% was Arc(normal) when she's using 70% of her power to suppress her blood-lust, 6% is after Shiki cuts her into little chunks iirc.</br>  The White Princess. She is the Ultimate One.  <br>I thought the 30% was post Shiki-gibbing?</br>  It's ORT until a stronger TYPE shows up.  <br><br> None of the Necos <br><br>What a shit ranking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>ORT.<br>Conditionally? <br>Tohno fucking Shiki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Type Pluto <br> implying Pluto is a planet </br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>Lancelot ftw</br></br></br>  <br>After losing 1 arm Giglamesh should have gone all out on him instead he decides to keep acting like a fucking rtarded</br>  <br>She was already using 70% of her power before the events of Tsukihime as the growing strength of her bloodlust just increased as time passed since she was created close to 1000 years ago. Shiki cutting her up decreased that remaining 30 to around 7 percent after having to stitch herself up again. Then as her arc proceeds, she loses even more energy trying to stop Shiki from getting killed by Roa Shiki.</br>  If there is a Type Moon, does that mean there is a Type for every moon of Jupiter and Saturn?    wouldn't Void Shiki be potentially stronger than Types?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her face just says "Fuck with me. Just fucking try."</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br><br>Not even Void can kill a Type, even with her MEoDP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Her eyes have a distinct limitation that will prevent her from killing Types. Age.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Emiya can't trace EA</br>  <br>No, Types do not have a concept of death unless they are in the RM of their home planet.</br>  Fate is a clusterfuck of inconsistency because Nasu is an uncaring hack. Enjoy arguing "objectively" over something that objectively has no objectivity.  <br>Probably. Some moons of those are very large after all.</br>  <br><br><br>I thought Void Shiki offering to restore Mikiya's eye was implying she was akind to a god in her connection to the Root</br></br></br>  <br> Primordial Demons <br>Nasu was talking about Cthulu shit when he said that right?</br></br>  <br> falling for cheap bait </br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br>Gods aren't exactly the strongest beings in the Nasuverse.</br>  <br>and that is why I'm still not sure how the Root works exactly</br>  <br>Isn't there a difference between Arcueid 100% (Red Arcueid) and Archetype Earth?</br>  <br>But the Root is not a god.</br>  <br>The root is an automatic system, not god.</br>  <br>I know that, but I thought Void Shiki could control it to some degree or some shit</br>  Shiki  <br>Rewrite or change root archives for existences to a certain degree probably, but she's just an end user not an admin which means that she has limitations on what she can and cannot do.</br>  <br>Even if she could, she's limited by the body of Shiki. Shiki is an inferior container and cannot use Void correctly.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WCj<wbr>P1BFK4vI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>After taking the opponent into outer space, she compresses space time in the palm of her hand, then makes them implode. I would like to see a character top that.</br></br>  <br> they had to Nerf Archetype Earth's Last Arc since it essentially oneshots </br>  <br>Stupidest pasta i ever read</br>  Last Stardust is so damn good.  <br>Shirou is the strongest when fighting for Sakura</br>  <br>The whole album is pretty solid.</br>  <br>Neko Chaos and Neko Arc.</br>  Can't Arc benchpress a moon or some shit?  <br>HF Shirou hardly does anything despite being strong. He kills Berserker, and then gets his ass kicked by Kirei. Kind of a waste.<br><br>UBW Shirou does a lot more fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>Tohno can in fact kill servants.<br><br>When he killed Arcueid, 17 cuts landed in "an instant".<br>This is on the same level as 5th grail war Asassin's Tsubame Gaeshi. This is in fact canon. Not only that, but Arcueid was not able to notice she was being followed, nor feel any killing intent from Tohno until the blade already killed her. This is on the same level as assassin servant presence concealment.<br><br>In the official Tsukihime manga, Shiki was capable of slicing and killing lightning shot at him by Roa. A low estimate of the speed required for this would land at 96,000MPH, which is the atmospheric discharge of lightning at denser levels (closer to lower altitudes.)<br><br>Tying together presence concealment, Zelretch level ability (flash sheath), and A class speed, Shiki could in fact stand a chance against most servants. His trump card that would place him above anything summoned under assassin card would be that he essentially has an instant kill move if he ever gets near, making him a very deadly opponent.<br><br>To use concrete evidence of Shiki proving himself time and time again, we can look at who in fact he has killed.<br><br>Nrvnqsr Chaos the 10th apostle. In one attack Tohno managed to kill all 666 of his lives.<br><br>Michael Roa Valdamjong, said to be immortal by traveling between Akasha and back, "reincarnating". Tohno severed his connection to Akasha, erasing his existence.<br><br>It's good to take note here, that Servants are tied to the Akashic record in the throne of heroes, which is what allows them to be summoned in the first place. When Shiki kills a servant, they can no longer be summoned. Sounds like just the kind of person Archer was looking for.<br><br>In the "Talk" side story for Tsukihime, Tohno manged to kill the forest of Einnashe, the seventh dead apostle. He also managed to kill Einnashe's reality marble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> After taking the opponent into outer space, she compresses space time in the palm of her hand, then makes them implode. I would like to see a character top that. <br>You forget how hax Marble Phantasm is.</br></br>  Y'all think you soooo bad.<br><br>Why y'all think you so bad, huh?</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  Tohno Shiki or Void Ryogi Shiki. I don't care what the fuck Nasu said, the moment the dots are connected, the enemies are killed.<br><br>Their only problem is the lack of attack range, and any faggot with a gun would easily gun them down.</br></br>  <br> this is what Shikifags actually believe </br>  <br>Neko Arc a shit. Riesbyfe literally punched her into the stratosphere.</br>  <br>I think Archetype is cheating.</br>  <br>Except Types have no concept of death.</br>  <br>Of course they do.</br>  <br>Nasu is.</br>  <br>ORT</br>  <br> It is about ten meters. I need two steps to get into knife range. To ensure a kill, I need to take three steps. </br>  <br>So how did Gun God kill them?</br>  Him  Why was Fate Shirou able to kill Kotomine, but HF Shirou, a much stronger Shirou, got his ass kicked?  <br>Level 10 reality warper. Ain't gotta explain shit.<br><br>Jus' do what they do.<br><br>The Neko cast works for NINE HOURS A DAY serving CUSTOMERS. Yeah. That's right. Heartless, godless, unknown-to-death abominations.<br><br>Even Saber Alter at her prime could not manage that for a SINGLE DAY. They do it for at least thirteen or more if you count the OVA.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because HF Shirou got his ass kicked by HF Shirou.</br>  <br>probably one of the types.</br>  <br>Black Barrel is a specialized weapon for killing Types.  Ciel had it just in case Arc went full power. </br>  <br><br>This is a side effect of becoming swords.</br></br>  <br>is there any guy sexier than him in the Nasuverse?</br>  <br>If they can be killed then they have concept of death.<br><br>Shiki just has to focus.</br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot (F-15) &gt; Gilgamesh <br>Whut?</br></br>  <br>OLD</br>  Why is there no Nasu protag with [gun] as his root?

He doesn't jump to servant tier stats or anything, he's not super monster fighting that's a hundred times peak human.<br><br>He's basically just at peak human in terms of ability, as Nasu puts it "Shiki is the two of hearts in card terms, he's not very strong on his own, but he can be strong by piling up trump cards and acting as an assassin". If it was a head on battle almost anyone in his own game would surely kill him, but if he's playing smart he'll find a way to strike first even when outgunned.<br><br>In terms of raw numbers Nero, Roa, Arc, Sacchin, or basically anyone in Tsuki shit all over Shiki.<br><br>Yet Shiki has skill and specialization in a certain way that he's good at dealing with inhumans even if they are far above him in power and everything.<br><br>Its hard for people to get the difference between an Assassin and fighter in terms of style. Assassins are typically outgunned by the things they fight, but through some knowledge or skill they can kill those things even when far overpowered.<br><br>Even a top class Nanaya isn't shit to a demon in power or speed at all, but they have special training that allows them to turn the tides briefly to aim for a kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki literally killed the spirit of a parcel of land.<br><br>The proof of concept is there.</br></br></br>  I thought Shiki was able to kill anything  <br>i'd probably say red archer<br>hes strong as fuck in the show<br>white archer is also strong but red archer has more xp i believe<br>im talking about shirou archer btw</br></br></br></br>  [x] Touch nine fluffy tails  <br>Nasu said he doesn't.<br><br>But I don't believe his fucking words.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you have no concept of death doesn't mean you can't be killed. Shiki can't see lines no matter how much they try to.<br>Look at the Crimson Moon, he got put out by Zelretch when he had no concept of death.</br></br>  <br> as Nasu puts it <br>Stopped reading right there. Use facts to argue instead of a writers shitty and meaningless opinion.</br></br>  <br>Only things with a some concept of death.</br>  <br> Killing a spirit <br> Anywhere near on the same scale as killing the embodiment of an entire planet </br></br>  <br>I remember reading that Shiki would have trouble seeing the lines of powerful entities, i.e. he wouldn't be able to see the lines of night time Arc but he could see her lines in the day time.<br>Shiki can train his eyes and start to see more lines (such as walls and shit) but it would damage his brain.</br></br>  Is a servant's power scaled with their fame or how old they are?<br>If the former is the case, then wouldn't Heracles be stronger than Gilgamesh? Since Herc's myth is generally more well-known than Gil's.</br>  <br>If it bleeds, you can kill it.</br>  <br>Nasu likes to wank Gil. Don't expect shit to make any sense.</br>  <br>Tohnofags are at the top in terms of being the worst at understanding that he's fundamentally weak, or not as strong as they think at all.<br><br>  "At this point, "MELTY BLOOD" caused a major contradiction. <br>Since this was a fighting game, the position of the protagonist, Tohno Shiki, a character that could participate in combat only by means of trump cards, was reversed, and he became involved in the story as a protagonist that can "fight normally".<br><br> "....Right. The characteristics of the characters in "MELTY BLOOD" had either been exaggerated or restrained from what they had been in Tsukihime." <br><br> "Using cards as an example, Shiki of Tsukihime would be a 3 of Hearts. But the Shiki of "MELTY BLOOD" would be able to fight normally as a Jack of Spades." <br><br>They go "Well Shiki can probably kill Shirou, and Shirou is as strong as the strongest servant, so Shiki is stronger than the strongest servant and is as strong as hundreds of humans together"<br><br>Its an entire point that Shirou was never servant tier, even at his peak he says directly he cannot hope to match any servant but Gilgamesh, and he can only match that one due to heavy compatibility match up. Even the anime lays that out for people, that no he cannot match servants. He only had a chance due to the way their abilities matched out. Shirou would lose to probably even Avenger if it came down to it outside of compatibility. <br><br>After hearing that Tohnofags tend to say "&gt;LOL Nasu", "Implying that counts, I don't like it so it doesn't", or something similar to discredit shit when they've lost.<br><br>Then they usually fall into the usual traps of "Implying he's not the strongest character in Type Moon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If something has no concept of death, how can it die?</br>  <br>Its both, I think.<br><br>And an archer Herc would probably be OP as fuck.<br><br><br>Just because you can't "kill it" doesn't mean you can't destroy it with brute fucking force.<br><br>Ain't it how that dude,Ado or whatever, killed types in Notes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing personal kid. <br>The Batwing just solos.</br></br>  <br>Tohno might as well be the strongest glass cannon, until Nasu said lol he cannot kill everything.</br>  <br>You see shit even during his game that he can't kill<br><br>Are you stupid? They bring you through how his ability works, how there's reprocussions, and how he can't see the death on quite everything. Although usually he can force himself to see the death in something by trying to see it harder, which causes his brain to partially explode.<br><br>He can only kill things with a concept of death for starters.<br><br>Any Aristotle would not have a concept of death because they are perfect beings, unless you can forcefully fuck them wit a concept of death like with Black Barrel. A perfect being cannot have a flaw, it cannot have death.<br><br>Arcuied is the exception since holding back almost all of her power all the time causes her perfection to weaken, and even when she wouldn't normally have a concept of death she has one during certain times like during the day time. Although she says she would have no such thing at night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aoko that high </br>  http://pastebin.com/LKnwp3v8<br><br>My favorite overpowered type to date.</br></br>  <br>It forces a concept of death onto them.</br>  <br> You see shit even during his game that he can't kill <br>Like what?</br></br>  <br><br>You don't know shit it turns out<br><br>Q: Who is stronger, Gilgamesh or Arcueid (30%)? While Arcueid has the strength of 4 Servants, I remember there being a scene in hollow implying that Gil was the equivalent of 5 Servants + a.<br><br>A. In the definition of Arcueid's strength, there's this thing where "her output changes according to her opponent". As an absolute order taken from her backup, the planet, she is allowed only an output a little stronger than her opponent. And. Single entity abilities of Arc and Servants are roughly on the same level<br><br>Servants use their respective Noble Phantasms while Arc uses her unlimited backup to fight, and differences occur depending on affinity. A simple-is-best Arc is an all rounder, and so generally her chances of winning are only high, but there are those opponents that she just has helplessly awful compatibility with.<br><br>For example, in cases where even if the guy's stats are about the same as Arc, he has a ridiculously large number of weapons with high versatility. As the amount Arc is allowed to take out is based on "single entity ability", against types like Gil-sama, well, you see?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If we're talking only about EXTRA and CCC, she's (Arcueid ) about the only one who can bring the Golden Fur White Face down "to circumstances where its possible to defeat her, however little the chances may be". <br><br>Caster gets no respect for how powerful she can actually get.</br></br></br>  <br>An object has no concept of death since it's not living in the first place.<br><br>Yet Tohno can still rip them apart.</br></br></br>  <br>Having no concept of death doesn't automatically make you invincible. You can walk up to a vampire in the middle of the night when it is at it's strongest and least likely to die and stab a stake through it's heart and drown it in Holy Water, it'll die. MEoDP isn't an end all ability, everything has shit it's weak to. Brute fucking force happens to be a valid method in most cases.<br><br><br>Ado's sword got bigger depending on which Type he was fighting, the bigger the better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having no concept of death means you have no concept of death.<br><br>Death is an impossibility for you at the conceptual level. Even if the body is destroyed you won't die for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> 30% Arc </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RBi<wbr>G4xwNWdk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Bitch can even hurt types.</br></br></br>  <br>The Types do not have Gaia's concept of death.<br>Shiki can see death because she is connected to Akasha, and therefore by everything that is part of Gaia.<br>Shiki's powers are incompatible with the alien Types.<br><br>Shiki does not literally see "death"; she can perceive something's "lifespan" or something like "the total span of this thing's existence", and with her Mystic Eyes she can eliminate it, and so instantly "killing" it<br>Aristotles do not have this. Even when annihilated by the Black Barrel, their existence does not end. The concept of their existence is a constant, even if the form changes. Arceuid is a similar, but much lesser creature, though in ideal conditions such as her Archetype Earth state she reaches the level of "beyond a concept of death", as would a fully incarnated Type Moon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then they won't die when they are killed.</br>  <br>Something people don't seem to understand; she doesn't just wig out and go SSJ 1000 percent power mode whenever she feels like. She has to hold back all of her power due to blood lust, her sister cut her hair which also weakened her, and an ancestor has this whole thing about how they hate waste so they use just +1 of the target.<br><br>She cannot go 100 percent at will, it requires special situations or her fighting an opponent that is as strong as her full self as her power will be risen up through the Gaia boost to her real self.<br><br>People always go "Pfft, doesn't count, she's clearly not taking it seriously because she's just 30 percent, if she was serious she'd go full power instantly and win in a second against anyone so nothing counts if its 30 percent".<br><br>She cannot go full power SSJ at will, against these types of enemies she needs to use her Gaia boost to go beyond her means, but she cannot do that against Gilgamesh since in terms of power he is not above her even if his power is above her.<br><br>30 percent is the maximum output she can afford as long as certain factors are in play like her holding back her blood lust. If we take personality into account, then its a huge part of her character that she'd rather die than stop holding back her blood lust and become someone else that's not her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It boils down to this.</br></br></br>  <br>Correct<br>Pictured: Type Venus, not dead some time after being killed</br></br>  <br>Types cannot be killed.<br>Even being hit with an arbitrary amount of damage and forcibly given the concept of mortality, Type-Venus did not die. It just stopped moving. In its own words, it could get up and fly away at any time, if it wanted to sacrifice the humans living on its back.</br></br>  <br><br>Planets are so fucking OP in Nasuverse when they are just big celestial bodies damn.</br></br>  <br>"Big celestial bodies" aren't important. When earth's soul dies, earth stops being a relevant location.<br>The important thing is the soul which gives life and meaning to the planets, lifeless rocks don't mean a lot. The planet-souls, however, are a godlike universe unto themselves.</br></br>  <br> Shirou was never servant tier <br>Confirmed for never having read the VN. Archer&gt;Shirou&gt;Gil&gt;Every other servant.</br></br>  <br>Confirmed for never reading the VN.<br>The only servant Shirou can beat is Gilgamesh.</br></br>  <br> Implying Lancer couldn't have wrecked everyone but Hercules if he wasn't literally Command Sealed to job </br>  <br>Bullshit. UBW is a stronger GoB, no matter how much Nasu tries to make Shirou an underdog. He is stronger than Gil and kills him easily. He can do the same to every other servant just like Gil can.</br>  <br>The Fifth Nigga. She went to The Root and came back while retaining her humanity.</br>  <br><br>Fuck I'm not even a huge Type-Moon fan and even I know it's supposed to be one of the Type's which as far as I understand are like living embodiments of the planets.<br><br>Personally though I kind of agree with the old adage from Marvel comics and have even kind of seen it play out in Type-Moon before particularly with the servants and that is that the more limited the power the more overall interesting the character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He would have lost against Archer if Nasu wasn't retarded and contradicting himself. UBW kills every other servant with little effort.</br>  <br> UBW is a stronger GoB <br>No it isn't. Shirou doesn't have literally every weapon ever stockpiled in there. He cannot instantly pull out the counter-weapon to every hero and situation until he has seen every counter-weapon to every hero and situation, and at no point in any of Shirou's lifetime does this happen.<br><br>Willing to bet they didn't even go through 1/1,000,000th of Gil's arsenal in the climactic battle before he decided to pull out Ea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they do you idiot. If it can break, or degrade at all it has a concept of death. Tohno understands the death of objects and so can kill them.</br>  <br>Except she loses control when she takes severe damage as it happened in Ciel's route. When this happens she goes Warcueid and can access 100% of her powers. Whether she likes to or not.<br><br>This is not even getting to the fact that were she to lose herself Archetype Earth would take over as stated in KT and as it happened in Roa's story.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Alaya is in some ways an aspect of Gaia, is Alaya also "dead" in Notes despite humanity's survival?<br>Could a "Type-Man" emerge?</br></br>  <br>Wrong. Archer only has noble phantasms numbering in the thousands. This is not enough to overcome any situation, and only enough to overcome Herakles six times.</br>  <br><br>The fanbase is alright when contained to their own subjects, it's when they try to talk about literally anything else that it's a problem. Some of them are capable of holding their shit together regardless, but others just really take the cake even among obsessive otaku and guess which ones like to hear themselves talk more and are 100% assured of their absolute righteousness.</br></br>  <br>I don't think he would be able to pierce Herc's God Hand with UBW, and Lancer's Protection From Arrows probably gives him an advantage over Shirou. However, you're right I can't see some servants doing shit to him with UBW up, like Fake and True Assassin.</br>  <br> every counter-weapon to every hero and situation <br><br>You say that as if Gill has a counter weapon for everyone wen he doesn't. He has jack shit wen it comes to Karna's kit and its probably the same with Arjuna's Gandiva.</br></br></br>  <br>CCC Gilgamesh sacrificed 9/10ths of his treasury before the start of the game.</br>  <br>TYPES aren't meant to be interesting characters in the sense that they have flaws and goals.<br><br>Its more that they're Eldritch horrors far beyond humanity, to the point that hearing them described is pretty interesting in this post apocalyptic setting where humanity is on its last verges fighting against things that would look down on them as ants.<br><br>When you hear Cthulu described in certain tales of Eldritch beings its pretty monstrous and beyond belief in itself. The setting itself makes them more interesting seeing humanity brought to their limits at the end of the world brought about by these monsters bigger than life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shirou is Type-Man, the embodiment of humanity's hopes, dreams, and desire for justice. </br></br>  <br><br>Honestly everything just kind of stupid when it involves Gilgamesh since his entire power level revolves around the fact that he is supposed to be the first hero and has all these gimmick weapons in his vault to counter others. That's pretty much it, that's his power since otherwise he just sits around and makes smug chatter at the rest of the cast. Nasu REALLY fucked up making him the final boss of most routes since he's just so SNK Boss tier and not really interesting at all.</br></br>  <br>Bitch can time paradox all over to get what she wants. Even Arc doesn't want to deal with that shit if she doesn't have to.</br>  Archer was too busy trying to kill his ideal to shoot NPs like bullets like Gilgamesh does, so Shirou was able to keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Gilgamesh was too haughty and wouldn't recognize Shirou as an actual threat until it was too late, which let Shirou keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Shirou didn't appear capable of minigunning NPs like both Archers could do with GoB or UBW. Shirou really would've gotten his shit pushed in by a Servant who was fighting seriously, because his flesh and blood human body wouldn't be able to keep up.</br></br></br></br>  Ameterasu  <br>If Gil actually bothered to learn and make use of all of the treasures in Gate of Babylon he'd be a hundred times more bullshit than he already is. He could Mega Man nearly every other Noble Phantasm on top of having Ea. You could have Assassin Gil do shit like walk around completely invisible with Hades' Cap of Darkness and shank all the other Servants/Masters with proto-Rule Breaker. Then again there's not much reason to when you could also just brute force everything with Ea, but there's a ridiculous amount of untapped potential beyond "magic Gatling Gun"</br>  <br>Crimson Moon and Archetype Earth do.</br>  <br><br>I like to think of it this way. If Gilgamesh were a character in No More Heroes he'd probably be Million Gunman.</br></br>  <br><br> Ameterasu <br><br>Nigger are you talking about Madara? What level Madara?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course "Type-Moon" is the exception, he's the title character.</br>  <br>I would read the fuck out of that.</br>  <br>That's entirely inaccurate<br><br>Gilgamesh at the end of his route in CCC sacrifices 9/10ths of his treasury to get to the near side of the Moon from the Far side, which is noted to be something of an impossible feat to get past the last firewall. The fact that he did the impossible is just paramount for the character himself, kind of like Karna's feat in the game.<br><br>Gilgamesh broke into the other side of the Moon after he heard that his master from CCC when he made it to the other side of the Moon would be without a servant, he would be deleted the second the Mooncell realizes they're without a servant. His previous servant was a berserker who broke his contract the second it couldn't find him(its thought that his previous servant was Enkidu, since MC during Gil's route has a dream from Enkidu's perspective and even Gil notes that it shouldn't work like that).<br><br>For someone who had gained his interest to that degree he would not allow them to die so readily in such a half assed manner. MC had become basically a treasure worth all of his other treasures, so he wouldn't let them fall so readily<br><br>Although according to Gil hismelf he has an NP that can call back all of his lost NPs into his vault without much effort. So it might not be the biggest loss.<br><br>Gilgamesh even with a fraction of his treasury then finished the contest out on the near side with MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He means the solar goddess of power level 387420489.</br></br>  <br> If Gil actually bothered to learn and make use of all of the treasures in Gate of Babylon he'd be a hundred times more bullshit than he already is. <br><br>He can already do that and has done it a few times<br><br>Usually though he's just like "Mongrel, you're not worth the effort" so he just throws weapons like bullets to the unworthy.<br><br>Against serious opponents he's been known to pull things out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ado's Slash Emperor is pretty much the representation of humanity that thing will use up a whole planet if it needs to.</br>  Gill isn't even the strongest servant.  Fuck your projections  <br><br>Nor is Enkidu.</br></br>  <br><br>Gee you don't say. I always thought it was coincidence that the more he starts to appear in a route the less literally every other servant besides maybe Saber seems to matter.</br></br>  <br>Depending on what we qualify as a "servant", the strongest one should be B.B.</br>   Nasu will never use Hercules as anything but a mad dog <br> He will never be able to fully enjoy a masterful sword fight against Archer <br> He will never bro it up with Shirou <br> He will never slaughter the Einzberns for putting Ilyasveil through hell for the sake of their thousand-year-old hopeless greed <br> He will never be able to protect his daughteru </br></br></br></br>  <br> Rhongomyniad getting a buff  <br><br>Still salty about that.</br></br></br>  <br>Destroying a projection is about as impressive as breaking a vase</br>  <br>Only the best for bestest girl!</br>  <br>If we ever count BB, then nothing else that could be called a servant could ever surpass her. Its like how we usually can't count Gilgamesh among "Who's the strongest", because he just is. You can't count BB because she's just at the top.<br><br>Even Kingprotea is schooled by her in seconds.<br><br>BB and Gilgamesh sort of get along in this way where they're both made out of arrogance and bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Easily the Player who controls the Player Character</br>  <br>He does it against Saber.</br>  Who would win in a Shiki vs Shirou fight?  <br>Shirou.</br>  <br>Double KO.</br>  <br>Shiki.</br>  <br>Shiki kills Shirou but his brain explodes in a straight fight.</br>  <br>Shirou kills Shiki easily.</br>  <br>Shiki would kill Shirou before he realized they were in a fight.</br>  <br>If Shiki doesn't give in to his killing urges: Shirou<br>If Shiki gives in to his killing urges: Shiki<br><br>A lot of people forget that Shiki has a huge mental block that prevents him from going all out unless he's fighting a nonhuman. Shirou might count as a nonhuman being a magus, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki can easily win if he strikes first but in a straight fight he would probably double suicide cutting a BP at point-blank range, or run out of brain before Shirou runs out of mana if he has Rin's crest</br>  <br>I think you meant thick dense plot armor</br>  <br>pls no more. whirreled peas.</br>  <br>Which Shirou?</br>  <br>By my understanding, mankind is collectively sort the REAL Type-Earth, that has rejected its planet's will and created its own. But this isn't something that has even come close to been explicitly stated, and probably never will be.</br>  <br>Emiya Shirou</br>  <br>But are we talking about Master Emiya Shirou? Are we talking about Alternate Prisma Emiya Shirou? Are we talking about Servant Archer EMIYA?</br>  <br> implying Prisma Shirou is even a valid version of him </br>  <br>By "Alternate Prisma" I think he means Miyuverse Shirou, who's well on his way to becoming Archer, but with HF Shirou's mindset.</br>  <br>He is.</br>  <br><br><br>The most powerful and the sexiest</br></br></br>  <br>Sluts aren't sexy.</br>  <br>Of course they are.

In fact, after UBW was cast, Gil had no chance in winning. The fact is that UBW is a hard counter to Gate of Babylon, because it is for all effects and purposes in this matchup an exact copy, just faster. The only hope Gilgamesh has against Shirou is casting Ea immediately, but because of the speed advantage Shirou has, Gilgamesh never got a chance to actually summon and attack with Ea. This caused him to panic and he still knew Ea was his only chance so he tried to us it without actually having an opening to do so. That's what caused him to lose his arm and dig himself even deeper into the hole. If Gil pulled out Ea the moment Shirou cast UBW, then maybe he could have won. Instead, his cockiness let Shirou cast UBW and it only took a moment for Shirou to get his momentum going, at which point he was effectively unstoppable.</br>  <br> In fact, after UBW was cast, Gil had no chance in winning. <br><br>Its shown during one scene that he could have grabbed for Ea in time during the battle, but he hesitated, his pride got the best of him and it cost him.<br><br>Pride is his mortal folly, if Shirou isn't constantly putting on the pressure and the chance exists for him to grab Ea, then its over for Shirou.<br><br>However even when the chance was there, Gilgamesh hesitated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's rock&gt;paper&gt;scissors, retard.<br>Gilgamesh&gt;Servants&gt;Shirou&gt;Gilgamesh<wbr>.</wbr></br></br>  <br>The moment of hesitation was only in the anime. It's a nice way to show Gil's ego without him going HURR DURR MONGRELS AND FAKERS, but not hesitating for that moment didn't help him in the VN.</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  Taiga is the best and cutest Fate girl.  <br>I can agree to best and cutest fate girl if you accept tied for first with Bazett.</br>  When will they fuck? At least give a doujin, don't tell me the japs haven't thought about it.  <br>*give me</br>  <br>They only want The Shirou.</br>  <br>That is acceptable.</br>  <br> if you kill her, you no better than she is. </br>  <br>He never says that, though.</br>  <br>what dose he say?</br>  <br> Prisma isn't canon. </br>  <br> as Nasu puts it "Shiki is the two of hearts in card terms, he's not very strong on his own, but he can be strong by piling up trump cards and acting as an assassin". <br>Nasu NEVER says that. He only says Shiki in Tsukihime wins via trump cards. He becomes a normal fighter in Melty Blood and doesn't have to fight with trump cards. People don't understand this and its in plain fucking Japanese.<br><br>Shiki never fought Nero as an Assassin. It was a straight up battle in Tsukihime too. Nero was never able to fight Shiki in a straight battle. <br><br>He fought Shiki the same way he fought Arcueid and never even touched Shiki. Neither Roa nor Sacchin really shat on Shiki when he was "on" or in "Melty Blood" mode.<br><br>The only ones that have done so were Arcueid and Ciel and Akiha. And Akiha destroyed Roa easily.<br><br> Even a top class Nanaya isn't shit to a demon in power or speed at all, but they have special training that allows them to turn the tides briefly to aim for a kill. <br>If you read Red Demon God, Nanaya Kiri was so fast, Kouma sounded so slow. Kiri exchanged blows with him initially in a direct attack and didn't hit Kiri, and Kiri kept on hitting Kouma for 40+ times without getting hit.<br><br>Kiri calls Kouma slow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magical Amber, the Magical Girl form of Kohaku.<br>Runner ups are Neko-Arc, Neko-Arc Chaos, Taiga and Magical Caren.</br></br>  <br> I'm gonna ignore the author <br>It's as canon to the Nasuverse as Lord of the Flies</br></br>  Soujuurou is confirmed strongest when he stepped down the mountain.  <br>That isn't talking powerlevels.</br>  <br> "The Nasuverse" is one unified canon which Prisma is incompatible with </br>  <br>Kouma the Crimson Red Vermillion who can fight on par with the average servant. God damn son, I need more Nanaya stuff in turkeyhandle remake.</br>  <br>So, it is completely canon?</br>  <br>At this point, "MELTY BLOOD" caused a major contradiction.<br><br>Since this was a fighting game, the position of the protagonist, Tohno Shiki, a character that could participate in combat only by means of trump cards, was reversed, and he became involved in the story as a protagonist that can "fight normally".<br><br>"....Right. The characteristics of the characters in "MELTY BLOOD" had either been exaggerated or restrained from what they had been in Tsukihime." "Using cards as an example, Shiki of Tsukihime would be a 3 of Hearts. But the Shiki of "MELTY BLOOD" would be able to fight normally as a Jack of Spades."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taiga is a qt.</br>   tfw no spin-off with Gilgamesh who is still arrogant but more fun about it <br> I don't even need anything to avoid dying from your spear, Lancer <br> How come my riding skill is higher than yours, Rider?

I don't think I'm the only one who want it but is there's also some anon out there who want a sequel of F/SN? by that I mean a sixth grail war. <br>It can't happen anymore with the heaven feel route but the other two route give the possibility open, it just need to let Rin and Waver fail. <br>It sure would be milking the shit out of the Fate franchise but still, that could be interesting, if it's set ten years later I mean. The cast would be more mature.<br><br>  I want it to be in good old VN format though  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Becomes a quiz show host?</br>  <br>It is until 3rei</br>  <br> or Urubochi </br>  <br>I think only the 3rd war has any real prequel potential. Weren't the first two really fucking short? I know the second was brutal though.<br><br>Honestly a sequel would be really hard.

Avenger was summoned, and the Tohsaka heir got hitched with one of the Edelfelts who joined in.  <br> CCC <br> Strange Fake <br>So you read neither of those?</br></br></br>   this will never be a thing   <br>In terms of in-universe power: Whoever the fuck Nasu hallucinated on his most recent meth binge.<br>In terms of MARKETING POWER, which is all TM really cares about: Saber.</br></br>  <br> yfw Archer didn't stop the nukes </br>  <br>True Demons are above Primordial demons and are type level</br>  <br><br>The first was rather anti-climatic for what I remember, they didn't had yet command seals so then they asked the servant to do their jobs they must had say "lol nope" or something along.<br><br>The second grail war is the most interesting for me. Grail wasn't corrupted yet, it's said it was the most valuable grail war for magi. And then yes, it was apparently by far the most bloodiest of the five.<br><br><br>That's a shame, I would choose the Fate route. It's not my favourite but   Illya would maybe still be alive  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Obviously Fuji-Nee. Tiger Dojo is such a broken Noble Phantasm - it just lets you keep starting over until you win.  <br> Illya would maybe still be alive <br><br>No, she dies a year after the end of the Fate route.</br></br></br>  <br>Replacing the reverse-trap Zero Saber with Mordred might make for an interesting ensemble.</br>  <br>What stops them from getting her a puppet body?</br>  Still waiting on Grand Order.  <br>I think the only one who can do that is Illya herself.</br>  If Goku blew up the planets would the Types die?  <br>I'm not sure, but I'm guessing something would because it would lessen the intent of her only supposed to be living for a year.</br>  Since it's basically a Fate thread, I have a question:<br><br>Is female Gilgamesh canon? I know about Ko-Gil, but I often see images of a female counterpart. (not the chick from Kaleid). If so, where does she come from ?</br></br>  <br>The fact that they only managed to get one for Shirou in HF by sheer, stupid luck.<br><br>Besides, no one except Ilya knew Ilya would die until it would have been too late to do anything about it, and Ilya herself had already accepted her fate.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, fanon.<br><br>Except if you count April fool's Protoreplica anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>She never showed up in anything, but that doesn't make her any less canon.</br>  <br><br><br>What about the ice sword and the other scythe-like weapon he used against Saber in Fate? Can he also use the characteristics of the other NPs?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Goku would end up destroying the planet, as Alaya would chimp out and send every last thing it had to prevent that which would also probably call Type-Earth out.</br>  <br>Is there anything in Type Moon that can even beat Goku?</br>  <br>There's no Type-Earth.<br>No Arcueid isn't one.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and? That entire statement does not say Shiki is only able to fight as an assassin.<br><br>When Shiki fought Nero, it was a full-on fair fight when he became a Jack of Spades temporarily. There was no surprise attack there. Nero was fighting from a distance, had time to release 100 of his beasts, and still got killed by Shiki knowing his ability and speed and other intangibles.<br><br>What Nasu simply says there is that Tsukihime Shiki can't always fight up to MB form, especially since if you read Tsukihime:<br><br>1. He is still under Makihisa's brainwashing<br>2. He doesn't know diddly squat about his lineage and the entire thing lasts a week or so.<br><br>Melty Blood happens quite a bit of time (about a year) after a potential Sacchin Normal and is completely different from Tsukihime where Shiki is surprising himself with revelation after revelation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for the clarification.</br></br>  <br>Shiki, either of them, could potentially kill his ki blasts until he tires himself out, and take him out afterwards. But if Goku goes in to melee before he tires out, they'd lose hard.<br><br>Excaliblast is almost literally the Spirit Bomb, so that might be able to take Goku out.<br><br>Since Ea's maximum output is higher than Excaliblast's, Gil might be able to beat him if he ever get serious.<br><br>Night of Wallachia is literally unkillable outside of certain conditions that require either another millennium to pass, or reality-warping powers. He might then be able to zerg rush Goku with infinite avatars, given time.<br><br>Nrvnqsr could probably devour Goku if he got his hands (so to speak) on him.<br><br>Pale Rider from Strange Fake is practically a hard counter, considering Goku would have died to that heart disease without Trunks' medicine from the future.<br><br>Of course, pretty much all of this is ignoring anything from Battle of Gods on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, Arcueid is de facto Type-Earth. The prefix "Arch" does not mean she's a fake or inferior. It just is there to explain that she's different because of how she's made. Arcueid is so Type Earth, Gaia can take over her in MBAACC.</br>  <br>ORT?</br>  <br> Gaia can take over her in MBAACC. <br>That was not Gaia, nor was it the Crimson Moon. The actual Japanese name for the character, Shinso (True Ancestor) Arcuied, should tell you what she really was.</br></br>  <br>Archetype is a word, you know?<br>Do you know what it means, perhaps?</br></br>  <br>But Rin transfers Shirou's soul from the "container" into the puppet body<br><br> The fact that they only managed to get one for Shirou in HF by sheer, stupid luck. <br>There are tons of puppet bodies.<br>They were lucky that they found one made by Touko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one with the highest potential. You see Gil being a confirmed pleb at the end of CCC when he met the alien race. Lancelot can just hijack the aliens weapons.<br><br> Unlike how the golden knight owned numerous Noble Phantasms, Berserker’s Noble Phantasm is endless. </br></br></br>  Why is Shinji nowhere to be seen in Prisma again?<br>Does the Matou household even exist there?</br>  <br> Prisma <br> making sense </br></br>  <br>He has no practical way to beat some shit. While he has the POTENTIAL to beat almost anything with good prep, with a retard Master like Illya, all there is is brute force, and some Servants just have some concepts that brute force alone can't beat.</br>  <br>Ilyaverse Sakura is a Matou, but that's literally all the mention there has ever been of the Matou or Makiri families in Prisma. Miyuverse Sakura wasn't even named.</br>  <br>We don't even have a color image of Sakura in the series, so for all we know she was never wormed.</br>  Shinji is a magical girl, too. The best magical girl.  <br>While that is true, I don't think her hair is shaded like any other brown- or black-haired character in the manga. It's PROBABLY purple, but even if it is that doesn't automatically mean worms. Maybe something else changed her hair color. Maybe she dyes it to get senpai to notice her.</br>  <br> Against serious opponents he's been known to pull things out. <br>Like True Archer, right?</br></br>  <br>The body is True Ancestor Arcueid, the being inside was Gaia. If you read the story mode, it is revealed and you'll know it says that the power being controlled by that TA Arc is higher than what Arcueid is supposed to have.<br><br><br>I know what Archetype means. I also know that Type means differently from type.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah it doesn't imply that. In the main verse if Arcueid loses her identity she'll become Archetype Earth, which is already the Crimson Moon equivalent as Nasu stated.<br><br>Notes is implied to be an alternate world, like Tsuki no Sango.</br></br></br>  <br> That was not Gaia, nor was it the Crimson Moon <br><br>Play the route before you talk out of your ass. She is called the Brain of the Planet and the "equivalent" of the Crimson Moon. She also refers to the Earth itself as her body, the atmosphere as her limbs, etc. Yes, she is effectively Type Earth.<br><br>The Arche before Type is just there to clarify what Type means, not to show she is different from other Types. It refers the Jungian Archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are they really going to wait until the 31st to release Grand Order?  <br>Archetype is a reality warper with control over space and time. Pretty sure Goku can't beat her.</br>  <br>He pulls out Merodach after the GoB spam.</br>  <br> She also refers to the Earth itself as her body, the atmosphere as her limbs, etc. <br>When was this? I know it's said in the route that AT has higher clearance than Arcueid does, but I don't seem to remember this one.</br></br>  <br><br>Well Sakura's hair goes pretty long. They still have her cowlick, purple hair, same measurements, and iconic ribbon. The differences are a bit of length and a smudge of lighter purple.<br><br>But when you have such a good foundation, you don't have to change much, heh. You see a lot of Sakura montages in fanart, pic related.<br><br>But I do wonder why Nasu doesn't bother exploring some of her greater powers? I mean, beyond the blackening of Servants, everything she does in HF are part of her natural power set. Transporting through shadows to long distances and holding stuff in alternate dimension where time has no meaning, and it seemed like whatever she wants can happen in there. She can also make clones of herself and send her consciousness through them. And she learned these things as naturally as breathing. <br><br>Perplexes me he doesn't bother exploring these interesting facets of her patchwork body of Binding Matou/Grail/Imaginary Element Tohsaka.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But I do wonder why Nasu doesn't bother exploring some of her greater powers? <br>Because she doesn't have them<br>All powers she uses in HF are a mixture of using Angry Manjuice and being able to massively regenerate while constantly using circuits on maximum capacity.</br></br></br>  <br>She commands the Earth to stop rotating by calling it her body if you lose to her in the last fight. When Arcueid beats (more like beats her own body) she says it doesn't matter if the limbs of an incarnation get beaten up, because her real limbs are the Earth's atmosphere.</br>  <br>No to all of them, they cant match Gokus speed. but BB rips Goku a new one though.</br>  <br><br>It is kind of odd people call that an asspull, when it expressly says Sakura used up all the money she had and they took a year just to find a used model in an empty storehouse. They went broke for leads in the underground and a thrift model.</br></br>  <br>I remember someone said Zelretch is stronger than Moon and Moon is strongest Type overall.<br>ORT is only strongest on Earth IIRC.</br></br>  <br><br>All that AM gave her is the blackening and a giant surplus of magical energy, the latter she has anyway post route due to being connected to the Astral Plane. Literally everything else is her own powers, that was the point of why the hybrid is so powerful. Imaginary Numbers naturally has the alternate dimension where time flows differently. Strangely, most people think that is AM.</br></br>  <br>So is Shiki literally fucking the earth?</br>  <br>Ah, so it's the final fight quotes. Thanks.</br>  <br>Shiki is having sex with three beings at the same time when he's dicking Arcueid.<br><br>1. Arcueid<br>2. Crimson Moon Shard<br>3. Gaia</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Zelretch was not fighting a serious Crimson Moon. CM basically jobbed to Zelretch, and even with that, CM still managed to vampirize Zelretch as he died in battle.</br>  <br>Does that count as a 4some?</br>  <br>Arcueid's head must be noisy as fuck with all three of them making mental grunts and noises with each pump Shiki does in her.</br>  <br>It probably works like Namekian Fusion in DBZ Abridged.</br>  <br><br>If Mikiya is fucking the Root, and Shiki's fucking the Earth, what the hell are Shirou and Shizuki fucking?</br></br>  <br>Tohno Shiki is actually connected to the Root as well.<br><br>Saber is a DRAGON</br></br></br>  <br>King Arthur and Alice.</br>  <br>The most impressive fucking Shirou does is the time traveling SheKing.</br>  <br>Yeah, one must be connected to the Origin to have Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</br>  <br> Time-traveling King Arthur <br> Top 100 alltime of the Magic Association magus <br> All the World's Evil </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;All the World's Evil <br>As if, it was only its shadow. Kirei was the only one who had a good chance at dicking it.</br></br>  <br> Embodiment of Gaia/Last True Vampire <br> French Roa Church Executor  <br> Tohno Demon Heir <br> Maids </br></br></br></br>  <br> Dream familiar </br>  <br>Meh it's<br> Last TA <br> Immortal Currybutt from the Burial Agency <br> Demon Hybrid <br> Maid <br> raped Maid </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Then who did this Arthur fuck?</br></br>  <br>I can't even read jap so just give me the OP.</br>  <br>Probably literally who.</br>  <br> died <br>He really died? Or just "died"?</br></br>  <br>Akiha is not just a hybrid, she is the king of hybrids in Japan. That's something which their family controls, aside from being a corporate boss of a family owned keiretsu.</br>  <br>Kouma is closer to Crimson Red Vermillion than her, though she has more aptitude for it.</br>  <br>Died. Though shards of him stay in every True Ancestor that existed, he will never be resurrected even if any of the shards become Type-Moon.</br>  <br> she is the king of hybrids in Japan <br>Not exactly<br>She's the head of a few-clans/subclans but the Tohnos only got into a little bit higher position by setting up a different family to be wiped out by Kiri Nanaya</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he fight for real?<br>Don't tell me he wants to die or something. Or did he fooled around and caught off gaurd like Gilga?</br></br>  Jobbed like Gilgamesh  <br>He literally dropped the moon in Zelretch and the fucker send it back. Zelretch is just OP as fuck.</br>  <br>It got blindsided by the second magic.<br> Kinda like Gil with UBW </br></br>  <br><br>Just "died". He'll be back in the year 3000.</br></br>  <br>So is Zelretch stronger than him?<br>Who is the strongest Type anyway?<br>ORT? Didn't Notes or something said that there's something stronger than ORT?</br></br></br>  Can we all agree that Altrouge is best girl?  <br> So is Zelretch stronger than him? <br>No, just caught him off guard. "Stronger" than an aristoteles is an impossibility.<br> Who is the strongest Type anyway? ORT? Didn't Notes or something said that there's something stronger than ORT? <br>Probably ORT, as it is described as "attack-type" implying it's truly made for combat. If not ORT, whatever Nasu was hinting to be stronger than ORT in ORT's description, which has not been revealed.</br></br></br></br>  Arcueid vs the sun, who wins?  <br>No, type-moon was most definitely stronger, he just failed to understand what Zelretch was doing until it was too late, also, to stop the moon Zelretch had to put so much effort that he fucked his body.</br>  <br>Altrouge a shit!<br>A SHIT!</br></br>  <br>Shit taste. She is obviously best girl. Lorelei a shit.</br>  <br>The guiding principles that exist within Arcueid won't become Type Moon, since she is already the Brain of the Planet and Archetype Earth.</br>  <br>I'd bet on Type-Sol beating Type-Earth</br>  <br>But what if she attacks at night?</br>  <br> since she is already the Brain of the Planet and Archetype Earth. <br>No she isn't, she has to retrieve her stolen hair from Altrouge for that to happen.<br>MBAA was just a nightmare from Dust of Osiris' TATARI.</br></br></br>  <br> she has to retrieve her stolen hair from Altrouge for that to happen. <br>I would love to see her try. Arc vs Primate Murder when?</br></br>  Arcuid looks cool. Is Tsukihime good? Better than FSN? Better than KNK? Should I read the old VN? What about the remake?<br><br>Note: Didn't like Fate, UBW was passable, and HF was surprisingly pleasant.<br><br>Tsukihime anime when?<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd bet Arc would win. Primate Murder is unsurpassed at killing humans by anything other than Angra Mainyu, but only at killing humans. Arc is far more powerful than a human.</br>  <br> Arcuid looks cool <br>Opinion on vents and skirts?</br></br>  <br>Yes, you might like it more, depends, yes, play it after playing the original.<br><br>After the remake is out most likely.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop posing Strout and/or Svelten,</br>  <br>I doubt, it need 7 counter force to just hold PM down, Arc(30%) is "only" 4 servants strong.</br>  <br>Yes<br>No<br>Maybe<br>Yes<br> Remake <br> getting released this decade </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she has to retrieve her stolen hair from Altrouge for that to happen <br><br>That's only for Arcueid's body to become that form. Nothing about Archetype taking over. Roa himself said AE can claim Arc's body as her own if Arc loses herself, which is probably what happened in Roa's story mode.<br><br> MBAA was just a nightmare from Dust of Osiris' TATARI <br><br>There is not a single reference to Archetype being there due to Tatari's influence. She fucking kills Dust of Osiris and Riesbyfe before her final fight and there is not a singel allusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Arcuid looks cool. Is Tsukihime good? Better than FSN? Better than KNK? Should I read the old VN? <br>Yes.<br><br> What about the remake? <br>It won't be out for a while, you're better off reading the original and waiting like the rest of us.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br>Depends on your taste<br>Depends on your taste<br>Yes<br>You will probably die from old age before it gets released</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Merem. Gransurg is better than you and everyone know.</br>  <br>Arc is only that strong without planet back up.</br>  <br>Stop shitposting and get back to work Blackmore.</br>  <br>So the question is, would the planet back up Arc when she is literally fighting it's "defense system" against humans?</br>  <br>ED<br>GY</br></br>  <br>Arcueid*<br>What do you mean anon?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I see. Will start the VN then. Thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If I dislike ubw, is there a chance I'll like kara no kyoukai or is it basically the same?  <br>She lost the air vents and big skirt in the redesign of the remake.</br>  <br>Arc has the Brain of the Planet as an aspect of herself, and she backs her up in every fight (see Arc's Last Arc). You tell me who the planet would choose to back up.</br>  <br>Yes, they are nothing alike.</br>  <br>Well why do you dislike UBW?</br>  <br>KNK is a bit closer to Tsukihime or Heavens Feel than UBW</br>  I'm not a fan of getting all these "I didn't like x will I like y" into Nasuverse interested. These are the types that will argue that whatever they like is what should be discussed and everything else isn't really part of the Nasuverse and should be ignored.  <br>Nah, more like, those kind of people should just watch/read/play Y anyway and see if they enjoy it.</br>  <br>"Murder is wrong" and "If you're going to kill her, I'd rather do it myself." There is more, but that's the gist of it.</br>  If 30% arc is worth 4 servants of stats, then why couldn't 15 servants match 100 Arc?  Pick the worst TM topic<br><br>1. power level<br>2. waifu war<br>3. zero vs stay night</br></br></br></br>  <br>How fast even is Goku? Only thing I remember about speed is that it would take Android 17 &amp; 18 a few minutes to arrive somewhere, and Kuririn at max speed is a bit faster than Bulma's mini-plane. So how fast is Goku?</br>  <br>2&gt;1&gt;3</br>  <br>They probably can. I don't know about Archetype Earth though, since she is able to warp reality.</br>  <br>2=3&gt;1</br>  <br>3&gt;2&gt;1<br>The powerlevel shit is interesting sometimes, waifu haters will hate, but Zero vs. Stay is the most retarded argument I've ever seen in TM threads. This is including faggotry such as Shiki-fags and anime-only ignorance.</br></br>  <br>Faster than light if we believe in that one comment from Butter or whatever is his name from the Ginyu's team.</br>  <br>3. Easily.</br>  <br>Gotenks can fly around the planet a couple hundred times within 5 minutes casually, Goku is far stronger than that at this point.</br>  <br>Because</br>  <br>Two servants can match 30% Arc. She's a single target combatant and heroes working in tandem can accomplish some amazing bullshit.</br>  <br>What's the comment? Can you link to the page in the manga?</br>  <br>Current DBS god tiers are billions of times the speed of light since Bills physically crossed several thousand lightyears without teleportation or magical artifacts.<br><br>Before that saga they could only fly at thousands of times the spoeed of sound but had enough reflexes to dodge relativistic attacks.</br></br></br>  <br>Source on that?</br>  It should be noted that Nasu was talking about an average servant. Cu and Rider working together wouldn't be the same as Berserker and Gil working together.  <br>The manga? And Goku is stronger as stated in the new movies</br>  <br>I have yet to discover the character, but I've always seen images of Arcueid with her long skirt. Her long skirt is basically one of her signatures, I'm not a fan of changes that alter a character's trait.<br><br>I don't dislike her long skirt tbh. Mini skirt feels odd, but I can accept it.<br><br>Now, I haven't played the game, so I'm not really impacted by these changes. I wonder how the fans of Tsukihime fans think about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Bills literally a god though? Has Goku actually ever shown to be comparable to Bills in anything?<br><br>Where the hell do you get that they're that fast? What relativistic attacks are you talking about?<br><br><br>I mean the chapter or page in the manga. And wasn't there a regular guy near everyone else during his battle with Bills who could follow everything with his eyes?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally dislike the changes made to her hairstyle and clothing on a personal basis. The new art my have superiority from a technical standpoint, but it's too similar to his other designs and honestly from the remake I want Tsukihime, not new characters who have the same names and actions as the old ones. It is possible to touch up a design on a technical level without actually changing it.</br>  <br>He never used term average servant anywhere, it's Servant with average NP but in Arc comparison he only said Servants nothing more</br>  <br>No mention in how time it took, probably not much though.</br>  <br> salty Sakurafags using Shirou's thoughts about Saber to their own salty delusions. </br>  <br><br>It was one minute, but since you asked this question you probably shouldn't doubt DBZ power levels, they have casual star busters</br></br>  <br> a couple hundred times <br> picture shows less than a dozen <br>Piccolo says they only had a minute left of fusion. How much do they have total?</br></br></br>  <br>Forgot scan</br>  <br>Goku and Vegeta are a match for Bills if they work together (not fusing) so they need to be at least that fast to touch him.<br>Also Toriyama puts their powers to scale with SSJGod being a 6 and Bills being a 10.</br></br>  <br>You realize this version of Gotenks is weak shit right? This was pre Rosat and isnt evn comparable to even mid Buu saga characters. To put it in perspective, this Gotenks after training has 2 more powerups and even then he isnt near Buu who isnt near Bills</br>  <br>DBZ characters have never shown to have attacks that could blow up stars. The way the destroy planets is by making a really dense and really potents blast/ball of ki, then sending it to the core of the planet to get the planet to essentially destroy itself.<br><br><br>Doesn't change the fact that this is the only thing that actually shows how fast he is, and if it takes him a minute to go that many times around the Earth, he isn't anywhere near lightspeed. He would have to multiply his power a ridiculous amount of times so he could go at light speed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki.</br>  <br>Isn't the Dragon Ball universe really tiny compared to ours though? Like, I remember that there was a drawing that had the universe placed inside a sort of dome.</br>  <br>First of all Bills was stated to be a star buster, and Kid Buu never did as you said, he just destroyed a planet that could be 10x the earth casually. Not that it matters no one in Fate is even capable.<br><br>DBZ characters arent light speed, but they dont have to be to kill any Fate characters or do you actually think what SSJ1 pre Rosat Gotenks isnt fast enough? After Rosat Gotenks became 50x stronger based on SSJ multipliers, you can check plenty of these battle threads that exist over the internet since its too long to pull up sources and explain to someone who has 0 clue about DBZverse</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama has absolutely no idea what "scale" is.</br>  <br>No idea if the translation is correct, though.</br>  <br>At this point, I'm not even speaking from a Fate V. DBZ standpoint. I'm just curious.</br>  <br> I remember that there was a drawing that had the universe placed inside a sort of dome. <br><br>Which is not to scale, canonically the universe is tiny but still houndred of thousands lightyears wide since it has 4 galaxies.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably the same size. It still takes a good deal of time to travel even in ships that go way faster than the speed of light.</br>  Gilgamesh can kill planets.  <br>Shirou can kill Gigameshes.</br>  <br>Shirous don't kill people, swords do.</br>  <br>Shirou is a sword, so Shirou kill people;</br>  <br><br><br><br> fuck off </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh can fuck off.</br>  naruto touma urameshi  <br>Why don't you fuck off?</br>  Still want a spin-off of Saber and Shirou resembling "Monty Python and the holy grail" With saber hopping through Fuyuki, shirou behind her clapping the coconuts.<br><br>Also, what class would the brave sir robin be?</br></br>  <br>If its anywhere that isn't a completely open field, Shiki.<br>Even then, Shiki would still win but he would die from self-inflicted wounds.</br></br>  <br> Isn't there a difference between Arcueid 100% (Red Arcueid) and Archetype Earth? <br><br>Yes, Archetype Earth has 100% of Arcueid's own power PLUS backup from the planet providing that sweet +1.</br></br></br>  <br>Regular Arc already has that +1 thing. Archetype has higher authority than Arc which translates to her being able to shape reality as she sees fit.</br>  <br><br>Who are you quoting?</br></br>  So should i watch KnK movies in release\chapter order(1-7,remix,epilogue)?<br><br>I am thinking to do that but description mentioned a specific order so i am not so sure now.</br></br>  <br>Release order, always.</br>  <br>I always do it in release order but this one time i wondered that maybe this might be a special case. Thanks man, gonna have a comfy night.<br><br> Doubt studio would mess up order of chapters anyway so it was a really stupid question. </br></br></br>  <br>Regular Arc has her restriction and backup + the loss of her hair and Roa power<br>Red Arc has no restriction (except under TATARI) or backup + the loss of her hair and Roa power<br>Optimal Arc would have her restriction and backup + her hair and Roa power, having a higher authority from being equivalent to AE<br>AE is unknown if she is restricted due to bloodlust and should have backup</br></br></br></br>  How terrible will be the shitstorm when Zwei form Illya overpowers a serious Gil using Ea at max rev?  <br>As terrible as hurting this onee-chans feelings</br>  <br>He admits right after that being partially incarnated means he wasn't fully up to snuff, so most people don't care.</br>  <br><br>They don't care about that, Shirou Vs Gilgamesh was, is, and will always be the main issue.</br></br>  <br>KnK is not on chronological order so it's a understandable mistake.</br>  <br> Optimal Arc <br> having a higher authority from being equivalent to AE <br><br>No. Golden Age Arc =/= AE. The hair she lost isn't what gives her higher authority.<br><br> AE is unknown if she is restricted due to bloodlust and should have backup <br><br>Are you really questioning this? AE wouldn't be restricted on account of her guiding principle being that of the Crimson Moon and being the fucking planet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a profile translation that says Arc with hair = AE.</br>  <br>The profile says only her body would be the same. Not that she would have AE's authority.</br>  <br> Imaginary Numbers naturally has the alternate dimension where time flows differently. Strangely, most people think that is AM. <br><br>Well the little people know about IN is vague at best, and most skip over the text calls her a shadow user with the alignment of IN. IN was known in the community as "effective against spirits" and that was it.<br><br>It wasn't until a still not well known blip from the defunct mobile site about a magus at the Click Tower with the same elemental affinity that you got the information regarding time affecting pocket dimensions with it. Then you remember the bad ends in HF affecting it clicks.</br></br></br></br></br>  Arc gets impaled by the original Gae Dearg and Buidhe, what happens?  <br>She is most likely immune to those curses since the only curses/magics she says she isn't immune to is certain shinto artifacts and south american treasures.</br>  <br><br>Does Lancelot not understand weapons beyond "THING USED FOR SWINGING AROUND UNTIL SOMETHING DIES" or is his ability just limited to that?<br>I recall him using it on a Jet or something and that was while berserk.<br><br>Wiki says he can do it with anything he grabs hold of that can even be remotely conceptualized as a weapon but something like an aircraft carrier won't work because HE sees it as a more a transportation tool than a weapon.<br>It also says if he was skilled in wrestling he could do it with a steel chair although ordinarily he would see it as a more of a tool for sitting.<br><br>So it seems what he can and can't use it on is all about his perception. This thing could be stupidly overpowered with great willpower, like if he started viewing servants as weapons of the masters then he could probably hijack them.<br>The real question is would it work with Types?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>is there one of these for cu?</br></br>  "IT" has a horse pussy.

Except it's way bigger, way deeper, and squeezes harder.<br><br>If a hot centauress was waving that shit around I'd make some bad fucking decisions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Careful man, being friendly is one thing, but /a/ hates other boards better ones like /tg/   </br>  <br> It's probably the closest analog in the animal kingdom to a human vagina <br>Nah, that's sheep.</br></br>   my dick when suu spoke   Does anyone else think this show would be better if the girls weren't monsters?<br><br>Like, it was just 4-5 girls living in a big house all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  Even more disgusting are humans. <br><br>They use the same slimy hole filled with tiny parasites to consume corpses AND show affection to their loved ones. <br><br>When they are happy (or trying to threaten someone) they open that rotten hole and bare a set of pointy objects meant for ripping and mincing.</br></br></br></br>  How flexible is she? <br><br>If she could curve her horse body in a v shape, then lean her human body backwards, a human might be able to make out with, fondle, and enter a centaur all at the same time. Just like they would with a human woman.</br></br>  <br><br>How does she wipe her ass when she shits?</br></br>  <br>It would be the same shit. Literally the same shit, nothing would be different other than HOW they hurt Darling.  It would have to take place somewhere like Saudi Arabia though, so the women would have to go outside accompanied by Darling or a male escort. </br>  is there a translation for the slime species screen yet?<br><br><br>No, go fuck yourself, there are literally a thousand shows like that already.</br></br></br>  <br> that baby horse <br>you have no one to blame but yourself.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, check the archive for previous threads. I saw one around 2PM pacific I think.</br>  <br>found it quick, thanks</br>  <br>Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but really hairy and with extremely long nipples. It's fucking nightmarish.<br><br>Cerea, I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but...with extremely long nipples. <br><br>What part of this sounds bad?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you doing this to flare my autism?</br>  <br>holy fuck, pink slime please</br>  <br>yes they are disgusting,but<br> lay eggs </br></br>  <br>puffy pussy</br>  <br> that thumb <br>Hang on. I don't understand her anatomy. <br>Are harpies part bird, or do they have bat wings, but with feathers?</br></br></br>  <br>More like pseudo-hands. She's got a thumb of sorts, and can grip things, but she doesn't have a proper hand.</br>  <br>Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now.</br>    <br><br>I feel like Centaur's Worries had a much less disgusting explanation for this.</br></br>  Cerea Worries crossover when?!  <br>How's a magic sphincter disgusting. People would pay money to have one genetically added</br>  <br>I more meant that the explanation itself was grossing me the fuck out, not the fact that it's a sphincter that works really well.</br>  <br>Maybe when CW becomes poplar<br>i.e. never</br></br>  <br>mmm, pulsating overlapping sphincter control</br>  <br> Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now. <br>In the end the decision was to let Papi grasp things. Having characters with no legs is one thing, but no hands is another matter that would cause difficulties.</br></br>  <br>she's a Deep One. gotta go Deep</br>  <br>  ;___;  </br>  How does Cereal wipe her ass?  <br>Much better now.</br>  <br>With a clean cloth, and a stick.</br>  <br>Hi, /co/  or possibly /v/. </br>  <br>Did you read/watch the manga/anime? Cerea said it herself.</br>    <br>dolphins are still better</br>  <br>I'm team Miia, but Cerea's not a bad choice. <br><br>Also, if the BR/DVD doesn't have that goddamn shedding scene (or if it doesn't magically appear in the next episode or as an extra or something) I'm petitioning another goddamn Fatman be dropped on those fucking Nips.</br></br></br>  <br>please enlighten a non-mangafag fellow anon, what is the shedding scene</br>  <br> Miia burns her hand while trying to cook a meal for darling. Because of this, she can't shed her skin on her own which is a very personal act for a Lamia, especially when you recall that stimulating the tip of her tail can make her orgasm. Darling helps her out and everything is going okay until he remembers he has to remove the skin near her vagoo. Miia becomes more embarrassed and uses her tail to keep Darling from seeing her sensitive spot. This leads to Darling accidentally fingering her, prompting a shocked Miia to involuntarily snap Darling's neck. </br>  <br>  Read the manga.  </br>  <br>So you'd never do anal?</br>  <br>I'd a Cerea ass.</br>  <br>rip darling. any chance you know what chapter it is?</br>  <br>On the contrary, I'd pound that flank like there's no tomorrow.</br>  <br>nvm found it</br>  <br>It's been a while, but it's one of the earlier ones, like right around or before they meet Suu.</br>  <br> that music that played when suu was introduced </br>  <br>Well that explains Wales</br>  <br>And New Zealand.</br>  <br> Nice! <br>Crab is too based.</br></br>  <br>They need that scene to explain Miia's shedded skin that she kept in the laying egg chapter though.<br>But who knows, maybe they'll skip that part too.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I bet her reactions to her first asspounding would be both delicious and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that Mero would be best girl either way.</br>  Rachnee being drunk of caffeine is a confirmed biological fact right? Are spiders really supposed to get wasted on the stuff?  <br>Can you guys stop? There's way too much blood rushing to my dick right now.</br>  <br>what about shark grills</br>  <br>qt sharks are great.</br>  <br>All?</br>  <br>fag.</br>  <br>How much do I have to pay to get a finjob with her pelvic fins?</br>    <br>So Red, Green and Black Slimes are unfuckable? Why would anybody like a non pink or standard one.</br>  <br><br>Crab genuinely loves what he does.<br><br>Monster Musume may be ecchi harem shit of the most obvious variety, but it's a labor of love and every panel shows it.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  monster girls are disgusting  <br>no u</br>  <br>Not really look at the art from the first few chapters where hewent all out and compare them to the most recent ones. Not only did he get lazy as he went on but he also hasn't improved much at all since his webcomic days.</br>  <br>LSD is surprisingly good.</br>  <br> They breathe water through their gills. <br>At least do your research crabman</br></br>    <br>He's probably just some up his own ass prick that can't eat eggs because "where they come from". Fucking stupid.</br>  <br> what is couples yoga. </br>    <br>There's that one image on the boorus where Cerea and Hime bump tips, but that's about it.</br>  <br>BRB Gotta go to Kurusu's house to lend him a jetpack before shit's start going down with Murderfish</br>  <br>Imagining her facial expressions and grunts as you slowly bottom out in that huge rump, feeling your hips mashed against hers does that to me too.</br>  <br>fuck you, cunt. mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas when they're in heat is a natural wonder of the world, and deserves to be respected</br>  <br>Not him, but not fond of assplay. Straight vanilla for me, while she repeatedly slams my balls with that winking clit.</br>  I haven't read the manga in ages. is there a werewolf yet?  <br>no.</br>  <br>well thats disappointing. someone get ahold of me when theres a cute wolf girl making awoos</br>  <br>There's a cute kobold girl if that tickles your fancy.</br>    <br>thats ok I guess.</br>  <br> mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas <br> Natural wonder of the world <br>Not that i have anything against horse pussy and Cerea,but the "wonder of the world part" obliterated my sides to oblivion.</br></br></br>  <br>Oldschool kobold. As in dog person. Speaking of that, how did the kobold transition from dog people to jew lizards?</br>  <br>You want disgusting? Lamia is over 7m long. 5.5-6 of those meters are constantly dragged through the streets. Those same 5.5-6m then coil around you in bed. A bath before sex might help, I guess, but she still has to drag that into your home. Or wrap around your neck when she wants to drag you somewhere.<br> But the streets of Japan are clean! <br>What about public restrooms? Even if she herself doesn't go in them(or like that MS Paint an anon drew illustrated, she simply lifts her tail tip all the way to the bowl to empty her cloaca), other people drag those same restroom germs onto the streets, where she picks them up. A Lamia waifu would be a germophobe's ultimate nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone liked lizards more I guess</br>    <br>Head over to Jitsu Wa Watashiwa</br>  <br> Birds shits, pee and lay eggs from the same hole. Ultra disgusting. <br>You can fuck her and have vaginal and anal sex pretty much at the same time. I find it cool.</br></br>  I find Cerea disgusting. Don't have problem with Rachnee, she's hot.    <br>That's why Suu is best.</br>  I love horse pussy. It's so damn erotic, and the donut buttholes are great too.  <br><br>Z-ton will make you love horse pussy.<br><br> http://i.imgur.com/YJkKJZz.jpg </br></br></br></br>  Which monster girl would be the least disgusting IRL?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128742869   <br>Dullahan probably.

But Suu can be best girl too as long as she mimics her.</br>  <br>Mero if you're both in the water.<br>Miia would do it for me personally.<br>Manako the Cyclops overall. I mean, she's just a normal girl who happens to only have one eye.</br></br></br>  Cerea is mai waifu  <br>Try searching horse and dress.</br>  <br>that tails never been cleaned, its matted rotting and caked in years of horse shit</br>  <br> what is wading into a swift stream </br>  i think this is my new fav thing on /a/. its like /a/ is eating itself  <br><br>Huh? What?</br></br>  <br>Isn't there a lamia/harpy/centaur one like this?</br>  <br>its hated a loved by the same ppl that flip flop on it.</br>  <br> its <br> a <br> ppl <br>What a shitty fucking post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda depends on the context. But realistically, Kobolds seem to be able to effortlessly function in a human based society. (can clean themselves without help, use doors and human clothing etc)<br>I'm more of a dragon girl fan myself, but since dragon-newt a shit, I'm holding out that crab will show us a real dragon some time soon.</br></br>  <br> irony </br>  <br>Actually, now that i think about it, Yuki-onna and fox girl are pretty easily able to function in society too. Tree girl as well. I think Darling really just got the rejects of the monster girl world.</br>  <br>I like poisoned and carbonated Suu more.</br>  <br>I would like black slime, if i wouldn't get cancer.</br>    Best girl  <br>God why those crippled looking fish limbs?</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bpI<wbr>m4SWOI34</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br> its matted rotting and caked in years of horse shit <br>Horses never get shit on their tail.<br>Their anus is also a self-cleaning wonder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sort of like a bat.</br></br>  Can Miia unhinge her jaw? How large of an object can she eat in one bite?  <br>Snakes don't unhinge their jaws.</br>  <br>They can open them up pretty wide though, otherwise they couldn't eat mice.</br>  anyone else completely disgusting by the centaur chick? every time i see her, her fucking ears and just the whole horse part of her elicit a profound sense of revulsion deep inside me. <br>And it's none of the other girls in the show, just her<br>why?</br></br>  <br><br>Centaur's worries went off the fucking rails. I think the mangaka might have had legitimate mental issues. There was so much weird fetishy shit, not like monster-girl fetishism but weird piss/vagina/yuri fetishism and that fucking random political commentary. I dropped that shit.</br></br>  Cerea and rachnee would be so much better as lamias.<br>Mero would be so much better as either a lamia or a Arachne.<br>Miia and Papi are better off not even existing.</br></br>  <br>So, where is her actual vagina? Is it on her human side crotch or horse side rump? Or does she have both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128754135 <br>FACKING NORMIE GET OUT</br>  <br>PTSD. Centaur stampede killed your family.</br>  <br>The only reason that anybody makes a fuss about it is due to the direct real world connection.

LSD looks like a poorly light closeup of the normal web to me. Wonder who funded that study?</br>  So why didn't Suu die in the ocean last chapter?  <br>She was wearing a Drysuit. She still reacted.</br>  <br>Horse pussy is no meme anon. Though other monmusus have human pussy as far as i am aware.</br>  <br>Hows the weather in wales?</br>  <br><br>but bird doesn't have bird legs or torso, her body is human except her arms. she's the only musume with a human hoohah.</br></br>  <br>All of them except Suu and Horse have regular ones as far as we know. I guess Polt could have a dog pussy.</br>  <br><br>She has bird legs.</br></br>    <br>1) Your mom was frightened by a Donkey Show while carrying you.<br>2) Genetic memory of a ancestor's life spent being Mongol Whored.<br>3) Everyone but you got ponies at their birthday party.<br>4) That trip to the Agricultural Fair that no one in the family will ever discuss.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have beard legs.</br>  <br>implying cucklord is ever bestgirl but shed be best on the grill.</br>  I wonder if Suu went around sucking out nectar and flower petal if she would end up with a upbeat personality too, or at least turn horny.

Then the female centaur gets pregnant on both ends. The front pussy births a human upper torso, and the rear pussy births a horse body without a neck or head. The doctor then surgically attaches the baby human torso to the baby horse body. And there you have it, the totally natural way centaurs are born.</br>  So harem ending or single partner ending? What's your preference? Is one more of a cop out compared to another?  is this anime for people who are still in denial about being a fury?    <br>Remove spider and we are all good.</br>  <br>Well, unlike the other drugs, LSD probably needs some higher brain functions to mess with.

Webms work better when you need sound effects, and/or pausing. Otherwise, Chrome insists on opening it in a new tab every time(for the phone).</br></br>  <br>man, this one wasn't even a contest</br>  <br> Browsing 4chan on the phone <br><br>Why would you even do that to yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Here, gramps. I fixed your picture for you.</br>  you know not that the anime has made the series more popular are we going to get people doing those vday dinners things with the monmusus? I can't recall anyone doing that  <br> Lamia <br>see </br></br>  So how smart is Suu? It seems like she picked up speech skills pretty quickly.  <br>How else are you supposed to browse 4chins when you're away from home? Like in uni or at work? Dem autismbux won't buy too many figs, you know.</br>  <br>Not him, but sometimes I like to browse during work o when I'm in the bed, so my phone comes handy.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't forget she has a cloaca just like the bird. Or she walks around with her anus exposed, dragging it through the streets.</br></br></br>  <br> not browsing 4chan wherever you go all the time <br>And then when someone mentions any kind of new you guys go "What happened, why didn't you guys tell me this was getting a second season? Where's sage? What's options?"</br></br>  <br>Lamia have a human vagina</br>  <br> Only difference is the size. <br>Why even bother.<br><br>I don't make gifs, nor do I intend to learn how to. Same goes for webms. <br>You can't even get preview images for webms, they are fucked on some phones, most boards don't allow sound, etc.<br>Like  said, gifs are in many ways superior.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slimes that have turned black because their homes were polluted <br> Though they often make dark and statirical comments on society <br>10/10 would capture one in a jar</br></br></br>  Nobody here can even afford an appartment big enough to house a horse or 7m snake     horse's smell <br>Disgusting</br>  <br><br>Then how do they shit, stupid?</br></br>  <br>Girls dont poo</br>  <br>onis<br>pretty much just tall women with horns<br>pretty hard to fuck up</br></br></br>  <br><br>I had a snake and I can assure you, they poo mightily. <br><br>Mia's shit logs must be a fucking sight to behold.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd have to pinch it off every foot or so to avoid clogging the shitter.</br>  <br>polt</br>  Is there a turtle Monster Musume?<br>I have turtles and one of them snaps at me heavily whenever I'm in just it's field of vision from the tank.<br><br>I've often wondered what would happen if I dangled my penis in the tank. Maybe while it had a drop of semen hanging from it. Would it eat the semen?<br>This is why I ask if there is a turtle Monster Musume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only because they don't poo very often. My bredl's python once went over a month without defecating but ate like normal the whole time.</br>  <br>Don't do that. But when you do, make sure there's good lighting and a video recording device active. Don't use your phone for the video. You'll need it to call emergency services.</br>  <br>Sure but even only once a month having to deal with a pile of shit the size of a pig can't be all that fun.</br>  <br>Oh my lord. I need to stop rewatching Oreimo and pick this shit up.<br><br>Monster Musume right?</br></br></br>  <br>Her pussy must be super delicate.</br>  <br>are you into zoofilia?<br><br>Horse vaginas are very similar to human.

And probably hit just as hard as Negi did in his thunder form.</br>  <br>They orobably have no idea how strong Negi was or even more, is.<br><br>I'm not wanking or anything but this kind of stuff happens all the time in manga, it's just hyping shit up</br></br></br>  <br>So, is the Negi NTR still going stronk in UQ Holder?<br>I dropped because of it. Had never seen an author NTR his own MC with another manga's MC. It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima.<br><br>Well the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) makes me wonder if he just decided to blow Negima off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirië should win the Touta-Bowl.</br>  <br>At this point Eva can be considered 3 characters, Kitty (between 16 and 60 years old), Eva (600 years old) and Yukihime (700 years old), which makes sense considering how old is she, Akamatsu is following the idea that nobody will remain the same after such a long time. It doesn't help that Yukihime saw most of his friend die of old age, the two guys he liked defeated and controled by the Lifemaker and her first love turned into an amnesic little kid.</br>  <br>Regarding Yukihime: Mother or Wife?</br>  <br>Older sister.</br>  <br>I fucking love his monster designs.</br>  <br>We all do</br>  <br>Of course he is.<br><br>Negi? Who? Man we have a cool clone of negi now that NTRs him. Get on with the times</br></br></br>  <br>well in part you have to recall negi's strongpoint wasn't supposed to be his pure battle strength, he was just pretty strong as well as being really smart. there's probably tons of monsters and shit throughout eternity that are just as strong, if not stronger, than negi was. However negi is a stronger foe because negi is a genius rather than because negi is more pwoerful</br>  <br>Damn, it took 80 chapters but I'm finally starting to enjoy this series as something more than a sad Negima sequel.</br>  <br>Negi was never interested in Eva.</br>  <br>You marry her first so that she becomes your wife then you impregnate her and she becomes a mother.</br>  I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought.  <br>I wonder if Akamatsu makes notes about those little background comments and then develops a storyline about it that can be used somewhere in the future</br>  <br>that's actually an impressive callback.</br>  <br>good idea incompetent</br>  <br>Kirie is best girl, even though she knows that she is helping the competition, she is willing to still help Touta keep the promise. She is really a good girl.</br>  You know, as retarded savescumming is, I'm glad it's here for moments like this one.<br><br>In any other manga they would have just one chance and have to pull one massive asspull.<br><br>At least here even if we know there will be an asspull they will go through a gorillion loops at first to figure out which asspull works and which one does not.<br><br>Although, I wonder how the fuck Kuromaru managed to survive it when Tota and Kirie couldn't even notice it the first time and even when trying to camp him he skill was going to fuck them over sideways to next sunday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyrie's blushing face is love here.</br>  <br>Kuromaru is an exorcist, he has a lot of skills that helps him fight spirits like this guy. Think of how Kurt was able to hit thunder form Negi back in Negima.</br>  <br>Touta is living the life!</br>  <br>perhaps you want to rephrase that</br>  <br>Pretty sure he noticed the spirit and was observing him, he only got in the range because he saw his friends and got insta-killed.</br>  <br> person who never met Negi saying how strong he was <br>So not only did they make Negi sterile, but now they are downpowering him/making fucking MOOKS his level of strength to prop up Touta as not a total shitlord</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say she's the best girl, but she's definitely a good one. She isn't devoted to winning at any cost while trampling all over the feelings of her crush. She knows Touta care a lot about fulfilling his promise, and in fact it's one of the things she likes about him, so she'll help him fulfill it.<br><br>Of course, she's not going to stop trying to twist him arm to find out the full story, because she's not an idiot or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Kuro was more like running away from the spirit and then jumped to help Touta and Kyrie which got him insta-killed with them. <br><br><br>Yeah, I really liked that part, I feel it shows she cares about him and the things important to him. Plus I don't blame her for wanting to know, her chances to win the bowl ride on that info. <br><br>I like how in this arc, Kyrie has finally become one of Totua's true friend. I certainly feel she is closer to him than she was before this whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Running away from something with lightning speed? He still needed to find a way to take the book, it's unlikely that he gave up.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you are right, reading it again, it looks like Kuro jumped out of hiding to save those two.</br></br>  <br>They got there a day earlier, meaning Kuro died/fought already their first run to the ruins.</br>  <br><br>High level spirit as strong as Negi, Rakan, and Fate during Negima (technically Negi &gt; both). Power creep is a bitch, but maybe they won't outright beat it.</br></br>  <br> Negi&gt; Rakan <br>Debatable, it's possible he was not even the strongest, considering his rival Fate lost to Eva.</br></br>  <br><br>That thing one-shotted Kirie, Touta, and Kuro twice, I hardly think that calling it as strong as Negi is downplaying Negi's strength.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not really debatable, Negi even hits as hard as Rakan does physically, has faster speed, and high speed regeneration.<br><br>Eva was the strongest character outside The Mage of the Beginning﻿ and possibly Nagi in Negima, so Fate drawing with a weaker version of her while noticeably being stronger than before doesn't say much.<br><br><br><br>As if they're impressive in the grand scheme of things at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that Kurt Godel managed to land a critical hit on Lightning Negi. Lightning Negi was not that powerful. Rakan only briefly had to get serious with him.<br><br>I'm sure Kuromaru can do the same trick Kurt pulled here.</br></br>  <br> hits as hard as Rakan does physically <br>No, Negi has regen but he is far less durable than Rakan, he managed to last that long against Rakan because he had Asuna's artifact and Rakan was not serious most fo the time.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt, and ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know - did Setsuna know it? It bypasses magic shields, harms elementals, and should be able to directly target the soul. Tsukuyomi was able to cut up Fate.<br><br>Seeing how Kurt was also able to react to hundreds of Negi lightning clones at that point, you're underselling him. Takahata, Kurt's more or less equal, agreed Negi outstrips him by a very large degree at the end, anyway.<br><br><br><br>Nah, Fate says Negi punches just as hard as Rakan does during their last fight. Fate is well antiquated with Rakan's fists, and he was able to destroy the mandala esque barrier with one punch (he punched Negi countless times after the fact). <br><br>Did you actually read Negima after the Rakan fight?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails?</br>  <br>Zanmaken no Tachi is good, but he will have to hit him. That thing is lightning speed and can kill him in one hit.</br>  <br>It was a stylistic figure, referring to the feelings he puts in his punches anon, a shonen thing. Negi is faster and has regen, Rakan has more strength and durability.</br>  <br> ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know <br><br>He uses it in like ch 4 I think.</br></br></br>  <br> Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt <br>Doesn't matter. Lightning is Lightning, and Lightning is vulnerable. Both Rakan and Kurt were able to get hits in. Kuromaru just has to get a hit in.<br><br>That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. We know it can be hurt. Like  says, all that's needed is to actually get the hit in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now he got hardass training by Dana, he's prolly the strongest of the group right now.</br>  <br><br>No, it was a direct comparison in strength. You're reaching tremendously. Negi took dozens of punches from Fate, who could one shot Quintum in one punch, and took on the Tearing Earth/Thousand Thunderbolts collision. Whether or not Rakan has more durability is up for debate. <br><br><br><br> That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. <br> Lightning Negi was not that powerful <br><br>Yeah, okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> punches Fate <br> Fate blocks it easily <br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you retarded and/or can't tell Negi and Fate apart?</br></br>  <br> No, it was a direct comparison in strength. <br>It was not, reread the manga or at least Fate vs Rakan. Tertium was confirmed to be the strongest Fate, and as the Fate of earth, he had more physical strength than the other clones. Rakan's physical strength and durability is one of his greatest strength, Negi is absolutely not as strong as him in that department. I don't know who has more strength between Negi and Fate but Jack is above both.</br></br>  <br> Anything wrong <br>Maybe Homura summoned them.</br></br>  <br><br> Ignores direct evidence and brings up irrelevant shit <br><br>Yeah, get over it. Fate and Negi are pretty much Rakan's equals in physical strength near the end of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because you think it's irrelevant that you don't get this scene. And he says just now, do you believe his physical strength suddenly increased or what? You are just a Negi fanboy.</br>  <br>I thought that was the whole fucking point of a power up after mastering ME? goddamn anon learn to fucking read</br>  <br><br>RT2 Negi just started fighting Fate with his fists just then during the fight, you idiot. Fate makes a comment that Negi's punch is far stronger than Quintum's earlier as well, who he compared unfavorably to Rakan. <br><br>No matter how you cut it, Fate directly compared his strength to Rakan's. Rakan not being the absolute strongest is sad, but facts are facts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And for how long was he fighting Fate in ME?</br>  <br><br> &gt;I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought. <br> that's actually an impressive callback. <br>I wonder if they are a standard protection tool for interesting sites.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kuro with them now? Is that how her power worked? I can't remember.</br>  <br> Kirië's blushing face is love here. <br>Indeed. I didn't notice that.</br></br>  <br>she was touching him, so he appeared at the save point too.<br><br>I think it would be best that maybe only kirie resets and let kuromaru and touta fight, as they die and recover over and over they¡'ll get used to the guy and beat it.</br></br></br>  <br>With how quickly that thing blew them out, I'd get the feeling it'd take both quite a long while to regenerate from that. And following their regeneration, it'd probably insta-gib them again in an endless cycle of death and reincarnation.</br>  <br><br>loved this moment.</br></br>  <br>This. The series was missing something from the beginning. I'm not sure, but whatever it was, it's starting to get it.</br>  <br> Adad in Akkadian and Ishkur in Sumerian and Hadad in Aramaic and &gt;Arabic language, are the names of the storm-god in the Akkadian, &gt;Assyrian and Babylonian </br>  <br> thunder spirt <br>THUNDER IS NOT LIGHTNING<br><br>NOT SO VERY FRIGHTENING</br></br></br></br>  <br>without lightning there is no Thunder.<br>which means he is also a lightning spirit.<br>Thats basic.</br></br></br>  <br>Touta will pull a Rakan.</br>  Touta will go Raiten Taisou by absorbing the next lightning blast with his magia erebea.  <br>Prove it motherfucker. Asuna says that Negi and the person he loves are alike and I can't think of anyone as similar mentally to Negi in Negima than her.</br>  <br>It could be Yue, you know. They're both brainiacs as far as Asuna's concerned.</br>  <br>That's true, but she loved Negi but the Epilogue rejects both her and Nodoka.</br>  <br><br>For all we know he didn't survive it and only saved them the second time because of a timing coincidence. Like the first time he was observing it for a while, maybe got his ass murdered a few times, then buggered off to rethink his strategy.</br></br>  <br>She need to win and i want her to win but she gonna get cucked</br>  <br>He needs to protect this smile</br>  <br>doesn´t matter if she realy dies.<br>Her second ability is reincarnation.</br></br>  <br><br>I am just here for Negi and wanting to kill myself the further on I go with UQ. I don't give a fuck who wins.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't fucking matter.<br><br>Listen: Power levels DO NOT FUCKING MATTER ANYMORE.<br><br>The enemy Touta's group is fighting can kill them in one hit, and Kuro can likely kill it in one hit.<br><br>So it doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a exorcist of course he could kill a Spirit.<br>It´s his fucking job.<br>There is a differents between could kill and can kill.<br>every Shinmei-ryū swordsman could kill Negi with the right technique but almost no one can.So power levels do matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Touta is too weak to do that, he will have to pull something with his friends to trick the spirit so either he or Kuro can do something.</br>  <br>Touta now has a lot of smiles he has to protect... sadly that means that the boy will fail to protect all of them.</br>  <br>Nah, Touta will beat this guy be rebouncing his attack with his new counter move.</br>  <br>Of course.But he could feel it in the air when he got attacked.</br>  <br>I think that was the static elec from the thunder blast coming to them. Or maybe Touta having good senses?</br>  <br>high level but not the highest yet its as strong as negi who was the strongest ...................................<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>  strongest <br>unlikely. And as strong is kinda vague. itý most likely Magia erebia Negi without his speels just good old punching.</br></br>  <br>I don't believe what inexperienced people say anon, it's called being gullible.</br>  <br><br><br> Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails? <br>this was my first thought<br><br>and it seems like the dungeon is the "noctis labyrint dungeon" maybe touta will get another ME upgrade or some kind of artifact, hell maybe the spirit has become one of rakans friends<br><br>got i love these little references</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Negi can't be killed because he's fucking immortal you idiot Against any other entity, something like ZnT would be a kill.<br><br>Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi? As powerful as Negi doesn't mean as unkillable as Negi.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to doubt, or even be upset, at the idea of there being a high level thunder spirit that's as powerful as Negi was. Negi's strength was his intelligence and immortality, not his raw power output.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It´s the ultimate Spirit of Lightning.<br>is now everything fine? The chapter before we got a Rakan reference and know this.coincident? i think not.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they are in the past, back in the day where Nagi and friends where active, so maybe Touta will meet Rakan if he keeps running around the place.</br>  <br> Maybe they are in the past <br><br> touta and friends die a few more times  <br> suddenly a young rakan is there and helps them kill the spirit <br> this is the fight that rakan was referring to during the negi fight </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a monster as powerful as Negi! <br>Would Akamatsu stop shitting on Negima already?<br>First Eva, now Negi, next what he's gonna do, tell us that Keitaro and Naru died?</br></br></br>  <br>But we knew of this guy from Negima, Rakan mentioned him when he fought Negi so it's just a callback. Get over yourself.<br><br><br>Yep, that would be a great twist, and I bet that Rakan and Touta would just get along like best bros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima. <br>Bingo.<br> ell the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) <br>Don't forget the looks, Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi <br>I am not.I don´t care about Power Levels.<br>But Negi is a Demon that's why I thought a Swordsmanship which is specialized at slaying Demons<br>could kill him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self. <br>because eva is immitating her own mother<br>do you even read the manga or are you only here to shitpost?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just ignore him, he is just being annoying.</br></br>  Negi being as strong as the ultimate spirit of lightning is fine. The strongest entities are likely spirits. People find it odd because Negi was the third/fourth strongest character in Negima and they're obviously going to beat it - we already have Dana clearly being stronger than Negi. <br><br>It's unlikely they're in the past and Rakan will show up, though.</br></br>  <br>Negi's not a demon. He's an immortal monster. So resilient, that the Mage of the Beginning desired him as a potential permanent host. If mere demons could attain such immortality, the Mage would've just gone for one of them. Negi is a true monster, on a level that surpasses even demons. At least in terms of immortality. Not power.<br><br><br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same "EVA'S HAIR IS CHANGED FOR NO REASON IT'S RUINED FOREVER" autist who shit up UQ threads for months and months on end when the manga first started.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does this negate what I said?<br>L2r and get the message right before posting.</br></br>  <br>I honestly don't think Touta and Co will directly beat the guy, they probably will find someway to sneak around the guy, or they will plan something to seal the guy up or buy time for Kuro to do an exorcism. They probably could have Touta do his counter thing, which probably could work. <br><br>So basically I expect the guys to get around this on a technicality, or for young Rakan to appear and help them.</br></br></br>  <br> autist who shit up UQ threads for months and months <br>  /a/ in charge of one person <br><br>There's a limit even with delusions, people legitimately complained about eva's shittier looks with good reason. I understand that it makes it easier for you to ignore if you just think it being "one person", but it's really not how it went.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerve struck!<br>I get a thousand points!</br></br>  <br> I win! </br>  <br>You have been at this for more than two years. The rest who have complained moved on. You need to move on too if you don't like it.</br>  <br>Bet you said this to every single one of the many who complained.</br>  <br>Actually I haven't said anything to those who complained until now.<br>I let others complain about you. The only left complaining is you, and you need to go away already.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>I mean, there's a demonstrated and proven reason for Eva's behavior and change of appearance, and yet you're still acting like a little bitch about it on an imageboard.<br>A fictional character has a hairstyle you don't like. The fuck you gonna do about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Actually her face changed too. Why are you going on with this hairstyle thing no one brought up?</br>  <br>Jesus fucking christ dude, it's magic.<br>Jesus christ.<br>She does it to look more like her mother.<br>The fuck is your problem?<br>Holy shit dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's at least two   in this thread so your logic kinda falls apart</br>  <br>I really don't get why you insist explaining obvious things to me.<br> she looks fugly now <br> but that's because this this this this <br> okay but she still looks ba <br> and this and this and this! <br><br>I mean c'mon, it's not that hard to get the point of the critic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And it's not hard to get my point:<br>This fucker has been derailing threads about this since the day the fucking manga started.</br></br>  <br>Your point is unrelated, so who the fuck cares?<br>It's like telling a painter his works suck and he keeps coming on how his brush was old and his house crooky, either he's deflecting or just a pure autist.</br></br>  <br> because this this this this <br> and this and this and this! </br></br>  <br> Your point is unrelated, so who the fuck cares? <br>I care about perfectly good threads getting shit up by a guy who only comes to them so he can bitch about a fictional character not meeting his stringent personal fucking standards, you stupid little cunt.<br><br>Now fuck off, we're trying to discuss power levels.</br></br></br></br>  Like I said, if just ignore the guys, you won't make them change their minds by arguing so why bother.  <br> I'm not really sure how to defend my argument <br> I-I'll just call him bait and hopefully everything will be alright </br></br>  <br>Actually if you'd just accepted  and  opinions nothing would have been shat up.</br>  <br>His opinions are retarded so why he or anyone accept it?</br>  <br>See, now who's shitting up the thread?</br>  <br>freedom of speech!</br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>Thanks for proving my point.</br>  <br><br>stop</br></br>  Negi was never interested in Eva. You Negi self inverters are hilarious.  <br>Negi never saw Eva as a lover but more as a teacher and so did Eva.<br><br>Eva was only toying with him pre Mundus Magicus</br></br></br>  <br> and so did Eva. <br>Uuuhhmm...</br></br>  <br>The problem is that there is suddenly a lot of people that is stronger than Negi that shows up out of fucking nowhere. Two or three? Sure. Make it a whole species. That's where you fucked up.</br>  <br>This. Eva got demoted into Dana's mook underling. Negi is now inferior to some nameless monster. <br>Next turn they're gonna tell us that Rakan is inferior to the Drakan, "that super race of dragon-warriors" whose babies can hit harder than him because fuck negima's characters.</br></br>  <br>Anon, we already knew of these guys from Negima, that's why it's not an asspull and can you honestly expect Kuro and Co to be correct about powerlevels. They have been wrong most of the time so far, so don't take it too seriously.</br>  <br>We knew they existed, not that they nullified the main character's powerlevels. It's a big difference.</br>  <br>How do they nullify the main character's power levels, it's the ultimate spirit of thunder, it honestly doesn't surprise me that it is at a similar level to what Negi could do in his RT form.</br>  <br>Rakan is already equel to the strongest Dragon.<br>They are buddys.</br></br>  <br> Make it a whole species. That's where you fucked up. <br>There is no guarantee that nobles are all as strong as Dana. For all we know she might be among the strongest.</br></br>  <br>When some random monster guarding some shitty ruins in a side-quest is as strong as the Main Character it pretty much nullifies him.</br>  <br>And so what if that happen?</br>  <br>She was mostly teasing you know. Stop self inserting into Negi.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Shitting on the best and most beloved characters of the series isn't exactly a wise move anon.</br>  <br>Must be why Frieza was portrayed as strong as Guldo right? That totally doesn't ruin a character.</br>  <br><br>Dude, look... knowing Dana these ruins are probably some very important place in Mundus Magicus which is why that guy is guarding them, and having spirits as strong as Negi should not be surprising, specially since Rakan already compared the two. <br><br>Sometimes I feel that you guys just overreact to everything, and look for things to complain about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone being stronger than a character mean that said character is being shat on? I really don't understand your logic?</br>  <br>We don't even know if that spirit is on the same level as Negi.<br><br>Touta stated that Karen Da was as strong as fate, it only shows how much of a powergap there is that they can't assume the actual power of the stronger characters.<br><br>All we know is that the spirit is a very strong magic user, I wouldn't say it is stronger than Quintum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It actually makes sense for the literal spirit-incarnation of lightning to be at least equal to a guy who gets a lightning form from just absorbing a few spells.<br><br>Not to mention that Negi's strength lies not in his raw stats, but his tactical and analytical genius that lets him use magic in unique ways. Negi would defeat the spirit, even if their raw stats are the same.</br></br></br>  <br>yes that totally doesn't ruin a character.</br>  <br>Try reading my posts and you'll get it. I didn't say "someone", I said "some random monster" which is different.</br>  <br> Make it a whole species. <br>well basically we got the averuncus series wich are all extremely powerfull and created by one guy</br></br>  <br>Of course they are looking for stuff to shitpost about. They have been at it for two fucking years. It's not like these threads are active enough either.</br>  <br>That random monster was mentioned in Negima by Rakan.</br>  <br>Said "random monster" is a literal incarnation of lighting, a very strong one at that and Rakan already said that he fought someone like that before, and even if he is only a random monster, again, so what? Powerlevel is really the defining trait of a character for you?</br>  <br/>  <br>You are making it look like you self inserted into Negi hard. Also It was hinted there were a bunch of strong stuff out there in the magicus mundus arc.</br>  <br/>  <br> knowing Dana <br>That's the problem here. She thinks that Touta can and his team can take on a creature that is said to be stronger than Negi. Why does Akamatsu keep shitting on Negima and jack off Touta and his dream team?</br></br>  <br>In a shounen fighting series nullifying the hero's status from "strongest" to "strong as some random monster" is a pretty big shit down.</br>  <br> stronger than Negi <br>was never said.</br></br>  <br> hat is said to be stronger than Negi. <br>Why do you keep acting like a idiot just to jack off Negi?</br></br>  <br>But there is no guarantee that it nullifies the powerlevels. The powergap between Touta/Co and even anyone on the Negima top tiers is so vast that to them everyone seems equally broken after a certain level.<br><br><br> She thinks that Touta can and his team can take on a creature <br>No she doesn't. We don't know what Dana thinks and even if we theorize, it's more likely that she sent them there so that they could reach a new level of mastery of their abilities and complete their goal without needing to defeat the lightning spirit in the first place..<br><br><br>He was never stated to be the strongest, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As powerful now means stronger than according to anon. <br>Plus Negi has something called smarts.</br></br>  <br><br> grammar nazis ignoring the point <br><br>Not even that dude, but please stop. It's obvious what kind of point he was trying to bring across.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she expects them to rough it out as inmortals and find some way to outsmart the thing. They don't have to kill the thing, they just have to get inside the ruins and get the books, and that's probably what Dana wants them to do. <br><br>Basically there is probably some trick to deal with this, and the guys need to find it.</br></br></br>  <br> random monster <br>It was said he was the strongest magician and for now that´s true.</br></br>  <br>The point is that you and the other guy are homosexuals for Negi.</br>  inb4 Touta is Jack Rakan.  <br>"strongest magician" what, that lighting spirit?<br>Source?</br></br>  <br>I think he was talking about Negi or nagi being the strongest magician. Well other than the life maker.<br>The lightning spirit is a monster not a magician.</br></br>  <br>I am talking about Negi.</br>  <br><br>Mage of the Beginning &gt; Dana &lt;=&gt; Other Noble Vampires &gt;&gt; Evangeline =&gt; Nagi (who knows?) =&gt; Negi = Lightning Spirit &gt; Fate &gt; Rakan &gt; Everyone else<br><br>You're exaggerating.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay, as strong as Negi. But my points still stand. Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster, I congratulate Akamatsu for not being a total hack.</br></br></br>  <br>Trips don't lie. People who complain about every little thing that pertains to Negi in Uq holder! confirmed for homosexual.</br>  <br>Which we thought to be super amazing and instead is just on the same level as some spirit, no matter how high in rank.<br>It's kinda the same fate that happened to Eva, being declassed from the stupidly-strong-Shinso-Vampire she was in Negima into a plaything of the "upper race" here.<br><br>Sucks man.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Because they literally have one guy that fighting style is made to deal with guys like that, they are all immortals and have infinite tries thanks to the save point? It's not exactly hard science.</br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Because she probably doesn't.<br> If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster <br>You have to be brainless if you think it's not going in that direction.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dana &lt;=&gt; Other Noble Vampires &gt;&gt; Evangeline <br>I am not so sure about this.<br>Fate said he could beat her maybe the way she is know.<br>which means she is weaker than her sealed self.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've said several times that something happened to Eva to weaken her after the event in Negima.</br>  <br> You have to be brainless if you think it's not going in that direction. <br>I'm gonna save this for future use.</br></br>  <br>Eva isn't at her best though either. She has weakened for whatever reason.</br>  <br>With the direction the series is going, Touta is going to use his finishing move and erase the spirit because IT'S MOTHERFUCKING TOUTA.</br>  <br> some spirit <br>Do you know what Ultimate Spirite of Lightning means?<br>and he has a Name Ishkur.</br></br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Well that can try to kill it infinite times.<br>Touta has ME wich activates in critical situations.<br><br> If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster, I congratulate Akamatsu for not being a total hack. <br>This is just like the dragon under the Library Iland, Negi never had to fight against it even tho he trained to fight it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eva's weaker in UQ Holder, but I had her stronger state in mind. Dana can still clearly toy around with her regardless.</br></br>  <br>Such better times, such more lovable characters.<br>Sigh.</br></br>  <br> akamatsu actually thought making her an adult would be an improvement <br>at least he's trying to fix it by involving kitty<br>you simply can't beat this, ah, character design</br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Negi be equal to Fate, considering they fought to a standstill and Fate simply gave up because Negi convinced him that there is a better way?<br>It's also not knowing whether Rakan is weaker than Fate, since the only fight they had was basically negated because of Fate's Code of the Lifemaker.</br></br>  <br>Because that's when Akamatsu actually think before writing something. I remembered that people say that he was only really trying to make a shonen fighting manga. Now he gets his dream. Should have just made it a different series to be honest.</br>  <br>But even her stronger state is weaker than her real state.</br>  <br>Her design got shittier too, like, her body and face.</br>  <br><br>No, Fate outright states Negi is his superior in their fight. <br><br>Fate could keep up with RT2 Negi in speed, got stronger, and can now stalemate Eva (albeit weakened). Rakan doesn't have the feats to match.<br><br><br><br>The fight was cut short before it got fully serious, but wasn't Eva capable of going all out during her fight against Negi at the end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some sucky resolution buddy.<br>Here, allow me to fix it.</br></br>  The self insertion is strong in this thread.  <br>People can care about a manga's characters and consistency without self inserting anon.</br>  <br>Nobody said otherwise, this thread, however, is full of Negi self insert.</br>  <br>But there are no problems with consistency so far. People are just butthurt that the setting isn't sucking the dicks of their favorite characters.</br>  <br>How come? Didn't see anything like that so far.</br>  <br>Sounds like an excuse to justify some of the shitty turns this sequel took.</br>  <br>The Mage of the Beginning can't be too strong since he lost once against Nagi + Zect and later in Zects body against Nagi. He also lost against Negi and Asuna but that's probably because Magic Cancell being a god tier ability. Eva also said she killed him on her path of revenge.<br><br>Nagi = Eva(negima) = LifeMaker &gt; Dana =&gt; Eva(UQ with ME) &gt; Fate(UQ) &gt;= Zect(?) = Negi(ME) = Fate(negima) = Rakan = Eva(UQ) &gt; OtherAverruncus &gt; UltimateLightningSpirit &gt;&gt;&gt; Demon God (KyotoArc)<br><br>We don't know if Eva surpassed Dana and is now weaker than her because sealings and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuna and the Master of the Gravekeeper's Palace are not on the list but notable strong characters</br>  <br><br>Are you forgetting Lifemaker easily paralyzing Eva and her shitting her pants in his presence? <br><br>Eva isn't stronger than Dana no matter what, this is clearly established by her reverence.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Mage of the Beginning can't be too strong <br>Anon, you're ignoring a simple fact: The MoB's power is dependent on his host body. None of the bodies he had so far came close to his original one, which was so powerful he could overlay Mars with his magic to create an entire living world.<br><br>This is obvious when you consider that Eva killed him the right after becoming a vampire, despite not having any magic or familiarity with her new body yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Eva isn't stronger than Dana no matter what, this is clearly established by her reverence. <br>Not really. They haven't met in over two centuries, which is the time period in which Eva reached the peak of her power, so it's unknown whether Dana is stronger than her.</br></br>  Well, for all I see you guys discussing power level's and all that are quite stupid, also the ones that can't take that their character might be compared to something should try to focus on other stuff<br>I like power level's but it's best to think of them like variations, like Negi's power in said moment is a variation from 500 to 1000, been 500 his worst condition and 1000 his best. Also, there is something like advantage and all that, like Asuna, who could easily "defeat" Eva because her ability is REALY strong against images, but if she fought a knight, she would probably lose.<br>In Dana and Eva's case, since Eva learned everything from her it might be that Dana has an advantage because she knows what Eva is using and her quirks.</br></br>  <br><br>It's been established the extent of Eva's decline in UQ isn't completely drastic, yet Dana is easily going through her shields and fucking with her illusion spell without even trying. <br><br>Until further notice, and with all the info we currently have to go on, Eva is clearly inferior via general statements, character portrayal, and demonstrations of power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't go by that. Nagi beat her at the height of her power with fucking garlic soup even though she's immune to general vampire weaknesses.<br><br>She just can't fight seriously unless she's going for the kill.</br></br></br>  <br>That was a joke fight anon.</br>  <br> Eva got demoted into Dana's mook underling <br>We should note that Eva is said to be weaker than she used to be. She used Magia Erebea on Fate when she was easily handling the other Averuncus. Dana also has the advantage of having plenty of knowledge on Eva.</br></br>  <br> Rakan that low </br>  <br> She used Magia Erebea on Fate when she was easily handling the other Averuncus <br><br>Fate was much stronger than the others even during Negima, both him and Negima one shotted or simply raped the ones they encountered.<br><br><br><br>Rakan dick rider, please go. Everyone loves him, but it's excessive at times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> extent of Eva's decline in UQ isn't completely drastic <br>Looking at her fight with the other Averuncus clones &amp; then her UQ Holder fight with Fate, she's easily weaker.<br><br> Dana is easily going through her shields and fucking with her illusion spell without even trying <br>This is Dana, the one who trained her &amp; thus should know plenty about her. Dana easily has the information advantage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fate was much stronger than the others even during Negima <br>At minimum, Fate struggled against a fellow Averuncus. Fate won because of his superior physical stats. Eva played multiple ones like a flute.</br></br>  <br> she's easily weaker. <br><br>Obviously, but she's still capable of fighting on par with people like Fate, Negi, and Rakan. All three can beat the Averuncus series with one punch. <br><br>Dana styling on Eva was clearly meant to be a demonstration of superiority after Eva's declaration of the nobility's power, and is followed by Fate being awed. <br><br><br><br>One punch would end all of them. Imagine an actual spell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man how much I dislike this bitch.</br>  <br><br>The Dana scene was more of a joke too.</br></br>  <br>Not really, it served to establish Dana's superiority over Eva in terms of powerlevel, not to establish Nagi's careless and aloof attitute towards Eva's "love".</br>  <br>She simply bypassed Evas barriers but so did Evas endless white nine heaves.<br><br>Even Negi had a spell to break barriers.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh god do I miss old Eva</br>  <br><br>She didn't bypass them, she brute force broke through them. <br><br>Negi's Barrier-Crushing Palm broke through Dynamis' barrier (Fate and Negi could do that with a punch at the end of the manga), but it isn't the same as being able to break a weakened Eva's like paper tissue when a stronger Fate still had to struggle with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate is the Averuncus of Earth &amp; thus has better physical stats than the rest. The Averuncus models are known to have around the same power, it's just not in identical areas. Fate's punches are better than the rest.</br>  <br><br>Are you kidding? Fate being to one shot any of them, and Negi demolishing two of them proves there's a big disparity in strength between them and Fate. Quintum himself even says so as he's getting BTFO.</br></br>  <br><br>You must lack critical thinking skills if you think Fate just happens to punch harder. It's power levels, not complicated stuff.</br></br>  <br>Fate was more human than the rest of the constructs and actually got stronger over time. Thus he's able to stomp all over the other puppets who stagnate.</br>   mfw no sad panda thread <br><br>Let's make a wincest edition<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/27681/8cc2aec<wbr>3a1/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/4902/a470aef2<wbr>30/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/6126/446cc6e1<wbr>02/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/4492/d8303bb2<wbr>5d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/4894/6f6811b9<wbr>50/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/5813/ef710f01<wbr>62/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/6534/9fffafb4<wbr>92/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rewrite <br> Rewrite <br>Fuck off back to fakku</br></br></br>   olddog <br><br>What happened to him anyway?</br></br>  <br> wincest edition <br><br>Oh wow anon, nice timing.

He hates them, but he needs friends. He also doesn't like his sister/cousin that much <br> Then with his "friends" they go around raping girls near school.

Recently I started getting into futa / trap hentai, but i really don't think i'm gay. i have absolutely 0 attraction to males/male genitalia in real life. Only in 2D, and only when the character has a very feminine appearance, either as a futa or as a trap(usually shota) I do find the penises on these characters attractive, but more in a cute kind of way.<br><br>These are some of my favorite hentai:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/766328/6bfdbb<wbr>8834/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821274/fc4138<wbr>9fe7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/405171/39c957<wbr>cdf5/<br><br>I don't think that liking 2D males counts as being gay?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Traps (except Bridget) are gay. FutaxFemale isn't though, FutaxMale is</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Soon you wont even care</br>  <br><br><br>Futa is fine for me but for some reason I can't get into shemales.</br></br></br>    <br> bridget isn't gay <br>That's like saying Poison isn't a tranny.<br><br>Soon enough you'll be upset there isn't enough gay porn. If you are upset by this, leave now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shemales <br>What even is the difference? If you mean in like 3D porn, that shit is disgusting and you should be burned at the stake for watching it.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is gay for Bridget, ergo it's not gay, you fucking faggot.</br>  <br> That's like saying Poison isn't a tranny. <br><br>That's 100% confirmed since the recent character bikini contest though. There was no dick in sight.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Futas still have the vagina, and more than likely the ability to get pregnant.</br></br>  <br>Looks like he's streaming now.</br>  A most interesting research reports guys. <br>I was checking sadpanda and tried to find the oldest doujin ever uploaded there. <br>It's a C28 (1985) doujin, pic related, featuring Urusei Yatsura and Creamy Mami.<br>So I kept seaching and a found a few interesting things. Most of the uploaded doujin from 85 to 90 featured... Dirty Pair. Apparently at some time japs HAD good taste.<br>Then Ranma happened and dominated the scene until C43, when there's the first major boom due to Sailor Moon. Notable mentions to Ah megami sama, Tenchi Muyo and Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (proving Gainax was meant for this for a long time) <br>The big surpirse is that it was expected to see a lot of Evangelion stuff from C47 onwards, but Sailor Moon kept the lead for almost two editions. Only after C50 Evangelion really bloomed and we got all teh Rei.<br><br>So yeah. Of course it doesn't show all the stuff that was made back then, but it's rather interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, all of the art from back then was terrible.</br>  http://live.fc2.com/62975839<br>dat manly voice.</br>  <br><br>There's a few that are good, but the issue isn't the art being terrible, it's it being completely underwhelming and unarousing. Pretty much everything had to be done by hand in those days, so the works lack any kind of complexity, right down to typesetting.</br></br>  <br> that chat <br>Yeah, linking this here is a great idea. Leave the poor guy alone.</br></br>  <br>You're entitled to your opinion, but I must disagree. <br>Especially considering we had people like Satoshi Urushihara there around that time</br></br>  <br>He needs to know his followers.</br>  <br>Bikini contest? No dick? <br>Never before have two sentences so quickly raised my hopes and dreams then shattered them completely and utterly.</br></br>    <br> "do you like kangoku gakuen?" <br> haven't seen it <br> "it has big tits and big asses" <br> yeah </br></br></br></br>  <br>aunt</br>  <br>Older Sister or Aunt and young boy. <br><br>And sister and brother when they are both kids is good too.</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Minazuki getting assaulted by english.  Now I wish I knew Japanese so I could ask him which Squid Sister from Splatoon is better. <br><br>Although that sort of question would probably get a better answer from Ryou. I think that guy was literally streaming splatoon on the same site the other day.</br></br></br>  <br>souce? the artist looks like bubuzuke but i couldn't find any with the incest tag</br>  Maybe one of you guys can help me. A year or two ago I found this fetish manga that I really liked, akin to My Balls!, but at the time it was incomplete or I simply couldn't find a translation group that had finished it. I remember very few things about it but want to stick my nose in it again. Let's see what I can remember and see if any of you can recognize it.<br><br> rather standard appearances, not cartoony like My Balls! and the MC wasn't grungy like that BDSM manga who's name also escapes me <br> rather frequent sex but there was actual plot moving between the smut. Though I think it may have been classified as actual porn <br> not a single fucking scanlation group did the whole thing. It kept getting picked up where someone else left off, carried for like five chapters, and then bounced to the next group. I think Batoto had like the first few chapters, aggregator sites had the next few, then I had to start bouncing around different scanlator sites to try and get more <br><br>All I remember about it was enjoying both the characters and the porn. Nothing else because it as a pain to check up on since nothing else updated there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  does anyone split comics into each chapter?  <br>My fucking dick</br>  <br>Out of pity for your incompetence at searching, here you go:<br>http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=793014<br><br>or http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=search<wbr>&amp;cats=7_28&amp;sort=5</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> open link <br> suddenly DRAGONFORCE <br>well, if that's what he wants to play.</br></br></br>  <br>Father and son<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/756147/ca602b<wbr>9123/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/471709/5bd91b<wbr>4828/<br>http://exhentai.org/s/058b870782/41<wbr>6215-14</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Other active:<br>http://live.fc2.com/44894410/<br>http://live.fc2.com/39763436/</br></br>  <br>I honestly felt like asking if he might like dragonforce at some point then the guy just starts playing their stuff. Makes me wonder if he'd like two steps from hell.</br>  This may or may not show up on the panda. You've learned to follow translation blogs by now haven't you?  <br>You mean it will because someone will always upload it regardless.</br>  <br>In case, you haven't, look here.<br>docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJz<wbr>gJBGuY5Jv0xcaPwGD8lAlYueu0Z6Q4HWdy1<wbr>BDDDg<br><br/></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> implying stuff isn't constantly removed <br> implying stuff that can't be uploaded stays uploaded  <br>Good luck not having a back-up.</br></br></br>  <br>I browse panda every few hours and download everything I want like anyone should. None of this is a problem.</br>  <br> reading translations <br>Absolutely disgusting</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/837233/b9554e<wbr>acf6/</wbr></br>  <br> every few hours every day <br>You may have a problem.</br></br>  <br>It takes like 20 seconds to check for new uploads dude.</br>  <br>I meant more that you have the ability to check so often every day and that you think everyone does.</br>  The stories where they actually act like real brothers and sisters are really something.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/812908/0b6012<wbr>e630/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/218313/cedd7c<wbr>9fbc/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/444287/5dc328<wbr>c695/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/745407/c8b6cb<wbr>e701/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/745934/bc5f95<wbr>65fd/<br><br>Does anyone remember the one where a guy goes to school with someone that becomes a magical girl that fights monsters and it turns out his sister has become evil so he mindbreaks her with sex?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  This might sound weird but... are there any with an ugly and/or ugly&amp;fat girl<br><br><br>I dunno why but I have developed this fetish of ugly girls</br></br></br>  <br>Just check at work/school. Shouldn't be an issue.</br>  <br>everyone's got problems. better he obsess over hentai then shoot up a school or something.</br>  <br>I agree.<br>Your problem is making terrible false dichotomies.</br></br>  <br> Just the person I was wondering to question about. Seeing that Lilith had never had any concerns with you sharing a patch for one of their titles. Seems they might truly have no legal bone to pick with anyone as long as people don't share files containing their original work. Which your patch is stated clearly does not. With regards to not only what you're sharing but also to that one guy making translations for Murasaki and the IZms. So it might possibly confirm that Lilith won't get pissy at people translating their games as long as you don't go around sharing cracked versions of their stuff.   Though I wonder if ShindoL himself knows of such a translation existing, and if he minds. Would be nice if Monster Survive was translated someday. </br>  <br> brown <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask ShindoL on his patreon or twitter. <br>He's American so he knows English perfectly well.</br></br>  <br>Like this?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/826907/3426b5<wbr>b133/</wbr></br></br>  Is there a way to find the metadata for an expugned gallery ? Sometime google pop an adress with the good GID and token but that's not very often.  <br>Eh... she was below average but not what I'd call ugly. Hell she was kind of cute in her own way</br>  <br>Do you mean purged?<br>Try the gallery back-up or nhentai I guess.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/723205/9a1765<wbr>91cf/<br><br>Will this ever get translated?

What the fuck?  I remember seeing one a while ago where Asuka is helping shinji  take a shit  post 3.33.

I only remember parts of the story. It's about a couple 16-18 years old that's into anal. The guy used to play that japanese anus poking prank on girls in his elementary school years and that's how he met his gf and they developed their anal fetish. iirc it was part of a anal doujin collection, not sure if all stories were by the same artist.<br>Been searching for almost 2 hours now I'm afraid it might have been purged from the surface of sadpanda.</br>   finished fapping <br> saw this http://exhentai.org/g/837233/b9554e<wbr>acf6/</wbr> <br> had to fap again <br>Fuck my dick hurts now, but it was worth it.</br></br></br>  <br>Share it anon, if you found it.</br>  <br><br>I think its in analism</br></br>  How do you guys finish?  any one remembers that one h-manga with an exhibitionist trap doing cam shows online, all is going well, until his classmate came to his dorm and recognized the room.  <br> makes it convenient to get all the chapters in one place till someone does a re-edit. <br> makes it convenient to get all the chapters in one place <br> all the chapters in one place <br>that kills my drive to reedit shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In you're mom.</br>  Oh boy<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/837180/d2fe97<wbr>6d48/</wbr></br></br>  <br>It keeps saying login failed<br><br>Oh well this could cure my shitty porn addiction</br></br></br>  <br>Stop using plugins.</br>  I just recently got into panda.

People often dislike paying with credit cards for porn, bank statements you know...</br>  <br>I mean using people's opinion of loli porn=child porn as a way to fuck with people is short sighted if you want to continue having that porn in the future.</br>  <br>yeah but imagine sadpanda loli getting caught in the crossfire. I personally dont care about loli but I wouldnt like to make my lolibros suffer like that.</br>  <br> sadpanda loli getting caught in the crossfire <br><br>they aren't selling anything I don't see how they could get caught in any crossfire</br></br></br>  <br>it's an exemption for condoms/birth control/etc, they don't like porn of any sort</br>  I'm trying to find something and I'm worried it was on a hard drive that crashed.<br><br>The cover had a short-haired, brunette, cute trap with chocolate syrup covering some of his body on a red background.

Tons of onaholes on amazon for cheap.</br>  <br>Why would amazon give paypal a cut of the profits? They have their own payment service already.</br>  <br>Only reason paypal and amazon didn't work together was because of ebay saying no. Otherwise paypal is just essentially a credit card company/bank by itself. No reason it shouldn't work with amazon.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it would be amazon saying no to paypal considering how much product they move. Paypal takes a cut from every purchase they process. Why would amazon ever give that cut to paypal when they already process payments themselves?</br>  <br>Because paypal could attract people who would have otherwise chosen not to purchase anything I guess.</br>  <br>Doubtful. Amazon has a better public image than Paypal. There are so few people that would only use Amazon if it had a paypal option that it's not worth it for Amazon to implement.</br>  <br>Amazon is way bigger than paypal</br>  <br>I very highly doubt they clear more money then patreon.</br>  Anyone have that one where its about that girl who has a massive crush on her homeroom teacher but she's forced to service the gorilla dick gym teacher?<br><br>I think she was in the service club or something.</br></br>  <br>Probably more than the adult part of patreon. and remember fakku has been a company for 9 years</br>  <br>Hustler uses Vend-O, not PayPal.</br>  mother son<br>aunt nephew<br>brother sister<br>in that order anything else is shit</br></br></br>  I can't log into e-hentai.

"The gender of the one being unfaithful" has literally nothing to do with whether something is netorare or netori.<br>And even if, for some reason, they decided that male:netorare would be the de facto netori tag, completely ignoring the actual tag definition, God knows it doesn't work in practice: http://exhentai.org/g/828637/ff6cc3<wbr>a536/<br> male:cheating <br>And on further research, apparently cheating = netori according to the wiki: http://ehwiki.org/wiki/cheating<br>But yet netori is listed as a synonym of netorare on the netorare page: http://ehwiki.org/wiki/netorare<br>Both of those pages, by the way, say in bold to not confuse them with each other, while both actually having the same fucking word as a synonym.<br>The more I look, the worse this gets.

They seem to think you're in a coma.</br>  <br>is this a new meme<br>post the UK one</br></br>  can someone explain how does the hath/GP exchange works?<br>the recent transactions page is so confusing.<br>there are people buying 3kgp for 180 credits <br>and then there are people buying 20000kgp for 180 credits<br>how the fuck does this work<br>what is the god damn exchange rate?</br></br></br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/836805/5883e6<wbr>6ddb/<br><br>She never asked for this.</br></br></wbr>  <br><br>Left side are offers to buy, right side are offers to sell. When someone makes a high enough buy or low enough selling offer a transaction is made. So currently you can sell up to 7k gp for 178 credits each since that's the highest buying offer. Or alternatively you can buy up to 925k gp for 179 credits each</br></br>  <br> and then there are people buying 20000kgp for 180 credits <br><br><br>Also you generally don't see individual buy/sell offers, the reason the amounts are so high is because you're watching buy/sell pools. Every person who's buying gp at say 175 credits each is totalled up in the screen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 925k for 179 credits <br>isn't that a bit too much?</br></br>  <br>Ah I see, that makes more sense then.</br>  <br>Wait, what the fuck is this?</br>  <br><br>It seemed to be a single guy buying a bunch at well above the going rate. Though even outside that GP/hath prices are way higher thanks to the recent patch. The weapon/armor lottery has guaranteed peerless items now so a lot of people are using gp to gamble on those. And there was a bunch of hath perks added.</br></br>  <br>a   fake  </br>  <br>Its not fake</br>  <br>Just seems like that's a huge amount for GP exchange for something like 200~ credits which you can get in about a minute in hentaiverse.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a fake.</br>  <br>Nothing in that list past rape is banned in the US.</br>  <br>The only one that comes to mind is<br>http://exhentai.org/g/97457/138af7d<wbr>dc4/</wbr></br></br>  <br> Facesitting and female ejaculation <br>You sick fuck, you deserve jail.</br></br>  <br> Getting warned for a felony through email. <br>Paranoid people would believe anything won't they? it's like those give money to drop the charges online frauds.</br></br>  <br>Thank you!We really aprecciate it.</br>  <br> We caught you breaking this law but if you stop doing it we'll leave you alone <br>How can anyone believe this shit</br></br>  <br> oyster <br><br>yeah nah</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminds me of the days when newfags were lured into searching for lolita on imagefap.</br></br>  <br>What else is there to do between vidya and work?</br>  <br> vidya <br> work <br>I don't even do either now<br>it's just fap food fap shower fap sleep repeat<br>all I see from waking up to going to sleep is hentai</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finding good hentai is one.

Does anyone else get a feeling of emptiness or sadness after finishing an anime? I know it sounds silly but, the concept of things ending just always gets to me  Depends on the anime to be honest<br><br>I got hit REALLY hard when I finished Welcome to the NHK. I moped around for almost a week afterwards. I don't know why it hurt so bad because it's not even my favourite series.</br></br>  It happens to me sometimes, I just force myself to sleep because I can't do anything else.  Only if it was really good. The depression is not necessarily proportional to how good it is though.  No. Because i just start something else.  It's quite simple, really. You need to immediately find a new one that's just as awesome. If you can't, that means you're not trying hard enough.<br><br>On a side note: it might be best to avoid marathoning anime you're deeply enjoying, despite the natural urge to do so.</br></br>  it happened to me after watching perfect blue  I know everyone thinks it's shit, but when Mayo Chiki ended I was sad because I'll never get to see mai waifu Konoe again.  The worst I had it was after tora dora  <br>so what should i watch next<br>i'm  btw</br></br>  <br> so what should i watch next <br>I think  you should fuck off to /r/, or use Google, or both. </br></br>  <br/>  just keep moving on. constantly keep moving to a different anime right after the next. failure to do so results in me overthinking the end of an anime and becoming sad. <br><br>If it was a hard hitting anime or one I for some reason became really attached to, it usually takes me a week to get over it.</br></br>  <br>I get really depressed after I finish anything, but especially stuff I really enjoyed.<br><br>After I completely finished Haruhi, I didn't even feel like watching anime for a few weeks.</br></br></br>  <br><br>When I finished Haruhi I immediately ordered all of the LN's as a coping mechanism</br></br>  <br/>  I present to you, Shrimp-chan.

It's about a 6.5/10 overall, with the final episode being an 8.5/10 because its the episode where they compete in a band competition.</br>  <br>Yes. It's a 10/10, easy AOTY and one of the best anime ever made.</br>  <br>I'd raise the overall rating by at least 0.5, but other than that I agree with this guy.<br>It was easily one of the top 5 shows of last season.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty good. Slow paced, but in your case with all the episodes available you won't notice. Relationships are one of the strengths in this series.<br><br>Personally I think this is the better job Kyoani has been done in a while, probably since Hyouka.<br><br>Animation/art wise, is top notch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. Most of the characters are boring, the story is nothing special.<br><br>It has good animation and music and it's not terrible though, you could do worse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and to catch Kumiko is her real test.</br>  Season 2 please kyoanus.  <br>to become special is her cause.</br>  All for Taki-sensei.  <br> wants to fuck multiple different people <br>Slut.</br></br>  <br>she's only after Taki</br>  <br>Those are her words.

But anyways, it doesn't justify her.</br>  <br><br>Please tell me someone has made cards for the entire cast</br></br>  <br> Her actions says otherwise <br><br>You're right her actions are twisted by Kyoani for baiting purposes.</br></br></br>  <br>Just don't expect them to go full lesbian</br>    <br>She only wants to be with two people. (Preferably at the same time.)</br>  <br>Some aspects of her character are ambiguous and debatable. Whether she's a chuuni isn't one of them.</br>  <br><br> Reina wanting to share Taki-sensei <br><br>Please she almost murdered Kumiko at episode 12.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>She's likes to pretend she's mature is what she is.</br></br>  <br>Anything more than one makes her a degenerate slut.</br>  I need to show you this  When, suddenly--  <br>You really don't.</br>  <br> No trumpet solo <br>Whatever</br></br>  <br>I MUST</br>  <br>You really didn't.</br>    <br/>    <br><br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br><br>Would you blow her Euphonium, /a/?</br></br>  <br>She is just a little bit weird and anti-social, but call her a chunni is just overstate.</br>  <br>when will my waifu sing too?!</br>  You brought this upon yourself  <br>aoty + solid 10/10 for the times we live in</br>  <br>Would fug.</br>  <br>She is a sixteen year old girl and Kumiko is the very first friend she has ever made.<br>Saying she's just a little bit weird is an understatement.<br><br>And not to be a nitpicky fag, but I assume you meant asocial, not antisocial. She's a turbonerd, not a delinquent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>post lewds <br><br><br>excuse me anon but there's something wrong with her nose</br></br></br></br>  <br> ---HA! Get ready, fagott! </br>  <br>Reina truly doesn't care though. She's not your typical girl who needs to come out of her shell and have friends.<br>Reina wants to be around people she likes, and everyone else is too common for her.<br>Whether she makes friends or not couldn't be less important for her.</br></br></br>  HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ</br></br></br>  <br>Is this like the 6th thread tonight already?</br>  Needs more LN translations  <br> AINZ <br> NAZI <br>Fuck off, i bet that bony guy has a nazi minions.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish /a/ was back to 15 threads a minute speed.</br>    I finally figured out what I don't like about Albedos armor. It makes her look like a heartless.  Someone post the gif in which he is laughing.  <br>That looks like a space marine for some reason to me. Must be the beer.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  tfw you will never pledge your loyalty to papa bones  I originally hated that the first 2 episodes were just explanations of everything, but now that we're 2 more in I'm actually glad I got a lot of the background info out of the way. Now I can just enjoy the show as they continue with a little new info each episode.<br><br>Also<br> Heil Ainz </br></br></br>  <br>But that's just a chair. Real best girl here.</br>  <br> Retards <br> Best anything </br></br>  <br>The literallywhofags have arrived</br>  <br>Even though I read the LN I only just realized why people keep calling her Chair.</br>  Originally wasn't even going to give this show a try due to the CGI in the trailer. Glad I did though because I am loving this fucking show.  Looking forward to Albedo getting Boned in doujins   <br> that <br> best </br></br>  <br>Not sure if this had already been made but I had a mighty need to make a stitch from the ending for a possible vertical dual monitor setup</br>  It's pretty ironic how most of the complaints about this episode is how Ainz being so OP means there's no tension in the series but I've yet to come across anyone calling him a Gary Stu. Apparently people DO know the difference between being OP and being a Gary Stu. Who knew?  If you think the best character is anyone other than PA or Albedo, you're solely mistaken. All others would probably turn on Ainz the minute their creators show up.<br>Automatic disqualification from the Best Character contest.</br>  <br>like 90% of the complaints about this series are people throwing cheap bait against the wall to see what sticks. the other 10% generally being op haters or lnfags (myself included) that feel a lot of the skipped dialogue is losing out on world and character building.</br>  <br>What if my favourite character is   Brain  </br>  <br>Good choice. He's going to outGazef Gazef himself pretty soon.</br>  <br>Only thing I dislike is the CGI angles looking like robots and the lack of intense sound. I expected the black hole to make noise, though I can accept that.<br>The manga reaction faces got my hopes up in certain regards</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The series is surprisingly easy to depend, especially considering the OPness of Ainz. I guess making the title OVERLORD guaranteed you'd know what the hell you were getting yourself into.</br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>The intimidation of the quiet black hole was pretty great though.</br></br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>clearly you don't understand how black holes work.</br></br>  I'm glad the next two episodes will give us a break from action on the scale of this and episode 3. The next time something on that scale happens will be the end of volume 2 and 3 right? So, say, episodes 7 and 13?  <br>I think things like this are so rare that I'm just savoring getting to see an intelligent evil lich in action. If the whole show was about him just floating around murdering weak assholes it would be a problem but they're obviously not going for that.</br>    <br>Looks nice, especially with him sitting in the abyss just waiting like he's the last boss of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The way I see it is 5 is adventurer meet up, 6 Battle with the forest king, 7 set up for zombie apocalypse, and 8 Devil May Cry: skeleton edition.</br>  <br>HEIL AINZ<br><br> I expected the black hole to make noise </br></br></br>  <br>Be happy that we are getting full chapters instead of individual parts like usal</br>  <br>I lost my shit</br>  <br>That was quick.</br>  <br>Shut it chair</br>  <br>She's gonna be a main character in the next few episode anon</br>  <br>Need a complete webm of him summoning the angel of bait holding a fish hook scepter. Then Ainz deleting it with a sage.</br>  <br> Talkin shit about Ainz's chair. <br>You'd best take that back about Nazarick's top Overlord approved seat.</br></br>  <br>but the best way to defeat bait is by ignoring it, not saging.</br>  <br> tfw my webm is getting popular in this thread <br><br>I wish Papa Bone would be proud of me</br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon. Just wanted to spread your ingenuity.</br>  <br>Main character who fucks shit up because she can't follow simple instructions <br><br> implying saying Shalltear is best girl is bait </br></br></br>  <br><br>at least its better than defeating bait with "OP is a fag"</br></br>  So let me get this straight, other players landed in the past, and they were the ones that taught high level magic, well, "high", to people like the Theocracy? Does this imply the magic is inherently the same mechanic, just fully customizable here? Will Ainz start making his own spells?  <br> OP <br>that's like saying "omg he killed that rat! so OP!"</br></br>  <br>How much dialogue has been skipped? I've been following these threads on and off and kept reading that it has been adapted pretty well so far.</br>  <br>It has, but you have purists who feel like skipping anything at all is an unforgivable insult. Then they get all huffy and think you're shitting on the source material by saying it's fine to skip stuff, because they take it so personally. <br><br>They're already going really slow by taking 4 eps per volume, any slower and they'd barely get through volume 2 by the end of the cour.</br></br></br>  <br>Tons, the author is really generous with inner dialog.</br>  <br>Maybe magic is like engineering; all the parts have always been there, you just need to know how to put it all together.</br>  <br>Well, it's certainly possible that no magic existed before Yggdrasil players showed up and taught them long ago. What do you mean customizable though? As far as I can tell these guys are apparently casting the exact same spells Ainz is familiar with. And while they might be "inventing" spells it may just be them learning to duplicate untaught Yggdrasil spells that the original teachers didn't know.</br>  <br>There's magic Ainz doesn't know of. The contingency magic that murdered the one dude they were torturing.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, maybe I'll actually read the LN then, I think I have the mega link saved somewhere.</br></br>  People are saying that Demiurge misunderstood Momonga when he was talking about the treasures. What exactly did he misunderstand  <br>Even though that this is a faithful adaptation, I find it hard to not be disappointed when some core dialogue is left out.<br><br>For example, even an extra three minutes would have laid the background for what happens in Volumes 2 and 3. All Madhouse had to do was, say, have only one song play during episode 1, and remove the ED during episode 4.</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz said the world conquest would be enjoyable as a joke but Demiurge took it literally</br>  <br>True, but don't forget that while Ainz has an absurdly high capacity at 700 spells known, Yggdrasil has 6000+ spells in all so he might not be familiar with them all. Hard to say one way or another though the contingency magic and magic chanters inventing spells seems to prove what you say.</br>  <br><br>Should I just start Vol 1 or was it covered pretty well?</br></br>  <br>Start Vol 1.</br>  <br>Is that why he was also shocked when Ainz said it while they were flying?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Xu<wbr>kocjXhSs</wbr>  [ ]<br> "Don't you gimme your love and passion" <br> not "Won't*" <br>I can't help but be triggered by engrish in songs that have potential.</br></br></br></br>  So, is Stronoph, or whatever his name is, a reincarnated player?  <br>Yes</br>  Why do you guys like this show so much?<br><br>Seems kind of plain to me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This was some bad translation. How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'?<br><br>Would have been better translated as 'Long live Lord Ainz'. Jesus these subs are bad and my Japanese skills consists of a few years of school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN</br></br></br>  <br><br>What if she actually does not want you to give her your love and passion?</br></br>  <br>I'll bite. No I think its literally don't, she doesn't want it. (She has ainz you insect)</br>  <br> that pic <br><br>I kek'd.</br></br></br>  <br> fucks shit up <br>Coming from a chairfag I don't think that means too much anon</br></br>  <br><br> inflexible <br><br>shit maid, can't even bend her over your desk<br>0/10 can not bang</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now that I read that a third time, that actually makes sense. I still prefer "won't" through.</br></br>  <br>Standing up sex is best sex.</br>  <br>Albedo.<br>Shalltear.<br>Cocytus.<br>Papa Bones. <br>That's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz has a throne not a desk.</br>  <br>Personally, it's the character interactions. The Guardians are so loyal to Ainz that it's just terrific. Equally entertaining are the Guardian's relationship with each other. Episode 2 of the anime as well as Volume 3, the drama CD, and the last half of Volume 4 all display (to me) fantastic interactions. Fight scenes are pretty chill too.</br>  <br>Science is the study of our universes magic<br>Pretty cool when you think about it that way</br></br>  <br>I totally support Ainz taking Naberal as his wife after Albedo forces him to marry put a real ring on that finger. I mean heck, people already think they're doing the buisness behind the scenes.</br>  <br> Interesting Characters <br> Theme (MC is the OP evil overlord but evil neutral) <br> Skellington protagonist <br>   He chooses to use minimum force in order to carefully explore the world until the situation calls for it <br>Other than that, its Log Horizon except less about being a tactician mayor and more about being a conqueror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> its Log Horizon <br>Wow it's like I'm really on Reddit......</br></br>  <br>I wasn't aware Overlord was about a socially retarded outcast, glitching raidbosses</br>  <br>Are you new?</br>  <br>It's pretty much the same wish fulfillment bullshit as Danmachi. Nice Skeleton aesthetic, though.</br>  <br>Ainz has already daughter-zomed the entirety of Nazarick. Only CD, and Chair Jr. have any hope now.</br>  <br> Danmachi <br>Oh okay, you're just spouting random shows that fall into a similar category.</br></br>   Heil <br>Does he have a nazi minion? If no then nope I ain't calling mr Bones that.</br>    <br>He created a a level 100 Nazi uniform doppelganger, does that count?</br>  <br>You know he does anon</br>  Will this show get an s2?  <br>Hopefully not, because its gonna be almost all lizardmen and then uncle insect rekting them.</br>  <br>If it sells well enough</br>  <br>He has a desk too.<br>Bitches love desks.</br></br>  <br>Considering he cares enough for the game and not being a normalfag like his other guild members are, not really far from the truth.</br>  <br>Well, it is in the OP</br>  <br>But anon chairs aren't supposed to be bent over desks</br>  <br>And he will do the Gendo pose on the desk in volume 9</br>  <br>He has a job, why would he make a rule for his guildies to follow, that he wouldn't? They all just left the game after being burned out from getting everything required to make the guild staff. Just because he kept logging into the game, doesn't mean he's socially inept.</br>  <br>Of course not, silly.<br>Chairs go under desks.</br></br>  <br>I would still like to see that.</br>  <br>It's fine, you can admit the real reason you want vol 4 animated.</br>  <br>It's Funi, right? What can you expect from a bunch of retards wearing traffic cones on their heads?</br>  <br>Why hasn't he bothered thinking about going back to his world if he had friends and family to go back to? He seems to care about the game than his real life which started the whole story to begin with, being fussy that people in his guild left him only realizing that they didn't leave without giving a damn about the times they shared. A normal faggot wouldn't have sperged and slam the table dramatically and would've just logged off. Arguably, he could still be socially inept when he has godlike abilities that earns the respect and fear of everyone around him.</br>  <br> Ains <br> Ainz <br> Nazi </br></br></br>  <br>MIND BLOWN. AINZ IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SET UP THE 4TH REICH.</br>  <br>Because he isn't in the game, he's in a different world.<br>And that world happens to be far better than the 22nd-century hellscape he came from.</br></br>  <br>His job is a soulless office worker job in a future world that seems pretty shit, he gets along fine in life but he cherished his guild and could never let go of that.<br><br>He's interested in going home, but there is absolutely no hint at all how to do that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't he specifically say that he has nobody to go back to?</br></br>  <br>Yes, in the intro in fact.</br>  <br>This was explained in, like, the second episode, maybe first. He said that he doesn't have family or friends outside of the game. All he does is wake up, work all day, then go home and plays the game until he sleeps.<br><br>He said that was a really shitty life.</br></br></br>  <br>He's never expressed interest in going home. He says in the first volume that he has no friends or family to go back to in the real world.</br>  <br>Yep, his family's dead and his only freinds were his guildmates</br>  <br>Then get his ass kicked by Zaryushu or Hamsuke.</br>  <br>He's a magic caster, he has to sage.</br>  I want to do illegal things to Narberal!  <br>It could be worse.<br>He could go down to an autoattack from Victim.</br></br>  <br>I need to commission somebody to fufill all the fetishes.</br>  <br>Yeah actually. He made a shapeshifting nazi accountant back when he was chuuni</br>  <br>Did you not read book 2?</br>  <br>Can Victim even auto attack?</br>  <br>His physical attack is two points higher than his magic attack, for what it's worth.</br>  <br>...It is literally its entire method of attack</br>  <br>You sure anon?</br>  <br>Pee on me! Or worse.</br>  <br>Definately.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  So Novel readers does Ainz ever stop being OP( as in getting his ass whooped ever)?<br><br>kinda hope he is OP all the way through. seems pretty cool with all these different items and abilities</br></br>  <br>Well, he does put on an act of getting his ass kicked and has a rather close fight.</br>  <br><br><br>this artist is great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just that damn good, mang. Many of us, not only myself, started the anime, then moved onto the manga, then moved onto the LN to keep consuming the content of Overlord.<br><br>The last time I went so far for a series, was Haurhi's Disappearance movie back in '09 I believe, around there.<br><br>So yeah, fuck you kid, it's great.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What a beast.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm in the same situation. After the second episode I started reading the LN. Don't know why but this series has seriously captivated me.</br>  <br> jews <br> anyone that doesn't please me for free is a jew <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>They also translated "majin" as just "Demon".</br>  <br>Sometimes people do stuff that brings little to no profit for fun for themselves or others, shocking, right?<br>I know being jewish is hard, but try to pretend you're a human too.</br></br>  <br>Well they used Akuma as Devil, so what would be Demon?</br>  People that read the LN's, does he ever find another person from Yggdrasil, or even one of his guild mates?  <br>Unfortunately, it happens so rarely that it's hard to think of it as the rule, instead of the exception. The only show I can think of where people continually produced a show despite shitty sales is The World God Only Knows. Thank god for the fanartist who's doing all of these Naberal + Nazerick member though.</br>  <br>Nigga what? Are you talking about Madhouse or Funimation here?</br>  <br> Kind of </br>  Any request for webm, transparent, or stitches?  <br>I'd suffer through Lizardmen stuff to see Cocytus and the undead army, plus volumes 5 and 6.</br>  <br>But are you willing to sit through multiple episodes of almost nothing by Climb?</br>  <br>I almost want to say that the biggest segments of continuous Climb shouldn't take more than the first 12 min of the episode.</br>  Why skeletons are so great?   MAH WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL DIVINE MASTER OF EVERYTHING ALL HAIL LORD SKULL ALL HAIL HIS REIGN <br> repeat 100 times <br><br>This shit is awful<br>Every single episode has basically been non stop sasuga oniisama.<br>Even Mahouka wasn't this terrible with cock sucking and circlejerking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a archangel, he has some spells that come with the racial category, as well as job spells. <br><br>His most prominent ability is his  raid wiper nuke , but he should be able to fight by himself. He's probably stronger than most of the New World inhabitants by level alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Because there is  one inside of you </br>  <br>I'm still upset that there's no Cocytus Naberal.</br>  <br>Deliberately being overpowered isn't Gary Stu. Gary Stu is when you're supposed to be "normal" but you're blessed with plot armor.<br><br>For example, Kirito is supposed to be just another player but he somehow gets a unique Dual Wield skill in a video game and he gets to cheat death through willpower. That's Gary Stu.<br><br>Being at level cap and annihilating level 1 mobs is not Gary Stu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a pretty good idea.</br>  Why do you keep calling vampire loli a chair?  Remember to thank your saviour  Is the LN translated?  <br>its an epic meme from the ln</br>  <br>Ainz uses her as a chair eventually as punishment</br>  <br>Is it really a punishment ? Wouldn't she love it?</br>  <br>You misunderstand, it's for when he wants to punish himself.</br>  <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=overlord+light<wbr>+novel<br>Be thankful! I-It's not like I want to help you or anything!</br></wbr></br>  <br> it's for when he wants to punish himself <br><br>How's riding a vampire loli a punishment ?</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine finding yourself in that situation only to realize that you no longer have a dick. Not that your lich-feelings would let you enjoy it, anyway.</br>  <br>truly horrific.</br>  <br>He could almost certainly conjure up a penis.<br><br>The problem would be motivation to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>Having to sit on worst girl is pretty punishing if you ask me.</br>  I just want to see Albedo get boned.  BANZAI  A peasant girl turned bloody warlord takes over your town, kicks down your door, and tells you she's chosen you to warm her bed for the night.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  Succubi shouldn't be this moe.  <br>Of course they should</br>  <br>Warm her bed</br>  <br> you can't spell banzai without nazi </br>  <br>ALL HAIL AINZ</br>  It bet that it will only take another three volumes to Ainz rule the world (or at least conquest the neighboring countries in one way or another).  <br> abestacuteandachair.jpg <br><br>Keks were had.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she lacks proper stirrups or handlebars.</br>  <br>So moe</br>  <br>Isn't she the character that appears more in the series along with Ains?</br>  <br>I'd take one brown elf girl to go please.</br>  <br>OORU HAIRU BRITAINZIA</br>  <br>That's an imp brah-thah</br>  <br>Tomayto tomahto</br>  <br>midgets and vampires aren't the same tho</br>  Wait, is there going to be chibi episodes being released as well?  <br> facehugger maid <br> bimbo maid <br> /k/ommando maid <br> katana maid <br> furry maid <br>What's the last one?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lupus is Mikako Komatsu  This guy has some impeccable teeth for living in a medieval world. His teeth are on par with Guts.  <br>read the epilogue for volume 1, she's a Succubus, Imp is just her starting race(just like Ainz was Skeleton mage)</br>  <br>Maid specialized in giving head.</br>  <br> Bimbo maid <br>Calling an outer god a bimbo is hardly conducive to long life (she's a shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla)</br></br>  <br><br>She's both, I think. And possibly something else.</br></br>  <br> furry maid <br>Don't be stupid.</br></br>  <br>she's got 30 racial levels, 10 of which are Imp.<br>the max level a race or class can be is 15, 10, or 5.<br>thus she's got at least 3 races, and at most 5.</br></br></br>    <br><br>So imp, succubus and....what?</br></br>  <br> Lewd Beast </br>  <br>I'd guess fallen angel, and Succubi don't traditionally have feathery wings<br><br>your numbers are only accurate if each race is maxed out, if her creator went full retard she could have 21 different races</br></br></br>  <br> Semen Demon </br>  <br> How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'? <br><br>It's actually surprisingly reasonably close going by original meaning.<br>The thing is, "Banzai" obviously completely lacks the Nazi-association.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything about Ainz and Albedo please.<br>Or any stitchable scenes is fine too for collection purpose.</br></br>  I wonder if i show up guy from another vrmmorpg, like a not warhammer?  ainz-albedo dynamics remind me of these two  You wouldn't fug a npc right?  I love this anime, and I'm hyped for the next episodes, but there's something in the back of my head that tells me that this will become bad, like SAO did (first episodes good -&gt; rest bad)<br>Can any manga reader tell me if this will stay good?</br>  <br>This show is so fucking good. This has been a great summer so far.</br>  <br>aren't there other continents?</br>   You will never play Yggdrasil   So how does he fuck?  <br>Yggdrasil was pay2win as fuck, dude. It was most likely a terrible game.</br>  I don't understand why people fall in love with this series so much. Yeah, it's good, but it's not amazing. Just a solid 7.5/10.  <br>With his boner.</br>   Nigun's voice sounds so fucking familiar <br> Check his seiyuu <br> It's motherfucking Koyasu <br><br>You thought he was some second-rate voice actor, but it was HIM, DIO.</br></br></br></br>  <br> total level 62 <br> basic maths totals her levels up to 32 <br>Hold on a second here</br></br></br>  <br> others </br>  <br>Notice the "Others" listed at the bottom of her Job Level list.</br>  mfw this LN translation<br>Really wish I could into moon right now.</br>  <br>It's a 9 for me. Everything I would want out of this genre. It's really satisfying to see so much loyalty and admiration for the protag right from the jump for once. It's just somehow comfy too see a non-boy scout leader who still cares deeply for his followers. And of course, the sluts lusting for his boner.<br><br>Plus, the main character is a Lich. I fucking love skellies, Liches, Necromancers, and always thought they were misunderstood and made the villain too often.</br></br></br>   High Tiered Physical Nullification   <br><br>That's kind of lame.<br>Is it just so the author can throw in whatever he wants later or did the translators get lazy?</br></br></br>  <br>literally every single time these sheets are posted</br>  <br>Gorilla.</br>  <br> missing OTHERS <br>not all of her classes are listed, she's got 1 level of doppelganger and 62 class levels.<br>of those 62 class levels she's got at least 49 caster levels(every 7th caster level lets you cast one tier higher spells)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>Also, I don't know why the hell you'd think the translators got so lazy that they couldn't be bothered to write down the names of the other jobs. I mean, what? That's so irrational. Why bother translating the other names then?</br></br></br>  <br>If this gets to season 2 it has a small downtime but they payoff is totally worth it. Season 1 is mostly amazing though.</br>  <br>I would totally buy a figure of Mr Skeltal</br>  Am I the only who kinda doesn't like the name " Ainz ooal gown" ? Like, it's fine when they say "Lord Ainz" but whenever he says his full name I kinda cringe a bit. I honestly think "Momonga" was better. Hopefully it will grown on me  <br>Thanks m8</br>  <br> flying squirrel was better <br>que?</br></br>  <br><br>Where can I find the other profile cards for the other characters? Does Albedo have one?</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly relevant!</br>  <br>I keep thinking "own goal" when I see it, which is probably not the intention.</br>  <br>he was on GOMAD</br>  <br>Look it up on baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br>The illustration archive.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A spooky skeleton calls Flying Squirrel sounds scary as fuck.</br>  <br>Someone shoop Ainz's head to him.</br>  Muh OTP  ;_;   somebody post the LN art!  <br>I liked Momonga more at first, and was upset that he changes his name 4 episodes in, but apparently this <br> <br>Still, Ainz Ooal Gown is so 'Lich', it's growing on me pretty quickly</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I think not, it seems to be character driven and MC that doesn't use sword in online game genre seems to be more effective in this type of shows. Thing with SAO is its too focus on the MC being too OP with his sword.</br>  <br> they were misunderstood and made the villain too often. <br> Implying Papa Bones isn't 100% villain material </br></br>  <br>He's a bro though. Don't fuck with him, bow down like the lower life form you are, then you'll be alright.<br><br> You will never serve Ainz ;_; </br></br></br>   that fucking battle hamster in book 2 <br>I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that.</br>  <br>SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling.<br>This shit not only makes me nostalgic as a MMO player, it also riles up the D&amp;D faggotry in me.<br><br>Fucking double deal, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I felt so bad for her. Thanks based Sebas</br>  <br> SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling. <br>I have never been so disappointed by the execution of a concept as I was with SAO.</br></br>  <br>What a magnificent beast!</br>  So is this show One Punch Man and Log Horizon or SAO combined?  <br>If you say so</br>  <br>more like Bastard! and sao combined. now we just need heavy metal spell names</br>  <br>ops, I meant to say bastard and berserk</br>  I hope Papa Bones gets to rule the world.  Everyone is fucking level 100<br><br>Aintz is 100<br>Albedo is 100<br>Mare is 100<br>Aura is 100<br><br>You get a level 100 too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you're still here<br>Couldn't upload on 4chan, had to do it on imgur<br>http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg<br>I'm not a photoshop wizard</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be log horizon from the perspective of a dungeon boss</br>  <br>It's somewhat surprising how much emotion they are able to convey in a skeleton's face.<br>Is it the eyes?</br></br>  <br> http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg </br>  <br>You get level 100!<br>And you get level 100!<br>Everyone gets level 100!!!</br></br></br>  <br>looks like shit. the color palettes are clashing</br>  <br> how much emotion they are able to convey in a skeleton's face <br>Literally none?</br></br>  <br>I agree, malice is exactly one more emotion than skeletons are usually capable of portraying. That is pretty impressive.</br>  <br>It sounded cooler when they chose the name.<br><br><br>Based sebas though.<br><br>Just finished the most recent translation, can't wait for sebas to wreck shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Skeletons always have that happy smile on their faces. Pulling off such an ugly expression must be hard for the cuties.</br>  <br>It's definitely the eyes.</br>  People will definitely vector Momonga guild emblem and use it in their mmo guild logo soon or later. You guys should do it first instead.  Man this show is boring it's no fun when the MC just steamrolls everything  <br>Didnt all of his guild mates have their own emblem and flag?</br>  I for one welcome our new skeleton mage overlord.  <br>tell that to OPM, also the MC is pretty likable except when his thoughts start talking.</br>  <br>I was a fool to think this show wouldn't attract fight service faggots that just want le epic power level dick measuring.</br>  Why? Momonga sounds way cuter.  <br>Momonga is a jobber name.</br>  <br>You can see them at 20:10 ( 6 emblem ), and 20:47 ( 4 simple emblem ). I bet people will vector the big logo behind the throne.<br><br>Also I wonder if that sword inside shield logo in the left at 20:10 is Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Momon emblem is his face right.</br>  You think they'd be friends?  <br>Why do you screencap your mpc player?</br>  <br>That's nice.<br>I could've done it better but I don't feel so well.<br>Thanks anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm using Puu.sh, it's faster since I can link the result instantly.</br>  <br>You couldn't tell just from him talking? He changed nothing</br>  <br>A magnificent king indeed.</br>  Hell Flame? Someone should shop it to "flame posting".  What's the best/worst volume?  <br>3, 2, 4, 1</br>  <br> not do it in full screen <br>Nigga what ya doing</br></br>  <br>3 was the best for sure and while the first part of volume 4 wasn't that good, the last part made up for it so I can't even say 4 for worse.</br>  <br>3&gt;2&gt;4&gt;1</br>  <br>Waste of size since I'm not showing anything requiring detail.</br>  What is the rating for Overlord in Japan right now?  <br>3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;4</br>  <br>Best : 7<br>Worst : 4</br></br>  <br>If we're going by future volumes, 9 seems to be the absolute best so far. Ainz truly becomes  the Overlord and a king at the end of that. </br>  <br>Trash tier.</br>  <br><br>From what I have read so far.<br><br>3 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 ½<br><br>Seriously, fuck Climb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had a similar revelaiton when I went back and watched Excel Saga, as I had only seen the dub when I was weeaboo youngun, I feel as though I had been deprived. It's weird to explain to people who don't watch subbed anime how you can recognize a foreign VA.</br></br>  <br>No food additives, that shit fucks your teeth up and lack of proper diet.<br>Sure there would be some rot in just about everyones teeth but not to the point they'd look truly disgusting.</br></br>  Proof that Eve truly is the best girl. The fact that I got a belz from her a few days ago makes it even better  <br>Well VRMMO with freedom to create any class, with most shit like spooky skeleton death lord being ultra hidden sure sounds fun. I wouldn't mind throwing money at it.</br>  <br>Stitch of the pan showing the standoff between the Ainz and the Slane guys, please.</br>  <br>3 &gt; 2 &gt;= 4 &gt; 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; what's translated of 5</br>  Reminder  <br>That elf has som curse. Who would dres such a cute girl with men clothes.</br>  <br>I'm so glad I started reading the LN translation first before watching the anime. Ainz's human VA voice, while plausible, sounds too jarring.<br><br>Why can't more MMO-anime/manga/LNs be decent?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay, her brother makes up for it.</br>  <br>Albedo is truly disgusting.</br>  Is the leader of Blue Rose actually a chuunibyou or is that a property of the sword of darkness she's wielding? Kind of like Toshi from Gintama?<br><br>I can't imagine a chuuni could reach adamantium... seems like something that happened after the fact</br></br>  <br>Chuuni.</br>  Is he in any kind of danger at any point during the story?<br><br>Watching a max level overpowered guy just trample over everything with everything at his disposal is getting kinda boring.</br></br>  <br>How hard are those 20 levels in "Other" races to notice? They are not revealed just so her True form remains a mystery, could be from Succubus to Arch demon to Donkey Kong for all we know.</br>  <br>Wait till vol 3 gets adapated</br>  <br> Watching a max level overpowered guy just trample over everything with everything at his disposal is getting kinda boring. <br>Sure because you've seen it all of 2 episodes.<br><br>Nigga just drop it. I highly doubt it's going to be your cup of tea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even with cheating by using p2w items, he almost loses his fight in the third volume... he only wins due to even more cheating.</br>   I changed my name <br> to the same name! </br>  <br> implying watching Ainz and co. stomp fools isn't hilarious </br>  <br>He's in constant danger nigga. Nothing is more dangerous than being paranoid as fuck. Ainz's ultimate weakness is his self.</br>  <br>Ants don't have skeletons, silly.</br>  <br>This season is criminally fun.</br>  <br>No, to the point where he is willing to depower himself consistently to the point where he can just barely maintain absolute control of the situation.</br>  <br>He was momonga, so he changed his name to his guild's name to better spread it.<br><br>He only those those villagers it was ainz because it sounded more imposing</br></br></br>  <br>If your gonna do that than capture area, even so you uploaded the image all it takes to screen cap is alt+I.</br>  <br>His previous name was Momonga, you donk</br>  <br>The tension is in being sucked into an MMO and potentially fatally dieing. He's at no danger from NPCs but other PCs with similar abilities might be out there and could end him at any time. <br>But, not all anime gets tension from danger. In this case there is also the drama between the NPCs and the drama of being potentially permanently trapped in such a world. He's basically playing in it right now, not taking it too seriously. But it will get serious.</br></br>  <br><br>against what?<br><br>we just saw it wreck a top tier angel with no effort</br></br></br></br>  <br>The most dangerous person against ainz is himself</br>  Question for the readers: what are the chances that this is all a dream?    Japanese flying squirrel-sama!   <br>I'll kill maruyama/10</br>  <br> Ainz's ultimate weakness is his self. <br><br>Deep.</br></br></br>  <br>Himself<br><br>And Chair and gorilla</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright you got me. I bet one of his guildies is going to show up and think he's a fuck nigga for stealing the guild name.</br></br>  <br><br>/a/ please.</br></br>  <br><br>  Chair <br><br>why do they fight? I saw it in the OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>That angel probably is low mid tier at best, they only think it's the strongest because they're ignorant. It's noted that there are angels that he would have to be on guard for and possibly retreat from but Nigan is too much of lil bitch to summon them</br>  Where's muh OP single YAYAYA  <br> top tier angel <br>It was a level 7 summon. There are 9 levels. To a lvl100 player, a level 7 summon is a punk-ass bitch, not a top tier at all.</br></br>  <br>He gets counterpicked</br>  <br>"Oh god I'm getting boned plz no shit"</br>  <br> She gets mindcontrolled </br>  <br>August 26.  I wish I could go to sleep for a month and wake up to OP and ED singles, 4 episodes, and 4 more chapters. </br>  Currently reading vol.3<br>If Shaltear really turns into a chair I am fucking dropping this.</br>  This is not being as good as promised so far. Does it evolve past Ainz being too powerful for the world and everyone on his side just loving him?   Shaltear turns into a chair <br>...what</br>  <br>She turns into a chair in vol 4</br>  <br>No. You should drop it and save yourself some agitation.</br>  <br>The purpose is to help locate other players provided they recognize it.<br><br>Mostly for his guild buddies, HE WANTS to be found</br></br></br>  <br>No sane man would love some fucking skeleton who is about to rekt the assholes of your country</br>   SPREAD THE NAME OF AINZ OOAL GOWN TO THE WORLD <br> grand display just and over the top shit just so he could find his old buds <br> ;_; <br><br>Why is this guy so fucking moe? <br>Ainz is perfect. Holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Its actually really overrated.</br></br>  <br>Hasn't he changed his mind about this though. Didn't he realize that getting his name out there might not necessarily be a good thing, especially after Chair's incident?<br><br>Does he even know about PDL yet?</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't get it.<br>Does she turn into an ACTUAL chair or does she just let Papa Bones sit on her?<br>Because if it's the former, fuck this shit.  I hope I'm just being incredibly retarded. </br></br></br>  What is this chair thing about?<br>Why would he turn one of his top ranking subordinates into a fucking chair?</br>  <br>Even the most strongest skelly is lonely</br>  <br>Good news. It's the latter.<br><br>Bad news. You are fucking braindead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She gets turn into a chair temporally as punishment.</br></br>  <br> She lets Papa Bones sit on her as punishment for attacking him when she was mind controlled. </br>  <br>Figuratively is the key here. Not actual IKEA product.</br>  <br>You're just being incredibly retarded.</br>  <br><br>Salaryman skeletons just want some love, man.</br></br>  <br>It might bring his old guild buddies who he still cared about from what I can see.<br><br>It might also bring about other players who are also stuck there, its a calculated risk</br></br></br>    <br>How many volumes is this temporary?<br>Does she get a fetish of being sit on?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>All is good in the world then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only a couple of paragraphs anon</br>  <br>10/10<br>it was years since I saw a good edit of that</br></br>  <br>Thats fine then.</br>  <br>As punishment.  even though she was pretty much orgasming constantly from having her Ainz-sama on her. </br>  <br>Constant orgasms can be painful.</br>  <br>10 levels standard magic plus Over magics.<br>incidentally that Angel is over level 50</br></br>    <br>I want a figure of Papa Bones!</br>  <br>The red valkyrie he fights in the OP is basically designed to kill him  by his best friend. </br>  <br>In anime world it only makes you ahegao and start blabbering<br> Hain-hamaaaaaa... </br></br>  <br>"Very Extremely Evil"</br>   reading the third volume <br> Shalltear goes True Vampire on the bandits <br>NOPE<br>NOPE<br>NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE</br></br></br></br>    <br> 10 levels standard magic <br>Hmm, guess I assumed it worked like D&amp;D magic, since its so similar.</br></br>  <br>That epic mount yo!</br>  QUESTION?<br><br>I read this once and dropped it cause it was retarded Gary Stu shit. Does it ever improve or is this just another show where the MC spends 12 episodes being inherently better than everyone else?</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> He is the last boss. Of course he will be better then everyone. </br>  <br>If it didn't get better we wouldn't be here. I myself didn't really care for it that much until the third volume, which is just fantastic the entire way through</br>  <br>See, you make it seem like the show will switch perspective to a different group and that would amazeballs,<br><br><br>but then this butthurt faggot makes it seem like I was right on the money with my description.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the MMO version of mahouka (praised be onii-sama), so if you enjoy curbstomps, keep watching.</br>  How is papabone in real life ?<br>Does the LN ever reveal information about his true self ?<br>Wat kind of job demand him to wake up a 4:am</br></br>  <br>What makes you think the angel is over 50?</br>   mfw the seemingly unfortunate Theocracy mage who got beheaded by Albedo is actually the one who got off lightly. <br>Damn it, Neuronist.</br>  <br>What, in a series about skeletons THIS is what spooks you?</br>  <br>Just drop it anon. It'll probably be better for you.</br>  <br>A salaryman. He pretty much handle his current guild like a corporation.</br>  <br>He's a wageslave and failed salesman. He spent a third of his income buying pay2win Yggdrasil bullshit.</br>  <br><br><br>Thank you for the direct answers. This is definitely a skip for me.</br></br></br>  <br>for every 7 levels in a class that can cast magic you get one tier higher. the Angel cast Smite which is 7th tier needing 49 holy caster class levels and at least one level of angel( but is unlikely to only have one level in angel), thus a minimum of 50 levels</br>  Alright the Chinese Updated chapter 4 of Volume 9<br><br>i will cont where i left off from last night<br><br> Kingdom has 2 Factions,Royalist and Nobles<br><br>Those in the Nobles faction take up the left and right flank,while Royalist is in the middle.Alright with that said,i can begin<br>After Aniz cast Iä!Shub-Niggurath! on the Kingdom left flank,the spell consume 70 000 soldiers and spawn 5 of these Goats.He relay his orders,destroy the kingdom's army but spare the lives of these 4 individuals.<br><br>Cue mass panic but officers of the kingdom shouted "Form Up" to arrange the soldiers into a spearwall<br><br>The goats charged into the ranks and trample the army,tentacles were used to fling or slam onto the soldiers.Now,the Kingdom morale began to dip to its lowest point.<br><br>"Retreat!!" "No!!,not like this" <br><br>Now the army has turned into a unorganized mob<br><br>One Goat is charging into the back of the Royalist faction army,while another Goat was about the kill Raeven but it stopped<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  Wait, isn't Ainz basically a god in the new world?<br>I'm thinking he was more on the level of the  Six Gods  than on the  8 Greed Kings  or the t two of the 13 Heroes. </br>  <br>Ainz is immune to all damage from enemies lower than level 60. The Angel actually dealt damage to him, thus should be over level 60.</br>  <br>We're happy to be of assistance.</br>  <br>Why not Raeven though? Did Ainz make a deal with Gazef or something?</br>  <br>Just a quick question but how strong are the floor guardians compared to ainz?<br><br>Seems like they would be stronger since they are each supposed to be a boss for a raid/party and I would but think they can be solo by a single player</br></br></br>  <br>I admit, I feel bad for the Kingdom. The empire doesn't seem to be much better than them. It's just that the Emperor plays politics better than then. Though if Renner ever becomes Queen, the Empire will probably be in trouble.</br>  <br>huh, I for got to factor that in. so it likely had 10 levels in Archangel and between 49-57 caster levels(can't have 58 as that would give it 8th tier spells)</br>  https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ltxhw<wbr>P3p-hc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So whens Spinal gonna show up?</br></br>  <br>Most of them are min maxed where as Ainz isn't really. Ainz main advantage is that he is much more experienced in combat than they are and knows how they are all built, where as the guardians dont know much about Ainz.</br>  <br>Ainz is actually  one of the Six Gods. </br>  <br> Weaker if not equipped with best gears <br> Equal or stronger in full gears <br>Ainz shouldn't have problem going one on one, but if the guardians team up on him. He is toast.</br></br></br>    <br>just because he doesn't have a dick doesn't mean he can't bone her</br>  <br>I want to rape Mare and have Aura rape me.</br>  <br>I want to pat Mare.</br>  <br>Best waifus.</br>  <br> &gt;spare the lives of these 4 individuals.<br>Which ones?<br/></br> </br>  <br><br>How the hell are they supposed to be good at their job if they can each be solo by a single player?<br><br>What kind of mmo is this where a single player is stronger than all the npcs?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are dumb NPCs. Keep in mind that now that they are alive they aren't actually dumb and are learning.</br>  <br> What kind of mmo is this where a single player is stronger than all the npcs? <br><br>I played MMOs where fully decked out top players could solo dungeon bosses. It took a lot of time, wasn't efficient and did cost a lot of consumable items but it was possible.</br></br></br>  <br>There are MMOs where a skilled player can solo raid bosses (assuming he wants to spend about 10x as much time to do so than with a full raid party).</br>  <br>Remember, the MMO they originated from is pay2win type.<br>Level and gear grinding will be time consuming. Well there is strong guilds in the game, most players that try to raid Ainz tomb is just scrubs.<br><br>Ainz guild are filled with pay2win fagets. Cash/skills &gt; skills.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rest of the Goat are now wrecking havoc at the right Flank<br><br>Empire Side POV<br><br>Aniz took off his mask revealing his true form.One of the Goat ran towards Empire and kneel in front of Aniz<br><br>Aniz stood ontop of its tentacles and spoke with Emperor<br><br>He had expected his majesty to send out cavalry after his spell but he did not.<br>Aniz added its understandable considering the carnage the Goats did amongst the kingdom army and he will finish the job for him<br><br>Aniz told mare to stay guard with the 500 DK<br>and went off to find his target<br><br>The emperor was terrified and speechless after Aniz gave his speech.He thought Aniz did not treat the alliance seriously and will soon turn his army towards him<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>I meant before they were alive. How were they useful if they have the stats of a single player</br>  <br>In Neverwinter OT Terra i usually see some players solo raid bosses like it was nothing</br>  <br>People seem to keep insisting the game was pay2win but from what ive read only stuff you could pay for is consumables, vanity items and add some customability to your dungeon.</br>  <br>Because in previous situations it was always base defense, so it wouldn't have been just the guardians, it would've also been all the shit on their respective floors.</br>  <br>Another thing.<br>The Guardian are just distraction for raiding players well the Ainz guild members cut them down to size from the side.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Demiurge deal with the princess was 3 person will be kept alive,Aniz added 1 more<br><br>i know of the Climb and Raeven was among the 3<br><br>Aniz 4th is Gazef<br/></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>The guardians was made just to delay raiders. The real muscles are the actual guild members.</br>  <br> Climb <br>Can't believe this faggot gets a free ride.<br><br>   Gazef <br>Didn't he die?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it said they stay at the final room of the dungeon to be the final bosses during raids?</br>  <br>Finish vol 3 and see if you can still say it's not pay2win.</br>  <br><br>Thanks. Better to drop if the powerwankery will continue.</br></br>  <br>That can't be true because Crusch can cast tier 3 spells while being level 17. Now admittedly she is a druid, but I doubt the spell progression varies that much.<br><br><br>Ainz is immune to attacks below level 60, not people below 60. And don't forget that the angel also used a one time only skill to boost the strength of a single spell once. There is no way to even know if it normally has an attack power over 60 or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Normally they're backed up by an entire floor of lesser minions + the guild itself.</br>  <br>So the alliance with the  Empire  is still valid?<br> Shit.</br></br>  <br>I'm already past it so if there was something pay2win then I didn't notice it or dont remember anymore.</br>  <br> yup he did,im trying to finish the chapter </br>  <br>The item that let Ainz equip 10 rings instead of 2, was you guessed it, a p2w item.</br>  <br> &gt;Ainz using an Eldrtichspawn as a chair <br><br>Magnificent. <br><br><br> According to full spoilers, he dies guarding the retreat, so Ainz spares all the soldiers that are running instead of just the 4 he promised, as a sign of respect for Gazef.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take your time, kind anon.</br>  <br><br>Also, Ainz is vulnerable to Holy Magic. So the Angel could be lvl 50 and dealt an stronger attack.</br></br>  <br> cash shop consumables that allow you to cast a super level spell instantly <br> cash shop item that lets you switch equipment instantly <br> cash shop item for the wishing ring <br> cash shop item to get a total of 10 ring equipment slots instead of just 2 </br></br></br></br>  <br>ainz is a gentleman</br>  <br>cain would get fucked so hard.<br><br>now jurgen is a different story.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot for this! Would you or someone else be kind enough to make other quality stitches/screenshots from the ED please?</br>  <br>Regardless of what you think of him, Ainz almost always keeps his word.</br>  <br>Because their job isn't to fight solo against single player but to fight with spaw mobs and on their floor.<br>I think people misunderstood few things when Ainz said Shalltear is the strongest floor guardian, the more deeper players advance the more difficult it get.<br> <br>Floor 1-3: <br>only spaw weak undead mobs, full of traps <br>and Ainz said even with a 1500 man raid they only fight 1v1 against Shalltear, she probably has some kind of ability that make her stronger the more enemies she must fight.<br><br>floor 4:<br>Lake with a giant golem Gargantula (stonger than Shalltear and probably the only you could call a raid boss)<br><br>floor 5:<br>the whole floor have a slow debuff and deal constanly ice dmg with a ics fortress in the middle.<br>If you don'tfind and defeat the floor guardian fast enough your whole raid team would lose.<br><br>floor 6:<br>players must fight agaisnt a army of strong lvl 90 NPCs that get buffed through one hunter and one support mage elf twin.<br><br>floor 7:<br>I don't know probably a lava theme floor full of traps and probaly deal fire dmg to fuck up everyone who bought ice res equipment for the 5th floor.<br><br>floor 8:<br>ALLAHU AKBAR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ShallChair has a world item used on her, Papa Bones wreks her vampire pussy then resurrects her cause that pussy is so broken, arms would fit easily inside. <br><br>Some time passes and Demibro crafts a bone chair for the father of bones, but being a human on the inside, he makes up the excuse of punishing ShallChair by sitting on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonder if they'll ever show the chair scene in the anime. There's just no way to do it without it being weird/creepy as fuck, Ainz sitting on a loli and all.</br>  <br>But Heil means exactly that.</br>  <br> Floor 1-3: <br> and Ainz said even with a 1500 man raid they only fight 1v1 against Shalltear, she probably has some kind of ability that make her stronger the more enemies she must fight. <br><br>Shalltear liches HP fairly easily. She can probably use the endless spawning skeletons as stuff to raise her health. <br><br><br> floor 7: <br> I don't know probably a lava theme floor full of traps and probaly deal fire dmg to fuck up everyone who bought ice res equipment for the 5th floor. <br><br>This lvl is where the stronger 'sentient' NPCs are. Demiurge's bros. In floor six the only lvl 90 NPCs are Aura 's pet. <br><br> floor 8: <br> ALLAHU AKBAR <br>Also a floor that is so dangerous that NPCs were forbidden to venture inside. Possible a lot of strong NPCs plus the other lvl100 NPC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> deal constanly ice dmg <br><br>that sounds like you exploit the hell out it if you had something like Ice Absorbing equipement</br></br></br>  How long until we're hearing Sieg Nazarick! With PA leading the salutes?  I started reading the LN recently and it's fucking amazing.  <br> 8th floor <br>Based fucking Victim.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget the huge ass roach.</br></br>  <br> Constant ice dmg <br>Reminds me of someone</br></br>  <br>Yggdrasil has Friendly fire on, so no Shalltear cant kill the mobs for health</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's a pretty good power fantasy. Because the ones in power, aren't idiotic cut outs and the story is in the world of the weaker beings as we witness events from their perspective.</br></br>  <br>What level are floor guardians and how strong are they compared to a max level player. <br><br>Are there other players in the world</br></br></br>  2 weeks ago<br> waaa this series is shit <br> DROPPED <br><br>this week<br> HEIL AINZ <br> AOTS <br><br>and after it's done you'll all probably hate it again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe there is a new chapter out every saturday. So within the year it should all be translated and caught up at the current pace.</br>  <br><br>Welcome to /a/ - bi polar autism wonderland</br></br>  <br> <br>Kingdom POV<br><br>With the Goat approaching from the back,Gazef advised his King Lanposa III to retreat,but Lanposa was depressed after that slaughter.He told his Gazef and his warriors to save themselves.<br><br>Gazef was having none of it and proclaim that he will even tie his majesty if he has to<br><br>Lanposa relent,Gazef suggest to escape on foot,3 of the Goats are chasing Nobles that are fleeing on horseback.<br><br>Gazef volunteer to be Vanguard,Climb and Brain stay behind too.Climb pick up a flag and start waving it to attract the Goat attention<br><br>Lanposa told them to return alive and he can have anything that he wish,Brain requested the princess to be marry to Climb.His majesty seems to approved.<br><br>Lanposa and Gazef fistbumps and bid farewell<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>yur mum</br>  <br>Shalltear has Blood Frenzy, she becomes more powerful as she is covered in blood at the cost of sanity on top have having a life stealing lance, so she should be hard to kill in a prolonged fight with weaker enemies she can feed her abilities with.</br>  So has Vol 5 been completed yet?  <br>no 2 chapters missing</br>  <br>Soloing BAMs as a lancer in TERA was fun before they lobotomized them.</br>  <br>Damn. Can't wait for it to be finished so I can read. Thanks for the info though.</br>  <br>Fuck the shit out of her</br>  <br>Bro-tier Brain.</br>  Yesterday I've started playing this game and I've noticed a striking similarity with Overlord<br><br>It's like you're playing as one of the Floor Guardians except you have the Raise Undead spell which you can use at all times as long as there are suitable targets<br><br>Any anon ever heard of it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hygiene is the only way to get teeth that look like that, simply eating correctly isn't enough</br>  <br>It's not like there will be that many nobles around to disagree anymore.  Its like Ainz wants the Kingdom to self-stabilize, he uses 3/5 of the goats to kill off the majority of the Nobility faction that was opposing the king. I also suppose that the last person Ainz ordered the goats not to kill was the King. </br>  How is the censorship in the anime?  <br>There's a frame or two but they show decapitation and people being chopped in half.</br>  <br>Almost nonexistent up untill now</br>  <br><br>I hope they wont butcher the  HUG </br></br>  <br> No food additives, that shit fucks your teeth up <br>Sugars and carbohydrates, actually. Those stimulate bacterial growth and rot your teeth. And things like tobacco and caffeine stain teeth yellow. If you have a diet that is almost entirely meat and water, your teeth don't deteriorate and look naturally white.</br></br>  <br>Just went and checked, though nobody cares.<br>Funi did "Hail Lord Ains Ooal Gown"</br></br>  If I start the LN where would post episode 4 be ? Would read what already got animated later but for now I really want to know how its progressing further.  <br>Gruesome as fuck.</br>  <br>NO<br>NO FUCK YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR YOU MAGGOTY PEICE OF SHITE</br></br>  Episode 4 airs in 15 minutes.<br>Will Red stop being an overly emotional bitch?

I don't know why everybody hates her. Maybe it's because I like Touyama Nao  <br>  according LN spoiler <br>There is no such a spoiler you can stop being tryhard now.</br></br>  <br>I thought Lecty was the best too. News to me that everyone hates her.</br>   Episode 4 making Misora into the best the best girl beyond all doubts <br><br>Why would anyone expect different?</br></br>  <br>Why can you be so sure of it?</br>  <br>Yellow had like one, maybe two fans over the past 3 weeks.Bluefags and Redfags usually put her last or near last.</br>  Well this episode just confirmed it.

Don't you get tired trying to make Red sound retarded and bad by exaggerating and projecting?</br>  <br>So why he would?</br>  Mama Red made this episode. That body and that personality.
