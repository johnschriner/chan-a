They said episode 3 will be done by this weekend.</br>  Why is Anna so  lewd?   <br>With her lewd side being held back for so long it's not wonder she'd be most lewd when she finnaly finds her "indecent" side.</br>  <br>I want to fuck her so bad.</br>  <br>you mean get fucked</br>  <br>I'm fine with either.</br>  <br>someone post the webm please</br>  How the hell do they expect the world to function in that world. I mean future adults would probably be completely ignorant of how to make children, or at least if they do find out life would be nothing but a boring ordeal all the way to your deathbed.<br><br>I'm kinda wondering if the story leads into some sort of comspirancy where it was actually someone hoping for exactly that, or was it just a "because i want a world without filth" thinking it wouldn't have consequences?</br></br>  <br>A lot of people who go on some moral crusade against this or that often fail to see the negative consequences their action will bring. A good example of this is of course Prohibition in the good ole US of A, where outlawing alcohol not only had the effect of INCREASING alcohol consumption, but also creating a massive criminal underground, and an entire counterculture that brought about a lot of social change.<br><br>Japan's method's in Shimoneta are more draconian, and therefor somewhat more effective, but they're having roughly the same effect, creating a criminal underground and counterculture that thrive on the illegal pornography. Of course the ban on lewdness in any form has another effect. Due the apparent lack of comprehensive sex ed, the Japan in Shimoneta is essentially raising an entire generation of adults that will have no clue what they're doing when it comes to procreation. This will have a few probable effects: Couples will have no idea how sex control works, so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. Couples will have no idea sex is even a thing, and will go their entire lives with out doing the act, and/or they will go about doing it wrong and never have kids. Lastly, you'll have couples going to underground or criminal sources for information on sex, both breaking down the very public moral that Japan is trying to enforce, and increasing crime where none existed before.<br><br>I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We wish we knew. The LN hasn't been translated while the manga only has 2 chapters translated. The only part of the LN that was translated was the love honey cookies scene. Hopefully some kind anon will work on it.  ;_; </br>  <br>Well it is a gag show, but it kinda takes itself seriously when explaining the repercussions it would have. Until Kajou throws in a random dirty joke out of nowhere that is.</br>  <br>I have no real basis for this but I don't think the pregnancy is going to be an issue.<br>Menstruation would cause way too many questions can't be answered without setting off the chokers so I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it. Granted I'm not a girl but it's really not hard to believe that suddenly bleeding from your crotch for days when you have no idea wtf is going on will cause freakouts.<br>There's just no plausible way i can think of for it to be explained to teenage girls without getting carted off to jail.<br>In essence we now have a generation that's essentially going to be sterile.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There are similar problems to countries today which don't have comprehensive sex education. Basically people getting married or into relationships and having no idea what to do next.<br><br>Unwanted pregnancies, STDs spreading rampantly, general ignorance and superstition, or even insane cases like that one woman who used the wrong hole for 40 years.</br></br></br></br>  Saotome and her voice reminded me of that one woman from the Incredibles  <br>Still waiting for Hiryuu subs.</br>  <br>Anon, get in.</br>  <br><br> "Tonight's special: A thick, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br> I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it <br>I highly doubt it given Japans population issues, also this wouldn't be the first time women would be in an environment where menstruation couldn't be adequately explained. When there's a lack of actual knowledge on something, people tend to just make shit up. I wouldn't be overly surprised to find that parents or educators, lacking the ability to properly explain the process, use overly vague terms, or stupid shit like "it's the lewdness/bad thoughts/devil, draining out" or "it's just something that happens to everyone, don't worry about it".</br></br>  <br> I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun. <br>That's the thing, many shows that seem to be just gag shows with a ridiculous premise are actually engaging in some social commentary. This has plenty of it, Humanity Has Declined had plenty of it, Excel Saga had a shitload of it...</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your dicks, sir.</br></br></br>  <br><br> so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. <br> rampant pregnancies <br><br>This is Japan, after all. Perhaps this is the actual goal, to increase the number of pregnancies for the sake of Japan's future.</br></br></br></br></br>  So who's getting rape?  <br>The problem with that is that, when people don't know how pregnancies work, it can lead to a lot of problems. Bad care of the fetus, improper timing that makes life loads more difficult, plus on top of that with out knowing about birth control, after you've figured out the whole baby making bit, your either going to be pumping out so many kids it's going to affect your economic standing, leading to an overall increase in poverty, or you'll have people just abstaining from sex, putting a strain on marriages and potentially leading to an increase in divorces or spousal abuse/infidelity, thus creating a breakdown in public morals. <br><br>The system is almost designed to rip itself apart given enough time, and cause some serious damage to Japanese society.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the black one the biggest? There is some mistake here waiter.</br>  <br>Everyone.</br>  <br>MC is getting raped</br>   yfw Clawhammer gets episode 4 out before Hiryuu gets episode 3 out     I detect a very high lewdness from the girl with the permablush that sits next to MC.  <br><br> hiryuu </br></br>  <br>You're not the only one.</br>  <br><br> Anna's ass <br> Kajo's ass <br><br>Which one first?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to teach anyone how to procreate. Animals get by just fine without a class and so can humans. Literal retards understand how to put penis in vagina and cumming is natural so a baby eventually happens.</br>  <br> implying Kajo won't do your ass first </br>  <br>Animals have better instincts than humans. Literal retards are at least exposed to the concepts involved, rather than being entirely shielded from them. Someone who's never even heard about what's involved could feasibly not work out for themselves that this goes in that until this happens. Sure, many will get there via trial and error, but not 100% of people.</br>  <br>Considering Kajo's libertine mindset she probably makes an effort to never wipe her ass leaving an old and crusty layer of shit surrounding her anus. <br><br>Just like that judge in the nights of sodom.</br></br></br>  <br>Anna has the bigger ass.</br>  <br><br><br>Get this normal shit out of here</br></br></br>  <br>Wut</br>    <br>yeah same</br>    <br>What manga</br>    <br>Well that couple pissed away their chance of having kids.</br>  <br>The design looks like MATRA Milan but idk which of his work.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VGg<wbr>_HTls8ME</wbr>  [ ]</br>  New episode when?

DOESN'T IT!!</br>  <br>Even a one night stand is worth it.</br>  Is this that series that had a terrible anime adaptation that ruined the whole point/spirit of the manga? Or am I thinking of something else?  I still don't get the author.<br><br>In Genshiken, Madarame falls in love with Saki, but basically gets shot down hard because the author wants to shove muh dose of realism down our throats and now he goes and turns Madarame into being ok with sucking gay dick so he can have some meta yaoi relationshit with a gender confused trap. If he was ok with pandering to fantasies, he could have given us the Saki end to begin with.</br></br>  <br>Author likes traps, not Sakis.</br>  <br>Spotted Flower being a thing makes it pretty clear he regrets going with the 'muh realism' end to the original.</br>  merkel.jpg  <br>maybey it is realism<br>losers like him would have to settle for a trap</br></br>  <br>But you don't know yet if he's okay with sucking dicks. It's pretty obvious that the trap will win the harem, but that doesn't mean that they will stay together. Thinking the trap is sexy and trying to kiss him is one thing, dating him and having sex is another. The realism route is having them dating for a while and then breaking up.</br>  <br>How the hell can you turn down such an angel?</br>  <br><br> sucking dicks <br>most trannies are way too insecure about their penises to let you suck them off.<br>Madarame can pound that boypussy no problem though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you know this?</br>  <br> muh dose of realism <br>Author dropped realism when he went full harem antics.<br> If he was ok with pandering to fantasies, he could have given us the Saki end to begin with <br>But then the manga would be over with nothing to tell and no more income for him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The author is actually being very realistic in getting Madarame to realize that the reason he turned to otakudom was because he was always gay and in the closet. It's just that now that he's lost his excuses he has to confront his true nature.</br>    <br>And with this, this manga has reached its lowest point. Haisebitch and Qshit are killing the manga.<br>What a shame.</br></br>  <br>i agree with you, anon</br>  <br>you are right, sadly</br>  <br>I have more faith in the Autisma's OVA, I mean look at this quality. Pierrot changed staff, so maybe it could be decent.</br>  <br>It looks like Kyoani tier animation.</br>  OK let me get this straight, anons<br>ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped.<br>And then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter even when almost no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter.<br>Then we bitch about IS being slow.<br>Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter, and even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it and keep bitching about anything we can.<br>Oh and we bitch about tumblr too<br>Am I getting things right, anons?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, this is basically what TG threads are for until ishida delivers</br>  <br>yeah, they complain about anything. It's called being a tg speed reader.</br>  <br>This. I want impatient shonenfags to leave.</br>  If the chapter is shit and nothing fucking happens, we will call it as it is.<br><br>I swear you guys are the worst. Do you guys think we like to complain? At some point, we all loved this manga.</br></br>  <br>We also fuck each other in the ass.  /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. </br>  <br>If you loved this manga you'd know how the manga was in the beginning. But you don't seem to.</br>  <br> /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. <br>I agree, tumblr is actually better, they always have discussions going about symbolisms and shit. So does reddit. Here? Waaaaaah nothing happened.</br></br>  <br>TG was exactly the same you faggot.</br>  <br><br><br> even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it <br>When some shit actually happens we talk/joke about it, you fucking niggas. <br>Stop being Ishida's defenders and read the past threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm fine with tokyo ghoul, its not super fast paced until shit goes down. I like the buildup, characterization, etc. I like Haise and the Q's, some some terrible shit is probably going to happen to them and its already building up. Also last chapter we got to see the ccg guy who tortured Yamori   will probably torture Haise because parallels  . I know people don't like it, for some people they have concerns that sound legitimate, but lets be honest the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re:</br>  Ishida drawing Ihe Hairu, listening this song from osterreich:<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/onlyifyoucal<wbr>lme/5yzf8sel7xvu</wbr></br></br>  <br><br> TG was exactly the same you faggot <br>I want disgusting newfags to leave.<br>Here is a example of our talks when Re started. But as the manga kept focusing in Qshit our talks kept being shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion unlike Tokyo Ghoul threads on achan. All I see people do is complain about nothing happening for every chapter.<br><br>Hopefully that changes.</br></br></br>  <br> the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re: <br>The threads became shitty after trap's revelation of being a trap. I know because that day I was here.</br></br>  <br> those hands <br><br>yup that's ishidas art</br></br></br>  <br>There are still discussion to be had anon. I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. It's not being a newfag or anything.</br>  <br><br>It's much better than that Tsukiyama pic</br></br>  <br><br> The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion <br>Of course m8.</br></br></br>  <br>I like it more than I ever have. Then again, I didn't start reading until TG finished.</br>  <br>ahh yeah I remember that. Remember when the old discussion that used to be had on /a/? I think people are mostly upset because they miss kaneki   and want to do sexual things with him  .</br>  <br> I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. <br>We already talked about this. Ishida is creating false hyped but then everything return to be shitty SoL.<br> Chapter 30, it seemed that Kaneki was going to return. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> In said chapter it looked as if both of them were going to merge. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> Christmas chapter: look it's the Last Supper symbolism. Lol, more SoL in the next chapters. <br> Fungus symbolism. More SoL. <br> Haisebitch is going to talk with Uta. Lol those are tattoos and nothing more. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they miss kaneki <br>Because Haise is that shitty. I want a good MC.</br></br>  <br>Thats not what i meant.<br>The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG.<br>And the TG Threads were full of gay shit .</br></br></br>  <br>With all this false hope I feel like he's building shit up for something. It's like he's doing this shit on purpose. He knows people want Kaneki, but then why is he holding him back?</br>  <br> The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG <br>The only arc that bored me at this level was Hinami's mother's arc, but that was in the early 10-17 chapters, in :re we are in the 30-40 chapters and still that boring feeling is present.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128550737 <br> Since when were you under the impression that you weren't just projecting your newfaggotry? <br>Since I know you, nigga. At least use another pics.</br></br>  What do you think is in the rest of the envelopes that little mouse delivered to homo prince through the faggot butler?  <br>Fujobait, that's what is inside.</br>  <br>Ishida always delivered, so stop your bitching and wait.</br>  <br>My kind of envelops</br>  Tbh I think this whole Haise thing is just to make an even more insane Kaneki.

There was only one thread I've been as far as I remember early around 1X where there was only 2 shitposts by the end of the ride so I'm not around here often minus for spoiler pics. Let's face it, these threads wouldn't get past 500 posts anymore and they'll be empty before the start of Monday</br>  <br> Ishida always delivered <br>I'm waiting since Re started, nigga.</br></br>  <br>  Conflict choosing between his ghoul bonds and his ccg bonds <br>  New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br>  Potential to hurt someone he cares about from previous life due to his amnesia <br>It's already here, he's researching Kaneki, shironeki is his unconsciousness reminding him how ignorant he really is and after meeting Nishiki is he considering to tread his path carefully by capturing Hinami instead of telling her to fuck off.<br>What's more interesting is what Autismo thinks of Haise now that one of his squad members is cooperating with his team while keeping a eye on him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I really don't want white haired Kaneki back since he's too edgy. However I want combination of Kaneki and Haise together.</br>  <br>yeah but he can just look at a females hand</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Shironeki has not killed a single human.</br>  <br>there is no point to another merger, literally at the end of TG black haired Kaneki and white haired Kaneki merged. what the fuck would be the point in merging now just give Kaneki back his body and piss off.</br>  <br><br>Have faith in Ishida. We all know it's coming</br></br>  So you know how kaneki gets a new split personallity when he eats someone ( well not just anyone it seems the victim needs to have left an impact on Kaneki). Haise is probably based off of Hide. Do you think any new personalities will be added into the pot? I mean if kaneki ate shu and started saying "fortissimo" it'd be pretty sick.<br><br>Shironeki was so badass, he just needed to make better choices.<br><br>If Batamon hadn't gotten picked up for experiments he would have. I guess Hide hadn't been confirmed yet, so too early to call it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly I really don't want <br>Honestly I don't care about your opinion.</br></br>  Haise wont suffer r-right?  What are we all expecting will happen in this issue?  <br><br>He already has, anon</br></br>  <br>Q masks.</br>  <br>And Haise's hair is even darkly colored at the roots like Hide's</br>  <br><br>Tsukiyama bursts into :re</br></br>  <br>I could see that going horribly wrong with the other investigators, it's going to cause a rift between the Q's and the rest of ccg. I mean masks are the symbols of ghouls.</br>  <br>Nothing.  Maybe starting operation for masked Qs by the end of the chapter. </br>  People complain about the pacing but compared to One Piece the pacing is faster and the payoff is just as good.  <br>They need to infiltrate or whatever. The only rift I see happening is if Haise puts on his old mask.</br>  <br> I'm waiting since Re started, nigga. <br>kek do you even read the Manga?<br>There are many things he alredy delivered.<br><br>Again think back to TG , what had he delivered until CH40 ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Homo prince.<br><br>And look what he's back to now.</br></br></br>  <br>Character development and the internal struggle about survival.</br>  <br>To be fair, it's sometimes fast and slow. SoL feel like they go on forever and that last part of the auction felt rushed as fuck.</br>  <br>there have been some good parts, but ishida is simply inflicting kaneki's suffering onto us as we watch beta haise stumble around like a retard</br>  <br>Dang I like his new battle suit</br>  Spoilers in 5 minutes, guys.

I hope this author happy with what he got.</br></br></br></br>  <br>stop reading, just quit the manga</br>  <br> I hope this author happy with what he got. <br><br>I mean yeah he's definitely happy especially with all the money he's raking with Re.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, sure, landshit<br><br><br>Well that's what I meant, he's a hack.</br></br></br></br>  What is Uta saying to Yomo? Tge Qs are at the mask shop?  <br>Ishida is happy. This gayama arc will bring him lots of fujo money.</br>  <br> Ishida is happy <br>I hope he will kill himself.</br></br>  <br>Ishida said he was "happy" with the anime adaptation.<br><br>We all know how he really feels though.</br></br></br>  <br>He was touching his chin when he said that.</br>  Why does the uploader keep erasing dialogue when Haise or Qs is in the shop?<br><br>What the fuck? Stop this, this is like the 3rd time already.</br></br>  <br><br>So I guess you guys never read Penisman</br></br>  I quit reading the manga about 10 chapters into part 2 when it got so bad I just couldn't keep my interest up.<br><br>So is it worth picking up again in which case I can probably rush through the boring chapters at once now?</br></br>  <br>Just fuck off already.</br>  <br>No.<br>Now, fuck off.</br></br>  <br> rush through the boring chapters at once now? <br>Fuck off and never read the manga again.</br></br>  <br>Penisman is the pinnacle of all manga. TG is just some shit Ishida does for shits and giggles.<br><br>The commentary in Penisman is probably the best thing I have ever laid eyes on.</br></br></br>  <br> being this defensive <br>Keep on doing it, faggot. Keep sucking his dick</br></br>  <br> rush through the boring chapters at once now? <br> Rush <br> Speed <br>You're a speedreader faggot. No, fuck off and eat shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewatch the anime. That'll keep you busy while Pierrot serves you their shit on a platter (AKA the inevitable TG :re adaptation)</br>  <br>So, he's a faggot because of that? Good to know.</br>  <br> Keep sucking his dick <br>Jesus christ, it's sad that I can't even count how many times I've read some faggot say then a Tokyo ghoul thread. /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry.</br></br>  <br>Wait until the manga is over, then you can skip all chapters and shitpost about how bad it was.</br>  Oh so it's bitching time again, huh?<br>Ok<br>W-well I fucking hate  , Saiko looks too short<br>Damn Ishida, you're a hack<br>The manga is ruined now<br><br> How am I doing, anons? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry <br>And what are you doing here if you don't like being here? Fuck off jesus.</br></br>  <br>you're gay</br>  We're literally Attack on Titan manga threads now. The only thing missing are the shipperfags posting their homo pairings and an Uta bot.  <br> Oh so it's bitching time again <br>It's not that, it's just that he's really asking for it.</br></br>  <br> what are you doing here <br>Enjoying conservations about manga and anime I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags. not every thread is as bad as Tokyo ghoul threads.</br></br>  <br>don't give them ideas</br>  <br>1/10<br><br>You need to complain about something like Urie's edge, Qs being shit or gayama being gay.</br></br></br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br> I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags <br><br>Well, that's what /a/ is for you and always was, you newshit. <br><br>If you came here only for discussions about anime and shit, then there are other sites for that too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck! it's a fagyama arc! <br> Eto is a queen <br> Shitty haise is such a bitch bring back Kaneki <br> stop sucking Ishida's dick <br> Stop talkng about ishida <br> Just wait until Uta becomes take and kills Arima. <br> Touka a shit. <br>There you go. That's a common tokyo ghoul thread minus that shitposter that pops in to call tokyo Ghoul edgy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what happened to whitehairfags?  <br>And Eto is not the queen?</br>    Emil looking CCG Investigator cuts a guy's tongue off <br>  instead we shitpost, calling Ishida a hack <br><br>What's next guys? Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut and we call him a Hack.</br></br></br>    <br>How about you stop praising him and talk about him.</br>    hack <br><br>Do some illiterate niggers not know how to use this word correctly?</br></br>  <br>Let's just start ignoring the shitposting and actually discuss what we've seen.</br>  <br>But he's literally shit, faggot</br>  <br>Ishida is a tattoo artist.</br>  <br>How so.</br>  <br> Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut <br>We already had something similar with nutcracker cracking balls. What i want to see next is Uta eating some more dick.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit</br>  <br> :^) </br>  <br>Bet your faggot ass wouldn't be saying this if he brings back Kaneki. <br><br>Honestly I wish this series had ended when Kaneki got raped by Arima so I wouldn't have to deal with all this faggotry.</br></br></br>  <br>They hate the series now because it's getting too "gay" for them, but they can't stop reading it because they actually love it. But now they're mad because they've got all this repressed gay inside of themselves and don't know what to do with it. The manga's fine.</br>  <br> literally shit <br>Yeah, illiterate.</br></br>  <br>Hey, guess that's literally in the dictionary.<br> in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually: <br>"I literally died when she walked out on stage in that costume."</br></br></br>  <br>Do they not remember that the prequel had gayness as well? Do they not know that Ishida was the creator of Penisman which was gay? It's like they forgot the series itself had gay elements. I guess sucking on Kaneki's centipede made them forget.</br>  <br>I'd assume the other Qs, but it doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br> Getting to gay <br>Tokyo Ghoul was just as gay with Kaneki calling Tsukiyama and arima beautiful.</br></br>  <br>There a lot of shit like timeskips up and there, after the auction, even worse than the fucking prequel. It's just few of the examples.<br><br><br>I don't give a shit about kaneki and arima<br><br><br>I see you don't even know the definition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't give a shit about kaneki <br><br>Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't reply to that bait. That was just to retarded of a statement to not be bait.</br>  <br>That was the peak of the manga. :re is a disgrace to Ishida's name.</br>  <br> Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga? <br>Are you fucking kidding me? WHAT THE FUCK? There a lot of reason to read this manga besides fucking kaneki. I hope you all die fucking retards.<br><br><br>Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK <br><br>This would be so much funnier if he crashed into the CCG like that. Even better if Arima stands right before him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so mad?</br>  <br>He wants Batman to come.</br>  Isn't Suey a girl's name? Is Ishida a girl?  <br> Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it. <br>He isn't my favorite mangaka. I just like his manga. Is this what you faggots think? Who gives a fuck if other people like Ishida? Don't let your autism make you think you have to be a contrarian to look cool.</br></br>  <br>His Editor or assistant confirmed his gender at one point.</br>  <br> ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped. <br>We are not. If OP wasn't a desperate faggot, anons would make threads when we only get some spoilers<br> no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter. <br>Actually, there is a fag who brings us translations from  Tumblr  and we deal with it since Imperial is very shit at doing its work.<br> Then we bitch about IS being slow. <br> we <br>That's just one fucker. At this point I think it's shitposter-kun, he likes whining and spouting nonsensical shit while he bumps the thread. <br>There is no need to be mentally retarded like the shitposter after all; we are just waiting for THScans to deliver new chapters <br> Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter <br>We are like this since the Christmas shit chapter. Also, this is a Tsukiyama arc, we're still in CCG PoV and Ishida is making other CCG investigators (Hirako, Kijima and his slut, Takeomi) more interesting than Haise and his squad, what did you expect? <br>Clowns themselves doing serious shit in Auction is by far the best thing since TG:re serialization started.<br> we bitch about tumblr too <br>If you weren't such a newfriend, you must have known /a/ hates tumblrites. You can go and see any threads on /a/ (except Nurutu, SnK and Magi threads) /a/ likes shitting on Tumblr, Reddit and MAL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, now you asking why I'm mad. Because there are faggots that read this manga only for the MC which is stupid.<br><br><br>You know what. Fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all of the Qs in Uta's shop <br> nobody notices Uta is a ghoul <br> not even Urine <br>Uta just doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uta just doesn't give a fuck. <br><br>He's just that good anon. He makes everyone his bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>They should all be fired.<br>Haise=dumb<br>Quinx=dumb</br></br></br>  I love Arima.  <br>Yep, we Bleach now. Learn to love it.</br>  When is Autisma's OVA airing?  <br>October, I think.</br>  <br>It's okay dude just chill we all got that one series we enjoy but hate the MC</br>  <br>How would they know? I hope you're not talking about his eyes.</br>  <br>Fuck off Hairu.</br>  <br>Because he doesn't turn his kakugan off. Seriously, Urie sense of smell is that good and he can't even regconize the ghoul smell?!</br>  <br> Hairu </br>  <br><br>I like your positivity.<br><br>Here's some positive questions for you guys <br><br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br> When did you start liking them? <br> Ghouls or humans? <br> Favorite arc? <br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never knew FAS was so attractive</br>  What happen in this chapter<br> Tsukiyama sees Haise and tries to see him on wheelchair. He trips obviously. <br> Kanae prepares him to see Haise at the CCG but then Tsukiyama falls. Haise and Saiko help him up ln his feet. The ghoul household leaves to advoid further dangerous investigators. <br> Haise takes his team to Uta's shop. Saiko seems to be interested in Uta. Haise has a new mask. <br> Kijima tortures Yuma and decides to send a tongue to Roze ghouls. <br> Chapter ends with Uta saying to Yomo: I became friend with Sasaki-kun. <br><br><br>Who cares, stop diluting this thread and discuss the chapter. You are acting like a swab meeting which is disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is something fun. I'll bite.<br><br> Kaneki Ken, he was and still is the most interesting characters in the series so far.  <br> Around the point when he asked touka to teach him how to fight. <br> Ghouls <br> Aunteiku raid <br> Ukaku, aesthetically pleasing to have wing like kagune and strong long range with the ability to fight up close is nice. <br> Yes <br> Hinami, she's cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br>Banjou because he's Banjou<br> When did you start liking them? <br>When he became Banjou<br> Ghouls or humans? <br>Banjou<br> Favorite arc? <br>Banjou arc<br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br>Banjou's kagune because it's the best kagune<br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br>Only if it's a Banjou kakuja<br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? <br>Banjou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look at all the Tokyo ghoul color pages/volume all the ghouls kakugans are red iris with white sclera while Uta's is red iris with black sclera. All Uta would have to do is turn them off and his eyes will still be black. Like he said he's tattoos his eyes.</br>  According to Makyun, there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat.  <br>Banjou in re when?</br>  <br>Could Banjou's Kagune heal others or just himself?</br>  <br> there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat <br><br>Arima being best dad.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up.</br>    <br>Translation? This is getting pretty interesting.</br>  <br>Haise basically says "Umm, Are You Ok?" and Saiko say "crazy suit"</br>  <br>Ah, was hoping the speech bubble belonged to Tsukiyama.</br>  <br>I think it's safe to say the under weight man who just tried to run from his wheelchair and fell onto the floor isn't okay Haise you dense fuck</br>  Tsukiyama looks like Torso now.<br><br>Ui doesn't like Haise and thinks he's dangerous? That's new.</br></br>  <br>It seems as if Haise and Arima are fighting eachother, I'm hoping, or they're just fighting together in the flashback.</br>  <br>I'll take that L but Ishida is being inconsistent and confusing then. Majorities of of the color pages the kakugans it red/white but the the pic you show me and I think a other one with one of the ghoul twins is red/black, which the fuck is it then.</br>  <br><br>No, there are six envelopes there. The numbers for 2 and 6 are obscured though.</br></br>  <br>I said that, 4 Qs and Sasaki makes 5, not 6.</br>  <br>That's what anon said, he said that he thought it was the Qs until he realised that Haise + Qs doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br>Didn't the first go to Shu anyway? So it would be Shu, Qs, Haise to make 6 right.</br>  <br>i highly disagree anon</br>  does faglord-san remember who he is by now or will I have to wait for more chapters?  <br>He still doesn't remember.</br>  <br>Don't blame him, he's making a fortune with his manga. He's always happy with his fujobucks<br><br><br>Saicow is 143cm. She's a small pig<br><br><br> Uta bot <br>That is shitposter-kunt, he uses Clowns images to shitpost. It's sad, there are some anons who liked Uta and his gang but that shiteater had to ruin everything<br><br><br> if he brings back Kaneki <br>Who cares? I mean, people seem to want to know more about secondary characters than MC-kun's "family" Anyway I agree with you, I'd have wished TG to finish when Kaneki was killed by Gary Stu-san, since there were many hints about Amon being alive and Suzuya wasn't an insufferable character anymore; I could see them being MCs in Ghoul and CCG sides<br><br><br><br>Wow, I know Haise, Sharkteeth, Saiko and Trap are dumbasses as fuck but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot. He probably got hit so hard when he was benching. Poor Urine<br><br><br>Nice blog dipshit. Welp you can go back and make a topic in Myanimelist, I bet many ussers will like it!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He remembers, but he's trying to repress those memories since he wants to continue living as Haise.</br>  <br> Taking cherrypicking to a whole new level <br>You make Baito-sama proud.</br></br>  <br><br>Ui and Haise discuss a certain plan that Haise has in mind. Haise plans on investigating by infiltrating while wearing masks. However, it seems that Haise didn’t get a favorable response.<br><br>Haise: …Understood. Please excuse me.<br><br>Haise leaves.<br><br>Fura: Sounded like a good idea to me.<br><br>Ui starts smoking a cigarette.<br><br>Ui: A mask operation… by an ally of justice… It’s a bad image right?<br>Fura: An ally of justice huh… Give me one.<br>Ui: …Your wife will scold you, First Class Fura. Your kid is still young, right?<br>Fura: That’s why I’m smoking here right? Aren’t you just upset that Sasaki’s making achievements?<br><br>Ui: …<br>Ui: He’s… dangerous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol Saiko</br>  <br>Edgeboy please contain yourself</br>   Tsukiyama back in action <br> Not 2nd best boy Amon <br><br>God damn it, Amon would have been two times better to see interact with Haise. Fucking Tsukiyama being more popular.</br></br></br>   <br>Dang Ui, why so jelly?</br>  <br> he's too edgy <br><br>People who don't even know what edgy means don't get to be taken seriously when they use it.</br></br></br>  <br>To give shit about Haise</br>  So how long will this fujo arc last  <br>another ten chapters at the most, I guess.</br>  <br> they can't stop reading it because they actually love it <br>I'm still reading because I refuse to accept this manga is going to kept being this shitty. I hope the old Ishida returns and fix this.</br></br>  <br> According to Makyun <br>Since when does that bitch is allowed here?</br></br>  <br>It's goddamn common courtesy.</br>  <br> but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot <br>I'm too close to just put on hold this manga. I can't stand Haise nor the Qshit.

Must be a lot more popular than I thought he was.  <br>Fuckin' kekked hard. Thanks Anon.</br>  <br>Is this by the same guy who made that Madmax fanart in Odas style?</br>  <br>It been a whole night since Big Mom confronted them. Likely they already dealt with her. Nami probably showed her the card she got from Lola and now they are cool.</br>  <br>Well, what does it mean?</br>  <br>He's pretty cool, at least according to the target demographic. He's got fire, which is edgy but not 'Cold Steele the Hedgehog' edgy. He has an interesting character design, he's Luffys brother, and a badass with the revolutionary army. It's only natural for him to be popular.</br>  <br> Not that anon, but Zoro did not suffer any severe damage to his head <br>Baseless assumption. Literally nothing suggests that the damage Kuma gave him was limited to his body minus his head. Also Usopp took more damage to the head than Sabo did.</br></br>  <br>Looks like Fairy Tail.</br>  <br> trolls getting more and more desperate <br>No wonder why most of /a/ defend One Piece.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't seem like the type to forgive transgressions so easily.</br>  <br>But did Usopp also drown?</br>  What's with all these Sabo hate thread lately??  friendly reminder that he's the current 7th shichibukai member right now  <br> still trying <br>Don't be such a sore loser and stop embarrassing yourself any further.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. Maybe not. Luffy would have no idea unless Sanji calls back, which hasn't happened yet. As far as Luffy is concerned, half his crew is fighting the fight of their lives.</br>  <br>They are made by a single autist who is trying to start some epic new meme but gets BTFO'd constantly. Funny at first but now it got quite boring tbh</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>It's literally one person. He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait.</br>  I think the real question on everybody's mind is, how would Law or Kidd have gone against Lucci pre-timeskip? Their fruits are better, but could they have kept up with Lucci's speed and power and not simply gotten speed blitzed?  <br>Some troll who hates One Piece and trying to make it bad despite it still being coherent. I bet he is a Narutard butthurt that Tobi being Obito having survived his apparent death during a flashback without foreshadowing and it doesn't make sense he joined Madara as a villain.</br>  <br> Baseless assumption <br>Not really. Zoro only felt the pain  of Sabos and Isshos victory  and did not receive any direct hits to his head, body or anything else.</br></br>  <br><br>just wow<br><br><br><br>this is literally my first thread about this. Why are you so autistic about people not liking your favorite character?<br><br> He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait. <br>Of course, also I'm Rebeccafag, every single tripfag, all the Fujos and the Trapfag. There is literally only me and you in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, 12 year old Sabo was just the weakest little shit. What a pleb. At least he didn't die from a mere gun shot wound like Corazon and Bellemere amirite? Kek weaklings.<br><br> Is that seriously your gripe with this shit? Can we move on now? </br></br></br>  <br>sure son, sure</br>  <br>His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged.<br><br><br>fuck off you narutofaggot<br><br><br><br>retards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks gay as fuck</br>  <br> His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged. <br>Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head and also can cause amnesia? You are a retard and you post like a 12 year old. Stop.</br></br>  I made Vergo a strawhat  <br> Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head <br>YES, you fucking idiot. Just compare how Zoro looked when he told Kuma to give him teh damage and how he looked when Sanji found him.</br></br>  <br>Sabo was a child</br>  <br>No, you stop you fucking child. Stop replying to obvious bait, for fuck's sake. Just. Stop. It is Not that hard. Just don't fucking reply. How fucking hard is that ?</br>  <br> YES, you fucking idiot <br>Then you really are a retard whithout a shred of medical knowledge. As I said, just stop.</br></br>  <br>Law is likely to be the first openly gay man in One Piece. No hetro man dress or have tats like that.</br>  <br>Fucking. Is this the birth of Sabofag? <br><br> An obsession with a particular character <br> Same bulk reply style <br> Rebeccafag at least puts effort into his shitposts. Doesn't matter, still the same.  <br>Literal Rebeccafag 2.0 ! This is almost like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  STOP REPLYING TO HIM YOU AUTISTIC CUNTS. DEVELOP YOUR FUCKING 12 YEAR OLD BRAINS AND STOP GIVING HIM ATTENTION.  Lets take a short break from shitposting and baiting and discuss why Sadi-chan makes my dick so hard  <br>kill yourself<br><br><br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>Look at all the threads before this one you faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at all the threads I made before this one you faggot  <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>That's beautiful. C-can I request a Croc version of this?</br>  <br> implying Domino isn't best Impel girl </br>  <br>Zorofag are delusional</br>  <br>Cause she's hot as fuck. Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter. Same with Fem-Killer. Also, her VA in the anime id pretty good too.</br>  <br> being this insecure <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Thanks. D-do you have a Croc pic you'd like me to use?</br>  <br>Don't drag our good name to the ground because of one guy.</br>  <br> kill yourself xd <br>you sound like a parrot</br></br>  <br>Do i see pepperonis in that picture?</br>  <br>and you seem to be a faggot, so what's the point? Discuss op or fuck off.</br>  <br>CHECKED</br>  <br>H-how about this one?</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br> Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter <br>hmmm, but seeing her eyes is not that bad either</br></br>  <br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>I'm actually suggesting the complete opposite, Sabofag. I'm suggesting that you have a raging homolust for this character <br><br>There are also a lot of faggots that hate Rebecca too. But none are as obsessed with each respective character as you and Rebeccafag are. You can't move on even if he's given a plausible, coherent backstory that leaves no plotholes, a touching reunion with his brother, in an arc that best fits his amnesia theme. You're upset because he wasn't treated with the utmost perfect care and wasn't given the most mindblowing backstory in all of one piece. If you feel this offended about a kid getting amnesia after getting hit by a fucking canon, admit it, you are literally obsessed with his character.</br></br></br></br>  <br> openly gay <br>I wish. He's definitely gay though. Everyone in the OP threads seems to agree, even the non-fujos. That's saying something.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. <br><br>Give me 30 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>typical fujoshit delusion</br></br>  <br> expressing your opinion about a character means you're obsessed with him <br>0/10<br>I like the actual strawhats minus Brook and Chopper, does that mean, I'm obsessed with Brook and Chopper?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he is.<br><br>He partied on PH even though they know Doffy was coming.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. Jesus christ dude. Luffy had his entire crew there. And Smoker, who Luffy thinks is strong. And Law. And the G5. And they had Caesar. Their crew wasn't fucking halved and they weren't fighting a goddamn Yonko.</br>  <br>Okay, everyone besides you. Happy now?</br>  Law is obviously bisexual you fucking faggots.  <br>Can't think of any females that piqued Law's interests.</br>  Currently rereading Drum and man is Chopper's design great there. He looks like a moomin and that is cute as fuck.<br><br>Not cute in the "marketable to jap girl kawaiiii~ :3 xD" kind of way, but just plain old fashioned cute.</br></br>  Threadly reminder  I like Sabo because  when I was 14 I made up an OC crew whose captain used a pipe as a weapon and I fucking loved those godawful little abominations. Since he also fights with a pipe, he reminds me of them in a good way, even if that means he's fanfiction-tier.   <br>2/10</br>  <br> What is Bon Clay? </br>  <br>He was obviously trying to flirt with tashigi, but didn't know how to do it, so he copied Doffy hoping to get that glasses pussy.</br>  <br>That is perhaps the most autistic thing I've read this week.<br>Congrats.</br></br>   Rushed OP because I didn't like it <br> The reason I don't like it might be because I rushed it <br> Have to go back and reread it all just because I might actually like it <br> mfw: Have to reread a series I don't even like. <br><br>Fuck I wished I could just be into OP like the rest of you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because I don't see you making a shitty thread about Zoro's lesser-tier backstory and his reasoning to risk everything to become the strongest swordsman in the first place.<br><br>Obviously, for some reason, Sabo's objectively more tragic backstory offends you more than this. You make a whole thread about the mistreatment of his character and reply offensively to anyone that tells you "hey man, it's actually not that bad". Cause they don't know shit right? They don't understand how fucking tragic it is that Sabo of all people got stuck with the cliche amnesia shtick !<br><br>C'mon, you're obsessed. It's fine, you're not alone. I'm sure he's got a lot of raging boners pointing his way judging by the character popularity polls, and the past three Sabo threads all dedicated to him and the mistreatment of his character. But you chose to make another one for god knows why. Most likely because you just can't get enough of talking about Sabo all day and night.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls just can't get into shounen.</br>  <br>Don't force yourself to read something if you don't like it.<br>It'll only make you hate it.</br></br>  <br>Kek, you're delusional. I only headcanon about three characters in the whole OP universe as gay, and Law's one of them. He's gay as fuck.</br>  <br>Why not just, not be into it? It's not for everyone. If you tried it once, and you didn't like it that's fine. You shouldn't force yourself to like stuff just because you want to follow the mass.</br>  <br>Trannies don't count.</br>   caring about sexuality in a manga that does not have any romance <br>Why do people do this?</br>  <br>The first thing I loved about One Piece where the jokes. How it started with Luffy calling Colby a bastard, and saying he hated him. Luffy knocking Zoro off the boat got me everytime.</br>  <br>Bon Clay is 10x manlier then you could ever hope to be</br>  <br><br>Or I should've said I don't see you making threads about Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats. But whatever, still holds that you're obsessed with Sabo more than them.</br></br>  <br>Out of curiosity who are the other two?</br>  <br> Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats <br>We had enough of this after the timeskip. Sabo is an actual *new* case of cancer.</br></br>  I thought that was a good chance BB would kill him before he ever got to do anything cool, same for his crew.<br>If Kidd and friends are after him there should be better odds the red hair pirates will cut loose at some point.</br>  <br>Sanji and Zeff.</br>   One person got anaconda from his bread miseries <br>No shit nigger otherwise every Two Thing peoles would has anaconda</br>  <br>reminder of what?</br>  <br>no anon, YOU are the cancer</br>  <br>I sure as hell hope so, because I'm a girl.<br><br>Croc and Marco.</br></br></br>  <br>Btw is it doctor thing to change from a brimmed hat to that cap thing like a level up or was just to make them marketable kawaii?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Just another day in a One Piece thread....<br><br><br>The way I see it Shanks will take the Kidd alliance as his underlings after he beats them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this defensive <br>Just accept that your favorite character is shit</br></br>    <br>Is Croc gay because he used to be a chick or is he just straight up gay?</br>  <br><br>He still has the brimmed hat.</br></br>  <br>i hate sabo because he made koala cry<br><br>fucking son of a bitch, he's probably going to get himself killed later and maker her cry more<br><br>fucking cunt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it is you who is insecure since you have a minority opinion</br>  <br>Half his face looks like Mihawk here.</br>  <br>Croc ain't gay he put all his teams in manxwoman pairings</br>  <br>He does? Don't remember him wearing one after the TS.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you trying to follow something that you clearly don't like ? Just read something else.</br>  <br> minority opinion <br>yeah no<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128443<wbr>784/#128443784<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128515<wbr>053/#128515053<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128521<wbr>458/#128521458<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128537<wbr>285/#128537285<br><br>And this came out of the first page, I didn't bother to search on. Look through the threads retard.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying luffy would party without his nakama </br></br>  <br>Chopper is still wearing his red hat, its just wrapped in that blue thing</br>  <br>Finally, someone understands. Why the fuck do people think Luffy cares about Partying more than half his crew ?</br>  <br>Kushina also died falling down stairs<br><br>Are you going to say everyone's damage output is the same, especially when they were kids?</br></br></br>  <br>they are  brothers </br>  <br> threads on /a/ are representative  <br>are you literally 12?</br></br>  <br><br>It's under the cap - the manga shows it better than the anime really.</br></br>  <br>Oh shiiieeet it does seem like that. The fuck is the point of that blue thing? To change style cause he can't take his hat off?</br>  <br> he thinks Kushina is dead </br>  <br> Look through the threads retard. <br>I suggest that is something you should do because there are lots of differing opinions in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Well then he is manlier than the manliest character you can think of.<br>Bon Clay was alpha as fuck. He is the Freddy Mercury of OP.</br></br>  <br>Its confirmed hat glassesfag isn't her</br>  <br>They literally are for /a/'s taste. That's it. I'm not discussing with you if Sabo is a popular character, because the poll proved he is. That's not what we are speaking about you retard. <br><br><br>Yeah, but mostly either shitted on Sabo or called him good while shitting on amnesia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the people complaining about Chopper MOST vocally were Chopperfags being upset about what Oda did to one of their favorite characters, which makes sense<br><br>Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br><br>And I don't remember it being this bad with Chopper back then. Three threads in a row about the same shit? You guys just can't get enough, geez.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By whom? Maybe she had amnesia?</br>  <br>Where does that Croc used to be a chick theory come from?</br>  <br> what is wano </br>  <br> They literally are for /a/'s taste. <br> /a/'s taste <br> /a/ is one person <br>yes, you are 12. now lets move on</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're still here.<br><br>Here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he was born a straight chick. <br><br>He was trying to make himself look less suspicious, of course.<br><br>I'm glad Law decided to get himself a new hat, the first one was ugly as sin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ivankov knows a secret about him, ivankov can change the gender of people</br>  <br>Simply magnificent.</br>  <br> Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br> someone shits on a character <br> n-no I know you secretly love him!! <br>Are you retarded? Do you suggest that Chopper and Sabo have the same value?<br><br><br>Nope you are retarded. I of course meant the opinion of the most anons on /a/ and you know that. Don't try to change the subject now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what if the lil nigga had amnesia. There isnt some magic amnesia meter like "You must take this much damage to have amnesia"<br><br>Besides Sabo's head got rekt. Zoro doesnt even have scars from TB.</br></br>  When will Sabofag and Rebeccafag get together and have sex. They can make an army of shitposters to finally get rid of OP threads on /a/ once and for all.  <br><br>Ivankov knows his 'secret' - a 'secret' Croc was desperate not to let anyone know that he changed his mind and helped Luffy.<br><br>Ivankov also happens to be able to change the gender of people with his DF.</br></br></br></br>  Volume 16 got translated.<br><br> It was aliens all along! </br></br>  <br>this is getting more weird every chapter</br>    <br> ALIENS!? </br>  god I love this manga  Absolutely spooky.  <br>All fuckin right, now that was good.</br>  fuck aliens  <br>I call bait on that spoiler</br>  Hideooooooo! Useless piece of shit.  <br>Not much he could have done.</br>  The last few chapters of this volume is just wow.  <br>Dat Italian clock tower twist, I was euphoric.</br>  I just hope we don't have to wait so long for the next volume  Reminder there are zombies in this thread RIGHT NOW  I wish I was brave enough to read this didn't get past the 1st few chapters when the girl got zombied  <br>You must persevere. It's so rich and fulfilling.</br>  <br>Zombies in this thread? are you high?<br><br>That's just impossible.<br><br>Besides, it's not time to eat yet.</br></br></br></br></br>   Oda-sans last words were "YOUR COCK IS SO GOOD" <br><br>This fucking manga I swear.</br></br>  I don't know what the hell is going on anymore.<br><br>It reminds me of Gantz when it went to massive shit.</br></br>  Where can i read it???  <br>Batoto.</br>  Thanks for reminding me, OP.<br>Next volume never.</br>  WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING ANYMORE  <br>awww shit, it's finally happening, best birthday ever</br>  <br>we bokurano now</br>  <br>I thought the same thing. It's not</br>  <br>is this guy a kurusu too? <br>when will there be a female one?</br></br>  <br>We don't know that. It is very likely, but that information came from a hallucinating zombie.<br>So yeah.</br></br>  <br> It was aliens all along! <br>That's not true tho.</br></br>  <br> reading manga online <br><br> helping someone read manga online <br>You both should know better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Conchita Wurst saves the day once again!</br>  <br>This manga desperately needs someone who played Cataclysm.</br>  <br>The fact that it got as much time as it did at the end of the volume I think lend it credibility. Surely you don't waste that much time if it isn't true.</br>  <br>Yeah, If they were in a hivemind then why were the other zombies confused as to what he was talking about if it wasn't just the usual delusions they spew out?</br>  <br> new release <br> not reading it online <br><br>Unless you go to shit sites the quality is exactly the same and unless you have shit internet, it loads instantly.<br><br>I only download series if I'm binging them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it reminded me of gantz the way they're in Italy.. although I can't see this turning to shit like gantz did</br>  <br>Yeah he was blonde with short hair before. The main girl is a kurusu.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for the reveal that the USA is responsible for everything</br>  <br> Yeah he was blonde with short hair before.  <br>Wait, am i missing something?</br></br>  <br>He explained it, they were chosen as the caretakers. Somewhat disconnected from the hivemind.</br>  <br>Much earlier chapter. We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128527222 <br>Says you. Aliens in only a theory but regardless, it's all done extremely well. This manga just has masterful pacing.</br>  I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there.  <br> We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which. <br>I'm pretty sure that blonde guy was walking around paris, then that zombie centipede thing crushed the church he was in.</br></br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCCCCKKK WHHYYYYYY<br>;____;</br>  <br> not binging IAAH from the start every new release </br>  <br> that spoiler  <br><br>No one uses spoilers correctly anymore, I hope you are one of those people.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll guess with confidence this is the same guy.</br>  we need ultraman  <br> I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there. <br>the next volume is even more hilarious with some NEET black ops™ having a full-on UFC brawl with a single zombie</br></br>  <br> you'll never become a symbiotic flesh structure with your fellow countrymen </br>  <br> mangafox </br>  aww she saved the little girl  I thought it was girl the entire time he was sitting down  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>Did they even know he was there? They didn't acknowledge him or his want for paninis at all.</br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>   so jason gordon levitt is a zombie made by aliens, who kidnaps little girls so that his alien masters can fill her up with babies? <br> just like real life </br>  <br>why do all the attractive people turn into such well-spoken, knowledgable zombies?</br>  <br> At first I though he was a pedophile. </br>  <br><br>He reminded of the somewhat reasonable guy from when they were at that mall who turned into a zombie and jerked his dick off.</br></br>  <br>I forgot about that. Holy fuck that guy was amazing.</br>  God damn, I cannot handle how spooky this manga is at every turn.  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>I'm actually rereading the chapter he was in and a lot of stuff this italian guy connects to what he was saying.</br>  Is Hiromi a Kurusu?  <br>Yes. She turned and came back from it.</br>  <br>Read it, anon. The first few chapters are boring as fuck but it gets better.</br>  <br><br>Whelp I guessed wrong. That guy I was thinking of was in Belgium. He looked very similar in facial design. The Belgium guy was also implied to be a kurusu so I immediately jumped to conclusion.</br></br>  <br>Hiromi a bitch<br><br>R.I.P. best girl</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't the aliens just release a virus that kills with 100% certainity and spreads very fast?</br>  <br>who here things ayy lmaos really did it?<br><br><br>probably because of the hivemind birthing alien hybrids bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could work. They can't be beep boop type aliens though. Have to be something more like the gauna from Sidonia.</br>  <br>becoming part of this freaks me out less than becoming a zombie<br>like being torn to pieces and having my flesh eaten is more scary than being absorbed</br></br>  I was hoping the story would keep jumping to a different place after Itality, and we've already seen Belgium a tiny bit and also China but everything else has been Japan and it seems Vol.17 is gonna go with a new group in Japan. Would be cool to get other place and a little longer, but I seem to be the only one that doesn't care for Hideo and the main girl all that much.   volume starts <br> Oda gets bitten right away <br> not even on a cliffhanger of the last volume or this volume <br> they throw her in the trash compacter and leave her there <br>I'm sorry but what? I can't even feel anything from this</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know my friend, i felt that pain too. I fucking hate when they cut their hair.</br>  I swear this fucking manga man  <br>I actually really like Hideo because he's just an average joe that got fucking lucky because he owns a rifle. If he gets some sort of super power I'll be fucking pissed. Hiromi is whatever, don't care about her, Oda was a better character.<br><br>But it would still be nice if we got some other locations and sub plots in their, that tie into the main story. <br>The whole 2chan thing was pretty great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he's your average joe tho, more like your average 2chan user or something, he's really weird and annoying at times imo.</br>  What the fuck is even going on in this manga anymore?<br>Does at least the mangaka know where this is headed? <br>Why not just roll over and die, it's not like humanity can reasonably survive any of this, let alone defeat it.<br>Things will only get stranger moving forward</br></br></br>  <br>It's headed toward romcom</br>  At this point the manga has become better than Gantz with it's alien gimmick  <br>At first I thought those things would start fighting to the death</br>   post yfw they were infected all along   <br>They were not infected all along, I think the only got infected when the gigantic thing got to them in the tower, thats why they weren't able to understand each other up to that point.</br>  <br>It's had plenty of these cutesy moments already. Nothing new.</br>  <br>This. Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden</br>  <br>8 chapters of them mentally preparing themselves for sex is not a 'moment'</br>  <br>Try a little harder to get that feel. It's more impacting because of how abrupt it was. When Hiromi beckons that Oda could wind up as a kurusu like her was a heartbreaker. It was such a desperate attempt and for oda to just keep on changing into one right after this shred of hope was dangled in front of us. Oh yeah, it's got feels.</br>  <br> 8 chapters <br><br>This is normal pacing.</br></br></br>  <br>I am with you anon. I will miss Oda-san.</br>    <br><br><br>UNINSTALL</br></br></br>  Can some kind anon post magent link please, my isp block all usual places, and i don't have animebytes account  <br> entire page for taking somethin off a shelf <br>Looks about right. Have you not read this whole mango? It's got this pacing all over the place.</br></br>    <br>dude one of them didn't have flesh on their leg, they were infected for a long long time, they just never realized</br>  <br>yes, the giant tree thing probably just made them aware of themselves</br>    <br><br>What you're saying makes sense but if that's the case, why them? Why did they have to bring to the tower in the first place? Couldn't the alie just pick some other random zombie in the street to take care of her? Because so coincidentally the alien hive would bring the girl to the tower where there is a mutant, which is theorized by the italian guy that mutants are also created by the alien hive, if thats true then they weren't the real care takers and he just made the wrong assumption, and the mutant is the actual care taker? Yeah this makes sense, damn so many questions.</br></br>  How did the girl know to raise her hand? Can the "handler" zombies talk?<br><br>So many questions.</br></br>   lolicon tentacles eggs impregnation aliens rape   <br>god damnit<br><br>i knew i should've been worried when i started to read vol 13 and this shows up</br></br></br>  <br> Oda dies and then she cuts her hair into an imitation of Oda's <br><br>Not sure how I should feel about this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't some of the zombies talk? <br>Or at least form some sentences, how ever Hiromi can understand them, so maybe the girl just has the same ability, there has to be something special about her since none of the zombies in the street attacked her in the first place</br></br>  <br>I want to know what the fuck that thing the loli was holding is. Is it really just a stuffed animal? What if it's actually a legit alien, like the asshole zombie guy jokingly said?</br>  <br>They can all talk, these were still in control without realizing they were zombies. They saw everyone else infected but themeselves and the girl.</br>  THERE'S A HUGE CHUNK MISSING ON BATOTO AND I WANNA CATCH UP NOW WHERE DO I FIND IT  <br>Only those that were given some humanity a top the tower, possibly to lure the girl uo there, most can't. They can form some weird sentences but that's just random babbling. The little girl is not the same as the Kurusus or whatever with long black hair and always in semi naked.</br>  <br>google</br>  Volume 17 and 18 when?<br>please tell me they at least work on the translations and don't wait another 6 months</br>  <br>Isn't the highschooler who likes the MC a mutant?</br>  <br> Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden <br>Because all of them are like that, but these guys could actually talk and is offering to help</br></br>  HAPPENING  WHEN WILL THEY FINISH TRANSLATING BOYS ON THE RUN. <br><br>I'm suffering.</br></br>  <br>Presumably, yeah. She hasn't started walking around in her underwear, though.<br><br>She might be special, though, seeing as how she was able to communicate with zombies even before infection. Maybe she was supposed to be a queen like the little girl, but got infected by accident (The hivemind might not be able to control baby zombies all that well? Or it could be because the hivemind wasn't established strongly enough yet).</br></br></br>  <br>That's a decent theory, I just hope she doesn't get pregnant and somehow the baby being part Hideo or some shit would make him different from the other alien babies and become a the key to save the earth or whatever nonsense. Hope I'm wrong.</br>  <br>The point of the Queen zombie is to make a hybrid, it's easier to make a hybrid if Hiromi is already infected and gets preggo from Hideo.</br>  <br>A hybrid with the aliens, anon. A human-alien hybrid. I'm assuming the hive and the zombie guardians are supposed to keep the Queen safe after she's been impregnated by the aliens.</br>  <br>Yes but we're talking about the possibility of Hiromi being a hybrid and in that case she'd be infect already so what  says its true. But still I just hope she doesn't get pregant and that entire plot point is never explored.</br>  <br>That's assuming that the zombies are the aliens and not just a biological tool the aliens invented to make whatever race that's infected subservient towards them.</br>  i was so angry at this part  <br> Hideo stop trying to cope with Odas death, it's creeping me out, I'm a gril so it's okay for me to act like a demanding bitch. <br> man up, don't be a pussy just because your waifu died <br><br>I liked her before, but that one single scene made me hate her so fucking much, seriously fuck Hiromi</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand her. She doesn't want to see him breaking down in front of her when he should be more reliable "as an adult".</br>  Question, anyone know where to download I Am A Hero on Illumanati's site? Or are they the kind of group that doesn't bother with DL links and just uploads them directly to a manga reading site of their choice?  <br>Never mind, I found it. Although the DL link for vol. 16 doesn't seem to be working properly.</br>  Less NTR, more zombie killing please.  So, how high are the chances of this every getting an anime? (It's better than 99% of the shit that gets an anime adaption)<br><br>Also, I heard they are working on a live action movie of I am a hero, can anyone confirm this?</br></br>  <br>With the detail in environments, characters, and pacing, I highly doubt it. I agree with you though, this is 99% better than all the moeshit out there.</br>  <br>Man, you're not even gonna cut her some slack after she just had to crush the closest thing she had to a female friend in a literal trash compactor?</br>  <br> less NTR <br><br>Not with this mangaka. He's good but still relies a bit too much on contrived NTR/despair bullshit. It's not as bad in I Am A Hero though, definitely feels relevant and not just there for "wow look at the way I kick this character while he's down aren't you sad aren't I such a good writer".</br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're responding to, but that scene in v15 where she points the shotty at Oda really made Hiromi's stock drop for me.</br>  <br> Probably the same amount of chances 7seeds has.<br> none ;_' </br></br>  I was laughing the entire time. They just killed her so quickly.  <br>Fags who can't into IRC. I love Illuminati releases.</br>  <br><br>oh shit <br><br>she was really gonna kill her</br></br></br></br>  why can't we go back to vol 1-2 feels?  <br>We do though</br>    i really liked this part for some reason  <br> feels <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>    Would you Hiromi?  So the zombie that "ate" MC was a combination of the naked emperor, the mask kid, and knife? Why did they save MC?  <br>They didn't save MC, MC saved himself as far as I could tell.</br>  <br>When did this happen? RAWs?</br>  <br><br>WHAT?<br><br> do they do it for real or is it a dream/hallucination? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a guy from Illuminati?</br>  <br>Why they swallowed him then?</br>  <br><br><br>Man you guys are slowpokes. People were spoiling a little while back.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the chink scans.</br>  <br><br>Not all of us browse 24/7 <br><br>if you can just like us to the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anybody want that?</br>  <br><br>Nevermind found it</br></br>  <br>seems more like otakubait</br>  <br>They were eating him and then, maybe, Hideo somehow connected with their hivemind? Then mask kid helped Hideo take control of the body?</br>  <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/126795<wbr>484/#126795765<br><br>if anyone is interested</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Do you approve of aliens?  <br>I don't approve of anything post vol 13</br>  <br>I really do, shit got really interesting, a zombie story that I can actually enjoy, and it's from Japan.<br><br>I was really surprised with the events on volume 13 and 14, but now I'm sold.</br></br></br>  Guys, I'm scared.  What the fuck is going on? Seriously this shit is getting on my nerves. I really like dropping this manga just so i can avoid the tension  <br>As long as it stays an in-universe theory. <br><br>I don't want a final showdown with Hideo and the alien mastermind, like the ending of Spriggan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the hell does this thing look like it should be chanting "WASSHOI"?</br></br>  <br>my fucking sides<br><br><br>Buckle up anon, this ride isn't getting any less rough.</br></br></br></br>  Are the people at the end of the volume new?<br><br>How many viewpoints have we seen so far?<br><br>Hideo's edito who was the zombies.<br>That French guy who was the zombies.<br>The Italians and the tourists who was the zombies. <br>The other band of survivors who went to shit with the Kurusus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh shit, there is even a Berlusconi cameo in the part setted in Italy. Chapeau.<br><br>Also, I think the author may have watched too many cyriak videos on youtube<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WQO<wbr>-aOdJLiw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> good "different" manga. <br> getting an adaptation <br> ever <br>Actually, please no, they would fuck it up to hell and back.</br></br></br></br>  How far do you think the manga has progressed?<br><br>Past the 50% point?</br></br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi does pretty well so far, though of course it has its huge share of moebait, otherwise there would be no adaptation ever.</br>  Jesus Christ  <br>I think so.</br>  <br>Thought the human tree branches were a pretty cool design. If I were ever to become a part of a gigantic flesh amalgamation, that one would be my first pick for sure.</br>  <br>Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.</br>  <br> part is setted in the city that hosts the biggest italian comics and games  <br> coincidences? <br> check <br> author was there 2013 <br> the year I wasn't there <br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Italians play games?<br>We barely see any Italians on the internet or in online games <br>Which is possibly a good thing, fuck Spaniards and French not talking English, we don't need more Latins being cunts on muh internet</br></br></br>  <br>Almost all my friends play a combination of lol/minecraft/hearthstone  filthy casuals .<br>I don't know what you play, but maybe they just don't make a big deal out of being italian.<br>Fuck the faggots that add [FR] or [ITA] or whatever to the name, I don't fucking care where you're from.<br>And fuck League of Legend bloating queues with their useless casual selves.</br></br></br></br>   these fucking aliens <br>They're so polite. And hey! They'll even let 10% of us survive. How nice!</br>  <br>Holy shit, nice catch.</br>  I noticed that all the "mutants" have grow long hair very quickly. Kurusu, The Neet, The fat guy, and Himori all have long hair. <br> When Kurusu killed the Neet's loved one his hair started to rise and then at the end of the arc he became the Kurusu.  <br> Himori also said she grows pubic hair very quickly as well. <br> The Neet became the new Kurusu and grew a mullet.  <br><br>Just a couple of I questions I got to ask is...<br> Is Hideo a mutant or some kinda hybrid. How was he able to see Kurusu when he was swallowed up by that Fat 8-limb Zombie?  <br> Was the 8-limb Zombie a fusion of Kurusu and the Fat dude after they fought? I know The Neet survived afterwards. <br> Is the doll that Italian girl, the "Queen Bee", is holding an alien? The doll looks exactly like Hideo when Hiromi was infected. Maybe not, but all the visions that Hiromi had while she was infected looked like deformed stuffed toys. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, been binging through all of the earlier volumes.<br><br>It's also nice to know that Hiromi's wish (aliens did all this) came true.</br></br></br>  <br>I was gonna post that earlier, but I just binged all the volumes in 6 hours.</br>  <br> Was the 8-limb Zombie a fusion of Kurusu and the Fat dude after they fought? I know The Neet survived afterwards. <br>Maybe. You see the Neet show up in the mental space with the other two too, though. Since the Italian zombie thought that the Italian Kurusu was a defect/purposely created by the aliens, and since the Kurusus can't be controlled by the hivemind, maybe the Kurusus have their own hivemind separated from the rest of the zombies?</br></br>  <br>nice catch, it's been so long, guess I'll have to read through the whole thing again once v17 drops. Probably a lot more callbacks in their that we missed because of the long wait</br>  Sort of of topic but is anyone scanning Boys on the run anymore?  <br>Holy shit. That foreshadowing. <br><br>Fucking aliens, purge them all.</br></br></br>  I still enjoy this manga but I can't help but feel that it's getting too farfetched now. I could've lived without aliens.  <br>wait so hideo will pay for things because he doesnt want to break the law despite it being a zombie apocalypse but he has no problem with banging a teenage girl?</br>  <br>There are some lines you just can't cross, anon.</br>  <br>Having sex with a teenager isn't illegal. But Hideo is pretty fucking weird, if you haven't notice with his delusion created mate.</br>  <br> &gt;Is the doll that Italian girl, the "Queen Bee", is holding an alien? The doll looks exactly like Hideo when Hiromi was infected. <br> Hideo is the same as the little Italian girl. He can be used to procreate with aliens to make hybrid babies. Hiromi is letting him fuck her because she instinctively recognizes this too, since she's infected by the alien virus.  You read it here first, no need to thank me.</br></br>  <br> but I can't help but feel that it's getting too farfetched now.  <br><br>The super saiyan 3 NEETs, weren't stupid enough for you?</br></br></br>  So hey, guys. The guy in chapter 94 is the same editor Hideo met up with in the beginning, right?  <br>interesting</br>  <br>That was ridiculous but I felt like it still fit within the realm of the story just fine, as zombies get stronk. But as things have gotten absurd with giant zombie constructs and aliens, there's less focus on the characters and survival than I would have liked. I mean, at this rate there's not going to be anyone alive for Hideo to interact with.<br>I guess I just have to trust in the mangaka knowing what he's doing.</br></br>  <br>Could be true. In chapter 98, it seems like it was implied he was having a dream of what was going on with his editor in Taiwan.</br>  <br><br>Aliens is just a theory from one guy, don't instantly take it as a fact.</br></br>  <br> Hideo is the same as the little Italian girl. He can be used to procreate with aliens to make hybrid babies. Hiromi is letting him fuck her because she instinctively recognizes this too, since she's infected by the alien virus.  <br><br>Wow, I'd be amazed if this is true. Unless you know the ending already. Did the manga even end yet? I remember the 2chan posts were from 2009.</br></br></br>  Have you bought a Benelli shotgun yet anon?<br><br>Approved by Hideo and Tom Knapp. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z5u<wbr>Ht4AwYb4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>   mfw went to Japan and brought the latest volume <br>Feels good</br>  <br>please drench me in your hot spoilers, anon</br>  <br>It was volume 17 and  I'm only at volume 10 or so, most of the characters were some that I've never seen. I only skimmed trough it and didn't read anything to avoid being completely spoiled.<br><br>Volume focused on people wearing masks and living in a apartment house near highway. Hideo was not in spotlight. We get some more strange as fuck zombies, person that suddenly grows another one out of its back once been decapitated.<br><br>There didn't seem to be deaths and most of the volume was people just sitting in the apartment.<br><br>Hideo arrives in the end by bike.<br><br>I have no idea what any of this means but I'm catching up quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>I'd probably bought earlier volumes but this was the only one I managed to find.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how hairy she is</br>  <br> Mind spoiling us on the kinds of zombies there were? The body horror stuff is pretty cool. </br>  Kind of disgusting how hideo goes from killing thta girl to start trying to fuck the other girl so fast.  <br>I'd make love to all of the thick, black hair on her body, especially eyebrows.</br>  <br>Nah. I can understand it. When you start staring desperately into the blackness of the night while fearing death, it helps to have a loved one close at hand to help ease yourself off the incoming nausea.</br>  https://bato.to/read/_/334705/boku-<wbr>no-hero-academia_ch52_by_fallen-ang<wbr>els</wbr></wbr>  This translation feels...

I'm trying to teach myself to dial 000 without looking in case I need to.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Okay and why do we care<br><br>I know this is bait but let's be real here<br><br>people who go into threads to say "I HATE THIS HURRR DURRR" are bigger attention whores than some of tumblr <br><br>I don't really care if you don't like, that is up to your taste and if it isn't for you well you can like what you like<br><br>I am not saying don't criticize things but not if you aren't to criticize it but this is far from it, if you want what real criticize look like go on /ic/ as they actually try and don't just shit post</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they keep to their own threads and don't spam threads, only making a thread when there's actually a new chapter being released instead of constantly spamming threads like generals.<br><br>Seriously, why shouldn't they be allowed to talk about the manga series they like as long as they keep it nice and tidy and not shit up the board.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn, Deku is one lucky motherfucker</br></br>  <br>BUT I DON'T LIKE IT BAWWW</br>  Deku chose the perfect back-up as Icyhot can just torch the guy at a distance.  <br>Bakugou would be a perfect target for Stain. Don't miss this chance to have Bakugou beaten up, Horikoshi.</br>  <br> had Deku been a shittier person, he would've called Bakugou instead to get him fucked up and possibly killed by Stain </br>  Stupid sexy Deku, MC are not suposed to be this badass  <br>Why are you all hating on katsuki?</br>  <br>This early too. Just imagine him fucking shit up at 30% power later on.</br>  <br>Whatever he learned from Gran Torino he put it into his work pretty fast.</br>  <br> hating <br>No hating. If I hated him, I'd wish for Stain to kill him. I just want Bakugou confronted for his hero-belief. He's in the hero gig for the no.1 spot, not to help the people.</br></br>  <br>Not to mention he uses his brain, he located Iida then the first thing he does is call for reinforcement.<br><br>If he is like this now how motherfucking badass he will become later.</br></br></br>  <br>He draws them nice and thick</br>  <br>Ochako is doing it for the money so she should get beaten up as well?</br>  <br> Gravity gets hurt, allowing Froppy to comfort Deku and become one true love interest <br>I am willing to make that great sacrifice</br></br>  <br><br>Yes.<br><br><br><br>YES!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.</br>    <br>This one was way better than last week's disaster of a translation.</br>  <br>I am glad that I have a viz sub or I would gone insane of how bad the wording and sentence flow is for FA<br><br>I wish PM still did this series</br></br></br>  <br>cheked</br>  <br>IcyHot is Neji to DekuNaruto. Went from rivals to bros.<br><br>Iida is Sasugay.</br></br></br>  <br><br>With Naruto gone you guys must be desperate to find another scapegoat</br></br>  <br>Narutards jealous that Hero Academy is actually good</br>  Must be nice being this author. Made the manga at the best possible time, getting fans fast, anime is a given, being regarded as the new bleach/naruto is a given. He's set for life.  <br>MHA is undoubtedly better written series compared to Naruto and has a better cast. But I liked world building and power system in Naruto more. You can't really compare, but I personally think magic ninjas are kinda cooler then your old superheroes with boring quirks. MHA is better series overall, of course.</br>  <br>I have a sneaking suspicion his editor chose the right time to get this serialized about the same time as Naruto ended. But still I think BnHA would have held it's own even when Nurudu was still running.</br>  I don't get this. Was Deku cut or not?<br>Is the blood Deku's and Stain has to lick it to activate?</br>  <br>Yes and Yes.</br>  <br>Not as well I don't think. The market was saturated with Naruto, with it ending and bleach going to hell, a big hole needed filling.</br>  <br>That or Deku hurt himself with OfA, and blood splattered on Stain's sword</br>  <br>I like this, or it's just poor translation since it makes it sound like Deku wasn't cut.</br>  Can I vote in the character poll?  <br><br>He got cut, they literally zoom in on his arm in that panel, suggesting that Stain got him obviously when Deku rushed to Stain.</br></br>  <br>He had two failed manga before this</br>  <br>From that page, I'd think Stain can paralyse people when he bleeds or something? It's really unclear, the 4th panel states that Deku wasn't cut and it has something to do with Stains blood being on his knives that's paralysing him.</br>  Damn I'm starting to like Todoroki now, That entrance was pretty fucking baller., I wish Iida would stop being such a BITCH. <br><br><br>I bet Deku or Frog wins anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>The power system of Naruto was just bullshit. Almost Dragonball tier bullshit. But that's not why people don't like Naruto, its Naruto's plot itself.</br>  <br>1.Deku<br>2.Frog<br>3. 'splosion man<br>4. Alien Girl<br>5. Gravity Moe<br>6. Mary Sue the Fire Dude<br>8. Weapon Chick<br>9. Other</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was gonna vote for frog or mindfuck anyways.</br>  <br>Deku got cut, Stain as it turns out is an expert combatant who can easily read Deku's movements at his current level and was able to nick him and also avoid the brunt of his %5 smash.<br><br>This makes sense, I mean those other heroes he took out were professionals even if (in Stain's eyes at least) they were sellout hacks.</br></br></br>  <br>It's bad. It feels a lot like the first few FA translations, where English synonyms were inserted where they really did not belong and bad grammar that, while technically it contains the same information as a proper sentence, is really awkward and strange.</br>  <br>I thought that for a second, but looking at last chapter it's obviously iida's blood he licks.<br><br><br>It was just the<br> no wait that's not it <br>That threw me off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stain probably held back a lot too. He wanted to see what Deku could do and already judged him as a worthy hero. I really love everything about Stain.</br>  <br>I find it interesting that Mina is his favorite girl character right now.  I can't wait for shipping to start once she gets some focus. </br>  <br>This was super goofy.</br>  <br>Mina x tape.</br>  <br>Stain is Zodd and Deku is Guts.</br>  <br>Then who is Griffith?  Will Ochako get mind-broken? </br>  <br>Literally Batman with Superman's strength.</br>  <br>Well, he paid his dues with Oumagadoki Zoo and Sensei no Bulge. Third time's the charm. I'm glad he finally made a breakthrough.<br><br>I'm kinda sad for the Kagamigami dude (who also did Psyren). He never quite managed to make a big hit, even though I really like his art style. Even Psyren was more of a "bottom half" series during its run, that managed to hold on longer than it should, thanks to shit competition.</br></br></br>  <br> Superman's strength </br>   Boku no Meme Academy   <br>Well, he is the "Superman" in training in his universe. Obviously he isn't as strong as Supes.</br>  <br>Shouto?</br>  <br><br>There are many reasons to hate Naruto. One of the biggest was that everything, tone, character personalities, quality, all went down hill with the time skip.</br></br>  <br> Now that I think about it, Bakugou would make a better guts since he is pissed all the time </br>  <br> ridiculous that he could text the exact number he wanted without looking <br><br>I'm not surprised it. I think it really fits with the theory that he's on the autism spectrum, obviously high functioning.</br></br></br>  fallen angels a shit  <br>Nah Deku doesn't have the reason yet.<br>Once Shouto freezes him in ice and makes him watch him have his way with Ochako and burns the rest of class A. The only survivor other than Deku and Ochako being  Grapes .</br></br>  <br>I really wish OfA was more consistent with it's power applications. That 5% doesn't look like All Mights 100%.<br><br>Deku having a "down to the marrow of my bones, I'm a hero" moment would be fucking great. Or a de-powered arc and Deku still kicks shit thanks to All Mights training in the first couple of chapters and character skill.</br></br></br>  <br>Why you hate Iida so much, Lelouch?</br>  <br>Err. That 5% doesn't look like it would become All mights 100% if Deku did 100%*</br>  <br>Of course the 5% wouldn't be as strong as 100%.</br>  <br>They're translations are getting pretty embarrassing...</br>  When are we gettin robot villian ?  <br>Here: <br>http://strawpoll.me/5023876</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I done fucked up. I dunno how I missed that. When I read my post after posting I felt like a damn retard. Deku's 5% doesn't seem like it'd be the same as All Mights' 100% after scaling it up to 100%. Wasn't he only using ~20% or something when he was breaking all those super robos and his hands? I thought 100% would pulp his everything given the way they talked about it in the early chapters.</br>  <br> they're <br>you're embarrassing</br></br>  <br>Looking at those who are dressed to match in this picture, I'd say:<br>Deku/Ochako<br>Mina/Kirishima<br>Tsuyu/Tokoyami</br></br></br></br>  Which one was the best?  <br>Of those pictured, forehead.<br>Of all girls in series, shinobi.</br></br>  Would, from left to right:<br>anal - anal - anal - anal - anal</br>  Where's Hanbei?  best girl reporting  <br>Where is the fuck is the girl ninja?</br>  <br>I wanna fuck fivehead and Imagawa badly.</br>  <br> No Hanbei <br> No Goemon <br> Not even Date <br>Nigga, you're doing it wrong.<br><br>Date is supreme.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Second Season when?</br>  <br>Goemon</br>  <br>in another timeline... where the BluerayDiscs were sold much more and where someone is interessed in continue the serie ... i know it's sad!</br>  <br>It was one of badhouse better selling series this decade.
