[ Seiyuu thread. Who is your favorite seiyuu and why is Hana Kana?  I honestly don't understand her appeal. Is it idolfags?  【Non-virgins】<br> Aya Hirano→ Do I even have to mention this one. <br> Hanazawa Kana→ Picture Related <br> Everbody in the group Sphere→ Discovered by Sphere wota to engage in relationships.(Clear proof for Tomatsu and Toyosaki, not so much for the other two.) <br> Hidaka Rina→ Picture with DQN boyfriend was leaked. <br> Yui Ogura→ Rumors of her being a former girlfriend of Ryota Hasegawa. <br> Ayana Taketatsu→ Pictures of her on a date with Ishida Yuichi were leaked. <br> Minori Chihara→ Wrote a blog post about her going to a Matsuri with a former boyfriend <br> Mizuki Nana→ Confessed to be sexually harassed as a young girl in her autobiography. <br> Eri Kitamura→ Confessed being a "pillow seiyuu". <br> Minami Tsuda→ Discovered to be a non-virgin by NicoNicofags. <br> Yukana→ Pillow Seiyuu <br> Horie Yui→ Pillow Seiyuu <br> Kana Asumi→ One night stand at a party. <br> Saori Hayami→ Lost hers in a University club. <br> Hitomi Harada→ A blog photo showed her having a ring on her ring finger. <br> Emiri Kato→ Same as above. Also went to a date with someone in Disneyland <br> Yuka Iguchi→ Said in Radio that "I had Long become a lady" <br> Mamiko Noto→ Said in Radio "I am not a virgin". Also confessed to masturbate. <br> Kana Ueda→ Said in Radio that her boyfriend was thinking of the names for their kids on its own accord. <br> Yuko Goto→ Something on her own about a long distance relationship that failed. <br> Asami Imai→ Said in Radio "I had a kiss after a long time" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit she looks like a brown haired Hana</br>  <br><br>Do otakus care if the seiyuu are virgins or not? apart from idol-seiyuus.</br></br>  <br>Why do you keep making this thread? I don't understand the point of repeatedly making the same thread over and over.</br>  <br>I dont think so. Didnt Miki's VA from imas get knocked up and nobody cared?</br>  Amamiya Sora did nothing wrong.  What's her crime, /a/?  <br>Continuously wearing pants instead of superior skirts.</br>  <br>Her legs are ugly.</br>  Reminder that everytime you love a "pure" character, their VA already has a knowledge and experience with those of the opposite sex.  <br>Some retarded do. Expecting somebody in their 20s to have no experience whatsoever is just barely above brain-dead-retarded.<br><br><br>Gotta love the conclusions in this one. Also:<br> Mamiko Noto→ confessed to masturbate. <br>Weirdly aroused by this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Bestest.<br>Heh.</br>  <br>Weird neck. 2/10.</br>  She's already 30. She better get a fucking kid soon and pass on those genes.  <br> flat chest <br> almost all her roles are cowtits </br></br>  <br>didn't watch that show. Just how horrible was her performance?</br>  <br>She has the voice that matches the cowtits.</br>  <br>Me neither. And she loks dumb in this picture.</br>  <br>I'm sure all im@s seiyuu have been dating someone and are thinking about marrying once they're further in their 30s. Happened with Miki's seiyuu.<br><br> Except Mingosu, she's not getting married unless she accepts Sugita's proposal. </br></br></br>  Its Mai Nakahara.  <br>I''m sad about Asami Imai. She's already dried up and would pop out a retarded baby.<br><br>Sugita needs to pass on his genes.</br></br></br>  <br> 【Non-virgins】 <br> Mizuki Nana→ Confessed to be sexually harassed as a young girl in her autobiography. <br>Ehh?</br></br></br>  <br> Emiri Kato <br><br>Is this before or after she got dental surgery?<br><br> Mamiko Noto <br><br>I'm going to need a source on that. For research.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mizuki Nana will always be my favorite.<br><br>Its just a faggot saying that molested girls are automatically not virgins even though they aren't really raped.</br></br>  I love Kayanon. <br><br>I'm pretty pissed that Matsuoka Yoshitsugu is probably tapping that daily though.</br></br>  <br>Joji Nakata. His voice turns me on.</br>    <br><br> &gt;Mizuki Nana→ Confessed to be sexually harassed as a young girl in her autobiography. <br><br>I don't think that means she's necessarily not a virgin, although I doubt she or most people in their 20s or higher would be. Unless you mean she got raped.<br><br> &gt;Eri Kitamura→ Confessed being a "pillow seiyuu". <br> &gt;Yukana→ Pillow Seiyuu <br> &gt;Horie Yui→ Pillow Seiyuu <br><br>The fuck does that mean?<br><br> &gt;Saori Hayami→ Lost hers in a University club. <br><br>This turned me on for some reason, not sure why.<br><br> &gt;Mamiko Noto→ Said in Radio "I am not a virgin". Also confessed to masturbate. <br><br>This turned me on but I know exactly why.<br><br> &gt;Asami Imai→ Said in Radio "I had a kiss after a long time" <br><br>Again doesn't mean anything by itself. I'm sure she's gotten lots of sick inside her even though she's not even remotely attractive though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Superior seiyuufu coming through.  <br>I cant tell who this is. All asians look the same.</br>  <br> The fuck does that mean? <br>It means they slept their way to where they are you dumb fuck.</br></br>  <br>i can't wait for Rori's orgasm scenes.<br><br>I hope the anime doesn't decide to downplay or skip</br></br></br>  <br>Get your eyes checked, faggot.</br>  <br>Being shit at voice acting.</br>  What happen to Yukari? Did she kill herself yet?    <br> Saori Hayami→ Lost hers in a University club. <br><br>Guy most had been drunk as fuck.</br></br></br>  Kneel before your queen, faggots  <br>Forced as fuck, must be sucking producer dicks left and right</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  Why is Mai Nakahara the best Seiyuu right now?  <br>She's not, actually.</br>  <br>Not really hers as much as Sony's. Girl's gotta eat somehow, right?</br>  <br>Because I love Rena.</br>  <br>It's Imai and I think shes cute! CUTE! I also like Mimorin too.</br>  I love old ladies  <br>Nana is so kind.</br>  <br>I'll never get used to someone other than her voicing the Major</br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth.</br>  <br><br>I would have assumed that if it actually fit the career progression of the seiyuu listed.<br><br>Horie was a nobody for 5 years, got one hit roll and got huge. Unless the only guy she fucked was the guy who was casting Love Hina it doens't make sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not Romi park </br>  <br>Well after all these years its just normal.</br>  <br>She voices the stepmom in CG</br>  My face when Tokyo Encounter will never be subbed anymore.  <br>You mean her whore mouth.</br>  <br>Exactly. my dick is so happy</br>  <br>voices best girls Juvia and Teru</br>  <br> Reimu </br>  <br>Generation Kill anime when?</br>  <br><br>I don't think she is best either.<br><br>She is damn good though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to see her fly.</br></br>  <br>But she's not a whore.</br>  Saori Hayami, talented VA and good singer<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i12<wbr>KMm863_c</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G3m<wbr>F2SnYrpk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>They've also made it to Japan, huh?</br>  <br>I like her a lot. her monologue in Inou Battle is the only reason to watch the series</br>  <br><br>I called her voicing Hana in the anime adaptation as soon as it was announced. Thank God Japan knows how to type-cast.</br></br>  <br><br>I see why she's a VA. Damn that guy must have been really drunk.</br></br>  <br>She doesnt look ugly.</br>  <br> Damn that guy must have been really drunk <br>eh?<br><br><br> Hana <br> looks like HanaKana <br>what a bizarre coincidence!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch Nana Mizuki Live Flight 2014.</br>  <br>especially on that picture. There is this really unfavorable screencap from a Sekirei promo, if that were posted, that statement would've been relatable.</br>  <br>That's a shop, right?</br>    Would you a Sawashiro Miyuki  I love Aoi<br/>  <br>Another series where she's the only reason to watch</br>  <br>She's married but has she popped a baby out? The latter needs to happen.</br>  <br>Lewdly?</br>  <br> Saori Hayami <br>Wait what's the citation for that?</br></br>  TAMURA YUKARI    <br> Minori Chihara <br> going to a festival with an ex makes you a non virgin now </br></br>  <br><br><br>She's pretty busted and that's actually a good pic of her.</br></br></br>  My dick. <br><br><br>Some things should remain 3D like Ray.</br></br></br>  <br>Coincidence? More like destiny. Literally had Hanazawa's voice in my head every time I read Hana's lines in the manga. It just HAD to happen. It's like when we all read Lord of the Rings years ago and then the movies came out and everyone looked exactly like how we imagined they would. Nicolas Cage even turned down the role of Aragorn. See, good type-casting is more than just an art-form, it's fucking fate.</br>  <br>Uh... its pretty damn obvious that they based Hana on HanaKana, so it was easy to predict she would had been the VA</br>  <br>Why are they kissing? Is there a story behind this?</br>  <br>Japanese are actually one of the lost tribes of Israel.</br>  <br> mangaka basing characters off of real-life anime industry people <br>First of all, Shirobako wasn't an anime adapted from a manga.</br></br>  <br>This guy fucking knows. Also Nana.</br>  <br>Makes sense considering their obsession with idolatry.</br>  <br>Sekirai's 7 years ago, she has lost some weight since then</br>  <br>m8 u wot</br>    <br>Her voice doesn't really fit Hana though</br>  Chiwa Saito  <br>The way they currently have her voicing the character is all over the fucking place, sure, but the way she normally voices anime characters would be perfect if they'd just get a fucking clue.</br>  I like Hocchan  Nothing can top the Gumes for me.  <br>Don't forget Amamiya "Sukkiri" Sora.</br>   NanaMi confirming Sugita's homolust towards Nakamura on her Tokyo Encounter episode   <br> subs never, forever <br>Fuck it.</br></br>  do Yukari and Nana get annoyed that people are so fervent about homoshipping them?  <br>They just ignore it.<br>Nana doesn't give two shits about Yukarin's depression because she's in the middle of a tour and she doesn't have time for bitches.</br></br>  <br>We're never getting the subs.</br>  <br><br> making dosh by just to act gay for a few minutes  <br><br>I doubt it bothers them</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nana wills 3 seasons of Symphogear and a 2 days live in Budoukan <br> doesn't will subs for TE episode featuring her <br>I guess she really doesn't want us to see her burning corpses with Sugita and Nakamura.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If only over-time would continue subbing the series</br></br>  <br>Ai Nonaka. Too bad she is rarely in main cast</br>  <br>Her lips are a bit big but she's pretty cute otherwise.</br>  <br><br>No one gives a shit, fuck off.</br></br>  <br> Nana will never give you tangerines as a gift <br>Kill me</br></br>  <br><br>Truly the worst hell.</br></br>  <br>my negro</br>  <br>Did she learn how to sing yet?</br>  <br>my nigga</br>  <br>me too man</br>   Enjoys to drink <br> Loves Vidya and her work even though it is draining <br> Perfect English <br> Likes anal <br> Currently is lonely <br><br>It is not too late<br>You can accomplish what moot was never able to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>off course<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FU_<wbr>OX6kQq1w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>you forgot<br> is fed up with 3d like the rest of us </br></br>  <br>She just wants her Leon<br><br>Isn't it sad?</br></br></br>  <br>I laugh at her predicament. ;_;</br>  <br>lonely no more</br>  <br>Who's that?</br>  <br>this can't be real</br>  <br>Sure and this is really her daughter</br>      <br>yukino_music</br>  <br>I wonder if HanaKana developed a piss fetish from voicing Hana in Prison School...</br>    <br>Bullshit?</br>  What is your favorite seiyuu's best role?  As a fellow asian I don't understand the appeal of these Japanese seiyuu's, they all look pretty average to below average to me. Never underestimate /a/'s obsession for japanese everything  <br><br>Supreme gentleman please leave.</br></br>  Ionasal is the reason why I love Ai Kakuma's voice. I'm glad that she is being recognized and getting more roles lately.  <br>Nakahara Mai 2.0, the next Nakahara Mai</br>  <br>At least they look better than every people from your race.</br>  <br>Astro-turfing koreans never get old.</br>  <br> caring about looks <br> not caring for their voice and personality instead <br>What a shallow human.</br></br></br>  Young, promising seiyuu.  <br>which is why she's the only one who can save Yukarin from her suicidal tendencies.</br>  <br>Not to mention a pretty scary person according to Sugita, since he can't figure out whether she's just that good at acting like a good girl, or she' really nice at heart.</br>  <br>Pillow seiyuu?</br>  <br>Sugita as Gintoki in Gintama. He was alright as Kyon and Rin from Shuffle!, but I really only started liking him after watching Gintama.</br>  <br>Shit, stop being such a fag. They are all out of your reach anyways.</br>  <br>As in someone who bed producers and those alike to get roles.<br><br>...except for Eri Kitamura. She's so lewd and not ashamed to admit it, makes you wonder whether she sleeps around just for roles or she just simply quite a nympho.</br></br></br>  <br>Means they carry a pillow around because they're workaholics who sleep at recording studios.</br>  <br>Sounds rough.</br>  <br>Yunocchi</br>  <br>I thought only animators do that.</br>  Hayami Saori's best role is actually the retarded dragon girl.   she will never be real   <br>Hence why they need a special term for it, since not every seiyuu does it.</br>  <br>It's Ayase. Every other role of hers is a subset of Ayase.</br>  <br>I think Akira encompasses a lot of what makes Aoi's acting so unique.<br>For sheer vocal range, probably Yagyu Jubei.</br></br>  <br> Emiri Kato→ Same as above. Also went to a date with someone in Disneyland <br>This makes me sad<br> Minami Tsuda→ Discovered to be a non-virgin by NicoNicofags. <br>This makes me very upset<br><br>I wanted to be their first</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> repost the copypasta that I personally ranslated from 2ch <br> but don't post the "virgins" segment for maximum butthurt <br>One job.</br></br></br>  <br>Really?

Posting Wakamoto in a seiyuu thread is like posting a picture of fillet mignon in a thread about hamburgers</br>  <br>Tamura isn't attractive without copius amount of PS and make up, so there is that.<br>Also, generalizations are stupid.

I know its different for guys, but I as soon as I start to see bald patches I'm shaving it all off.</br>    <br>Underrated frogpost.</br>  36 year olds do NOT look like that, jesus christ  <br>you wrong for that</br>  <br>Looks like Genkai from Yuyu Hakusho.</br>    <br> dat 18 years old Sugita <br>Holy shit</br></br>  Aging celebs thread?<br><br>I'll start.</br></br>  <br>Sugita looks like such a bro.</br>  <br>And to think only two of those seiyuu actually made it big.</br>  <br>People grow old.</br>  <br>did anyone like axl rose though</br>  <br>Millennials don't.</br>  <br>who is that?</br>    <br>She always looked like that</br>  <br>Who cares?<br><br>I like my VA for his works,not for the looks.<br><br>Not every seiyuu needs to be an Idol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The day Nana starts looking like that is the day i kill myself</br>  <br>But I thought all Japanese people aged like Araki.</br>  <br>Poor Rie.<br><br>Yui Horie on the other hand...</br></br></br>  <br>Photoshop, no fucking shit. Just like literally EVERY OTHER SEIYUU IMAGE.</br>  <br>I know, it's amazing how they turned a middle-aged man into a cute looking 20 year old</br>  <br>seriously, if she just dress her age, she wouldn't look that bad. stop dressing like you're still 16 for god sakes.</br>  Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.  <br> stubby fingers <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br> all of them with makeup on <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  when you fag realize that only Mizuki Nana is the eternal teenager seiyuu despite being old hag?  <br>I tried taking a few years off of her face.<br>Nope.<br>I'm just spooking myself with how creepy she looks now.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck, she looks like this smug cat</br>  <br>Japan got slightly less ugly through the magic of photoshop.</br>  What happened to 2.5D?

They are not that bad.</br>  <br>Reminds me of those fox masks</br>    <br>I got bad news for you.<br>This was at last week's Music Station, so a show where they put in lots of effort to make the guests look good.</br></br>  <br> googled victorian era photographs dead <br> childs everywhere <br>Shit. Thanks anon, I wanted to see this at night and alone. Fuck the 19th century and their creepy old photos.</br></br></br>  <br>That isn't too bad, actually<br>The lighting would make any face look older, and she's probably tired out from the singing and dancing</br></br>  <br>Stress, drugs, and too much sunlight can make you look older than you actually are.</br>  <br><br>She actually used to look fairly cute when she was younger.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd make her tired from something else. If you know what I mean.<br><br>When she first started to get popular I thought she looked like a little girl, but man she got fucking hot. Not the best pic of her there, but I'd still hit that shit.</br></br></br></br>  Kugimiya is still like in her 30's, by asian standard they should still look like in their teens. What the fuck happened  <br>all except 1999 overexposed. Fuck japan.</br>  <br>Its called makeup.</br>  <br> what is makeup </br>  <br>That's perfect.</br>     caring what people who are only good for their voices look like <br>Fucking wotas</br>  <br>yeah that's nothing. nowhere near as bad as op's picture. nana still looks decent. rie kugimiya looks like she has been on a meth bender.</br>  <br>Holy fuck did she do drugs or something?</br>  <br>Lots of make up there. No surprise that women lose their luster as they grow older while men at times roughen out much better.</br>  <br>I know, right? Grade schoolers are the best.</br>  <br><br>Sugita has a best bro for life that he may be secretly gay for.<br><br>She doesn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>secret as in "not secret at all"?</br>   Rie looks 20 years older without makeup <br> Sugita is going bald and wears the beanie everywhere now <br> Mari Ijima is still fuckable at 52 despite having gone through a divorce, living in burgerland for the last 20 years, and having sons that already finished college <br><br>How the fuck did she pull it off?<br><br><br><br>Secretly as in "he hasn't told Nakamura directly how he feels because he's afraid of how it'll affect their friendship"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Early menopause?</br>  <br><br>Considering how many nobodies there are to successful seiyuu that's actually pretty good.</br></br>  <br>why do asian women shrink so much?<br>I know woman typically get smaller towards elder ages but it just seems so extremes in asians.</br></br>  <br>Her career all but died in her teenage years so she focused on having a normal life, for one.</br>  <br>That would me guess, we are seeing the start of the transformation.<br><br>No idea, it would be interesting to know the answer to that.</br></br></br>  Why exactly does it matter what a VOICE ACTOR looks like?  <br><br>Because they're 2.5D</br></br>  <br><br>Damn my curiosity.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for sharing.</br>    I just want to remind everyone that Megumi Hayashibara still looks pretty good  <br>Amazing how that one pic killed the thread.</br>  YUKARIN WILL ALWAYS BE CUTE<br><br>ALWAYS BE CUTE</br></br>  <br>And alone. Always be alone.</br>  Is this /jp/? Who are these people, and why should I care?  I still think Kugimiya is either sick or on drugs and can barely hide it anymore. It's unnatural for someone to age that badly within a couple of years. Her face looks swollen and stiff. Not even natural aging but like something is seriously fucking wrong. And it looks like she's wearing a wig. What's worse is that she keeps trying to maintain her idol image even though it seems she doesn't do too many idol events anymore. I wish whatever's going on, she would come out with it or at least stop it with the idol image. It's seriously fucking creepy.  <br> stupid namefag <br>You certainly live up to your name. They voice your Chinese cartoons. Without them you'd only have moving pictures and sound effects.</br></br>  <br>Would make the medium a lot better honestly.</br>  <br>Maybe for you, but I'm not sure many people will agree with that opinion.</br>  <br>Have you seen what the average VA gets paid?<br>For that money you could buy ten times as many rice bowls to feed more animators with.<br>Better animation quality but no voice acting, count me in.</br></br></br>  <br>average VA gets paid so much, they have to work convenience stores to make ends meet.<br>Just because names like Miyano, Sawashiro and Hanazawa get paid top cash, let's not forget there are legions of C-list and below seiyuu who have to rely on other sources of income.</br></br>  <br>Why is the entire medium dysfunctional?</br>  <br> implying the production commitee wouldn't just pocket the savings </br>  <br> she would come out with it <br><br>That would most possibly be career suicide in Nipponland.</br></br></br>  <br>Animators &gt; Chink voice actors</br>  <br>Blame the anime business model for that.</br>  <br>shitload of output of shows aimed at a rather small demographic, who, even when willing to spend all their money, couldn't support the entire anime-industry if they'd actually pay living wages.<br><br>Things could get better if agencies would distribute their earnings from their aces more to the rookies and lower-tiers. But those cuts for the A-list would mean them switching agencies, even though they make more than enough money.<br><br>Example in case: Hanazawa Kana. I like her a lot, but when she buys a fuck ugly wool sweater for $300 that shows that she gets paid too much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How the fuck did she pull it off? <br><br>She treats her body like a temple. Many of the best looking actresses do manage to look great even at 60. They don't take recreational drugs. That really does change a body and the changes are reflected in the face (and organs and other parts of course). Mari Iijima is a non-smoker. Smoking ages a body. Eating poorly and having diets to re-slim down also causes aging effects. Getting enough sleep regularly prevents bags under the eyes. While makeup hides the dark areas, there is still no disguising that bags under the eyes loosens the youthful look of the face and makes for a sagging patch of skin under the eyes. Etcetera. <br><br>Taking care of their bodies is certainly hard because it is too tempting to party hard, drink a lot, take recreational drugs at parties, etc. Mari Iijima also probably doesn't go into bad environmental conditions. If she worked on a fishing boat, her nose and cheeks would get that "leathery seaman skin" look for example.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she gets paid too much due to her applying for so many roles per season.<br><br><br>What's funny is that the dumb cunts don't know that eating poorly and having diets does nothing to help you shed fat. If anything they're putting on even more weight when their body goes into starvation mode like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Example in case: Hanazawa Kana. I like her a lot, but when she buys a fuck ugly wool sweater for $300 that shows that she gets paid too much. <br>That shows literally nothing about how much she gets paid.</br></br>  <br>asian genes are a double edged sword.<br>sometimes you end up beautiful, sometimes a complete troglodyte.<br><br>not even makeup can save you then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He should just shave it, Asian males (especially the Japanese) look cooler when shaved.</br>  <br>throwing out this amount of cash for something that universally can be considered fuck-ugly you lack a sense fiscal responsibility and are likely to just have to much money at your disposal.<br><br>pic related.</br></br></br>  These posts getting so defensive about people ribbing her for how she's aged. To be fair she's only 36, she has aged terribly.  <br>she had a bad face day. like, really. didn't sleep, no make up, maybe stress and health trouble. she doesn't look that bad normally.</br>  <br>Which shows nothing about how much she is getting paid.<br>She could be making millions a year and buying ugly sweaters that she can easily afford, she could be making literally nothing and digging herself into debt with her lust for expensive ugly sweaters. Unless you can show all her other expenses, pointing out a single item is useless in trying to tell how much she earns.</br></br>  <br>Somehow I doubt a lack of sleep and all that other shit would be enough to drastically alter someone's face like that.</br>  <br>there's no need to tell anyone how much she makes. She's one of the most in demand seiyuu around, topping roles per season charts for years, no need to look into tax files to figure out she's loaded.</br>  <br>Well, it depends on what it is. If it's a disease, surely her fans will understand and give support if she asks for it. If it's drugs, then well serves her right. I find it hard to believe the nips aren't talking about her weird looks.</br>  <br>A creepy otaku-jii and a creepy former oba-idoru, they should just get married already. Imai-san is too cute for Sugita.</br>  <br>Doubtful it's natural aging.</br>  <br> she had a bad face day. </br>  <br>Photoshop Sugita's face there and let's see if it looks good.</br>  <br>if you look at other material just as recent as that gintama screencap, she doesn't look as strained as in OPs picture. It's really not as bad as that picture makes it seem.<br>And to be frank: she never was among the best looking seiyuu around.</br></br>  <br>The fuck</br>  <br>see <br><br>Also,who are you fooling?</br></br></br>  <br>nice edit, anon</br>  <br>Is that her or a melting wax figure of her?</br>  <br>you reference a screencap from 2008 (look at the poster in the background) do argue against a point that basically was "kugimiya never was good looking, but there are pics from the same time as OP pic where she didn't look as fucked up"<br><br>don't give yourself up. learn to read.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd do it if I could into photoshop.</br>  <br> but there are pics from the same time as OP pic where she didn't look as fucked up <br><br>[Citation Needed]<br><br>inb4<br> And anon was never heard from again. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want Froppy to age.  ;_; </br>  january this year  <br><br>Well, once she dies we will be able to embalm her body so.</br></br>  june  <br> see, here's her in January <br> she looks just as bad </br></br>  last year  <br>Who is that cross-dressing man with a wig?</br>  <br><br><br>So she really has aged badly since last year.</br></br></br>  <br>The Cryptkeeper.</br>  <br><br><br> 36 </br></br></br>  She didn't age so good.  <br> due to her applying for so many roles per season <br>Do you think she will go around auditioning that she is that popular people will ask her to be in their show not to mention her agency is Sony Music they create so many shows every season they can just give her as many roles they wants.</br></br>  <br>Who wants to go next?</br>  <br>She ages fucking bad.</br>  <br><br>And most likely won't survive past 2015.<br><br>Trust me, she'll dead by suicide before this year ends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i wonder how horie yui looks beneath the stone mask she puts on every morning before she leaves the house</br>  <br>I don't think time was on her side to be perfectly honest.</br>  Meanwhile, in Inoue, Kikuko...  <br><br>I miss Tokyo Encounter.</br></br>  <br>She's a cyborg.

If you watch her concerts you'll clearly see her true, not fucking photoshopped face.<br>Still, her face is still better than the others, I think her face is still going to look okay for 20 more years since she said her mother still looks young despite her age.</br></br>  <br>Her intense lifestyle will take a toll on her very soon though.</br>  <br>It's okay, if she's stuffing herself, they're all going to her hooters.</br>  <br>Chinese people don't age so good. Weird, innit?</br>  <br>It is already.<br>If you heard her performance in Music Japan and Music Station of Exterminate, you'll hear she's quite off. I think its just fatigue because she's still on her tour, but young Nana can pull off that kind of song like cake. She made Mysterion before, and I think that's more hard to sing than Exterminate. <br><br>She alreadu got hospitalized in 2014, now that she's going on a fucking spree again and she's also goinh to Budoukan in 2016, I'm sure Nana will visit the hospital again very soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw she's probably planning to fly again in Budoukan next year <br>I guess I need to start preparing myself once Nana finally kicks the bucket because of too much hardwork and guts.</br></br>  Sugita has been balding for over a decade and shaven his head at least twice (last time around the filming of Wonderful World, ie. 2010). His condition is actually better now than few years ago, which is noticable to anyone who follows Tokyo Encount (or listens to radio featuring him, where he often makes jokes about his own scalp). <br><br>Anyone who keeps raving his baldness now is either a newfag or troll.</br></br>  <br>Where did you hide the mask, Araki? Spill the beans!</br>  <br><br>she needs to settle down already. she had her run and it was a great run, but the signs are on the horizon that her best years have passed. better to end it on a relatively high note.<br><br>she can still just go full enka</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know how stereotypical little old ladies or old men have this hunched over look?

Rie's trying too hard to look like a 16 year old and it just makes her even more gross.</br>  <br>I kind of agree to you because its like she's kind of positively trying to commit suicide doing work endlessly and pushing herself to the limits. But then again, Nana said she wants to fulfill all of her dreams, and well, she never runs out of them.<br><br> Nana's best years are over <br>Go to http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/2<wbr>015-07-27/<br>Look for Nana.<br>Reminder that these charts are for popular as fuck, highest selling singers, artists, bands, and idols. <br>So far Nana is still in the chart, which means she's still fucking popular.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nana's best years are over <br>i meant physically. her popularity won't wane. but people may notice that she can't deliver her performances as powerfully as she used to at some point and that may change people's outlook on her. more and more fans may be on the lookout for mistakes and missteps, chronicling her slow descent. that would be depressing.</br></br>  <br> ar u havin a giggle m8 </br>  <br>Well, I think her fans will still support her. Some of her fans are still way back 2001. They're extremely loyal to her, so I think they will see through Nana's career till the day Nana fulfills all of her dreams.<br><br>I know I will see it through the end. Nana's life is really like my chinese cartoons, and it would be a shame to stop supporting her now the conclusion is just a few chapters away.</br></br></br>  <br> Nana fulfills all of her dreams. <br>can you stop it with this naive nonsense tho? you make yourself sound like a tool.</br></br>  Aoi gets prettier by the year.  <br><br>It is probably the result of her getting annoyed by being forced to voice tsundere roles most of the time</br></br>  <br>How old he is?<br>he looks 40 years old at most</br></br>  <br>He was born in 1960, so he's 55.</br>  <br>damn son</br>  <br>she looks like somebody's kindly middle aged mum.<br><br>on the other hand Rie Tanaka looks like somebody's alcoholic older sister on rehab or something, what happened?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, Jojo has been with us for almost 30 years now  and by a relative comparison, Toriyama is only 5 years older than him </br></br>  <br>good luck with that</br>  <br>women age like flowers, limp saggy and wilted<br>men age like trees, big crusty and strong</br></br>  <br> One grows senile and lazy <br> The other reaches the peak of his life every year anew. </br></br>  <br>I'm expecting her to shrink into a small yoda-ish kung fu master who hops around pranking the youngins when she gets old</br>  <br><br>And Miura is worse than Toriyama and he's only 49</br></br>    <br>rip Arihiro Hase</br>  <br>Yukarin is cute in her very own special way.</br>  will there be a single seiyuu currently in her mid-twenties still be relevant in 20 years?<br><br>my nomination.</br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Aoi was pretty much born an actress.

I don't really see this current iteration of seiyuu to last more than 5 years.</br>  <br>she will drop out volunteraily before the end of this decade. she's too smart for this shitty business.</br>  <br>Nah, she'll be like Noto Mamiko before her (irrelevant in 10 years).</br>  <br>I want Nana to sing me a lullaby every night before going to bed.

It's not a joke filename. It's just room 101 actually being empty.</br>  <br>I like this meme.</br>  <br>Guess they are saving the trip for the next ova  or season 3 .</br>  This past episode was just perfect. The teru teru bozu arc was absolutely hilarious and the Flatty-san arc was simply beautiful, from its mono no aware to its heartwarming climax illustrating the innocent, youthful realization of the miracle of life. The climax in particular, the way it was directed with the music and the interspersed shots of nature and the cycle of life... just fucking stunning. Why is this so AOTY?  <br>This episode demonstrated the transient beauty of life in a way I haven't seen since YKK.</br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br>I will always remember this scene as the exact moment she became my waifu.</br>  <br>Didn't you see her sniffle and wipe her eyes?</br>  Is there going to be a season 3?   Next episode will be an anime original featuring school pool <br><br>Besides being surprised that the school actually has one, does this mean we will see Hotaru in a school swimsuit  and more Koma-chan misery? </br></br>  <br>I sure hope so. I'm just about ready to move this show into the 1a/1b slot of GOAT SoLs along with ARIA. One more episode this season the quality of S1E04, S1E10 or S2E04 and that should do it.</br>  why isn't Komari wearing her sukumizu?  <br>They appeared fully clothed, not even in swimsuits, while in the pool in the preview.<br> Thank God. The last thing we need is these threads next week circlejerking over middle and elementary schoolers in swimsuits. </br></br>  <br>Since you seem to favour the Renge episodes, what did you think of the OVA? I thought that was around the same level of quality and high amount of Renge-focused introspection.</br>  <br>This hitted me hard, since my dog is sick and getting surgery tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well, we technically had that when S1 aired didn't it?</br></br>  <br> S1E10 <br>That episode was magical.</br></br>  <br>I have no mouth and I must scream.</br>  <br>I love every NNB episode and loved the OVA but I'm not sure the OVA lives up to those three episodes I mentioned. I may be biased because the OVA was &lt;720p. <br>I feel that Renge is the show's most unique, entertaining character by a good margin. I don't think those episodes are the best episodes because they're Renge episodes, though. I think it's more that the writing and directing of this show really seem to excel when they're focusing on heartwarming moments and they seem to focus these heartwarming moments around Renge.</br></br>  <br>only if they cry from below.</br>  <br>Good answer. I guess you can't just say all the episodes are great but I agree with what you're saying. I personally find the Natsumi/Komari sisterhood moments to be some of the best heartwarming stuff too, but it might also be a personal bias owing to it reminds me of how me and my sister were as kids. But just the understated thoughtful moments are the best, like when they run away and Natsumi sees that a cat stole food from them to feed her kittens, and that's what finally makes her think "we should go home."<br><br>I hope for more Natsumi/Komari stuff this season, at least one or two episodes.</br></br></br>  Best girl. She'll become a great mother and wife.  <br> She'll become a great mother <br>Will probably need C-section.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Koma-chan</br></br>  <br> giving birth to children is only something 7 feet tall giantesses can do <br><br>No, anon. No.</br></br></br>  Holy FUCK this show looks depressing. I've never watched this but is this the show's selling point?  <br>Komari is the one who needs a C-section and a 7th-month delivery, Natsumi will be fine.</br>  <br>People will claim otherwise but all the depressing episodes are also the most popular ones.</br>  <br>What a depressing edit.</br>  <br>She was always best girl. If you rewatch S1 and pay attention you will notice that Natsumi is usually very aware of social situations and the feelings of the people around her and acts accordingly. More often than any other character she does small things and gestures that makes others feel good about themselves and have fun. This episode was just the most obvious example.</br>  <br>This post contain so much truth</br>  <br> entire anime original episode <br><br>Does the school really have a pool in the manga?</br></br></br>  <br> the temptation of the shovel <br>She's so used to digging graves for Vietnamese children that it's become a reflex.</br></br>  <br> crop her shop her <br>CROP HER SHOP HER DROP HER TOP HER BOP HER COP HER MOP HER HOP HER</br></br>  <br>Give me templates.</br>  <br> Tfw the only time we see Renge smiling is when she's wearing a mask she made herself <br>This shit is too heavy for me.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I don't understand but I like it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I thought that was Koma.

How can BONES make something this good? This is totally going against all the expectations. This adaptation has been fucking great so far. <br><br>Or were the expectations too low to begin with?</br></br>  <br> How can BONES make something this good? <br>Is this your first BONES show?</br></br>  <br>I expected absolutely fuckin nothing. It's not like BONES are bad tho, they are mostly &lt;in&gt;famous for their anime original stuff.</br>  <br> (You) </br>  This isn't really an unusual performance for Bones so far. It's the endings you have to watch out for.  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>I was expecting an Akatsuki no Yona clone so I was pleasantly surprised despite being repeatedly told that it was nothing like Yona.</br>  <br>She's so CUTE!</br>  <br>That's a big meme of its own</br>  <br>It's pretty fantastic. My only complaint is that they removed all the humor from Shirayuki's character, she's a bit too mellow. But other than that, it's beautiful and has a fantastic atmosphere.</br>  <br> How can BONES make something this good? <br>How can you watch a show that's retarded for not making an in-demand pharmacist make dyes to hide her hair?</br></br>  <br>It's okay. It's riddled with romance cliches, and it seems to be fine with that, but it's not very exciting.</br>  <br>This. There's got to be a bunch of explosions for my interest to be kept.</br>  <br> salty <br>I don't understand people who can bear to watch the same retarded romantic cliches every season and deceive the viewer about the female character's competence.</br></br>  <br>It's all about the execution of said cliches, which has been fine so far.<br> deceive the viewer about the female character's competence. <br>What?<br><br>Are you sure you're not the salty one?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like when people deceive others so they'll watch their faggot show.<br> Shirayuki <br> competent <br>The guys always clean up after her ideas. How's that competent?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>yeah it's great, definitely AOTS.</br>  This series does things to my heartboner.  <br>explain further</br>  <br>I thought she was proud of her hair color even though she gets in trouble cause of it</br>  <br>His decisions and actions don't make her incompetent.</br>  It's not like BONES never made a good show, it's just that they've been struggling recently. <br><br>This is probably their best since E7, unless I'm speaking too soon</br></br>  <br><br>Darker than Black, FMA:B, and Tokyo Mag 8.0 were all in between now and E7. Otherwise I'd agree with you.</br></br>  <br>None of those were as good, I believe. Star Driver is in that area too and while I loved the show, I wouldn't call it good.</br>  <br><br> HEARTBONER </br></br>  <br>Maybe it has something to do with original material for adaptation?</br>  <br> FMA:B <br>That was terrible.</br></br>  I hope there isn't a lot of drama, I don't think I'd be able to continue watching if there was.  <br>I don't think this is bad, but I guess I'm missing whatever makes people love it so much. It's a bit overly dramatic/hammy for my tastes.</br>  <br>But this is BONES, who had the large potential for fucking it up.<br><br>As of yet, they've done quite the opposite</br></br></br>  Shirayuki a cute.  <br>Ouran came out right after E7 and this isn't quite as good as that yet.</br>  <br><br>It has good atmosphere. A lot of shoujo just run through the tropes and the setting is inconsequential or exists just to support the romance.<br><br>In this it feels like a living breathing world with plenty of characters who don't give a fuck about whether MC gets her prince or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ouran was after E7?<br><br>I had thought it was older</br></br></br>  <br>I actually thought it was good, too. But then<br> Girl gets saved once an episode <br> Dialogue that would make Yahari's writer cringe <br> No attempt at romantic subtlety <br> Muh girl meets prince scenario </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Came out right when E7 ended</br>  <br>Are we talking about the same series?</br>  <br>aots</br>  This anime is making me wish for more herbalism/alchemy in anime, Atelier anime when  <br>It's like you didn't watch the last 3 episodes.</br>  <br>seems boring</br>  <br> I didn't watch it </br>  <br>But it would have cute girls doing cute things, like eating cake over a pot filled with dangerous bubbling liquids.</br>  <br>Not him, but I agree that the dialogue has been pretty bad. I could also do with fewer close-ups of people's faces looking determined while they're speaking or shocked while someone else is speaking.</br>  <br><br>wtf, what he described is exactly what happens.<br><br>sure she has this stupid "I'm a strong womyn, gon' get where I want by myself" act going<br><br>But then she just breaks down in tears while reading some undoubtedly dry medical log. Like god fucking dammit, gimme a break. And then gets saved by the fuccboi. goddamit. I dropped this last episode like 3 times before finishing. Had to stop and play a few games of dota in the middle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think this is a bit above average at best, but these last few threads have had more and lazier bait than fucking Gangsta threads do.  <br> dota <br><br>7/10 Almost had me.</br></br></br>  <br> Or were the expectations too low to begin with? <br><br>This story is like one of those romance novels featuring the secretary and the billionaire. There's tons of variances of these stories. Nanny and the billionaire. Pharmacist and the billionaire. Etcetera. <br><br>Of course, we had many western romance novels in similar vein. Nanny and the Rich Rancher. Storekeeper and the Rancher. Etc. And of course, the most old and classic romance novels featured girl and the Prince. Poor girl and the prince. Etc.<br><br>From watching 4 episodes so far and trying to look at the story as a story being revealed chapter by chapter, it has very few normal story elements. Instead, each story and the characters appear as needed to make Shirayuki look good or endear us to the Prince. <br><br>As for the story being Snow White with the Red Hair, it is one of those tacked on concepts to help the show sell character goods while building up to the inevitable Snow White scene with the poisoned apple and the Prince has to rescue her with a kiss. Of course, this gives the perfect excuse for the Prince to kiss Shirayuki without any prurient motives. Happy non-prurient Ending.<br><br>And no, what I said was not a spoiler because the show has been pushing the Snow White thing and poisons episode after episode. It's shoved in the face of anyone who has ever read about Snow White except there are no dwarves like Doc, Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy, etcetera.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok you went too far I almost took it seriously. Impressive powers, anon</br>  <br><br> shit taste <br> dota <br><br>Put your trip Lelouch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think this is a bit above average at best, but these last few threads have had more and lazier bait than fucking Gangsta threads do. <br><br>The problem is the show has a lazy plot. It's like walking down a long linear visual novel "game" with almost no branches. And the few branches that exist have only one scene and thus no depth. In other words, this show is a good example of a forced plot anime. The forced plot screams out at you. <br><br>Is that bad. No, there are plenty of fans of that kind of story. Not every anime opportunity that Bones gets can be juicy highly acclaimed Grace A properties like Full Metal Alchemist. This anime original show is fine for those who liked Dog Days'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't summon that retard.</br>  <br><br>Why is dota so bad?</br></br>  <br> more and lazier bait than Gangsta </br>  <br>It's not. It's the best MOBA which has mechanics that are just complex enough and character models that are sufficiently unattractive to keep the shitty 13 year olds out.</br>  <br> This anime original show <br>But it's a manga adaption</br></br>  <br> This anime original show <br><br>I didn't even have to read the whole thing to find out this was bait. Go back to your haremshit and Shonenshit faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> forced plot <br> had to stop to play dota <br>I don't think I'm overexaggerating, honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> I actually thought it was good, too. But then <br> Girl gets saved once an episode <br> Dialogue that would make Yahari's writer cringe <br> No attempt at romantic subtlety <br> Muh girl meets prince scenario <br><br><br> wtf, what he described is exactly what happens. <br><br>A lot of fake suspense in the show so far except for the original creepy Prince that wanted her. As for Snow White, she already had her poisoned apple in the 2nd episode and was protected by her prince. Not much of a poison apple as it was paralyzing and not killing.<br><br>More like the "low level threat" shoujo romance show with forced shoujo ending. But she claims to be achieving everything on her own, yet she depends on her friendship with the prince for getting as far as she has. She has no money worries as well as a number of other concerns since the show blithely skips over inconvenient necessary things. I say necessary because while these may be unncessary in other anime shows, in this show things like money are necessary because Shirayuki makes such a big deal about "making it on her own" yet there is very little of that going on anywhere even in the first episode. A herbalist spiderweb in the corner business that doesn't run on money is not making it on her own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Prince saving her <br>Don't the signs point towards him falling to some poison with her rescuing him?</br></br>  <br>You were totally correct. It was forced plot. The fans of the show are just looking for any excuse to fault you. "Oh look, you misspelled one word, therefore everything you said was wrong!".<br><br><br> But it's a manga adaption <br>If the manga is just like the anime, then the same criticisms apply to the manga as well. But if there are anime-original elements, then there is a chance the manga is like the anime and actually has a little depth in the plot. For the sake of the manga, hopefully the anime is different.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, I pretty much punched my computer during the medical log scene, but even still I was able to make out impending likelikhood of <br><br> ooooh shit, looks like some fuckers gonna throw a dart or something at this prince in the middle nowhere forest somewhere <br><br> whhhooaaatt are all these plants doing here in the middle of nowhere that I can use to brew some nasty shit to save his tuchus <br> and maybe reference some shit from that medical log <br> epbic storytellan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She has no money worries <br>She had a job she was good at, it's not far fetched to assume she has enough money to not worry about it until the end of the royal herbalist test.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, these threads are unbearable.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I misunderstand what you are saying, but he wasn't poisoned by a dart, it was an apple (aimed at Shirayuki) and she wasn't able to cure the poison, it's why she surrendered to Raji.</br>  <br>It looks like poison is all over the story so far. The prince took poisons to try to build up immunity. She's been paralyzed by poison in an attempt by royalty to exercise their legal rights (might makes right in that kingdom).<br><br>It would be cockeyed story to keep on using poison over and over and over and over in the plot. If the prince gets poisoned again, that would be overuse of the poison plot trick.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm predicting what will likely happen, given the emphasis on her being a strong willed ho, who act independently and wait for it...<br><br> ... <br><br>save the prince<br><br><br>UN FUCKING BELIEVEABLE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DanMachi had a lot more strong-willed self-made women in it.</br>  <br>Because they don't sell.</br>   mfw these threads are no longer comfy   <br>You have a point.</br>  <br>Are we watching the same thing?

And I swear, what is wrong with the males? They look like boys. At least Dawn of Yona had some hunks.</br></br></br>  Only dropped 4 shows this season, this is one of them.  <br>This is the closest thing we'll ever get to an Atelier anime.</br>  ITT: Girls who wear nice shoes    I know they're not popular in the least but I have a raving hardon for tabi and geta sandals.  Only correct answer.  <br>Shit smell-tier.</br>  <br>I couldn't have stated it any better.</br>  Miku and Hibiki ask you to impregnate them because same-sex couples can't adopt in Japan<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>717121</wbr> <br> [얼티메이트] [150729] TVアニメ「戦姫絶唱シンフォギアGX(Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX)」EDテーマ「Rebirth-day」／高垣彩陽 [通常盤] (320K) </br></br>   three seasons <br> Gyakkou no Flugel and Zettou Ameno are still the best songs <br><br>What went wrong?</br></br></br>  Only if I can marry Hibiki.  I actually think Hibiki will recover next chapter, and after that she will have to face her biggest issue, probably about her late past.<br><br>This comatose status won't last too much,  I hope so. </br></br>  <br>Worst OP post I've seen so far this season.<br><br><br>FUCK YEAH.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll marry them both, polygamy haters get out.</br></br>  <br>No FLAC again?</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Anyone who claims Hbiki as a waifu but denies her her sunshine should be publicly executed.</br>  <br> You will never sleep in the middle of a sunshine sandwich <br>Why even live</br></br>  <br><br> Worst OP post I've seen so far this season. <br><br>Do you missed the crackshipping one with Miku and Chris?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell them "symphogeah"</br>  <br>Anon you will marry no one, Hibiki will fist you fully so you would come faster and Miku could extract your sperm into the cup, nothing else for you than a knowledge you will have a kid but won't be allowed to be a father to him/her.</br>  So how long until Gary eats Carol and becomes the real villain?  <br>Go back to your cage, we're not even close to bump limit yet.</br>  <br> implying crackshipping yourself with any of the girls isn't worse </br>  So are we going to get symphogear Miku next episode?  Just the best.  <br>I thought Mikugear won't come back again. Isn't she supposed to kick ass some other way?</br>  <br> why even live <br><br>Because you need to hold out for the movie in 2016.</br></br></br>    <br><br>What's that I read about a movie now and then?<br>Is this just a troll or are there actual rumors?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mikugeah isn't supposed to appear again, staff said so, but for some reason I can't buy that. I really hope they're trying hard to keep it a secret.</br></br></br>  <br> 2016 <br>That's very optimistic.</br></br>  <br>Mikugear  was shit and Miku is not supposed to be a fighter. I don't understand why people want it back </br>  <br><br>Fine isn't supposed to appear again as well. Or Kanade.<br>But I don't think we can trust the stuff on anything they say.</br></br></br>  <br>I pulled that out of my ass, but there has been a desire to do a movie so it's not entirely unfounded. Believe in justice.</br>  So do we know what Gary's actual plan is yet?<br><br>No chance in hell is she going to be happy just licking Carol's feet clean every night</br></br>  <br>I agree. Miku is the sunshine that waits for Biki.</br>  <br>Why do people get so fixated on Mikugeah? It was nice, but it was better because it was only temporary.</br>  Anyone else really liking these?<br><br>A lot of the time they're my favorite part of the episode after the songs</br></br>  <br><br>Please no movie, better make another TV season.</br></br>  <br>They better not. While the design and song was nice, it was the most hamfisted dues ex machina for the series.</br>  <br> Mikuhat <br><br>Every fucking time.</br></br></br>    <br>We need a full webseries for Zesshoushinai. And more SoL material in general.</br>  <br>What are you talking about exactly? Those are from last season.</br>  <br>Maybe she will learn alchemy from Carol or Fine (if she somehow returns), but that will be probably more relevant in movie than this season.<br><br><br>It's just Giaru givinig you hope, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What if Miku becomes a gear?</br></br></br>  <br>Even worse.</br>  So is Hibiki going to get another scar?  ED is out.  <br> DRAKNESS <br> DON'T BE AFLAID <br>Bravo Ayahi.<br><br>Nah I'm just messing. It's a refreshing change after watching the linguistic holocaust known as the Psycho Pass movie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Donate my sperm via artificial insemination, so they can keep their relationship pure.</br>  <br>Help them, of course.</br>  <br>Speaking of that, what happened with Shenshou Jing?</br>  <br>Is this supposed to be another dyke ballad? I like it.</br>  Remember when this was Chris?  <br>It isn't a coma - it's shock to her system. It'll probably be a temporary paralysis, unless they decide to play the psychological angle, which would totally destroy her character.<br><br>If anything, they might pull out the drama as"I wanna fight!" "No, your body is still recovering" for a couple episodes, until they level up Gungnir.</br></br></br>  <br> Miku goes full yandere <br> makes herself into a gear so that by being worn by Hibiki she'll always be as close as possible to her <br> her weapon of choice are intense beams of energy and light because she's her sunshine <br> Gungnir is not needed anymore and passes to Maria <br> Mikugear stays on Hibiki forever, she can't get take it off ever again <br> Hibiki becomes an empty shell, living and fighting with soulless eyes while Mikugear clings to her body on its own will <br> finally she breaks and they together become the final boss in season 5 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I see your true colors. <br>Does that mean she can tell if someone is a lesbian?<br><br> like a rainbow <br>I think you're right.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Double tap</br>  <br>Didn't Carol make all the Autoscorah's?<br>While she seems like the kinda character to stab her boss in the back i can't see the dolls being made without some innate loyalty to their maker.  Or a failsafe, of the explosive kind. I kinda want to see that scenaro play out.  Then again she's "rotten".</br></br>   Noise dolls   <br>She was good.<br><br>Now she's better.</br></br></br>  <br> Beat the shit out of anyone who thinks about fighting. <br>I miss her, /a/.</br></br>  <br>Because, even without the gear, she had enough strength to launch the artifact into the whole and blow shit up. She deserves to be able to kick ass, as much as the others do.<br><br> And Mikugear wasn't shit. You're the shit, so go flush yourself down the shitter, you worthless shit. </br></br></br>  <br>It was destroyed along with Hibiki's Gungnir.</br>  <br><br> "Now kiss!" </br></br>  <br>You can get your own.<br>The grapes come on and off with velcro. It's pretty cute.</br></br>  <br>Give them an extensive scolding about how they're too young to take such a big responsibility, specially considering the extra hardships that come with raising a child as a same-sex couple in an extremely conservative society like Japan.</br>  <br>Wake up</br>  So the shards that got embedded into Hibiki were apparently pieces of the sympho armor and not the actual gungnir crystal.<br>Is this a plot hole? Did the crystal vanish along with Kanade?</br>  If &gt; Rebirth-day ≥ True Colors  <br>What if  they found a fragment composed by fused bits of Gungnir and Shenshou Jing.   And then try to make it work with Dainslef. </br>  <br> linguistic holocaust known as the Psycho Pass movie <br>They are just aiming for realistic SEA English.</br></br>  Garie needs your sperm to power up Micah, but you die as a shriveled up corpse in the process.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br>What if there were bits and pieces of Gungnir and Shenshou Jing with Hibiki's and Miku's DNA and they combined and mutated into a science baby?</br>  <br> unless they decide to play the psychological angle, which would totally destroy her character. <br>I want the "Hibiki can't have psychological issues" meme to stop already.</br></br>  <br> Didn't Carol make all the Autoscorah's? <br><br>She thinks she did, but Garie controls her memories so who knows.<br><br>Either that or the part of her personality she made Garie from is too psychotic to accept her master being talked down from destroying the world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would buy this before buying any figure.<br><br> Is it available for sale? </br></br></br>  <br>Need to check the extra material on this one, but  where do you think Maria's Gungnir came from? </br>  <br>Live 2016 at Budokan should be just as good a reason to live.</br>  <br>That's not coming until Symphogear ARC-ViVid.</br>  <br>What if she made Garie with the intent that Garie would manipulate her own memories because she couldn't bring herself to take revenge for her father unless she erased some inconvenient memories that were holding her back first? So now she thinks Garie is following her orders when Garie is actually following the agenda of pre-memory-wipe Carol.</br>  <br><br>That's dumb<br><br>Where would I even put it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her mouth.</br>  <br>Garie's or Micah's?</br>  <br>You need to use a forwarding service, since it's only for sale on Hobby Stock.</br>  <br>The crystal we see is just the transformation device, not the relic itself. Maybe the armed gear is in fact a physical manifestation of the relic.</br>  <br> Genjuuro in a speedo <br>We need more of this</br></br>  <br>adopt chris</br>  <br>Both at the same time</br>  Why does everyone suspect poor innocent Garie?  <br>lesbians who adopt or get guy's cum in their system aren't real lesbians.<br>lesbians that use dildos aren't real lesbians.<br>my statement is absolute</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's rotten.</br>  <br>Does she ship Ogawa and Genjuuro?</br>  <br><br>Somebody screenshot this to post it when it inevitably turns out to be true.</br></br>  <br> Rebirth-day only uploaded in 320k <br> G-Beat + Little Miracle still only have 320k uploads <br>Did the koreans forget how to rip in lossless or something</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maria's Gungnir was made from fragments Ryoko stole while she was working with FIS. It's nothing to do with Kanade's except being made from the same relic.</br></br>  <br>Cause she's a psychotic Cunt who looks as trustworthy as a hungry shark?</br>  The keyword doesn't actually say Garie transfers memories between homunculi. It isn't necessarily true.  Reminder that IRC is now targeting Symphogear threads since the latest sales numbers. The OP is a prime example, as well as the same bait arguments they made during Hibike threads.  <br> because same-sex couples can't adopt in Japan <br>Is that true? They should move to a more developed planet.</br></br>  <br>OP's not bait though, someone posted it shortly before the last thread 404'd<br>The retarded arguments are all probably bait though</br></br>  <br>Told you those sales thread are cancer and should be banned.</br>  <br>Regardless, when an obviously untrustworthy character has memory manipulation / stealing abilities for no obvious narrative reason, it's pretty much inevitable that someone is going to find out that their past is a lie and they're being manipulated.</br>  Bikki is cute! CUTE!  <br>Miku pls<br>You're right though</br></br>  <br>Because they're racist against ballerinas.</br>  unyon actually being Miku would explain a lot.  <br> muh placebo </br>  Is it wrong to fall in love with an automated doll?  <br>Because she has shark teeth.</br>  <br>That's like saying you can't be with your waifu.<br>Oh wait</br></br>  <br>If it's wrong I don't want to be right.</br>  Everything about this makes my heart all fluffy  <br><br>You can't even tell the fucking difference between lossless and lossy MP3 audio if you don't have ridiculously expensive headphones.</br></br>  <br>Not really, just remember that the only way to fuck her is basically like rubbing you dick on a bear trap.</br>  <br>If it weren't so wrong, it wouldn't feel nearly so right.</br>  <br>  Fine (if she somehow returns) <br>  alchemy <br><br>I don't think Fine could use alchemy, considering it's vastly superior tech compared to relics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good thing I have some ridiculously expensive headphones. Got some pretty damn nice speakers as well.<br><br><br>Get better speakers/headphones, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  Why do you guys have such good taste?  <br>I want to see more SoL scenes with Chris and DMJii. I know the current plot situation doesn't allow for it, but it'd be nice.</br>  <br>Elfnein would make the most sense anyway.</br>  <br>In b4 an otaku makes a 1:1 version her in RL, except with fuckholes</br>  <br>Then buy your own CD faggot.</br>  <br><br>Remember the Gears are just a toy Fine made. She cooked up Kadingir without anyone noticing, I think it's fair to say that ancient tech is pretty impressive. If they still had Fine around it'd be a fair fight.</br></br>  <br>Cause i  prefer her sister </br>  <br>She was on Earth whenever something important and powerful was going on, she had her time to learn alchemy.</br>  <br>That's acceptable too.<br><br>To be honest, Yellow is the only bad one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Impregnate Miku.</br></br>  <br>why you do this /a/non</br>  <br><br>I really hope the last episode or two are SoL shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>We're all dolls here. Why do you think we spend so much time shitposting about how garbage Hibiki is?</br>  <br><br> Carol befriended in episode 9 <br> Rest of the show is Zesshoushinai <br><br>Fund it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Yellow is the coolest</br>  <br>There should be a law requiring all shows to have at least one episode of epilogue.<br><br><br>More like Carol befriended in episode 9, Garie's plan thwarted in episode 10, SoL shenanigans begiGARIE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikugear was shit <br><br>Fuck of irishman.</br></br></br>  <br>They could have a breather episode while they fix shit and repair gears and/or cook up a new batch of LiNKER (does anyone at S.O.N.G. even know how to do that? Or was it only Ryoko and Ver?), and have DMJii and Chris at school.</br>  <br>These are all retardedly adorable.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the development this season is going to be overcoming LiNKER thanks to finding their own reason to fight, not making more of it.</br>  <br> the current plot situation doesn't allow for it <br>Chris and DMJii are still going to school. There's still room for one more SoL scene to help hammer the senpai/kouhai character arc. It just can't be too upbeat because Bikki being dead will probably keep everybody's moods at bay.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone will be feeling like taking a proper relaxing breather while Hibiki is in her current state.</br>  <br> I need to justify spending thousands of dollars on audio equipment by pretending I can actually hear a difference between 320kbps and lossless <br><br>Your dog might be able to distinguish between them without knowing which is which ahead of time.

I don't care what the story says, Dark Oblivion will always make me think otherwise.</br></br>  <br>I would literally speed play until I unlock Kanade then main her.</br>  <br>Oh I'd only have the main 6 available at first in their default gears, but by secret characters I meant the kind who's slots don't even appear on the roster until you unlock them whereas the other unlockable would be greyed out.</br>  <br>I want to see Maria and Tsubasa have a date like that SoL in S1E9.</br>  <br>Easy, just make them even more lost that they end up in some backwater town in Wales.</br>  <br> Main Gungnir Maria until I get Kanade <br><br>Only way to play. We Rushdown now.</br></br></br>  read the guide buyfag.moe  Reminder: No Togou scale and life isn't worth living.  I'm still disappointed that there were no other Rin scales announce at Wonfest. The aniplex one has a dumb looking face.  Wonfest was nothing but boatsluts and mikushits  <br>at least there was one good figure.</br>    Aren't you glad the USD and Euro are strong against the Yen? <br><br>It almost converts the price 1:1 and makes shipping free.</br></br>  <br>Maybe one day they might make a Ginko figure too</br>  <br>I wish I had a better job and more disposable income to really take advantage of this.</br>    When does the Rin Hoshizora fan book ver. fig come out?<br>amiami.com/top/detail/detail?scode=<wbr>FIGURE-011054<br>its late july already fug</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I can't wait to clean her with  my q-tip </br></br>  Best MF sculptor is now making swords. <br> I like it. </br>  <br>best boy too, hopefully it's not too boring</br>  <br>I'm still mad that even this little shit is getting a scale and Imanotsurugi gets nothing.</br>   payment request for IA/VT Colorful <br>It's finally happening.</br>  Really Aquamarine? That's the shittiest base I've seen.  <br>You should see football Pochaco's base.<br><br>It looks like someone just cut a piece of MDF and used that. Basically the only flaw with an otherwise 10/10 figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Making good bases is a rarely practised art. Some of the large, gorgeous figs are a let down because the characters are just standing on a round piece of plastic.</br>  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually tempted to buy a One Piece figure<br>at least this set is cheap</br>  <br>Do people actually like this art style? I've always thought it just looked shitty.</br>  <br>I never thought it looked good on figures, but this one looks cute as fuck</br>  <br> Trying this hard to fit in <br>You forgot swords and idols.</br></br>  <br>reminder she was in sm brothel around the age shown on your picture</br>  <br>You do know you're supposed to take that off right.<br>It's actually a mirror base.</br></br>  <br>I still can't fathom what the maker thought when he decided on those colors.</br>  <br>I didn't, but that's good.</br>  <br>Pochaco has the prefect fatty body that you just want to fuck, unfortunately her baby face ruines it.</br>  <br>He thought "I'm going to repaint it all white with my cum".</br>  <br>if you like pochacho you've already got shit taste so might as well have shit taste in colours</br>  <br> even better </br>  <br>what the hell is that</br>  <br>1/60 Koto Arbalest's announcement makes the entire event.</br>  <br>That shit is nothing compared to Ayesha's plain white base.</br>  <br>Plain white is fine. It's not interesting but it's not actively offensive either.</br>  It sucks when you get a figure that can 99.99% stand up by itself and then they give it a HUGE base instead of just putting a little base on each foot which would stabilise it and take up significantly less room.  <br>Figures look a hell of a lot nicer with a base than without.</br>  So, did they show anything related to pic related during wonfes?  Is there a gallery I can go too that will show me everything from Wonfest?  Lewd.  <br>I just want clear bases and across all lines. This is the most practical solution. the decorative shit just detracts from the figure.</br>  <br>BEAT's Tamamo? Unfortunately, nothing.</br>  How stupid am I for wanting this? She's a 1/3 scale doll. Shipping will be stupid expensive.  <br>Sometimes unique bases can be great, but I also like the uniformity that clear bases can give across a collection.</br>  <br> 1GBP = 192.89 JPY <br>What a time to be alive.</br></br>  <br>To me that looks like crap. The bottom of the dress looks ratty and hangs in a weird way. Just way for the RAH version. I'm sure that will happen and look a thousand times better.</br>  <br>Between that diamond Miku and this, it's like they're not trying with poses anymore.<br><br>Can you even curl 3 toes without curling the first 2?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope nothing new on that and I've been on the usual twatter tags for it the last few days.<br>But I don't have big hopes for it to be shown anytime soon tbh.<br>FLARE did enough for me!<br>And I'm curious how Broccoli will handle her Goth lolita costume. Too bad there are no better pictures of the prototype though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. I'd never even thought about the curled toes, that's actually pretty much impossible to do.</br>  How are you supposed to display figures that don't have stands?  <br>Have you looked at the pricetag?<br><br>Azone's other homu doll looks kinda sorta acceptable, but not really great either.<br><br>But that just looks like shit. And that's in a promo picture. In real life they often look worse to some degree.<br>Specifically the jagged fringes of her half-skirt look bad.<br><br><br><br>I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The people whose arms get cut off/deformed and then learn to use their feet like hands probably can.</br>  <br>I love this Yuuki.</br>  <br> I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially. <br>I hadn't thought of that. Though now I'm wondering if I can train my toes to do the vulcan salute.<br><br><br>That's disturbing, but a valid point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile on Paypal:<br><br> 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY </br></br></br>  <br>I think this is impossible to recreate as shown. I remember vaguely someone telling that it has something to do with the way the tendons are attached. I think the feet look weird but not unacceptable but its obviously pandering to a certain demographic.</br>  <br>Like figures that are laying? Just put them on the shelf, or on something soft on the shelf.</br>  <br>for that purpose<br>I'm not afraid to pay AmiAmi with my shitty visa classic, and my bank's rates are tons better.</br></br>  <br>Attach magnets to their feet.</br>  <br>Nah, standing up. Just doesn't have a stand.</br>  anybody have her yet?  <br>too puffy. no thong.</br>  <br>Just checked wikipedia. Looks like the small toes mostly move as a group although the little toe can move somewhat independently.<br><br>Let's conclude miku is not human.</br></br></br>  When she's up to pre-order tell me  <br>I think she'll go great with Misa, but I'm begging for a  cast-on .</br>  <br> FREEing <br>I'll be keeping my money</br></br>  <br>thats why I didnt pre-order it, but its takane so I really wanna know how it turned out</br>  <br> thong <br>disgusting</br></br>  <br> I'm glad I'm not the only one. </br>  <br>I like how they conveniently leave out the angle with her disgusting lumpy stomach.</br>  <br>That's the reason why review blogs exist.</br>  Where can I get a rotating base like the ones reviewers use to take photos of figures?  <br> tfw canadian </br>  <br>Well thanks to my country's economy failing it's now 3 to 1, but somehow I still have to get all those plastic butts</br>  <br>What country?</br>  <br>Same as Noodles, Malaysia</br>  Enjoy the twenty-eighth of July.  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  Has anyone here used suruga-ya.jp?<br><br>It's got an obscure book I want but seems kind of shifty</br></br>  <br>They sometimes are a bit slow but otherwise good.<br>Oh, and they didn't include a preorder CD once even though it was listed.</br></br>  <br>The picture actually made me laugh. Thanks, you too.</br>  Where's my fucking Feito, Alter?    <br> shifty <br>Nah, they're fine. Don't expect perfect books though, even if they don't mention any damage.</br></br>    <br>So I should go with the second linked book then?<br><br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185135613001<br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185025353001<br><br>They're the same book but the fact that they're mentioning damage in the first one might mean that it's really bad</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  THREE MORE WEEKS  <br>If they can balance on their own you can just put them on a shelf like any other figure. The downside is that they won't be as stable.</br>  <br>Is FREEing really that bad? From some of the reviews I've seen they weren't so bad.</br>  <br><br>I've just had her shipped RSAL from Amiami, pretty hype, her hair seems like it would be brittle as fuck though.</br></br>  <br>It can't be as bad as Racing Miku 2011's can it?</br>  <br>Yes, avoid Rank B items in general. With that price difference I'm guessing there's some really visible damage. The second listing might not be perfect, but it at least shouldn't have tears or stains.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>   store exclusives are still a thing   <br>Their 1/8s can be pretty subpar for the price. Their 1/4s often look great.</br>  I remember an anon use too post pictures of Magician Miku every thread hoping a figure would be made of her. I guess he gave up hope.  <br> memegenerator </br>  <br>Will we ever see more BRS figs?

Economically speaking, what would happen if Greece is bombed? Would it be that bad?</br></br>  <br>Unless you modify the settings, Paypal automatically uses its own shitty conversion rate rather than the interbank exchange rate.<br><br>For example 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY whereas the interbank exchange rate is 1 GBP = 192.92 JPY. Exchanging £100 under Paypal's rates would cost you £4.50 compared to if you had exchanged under the interbank rate.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it a little early for europoors to be up?</br>  <br> 6pm <br> Early </br></br>  <br>Half 6/half 7 in the afternoon?<br><br>Yeah mate.</br></br></br>  <br>PayPal's rates are always at least 2.5% behind the current rate, sometimes more since they update just twice a day.<br><br>If you use a card through them you can change it to use your bank's exchange rate. Otherwise you're stuck with PayPal's rate.</br></br></br>  <br>The value of the Euro would decrease even further meaning plastic butts would become even more expensive than they already are.<br><br>The only good thing is that if they bomb hard enough we might EVENTUALLY stop pouring down billions of tax money into their shitty country.<br><br><br>How can I sleep when my country is falling apart around me thanks the the EU?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope.

And the cherry on top of the shit sundae is that huge fucking seam right across that fucking painted tree stump they call a torso just looks awful, of course they covered it with that claw grip stand before so you couldn't see it.<br>Yes she has decently cute smiling expressions but this is just unacceptable at 7,400 yen, her terrible torso complete ruins it, how the fuck could they just make her body a stick with no navel?<br>I might still buy it because fuck it, but I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure that's not the nendoroid.<br>She's available for preorder tomorrow if you're interested, please support my waifu in any way you can, but I'm not expecting you to buy this injustice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, we are undervalued 20% <br><br>20%? Are you shitting me?<br><br>We used to get between 1,6 and 1,7 USD per Euro.

The only one that got the face right.</br>  <br>The RAH looks better but her clothes look like a 3 star diner napkin.</br>  I hope to God the autoscorers get a figma or something. Preferably Leiur  <br>pls halp</br>  <br> You generally do the inspection yourself if they demand it. <br>Why do they even want inspections in person anyway? I've received packages resealed with german customs tape, so they clearly open them themselves anyway.</br></br>  <br>elbow and ankle joints look like shit. and the napkin is part of the shittyness.<br><br>really, hestia only works when her clothing is skin-tight and shows off curves.

So why do we let teenagers come here to discuss self insert power fantasies about being the strongest dude ever and getting all the girls?<br><br> No one who has graduated high school could seriously like trash like Overlord or Re:Monster, right? Especially with all the video game shit sprinkled throughout a lot of these series.</br></br>  <br>With no offense meant to be made, you are forgetting about people with legitimate mental disorders. Also, I think people hit 18 before they graduate from high school, right?</br>  <br>Stop discussing your self-insert fantasy stories<br>Instead discuss my self-insert fantasy stories</br></br>  /a/ is full of manchildren.<br><br>They also discuss series like Nisekoi, Date a Live and Infinite Stratos.<br><br>There are people here that find cliche harem antics "fun".</br></br></br></br>  I have no idea why you thought this merited a metathread anon, but if you must now, i selfinsert as the little girl.<br>Now please take your retarded complain to the retarded selfinsert shows you so hate so that they won't dirty the board any further.</br>  I wonder why 4chan has no filter which recognizes whether the person sitting in front of the monitor at home is 18 or not.  <br>You're right, I'm being very insensitive towards people with learning disabilities. I feel a bit bad now.</br>  <br>Why do you think /a/ still discusses shounen?</br>  Yes my Good Sir, you tell these cretinous imbeciles. Fun is for boys, pretensciousness is for men.  <br>I'm 30 and I like Overlord.</br>  <br>I'm so sorry.</br>  <br>Problem Children didn't have anybody for me to self-insert myself into. Fuck that anime.</br>  If I like mlp that makes me a little grill?<br><br>Noice</br></br>  GOD DAMN IT PEOPLE!<br>I TOLD YOU A 1000 TIMES TO CLOSE THAT DOOR!<br>YOU ARE LETTING ALL THE HIPSTERS IN!<br><br>Sigh, time to go get the Raid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what to search for to find this.</br>  <br>S-sauce?  Please. </br>  <br> No one who has graduated high school could seriously like trash like Overlord <br>Why the fuck not? overlord? Skeletor sama isn't op. So far its just equivalent of a 100lvl guy fighting a 50 lvl ones in rpg. its normal that he'll be killing them all with one move... <br>Its not Sao where a 50 lvl guy is fighting a 50 lvl floor boss all by himself going rambo mode and killing him without a problem.</br></br></br>  <br><br>case in point</br></br>  /a/ talks about naruto again<br/>  <br><br>Re:Monster</br></br>  <br>I require source!</br>  What the fuck happened? One moment the show is a lighthearted childish comedy and the next it's a full blown harem. They even have the loli onboard. I can't stop cringing. I expected romance, but this... Is this a common occurrence in the genre (  having every single female loving the idiot mc  )? I've only recently started watching slice-of-life. What is this shit?  Best girl  <br>It's Trigger doing Haremshit after blowing all their money on KLK.</br>  <br> LN trash <br> not full blown harem <br><br><br>You. I like you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best girl <br><br>is right here </br></br></br>  <br>You don't understand? Awful show, it's just retarded fanservice.</br>  <br>It's a harem, you idiot, not slice of life.</br>   slice of life <br><br>I don't think that means what you think it means.<br><br>Inou is a young adult LN series, and the majority of those include, but are not limited to the following<br><br> developing powers as a metaphor for growing up <br> highschool setting <br> forced drama <br> a harem <br><br>For something to be a SoL, it only has to focus on bland everyday activities and interactions of inoffensive characters without an overarching plot.<br><br>There is nothing SoL-like about Inou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My nendo of best girl finally arrived.  <br><br><br><br>wish I knew this earlier. now i'm in to deep. I have to finish it. I'm dying .</br></br></br></br>  <br>My hatoko prize is almost here</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  Season 2 never.    Those retarded answer not thinking OP is just a bait to start Hatoko/ Tomoyo shitposting   <br>See what? Worst normalfag girl?</br>  <br>did not know that. thanks.<br><br><br>i think it would have been better if i was.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't go too far with that shit taste, okay anon? That's a firm dame.</br>  Is it really that cringey ?  <br>Fix yours first.</br>  Is this your 10th anime, OP?  <br>Seems more like first or second.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>You really don't would be best to just add it to the dropped pile. It's not worth finishing.</br>  Surprisingly decent for a battle harem LN adaptation, honestly. Got me to laugh quite a few times.<br>That rant scene was GOAT.</br>  <br>But the rant scene was all it has. The rest are just harem shanenigans with the side dish of false promise of battle shounen.</br>  <br>That's why I said decent. It wasn't a "good anime" by all means but it was pretty enjoyable.<br>I'd easily watch a S2 if there was one.</br></br>  <br>Blame the source material for that.<br>Trigger did a pretty great job with what they were given.</br></br>  <br><br>No not thenth. I'm not gonna pretend i'm on par with you faggots but its a lot more than 10.<br><br><br>Yes. Don't touch it.<br><br><br>I don't drop shows. Except stuff like naruto and bleach when i was younger. That shit just went on and on and on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tumblr gif <br> 3dpd <br> I'm dying . <br><br>Well, let's hope that you really are dying. If not simply kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. <br><br>Tomoyo a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What's your favorite anime, OP?</br>  <br>I don't have one. Do you? Recommend me.</br>  <br>Fair enough. Have you finished it? Also if you haven't go and watch based Keima in his quest to just play video games.</br>  <br>Tell me what anime you like then.</br>  <br>first season of darker than black, mirai nikki, tokyo ghoul, attack on titan, welcome to the NHK was good but the book was kinda boring, currently enjoying spice and wolf. Oh yeah haruhi recently was fun.<br><br>Is that enough for you to form an insult to my taste? I can go on.<br><br><br>Are you tricking me , coz i feel like you are tricking me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even. Give it a try.</br>  Inobato was... not what I was expecting when I picked it up because of the rant.<br><br>Saori Hayami is still awesome though. Though no way can I say I'm a Hatokofag.</br></br>  <br> mirai nikki, tokyo ghoul, attack on titan <br>I can pretty much guess the rest from these, no need.<br>Its pretty obvious you haven't watched much anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Everybodies' worship of that rant was the main (only) reason I gave it a go. I should really stop doing that.</br>  <br> the rant <br>Literally the only good part of the show. The rest was pure shit.</br></br>  <br><br><br>There's nothing wrong with not having watched a lot of anime, anon</br></br></br>  The only bad thing in the series is episode 8.  <br>Well that response was predictable. Tell me some of your favorites. I won't even judge. I'm honestly interested in what people like that come on here with the sole purpose of judging other peoples likes.</br>  <br>People typically tell you the show itself isn't good when the rant is mentioned/praised.</br>  <br>Master of Martial Hearts<br>Mars of Destruction<br>Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven</br></br></br>  <br>Patrish taste</br>  <br>I was a little too optimistic.</br>  <br><br>But the rant, while true, was Hatoko going full rage with her jealousy. I thought Jurai would have done something shittier for her to yell like that.</br></br>  Hatoko a best girl.  <br>Haven't heard of those. I might check them out. Maybe one day, if i eat all my vegetables and watch all my animes, I'll be as wise and knowledgeable about anime as you.</br>  <br>Cookie wins the loli anyway, don't worry.</br>  <br>Can't tell if you realize he's trolling or not but I'm just going to tell you now because I'm not an ass.</br>  <br>Nah I knew he was baiting from <br>but everyone deserves some attention sometimes. Especially if they need it so bad.</br></br>  <br>my nigger</br>  <br>Well anyways you should try watching Chihayafuru. To expand on your genres and because it's one of my favorites.</br>  <br>You're right that does look a lot different than the stuff i'm used to. Thanks</br>  <br> recommending anime for adult women </br>  This is now a Chihayafuru thread.    <br>You clearly haven't seen it.</br>  This entire thread, holy shit.<br> mirai nikki <br> snk <br> tokyo ghoul <br><br>Back in the day newfags at least had the decency to watch some anime before posting on /a/, nowadays every kid who's seen 3 edgy shounenshits lurks on this board. moooooooot<br><br> s-summer is just a meme guys </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> did not know that <br>Note that the anon you're replying to doesn't seem to like SoL, and uses not very praising words for it.<br>Harem is generally much worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to make her a mother.</br>  <br>Well, the way they defeated the body thief with MCs shitty self-harming power was pretty ok, too.</br>  <br>bitch pls, even the fujoshit was better than the normalfag</br>  Allright now, the thread is just about the thread. I'm out. Feel free to post about your waifus and general hate for strangers over the internet. cheers.  <br>Maybe you should lurk before posting next time, newfriend.</br>  <br>Not sure if baiting or if you're a somewhat more casual animu watcher. But since this are shows that tend to trigger people here, I'm suspicious.<br>Whatever.</br></br>  <br> This entire thread, holy shit. <br> This entire thread <br> entire thread <br> entire <br><br>I only see one post mentioning the shows you've mentioned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Confess, what are you looking at, anon?  <br>There's nothing to look at here other than their faces because they look bad.</br>  <br>This thread was created by someone, who's never seen any harem before Inou Battle. He's just as new as this faggot I quoted.</br>  <br>Why won't you at least lurk for few hours before posting? Fucking newfags I swear to god.</br>  <br>Why is watching harems a standard requirement? That's retarded.</br>  <br> few hours <br>That's not nearly enough I think.<br>Well, ok, I didn't lurk either back then, but at first I only posted in  Bleach and One Piece threads , which were and are somewhat low-risk for newfags.</br></br></br>  For someone that is supposed to be lewd, her reaction on that scene was a bit surprising.  <br>Why do I get the feeling that Kajou is actually a virgin?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts.</br>  <br> flipped to Western order </br>  <br>Why the hell would she not be, you genius? Nothing even tries to imply she's ever been that close to anyone. The only way Kajo's not a virgin would be if she was raped as a child.</br>  <br>Don't bullshit anon. Anna clearly isn't a slut. Learn to use the dictionary. It does wonders to your English comprehension.</br>  Post your most painful "Season 2 Never"  <br>New OVA soon. I still hope for a S2.<br><br>Pic related for actual S2 never.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there even enough source material for one?</br>  <br>tfw no more magic hour</br>  Honest question for people who disliked Locodol: are you fans of the idol genre?    Rei or Asuka?  <br> One of the traits is her coming back from, what for any normal person would be, fatal injuries <br>This is universally true for every single person in Evangelion due to it's ending where everyone is killed and brought back to life. Including the main character, who was also reduced to a liquid and brought back to life.<br><br> When people observe that, she becomes almost something outside of personhood <br>She becomes something more, it is apt to say. What happens to Rei leaves a profound, deep impression as well as her reaction and thoughts about it.<br><br>Given that you explain that she is portrayed with personhood, we must conclude that she is portrayed with personhood, and if there's something beyond that portrayal, then she's something more not something less.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same thing applies to Asuka twice as much.</br>   Sex with Rei <br>Jerks you off the entire time and catches your cum in a tissue, that she promptly throws out.<br> Sex with Asuka <br>Pretends to be experienced in bed, but really has no idea what she's doing. Will probably start to shake when you whip it out. Normally dominant Asuka turns into a scared little sub.<br> Sex with Shinji <br>Admittedly doesn't know much about sex but is incredibly open to influence. He refuses to say no, his boundaries are as endless as you want them to be.<br> Sex with Kaworu <br>Startlingly foreign. You've likely never felt sensations like the ones Kaworu provides. This, however, is offset by the fact that it's still gay as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Buttmad Reifags.  <br>I think more than person hood a poor way to describe since the traits she also shows with being Lilith don't add to her personhood so to say. I think it would be more applicable to say outside of personhood. Since it is something distinctly not human or like a person. It does add to her character as a whole, but not necessarily her "human" side. I am being very semantic about this, but I think it is important when it comes to a character as intricate and subtle as Rei.</br>  Cheeki breeki sexy.  <br> better transfer to japan where the age of consent is 12 then </br>  so I heard someone say that the gothic axegirl in this series has a completely different and worse design compared to the source material. as someone who got mad boners over the manga version of maoyuu and hated the anime version, that does sound very upsetting, but this one looks fine to me, I guess. what exactly is wrong about her? seems boner-inducing enough.  <br>because you might prefer flashy appearances over normal ones.<br><br>not that i have any problem with it, i like both of rory's appearances</br></br></br>  <br>13</br>  I don't even know what old rory looked like and I can say for certain that she looked like shit. New design is pure sex.  ITT shit that pisses you off in anime<br> Please take responsibility </br>  <br> You aren't the target audience, so it's okay to do retarded shit </br>  <br> Bleach <br> Ga-Rei <br> Youkai Shoujo - Monsuga <br><br>It's one of those things that keep popping up in short descriptions. It's one of the only cliches I really hate with a passion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I knew someone who would get drunk from a single glass of wine.</br>  Why do nips eat the same trash over and over? Is shit an acquired taste? Can't fucking wait until the target audience changes/dies but that isn't happening anytime soon.   yuri show, in a setting that has no single male character, not even in the fucking background </blockquote>]
