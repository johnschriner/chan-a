[ Season 3 when?   JC Staff <br>Hopefully never.</br>  <br>It's been five years, so we're approaching the "never ever" horizon.</br>  <br> Implying JC Staff aren't the Goat </br>  <br>Never and it's going to stay that way since it's garbage.</br>  <br>Railgun aired in 2013.</br>  daily reminder that half of railgun is fanfic of index created by some fat japanese nerd living in jc staffs basement  <br>Why does misaka look hella cute in this?</br>  <br>Fuck off secondary scum.</br>  Raildex is ded.  <br>And?<br>Prisma Illya is literally fanfiction, and it's still better than the actual source.</br></br>  <br>Because she's cute.</br>  <br>Misaka always looks hella cute.</br>  <br>Index is Cuter tbh</br>  <br>She's always cute, you dingus.</br>  <br>Index is neither cute nor sexually attractive. Worst girl.</br>  <br>Not him but she looks okay out of that dumb nun's robe. And someday she's going to be damn beautiful. See Laura.</br>  <br>She looks better in the anime than the manga/LN.</br>  To Aru was pretty popular 6 years ago, but it gets old really fast. I didn't bother finish the whole series after Railgun anime aired. OP were god-tier though.  <br><br>I watched up to episode 10 and thought it was boring. Should I have called it there or do I need to revisit?</br></br>  <br>Watch season 2 only.</br>  <br>It's funny because Touma has gotten sexually aroused by Index, unlike Mikoto.</br>  <br>Keep watching, the first arc of Railgun S is good.<br>The rest is crap.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Touma's annoying eighty percent of the time, so it's not surprising he has shit taste.</br>  <br>Well your objectively wrong.</br>  <br>I know the thread's for Railgun, but just to check - you mean of Railgun, right, not Index?</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br> talking about shit taste <br> ironically liking a character who is literally feces colored </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Back to  you go.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br> 3DPD <br>WRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Enjoy your ban.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>I-I'm c-confused</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Ahahahahaahahahaaha<br>now kill yourself</br></br>  <br>You mixed up your memes there, buddy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Thanks for killing my boner</br>  <br>Reminder gunha got trashed like the bitch he is.</br>  <br>Even I could beat him up.</br>  <br>What were those ribbons sprouting from Gunha's back?</br>  <br>Yea, I watched 10 episodes of the first season of railgun.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>God, humans are fucking disgusting.</br>  <br>Those are his wings.</br>  <br>Before Index 3.</br>  <br>Wasn't it confirmed to be after Index 3 though?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Index 3 never.  ;_; </br>  My body is ready.  <br>To get BTFO?</br>  <br>Hopefully never, the manga is all I need. Did like the openings though.</br>  <br>These are my wings.</br>  Apparently prologue is out, I can't read nip so I don't know if my expectations are being manipulated.  http://dengekibunko.dengeki.com/new<wbr>releases/978-4-04-865244-5/</wbr>  <br>Bro route or Nuit. Either way, Mikoto will get it best.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127654925 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  Am I the only one who likes Saten the most?  <br>never fellow biribiribro never, is better this way</br>  <br>Can just spam the studio? I just want ww3 to be animated.</br>  <br>Isn't WW3 Index?</br>  <br>That's an odd-looking bike.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127655042 <br>Fuck off Nagi.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127655042 <br>that one is not MisakaÂ´s vagina this one is</br>  <br>So's this one</br>   3DPD shit <br><br>Looks like THK found a new way to reverse troll.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't this suppoused to be Released in July??</br>  <br>The Railgun anime adaptation is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen. Which is disappointing, because the manga is great. <br><br>All of the characters feel so hollow in the anime adaptation compared to the manga, they made the main cast into keion-tier husks. Saten took it especially hard when she's one of the best characters in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking this too. He ran out of girls to hate on.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127655124 <br>Oh boy, wonder how long this'll last.</br>  <br/>  <br>saten a shit</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127655124 <br>Trying to nuke the thread, huh?</br>  <br>Ye isn't this a Index thread?</br>  <br>Railgun not Raildex?</br>  <br>either is fine</br>  How do you think Misaka feels knowing her clones are cuter than she is?  <br>I think it's an Ingun thread.</br>  <br><br>Stop being retarded with your THK boogeyman and look at the deleted pots. It's fucking Nagi.</br></br>  Hey guys is there a way I can download the last few light novels Baka Tsuki isn't working for me.  <br>arr rook same</br>  <br>That's a damn fine :^) face she's got there.</br>  <br>What does her skin feels like? Would it cause static when I rub her with certain materials?</br>  <br>So many permutations</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127655504 <br>Can you fuck go to </br>  <br>It would feel fluffy and soft.</br>  <br> THK <br> Nagi <br> boogeyman <br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> cuter <br>They aren't. Only LO is because she is a loli.</br></br>  <br>No it's because of that ahoge.</br>  <br> They aren't <br><br>But they are. The dull eyes do wonders to an otherwise plain and boring design.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Touma always have that, "Durr, what the fuck is going on?" look on his face in screenshots when he's doing something with a girl other than punching her face in?</br>  <br>Railgun is more popular than index and makes more cash.</br>  <br>Only the first season was. Index II sold more than Railgun S.</br>    <br>bumping</br>  <br> The Railgun anime adaptation is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.  <br><br>You really haven't seen much anime have you? <br><br>Season 2 was great if you stopped watching after episode 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, give me more of both, but I prefer Index even with all the annoying magic shenanigans because I want more WW3.</br>  <br><br>Soon.<br><br>JC Staff is a great studio that won't let us down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's impossible now since the mediafire folder is also gone. Time to give it up anon, Ingun is garbage anyway.</br>  <br>They should have never changed the eyes.</br>  <br> questionable characters doing questionable things <br>Oh well, at least my favourite character didn't feed another favourite character of mine their own leg this time.</br></br>  <br>Most of those shows are literally shit on there. I like the shows they are adapting currently though.</br>  <br>All trash except for Azumanga.</br>  <br>I don't know how they gonna animate all the retarded shit that happened in the last third of OT.</br>  <br>Changing viewpoints every 15 minutes? Golden hands? I'm sure it won't be too bad unelss they decide to slideshow everything.</br>  <br>That helps too.<br><br><br>Mikoto's design is simple and plain, but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth. But also important is her fierce and..sparky personality that creates a bold contrast. On top of that, she generally acts cuter and childish, which enhances the moe-ness she produces. Her clones look her like aside from eyes and panties, but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. LO is an exception mainly for being a loli, and is even more childish in various ways that burst with endearment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to admit.<br><br>On some level, I am kind of wondering what kind of canon assassination Season 3 of Railgun will bring to the table.<br><br>I'm assuming a Railgun S3 would be like the first two, with the first half being a serviceable to stellar adaptation of a canon arc (I'm thinking Liberal Arts City), and the second cour will be Nagai's playground.<br><br>So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wake me up when they finally make an accel anime.  <br>Does Accel even appear in the Railgun manga other than the Sister's Arc?</br>    <br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>Time travel arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Added to my backlog.</br>  <br>He does get prodded by a Daihasei rep to advertise, but because said rep brought up the Sisters project, he ate a brick.</br>  <br>I think he's learned his lesson already</br>  <br>Index PSP did time meddling. Please no.</br>  <br> but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth <br>But she looks best when she's not in her base design.</br></br>  <br>Oh hello there, I was thinking that you'd never show up in an actual thread.</br>   There are people in AC who don't know Accel   <br>The first question, the oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.</br>  I loved Railgun but I am 10 episodes into Index and I am just not feeling it. Half of each episode is Touma yelling into a really bright light while holding his hand up and they never even developed a relationship between him and Index before shit started exploding. Touma has no motivation beyond "lol me so awesome save cute girl!" And all the pseudo-church babbling and HAHAMAGIC nonsense just feels cheap and stupid.<br><br>Or is Index a masterpeace and I am a tasteless faggot?</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Only reason to watch either show is for biri biri but she can only do so much by herself.<br><br> I prefer railgul </br></br></br>  <br>No, it is not. Railgun is much better.</br>  <br> but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. <br>And that makes their moments of childishness all that much more adorable.</br></br>  <br>Index II is a lot better, except for a few awful magic arcs.</br>  <br>Mikoto has worn many outfits. I would say her best is that tomboy outfit, the white dress she wore for the violin play, and the winter school uniform.</br>  <br>Where were you when they were all splattered dead on the floor?</br>  <br>Yeah you have to wait until NT4 to get the barest minimum of Touma development.<br><br>At all. And after  alternate universe genocide the subsequent effects are barely mentioned again.  </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br><br>MODS<br>O<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Touma is still a very boring MC.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's depressing. At least he isn't unbearable, though.</br>  <br>Now I really want a literal taste of Misaka too</br>  Shirou &gt;Touma.  <br>Accelerator confirmed Misaka doesn't taste that good.</br>  <br>Thinking "FUCK YOU /A/ YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS CUTE GIRLS SOLVING CRIMES."<br><br>You can call me an idiot for watching a series without knowing anything about it but I was not expecting that at all.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br>How many times do I have to report this guy?</br>  <br>Why did he chew on her fingers? Nigga is disgusting. Someone should snitch to LO.</br>  <br><br><br> eating Mikasa raw <br>The reason the Accelerator hated it was because the food was improperly prepared.</br></br></br></br>  Her vagina is pretty popular.  <br><br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>First half of S2 was Misaka trying to save girls from cruel experiments from the dark side, leaving her friends behind and falling into depression to be saved by Touma. Then the second half was Nagai doing the same arc but with power of friendship saving the day<br><br><br>If the first half of S3 is Daihaseisai, where Mikoto and a level 5 team up to fight against a crazy scientist who's objective is experimenting with them, going crazy and finally being saved by Touma; then the second half will be Nagai having Mikoto team up with a super special snowflake level 4 girl who's almost a level 5 (pretty much every other level 5 doesn't give a shit, Gunha doesn't look like Nagai's style and Misaki again would be too much) to fight another crazy scientist who wants to experiment with them, Misaka going crazy but this time is saved by a friendship speech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what LO is actually for, making him sedated enough to not go out of the plan</br>  <br><br><br>Alright who is this fag?</br></br></br>  <br>That pose is way hot.</br>  <br> Implying accel even eats good meat </br>  <br><br>The problem is, you go to Index for the worldbuilding. Touma himself is literally a blank slate and after a while you realize the harem stuff is a mere footnote played for laughs.<br><br>Since the anime has to cut down on tons of exposition you end up missing a lot of stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, it turns harem? Fuck that.</br>  <br> look at me I think everything is lame fuck you mom </br>  Only good male character in Index.  <br>Indeed. And as a further bit of note...<br><br>Don't expect any concrete, lasting romantic development of any kind in this series. Some of /a/'s most virulent shitposters started out as people who made the mistake of latching on to a "ship" in Raildex.</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right? Hamazura is the original cuck.</br>  <br>Kakine 2 and Accel aren't too shabby.</br>  <br> Beetle good </br>  <br> to be saved by Touma <br>I hated that crap. I knew the whole time how it would end and it spoiled a good story. Misaka is doing great as the MC only to become a useless crybaby wreck waiting for the big strong man to swoop in and solve all her problems for her. <br><br>I was almost hoping they would make Railgun a parallel universe asspull so they could change that arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Index has a pretty shit adaptation that only gets decent once index's novels start getting good (around the end parts of season 2)</br>  <br>You must be a special kind of retard. You cite volume 5 as your source where he explicitly gets sexually aroused by Mikoto as she's helping him with his homework.</br>  <br> Shit taste </br>  <br> Telling other people they have shit taste when you're clearly the one with really bad taste </br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br> Index has a pretty shit adaptation <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>You missed the entire point of that arc. I bet you're also mad about Touma having to save her in Daihasei as well. You sound just like the idiots who get butt flustered every time she helps/saves Touma in the main novels.</br>    <br>Remove your faggot shipper goggles. He just got nervous because Mikoto was getting close. Nothing sexually explicit unlike getting turned on by Index's legs and natural aroma.</br>  <br>When Accel spammer  returns to us.</br>  <br>Telling the truth here.</br>  I prefer Index.<br>Magic &gt; Science<br>fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Will the new season cover this chapter?</br>  <br>No, since there will never ever be another season.</br>  Reminder that Touma was unable to punch biribiri. Thus she must be the Chosen One.  <br>It must have been fun seeing your favourite character spammed everywhere to everyone else's butthurt.</br>  <br>You don't know that.</br>  <br>But that's right. Citing an old post listing all the fuck ups of the second season.<br><br> Vol 7 - Sheol Fear, downplaying the strength of the nuns, removing the special way Agnese talks, downplaying Touma's entrance into the church. The only thing that didn't have any problems there was the last episode. <br><br> Vol 8 - removing the talk between Touma and Kuroko, removing Mikoto's ladde, removing LO revealing to Accelerator that she regained her memories, removing the scene were Mikoto knocks out Awaki's companions, the berserk Awaki scene didn't have disfigured appliances, making Awaki crash into a wall instead of a metal net fence, removing the scene where Accelerator yells at her while falling to the darkness of the ground (they made him say his speech while he was walking away), etc. <br><br> Vol 9-10 - Removing Himegami's monologue while she was down, shortening both games, QUALITY everywhere, more QUALITY, QUALITY fights, downplaying Touma's injuries and the way he figured out Oriana's attack patterns, downplaying Laura and Aleister's tense interactions, spell auras that make Touma look like an idiot, etc. The only thing they got right here is the Lidvia scene at the end. Oriana fight would have been good if they didn't have such QUALITY flashbacks. <br><br> Vol 11 - The entire 3rd ep. Rushed as fuck, and once again Touma's injuries were removed. They also didn't even hint at the long history between Venice and the RCC, and the nature of the guardian fleet and why it can't be dispelled by IB was not explained or even hinted at. Vento's scene with Matthai Reece was also shortened. <br><br> Vol 12 - My only complaint was that they skipped the scene between Touma, Tsuchimikado, Aogami and LO. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chosen for what?<br>His dick?</br></br>  <br>I do, I know everything.</br>  <br>Touma is the fucking MC of the universe though, and it makes perfect sense that he has to save her. Besides, Gunha and Touma vs Mikoto was great.</br>  <br> Vol 13 - First ep was rushed as fuck. Vento's attacks were also nerfed as fuck, the building she and Touma were fighting in had almost no people and it wasn't even close to collapsing. The Hound Dog's first encounter with Vento were also changed, making it hard to realize what was making everyone unconscious and removed one of Kihara's character traits. The Hound Dog massacre was not suspenseful enough, and it didn't highlight the fact that Accelerator was not in esper mode that whole time. They also skipped the conversation with the driver (removing characterization for the Hound Dogs) and shortened the conversation with Doc Frog, downplaying his experience, skills and importance. Second episode, Index's scene with the SISTERS was skipped, and also the way Index found out it was Kazakiri. Building toss was a joke, and the the wings didn't look like wings where you can see a clear division at the middle. Ahegao could have been better, and they skipped the hints that tell how Kazakiri was still fighting back against the control of the virus. 3rd ep, Vento's entire character motivation and the reason why she's using Divine Punishment in the first place was skipped, Touma didn't punch her nose, they didn't explain what the scales did, they fucked up the positioning in Kihara's office, they removed all the explanations that connect what the virus in LO is doing to Kazakiri to the Golden Dawn's method of creating an angel, and they didn't make the phone call scene as awesome as this. And then for the epilogue, they complete skipped Aleister's past, his plans regarding Accelerator, LO and Kazakiri, and Doc Frog being the co-founder of AC. The first scene there could also have been put in the place of the previous episode's ED. Then, they completely removed the open declaration of hostilities between the RCC and AC. I'm sure there's more that I didn't mention. </br>  Electric twin dragon biribiri attack fuking when?  <br>Beyond that: She punched him when he wasn't living his life correctly.</br>  <br>When you kill yourself</br>  <br><br>I want to adopt a clone Misaka<br><br>They're adorable, pic related.<br><br><br>because Touma is a shit character 90% of the time. Actually the only times he's tolerable is in Railgun.<br><br><br>index is just shit, don't worry about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't just save her, he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes and make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless. He solve in a few hours something Misaka spent days agonizing over. It cheapened everything.</br>  <br>I wonder why Accel didn't just partly nerf the effect that gravity had him, fly slightly to the right, borrow a building and introduce Kihara's face to a flaming building.</br>  <br> make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless <br>But it was pointless. Mikoto is useless as fuck.<br><br>No. She can't go against AC. She can't win against AC. She can't try to shoulder everything on her own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The death of accel-spammer marked the end of times when we had based mods.</br>  <br> he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes <br><br>the entire point of that arc was for biribiri to stop being such a fucking mary sue and to start relying on others. That 'few minutes' was the climax of that character development. He basically forced her to ask for his help. The plot of accelerator murdering the clones is just window dressing for the real point of railgun: misaka doing cute shit and generally being adorable. That plotline is continued in the next arc of railgun S, and that also ends in like 5 minutes with misaka and her hideously overpowered friends shutting down the science faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto was fucking useless in the sisters arc though, without Touma she was just going to die. Accelerator could beat her in his sleep, literally.</br>  <br>You actually watch Nagaispace bullshit? Her friends are useless as well other than Kuroko, and even she is far out of her own league most of the time.</br>  <br> hideously overpowered friends <br>Baseball bats are so OP.</br></br>  Othinus a shit. <br>Accel a best.</br>  <br>But she didn't even ask for his help, he basically said "You sit here while I go save everyone."</br>  <br>Othinus a best.<br>Frenda a shit.</br></br>  <br>She was the reason the team managed to stop mecha-bitch.<br><br>They'd all be dead if not for her.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what he is up to now.</br>  <br>Science side is hideously underpowered with the exception of Accel and Rensa. Dunno why the author favourites the magic side so much unless it's for the Deus Ex Machina that quite literally appears from thin air.</br>  <br>Sasuga Nagai's waifu.</br>  <br>Heard he got a degree in something and got a real job.</br>  <br>Sucks dude.</br>  <br>Having money is nice.</br>  <br>Yeah I thought it was OK.<br><br><br>Well I didn't mean all of her friends, Uiharu's power is RETARDED. I mean, keeping things warm? What the fuck? Couldn't it have at least been to grow flowers out of her forehead? that would have made sense. And saten is also relatively useless in a fight except in deus ex machina situations.<br><br>But I was referring to snake girl and kuroko, who are each OP as fuck. <br><br>Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. "Oh shit I teleported a window pane INTO YOUR FUCKING NECK". Also her army of clones is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JC Staff already said Raildun S3 won't happen until after Index III.</br>  <br>Sure, but think of the time he could be using to shitpost instead of working.</br>  <br>But only if you can obtain it with PLEASURING OLD MEN</br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. <br> no vectors involved <br><br>I had exactly the same thought after watching it. But could she be convinced to kill someone that easily?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't understand Touma character too well.<br><br>Also, Misaka is shit in this regard, she shouldn't be saving herself in those positions as well. She is incapable of doing so, she doesn't have the power or connections to do so</br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. <br>No, she can't.<br><br> Her teleportation isn't instantaneous movement. It's hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors. If teleportation were instantaneous and vectorless, Awaki and Kill Point wouldn't have gotten their asses kicked.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko, Onee-sama will wash your back if you kill the mean man for her <br><br>it's not like she's easily manipulated or anything.... she just wants  senpai to notice her </br></br></br>  Someone should really just nuke AC.  <br>It doesn't work that way....</br>  <br>He can shitpost at work, just not as a mod.</br>  For a long running series with a bunch of ability users, there aren't that many good fights.  <br> hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors <br><br>sure but if accelerator were able to interact with hyperdimensional vectors, he would be teleporting shit all over the place. He doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Accel can manipulate vectors, but he can't do shit like tping everywhere. His powers aren't capable of that</br>  <br> which does have vectors <br>Not within this universe which is where Accelerator lives and where his power has control. He shouldn't be able to manipulate teleported objects unless his power includes extra dimensional reach.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wouldn't be able to do it if he actually tried to.<br>Accelerator has pretty much infinite potential.</br></br>  <br>Manipulating vectors implies that he can manipulate movements - disassemble/reassemble atoms into components because electrons/neutrons/protons all have specific movements.</br>  <br> Not within this universe <br>In the indexverse, everything has vectors. The cunt could probably time travel if he got exposed to the 'vectors' for time</br></br>  <br>The author outright stated that Accelerator could reflect teleported attacks, or at least the 12th-dimensional movement that comprises Academy City esper teleportation. True vectorless teleportation is the domain of magic side powerhouses like Fiamma.</br>  <br>Almost everything in our universe has vectors too and in any case even cheaty shit like magic would have the person at least on some level producing bioelectric signals deciding where they are going to end up.</br>  <br>Within that extra dimension it does, but as far as our existence is concerned the objects don't travel anywhere, they simply arrive.<br><br>At least it should work that way, muh OPness demands Accelerator be unstoppable after all.</br></br></br>  <br>But when you think about it, it's kinda silly that the objects don't 'travel anywhere' and merely 'arrive' because the information for the object composition and memories or any other biological blueprint must have come from somewhere. <br><br>It's silly to make a character so OP in such a way that the use of the character's powers could exceed the bounds of the writer's imagination. <br><br>Index would be better as all science or all magic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a literal fucking retard <br>Read the LN's.</br></br>   these espers trying to fight motherfucking Accelerator   <br>Accel reflection works as a whitelist not a blacklist, he doesn't have to know how things works to reflect them.<br>He explicitly said he can reflect things moving through the 11th dimension, which is how teleportation works, while thinking about Musujime Awaki.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded because his reflection shield exists in the same dimensions that he does so unless he is a 11th-dimensional being it should never interact with anything traveling in the 11th dimension (which is the basic principle that allows esper teleportation to work in the first place)."<br><br>But I agree that I can't refute shitty writing, the writer has final say and I am wrong.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Artist starting to put some effort <br> Edgy kids shitting their pants as they get blown the fuck out by the edgemaster <br><br>This manga finally got fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a 11th dimensional being, but apparently his power works on more than just the physical dimension, during his first fight with Kakine he propagated his vectors through the ream of God or something like that to hit him for example.<br>But I agree, Accel power is pretty bullshit.</br></br>  <br> try to be edgy as shit <br> the edgiest fucker in raildex pops his head in just to scare them straight <br>nice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The absolute undisputed king of edge.</br></br>  <br>The undisputed king of Edgy Large Ham.</br>  <br>S2. Watch for Sisters Arc. Be happy. Do whatever you want from there. The rest of the series is pretty meh if you don't like it already.</br>  <br>I don't know, when you kill over a hundred clones I think you're just a serial killer. Edgy is more when you can't back it up, or you put on a trenchcoat and not the same shirt pugsly from the adams family wear.</br>  <br>Read the manga, the anime is a disgrace in comparison.</br>  <br>Well Accel is quite literally Shadow the  h Edgehog who hasn't lost Maria.</br>  <br>I want to violate Saten.</br>  <br> Asphyxiation is my fetish. </br>  <br>proof that touma could kill biribiri</br>  <br>That's only because MIkoto allowed him to.<br><br>I wonder if it's her fetish.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot, reminder that this scene was replaced by Nagai with a Saten scene in the anime.</br>  <br>You have no idea how dimensions work. You don't "travel in the 11th dimension". You travel in 11-dimensional space.<br><br>You have no idea how teleporters work. Teleporters aren't "11-dimensional beings". They are just 3D beings capable of warping space to allow for movement in higher dimensions (through 11-dimensional space).<br><br>There's no shitty writing. There's just you being an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They already tried and failed.</br>  <br>You don't really understand how higher-dimensional movement works. Go look up flatland.</br>  <br>everything JC staff touches turns to shit, Just like DEEN</br>  <br>But DEEN has done some good stuff.</br>  <br>One good episode of 23 totally shitty journey, it's not worth it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657070 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657835 <br>Kill yourself, pathetic cunt.</br></br>  <br>That was just one example, DEEN did Samurai X:Trust and Betrayal.</br>  <br>anon. you only like it cause its more lewd than the others</br>  <br>Franchises like Samurai X and Fate can handle on their own since they already had their established fan base before they where adapted by Deen, doesn't matter how much Deen fucked them up, same goes for Index and JC really fucked up the second season and with the railgun fillers.</br>  <br>DEEN didn't fuck up Samurai X though, it was a masterpiece.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-<wbr>ballistic_missile</wbr></br>  <br>This anon is correct. I was  shocked  at how much better the manga was compared to the anime, outside of the Sisters arc. Before I read that I didn't think that a consistently great Raildex product was even possible.<br><br> No I have not read the LNs. I'm sorry, I'll get to it. </br></br></br>  <br> Samurai X:Trust and Betrayal. <br>they fucked up the series though, but even the mangaka fucked up the manga so it kinda deserved it.<br><br>What can I say, 90's Deen was ok, it's 2000 deen what shat everything they adapted<br> Rave Master <br> Inital D <br> Get Backers <br> Higurashi quality fest <br> Vampire Knight <br> Fate series and Movie <br> Umineko adaptation <br><br><br>The only things they "touched" was because it wasn't produced or completely animated by them, like Cowboy bebop movie or Toradora.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should warn you that the first half a dozen LNs have wonky translations. <br><br>Don't know how good the Yen Press releases are.</br></br></br>  <br>Saten needs to eventually join Anti-Skill and at least get a gun or something.</br>  <br>Meh, Nasufags got a based ufotable adaptation because DEEN did such a terrible job. <br><br>We're stuck with JC Staff, for better or worse, if Index III ever gets made.</br></br></br>  ARRRGGGHHH KANZAKI HELP ME, NOTHING IS HAPPENING  <br> To aru franchise needs to have a more whiny fan base then.  They're doing it right since they're getting a lot of spin off too, it's just a matter of time IMO. I think Kamachi.exe is just waiting for the rights on JC staff expire so they can give it to another studio, much like what Nasu did with Fate after UBW movie.</br>  <br>Rights expiration? When is that going to happen?<br><br>Nasu has his own company so he can do shit like that. kamachi.exe has to listen to Miki and his overlords at ASCII.</br></br></br>  <br>i thought accelerator had a boner from the thumbnail</br>  <br>When are you even going to get relevant again?</br>  Jesus Christ the manga is so uninteresting these days. I have reached a point where I just want a S3, I don't care if JC Staff makes it, I'll still watch it.  What's up with the mediafire folder? I was trying to check for the newest chapter of Railgun but it said the folder was switched to private.  <br>ded, just like Raildex.<br> Wasn't the NT13 prologue supposed to come out already? </br></br>  <br><br>Can't Someone who has all the epubs upload to embedupload or mirrorcreator?<br><br> Or Mega.nz </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  <br> danmachi <br> not shana <br>What is wrong with this chart?</br></br></br>  <br>After index S3<br>Which will be after Heavy Object S3</br></br>   still no nt13 preview and spoilers or fake spoilers <br>Sheit nigga</br>  <br>YES HE'S BACK</br>  Post cute doki doki inducing Mikoto-Touma fanworks.  <br>it's funny how it works<br><br> overrated series <br> main character is utter garbage gary stu <br> he gets sidelined in a spinoff that doesn't take itself too seriously <br> it becomes watchable </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127670249 <br>LEWD</br>  <br>Official works.</br>  Chapter 78 when?<br><br>Also, where?</br></br>  I want to punch Othinus in her fat ugly ugly face and burn her hat.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127670249 <br>Choke yourself to death, pathetic bich.</br>  Stiyl and Misha hunting vampires spinoff when?<br>Beetle and Gunha Superhero spinoff when?<br>Young Crowley Spinoff when?<br>Casual Vento when?</br></br></br>  railgun anime &gt; rest of the chuuni bullshit  <br>A vampire would slaughter Stiyl and Misha. <br><br>It's probably safe to assume that anyone who isn't at least Saint class stands no chance against a vampire.</br></br></br>  <br>Othinus getting raped by a pack of wild tyrones and enjoying it like a slut she is when?</br>  <br>Already happened in the Nigger world.<br>Touma got raped to death too.</br></br>  <br>What if Mikoto came to help?<br>She can beat Saints.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Mikotofag and I know you're trolling here.

Why can't you just post the translations on /a/?</br></br>  <br><br>Sure. Make a petition to Yen saying "Please stop trying to make money off Oregairu". We'll see how it goes.</br></br>  <br>Why not jump on to reddit's subreddit for yahari (not talking about fucking /r/anime) and translate it from there. Mods there seem like ok guys.<br><br>obviously &gt;reddit it has a comment section and is rather more accessable. Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there.</br></br></br>  It will never be as fun as before.<br><br>I'm just wasting my time here.</br></br>  The next Yahari thread will die before the bump limit.  Yo Ho, all together,<br>Hoist the replies high<br>Heave Ho, cunts and killers<br>Never shall we die.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year, one every 3 months for all their licenses and it doesn't seem like they will be increasing pace any time soon. I'd prefer it one every 2 months so 6 volumes per year. <br><br>They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. As authors releases like 2 volumes max per year in Japan. <br><br>So:<br> 2017 to get to volume 4 <br> 2018 to get to volume 8 <br> 2019 to get to volume 12 <br><br>Though within 4 years you can easily learn enough nippon to read anything you like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have began the thread with the announcement of Yen Press license for Oregairu.</br>  <br> Yen Press releases 4 volumes per year <br><br>This applies to manga too right?</br></br></br>  The Yen Press release is only step one.<br>How long until we get an English dub?</br>  <br> Cease &amp; desist 's wont matter there. <br>It does, if reddit admins receive C&amp;D they will warn you and or shut down your sub if you don't comply. It's in their ToS.</br></br>  <br> They probably want to pace themselves so they don't catch up too quickly and become stuck with no consistent releases throughout the year. <br>Then Yen Press should take into consideration adapting the .5 volumes, also.</br></br>  <br>Yes, sometimes it even 5 volumes per year for them.</br>  <br>What news? haven't visited Yahari threads for few days.</br>  <br>Yen Press is killing yahari</br>  Good Irohasu~, everyone!  <br>LN got licensed, Sypro will receive C&amp;D from Yen Press if he keeps his translations up into next year, if he doesn't comply Yen Press will shut his site down. They can do this and did this to DanMachi translator when he wouldn't give in.<br><br>So Spyro will now have to remove his translations off the blog eventually and go underground or we are stuck until 2019 to be able to read the rest of the story.<br><br>Not to mention Yen Press is going to localise Iroha's "Senpai's" and other horrifics to Mr/Miss/Mister/Mrs.<br><br>It's a sad day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally look at the last thread, it hasn't even died yet</br>  <br>Yukino's dependency issues and the club is not being genuine. They know there is a love triangle and they are too scared to confront it.</br>  <br> for few days <br><br>so close</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not upload pdfs on nyaa?</br></br>  <br> I can earnestly type that we may not get to volume five. <br>Nah they'll keep going with this one, Yahari will sell well for them considering how well known the franchise is now amongst the community.</br></br>  <br>even when it's links to pastebins? still it might pass under the radar.<br><br>Or actually just fuck everything. I don't want to lose hope.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope ISIS will behead them.</br>  <br>There are various ways for translations to continue such as you've suggested, SAO's translation still continues to this day. It all depends on whether Spyro is willing to go underground or not, and so far he's just left a vague statement.</br>   spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br> anime says fuck you, buy the LN, leaving us in a cliffhanger. <br> watari is a hack writer, more drama, more waifu wars. <br> then jew press strike again; volume 11 in next decade, volume 12 will be history. <br> yahari fan translation is dead <br> tfw its raining outside, just like my tears falling down in my eyes. <br><br>FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK<br>Being a NEET in a third world shithole is suffering.<br>Thank you americunts for ruining anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fansubs are all underground, I don't see what's the big deal. It's not like he's translating for the e-peen right?</br></br>  <br>moderators<br> When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subreddits you moderate, you agree to remove it. <br>If Yen Press report it then they'll have to remove it. If they don't then it'll be fine, but Reddit threads quickly turn up on Google so doubt it'll go under the radar for long considering how on edge YP is about their stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> I still haven't read the fucking LN <br>Fuuuuuuuuuck</br></br>  <br> &gt;spyro feeling down because his ship is going to sunk <br>he's quitting because you guys kept saying this<br> fuck this gay earth spyro-sama don't leave us like this </br></br></br>  Spyro can just go dark, randomly show up with a pdf/epub of Vol 11, and go back into hiding. <br><br>Rinse/Repeat for Vol 12/13</br></br>  Whoa whoa whoa I've missed a lot. <br><br>So is Spyro quitting the translating?</br></br>  <br>Differences is that CR/Funi don't send out C&amp;D's and DMCA's like their life depends on it. They so far haven't gone out of their way to shut fansub groups and their websites down, however Yen Press will do this.<br>CR/Funi is even aware that HS steals from them and don't really do anything about it.</br></br>  <br>you could try learning jap<br><br>it's not hard</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/89<wbr>du4zd7n3hny/Oregairu<br>Quick.</br></wbr></br>  Here's where I draw the line.<br>Between this and being practically stuck with nothing but CR and Funi this season, I've lost it.<br><br>I'm learning Japanese.<br>Starting tomorrow.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah gonna start learning. maybe when Vol 12 comes out I can parse basic sentences when I get ahold of a copy</br></br></br>  Fuck jew press  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659766 <br>Yukino looked to 8man for help but 8man couldn't do anything and Haruno emphasized that</br>  <br> tfw I have japanese language manuals for dummies <br> tfw losing motivation to learn because of moonrunes. </br></br>  <br>Japan is weird, they literally treat every small difference in a product as individual licenses. This is why Yen Press doesn't always do digital releases since that's another set of red tape. Also why New Testament translations can carry on hassle free despite YP picking up the series.<br><br>The .5 are most require their own licenses as well which I don't think they got so I doubt they will be releasing them.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659766 <br>Yukino wanted Hikki help, Haruno said no, Yukimom invites Hikki to the party, he sees what she actually means and fucks off.</br>  Pretty much everything that YP has licensed ends up getting underground fan translations anyway. I panic every time this happens, and I'm just not going to do it this time. I'm sure Spyro or someone else will keep underground translations going here.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659766 <br>Yukino-chan wanted to have sex in public, but as an upstanding citizen and lady of high class, Haruno intervened.</br>  <br>Just visit the /djt/ learn your kana first before you start jumping into any books whatsoever.

There is an equal amount of translators that have just quit it altogether.</br>  I'm going to capture Senpai<br><br><br>Also, I've confirmed the typo in it as the author mentions it in the comments.<br><br> Where am I going to make Iroha TL's now, since I only use 4chan. I hope there will still be LN threads. </br></br></br></br></br>  Is it ever stated in the LN whether Hachiman is good at English?  <br>Well Oregairu translations basically boils down to Spyro so we'll see what he decides to do<br><br> YFW we wont even get S3/Movie/OVA to cover the remaining novels </br></br></br>  <br>DanMachi was kill<br>Spyro is the only dedicated uptodate translator, if he's gone we'll have nobody</br></br>  <br>No, his only good subject is Japanese.</br>  <br><br>He's good at history, too.<br><br>But I don't think any two subjects have ever been emphasized as strongpoints for him except for Japanese literature and history.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Am Yukinofag <br> Spyro may quit translating altogether <br> Possibly no animation for remaining novels <br><br>Fuck Yen Press.

She's ambivalently good.

I'm sure Spyro could do the same. Just throw out a google link in a yahari thread one day, then let the anons propagate it.</br></br></br>  <br>Shekels.<br>$$$$$</br></br>  <br>When he was in depression mode after StuCo arc he needed the symbolism to make genuine seem more significant</br>  <br>He's been drinking MAX since the start, he only drank BLACK when talking with sensei or when he was being a loner again.</br>  <br>Yen Press's target audience isn't people who post on 4chan. Its lonely girls in their young teens who hang out in the young adult sections of bookstores.</br>  <br>Shit, thanks for that. This kind of stuff should be a crime.</br>  <br>i diddn't even realize that. so MAX coffee is 8mans true character drink?</br>  <br><br>If Spyro quit his translation and they started with vol. 11, I'd probably buy it assuming vol 12 isn't the end and already out by then.<br><br>But I won't sit back and wait years for them to catch up to an already finished series we all know the ending to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Good Irohasu~<br>Also, on behalf of the Iroha ship I'd like to thank the Sakibro that colored this LN art of her.<br><br> Fan Art / 4komas <br>http://imgur.com/a/BrBGm#0<br><br> Official Art / Feel <br>http://imgur.com/a/o2CeK#0<br><br><br> "Senpai~" <br>Subtotal: 11<br><br> "senpai" <br>Subtotal: 34<br><br>Total: 45<br><br> "Are you making passes at me?..." <br>Total: 6 <br><br>(vol.10,5 OVA fucking when)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are the Sakifags and Irohafags so much more productive than other girls?</br>  <br>CUM</br>  <br>vol 10.5 is missing</br>  <br>So is ch1 vol11</br>  <br> Sakifags and Irohafags so much more productive than other girls <br> than other girls <br>Not even a Yukinofag but you forgot Spyro</br></br></br>  <br>what is his ship?</br>  <br>I thought Spyro was dead</br>  Why do people think Iroha has a chance?<br><br>She's only a bit above Saki, you know.</br></br>  <br>Yukinofag, like most of us original LNfags</br>  <br>Spyro hasn't been relevant for awhile and I wouldn't consider one person to be the majority of any girl's fanbase.</br>  <br>Spyro is Spyro, there's no need for comparisons.<br>I think he means that Irohabros and Sakifags seem to have the most productive fanbases overall.<br>Sakifags have that album, the guy that colors LN art and one translator, if I'm not mistaken.<br>Irohabros have translators, typesetters, album guy, nico video guy.<br>Yukinofags did have an album posted recently though. Yuifags gotta step up their game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, I thought all signs where pointing to Yukino end?</br>  <br>You took bait too seriously, Yukino ship didn't sink</br>  <br>In the anime yes, in the LN it's left everyone on equal footing only favoring Yukino just a bit because of her request and being her final arc.</br>  <br>Well It's not like an Irohafag would've picked it up till Vol9., but as we know Spyro was already Tl'ing.<br>And Sakifags, well she didn't get that much attention for a fanatic to take it up.<br>But I still think in the end it would've been Spyro to TL the novel even if no-one had picked it up til Vol.9</br></br></br>  So since there's really no such thing as fujo's in America, and everyone's reaction to her shipping would be considered homophobic in today's culture. Who wants to bet YP completely removes the character of Ebina from their translations?  <br>Basically took Yui all of Vol 11 to catch up to Yukino <br><br>Yuki in Vol 11 seems to reach lowest point in series but can only go up from here on out (her request and Oregairu being her story basically since Vol 6)</br></br></br>  <br>The ship that did truly sink is sailed by Irohafags.</br>  <br>Are going to start shitposting again?<br><br>Ok, then let me tell you something that triggers people.<br><br>Iroha is genuine</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, then let me tell you something that triggers Irohafags.<br><br>Iroha is not a main heroine, she's a side character.</br></br></br>  <br>Underground is the answer, captain.</br>  <br>No, I think what really trigger other is this<br>Iroha is a main heroine.</br></br>  <br>What part of Iroha is genuine exactly?<br>I don't mean it as an insult I mean what is her genuine?<br><br>For instance Yumiko's feelings for Hayato have been proven to be genuine as soon as she admitted that she has no problem going through whatever it takes to just be beside Hayato, she's willing to struggle for him.</br></br></br></br>  Well at least we got over the licensing stuff pretty fast. Back to shipper shitposting!  <br>Irohafags never fail to shit up a thread</br>  <br>They are busy downloading yahari stuffs.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do we keep spyro motivated to continue translating?<br> s-should we send him chocolate? </br></br>  <br>Not him, but I think her relationship with 8man is the most genuine out of all the girls. They understand each other pretty well and don't have any secrets or any walls put up. Aside from Hayama and his sister, Iroha is one of 8man's most genuine relationships.<br><br> Still not going to win though unless WW asspulls something .</br></br></br>  <br>Buy him Yukino merch.</br>  <br>If he come here for a vacation and swimming, I will give him a  hug .</br>  <br>Buy him Yukino chocolates.</br>  Anyone have pdf download link for vol 10.5?  this guy has everything except for that  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127658394 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127658597 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659068 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659630 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127659766 <br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like the characters and their interactions, but Hachiman and co. always speak in fucking riddles.    I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>https://drive.google.com/uc?export=<wbr>download&amp;id=0B_LG7-oLd3GkcmpIbUNqLV<wbr>RuMk0</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  Why are Yukino and Hiratsuka the only ones who look like actual brides?  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  I just finished this show and I have some questions.<br><br>Commie did a fine job in translating I believe, but half of the time I don't know what they are talking about, especially when 8man, Yui and Yukino are talking to each other. Also I don't understand some of Haruno's line. This is especially apparent in S2 episode 8. I'll list down some of it here.<br><br>I'll skip sensei's part since I get the general idea of what she's is talking about, though not the context behind.<br><br> You're being unfair, Yukinon. <br><br>What exactly that she did, that is unfair?<br><br> You bring that out right now? Talk about playing dirty. <br><br>Playing dirty? What did Yui bring out?<br><br> Hang on. That's not what I came to talk about. <br><br>So 8man knows what's up in that conversation, right? So why don't they spill the beans instead of beating around the bush? What exactly is happening? I seriously don't know anymore.<br><br> "Won't get it unless you say it out loud," huh <br><br>Exactly. Now I wanna know why they don't want to say it out loud. I hate people hiding around don't want to discuss, when there is obviously problem lying around, anime or not.<br><br> Sometimes people won't understand even you say it directly <br><br>Or something like that line from 8man. They didn't even try to discuss yet, and then he straight away jump to the conclusion that talking directly won't help. So hiding the problem really helps a lot, I see.<br><br>Every single line after this makes no sense since I don't know their underlying problem, I won't go and list it out. So lastly:<br><br> I want something genuine. <br><br>I know this is kind of a buzzword here, but again, what exactly does it mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why but I'm getting more and more annoyed every time I see her stupid fucking face.<br><br>I didn't mind her while watching the show, but now I'm starting to hate her.</br></br></br>  Why are we still doing waifu shipping?<br>It's already over.</br>  <br>Well, both of them are used to raising walls agaisnt people. 8man with his delusions and Iroha with her cute act, they just never really were comfortable around people. Hell, Iroha still gets bullied.<br>Once they met, for some reason they trusted the other to keep their distance but, also for some reason, neither did. Before they had realized it, they just grew fond of each other.<br>8man may complain about helping her and stuff, but he can't help himself but to just enjoy it. Their date is a prime example of this, 8man keeps going "I want to go home/is it over?" but deep down he was having fun the whole time.<br>Their relationship isn't forced or surrounded by a heavy aspect that tries to push them apart, and that is quite close to something genuine.</br></br></br></br>  Dumping newly typeset shit.<br><br>1/6</br></br>  <br>2/6</br>  <br>You just need a break from these threads.</br>  <br>3/6</br>  <br>4/6</br>  You guys do know that 8man won't choose any of the girl right? He doesn't see any of them as love interest.  <br>5/6</br>  <br>6/6</br>  <br><br>Please response. I cannot sleep like this.</br></br>  <br> Haha, of course he said no... <br> What was I expecting, I always do that to him <br> Then, maybe he was just... <br> I... I can... <br> No... would senpai joke about it? <br> He did say he wanted something genuine <br> I wasn't genuine to him <br> I lied to him <br> I'm just... <br> I'm just some fake, aren't I? <br> N... No, that's not it! <br> It wasn't love, just a crush! <br> A small crush! <br> J... just a small crush... <br> ... <br> Why does my chest hurt so much? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck trying to convince the rabid shipfags.</br>  <br>please stop</br>  <br>I can see 8man dating, but suddenly falling in love is dumb.</br>  <br><br> You're being unfair, Yukinon. <br>Yukino is being unfair because she's mad that Hikki couldn't understand that she wanted to be president.<br><br> You bring that out right now? Talk about playing dirty. <br>Bringing up the election.<br><br> Hang on. That's not what I came to talk about. <br>See above.<br><br> "Won't get it unless you say it out loud," huh <br>See above.<br><br> Sometimes people won't understand even you say it directly <br>See above.<br><br> I want something genuine. <br>No one knows, there's only a vague understanding of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's missing this line.<br> ãã®ãã¿ã¼ã³ããããããããã ã <br> Seems like that pattern is good already <br><br>Also, the 'rejection' is just after the staring part.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ãã®ãã¿ã¼ã³ããããããããã ã <br> Seems like that pattern is good already <br>Should be something more like<br> You can stop with that pattern already. <br>Or something similar.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are there pdfs of the translated novels?  <br>Reminds me of this webm of the Iroha train scene with modified subs.<br>http://a.uguu.se/lwhlpt.webm</br></br>  <br>Ah, you're right. That sounds a lot better and makes more sense.</br>  <br>So the "staring... creepy" is just one line, then the rejection follows suit? I thought it was just a full sentence.<br><br>Revising it in a bit, thanks for the heads up.</br></br></br>  <br>Look for the mega link in this thread.</br>  <br><br> Yukino is being unfair because she's mad that Hikki couldn't understand that she wanted to be president. <br><br>This sentence raise so many questions.<br><br>1. I thought Yukino was forced to be in the election?<br><br>2. If she want to be the president, there is nothing stopping her to do so. If you're talking about the club, she can just drag Yui and 8man into the student council, everything would be the same. Why is that not an option?<br><br>3. How is anything about that related to the word unfair?<br><br>4. What's done is done. Why is everyone crying over spilled milk? Even 8man is crying, that's so out of character if this is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/89<wbr>du4zd7n3hny/Oregairu<br><br>epub, just in case.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> So 8man knows what's up in that conversation, right? So why don't they spill the beans instead of beating around the bush?  <br>That was the whole point that the show was trying to make after the stuco elections. Their "conversations" were as superficial as hayama's clique. The thing that 8man and yukino despise the most is that superficiality. 8man, although reluctant, decided to have that superficiality because he didn't know how to act and because he didn't want to lose what he had (a friendship). <br>However, his whole genuine speech was him breaking away from that superficial relationship (beating around in order to find a genuine one. A relationship with no deceit and no falseness.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Yui and Yukino are closer to eachother than to 8man, therefore their feelings about eachother will ultimately win out against their feelings for 8man. They've also been set up to fail by Sensei.<br><br>Iroha's only meaningful connection with 8man, and the way her character is written fit unless she's meant to win.<br><br>Most people who argue that Iroha isn't going to win are simultaneously arguing that the writing is (and will be) bad. ("Iroha's development is a red herring to sell more volumes")</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So the "staring... creepy" is just one line, then the rejection follows suit? I thought it was just a full sentence. <br>Yeah. Staring part is on the left, then her legs cover the text, then on the right it's already the rejection. The 'sorry' is just below the staring part, on the left.<br><br>Thanks for your work, typesetter-kun.<br>Also, this anon's  translation for the final line is better than mine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Leave it without the "creepy" part since that isn't mentioned and I think it was a guess by the Tl'er as to what is behind it.<br>Your current typeset already does a good job of covering the sentence.<br>The staring sentence and the rejection are one line.</br></br></br>  <br> 1. I thought Yukino was forced to be in the election? <br>She was going to make Hayama run for president until Haruno told her she was being manipulative like her mother.<br> 2. If she want to be the president, there is nothing stopping her to do so. If you're talking about the club, she can just drag Yui and 8man into the student council, everything would be the same. Why is that not an option? <br>Same reason why 8man didn't act until Komachi told him to, both of them won't do what they want without having a reason to do it, doing it for themselves isn't justifiable in their eyes.<br> 3. How is anything about that related to the word unfair? <br>It just annoyed Yukino because she didn't want to talk about it.<br> 4. What's done is done. Why is everyone crying over spilled milk? Even 8man is crying, that's so out of character if this is true. <br>Read the LN or watch the talk with sensei on the birdge for this answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(*beating around the bush*) in order to find a genuine relationship.</br>  Kimoi~  ~Shaa<br><br>Anyone got the webm of that</br></br>  Yen Press getting stuff licensed has to be the worst news I've had all day.  <br> that awful feeling you get after looking at this image <br>It looks like they tied 8man down and are going to rape him</br></br>  <br> Hikki, don't go <br> don't turn your head, look at me, and just me <br> don't think about Yukinon <br> don't think about Komachi <br> don't think about anyone else <br> just for this moment <br> I know it's unfair, but please think only of me <br> I want you to tell me that you like me <br> please <br> just this once <br> just once is okay <br> ... <br> why can't you say it...? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So she actually not that keen on running as president herself, as Hayama would do too? (i.e. losing or winning the seat means nothing to her?)<br><br>Ok, this show is as close to real life conversation as an anime can get. Can you please tell me why people likes to beat around the bush, talking cryptic shit instead of opening up front? Come on, you want the problem to be solved too, right.? Then what's the point of hiding behind words nobody can understand? Sometimes I hope I can just smash the table and all the character just say out loud what's in their mind.</br></br></br></br>  <br> So she actually not that keen on running as president herself, as Hayama would do too? (i.e. losing or winning the seat means nothing to her?) <br>No, she did want to become president but was going to talk Hayama into running to fulfill the request, the reason Hayama didn't turn her down directly was just so she's show up with Yui at the end of the double date with Orimoto.</br></br>  <br>Reposting this one because it seems you missed it.<br><br> Senpaai <br><br> Let's go swimming together, senpaai. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> she did want to become president <br><br>Did she hold a grudge on 8man because she didn't become the president? If the answer is no, there is no point in bringing it out. Even if the topic was brought up, Yukino won't even be mad and there is no need for everyone to cry over a small thing like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Anyone else get soft while thinking of Iroha saying senpai~?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean, get hard?</br></br>  <br>I think you mean get hard af.<br>Softness only in the heart.</br></br>  <br> Yukino wanted to be president <br> like 8man, she can't do anything without an excuse <br> Iroha was her excuse to become president <br> 8man removed that excuse <br> there is no longer any reason for her to be president so she removed her self from the ballot <br> She thought he would understand that she wanted to be president after she told him that running for president was not because Haruno goaded her to do it </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spyro, you can always translate the Oregairu offline and upload it to google drive or dropbox as personal files, chapter wise.<br>You can give the link on /a/, Animesuki or whatever.<br>Please, Just don't leave it.</br></br>  <br><br>Soft as in limp.<br><br>Yahallo makes me hard<br>Kimoi~ makes me hard<br>Hikki~ makes me hard<br><br>Senpai~ makes me soft.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My heart melts,<br>but my pants get really tight all of a sudden.</br></br>  <br>Yukino dress sucks</br>  <br>Limp is only after some good session of furious fapping to her.<br><br>And then I wish I had a dakimakura of her to fall asleep on  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> there is no need for everyone to cry over a small thing like that <br><br>But then this season could be fun and they can't have that.</br></br></br>  <br>Hiratsuka &gt; Komachi &gt; Yui &gt; Yukino</br>  <br><br>Really?<br>I like her dress best, it fits her figure beautifully.</br></br></br>  <br> You will never be called Kimoi~ by a girl hopelessly in love with you </br>  How do we stop Komachi from being the cutest?  <br><br>Thanks for the explanation.

She also doesn't have a bright future in terms of career options so she'll likely be a stay at home mother. To top it all off she's also the most physical of all the girls.<br><br>Yukino is the smartest person in her school. I don't think teen pregnancies are part of her plans for the future, but she could probably finance it so who knows.<br><br>Iroha is a poorfag. That makes her the wild card. She's either desperate to not get stuck in the trap her parents did by having children early or she's going to act as they do and have children earlier than she should have.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cuntkiller?</br>  <br>Jojo content you say?</br>  <br><br>I want to go to japan just for the 100 yen shit.</br></br>  <br> probably wants children. <br>But does she want Hikki's kids?</br></br>  <br> Iroha is a poorfag. <br>Nicely meme'd.</br></br>  Their reactions are highly SYNERGISTIC.  <br>Yukino is blind though, so her career options are limited.</br>  Can he go back to calling them bitches again? This drama is too much.  <br>It is his fault they fell in love with him, he has to take responsibility.</br>  <br>Comeback 8man.</br>  <br> Yui has orange hair, <br><br>If you're color blind that is</br></br></br>  Post your ideas of saving and receiving Spyro's translations.<br><br>Spyro, don't leave us now.</br></br>  I don't get the last scene, why did 8man not let them solve the love triangle peacefully?<br> Yui: This way we can be friends and there will be no hurt feelings. <br> Yukino: It will be for the best <br> 8man: lol no, not genuine. Go get you heart broken over me while I pretend neither of you loves me <br><br>It was a shitty move by him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad he's lost his hatred for her now.</br>  <br>Help make advance VR tech so he can marry his waifu</br>    I don't think Yen licenses Oregairu is that much of a big deal. Spyro could stop translate it but surely another one will take it up.<br><br>Also it not take fucking 4 years to read LN, learn basic japanese (hiragana, katakana, grammar, 100 kanji or more) in 6 months then using Rikaichan/Peraperakun/zkanji to support you.</br></br>  <br>How did he know, who put trash on his bike?</br>  <br>Tobe-senpai</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>One way leads them to not suffer.

She doesn't love Hikki anymore, ep 13 proves that.</br>  <br>Didn't even notice the look on Sore Aru's face in that scene. Wonder what she was thinking as she saw all that.</br>  <br>1/2<br>Before the date<br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date. <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn balls, wondering if Senpai would like her scent and the color of her knitted sweater. <br> Sees a cute pair of high heel boots and realizes the difference in height between Senpai and her, but they are too pricy. <br> Tries them on and touches her lips while thinking âWearing these would make me easier to get on my tip toes and reach Senpaiâs lip-â and her face becomes red. <br> She buys them without taking the labels off, so she can return them later. <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br>Day of the date<br> Wakes up at 4 am to prepare herself for the date <br> Stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, youâre a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue. <br> Spends half an hour wondering about the length of her skirt <br> Realizes her knee socks had hole and uses her sewing kit to fix them <br> Puts a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Leaves home early and walks to the Chiba station carrying a sports bag <br> Arrives to the station early and her Senpai is already there. She is surprised and happy at the same time <br> Avoids being seen by him and goes to the Station to put her bag in a coin locker. Comes back to watch her Senpai waiting, takes an extra look at her notepad, "Things I want to know about Senpai today". <br> At 10:15 she decides to stop making him wait because itâs too cold </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She doesn't love Hikki anymore, ep 13 proves that. <br>Do explain. I'm not seeing it.</br></br>  <br>She does have a lot of idle time for someone so busy.</br>  <br>2/2<br>After the date<br> Goes to the station and gets her sports bag. Inside there are her normal clothes. <br> Changes her clothes in the toilet and heads to the shop to return the stuff she bought <br> She goes to the supermarket because of the 6pm sales and buys half-priced meat and veggies. <br> On her way back home, she sees a promotion of free phone calls between couples and her eyes glittered, but she realizes she doesnât have Senpaiâs number and gets depressed. <br> Back at home, she sits in the kotatsu right beside her mom because itâs too cold. Her mom serves her warm tea and she takes small sips while smiling from ear to ear <br> She chokes when her mom asks âSo, when will you introduce him to me?â </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't this missing all of Volume 11?</br>  <br>She was trying to stop all potential romance in the club as a way to show him she didn't love him anymore and not to pursue.</br>  <br>I forgot that 8man doesn't have Isshiki's phone number, even after the date. Hell, he doesn't even have Yukino's phone number yet, even after everything. Will he have to marry Yukino to get the first few digits?</br>  <br>What would Irohafags do if they found out that Iroha's mom knows all about 8man but not Hayama? Would denialfag still deny?</br>  <br>They aren't friends yet so he still doesn't have her number.<br>Makes me wonder how exactly they'd go about messaging or talking to each other like that, since the only way they stop their banter or conversations is when someone interrupts them.</br></br>  <br>It's probably something silly like both are waiting for the other to ask or something.<br>Besides learning each others numbers would just make Yukino's dependency worse right now</br></br>  <br>He has Yui's number right?<br><br>Yui ending confirmed!</br></br></br>  <br>we are losers too, we are watching a drama of high schoolers</br>  <br> Besides learning each others numbers would just make Yukino's dependency worse right now <br>Literally how? <br>Her calling him at 3AM to ask him pointless things  or making up excuses to talk to him. ?</br></br></br>    <br> Yukino calls 8man in the middle of the night <br> Nervously asks, "Um, this might not be a good time right now, but I need to talk to you about nee-san." <br> 8man_widened_eyes_despair.jpg </br></br></br>  Well fuck, I hope my japanese gets better soon, because this book is way to japanesey for me to read comfortably.  <br> She messages him late at night <br> 8man does the same thing girls did to him back in middleschool </br></br>  <br>    making up excuses to talk to him <br>I can see her mulling to do that for hours and never sending anything. Yukino would have jumped at the chance to know his number for a while now.</br></br>  How long until Spyro gets C&amp;D'd?  <br>That and Yukino always calling to ask him what to do whenever she gets into an awkward situation.<br> it would be cute as fuck though </br></br>  <br>Obvious Yui still loves him, if not more so after genuine 2.0. There would be no need for all this drama if she didn't.</br>  Is there a possibility that neither movie, OVA nor S3 will happen?<br><br>Also how many volume of LN left?</br></br>  <br>How many the editor wants.</br>  <br> Not to mention Yen Press is going to localise Iroha's "Senpai's" and other horrifics to Mr/Miss/Mister/Mrs. </br>  <br>Yen Press always localizes it's releases.</br>  <br>This is the look of resignation and saying good by to love.<br><br>This face isn't saying "this is the man I love. I am glad that it is him"</br></br></br>  <br>Just kill me now</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>secondary detected.<br><br>Haruno still in her first year in university. She also has a lot of kouhai in highschool, so what wrong with visit it often?</br></br></br>  <br>The only person who seems to remember her in highschool is Megurin.</br>  <br>Sensei still does</br>  <br>We know there will be at least 2 more volumes. Personally I think it will have 3 more.<br><br>But it really all depends on Watari, he could probably stretch it for more if he really wanted to.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but they actually said they'll leave honorifics in if necessary. -san, -kun etc. will probably go, but I doubt senpai won't be left in. Senpai's equivalent is not "Mr/Miss/Mister/Mrs." by any stretch of the imagination anyway.<br><br>Have you ever tried reading translated older, heavier Japanese literature?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking 2 volumes and 1 half volume really<br><br>As for the content of that half volume, who knows?</br></br></br>  <br>You got some bullshit classes to be going back to highschool to mess with kids. Not to mention all the shit her mother has her do for being a heir.</br>  <br><br>Take your meems back to /int/.</br></br>  <br> I forgot that 8man doesn't have Isshiki's phone number, <br><br>well Iroha has his phone number by now. I will be surprised if she won't call him in the v-day evening.</br></br></br>  <br>She has tears of happiness and a smile because 8man stopped her suggestion like she knew he would. None of all this going on in this episode is needed if she didn't love him anymore.</br>  <br>Why was she happy he stopped her suggestion?<br><br> None of all this going on in this episode is needed if she didn't love him anymore. <br>She needed a way to reject him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The suggestion she made was to try and wake up Yukino more than anything.<br><br>She still loves him but she was trying to push Hikki and Yukino together throughout the date.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait! We still don't know Yui's exact reaction was unless someone took a time to translate the last LN scene.</br>  <br>So was her giving him the cookies as a "thanks" somehow trying to show Yukino she had no feeling for 8man?</br>  <br><br>Yukino knows Yui has feelings towards 8man. By giving the cookies as a "thanks" only Yui shows to Yukino that she conceded her feelings in order for Yukino and 8man to get together.</br></br>  <br><br>The reason 8man doesn't have Isshiki's number is because she doesn't have a phone.</br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself, pathetic shitstain.</br></br>  <br>Except she does, rewatch episode 12 again.</br>  <br/>  <br>It was her mother's. She gives Iroha her cellphone when she goes to school to know if she is doing fine while she works long hours to be able to afford food.</br>  <br><br>That's incredibly cute</br></br>  <br>Is this real?<br><br>Or is this just a continuation of the poorfag theory.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino interpreted that as Yui and 8man having a tender moment so she concedes it. Yukino seemed to be in pain during the cookie part of the scene for some odd reason.</br>  <br>I'd say it's a school-issue StuCo phone. Look how plain it is.</br>  <br> they'll leave honorifics in if necessary <br> Onii-sama as Mr. Tatsuya <br><br>Keep believing that anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>phones are dirt cheap in japanese so I think they are just joking.</br>  <br> She still loves him <br>If she still loves him then why isn't she hurt or bothered by Yukinox8man?</br></br>  <br>Yukino is her best friend and she think 8man likes Yukino.<br>It still hurts her though.</br></br>  <br>Why is she so angry?</br>  <br>Because Yukino keeps ignoring romcom flags.</br>  Why was Haruno calling out the service club when they were having a nice time helping others make treats and making treats themselves? 8man got to enjoy it too. I don't see what they were doing was wrong. They weren't living a lie.  <br>Because Hikigaya wasn't fucking her sister.</br>  <br>Really? That seems dumb. We don't even know if Yukino would want that.</br>  <br>bait, right?</br>  <br>Haruno knows, why do you think she was trying to force reactions out of her?</br>  why don't we all just start writing fanfiction?   Waking up thinking BTBs are dead <br> BTB are still up <br> Yen press licenced Yahari <br> Spyro dropping the TL <br><br>Things can't get any worse, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She don't want to face her feeling. Actually her mind is a complete mess by that time, which is why she was almost coerced by Yui to follow Yui's own plan until 8man stopped her.</br></br>  <br>Haruno thinks Yukino likes 8man. Does she know that Yui likes him as well? If yes that would mean she is aware of the possible love triangle.<br><br><br>I don't know why she was calling them out like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is very aware of the love triangle which is why she's mad that they're pretending like nothing is there.</br>  <br>The should reposted whenever the denialfag comes.</br>  <br>Tripshits shitposting in those threads.</br>  <br>So Haruno is pissed off that her little sister and her best friend are in love with the same guy? That seems like an odd thing to be mad about.</br>  Ok, shipperfags, tell me: why are there Iroha x 8man ship?<br><br>Yui and Yukino I can understand, even if they don't spell it out, we kinda confirms that they have feelings for 8man. <br><br>On the other hand, did Iroha ever shows interest in 8man?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Regardless of whether or not there's evidence for a possible relationship between the two, the fact that she keeps misconstruing 8man's words as confessions and pick up lines is enough for people to latch onto.</br>  <br><br>fuck off with your bait already</br></br>  <br>I'd say read the LN but there are no translations for 11 so rewatch the episode where Yui and Hachiman meet Haruno at the festival, you'll have your answer there.</br>  <br><br>By other words you mean they are delusional?</br></br>  <br><br>There is very little evidence so the pro Irohax8man people tend to make up fanfiction and memes since they are delusional.<br><br><br>I don't know about him but I think they are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a theory, all the signs are there:<br><br>Vol 8 Ch 2<br> Her uniform looked slightly worn out and she was slightly squeezing the cuffs of her cardigan that was somewhat rugged. <br><br>Vol 9 Ch 9<br> With the issue of money finally becoming more realistic, the others in the student council looked at each other. And the one in that group with the most reluctant face was Isshiki. Good grief, this girl was reallyâ¦ <br><br>Vol 9 Ch 10<br> Amongst the numerous books that were given to Isshiki from Yukinoshita, the one she chose was called âThe Gift of the Magiâ <br>(Iroha chooses for Xmas event a story about a young married couple and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money from all the ones Yukino gave her)<br><br> I tried to throw the tinsels and ornaments away, but I was denied the chance because Isshiki suggested that they might come in handy again in the future.

She slowly turned her head towards me and her eyes were slightly cloudy. Right after, she murmured in a small voice, âThe expenses! The discount! The extra charges! Over the budget! The account expenditures!â and shook. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still doesn't explain why a love triangle would bother her.</br>  <br>It actually explains it all, she knows how it will end either way.</br>  <br>Happily ever after with the loser not being tremendously hurt and their relationships not being strained or changed?</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Wait Spyro is dropping the TL's?</br>   both club members love 8man, but believe he loves the other <br> ergo, they both feel their love is unrequited, that 8man loves someone else, and assume it's the other club member <br> ergo, both club members are convinced 8man loves someone other than themselves <br> If both are correct, 8man loves someone other than either club member <br> 8man loves Iroha </br></br></br></br>  Why is she the worst Working?  <br>Because annoying and intolerable?</br>  Because she wants you to notice her more.  <br>Disgusting.</br>  Because she's not actually working and only breaks stuff.  <br>Because she is an attention whore. <br>Like Inami though she at least does work.</br></br>  I really hope this season of Working doesn't have a lot of her.  itt samefags  <br> Aoi "a plate a day keeps the profits away" Yamada <br> working </br></br>  <br>Can't handle the truth anon?<br><br>This is what baffles me.

The next episode preview shows many events that happen in Battle of Gods, like Goku in a blue and white tracksuit on Kaio's world and Vegeta training against laser bots in the spaceship. The end of the episode with East Kaioshin and Old Kaioshin sensing Beerus also corresponds to the beginning of Battle of Gods.<br><br>This is not something that can act as a simple retcon to the movies.

Meanwhile on Team B  His butt looks so funny!    <br>why dont they just fuck already</br>  MEEEEEEN    <br>If Gildarts was at full power, I think that would be a pretty interesting fight.</br>  <br>Acnologia already kicked Gildarts ass in the past,</br>  <br><br>I hope that whore dies soon.</br></br>  Embarrassing  <br>Aaaand revenge never</br>  <br>"Oh my..."<br><br>She liked what she saw.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We already made the good guys our bitches but we have to let them go so they become strong through traini- friendship and kick our ass.</br></br>  <br>It is all the same to the mango-fruit god.</br>   reading Shokugeki no Souma minus the food   <br> get to make the entire main cast look like chumps <br> be a lackey <br> get obliterated by superior before main characters can get revenge <br><br>Thats not a bad deal honestly. Better than getting nakama punched. He punked the protags out and they never touched him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the mangaka of shokugeki an ex helper of mashima?</br>  <br>Oh my God! Is he going to be okay?</br>  What the fuck is with the power levels in this shit? Why isn't Fairy Tail over, Mashima has been fucking phoning it in for 400 chapters.    <br>Why do you keep coming back?<br>Exactly</br></br>  So basically, all this time there were wizards strong enough to even go against fucking Dragons or the top of Zeref Demons and they were doing NOTHING?   12 more besides Brandish <br> 11 silhouettes <br>So the last one could be either the Emperor, or the guy God Serena replaced.</br></br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>It worked for Gildartz, and he didn't have a whole other continent to himself (as far as we know).</br>  <br>Even if it seems like Mashima has the whole shit planned out since the beginning, nothing in this series makes sense. The latest timeskip has fucked all this even more.<br><br>I read it for the shipping and the nakama funtimes but holy shit never would I dream of reading this weekly for the story tension.</br></br></br>  Why is she so wide, /a/ ?  <br>As much as I love FT I agree with powerlevels being absolutely attrocious at making sense<br><br>We had fucking Zeref demons last arc that were basically second to E.N.D. and even the Spirit King himself at it</br></br></br>  <br>Why are people with teleport powers always so shit in this hentai ?</br>  <br> new waifu <br><br>You should kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>would have been better if she took one of Natsu's arms or legs. FT Team A's idiocy knows no bounds</br>  <br> / </br>  <br>To be fair in the current power level dragons are punking everyone but F.Rogue cause he somehow learned dragon taming.</br>  <br> Enemy induced stupidity <br>This is so fucking stupid. Warning Fairy Tail not to do anything instead of simply eliminating them. She had no problems killing off his subordinate, she could do the same to her "enemy". To fix all her problems she simply had to remove all of them instead of warning them.</br></br>   oh wow these new villains are SUPER powerful! it's off the charts just how powerful they are this time! how will fairy tail ever defeat them!   <br>And there are 12 of them!</br>  <br>Theres either 4, 5, 7, or 12 of them as usual.</br>    <br>It's even funnier when Natsu still wanted to fight while witnessing a person turned to nothing in a flick of a finger. Fairy Tail truly is induced with any kind of stupid</br>  <br>I don't know how Mashima does this, it's like every arc, he tops the last with his brilliant plot twists.</br>  <br>Oh dont worry about, for some strange/magical reason it wont work on him. But it couldnt be showed now because more chapters more jewcoins.</br>  <br> This is so fucking stupid. Warning Fairy Tail not to do anything instead of simply eliminating them. <br><br>It's pretty simple really Mashima is probably planning to have Natsu punch some Friendship into Brandish during the arc; and after having been filled with enough Nakamaness she'll turn traitor and allow FT to rescue Makarov. But, they'll fail to rescue Makarov and she'll be set up to be executed for treason along with the old man and then Natsu&amp;FT will go back to save the fuck outta her, punch the shit outta the main villain, and return with Makarov all after having pushed in the Empires shit.</br></br></br>  <br> implying they didn't during the timeskip when they were both working for the council </br>  <br>Probably, yeah.<br><br>Her power seems to be manipulating the physical dimensions of stuff, so she probably just shrunk him.</br></br></br>  Feels like all the enemies have grand scale magics on their sleeves. It's kind of stupid, sure, but I find it more stupid that the FT guys will obviously gain the same scale of power later on in future chapters.<br><br>If this isn't even the final arc I wonder what kind of shit Mashima will pull in the final arc.</br></br>  <br> Gajeel doesnt know its even her he is lying at <br> stupid gajjel  <br> ow by gajell <br><br>I know "when is he going to do hentai" is what everyone thinks when reading this but Mashima is puritan faggot and will never deliver.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see 3 more -g-r-i-l-s- semen demons there.</br>  <br>sometimes I ask myself why I just don't skip the arcs and read the fillers.<br><br>Also I'm I wrong or does Fairy Tail hold a record for baddies turned good just in time for the following arc? I think even Naruto doesn't even come close, maybe Bleach if you count what happened after the soulsociety arc.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how Zeref and Acnologia would directly fit into this, so barring some random ass shit going down there should be at least one more</br>  <br>Levy probably sucked a couple of dicks just to get her post in the council.</br>  <br>No, one of them is Diavolo.</br>  <br> This is so fucking stupid. Warning Fairy Tail not to do anything instead of simply eliminating them. <br><br>Or, you know, maybe she actually can't do shit and it was all lolillusions. Aren't you jumping to conclusions a little too easily?</br></br></br>  <br>His dick is probably thicker than her arms.</br>  <br>I think you overestimate Mashima. There is no way we would pull something more than strongest and defeated.</br>  <br><br>Brandish clearly isn't Natsu's matchup.</br></br>  Dropped this shit during the e.n.d ark, are lucy and natsu together?  Probably going to be something retarded like Brandish being the spy.  <br><br>You joke, but it's a real question when the powerlevels are still THIS lopsided after Natsu trained up to Gildartz-tier over a 1-year timeskip. Even friendship bullshit has limits. (i.e., not everyone can channel it equally, and you still run out of juice after 1-2 fights.)</br></br>  <br>Yes, they are nakama forever. Why are you asking ?</br>  <br>Enemy leaves cast alone for no reason:<br> WHY NOT JUST KILL THEM INSTEAD OF WARNING THEM <br>Enemy leaves cast alone for a good reason that was set up over multiple chapters:<br> THATS RETARDED </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she is the spy they were looking for.</br>  <br> does Fairy Tail hold a record for baddies turned good just in time for the following arc? <br>There's probably some other series that's just as bad, but yeah, alot of FT's arc villains do turn good by the end. But it's to expected at this point when the Main Villain is a good guy at heart himself.<br><br> Brandish clearly isn't Natsu's matchup. <br>Never said he was, just that he'll probably be the one who punches most of the Nakama into her in some skirmish they have during the arc with her main opponent finishing the nakamaing. For instance, we'll probably see her face Natsu and co along with 3 other Spriggans with one of them being Natsu's main opponent when they get to the empire..</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are fucked to hell and back since Oracion Seis dude, I'm not sure what makes you think friendship bullshit has reached it's limits now.</br>  <br> Even friendship bullshit has limits <br><br>Am i right in Fairy tail thread ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She straight up says she doesn't want to do anything but eat mango gelato. She would rather they just go home.</br></br>  <br>He was just tap dancing around it for fun.</br>  <br>No, all of that is reserved for Serena. Brandish will probably dick around with Lucy or Erza.</br>    <br>Clearly that was bullshit (well she might of wanted it but her visit clearly wasn't only that). She knew who they were, what they were after and must of known the scuffle beforehand. In the end it was more effort for her not to just eliminate them all.</br>  <br>It's the power of love turn now.</br>  <br>It's not a real question at all. The EXACT same thing that always happens will happen and everyone whos not an idiot knows it. The good guys will get their ass kicked for a while. Bad guys will knock them down. Good guys stand up anyways. Bad guys are shocked and ask how. Good guys say because muh nakama and bring out some brand new move that instantly wins the fight.</br>  <br> No, all of that is reserved for Serena. <br>While I wont disagree about Brandishs' main fight being with Lucy and/or Erza, Serena looks too much like Yuri Dreyar not to be Laxus's arc opponent. Natsu will probably skirmish with all the high tier Spriggans once with the Wild Silhouetted Spriggan in the middle being his main opponent.</br></br>  <br> Clearly that was bullshit (well she might of wanted it but her visit clearly wasn't only that) <br>I dunno about that. She seems to be one of those lazy/glutton archtypes. She might have volunteered for this assignment just for that reason.</br></br>  <br>Friendship will enable Natsu to punch dimensions and Erza to be Erza so she can Erza her enemies but not at the same level that that Natsu because she will job at the big bad guy.</br>  So what's up with Natsu's arm?  <br> So what's up with Natsu's arm? <br>END Demonification shit or Dragonification, maybe even both.</br></br>  <br>at least one of them looks like a Demon of Zeref to me.</br>  <br> EDGE <br><br>No seriously,that's Edo Wendy level of diamond cutter elbows.</br></br></br>  <br>She ought to show off her hips like Lucy does.</br>  <br>She already has a naked apron on.Plus skirt.<br><br>Actually,it was a serious question.How phat must her ass be to make the skirt show behing the apron?<br><br>Unless it's an illusion from the art.She looks like an oppai loli/shortstack there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Even friendship bullshit has limits <br>not in fairy tail anon</br></br>  <br>That covers like 2 Spriggans. The rest still somehow have to be handled by people who aren't as good at bullshit-channeling.</br>  <br> at bullshit-channeling. <br>all FT cast is good at BS channeling <br><br>The idea of the 12 spriggan being broken is not bad, were not we know they will just job to power of friendship and how they will maul MC for 3 chapters and then MC will beat em with 1 punch</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Gray is that tier of bullshit-chaneller too, Then the other 3 dragon-killers, the rest would require entire Guilds to team up and fight one, probably.</br>  How long till Erza and Wendy get the lewd edit too?  So does /a/ hate this or what? Am i gonna get called a shitcunt with no taste if i say i like the show?  <br>1) Erza + Natsu<br>2) Makarov + Grey<br>3) Changer of heart on the guy that was Isgard #1<br>4) Gagille + Team B<br>5) Laxus + Thunder Gods <br>6) Isgard #2 + Guild<br>7) Isgard #3 + Guild<br>8) Threeman + Guild</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the general consensus that the PLOT is great but its predictable and only good in a guilty pleasure sorta way, so pretty much what /a/ thinks of most shonens</br>  No official Brandish colors, so it's open season for colorists.  <br>Bra needs chains to restrain that PLOT.</br>  So I dropped Fairy Tail before chapter 100 because it was formulaic, but I'm thinking of picking it up again, if only to waste some time.<br><br>Has Fairy Tail fallen in with the likes of Bleach in that you don't read it for the story or engaging characters, or even the fights most of the time, you read it for the trainwreck and tits? Because if so, I'm in.</br></br>  <br><br><br>He's just stopping the shaking of his arm because of how powerful she is.</br></br></br>  <br>Even if the only reason for someone to read Fairy Tail was it being a trainwreck and for the tits, it has become really boring at this point. Mashimas fuckups were funny maybe 200 chapters ago. He really likes drawing fanservice, sure, but all the sluts in his series look the same except bodywise. There are really a lot of series that do fanservice better than FT, and donÂ´t get as much attention. Why not give those a try?</br>  <br>I don't think I'm going to even have the will to read FT for 300+ chapters straight. It's easier to read once a week since you can practically spend less than 2 mins just to read one chapter, but not if you marathoned it.</br>  <br>Wow, so Mashima's fallen that far? At one point I owned every volume of Rave Master because it was just so much fun, but I guess having such a long-running series like FT has him stuck in a hell of a rut. That's pretty sad.</br>  <br><br>I prefer backstory</br></br>  <br>Samefag here, didnÂ´t mean to leave "except" there</br>   guy didnt even get the chance to job <br>I can already see it, new super enemies are going to hurt themselves so much because of their arrogance and missing chances of taking care of fairy tail again and again.</br>  <br> He's just stopping the shaking of his arm because of how powerful she is. <br>Indeed, that is the simplest explanation of the arm shaking. But, since we're bound to see some E.N.D development during this arc, and the fact that the 'shaking arm' is the one with Bandages on it, is enough to consider that it might be something more.</br></br>  <br><br> Talks about backstory <br> Doesn't post Ultear </br></br></br>  <br>Shit now we'll never know what his relaxation space looks like</br>  <br>Are you into 90y old anon ?</br>  <br> PUNKY GOOOOOD HIP!!!! </br>  <br><br>yes.</br></br>  <br>That's what doujins are foHAHAHAHAHAAA</br>    <br>Saved.</br>  <br>Mashima always comes up with the perfect doujin scenarios but no one ever takes the bait.

The universe knows that if any large number of people produce HQ FT doujins alot of of us would be dickless by now. So the only thing we get is the occasional western commission that might turn out good, or that one guy on paheal who does some pretty good FT pics every now and then, but fucks off for months on end.</br></br>  <br>ahem,meant </br>  Does this manga have any villains who mind control the female cast into being minions/s;aves/playthings?  <br>At least once, off the top of my head.</br>  <br> FUCK I HAVE FRIENDS IM SO TOUGH <br><br>kek'd so fking hard</br></br></br>  <br>This is a new fucking low for Mashima.</br>  <br>Ganjeel confirmed for huge dick</br>  <br><br>Gotta give Elfman credit for leveling up enough to send Gazille crashing through a wall with a domino punch.</br></br>  <br>So which Spriggan will have the joke power?

It doesn't even match with Hana's design.   disappointing art style <br> disappointing VA choices <br>At least the OP is fun...<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=87a<wbr>tHQpNtss</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  This anime is going to be a huge disappoitment. I won't even look at the first episode.  <br>Why does the Animation look like shit?</br>  <br>She believes in chastity and follows the bullshit ideals of Mari, hence why she's pissed off at Kiyoshi. He caught her taking a piss, she's scared of anyone finding out, she is seeking vengeance, and her quest for revenge turns into an obsession for Kiyoshi.</br>  Can wait for the first episode and the series becoming more popular  <br>The animation for a manga that looks like Prison School will inevitably falter in comparison.<br><br>You don't need to watch it if you don't want to.</br></br></br>  <br>This<br><br>I'll probably just stick to the manga but if the anime gets more PS fans then great.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are not let them watch &amp; find out?</br>  The designs look pretty bad. Fucking JC Staff.  When did JC Staff learn how to draw?  <br><br><br>For the porn?</br></br></br>  Ehhh I'll take it. There was no way they were going to do justice to the manga's god tier art anyway.I just hope the animation isn't complete shit.  Best girl for best show.  <br>Oh, the Kamiyan will use the Arararararagi voice for this.</br>  Wait, guys...<br>I know that Japan's broadcast will be censored, but what about Funi's release? There would be no reason for that to be censored...right?</br>  <br>You mean the only fucking voice he knows how to do?<br>But seriously, the casting for Kiyoshi was spot on. It was close to how I was imagining his voice in the manga.</br></br>  <br> I know that Japan's broadcast will be censored, but what about Funi's release? <br>How fucking new are you?</br></br>  <br>DxD (both dub and sub) and Shinometa this season are censored through them.</br>  Holy fuck I've never heard a voice fit so badly.<br><br>Hana Kana does not fit her at all.</br></br>  <br>how do the designs looks bad?</br>   Hana Kana <br><br>Her voice just stands out so much now. I don't even hear a character anymore, I just hear Hana Kana standing behind a mic.</br></br>  <br> BotI's adaptation <br>Fuck, I had already forgot that exists.</br></br>  <br>Are you a faggot? I wish every character in existence was voiced by HanaKana.</br>  <br>Really? I actually hate her in every role she's had other than kuragehime and nisekoi, but I think she fits both of those perfectly. <br><br>I know it's kind of mainstream as well but I can totally see her being voiced by Yu Kobayashi using a very neutral tone into her batshit insane voice for the shifts.</br></br></br>   more angry Hana Kana <br><br>YES. MY DICK IS READY.</br></br>  I don't think the voice choice was bad. It is not like this is Beatrice in Umineko.  <br>Stop being such a faggot. You're gonna watch this shit like the rest of us</br>    I want Hanazawa Kana to shout at me more.  <br>Mah nigga<br>You and I, Anon</br></br>  <br>Then you should probably kill yourself<br><br>The voice does not fit Hana</br></br></br>  <br>Your dick doesn't fit Hana.</br>  Chiyo CM when?  <br>It's kanazawa hana, nerd</br>  animation look like shit  <br>God the art looks terrible<br><br>Dropped</br></br></br>  <br>Something's off here. But I do love me some Hana. Waterworks when?</br>  <br> Chiyo CM when? <br>tomorrow<br><br><br> The voice does not fit Hana <br>i think too, but they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Kanahana and think she would fit the roll better if she wasn't making her voice sound like nadeko. I was really excited for the mad hana scenes because i love kanahana's angry voice. The art looks good, its probably the best they could do given the manga art being on par with Onepunch Man in terms of beauty. I still have faith for the adaption being enjoyable but i know it wont compare with the anime; as long as the anime spawns new hentai Ill be happy.  <br>She was good in AgK as a batshit insane cyborg.</br>  <br>Compare with the manga* too early for me to be making coherent sentences.</br>  I kinda wish this was 3D instead. Sidonia looks good and JC staff never draws nipples. So shokugeki flopped.  <br>It will spawn porn, which will be the only good thing the anime ends up doing</br>  all these niwakashitters mad about their niwaka manga series being adapted not to their liking, fuckin comedy :)  I cant help but to keep image hanazawa peeing in my face.  <br>It's not such a bad image.</br>  <br>She... doesn't look like Hana.</br>  <br>I was kinda hoping differently, but that doesn't make any sense unless they are forcing the company to censor it? Yet, of the license agreement is with distributor/company there's no reason to give Funi a censored copy to broadcast.<br><br>Hell, Funi could even advertise having the uncensored one to entice more customers. If the show is, genuinely, good people will buy it anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>The reference design looks like her early chapter appearance but the artists couldn't remotely match that with how low the budget must be, ontop of not being able to animate this to any degree. Might aswell be Inferno Cop tier shit</br>  <br> Sidonia looks good <br> liking low framerate ugly CGshit <br><br>Opinion discarded.</br></br></br></br>  Kanahana sounds too far from what I had in mind. Lately anime adaptations are killing enjoyment from manga for me. I'm giving it 5 minutes max. Skipped SnS, probably gonna skip this too.  <br> that voice <br>Glad she isn't my favorite character anyway.</br></br>  <br>Cause all these cocksuckers want the plot spoon fed to them.</br>  <br>Lets be honest, noone's art work will do this man any justice.<br>I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either<br><br><br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>FML<br><br>Hopefully Chaos Dragon delivers with lewd seiyuus. I need sex in my ears</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   JC Staff <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>  <br> hana <br> hanakana <br><br>Japanese humour knows no boundaries!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kiyoshi <br> Hiroshi <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br></br>  she looks fine<br><br>you niggers whine too much</br></br>  So that's how you choose a V.A. for your anime these days!  <br> &gt;/out/ </br>  jesus fuck that voice.. kill me pls  <br>Of course not anon she isnt real</br>  I remember a lot of people wanting Hanakana as Hana long before the anime was anounced.<br><br>Now nobody wants her.</br></br>  I like HanaKana but that moe voice don't suit Hana at all!!<br><br>I imagined her voice would be deeper tho.</br></br>  <br>I absolutely love it, first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary.<br>Is this gap-moe?</br></br>  Doesn't look that bad  <br> first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary. <br>That's how it was supposed to be but it sounds too forced here. I really liked Nadeko's batshit insane voice, but apparently she forgot how to act since then.</br></br>  <br>Because she, along with everyone that likes her, is an insufferable autist.</br>  <br>He also can do the edgemaster Izaya\Levi voice.</br>  <br>VA is shit. Goddamn, it doesn't fit her at all.</br>  I can see the problem that everyone is having here as it's a bit off putting, but I imagine that, after a bit, we'll get used to it.  JC staff , please learn to lip synch. That shit is cringeworthy.  <br>SONANOKA OHOHAHAHAHA~</br>  <br>That's how she's supposed to sound. She acts like a nice girl at first.<br><br>People who say HanaKana's voice is unfitting have no idea what they're talking about. It sounds fucking perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds like shit.</br>  <br>This.Her insane rage voice &gt; her moe shit.</br>  <br>It's better animated than I expected. Hope it stays like that while airing.</br>  why does she have boobs  <br>is this from those digital magazine?</br>  Meh.<br>I like Hana Kana but I don't think her voice fits for this role.</br>  Meh, I'm not feeling it. I like HanaKana, but it's not exactly the voice I had in mind for Hana.  <br>HAI HAI HAI DICKITAL MAGAJIN DA YOO NEEEE~</br>  <br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br>  <br>Just a bro who obviously has good taste.</br>  <br> posts 9 seconds apart <br> samefag </br></br>  <br> 11:28:27 <br> 11:28:36 </br></br>  <br> Hana Kana has done only one lewd role <br> What is Neptunia and Iris Heart? </br></br>  <br>Why is the art so bad? Also her voice doesn't fit. This is going to be a disaster.</br>  <br> JC staff never draws nipples <br>You need to watch more JC staff anime if you think that. I bet you think they never draw toddlers in bondage too.</br></br>  <br>I think the problem is with the color palette. I don't know, it just feels off. Everything else actually looks OK.<br>I also find it amusing how everyone was saying HanaKana was perfect for this role, now we have plenty of people who don't agree.</br></br>  Dropped  <br><br>Oh wow</br></br>  <br><br>newfag</br></br>  <br>So cool onee-saaaan droppinga a show is soooo manlyyy</br>  <br><br> hanazawa voice didnt give you a boner </br></br>  <br> Nine fucking seconds <br> Samefagging </br></br>  <br>Better luck next time, kid.</br>  <br>The art looks good to me. I mean, it's impossible for animation to be faithful to such high quality manga art, but they got close enough.</br>  <br>Is Kate getting animated?</br>  <br>Not unless there a season 2. God i hope not.</br>  <br>no, they couldve done an ova covering certain chapters. The good chapters of course, but the japs chose quantity over quality</br>  She sounds too much like Mayuri and her angry voice isn't as good as her angry Nadeko.<br><br>Kinda disappointing.</br></br>  I guess because the manga is black and white but I feel everything looks a little too bright.  <br><br>Tuturu~ <br>Hanachan-desu~<br>Okarin~ did you get my metal umpa?</br></br></br></br>  <br>An OVA wouldn't necessarily have better art.</br>  <br>It's JC staff. They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre. The animation is subpar and the anime will have shit pacing. Don't expect it to reach the prison break out.</br>  <br>where the hell would it even end?</br>  Meh. Not a fan of hanakana for this role tbh.  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>Like you even need to worry about that.</br></br>  <br>I'll screen cap this for laughs when PS anime reach break out arc</br>  <br>Tuturu, motherfucker.</br>  <br>Anon, 540p is your friend</br>  <br>1080p!!!!60fps</br>   that blazer shading <br><br>They should fire the coloring staff, it looks like it was a baby's first time shading using photoshop.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's the shading that makes this look off. Should have just painted shit black.</br>   Mari PV...maybe 40 posts <br> Meiko PV...no more than 30 posts <br> Hana PV...already 130+ posts <br><br>Is it because of Hana's voice or is it because it's Hana? Is this going to be a case of everyone just bitching about the anime in these threads, because too many people read the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>People love Hana, Vice-Prez was pretty meh in the entire manga. Mari and Chiyo are more liked than her, even Risa might be more liked here than Meiko. <br>The complaining in any adaption thread always comes from people who want to see something they like done well, not done terribly. <br><br>I felt the same way for Sidonia no Kishi being ugly as fuck 3DCG.</br></br></br></br>  My god, JC staff made Hana look like the bland bitch from bakuman, but blonde.  <br>fucking disgusting</br>  Holy fuck this show looks ugly. Might actually drop it.<br>Snakefags will love angry Kanahana though and she seems to pull it off pretty well.</br>  <br> They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre <br>What the fuck are you smoking?</br></br>  <br> Watching Bakuman. </br>  <br>voice doesn't fit at all</br>  the show would be better if it was adapted by shaft or deen  <br>Are you high? Meiko was the cover and face of promotional material for the series before Hana's popularity soared.</br>  Hana doesn't deserve this much of love from /a/  <br>Hana's shit. Praise Mari, Chiyo and Meiko. cough</br>    <br>Talking about here, and Hana was always more liked than Vice-Prez.</br>  <br> the show would be better if it was adapted by (...) deen </br>  <br>the voice isn't in sync.......</br>  <br>Oh you.</br>  <br>The lines said are separate from the images shown, they are never in sync because they aren't from the same scene.</br>  I think it fits her initial appearance when the boys thought she was nice and cute before she started killing them. But I can't imagine hana sounding like that after that, especially with the more recent chapters.  <br>only for disgusting tsunderefags<br>the only time hana was even a little likeable is when she cried because kiyoshi wouldn't ourboros with her</br></br>  Meiko is horribly underrated on /a/.  <br>which makes no sense, she's the only usc who seems to be have the potential to become loyal and caring wife</br>  <br>Whats the name of that pv music?</br>  <br>Snore.</br>  <br>Even if we accept your point, snore &gt; kicked in the face.<br>For the same reason that 0 &gt; -15</br></br>  <br>It's the OP of the show</br>  <br>Yes because sweating cows are disgusting.</br>  <br>If we accept your point, since Chiyo is the most peaceful girl in the series, Chiyo &gt; Meiko.</br>  <br>If we judge girls based on their worst possible chiyo &gt; meiko<br>If we judge girls based on their best possible meiko &gt; chiyo<br>In both cases chiyo&gt;hana and meiko&gt;hana.<br>Hana a shit.<br>Only mari is worse than her and that's not saying much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With shows like this you always run into the problem that the porn tends to be boring.</br>  Are they even trying? The voice acting is so exaggerated it makes me cringe. <br><br>When she's nice, she sounds 5 octaves too high and when she's mad she's 5 too low along with the stupid guttural tone. Anime itself is generally an exaggerated fantasy, but this is a bit much.</br></br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' <br>Chiwa Saito is always there.</br></br>  <br>Chiwa Saito wouldn't have fit Hana. Besides HanaKana (which works, you fags are too whiney) I can only see Ayane Sakura or Aoi Yuuki working for her.</br>  <br>Somebody needs to go back to Logic 101. I've been told that won't cover achieving a refined taste, but maybe you'll learn something in the road.</br>  <br>Out of curiosity, with which of the 4 lines, -exclude the hana a shit one- do you want to try to disagree with?</br>  <br><br>What makes HIramoto's art distinctive is his attention to shadows and shading. <br><br>All of today's anime are done digitially so it is nearly impossible to do shading and shadows unless it is physically painted and shaded for specific shots in like pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was always liked tard. Clearly you forget the hand holding scene.</br>  <br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>That and binbougami. Rize y Sakura the best for me the rest it's a big meh</br></br>  <br> she was always liked <br>yes. <br>by tsunderefags.</br></br></br>  <br>And the kiss scene, and literally every scene shes in. People love unresolved sexual tension, hana and the MC are the only ones with ridiculous amounts of it.</br>  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>You don't. You really, really don't.</br></br>  <br> People like a character i don't. I better start shitposting their threads! </br>  Tuturu!  <br>I hate tsundere but like Hana. What now, faggot?</br>  <br>Not fond of tsundere but hana is great. You can eat shit.</br>  <br>ughhh.. too cutesy default voice</br>  Yuu Kobayashi would have been great.  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>She's not in enough things. <br><br><br>I think Hana is one of the better female characters in the story and it has nothing to do with her being an tsundere, at all. She's really unique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is though.</br>  <br> not omigawa chiaki <br>shit<br><br> all that QUALITY <br>dropped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it isn't, PS is unique</br>  <br>Her VA sucks balls</br>   artwork is shit  <br>Its the same artwork as the first chapters of the manga. However, PS manga artwork does progressively get better quality.<br><br> Voice is shit <br>Really? You should just drop it and move on, <br> Shitposting <br>Fucking Christ. In Every damn thread</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you defending it so hard?</br>  I figured HanaKana would be better suited Chiyo  <br> for Chiyo </br>  <br>I thought I was being neutral<br>I have a request<br>Can you compare the PV and Manga in the same scene where Hana introduced herself. I really like to see the comparison<br>Im on my phone, so I can't do shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sir, Would you kindly...... EAT SHIT</br>  Am I the only one thinking the viz prez tits are too FUCKING big? <br>They look awesomely glorious in the manga, here they are gargantuan air balloons, they break her form and aren't remotely attractive.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this<br><br>Hana is not this big<br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true with all anime adaptations.</br>  I don't really think the angry voice HanaKana does fits her too much, we will just have to wait and see  <br>Where the fuck are you when Meiko's PV was released?</br>  <br> tfw she has the least likes </br>  <br>The anime made her look ridiculous</br>  <br> First musume <br> Now this <br><br>What else is poor anime going to ruin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Though I really liked her voice.<br> Mari was also spot on. </br></br>  <br>Is that HanaKana?</br>  <br>You can't do any shading at all digitally?</br>  <br>Yes, it's the Psycho Pass chick</br>  <br>and mainstream</br>  <br>I dont get why people say this is poorly animated? That kick looked great. Are you all just finding something to complain about?</br>  <br>The art style. Can't ever expect it to look like the mangaka's work, but it's way too bland compared to it.</br>  <br>[url]https://<span>youtu.be/KE9WCa6MFk0[/<wbr>url]</wbr>  [ ] Meiko</br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br>That spit.<br>I'm not a Meiko fan but damn, that was hot as fuck.</br></br>  <br> let's make her boobs bigger than her head <br> the nerds will love that <br><br>Who the fuck thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast.<br>Unless you have those specific fetishes.</br></br>  <br><br>Those out-shape lard bags are ridicolous, they don't even look like fake assess...<br>Also, the "IT'S HER FUCKING NIPPLE" scene is going to look atrocious instead of boner inducing because of that.</br></br></br>  I don't think they could've picked a worse cast for this.  <br> She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast. <br>You saying you didn't want to lick the sweat running along her inner thigh, following its trail all the way up to her drenched cunt?</br></br>  <br>It's the anime that sucks design-wise, in the manga she's a sex bomb.<br> On a side note... u gay, nigga? </br></br>  <br>Fuck, I thought her voice would have been better, it's shit though.</br>  Can't wait to hear Kamiya cookie cutter voice and ruin this show even more.  <br>don't know how this works, so I put it like this</br>  <br>The fuck are those cowtits?</br>   HanaKana fans will defend this   <br>Your new is showing, go back to lurking.</br>  <br>Maybe you're the faggot.</br>  <br><br>Yeah that was silly to say, any effect/shading can be achieved nowadays, that stuff simply isn't in vogue.</br></br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence <br>So every seiyuu with actual talent?<br>Fucking burgers knowing shit about dubbing as usual.</br></br></br>  I havent read Prison School in what feels like forever<br><br>Which chapter is the one where the President says "No one has so much as put a finger inside me" ?</br></br>  <br>yeah, url... <br>I just said a while ago</br></br>  <br>I've tried to find what the fuck niwaka means for some time now without any success.</br>  <br>Who knows, It's probably around chapter 100 or even later.

I hope she goes back to normal soon though. her retard persona sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see her being tsundere in only a few scenes. However, there are times when she becomes yandere tho. What do you call a char with both Tsundere and Yandere? <br> Unique </br></br></br>  <br>She did go back<br>182.</br></br>  <br><br>Because she's a big girl.</br></br>  <br>You caught me off guard Anon</br>  <br><br>Go look for Prison School doujins and you'll find one that is actually decent quality (bless you Roujira Jack). <br><br>I can assure you that you already know the answer as to which girl is the focus of said doujin</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hana is literally the best girl.</br>  <br> bitching about the anime <br>If there's a good reason to bitch about something being shitty compared to the original, I don't see the problem.</br></br>  <br>That would be great if 182 was out yet</br>  <br>Korean scans came out and were translated.</br>  <br>North Korea has had a trade embargo with PS's author for several years now so stop lying with that shit.</br>  <br>All in good time mah nigga.<br>She will be the star in the upcoming chapters, then later with another kiyoshi's absurb love triangle</br></br>   muh anime looks like shit <br><br>the problem is the faggots comparing current manga style directly to the anime</br></br>  <br>Yes, thank you for comparing them</br>  This is what I've been waiting for.  <br> semen demon <br>Fits her perfectly</br></br>  <br> quantity over quality <br>So 12-24 good episodes is worse than 48+ bad ones, now?</br></br>  <br>No, shes a piss-demon.</br>  Fuck the color pallete and animation looks so damn bad  I love that the author stopped drawing the girls realistically, they looked so fucking weird the first few chapters.   hanazawa <br><br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Early artstyle was garbage.</br>  <br><br>I hope the art style will get better, same as the manga<br> cautiously hoping </br></br></br>  <br>Well I can see why I dislike the anime design now. Cheekbones aren't well defined in the first two images (as opposed to the manga) and her hair isn't as round, but looks more like the tip of a penis</br>  <br> looks more like the tip of a penis <br>Foreshadowing</br></br>  <br> hair yellow/blonde <br>Foreshadowing pee</br></br>  <br> That voice is for a fucking child. <br>It's like you forgot how the character behaves throughout the first arc and how she develops from a toddler to a teen over time</br></br>  So this is going to be a bigger disappointment than the AkG adaptation?  <br>She's still highschool age. Her ovaries should have dropped.<br><br>Also, Hana is a total tomboy, thus her voice should be deeper than fucking HanaKana.</br></br></br>  <br> Tomboy <br>Knows how to make tea and only turns violent to boys</br></br>  <br>And i was looking forward to it. Well whatever just stick to manga i guess. You didnt even need to say who, its fucking obvious from that same monotone voice like every single character done by her.</br>   character is named Hana <br> hey guys what if we...ahahahahha... what if..... what if we..... ahahahahaahahah let Hanazawa kana dub her <br> get it guys, am i not funny <br><br>There had to be one faggot like this in production who ruined it for eveyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mental age != Biological age<br>We have no background on her past, but for all we can tell, she was sheltered up until the boys showed up in Hachimitsu, hence the way she gets pushed around by Mari until Kiyoshi forces her to grow up (albeit in the weirdest way possible)</br></br>  I'm being baited by all these people who are saying they don't like this, and I'm taking all of it.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12766750 <br>you will watch it anyway</br>  <br>The only relevant complaints are about the animation, but even then I can't hold it against JC for not keeping up to Hiramoto's godlike traces</br>  The artstyle looks disgusting. <br><br>Show would be truely better in Shaft's hands and the highly detailed close-up shots.</br></br>  <br>Why</br>   Anime of a well drawn manga with a unique artstyle isn't as good as the manga <br><br>Wow I am fucking shocked, remember how extremely good were the anime adaptation of Jojo, Kenshiro, Berserk and Monster?<br><br>Yeah me neither.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of your listed manga got high budget adaptations.</br>  <br> High budget adaptations <br>Not true.<br><br>Besides, all of them looked like shit, maybe Kenshiro not so much, Jojo OVA animation was great but the fidelity was disgusting, and the designs of Hayama weren't so fitting, Berserk is terrible in every way except the OST, which is god-tier, Berserk movies are terrible in general, and Kenshiro, well, not that bad, but not as good as the manga.</br></br></br></br>  I'm working on the subtitles of the anime for a simulcast right now and let me tell you, they really nailed the voice actors.<br>Everyone is on point 100% of the time, especially Hanazawa. Don't be fooled by this commercial which is out of sync; she does a great job.</br>  <br> commercial which is out of sync <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>David's adaptation of jojo was quite good.</br>  <br>The colors were terrible, the pacing was a bit slow sometimes, and the last episodes looked like shit thanks to the amount of QUALITY, but I'm still looking forward to the BDs.</br>  <br>  monster <br>  bad <br><br>Look at this loser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Should have filmed it like Aku no Hana, with real AV actors and Goro.</br>  That voice is the exact opposite of what I had expected.<br>Single handedly killed 90% of the hype for this anime for me.</br>  <br>When did I say that? Learn to read fucking retard.</br>  <br>But Aku no Hana was butt ugly.</br>  I wouldn't have a problem with Hana's voice if she only used her angry hick voice or sounded more like she did in Yamada-kun.<br><br>I'm tired of her squeaky mouse voice.</br></br>  <br>AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<br><br>HANAFAGS <br>B T F O<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> I read that from right to left. <br> Fuck. </br></br>  <br>It works suprisingly well until the last three panels.</br>  <br>No.</br>  We have multiple sub options this time and the determination to fist is stronger than ever.  <br> Chris is just flabby and unfit <br>This is why I'm worried that we won't see any gun kata. It requires a high level of physical finesse.<br><br>Chris fights usually involve her standing there and blowing shit up, jumping out of the way, and then repeat.<br>I want to see some Mami vs Homura shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolute angel. My goddess.</br>  <br>Symphogears give them physical boosts so she should be fine. She fought Tsubasa in CQC in G already.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's one of the coolets parts about Symphogear, all the songs are used from live recordings, and are re done every time you hear them singing to fit the mood. It's more evident in scenes like the  SHUTTLE SUPLEX  and  THESE FISTS, THIS LIFE. <br><br><br> I never thought I can be sexually aroused to voices until I watched Symphogear. <br>I want to  throat fuck Aoi Yuuki. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what else is even airing this season.</br>  I need based Anime OSTs, pronto.<br><br>Whether it's download links or youtube playlist, whatever, post them.</br></br>          <br>Nice, OP. Do you do epic poses when you listen to epic Jojo music? I sometimes do, lol.</br>  fuck  It is out.  <br>Aeris: Liz<br>Cloud: Meliodas <br>Sephiroth : Zeldris?</br></br></br>  <br>So bitches be biting?</br>  <br> Critisizing that thereÂ´s nothing more to the trial than a dumb powerup = admitting you know that youÂ´re wrong somehow <br> Twisting someones phrases by not understanding their implications on purpose  <br>Only on /a/</br></br></br>  <br> Only on /a/ <br>No, that actually happens everywhere on the Internet.</br></br>  <br>touche</br></blockquote>]
