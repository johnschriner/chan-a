Back before the anime started the only way to not have a shitpost infested thread was an Iroha op. <br><br>I used to make them because the animeonly people had no idea who she was, so putting Iroha as the OP was literally a way to guarantee that a thread would be devoid of shitposts. <br><br>Obviously it doesn't work anymore, but it was pretty damn fantastic at the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I definitely think it's most likely to happen, I definitely would not like it.<br><br> I want to struggle and shit to reach muh genuine regardless of the consequences <br> Oh, let's just stay friends and ignore our romantic feelings. <br><br>It just wouldn't feel right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I interpret it however I want.

Probably Yukino since she has the most red flags to preclude a happy romantic ending for her.</br></br>  <br>Great trolling, friendo</br>  <br>I was thinking that the romantic feelings will flame out due to shit happening. Their friendship rises from the ashes of the house that the love triangle burned down.</br>  <br>You could've been creative and go for something like  . Since we were talking about k-drama, makes that reason cancer and your bait will get a lot of bites.</br>  <br> Hayama NTR <br>It isn't? I thought everybody would blow a fuse whenever those Hayama x Yukino/Yui posts come up. <br><br><br>Perhaps he means that the ending will seem foreshadowed to some but an asspull to others? It sounds like he's just stating the common reaction to every romcom ending in my honest opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they can't be together because reasons <br>wait for me end? that's one of the worse endings <br>WW won't do that I believe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hey I'm not shitposting.

I think their romance will never even really take off outside of a general exchange of feelings because by then they'll know they're on different trajectories. So it's just sad. But they'll remain friends and their romantic feelings will dissipate with time.</br></br>  <br><br><br>To be fair that isn't all that unlikely, Yukino's position is still pretty unclear for the most part. While a lot of flags point to her, the idea that they might not actually be able to enter a relationship isn't exactly all that out of left field.</br></br></br>   final episode aired <br> one week later, 24/7 threads are still a thing <br>Why.</br></br>    <br><br>They're slowing down, give it another week and we'll just have once a week threads.</br></br>  So what exactly is she trying to do again?<br><br>Seems like she's just going after any guy other girls are interested in</br></br>  <br>We're dying, we have maybe 2-3 more threads left at best</br>  <br>You can never get off Mr. Watari's Wild Ride.</br>  Yukino and Yui are not good love interests. Both of them have a gigantic overlap in current issues, and are of similar levels of romantic interest to 8man, but the way 8man sees them is rather different: 8man admires Yukino, and looks down on/distances himself from Yui. As 8man gets to know them both as people, his image of them each will normalize- for Yui this means his image of her will improve, for Yukino this means he'll take her off a pedestal and accept she's not what he thought she was. As a result, Yui will probably overtake Yukino next volume, the fact she already has brute forced some progress between them only reinforces that.<br><br>However, there's also the fact that a great deal of Yui's progress with 8man has been on the basis of him tolerating her.The hair grooming for example was very clear on this aspect. There's the possibility 8man may give her a cold shower when he realizes it's not genuine to humor her advances while being noncommittal himself.<br><br>That said, they're both awful love interests from a narrative standpoint. The Yukino/Yui situation is a very detrimental in that beyond which makes somewhat more sense developmentally, neither romance means very much to the narrative. 8man loving (or, even worse, 'realizing' he's in love with) them doesn't contribute anything significant to the narrative, while spitting on the fact that the entirety of the story has revolved around the club becoming closer as friends. (Particularly the relationship between Yukino and Yui, which people often disregard despite being as important if not moreso as 8man's relationship with either.) No matter how you look at it, you can't write one of the club members into being a third wheel without it contradicting the central premise of the story.<br><br>Practically anything would be better than a club member romance end. This is an opinion I (and many others) have held since the beginning, and the latest novels only reinforce it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fill the void left by no new episodes</br>  <br> she gave Hayama chocolate that had her saliva and 8man's saliva mixed in </br>  These threads were better during season 1, now it's just about pairings and character's feelings. Shit's annoying.  <br>Literal autism, "god I hope he's not actually this retarded" edition.</br>   Oregiaru like ending could mean anything <br><br>The series is about you thinking you understand about something but then that image gets shattered<br><br> You think we get friendship end but a girl actually win <br> You think Yukino is going to win because main girl but she wont <br> You think Yui has caught up to Yukino in Vol 11 but as it turns out she was never in the race to begin with (Yuki would always win) <br> You'd think Iroha given her relationship with the MC can win but in the end she was just a ship tease <br> You''d think Sensei would never end up withsomeone but she wins the Sensei Contest and forces Hachiman to marry her <br> You'd think Komachi would be able to enter Sobu after getting excellent luck but she fails because even Komachi needs to suffer <br> You'd think Hayama was after haruno but the real Y he was after was Yuimom the milf </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's vote<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4806717</br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is the worst girl.  8man,born in 8/8/98.<br>8 months and 8 days later, Iroha is born.</br>  <br> You think Haruno isn't going to win because she isn't genuine, but she will because she is genuinely evil. </br>  <br>I R O H A<br>R<br>O<br>H<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many polls do we need to prove that Iro- never mind.<br>Carry on.</br></br>  <br> Or maybe it was to showcase the source of possible bias? <br>So he wanted to add pretense to his post, another thing that has no place on this board.<br><br>Xfaggotry is cancer, the fact you're falling back on 'culture' as if it's supposed to be an excuse is evidence enough of that. Not every single anime discussed on this board is one of your trashy harems, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man admires Yukino <br>this ended since vol6 when 8man realized Yukino lies too, and saw her as an equal after that, not to mention since genuine and water ride scene Yukino has been depending and looking up to 8man more than he has, and he notices this.<br> No matter how you look at it, you can't write one of the club members into being a third wheel without it contradicting the central premise of the story. <br>Isn't the central premise of the story to be geniuine with your friends and not hide anything? Having all three of them ignore their feelings wouldn't make for a genuine ending at all, and even when one girl does get hurt she still has to genuinely accept it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literal autism <br>Welcome to /a/, where people actually try to talk about anime.</br></br>  <br>(I know you're just funposting but man, interesting thought experiment with this)<br><br>If YYfags actually put thought into the question, I guarantee you that they won't actually vote for their waifus, the obvious implication being that they aren't "after" Iroha.<br><br>Yet at the same time that provides your typical statistics-tier "evidence" that they are far behind her because nobody votes for them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same thing she did at the marathon, probably went to give Hayama the chocolates so that Miura would be motivated to do so. Note the shape of the chocolates.</br>  <br>Only correct answer is Orimoto. The rest are above Iroha, and the poll is based on a false premise.</br>  <br>Gentlemen, I'd like to present you what is colloquially referred to as an "asshole". Though in this case it is a rare variation of the species that seems to be longing for some sort of acceptance among society, but does so in a misguided way by believing that acting like a jackass will make people like him. A sad, and pathetic way to live ones life, but one we must accept and occasionally laugh at.<br><br>So please everybody, ignore this sad sack of flesh and carry on with your day. Thank you.</br></br></br>  genuine doesn't even look like a word to me anymore  <br>irohafags kept being the top in polls so i think this helps in knowing what girl do irohafags favor after iroha<br><br>imouto or death</br></br></br>  <br>Point, and it is EUrohafag time right now anyway.</br>  <br>Volume 11 implied that he never entirely let go of that illusion though, just like the Yui "nice girl" image.<br><br>I guess he may have been doing a roundabout sort of comparison between his past mistakes and what Yui and Yukino were about to do though. In that case it doesn't look very good for Yui.<br><br> Isn't the central premise of the story to be geniuine with your friends and not hide anything? Having all three of them ignore their feelings wouldn't make for a genuine ending at all, and even when one girl does get hurt she still has to genuinely accept it. <br>You speak as though 8man going for one of them romantically is a requirement of the writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's always an adjective in English but gets treated like a noun all the time in these threads. That annoys me. People need to say 'genuineness' more often.</br></br>  <br>Unfortunately anon, I am afraid your conclusion is incorrect in this case. I direct you to the results of this surprisingly unproxied poll http://strawpoll.me/4798763/r<br><br>It is clear that, without a doubt, that your belief is false and Iroha is the "best girl". Thus the current poll is built upon a legitimate premise.</br></br></br>  <br> komachi ahead because Iroha is not an option. <br>This ship has the best taste.</br></br>  <br> EUrohafag <br> EU about to sleep <br>Irohafags are already established Murrikans which is why when Murikka is asleep there are more YYfags posting</br></br></br>  <br>A shitposter who defends labels on an anonymous board trying to collectively appeal to the board? Sounds about right.<br><br>I want summer to leave.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Humorously enough the exact opposite sentiment has been expressed plenty of times in these threads.<br><br>Irohafags complain that when their girl starts getting hated on, it means the Americans are waking up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see that you still like Iroha, satan.</br>  <br>It's 8PM in the UTC+1 zone right now. If anyone's going to sleep it's sure as hell not the kind of people who spend there time in general threads on 4chan.</br>  <br>Nah. EU, AUS/Asia are Irohafags to the core.<br>The complaints about US waking up are mostly from Irohafags.</br></br>  <br>I'm in burgerland in the Iroha posts tend to pop up during the periods of 1 AM to like 5 AM in the morning. So I can conclude that you're full of shit anon.<br><br> Though I'm an Irohafag myself, but then again I hate living in America so that might have something to do with it. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't you ever lump me in Irohafags. I'll fight you bitch.<br><br>In my humble experience, Irohafags are at their most vile really late at night, like past midnight US CST. Then when I come home for lunch from work and check the thread around 11:30 AM or so there are always complaints about how Americans are waking up and Irohafags are getting shit on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Snap, I forgot that Haruno exists. <br>Let's assume that she has one vote from that single Haruno-fag in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>I'm in America too.<br>Have you seen the last thread. <br>It was YY for a good majority during the night.<br>There is no conclusive evidence that a majority of fans are in any one region.<br>But what I can say is that Iroha's legion is everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  No, seriously, the the heck is she doing  <br>Totsuka has already won the 8bowl</br>  I don't really think what continent you're from decides whether you're an Irohafag or not. I'm European and I can't stand Irohafags. Not because I'm European, but because they're obnoxious as fuck.  <br><br>Yeah it's not really about which region prefers which girl the most as much as where the loudest and most obnoxious posters come from for each girl. Which is basically random.<br><br>It seems like the worst most unhinged Irohafags are from the side of the globe opposite the US judging by their posting times. Other girls may have their most noxious supporters in the US or elsewhere. I noticed also in the last thread the pattern that has gone for weeks got broken to some extent. That may be a sign of people leaving the thread since it's gradually dying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We love you too.</br>  <br>Flirting with the biggest alpha<br>8man is the backup because he isn't a big enough alpha</br></br>  <br>Yeah, nights used to be Iroha time, now it's day.(here in EST)<br>Weird how time flies.</br></br>  <br>Like the Yahari fanbase in general isn't obnoxious. Seriously, weren't you here when the Yuifags when on a week long retard session for that one episode? <br><br>Then there was the silly spoon threads from the Irohafags. <br><br>And Yukinofags are kind of self-explanatory. <br><br>Then the Sakifags suddenly got a pole shoved through their ass and started being assholes out of nowhere.<br><br>Basically what I'm saying is that there isn't a point in singling out just the Irohafags. The whole fanbase is cancerous when the anime season is here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Continent doesn't correlate with preference, but it does correlate to posting quality.<br><br>I've seen productive discussions in relation to every girl at night, most of them are going to naturally revolve around the club simply because Iroha has much less content to discuss.<br><br>Peak hours however are nothing but /v/-tier fanbase wars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohatime is all day long</br>  <br>Yuifags aren't that bad, heck, I'd say that Yui, Sensei and Sakifags are probably the best.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   reach this scene <br> Go to MAL and remove Yukino from my favorites <br><br>What have they done to her?</br></br></br>  This is the only reason why I'm still here. So maybe I can see the anon who made this again.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>You came to the realization that you've never actually understood Yukino.</br>  <br>it's just a joke</br>    Why does Iroha add so many -su to her words?  <br> MAL <br>opinion discarded</br></br>    <br>I'd say they were fine for the most part, but that one week they really took it to the newest low. My opinion of them really dropped after that. <br><br>Senseifags barely post anymore, but when they did after that bridge scene they acted extremely obnoxious despite the fact that was literally her only scene.<br><br>Sakifags used to just act depressed, but their recent posts have been kind of dickish and needlessly arrogant. Usually bashing the Irohafags for supporting an "irrelevant" character, obviously they are lacking a mirror in their households. <br><br>Irohafags for the most part just post fanart and gush about their girl. The only time they are really obnoxious are when they fall for the bait. Which happens really fucking often.<br><br>So personally I place Yuifags and Irohafags at the top, while the rest follow in varying degrees of overall shitty behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  <br>Yuifag have plenty of cancerous posters, the most known ones being the denialfag and the proxyfag.<br><br>Every fanbase is rotten, no exception.</br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Can someone summarize these last threads?<br>I don't know how you can keep going, generals suck the fun out of everything.</br>  <br>The proxyfag isn't so much a cancer as a meme at this point. For one he was probably the one posting most of those polls, and for another he probably isn't even a Yuifag.<br><br>also<br> two examples <br> plenty </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never go with Orimoto to Saize <br> tfwnf <br><br>Why live?</br></br></br></br>  <br> memes <br> shitposting <br> denialfags <br> Yui/Iroha fanart </br></br></br></br>  <br> the most known ones <br>Are you expecting me to know who is who at an anonymous board?</br></br>  <br>Same reason Yukino always adds -shira to her questions.</br>   arguing about which fanbases are more cancerous <br>do you faggots not see the irony?</br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>You forgot posting pan-san while the mods are asleep.</br>  Miss her already.  THK gave me PTSD with deredere fags, everytime I see a post shitting on another girl I can't help but think it's a yuifag behind the post  <br>I guess you could also count the fanfic/yandere guys.</br>  So for a retard like myself,what was the solution that Yui was talking about?  <br> what happened <br>Nothing. She was great then, and she is great now.<br><br>I just hope Yui or Iroha wins, because Yukino makes fun of 8man as much as Orimoto laughs at him. Taiwanese batman deserves better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br> deredere </br></br>  <br>Fanfic is only cancer if it gets spammed or you hate fun. I can't see the slightest thing wrong with Yandere Yui either unless you again fall into the "I hate fun" category.</br>  <br>I would post the analysis some anon wrote if I wasn't on mobile</br>  Komachi is a good girl. I don't have any romantic feelings for her but she soothes my soul.  How the fuck am I supposed to get invested in a love triangle when the end result feels so obvious?<br>At least it isn't as bad as your regular LN romance garbage where either every girl is a one-note crazy jealous bitch or the author takes a dump on everyone else with a chance's characterization to make them seem less appealing than Designated Main Girl, but actually being able to like the characters just makes the waiting for the inevitable feel even more pointless.<br>Why is it so difficult to write your story without giving in to the temptation to jerk off over your obvious favorite?</br></br>  <br>8man please stay.<br> Are you going for the friendship end? </br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Yukimura won.<br><br>Anyone can win never give up hope.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MAL  <br><br>Don't you have some middle school homework to finish before mommy let's you shitpost on 4chan?</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga Yukinofag.</br>  <br>Yukimura will be dropped pretty quickly in the last volume, sorry.<br>It's pretty obvious considering how the writer treat her</br></br>  I think we can all agree that Totsuka &gt; Komachi = Iroha &gt; Rumi &gt; Yui = Sensei &gt; Orimoto &gt; Saki &gt; Miura &gt; Ebina &gt; Yukino = Haruno  <br>Do you really think it's that obvious Yukino will win? I mean I've been a Yukinofag and I don't think she has a 100% chance of winning, in fact WW has even been writing it so Yui still has a good chance to win.<br><br>I can't tell if you're baiting or not.</br></br></br>  So which did you guys prefer?<br><br>S1 Edgelord hachiman or S2 dark and mysterious Hikky?</br></br>  <br><br>Yukimura turned into absolute shit after she "won"</br></br>  Why is Yukino so linkin park?  <br>Dark Accelerator</br>  <br>It's actually unrealistic that 8man is holding out in showing his preference for a girl, he would have made it a lot more obvious if one girl is actually winning.</br>  <br>I prefer the Senpai~! 8man</br>  <br>How can you put rumi ahead of Yui and Yukio behind and still be expected to be taken seriously?</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br> Commie </br>  <br>because of muh loli</br>  <br>S2 /fit/ delinquent Hachiman &gt; S1 memelord twink Hachiman</br>  <br>The end result isn't obvious at all. The exact problem with the love triangle is that the end isn't obvious. If 8man had a clear interest in one over the other things would actually interesting.<br><br>Well, the obvious end would be neither, but for most people the idea of a main heroine they like not getting a romantic end is unthinkable.</br></br></br>  <br>Best 8man is dere 8man.</br>  <br>What do you cool people use instead of MAL?</br>  <br><br>S2 Animation looked better to me</br></br>  These threads made me watch WA2. Finished it today.<br><br>Hold me, /a/.</br></br>  Not just Yukino, but 8man also got kinda defanged. Mind you, he's still a lot less autistic than her.  <br><br>They made him hotter as more girls got interested in him.<br><br>By the end of the series he'll be putting Hayato to shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Rumi is more like 8man than Yukino, and doesn't have massive amounts of baggage.<br><br>Stop equating physical appearance to character.</br></br></br>  <br>S2 8man looks like he can realistically have a harem of 9+/10 girls</br>  Soon?  <br>Did you play White Album 1 yet</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;<wbr>v=N0YoUh0SjWc</wbr>  [ ] This song has so many memories, thank you for the nice times anons.<br>Where is my legion?</br>  <br>Yet. Rumi is definitely the representation of a younger Yukino and Hachiman. However, Hachiman saved her and gave her a second chance at a life without being bullied.</br>  <br>God I want to FUCK HER SO HARD.</br>  <br>Ye</br>  <br>This. 8man as he is right now is not only incapable of accepting any girls love besides totsuka and komachis, but unwilling to do so. His still-rotten personality that he's aware of makes it so any relationship he starts with the girls will likely blow up. Unless 8man goes through some personality changes his loner personality will undermine all his romantic relationships.</br>  <br>Feel's 8man is the sexiest male protagonist since Araragi.</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>I thought she was a representation of Yukino's and 8man's future daughter</br>  <br>Dude she's like 10 years old</br>  <br>It also doesn't help that, before Haruno kicked their collective asses with: "I thought you guys were better than this, is this truly genuine?", Hachiman was trying to be more like Hayato.</br>  <br>I'm here.</br>  <br>Age is just a number</br>  <br> eiii </br>  <br>Every time I see this I wonder how this came into existence.

They will play nice and fair, one will win and the other will stay friends with them with no drama or pain. <br><br>Yui won't be destroyed by 8man rejection her<br>Yukino won't be destroyed by 8man rejection her</br></br></br></br>  <br>Learn from some of us, watch it for her.</br>  <br>Irohafag trying to hide his power level.</br>  <br>Don't know, don't think so, since girls fall head over heels for Hayato</br>  <br>yeah I didn't even watch the last episode because she didn't show up</br>  <br><br>I think vol 11 suggested they will reach that point. But there will be plenty of drama on the way.</br></br>  <br>So, like /a/?</br>  <br>He's on the second floor</br>  <br>I meant to say it won't happen.</br>  Once Yukino and Yui realize the love between Hayama and Hikigaya they will both quit because they know they can't interfere with true love. Look gay is in Hikigaya's name. IT'S A MUST GAY.  Okay so Hikki is prone to get jealous when things involve Yukinon, but does Yukinon get jealous when things are about Hikki?  <br> get the 8, making it so that Yukino doesn't have to deal with what she's feeling <br>She did this to force Yukino to confess her feelings however, and make a change in the status-quo.</br></br>  Komachi is so ahead on that poll that now we know who is favored by Irohafags after their goddess.  <br> But there will be plenty of drama on the way. <br>I don't buy it. This amount of drama just to acknowledge everyone's feelings means there will be less once the girls start going for what they want. The only way there will be drama is if 8man is a wishy washy faggot that can't stop leading them both on.</br></br>  <br>you are dumb as fuck</br>  <br>Perhaps.</br>  So I just finished it, I can't believe that's how they ended the episode like what the flying fuck.<br><br>Yui saying ayylmao why dont we all be real and expose our feeling<br>Then it just devolves into hey let's like Yuki help herself and make this facade last forever.<br><br>Not to mention the fish metaphors that made me want to fucking kill myself, like did the writers think they were clever?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude I 100% share the same sentiments holy fuck to the T bro.</br>  Yui: Hey let's a have contest. First one to get pregnant by Hikki gets to keep him.<br>Yukino: I...uh...<br>Hachiman: Do it.<br>Yukino: ok...<br><br>There all we have to do is apply H-logic to everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The big problem is that Chihiro is only parallel on a superficial level. Chihiro won because Keima's feelings for her were so much deeper than the other girls- Iroha is in the exact opposite situation.</br>  <br>There's also some similarities to Shinobu, though not as blatant as the Taiga/Chihiro ones<br> Latecomer of sorts (Shinobu was just a plot device without a single line of dialogue in the first volume) <br> Becomes a major player in the story, is often the protagonist's partner when it comes to work <br> Loads of chemistry and barely-restrained sexual tension <br> Teasing/Flirtatious personality, often has morally questionable motives <br> &gt;Unequivocal best girl <br> Both are associated with 'fakeness" (in Monogatari, supernatural beings are thematically "fake") <br> Both are made "real" by the protagonist (Iroha hearing the genuine speech, Shinobu being turned into a psuedo-human) <br><br>That said Iroha can't quite stand up to the real goddess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  BD sales are at 12000 if any of you care to know.  <br> Yui: Hey let's a have contest. First one to get pregnant by Hikki gets to keep him. <br>It's over.</br></br>  <br>There's no evidence of that. 8man's relationship with the others are superficial as fuck, and he hasn't acknowledged his feelings for Iroha.</br>  <br>SEASON 3 CONFIRMED</br>  <br>We're past 10k already? Impressive.</br>  <br>Date OVA confirmed</br>  <br> mywaifu4laifu </br>  <br>8man has as much as said that he's willing to go through hell to be a part of YY's lives.<br><br>He might feel the same way about Iroha but it's silly to try to draw that conclusion because like you said we haven't seen an indicator of it yet.</br></br></br>  <br> 8man's relationship with the others are superficial as fuck <br>Which is why he took action to go against that, not to mention he actually takes time to get to know YY more than anyone.</br></br>  <br> That said Iroha can't quite stand up to the real goddess. <br>No, get out.</br></br>  COMA CHEESE OR DEATH  <br>Exactly why the arguments for Iroha stop at "they're superficial." The rest of the story is too damning for her case.<br><br>"They're superficial, but they know it, they hate it, and they want to be better"</br></br></br>  Dead thread<br>Dead series<br>Dead fanbase</br></br>  <br>COMA</br>  <br> 8man has as much as said that he's willing to go through hell to be a part of YY's lives. <br> YY's <br>And there you have it. 8man obviously isn't in love with them both, so you can't claim that hey any significant romantic lead on Iroha. Desire to know and be close to people =/= romantic love. It's just his desire for genuineness.</br></br></br>  <br>This thread is going awfully fast by /a/ standards for a dead thread and death fanbase.</br>  <br>Shinobu is literally based. Get the fuck out with your awful opinion</br>  <br><br><br><br>Sure</br></br></br></br>  What's wrong with her?  <br>Nobody said that she wasn't based.<br>But you get the fuck out, there can be only one.</br></br>  <br>The only thing superficial about Iroha is 8man's perception of her.<br><br> I thought Yui was a nice girl <br> I thought Yukino was a strong girl <br>Next is<br> I thought Iroha was a fake girl </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She really doesn't want Hachiman to social suicide again.</br></br>  <br>Shinobu is great and all but nobody wants to derail this into a monogatari thread.</br>  <br>She was desperate to keep him from doing something stupid she starting using his old methods as a solution.<br>He brings that one up before they send him to look for Sagami.</br></br>  <br> Next is <br> &gt;I thought Iroha was a fake girl <br>I like it.</br></br></br>  Genuine end &gt; all  <br>I feel so sorry for Iroha that the only people willing to argue for her case are either trolling or touched in the head.</br>  <br> Iroha's reaction to 8man getting chocolate <br> iroha's reaction to Hayama getting chocolate <br>I'm convinced.</br></br></br>  <br>Id completely forgotten he suggested that last time.</br>  Can you feel it? The end is drawing closer.  <br> Tamanawa reacting <br>I approve</br></br>  <br><br>But she is very fake, like all the time. She openly admits it too.</br></br>  <br><br>Soon it will all come together.</br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> genuine </br></br>  <br>Indeed. It is inevitable.</br>  <br>But she is genuine  to him. </br>  Wow I can't believe people could possibly still like Yukino after we got to see Orimoto and Iroha. I can understand still liking Yui, but those two girls are just leagues above.  <br>I want them to fuck like wild beasts in front of Yukino and Hayama.</br>  <br>Here's your reply, anon.</br>  <br><br>I fail to see that. Orimoto is nothing but HILARIOUS and Iroha is a manipulative bitch that only someone with no self respect would like.</br></br>  <br> Iroha be Seitokaicho you can act all foxxy to Hayama about it <br> great idea! <br><br>You are blind son.</br></br></br></br>  Can someone explain to me why Yukino told Hachiman he didn't understood anything after he solved the StuCo fiasco? What did she really want?  <br>If this is what Watari is going for, Iroha's probably getting rejected next volume.<br> Iroha confesses to 8man, like we're all expecting <br> 8man rejects her, because "not genuine" <br> may get ugly depending on how 8man goes about it <br> 8man is extremely troubled afterward, can't put his finger on why <br> Hayama probably punches him <br> things start going downhill with the club <br> Yui and Yukino realize 8man's caught IROHA OR DEATH and he has no Iroha <br> are forced to settle their differences and let go of 8man <br> 8man may or may not reconcile with Iroha in the end, depending on if Watari wants a bittersweet ending </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  What did she really want? <br><br>To be student council president. He didn't know that, thinking she was just doing that to fulfill the request. Although Haruno gave him a hint he didn't pick up on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't we all?</br>  <br> pre-genuine Iroha <br>Here's your reply.</br></br>  <br> iroha <br> calculative <br> confessing <br>Nah, Yui is the one confessing if anything.<br>Iroha wouldn't pull that unless all the cards were in her favor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not know Hachiman's exact height and that was my baseless assumption using FEEL's Hachiman as a reference.<br><br>In episode two of Oregairu Zoku; Hachiman is taller than Kawasaki, which is impossible, Kawasaki in the light novels is an Amazonian and is taller than her peers. Either, Hachiman hit a growth spurt or that is how Index/Railgun designer draw his male characters. Unless, Kawasaki was lowering her knees because she was scared, I'll have to rewatch the episode.<br><br>I honestly believe Hachiman is around Araragi height, if not slightly taller by a small margin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought Iroha was a fake girl <br> and she was <br> hah, take that Sensei, who is delusional now! </br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately, not everyone has seen the light. Keep spreading the good word, anon.</br>  <br>She won't confess until she know for sure that he will accept her. She confessed to Hayama just to destroy him as false target.</br>  <br><br><br>Why is this old hag constantly hanging around highschoolers again?</br></br></br>  Do you think Haruno is still chaste?  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Out of the ~3 scenes Iroha had last volume, one of them was her confirming 8man's feelings for her.<br><br>There's no way she wasn't setting up for a confession, especially considering she disappeared for the rest of the volume immediately afterward.</br></br></br>  I swear, If Iroha don't win I'm going to japan to commit mass suicide in front of WW house to send a strong message.  <br>Cool, but you should probably start by killing yourself first at home and then proceed to do those other things.</br>  <br>The only thing that she confirmed is that 8man admits being open to her advances now.<br>She's not stupid, she knows about the double YY and dislikes having to compete with them. She won't confess unless she receives a definite green flag from 8man.<br>But I do agree that WW is setting something up with her disappearance in volume 11 after those scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>All part of the plan.<br><br><br> suicide <br> able to send a message <br> in Japan <br>I am afraid you didn't think your cunning plan quite through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the "mass" part that's important here.</br>  <br> All part of the plan. <br><br>what plan?</br></br></br>  <br> mass suicide <br> 1 person <br><br>How does that work?</br></br></br></br>  <br>2nd best girl is so far ahead that it seems unfair.</br>  <br> suicide <br> WW decides to change the ending and Iroha wins <br> you will never see that ending because u ded </br></br></br>  <br> Making her sister strong enough to stand on her own by NTRing her. </br>  <br>Not him but it's worth it if it's for our queen and goddess.</br>  <br>Iroha isn't that calculating, she said she let herself get caught up in the mood when she asked Hayama, and was clearly an emotional wreck afterward.<br><br>The confession was specifically the result of her dropping her calculations.<br><br>Speaking of which<br> Iroha says she was "caught up in the mood" when she confessed to Hayama <br> Her feelings weren't for Hayama <br> 8man says he "took in the mood" immediately before asking Yui out <br><br>Also<br> pic related <br><br>Watari's actually foreshadowed this pretty hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants the 8 inch.</br>  <br>top quality humor</br>  <br>Just like she received a definite green flag from Hayama right?<br><br>8man's the reason she wants genuine in the first place. If she realizes she likes him and is emotionally capable, she'll go for him.</br></br></br>  <br> making 8man used goods in front of her <br>I'm not even an NTRfag but my dick</br></br>  <br>The only reason she threw her calculations away was because she overheard 8man's genuine speech.<br>It's not happening again now that she got her head straight.</br></br>  I don't think Haruno really views Hachiman as anything other than a toy for her amusement right now. An interesting toy, more so than her other one Hayato but a toy nevertheless.<br><br>Now if Hachiman ends up helping Yukino with her issues and even more importantly helping Haruno/Yukino repair their relationship and become close again, that'll melt her panties harder than any GENUINE speech can.</br></br>  <br>That background though</br>  <br>See </br>  <br><br>Would this really make her a stronger person, do you think?I wonder how Yukino would really react to Hachiman fucking her own sister.<br><br>I'll put my faith in Haruno anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense. Iroha told 8man after getting rejected that she wants something genuine. There's no indication she'd just stop caring for no reason.</br>  <br>Go for it. That way it'll just be the sensible Irohafags left, and YYfags can look forward to being greeted to post-series threads with a warm "Iroha~su" without having to worry about your bitching and whining.</br>   Feeling like shit because no more anime <br> Starts listening to the OST <br> Feels even worse <br> Suddenly "Iroha" OST is played <br> Life is a lot better now </br></br></br></br>  <br>Things must be broken before they can be rebuild. I understand it is hard to have faith, but I am proud of you for having it anyway.</br>  <br>I think that's how she saw him before, but at this point <br>she at least sees him as a peer now. She wouldn't bet everything on him fixing Yukino and push him this hard if that wasn't the case.</br></br>  <br>Are there any good Iroha reaction images?</br>  <br><br>Don't be stupid<br><br>If she wanted that all she'd have to do is put his dick in her mouth</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino can still win the 8bowl but know that he's fucking her sister on the side</br>  <br>How would a dere Haruno look like?</br>  <br>How does that makes no sense?<br>She got caught up in the emotional wave of 8man's request, who she also thought was somebody who never went with the mood or strong emotions, and confessed only to see that she had misplaced her feelings.<br> There's no indication she'd just stop caring for no reason <br>Nobody said that, all I'm saying is that she is aware of the double YY competition and I really don't think she'd just confess like that right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nope.jpg</br></br>  <br>She wants to see his full potential before digging in. She's the teen drama Terence Fletcher.</br>  <br>Bully 10x with laughter.</br>   Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe <br><br> I forgot to save the new part 2 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How will Yukino react to finding out Haruno and 8man have already hooked up? Would she cry?  <br>Too beautiful for this earth.</br>  <br> She got caught up in the emotional wave of 8man's request, who she also thought was somebody who never went with the mood or strong emotions <br>Her explanation for that was she started wanting something genuine. She hasn't stopped wanting something genuine, so there's no reason she'd change from how she went with Hayama.<br><br>If she said "getting caught up was a mistake" or something along those lines I'd agree, but she never gave any indication she even regretted confessing to Hayama at that time and place.<br><br> and confessed only to see that she had misplaced her feelings. <br>Also wrong. Iroha didn't give up on Hayama after she confessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you ready for Haruno cuddling?</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U8I<wbr>0kkZhEIM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>The Ice Queen will return with a storm that never ends.</br>  <br><br>It's a mystery. My guess is despite her outward demeanor she would be surprisingly demure and bashful if she was showing a true honest-to-god dere side.</br></br>  <br>yup.png<br><br> “That’s surprising. I thought you weren’t the type of person to get pushed around by the atmosphere like that.” <br> When I told her, Isshiki’s face that was reflected on the window turned into a small smile. <br> “I’m surprised too. I thought it was going to be a lot stiffer too.” <br> “…Yeah, pretending to have a mind full of love makes you pretty clever or something.” <br> As I tried to continue talking, Isshiki suddenly turned her head and interrupted me. <br> “I wasn’t talking about myself… I was talking about senpai.”  <br><br><br>Fucking hell jesus, not that again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd look down, stutter and look sad.</br>  <br> fanart of Haruno <br>Do my eyes deceive me</br></br>  <br><br>The poor girl already has a weak constitution. The shock may very well kill her.</br></br>  <br> Iroha says she was "caught up in the mood" when she confessed to Hayama <br>She said by herself that she was talking about 8man and decided to confess to make a step forward. <br>When she heard his speech about genuine, she decided to become more honest with herself. That is why she got rid of that superficial crush. That was the point where she stopped being two-faced-minx. The paradigm-shift happened because of 8man and she said that.<br><br><br>So it all was calculated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll awknowledge that and go after 8man with the intention of marrying him but always knowing that he'll always prefer Haruno over her</br>  <br><br>Right now she'd kill herself. Especially if Haruno hung it over her head like you know she would.</br></br>  <br>She didn't even answer his statement, she started talking about 8man.<br><br>Your quote says nothing whatsoever.</br></br></br>  <br>If she ends up with 8man she would have to deal with the fact that he's fucking Haruno <br>She can only hope that he prefers herself over her sister</br></br>  <br>I think you mean that's the point where she started being a two-faced minx. I'll even give that she was being slightly more honest in 10.5 and 11 but girl's nowhere near out of the woods yet if she wants to be genuine.</br>  <br><br>That outfit of her's was terrible. With the long blueish skirt.</br></br>  <br>And these tears were not because Hayama dumped her, she didn't love him that much from the beginning.<br>Realization that your Ideals were wrong and getting rid of them is much more scary thing.<br><br><br>No, she's just pretending that she's after Hayama, and that fox mask is not so valuable for her now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All I see is you trying to make an Iroha confession make sense even though the very scene you're referring to shows her admitting being taken over by the mood of the genuine emotional breakdown.</br>  <br> She said by herself that she was talking about 8man and decided to confess to make a step forward.  <br>You're really reaching on what she meant by the "talking about 8man" statement. There's no indication she meant anything other than the "stiffer" comment.<br><br> When she heard his speech about genuine, she decided to become more honest with herself. That is why she got rid of that superficial crush. <br>By asking him out and becoming an emotional wreck upon being rejected? She's not that calculating. Everything about her speech is about how she -stopped- calculating for the Hayama confession.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much do you want to bet that after Yukino and Haruno make real peace, Haruno keeps staying with Yukino at her apartment as friendly sisters now instead of hostile?  <br>Shouldn't you be celebrating at a pride parade somewhere?</br>  <br>How do you know for sure that she's 100% after 8man now? Its never rally developed her enough for us to know that, for all we know she can still be after Hayama and 8man both.</br>  <br><br>I would but I don't have an outfit quite so awful as Haruno's to wear.</br></br>  <br>And all I see is you trying to rationalize Iroha confessing away even though she clearly likes 8man and we're near the end of the series.<br><br>Seriously, what do you expect her to do? Never confess?</br></br></br>  <br> she's just pretending that she's after Hayama, and that fox mask is not so valuable for her now <br>I love how you just assume this is fact without even getting confirmation from the novels</br></br>  <br>You can be as effay as you want around faggots, actually.</br>  <br> “…I’m starting to want something genuine too.” <br> <br> My face turned red to those words. That’s right. When we left the club room that time, we happened to meet Isshiki. I reflexively pushed against my brow. <br> <br> “You were listening…?” <br> <br> “Your voice was leaking out like normal, you know.” <br> <br> When Isshiki nonchalantly replied, I spoke back with a pathetic voice. <br> <br> “…Please forget it.” <br> <br> “I won’t… I can’t.” <br> <br> Isshiki answered with an expression that was more earnest than normal. <br> <br> “That’s why I thought I’d try going forward.”  <br><br>It's literally right there in the novels, I'm convinced you're baiting at this point.<br><br> Everything about her speech is about how she -stopped- calculating for the Hayama confession. <br>Key word - For. She's back at testing her chances with 8man after the hayama incident. Or do you really see volumes 10, 10,5 and 11 as 'going with the flow'?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That kind of begs the question, is deep down Haruno also someone who is very delicate? Or let me put it this way, had her mother not tried to control her life, would Haruno have turned out different? Was she waiting for a Hachiman to save her as well, but it never happened? Or is this just her true nature and regardless of what family she was born into, she would have turned out the same way?</br>  YAHALLO  <br>There's always the post game not-confession when she indirectly tells him how she feels after he picks another girl.</br>  <br>Just reread the whole dialogue, it's hard to not get the meaning.<br><br><br>I don't think she's after any of them, she's flirting with both, and she finds 8man interesting. But the main thing that happened to her was not about romance, but about the change of outlook.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the denialfag refuses to acknowledge her obvious feelings for 8man.<br>The series is ending but the focus will be Yukino's request and Yui's conviction.<br><br>Iroha getting enough romantic focus to confess on a single volume is highly unlikely.</br></br></br></br>   yfw 11.5 volume for Iroha romance <br> confession in 12 </br>  <br><br>Seems like Haruno's personality has been forged by both Yukimom and Yukino.

If anything, Iroha's confession and afterward confession won't be that overtly melodramatic, for now, to stick with the theme of "Huh? Are you making passes at me?"<br> "Huh?

I thought that didn't have a sidebun for her </br></br></br>  <br>Going with the flow for Iroha would be doing a sudden confession again.<br><br>Also, you're forgetting<br> gives him cookies <br> hints not liking having to compete with Yui and Yukino and hints wanting them to fight one another over 8man <br> asks to keep the cookies a secret <br><br>This has gotten tiresome, volume 12 is not going to give her enough romance to confess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All I heard in the last 10 minutes was autism. Like what the actual fuck is with this vague beating around the bush bullshit about m-muh genuine feelings I think I'm actually done with this series.  <br>Side buns where?</br>  Irohasu~  <br>Calm your autism, it was a rough outline. There's no point whatsoever in trying to write entirely specific scenarios early on.<br><br>Also Hayama ships IroHachi, and we've already seen him get irritated at 8man for being dismissive toward her. He'd definitely be furious at 8man for rejecting her.</br></br></br>  <br>See you in six months.</br>  <br> Yukino constantly relying on her turned her into a monster in her own words and gave her this deep seated resentment towards Yukino and disdain for people in general. <br><br>I don't quite know about that. Yukino has definitely had some impact on the way Haruno turned out, I don't think it's that though. It's more likely that she feels resentment towards Yukino because Haruno sacrificed herself to become the head representative of the family, where Yukino who was "inferior" in her mother's eyes, got the chance to be her own person, that didn't need to go to these political meetings etc., however instead of living her life the way she wants, Yukino still tried to emulate Haruno. I think Haruno resents Yukino for the chance she's gotten at a life supposedly free of her mother's interference, yet isn;t really doing much with it and is still trying to be Haruno and meet her mother's expectations in some way.</br></br></br>  <br> Confession won't happen in vol.12, she's not in love with him yet.  <br>Yeah, I feel like right now she has a light crush for 8man. She hasn't showed jealousy until vol 11 and the Orimoto scene is the first time she reacted like that. Still for her to completely fall in love and try to confess, she needs another arc about her, like the bullying and/or  poorfag  issues</br></br>  <br> Going with the flow for Iroha would be doing a sudden confession again. <br> He remembered my birthday, this is the perfect time to confess <br>Sasuga </br></br></br>  remember when oregairu threads were "who /8maninhighschool/ here" and not "im a faggot shipper no better than a 12yr old tumblr girl"<br><br>yeah I hated both seasons' threads UFCK all of you guys  yet I keep coming back </br></br>  <br>y-youre probably right anon</br>  Even hands man is afraid  <br><br>Eh, I got that impression from reading the third memorandum in vol 10. Basically she talks about how being relied and becoming a "monster of reliance" turned her into this person who has a loathing towards other people.<br><br>Essentially I think Haruno is equally fucked up inside as Yukino. They just got messed up in different ways which led to different outcomes. Haruno is a lot more capable and has an agreeable surface facade, but as Hachiman notices instantly there's a much uglier and malicious Haruno underneath.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are just waiting for  Haruno blowing the competition right the fuck out . You'll be free soon.</br>  <br> Yeah, I feel like right now she has a light crush for 8man <br>So you're saying that it's a perfectly reasonable stage for her to ask 8man out.</br></br>  <br>That was me all of yesterday</br>  <br> you only date someone when you're in love with them <br>What happened to "she'll only ask him when it's guaranteed"?<br><br>You're shifting goalposts like crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can mod stuff.</br>  <br>any hints on where to find said mods to speed up a brother's "getting into AA2 for the first time" process?</br>  <br>Actually I may be thinking like that because I read vol.9 before Spyro translated it. <br>That's the key:<br><br> もっと冷めてるんだと思ってました <br><br>Spyro<br> I thought it was going to be a lot stiffer too.” <br><br>Commie<br> Expected "unflappable" but got this instead. <br><br>Me:<br>Iroha said:&gt;I thought you are more cold hearted<br>8man heared:&gt;I thought I'm more cold hearted<br><br><br>My point was:<br>She is not in love with him yet and even if she was, she wouldn't confess to him unless it's for sure.<br><br>I don't really understand what am I shifting...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a general on /vg/. Or there used to be, dunno if it still is.</br></br>  <br>Thanks m8</br>  <br><br><br>We all agree that Iroha is a calculative person, so she would wait for the right moment to make a move and get what she wants. However, depending on her feelings for 8man, in a scale from light crush to Yui's madness:<br><br> Light crush: she won't confess unless she is completely sure she would win <br> Yui's madness: she will confess because her pants would melt everytime her senpai looked at her </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where do I pick up the LNs from after both seasons? Was the anime a good adaptation? I could start from the beginning but I'd prefer to keep going from the anime  <br> She is not in love with him yet <br>You have no evidence she's not. Volume 11 made it very clear she has feelings for 8man.<br><br> and even if she was, she wouldn't confess to him unless it's for sure. <br>You have no evidence for this either. The only previous time she's confessed was far from "guaranteed", and was driven by an ideal she still holds now. Also it's valentine's day.<br><br>If Iroha wasn't preparing for something significant then there would have been no reason for her to be absent from the club during the entire time period between the end of the chocolate event and Yukino staying and Yui's.<br><br>Watari removed her presence from half the novel just to avoid re-establishing the Iroha status quo before volume 12.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime adapted every volume released till now.<br><br>The adaptation was ok until volume 10</br></br></br>  <br>From the beginning. There's a lot of fun stuff cut out of the first half and important stuff cut out of the second. If you really want to pick up where the anime left off, see you in 6 months when volume 12 is released.</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll just read it from the beginning then</br></br>  <br>fite me</br>  <br> If Iroha wasn't preparing for something significant then there would have been no reason for her to be absent from the club during the entire time period between the end of the chocolate event and Yukino staying and Yui's. <br>In the anime she was cut out, in the LN she gave him chocolate in secret as to not start something with YY and probably went to look for Hayato.</br></br>  this is how I see the story ending based on my understanding of the characters and current information and understanding of the story<br><br> the situation with hayama's family and yukinoshita's family is revealed to have some dark secret that allows Haruno to maintain a hold similar to blackmail <br> the situation with yugihama, yukinoshita, and hachiman's love triangle is quite obvious to hachiman, but he is a good judge of his own personality <br> the last events of the story is kicked in motion when Miura asks the service club to help her figure out why Hayama has been becoming more distant as graduation approaches <br> Hachiman, depending on what the situation is, blows it sky high by exposing it <br> Yukinoshita's family reputation is stained, though not irreparably damage <br> Mama Yukinoshita goes haywire, and takes it out on everyone including Haruno <br> Haruno in turn takes it out on Hachiman by sabotaging his attempts to enter college since she cannot toy with Hayama anymore <br> Hayama stands up for Hachiman, slipping in his one-sided childhood crush for Haruno has been dispelled <br> Hayama approaches Miura, who heard of the exposed "blackmail", and discusses his facade being a fake, and how he wants to start over with her <br> Yukino's lack of self problems are not quite resolved as it will be through time now that her mothers hold on her is not quite as strong anymore <br> Yui confesses to Hachiman, but Hachiman realizes his personality would make an unsustainable relationship and rejects her. Yui distances herself and becomes a friendly acquaintance to Hachiman, though still is friends with Yukino, <br> Yukino may also confess, though it might just be a silly childish crush because Hachiman "saves" her and instead stays friends. <br> Hachiman and Iroha are hinted to have become closer, but no sign of a relation until much later in their lives is suggested due to Hachiman's personality. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah</br></br>  <br>Ending:<br> Hachiman wakes up in hospital after the dog-saving-car accident <br> he's been in a coma <br> it was all a dream <br> he's still a loner <br> ~fin~ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ur p. gay</br>  <br>The only "significant" thing about Iroha's absence in the second half was that she didn't matter in the slightest to the events going on there.</br>  <br><br>I think the only line in all of this that is true or has any real chance being true is the one about the love triangle being obvious to Hachiman.</br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br>I have to give him credit for trying to pretend he's not delusional by adding a caveat to Iroha winning the 8bowl though.</br>  I don't care if she wins or not I just want to see 8man actually hit on Iroha once  Does anyobody have a gif/webm of "shaa~"?  <br>Good job little pedo. Let ya momma know ya have shit taste.</br>  <br> &gt;もっと冷めてるんだと思ってました <br> Spyro <br> &gt;I thought it was going to be a lot stiffer too.” <br> Commie <br> &gt;Expected "unflappable" but got this instead. <br><br>What the hell were they thinking when they translated this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm not delusional, if I'm wrong then its because I don't understand the characters and story well enough yet<br><br>all that aside I just can't see hachiman getting together with yui and yukino due to how self-aware of his shitty personality he is</br></br></br>  <br>Forget it, the closer we'll get is his 嫌いじゃねぇけど which is, at least in terms of romcom, quite close to it. But still, we won't be seeing it happen.<br>If 8man does explicitly hit on Iroha, that'd mean that he wants her 100% and since he's 8man and WW is writing the story, just forget it.</br></br>  Hayama Hayato never had a frivolous rumor like this before. So if it’s about whom he was going out with, of course, it’s going to be about him. It wouldn’t be strange at all. The girls who held interest in Hayama likely had their misgivings about it. And those misgivings actualized into this rumor. Just what kind of effect would that have on the human relationships surrounding Hayama?<br><br>“…A rumor, huh? Rather karmic, isn’t it?” Yukinoshita muttered. Her tone wasn’t directed at anyone. The tea cup she was looking at had formed small ripples.<br><br>I kind of think this confirms what happened to Hayato and Yukino when they were younger. They hung out with one another because of their families. Girls in their school thought they were dating and starting bullying Yukino. Hayato didn't stand up for her, he choose to preserve his popularity. Yukino felt betrayed, and hasn't talked to him since, up until the end of volume 10, where she somewhat forgave him. Or am I reaching?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're missing a lot then, because his personality has slowly improved over the course of the story, but he's gotten much, much better since genuine.</br>  <br>8man stop being a hinedere</br>  <br>Jesus, stop, you´re even worst than the guy you try to put down. Never write again.</br>  <br> commie <br> thinking </br></br>  <br><br>Commies' line is actually acceptable but still misleading.<br>Basically she said:<br> I expected cold-heartedness <br>Meaning: I expected Senpai to be more cold-hearted to say such things (about genuine).<br>8man thought that she was thinking of herself as more cold-hearted and capable of handling rejection easily.<br>That's why she corrected herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his personality has improved, but not to the point where he can maintain a relationship without it blowing up<br><br>he's been a loner for a huge majority of his life, its ingrained in him deeper than he would like and its not a good mentality to have in a romantic relationship.<br><br>if he initiates a relationship with yukino, without yui to bridge their personalities it would just grow cold and distant. if he initiates a relationship with yui, yui may tire of trying to constantly coax hachiman out of his shell and it will accumulate into an extremely explosive situation that may not end well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah that's one way of looking at it. Most believe Yukino did in fact have feelings for Hayama in elementary school. Or at least as much as an elementary school kid can actually have those feelings. But Hayama only had (and has) eyes for Haruno.<br><br>I've always thought of it not that Hayama choose not to protect Yukino but that he tried to and failed. Just like he can't really solve any problems in the present and has to run to Hachiman, he couldn't then either because he's too wrapped up in that aww shucks nice guy facade everyone expects. Not being able to protect Yukino might have poisoned Haruno's opinion of him to some extent which combined with the fact that he doesn't hate Yukino now (even if he's not in love with her) is why he feels so much regret about what happened then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the clarification. I didn't really understand what was she trying to say both in LN and anime</br>   DAYONE?   You are all discussing girls' love affairs.<br><br>You might as well be watching mexican soap operas.</br></br>  <br>What exactly is your point? Do you think her entire character development up to this point was just to give 8man some platonic chocolate?</br>  <br>But Carlos doesn't love any of the girls.</br>  <br>So basically blind speculation because you're so far gone suicide is the only option if Iroha loses, got it.<br><br>I hope you can find some other source of meaning for your life soon, anon.</br></br></br>  Why did the debate switch from what would happen with YY to "Iroha will confess next volume and she'll get rejected?  <br>but mexicans are the polar opposite of anime</br>  <br>Commie doesn't translate. For every show other than Yahari all they do is steal and fuck up perfectly acceptable subs.<br><br><br>I don't know what's supposed to be acceptable about gibberish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fags want to deny in any possible way the undeniable.</br>  <br>I think he broke out of his shell quite a bit. Notice Yukino acting surprised at the aquarium date when 8man was acting like he was having a good time. She did not expect that of him.</br>  nice to see these threads are still kickin  <br>Because there's nothing wrong with switching from drama discussion to romantic subplot discussion.<br>Also falseflags, falseflags everywhere.</br></br>  <br> try discuss why I'm wrong and presenting what I believe <br> the moment the discussion can't be concluded in two replies you immediately devolve to shitposting <br><br>i mean i guess I should have known better</br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohafags</br>  <br>Because the YY situation is so ambiguous at this stage of the story that any concrete predictions on it are just fanwank. Nobody has any clue what Yukino's request might be.<br><br>Iroha's confession on the other hand has to happen at some point, and the series is ending soon.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the most popular show of the past season, after all. Pic related.<br>And this was made last week, so we're above three hundred threads over bump limit now.</br></br>    <br> mfw I've read all those 300 threads </br>  <br>Yukino's request is going to be  "Will you be my friend?" </br>  <br>Same here.</br>  <br> If he initiates a relationship with Yukino, without Yui to bridge their personalities it would just grow cold and distant <br> without Yui to bridge their personalities <br> Yui to bridge <br>Do you even read the LN?

I only know about it because it appeared on nyaa, looks like it might not be shit</br></br></br></br></br>  I have hopes this will be good. Seiji Kishi is a solid director. Though Lerche may be stretched this this season.  <br>It's good if you like obnoxious and generic characters</br>  I think 5 centimeters per second was Shinkai's greatest work and is one of the best romance anime movies of all time.  <br>Did you have to post those credits?</br>  <br>This is an unpopular opinion?</br>  So you are underage?  I bet you also think KyoAni is the best anime studio.  <br>It's practically a meme to hate on Shinkai's work on /a/.</br>  I think 5 centimeters per second is shit  <br>It is though</br>  It had pretty pictures. I guess that's it.  FMP is shit.<br><br>Second raid, Fumoffu, it's all terrible.</br></br>  <br><br>I personally don't like it, at all, it's a discrete hermetic love story at best.<br>A bunch of people tend to shit on shinkai though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The truth is always unpopular anon.</br></br>  Bakemogatari is worse Mononoke, where mysteries were degraded to wordplays. And almost all girls were annoying bitches. <br>Snail was the worst.</br>  The quality of an anime is subjective.<br>Overrated is a retarded word. If you don't like something you can say so without implying that everyone who thinks otherwise is wrong.</br>  <br>I wouldn't call it complete shit, since some parts with serious fights were okay.

Aren't you being a little too contrarian there?</br>  <br>I don't think that's an unpopular opinion</br>  <br>Holy shit and here I was thinking that I was the only one who thought this.</br>  It's not a duel solely between Kyoani and Shaft for who the best studio is cause neither are.<br><br>Monogatari is not the greatest anime ever made, it's actually pretty bad and obnoxious<br><br>Urobuchi and Nasu are not the greatest possible writers for anime series, they're actually kind of just main children who are best left coming up with ideas for things rather than writing about them.</br></br></br></br>  Harem/best girl anime is all shit  <br> ntr <br>What?

They try to make the lead as bland as possible so the audience can self-insert, and all the love interests are made so that the target audience will want to bang them. It's the lowest form of writing there is. There's no attempt to tell a story or say something important or develop the characters in any meaningful way. It's essentially soft-core pornography.

I like Howl's moving castle the most of Ghibli movies.  <br>all this shit taste</br>  <br>dropped halfway</br>  <br>Me too, shit is too magical.</br>  <br>this, shaft directing sheningans was the good thing in szs, other than the soundtrack that is</br>  <br>Is this really an unpopular opinion?</br>  Bakemonogatari was the only one worth watching in the series.  <br>Also, all his series are the same.</br>  <br>Neko Black was fine.</br>  Non Non Biyori isn't fantastic. It's just kinda nice. I could never call it AOTY but I avoid that term anyway.  <br>And nobody was trying to put those magic in any laws. That was brilliant.</br>  It's catchy https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x8p<wbr>61BmsDpo</wbr>  [ ]  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127490378 <br>Watch more anime.<br> tbh </br></br></br>  Oyasumi Punpun is the greatest piece of literature about growing up that currently exists in this universe.  I hate incest in anime (in real life too).  <br>that's not a very good idea considering the pattern it has (it takes until the end to reveal everything and how it connects and does it well).<br><br>and even then most of the characters are still not assholes.</br></br></br>  <br>wasnt even his best work</br>  <br>What do you like?</br>  <br>I think he just misunderstood the whole thing.</br>  <br>I don't know why people are bothered by incest. I mean they aren't your mother/sister/cousin/aunt<br><br>I guess it's because I don't have a sister that I don't feel guilt about the MC fucking his.</br></br></br>  <br>i know i should finish it, just couldn't bring myself to do it.</br>  <br>I disagree<br><br><br>agree with you there though</br></br></br></br>  /a/ doesn't know what "directing" means<br><br> Got tired of caring about that, anyway </br></br>  <br>Since anime is just cut and paste of manga most of the time directing is not really an issue unless it's a movie or OVA.</br>  <br>To be honest i more than actual incest hate how it's okay and even promoted in some series.<br><br>And yep, i have siblings</br></br></br>  <br>The others are entertaining enough if you like the franchise but it's definitely the best by a wide margin.<br><br>For all of the outrageous backgrounds in the newer ones not one manages to be as stylish.</br></br></br>  <br>I self-inserted as the cute surfer girl.</br>  Girls also watch anime, and they're not only fujoshi <br>there are also girls on 4chan</br>  <br>I agree with you.</br>  <br>Paprika is shit.</br>  <br>Madoka's bad.</br>  The second half of Death Note was better than the first.<br>Cowboy Bebop is shit aside from how charming Spike is.<br>Kill la Kill&gt;TTGL (both are shit though).<br>SamFlam has no flaws.<br>The Kancolle anime adaptation was fine.<br>Toradora is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Part 2 is the best JoJo part.<br>RahXephon has amazing character/technical designs, really just fantastic.<br>David did DIO's World justice minus some weird faces.<br>Welcome to the NHK had a good dub.<br>Gen Urobuchi is great at setups but writes underwhelming ends. <br>Yoko Kanno is the best anime composer.<br> dub Asuka &gt; sub Asuka </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, the anime went all baww over Light's death<br>Showed him in a better light<br>The manga ending is where it's at<br>An ugly death for an ugly person</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not an unpopular opinion. This is:<br>The average anime nowadays looks better than 30 years ago.</br></br>  <br>Most of the "slice of life" people refer to are more 癒し系 slice of life and less 成熟期 slice of life you are referring to. "Slice of life" isn't an actual genre.</br>  <br> shortest <br>There are 2 Shinkai anime, both are only 5 minutes long and both are also about cats.</br></br>  <br>most of the time it's not blood related <br><br>or they are cousins which in Japan (and some States in the US) their allowed to marry</br></br></br>  <br>I often think that the anime was made in Light's perspective and the manga was made in Ryuk's.</br>  <br>/a/ hasn't changed in the last 5 years, people have just gotten older and more bored with anime</br>  <br><br>Movie is suck tbh but The Novel is Great</br></br>  <br> Part 2 is the best JoJo part. <br> Welcome to the NHK had a good dub <br>OP said unpopular opinions not popular</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ went from /b/ to /jp/ to /v/</br>  90% of anime is  okay   <br>read the manga, fag</br>  <br>cousin's relationship doesn't bother me, just those between siblings</br>  I enjoy anime.  <br>Not really, 06-08 /a/ was a fucking shithole worse than we have now. Anyone who goes back to nearly any thread during that time can see how shit it was.</br>  <br>most people on here seem to favor 4 and 7 from what i've seen.</br>  Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa has a bad art.  It baffles me that people can be proud of being so undiscerning that they watch nearly everything that airs.  <br>it was 09 when it shifted to /jp/ mode</br>  <br>This, god damn it, it's awful and I'm glad we're never getting s3. Kyoani might be mediocre but at least it's usually better than fmp</br>  Touhou posters should be banned like mlp posters.  <br>Overrated does not mean shit. It just means it is over rated from what it really is</br>  <br> reason to be sad  <br>I forgot depression was an intellectual process. <br><br>Autism, man. The complete lack of ability to discern human emotions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>part 4 is araki's favorite <br>so it gets discussed quite often as araki releases new material of it<br>part 7 is actually good, though</br></br></br>  <br>from the Weg threads you understand that some anime looks like they're going one way but ends up going another.</br>  Most of tsunderes is a shit. Little maggots beating MC for no reason, getting angry over normal things, etc.  <br>Code Geass is  one of the better Mech animes </br>  <br>that's not unpopular</br>  In 20 years this decade will be considered the golden age of anime.  <br> part 4 is araki's favorite <br>interesting, i didn't know that actually. i always assumed 5 would be his favorite.</br></br>  <br>yet that seems unpopular for people who make anime.<br><br>Generally lots of anime nowadays have no ideas for female characters and make them into just few categories: loli, big sister-type and tsundere (other dere)</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga, also  TTGL was really fun for a mech except for simons depression arc which went on way to fucking long </br>  I wish there was more metal/rock pieces in anime soundtracks. Wish to heard symphonic metal in anime just once.  <br>For SOL and CGDCT, I would think it is now.</br>  <br>Females characters in anime are some of the worst written in fiction. Always falling into the same Jap tropes, with only haircolour seriously separating some of them. Manga is much better at making interesting female characters</br>    <br>yep, it's hard to find good female characters in anime. <br>btw: Noa from Patlabor one of the best</br></br>  Ore Monogatari is shit  <br>Most any anime can be 10/10 when watching it as it airs with /a/</br>  <br>This basically works with anything, see /tv/ or /co/ when something is airing. Increases the fun had massively</br>  <br>Voices of a Distant Star was fucking garbage. Who would have thought Makoto Shinkai would have directed an ova with the worst CG and ugliest character designs I've ever seen</br>  <br>Rin Tohsaka pleases Luvia for money.</br>    <br> thinking an anime is complete garbage based only on animation and art style <br>Yeah, I didn't like it either, but it doesn't make it garbage.</br></br>  It's alright  If /a/ gets hyped about something and then calls it shit, I usually end up liking it<br><br><br>Musical based anime are highly over rated<br><br>anime where the show is 75% 'cute girls doing cute things' is almost always shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinkai is pretty with no substance.</br>  <br>They guy was an obsessive psycho.</br>  I don't actually like anime. For seasonal stuff I just visit the threads and for older anime I read the synopsis on wikipedia.  <br> literally doesn't realize that "objective" isn't used with serious intent on 4chan  <br><br>wow</br></br></br>  <br><br> anime where the show is 75% 'cute girls doing cute things' is almost always shit <br><br>this is why i omits shows that have mostly girls on poster pictures</br></br></br></br>  /a/ is highly hipster and most anime sucks. <br><br>Japan's writing capabilities are some of the worst in the world.</br></br>  <br> Yoko Kanno is best anime composer <br>My fucking nigga</br></br>  Can't we stop having these shitty threads?  <br>The story was garbage too I just didn't feel like mentioning that</br>  I'm actually looking forward to Rebuild 4.<br> If only for the Utada Hikaru end credits song. </br>  <br> Musical based anime are highly over rated <br>This</br></br>  <br> Japan's writing capabilities are some of the worst in the world. <br>Except shitting on anything Japan is popular on /a/. People suffering from a special version of the weeb syndrome, see: http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/David_<wbr>Aldwinckle for an example of /a/ in Japan.</wbr></br></br>  <br>No one is claiming that the word itself is always used seriously but a good portion of the discussion here wouldn't happen without an objectivistic mindset.</br>  <br>Is most of /a/ not looking forward to it?<br>I'm gonna be hype as fuck</br></br>  <br>are you talking about rhapsody type stuff?</br>  <br>i don't understand.</br>  <br> that link <br><br>what in the fuck</br></br></br>  /a/ is basically the same as mal/reddit/etc the only problem is the rules or more relaxed and you can samefag shit opinions  <br> implying humans can exist that don't like bacon </br>  <br>Rebuild 4 is going to kill /a/</br>  <br>Was thinking more about Avantasia, but Rhapsodyis also okay</br>  <br> Musical based anime are highly over rated <br>But muh Symphogear.</br></br>  <br>and we all are going to watch it<br>to see our hopes killed</br></br>  <br>I wish anime musicals were a thing, especially after that Kurenai episode.<br><br>You'd think people would have tried to ape Disney but I guess they just don't have the same musical culture.</br></br></br>  <br> Kanno "steals" music a lot <br>https://<span>youtu.be/yupIJUbFNFg  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Part 2 *was* the best jojo part. They even kept the glorious nonsensical ED.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure /a does legitimately seem to unconditionally accept the Monogatari series, but that's about it. It's kind of a fitting anime to be /a's favorite in a lot of ways.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear isn't a horrible offender, I mean shit like Nodame, Hibike, &lt;insert HighSchool musical anime here&gt;. It's almost always the same plot and plot twists, and almost is always about shipping yaoi or yuri, without any discussion on what is going on in the show.</br>  I really  liked  it  <br><br>Thank you. Seriously I cannot see the fucking difference for the most parts. Same kinds of opinions, same kind of favorites, same kind of over the top hyperbolic language being used, literally as you say the only difference is you can same fag all you want.</br></br>  <br>Shit I meant baiting, why the hell did I type shipping</br>  <br><br>Not true. For example, /a/ shits on Yahari while there is nothing but praise everywhere else.</br></br>  <br><br>Then why are you here?</br></br>  <br>It's all the same shit, but since I have been on 4chan so long the quickness in conversation is really fucking addicting.</br>  <br><br>That's just how it is with the fanbase of anime today period. The more they shit on something the more I seem to enjoy it and the more the praise something the more indifferent I tend to be to it. This happens a fucking lot. It doesn't help that a lot of people seem to have super limited taste and the amount of people that appreciate and watch things that don't practically come out of the doujin scene in a lot of ways doesn't help. You'd think the popular LN/VN scene was the be all end all these days.</br></br>  <br>Kill La Kill was AOTY.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much answered my question. It's all the same shit anywhere you go nowadays practically but when I'm bored sometimes at least there's a lot of topics to move through and the off chance you might find something interesting. Plus the anonymity is kind of nice for avoiding those annoying stalker types you sometimes get on other sites that like to follow you around from thread to thread if they really disagree with you. It's somehow against all odds the lesser of evils, but not by much and I think that's more a result of how bad pretty much all other boards have gotten recently than a feather in /a's cap.</br></br>  <br>This so much.<br>Anime might be considered high-brow only very seldomly but Bakemonogatari sure isn't, I know that much.<br>Incredibly dull pseudo-intellectual rambling about nothing interesting and fanservice that borders on egregious in how jarring it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I agree, I mainly just hate it when people go "oh man fuck off to mal/reddit/etc with your tastes", because in all honesty it's all the same crap, just different basket</br>  <br>and i hate how they ramble about any image from tumblr, even if it's some nice stuff.</br>  <br>oh man fuck off to mal/reddit/etc with your tastes</br>  <br><br>No, mal/reddit/etc love shit like Yahari and Fate/Shit, /a/ actually has taste and sees through that bullshit.</br></br>  <br>You know how many fate threads there were last season? I mean, nearly bump limit every few hours</br>  <br>Are you delusional? Are you serious blind to the huge Fate following on /a/?</br>  <br>You've gone too far</br>  <br><br>Those threads are populated by redditors who have invaded /a/. I wouldn't count them as /a/, just like how I don't consider Naruto shitters part of /a/ either.</br></br>  <br>Going back to my point, "it's all the same shit"</br>  <br><br>I really don't think so but I also can completely understand you.<br>Also there are people who call it a bad film and that just baffles me.<br>It might lose in comparison to Miyazaki's other films, save for Ponyo, but I've seen films so shit that calling Bowel's Moving Gassle bad is an insult to the whole artform of animated cinema.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, there's been type moon fags here for a long time.</br>  <br>But it isn't.</br>  <br>So you are delusional and only believe this narrative you've imagined for yourself.<br><br>Sometimes people like things you don't, you don't have to create reasons for it and convince yourself they are different from you.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, i actually know that other Miyazakis movies are objectively better, but something in Howl's Castle is just charming me to it</br>  <br> I wouldn't count them as /a/, just like how I don't consider Naruto shitters part of /a/ either. <br><br><br>OH MAN WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THIS BEFORE?!?!? If we just ignore the shit we don't like and pretend it isn't here everything is so much better!<br><br>Brb going to go watch Triage X and block out all the bad parts, just like every anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay back from watching TriageX, awesome show once you skip/ignore the bad and parts you don't like</br>  <br> imagined <br><br>Look into the threads. They reek of reddit. It's a similar situation to /tv/ and Game of Thrones.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Were you trying to get a point across with these cringe worthy posts?</br></br>  <br>just making a joke</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127493181 <br>Here are some epic lele maymay  reddit/tumbler approved <br> Boku no Newfag <br> Summer wa Monogatari <br> Neon Faggot Genesiscon <br> Shokugeki no Digimon <br> Yahari ore no summerfag <br> Full Metal Fuckoff <br> Owari no Modsplz </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it reek of reddit or does it reek of people who think differently of you?</br>  <br>That's what memes are for.

But a few perhaps, but we have a instinct against them for a reason, a genetic memory to hate them and try to destroy them.<br><br><br>Laputa, well it was his own mixture of an advanced society that was in real life parodying spain (la puta means whore in spanish)<br><br>porco was about a pig, the flying witch was about carrying groceries about 100 miles from where I live in a old swedish city.

I see people calling it overrated while praising Mononoke but I think Totoro is his most personal film. It's a wonderful look into the imaginative mind of children, there's an outstanding level of nuance in the character movements. Each frame fills me in sheer nostalgic joy, we are taken back into that period of blissful innocence.  <br>Ponyo is one of his best works.  ITT unpopular opinions. </br>  Anons who care about how many threads a series has are pure cancer.  <br> He does not hire professional VA, I remember he talked about it but forgot if he said a reason why. <br>He usually hires actors, because in her opinion most of VAs are faking their voices too much and don't feel like real people.<br><br> AVOID his son's movies like tales of the earthsea and that other one. <br>From on Puppy Hill is acceptable.<br><br> that girl of the wind(no her name is insane to spell out) was wrong. <br>Nausicaa manga is miles better, the movie barely covers what Miyazaki had on his mind when he started writing the story.<br><br> Laputa, well it was his own mixture of an advanced society that was in real life parodying spain (la puta means whore in spanish) <br>That joke comes from the original Gulliver books. The author was indirectly calling the Queen of England a whore.<br><br>Have you watched The Wind Rises?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>You piqued my interest so I went over to r/anime and lurked for a while.

However if you're trying to build something on top of nothing it is going to be confusing at best and grossly inefficient at worse. We're not babies - we don't NEED to learn like them.

There are various levels of moeshit. It doesn't have to be kawaii uguu to be moeshit.</br>  <br>Not wanting to use moe as a synonym for cute, since it isn't, is being a weeaboo?

Into the trash it goes.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127494161 <br>I'm sorry Bateman-sama I hope I won't be disappointing you anymore and pray that you forgive my humble self.</br>  <br>No, people are being called crossboarders for shitposting about "moeshit" and "manime". Which is still stupid, since this flavor of shitflinging has been around for longer than most of the retards currently engrossed in it.</br>  Crossboarders are an even bigger boogeyman than IRC was.  <br>It's not as much calling people crossboarders for watching anything other than "moeshit," as much as it is people rightly stating that anyone who uses "moeshit" unironically does not belong on /a/, as it is an inflammatory term intended solely to troll /a/'s largest fanbase.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127494161 <br>What's your opinion on the matter Mr. Bateman?</br>  <br>It was never believable because the unique IP counter in the threads for said shows downright proves the second sentence is bullshit.</br>  <br>There's always something I tell myself when making a good milkshake; "never put cherries in your milkshake. It's not a cerryshake." and that makes me wonder to my already-wondering self. Why is it a milkshake if it's not shaken milk? Haha<br>But I digress. Maybe it's not a 'milkshake', but more of an 'ice-sludge', I mean most of it isn't even milk, unless you create THOSE kinds with extra milk. Those are the kinds you give to someone with either:<br><br>1. Shit taste (literally)<br>2. You hate them very much<br><br>However, when trying to make a good shake (chocolate is a good flavor mmmmm) you should add some peanut butter, Nesquick™, and only some milk. Some.<br><br>But the main problem is that, if you add too much peanut butter, it becomes thick, distasteful and burns your throat if you gut it down. If you add too much milk, it becomes watered down to the point that not even sewage-peasants© will try it. If you add too much Nesquick™? Then nothing happens. You can never have too much Nesquick™.<br><br>So when you're making a good shake, remember to keep it balanced. And by balanced, I mean no cherries. Haha<br><br>~~~One Man's Milkshake is Another Man's Cherryshake~~~</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hibike is the KlK of the season.<br><br>Overrated, sells mediocre with a shit tier fanbase.</br></br>  <br>Good thing I dropped that shit at episode 3</br>  <br>KLK &gt; Kekkai and Mako is the roundest.</br>  <br>Wut<br>How much KlK sold?

Next season is looking wonderful with NNB and Working, though.</br>  <br> implying those were kekkaifags <br>People only use it because the sales makes it easy to bait moefags.

Dragon is not dumb like Luffy?</br>  Any chinks itt? Does Jesus say ``brother'' or ``brothers''?  <br>Mangastream is one of the best scanlations.</br>  <br>They aren't claiming to have taken him out and they aren't covering anything up; they're doing the opposite.</br>  <br>he doesn't seem to be. He is a monkey D. though so he probably has some quirks</br>  <br>Can't wait for the PC release of Pirate Warriors and the glorious nude mods</br>  <br><br>Niggastream is even worse.</br></br>  <br> niggerstream <br> good <br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I reckon it's all a persona/front to lead the revs, whereas deep down he's a goofball like his father and his son. <br><br>But he's clearly intelligent though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not really, they are a million times better than shitpanda but thats not hard but they still have many translation erros and their fucking nigger language makes me want to tear off my scrotum. Powermanga is the best by far, but sadly slow as fuck and since we are all impatient faggots we could never wait for them to catch up.</br>  <br>He and Kuzan are are on the side of honorable justice. They do what's right, not just follow orders blindly (pardon the pun).</br>  <br>Just wait for Viz translations</br>  <br> Akainu confronts Fujitora <br> Fujitora tells him he did what was right and that he knows Akainu will punish him <br> Akainu says was it worth dying for <br> Fujitora explains he knows what happened between him and Aokiji and that he doesn't kill fellow admirals <br> Akainu magma fists him and tells him he doesn't know shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cover story has his eyes be super duper kawaii eyes </br>  <br> doflamingo is secretly a bishie <br> Covers his eyes to keep bitches off him similar to senor pink </br></br>  <br>Wasn't Sabo the eldest to begin with?<br><br>Pretty sure Sabo was older than Ace. Wiki tells me so too. That's why he set sail first.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Kuzan is more ambiguous. I don't think he would bow or apologize. <br><br>He still destroyed Ohara, killed his friend Saul, gave Spandam the golden Den Den Mushi, joined the Blackbeard Pirates, etc.</br></br></br>  <br> implying based Fujitora won't just block magma fist with his sword/haki just like Shanks did. </br>  <br>So Akainu is Lawful Evil, Kizaru is Chaotic Neutral, Fujitora is Lawful Good and Kuzan is Lawful Neutral.</br>  <br>Weren't all of the executives captured? Who would the cover story even be about?</br>  <br>Lawful Good? Woah now. Let's not go crazy. Blind dude has only done the things he did this arc for his own personal vendetta against the shichibukai.</br>  <br> joined the Blackbeard Pirates <br>Wait, what? When was this?</br></br>  <br>He epicly trolled you, man.</br>  So what now? Luffy has become the precise thing he did not want to become. A hero, with full media coverage and international notoriety to boot.<br>Are Fujitora and his crew a separatist faction within the world government, or are they moles aiming to change it from within? Are they possibly at odds with the Tenryubito? Goddammit you can't call Luffy a pirate any more, just have Sabo draft him and Fuji into the revolutionary army already.</br>  <br>Except until this chapter where he showed he didn't give a fuck if his boss sees him being humble and prostrating himself to the former king. He knew that this stuff going on was wrong, and the World Govt new the whole time. He's basically admitting the World Govt is fucked up.</br>  <br>People think he joined them but all we know is that him and blackbeard have some sort of relationship because Burgess told blackbeard not to trust Aokiji</br>  <br><br><br> forgot the picture</br></br></br>  <br> revolutionary second in command <br> a man who declared war on the government, punched a Tenryuubito, broke into and out of prison, and invaded Marineford twice <br> a traitorous Shichibukai who betrayed the WG and had temporarily lost his title <br> ex-government scientist arms dealer <br> other pirates and criminals with a total bounty in the billions <br> all allowed to run free to prove a point to the Gorosei <br><br>Akainu is mad as fuck. Plus bowing is humiliating. <br><br>Maybe we'll see Green Bull</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile tears, mang. By admitting blame for this he casts more doubt on the shichibukai. That's what he's after. Undeniably ulterior motives for his actions. He's not a good guy.</br>  <br>Bad, bad typesetting.</br>  <br>I hope we cut to him the very next chapter<br><br><br>I don't think any artist is capable of demonstrating how mad he would actually be<br><br>It would be like that hitler video where gets dubbed except magma and corpses are everywhere</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127482064 <br>Fucking go die on a ditch stupid frogposter</br>  <br>All of Arlong's crew were captured too <br>  its about Monet and Vergo </br></br>  <br> "Weren't Baroque Works captured? Who would the cover story even be about?" <br><br>I need to stop visiting these threads. The number of people who have either read One Piece once or not at all is getting overwhelming</br></br></br>  <br><br>Here's what I never understood - why the fuck didn't Arlong go to ID?</br></br>  <br><br>are there any fishman in ID?<br><br>They probably segregate by species</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jimmy-B went to Impel Down.</br>  <br><br>Ah maybe - Jinbe was, but that would be because of Shichibukai.</br></br>  <br>Except the BW cover story followed Goldenweek, Valentine, and 5. None of which were captured at Little Garden.<br><br>Although  Is probably right.</br></br></br>  Holy shit that ending was amazing<br>How many big shots will be tracking down Luffy and Law now that it's public they took down Doffy?<br>Will Yonkous go after them to talk and form alliances now?</br></br>  <br>Probably send them to the desert hell level. Worst fate for a fish.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga holy shit. Arlong was imprisoned in ID already and was released when Jinbei became a warlord<br><br>He was probably considered to be of greater importance the first time he was sent there since the Sun Pirates were such a big deal (that and being caught by Borsalino). He's more of a shitter now and his defeat and capture wasn't as significant</br></br></br>  I'm excited for what'll happen to Usopps name. If this is a Alabasta mirror, key individuals will get recognized like Zoro and Luffy were. God Usopp can't just disappear, right? <br><br> Good arc to be an Ussopfag </br></br>  <br><br>He was still a Level 1 or even Level 2 level prisoner though with his bounty and history, just surprising.</br></br>  <br>There has to be more fishman than arlong or jinbe<br><br>I cant remember a single one other than those two in impel down and those were super special circumstances.<br><br> All those prisoners we got to see seems like there would have been a bunch of namless fishman in there<br><br>They didnt seem to have any other races in their either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably just plot. Arlong would not have played along with Luffy's escape game. He only had a 20 million bounty, so he'd be on the first floor with Buggy. Maybe he just slipped out and dove into the ocean during the chaos<br><br>In Jinbe's cover story when he finds the upside down towns, for a second I thought it was Arlong flipping over towns again<br><br><br>Thats true, you'd need an HQ escort to get him from East Blue to ID, and thats probably more trouble than its worth. They didn't even hunt down Morgan when he escaped</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It feels like assistants are drawing the majority of these chapters with all the filler stock reaction faces and purposely slow pacing everywhere.  <br>Usopp can't be recognised or it'll break the liar story dealie he's got going on. His hometown can't ever know that he's a famous pirate and has gone on crazy adventures when he returns.</br>  <br>Yes, and Mr. 2 broke out himself, every agent reunited, and most escaped. Considering this is Doflamingo, something similar could easily happen with one breaking out or Doffy having more men behind the scenes.</br>  <br> implying most fishmen wouldn't simply be executed <br> implying most fishmen aren't shitters that arent worth Impel Down <br> implying Arlong wasn't just barely worth Impel Down even during a time when Fishmen were at their peak of piracy <br> implying several giants weren't imprisoned (and said to be in consideration Dorry and Broggy) in Impel Down <br><br>Jinbei and Fisher were special cases, even Hody only managed to be almost New World level, and it took him overdosing to the point that his life was shortened to a few hours at most.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, God Ussop is a thing that would spread, it would be funny to see if it gets twisted somehow. It would be enough if Kaya and the Usopp pirates became aware of it. That being said another "World Reaction" would be great. Cameos from characters we haven't seen in a while.</br>  <br> filler reaction faces <br> purposely slow pacing <br> "these chapters" <br><br>So is this your first or second arc? Or maybe you read the first couple a few years ago and all at once instead of weekly?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didnt jimbe ask the wg to release arlong</br>  Since Trebol survived the suicide explosion is it possible that Monet and Vergo also survived?  <br>Well the "From the Decks of the World" cover arc 4 years ago covered most of the old friends, and we saw Crocodile and Bonney after Punk Hazard. We still need to check up on<br> Buggy <br> Akainu in full <br> Kizaru <br> Dragon <br> Moriah <br> Marco and co (?) <br>I feel like this one wil be more about the power players than East Blue people again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> possible <br><br>It's more than likely. Not sure why everyone is surprised about villains living in one piece.</br></br></br>  <br>Because ID isn't the only jail.</br>  <br>If that's really all he cared about he wouldn't have told the marine soldiers to get over there and broadcast it.</br>  <br>It mostly comes with the territory of how complex One Piece has gotten since the New World and possibly down to Oda not having the sufficient time to plan far ahead. As much as I will miss the old formula of isolated arcs like Thriller Bark and Skypiea where he could be as creative as possible, he has an ambitious story to wrap up and wont be doing this forever. <br><br>Grand plot advancement has been the driving force of this arc though and the emotional strength we are used to has been put secondary. He is skilled enough to weave the two together but just hasn't managed it this time. In the past he would have fitted the contents of this chapter into half the pages so it feels deliberate.</br></br></br>   Kouichi Yamadera <br>Holy cashew nut, praise Toei, this is perfect.</br>  <br>He set sail first because he was tired of his living situation. Remember he was still a kid when he attempted to set sail.</br>  <br>I think this chapter was fine. An enormous improvement over the cheering and countdown chapters we got for the past month. The Sabo stuff went too long, but it could be that I just don't like Sabo.<br><br>I disagree with you saying Oda doesn't plan far enough ahead. I think he has too many ideas and his story keeps gettign bigger and bigger, and he's in a position where he can tell every detail the way he wants to. Each element of Dressrosa was good-to-great individually, and there's nothing I think you could convince him to cut, but together the arc gets pretty cluttered and very long. Its worrying to think how long it took to take out a relatively minor villain like Doflamingo when theres still so much established story to get too, plus new stuff and returning characters. These arcs will just get bigger and bigger</br></br></br>  <br>Kaidou will kill them for sure, ending One Piece next year.</br>  <br>really? No one commenting on how that's a new bounty poster?</br>  <br>Yeah, we'll definitely get some reactions from the WG, Revolutionaries (through Sabo I assume), and Kaido (and the underworld?). Maybe Bonney ties into the upcoming events somehow, cause her appearance seemed out of place.</br>  <br>That's old.</br>  Who's the most popular fujo pairing in OP?  <br>You don't know if it's new though.</br>  <br> Explosions <br> Proven on countless occasions to be ineffective <br> Monet <br> Fatal stabbing to the heart <br>Please tell me you people didn't actually think Trebol was dead</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is he smiling?</br>  <br>Its not a bounty, its the same poster than announced their alliance the day this all started</br>  <br><br>People saying "nothing happened" have no understanding of how huge this is</br></br>  <br> Is he smiling? <br>Trebol confirmed for D</br></br>  Now begins the fun part of One Piece: the time between arcs which shows what happens around the world and the story progresses.  <br>they are just shitposters spouting their epic meme phrases</br>  <br>Zoro/Sanji<br>I know because of reasons</br></br>  So, who's going to be the next crew mate?<br><br>I hope it's  Violet  or  Bellamy .</br></br>  Did everyone suddenly forget that we already saw one Doffy's eyes?  <br> Bellamy <br>Ew<br><br> Violet <br> Wanting two Robins in the same crew </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy</br>  <br> implying you can ever have enough Robins </br>  <br>bellamy is a pathetic loser who continued to work under doffy even know he knew doffy thought he was literal garbage.

Nobody in all of Dressrosa has any necessity to the strawhats<br>instead what we will get is people becoming part of their faction not unlike what Whitebeard had</br></br>  <br>Good, its like you want the SHs to be full of mooks</br>  <br> Wanting two Robins in the same crew <br><br>Literally yes.<br><br> Operation Bleed Sanji to Death, byt nosebleed commence. </br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Sai will bang this everyday from now on and will make her pregnant with lots of monkey children  <br> What the fuck Oda, Luffy's almost end game and yet he doesn't have nearly a large crew like the Yonkou's <br> Quality over quantity </br></br>  <br>It's extremely obvious Bartolomeo's crew will probably become Luffy's first faction to aid him in obtaining One Piece.<br><br>Then again Luffy has said No spontaneously before with little to no effort.<br><br>DOES Luffy want a fleet even?</br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck, why did anyone tell me that this was a thing?<br><br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004<br><br>Weren't shuesha going to release their own color chapters from the beginning?

What are you smoking?</br></br></br>   Yes. His father Barrels was a marine officer, and Drake dreamt to become a marine while he was admitting his father. But something happened and his father became a pirate, and used violence even on his own son, he really became a cruel man. Drake believed in his Dad and followed him, he was 19 years old at that time. Yet he, who feared his own father, looked much younger. And then Drake was protected by the marine and became one himself. Despite him being able to make it up to a marine officer, he dropped his career and became a pirate. What did happen to him!? I'm curious what will happen soon!! <br><br>Get hype for X Drake arc.</br></br>  <br>I'll miss him. Hopefully the Dofly crew will get a mini story. Just like the Baroque works and CP9</br>  <br>You mispelled Kaidou arce with X Drake being Law 2.0</br>   The groups the strawhats split up in during punk hazzard was the same as dressrosa. <br>just realized this</br>  <br> So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now? <br>Nobody with a brain no<br> Implying Akainu wouldn't shit fire over this decision <br> Implying the WG would just overlook Luffy's heinous acts against them up till this point <br> Implying Luffy would accept </br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep saying that Scopper Gaban is Kaido?  <br>Probably ZoSan, yeah. <br><br>I need him to fuck me in the ass, right now.<br> I'm going to miss him so much. </br></br></br></br>  <br> +100 chapters of Drake-wanking </br>  <br><br>I didn't know anyone still was.<br><br>It's supposed to all be in the smile Scopper had matching Kaido's original silhoutte's smile isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Praise Toei <br>Not even once.</br></br>  <br>Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds</br>  <br><br>Or 100 chapters of mecha Franky fighting Indominus.</br></br>  <br><br> mfw the ship group are the shit members and brook </br></br>  <br> Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds <br>That does sound stupid, and considering the hype being built around him, who would even qualify to secretly be Kaido without being a huge letdown?</br></br>  <br>and after that<br> 100 chapters of Urouge wanking <br> 100 chapters of Capone Bege wanking </br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4806850  <br>We've seen part of Kaidous face.

He's dropped from one of the most interesting characters to somewhere below Caesar in interest level for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I read too quickly, there are actually more than 800 people for Rebecca.</br>  <br>Oh I see<br>strawpoll was rigged by bots, and nobody likes Rebecca<br>my bad</br></br></br>  <br>Except the world knows. And Fuji just apologized.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part were an admiral and all the marines with him bowed down and asked forgiveness to everyone in Dressrosa, blaming the WG for all these years of suffering and that all that is already going around the world? There is no way this can be silenced at this point.</br>  Will Fujitora be fired from the government?  <br>I would honestly be surprised if Luffy even offered. The chances are literally zero that she would take it after finding out about the family she didn't know she had.</br>  <br>Good luck with that.</br>  <br>No, but maybe there will be some more tension between the govt and marines from now on.</br>  <br><br><br>And you two missed the part where as of right now that is only broadcasted to the three closest islands. If the WG moves quickly that can be easily contained.</br></br></br>  <br>And the paper that everyone gets.</br>  <br> implying Absa's journalistic integrity can be contained </br>  <br> mfw I read a doujin I thought was DoflaCroc but it ended up being Croc being raped by BB while hallucinating he was being fucked by Doffy <br>Forever scarred. I never want to see his ugly mug again.</br></br>  <br> nearest three islands + dressrosa get buster called <br> islands close to those islands notice that their neighbours got buster called <br> those islands get buster called too to prevent anything from leaking, people might start thinking something happened on Dressrosa <br> buster call spread over the entire new world <br> paradise gets buster called  <br> all four blues get buster called <br> marie joa gets buster called <br> the moon gets buster called <br> everyone gets buster called <br> no more information leaks </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://captiongenerator.com/48436/A<wbr>kainu-reacts-to-Fujitoras-Broadcast<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>No, he's at least due for partial credit on the Doffy issue.</br>  <br>There's no way that he actually likes the WG though, right?</br>  <br>Maybe he'll tie them up and tell them he'll let them be his fuckboys. <br>The part with Bonney was just foreshadowing.</br></br>  <br>The WG decides the laws, what is right and wrong, he lives for the WG.</br>  <br>It's not about the world government. It's about making the Marines look incompetent. We know he explicitly wanted to toughen them up. He went so far as to make a conscription to do so. And here are one of his conscripted admirals bowing and apologizing instead of killing off a bunch of weakened pirates.<br><br>Congrats you got rid of doflamingo..but now Luffy and Law are heroes, Sabo got away, Burgess got away, Hundreds of other pirates are on luffy's sides, millions more of people will be willing to help him now making it harder to capture him.<br><br>Fujitora completely fucked over akainu with his even if Akainu agrees the shichibukai system is as fucked as Fujitora says. There were a billion different ways to get rid of it that didnt make it seem like the pirates are good guys and the marines are evil doofuses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Three closest islands <br> Some faggot journalist already sent out the news canaries to the rest of the world </br></br>  <br> he lives for the WG. <br> We need a Sakazuki edit of this gif </br></br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  So, fuckhuge new bounties time?  <br> Ants are after all the strongest organism.  <br><br> not the waterbear fruit </br></br></br>  <br>Will sanji and the others get bounties too?</br>  <br><br> Not the pistol shrimp zoan </br></br>  <br> not knowing the difference between strength and durability </br>  "Stop resisting Issho, do not think your gravity works with me.<br>Who would be push a Magma man to the center of the Earth only to come back stronger?<br>You let the devil and terrorist escape and shamed all who defend the righteous<br>Now face absolute justice"</br></br></br>  <br>If you meant strength as literal strength then it would be the dung beetle</br>  <br><br><br><br>We Terra Formars now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off terra formar fag</br>  <br> Ants are after all the strongest organism. <br>icameheretolaughatyou.jpg<br>Do you even dung beetle</br></br></br>  <br><br> I've never seen nor read Terra Formars <br> Hell this is pretty much the only exposure I've had to it </br></br></br>  <br>But someone already ate that fruit</br>  <br>Nice quads but I thought it was not specified what beetle is he,and dung beetles are black</br>  <br>I assume oda gave all the insects to the dwarves so humans wouldn't be too overpowered.</br>  <br>he has the rhinoceros beetle which is pretty strong<br><br><br>Not dung beetle strong<br><br>but one of the strongest</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tales of their fishman island &amp; punk hazard exploits might have spread by now.<br>They won't be due for as large an increase though.</br></br>  <br>Although it seems dwarves are naturally stronger than humans?<br>Also if Oda really wants too I'm sure we are going to see more insect Zoans, especially thanks to all the Smile users we are going to encounter.</br></br>  <br>The most likely outcome of all of this.</br>  <br> Although it seems dwarves are naturally stronger than humans? <br><br><br>They are but they can easily be written out of the story after this arc.<br><br>I just think he doesn't want to deal with the logistics of someone having an ant fruit or such<br><br>can you imagine zoro 100x stronger than he is now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Sai a nigger in the Anime?</br>  Lucci is a very good boy.  <br><br>Just cause their 100x stronger doesn't make them 100x smarter</br></br>  What made him such a big dick G?

Look people here just wanna discuss one piece. But then there are you trolls trying to bait people with your stupid shit. Why can't you guys just respect other people's cultures why do you feel like you have to annoy everyone. Do you think it's because your anonymous. Because your not. You might be able to get away with pissing people off right now but we all die and eventually face the Lord. And he sure knows what your doing. So please just be considerate of others when you post on this board. If you can't then why don't you try /b/ for a change. If you go there you will find people just like yourself and you can frolick with others that are just as foolish as you.</br></br>  <br>luffy isn't a pushover</br>  <br>Zoro vs Ryuuma is a great one, but the Strawhats all together against Oars is probably my favorite.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127492576 <br>You sound like my former best friend.

They would be far too susceptible to the very thing you are mentioning. we saw it already happen in the real world at clinton. Looking at prison research males getting them to do what they want happens way more often than people would like to admit.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is the biggest push over in this entire series he lets his crew order him around and hasn't won a single fight since thriller bark by himself</br>  <br>Drake's dad is Diez Barrels though</br>  <br>wrong.</br>  <br>This is terrible, the worst thing to happen.</br>  I remember a time when the crew had screen time and epic battles..<br>Oda, please, stop the handjob fest on law and bring more suuuuuuuuuuuuuupaaa franky, robin and sanji</br>  <br>I'm just glad I shut that bitchass up</br>  <br>Am I the only one who thinks Rebecca's armor looks pig disgusting?</br>  <br>Shanks' crew isn't very large though, is it?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Sabody barley survived after making his crew help him take out a robot <br><br>Maiden island would have died from posion mushrooms<br><br>Impel down needed Ivankov to cure him and stall Magellen <br><br>Marine Ford white beard landed luffy a hand <br><br>Sabody 2 years later needed various other groups to stall the marines <br><br>Fishman island needed brotherhoshi to save him from drowning after hodi popped his bottle <br><br>Dressrosa needed law to help him escape his cuffs agree being defeated by cc <br><br>Dressrosa needed laws help defeating doflamingo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You guys are talking about this like it's a bad thing.<br>Would you rather he just go full Zoro and shitstomp everyone in the New World, the place that was specifically set up to be the end-all, be-all proving ground of the current pirate generation?</br></br></br>  <br>No other character is lucky as him.

Also if you do think he is stronger when do you think he reached that point? I think sanji is stronger and achieved that strength around enies lobby.  <br>It's not exactly easy to tell when we only barely saw Zeff fight, and even that was with a peg leg.</br>  <br>no. I dont think he is. When he is able to hit a woman I think he reached a huge point in progression in his growth as a character both from a power and mental point.</br>  <br>Man, who do you guys think is the seventh shichibukai?</br>  <br>There's good chances of it being someone we've never seen.</br>  <br>Future highlights(probably)<br> Chopper's bounty increment, as he wished all the time <br> Shogeking →Usopp? <br> New look for Nami and Franky's bounty <br> Increment of Luffy's bounty(not Law's cause his can't go any higher than Luffy's) <br> Newly involved as "wanted", expecting Kinemon and his buddy, and some participants <br><br>And of course<br>   New look for Sanji's bounty? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one from 2nd movie doesn't count?<br>Hell Nami did a great job by "containing her in a bottle"</br></br>  <br>most of those movies aren't anywhere near canon<br><br>only some of them have canonical elements. I think two.</br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't Buggy split atoms and blows up the Grand Line?</br>  <br>Its obviously Burgess, his primary hunting weapon seems to be a knife</br>  <br>you guys are the masters of bad theories</br>  <br>Obviously Marco that dog to save his people from Akainu the fist of justice</br>  <br>You mean two parts or movie two?</br>  <br>I meant I think only the movie about shiki and the one with zephyr have canonical parts.</br>  Is the general opinion that the voice actors are the only things Toei gets right or they even slipping in that regard nowadays?  <br>sanji has the best va . Makes oda laugh and influences how sanjis character should be.</br>  <br>Bellamy won't join<br><br>Violet could join but in all likelihood won't, she has no reason to leave now that she can be together with King Riku, Kyros, and Rebecca<br><br>For the same reason it's unlikely Rebecca will join <br><br>Barto won't join<br><br>Law won't join<br><br>No one is joining from this arc. If anything, all we'll get is that Law will be a permanent ally or the equivalent of a division commander for Luffy.<br><br>I doubt we'll get a new member until we reach the next major arc which in all likelihood is Wano.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because buggy is a weak faggot <br><br>I think akainu is going to draft in a new admiral to replace Fujitora, he pretty much accomplished his goal anyway.

I mean, I know he's lighthearted and wants to have fun, and I know he does have a serious side, but he's not retarded.</br></br>  <br>You seem to forget that Robin helped Crocodile to put a bomb that would have killed 2 million people.<br><br>She's not a saint by any means.</br></br></br>  <br>because he is a orochimaru rip off</br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>  <br>Orochimaru<br>Caesar<br>Mayuri<br><br>There has to be at least one in each manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to make a joke about Usopp's ass, but even his is obscured. All asses are obscured.</br>  So just a though -<br><br>At the beginning of the day in Chapter 700, we can see Jinbe reading the paper with the news about Luffy and Law and see it again from a different angle in 760.<br><br>Because of what happens later in Jinbe's cover story, does that mean that most of it happened in the future? IE, the night of that same day (which we aren't at yet on Dressrosa) and tomorrow?</br></br></br></br>  <br> hxh <br><br>uh...Pariston?</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy learned from Shanks that personal pride doesn't mean anything, so he'll take a ton of abuse if it means his crew or friend gets help. It's one of his major differences from Roger, who was all temper.</br>  <br>Yeah, but he just sacrificed his crew for these three members.</br>  <br>ohana means family</br>  <br>Long black hair<br>Ghostly pale skin<br>Yellow eyes<br>Eyeliner<br>High pitch voice<br>Bad scientists <br>World Known mentor<br>Experiments specifically on children<br><br> let's give him horns to differentiate him from that other mango </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this inception?</br>  <br>Stitch, pls.</br>  <br>Yeah he teamed up with Buggy, he wouldn't let him join his crew</br>  <br>It's particularly the final 3 instalments.<br><br>760 - Reading the paper with the news about Luffy, Law and Doflamingo<br>-----------------------------------<wbr>------<br>782 - A party that night<br>783 - Teaming up with Wadatsumi<br>785 - Leaving the next day<br><br>I guess this means that he isn't turning up to help out Sanji's crew.

He won't do anymore Naruto after that.<br><br>Any new Naruto story out after that will be Shueisha doing some desperate milking.</br></br></br></br></br>  y the fuck does boruto have whiskers, narutos whiskers were cuz kushina had the 9 tails while preggers with naruto, so unless naruto was the one who got knocked up it doesnt make sense for boruto to have whiskers  <br> [citation needed] </br>  <br>Then the kids would have three whiskers, retard.</br>  <br><br> Sarada made a DNA test that made her a match with Karin trhough a umbillical cord found in her office by Suigetsu <br><br> Naruto didn't know about anything, Sarada was turning edgy <br><br> Naruto succesfully TnJ her by explaining that Bonds &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Blood if there's genuine love <br><br> Sarada goes to help Sakura because she was in the Onion's lair with Shin senior. <br><br> She and Shin have a talk about DNA vs Bonds too <br><br> Sauce, Naruto and Sarada arrive amd Sarada learned super strrengh from Sakura and finally unleashes Sharingan <br><br> It was all a misundertanding and Sakura is the biomom <br><br> Sarada wants to be Hokage <br><br>End.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>he's probably an alien spy or oro experiment.</br></br>  <br>Sakura got kidnapped by onion after punching his liver out, they went to Mengelemaru's facility, performed DNA test on something that Suigetsu thought was Karin's umbilical cord, got a match, made Salad go DARKNESS, Naruto TnJ'd Salad into loving Sakura again they fought onions, Sakura was revealed to be a mom and Karin just helped deliver Salad, Sasuke spent one evening with his family and ran away, Chouchou found out about butterfly ability, Salada dreams of becoming hokage.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127467<wbr>590/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127467<wbr>590/#q127468929</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br> Orochimaru and Kabuto got away with everything <br> Sakura is Sarada's mom <br> Sasuke is the coolest papa <br> Sarada will be the next hokage </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope SD assistant-kun picks it up<br>He is good with comedy/SoL and i think he can handle the serious stories as well</br></br>  <br>He will comeback, he is the Kurumada of this generation.</br>   New ED is about based ramen guy  <br> by FLOW <br>How nice.</br></br>  <br>Wait, so his name is actually Metal Lee? That's cool.</br>  <br>It wasn't Tenten. Its canon she chose weapons over kids</br>  <br>Sarada is the true savior of Uchiha. <br><br>As hokage, she will find a way to fix their trigger gland and the Uchiha's honor will finally be restored.</br></br></br>  <br> parallel busting ED <br>10/10</br></br>  <br> yfw Tenten treats her favorite weapons like her children, but in a really creepy way </br>    <br>You are now aware that Naruto is literally in the same position Hashirama was with Madara.</br>  <br> Kushina/Naruto getting sick whIle eating with Minato/Hinata.  <br><br>That's some sweet pottery. Also Hinata out-eating Naruto was a nice touch.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, think about how many people's lives they ruined. All those babies they experimented on for example...</br>  <br>They are homosexual lovers?</br>  <br><br>No, Naruto(Hashirama) managed to talk some sense into Sasuke(Madara) so he comes home to the village and parts his hair dresses in all black while still being kind of an oddball.<br><br>Sasuke could very well come to realize Naruto was wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hashirama or any Ashura <br> Homo. <br>Indras always get mad becuase of that.</br></br></br>  <br> And if it was Tenten's child it would have said so right there anyways. <br>Not necessarily. Temari and Ino aren't listed on that page, and yet their kids are listed.<br><br>Unless they're mentioned in their descriptions. I don't read Jap so I don't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ashura kissed Indra this time around though.</br>  <br>They are</br>  <br>Got a source for this? To my knowledge all we know is that she opened up a weapon shop. Nothing suggests that she didn't have a kid at one point.</br>  Who the hell is in charge of naming Kishimoto's characters?  <br>Gaara probably married that Shijima girl from his gaiden.</br>  Is there a bigger cuck than Karin?  <br>Got some screenshots?</br>  <br>What's Metal Lee's description say?</br>  <br>I'm just reading the kana, I don't actually know what most of the words mean. It doesn't mention anyone other than his father though</br>  <br>METAL LEE A BEST</br>  <br>dumbanon here<br>i dont understand it can you explain?</br></br>    <br> Hinata eats a fuckload <br> becomes sexier as time goes on <br> Anko eats a fuckload <br> gets fat as fuck <br><br>I guess all that shadow clone gangbanging keeps the excess weight off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did...Hinata just eat naruto under the table?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aAr<wbr>4O_zE8Pw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>this is not the first time it happened<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Swt<wbr>Mkn2XKdY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to take a wild guess and say that if the mother isn't Tenten, it's going to be this chick.</br>  <br>It's why Hinata is so soft looking. Ino, Temari, Karui, hell even Sakura look more toned and fit because of their training and not eating as much.<br><br>Hinata never looked physcially fit...just soft.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do those shutters work?<br>Its two of them with a support in the middle but when both are up the entire support just disappears?</br></br>  <br>Truly Hinata is perfect.</br>  <br>Didn't she have a crush on Shikamaru? That's quite a jump in preferences.</br>  <br>And Lee had a crush on Sakura. Both get rejected, and find each other. Or something like that.<br><br>Like I said, it's just a wild guess. After all, who would have predicted Choji would marry Karui?</br></br></br>  <br><br>That it has everything except TenTen's name. The kana isn't there.</br></br>  why havent we still gotten any good quality japanese sound for the last naruto movie? I can't take korean voices  <br>It could still be a possibility. His eyes are sort of shaped like Tenten's, and... his headband cloth is the same color as Tenten's in Part II. I'm grasping at straws at this point though. I just want to know who got "the blue beast."<br><br>And I can't tell if that's an earplug or a comm device in his ear.</br></br></br>  <br>The Novel about everyone buying Nh wedding gifts. Her section was her wondering if it's okay to be weird and not get married with kids like everyone else. Then she just whatever and chose weapons</br>  <br>Did you read it? Was it any good?</br>  <br>not that anon but i reccomend it<br>heres a link if you wanna read it:<br>http://cacatuasulphureacitrinocrist<wbr>ata.tumblr.com/post/119175229601/ca<wbr>ca-please-make-a-masterlist-for-kon<wbr>oha-hiden-too</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> Not falling into the herdmind <br><br>Ten Ten is definitely 10/10. Kinda unique despite always having the short stick end in terms of spotlight.<br><br>I wished Kishi would have spent a bit more of time on her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura and Ino hiden <br> Sakura immediately flaunt her achievements to Ino for a picture frame <br><br>Why am I not surprise that Sakura is a shitty girl even in the novel</br></br></br></br>  <br>im always kinda rustled from the fact that 1010 has no background at all except her chinese dress<br>hell even Shino got more background than her</br></br>  <br>This... could be beautiful.</br>  <br>being a B-cast in Naruto is being suffering</br>  <br>Suffering for us too since the side characters are the best ones.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v5G<wbr>cGAnBoes</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>MEANWHILE</br></br>  <br>is she the new Tobi?<br> I LOVE IT </br></br>  <br> X3 Bringing the heat <br>her move could have been more faster though<br>still shes cute as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say Lee is average. The Big Two aside, he could probably beat anyone from his generation. Especially now that Neiji is dead. Neiji and Shikamaru are his banes. Shikamaru is Batman, and Neiji is extremely dangerous to get up close and personal with. <br><br>Also, I vaguely remember Kakashi saying that he is actually talented. That was during Chuunin exams though, so eh.</br></br></br>  I thought Mitsuki was speculated to be Kakashi's kid?<br><br>Didn't Kakashi meet some woman with light blue hair in his gaiden from another country?</br></br>  <br> Dat Hyuga combination ultimate attack </br>  <br> Arrow shows Inojin being Sai's son instead of saying he's Ino's son. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm really sure Lee could open the Gates and blitz Shikamaru the fuck down before he had a chance to come up with anything unless Shika had time to set up beforehand.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I guess it depends on how the fight starts. Shikamaru with prep time is potentially game over for Lee. <br><br>Can you brute force your way through his shadow control jutsu?</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto did it during the war, also hidan and kakuzu did it</br>  <br>Sai is now a more relevant character than Ino despite never being much other than Sasuke's (less autistic) replacement for fillers and movies.<br><br>The character description does say that he is both Ino and Sai's kid and that his last name is Yamanaka.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes. His own physical strength/condition relates to it, which is why he was unable to finish Tayuya off near the end of their fight because he was too tired and weak to have it crush her neck.<br><br>Pretty sure Kakuzu and Naruto broke out of it before too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so Sai is keeping is codename as his real name and adopted the last name Yamanaka?</br>  <br>Shikamaru should eat his oats and do his squats then.</br>  <br>100 situps, pushups, squats and a 10km run everyday?</br>  <br>Yes, and throw these in for safe measure.</br>  <br>He still has a bomb tattooed on his tongue. He probably doesn't even remember his real name.</br>  <br>Funny enough, according to the databooks, Hinata weighs less than Sakura despite being shorter and bustier.</br>  <br>the bomb tatooed tongue got removed with Danzo's death<br>I'm not sure how sealing jutsu work in this fucked up ninja world</br></br>  <br>She's officially the Konoha ramen eating champ.<br><br>There was a contest, and she won.</br></br></br>  <br>Called the strongest attack in the game in one interview.</br>  <br>Anon, stop. I'm going to run out of tissues at this rate. <br><br>That fucking combination attack though. Incorporating basically everything Hyuga with the 64 palms, Vacuum Wall and Rotation.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Bk<wbr>GdsRH5I0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>For anyone who hasn't seen it, newest trailer for Storm 4.<br><br>Kaguya confirmed playable and Eight Gates Guy is there for like half a second. <br><br>Bort, Salad, and Hokage Kakashi are preorder only and apparently won't be made available as normal DLC later.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The graphics of these games are getting worse</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ivm<wbr>aDlGAv3k</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Damn, whoops.</br></br></br></br></br>   いつもここでボルトと遊んでるのよね？ <br>Are you always going to play with Boruto here?<br><br> うん！！！ <br>Yup!!!<br><br> リビングとキッチン。生活感にあふれ、温かみがある場所。 <br>The living room and kitchen. It's a place that's overflowing with livelihood and warmth.<br><br> ボルトの部屋。モノが多いがしっかりと片づけられている。壁にはいくつも<wbr>のポスターが！！</wbr> <br>Boruto's room. He has numerous things that are neatly tidied up. There are a large amount of posters on the wall!<br><br> 広々としたうずまき家の内装を大公開！！ <br>It's the huge release of the spacious interior of the Uzumaki home!<br><br> 今回はうずまき一家過ごす家の中まだ案内するぞ！４人が普段どんなところ<wbr>に住んでいるのかがわ かる！！</wbr> <br>This time, it's the guide to the inside of the home of the Uzumaki family! Discover what kind of spacious place that the the four of them usually reside in!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's not tenten, I thought she said in one of the light novels she wasn't going to have kids and just care for her weapons</br>  <br>So they are finally going full on with the Naruto/Hinata minato/kushina parallels. Between this and the gaiden books it seems like Naruto and Hinata were hanging out a lot. How the hell didn't they fug before the last?</br>  <br>I wonder if Himawari will still want to play there with Boruto after the cake smashing.</br>  <br>You're expecting a shonen protagonist to know about sex?</br>  <br>I have no doubt that there will be more. Obviously not by Kishi though, Naruto is too big and would make too much money for Jump to not get someone else to make more</br>  <br>he did say he felt calm or something along those lines when he was around hinata</br>  <br>I thought they were gonna recycle Hanabi's moveset from UN3. Glad I was wrong.</br>  <br>Naruto was straight up autistic. He thought his relationship with Sasuke was what having a best friend was like for fuck's sake. How can he understand romantic love if he doesn't understand the basic rules of friendship?</br>  <br>everytime</br>  <br>During shikamaru gaiden, which takes place before the last, they even state that Naruto hangs out with Hinata a lot. So they were basically dating already.</br>  <br>The Last showed he's sort of liked her for awhile, but some strange misunderstanding caused him to confuse it with something else.<br><br>Like "Oh, she likes me like she likes ramen".<br><br>It was probably the most dense MC thing to ever happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't that just justify the thread then?</br></br>  <br><br>Fat weighs less than muscle. No shit.</br></br>  Ramen guy has seen some shit.  <br> Kishimoto said it's over for good after Boruto movie is out. He won't do anymore Naruto after that. <br>I hope this is true. I want BENCH! to get serialized as the one shot was better then the entirety of Naruto sans Land of Waves.</br></br>  <br>HE won't do anything<br><br>The company might try to find out some way to keep going, like really extending the fillers in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Metal Lee <br>Best thing about this movie so far. Amazing fucking name. <br><br><br>Dr. Snakes</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Does this mean Bort is the new Coolest Guy?</br>  <br>So where can I read those gaidens? Are all of them translated?</br>  <br>Source.<br><br>Stop spouting bs</br></br></br>  <br> playing with Bort <br> after he nukes her cake <br>She really is Hinata's child.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Metal Lee's kid will be Steely Dan</br>  <br>They're released in English, even before Japan, so yes</br>  <br>They truly surpassed Kakashi's generation of wizards. Except for Shino and Tenten.</br>  So why was this fatass even in the story? What was her fucking purpose?  <br>Don't see why people are this suprised. He's shown every girl in Konoha he has almost infnite stamina (compared to the avergae ninja) and he's ripped from years of training. Of course he's getting poon, eyebrows or no</br>  <br>They already dress the same.</br>  <br>Do we have expert weeaboos here who can explain function of that half-spoon half-plate thing Hinata's handling her noodles with?</br>  <br>Hinata is nothing like Kushina. Nothing</br>  I do agree that Naruto doesn't need a general and the optimal solution would be to let those threads die with time. Forcing people to stop discussing it only increases the amount of shitposting.<br> In this regard both the mod and the anti naruto posters are wrong to me.<br> Worse thing is that the naruto haters use the boogey man of tumblr and reddit when they know that people discuss Naruto because it's so bad it's fun.</br></br>  <br>To be a sassy black chick?<br><br>I wish I was kidding and I know someone is going to say Greek Chorus but Chouchou was only there to talk shit and get hit. <br><br>Kishi may as well have just had Salad and Killer B hang out instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Comic relief and I guess finally showing a relevant BFFship that doesn't involve masochist homolust or fighting over some guy.</br>  <br>soup spoon, Asian style.</br>  <br>What is nigger's natural affinity in action stories? Comic relief. Though I think she drove the joke too hard making it a bit cringy by the end. Still despite how cliche her ending was, it was endearing.</br>  <br> this entire time Sauce was only pretending to be redeemed <br> instead of pursuing his REVOLUTION in the open he's carefully plotted and planned over the course of 12 years <br> waiting for a worthy successor who could make his plan a reality <br> finally he has found that successor </br></br></br></br>  So,is Konohamaru banging Hanabi or the ugly shit from his group  <br>So he's literally Madara 2.0 and Salad is Obito 2.0?<br><br>All that needs to happen now is for Sasuke to give Salad his Rinnegan to give to Bolt, kill himself and then get Bolt to use Rinne Tensei as a way to parallel the whole Madara/Obito/Nagato situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you that stupid, or can you just not process that image correctly with Naruto being the Kushina in that image?<br><br>Naruto is the Kushina in the relationship, they even say their personality is the same. He's even the one that lines up with her in the flashback.<br><br>Hinata is the Minato of the relationship, she even lines up with him in the flashback. They even have that same yin/yang thing. In that recent official image showing the Naruto family breakfast Naruto was also the one acting like Kushina over reacting to Bort escaping out the window, and Hinata was acting like Minato all calm.<br><br>For some reason this trips up some people, despite them being even more overt with it here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br>But making it out of ceramics means it's too thick to accurately scoop liquid, plus it seems to be designed for standing on a table. Just seems like a bad design for tableware.</br>  <br>But Minato was a pussywhipped beta that did everything Kushina told him to do and was the hokage breadwinner of his household that created his son's signature technique.</br>  are japanese family dinners always like this? where the parents look disgusted at their kids?  <br>The look on Sasuke's face is like "It just struck me that I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life"<br><br>That's some hardcore dejection if I ever saw it.</br></br></br>  Why isn't Shikamaru Hokage?  <br>because HURR NARUTO<br><br>Also, I assume Shikamaru wouldn't want to do all the paperwork and boring shit like that</br></br></br>  <br>Not enough charisma and powerlevel</br>  Who the hell fucked Kankuro?<br><br><br>Cause he's a lazy fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what was Kishy trying to convey here. Maybe it's supposed to be the moment Salad asks Sasuke to train her tomorrow and they now have to break it to her that his mission is not over?</br>  How much better would the series be if Shikamaru was the protoganist and Naruto didn't get ridiculous power levels?  <br>based Ramen Man, supported Naruto right from the beginning, when everyone hated him.</br>  <br>A Hokage is a face, a symbol, a symbol of power as well.<br><br>Naruto excels at that much, and being the power house. Meanwhile he picked Shikamaru as his #2 to make sure everything is running smooth.<br><br>People think Naruto isn't smart, but picking Shika was super smart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's that Killer B looking motherfucker?</br>  <br>Because that's how politic work, you make the charismatic popular guy the president and actually smart and competent man as his "council" who actually runs shit.</br>  <br>After the rock band?</br>  <br>Killer B's son. He got Gyuuki pendant and same horn mark on his cheek which I assume is bijuu imprint on the user and his kids like Kurama's whiskers in Uzumaki family.</br>  <br>Bee porked Samui. He loved big titties.</br>  <br>People that liked Naruto before it was cool<br> Ramen Man <br> Hinata <br> Iruka </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yo, when did the Geralt have a kid and why did he become a ninja?</br>    <br>Thought so. Good on him. <br><br><br>He did loves him some big titties.<br><br><br>Lucky bastard, managed to get with the hot stuff of Kumogakure. Samui lucked out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you make the charismatic popular guy the president and actually smart and competent man as his "council" who actually runs shit. <br>Gaara confirmed for charismatic emo</br></br>  How would Lee fare against all the other fighters of his generation? (part 1)<br><br>Vs. Chouji: Chouji is only deadly when given the chance to land a punch, and even then, Lee could take whatever he throws at him until Chouji goes full butterfly, and even the, butterfly mode is still inferior to 8 gates of power<br>Outcome: Victory<br><br>Vs.Ino: If the games are anything to go by, all he needs to do is watch out for poison and keep moving so she doesnt get the chance to lock on him and take his body. Even if she did, its Goku vs. Ginyu all over again; she can't use his techniques whereas he might be able to get Ino's body to open a gate at most; she's pretty fit and might be strong enough to.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory<br><br>Vs.Kiba: Kiba is a very linear attacker and has probably developed his techniques the least of the Konoha 11. Lee just has to watch out for whatever dog Kiba is working with these days and dodge when Kiba is going to use Fang over Fang. Could probably tank it even if it landed, kid Naruto survived like three of those. Kiba's ultimate technique might be cause for concern, but he can run circles around it all day.<br>Outcome: Victory with minimal injury<br><br>Shino: A little more dangerous; he's poisonous, his insects get everywhere and he's full of bugs. Lee will have to avoid direct contact with his body and make sure Shino's bugs dont get inside his body to block chakra points or eat his chakra. Will probably need to activate gates for this to finish him off quickly. Shino with a plan is basically a creepier Shikamaru.<br>Outcome: Victory with a few insect bites<br><br>Shikamaru: Don't give him time to booby trap the field and you're fine. Lee will just have to watch out for shadows and the shade in general to make sure Shikamaru doesnt trap him.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory in an impromptu fight. Victory with some injuries if Shikamaru has prep time<br><br>Hinata: Deadliest fighter to Lee after Naruto and Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke too according to the last chapters but was too tsundere to show it.</br>  <br>Gaara is more of a walking army.</br>  <br>Did you see the crowd of fangirls when he was revived that time he died?<br><br>Of course he's super charisma man<br><br>Naruto also has fangirls now apparently</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kabuto on the bottom leading a zombie army that killed tens of thousands of ninjas <br> he now runs an orphanage </br></br>  <br>Sasuke too. He even put Sakura in her place to defend him in ch3 and pic related.</br>  <br>I'm a Hinata fag, but Lee just wrecks Hinata in part 1. death by one touch is nothing, if you can't hit something and Lee's taijutsu in general is far beyond chunin level in part 1</br>  <br>They say guys without eyebrows are all charismatic. <br><br>Well hot damn, that applies to me too.</br></br></br>  <br>He is doctor snakes now. He is cool man.</br>  <br>BLACKED<br>L<br>A<br>C<br>K<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about your faggot goatee?</br>   This fucking shit is going to end and no fucking Kakashi Face.   <br>do you live under a rock?</br>  <br>We've already seen it officially, in one of the gaiden chapters.<br><br>Stop being a month or two behind</br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't know <br>top kek</br></br>  <br> every thread </br>      <br><br>Best kages in comedic duo. Honestly for all the deaths war brought a lot of edo tenseis were fucking hilarious.</br></br>  <br> ah.. ah... <br>Kakashi is turning me on.</br></br>  <br>Oh you want to go, bitch? Everyone knows the reason you cover up your face is because you kept breaking every mirror you walked past and accrued enough bad luck to encounter me.</br>  <br>I have no clue who Kankuro fucked but, I'm happy he gets a kid. He's underrated and lost potential as a character to me.</br>  <br>Given Kankuro's spread in the databook. He's a bitchin father for any potential kid. <br>Plus being related to two kages is going to give his kid mad prestige.</br></br>  <br><br>Gaara had two girls since fucking Part 1 who were literally dropping their pussies for him<br><br>I'm mad</br></br></br></br>  How would Lee fare against other fighters in his generation (cont'd)<br><br>Vs.Hinata: He'll have to strike hard and strike fast. 5th gate will probably be necessary. Will have to take her out before she can shut his chakra points down and immobilize his limbs.<br>Outcome: Victory if he goes HAM from the beginning.Possible Loss if he actually lets her use trigrams on him<br><br>Vs.Sakura: Probably the only person in Konoha besides Tsunade he can overpower Lee in a straight-up contest of force, and even then the difference in their strength probably isn't that great. Can beat her if he uses 6th gates speed and hits fast and hard. Lotus will most likely be necessary, and even then he'll have to make she she doesn't grab him in the middle of it or something. Basically an Iron Man vs. The Hulk situation<br>Outcome: Victory if he goes HAM from the beginning. Loss if he goes easy on her because shes Sakura-chan.<br><br>Vs. Ten-ten: Will have to fight her in a field she has not had time to booby trap if he wants to win. Can dodge every weapon she throws at him even without gates. Will need to be very familiar with what weapons can do if he wants to win unscathed. Once he comes in close range, the battles decided; he's better and faster even if the only weapon he knows how to use is the nunchucks.<br>Outcome: Overwhelming Victory if he is very familiar with her weapons and if he brings his A game in dodging. Victory if he's a little more careless.<br><br>Vs. Gaara: He'll have to bring his A game with speed and force if he wants to survive against Gaara. If the fight takes place in an area thats even remotely sandy, he'll have to activate gates, probably even the 7th gate. Must avoid Lotus since that did not end well for him the last time; will have to pummel relentlessly and mercilessly without allowing Gaara to breathe for even a second. Must not get caught or the battle is over.<br>Outcome: Victory if extremely bloodlusted and fresh from beginning. Dead if he allows Gaara to make more sand and catch him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I like Hinata and I think even in part 1 she could pull her weight and would completely wreck most of her fellow kunoichi (in the Leaf, Temari would beat her no sweat) and even some of the competition not hindered by having a vagina in Kishi's world, but Lee trained his ass off to beat someone who is faster, stronger and better at every combat move that Hinata can do, plus knows a bunch more shit.<br>Byakugan advantage being proven against Lee or no, she would not stand half a chance against Lee and to claim otherwise is ridiculous.<br>Part 2 (war arc) might be a different story however, though pretty damn close, and whoever wins is decided by what we are presuming either criminally underused character can do.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about present day Konoha 11, but I agree; its over if she isn't doing Kaiten every minute or so to make sure he stays the fuck away from her</br>  <br>So she can go from Queen Latifa to Beyonce eventually<br>Then everyone who talked shit about her in the past will take it back to fap to her new form<br> I don't have a problem with this form though, she is annoying though </br></br></br>  <br>He could potentially be Gaara's kid and was trained by Kankuro. He looks pretty pale.</br>  <br><br> (part 1) <br>looks like this confused me and was meant to be part 1 of a very long post,<br>yeah... sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br> Salad is Obito 2.0 <br>No, Obito 2.0 would be Naruto's son, I'm calling it</br></br>  <br>Bolt is Menma</br>   Path of Ninja never continued   <br>Well then that would be shit-tier unlucky for that kid. Gaara doesn't really provide any sweet benefits, if I recall his Sand powers are only because he had Shukaku in him his entire life. <br>Not sure those would be inheritable. <br>He also doesn't have access to the bitchin amount of natures Kankuro has. <br><br>That kid had better be using Sasori/Mother/Father puppets at some point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that Sakura face </br>  <br>What emotion is that even trying to convey?<br>Sasuke and Sakura look like they have the same case of man face.</br></br>  <br> that necklace on the Cloud boi <br>Did B take on a student?</br></br>  How can anyone believe Kishi actually likes SS?  <br>Because Sakura has a tonned body.<br><br>Muscles weight more than fat</br></br></br>  <br>Not likely. Kid's white as snow. Shouldn't he be another mulatto abomination like Chouchou?</br>  <br> Have every nature except fire <br> Use only puppets <br> Don't even use elements in tandem with puppets, just puppets exclusively <br><br>What the fuck, Kankuro</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Regardless, I'm glad we'll be seeing more of the puppet technique fighting style.</br>  <br>Kishi apparently said he likes Sakura.<br>I don't see it.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Well, they and Chouji/Karui are the only canon couples he's drawn together in the manga.</br>  <br> spends 10 chapters mercilessly shitting on it <br> people somehow regard it as the best thing ever  <br><br>Regardless, I'm sick of discussing pairings. I'm glad the new generation won't have any shipperfaggotry.<br><br>Salad's still a qt though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone know where this is from? Past threads and elsewhere say it's official art but it doesn't look like kishi art to me. Cute as fuck though  <br>Choji could kill him.<br><br>It would be a nice fight, choji vs lee.</br></br></br>  <br>Well with Sasori's flame throwers, he can in theory use all 5 elements. <br>All he needs to do is learn basic jutsu of each type and then just be smart and have a counter to everything by using the better element to counter. <br><br><br>It is pretty sweet. It's a shame Shino didn't have a kid, we could have gotten a rematch of bug v puppet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>You know that even two blacks can have a white baby, right?<br><br>Kishimoto obviously wanted to make a Chocho counterpart.</br></br></br>  Yeah...sorry.  How Lee would fare against fighters in his generation (cont'd)<br>Vs. Temari: He'll have to watch out for hurricane force winds. Will probably need to fight her in an area with lots of open space; hiding in a heavily forested area won't do anything against a woman who can deforest entire miles of woodland. Will need to open gates and hit her very hard and fast and he'll probably need to do it as soon as the fight starts or in between fan swings. Her summon will make the fight even more difficult she is allowed to use it. Fight will be much easier if he knows Hirudora.<br>Outcome: Victory if he knows Hirudora. Near Victory if he doesn't. Loss if he allows himself to get slammed and cut by wind.<br><br>Vs. Kankuro: Will need to have a medical kit on standby if he wants to fight unpoisoned. Will need to stay very sharp and alert when puppets are in play. Destroying them is risky and must only be done if there is no other choice. Will straight up lose if he allows Kankuro to make a puppet especially to combat his Taijutsu and has to fight it along with all the other puppets Kankuro has.<br>Outcome: Victory if he opens gates and remains a step ahead of Kankuros puppets movements. Will have to watch out for traps and poison regardless. Overwhelming loss if he shows up without a medical kit or at least antibiotics in case of poisoning.<br><br>Sasuke: Will need to go HAM if he wants to win. I'm talking about pulling all the stops. He'll need to be tactical and conserve his stamina, becuase this will be a loooong fight. Must avoid getting caught in Genjutsu, must avoid Amaterasu, must avoid Chidori, must avoid invisible Limbo clones. Must win before Sasuke activates Susano'o. 8th gate might even be necessary if the fight is allowed to swing in Sasukes favor for even a minute.<br>Outcome: Possible Victory if he brings his A game with EVERYTHING: speed, precision, tactics, stamina, the whole works. Will lose if he gets caught in Amaterasu or Genjutsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's going to rap like Bee, ninja eminem confirmed.</br>  <br>Truly the most beautiful love story of our time.</br>  <br>I'm just saying it's unlikely in the Kishiverse, where kids are perfect 50/50 mixes of their parents or clones. <br><br>Either that or B is a cuck and doesn't know it.</br></br></br>  <br>nah he is silent workhouse</br>  <br><br>Dafuq with gaara and his gay haircut</br></br>  <br>He's got the mark on his face, dude<br><br>It's Bee's kid</br></br></br>  <br>"Official art" doesn't necessary means Kishi's art.<br>But the source of that was some twitter, here's the real image</br></br>  <br>why mangapanda</br>  And finally:<br>Vs.Naruto: Naruto basically has Lee tier stamina on top of regen abilities. Lee will have to bring everything and more if he wants to win. Will have to make sure Naruto does not get to hit him with rasengans. Will have to make sure Naruto does not get to use Kyuubi Chakra mode, at least for long. Must avoid punches, especially if Naruto is in Sage or Kuubi Chakra mode; Naruto can rip limbs out effortlessly with those powerups active. Must be willing to go 8 gates if he wants to gain the upper hand in the fight. Hirudora will probably be effective against the Fox if Naruto summons it to the playing field. Lee will also have to deal with clones, but he must focus on getting close to the real one if he wants to win. Will lose if he allows Naruto to trick him multiple times in the fight. Frankly, he might need Night Lee to win this one.<br><br>So the verdict is: Lee can handily beat most people in his generation whose names aren't Naruto, Sasuke, Kankuro, Gaara, Hinata and Temari.</br></br></br>  <br>They also use sticks instead of forks.</br>  <br> implying it's not just paint </br>  <br> Kankuro, Gaara <br>Lee wrecked Gaara once, and he could do it again</br></br>  <br>To give Sarada a reason to go find her father while also acting as comic relief so things don't get edgy as fuck with just Naruto and two Uchiha hanging around.</br>  <br>Okay, fine, Lee can beat all of them. <br>But can he beat Uchiha Madara?</br></br>  <br> Implying that Hinata didn't come into the relationship pre-whipped. <br>I can't even imagine her saying no to Naruto.</br></br>  <br> So she can go from Queen Latifa to Beyonce eventually <br>I actually want to see this.</br></br>  <br> sucking Rock Lee's dick: the post </br>  <br> wrecked <br>That's funny, from Lee being crippled for life with only hope in operation with 50% success chance and Gaara participating in exam finals I took it that he was the one who lost.</br></br>  <br> Lee got laid <br> 10/10 didn't  <br>That's just sad. Wonder who the lucky lady is.</br></br></br>  <br>Lee *almost* wrecked Gaara and that was more than 20 years ago. Even pre-Boruto arc Gaara would've been a handful. But if Lee goes crazy and activates the gates soon after the match starts and relentlessly pounds on Gaara he will win. He also needs to make sure he doesn't get tricked again</br>  <br>Also can he be as sorry as Uchiha Sasuke?</br>  What's Boruto's sooper sekrit berzurk transformation? Byakugan isn't edgy like the Sharingan, he's not a jinchuuriki, nor does he have a cursed seal.  <br>Aw c'mon he gets shat on the most by the series and the fans. Lee could do with some lovin.</br>  <br>I liked her. Even if she's kinda dumb she seems to be genuinely good friends with Salad. It's kinda sad that I can't really think of a lot of good friends in Naruto. Most of them are either aquaintances, team mates or in some sort of unhealthy self destructive relationship.   plus I think she's kinda cute  </br>  <br>He's got some Kurama chakra, maybe he can go one tail.</br>  <br>It's said in Sakura's gaiden chapter that while Hinata seems meek, she's the type who grabs the reins in the relationship perhaps. She went through a whole character arc to gain more will power after all. When he confessed originally she put saving her sister over answering him as she thought he refused him.<br><br>Its easy enough to see her turning him down on some things.<br><br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the thing is the way your saying presenting it is that to win against naruto of sasuke have to act brain dead retarded for lee to even have a sliver of chance for winning. the situation you putting them in will realisticlly never happen</br></br>  <br>Which Madara we talkin about here?</br>  <br>Killer B is Geralt's father?</br>  <br>I'm beginning to think Kishimoto was heavily abused or something. Every single close relationship (Friends, Family, Marriage) looks like fucking nightmare.</br>  <br>He probably doesn't have one but I wouldn't be surprised if he pulled the Tenseigan out his ass because of Hinata's theoretical ability to get it.</br>  <br>I guess I'd consider it a step down in officiality compared to something like the family portraits or the breakfast table then. I wonder if it's marketing for The Last</br>  <br>Lee is the real hero of Naruto.<br><br> Manga starts of being about an outcast failure who has no talents or friends and has to work really hard to be accepted by his peers, and talks endlessly about how never giving up and hard work will get you places <br> By the end Naruto is not only a descendent of a god of ninja but a god himself, and turns out his father was one of the most respected ninja in their village's history <br> Meanwhile, Rock Lee is still a nobody </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit. Chou-chou actually looks pretty cute here.</br>  <br>Chouji had a good friendship going with Shikamaru.<br>Naruto getting along with Shikamaru seemed to be the best friendship that the poor fucker had that wasn't a weird obsession with the first friend his age he ever had who sadly happened to be an Uchiha fucking shit. He should have hanged around with Kiba, Shino and Chouji more so the show would have at least some semblance of the original idea of him making friends.<br>And from what we've seen of it Ino and Sakura were good friends until Sakura fucked it all up.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying they'll have to act retarded. I'm saying he'll have to avoid their attacks as best he can with extreme speed and hit with extreme force. Yes, its very unlikely he'll win. He'll probably die in the process after using the 8 gates. But there is a chance, so long as he doesn't get tricked. If he lets them trick him, no chance at all</br>  <br> Team mates don't count as friends <br>Come on, man. Shikamaru and Chouji are the fucking broest</br></br>  <br>that's probably as far as he could take it though, kurama would never even willing lend his power to him since boruto acts like a little shit and disrespects naruto. hell since naruto unedgyed him and stays with naruto willingly, he wont even tempt boruto to go beserk to get him to be released</br>    <br>What would be the ninja world equivalent of being so good at rapping that black people have no qualms at all about showing you respect?</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he's no-one. By now he's probably been acknowledged as Guys successor by the ninja world and Akatsuki level ninja like Itachi and Kisame knew Guy by reputation alone</br>  <br> &gt;Meanwhile, Rock Lee is still a nobody <br><br>Rock Lee beat Gaara a bit before the big war thing, thus proving that hard work overcomes mere talent.<br><br>People bitch saying Naruto ruined the message of the story; meanwhile Lee, Gai, Hinata, and a few others still entirely prove this whole loser becomes a winner thing.<br><br>Gai was born a no one and became the strongest ninja that beat Madara, rivaling Kakashi all his life. Hinata was born a no one with no talent but made her dream come true, eventually surpassed Neji during the war arc when his ghost gave her some words of wisdom. Lee was nothing at first, but was respected by all, and beat some ten tailed beasts and kicked Madara once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, Naruto really should consider Shikamaru his best friend. His unhealthy obsession with Sasuke would not be called friendship by any sane person.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with these people?<br>Their ability to look at a square and see a circle is almost impressive, in its own fucked up way.</br></br>  <br> ending 34 <br>Jesus christ</br></br>  I TOLD YOU SO  <br> Honestly, Naruto really should consider Shikamaru his best friend. <br>Rather sad when you think about it, given how Shikamaru's best friend is Chouji.</br></br>  <br>They honestly proved nothing at all. Yeah they showed weak people could become strong over time but honestly at the end hard work won nothing at all.</br>    <br><br>[ ] Not told<br>[X] Told</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have the byakugan, otherwise the people in charge of making his fighting moveset would advertise him as Naruto and Hinata's son.</br>  <br><br>Knights of the told Republic</br></br>  <br>I wish Kishi actually drew Sakura somewhat muscular. It'd be neat.</br>  <br>Didn't Hinata have ninja God genes all along as well?</br>  <br> Hinata:We are not naming the baby "Ramen" but...It would be such a cool name. <br> Naruto: Cool name..... Obito! </br></br>  <br>This shit is summer vacation as fuck, I love it</br>  <br><br>Leo Toldstoy</br></br>  <br>I feel that person was trying to make a point but I can't seem to understand what that point is.</br>  <br><br>Tic-Tac-Told</br></br>  <br><br>No country for told men</br></br>  <br><br>Battletolds</br></br>  That takes away from the message of bonds mattering over blood relation.<br><br>The same thing is going on with Kung Fu Panda 3.<br><br>But I did like that Karin was the bigger person in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He thinks Naruto's look to Sakura indicates he believes her to be the mother of his children. That is some first class delusions right there.</br>  <br><br>She's like a cat-lady.</br></br>  <br>It's a comm device, some others have them too</br>  <br>What else is even stranger is that neither Sasuke or Sakura have any relatives that wear glasses.<br><br>Gene's, man.

Naruto was made by Kishimoto, yes, but it is also a franchise owned by Shueisha, so anything made by them have some kind of "canonicity", if that makes sense. Despite not beign explicity said so by Kishimoto, I think the Hiden novels can be considered canon, for example. Rather than beign worried about what's "canon" or not based on who the author was (either kishimoto or some studio), I think "continuity" is much more important.<br>Sorry anon, this has not anything to do with your post, its just a rant I wanted to make</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone's gotta shop all the dramatic kakashi panels to have his full face</br>  <br> ntr <br> shounen manga <br> SS the most popular hetero ship <br> Kishi not a troll <br><br>Yea totally didn't see Sarada being Sakura's biokid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Filler movie where for some reason a bunch of Zetsus transformed into Akatsuki members and got manhandled by the Konoha ninjas.</br>  <br>it's from Road to Nigga.<br><br>They're a bunch of Zetzus</br></br></br>  <br>I never heard that. Maybe they get moments of eye problems?</br>  <br> my weak point is right here! Go for it! <br> no, not that way, you stupid shit </br></br>  <br>  But I did like that Karin was the bigger person in the end. <br>This. I liked how Karin ended up being a decent person while Sakura is forever stuck with her 12 years old mindset. The worst is that this bitch is apparently friend with Karin (at least Karin believes so) but she never told Salad about said friend (who also gifted her her glasses) and pasted her face onto her picture with Sasuke. Karin is truly superior with the selfless love 'I just want Sasusuke to be happy". If that's how Kishi treats characters he hates, then I hope he hates all his characters from now on.</br></br>  <br>He's what you call an otaku</br>  a simple answer to all your questions  <br>Incorrect.<br><br>The reason the side characters are best is because they remain side characters and so you fill in the blanks with headcanon.<br><br>Actual canon can never live up to that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was actually in the manga.<br>And that wasn't even Uchiha Madara in his original body.</br></br>  <br> But I did like that Karin was the bigger person in the end <br>And Sakura is still a shit for taping over her picture and never telling Salad about the woman who delivered her and gave her those glasses. <br><br>Fuck Pink Shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are Sakurafags so disgusting?</br>  <br>Metal Lee is a crossdresser?</br>  <br>you might be autistic but those told jokes are pretty funny. I've got one: told story</br>  <br>But if she told her about Karin then there wouldn't be a plot.</br>  I was wondering what happened to Kabuto.<br><br>Was that guy with him the same guy in that was with him back when they were in the orphanage?</br></br>   Gaiden finally ends <br> Sakura looks like a terrible human being for throwing Karin under the bus like that and freaking out instead of telling her daughter the mundane truth that she was born outside the village <br> Sauce is a deadbeat father of 12 years and leaves again at the end of the story <br>The only decent member of that family is Salad. She deserves better.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127494470 <br>It would be a 10/10 post if you got a dub.</br>  <br> SS the most popular hetero ship <br>Why do people think popularity means shit?<br>If it did then Kakashi and Iruka would have been made canon years ago and Itachi would still be alive.</br></br></br>  <br>It runs in the family.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127494550 <br>This is it.

It's nothing to be proud of though since anybody with half a brain saw this coming a mile away. It's still funny to think about how some anons kept insisting that Karin was the mom.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but she in particular had no talent among her family. She was born with nothing and was cast out, but worked hard anyway to get where she was until she was recognized to be pretty good, because she identified with that other nerdy kid who was a loser yet kept going.<br><br>Her sister had the natural talent in the family, and her cousin was even greater.

It's lazy and forced writing.</br></br></br>  <br>The gaiden should have been about Sarada learning the truth about Sasuke's side of the family.</br>  God, I hope Rock Lee is TOP General Ninja adviser to Naruto and where Sasuke respects and listens to his insight.

I feel like after Part I everyone just knows 1,000 justsu that could kill a man so something like getting riddled with Shuriken is hardly even a threat. How often does someone die from weaponry in that show?</br></br>  <br>I'm saying that she never had romantic feelings for Neji, nor would she ever had developed them. It's clearly stated in Konoha Hiden that Tenten never had interest in romance, and never will.</br>  <br> I'm saying that she never had romantic feelings for Neji, <br>What? She always admired Neji and shit.</br></br>  <br> so something like getting riddled with Shuriken is hardly even a threat <br>That was never a threat.

Of course it's obnoxious.</br>  <br>Lee is the only one who we saw grieving, as he was crying while holding Neji's head. Tenten just looked kinda disappointed. I forget exactly how Guy reacted, but he certainly wasn't as broken up about it as Lee.</br>  <br>Why Shikamaru looks like a mudslim?</br>  <br>I just watched it and Gai just stands there with his mouth open like fucking Kiba and everyone else.</br>  http://f.st-hatena.com/images/fotol<wbr>ife/j/jjtaro_maru/20120512/20120512<wbr>135332.jpg<br>http://f.st-hatena.com/images/fotol<wbr>ife/j/jjtaro_maru/20120512/20120512<wbr>135721.jpg</wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>He was stoic about it because the battlefield is not a place to grieve.</br>  <br> expecting Naruto to have any serious risks as a manga after they made something as predictable as Tobi being Obito all along </br>  <br><br>thats not metal lee</br></br>  <br> implying he didnt secretly convert to Jashinism after seeing his master die like a bitch <br>Jashin Akbar!!!</br></br>  <br>It's even stupider in the english dub because they translate it to "Cha!"<br>It's nonsense. Sakura is nonsense.</br></br>  <br>Please, I bet he still stops to eat and sleep.</br>  <br>Because Nishio Tetsuya and Suzuki Hirofumi. The characters always look retarded for the movies and promo stuff.</br>  <br> actually, that might be Gaara's kid. <br> Gaara and Kankuro actually did resemble each other <br>I'm pretty sure Gaara adopted his kids according to the novels, unless whoever said that was rusing.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the first one?</br>  <br>Since Kishimoto's very first sketch of her, Sakura was not a cute girl.</br>    <br>Aren't they still canon though?</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure at one point she said cha cha cha in the dub to make up for the syllables. <br>How cringeworthy.</br></br>   ??? <br>Good job jannytards. You're afraid to touch bad threads just because they're narutard threads?</br>  <br>Tenten looks so much better with her hair not in those buns.</br>    <br>Why would they be? Has Kishimoto come out and said they are? At this point the only relevant shit is chapters 1-700, The Last which Kishimoto has said ties into 700, the Gaiden, and the Bolt movie which he said he wrote 100% himself.</br>    <br>He did say the movie and novels are canon. He's basically just signed the franchise over to SP at this point.</br>  <br>They're conected to The Last/ ch. 700 timeline but Kishi has not said anything about their canonness nor has he made any reference to them in Gaiden.</br>  <br>It's weird. The only actual gods we hear about are Jashin and the Shinigami. Supposedly there is a religion what with the nuns.<br><br>The only other thing we hear about are the ones that are like demigods. I doubt that Kaguya and her race are naturally powerful. It's just the others had also eaten the fruit of their shinju tree.</br></br></br>  <br>Much as I might hate Lucas, I do like the tiered system of canon he's set up for Star Wars EU.<br>While the canon nature of the novels can certainly be questioned, and the moment Kishi wants to come along and make something set in that era which contradicts a novel, said novel is discarded immediately, it should be given more acknowledgement than, say, the Lee spinoff or filler episodes in the anime (where Ino gets a golden shower from Naruto, for instance), even though it is all licensed material.</br></br>  Is Naruto/Hinata the greatest Nardo ship or is that spot reserved for Shika/Tema?  <br>Where has he said that? The Kakashi Gaiden was called side story, but it's written by the Blood Prison guy and Blood Prison is mentioned in the novel. Nothing else has been stated from what I can find.</br>  New Side Story?  wut is dis  I believe its tied to Garden of Avalon LN waiting for more scans.  <br>For what?</br>  I thought it was about Takeuchi's london adventures  <br>I assumed that it is what it is and would expect it in the BD Box.<br><br>Sounds interesting as hearing about Saber entering Avalon would be a interesting story.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if she sees Shirou and Rin before going in, or at least sees Shirou visiting her grave.</br>  I expect more Saber scans, Takeuchi  <br>How would Saber react if she were to see the state of England? now?</br>  <br>Excaliblast the place. Also, the very name "England" implies that it does not belong to her. So she would assumedly try to restore her people (modern day Welsh and other fringe Celtics I believe) to the island of Britain.</br>  <br>It's not listed on the bullet points of BD features. The extra for volume II is a drama CD about life at the Clock Tower.</br>  <br>every time i see something new with saber, makes me wish they announced a Fate route readaptation</br>  <br>Garden Avalon didn't get announced for a while either.<br><br>We just have to wait.</br></br></br>  <br> I believe its tied to Garden of Avalon LN waiting for more scans. <br>And awaiting for translations as well.<br>GoA seemed interesting since it's the first time we get to hear more about the Other Side, and Avalon.<br>Merlin being introduced was even better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they announced that it would come with a book, but they kept the specifics until later. There's no mention of a book with the BDs.</br>  <br>You and me both</br>  <br>To be honest, rather than a re-adaptation, I would prefer to see it reworked, rewritten, but keeping the basic stuff like Saber being the main heroine and love interest, and Shirou aspiring to be a hero of justice.<br>In fact, it would be nice that if they decide to work on it after UBW and HF, keep some of the themes and adapt it to a Fate route in which Nasu tells us a story about a broken human being, regaining his humanity and still desiring to save people.</br></br>  <br>Well that's what most of us mean when we say readaptation, since Nasu himself said he wanted to rework it.</br>  <br>sure, they just need to<br> trim down on the world building an info dumping <br> Show us more of sabers rule during shirous dream, like the knights and round table, losing caliburn, mordred, etc <br> show us the fights like, gil vs assassin, archer vs berserker, lancer vs gil, etc <br>maybe even expand the whole kotomine/rin/azoth dagger thing, or iliya with shirou /kerry and saber/irisviel stuff<br><br>and animate Last Episode</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't this just an illustration of Takeuchi's trip to England?</br>  <br>Is this supposed to be a parody of something?</br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Guess we'll have to wait for confirmation from BL</br>  <br>anyone that speaks moonrunes, whats it say on the side</br>  <br>go back to reddit.</br>  <br> reddit <br>are you retarded</br></br>  is this a saber thread<br>please let it be, i miss those</br>  Do Saberfags really believe they will get a Fate route readaptation? I mean there is a higher chance of GoA getting an anime instead of the former.  <br>Not really, but it's nice to believe.</br>  <br>summerfag detected</br>  <br>did takeuchi give saber bigger breasts</br>  <br>Saber's breast size changes depending on Takeuchi's mood</br>    <br>pretty sure this is just an artbook of takeuchi's trip to london</br>  <br>That's what I thought they were going to do initially back when they first announced F/SN 2014 and that it would be an original scenario related to the Fate route written by Nasu but I guess somewhere along the way they scrapped those plans.</br>  <br> that Saber </br>  <br>If they ever do an animated or novel side story about post UBW, I hope it's about the destruction of the greater grail and servants can still get involved somehow, so Shirou gets Modred. Just Imagine, the Faker and the Fake, damn it Typemoon surely likes to tease.</br>    <br>They obviously haven't animated shit for the movies yet considering the amount of "fucking nothing" we constantly see every time they brought up the movie.</br>  <br> Sample <br>SCANS WHEN</br></br>  Garden of Avalon anime when?  <br>Literally nothing.<br><br>2017 at the earliest.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>yes its takeuchi chuuni log about talking to his waifu's homeland when he was in London<br><br>garden of avalon is shit its just saberwank and merlin is a whiteknight faggot this the reason why BL dont bother do translate it<br><br>i prefer every other shit than the fate route its the worst route anyways</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW after story <br> Destruction of the greater grail <br> A battle between two factions of wizards for the future of the Grail with the same violence of a holy war. <br> Servants are involved with alternative methods <br> Shirou Get Morderd. <br> Badass Lord el-melloi ii <br> Adult Rin <br> More Edelfelt. <br><br>Fuck, i want this shit NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source</br>  <br> Shirou Get Morderd. <br><br>Shirou's not part of the destruction of the Great Grail.</br></br></br>  <br>only in fate route, He's only not mentioned because in both after Fate and UBW the GG gets destroyed with Rin and Waver faction, in which would obviously take part after UBW. I'm also curious of what Sakura/Zouken would be doing while this happens</br>  <br> Shirou's not part of the destruction of the Great Grail. <br>He's not mentioned, that doesn't mean he couldn't be part of it, It would make no sense he's not part of it neither post fate or UBW unless he's dead at that point or something.</br></br>  <br>Does not matter, the details of the dismantling of the Grail are deliberately vague. It is said only that it degenerates into conflict worthy of an holy war for magnitude. Velvet and Rin come first, but then, it become a war between two factions, therefore, others join them. They can invent the rest as they want, as well as add servants summoned in an unconventional way, creating monsters that do nothing but worsen the situation.</br>  <br>This is problematic, I really want at least a spinoff novel of these events, but then again Nasu said he would want to work with the butcher one more time, imagine urobuchi writing some event like that. it could be really catastrophic.<br><br>I mean the plot devices are there<br> Avenger still around <br> Zouken possibly still around <br> Shinji still around <br> Sakura definitely still around, the older you get, more unchangeable you become <br> Caren possibly still around <br> El Melloi II hating japan <br> Adult Rin <br> Shirou already full grown and after suppasing Archer (with his sassy attitude as a plus) <br> Nothing say servants can't be summoned again <br> Even more broken servants can be summoned since the grail is even more broken than the last two wars. <br> Luvia can be either faction depending on her motives <br><br>And if you wanna asspull some Fanfic material to troll the audience<br> El Melloi II own saber clone apprentice coming too. <br> Modred trolling Shirou/Rin summoning via Avalon x Excalibur <br> Apocrypha servant faction system <br>   maybe Zombie Kirei, for the keks <br> Rin getting Cu   She came back when she got older <br><br>Just get a new protagonist and voila. The setting is really rich. You just need a good writer.<br><br>Actually if Case files can be a prequel to the 5th war, why can something like this come out of it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garden of avalon is shit its just saberwank and merlin is a whiteknight faggot this the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br>What? Merlin is always described as a pervert and a troll by saber</br></br>  <br>can you fuck off</br>  <br> the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br><br>Since when do Beast's Lair translate anything? It took them 12 years to get Fate/hollow ataraxia out of the door.</br></br></br>  <br>Best stories are always the ones that are not narrated.</br>  <br>but this one is already partly narrated in a side material. So it qualifies more as an unfinished one.</br>  Now that UBW is finished and HF movie is on the way, Fate route readaptation when  <br>Aren't they still trying to figure out how to adapt HF without messing it up?</br>  <br>that'll depend how many movies it'll get, even then most people only care about the last 3 days of that route, with some stuff from the previous days here and there</br>  Unpopular opinion.<br>I preferred the movie UBW than the TV series.<br><br>50 episodes were absolutely too many and the second part unsatisfactory the film, while cutting a lot of stuff, managed the whole much better than Ufotable.</br></br></br>  <br>They will really rush the first half anyway. It's pacing gonna be even worse than ubw</br>  <br>Managed what better mister Bait?</br>  <br> partly narrated <br><br>Explains, exactly, how much is told of these events, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi's chuuni travel diary about visiting the homeland of his waifu</br>  <br>I would buy even Nasu's underwear to see something like this some day.</br>  <br>I dunno, man. The movie had some great music but everything else was a shitshow. Take another look at the Berserker scene with Gilgamesh, especially when he uses Chains of Heaven. So fucking dumb.</br>  <br><br> eating again </br></br>  <br> that pic <br>Smile status<br>Not saved</br></br></br>   that moment of hesitation  <br>Pretty dank.</br>  <br>I'm not even sure if the music really worked that well in hindsight. Watching the movie it just kind of pounds away at you constantly. <br><br>Like, it's trying to constantly force you to be excited to make you not think about how terrible everything else is being handled.</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi needs to chill</br>  <br>Shirou, the housewife man, Modred the tomboy, I can dig this</br>  Why is Saber such a best?  <br>Takeuchi is allowed to do anything he wants<br><br> Let Nasu lived with him while he was working on getting their company started <br> Sold a bunch of his collection to help support Nasu <br> Talked Nasu into having maids in the series which resulted in Kohaku and Hisui (prototype of Saber) <br> Talked Nasu into giving Fate another shot after they left a event where they sold Tsukihime <br> Over a decade later they are still best friends <br><br>If he wants to do things with Saber let him do things with Saber.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because even sakura fags and rin fags love her equally</br>  <br>Resistance is futile.</br>  <br>Actually I don't care for her much, she's really overrated.</br>  <br>The probleme of this novels is that rely on Naruto fanbase level who get angry in original details has not been met to perfection, details often ridiculous. (As combat occurs, or some side scene). I dont fucking care. <br><br>The movie contains all the major events necessary to understand the story. The relationship between Shirou and Archer works without the excessive autism of the TV series (which reaches the pedantry during the duel between Archer and Shirou). <br>At the end is a good movie with a good rhythm and heroic atmosphere. <br><br>An adequate synopsis. <br>I personally approached the Novels from the movie and still now that I know the side material I think they did a good job. I especially like how they handle the timing of events.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  S A B E R<br>A<br>B<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she works okay as a mother-like figure to Shirou, like how Nasu was going with her in UBW.</br>  <br>THE CUTEST KING</br>  <br>It sounds like you have the attention span of a 10 year old and shouldn't be watching anything Fate related in the first place.</br>  <br>Are you actually serious? The movie simply does not work from a narrative standpoint. It has none of the rhythm you're talking about. I actually figured out the timeline of events in the movie a little while back. Excuse the copypasta.<br><br>I just rewatched the UBW movie for shits and giggles, and I just realized something. Shirou has the craziest week ever.<br><br>I wanna break this down. Due to the truncated nature of the narrative, stuff happens sooner than in the VN. Everything starts normal, Shirou summons Saber, and then the Berserker fight happens, but the very next morning has Rin moving into his house, then them going to school, finding the boundary field, fighting Rider, going back to the school, seeing it's full of skeletons, and ultimately finding Rider dead and having the boundary field dispersed.<br><br>What has to be just about 24 hours after dealing Berserker- maybe less, Shirou gets hypnotized into coming to the temple and seeing Caster. He then gets lectured and almost killed by Archer. By the time he gets back to the house, wound still on his shoulder from Archer, Caster has nabbed Taiga and Rule Broken Saber.<br><br>This means Shirou had Saber for essentially one day in the movie. I'm serious. That very same night, Caster invades Kirei's church, takes it over, and then Rin and Archer attack her and the betrayal happens. The sun doesn't even come up before Caster gets another servant.<br><br>At this point, it's morning, and they head over the Einzbern Castle, so we're on essentially day 5 of what would happen in the novel, but the rest of the movie plays out like it would if they were on day 14-16, but at most, it all ends on the actual day 7.<br><br>What's funny is that they all act like time has passed, particularly early on, but if you look, it doesn't added up, especially with the nods to continuity they give to past scenes, like Shirou's wounds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Mordred.</br>   You will never hold Saber <br>;_;</br>  <br>UBW should've been 18-20 episodes.<br><br>Split cour with 10 episodes would've been perfect. Learn from Prisma Illya.</br></br></br>    <br>It was fine. It really wasn't any slower than Zero.</br>  <br>Did you see the bit with Shirou deflecting Caster's magic with his wooden sword? The new fans have no idea what they've got before they had ufotable take over.</br>  <br>Man there's tons of shit in the movie that just shows DEEN gave no shits.<br><br>Pic related. This is a shot from what should technically be day 4, but Shirou has all his command seals.<br><br>In the UBW route.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i liked the romance, just change some things here and there and its great, love the whole soulmates thing they have going on<br><br>Even the RN replacement of the second eroge scene is the most romantic scene in the entire VN.<br><br> Shirou calling Saber, Arturia... <br> Sword rests in her sheet <br> talking separated by the sliding door <br> kissing under the moonlight <br> sleeping together in the same futon and handholding under the covers <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm looking at it now and see that Shinji happily revealed himself when he wasn't supposed to. I'll continue to find other 'fascinating' content.</br>  <br>Deen and JC staff need to burn down to bankrupt for what they did to typemoon franchises and many others</br>  How is the mana transfer explained in the all ages version?  <br>DOLPHINS</br>  <br> autism <br>Stopped reading there, go back to </br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh can't teleport, can he?</br>  <br>Archer predicts Lancer's next moves and prepares Rho Aias. By the way, he never trash talked Lancer so I have no idea where this is going.</br>  <br>One of the weirdest things is that they, early on, is that Rin moves into Shirou's house. You know, like in the Fate route?<br><br>This doesn't happen at all in the actual UBW route, though, but even if you just go with it from a movie original kind of point of view, it literally serves no purpose. It never adds anything to the plot other than having a SoL scene where Saber, Rin, and Sakura eat while Taiga freaks out.</br></br></br>  <br>You'll also notice that Archer doesn't get hurt by Gae Bolg at all. He just tanks it.</br>  <br>Fucking JC Staff only now got a bit good, but did a lot of BULLSHIT with Index before that.</br>  So, how was the best Arturia fanboy of the Round table? All this knight absolutely in love for their King, and none of them able to dent her armor like a certain Japanese student.  <br> nothing personnel kid </br>    <br> One piece and two piece swimsuit version of SEIBAH <br>TRULY SHIROU IS THE OWNER OF ALL SABERS.</br></br>  <br>She just looks so cuddly and adorable. Oh well, it's okay, as long as someone else who truly loves her gets to hold her, then it's all daijoubu.</br>  <br>Why does a random chinese doujin VN have such nice art.</br>  <br>I would hesitate to call this the highlight of the movie.</br>  <br>You wanna talk about big swords? Bakuya was half-way to Overedge in this shot.<br><br>Keep in mind, this scene is where they put the money.</br></br></br>  <br>This certainly is the highlight: Gilgamesh being a maniac.</br>  <br> You will never make Shirou smile. <br><br><br>I was disappointed that UFO didn't give a take on Gil's crazy face.</br></br></br></br>  I've been thinking about trying to recreate the DEEN movie using scenes from ufotable's UBW. Would it be possible?  <br>Why did the thing on his shoulder disappear? Was that supposed to happen?</br>  <br>So cute... I would like to see Saber playing at Dark souls.</br>  <br>Mostly, actually. One thing thing that I think DEEN did that Ufo didn't was have Shirou walk Sakura home at the beginning of the story.</br>  <br>Shirou has Saber's sword while Gilgamesh is parrying him. For reasons unknown he chose not to use the Gate of Babylon or a mighty powerful shield.</br>  <br>I think so actually. It disappeared in the Ufotable version too. It was to show he was out of mana.</br>  <br>The DEEN version of that fight is just ridiculous compared to Ufotable's. Shirou summons UBW, and proceeds to use it for jackshit.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh: "Impossible!" <br><br>It really is impossible, Shirou shouldn't have this weapon in stock.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that a catalyst of Heaven's Feel?</br>  <br>Gilgamesh's sword shattered against the weight of Saber's Caliburn that Shirou shouldn't have? Nothing to say here, really.</br>  <br>One of them. You have to get a certain amount of Sakura points</br>  <br>One of them, but DEEN seriously just didn't care.</br>  <br>I think it is. Walking Sakura home and going to visit her before going to work and find Zouken.</br>  <br>Look, there it is! It's Ea!</br>  <br>No hesitation in the movie.</br>  <br>Shirou carefully decides to drop Caliburn to trace on Kanshou and Bakuya: Gan Jiang and Mo Ye. Wonder if he knows what all the swords in the ground are here for? Decoration? Scenery?<br><br><br>Shirou with Caliburn is not a mess to be trifled with, clearly.</br></br></br></br>  I remember the chills I felt when Shirou summoned UBW in the TV series. I laughed when it happened in the movie.  <br> Decoration? Scenery? <br><br>Mostly</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn, it looks like shit, what the hell?</br>  <br>Gilgamesh tries to catch his arm that flew onto the other side of UBW. Unlike the recent version, Angra Mainyu rips this reality marble apart while Shirou just kinda watches and wonders what to cook for Fuji-nee and Sakura.</br>  The only thing I think the movie did better than the tv series were archer shooting his bow when Saber was fighting Berserker - The hill seems far cooler than the building, not only that but the pan out was really cool too, you could really feel the scale of the shot.  <br>I just remembered there's a Dead End where Shirou jumps in with Gilgamesh for some reason. Shame they didn't animate that here, it certainly would have been an interesting ending for sure.</br>  <br>They got caladbolg's design wrong in the movie.</br>  <br>Everything else was so-so, but at least Sakura got a cameo!</br>  <br>They both fall into the Great Holy Grail there.</br>  Was this picture actually used in latest Type-Moon Ace?<br><br>Damn.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking overall execution, not the nitty gritty details, technically the TV series is the right version since the CG didn't fit the text written, but I feel the movie version was just much cooler.</br>  <br>Well, now I am left here to wonder who this movie was aimed at. I hope it was financially successful for Type-Moon and Studio DEEN, I guess.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this?<br>So that must be where Shirou gets the JACKHAMMER from.</br></br>  <br>TM doesn't recognize it exists. In the interview for the UBW BDs, the TV show is referred to as being the first time it's been adapted.</br>  <br>I don't blame them. This 'movie' and the 2006 TV series are on the same level as J.C staff Tsukihime, surely.</br>  <br>Im under the impression that DEEN realized they were most likely about to lose the franchise and wanted to get 1 more thing out before so they can make some quick money.</br>  will we ever see her smile being protected  <br>What's wrong with the current state of England?</br>    <br>It's not "her" kingdom. Her kingdom has been destroyed and is now just a portion of a all new state. <br>There is nothing wrong with the current state of England, it's just that Arthuria has nothing to do with it.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah... I forgot about these faggots.</br>  <br>The trigger for HF is that Alzheimer bitch seeing Shirou and remembering he wanted Illya because of his dad.</br>  <br>why would you spend so much time on turning gold into shit?</br>  <br>As far as King Arthur is concerned? The fact it's England at all. England the country was created because her enemies took over Briton. Her people are Briton's, not Anglo Saxons.</br>  <br>wrong caladbolg  Hilariously Archer actually used the right caladbolg agaisnt berserker OC fight in DEEN 2006 fate , the only thing they did good was the pacing of that scene, the hype for archer charging his arrow was neat, but ruined at the moment they showed random flashback from archers perspectives about shirou and saber really not trying to hide the major twist of the movie. They made the scene being nonstop action with a background music, IMO UFO "tried too hard" with this scene on the other hand.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that if JC Staff managed to adapt tsukihime into 26 episodes it wouldn't had been such a blasphemy as it ended being</br>      <br>It's time.</br>    <br>Why was Rin there?<br><br><br>I loved the dream scene. And the other dream where UBW went out of control too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who will save ISIS in their darkest hour?</br></br>    Saber watching UBW is finally over  <br>that was the cutest ride, thanks saber</br>  武内：「Heaven’s Feel」がどういった形態で制作することになるのか、これから固めるので<wbr><br>詳しいことはいえませんが、「UBW」同様に見る人を驚かせるものになると<wbr>思います。</wbr></br></wbr>  <br>please TM, fate route someday</br>  <br>just let it die<br> Like Shirou did </br></br>  <br>I rather want an episode about her past.</br>  <br>fate route readaptation would be perfect for that</br>  I want to marry Saber!    <br>In many ways this was the coolest fight of the series for me, definitely compared to UBW.</br>  <br>It was certainly one of the more memorable scenes in F/SN.</br>  Was she only in this story to be kidnapped?<br>That seems like a bit of a waste.</br>    <br> Missing the point <br>Taiga gets kidnapped to show how batshit insane Shirou is</br></br>  <br> Saber watching UBW is finally over <br><br>It was great, I liked those series way more than the actual UBW anime. They could animate those short scenes for BD specials.</br></br></br>  <br>I want Saber to be my daughter.</br>  <br>I like Saber and all, but how many fucking alternate versions of her should there be?</br>  <br>i just ignore them besides saber arturia and maybe even nero or mordred</br>  <br>But she basically just disappears after that part, though.<br>What's the point of showing how much Shirou cares about her if she becomes completely irrelevant for the rest of the show?</br></br>  <br> show <br>Way to miss the point of the scene, its not to show his affection. Its to show how he would murder Rin without batting an eye.</br></br>  <br> Its to show how he would murder Rin without batting an eye. <br>Which is straight up wrong.</br></br>  <br>Animeonly fag please</br>  <br>Sorry but how do you describe mentaly blanking out as "without batting an eye" ?<br>That just requires way too much doublethink</br></br>  <br>He states in in clear terms, if Rin takes a step he will kill her.</br>  <br> He states in in clear terms, <br>No he doesn't.<br>In fact the word "kill" never appears.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm unsure if this is Shirou, Gilgamesh, Gilles or Lancelot making the post.</br>  <br>Gawain please, you already have Artoria.</br>  <br>Why would a servant have a command spell?</br>  Remember, Nasu said that a Saber anime series is inevitable.  <br>Because nobody likes her.<br>If UFO gave Taiga anymore screen time, they would start losing money.</br></br>  <br> Because nobody likes her. <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>It's amazing that two male character got that many votes</br>  <br>Fate/Zero is overrun with Fujoshi and Archer just makes everyone homo.</br>  <br>Fujos strong</br>  <br> Iya this low <br>Even Japan knows she's a garbage character.</br></br>  <br>I'd like to see you try and prove me wrong.<br> You can't, though. </br></br>  <br>Everyone loves her, except Shirou.</br>  <br>I really wonder how anyone can literally defend a religion that literally denounces freedom. <br><br>Well, I guess that's why they're in a police state, because they share beliefs.</br></br></br>  <br>How old do you think that image is?</br>  <br>Because she's not a servant here, but a Master.<br>No idea about her servant.</br></br>  <br>Will she suffer bullying from the Japanese?</br>  <br><br>Archer has always been insanely popular for a male character from the very first popularity poll. Nasu freaks out about it and everything.</br></br>  <br>It's why I said he makes everyone homo, no one can deny a tragic hero.</br>  <br>Why the fuck is Kohaku the second most popular Tsukihime? She's the fucking villain, she should be dead last.</br>  <br>People like sluts</br>  <br>You might also ask why Sakura is in top10</br>  <br>My brother!</br>  <br>Will the Saber anime have an arc where she and Gawain go around fucking women for a year in order to save Gawain from a curse?</br>  <br><br><br>Please don't bully Kohaku. Without her Tsukihime would be mediocre as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Tsukihime would be mediocre as fuck. <br>that's not saying much.</br></br>  <br>Mostly because of the joke roles she's been given in other works<br><br> I'd say she's the 3rd best from Tsukihime, still </br></br></br>  <br> Without her Tsukihime would be mediocre as fuck <br>You mean it isn't?</br></br>  <br>Kohaku's the best. Give her the white ribbon back already you piece of shit</br>  <br>Kohaku a shit.</br>  <br>Lancelot had not fucked Guenièvre?</br>  <br>This is Master Artoria. An alternate universe Seiba where Gawain's her father &amp; Lancelot, Key &amp; Bedivere are her brothers. Her boyish traits are due to growing up in a household filled with men instead of pretending to be a man this time.</br>  <br> Implying Lancelot didn't want his king more <br>Lancelot knew that his king wouldn't be romantically interested in him so he went after his king's sloppy seconds.</br></br>    <br>how long until mordred kills shirou for treating her as a girl?<br><br>also<br><br>nero &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arthuria</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>England has been overrun with Saxons and successful invaded by the Normans.</br>  <br> nero &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arthuria <br>Poor taste anon. An imitation can't be better than the original.</br></br>  <br>didn't arthuria encourage the relation between lancelot and guenievre?</br>  <br>And she summon who as a servant? Shirou? kiritsugu? Spike spiegel?</br>  <br>Basically Saber is a CUCK</br>  <br>But she had to stop them out of duty.<br><br>Lancelot even states his preference for his king in the Einzbern Consultation Room. Had Seiba accepted Lancelot's feelings, things might have ended better.</br></br></br>  <br>If shes lucky Taiga</br>  <br>but in terms of looks it is arthuria who copied nero.<br><br>as nero predates her.</br></br></br>  <br> nero predates her <br>The Throne of Heroes is beyond time. The superior king was conceptualized by Nasu prior to the inferior emperor was.</br></br>  <br> All those new scenes <br>NOICE</br></br>  <br>nero is still better</br>  <br>You are going to attract Gawain with so many pro-Nero posts anon. Nero isn't even the best emperor anyways.</br>  <br>so who has the best stats as a servant<br>arthuria?<br>nero<br>or mordred?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Nero from Extra , but picture her as an Arturia doppelganger always annoyed me. <br>I would have preferred if she had her own appearance. <br><br>Anyways Tamamo is best route in Extra, so.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering some of the legends of king arthur claims that Arthur decents from Royal Roman blood, Nero could be Arturia GrandGrandGrandmother in universe as far as we know</br></br>  i actualy like the design of mordreds armor, it looks better then arthurias  <br> she had her own appearance <br>Like this?</br></br>  <br> how long until mordred kills shirou for treating her as a girl? <br>What are you talking about? There can't be more sexual tension than that, a tomboy and a housewife man, rough sex insured</br></br>  <br>The King of course.</br>  <br>wow, it make sense (almost).<br><br><br>Mordred is magnificent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>different hair color or style then?</br>  <br> Implying Nero could have reproduced while concealing her gender </br>  <br>are that their top stats? or could they potentialy get higher stats with different masters?</br>  <br> Shirou calling her Arthur  <br><br>Someone post a screen he never did this in my philanthropy?</br></br></br>  <br>Here is the updated version.</br>  <br>For Nero, likely. Hakuno was able to max out just about every servant he/she gets.<br><br>For Arturia, Rin's said to be very compatible &amp; able to supply all the prana needed unlike Shirou.<br><br>Mordred? I'm unsure. She seems to be at her best but she was always a poor man's Arturia. Even without Avalon, Arturia is superior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like this. Obviously we are talking about Fate universe were where everyone has anime design. Of course it would be better if Nasu take a book of folklore and looking for a true heroine not some rule 63.<br><br>Brunilde, Queen Gwendolyn , Bradamante, Tomoe Gozen , there are so many to use.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, it's Rome we are talking about</br>  <br>  I mean there is a higher chance of GoA getting an anime instead of the former. <br><br>Why? From a purely popularity = financial reward point of view, Fate would be a no-brainer to adapt.</br></br></br>    <br>Emperor Nero was said to do all sorts of crazy shit. Apparently not in the Nasuverse.</br>  <br> giving Saber a highly competitive game like Dark Souls to play <br><br>Oh god she wouldnt stop until she was in full Havels with the Dad mask and Zaphandler.</br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I can see that angle. <br><br>For me, she has that soulmate with Shirou sword and sheath imagery going on. And their little moments and 2nd H-scene at the end of Fate I found highly romantic. Its just a shame there wasnt enough of it and it wasnt particularly well handled around the middle point of the route.<br><br>Then again, if we get a Fate adaption I can see it addressing all my problems with the original route. It would be glorious</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the true one was a real psychopath.</br>  <br>Huh, Nasu never really gave out stats on Herc Berseker under Dark Sakura didn't he?</br>  <br>They never changed</br>  <br>Because despite being a villan and despite being uttlerly fucked in the head, she is still incredibly endearing and her situation is highly sympathetic. In many ways, Nasu's best characters are the ones who are absolutely insane. Nasu handles aspects and versions of insanity very creatively and effectively in my opinion.<br><br>Also, head haired maid.</br></br></br>  <br>Too heavy. Probably she would seek to replicate her own build in the game. A Mage Knight who uses Moonlight Greatsword spamming special power as if it were Excalibar.<br>But yes, would be stubborn to have 100%</br></br>  <br> Boomelancer </br>  <br>This image pleases my autism.<br>Can't stand how Extra!Rin is the same as F/SN!Rin in the english ones.</br></br>  <br>She didnt stop them at all and was more than happy for them to love eachother, just as long as they kept it to themselves.<br><br>Guinneivere was her best friend and someone who was almost a sister to her and Lancelot was her most loyal knight and closest advisor. She was fond of both of them and happy for them.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls nerf Ramesses.</br>  <br> Can hit an infinite amount of targets and has an infinite max range <br> Rank: B+ <br><br>This shouldn't upset me but it does</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you ready for Moe Attila chan?</br>  <br>The events of the second half were better in the movie than the series.</br>  <br>But Lancelot admits that he would rather have his king than his queen. I bet he only slept with the queen to get the feeling of screwing his king.</br>  Got my TM Ace in today.<br><br>Looks like a few things still need to be scanned online.</br></br>  <br>R I N</br>  <br>you will destroy your precious TM Ace 10 for us ?<br><br>my respect.</br></br></br>  <br>Apart from the duel with Gilgamesh (which is still a bit 'too celebratory towards Shirou), the second was a big step back from the first part.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>goddamn, the movie was such a lovely mess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd love a better pic of this.</br>  <br>When did I ever say that?<br><br>You guys have to keep waiting.<br><br>It did come with a Drama CD it looks like so I may rip it later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rude ;-;</br>  <br>Some guy on BL is going to scan it</br>  <br>I'm all in for fanfic material</br>  <br> that Shirou <br> that Rin <br>Those two always make me happy.<br>Am I the only one that likes Takeuchi new style more than the old one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's great, except it makes everyone look like Saber, even the males.</br>  <br>I do<br><br> And I also don't really see the whole 'sameface' thing with Shirou/Shiki and Saber/Arc </br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi in general has improved a lot. He has some same-face problems though and some people don't like his side-mouths.</br>  <br>why is Shirou on there twice?</br>   Drama CD starts with Nero talking over EMIYA   <br>he also still has anatomy errors<br><br>his coloring hides it</br></br></br>  <br>Because future Shirou is more kakkoi than young Shirou.</br>  <br>Aw shit<br><br>Drama CD is a crossover<br>Nero was summoned to the 5th war by  Caster </br></br></br></br>  <br>   I also don't really see the whole 'sameface' thing with Shirou/Shiki and Saber/Arc <br>Neither I have.<br>I can understand Shirou and Shiki thought, they look kind of similar, but Saber/Arc look nothing alike.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin at least doesn't look like Saber.</br>  <br>A difference in eye and hair color does not make them different looking.</br>  <br>Archer summoned by Rani</br>  <br> And I also don't really see the whole 'sameface' thing with Shirou/Shiki and Saber/Arc <br><br>Its just an epic meme that those rather new to the fanbase like to harp on about.</br></br></br>  <br>With the change in Ciel's hairstyle Rin is the only female character with an unique hairstyle</br>    <br>Yeah she is more unique now.

Do us a favour please.</br>  <br>Oh shit.</br>  <br>So is this a new spin-off or something?</br>  <br>Did Medusa and Drake do the fusion dance?</br>  <br>I was wondering why Rin wasn't involved in this . Guess they kept her for the drama CD.</br>  <br>So that's 3 King Arthurs there?</br>  <br>I want it so much now... anon why you do this to me?</br>  When did Shirou trace Rho Aias by the way?    <br> Waver and Astolfo <br>I bet Astolfo will see Waver's a mopy brat and then try to cheer him up by raping Zeechan.</br></br>  <br><br>Guess what?<br> Rule Breaker gets stuck in Passionlip's chest <br><br>I don't even know that much moon but anyone with TM knowledge knows exactly what is going on.

We're edging closer and closer to peak Arthur saturation.</br>  <br>3 Arthurs and 2 Emiyas</br>  <br>Is that Blackened Arthur?</br>  <br>I wish it was Gawain instead.

Will you love me now?  <br> throwing blades <br><br>He's Assassin, threy are messing with the multi-class thing</br></br></br>  <br>The perspective on that butt is all off.</br>  <br> learned how to please a man <br>Who was the teacher? Was it self-taught?</br></br>  <br>Team daddy issues a best.</br>  <br>Arturia should've been a Lancer since Mordred is already there.</br>  <br>Lancelot is a very good teacher. He already taught Guinevere how to please a man.</br>  <br>I'm not sure she can be anything but Saber, unless she's summoned from the Throne instead of from the past.</br>  <br> Makiri Sakura has another Saber <br>That's Arturia Caster.</br></br>    <br>I want to lick her sword till the blade is gone.</br>  <br>Saber has zero training in thaumaturgy. She had massive potential for it, but didn't pursue it.</br>  <br>Arturia can't be Caster. Maybe she is a Lancer.</br>  <br>She is ideal for the majority demographic that plays eroge visual novels. Kohaku outside of 2D ruins your life.</br>  <br> 50 episodes <br>Wasn't UBW only 25 episodes?</br></br>  <br>I am not liking that Sakura doesn't look anything like herself and is casting Rin's magic.</br>  <br>Kohaku in dimension ruins lives.</br>  <br>It was actually 28.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_Fate/stay_night:_Unlimited_Blade<wbr>_Works_episodes<br><br>Seems to be 26. At any rate, a far cry from 50.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Lancelot is a very good teacher <br>And how did Lancelot learn how to please a man? Who was his teacher? Gawain? Key? The Lady of the Lake?</br></br>  <br>Emulating the superior sister</br>  <br>No its not.<br><br>From what I can read of the bottom right there was a poll or a competition or something to gauge what weird servant/master mashups people would like see and the top winners got art done of them.<br><br>It ain't a spinoff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she's also called Makiri. this setting is crazy, I want it.</br>  <br>26 episodes.<br>3 of them are double time<br>It's 29 episodes</br></br></br>  <br>She can be summoned as Caster, as she herself has said somewhere, but she does not recommend it because &gt;&gt;</br>  <br>The last weapon Saber ever used to kill someone was a Lance.</br>  <br>It's more of a what if type of scenario where you could summon Saber Arturia.<br><br>what have they done to the holy spear? I hope she doesn't break it or the world is fucked.</br></br></br>  <br> Seems to be 26 <br>Time wise it's 28, probably more if you count the extra footage from the BDs. 29 and 30 at most.</br></br>  <br>She left her spear rammed through Mordred's chest.<br><br>She can only be summoned as Saber while alive since Excalibur is the only weapon she has on hand.</br></br></br>  <br>see <br>0-25</br></br>  <br>Not the spear. Its a seperate weapon she also uses.</br>  <br>Nice team up. I'd like to see them in action.</br>  <br>I thought she told Bedivere to throw Excalibur back to the lake.</br>  <br>My bad, how much is the extra footage for the BDs? That could break 30 episodes time wise.</br>  <br> dat character lineup <br>I'm utterly disinterested.</br></br>  <br> She can only be summoned as Saber while alive since Excalibur is the only weapon she has on hand. <br> alive <br> 2004 <br> ALIVE <br><br>I know what you mean, but it made me laugh anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I guess that makes sense.<br><br><br>IIRC that's only after she returns from the Grail War.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No time got announced at the japanese site and the english one is wrong</br>  <br>No doubt.<br><br>Isn't Makiri just the Matou's before they renamed themselves or something? Maybe this is Sakura without worm rape but actual Makiri house training?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but that happens after she witness the 5th war.</br>  Is there a H-Scene with Ichigo in Kagetsu Tohya? I just met her.  <br> not wanting to see Mordred and Shirou in action <br><br>Shit would be cash as fuck.

Why do they all have face tumors?  Gintama thread.<br><br>Isn't the fact that they've made a new OP kind of worrying? Last time they went through so many OPs we only got around 50 episodes. Is it safe to assume we're getting 4 cours this time?

I couldn't make it past episode 36. It's legitimately horrible, I don't even know how I made it this far. Does it get any better? Good enough to even actually watch?</br></br>  <br>K</br>  <br>You need to actually have some brains to enjoy Full Metal Alchemist.Since apparently you don't have it,I suggest you go back to K-ON or Idolm@ster.</br>  when will you autistic fucks learn that people can like or prefer things you don't like without having 'shit taste'  <br>Hi newfag</br>  <br>This is true but if you just start complaining about how something is shit without giving a single explanation as to why, your taste is likely shit since you can't critique properly.</br></blockquote>]
