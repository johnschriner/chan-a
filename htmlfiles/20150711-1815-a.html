This is also affected by box size too.</br>  <br>The best part is the one that made it to the US already is going to be at least twice if not three times the size of the one that's still waiting.

It's coming late July isn't it</br>  <br>It was dust - wiped right off.</br>  has anyone bought the vividred operation 1/2.5 scale figure &amp; can you tell how much it cost to ship thanks xoxo  <br>Hilariously, the prize figure looks better.</br>  <br>Do you have an eye problem?</br>  <br>It honestly does.</br>  <br><br>He's right. You have to be completely and utterly deluded to think her 1/3 looks even close to decent. Fucking Griffon 1/3s look better.</br></br>  <br>The one on the right looks a lot better. Less fat on that pig and face/head looks a tad rounder and cuter.</br>  Does anyone know the release date for the 5th anniversary K-On Yui Figure? Also, why do they need a whole year between Azusa and Mugi to release?  <br>Are you talking about this one? She's at least 6,800 yen to ship.</br>    <br>What about the 1/3 looks better? Her skin has a sickly grey tinge to it, hair is oddly spiky/sharp, her bikini is too loose and has no detail (way too obvious she's a cast-off), and she was sculpted by someone who obviously has no clue how fat works.</br>    <br>Pochaco would look alot cuter if she wore more clothes.<br>Also  is right about her skin tone being awful.</br></br>  <br>Who dis?<br><br>Who dat?<br> Ribbed sweater fetish here I come. </br></br></br></br>  <br> has no clue how fat works. <br><br>Or gravity. Her breast don't look perfect, but they look like they weight and the bikini is helping them stay in place, but the ones on the 1/3 are like floating there saying fuck gravity.</br></br></br>  <br>oh is that all. my 1/8 figures cost that much to ship i was expecting like 200k lmao</br>  is it normal for there to be no changes in order status 24 hours after a purchase has been made? Released and not back ordered.  <br>*In the prize her breast don't look perfect..</br>  <br> Steam dress <br>Still, I agree that she's adorable with clothes on.</br></br>  Usually don't post pictures of boxes, but this is the first time Amico has forcibly split my order  <br>You should recognize the artists' style anon.<br><br>The first is Misaki Kurehito and the second is Kizuki Aruchu</br></br></br>  <br>Well. Wish more people would comment on shipping costs on MFC. After looking around a bit more, amiami would actually charge somewhere from 8,200-9600 yen to ship her.</br>    <br>I'd rather buy one box of good figures than 2 boxes of price figures.</br>  <br><br>If your plan was to look above him or smarter, you just failed miserably.</br></br>  <br> No games </br>  <br><br>I kind of want to get this fatty so I can dress her up but im not sure its worth 300+ dollars.</br></br>  <br>you have to admit the wo-class is pretty cool</br>  <br> price figures </br>  <br>And yet that one guy can't get AmiAmi to split his huge order into smaller ones.<br><br><br>She's really tempting, but I have no good space to display her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You could buy an equally appealing bag of horse shit for a fraction of the price.</br>  Yellow, fuck you. I want to buy your shit.  <br>I want one.</br>  <br>Why don't they put the figures in the crates?</br>  <br>nice tea table where to cop</br>  <br><br>Requesting butt pics.</br></br>  <br><br> I will pay $20 extra dollars just to have package 5-10 days earlier <br><br>SAL does not really take that long, or it depends on where you live. There's no point in using EMS unless you are rich.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I think she would look super cute in baby girl dresses.</br>  <br> 5-10 days earlier <br><br>I've waited 2+ months for SAL on several packages, and had 2 shipments lost. FUCK SAL</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but here you go. They ruined it, Jim.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127903330 <br>Fuck off. I hope you get banned for that shitpost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit that's adorable</br>  <br>Her breasts are sticking out of the arm sockets. No dress can adequately contain pork chops.</br>  <br>The difference to the United States between EMS and RSAL is only like 6-8 dollars. <br><br>I rather pay those extra 6 dollars to get a package in 3 days versus a possible 7-30 days.</br></br></br>  Everybody who is not a porkchop chaser has been driven away by the whaleposting.  <br>I there anyway to preorder this yet? It looks amazing but I can't find anything about it.</br>  <br>Anything in the Eight-Six crate or is just a storage box?</br>  <br> They ruined it <br>What exactly is the problem?</br></br>  <br><br>Alter changed the design of the dress to hide her butt, even though they got people excited initially by showing us a figure which you could see her cute butt. You know, like all of their borderline lewd figures.</br></br>  <br>Did you try reading?</br>  <br><br>They're folding crates, so nothing in them and they shipped in folded form. I'll probably use them to store detailing stuff.<br><br><br>Pretty sure it came from Levitz, but they're not around anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its 8 months between Smoogs and Slutcat.</br>  <br>This is so autistic it's cute</br>  <br>At 2kg it's around $15 difference. If you get a lot of packages it's worth it to use RSAL when possible.</br>  <br>She is still just an unpainted prototype. Usually you can't place a preparatory order until after an item has been painted. Follow skytube on twitter if you don't want to miss any updates.</br>  <br> They're folding crates <br>Oh. That makes a hell of a lot more sense than how I always imagined they were shipped.</br></br>  <br>11</br>  <br>They ship like this</br>  <br>Holy shit that is a whole new level of leg welding.</br>  <br>Autism at it's finest.</br>  <br>I wish I could find something like that locally for storing smaller figure boxes. All the containers I find have rounded edges or wheels so things don't fit nicely.</br>  <br> having expectations is now "autism" <br>The word has lost all meanign.</br></br>  <br>Good idea on the baby clothes m8.<br>Im going to start buying dresses at Goodwill, hopefully I don't get any weird stares.</br></br>  When?  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Fluffy</br>  <br>Getting upset about minor things on a figure that don't actually affect the overall quality or appearance of the figure is fucking retarded.<br><br>That picture bitching about Mikan's bathing suit and how far or not far it might come down to the top of her thigh is pure autism. Especially when you're taking pictures of different quality/lighting/angle.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been staring at my email inbox since the beginning of the month. Soon, hopefully.</br>  Pochaco in a see thru nightgown!<br>Why are see thru clothes so much lewder?</br>  Koto previewed Ougi  <br>After all this pork chop posting I think that I am starting to appreciate her body type. It is a shame about her face.</br>  <br>what the fuck is this for real? i thought she wasn't even a fucking vocaloid or whatever</br>  <br>Agreed. I'm sure Alter's has better production values but the sculpt itself is just not great.</br>  That is pretty big discount.  so he's fucking exclusive but my question is, can a sigle person buy 3 of them or just 1?<br><br>any information about him would be appreciated!</br></br>  <br> i thought she wasn't even a fucking vocaloid <br>How mean.</br></br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>327295</wbr></br>  <br>i was refering to kasane teto, not IA</br>  <br>holy shit, didn't know utau's were relevant at this point since miku is always getting a huge amount of merch almost every month<br>thanks btw</br></br>  <br> no one wants it that's why </br>  <br>It's 5 pieces of plastic that were popular at /m/ 3 years ago.</br>  <br>shit thats cute</br>  <br>teto was born on my birthday, if she gets a scale or a prize figure I kind of want her</br>  <br>Did you just draw that? That's cute, would buy.</br>  <br>Those sleeves look incredibly stupid.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>funny thing is this is probably the type of body my father likes</br>  <br>Fuck you faggot. they are cute.</br>  <br>Buy him one</br>  <br>They're oversized sleeves on a shirt that otherwise fits her perfectly. It looks ridiculous.</br>  <br>maybe after my mom dies</br>  <br>He has good taste in women I see.</br>  <br>They put it back on the front page of amiami 2 days ago so it'll probably be released soon</br>  <br>That's very cute, anon. Nice drawing. <br><br>I'd love to see some figures of Pochaco in cute clothing. Sonico has a few so there's hope.</br></br></br>  <br>even lily has a scale and she's no relevant so yeah maybe teto will get at least a prize just hope for wonfes to deliver</br>  <br>By that logic Alter's Kotori could be released by the end of the month too, since she's back on the front page as well.</br>  Ordered! Thank you for the help earlier anons.  <br>It's just the attachments, not the figure itself.<br>Get the fucking FMCS Deluxe set instead, it comes with the figure, all 40 attachments, and a display stand. I was dumb enough to get one for $80 when they came out, now they're on Manda for $20 plus shipping. And it's a fucking web exclusive, too.</br></br>  <br>Did you order from AmiAmi? How big would they make the box to ship this?</br>  <br> Pochaco will never wait for you to get home so she can help you relieve your pent up sexual frustration  <br>kind of hurts to live right now</br></br>  IT'S THAT TIME OF THE MONTH AGAIN! <br>This month's edition features Pluto! <br>(Also, New Horizon is going to fly by the real Pluto in a couple of days!)</br></br>  <br>The purple and green compliment eachother quite well. I am pleased.</br>    <br>I still do like these, but it would be better if they did the outer scout's henshin rods too.</br>  <br>How many more do you have to go?</br>  <br>The cover art is nice if you ignore the hands. But I may be biased because Pluto is one of the best scouts.</br>  <br>3 more!</br>  <br>I just want to take her from her position in the infinite nothingness that she's been made to protect and love her forever.  I want to hold her hand.  </br>  <br>like clockwork</br>  <br>I don't understand why they censored her butt. This is Japan we're talking about and Monogatari isn't for children.</br>    <br> best inner senshi's transformation rod <br> best outer senshi on the cover <br>Best set yet. But yeah, would've been nice if they'd done one charm for each character.<br><br><br><br>Looks really nice. If only they'd put that same effort into the show itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This concludes this month's edition! Look forward to next month! <br><br><br>I may be biased, but I prefer Usagi to Makoto. <br>Definitely, if only Toei wasn't a terrible company and cared about what they drew and animated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe a 1x1x1 box?<br><br>Do you think i have a few grand to blow on a real IIDX machine? I fucking wish.  This is the Desktop Arcade Collection</br></br></br>  <br>I like all of them, but Jupiter's like the sister I wish I had.<br><br>Are you getting the storage box for all the volumes too?</br></br></br>  Anyone have experience with adhesive sprays? <br>Thinking of using it to put my monogatari clear posters on a canvas backing. Kind of afraid they will either damage the poster if removed in the future, or would not dry cleanly and make the posters ugly. Scotch tapes didn't work.</br>  <br>frame them instead</br>  Anyone else considering this?  <br>I've been getting all the slips to be able to get it, but I'm not sure how I'll go about actually getting it since I won't be in Japan anymore. Plus it will only fit the BD case, so I'll have that box with the bds plus all the pizzabox style cases to go with.</br>  <br>NO</br>  <br>WHY NOT</br>  <br>That barely looks like Kaori. Shit figure/10</br>  <br>There's no frame of that size unfortunately. It's 12 mini clear posters that I am lining up, so framing them won't look as nice I think.</br>  <br>Unless I pay for a custom made frame, which is going to cost a fuckton.</br>  <br>Craft stores like Joanns and Micheals usually have 30-40% off custom framing order coupons. But it may still be expensive.</br>  I'm looking at buying a daki cover seperate from the pillow, just to make it cheaper, but the cover is 59.06"x19.69" while the pillow is 60"x20." From experience, has this ever proved to be a problem for anyone or am I overthinking this?  <br>With frames, I would probably need a white paper backing. Would these still look ok? The clear posters on the white canvas looked decent.</br>  <br>What about putting multiple posters in a single large/wide frame? Mounting clear posters with adhesive sounds like a bad idea.</br>  megahouse fucked up  <br>The blank space on the top and bottom bug me. I haven't gotten anything customed framed in years, but I'm sure if you brought in what you want framed (or just photos and a list of the dimensions) any place would give you an estimate. And picking a simple frame would keep the price lower.</br>  <br>I'd have to get a custom made one due to size. I checked out a few of my craft stores, and they did not have a stock one of that size. Might be super expensive. I'll check out that option if all else fails.</br>  When an artist names a pixiv page as 'C88web' as in 'C88webカタログ用', would that indicate that they're going to sell their works on web stores?  <br>You are doing good work anon</br>  <br>Really? I personally liked having that bit of room at the top and bottom.</br>  <br>It bugs me that there is space on the top and bottom, but the sides are really tight. But, in the end it's up to you. I just think that adhearing them to canvas could go wrong and damage the posters, framing them is safer.</br>  <br>Ok. I'll refrain from adhesive spray then. <br>I actually used a stronger double sided tape for now, and after pressing down on them with another canvas for an hour it seems to hold a bit better. I'll check tomorrow and see if it works. If not, custom frame time.</br></br>  <br>No. <br>Look for 通販. Check the doujin's pixiv page and the artist's website, since it doesn't look like he has twitter. <br>But it looks like all his works have had mail orders in the past, so this one probably will too. Follow the circle on Tora.</br></br></br>   4,800 JPY   <br>some could say gods work. that figure is glorious.</br>  <br><br>It's the anime tax. <br><br>Glad I ordered four.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;4 ,800 JPY<br> waiting this long to order her nendo <br>You can only blame yourself anon, I order mine fist day for 3680 JPY<br>Feels Goodman</br></br></br></br>  <br>18 is clearly best girl</br>  Question for Amerifriends, how much do you guys normally pay for this stuff? How much is too much for you? <br>I'm normally paying around $80 ausbux per purchase including shipping, and I always thought that was normal for this type of stuff. Replies in this thread are making me wonder though.</br>  <br><br>I forgot I hadn't ordered yet, and that it was already airing.<br><br>Went with HLJ because at least they actually charge retail. She's sold out most other places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>About the same.</br>  <br>I just payed for a 45k ami order.<br>Ended up being around 380 usd including shipping.

Thus America becomes a distopia police country where 90 percent of the lower class are incarerated into yet another legal slave labor while generations upon generations of the rich and powerful families never have to work again and have many human and non human slaves that cather to their every whim be it sexually or otherwise.</br>  <br>I bet you're a riot at parties</br>  What if the gate opens in the falklands?  <br>  Costa Rica <br>  Proceed to drink beer and party with the invaders </br></br>  <br> Thus America becomes a dystopia police country <br>I thought we already that</br></br>    i get drafted    <br>Not nearly as much as those-and I use this term loosly, "people" in power would like. They want to see all the poor in jail where they can put them in come kind of wacked out ever lasting debt they can only pay by working for the prison system as a 1 cent a day laborer and any food,water, bed or toilet is just another thing to add to the never ending debt that if they can't pay,they stay in prison for longer in a never ending cycle of enslavement. With a new society they outgun and out number it's a whole new market of people to exploit and nobody would stop them. That's the world those crazy fuckers want! We have to stop them but we won't because we're all brainwashed and apathic to the world around us.

Its been that way since the start of our country. The only thing that might change is we might not declare war, but we will be fighting one.</br></br>  <br>Why is America so evil?</br>  <br>Het comrade<br>I teach you to fight<br>All you need is vodka, mosin, and spam can<br>Bayonet screwdriver help to for opening can and imperials<br>If mosin too sticky simply poor your extra vodka into receiver and bolt<br>you are now ready to liberate</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm crashing this gate with no survivors!</br>  <br>You had your chance, Yuropoors<br>Now it's our turn</br></br>  <br> Implying the companies in America don't just strong arm the government into using the private prison system as personal slave labor to keep the populace fat, happy and still believing they live in the best goddamn country on this motherfuckin planet. For fucks sake, Corporations own everything, you think they wouldn't produce a scumbag way to bring in more money without paying anything? </br>  <br>We're not evil<br>The rest of the world is just tsundere for us<br>We're like the dull harem mc who tries to be good but often ends up fucking shit up while the mean girls plot against us and our friends call us baka cause they secretly want us to tenderly love them</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mayor's death squads upgraded to spec ops?</br></br>  <br>Why does she wear the mask</br>  <br>Because we take no chances and love to fuck shit up when need be.</br>  <br> We'll probably hold them off <br>No, silly. Our shitty government is going to negotiate with the Romans until the US decides to intervene.<br><br>Also squatters move into the Gate and build their houses there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prison population is already being put to work at 1/100th of regular wage. Making helmets/state license plates/low end military clothing/etc</br>  <br>That didn't have to be all one big green text<br>But I agree we do need prison reform because some of the shit they pull with that is bullshit</br></br>  <br>That's not how it works, most Americans aren't going to want to do the type of labor that Hispanics do currently, they thinks it's beneath them because the grew up with everyone telling them that low-skill labor is a dirty word, and especially not for the price they work for. With out Hispanic labor most of the countries agricultural industry would die as you would not be able to fill their place quickly enough and the increased cost would bankrupt many businesses.</br>  <br>Come to think of it, I'd rather be watching Ray and Brad bitching at each other.</br>  people will cry about 'those poor weakling barbarians' and demend soldiers to be put on trials for war crimes<br><br>BTW<br><br>can anyone,<br>who has red the manga,<br>tell me if this will happen at any point in the future of the story?<br><br>i seriously need to know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>70% of Canada is completely uninhabited. Chances are greater that the gate would open onto muskeg or boreal forest than a city. <br>In the winter they'd freeze to death, and end up in the bellies of wolves, coyotes and ravens, or in a wolverines cache.<br>If it was summer they'd be eaten by leeches, blackflies and the world's most aggressive mosquitoes.<br>Either way they'd be hundreds of miles from anything, and no one would know they ever came.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The notRomans killed first and asked questions never. There was no time to negotiate.<br><br>Squatters would probably loot the armors and swords and sell them for scrap metal</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most American CAN'T do the type of labor that Hispanic do currently. Any kind of movement is that much harder when you weight 300 pounds.</br>  <br>Actually I believe the gap would be filled by a younger work force of high school kids<br>However you are correct in that still not being enough<br>To not rely on illegal immigrant labor there needs to be a lot more emphasis in that college is not for everyone<br>Trade schools are great, not everyone is meant for an office job or just being an art major since they don't know what to do with their lives<br>If that message got out the work force would be much more American</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chattanooga <br><br>The yuppies would be slaughtered. <br><br>Georgia would be fine.<br>101st would be the first to fuck shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats because most hispanics/illegal immigrants work far below their pay grade. <br><br>I guarantee you loads of unemployed will work if the wage for cleaning toilets/lawnmowing/doing dishes is raised to $20/h.<br><br>Most immigrants and low enders, work these jobs currently at ~$7/h. No one is going to work at that price.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then they would say "YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH MURDERERS,CHILD MOLESTERS AND RAPIST" and that would be the end of that conversation as the lynch mob grinds you to dust. It's just like criticizing America's foreign relations and getting shouted down with "USA USA USA FUCK ALL THESE FUCKING FOREIGNERS AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOU CAN GEEET OUT." Donald Trump is the face of modern America.</br>  <br>heh<br>too bad America lost to Mexico for most obese country<br>We still have the super bowl though</br></br></br>  To be frank, if the fantasy world steals gun tech, it is fucking over for most 3rd world nations.

In terms of raw numbers, they attack more people than bears and wolves combined, but usually with only minor consequences. In the Americas, moose injure more people than any other wild mammal and, worldwide, only hippopotamuses injure more. </br>  <br> rural Pennsylvania <br>we'd just tell them to get the fuck out with the rest of the tourists, but still encourage them to spend money at the resorts and casinos.</br></br>  Heaven's Gate or Hell's Gate?

Most attacks I've heard of are people who did not listen.<br><br>Same deal with bears: playing dead works. If you shoot the bear instead because you are such a big man, you'd better fucking kill the bear on the first shot, because it's him or you now. Moose die easier, but same principle.<br><br>Keep your distance and don't be an ass and you're fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope he was just joking around and wasn't actually being mean to the kid.</br>  <br>There are several videos of Americans harassing mooses til they get mad and charge them.

The special forces from the three countries are all defeated handily, and it's a big embarrassment for the three world powers.<br><br>US goes back to submissively providing Japan with money and equipment, on the hopes of one day being allowed access to the other world's resources.</br></br></br>  Wow kids, look at how much fun war is! Notice the might and power of the JSDF! Don't you realize now how stupid article 9 is? Let's just get rid of that pesky thing.  <br>Two nukes weren't enough.</br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing.</br>  <br>If you go to nip boards you will see this show have opposite effect of that.</br>  <br>The original plan called for over 20 had Japan not surrendered</br>  <br>USA USA USA USA!</br>  <br>The best part is that no nukes were necessary as the threat of the imminent red army invasion was far scarier than anything the allies possessed.</br>  The best thing about this anime is watching it with /a/. Just like every other shit anime. KLK and A/Z were shit, but /a/ made them fun.  I remember reading comments from the real JSDF serviceman criticizing how the author portrayed the JSDF in a "bad" way.<br><br>From wiping our thousands of soldiers to pathetic otaku protagonist, they just hated author's ideas.</br></br>  <br>I remember bullshit</br>  <br>It's confirmed hoax.</br>  <br>lol even feudal samurai lords knew it was better to attack with outrageous advantages.</br>  <br> The special forces from the three countries are all defeated handily <br> defeated handily </br></br>  <br>The enemy has fucking dragons.

Examples please?[/spoiler]</br>  <br>Oops. I spoilered wrong</br>    <br>Nice spoiler.<br>Have you read the manga? the scene where Kurumi finds the gun and talks to Miki about the use of guns in zombie movies.</br></br>  <br>Just use ctrl-s</br>  <br> youngest girl on the oldest character. </br>  <br>The gun scene, chopper crashing scene etc...</br>  <br> Generic horror twist and sad piano music <br>Really intriguing.</br></br>  <br><br><br>She also went off during the trip to the university by herself in the middle of all the zombies.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Did they actually mention zombie movies?</br>  <br>Wasn't that just zombie hunting to test her wesker powers?</br>  <br>Character model mods when?</br>  <br> that ending <br>I went in blind anon... I DIDN'T KNOW!</br></br>  <br>Yep. kurumi was saying how in zombie movies guns are useless and that they usually only have one use.</br>  <br><br> muh generic <br>Why can't you faggots enjoy something for what it is for once?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;sensei killed Kurumi<br> sensei killed the dog <br> Miki killed sensei out of jealousy <br> sensei's lack of responsibility led to Rii losing her grip <br> Yuki recovered after the fire and is now pretending for everybody else's sake <br> everything is sensei's fault </br></br></br></br></br> <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br>Yes and how useless are guns against zombies.</br>  <br>at one point there was even a walking dead poster.</br>  <br><br>Then if zombie media was a thing in the GG universe, how come the military didn't immediately wipe the floor with them?</br></br>  <br>Read the manga. I actually found myself smiling more often than frowning.  Though I was crying the whole time. </br>  <br>Yeah. I read that part. I inferred it was going to be used against zombies</br>   next ep preview is more SOL <br>Are they just gonna keep transitioning to grimdark within the last few minutes or will there actually be a focus on reality eventually?</br>  <br>We don't know. The manga is quite different, and the anime already fucked it up by adding Mi-kun right off the bat.</br>  <br> how come the military didn't immediately wipe the floor with them? <br>First of all this is Japan, dense population with low crime rates and minimally armed police force. The SDF has guns but they're not very many and obviously they can't adequately contain a plague when it's presumably popping up all over the country.<br><br>Speaking of which (I'm assuming you haven't read the manga), vaccines are a thing and  they work . So maybe they didn't kill the completely turned zeds until it was too late because there's that misguided hope of "curing" them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll become more and more real as it goes on. Next episode should have  the first zombie kill(s)  for instance.<br><br>Do you think we'll get the library chapter next episode?</br></br></br>  <br>A good portion of the entire manga is actually SoL, even if it doesn't only focus on the delusions of the one character. The anime has fucked around with everything pretty badly already though, so there's no telling which direction it'll take.<br><br>Hopefully as the show progresses the vividness of the delusions will gradually deteriorate each episode until all that is left is Yuki talking to empty space while everybody looks at her worried.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. I just assumed that they were going to use it to kill zombies</br>  <br>If you've read the chapter, you'd know that the (non anime original) scenes are still there. Yuki still acts like it's a moe SoL, so it makes sense for her to do a cutesy next episode preview. As the series progresses and gets more and more suffering, the cutesy stuff will provide more emphasis through juxtaposition. It's like watching the first episode knowing it's all fake and being on edge the whole time.<br><br><br>I've read it, I'm just bad at remembering specific details.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi going to the barricades with her shovel <br> Taroumaru wearing the ghost thingy <br><br>We're getting chapters 2 and 3 next week. People raving about how we're going completely off course are wrong.</br></br></br></br>  I've been reading the manga and the latest development worries me.<br><br> Where the fuck did the imouto come from? Rii is obviously losing her shit to critical levels (in the genuine bad way, not the good Yuki way) so I highly doubt her stability. Also, am I supposed to believe that a loli imouto was able to survive in a zombie infested school safely? Everything is too fucking convenient and happy that I think something is definitely fucking wrong here <br><br><br>They could still do the entry of Mii-kun into the party via flashbacks.<br><br>The reveal about the truth behind Megu-nee can easily be integrated with the introduction of Mii-kun into the club through one of the members reminiscing or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So yeah. Whatever animesalestard keep saying about the preorders of the anime version, the main fact is here:<br><br>7/10 漫画ランキング コミック売上BEST500【ワンピース78】<br>91 9784832242364 がっこうぐらし！　１ 芳文社 海法紀光 2012.12.12<br>116 9784832243095 がっこうぐらし！　２ 芳文社 海法紀光 2013.6.12<br>190 9784832243781 がっこうぐらし！　３ 芳文社 海法紀光 2013.12.12<br>217 9784832244627 がっこうぐらし！　４ 芳文社 海法紀光 2014.7.11<br>227 9784832245389 がっこうぐらし！　５ 芳文社 海法紀光 2015.3.12</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tis but a ruse</br>  <br> It's the teddy bear. </br>  <br>The chopper scene was just her giving up because there were too many</br>  <br>   Where the fuck did the imouto come from?<br/> <br>   Rii is obviously losing her shit to critical levels (in the genuine bad way <br>This question answers itself and I'm sure you've realized that  it's not a real loli. </br></br></br>  <br>Just like I thought, the dog doesn't real.<br><br><br>So what does this mean qualitatively?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest they probably just started out with Mi-kun already there to be able to skip over her arc and get to the more grimdark stuff more expediently, considering the limited timeframe of a single cour. It's understandable, but it doesn't really sit right with me, since her introductory arc is a major aspect of her character. We'll see how the studio handles it.</br>  <br>Sorry chef</br>  <br>accidentally hovered over a read some :(</br>  <br>And considering that 芳文社 is a part of the production committee - and quite an important part.</br>  <br>Then go and read the manga.</br>  Just got past mikun back story it's obvious hat the dude got bit but who set him on fire and why did they block out everyone else?  <br> :( <br>O:</br></br>  <br>The real question is why you haven't already read the manga. This series, by its very nature, is really damn easy to spoil You should probably avoid these threads if you don't want that.</br>  <br><br><br> So she joins the Cray-Cray delusion club? Fuck man, only Yuki can pull that kind of shit off. Rii just looks and sounds loco if she's the one doing it. </br></br></br>  <br>That means that the next day after the first episode people have started purchasing all volumes of the manga and I'm more than sure that it will manage to sell 10x amount of it's previous sales in a week or two.</br>  So the manga won't hiatus after the anime right?<br><br>Because God Damn, I don't know how long HotD has been stuck on the Bangbus</br></br>  Imouto is Beary cute  <br>What's their track record for S2s? I know Kadokawa is a pack of Jews that never gives S2s.</br>  Why won't you love me?  <br>I'm assuming that's a list of the top 500 best-selling manga in Japan and the anime has brought up sales for volumes 1-5.<br><br><br>   Rii just looks and sounds loco if she's the one doing it. <br>That's the idea anon, up till now she was the stable mother of the group but being the oldest isn't always a good thing. It's a wonder that a girl her age lasted this far without cracking completely.<br><br><br> HOTD <br>It's deader than Abraham Lincoln and only "on hiatus" in name. The author is genuinely retarded and he's clearly never going back to it, even if the artist wants to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look a little closer.</br>  <br>Means that manga sales are also very important for the success of the anime/Gakkou Gurashi! as a whole.<br><br>Here are the chief producers of the anime version:<br>Ogura Mitsutoshi (NBC) - anime sales?<br>Kobayashi Hiroyuki (Houbunsha) - manga sales<br>Digitarou (Nitroplus) - dunno</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just her confirming a suspicion. <br>She interacted with  the radio gal  offpanel, and that was when she realized that she's half-invisible to the zombies.</br></br>  <br>My sister has a mustache also, that's not proof of anything.</br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't mind if the serum made them half zombie with super instincts and crap.<br>Its be amusing in a way.</br></br>  <br> That's the idea anon, up till now she was the stable mother of the group but being the oldest isn't always a good thing. It's a wonder that a girl her age lasted this far without cracking completely. <br>Aren't all three of them in the same class? I might have missed it, but I don't think it's ever specified how old Mother Bear is. I just assumed she was as old as the dead one and the acid freak.</br></br>  <br>She's wearing the same clothes she had on during Rii's flashback. What about it?</br>  <br> if the serum made them half zombie with super instincts and crap <br>World War Z sequel when?<br><br><br>I don't quite remember if they were in the same class (not watching the show) but even if they're all the same age, Rii was the most mature and level-headed of the lot</br></br></br></br></br>  What's the exact point where she broke?  <br>Shit, you're right. What if  the author is trying to fool us into thinking she's the bear, but we only realize she's the real imouto when  she dies.  </br>  <br>I want to know how she killed all the zombies in the room.</br>  <br> I still blame Yuki. I realize that she's supposed to be the healer of the group, but goddamn she is the one actively perpetuating the mass delusion. When Rii came out and introduced her Not!Imouto, Mii and Kurumi just stared at her with a "What the fuck is this nigga talking about" expression. Only when Yuki acknowledged Not!Imouto as THE imouto that all of them started playing along. Fucking hell, she was the one who planted that bear in the first place </br>  <br> World War Z <br>Thinking back, GKG is more like that book than that failure of an adaptation was.</br></br>  <br>On the roof top when she flipped at yuki during the heli crash.<br><br><br>Well considering they don't even feed her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet they laid out a plate/bowl thing and spoon for her?</br>  <br> Yuki made it through her shit, so she's decided that letting Rii's delusion play out is better than ripping it apart. </br>  <br> Not!Imouto <br> ! </br></br>  <br>To keep up pretenses I suppose.<br> what do Mii? <br> l-let's play along for now <br> I never played House though </br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you look at her bowl? it had nothing in it while everyone else did.</br>  <br>She didn't, chances are she pulled a Yuki and just grabbed the bear then stood in the room a while, interacted for a bit with what wasn't there then left.</br>  <br>I don't think so, the other characters act too weird around them for that.<br><br>Also pic related from 36,  you can clearly see the bear there. I can't make up if that's Yuki or Miki though </br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  <br>what the fuck is going on here</br>   just found out a facebook page I've had liked for about a year is owned by Doc <br>epic, simply epic</br>  <br>I dunno but I think the same artist drew this.</br>  <br>Shittiest page name tho, I'm pretty sure he said he's waiting on it to be changed.</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro's clothes just get gaudier and gaudier as time goes on. and that is some serious black magic to bake a star-shaped cake</br>  <br>what's the name?</br>  <br>They're worshiping a magical starfish.</br>  <br> Awesome, another fucking pointless meme page. </br>  <br><br>I see it as paying respect for a dead starfish being cremated</br></br>  <br><br> facebook dot com slash AAFPMP </br></br>  DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE ANIME RELEASE WHEN!?!

This decent fansub group is still alive. Downloading.</br></br>  <br>Why would I wait an extra week for these subs?</br>  I was amazed Inami didn't lay a finger on anyone last episode  <br>Reminder that Yamada a literal shit.</br>    <br>You shut your filthy fucking whore mouth</br>  <br> Yamada still a shit </br>  <br>Character development.</br>  <br>I want to rub Inami's head. But she'd just punch me.  She's also not real.  </br>  I want an episode where Inami accidentally punches and kills a male baby then gets arrested.  I missed the old fansub groups in our time. SS-Eclipse, Ayako, m.3.3w, Mazui, Shinsen, etc.  <br>I thought /a/ didn't like eclipse.</br>  <br>Dunno about that, they're just pretty slow as fuck.</br>  <br>I miss Mazui.</br>  <br>What about Your Mom? That was the meme cartel of those times.</br>  Remember when Popura was the main girl in this show?  <br>it getting better since Yamada appear</br>  <br>No, not really.</br>  <br>no</br>    <br><br>She should hurry up and get written out of the show</br></br>  lets talk about Dragon Ball Super and how its going to be "Goku Tales" costarring Beerus, Whis and Vegeta.  <br><br>how come goten and trunks are younger than buu saga now.</br></br>  <br>They're not</br>  <br><br> yamcha <br><br>he doesn't even deserve to be in the OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>They look younger,</br>  <br>He doesn't deserve to be in the series at all. It would have been a more merciful fate for him</br>  <br>When is the new movie coming out again are translations done yet?</br>   everyone except Goku is canon fodder   <br>Come on. The first episode had more Goten and Trunks than Goku. It'll be a great series.</br>  <br><br>Why are they such the best characters?</br></br>  Where can I go about watching these episodes?  were the fuck is yajirobe?  Isn't Krillin like, way shorter?<br><br>Fucking love Yajirobe, he should have stayed with the Z fighters throughout dbz, but it became too srsbznz</br></br>  <br>McDonald's.</br>  <br>Its sad there was a point where he was stronger then krillin, who is now the strongest human alive.</br>  <br>Nyaa</br>  <br> <br>The same place he's been since the end of Dragonball:<br><br>Scarfing down unreasonable amounts of Senzu at Karin's Tower so that the main cast can't break the plot with an unlimited supply.</br></br></br></br>  Remember, it's confirmed 18 says two words in episode 20<br><br>GET HYPED</br></br>  <br>Such is dragon ball</br>  just me or they should have used Ushio to Tora's song for DB Super's opening? the song feels pretty flat compared the the old ones, they should have gone for more action.<br>thoughts?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jt8<wbr>W_FA3QBE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Pathetic lurker that is interested enough to ask only because it's DBZ <br><br>Why</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Nah, the current one is fine.<br><br>Remember, dragon ball is a kids show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK THAT, DBZ had kick ass opening, not this hunter x hunter bullshit opening with rainbows and shit.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sfK<wbr>i8PCSL5k</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Have you actually heard the lyrics for this song? It's hardly 'kick ass'</br></br></br></br>  <br>pal that's a kick ass OP.<br><br>just like the one from db fusion the movie, by far my favorite opening from db</br></br></br>  <br><br>Super's OP and that one are in a similar vein of shonen butt rock.</br></br>  <br> FUCK THAT, DBZ had kick ass opening, not this hunter x hunter bullshit opening with rainbows and shit. <br><br>This sentence should have clued you into the fact that you're talking to a highschooler</br></br></br>  <br>not really, cha la head cha la clearly has an 80s vibe. I get the whole "it's a children show" but this song is simply not a good song and in no way remarkable, like the old ones, they should have added a bit more action into the song.<br><br>because HxH's opening is so good, and dragon ball super opening is so good</br></br></br>  <br>bitch, i dropped out i dont need that supid shit.</br>  <br>Videl a cute<br>Chichi a short</br></br>  <br>DBZ's eternal fans, everybody.</br>  how do you go from this<br><br>to this  ?</br></br>  <br>Digital animation</br>  <br>Aren't you people insulted by the fact that pic contains people that you won't even fucking see during the show?</br>  <br><br><br>You're being delusional if you think the same amount of love and care is being put into Dragon Ball Super as there was put into Z</br></br></br>    <br> muh edgy kids show </br>  <br>18 is getting a line, be fucking grateful</br>  <br><br>The show matured, that's what happened.</br></br>  <br> love and care <br>Of all the Super hate, this is the most ridiculous. They are both just shows to make money. At least Toriyama gets to do what he wants this time. Also, the animation looks much better in Super than Z.</br></br>  <br> that get </br>  <br><br> Also, the animation looks much better in Super than Z. <br><br>No, no it doesn't.<br><br>Stop spreading blatant lies.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>matured into kindergarden</br>  <br><br>"Departure" is fucking great, you shut your whore mouth.</br></br>  <br><br>YOU</br></br>  <br><br>Only kids are worried about looking mature like in DBZ's opening. Grown ups knows that they can feel good by accepting what they are</br></br>  <br><br> can't </br></br>  <br>He totally is. Just compare everyone from OPs pic to this one.</br>  <br>are they hanging out in instrumentality?</br>  <br>Toriyama is so rich by now he's clearly doing this out of love for his universe, not simply for money.</br>  <br>How can you tell? 99% of anime characters look 12 from the neck up.</br>  <br>I'm not the only one that loved the first episode am I?<br>Maybe I'm just happy DB is back, never thought I'd see the day.</br></br>  <br>its just the first episode...Its goten and trunks getting water for videl. the buu/satan scene was the best part of the episode.<br><br>personally most peopl are overrating the first episode. if you didn't know the characters in DBZ you'd be lost. of course who hasn't seen DBZ and who doesn't know the characters but still. GT at least introduced the character slightly better than Supers first episode.</br></br></br>  <br><br> if you didn't know the characters in DBZ you'd be lost. <br><br>That's not a legitimate criticism. It's a direct sequel and Super should only be watched after DB and DBZ. <br><br>Of course I can see how that concept is lost on the fanbase of this series since DB aired after DBZ in some parts of the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Toriyama's style of 14 and under = 2 feet.</br>  <br><br>There's no such thing as being too rich. It is in mankind's nature to always want more</br></br>  <br>Z was a direct sequel and they gave the time to explain everyone. GT was a direct sequel and they explained everyone. Super didn't. and no it was a "criticism"</br>  <br>We haven't gotten to the first episode of Super yet. I don't count last week as an episode. It's like a promo or something. Nothing happened. Goku having a job didn't even go anywhere. It was an episode that ended exactly where it began. We didn't get ANY forward momentum until the last few minutes, and that was setup for a retelling of a movie we've already seen.</br>  I liked how Goku had to ask how much it was in thousands to understand how much money it was.<br>It was a nice touch.</br>  <br>If you could kill one of those characters to improve the story who would be? and why?</br>  <br><br>All the saiyans if possible, but if i'm limited to only one, perma-kill Goku.</br></br>  <br>All things considered, probably Bulma. It'd cost them a valued scientist, and more importantly cause strife for Trunks and Vegeta.</br>  <br>Krilin, it always works.</br>  How many episodes do you think the movie arcs will take up? 5? 10? 20? 60?  <br>Bulma - I want Vegeta stronger than Goku and actually keep it that way for once.</br>  <br>i'd say 20 tops. for both. 10 for bog 10 for rof</br>  where can i watch resurrection f  <br>just noticed trunks eyes are on vegeta</br>  <br>muh grain</br>  <br> Yamcha <br>This series is too cruel to the humans, mean holy shit, the dues have been with goku for what? 30 years? Fuck it all</br></br>  So Universe 6 rivalry will end up having a Universe vs Universe "martial arts" tournament right?  <br>it comes out august 5</br>      <br>my bad it's actually august 4</br>  Goku should just abandon everyone but Vegeta and start a new Z Fighters with people on his level.  <br>That all kills of Yamcha thing is the only reason not to shit on the faggot who browsed DA for this shit</br>  <br>None, just sideline Goku, Vegeta, etc. and focus in the new generation characters like Uub, Trunks, Goten, Pan, etc.</br>  <br><br>Japanese fans would probably throw a bitchfit if Vegeta and Goku weren't the main characters. Many older fans wouldn't bother with the series either, because they grew up with those characters. Goku and Vegeta also sell shit in Japan so it wouldn't be a good move financially.</br></br>  <br><br> we will never have The Krillin Show </br></br>  I never thought there could be a bigger bitch than Kirino...  Umaru reminds me of a shithead Yukkuri.  Interesting.  <br>Isn't she openly a chibi with Kirie?</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Sugoiiiii she is smart, good at sports and beautiful.But she has this irrelevant flaw. The other people praise her about everything and she is better at everything than everbody. This again?</br>  Why did it have to end like that? I just finished re-watching this anime, and it could've been one of my favorite, if only they ended it the way the author wanted it to end. <br><br>Fuck it, I'm so pissed</br></br>  <br>Wrong board.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>And then?</br>  <br>Lots of unprotected sex probably</br>  <br>Why you are such a fag, I watched Seikon no Qwaser with my mom behind me, i'm sure you can finish Oreimo just fine.</br>  ITT: Anime quotes you live by<br><br> Even if I am to carry all the evils of this world, it won't matter.
