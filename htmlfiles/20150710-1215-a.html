[ Shovels aren't artillery you dumb bitch.  First for Kumamoutos  Mii-kun best girl.  Did we really need a new thread after the shitfest that the previous was?  <br>That sounds like a wrong translation.<br>She probably said something like "was one of the most effective weapons", referring to the fact that the cover provided by the trenches was of vital importance.</br></br>  <br>Maybe this one will be better.</br>  Dropped it halfway through Non Non biyori is the superior SoL  <br>Do you think we can ever again have threads that aren't shitfests?</br>  I wonder what she is thinkgen about when she's cleaning that shovel that has tasted so much blood. Just like a shell-shocked vet on Iwo Jima is cleaning his bayonet from the blood and guts of slain enemies.<br><br>She's completely emotionless here.<br><br>I think Kurumi is the most broken one. Just like a combat veteran with a 1000 mile stare.<br><br>Kurumi has seen some shit to be able to remain so calm.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mii-kun since the first episode <br> The dog is still alive <br>Damn they fucked</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we just have to wait eleven weeks.</br>  <br> She can't forget the moment she killed her boyfriend because he was turning into a zombie. She used the shovel at that moment </br>     Next month for new translations <br> Can't find the raws even while looking on a bunch of Korean websites <br><br>God damn it</br></br></br>  <br>But anon,  she is already dead .</br>  <br>it's always the same<br>remember the pre-anime shingeki threads?</br></br>  <br>You heard her.</br>  Is this yuri?  <br>yes</br>  <br>You're truly delusional, aren't you?</br>  So are they going to change the OP in next episode?  <br>Like night and day. Fuck anime.</br>  <br>I'd show her some real artillery<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>yeah im talking about my dick</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because  even the manga is shit  but I understand your pain</br>  <br>It's not bad to hope, anon.</br>  <br>Picked up. I hope to see some hardcore handholding though.</br>  <br>How is that bad at all? Now best girl will have more screen time.</br>  <br><br>We constant general now.<br>Threads are about to become Yahari tier over the next few days.</br></br></br>  <br>imagine an objectively great manga like Dorohedoro would get this treatment<br>i wouldn't be able to handle it</br></br>   My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works <br>Wow, fucking really ufotable?</br>  That was in the VN too, now stop making obvious troll threads.  <br>You've only watched the DEEN anime and Fate/Zero, right?</br>          <br>We need one of those for Shirou's UBW.</br>    <br> Now you've done it! You've become a Puella Magi, Madoka Magica! <br>Dropped instantly, I can't believe people call this a masterpiece.</br></br>  <br>I like this one.</br>  Is there an Angry Manjew evilness mental breakdown bait?   /v/tards bringing in their shitty may mays   My whole life was Unlimited Rin Works  <br>I thought this is /tv/ meme?</br>  <br> not seven proxies </br>   My whole life was overrated shit with a circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>It is. Everyone steals from /tv/.</br>  "My name is Charlotte"<br><br>Bravo PA Works</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit OP</br>  <br> circle-jerking fanbase  <br>Hilarious coming from a puppet repeating maymays in order to try and fit in, go and kill thyself you dumb loser.</br></br>  <br>That's shit. Here, have a better one.</br>  <br>That IS for Shirou.</br>  <br>No, this is Archer's chant.</br>  <br>I am the bone of my bait <br>Bait is my body and bait is my blood <br>I have created over a thousand baits<br>Unaware of mods, nor aware of discussion<br>Withstood pain to create baits, waiting for OP to deliver <br>I have no regrets. This is the only path<br>My whole life was Unlimited Bait Works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet the image is of Shirou. Maybe that's the bait.</br>     So you won't talk huh? Looks like I'll have to Kill la Kill you! <br><br>Seriously trigger?</br></br>  Someone should do fall semester mike to read "did you mean bait?"    <br>That line wasn't in UFO's adaptation.</br>  <br>I am the Bane of Gotham.<br>Darkness is my body and fire is my blood. <br>I have crashed over a thousand planes, <br>Unknown to CIA, nor known to Batman. <br>Have withstood pain to take many masks off <br>Yet, this crash will never have any survivors.<br>So, as I pray, unlimited Bane works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     My whole life was the infinte creation of swords. <br>I'M GONNA KILL YOU CRUNCHYROLL</br>  <br>Yes it was, Crunchymongrel.</br>  <br>I guess that True Assassin&amp;Berserker are the only ones without their own b8image.</br>  <br>It wasn't. He explicitly refers to his body being made of infinite swords in that scene.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a crazy sociopath in this image?</br>  My whole life was /a/   We finally did it Asuka... We finally reached the end... of Evangelion <br>I can't believe I sat through 26 episodes of this shit</br>  <br>Not to mention<br> I've got to find out who Kill La Killed my dad </br></br>    <br/>  <br>Nice work OP, all those great fate related bait pictures.<br><br>Bait Stay Out</br></br></br>  <br>At first I felt bad for making such a shitty thread, but it's summer and I thought "why the fuck not?". I definitely don't regret it.</br>  <br>The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime. The most literal translation for this is "infinite creation of swords", but the official romanization is "Unlimited Blade Works" (アンリミテッドブレイドワークス).<br>More over, some of the promo material literally quotes "...I have no regrets. This is the only path/ My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works"<br><br>Seriously, fuck off Crunchymongrel secondary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex typically puts out a crude sub script for the initial broadcast and then revise it after the fact. Also, a more professional script is usually used for the BD release.</br>  <br>Why does he look so innocent and not like a  fancy gentleman  in this image?</br>  <br>“Their lines may cut, but the fish still see my bait! These men are my fishing buddies – my loyal fishermen! They’re my true friends - breaking the rules of 4chan and /a/ to fish once more at my side!”<br><br>“They are my worms on hooks; they’re my right to bait! They make up Anon's most triggering bait – Ionian Baitroi!!”</br></br></br>  <br>12 baiters and tsubame kouji</br>    <br>wait, fake assassin has one?</br>  I need Bait of Honer.<br> everything you touch turns to bait </br>  <br> The term "無限の剣製" is used in both the VN and the anime <br>That's not the line he uses. The anime and VN use この体は、無限の剣で出来ていた which doesn't translate to "my whole life was unlimited blade works." It's no wonder the FSN translation gets shat on so much. Crunchy roll did people a favor using a more proper translation as opposed to using the garbage Takajun shat out.</br></br>  <br>Not 100% sure but I remember seeing one with him.</br>    <br>RIN A BEST!</br>  <br>But which Rin is the bestest?<br><br> HF Rin &gt; Fate Rin &gt; UBW Rin </br></br></br>  <br>Broest of bros.</br>  <br> Crunchy roll did people a favor using a more proper translation as opposed to using the garbage KINOKI NASU shat out. </br>  Bazett needs one of these images. <br> Answerer: That Which Posts Later Baits First  <br>Is just too perfect.</br></br>  <br>All Rins are best.</br>  <br>Nobody actually wants anything to do with /tv/. <br>/tv/ is literally a shitpost memeboard who have nothing else better to do but spam their memes on other boards for the sake of getting it out there with examples being Brendan Fraser,Baneposting, and this thread</br></br>    <br>I hope to see it one of these days</br>  <br> All Fate girls a best. <br> I still need to read Tsuki since lods of those girls look good too. </br></br>  <br>Hisui is best meido and best Tsuki.</br>  <br> literally a shitpost memeboard <br><br>You mean like /a/ before it chopped its own balls off?</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/FB7QS8v9EEo  [ ]<br><br> Implying this song doesn't bring tears to you're eyes </br></br>   I guess this was the choice of Steins;Gate <br>wait</br>  Why does the Fate/stay night fanbase hate Unlimited Blade Works, again?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LIl<wbr>eIBSm_zc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>fuck you  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Vocal minority as always.</br>  <br> Why do the most autistic Fate fans on MAL hate UBW again <br>You mean this right?</br></br>  <br> song <br>If it had lyrics :^)</br></br>    <br>I know I don't.</br>  <br>They mostly don't, but there's the VERY vocal minority. Also<br> Assuming that a vocal minority on fucking 4chan actually means anything in the grand scheme of things. </br></br>    <br>They ruined Shirou's rich progression as a character. Unforgivable, ufotable.</br>  <br>they used that song for too many non emotional moments to make it have any real impact by itself.</br>  <br> We truly entered from the GATE <br><br>DROPPED<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These supposedly sad piano heavy tracks don't really do anything to me.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You're misinformed. Ask any VN reader and they'll tell you how Ufotable ruined Shirou and Caster's characters. The director is also an amateur who ruined both UBW and KnK6 (abysmal compared to their source materials) http://myanimelist.net/people/12167<wbr>/Miura_Takahiro</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read the VN. You're talking about the people on MAL lead by the cookingpriest. /a/, beastlair, and even reddit VN readers mostly enjoyed the anime with many having parts that they thought were much better than the anime.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>We need<br><br>Baitaniya<br>Subaitme gaeshi<br>All the bait in this world<br>Ionioi Baitoroi<br>Bait of Honor</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VN reader here. I can confirm that Ufotable ruined  nothing. THIS IS BAIT ___________________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>________</wbr></wbr> </br>   Miia?  <br> No Darling, I have become the Monster Musume no iru nichijou. <br><br>Fuck you Okayado that was terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is being a VN reader so well regarded in this fanbase, again? Do we get a medal or something?</br>  <br><br>Do you realize that's not a fault of the source material but bad adapting on Ufotable's part?</br></br>  <br> not reading the VN </br>  <br>Nice shitposting.</br>  <br>You can redeem your smugness at the complementary gift shop. They sell tiny Excalibur knives and Gay bulge tea stirrers.</br>  <br>Being a reder is always well regarded. Adaptations are for plebs, a real man reads the original story.</br>  <br>So you're saying that Ufotable's bad adapting made UBW better than it was in the VN? This is a bad thing why?</br>  <br>But I read it at a time when all we had was the UBW movie and 2006 anime, there was no other choice, anon-senpai!</br>  <br>If you think UBW was badly adapted, try watching Zero or DEEN's adaptations.</br>  <br>I'm kinda surprised he's not 150 lbs. fatter at this point.</br>  <br>Because it's the difference between being ignorant and not ignorant. The most common complaints about UBW pretty much all come down to people not understanding that they were watching an adaptation of a visual novel route as opposed to a whole story. If the adaptation ends up being good, expect Heaven's Feel to have much better reception than UBW, at least in the west, because more people will at that point understand the kind of story they're actually watching.</br>  <br>you can stop now</br>  <br>/tv/ went to shit when it stopped being the board of the pedophiles, those guys were at least fun.<br>Now is just Bane spamming and capeshit threads.</br></br>    <br>You can say something is not retarded because it was in the VN.</br>  <br> All the bait in this world <br>Now that would be cool.</br></br>  <br>Even in the fucking key visual.</br>  Shinji, not even once.  <br> &gt;  HF Rin &gt; Fate Rin &gt; UBW Rin <br> implying UBW rin with her dere dere kissu makes her best rin instantly. </br></br>      <br>What about Heaven's Feel?</br>  <br><br> Shinji saved humanity from Gil-kun <br>I expected as much from Wakame-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>Completely irrelevant.</br>  <br>Snack.</br>  <br>As relevant as midcard jobbers.</br>  <br> hating the cutest fate </br>  <br>why are all those vile vixens in a picture with glorious rin?</br>  <br><br> All the bait in this world <br>sounds good to me<br>but what image would you base it on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it's a bit goofy sounding, but it kind of does make sense.</br>  <br>Substitute the fish for Gil</br>  Does anyone read KissXSis? Or am I the only one?  I do but &gt;Vortex  <br>You might aswell just read a doujin on fakku instead, the manga doesnt stand out amongst others in terms of fanservice but the OVA series is one of the best in that department. Unless of course you're reading it for the plot, in which case i would call you a fucking retard and insist that you stop lying to yourself</br>  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  Dropped that shit as soon as they forced the sensei.  <br>Sporty Sis &gt; Lewd Sis &gt; Miss &gt; Piss &gt; Miss's sis</br>  only for the sensei  <br>Lewd Sis &gt; Sporty Sis &gt; Miss's sis &gt; Miss &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Piss</br>  pee chan is best girl  <br> fakku </br>  The more they put in piss and sensei the worse the manga gets. I would event take a fucking loli chapter right now and the loli is the worst character  I look at the pictures`  <br>Yes, but only with my hand firmly grasping my dick</br>  <br>It's shit because sensei never had a chance of winning from the start. He's going to fuck his sisters and that's it.

Cerea is completely boring with her chivalry shit, plus she has a filthy filled with shit Horse pussy. Also lets not forget she belongs to a race that a pitiful tradition of cucking. Papi is literally mentally challenged and Mero has a NTR fetish. Although Rachnera and maybe Suu are better than them<br><br>The MON squad are far superior in every way. You have Smith, Zombina, Tio, Manako, and Doppel who are great. Fuck, just Zombina and Smith themselves are so much better than the main group.</br></br></br></br>  puddi puddi  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br> Now we know the amount of people who likes Papi is really low <br>I'd rather say the amount of people who have her as their favorite is low. Everyone likes Papi.</br></br>  <br>What did they do to Tio's body holy fuck</br>  someone had this idea already<br><br>show me the template</br></br>  <br> The MON squad <br>Isn't trapped by the harem curse.<br><br> You have Miia who's irrelevant and turns into a jealousy gag <br>Is the biggest victim of the harem curse.<br> Cerea is completely boring with her chivalry shit <br>Is next to Miia on the harem curse powerlevel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's so soft she's collapsing under her own softness.</br>  What's Smith showing them?  <br>the MON girls are all just monster girls for people who dont like monster girls. You have dead girl, tall girl, one eye girl, and transforming girl, none really have any super different features.</br>  <br>Smith looks incredible on this shot. Wish Okayado would do something interesting with her but again, he's not even doing interesting shit with the main girls either.</br>   there are people in this thread, right now, who wouldn't tenderly love a horse pussy <br>Disgusting, all of you.</br>     Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.     <br> Rachnera <br> not cucking you </br></br>  <br>  loving a Horse pussy that is filthy and mixed with shit <br>  not disgusting  <br><br>Have you ever heard of good Hygiene?</br></br></br></br>  <br>LUCKY MOTHER FUCKER!</br>  <br>Stop posting this shit, I don't want to have to filter MON too.</br>  <br>That's because Rachenera literally has a two settings: Fuck and Lazy</br>  The cutest  <br>She's looks ugly as fuck here.</br>  <br>do you think she would cheat on darling?</br>  <br/>  <br>Thank you, based anon.</br>  <br>A while back I actually got this exact thing drawn on a drawthread in /h/. Should I post it here, or are Cathyl tits too lewd?</br>   Torpedo tits. <br>Yeah this is looking better than Lamia.</br>  <br> (obviously I'm talking about Rachnee being the best of the best). <br>Mah african brother</br></br>  <br>Don't talk to me about hygiene, you bratty smug hamster.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone likes Papi.</br>  <br>Wtf</br>  Zombina and Suu are the best.  <br>Make one that says Zombina a best and another one for Rachnera as well.</br>  <br>Mermaid standing up...</br>  <br><br>This is one fetish that i legitimately cannot understand, you want to shove your dick in a horse?</br></br>  <br>Cunts hate Papi.</br>  Is it okay for me to have four favorite girls?  <br>Depends on who they are.</br>  <br>Not him but it's a centaur. <br><br>Like, you wouldn't fuck a boy in the ass but you'd do anal with a girl.

Beside the inevitable Riku page, every single panel is gold.<br>Praise Oda. Now give us Crocodile</br>  <br>Am I the only one who doesn't give a shit about X Drake? I just want to see Kid and Bonney.</br>  <br>Kid wasnt trained by Rayleigh though<br><br>whatever he could possibly have been doing has nothing on being trained by the Pirate King's right-hand man</br></br></br>  <br>Doffy eyes, kaidou, and shanks wrecking kidd please.</br>  How OP will the Straw hats be when Fujitora joins the crew?  <br>yes</br>  <br>He doesn't have as much personality as some of the other supernovas, but he still has a lot of potential (an ex-marine who's loyalty to Kaidou is up for debate).</br>  <br>I initially didn't give much of a shit about him but then Law's flashback came.<br>Also, he's a fucking Tyrex. That's awesome.</br></br>  <br><br>Bonney is BB's rape slave now.</br></br>  <br>With this it means drake is Kaido's ally or member of his crew now?</br>  <br>The only (ex)-marine I can see joining them is Kuzan.</br>  <br>well, he's with Blackbeard now.</br>  <br>training with Rayleigh was the safer way. It doesn't negate the gains that can be made by just going off into the new world and doing it the dangerous way battle after battle<br><br>Again. Look to Law for proof. And he got to sit in an ice castle as a shichibukai instead attacking yonkou ships like Kidd did.<br><br>He lost an arm for it and probably some crew members but you are crazy if you don't think Kidd is at /least/ as strong as luffy is right now.<br><br>That's 2 years of new world battles.<br><br>think about the progress the strawhats made with 6 months - 1 year of grand line battles.<br><br>Zoro had some of his best improvements made when his ass got kicked and he was dying<br><br>Luffy as well. The reason Luffy opted for the training wasn't because you can't learn in the new world.<br><br>it was because he realized how foolish it is to go there when he isn't ready and potentially lose crew mates. he had finally grew up a little bit after ace death.<br><br>If he saved Ace he most likely would have met up with everyone in those 2 days or so and they would have did it the same way Kidd did it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For now, but do you really think he'll stay with them for the rest of the series?</br>  <br> safer way <br> battling ginormous animals that take kong dongers to defeat day in and day out with changing environemental conditions </br></br>  <br>Finally something happens.<br><br>This arc was terrible.</br></br></br>  <br> battling ginormous animals that take kong dongers to defeat day in and day out with changing environemental conditions <br> Bluffy still hasn't mastered his Gear form </br></br>  <br>fuck off with your stale meme</br>  <br>Rayleigh laughed but I am sure he had the island coated in his CoO waiting to save luffy if need be. <br><br>It was the safest harshest training ever.<br><br>It's akin to military training. It's more psychological than anything. Way safer than jumping into the new world with no conceptualization of haki.</br></br></br></br></br>   EVERYONE REACTS TO THING : THE CHAPTER <br><br> Best in a while </br></br>  <br>Almost ready to challenge the WG tier. However I believe he will join the revolutionaries. They seem a better fit for his goal of paying back Akainu.</br>  <br>bet you will say the same after the next arc<br>just drop this manga already</br></br>  <br>didnt he leave like 3/4 of the way through the training? meaning luffy was able to manage on his own without protection</br>  <br>These chapters are always good because they tell us about the whereabouts of people everywhere. What is there not to like ?</br>  <br>I hope there is going to be a Revolutionary arc at some point.<br><br>Luffy needs to meet his dad already and go on adventures with Sabo.</br></br></br>  <br>Akainu will be the biggest fuckup fleet admiral in history if Fujitora joins the Revolutionaries<br><br><br> run off one of your best assets in aokiji <br> fujitora makes you look like a fool on DDMNN <br> back talks you in front of a bunch of marines and the only thing you can say is "y-you better fix this fujitora <br> joins the revolutionaries and tells them all of the navy secrets <br><br><br>No luffy mastered the basics in 1.5 years. He was done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is Sabo going to become a recurring character now? It seems like he's more than willing to go out of his to help Luuffy even if he doesn't like it. I wouldn't be surprised if he starts secretly trailing the Strawhats, or gets some other revolutionary to keep him updated just to make sure they don't get into too deep shit  <br>I thought it was pretty good for the majority of it, though resetting everyones positions once bird cage started and the dwarves were fucking pointless and tacked another 10-15 chapters we didn't need onto it.<br><br>The Doflamingo fight was really poorly handled though. I've preferred practically every other sagas final battle to Doflamingo's thanks to all the distractions, "I'm not really done yet" attacks from Law, Doffy's refusal to use his signature techniques on Luffy because Oda wrote himself into a corner, and that weird shit with Trebol that didn't really pay off.<br><br>As a whole this Pirate Alliance saga has been decent but I wouldn't rank it above Baroque Works, Impel Down, Skypeia, Water 7 or even Thriller Bark. It's sort of a low-middle tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mastered the basics <br> done </br></br>  <br>Yes that's what Rayleigh was there to teach him. Once he knew Luffy could handle himself without the training wheels he finally left.<br><br>We know he was there when luffy was using hardening and gear fourth. The basics are pretty in depth</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I still preferred this fight to the Enel one.</br>   Kid <br> Croc mention <br>Good. Now I just want to see Law's reaction, the Heart pirates' reaction, and Luffy and Sabo having a good talk. And Doffy's eyes but that isn't going to happen.</br></br>  I liekd the arc, but the last third or so just felt horribly drawn out<br><br>Also what the fuck happened to Bellamy</br></br>  <br>Sabo left already, or is close to leaving.</br>  <br>Bellamy is kill</br>  <br>but he still needed gear 4th to take down those animals, he was sufficiently trained in it to the point he could survive day and night without rayleigh, those monsters werent a walk in the park even at the end of his training</br>  <br>no, she's the revolutionary armys relief station</br>  What was that about Kuzan joining forces with Blackbeard or did I just read a shit translation?  <br> And Doffy's eyes but that isn't going to happen </br>  <br>The fucking pacing was horrid.<br>Reading the arc through again now that it's almost ended makes it a lot better read and I'm actually liking it now.</br></br>  <br>Guys Akainu and Aokiji are battling it out for Fleet admiral!</br>  <br>he apparently helping them out, not confirmed for crewmember just yet but definitely doing some shit with them</br>  <br>Fuck that, he has never once contacted Luffy in all these years and now this? If I were Luffy I wouldn't be really pissed if he were to take off again without taking at least a couple minutes to catch up with his lil bro first.</br>  <br><br>Luffy, Law and the others straw-hat will probably leave with them.</br></br>  <br>*would be</br>  <br>Apparently the best way to say good bye to family in the one piece world is not to say anything at all<br><br>They all seem to randomly appear and not say anything<br><br>look at dragon. All he does is stand on things ominously and help luffy without him even knowing about it and that's his biological father</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br>http://mangastream.com/read/one_pie<wbr>ce/793/end<br> This week's One Piece may be a little later than usual, and that is because I spent extra time to ensure all translations were as faithful and accurate as they could be. This chapter was full of dialogue from the Gorousei, Akainu, and Fujitora, all of whom speak with either rather difficult-to-understand dialects or complicated vocabulary. This is the reason some other translations out there are confusing. If any of you have any questions about the content of this translation, please don't hesitate to ask me. I'll do my best to answer. <br><br> PS: Yes, it really does say that Kuzan joined Blackbeard. At least, it says that that Gorousei dude thinks that Kuzan joined Blackbeard. His true intentions have obviously not been revealed yet. <br><br>He could just be using them.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  I remember there were talks about Kuzan joining either the revolutionaries or Black Beard a long time ago.<br><br>What chapter was that speculation based on?</br></br>  <br>I would certainly hope so, I can't really see Kuzan joining them for any reason.</br>   tfw we won't see doffy for a good 100 chapters or so   <br>It wasn't drawn out at all you fucking fag<br><br>If you are having issues with the pacing, wait until you have a volume's worth of chapters to read, then go read. You'll find that there are ZERO pacing issues, it's just that the bridge chapters make it seem that way when reading weekly. Oda generally doesn't give a fuck about having a twist every single week</br></br></br>  <br><br>Back during Dressrossa where Luffy meets Burgess and talks to Blackbeard over the Dendenmushi, Blackbeard mentions not trusting Aokiji which led people to believe Kuzan/Aokiji had joined him.</br></br>  <br>the whole arc was underwhelming piece of shit with boring fights but maybe this will redeem it</br>  <br>Well then, next time you're in for a treat!<br><br>Fujitora runs around for Law/Luffy, finds Sabo and revs instead!<br><br>A bunch of combatants and civvies lay about in a castle, hang up pieces of rubble for decorations and scrounge the dust for food and drink at the party!<br><br>Zoro gets lost trying to find the booze, finds half the crew and Caesar fucking dead off the coast of the iron bridge!<br><br>Will Asakura Hao become the Shaman KIng? Tune in next week for Flint the Time Detective!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The arc had tons of useless detours and padding.<br>Dressrosa alone is 1/8th of One Piece's run. That's fucking massive for a single arc not much bigger in scope than the Alabasta arc.</br></br>  <br>I don't wanna see them get someone super overpowered like that personally. I want to see them get someone strong, but not godlike that will train along side them and power up to become unstoppable like the rest of them did.</br>  Yeah, fuck Rikku.  So is Fujitora fucking going to pursue the LawHats or will he ask Akainu to suck his cock?<br><br>That last comment isn't quite clear.</br></br>  What would the reaction be if we catch up with the rest of the crew and find out Sanji was beaten by Big Mom off-screen  <br>so guys now that the 2 year grind is over, what did you think of it? who was your Favrorite officer agent? for me it was Diamante, those steel spiked balls reminded me of don krieg but even cooler</br>  <br>Sorry, meant for <br>I'm tired.</br></br>  <br>I'd kill myself</br>  HOW THE FUCK DID AKAINU GO FROM MARINE HQ TO MARIJOIS IN LESS THAN A DAY?  <br><br>Beta as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it ? There's no doubt in my mind he's leaving the Marine.</br>  <br>I don't think there'll ever be a SH as strong as Zoro and Sanji (and Luffy ofc)</br>  <br>He is a man of honor. No way he will kill off the guys he just admitted saved Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Jinbe</br>  <br><br>yea but then it would look like shit for the marines. Lose 2 admirals in 2 years.<br><br>Powerful people don't grow on trees.<br><br>If we just wanted to denounce the Shichibukai system we could've had absalom broadcast shit to other islands. It didn't need to be the admiral.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elite officers were shit imo, except vergo. <br><br>favorite officer easily senor pink</br></br></br>  Kaido incoming!  <br> not much bigger in scope than the Alabasta arc. <br>You're fucking stupid. A crimelord taking over a country is soundly beaten by a crimelord who already runs a country and a huge worldwide crime syndicate working with smuggling, gunrunning, devil fruit creation &amp; that serves TWO emperors<br><br>And in terms of shit that happened, we had Sabo come back from the dead, Luffy become an absolutely insane power both combat and politically, arguably the strongest warlord goes down, a whole country has to team up to help beat Doffy<br><br>The scope is fucking HUGE compared to Alabasta. Alabasta was dragged out, not this. As much as I liked portions about the animals of Alabasta and the comedy, it was such a slow fucking arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he will either die before he can join or zoro and sanji will have surpassed him by then.</br>  <br>Marine HQ is right by the Red line. I don't see how that's surprising.</br>  <br>Kirin confrim!</br>  <br>He's also a man of Law and Luffy is the main reason a bunch of prisoners escaped from Impel down.<br><br>No amount of island saving can undo the wrong that Luffy did. <br>Granted BB would've taken his crewmates either way but it was Luffy's fault that so many deadly killers escaped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really doubt this<br><br>but it would be neat to see Sanji kicking Crocodile's shit in</br></br></br>  <br>They moved Marine HQ to the new world after BB broke the old one didn't they?</br>  <br>Marines are incompetent and borderline useless who depends only on stong big guys to keep power projection. We know that since ID.</br>  <br>because they are close to each other...</br>  <br> If we just wanted to denounce the Shichibukai system we could've had absalom broadcast shit to other islands. It didn't need to be the admiral. <br>Oh yeah you're right, I forgot Absalom didn't work under a penname and that literally everyone and their mother knows about the guy and how to contact him. Moreover it's not like Absalom doesn't have his own newspaper.</br></br>  I thought Sengoku became the Inspector and Garp was the instructor, could it be more light hearted Sengoku talking to Tsuru?  <br>I wanna see Urouge and Ennel (it has to be him, right?)</br>  <br>That would be cool</br>  I'm glad thi chapter showed that Akainu doesn't like the Tenryubito. Gives me hope he might decide to kill the motherfuckers one day once he can get away with it after their "secret" is revealed/stolen    <br>No she just stole some pizzas , she's pathetic compared to the other .</br>  <br>well to be fair alabasta didnt have shit being resolved a lot of it was instead introduced; poneglyphs introduced along with ancient weapons, an entire country fighting itself, pretty sure the land structure was muuch bigger than dressrosa, lost a pseudocrewmember and picked up another, zoro kind of discovering haki early af, mr 2 intro, nami getting her weapon introduced, 10T god ussop, first time we see nami in the bath, first time luffy took down a shichibukai</br>  wouldnt it be cool if kaidos fruit is a fruit that turns him into a deer?  <br>if he was that much a man of the law he would have taken down doffy himself</br>  <br>Fujitora not being really a marine is the key part. The way he got angry at his response proves he believed Akainu would understand his standing. Of course, if he had been a marine from the beginng he would know Akainu as an extremist.</br>  <br>no. it wouldn't.</br>  <br>No. He needs a cool fruit like a mythical zoan, a human human type model or a gorilla.</br>  <br>I really don't think Jinbe would fare well against Zoro. Against Luffy and Sanji, maybe.</br>  <br>no?</br>  There were Fujitorafags on /a/ that actually believed Akainu would be happily patting Fujitora on the back after Dressrosa.<br><br>How does it feel to be low level pleb readers just because you spent all that time sucking Fujitora's dick and couldn't see the actual picture?<br><br>Fujitora getting lightsabered in the heart by Kizaru in the near future just went up 100% after this chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm stupid and/or I'll just pretend I still don't understand Fujitora didn't do anything on purpose <br>Either way you're a sad, pathetic existence.</br></br>  <br>a mythical santas reindeer fruit, hes destined to fight it out against chopper</br>  <br> and a huge worldwide crime syndicate working with smuggling, gunrunning, devil fruit creation &amp; that serves TWO emperors <br>Most of this was background stuff that the Straw Hats had nothing to do with in the Dressrosa arc.<br>It has ramifications for future islands they visit but we didn't spend any time in the underground black market.<br>The factory destruction, which was the original purpose for Luffy's group entering the island, became an afterthought handled by the dwarves in a few pages.<br><br> we had Sabo come back from the dead, Luffy become an absolutely insane power both combat and politically, arguably the strongest warlord goes down, a whole country has to team up to help beat Doffy <br>Alabasta introduced Ace and the Whitebeard Pirates, Luffy becoming a world renowned threat with political connections instead of a small time rookie, for the first time ever Luffy defeated a warlord, a major country was at stake instead of a small village like usual, Robin joined the crew and a huge chunk of the Ancient Kingdom subplot was established.<br><br>The key difference between Alabasta and Dressrosa is that Alabasta was a tighter narrative focusing on the Straw Hats' gaining political attention, while Dressrosa was much broader by throwing in a truckload of future alliances all at once to get them out of the way. It had a much larger cast to work with.<br><br>Even with all of that it still felt like 20 chapters longer than it needed to be. A good chunk of the war games' segment of the arc was spent on everyone just getting back into position after bird cage knocked them out of the palace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope somehow there'll be more Kid/Law interaction in the future. Not even because I'm a fujo, their dynamic was just really interesting at Sabaody.  <br>human fruit<br>model:Jesus</br></br>    <br>i know he didnt do anything on purpose to denounce the shichibukai system, a man of the law is personified by akainu not fujitora, he instead is a man of a moral code and justice, justice is not necessarily always on the side of law</br>  <br>guess that depends on where they are. Jinbe and Zoro MAY be able to go toe-to-toe on land though I doubt Zoro could tank a fist from Akainu<br><br>Sanji has a chance undewater with Blue Walk but I still dont see him winning or even really wearing Jinbe out</br></br></br>  <br> There were Fujitorafags on /a/ that actually believed Akainu would be happily patting Fujitora on the back after Dressrosa. <br><br>I'm more surprised that there are Fujitorafags on /a/ that give a single fuck about Akainu opinion on him.<br>Fuji is great because he was clearly not very agreeable with his orders from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the arc was stale you nigger.<br><br>2 years of no fucking development. <br>Remember when mafia pirate was sucked up by an airship or weird planet thing?<br>We still have no idea what happened and that was YEARS ago and now he just popped up again.<br>That was way more interesting than the lame shit that went down the last two years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So that big black ball that absorbed Capone's gang wasn't Enel's moon ship from space but was just one of Big Mom's boys? Lame.  <br>Buggy and his treasure hunting ways</br>  <br>Unlikely. Sadly enough.<br>I really don't see how or why they would interact with one another at this point.<br>But really I'm more interested by Kidd meeting Luffy again. I like his slight fanboyism for him.</br></br></br>  So we've seen an "Ultimate" Logia and Paramecia, right ? What if Kaido got the Ultimate Zoan ? It's just a "Beast" fruit. You can turn into any 'beast' you want. Maybe with sufficient training, you can body parts of different beasts at the same time. Something along those lines.<br><br><br>Although, I would die from happiness if it was something like pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>No because he is going to die</br>  <br> 2 years of no fucking development <br>welp someone hasnt been reading</br></br>  Hate Dressrosa as an arc all you want but can we at least agree that Doffy is a GOAT villain?  <br>Agree<br>Rather see more of kid and bonney. X drake isn't that bad but he's kinda lacking compare to other worst generation pirates.</br></br>  <br>But the law says that Doflamingo can loot, kill, rape and plunder to his heart content. <br>Fujitora was going against the law here.</br></br>  <br>I miss him already .</br>  <br> *the law was on Fujitora's side here </br>  <br>nope<br>still Crocodile</br></br>  <br>Well, fishfolk are 10 times stronger than humans or something, right ? So Akainu's punch could be owed to that. And I think it's because I feel that Zoro is just the best at very close combat. I know Luffy and Sanji are too but I feel like Zoro's always had better and faster reactions. And like Usopp and even a fishmen has said, Zoro's speed is incredible, even under water. <br><br>Maybe I'm just giving too much credit. Idk.</br></br></br>  <br>...no. Being a warlord means you can:<br> call yourself a pirate without being arrested <br> attack other pirates as much as you want <br> have a crew and pirate ship and flag <br>They can't attack civilians.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fishfolk are 10 times stronger than humans or something, right ? <br>their base strength is<br>they have around the same potential though</br></br></br>  Reminder that the "Father" is with the "Big Mom"   Kidd &amp; friends want to take on fucking Shanks of all people <br>It's a shame really, I really liked them and now they're probably gonna get jobbed out offscreen</br>  <br>He's a great villain but he was drowned out by a lot of other shit during 'his' arc.</br>  <br>I don't think it's Jinbe's "potential" that helped him take Akainu's punch.</br>  <br>Nah. They're going to finish off Shanks right after Blackbeard weakens him.</br>  <br> Powerful people don't grow on trees. <br><br>Garp's #2, Bogard, could be the next Admiral.<br><br>Bogard is clearly powerful enough to be Admiral.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They fucking deserve it too if they were high enough to think they could take on Shanks.</br>  <br>agreed. partly because he's the first villian we got a detailed background story.</br>  <br>theyre allowed to loot and plunder other pirates and uncivilized lands, neither of which doflamingo was doing on dressrosa</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127843233 <br> lmao <br><br>Underaged people should leave /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Crocodile <br> Generic vilain who kill his teammates because he doesn't like them.. </br></br>  <br>He's a good swordsman but we haven't shit else.</br>  <br> blackbeard and shanks fight each other to a stalemate <br> kuzan then goes and turns on blackbeard <br> kidd takes advantage of the confusion and shanks Shanks <br><br>I can see it already</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Who ?</br>  <br>Kidd confirmed for weakling.<br><br>Ran away from Big Mom after losing an arm to take on an entirely new Yonkou.<br><br>Never takes revenge for losing against Big Mom.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strong enough to hang out with Garp and Garp is confident enough to make him his #2.<br><br>That should say something about Bogard's strength.</br></br></br>  <br> gets his ass handed to him by Big Mom <br> decides the best course of action is to take on Shanks <br>I can't even begin to comprehend what that man is thinking</br></br></br>  <br>And faggots should play somewhere else anon.</br>  <br> Shanks being confused in a battle no matter what happens and letting some kid with a flaming beacon for a head come near him <br> Fucking Shanks, of all people <br>bruh</br></br></br>  <br>like you wouldn't kill Galdino too</br>  <br>was he even in the war?</br>  WHO GETS REVEALED FIRST?!<br><br>KAIDOU or GREEN TIGER or VEGAPUNK?</br></br>  <br>he only killed off the fodder, he kept the real ones around, still travelling around with daz; also see doffy and bellamy relationship<br>doffy confirmed for generic af</br></br>  btw when will Corby and Alvida meet again?  <br>Kaidou <br>simple <br>everyone <br>wins</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if you were going to go after one of the Emperors, wouldn't you go for Shanks too? Out of all of them, he seems the weakest. He's missing an arm, after all.</br>  <br>and Shachi!</br>  <br>Shanks is the strongest fuck outta' here</br>  <br>Kaidou most likely.Also the admiral name is green bull.</br>  <br>We don't know why they hang out though. For all we know Garp saved him from a burning ship or some shit. And literally all the Admirals we've seen have some kind of mega DF ability. Bogart, I repeat, is a good swordsman but we haven't seen shit else. Saying he can be an Admiral is baseless as it can get.</br>  <br>I know that, but if you had to choose of course you'd go for him.</br>  <br>Ah, yes, sorry.</br>  <br> killed off <br> one piece </br></br>  <br> yfw it turns out Shanks can't actually do shit in a fight and that he simply made his career out of intimidating everyone with his haki </br>  So are the Gorosei lower than Cipher Pol? This seems to suggest it. http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/2<wbr>851/6</wbr>  <br>Shanks stop kaidou two years ago from attacking whitebeard without any injuries.<br><br>Shanks &gt; Kaidou</br></br></br>  <br>Why not just name him Black Bull and make him cuck Sanji?</br>  <br>Water-water fruit when.</br>  <br> stop <br>I doubt that. He probably just walked over to Kaidou and intimidated him like he did with Whitebeard.</br></br>  <br>Gorosei are the bodyguards of the celestials</br>  <br> yfw when Teach and the Kidd Alliance close in on Shanks and Mihawk rescues him </br>  <br> Has no arm <br> Only one ship <br> Face is fucked <br> Still stopped the War right after stopping a fellow Emperor <br>"yea, guise, let's go after Shanks. This is a great idea, trust me"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks is a former Oro Jackson crewmate and Kidd wants the One Piece. It makes sense.</br>  <br>it seems cp0 only answers to the celestial dragons</br>  <br>cp0 is under direct control of celestials, gorosei arent always informed, so its like fbi vs cia</br>  <br>I'd mark out.</br>  <br>Na anon.<br>Sanji and his fan base have suffer enough</br></br>  <br> yfw Shanks is the Buggy of his generation. </br>  <br><br>Finishing off weakened guy is the special move of the black beard pirate. It<br> will go like that again.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Shanks probably set his territory up guarding the path to Raftel and everything.</br>  <br> Why are all the Yonkou such huge motherfuckers? What do they put in the NW's water? <br><br>Asking the right questions. Sky islands water has trace amounts of seastone in it and people get wings in just a few generations. Seastone is in the sea and fishmen are evolved humans. Celestial Dragons won't come down from redline without fucking space suits although their descendants think it's so they don't have to breath commoner air. Something is up with seastone beyond being kryptonite to DF users.</br></br></br>  http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/2<wbr>851/9<br><br>Is this garp or sengoku whos with Tsuru Chan? Who do you think they are chasing?</br></br></wbr>  <br>he could go after buggy</br>  <br>Whitebeard wasn't intimidated. Regardless, Shanks stopped Kaido. That is a fact.<br><br><br>You have no idea how much I want this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> buggy of his generation <br>theyre in the same generation</br></br>  <br>It's probably some kinda meteorite or something, no ?</br>  <br> GREEN TIGER <br>I think you may have crossed a wire, anon</br></br>  <br> Shanks stopped Kaido. That is a fact <br>They never said Shanks FOUGHT Kaidou. He might have just talked to him and stood in his way and Kaidou thought it wouldn't be worth it.</br></br>  <br><br>The guy effortlessly clashed with fucking Whitebeard.<br><br>Kidd anc co. Are gonna get it, hard.<br><br>Also, I think we are pretty biased thinking that they will fail while Law/Luffy will beat Kaido. Maybe plot armor?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> get wings in a few generations <br>i think u just went full retard</br></br>  <br>Honestly Luffy/Law/Zoro &gt; Kidd/Apoo/Basil</br>  <br>Except anyone with a brain felt that Fujitora wasn't anything like a Marine from the very start and it didn't make sense for Fujitora to be sent to Dressrosa in the first place.<br><br>Fujitora was a newbie so why was a newbie sent to Dressrosa?<br><br>An experienced veteran like Kizaru should have been sent to Dressrosa, instead, and Akainu at least knows Kizaru wouldn't scheme against him.<br><br>Because, Fujitora already has 3 strikes against him and Akainu can't trust Fujitora anymore after this.<br><br>1) Fujitora just admitted to Akainu that he doesn't report everything to Akainu<br><br>2) Akainu is always 2nd in priority to Fujitora's own goals <br><br>3) Fujitora will actually dare to delay vital information to Akainu.<br><br>Fujitora already got blacklisted by Akainu.<br><br>Fujitora is ever looking more likely to get assassinated soon either by Kizaru or Akainu, himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot killer</br>  <br>he probably just finished watching Strong World</br>  So Cipher Pol doesn't take orders from the Gorosei but the Celestial Dragons.<br><br>This kinda makes Dofla more highranking than the Gorosei in a way even though he is an ex Celestial Dragon, he still has a Celestial Dragon's blood, which is something the Gorosei don't have.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I want Shanks to be killed by BB but it's maybe possible for them to get him in 3v1 i guess. They are going to be some legend in the future anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. I don't think anyone mentioned fighting except you. All we said was that he stopped Kaido without injuries.<br><br><br>And he's not an old sickened fucker with fickle allies. Kidd has no idea the amount of shit he's about to step in. <br><br>Then again, Oda could make them ridiculously strong and give the Red Hair's trouble. It'd be a load of bullshit but it could happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Plot armor ? <br>Obviously , even if luffy would fight all yonko in the same time , he wouldn't be killed .</br></br>  <br>Yeah, underaged faggots like yourself should fuck off back to </br>  <br> 3v1 <br>Shanks does have an entire crew at his back</br></br>  <br>Aren't the Gorosei Celestial Dragons?</br>    <br>his bloodline doesnt count for shit anymore, the only reason he held influence was because he knew some secret, if they could have they would have eliminated him already</br>  <br>As much as I'd hate anything bad happening to Shanks, it would show how much of a total badass he is if a Yonko and 4 Supernovas had to gang up to beat him.<br><br>Also, I wonder if Luffy will actually intervene to save Shanks for the time being and focus Kidd's attention to Big Mom</br></br></br>  <br><br>So does Kidd and the others.<br><br><br>Franky did lost against against a large amount of opponnent so why not Shanks's crew</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right after you go first Mr. Faggot</br>  <br><br>we don't know how kidd lost his arm, stop with the headcanon</br></br>  <br>So does every one else<br><br><br>Not as far as we know, no.</br></br></br></br>  <br> comparing Fodder House to Beckman, Roux and Yasopp <br><br>yeah nah I can't see any of them even getting to approach Shanks</br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/narutoforum/</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks doesn't need saving from luffy. <br>Ben beckman alone is stronger than kidd, hawkin and apollo individually.</br></br>  <br>Why? The fact that a Supernova hasn't been kicked out of the New World yet is already bullshit.<br><br>Kidd and the rest need to be kicked out already and they will be sacrifices to Shanks.</br></br></br>  <br>They might just do something piraty and assassinate him.<br><br>Not everyone does it the Luffy way</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit to being underaged? Hope you enjoy your ban.</br>  <br>blackbeard will probably help kidd in some way<br><br>and then stab him in the back when both he and shanks are weak from fighting</br></br></br>  <br><br>They all will do something that matter in the story.</br></br>  <br>Kid will be seen as a pussy if he does that. It doesn't fit in his character.</br>  <br> Kid  <br> allowing for any kind of subtlety <br><br>I doubt Kid will be able to contain himself. He'll probably try to slap the Red Force as soon as he's in range</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you enjoy Cock Mr Faggot.</br>  <br>He is known for killing civilians and being merciless. Why would assassinating a Yonkou not be his character...</br>  <br>Well yea but like I said, Oda can make the Supernovas as strong as he wants now. Imagine 4 people with the same strength as Law, Luffy and Zoro. It may very well be higher for all we know. <br><br>It would be bullshit but it's possible.<br><br><br>Why would they be kicked out ? The way to survive in the New World is to either fight a Yonko or join one. Everyone except Bonney and Urouge has been shown to be somewhere in those 2 categories.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>really because I kind of think the most relevance Hawkins is ever going to get is from joining up with Kid</br>  <br><br>  Giant monster made of steel the size of a little island mode </br></br>  <br>If he uses undermine tricks such as trying to poison his drink or something for assassination will be out of his character. He seems to be similar like luffy where he would prefer to show his strength rather than some cheap assassination.</br>  <br>Yes, he kills and crucifies people who laugh at him. He doesn't grumble under his breath and stab them when they're alone in an alley.</br>  <br>He won't take Shanks alone 1v1. So he will probably be isolating him and take him on with the other two.<br><br>But I think he would be up for subtly killing him or his crewmembers, cripple him or sabotage his ship or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Fujitora is ever looking more likely to get assassinated soon <br>Yes,we can be 100% sure that a rogue admiral that just got established is going to get shot right after his introductory arc. <br><br>I don't understand people who think Fujitora is on the way out. If anything, he's going to become more relevant to the plot in the future. Kuzan too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Fujitora would be introduced to be killed off that easily. <br><br>He's more likely going to end up as an inadvertent major factor in the revolutionary elements, despite still carrying the legal authority of an Admiral; eventually meeting up with Kuzan, maybe forming some sort of trust. <br><br>That leaves us with the 2 strongest Admirals remaining on the World Government's side and the wild card of Green Bull; and Kuzan and Fujitora on the other side with comparable but inferior strength, but potential surprise assets. <br><br>I can see an extreme eventual Kizaru vs BB + Luffy&amp;Fuji vs Akainu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what people said about Law and then he easily quit being a warlord despite that fact that he just got established as a warlord.<br><br>Oda established Kizaru as a marine executioner.<br><br>Fujitora will be Kizaru's first victim.<br><br>Kizaru couldn't kill Z in the manga so Fujitora will take Z's place to hype up Kizaru as the most dangerous marine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as if Shanks is going to be taken down by 'clever tricks' from cocky Rookie the nth.</br>  <br>Yeah, he's way too enthusiastic and hot-blooded to do otherwise.<br> why is he so cute <br>He better not die or I'm sending Oda a letter bomb or something.</br></br></br>   Issho standing up to Sakazuki and telling him that he refuses to go after the Straw Hats <br><br>New Best admiral</br></br>  Perona is cute! cute!  <br>it IS kind of weird how cute he is<br><br>Why is his voice so goddamn deep though? He's 23</br></br></br>  If Capone get artificial fruits for his army he would become scary.  <br>Best girl, hands down.</br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>movie 2</br>  Sakazuki will soon Pompeii Marijoa  <br><br>I want to date Perona!</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Kizaru's been deliberately placed as the "secret final boss" admiral; I don't think Oda will make his real strength obvious until his most relevant moment in the manga. We get little hints of his strength occasionally, like when he tried to murder Law and Luffy during their escape from Marineford, but he half-assed it and said he wasn't going to bother pursuing the issue any further. The only reason he would ever go all-out is if he was in an actually precarious position. We don't know what the ramifications of that could be yet.<br><br>Akainu on the other hand is the "obvious" final boss; coupling that with what we saw in this chapter, we're more likely to see further clashing between Fujitora and Akainu for a very long time.</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  So what happens to Doflamingo now that he got blown the fuck out? No way he goes to pound-me-in-the-ass prison, seeing he's a tenryuubito, right? normal plebs aren't supposed to be able to judge the chosen few, right?  If doffy still alive?  <br>no</br>  Straw Hats should have a loli crewmate. Chopper is just a pet so he doesn't count.  <br><br>You guys make it sound so hot, I can't wait for the doujinshi.</br></br>  <br> Chopper awakens <br> able to look completely human <br> One Piece begins catering to the shota market </br></br></br>  <br>Urouge already defeated Blackbeard. That's why he's lying on the cloud with injuries.</br>  <br>I agree</br>  <br> Oda got rid of Choppers monstrosity just to give it to Kaido </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127845147 <br> /a/ is not 18+ <br><br>please leave</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127845147 <br>Global rule 2.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127845147 <br>Where are the mods. An underaged poster like you needs to learn his place.</br>  <br>They wanted to promote Garp despite him not having a fruit so you're fuckin retarded</br>  <br>Really can't picture her in impel's down prison.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127845147 <br>Global Rules<br>___________<br>Rule 2: You will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you are under the age of 18.</br></br></br>  <br>Salty, thick and hard megacocks as a primary food source.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127845147 <br><br>Global Rule 2 you doublenigger.</br></br>  <br>You should start considering Fujitora as part of a large group instead of an individual.<br><br>I think there's a split in the marines right now, and some of them (the Kuzan, Fujitora and Smoker group) being against the World Government. This group got a little fucked since Sakazuki beat Kuzan, but Fujitora is probably the highest ranked marine among them right now. This is what makes him important: he's not really a "boss" of any sort, he's a piece of another game going on that does not involve Luffy &amp; co in any way.<br><br>I don't think he would be killed only to hype up some other "marine boss"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only CP 0 take commands from dragons</br>  <br>Actually there weren't any females in impel down despite that ugly hag who is now in blackbeards crew, no?</br>  <br>It was Urouge and Enel, actually. That's why he was in the Sky. It's Enel's new home.</br>  <br>That literally changes nothing about what I said though.</br>  What type of zoan is kaido????<br> He ain't no Fucking ant,Dragon,Godzilla or typhon and this chapter proves it. Remember when scotch said that the winter island kaido was on was his favorite? That's a keyword right there, winter. Remember how chopper loved the winter side of punk hazard? This obviously confirms one thing. Kaidos zoan has fur. Godzilla,ants,and dragons don't have fur. Also right now kaido is on a winter island. We don't know if that silhouette was kaido(it probably is) but we know that he's on that island since his crew member was shouting where he was implying that kaido was on that island. Also the silhouette shows kaido has horns. Ants and Godzilla do not have horns. I'm starting to believe kaido has a yeti zoan but I'm probably wrong.</br>  <br>Yeah she was at level six.</br>  <br>"Sky Gods" Urouge and Enel confirmed for new Twin Yonkou.</br>  <br><br>Despite being retired to the training role, Garp would probably help them too.</br></br>  <br> Human model: Yeti <br>P O E T R Y<br>O<br>E<br>T<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what, after Newgate vs Shichibukai, World War II will be former Admirals vs Admirals? I like that</br>  Man i just wanna see more off the revolutionaries.<br>Robin flashbacks etc.</br>  <br>That was what I was thinking here <br><br>But Luffy always manages to get involved in things that don't directly concern him, so I think there's a possibility of him playing some role in how the Marines' disparity plays out; especially considering Mihawk's comment about Luffy's power to turn anyone into an ally. I think we got a hint of that with Fujitora admitting that Luffy saved Dressrosa in this chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think the Final War is going to be WW 3 ? I never even thought about it but could there be another War before the final one ?</br>  <br>maybe he's a Ningen<br><br>im still holding out for a Kilin though</br></br></br>  <br>Because there needs to be winners and losers in the Supernova.</br>  is it just me, or does it look like X drake is with Kaido? cuz hes actually on the same island at least.  <br><br>Oda said it would make MF smalltime.</br></br>  <br> Sanji has a woman he can constantly cook for <br> Bonney has all the food she can eat <br>it's a win win</br></br></br>  <br>also she thinks Zoro is an idiot. So they have that in common.</br>  Potential candidates for the new strawhat crew?<br><br>Hajrudin: The giant who is probably the heaviest hitter the One Piece world has seen so far. He dreams of being the strongest Giant which fulfills his dream quota, fought Luffy in battle making him an ex enemy like Oda said, and the is the one who held up Usopp as the "god" offering Usopp and him a special relationship what with Usopp's obsession with giants. Strawhats is also the most diverse crew, so he'd fill the giant quota. His personality is also different from all the other strawhats.<br><br>Fujitora: also technically once an "enemy" of the strawhats just due to him being in the marines and fighting Sanji. The reason I suggest him is because in this chapter we learned he will most likely leave the marines. What's more is now that Blackbeard has an ex-admiral like we've also learned, it would be a balance the strawhats also got an ex-admiral. He's also got a personality different than the rest of the strawhats, is incredibly powerful, and his first interaction with Luffy was a positive one.<br><br>Bartolomeo: Offers a great deal of power due to his barricades and is the person who wants to be a strawhat the most probably. His personality is also different than any of the other strawhats. <br><br>Bellamy: I hope it's not him but people have been saying he's a candidate. He's shit. But he was once an enemy so it's possible.<br><br>Rebecca: The princess Vivi of the arc so I highly doubt she'll join but it's possible I suppose.<br><br>My money is on Hajrudin</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Need ? No, not really. And honestly, you can just think all the people who joined the Yonkos as losers since they weren't strong enough to oppose them.</br>  <br>It depends on how big Teach gets (meaning: if he's big enough to be part of a "World" event or if it's going to be Luffy vs Teach).<br><br>If the Admirals win in my supposed WW2, WW3 is last (Dragon vs WG). If the former Admirals win, I have no idea how the fuck the series would go on after that.</br></br></br>  <br> dragons don't have fur <br><br>Western dragons dont have fur</br></br></br>  <br>I'm well aware. That literally answered nothing though.</br>  <br>Jinbei??</br>  <br> Rebecca: The princess Vivi of the arc so I highly doubt she'll join but it's possible I suppose. <br>I'm gonna vomit if this happens.</br></br>  <br>CAESAR</br>  <br>This has been revealed since the colosseum</br>  <br>how would hajrudin fit on the thousand sunny?</br>  <br><br> Do you think the Final War is going to be WW 3 ? <br><br>Pretty sure it answers that - at the very least it will be a massive war than dwarfs the ones prior to it, similar to our world.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Really.</br></br>  <br>nah, Crocodile will have surpassed shit too until then. I really think Croc will be endgame tier one day, maybe one of the Yonkou at some kind of post timeskip final chapter</br>  <br>I'm not going to mention the other ones, but I don't see any reason for Bartolomeo to join. If Luffy wants to be big enough for the Yonkou title, he is going to need pirate allies and Law is the only one he has right now (Jinbei kinda is a strawhat already). Bartolomeo is the obvious next one, he already has his own crew he might not want to drop. Also, all he needs is a "you'll be more useful to Luffy-senpai as a captain of your own ship" from any strawhat and he'll be happy with that.</br>  <br>Teach is a Yonko so isn't he automatically big enough ? And he's all about dreams and shit. <br><br>And if the formal Admirals win, the Marines will no longer be a major threat but have a somewhat supporting role. They may even fight against the WG themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not fur that's hair</br>  <br>well they're all becoming better, arent they?<br><br>if we're assuming this is a 1:1 thing then there's no way Zoro is taking out Jinbe. Jinbe held his own against Ace for 10 days. I don't think Zoro is anywhere near that league</br></br></br>  <br>That isn't what I meant though. Read the whole post, at least. I meant is it going to be the third war. Nothing to do with sizes or whatever the fuck.</br>  <br>Through the power of plot armor my friend. I'm guessing Jinbei and Hajrudin will both join.</br>  <br><br>it's the same thing m8</br></br>  <br>Jinbei got rekt easily by Mihawk at Marineford though</br>  Seriously, what was with MangaPanda this week?  <br>Why ? Ace was a Logia user who never used CoA as far as we know. Zoro is a tanky motherfucker who uses CoA and has already proven his speed underwater.</br>  <br> This week </br>  <br>I feel bad for ever having posted this. I never want to see it again.</br>  Why the fuck does Mangastream have to this bullshit? Did they smack their heads on pavement on now they feel the need to use shitty ass fluff in their pretentious ass "translations"?<br><br>Why does One Piece have to have the shittiest of translations.</br></br>  <br>who hasnt been wrecked by Mihawk? Just Vista?</br>  <br>bruh</br>  <br> Teach is a Yonko so isn't he automatically big enough <br>Hell no. Kaidou and Big Mom are yonkou as well and neither would get the same attention Newgate got. Hell, the fucking Shanks vs Kaidou fight didn't get much.<br><br>Teach is not "politically" big to be worthy of a "World" title yet. He holds a 10-men crew and nothing else. Newgate had a bigass crew of his own, and a bunch of high-rated New World captains under his command.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's god making up for one piece's success in japan by giving it shit support in the usa IE 4kids, mangastream, mangapanda</br>  <br>You know what's funny is how possible this is</br>  <br>Shanks</br>  <br>im saying Jinbe can go at it with a monster like Ace was, Ace pummeled Jinbe withOUT armament, logia or no.<br><br>Zoro isnt Ace-tier</br></br></br>   mfw Caeser will be a temp Straw Hat for another like 5 years   <br> Doffy somehow becomes a free man once more by escaping from prison or something <br> meets up with Croc <br> they form an alliance <br>Please, Oda. Please. Even better if Croc's the one to set Doffy free.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He holds a 10-men crew and nothing else <br>You cant be that sure son.</br></br>  <br>Traffy is Disgusting honestly</br>  <br>I'd argue Vista got kinda shafted too.<br>Mihawk acknowledges his existence and then just goes back to thinking about how much Luffy is gonna fuck up the World in the future.<br><br>They did settle it like Gentlemen though.</br></br></br></br>  So what's the deal with Kinemon and Momonosuke? Are they in the Strawhats now or what?<br><br>I mean they both offer unique powers, and Momo could be like the apprentice of the groups like Shanks was for Rogers.</br></br>  <br> Tips sword </br>  <br>I dont know why he was nice to Vista but shit on Daz<br><br>poor Daz didnt deserve that</br></br></br>  <br>You got a problem?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't be surprised if he's a mythical variant of the Inu Inu fruit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127846392 <br>humans dont call their hair fur because humans are insistent on being better than everything else.<br><br>the only time it isnt called fur is when its on a human</br></br></br>  <br>They will be with the strawhats for one more arc (the "rescue Sanji &amp; co" arc). The arc after that wil be the boring as shit "return to Wani" arc and only after that one we'll get the Big Mom (or Kaidou (or both)) fight</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127846392 <br>For God's sake, please never post this again.</br>  <br>Teach has a bunch of commanders under him, just like Newgate. And the Gorosei were talking about how much of a big threat he was even before the timeskip. Kaido and Big Mom weren't relevant before and that's why they didn't get any attention. Simple as that.</br>  <br>Hopefully not.<br>Thousand Sunny will conquer a new unexplored ocean consisting of her tears from crying over missing her daddy.</br></br>  <br>But Shanks has actually shown he can use his power. He physically stopped Akainu with haki and his sword.</br>  <br>Daz wasn't even a swordsman. He was just an assassin and a big name in West Blue or whatever. He got a better treatment that Zoro first got with that tiny knife.</br>  <br>I completely forgot about those two.<br>They will probably go back to their home islands ifthey don't join luffy.</br></br>  <br>it's not like he was careless in the past with that whole seaking incidet stuff, right?</br>  <br> Corazon already has more merchandise and appearances in mobage than any other flashback exclusive character I'm pretty sure <br><br>Fujo strong</br></br></br>  <br>Violet?</br>  <br>Could be a beetle judging by his head. Japan loves beetles.<br><br>Tiger beetle = fastest per size life form traveling the equivalent of 450mph if it was human sized<br><br>Hercules beetle = can lift a 850 times it's body weight about it's head for long periods of times<br><br>Dung Beetle = can move 1100 times it's body weight for long distances<br><br>Iron clad beetle = highest defense lifeform. Can have elephants step on it, is like metal, and take power tools to damage it's shell.<br><br>Just a theory but Oda does like bugs so I assume he'd make something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see anything wrong with that.</br>  <br> Daz wasn't even a swordsman. <br>i mean technically but Mihawk knew his name so I think he counts<br><br>they both got shit on, Zoro just got hit harder</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't the mizu mizu fruit, it was the toro toro fruit. Some vague unnamed liquid but technically not water.</br>  <br>Well, he doesn't have any figures yet.

I don't mind fujo stuff, at least post well drawn ones</br>  <br>MODS</br>  So are any of the Episode specials any good? There's Episode of Nami, Luffy, Merry and the 3D2Y one.

I'm just saying that Daz was no special snowflake. Be glad he didn't get shanked by a pocket knife after Mihawk says "eyo wasup".</br>  Are the 7 warlords done now?<br> <br>Flamingo is essentially the last bad guy on the list. Hawkeye, Buggy etc are basically all friends of Luffy and co.</br></br>  So what happened to Capone after all?  <br>are we even talking about kaido anymore?<br><br>Qilin are associated with kings and have horns and FUR<br><br>that is all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck?

He has no reason to fight Luffy nor does he care if he has to kill him.</br>  <br>Ussops teacher was beetle themed</br>  <br>I think as long as Shanks is alive Mihawk won't kill Luffy. He might fuck him up, but not kill him.</br>  <br>Now your just being biased</br>  <br>He doesn't want to fight Luffy, but Zoro wants to fight him. It's a fight waiting to happen.</br>  <br>Probably. It depends on who the mystery warlord is.<br><br><br>I feel like the only one who doesn't think that's important. Just one of those weird mysteries of the New World.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of the above.

Just like Apoo running off a cliff into the air, its to show how crazy the new world is.</br>  <br>Nah, he said that he was sorry but he had no moral dilemma about trying to kill Luffy.</br>  <br>Yeah, Doffy is generic too.</br>  <br><br>what?

It seems more to be one of these giant temples the guy uses as headquarters or something.  <br>And Jimbei was already an oldfag then. <br><br>I doubt his potential for growth was stronger than Ace's, pre-skip Jimbei on land would probably lose.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this supposed to be Luffy? What the fuck?</br>  <br>No way Zoro could handle that.</br>  <br>I figured it might be something like Sanjuan Wolf or Wadatsumi. Something huge to create some kinda mystery and a threatening atmosphere.</br>  <br> Alvida falls for Coby's dick <br>When indeed?</br></br>  <br>that was pre-wb ace. He probably improved a lot after joining them. <br><br>I doubt Zoro is far from Jinbei.</br></br></br>  <br>I've always believed that Kaidou was a giant, so I'm hoping that's him.</br>  <br>Post TS ? Why not ? He's taken virtually no damage so far except a scratch from Pica. We have nothing to gauge his endurance right now except it obviously is more than before.

Have you not read the one piece story?<br>The Tenryubito who established the shichibukai dont care about civilians.<br>Even NON shichibukai who bribe the Marines are allowed to enslave entire islands without interference (Arlong).<br>The only things a warlord can't do are attack Tenryubito and ignore orders given by them.<br>Shichibukai are WG employees, NOT pirates.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, he's dead forever.</br>  So wouldn't Kidd like Luffy? He was the one who punched the world government dude in the face.  <br>Always happy to serve.</br>  <br>Oh good you ARE trolling. consider me baited no more. shoo, away with you filthy fuji posting troll. shoo</br>   Just like Shanks will soon be   I already miss him.

If anything I can see him being brought before Kaidou to establish K as a real OG before his arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>ha, now the author has to redraw Akainu</br>  <br>Actually, Doflamingo's body was possessed by an evil spirit the moment he found those glasses in Mariejois. The glasses were cursed with the spirit of their former owner, an insane mafia boss, and when Kid Doffy put them on he effectively died (this being why his personality was so fucked up from that point on). <br><br>It's only now that the glasses have finally been broken that Doflamingo's tortured soul can ascend to heaven. It's also why Doflamingo stopped moving after the glasses broke.</br></br></br>  <br>Cipher Pol was only working for Doflamingo because they couldn't kill him.<br>Now that they can just throw him into the sea and be done with the guy that blackmailed them 13 years, I see no reason why they should refrain from doing so.</br></br>  <br>I too enjoy perona.<br> and her anus </br></br>  So Doffy cared for his crew. I guess? We never saw him doing it in action. Sure he was bummed when he realized Vergo/Monet and Law had to die, but we never saw him be a father or older bro or friend to any of these people.<br><br>I realize I'm asking a lot for a weekly shonen thing like this, and what I've gotten is already better than what's usually given, but I want more damn it.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Is burn victim fetish a thing now on tumblr?</br></br></br>  <br>George Lucas you're drunk.

The focal point nstead just becomes about her and her friends. The anime seems like it'll follow that (it's introduced Sylphin and Kirie earlier than in the manga and the ED is completely focused on the four of them)<br><br>she'll still be a faggot to oniichan for a few more episodes but she does mellow out eventually. plus once taihei is allowed to be a unique character instead of just "angry brother who reacts to her bullshit" he's better too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to eb Ebina's ebin bina's.  <br>I swear if I find out that you're lying.</br>  <br><br> manga vs anime adaptations <br>Please stop this bullshit. 90% of the time the anime adaptation is worse. Stop being so fucking angry about pointless shit.<br><br><br>This is true. <br>The manga gets much better when it becomes more about the interactions between the characters rather than the main sibling gags.<br><br> Sylphin a best </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why won't he just kill her?  <br>I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws fucking all my shit up all the time, and it ain’t like I can pop a cap in their ass and not hear about it Thanksgiving time<br><br>-Proposition Joe</br></br></br>  <br>Go home Alex your drunk.<br><br>Mother complex and he's a good oniichan</br></br></br>  Animeonlyfag here. <br><br>Is Ebina mentally retarded?</br></br>  <br>she's from the country so she's kind of a simple hick<br><br>quietly a top tier girl though</br></br></br>  <br>Why?!!!?</br>  Something is seriously wrong when your computer screen is bigger than your TV. <br><br>Also why do nips put the TV and PC on the ground? a 2-3ft high table surely can't hurt.</br></br>  <br>I've only seen the first episode and I haven't read the manga.<br><br>She doesn't seem like a cunt to me at all. Spoiled brat, sure, but not a malicious person. She got mad at her brother not because he didn't buy her sweets, she got mad at him because they didn't get to play video games all day together like he promised.<br><br>That's a clear sign she really likes him and wants to spend time with him.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw the fucking School Days boat reference   I remember reading the manga years ago but dropping it after about 20 chapters because it was the same shit every time - the younger sister is a lazy, spoiled girl who gets her way all the time with no repercussions.<br><br>Watched the first episode and it started well but by the second half it had become the same old boring shit.<br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  <br> TFW you'll never have a sister get mad at you for not living up to a promise to play video games with her all day. </br>  Seems like the perfect /a/ poster.  <br>You basically pegged what Umaru really is. She's honestly a good person deep down and she and her brother care about each other. That gets more apparent over time.<br><br>Most people won't see it that way though, which is unfortunate.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like her the most because being that spoilt is cute.</br>  <br> an anime starts out the same way the manga does <br>wow tell me more</br></br>  I want to fuck her chibi.  <br>A bit, although Kirie and her brother Bomber are too. Or maybe socially retarded is more accurate for them.</br>  <br>It feels like it's trying to be cringe comedy. Like a shittier Watamote. Does a pretty good job making me disgusted with that filthy fucking NEET hamster girl though.<br><br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>Absolutely disgusting. How is she not fat</br></br></br></br>  <br>well her brother has a table, I think she just likes laying on the floor for kicks</br>  <br>Shimoneta was pretty different from how the manga began.<br><br>It was made a shit manga into a good anime when it is usually the reverse.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's fucking stupid. The smugness was the appeal factor for me. Does that mean she'll be in her chibi form for much less/none at all? Guess I'm dropping it.</br>  <br>She's a moeblob for pretty much a majority of the series.</br>  <br>No lies, only best girls<br><br><br>She still uses it a ton and is still lazy in general but isn't just an asshole to her brother. they still do a ton of jokes and shit but it isn't just a one-note gag<br><br>either way she's still going to exploit the brother for a while in the anime until they get through all the characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Dogakobo <br> pick no-name VAs <br> they're fucking perfect <br><br>they can't keep getting away with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're gonna mess up bad one day, but not today.</br>  <br>She didn't eat anything else all day and the cola was probably sugarless</br>  Someone needs to make a .webm of the maracas part in the OP.  <br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>I remember when I could do that, I'd chug entire gallon bottles.<br><br>Now more than half a glass feels like way too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>really easy to eat a bunch of shit when your metabolism is probably at it's peak and you're playing sports constantly</br>  <br>Those absolute madman's how do they do that</br>  <br>there are a couple but none of them loop perfectly like they need to</br>  <br><br>There was two of them in the last thread if it's still up.</br></br>  <br>oops posted a still</br>  What material is the hood made of?    <br><br> little to no lewd of chibi form, let alone normal form </br></br>  <br>Her pubic hair.</br>  <br>Oniichan's tears and sweat.</br>  They did a good job of sticking Kirie in the background of most of the school shots, walking behind/watching Umaru. I didn't even notice her in this scene until I saw it a few times since all my attention was on Sylphin.  <br> That constant blushing at Umaru. </br>  <br>They might spend a large amount of time trying out different VAs, just because they are no-name doesn't mean they are just picked at random.</br>  <br>How can someone that spends her time doing nothing and eating crap get to be so beautiful that everyone blushes at the sight of her?</br>  <br>Kirie in particular is turboyuri</br>  <br>Worst imouto ever. <br><br>It is oniichan's fault for not raising her properly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fantasy, son. Stop looking for logic and enjoy the Himouto hijinks.</br>  <br>she's 16, some teenagers are crazy mutants who maintain perfect bodies no matter how shitty they treat themselves.<br><br>When her mid 20s come around all that junk food and sedentary activity is going to hit her like a ton of bricks.</br></br></br>  This is literally /a/non:The Anime  <br>Anon isn't a skillful and beautiful girl outside of his home though</br>  <br>With an actually girl and not a fat old fuck in a magical girl cosplay.</br>  Hime Imouto or Hiki Imouto?  <br>Himono no imouto</br>  Kirino is like an angel if you comparing to that girl.  <br>Fuck no. Kirino makes Mao Zedong look like an angel in comparison.</br>  <br>dried fish?</br>  <br>As in she fucks like a dried squid.</br>  <br>doesn't kirino hit her "friends" and try to fuck her brother? shes a scumbag to the core, umaru at least actually cares for her friends<br><br><br>yes<br><br>excuse the shitty TN misspellings, Norway scans blow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it's usually Hyperthyroidism, that shit effects girls more than boys.<br><br>You'll notice this when you eat a ton of crap and don't gain any weight whatsoever, producing hormones by the bucketloads. This leads to hyper metabolism which allows you to process any type of food and not gain weight.<br><br>However the downsize to all this, if left untreated a fuck ton of shit happens, hallucinations, heart problems the works. The downside for men, men are very unlikely to get this disease happens in 5 times more in women.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not very cute though.</br>  <br><br>Fuck i meant downside not downsize.</br></br>  <br>Except we are inside. That's the point. /a/ is not disgusting dirty men, but cute lolis. Or at least, that's what some would like to believe.</br>  <br> implying average /a/nons are smart, athletic, beautiful, popular, and a girl </br>  <br>/a/non are known to be the most deluded posters on 4chan, please forgive them.</br>  <br>Actually I take it back,  Liverpool fans are worse .</br>  <br>Kirino doesn't hit her friends and cares very much about them. She does fuck her brother though. <br><br>Both characters mature over time and that's the point. This anime is going to have the exact same problem as Oreimo though because the people these anime attract are retards who can't comprehend a character who isn't strictly static.</br></br></br>  I'm going to buy some cookies with chips so I can try her eating technique it is so simple yet I've never thought to try and utilize it  <br> Dropping Prop Joe quotes in a Himouto thread <br>You're a good dude.</br></br>  <br>More like, retards who call anyone a cunt as soon as they do one thing they don't like.</br>  Based dogakobo does it again.<br><br>This could be my AOTS, i can feel it already.</br></br>  <br>it's actually what every /a/ poster looks like, info 100%<br><br> LPT: using a tripcode reduces your chances of becoming a moeblob </br></br></br>  my uncle's boyfriend told me he read the manga and it later turns into an incest story please tell me that's not true I watch ep 1 and enjoyed it but I will drop this shit if it turns to some sister fucking show  <br><br>We're just living in the moment.</br></br>  <br>Isn't she supposed to be in another class?</br>  <br>Are you saying you wouldn't fuck your sister even if she was a 10?<br> <br>Do you suck dicks too?</br></br></br>   umaruun~   <br>It's a 1DK, they sleep in the same room, their PCs are right next to each other, I bet imouto knows what type of porn he's into.<br><br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Umaru <br> Ebina <br>What's with the caveman names?</br></br></br>  <br>only those who don't have sisters/never lived with a women outside of their mothers are into fucking sisters <br><br>it's a shitty trope in anime tbh</br></br></br>  <br>I have 3 sisters. They are repulsive to me.<br><br>I whack it exclusively to incest doujins.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so. I have a little sister and I fucking love 2D sisters. Especially imoutos.<br> tbh <br>Get the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br> uncle's boyfriend </br>  <br>うまるーん</br>  <br>they're over 100 chapters deep in the manga already and there's been literally 0 sexual tension between umaru and her brother. they just love each other as family<br><br>Kirie and Sylphin want the Umaru vag pretty badly though, and Ebina and Boss are chasing Taihei's dick</br></br></br>  <br> Dude, I hate my sister like really really bad...but I would fuck hsr brains out if it wasn't weird.</br>  <br><br>They really liked the Akkarin~ schtick.</br></br>  <br>Joke's on you, I have both a little sister and an older sister and incest turns me on.  Although I admittedly am a freak, since I occasionally lust for my little sister. </br>    <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>altho I don't understand the squid she was eating how are those things sour? I'm guessing it's not the dried squid snacks and something else entirely<br><br>I'm going to have to look for that next time im at 99 ranch, I wish there were more japanese grocery stories soi I can buy anime snacks tbh</br></br></br>  <br> he's never had a bite of sour/salty/savoury and then a bite sweet <br>Oh anon what were you doing your entire childhood?<br><br><br>Maybe the squid is pickled and dried?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No CalorieMate at my 99 ranch <br> The Daisos just carry a bunch of Pocky/chocolate <br> Most asian stores in my area are either for Koreans or Chinese, so other Jap snacks are mostly a nonexistant <br>Well, at least I can get some boba</br></br></br></br>  How do you deal with a little shit like Umaru?    <br>With a very good dicking.</br>  <br>The same way you deal with a shithead yukkuri.</br>  I'm reading the manga and I don't understand what happens in chapter 57. What's the connection between Bomber eating ramen and his absence?<br>http://bato.to/read/_/246134/himout<wbr>o-umaru-chan_ch57_by_norway-scan/6</wbr></br>  <br>Shower her with lots of love</br>    <br>She needs professional help she's 16 and still acts like she's 5 plus I think she has multiple personality disorder or is a master sociopath either way she is dangerous and needs to be stopped</br>   people on this board claiming that Umaru is /a/ when she is successful, beautiful, popular, and athletic <br><br> claiming any character in this series could be /a/ when Alex exists <br><br>if anyone is 4chan, it's him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dote on her and spoil her because she's a cute<br><br>alternatively, tell her to stop hiding herself behind multiple identities and be real with her friends for once in her life, so she has to face her actual problems</br></br></br>  <br><br>tech her responsibilty by impregnating her five or so times</br></br>  <br>the only /a/ part is when she was snacking/watching anime all day, although truth be honest I don't think most of /a/ watches all that much anime</br>  <br> Implying the people saying that aren't animeonly-fags. <br>Come on, nigga, just ignore.</br></br>  <br>Taihei got him addicted to cup ramen which has no nutrition whatsoever, so he got sick and missed the exams</br>  <br>That looks painful.</br>  animeonlyfag here<br><br>how long until her friends find out about umaru at home?</br></br>   Being so lazy and inactive you forget what day of the week it is. <br><br>This happens way too often to me.</br></br>  <br>Oh ok, thanks.</br>  <br>that part is unrealistic because she goes to school it happens to me all the time too but work from home and have no real deadlines so I often get the days blurred together <br><br>it's like summer time when you are a kid</br></br></br>  <br>them ebinas</br>  <br> he never went to school and thought it was Friday when it was still Thursday or some shit </br>  <br><br><br>This. I remember forgetting which day it was all the time when I went to school. Sometimes it would be like Monday, but I felt like it was Wednesday, or Wednesday, but it felt like Monday.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno maybe very rarely it has happened to me but with school homework deadlines it's hard to not keep track unless you were a bad student</br></br>  <br>We were all lazy geniuses in school so homework wasn't a bother to complete.</br>  <br>It's hard not to keep track even if you're a bad student, because you have a subconscious timer ticking away in your head counting down the days to the weekend.<br><br>Unless a person is so apathetic that school day or weekend is all the same to them.</br></br></br>  <br>This. I was apathetic to school as fuck. Grades were easy. Teachers were lax. I had a great time not paying attention to school.</br>  Dogakobo did fucking splendidly with the material here. Impressive, as usual.  <br/>  <br> nobody knows you're actually umaru-chan when you shitpost </br>  <br> that poster that just called you a cuck is actually a beautiful woman who is too autistic to talk to her friends at school about her actual interests <br>weird feel</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there's some of her chibi form on pixiv.</br>  I fucking hate this little shit what the hell's wrong with you guys<br><br> Why can't I stop watching? </br></br>    I feel bad for Sylphy ;_;  <br><br>I couldn't stop thinking about this scene when I was at work today. I immediately re-watched that part when I got home. It's just too good.</br></br>  This is some big bang theory level shit. Dropped.  <br>Umaru's slovenly habits are basically reality for a lot of otaku, unlike BBT's half assed "such a nerd"s.</br>    <br>it's a kind of magic</br>  <br> shitposters are actually cute girls </br>  <br><br>Do you have the slow-mo jump to the bed? <br><br>Weird how the tantrum scene ended up looking in the episode. It looked different in the PV.</br></br></br></br>   CR translates "bijin" as "hot" <br>Please. This isn't an incest anime.</br>  <br>CR's subs were rushed as fuck. They translated 木曜 as Tuesday.</br>    <br>I would fart in her face while she is trapped in the blanket, that would stop her tantrum.</br>  <br><br>Thank you.</br></br>   Caring for a woman you can never possibly dick. <br>It's like paying the fucking tax. Why does he endure her shit? Because she's cute? Makes me mad.</br>  <br>Because she looks like his mother?</br>  U.M.R.-san confirmed for /sp/ poster  <br>Holy cow, blue is fuckable. She kind reminds of Erika.</br>  <br>OPOTS</br>  Doesn't she get fat all her junk food  It certainly can't be healthy.  <br>The Sylphin arcs are the best so far<br><br>Kirie arcs are fine too</br></br></br>  Do JP really put electronics right on the floor like that?  <br>They make me feel bad for Sylphy ì. I know it's supposed to be a comedy but with all this stories about her being unable to beat Umaru I just want to hug her</br>  <br>Here we go!<br><br>Finally found a webm conversion GUI that's really good.</br></br></br>  this show is shit  <br>Yeah she's so moe. <br><br>This bit got me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've seen it and it's fucking disgusting.</br></br>  <br>I woudn't put it past those banzukudomo butayaroume</br>  <br>How is it disgusting?</br>  tournament arc when? <br>tennis/soccer match when??<br>metal nyancos episode soon??</br></br>  <br> Sylphy is basically Vegeta <br>Fuck.</br></br>  So when does Onii-chan  die ?  <br> when he dies of old age while being taken of by his imouto and sister-in-law, Kirie </br>  <br><br>And here they translated "are" as "curry".<br> professional subs </br></br></br>  <br>the op is fucking great, umaru's VA is really good too.</br>  <br> Umaru <br> Taking care of anything </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127844222 <br>She would probably act all uninterested while one fucked her.<br><br>I want this.</br></br></br>  <br> emotionless_sex </br>  <br><br>Sylphyn is literally perfection</br></br>  <br>She'll be helping by being cute.</br>  <br>Well, for starters it's in the goddamn floor, then there's the fact that sitting like that it's bad for your back, unless you lay on your stomach which is just plain disgusting unless you are a fucking pet, in which case you might as well eat from the floor as well.</br>   not waiting for lyger   <br>I've seen it a few times, but I've also seen it here in the West.</br>  <br>While reading the manga, I kept going between Sylphyn and Kirie as best girl, but especially with some of her more recent chapters I am certain Sylphyn is best girl.  Although all girls are best girls. </br>  Why is the OP so addicting to listen to?<br><br>It's so dumb and silly but god damn it's so fucking fun.</br></br>  <br> &gt;not waiting for lyger <br>when we get to see her play with U.M.R</br></br>  I forgot how selfish and annoying this cunt was at the beginning of the manga.  <br><br>I really want to know how many chapters they gonna adapt</br></br>  <br><br>Not soon enough, Hyper Sylphy best Sylphy</br></br>  Alright real talk here, how's the yuri here? Or are they all paired with their bros?  <br>Fuck off back to /u/.</br>  <br><br> Yuri <br><br>Like Love Lab</br></br></br></br>  <br>Umaru x Kirie is the only OTP.</br>  <br>Who was Kirie again?</br>  <br><br>Anon pls</br></br>  <br>I can't wait for more TSF hanging out with UMR<br><br><br> real talk  <br>What the fuck?<br>And there's no incest or yuri themes. It's about platonic sibling love and friendship. <br><br><br>It's Alex x Kirie nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The autistic Bomber's imouto</br></br>    <br>there is no yuri you stupid fucking nigger.</br>  <br>I expect the anime to change this.</br>    <br><br>Right, like Love Lab?</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, was for this fag </br></br>  Bomber x onii-chan when  <br>Because NORWAY.</br>  <br>Kirie is kind of lesbian but that's it. Even she is getting pushed with another onii-chan.</br>  <br><br> Not Ebina's onii-chan x Onii-chan <br><br>pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea who's Kirie (I guess a character not introduced yet?) but that'll be enough for me, thanks</br>  <br>Midget with dark hair. In episode 1 she was the swimmer with a deep voice.</br>  <br>the one who stalk umaru all the time during the episode 01</br>  Are Sylphyn and Alex gaijin? Or at least half?<br>Those names, man.</br>   HIMOUTO <br><br>What does the H stand for?</br></br>  <br>Ecchi sketchy.</br>  <br>Hubris.</br>  <br>One touchy.</br>  <br>I'm not a selfish little shit. So, no.</br>  <br> Sound's like a spin-off to 100% OJ </br>  <br>There's no romance, it's all pure platonic/sibling love.</br>  Being a selfish shit is a realistic depiction of an imouto.<br><br>People with 3D imoutos know.</br></br>  <br>What are you implying here? There really was no yuri in Love Lab.</br>  <br> Not seeing the yuri undertones. </br>  <br>I actually have my PC like this.</br>  <br>homo</br>  <br>Thank god I have a nee-san.</br>  <br> implying there is any yuri at all </br>  <br>cant expect hetfags to be rational</br>  <br>Exactly<br><br><br>You need goggles to see past the obvious platonic friendship themes this gag manga has.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does she look like :&lt;</br>  <br><br>Why did people think it was a short? It was announced as a full lenght anime. Nichijou's manga had the same format and they made a full lenght anime out of it. Nozaki-kun was a 4-koma and they made a full lenght anime out of it. It's not THAT weird to see short manga turned into regular anime</br></br>  <br>You barbarian.</br>  <br>They don't Kirie thinks hangs out with her at home, but she thinks she's her little sister, not umaru</br>  <br>who a best <br> otaku hamster <br> otaku idol </br></br></br>  Pig  I want to expose Umaru's lazy otaku life-style to the world and make her cry while everybody begins spreading nasty rumors about her.    <br>As if Kirie, Sylphin and Ebina won't still be her friends.<br><br>Also her oniichan is there too.</br></br></br>  I want to she her in her 20's when her metabolism catches up with her and she is overweight and has bad skin and considering suicide    うまる～ん  <br> that dog <br> his head <br><br>is he going to be okay?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice bitrate.</br>    <br>Because you can never tell the future?</br>  Are the hamster alive or just fake? they way they are drawn leads me to think they are toys that she is pretending to be real    I like the slow part of the OP best (after the game references).

I almost want to make the gamble and order a physical one.<br>Any idea if those posters that comes on the physical ones get a digital version in bookwalker?<br><br>Base version has 441 pages and 2014 edition has 419, check again, that's why I asked.</br></br></br></br>  四万八千日<br>48,000 Days<br><br>目的が終わってしまったな…<br>Looks like we alright accomplished our goal...<br>屋台もたくさん出てるし色々見て回ろうよ<br>There are a lot of stalls around, so let's take a look!<br>風鈴を選ぶのもいいな…<br>Might be nice to pick out a wind charm, too...<br>パンフレットもらってきたよー<br>I got a pamphlet!<br><br>ほおずき市は四万八千日の縁日にちなんで開かれ…<br>Looks like the Lantern Fair leads right into the 48,000 Days Fair the next day.<br>四万八千日ってなんだ？<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127838259#p127849435">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oagariyo!  <br>I know that he is Shino's young version but Souma's hair here is exactly the same of Shino's</br>  <br>I expect we'll see some shifts in subsequent days.

It's more about where Alice, Ryou, and Hayama will end up by the end after they recover.<br><br>And the main focus is of course the central area with Souma vs Yugi.<br><br>We'll likely see some shifts in the uptown area as well though. I wouldn't be surprised if Tsukasa moves up a lot. By the same token though I wouldn't be surprised if his gloominess is what's making him under-perform and he keeps doing it instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  who is the most physically attractive male in the shokugeki universe barring shinomiya<br><br>I think it has to be dojima</br></br>  <br>Jouichirou and Senzaemon.<br>Dojima is not even close.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, with al his meekness he must suck at advertising his booth.<br>I bet he loses a lot of clients by stuttering outside of his place while trying to attract customers.</br></br></blockquote>]
