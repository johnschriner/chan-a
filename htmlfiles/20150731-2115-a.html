[ Just watched this. <br>It began relatively well, better than I expected, but then it turned to absolute shit in its second half. It's a shame, it almost managed not to be bad. <br><br>Why can't any Dragon Ball production be good anymore ? Everything produced in the last few years has been awful : OVAs, movies, and the new anime series. <br><br>Couldn't they just let Dragon Ball rest in peace ?</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it better or worse than Battle of the Gods?  <br>is this real life?</br>  The whole deal about the revival of Freezer was retarded as fuck. They should've just used a brand new enemy instead of reusing freezer and use a bullshit reason to explain why he went from being the weakest Z final boss to being super powerful in just 4 months  Better question, do you support the frieza force initiative?  <br>Better. Beerus and Whis are only side characters, the villains seem actualy threatening for a moment, and it has some good moments. Piccolo, Krillin, Ten-Shin-Han, Gohan and fucking Master Roshi fighting a thousand-man strong army of mooks was awesome. It has a good Goku vs Freeza moment.<br><br>Then all goes to shit when Goku turns into Super Saiyan God and Frieza turns golden. From here, it's one annoying twist after another. Also Vegeta keeps getting shit upon by the writers. <br><br><br>Yes. A laser rifle actually defeated Goku. In Super Saiyan God form, no less.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lasers always hurt DB characters.<br><br>Like King Piccolo hurting kid Goku with his laser eyes, something that regular Piccolo uses too <br><br>Then Super Perfect Cell injured Gohan with a laser attack too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> baiting that hard <br><br>Sure everyone just forget that Krilin in cell saga damaged goku just by throwing little rock on his head because with guard down he can be killed like normal human</br></br></br></br>  <br> baiting <br>Actually, this is one of the few threads that picture is relevant. I normally use it to troll the Superman V Goku threads on /co/.</br></br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about, that is filler anime for giggle,</br>  <br>Where did you watch it? Are you talking about a screencap or did you watch it in quality? I don't know what the fuck is taking so long for a high quality release.</br>  <br> OVAs, movies, and the new anime series. <br>The 2008 special and BoG was great though you pleb<br><br>There is nothing wrong with Super either</br></br></br></br>    <br> kid goku has not reaching super saiyan and each enemy is on par to them making a damage to goku. Those thing is not even a small riffle.</br>  <br>Remember at BoG when SSJ 1 vegeta said to be surpassing Goku at SSJ 3. That shit that said to be canon make me laugh.</br>  <br>I found it on nyaatorrents.<br>Camrip, in spanish, and with subtitles from people who clearly don't speak english very well. <br>It was quite an experience in itself.</br></br></br>  <br> nothing wrong with Super either <br>Yeah, apart from the really lazy shit animation, rehashed plot, and questionable pacing.</br></br>  <br>Haven't they only released 3 episodes of it?</br>  <br>Yes. Three episodes of boring filler-level slice of life.</br>  <br>How can BoG is good because it's a huge chunk of inconsistency. watching it make someone puking because of confusement. Only 1 wish shenron, SSJ 1 vegeta said to be stronger than SSJ 3 Goku, bulma's age, Goku can breath on space, dinosour extinction, etc .</br>  <br>Yeah, the animation is shoddy as fuck, and the preview for 4 looked even worse. That's not something that's going to get better. The show so far has been a rehash of KtK, with nothing significant added, and based on the OP it looks like they'll be doing FnF, too.<br><br><br>Try not being autistic. It's a cartoon. It's meant to be fun and enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So you dislike Super because it retcons the in-universe power levels and consistency? Toriyama probably got sick of people saying Superman can defeat all his characters, hence why he made Beerus so unbelievably strong in the very first episode.</br>  <br>Try to be not an idiot and try to use your brain for once.</br>  <br> How can BoG is good because it's a huge chunk of inconsistency. <br> watching it make someone puking because of confusement <br>and I'm the one not using my brain?</br></br></br>  <br>No, he destroy the setting that he created. he makes it non canon as possible. He even forget the ruling how shenron granting wishes and a lot other. This is more like a doujinshi than dragonball comic.</br>  <br>Yes because you are an idiot for not noticing the contradictions.</br>  <br>Tell me how vegeta at SSJ 1 said to be surpassing Goku at SSJ 3? Let alone a lot more to say about other consistency.</br>  <br>I take it Spanish is your first language?<br><br><br> power levels <br>It doesn't fucking matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I take it sign language is your first language?</br>  <br>Beerus and Whis are one the best additions to the BD universe in a decade, the freshest take on a "villain", their interaction are the most fun to watch and they are the most fleshed out and promising side characters in general.<br><br><br>BoG is a much more enjoyable and just a plain better movie. Maybe because it's so different from your usual DBZ movie. It has better structure, script, direction and is plain more enjoyable to watch as a character treat. RoF is just an amalgamation of basically any other DBZ movie except for the fact that it's a bit longer. <br><br><br>Power levels are a relative thing, dumbass. If a fighter is stronger at the base level their transformations will be stronger too. SSJ Goku during Buu saga would be much stronger than SSJ Goku fighting Frieza. The Vegeta you're talking about is yet another case though, in DB in a fit of rage anyone can be temporarily much stronger than they ought to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Power levels are a relative thing, dumbass.

Super saiyan is more of controlling emotion than letting his rage went wild. The effect should have given negative effect than good effect. Do you even know about dragonball?</br></br></br>  <br>OK but has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?</br>  <br>Your rage gives me life, the more power levels are going to get shat on in Super the more I'm going to enjoy it. The more the unassuming characters defeat Goku, the more joy it'll bring me. It's about time we put retarded discussions about who is allowed to kick whose ass because of some bullshit number assigned to their strength aside.<br>Really the only thing I ask of Super is keeping Whis and Beerus the strongest from start to finish, that's all I'm asking of Toriyama. There needs to be some kind of roofing over this powering up thing before it becomes redundant beyond repair.</br></br>  <br>Wat?</br>  <br>Learn english on a communicative level before you come to an english speaking board and try to argue abstract ideas you aren't even able to phrase.</br>  <br> Then all goes to shit when Goku turns into Super Saiyan God and Frieza turns golden. From here, it's one annoying twist after another. Also Vegeta keeps getting shit upon by the writers. <br>Well, this movie was actually completely scripted by Toriyama, and he never liked Vegeta. BoGs had the story heavily modified by Toriyama, but the script writer was someone else, who is even a self proclaimed Vegeta fan, which is why he gets that scene where he does better against Beerus than anyone else besides SSJGod Goku.</br></br>  <br> Your rage gives me life <br>Only 1 wish shenron, SSJ 1 vegeta said to be stronger than SSJ 3 Goku, bulma's age, Goku can breath on space, dinosour extinction, And the story about Shenron fucked up a wish All of this shit is impossible to happen.<br><br>This shit is doujinshi at very best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That because you're not even understand DBZ. Less newfag like you the better.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, that scene was anime only. It makes sense though since they clearly establish here that their resistance and strength is entirely due to ki, and call out Goku specifically as relaxing too much at times and dropping his defenses.<br><br>It never happened before in the manga to that level, but it doesn't really contradict anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shenron simply fucked off because he was afraid of Beerus, he filled one wish and he's allowed to leave if nobody makes another wish for some period of time (according to Toriyama) here's your answer. Did you NOT get it from the context of the scene? How can you bitch about inconsistencies when you aren't even able to read the fusking moment?</br>  <br>It contradict that goku is immune of bullet. he even confused when someone shot him, he felt nothing and confuse about the bullet and the gun.</br>  <br> It contradict that goku is immune of bullet. <br>That wasn't a bullet from a standard earth gun though, it was a laser from the substitute leader of Freeza's army. I don't see how being strong enough to take a bullet means laser immunity.</br></br>  <br>Shenron cannot be dismissed before granting the wish in ANY WAY OF POSSIBLE. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DISMISS OF SHENRON IF YOU SAID YOU HAVE WISHED ENOUGH AND THANKED HIM AND ORDER SHENRON TO DISMISS. THIS IS OBVIOUS AS FUCK.</br>  <br>When did Shenron do more than one wish? I honestly dropped the manga during the Piccolo arc.</br>  <br>Continuity in Dragonball was never that big. Get the fuck over it. Some human on earth made androids stronger than Freeza. This shit never made sense.</br>  <br>remember that goku that immune of bullet is at first volume or kid goku but not goku at SSJ above level not even a God level.</br>  <br>When Dende upgrades it at the end of the Cell Saga, it becomes able to grant two wishes. They even bring up the 2nd wish in RoF.<br><br>I think the official explanation for the 2nd wish in BoG's is that Pillaf for some reason only made a single wish when gathering the Dragonballs for the first time, which is why they returned less than one year later in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br> headcanon <br>nope, if nobody says their wish shenron will leave, he asked if anybody has another wish and nobody said yes, thus he left. It's a Toriyama made rule, also, this was a comedic moment for shenron, he was scared of Beerus. It's comedy, you know, it's funny.</br></br>  <br>No read your shit AND STOP READING DRAGONBALL HEROES OR DRAGONBALL DOUJINSHI RELATED! THAT SHIT IS NON CANON!</br>  <br> Yeah, the animation is shoddy as fuck, and the preview for 4 looked even worse. That's not something that's going to get better.  <br>Dragon Ball has never been a paragon of animation and its Toei.<br><br>It has been consistent though. This may not be Toei at their top but it's not them at their worst either.<br><br> The show so far has been a rehash of KtK, with nothing significant added, and based on the OP it looks like they'll be doing FnF, too. <br>First of all, nobody calls the show Kami to Kami unless you're Japanese. It was even called Battle of Gods over there. Second of all, we know the story will retell the movies but they are going to go into new material. <br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How are you actually getting this mad right now over Dragon Ball?</br>  <br><br>But this movie establishes that most of the extra power and resistance he has gained would be purely ki based. That was always a possibility considering everything in the manga, this movie just confirmed it. His skin isn't magically getting stronger. He just gets more ki which he uses to raise his defense, yet during that moment he let his guard down and so got pierced through.<br><br>Obviously the scale is different, but look at his battle with Piccolo. Piccolo releases a large energy blast with all of his power that fails to do any damage to Goku who's bracing for it, and, yet, afterwards, when Piccolo is heavily beat down, he pierces Goku with a single blast just because he wasn't paying attention. It's clear that it wasn't just a matter of Goku's skin being though enough to take the 1st blast, otherwise the 2nd would have been completely useless.<br><br>Also, Goku wasn't "immune" to bullets in the beginning. It didn't pierce his skin but still hurt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama had never taken the setting of DB as radical as you or others make it out to be. To say he's destroying his setting is just you getting unnecessarily angry.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128809523 <br>Se he spked THAT HE SAID 'ALREADY ENOUGH' AND INDIRECTLY TOLD HIM TO DISMISS. He cannot leave without order. Shenron is not an idiot. There is reason he never fucked up a wish even just fucking ONCE.</br>  <br>Lel you delete your own post because it proves my point.</br>  <br>Why not? The newfaggotry is sometime trigger me.<br><br><br>No, He doesn't felt hurt he even not said something about being hurt eventhough he is shotted at less than 5 M range. Goku is thrown by a rock under SSJ 1 eventhough it's not strong throw but felt a pain.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He clearly felt the bullet and yelled in pain. It just failed to pierce his skin.</br></br>  <br><br>Why can't you niggers accept that 80% of dragonball is just for fun.<br>The remaining 20% is filler.</br></br></br>  <br>just laugh at the angry sperg</br>  <br>I laugh at your stupidity for deleting your own post because it support my claim.</br>  <br>There is a scene where he got shotted by Red ribbon and he felt nothing but i forget where i get it. Prolly latter.</br>  <br> 8 days for my most likely viewing <br>Fuck. I have to find someone who will go with me. <br><br>Debating whether to tell them to watch BoG first. On one hand, the fun shit will turn them off. RoF seems a little more like the pleb tier DBZ they would enjoy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean this? It's a sniper, rather than a handgun, but he seems to take the hit in a similar way.</br>  <br>I agree, it's not so much 'felt nothing' but 'working through the pain'.<br><br>DBZ characters are so OP I didn't even think about gun in universe...</br></br></br>  <br>Not this one, it's not a sniper gun. Probably latter i will search it again.</br>  <br> boring filler-level slice of life. <br>NO. Get out, GET THE FUCK OUT. It's been seventeen years since DB last aired on television with a new series. SEVENTEEN. And after all these years mere three episodes of characters doing their character stuff which allows people to catch up, get familiar again bore you? Fuck off! Go play a DB video game or something if all you care about is pew pew pew.</br></br>  Are we getting Resurrection of C?  Whis and his bullshit time rewind power ruined the movie. Earth blowing up could have been a lesson for Goku to stop being a pansy and finishing his fights, but nooooo.<br><br>Also, Vegeta turning into a Super Saiyan God was bullshit. He didn't deserve the power-up</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, if anything it was Vegeta who deserved the kill, not Goku. It's hilarious, how they turn back the time to kill Frieza before he sneak-destroys Earth, and actually take MORE time to deliver the blow than Vegeta would have, had he been allowed to continue. Vegeta fought seriously, with no boasting and bullshitting, and he deserved that kill.<br><br> He didn't deserve the power-up <br>Why? For being the hardest-training Sayan he doesn't deserve a transformation? Yeah fuck you.</br></br></br></br>   movie is garbage compared to BoG <br> still going to watch it anyways <br> still going to buy it when it comes out on DVD <br> tfw I'm going to continue this cycle forever <br>Dragon Ball is my crack-cocaine and hardly anything will keep me from wanting more.<br>I even started watching Super, and that dropped the slice-of-life stuff real quickly to rehash BoG and RoF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why? <br>Because he's a manlet</br></br>  <br> That's all I'm asking of Toriyama <br>Sadly, there's still the possibility that Toei fucks up introducing new characters not present in Toriyama's original plot.<br>Hell, they could even bring back  Broly  if they wanted to.</br></br></br>  DBZ in general is just as bad as Naruto  everyone here is such a faggot Battle of Gods is a 10/10 movie  <br>And?</br>  <br>Does Naruto takes itself seriously? If yes, then DBZ is better, if no then they're on the same level.</br>  <br>It would have been better with Cell as the bad guy tbh.</br>  <br>Cell isn't nearly as iconic, he also wasn't as much of an asshole as Frieza so his punishment wouldn't feel as rewarding.</br>  <br> On one hand, the fun shit will turn them off. RoF seems a little more like the pleb tier DBZ they would enjoy. <br>FnF is full of fun scenes. It's not a serious movie at all</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking fool.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying that the fact that we know its a rehash, but will stop being so eventually makes DBS as it exists now any less lazy? <br><br>And really this is pretty close to Toei's worst in animation terms. A significant segment of the second episode was a fucking slideshow.<br><br>I never said I disliked Super, but to say there's nothing wrong is really stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes. thats exactly what is implied. they are adding some much extra stuff to this 're-has' it might as well be its own story</br>  <br>They really haven't added anything terribly significant up to this point.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with enjoying DBS. I've been enjoying it myself, but I'm not going to pretend like it isn't super lazy on Toei's part.</br></br></br>  <br>cooler is not canon</br>  God dammit Toriyama.  <br> Piccolo, Krillin, Ten-Shin-Han, Gohan and fucking Master Roshi fighting a thousand-man strong army <br>Was Yamcha really not there ?<br><br>Is Yamcha really weaker than fucking Roshi now ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This, Krillin was also able to almost kill Vegeta with one blow because Vegeta let himself get hit. Chi probably works the same way as nen in that regard</br>  <br>Even worse that he died at the end anyway.<br><br>Seems like they only brought him back as marketing gimmick</br></br></br>  <br> The movie is complete bullshit with respect to the power level shit. Roshi's there but not Yamcha? Krillin's there but not 18? Godku gets killed with a tiny laser gun! What can you say? Toriyama gonna Toriyama.</br>  <br> Gohan--perpetual joke <br>Toriyama's other hobbies include kicking puppies and creating mix tapes from the recorded sounds of sobbing children.</br></br>  <br>DBZ and Naruto are not so bad, they did their cycle and ended.<br>One Piece and Bleach, on the other hand...</br></br>  <br>You mean it's even WORSE than BoG?</br>   Gohan is even more of a joke, with a stupid hair cut and being so out of it he doesn't even have a gi anymore and has to settle for going super saiyan <br><br> is also the most effective he's been since the Cell Games <br><br>I can't figure out if things are getting better or worse for him</br></br></br></br>  <br>On the bright side, Gohan is definitely gonna start training for the Universe 6 arc after that.</br>  <br>Where did all his muscles go? I was actually shocked when I saw him with his t-shirt.</br>  <br><br><br> That made perfect sense to me. Remember in the cell saga when kirlin hurt goku with a rock? <br> It was best explained on this one-shot, because I don't know about your english dub or sub, but here it is said much more clearly. Goku's body is more or less normal unless he actually uses his ki to strengthen himself.<br><br> I liked the flick, by the way. I can understand why some people might not like it, but I completely disagree.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You say that and yet both of them have a new series after a time skip. All the characters seem flat. Bleach is at least on its last arc, and idk what you have against One Piece.</br>  <br>Didn't Vegeta also lower his guard so Krillin could hurt him back in the Frieza arc?</br>  <br>How many times she you posted this. <br><br>The image is pixelated to hell</br></br></br>  <br>it's a troll image, the pixels just induce more rage.</br>  I loved this movie <br><br><br>I just did.</br></br></br>  <br> It was a nice movie anon, and old fans had quite a few hippe moments. Don't mind people that don't get they are a bit too old to be the target demographic, enjoy stuff for what it is.</br>  <br><br>Had a shit climax though.</br></br>  <br><br> What did you want? For Vegeta to just kill Freeza without any resistance? <br> At the end they made truth of the warning Weiss, or however that's spelled, gave Goku, it had Vegeta step up and show he was up there on power too, and didn't have the fight end anticlimactically by having Vegeta just steamroll over a now powerless Freezypop.<br> <br>It's a matter of opinions, really, but it's was not an objectively bad ending. You might have had another thing in your mind, and of course they can't please everybody.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the game was ok</br>  <br> People acting like something was stolen from Gohan <br>Fucking stop already, him being the MC was Cell saga only, he never trained on his own, he always preferred books than training, he was a pussy faggot crybaby from day one and was forced to become a man, it took fucking years for hi to stop being crybaby. <br><br>Gohan was always a fucking nerd, he doesn't train, he doesn't care for training and never has. He became the strongest yet never did anything to stay like that because he never fucking wanted to be the strongest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>gohan was a really admirable if not outright hero since it went so far against his nature. He probably could have been one of the world's greatest minds if his father hadn't forced him to train so much as a child / young adult.</br>  <br>if not outright tragic*</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be interesting if they reversed the order of fights between Goku and Vegeta so that Vegeta fought first and he were the one to deliver the final blow? Dunno if movies do that often but this one did the unusual, it actually had Goku kill his opponent.</br>  <br> Wouldn't it be interesting if they reversed the order of fights between Goku and Vegeta so that Vegeta fought first and he were the one to deliver the final blow? <br>Isn't that the normal order? If think it fine that way. I am also slightly confused by your post. It reads as if you changed opinion midway. <br> Just in case you really weren't certain, Goku almost never kills the opponents himself. Piccolo 1.0, Buu, and now Frizza are the only exceptions.</br></br></br>  <br>Goku killed a fuckton of people when he was a kid.</br>  <br>That was pretty shit. I mean, Gohan is a jobber, he never trains and actually is weaker than before, but is still far superior to the others, even though they keep training (at least piccolo and tien, probably)<br>Not to mention that Frieza got much much stronger than Buu in no time, when Buu was supposed to be the strongest non-god in the universe and it took bullshit powerups and fusions to get to that level. If we go by power level multipliers and that kind of crap, the "golden" transformation power multiplier is greater than the god super, since base goku was stronger than final frieza, but golden was stronger than SSGSS and that also seems like bullshit.<br>All that I could let slide, I was really enjoying the movie. But that fucking ending was just terrible. Not only Frieza can blow up the planet quickly just by touching it, Whis DeusExMachina-ly can reverse time just enough to let Goku (who by the way didn't seem to care for the death of his wife and son) be the hero again</br></br></br>  <br>In case that's where the confusion lies, I wasn't saying it'd be interesting to see Goku kill Frieza, I thought it'd be interesting to reverse the usual order of things that Goku always arrives to a fight last and shift the kill to Vegeta.<br><br><br>That's true but at some point of the series Goku stops killing his opponents, he spares Vegeta, Ginyu Squad, Frieza, doesn't get to kill Cell ect. The only boss he killed was a devoid of humanity and reason Kid Buu. Even though his reasons aren't completely altruistic, he's just not allowed to kill anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what's wrong with this, that laser rifle could have came from Penguin Village. We all know absolutely nothing in DB can match Arale.</br>  <br> If we go by power level multipliers and that kind of crap <br>Better not, against popular opinion there's no such thing as "transformation multiplier". Toriyama literally made it up on the fly and when he realised that according to what he's written SSJ would be just as strong as Oozaru he just pulled out another number right out of his ass. There are no real, official power level stats of any of the transformations. Anything goes really.</br></br>  If in Super Vegeta is in CC and not on the cruise ship, how will Beerus and Whis get to the party and get in a fight with Buu if their target is Vegeta? How's the shit supposed to go down in that scenario?  <br>Goku stops killing altogether after his training with Kami</br>  <br> be the hero again <br><br>Nothing about the ending of 'Revival of F' makes Goku anything close to a hero.<br><br>It was literally Goku getting a second chance to fix both his and Vegeta's fuck ups, which was the lesson Whis was teaching them, along with their usual Saiyan pride bullshit being the core to all their problems. <br><br>You would think fans would stop giving a shit about kill counts after the ending of the Buu Saga, where it was entirely because of Mr. Satan's influence that everyone came together and finished Majin Buu off, but no.<br><br>This stupid obsession of judging a character's worth by his victories if fucking stupid and is something I only see Bleachfags give a shit about.<br><br>That your viewing of the film is soured because 'Vegeta didn't get the kill' is the kind of cancerous mindset that makes Bleach fanfags so fucking stupid.<br><br>It's especially damning, when it comes to Dragon Ball, because the people obsessing only on kill counts completely disregard all love Vegeta has got/been getting since Toriyama has gotten involved in the series again.<br><br>The fact alone that Vegeta not only gets the same special training and new forms that Goku has, without someone pulling some shit out of his ass, is a blessing in itself, on top of not only saving Goku's ass, but beating the shit out of Freeza. That's a hell of a lot more than Gohan, Piccolo or Tenshinhan has gotten lately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just let it happen anon</br>  <br>No, it's obvious by upgrade in another level of ssj the difference of power is steep that can reverse the advantage of power by wide margin. It's more of ruling in db because both opponent and heroes needs transformation to become more OP than the other. The dragonball is always identic with transformation to reverse the disadvantage by180° and make the hero that is dying look like 'untouchable' against that same opponent.</br>  <br> This stupid obsession of judging a character's worth by his victories if fucking stupid and is something I only see Bleachfags give a shit about. <br>  <br> That your viewing of the film is soured because 'Vegeta didn't get the kill' is the kind of cancerous mindset that makes Bleach fanfags so fucking stupid. <br><br>It's pretty damn pathetic how people were swearing up and down that RoF was totally going to be the film where Vegeta was going to be the sole hero, despite Akira Toriyama not only implies this. <br><br>That these retards kept parroting this shit all the way until the films Japanese release made their tears when it didn't happen, oh-so delicious. <br><br>The funniest part is that there are still faggots who legitimately feel that Akira Toriyama 'owes' Vegeta anything, despite Toriyama has consistently been pandering to this selfish fucks.<br><br>I expect that master to dash the Gohan fans dreams as well during Super, since they seem to never shut up about how Goku stole his spotlight, in spite of this never once being the case.<br><br>Alternatively, in true 'Monkey Paw' fashion, I fully expect all those obsessed Tenshinhan fans that have been constantly whining about how Tenshinhan should be stronger than Kuririn, despite Toriyama confirming the opposite to get their feelings hurt during Dragon Ball Super's, when Toriyama grants their wish by having Goku, Piccolo, Roshi or a secondary party confirm that Kuririn is stronger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;It's pretty damn pathetic how people were swearing up and down that RoF was totally going to be the film where Vegeta was going to be the sole hero, despite Akira Toriyama not only implies this.  <br>  <br> That these retards kept parroting this shit all the way until the films Japanese release made their tears when it didn't happen, oh-so delicious.  <br>  <br> The funniest part is that there are still faggots who legitimately feel that Akira Toriyama 'owes' Vegeta anything, despite Toriyama has consistently been pandering to this selfish fucks. <br>  <br> I expect that master to dash the Gohan fans dreams as well during Super, since they seem to never shut up about how Goku stole his spotlight, in spite of this never once being the case. <br><br> Vegetafags <br>Not even once.<br><br>The only shitters worse are those retarded Gohanfags who project their daddy issues onto Goku's and Gohan's relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Dunno if movies do that often but this one did the unusual, it actually had Goku kill his opponent. <br><br>Ha, in the movies Goku kills EVERYONE</br></br></br>  <br>How's the movie since BoG not pandering to vegetafags. He can surpassed goku combat prowess at ssj 3 when he was only at ssj 1 in lunatic reasoning. You can see how ridiculous it's considering increasing 1 level of ssj is very hard and the difference is steep.</br>  <br> The only shitters worse are those retarded Gohanfags who project their daddy issues onto Goku's and Gohan's relationship. <br><br>I hate this more than anything.<br><br> haha Piccolo knows more about Gohan <br> Goku comes back after a year and reads his son like a book <br> Piccolo spergs out because he stops reading Gohan's ki and Goku was right during the Cell arc about Gohan holding back <br> People still think Piccolo was right somehow despite hypocritically yelling at Goku for the exact same thing he did in the Saiyan arc <br> Gohan wants to wear Goku's gi in the Buu arc <br> Gohan and Goten are never upset with Goku <br> If Goku didn't do the shit he did everyone would be dead <br><br>He's not father of the year, but if no one gave a shit why should he?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's because SSJ is merely a multiplier, not a set ki level. And I think Vegeta is SSJ2 in BoG so the climb wasn't that steep.</br>  <br>See the movie it's TOTALLY SSJ 1. SSJ 2 has lightning effect and has to go through SSJ 1 first. Vegeta doesn't have both requirement.</br>  <br>Actually even at ssj 2 surpassing without transforming is very- very steep. Considering goku at ssj 3 cannot touch beerus let alone punching and kicking it.</br>  <br>Let alone surpassing at ssj 1. I hate how the movies had mocking canon setting and making it into uncleanable pile of mess and chaos.</br>  <br><br><br>Shut up you stupid cancer. There's no such thing as "canon setting" when it comes to power levels and there never was. Get over it. Transformations are not "multipliers", they're ehnancers. Achieving another level means you've progressed with your strength significantly but that's pretty much it. Nowhere does Toriyama specify how much more powerfull SSJ2 would be over SSJ1, nowhere, ever. Also, for fucks sake, do you even realize what it would be like to fight someone as little as twice as strong as you? They'd mop the floor with you, you have clearly no recognition how differences in strength work so no wonder you'd buy into this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>And by shit I mean this whole power level inflation which would make the whole thing eventually escalate into retarded levels.</br>  <br>Fuck off idiot newfag. There inconsistency in manga too but it's actually fixable. Like how wish change into 3 from 2. It's simple reasoning that dende has improved the dragonball qualit compared to the previously rushed rushed made dragonball. Use your brain for once, idiot.</br>  <br>Fck the touchscreen.</br>  <br>How can you call yourself a DB fan with such shitty knowledge of its canon. I won't spoonfeed you though, do the homework yourself, DB-aby.</br>  <br>More like, english nada.</br>  <br>  non anime/ cartoom pic <br>I actually want to say that you need to step aside because you clearly know nothing about DBZ manga. Your newfaggotry reekness is too obvious to be covered by anything.</br></br>    <br>You know both the movies was at very best is fanfiction or doujinshi level. I understand that many fans hate it and dissapointed because how it's mocking canon established setting and went full retard by by full fanfiction that contradicting the canon material and its established setting.</br>  any link I can get to see it dubbed?  <br>The 2 movies had made dragonball at the level of tom &amp; jerry or spongebob. Probably it's more fitting for dragonball now to be considered as tom &amp; jerry but in japanese version or japanese fantasy adventure manga but in Tom &amp; jerry setting. It's more fitting or more credible and making people a lot less confused to be familiar with Dragon Ball franchises.</br>  <br>This shit makes no sense. This is literally the only time that arm cannon has ever done anything ever.<br> tfw FnF won't be canon in a few months </br></br>  <br>I love when people take the franchise more seriously than the creator simply because of "muh canon". It's like the prime example of overly autistic DB fans<br><br><br> He can surpassed goku combat prowess at ssj 3 when he was only at ssj 1 in lunatic reasoning. <br>You people keep parotting that moment as if it didn't last for like half a minute at best and more importantly didn't even do anything at all. Like if he had actually really really hurt Beerus when he went all rage on him, it would have been one thing but it did literally nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>   everyone ITT implying SS2 even exists anymore <br>40 keks Toriyama admitted to completely forgetting about it. And the lightning was inconsistent back in the DBZ days because the animation quality was so up and down. Cheaper studios wouldn't bother adding lightning.</br>  <br>SS2 does exist. There's just no real point in showing it off anymore when there is visually not that much difference and the people they fight these days are weaker than an SS or stronger than SS3</br>  <br>  dbz anime <br>This is non canon to the manga let alone the filler. He cannot be excused to forget that to achieve level 2 he needs vegeta at level ssj 1 first. Is he still able to count 1 until 5 properly? Of course he can So it's no excuse then to forget to achieve level 2 he needs at level 1 SSJ.</br></br>  <br>You can skip SS1. They do it all throughout the Buu arc.</br>  <br>citation to canon material needed.</br>  <br>Goku has different hairstyle at SSJ 2. Vegeta more of bit more buff and a the lightning to differentiate it factually.</br>  <br>you first</br>  <br><br>Are you blind?</br></br>  Hi, is there someone that remember in which anime there was a girl saying "chabot" or "chabot"?

Nazi bitch, worse than everything in brotherhood.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't prove anything is objectively better but you can logically assume that the storyline planned from the very beginning with no filler is the more coherent version. Making up your own story halfway through another one usually can't compete with a story written with a vision in mind of how everything will play out.</br>  <br>Proving the point even more.</br>  <br>True as long as we leave out Conqueror of Shamballa.</br>  <br>I personally liked how different and ridiculous that story was<br>It was creative in the "the mandarin is actually a coke addict" kind of way<br>The originality was refreshing</br></br></br>  Do faggots even read the manga?  <br>I thought the villain was really shitty and brought down the whole movie as a result.</br>  <br>Brotherhood is essentially the manga, pared down a bit, and with that one weird anime original first episode.<br><br>Manga is definitely better than Brotherhood, but Brotherhood is like 85% the same as the manga, so it's not like reading the manga will give you a drastically new perspective on the story.</br></br></br>  It had better music (by far) and it handled a few parts better like Hughes death, but if you really think it's better overall you're fucking retarded.<br><br>The thing that pissed me off the most is they cut out so much shit about the Ishbal war that was in the manga.</br></br>  <br>Yeah that was one of the cuts Brotherhood made that I didn't really like. They kept it focused on Hughes, Mustang, and Hawkeye, but the stuff with Basque Grand was great, wish they could have included it.</br>  <br>Brotherhood is the manga retold by retards. No matter how good the contents you need a good storyteller to make it shine.</br>  2003 looks like Brawl: Everything looks less colorful and overall more grayish, boring as hell<br><br>Brotherhood is like Smash 4, more colorful and appealing to the eyes, brimming with life and character</br></br>  <br><br>amount of Lan fan by series<br><br> 2003 <br> 0 Lan Fan <br><br> Bro <br> All the Lan Fan <br><br>Bro hood wins</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bones literally copied the manga panels in 90% of the scenes they adapted.

And don't say her arm  </br></br>  <br> Bones literally copied the manga panels in 90% of the scenes they adapted <br> They mimicked Arakawa's art style, timing, and framing to a degree that I actually wanted to seem them do something different <br>Exactly, Brotherhood is the manga retold by retards.</br></br></br>  <br> Exactly, Brotherhood is the manga retold by retards. <br><br>and 2003 is the manga retold FOR retards</br></br></br>  <br>She fought Envy in central during Mustang's "fishing" operation.</br>  <br>The manga knows when to be funny, when to be dramatic and when to be tragic. In contrast, Irie takes what the manga has, throws it into a blender and serves whatever comes out the other end with little regard to anything except how to efficiently to chop up a dense 70 pages of narrative into a digestible 21 minutes. With few exceptions, the primary solution seems to be to wantonly disregard the creation of atmosphere and any dramatic build-up. Each episode is not structured around any kind of theme, message or idea. At times, entire episodes go by without any semblance of beginning, middle and end. Things just happen for the sake of covering synonymous events in the manga.</br>  <br><br>cool. My biggest gripe of the BH series was that she needed more screen time<br><br>though my favorite characters always seem to suffer that issue</br></br></br></br>  <br> FMA brotherhood is OBJECTIVELY better then FMA 2003. <br>Yes.</br></br>  Silly anonymous, don't waste time comparing turds!<br><br>Oh wait, Botherhood was actually watchable, and why am I even bothering with this bait?</br></br>  <br>Well considering 2003 was basically a fanfiction and all fanfictions are trash either you are saying Brotherhood is worse than trash or you are wrong.</br>  <br>It's not a very long fight scene, or even much of a fight scene really, it's mostly just Envy running away while the stuff with gluttony happens. Or trying to run away, since Lan Fan can track him using chi-sense, even when he turns into a dog.</br>  <br> Botherhood was actually watchable </br>  <br>Well I finished Brotherhood but couldn't even get to episode 20 of the 2003 series so ehh</br>  <br>She's the worse character</br>  <br>Let's be honest, most of the people who claim the 2003 version is better only do so because of nostalgia and didn't even bother watching Brotherhood.<br><br>Dante was just another 3edgy5me shonen villain. I'll agree Father was lackluster but at least the support villains, Bradley and Kimblee the 2009/manga ones not the one dimensional fucks from 2003, were way better.<br><br>Making both the female homunculus into tragic characters was dumb as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The first 25 episodes of 2003 &gt; the first 14 of Brotherhood.<br>The rest of Brotherhood &gt; the rest of 2003 that made no fucking sense</br></br>  <br><br>Oh you posted a facepalm? That clearly means you are right despite having no visible argument or points whatsoever <br><br><br><br>Give it up, mate. He posted a stock response image. He clearly is the grand master of all logic</br></br></br></br></br></br>  OP is OBJECTIVELY wrong and a Faggot.<br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>man I would have loved to have seen that! The gluttony fight was great but it was really far into the series. An earlier moment of her showing off how beastly the Xings can be would have been amazing, and would have made the seeing in the dark thing a bit less expository</br></br>  <br> No Xing or Briggs crew <br> Based Greed gets wasted early and never comes back <br> No Mustang getting revenge on Envy <br> Insufferable emo shota replaces Pride <br> Edge everywhere <br> No Wrath vs Tank scene <br><br>Yeah no, just read the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Greed was best homonculus. That glorious final fuck you.</br></br>  <br> Hurr durr I'm evil <br>It worked for Father, he was created as an experiment by humans he had a complex of being sub human, he wanted to be stronger than the human race. Dante just wanted the dick from some ass hole who lives for ever and fucks random bitches<br>The only homunculus that was better in 2003 was Lust. In 2003 she had a character and in Brotherhood she was just a boss battle for Mustang. However Hitler Wrath is so much cooler and reserved than Hitler Pride. Kid Wrath is really fucking annoying. Mom Sloth felt contrived, granted Brotherhood Sloth was just there to but a circle under the country and was just a lazy retarded Gluttony, he at least gave the Armstrongs something to do.<br>Also Pepe Envy is better than invincible 2003 Envy</br></br></br></br>  Post pictures about an anime without posting the anime,others guess what it is.<br><br>I'll start.</br></br>  Extreme hard mode.<br>If anyone gets this I will be surprised.</br>  <br>boku no pico</br>  <br>Diebuster</br>  <br>incorrect</br>  <br>that's correct</br>  Today is the day.<br><br>Finally a new BNHA chapter and more of these bad-asses.</br></br>  FUCK OFF  <br>greatest manga of all time</br>  New episode in 3 hours, Aoi's chapter was translated for anyone who missed it in the slower threads: https://springephemeral.wordpress.c<wbr>om/2015/07/28/joukamachi-no-dandeli<wbr>on-chapter-9/</wbr></wbr>  <br>Ok.

Does this series have shonen battles?  <br>Series started with Shuu teleporting vending machine trying to attack Akane</br>  <br>This is based on a slice of life 4-Koma with super powers. I highly doubt there will be anything aside from some competitive use of powers during challenges.<br>It's pretty comfy/cute though.</br></br>  <br>Poor Teru.</br>  <br>Where do people get the 4koma that's often posted in this threads? Like the one about Shuu and Kanade's past. <br><br>Is it just some anon randomly translating future chapter or is it a apparently different manga?</br></br></br>  <br>I think the anon who translated those pages said he scanned the magazine. Volume 3 is coming out soon though.</br>  <br>Oh so it was from the same manga. I thought it was a spinoff or something.</br>  <br>Is this a reference to Durararara!! ?</br>  <br>I doubt it, since the next panels are him stealing her skirt and pantyhose.</br>      <br><br>You calling YuiKaori Ugly?</br></br>  dem voices  <br>Here, have a 10/10 clean<br> I need to learn how to use photoshop properly </br></br>  I thought the anime makes the debris worse than in the manga?  <br>It seems he acts like a slacker most of the time in public. Even his classmates treat him like he's a commoner so he doesn't get the respect like the other siblings do.  Though he's the best onii-chan in reality. </br>  <br> like a slacker most of the time in public <br>More like a perv.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember seeing him acting like a perv in public though. He only acts like that with Akane. It's more like he doesn't care and just sits back doing nothing.</br>  <br>He doesn't acts like a perv, but from my reading he is seen as a perv for some reason.</br>  <br>It's probably because everybody but Akane knows that he's in her fanclub or something.</br>  <br> for some reason </br>  Not quite a panty shot when it's a swimsuit  I wonder if any of these girls are the author's waifu?  <br>Looks like it's off centre too which strikes me as extra lewd. Although in reality someone just messed it up a bit.<br><br><br>If any of them are, it's Akane</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's Akane <br>Good taste then.</br></br>  Just getting into this series because of the fanservice from last ep. This is pretty fun. <br><br>It's apparently more of an SoL with a weird touch.</br></br>    Nearly done with the first segment, I ended up starting later than last week, but it should still be out tomorrow, just slightly later in the day.  <br>thank you based mpt</br>  <br>incest is best</br>  <br>The word wincest exists for a reason, after all</br>  <br>I love your efforts MPT, have an Akane.</br>  Their country is doomed.  <br> Onii-sama </br>  <br>Take it easy. Did you solve the typesetting problem?</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Akane a qt</br>  Have you noticed that Akane's skin is pinkier than the rest of the cast...?    <br>So why'd she rise in the rankings? Was it from the city cleaning day?</br>  <br><br>Based MPT. You're awesome.</br></br>  <br>You are not a true connoisseur of superior 2D bodies yet. Keep working hard and someday you might even reach our level.</br>  <br>The entire Manga is fall in love with Akane the Mc please.</br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br>Because Kanade and Haruka are the only ones with any capacity to rule a country and there is no way either of them will win.</br>  <br>Maybe Aoi's also able to do it but she just doesn't want to.</br>  <br>Haruka actually has a dim view of Kanade, thinking Kanade is placing national interest SECOND. (Chapter 20)</br>  <br>...maybe it's one of Misakis anyway.</br>  <br>Poor Shuu. He's such a good big bro. He places last so none of his other siblings feel bad about being last.</br>  <br>Shiori will be a great leader once she's a bit older. Hell, she'd be better than most already.</br>  Subs when  So Akane will turn into a NEET or something?  <br>I doubt it. She has a strong sense of what ought to be done, despite her shyness.</br>  Why did Akane show her pantsu in last ep? She's a bit of a prude as I watch the first couple of eps.  <br>You mean when she forgot to wear her skirt?</br>  <br>Her skirt was tore on way to school, but when she was changing into shorts, the bell rang and she decided is better be bottomless than be late.</br>  <br>She thought she was wearing shorts underneath the top.</br>  <br>Kanade is supersex</br>  <br>Thank you based MPT</br>  Loving this show.  I want to cum inside Hikari.  <br>She is the lewd one.</br>  <br>C U M I N S I D E<br>U<br>M</br></br></br>  <br><br> this absolutely adorable girl will became a cowtit in a few years <br>Do we get to see the middle ground too? B cup Hikari would be perfection.</br></br></br>   The instant I saw Akane-sama in a swimsuit, I felt a lot better. I'll follow her for the rest of my life. <br>Anon pls</br>  <br>Is this the Akane FC board?</br>  <br>Haruka call is a fansite.</br>  <br>Let me get this rite...<br><br>6 wants 5 dick<br>4 wants 2 dick<br>9 wants 8 cudles and handholding<br>1 wants 9 cudles<br><br>Alot of incest here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think Haruka's posting here.<br><br><br>You forgot 3 wants 2 dick too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, they're incestuous?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's canon that Misaki wants Haruka's dick. The others are half text half subtext.</br>  <br>mmm.. didnt notice that until i saw the manga<br><br><br>Welcome to this ride!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone are subtext, others just need to say "I want your D/V card" while Shu got a girl from outside, he's still a siscon though.</br>  <br> You'll never hug by your onee-chan <br>I don't know about that. My sister and I went out for lunch and she was linking arms with me. I got a little spooked after that.</br></br>  <br>Pick the fuckup</br>  <br>Don't bother, the incest is just bait. The faggot brother chose a commoner instead of his bombshell sister.</br>  <br>I don't understand the hype either. It's the same shit as C.C's ass, people praise it to hell and back when Kallen's is just as big and shapely.</br>  <br>Don't bother with crazies.</br>  Any good Aoi scene this episode? I need my nee-chan dose.  <br>It's all about the number of exposures.<br>CC shows her ass more than Kallen, meanwhile Kallen shows her tits more.</br></br>   girl <br> wants to be king <br>what is this shit.</br></br>  <br>mikasa pls</br>  <br>That's because the Japanese word for monarch is unisex (ou).</br>  <br>It's more because they have a word for queen (女王) but this is not using it for whatever reason</br>  <br>The first skit is about a trip of the siblings, so she does has a cut or two...</br>  <br>What other shows has the artist(s) worked on? It reminds me of another show, but I can't remember what it was.</br>  <br>Twin-tail.</br>  <br>Twintails?</br>  <br>I mean Ore Twintail no Narimatsu.</br>   the dandelion and twintails artist is Kasuga Ayumu   Based Haruka.  <br><br> There are people in this thread RIGHT NOW who wouldn't vote for Shiori <br><br>I don't want to live in this kingdom anymore</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately not, I thought about making a vector pattern of the dots and clipping it into the text, but apparently that's fairly laggy and a lot of players don't quite liten properly, so it'll just be coloured rather than patterned.</br>  <br> Fuck the tits  <br> look at that midriff <br><br>Simultaneously? Or in that order?<br>Either way, that'll require some strategic placement</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Twincest is wincest.</br>  <br>I too want to prprprprprprprprpr</br>  <br>I don't think people here (or at least me) need fancy typesetting, so don't worry.</br>  <br>Is that like a motorboating sound?</br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't think it was too important, but figured that if I could, I may as well go all out</br>  <br>peropero<br>ペロペロ</br></br>  <br>A diamond that goes unnoticed.

Haruka would have to do all the work, but not with 7 other Misakis right there with him.</br>  Wait, I'm slowpoke as fuck Satou and Twintails' Aika have the same VA?  <br>do all of the Misakis share the same attraction for Haruka?</br>  <br>The way I understand it is that all her clones have one personality trait of the original amplified, but they're all still Misaki at the core. So probably, but in varying degrees.<br><br>What I don't know is if Misaki gets all the memories of her clones once she recombines.</br></br></br>  The 3 of them can pass off as a family.  <br> no Aoi to pat your head <br> no Aoi to welcome you every night after a long day at work <br> no Aoi to tell you that everything is gonna be daijobu <br>Yet another reason to kill myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Kanade x Shu = shiori</br>  <br> The 3 of them can pass off as a family. <br>But... they are a family.</br></br>  <br>You're right, I thought it was 7 all together, I'm an idiot.</br>  <br><br><br>I just noticed that they have different eye colors. Also, why is it always the purple one who is the slut?</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine 8 Misakis rushing in through the door like that to jump on you and  cuddle  you.</br>  picked up  <br>I dunno, the one of the far left looks pretty angry, I don't think I've heard of aggressive cuddling before</br>  <br>Not many more pleasant ways to go</br>  <br>so they're the 7 sins of Misaki?<br><br> Slutty one best one </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she just wants to be first for once.</br>  <br>I'd be a little worried about what the wrath girl would do to me.</br>  <br>You can't really tell which one the others are except sloth, wrath and lust.</br>  First two segments are done, Haruka had a surprsingly good excuse; maybe another couple of hours before they're done.  <br>Thank you anon</br>  <br>Faito, MPT-kun!</br>  <br> Haruka had a surprsingly good excuse <br>I just don't know why he doesn't say that in the first place, or the fact that Akane is oblivious to the fact that they've always seen as celebrities.</br></br>  I don't know if anyone's made stitches from the ED before, but I just did.        The OP/ED aren't exactly anything special, but they're pretty pleasant.<br>Fitting for the show really: it's nothing outstanding but it makes me smile every week and that's honestly enough.</br>  Who's your Prison School waifu?

Who the fuck knows anymore, they are slow regardless of downtime.</br>  <br>Google ain't giving me the chapter.</br>  <br>Thing is, it's not like website downtime would have an impact on translations - I'm pretty sure they can communicate through other means, watch them pull the 'b-but we had downtime!'-card if they ever return.</br>  <br>diamond-sang kawaii</br>  <br>I'll give you a hint:  Student Council </br>  <br><br>The Korean subs are sufficient to get what's going on.

The last week was the hardest one for the group in years (I lost my credit card, Paypal without funds, my PC crashed and it is still broken). Very well, I'm writting this just to let you know that our website is online again, and we'll still scanlating Prison School, but please be patient 'till the weekend. <br><br>That weekend is already past. Either his computer died or they just said fuck it.</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't see any hint of Weekly Young Magazine 35 anywhere except the official sites</br>  <br>?<br>She did a blackmail video to get even</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, me neither. What was the point of learning Nip in the first place, Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br> learn Moon <br> suddenly everything is in Chinese or Korean </br></br>  <br>So that you do not need subs and dubs.</br>  <br>Thanks to simulcasts subs are coming out faster than ever though. Manga is where its at and the sources are dying one after another.</br>  <br><br>At least grinding all those Kanji can help a bit with Chinese.</br></br>  <br>What if hes right</br>  <br>I can't hear you.</br>  I want to tell Hana she's beautiful and go on a date with her.  <br><br> having a waifu for each seperate anime <br>fucking disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>And then I'll excuse to go to the restroom and she insists to go together.</br>  <br><br>Kinky. She will probably develop a fetish for having sex in places where people might run into them.

Everyone stay calm, and don't forget to take your suicide meds.

This manga is chalk full of top camaraderie.</br>  <br>When do the episodes typically come out? I'll settle for an episode if there's no chapter.</br>  <br><br>they come out every friday I've heard. so hopefully tomorrow</br></br>  <br>17 hours until the next one airs.</br>  <br><br><br>Im going to be disappointed if he doesnt patch things with klutz-yaoi-chan</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Cool, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>He has to. She's likely the only woman alive who likes The Three Kingdoms as much as him.</br>  <br>Why is utopia scans so God damn shit?<br>They have literally one good manga in their catalogue and they can barely handle that.</br></br>  <br><br> not wanting him to turn gay </br></br>  <br>Joe pls go.</br>  <br>Oh come on.<br>You want it, too.</br></br>  Hey. Just curious, what do you guys think of the anime? I was aware of the manga, but after seeing the first ep I went ahead and read it and bought vol 1 (I like collecting stuff I really enjoy). I see a lot of hate for the anime but I was just wondering  <br><br>They're dead for all intents and purposes now, and we have the Koreans to jerry-rig a translation as soon as the K RAWs come out.</br></br>  <br> not wanting Gakuto to have true harem end <br> joe part of his harem along with Klutz-chan <br><br>If Andre goes back to Vice prez i'll be sad. He works well with crazy bitch, but I can feel in my bones they will put some more forced (but funny) drama there. Be funny if each guy ended up with 2+ harem end.</br></br></br></br>  Post yfw Meiko returns to her former self.  <br> it happens through a sudden love for one of the boys </br>  <br> for andre <br><br>I know its coming<br><br><br><br>not really looking forwards to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this a troll?</br>  <br>Yes, and you did a poor job of ignoring it.</br>  Just to remind you there is no chapter tomorrow. But the episode will be dela--- kidding. It won't  <br><br>Butchered by censorship. It will be decent once the BRs come out, but nothing much beyond that. It's pretty faithful though, and the voice acting is good.</br></br>  <br>That wouldnt even make sense. Shes never had interest in anyone. Her trigger is mari.</br>  <br>It'll be Andre. Just accept it Anon.</br>  <br>Don't forget to use Commie.</br>  <br><br>Anything that breaks the Hymen takes a woman's Virginity.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect? I don't even know why I like her so much, she's  indeed  a bitch, but her face is so cute.<br><br>I want to  pinch her nose and her cheeks. </br></br>  <br><br>She's a total cunt though. In every sense of the word. And she's a depraved homo.</br></br>  <br>the puffiest</br>  <br>Because Smirkfu.</br>  <br>I somehow like how manipulative and smug she is with the girls, and the depraved homo thing, only makes it better, that chapter was the hottest thing I've ever read.</br>  <br>I was so close to waifu-ing her before she was raped.<br><br>not pure anymore though.</br></br></br>  <br> rape(d) </br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure Kate was on the receiving side for most of it.</br></br>  <br> implying Mari didnt rape the shit out of Kate <br><br>she was a woman so ended up enjoying it, but it was still rape. Marifags like literal rapists.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't see how it counts as rape.</br></br>  <br>yuri is boring and meiko deserves better<br>I don't care if it makes sense, have her end with four eyes shitter or maso-buddha, it's more fun</br></br>  <br>It's not rape if she raped Mari back.</br>  <br> mfw I love sluts <br><br>It's like the missing piece of my heart.<br><br><br>It was consensual rape.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a damn good villain, that's for sure. Still, Kate is too much of a psychopath for me to ever consider her "waifu material".<br>To each their own, I suppose.</br></br>  <br>It is not yuri, it is friendship.</br>  <br>people waifu mari and she's at least on kate's level in cuntery, if not higher, plus a misandrist.<br>people waifu for all kinds of fucked up reasons, don't let it bother you</br></br>  <br><br><br>Kate saying 'no', trying to bite Mari to make her stop, and being forced down for almost the entire thing before giving into it.<br><br>It was clearly rape, with power being the main driving force, and then blackmail. It was pretty fucked up.<br><br> I fap'd to it at least three times that day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, especially when meiko bent over, flaunted her ass and begged mari to spank her</br>  <br> Kate saying 'no' <br><br>So, this means that 99.9% of any hentai doujin has rape on it?</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't spank his bros </br>  <br>thats sort of the point</br>  <br>taking the time to shit talk someone else's crush on a fictional character. pathetic</br>  <br>Kate could have stopped her anytime if she really wanted to.<br>She did not.</br></br>   All of these bro moments with the guys <br><br> I wish I had friends like this. </br></br>  <br>Ah yeah. Censorship kinda ruined a lot of parts. Especially the pissing scene</br>  <br>Well, if she spanked her back, I'd consider it comradeship, but she denied her to torment her more, domme style. That goes beyond the spanking I engage with my friends.</br>  <br>Taylor's amazing legs. Hana double best.<br> I'd let either do anything to me. </br></br>  <br>Because she just is anon</br>  <br> 99.9% <br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br><br>Would you want to stop if the woman you've been Waifuing for years is fucking you?</br></br>  <br>she was chained to Mari, and Mari was over powering her both physically and psychologically. She tried to stop it multiple times.</br>  <br><br>Part of her wanted it to stop, but she was closeted, and with a woman she'd been lusting over silently for years, so there's no wonder she let it happen.</br></br>    I don't understand the point of did she rape her or not debate.<br>At the end of the day, Kate lusts for her, Mari used her feelings and crushed them and they're both rotten cunts. Rape or not changes nothing in the grand picture.</br>  Vice Prez for sure but I'm only up to Anzu in terms of new females so I don't know if there is any more.<br><br>The delicious body and chest and her no shame in showing off her delicious thong.<br><br><br>HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one that is spot on is Rooney Mara</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and even then only because of the hair/makeup. The others are really a stretch.</br></br>  <br>post this on /co/ for easy shitstorm/trolling</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br><br>is she becoming so lewd that her eyes are going cross-eyed?</br></br>  <br><br> mfw this is revealed to be Kate's sister/mom and she's going to be the new Chairwoman <br><br>it'll keep getting better and better it has too! WE HAVE TO SPIRAL IN DEEPER!!!</br></br></br></br>  so is Joe actually gay, and destined to be some fabulous idol-agent, or just a phase?  <br>Probably just a phase. I think he'll end up with Cake-san  or one of his Ants .</br>   Andrew ends up in a polygamous relationship based on abuse <br><br>Truly Andrenomics is king, what an innovator.</br></br>  <br>The real meaning of Andrenomics is believing he can ever be a good character ashit.</br>   Meiko will NTR Risa   <br>I'm sorry someone needs to be raw SRS BSNS to you and that you can't have fun</br>  <br>been watching the anime is she always an asshole and why is she an asshole?</br>  <br>The piss awakens something in her. <br><br>Soon™.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not an asshole, she just a sexually frustrated/confused teen. She nice to the girls, and doesn't really interact with the boys apart from Kiyoshi, with whom she mellows out after a while.</br></br>  <br>She's a sheltered teen who apparently never had intimate contact with boys. Kiyoshi triggers her "puberty" and ends up maturing alongside her</br>  <br> 2015 <br> not being an ass man <br><br>Leave</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But from what I've seen, she's right. The boys were caught trying to peek at the girls while they were showering. I'm not saying her actions are justified, but the boys were in the wrong from the get go.<br><br>I still think the anime is a good watch, I don't see how anyone can hate something so mindlessly fun as prison school, maybe not AotS, but it's definitely worth watching for the ride.</br></br></br></br>  Do you guys think that the Hiramoto planned on writing the Kiyoshi and Hana relationship the way it turned out?<br><br>I feel that initially she was only meant to be a set-up for jokes, but as she grew more popular, Hiramoto decided on actually developing her as a character.<br><br>Similarily, Chiyo was probably meant to be the cliche love-interest girl, but he seems to have grown bored of her as the story progressed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true.</br>  <br>Hiramoto stated that Hana is his favorite girl, so it's no wonder the story went that way.<br> Too bad he'll make his waifu lose the Kiyoshibowl </br></br>  <br>not before  she loses her virginity with Kiyoshi spoiling it for Chiyo </br>  <br><br>Got source on that? Also, that might be the case now, but it sure didn't feel like that at the start.<br><br>As for her losing, I don't think the manga will go into full romantic drama mode. I don't see any character entering a serious relationship that is not a part of some ploy, or a setup for wacky situations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some other anon posted and quoted an interview link some threads ago, but I don't have them, sorry. He might've been lying too.<br><br>In any case, I don't expect full blownout romance, but some drama is gonna go down, it's inevitable after we got Risa taming Andre and Mari with Kate</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh sure, there's going to be drama, but it will ultimately be for the sake of comedy/erotica. It won't suddenly go into full broken hearts, shattered dreams, depression mode.</br></br>  <br>It has to be planned if he goes back almost 170 chapters to reference the four leaf clover shit. At first you wonder what the fuck is the point of kiyoshi remembering this so suddenly and then it hit me, four leaf clovers have the superstition behind them that the person who finds one will meet their future lover on the same day. The boys found one but it didnt amount to anything. Kiyoshi found one by himself and met hana up close and personal on the same day. This shit goes deep in a comedic way.</br>  <br>I never even fucking thought about that.<br><br>For Chiyo to be the main love interest, Kiyoshi has sure spent more time with everyone but.</br></br></br>  <br>Those chapters made me harder than 90% of h doujins I've read. God damn that was hot, and I'm not even into yuri. Is it because you know the whole backstory that it makes it that good?</br>  <br>I don't recall Kiyoshi finding one</br>  <br>Panels like this are important. Just like nobody realized hanas phone dropped and took a picture of them.</br>  <br>Hana is gathering those clovers for unprivileged kids</br>  <br>He probably found one at the same time he picked up that bird since hes holding it in that tree.</br>  <br>man the art has really improved since then</br>  <br>Thats shingo's hand</br>  <br>Hes trembling and saying ill be killed in response to considering the option of telling chiyo the truth. Thats not shingo.</br>  <br> probably <br>You know he didn't, but I'm sure you noticed Chiyo stalking Kiyoshi to find a way to make sure he isn't a bad guy</br></br>   Before, when Chiyo thought she was fucking the guys  <br>Because in her fucked up world he cant be a bad guy for her assumption of him actually liking sumo. When peoples ideals get put into jeopardy they will tack on any amount of bullshit to reinforce it and make sure that ideal doesnt get shattered.</br>  What should be peeking out anon?  I just binge read the whole manga in these two days.<br><br> mfw the last chapters </br></br>  <br>sex and laughs anon<br><br>fap while you laugh</br></br></br>  <br>Weren't they jap-&gt;kor-&gt;eng without proper scans though? Made it hard to really keep the feeling of good flow.</br>  <br>I tl;dr'd it on tumblr, and she was actually complimenting it. Something about how the scenes were constructed and how the character development of Hana is good.</br>  <br>the boxers she was wearing you dummy.</br>      Kate is straight you retards. She doesn't like Mari that way.    <br>Oh god all the girls in this manga make me diamonds.</br>  I think Hana will win the Kiyoshib Owl. The mangaka clearly puts the most effort into drawing her, particularly her legendary expressions and has given her the most covers. She's clearly his favorite.   smart phones in the 90s <br><br>dude what</br></br>  RUNNING IN THE 90S   he didn't have a smartphone in the 90s <br>poorfag pleb</br>  <br>it's not the 90s in the animu.<br>it's like yawara.<br>in the manga it's barcelona olympics, the anime they made it atlanta.</br></br></br>  <br>CYBER TALKING<br>CYBER SEX IS ON THE LINE<br>NEW DESIRE</br></br></br>  <br>That's not a phone, it's a Game &amp; Watch.</br>  <br> 1990s <br> Still playing Game &amp; Watch </br></br>  That's clearly a blue gameboy  <br>Isn't he just holding a blue cassette tape?</br>  <br>Wow what a slut!</br>  <br>Anon, why the hell would you hold a cassette tape to your ear?</br>  <br><br>So you can hear it better</br></br>  <br/>  BOOM<br><br>BOOM<br><br>JAPAN</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying it isn't a Nokia brick </br>  <br> Flip phones in 2015 </br>  <br> Not still using a Motorola RAZR </br>  <br>Barcelona was 1992, Atlanta was 1996.

As Anonzaki steadily regains consciousness, he became aware of the pain his body was going through over the past two days.  Personally I think the last thread's ending was by far the best this story's seen so far and the best it's going to get. <br><br> But I'll be lurking anyway </br></br>  I jerk upward from the uncomfortable sheets, almost screaming from the pain in my chest.<br><br>"Sakura..."</br></br>  oohh boy here we go  It's been two days since the incidnet in the school gym. <br><br>Anonzaki-kun is healing up safely in the hospital. As for me, well, there is no sugarcoating it. <br><br>I'm running away.</br></br></br></br>  I keep telling myself that I've accepted it, that I will never be the one that he loves.<br><br>But...aren't I contradicting myself by running away? <br><br>Unseen to us, the Sakura Chiyo before us wipes away the tears that began to form.</br></br></br></br>   blue ribbons <br><br>I hate it. I hate it so much.</br></br>  "It's alright, Chiyo..." I console myself.<br><br>Closing my eyes and letting the bus’s engine drown out my thoughts I started feeling a bit happy.<br><br>Even though it was an accident...our lips met.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He hates it!</br>  Do you think you are allowed to be happy?  <br>oh shit</br>  Beads of sweat started to form from her forehead.<br><br>Nearly jumping out of her seat, Sakura Chiyo began to look around anxiously. <br><br>No, it wasn't a voice that came from any of the passengers that sat near her nor was it the bus driver. <br><br>A voice called out to her.<br><br>One that only she could hear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not like this!</br>  <br>Dio, its that you?</br>  <br>I don't think I'm ready for this.</br>  NOT AGAIN  Post the next part already.  HERE WE GO AGAIN    It...must've been my imagination. <br><br>Her heart coming to a steady pace again, Sakura Chiyo began to daydream.</br></br>  <br>It won't end well. I'm sure of it.</br>  Ha, what a funny event.<br><br>I gave up. Aren't I such a loser? <br><br>However, I won't regret it! I'll cherish those ribbons forever. Those ribbons that have soaked in Anonzaki's blood.

Here?!" Sakura yells as she struggles from her seat<br><br>No, this can't be it! This won't be how it ends!" <br><br>As if she was made to be the only one to suffer in this bus on route to its doom, Sakura Chiyo felt enraged.</br></br></br></br>  <br>RIP Chiyo<br>You won't be missed.</br></br>  <br>bad end get</br>   Struggle all you want, this is your end. <br><br>"That...voice!

After I began hanging out with Sakura and the others, I stopped coming here.<br><br>"Oho, so you've arrived as expected, Anonzaki Umetaro." <br><br>A voice unfamiliar to Anonzaki called out to him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>M-make it stop.</br>  "W-Who are you?!"<br><br>This guy is no student here!<br><br>"Me?

All I could think of was "How does he know who I am? How does he know Chiyo??"<br><br>I only snapped out of it when I heard a voice call out to us.</br></br>    Can someone point me to the direction of the archive for the previous installments  This is a retarded continuation. Whoever is making this, please stop.  <br>https://archive.moe/a<br><br>Got you fam.</br></br></br>  "OKARIN!" - a soft voice called out to... somebody. As the guy continued to rant, a girl, around my age, approached us. <br><br>"Okarin! I've been looking all over the place for you! The policeman told you to stop scaring other students!"</br></br>  <br>see <br>lurk moar.</br></br>  <br>brb gotta go finish steins;gate now</br>  <br>You know what time it is</br>  "Oh!" - seems that this girl only just now noticed me - "Sorry about that! My name is Mayuri Shiina and this is my friend Okabe Rintarou." She paused, and then suddenly started talking to her friend, who only just now noticed that she was even there: "Okarin! You were supposed to be helping me look for my hat!"    <br>don't tell me the hat is going to have ribbons on it</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aWl<wbr>1KHNTf5s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  What's going on? What is this?  "Oh, sweet, innocent Mayuri - with not a single care in the world! People like her are why the Organization can prosper. You, Anonzaki Umetaro! You saw the truth! You saw the things they are capable of. There are not many people who know the truth out there, but we do exist. And they want to hunt us down."  "Look at this, Anonzaki Umetaro. Does this look familiar?" - with those words Okabe Rintarou showed me... a hat?<br><br>"MY HAT!" - Mayuri chimed. <br><br>All of my doubt has disappeared, however, when I took a proper look at the hat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OH FUCK</br>  shit shit OH SHIT  <br>jesus</br>    <br>those ribbon look fam-- OHH SHIITT!</br>    <br/>  Humanity has a lot of fears. Darkness, heights, loud noises...<br><br>But for me, there was nothing scarier in the world than a pair of blue ribbons.<br><br>"That's strange... I don't remember putting this ribbon on my hat..." - Mayuri said, taking a closer look.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>now everything makes sense</br></br>  <br>So if ribbons is waifu.. how does he fuck it?</br>  <br>can't unsee</br>  <br>the loops</br>  <br>based okarin</br>  <br>Arigatou</br>  "Ara ara, my little plan didn't work..." - a familiar voice suddenly startled me.<br><br>"Sorry for this, bro."</br></br>  <br>it's time</br>  I turned around just in time to-        what the fuck did i just stumble into  <br>TO WHAT YOU FUCKING NIGGER?!

The original text probably mentions something like an encounter and then someone running away, and the japanese reader fills in the blank and assumes that it is the MC who did the running, thus making Elegant Loli appear strangely inquisitive for asking clarification on the subject. I just wish the english translation team managed to use ambiguous words/syntax to properly reproduce the sneakiness in the conversation.  MC confirmed for going edgelord?
