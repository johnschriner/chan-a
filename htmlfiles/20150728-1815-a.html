[ Left or right?  There is anyone who wouldn't choose left?  Best girl.  <br>I see FAs on /a/ all the time.</br>  <br>Right.<br><br>Orange a shit. A SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>Left.</br>  Pink  <br><br> orangefags </br></br>  <br>Orange. Silver a shit.</br>  <br>Silver a best.</br>  <br>Right, of course.</br>  <br>Left because I'm not into bitches and whores.</br>  <br>Orange &gt; Pink &gt; Black &gt; Poop &gt; Silver</br>  <br><br>You just posted one.</br></br>  <br>Now let's be fair –Orange isn't a whore. Silver is closer to a being a whore, but she is also best girl.</br>  <br>Shitwa is a literal bitch.</br>  <br>Neither, direct me to where Pink is.</br>  Pink = Silver &gt; Black &gt; * &gt; Orange  <br>I have to wonder if Silverfags are all masochists or betafags.</br>  Pink &gt; Silver &gt; Yellow &gt; Black &gt; Orange  <br> Cute, adorable, chill and cool childhood friend loli <br> Or a blackmailing and pretentious 3DPD-like cunt with family issues <br>Gee, OP. You sure make this hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Quite the opposite, triumphing over a bitch takes an alpha male. It's like breaking in a wild stallion or wrestling a crocodile.<br><br><br> Orange <br> chill and cool <br>You serious? She's a spaz. Black is probably the chillest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br>Once again, FLAT is justice.</br>  <br><br> liking joke characters </br></br>  <br> loli <br>Anta full baka.</br></br>  <br>Please, she'd break you before can break her.</br>  <br> joke <br>Pink was no joke man, she was very cute and probably the second best girl for MC if it weren't for Masuzu.<br><br><br>Speak for yourself, I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Joke characters tend to be better than serious ones in shows like this.</br>  <br>Orange</br>  <br> liking retards </br>  <br>How does it feel knowing that Hollanda will never win a World Cup?</br>  <br>Best girl never wins.</br>  <br> neverlands <br> orangefag <br><br>How fitting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The proper term is comic relief character. Those types are usually fun and Pink being second best to Orange can be said to be a testament to that. Pink even supports Orange, so you which team is the team to side with.</br>  <br> Netherlands <br> best girl <br>Bullshit. They start off well and fall apart after a few screw ups, even degenerating into infighting. They're a good team no doubt but far from the true best,  Germany .</br></br></br>  <br> Enemy of my enemy is my friend. <br>But then again i don't like white either, fuck that bitch. I heard pink got better in last volume and try to find a way to stop MC's anti-love thing.</br></br>  <br> white </br>  <br><br>Oh fuck i mean silver.</br></br>  <br>you know*<br><br><br>More Silver than White.<br><br>Thing is though, Pink and Orange gets along well so they are not enemies.<br><br>Last volume that had spoilers I remember reading was volume 8. That was Pink's volume and in that was her first time being a serious heroine. She realized her position and in the end went to support Orange to be together with the MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If team Orange doesn't win, I'll riot.</br>  <br>Here, have a Molotov cocktail and some bike chains. It's going to be a harem end because Eita is JUST that chuuni. /a/ is going to shrug and say "it was always shit" but everyone will be smoldering inside.</br>  <br>Those with good taste.</br>  <br><br>Left, right is okay too though, I like silver hair.</br></br>  I want to cum all over Masuzu's delicious tummy.  <br>Was it ever satisfactorily explained in canon why she doesn't wear pantsu? It's been so long I forget.<br><br> inb4 she's a slut, whore, etc </br></br></br>  <br>She just likes FREEDOM.</br>  <br> going commando <br>I get it.</br></br>  <br><br>these<br><br>why is she so perfect</br></br></br></br>    <br>right</br>    Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange  anyone who likes orange should be euthanized    <br>Orange is such a fucking shitty bitch. Worst girl.</br>  <br>This /a/non knows.</br>    That boy who has a crush on MC    Avoid the crazy.  <br>Always left.</br>    Silver is made for good hard breeding<br><br>Orange is too dainty, she'd BWEAK</br></br>  <br>Chiwa. She is one of the few childhood friends who deserves to win over the bitch heroine.</br>    <br> that fucking scene </br>  <br>I concur.</br>    <br><br>I hate to break it to you...but all dem bitches be krazy!</br></br>  <br> boy </br>      <br>Why the fuck can't we just have regular traps lusting for MC cock instead of reverse traps. Makes me sick.</br>    <br>Can you make a webm of this scene? </br>    <br>Left, because she's not a blackmailing cunt</br>  I like Silver and Orange individually. I wish only one existed and not the other. Orange deserves to have her wish fulfilled by being with her childhood love and watching Silver defrost is magical. <br><br>Fuck the author for making me choose one or the other.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't have that video in my com right now. Also it might take sometime to re-download so don't expect anything.</br></br>    <br>Ok.</br>  <br><br>Or...<br><br>Send me a download link (Preferably Mega , Mediafire) and I'll make whatever webm you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's gay.</br>  <br>This is what I found<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kgdw1B7B!vR0n-<wbr>oBBV-3Q4sZqs3VxtXDGtYlhxTblZsTB_DRy<wbr>acE</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Pink, please</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will see what I can do.</br></br>  I'm still baffled as to how Silver can have fans.  <br>She bullies worst girl. That's enough reason to like her.</br>  Who /bestFriend/ here?<br>Nobody?<br>eh, it's not like I'm gay, but if dating pink would make my bro happy, I'd marry pink.</br></br>    <br>I think most of her "fans" like her unironically.</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I'm not sure if you want the whole thing or not but here you go.</br></br></br>  <br>That's perfect. Cheers.</br>  I'd take silver and orange.<br>The other two can join in.<br>I guess I'll have them all.</br></br>  Here, have the fixed version  <br>This. I think many would agree except the filthy orangefags.</br>  <br>neither, as i am not a lolicon or a masochist</br>  <br>I would rather have Pink win than Shitwa.</br>  All the world's a front page<br>And all the men and women merely memesters</br>  <br>how's your cancer going op?<br><br>also<br> 98 <br>it's 2015</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Memeing started in 98.<br>Educate yourself Jojo fanboy.<br>I bet you didnt even read the whole manga and watch the whole anime + OVA twice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I done goofed, I didn't watch the OVA.

Someone draw Leon, the protag of GARO anime, killing a non-human girl, demon would be best.  <br> I think I'm not allowed to request mgs here either.<br> I mean, except for EMG, which is cool and all, but you know. </br> </br>  <br>Tamamo is from a game and people keep drawing her</br>  <br>that's a rule from like ancient greece, the human body is flexible, it's way easier to follow rules regarding the length of limbs <br>ie. your elbow is where your ribs end, your upper arm is (most often) long enough to reach the top of your head, your shoulders are most often three heads wide etc.<br><br>you just have to go into realistic proportions really.</br></br></br></br>  Flamie titfuck under her top please<br>Her tits are actually a little bit bigger than they are in this pic</br>  <br>Mgs?</br>  <br>is that a gril?</br>  <br>Yeah let's ignore the handful of mangas  and the rumored anime </br>  <br>Oh, I mean monstergirls.<br>Mostly from the anime that's coming out.</br></br>  <br>metal gear solid</br>  <br>monster girls are typically fine (the manga and anime ones at least)<br>suu was in a phalanx collage the other day actually.</br></br>  <br>Just Extra or CCC?</br>  <br>Touhou has had manga longer than some FotM shit</br>  <br>That's what I was thinking. <br>Makes sense now</br></br>  <br> rumored <br>Don't make me feel optimistic. I can't deal with it not happening, or it happening but being done badly. CCC with caster as the main servant is literally everything I could want in an anime. Red Saber as main servant being a close second.</br></br>  Paizuri please<br>the public morals committe pres from Okusama</br>  <br>Not the ones related to Kenkou, though.<br>Which is a shame, considering their designs look appealing, at least.<br> I wonder where Monsterfag went after he took all of those requests that one week.. </br></br></br>  <br><br>CCC can only be done right with Male MC, Gilgamesh, True Route</br></br>  <br> Anime <br>Where is this coming from?</br></br>  <br>Both<br><br>Is it offical, by ZUN? Or just doujinshi?</br></br></br>  <br>Written by ZUN, yeah.<br>There are like 5 dude.</br></br>  <br>Every Fate adaption has Gil. Need some new blood. Caster is the best choice.</br>  <br>Its ZUN approved manga, so its half canon that goes through him but he doesn't personally write it or draw it.<br> unless theres a separate one from the ones I'm thinking of </br></br>  <br> Both <br>Huh, that's odd</br></br>  <br>So it's not wrong, but it's easier to do body proportions differently such as arm length and such?</br>  <br>yeah, the 8 heads tall things doesn't work very well. it was based on the greek belief in the perfect body where all body parts were so and so long, making for some golden ratio of sorts.<br><br>Human bodies are very different, but bones tend to be more or less the same length on average humans. there are of course deviations from the rule, with the kind of guys that are over two meters tall and such. <br>i'd just tell you to go check out some realism refs on human bodies and see where limbs end and what limbs are as long as others until you get a general understanding of how proportions work more or less.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting a gijinka of Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon  <br>Really well made but do you have a normal version?</br>  <br>I'd like this with my waifu. But it'd need to be bigger than that and with bigger balls.</br>  did i come into a /d/ drawthread by mistake? i thought /a/ liked loli and shota, not futas  Touhou is definitely /a/ related.  <br>This shit has been non-stop /h/ and /d/ all day long. <br>I blame Heikatsu.</br></br>  <br> draw a girl with very feminine/petite body <br> "but let's called it a boy!" <br>I fucking hate this meme.</br></br></br>  <br>The feminine cock is what makes it great.

She can probably tell what his fetishes are from that.</br>  <br><br>His porn stash?</br></br>  <br>No the porn she found was their dad's, he watches porn on his phone then deletes it.</br>  <br>Right. Didn't Iroha take his phone in 10.5? I'm sure he covered his tracks though</br>  <br><br>Iroha would probably plant some porn mags in his room and then make a big show about 'discovering' them - and use the opportunity to make him confess to what kind he actually likes</br></br>  <br><br> he covered his tracks though <br><br>There's always a way, anon<br><br>There's always a way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  are the light novels complete?  <br><br><br>I could see her using it as an excuse to mess with the other girls<br><br>"Sempai!

But then again the Anime would've been over after 6 episodes.</br>  <br>Iroha is the hero the girls need, but not the one that they deserve. She is the architect of this romcom; all of her actions are for the purpose of making the girls or 8man take a step forward because they are too beta otherwise.<br><br>Iroha helping Yumiko:<br><br> After noticing Miura, Isshiki bowed to her. Miura nodded back. Isshiki made alternate looks between Hayama and Miura and had a fearless smirk. <br><br> Then, she placed her hands to her mouth and yelled out with a large voice, “Hayama-senpai, doooo your best! <br><br> Miura watched that quietly, but after taking a deep breath in determination, she spat it out along with her voice. “Ha-Hayato… D-Do your best!” <br><br> Her reserved voice was so small that it seemed like it could be drowned out by the cheering voices. But Hayama quietly raised his hand and of course, wore a gentle smile. <br><br> Miura watched that in a trance and slowly nodded without letting out her voice. <br><br> Isshiki watched the both of them in satisfaction. <br><br>Iroha helping double YY/8man:<br><br> “Oh, I can take the picture for you.” <br><br> “Iroha-chan, you should take a picture with us, too.” <br><br> “Yes, by all means, we can afterwards…! But first, let’s take one of everyone in the Service Club.” <br><br> Isshiki firmly refused with a smile and stretched her hand out to Yuigahama. She might’ve been acting considerate in her own way. <br><br>*Iroha decides to use 8man's phone to take the picture*<br><br> “Okay, we’ll go with this,” Isshiki said, winking and promptly readied the phone. This might’ve been Isshiki’s consideration as well. Honestly, I don’t get her at all… <br><br> As I sat there feeling dejected, Isshiki approached me and handed back my smartphone. <br><br> “Here you go, senpai… It’s a good picture,” Isshiki said, wearing a slightly mature smile.  <br><br>Truly a miracle of the universe.<br><br>However, even our dark knight has her limits. And lately, her senpai is being too sly for her and she might not be able to make these kinds of sacrifices any longer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yukino a best  <br>You forgot the secret cookies scene, when Iroha and 8man was watching over Yumiko with smiles on their faces.</br>  <br>Yukino is not genuine</br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>I didn't even know that happened<br> I seriously need to learn moon runes </br></br>    <br>Her love for cats is more genuine and purer than anything in this story.</br>  <br>Cuckino a shit.</br>  <br> implying it's not Iroha who's doing the cucking </br>  <br>I remind Spyro.</br>  <br>Why were his eyes quivering? Was the pain in his knee that intense?</br>  <br>What a shit.</br>  <br>What was Yukino thinking in that moment where they made eye contact?</br>  <br>But I will remind everyone else.</br>  <br>We need a volume from Yui and Yukino's point of views.</br>  <br><br>No<br><br>It was the pain  in his pants </br></br></br></br>  <br> His eyes are like Pan-san's. <br> I wonder if it's a hereditary trait? <br> If I asked nicely, would he dress up as Pan-san? </br></br></br>  <br>I want the entire series from Yukino's pov<br>Watching her fall in love would give my heart a boner</br></br>  <br><br>How wet is she there</br></br>  <br> I wonder if it's a hereditary trait? <br>l-lewd</br></br>  Might need to look at her Pan-san panties to find out.  <br> 8man saw her lime green bra but her panties were covered <br>There's definitely a Pan-san print there.</br></br>  <br> This guy is creepy <br> This guy is creepy <br> He has one or two positive traits, but he is still creepy <br> He is reliable  <br> Why do i even try to do things by myself when I can depend on him to do it for him. <br> Hikigaya-kun is really convenient &lt;3 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe if I kiss him here he'll be mine forever <br> Here I go <br> Ah, he backed away </br></br></br>  <br>He said Yukino, not Iroha.</br>  Yukino dragged everyone down with her shitty drama and not making her feelings clear. She made Hayama suffers from his guilt, she made Haruno suffers (Haruno must bow down to family rules while Yukino roam free), she made her mother suffers from not knowing what she wanted, she made Hiratsuka lifted her hands to deal with her problem, if Hayama still has a lingering affection to her then she also made Miura suffer, she made 8man suffers by not speaking up her mind and almost indirectly sunk her BFF's ship.  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>This. Yuckyno a shit.</br>  <br>Hayama's guilt and suffering was his own doing, Yukino didn't like that he was still feeling guilty after all that time.<br><br>Hiratsuka only decided to help Yukino once she decided to help Hachiman.<br><br>Whatever Hayama may or may not feel is his own doing, and in doing so he is the one hurting Miura not Yukino.<br><br>She made 8man suffer the same way he made her suffer, both are idiots who refused to speak their minds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People hurt one another by just existing in relation to one another</br>  <br>I remind you.</br>  <br>Tell me about it.</br>  <br>Is Minori really the best example?</br>  <br> She is the only girl who's willing to be my friend <br> Better repay her by stealing her crush of 2 years </br></br>  <br>Are you serious? I'm fairly sure that no matter how hard Yui tried, if 8man likes Yukino more than her then she's done. Blame 8man for leading her on for that long.</br>  <br><br><br>At this point I wonder if this isn't all an elaborate meme perpetrated by Irohafags to keep the thread bumped.<br><br><br>References to other romcoms and harems is their bread and butter since they lack compelling plot-relevant evidence to back their ship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how that train of thinking works.<br>Yui had feelings for a long time so suddenly that gives her exclusive rights to pursue a relationship with 8man.<br>Never mind the fact that Yukino didn't even know about Yui's feelings.<br><br>In any case it's an irrelevant issue because relationships aren't based on a point system, they're based on the strength of the connection two people share.<br><br>Also, stop trying to impersonate a Yuifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I too can make comparisons</br>  <br>He's probably the Yuckyno poster<br>He really has nothing better to do, just keep posting best girl</br></br>  What's the whole 8man/pan-san thing supposed to mean?  <br>8man is a fish and cats eat fish though</br>  <br>delusions <br> :^) </br></br>  <br> 8man is want to be a bear <br> Yukino loves Pan-san <br> 8man has Pan-san eyes <br> He is actually the panda <br> He compares Y  umiko  to a panda<br> Miura  end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man is a fish <br> Yukino is a fish <br>Fish end confirmed.</br></br></br>   I'm not as nice as you think I am. <br><br>What did she mean by this?</br></br>  <br><br>Something like this?<br><br> "This disgusting rodent, why did sensei even bring such a vile creature with fish eyes" <br><br> "He's not so bad after all.. he saw through my onee-chan's facade and he's a bit fun to banter with..." <br><br> "I thought we had the same disposition, I made a huge blunder. To think that he said he hated superficiality..." <br><br> "Why can't I do anything? What is this pain in my chest? Is it because of his insidious and superficial solutions that are making my chest hurt or perhaps it's because I can't keep seeing him commit social suicide.. impossible I've never once given heed to him.." <br><br> "I never understood what Hikigaya-kun said today, but still... there's something that tells me I should cling to it tightly.. I feel like unearthing whatever it meant could save me" <br><br> "What is this indescribable feeling I get when I get close to him? I feel uneasy.. my heart pounds at my chest and my thought process gets scrambled.. has he always looked this radiant? I need to define these perturbing feelings.." <br><br>"It's time to stop running, Hikigaya-kun had told me to solve my own problems. There is nothing to hide anymore, with this final request I should end what was wrong from the start"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How pissed would Yukino be to see 8man  holding hands  with Yumiko around school as she bosses him around  and then backs away when he retorts stuttering and mumbling like a cute tsundere. <br><br>How pissed would Hayama be when he realizes he wants genuine and finds that 8man already took it?<br><br>How happy will Ebina be knowing Hikitani is always in close proximity with Tobe thanks to Yumiko making Hikio hang around.<br><br> When will Yui hang herself upon finding out? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What satanic sacrament did Yukino perform to enchant her cookies?<br><br>What effect did the cookies have on 8man?</br></br>  <br>Yui would simply fix the problem by eliminating the source.</br>  So when does 8man dress up as Pan-san and visits Yukino's apartment? We know she'll run into her dear Panda's arms without a second thought before coming to a shocking realization.<br><br>WW is a hack so ripping this off won't be a stretch.</br></br>  <br>I remind THEM.</br>  <br>If he combines White Album 2 and Toradora it's still an original story, I guess.</br>  So who's this girl meant to be?  <br>Who are these girls meant to be?</br>  <br> 8man and Komachi's daughter <br> 8man and Haruno's daughter <br> 8man and Miura's daughter <br> 8man and Iroha's daughter <br> 8man and Ebina's daughter <br> 8man and Hiratsuka's daughter <br> 8man and Yui's daughter <br><br> 8man and Yukino's daughter </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man and Yukino's daughter <br> No ahoge from both families <br><br>Nice try.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man and Hiratsuka's daughter<br>you mean 8man and Meguri's daughter?</br></br>  <br>Do we really need to go over this again?<br/></br>  8man is so tsundere  <br>That wasn't him being tsun, he was embarrassed because Yukino implied she had him by her side now.</br>  <br>Nope, 8man embarrased being third wheel.</br>  <br>I see this scene being used so much <br><br>Let's turn it into a gif</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think he was still feeling nervous about the intense eyefucking from earlier.</br></br>  <br><br>Unonsensual eye fucking.</br></br>  How would Yui have reacted if she saw them during the ride scene?  <br>Platonic you mean.<br><br> Am I the only one watching GDQ right now? </br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't have a reaction for most of since it was just them talking, although Yukino suddenly grabbing on to him was just because Yukino was afraid.<br>There really wasn't anything to misunderstand.</br></br>  <br>125k people and you think no one else here would be watching?</br>  <br>She probably grabbed on to him because she values him as a close friend<br>She said "save me someday" to indicate she wants him to stay by her side platonically for the rest of her life</br></br>  <br>She wants him to save her but she also wants to be the one to save him.</br>  <br>How will Yukino react if 8man finds genuine  with a girl that's not her ?</br>  <br>That's such a stupid question, how would he find genuine like that  if he isn't alive. </br>  <br> implying Yukino would give up if he ends up with another girl <br>she'll respect his boundaries for sure but that doesn't mean she won't tease him and make him give into his desires</br></br>  <br><br><br>All I'm hearing is "Service Club 3P ending is the best option"</br></br></br>  If Hachiman doesnt end with Iroha he will still NTR whoever he gets with with her  <br>That's not Iroha.</br>  <br>You wish, but that wouldn't be genuine.</br>  <br>Genuine cucking is still genuine.</br>  <br>adultery isn't genuine because it involves being dishonest about your feelings.</br>  <br>He's only being dishonest about his feelings with YY, which he doesn't care much about anymore if he's NTR her with Iroha.<br>It's still genuine for the two that care about it.</br></br>  <br>I should have known better than to try and explain genuine to an Iorhafag of all people.</br>  <br> "Hikigaya-kun... I'm only doing this for your sake.. all those succubi have been corrupting your mind.. what's that? I can't hear you.. you only have to suffer a bit more.. nothing shall stand between our eternal love, it's just a matter of time before I take care of all of them. Hopefully the living conditions aren't too bad here in my closet with broken legs, but don't worry Hikigaya-kun.. I'll take care of you forever." </br>  <br>Buzzwords and baits, learn about them.<br>I had a good time - Didn't you?</br></br>  <br>Actually I want to discuss this with you. Is 8man's genuine literally being an honest guy all around and around 100% of the time?<br>Because that is kind of sounding stupid to me, I thought what he wanted was to be with people without forcing his ideas of them on them (which tbh is impossible, else these fucking kids would have solved one of the riddles of philosophy that have been going on for a while)</br></br>  <br>If he cared about Iroha more than them he would be genuine with her like he is with YY<br>He won't care enough about her to fuck her on the side when he has genuine relationship with YY</br></br>  <br>The yandere theme was truly Japan's greatest contribution to the world</br>  <br>I'll throw out one more- no it's not about being honest 100% of the time, but honesty in your relationships with other people is still the heart of the matter.<br><br>I gave up because this particular Irohafag delusion completely defies what genuine is, and  even outright states as much:<br> He's only being dishonest about his feelings with YY <br><br>if 8man wanted to be with Iroha more than one of them, he would never do it without breaking up with Yui/Yukino first, because to do otherwise would be to commit an act that is completely antithetical to 8man's moral code.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And an addendum: 8man has very, very obviously hated relationships based on superficiality and/or lies since long before Genuine, see: his various thoughts on Hayama's group since the first volume.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, no one ever commits NTR with a clear conscience.<br>Therefor, 8man will still NTR whoever he ends with with Iroha.</br></br></br>  <br>okay looks like I REALLY should have known better.</br>  <br>You somehow assume people hold an obligation to what they think.<br>Thats what you would think, but people more often than not are massive hypocrites. As a matter of fact, something to that likeness is what lead to the fucking drama which put Iroha at the front in the series.</br></br>  <br>It's a bit too late to point out bait when you've been biting for the last four or five posts, you know.</br>  <br> put Iroha at the front in the series <br>bait or delusion?</br></br>  <br>I'm just referring to  in particular, since it read like a legitimate post.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>Well, if you are an idiot then maybe not, but those who know what is good took Iroha as their favorite.</br>  <br>Irohafags are the kings of Poe's law, so we may never know.</br>  <br> those who know what is good <br>disloyal sluts are good? alright anon</br></br>  <br><br>But that would be Yui and Haruno. <br><br>Anyways Ill just let one philosopher whom I dislike a lot speak for me here:<br><br> " But she does not want the truth. What does a woman have to do with truth? From the very beginning nothing is stranger, more unfavourable, or more hostile to women than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern appearance and beauty. We men should admit it—we honour and love precisely this art and this instinct in woman, we who have a hard time of it and are happy to get our relief by associating with beings under whose hands, looks, and tender foolishness our seriousness, our gravity and profundity, seem almost silly." <br><br>Good night anon, Iroha is a pearl to a swine like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Be fair anon, Iroha is a good girl. She doesn't deserve to be insulted just because Irohafags are delusional lunatics.<br><br><br> Yui <br> Disloyal <br>Like this sad sack of misfired neurons for instance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am a Yukinofag and I LOVE SUCKING COCKS.  <br>What?</br>  <br>We know, don't worry about it.</br>  <br>That's nice Anon but no one is really interested in your sexual orientation.</br>  <br> Yui <br> disloyal <br>heh<br> Haruno <br>seriously?<br><br>Iroha is a slut, and if the woman from your quote is Iroha, it's basically saying she isn't genuine. How exactly does 8man "deserve" her again? <br><br> Iroha is a pearl to a swine like you <br>I'm swine for sure, but she's barely a pearl if she likes multiple guys, is she? If a slut is a pearl to you then you're delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Average Yukinofag, ladies and gentlemen.</br>  <br><br><br>Nice try, Yuckyno poster</br></br></br>  <br>Joke's on you.<br>Every girl in this show is a fucking dirty slut, with the excepetion of Komachi.</br></br>  <br> Hanging out alone with Taishi <br> Not a slut </br></br>  Who is this sexy beast?  <br>Don't you talk shit about Komachi, bitch.</br>  <br>The fact that Yukino did literally nothing to try and empathize with Yui still proves she's a horrible friend.</br>  <br> empathize with Yui <br>how? the fact that they like the same guy and can't express it is what put them into all this bullcrap, and it's not like Yukino can just back off, it's not genuine.<br><br> why am i even biting the bait </br></br></br></br>  <br>Still don't get this bullshit, who fuckin' cares?</br>  <br>Maybe Yui should have spoken her mind instead like she complained about how Yukino doesn't.<br><br>Yukino didn't know about Yui's feelings until the end.</br></br></br>  Yukino-chan loves Hayato  <br>What the fuck would you even empathize about?<br>Why would Yukino share her feelings about 8man with Yui at all? It would only hurt Yui more if Yukino wins him.</br></br>  <br>It's not genuine so whatever you say is invalid</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128694583 <br>Leave.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128694583 <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Yui and Yukino don't even communicate that intimately sure they've slept at each other's houses and spend a lot of time together but in the end they never really share anything about each other.<br>Hell 8man knows Yukino better than Yui and that's because they actually talk when they're alone.</br></br>  <br> Hell 8man knows Yukino better than Yui and that's because they actually talk when they're alone. <br>Also because he can relate to Yukino more. Yui is somewhat alien to him seeing as how she's a highly social and optimistic genki girl type.</br></br>  <br>So that's somehow Yukino's fault? I'm not sure what you're getting at exactly</br>  <br>No it isn't her fault nor is it really Yui's fault.<br>They just don't try to know each other sure they care about each other but they know nothing about each other.</br></br>   tfw 8man will never realize the right answer <br> why not both, 8man </br>  <br><br><br> “Really? I wanted to know some things though.” <br><br> “Huh? So why—“ <br><br> —didn’t you ask her? I tried to ask, but when I looked at Yuigahama’s profile, my voice withered away. Her expression as she watched Yukinoshita in the distance turn the corner of the hallway was so sincere that I hesitated from going any further. <br><br> “You see, I’m going to wait for Yukinon. I think she’s trying her best to talk to us and get closer to us… That’s why I’m going to wait for her.” <br><br> It was an answer you could expect from Yuigahama. <br><br> Yuigahama would definitely wait. It’s because she had been trying to get closer all this time. Yukinoshita fully understood this and that’s why she was trying to respond back by trying to take a step forward herself. <br><br> “But I won’t wait for people that aren’t going anywhere.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “I do believe that’s the worst part of human nature, though…” Yukinoshita looked disgusted. “Games, huh,” she went on, “they seem beyond my understanding as well.” <br> “Beyond your understanding, you say,” I said. “Yeah, that did show with stuff like the Pan-san game.” <br> “Huh? Pan-san? Why are you suddenly talking about Pan-san?” Yuigahama asked, a blank look on her face. <br> What, so Yuigahama didn’t know Yukinoshita liked Pan-san? Well, rather than saying she liked it, it would be better to call her a freak or a maniac or something, in my opinion. “See, the thing is-” <br> “Hikigaya-kun, what are you talking about?” Yukinoshita cut in, interrupting my sentence in quite an invasive way. <br> “Huh? What are you-?” <br> “I don’t understand what you’re saying, Hikigaya-kun… so fill me in on the details later.” <br> Man, if looks could kill. <br> “Uh, okay…” <br> Somehow, it didn’t look like Yukinoshita really wanted to make a show of how much she liked Pan-san. <br> What? Was she embarrassed? I thought she was fine with being open about it if that was the only thing she liked. And hang on, what was with her fill me in on the details later stuff? Did she want to pump me for information about Pan-san while keeping her love a secret? <br><br>Yui never found out about the Pan-san 8man gave her huh?<br><br><br><br>Problem here is Yui is still now waiting while Yukino already opened up to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm getting mixed signals here. Other than he likes having her whisper in his ear, does she likes him?  <br>I filter cock so why does this appears? Do I also have to put cocks as separate filters?</br>  <br>It's  's fault. Blame the right person, dammit.</br>  <br>Because eventually they're going to figure out which one of them 8man likes more.</br>  <br>Nah Haruno just likes to tease him.</br>  <br>At the end of the day, <br>Yui is still the one who takes the initiative. (Vol.11 Interlude chapter)<br><br>Yukino never made any effort to respond to Yui nor tries to understand Yui.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think  Ryoko  might genuinely likes him?</br>  <br>I think Hachiman needs to be more proactive too. He really hasnt done much to bridge the gap between the girls until Yui saves the day once again.</br>  <br>A significant part of social interaction in today's singles' scene is based around weekend casual sex</br>  <br>Haruno is still pure, angry, and sexually frustrated.<br>She can't do anything that would put bad attention on her daddy.</br></br>  <br>So she only wanted Hikki to know about her pan-san fetish?</br>  I bet WW can't decide who will 8man be paired with.   No new Yahari figs at Wonfes <br>Fucking why?</br>  <br>They aren't fanservice-y enough, except for Yui.</br>  <br> except for Yui <br>Ahem.</br></br>  <br>I want to bury my face into Yukino's washboard</br>  <br><br>http://www.cracked.com/personal-exp<wbr>eriences-1518-6-weird-ways-world-lo<wbr>oks-different-when-youre-asexual.ht<wbr>m</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Kimono figures of this illustration has already been confirmed.</br>  <br>I don't remember her having a washboard, I thought she lived in really nice apartments. <br>I would assume she has a washing-machine or a dry cleaners nearby.<br><br><br>Just reminded me of that lewd elf and passive orc series.<br><br>If I could learn how to draw with a mouse or by a tablet, I'd do a version of Iroha pasting her face on all the girls in his mags.<br><br>And another one with Komachi doing the same thing and leaving a note on top of the stack of mags "You wouldn't masturbate to pictures of your imouto."<br><br><br>Thanks, y-you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is 8man never in the YY promos?</br>  <br>Because marketing, come on now this is obvious.</br>   Mai waifu was a figment of my imagination all along <br>I don't see how anyone could seriously think Yukino could win. The series hasn't been set up for that, simply because it would cause way too much suffering to Yui and would provoke a huge backlash against the author. More importantly, the girl who's helped out 8man throughout the series and supported him wholeheartedly, if wrongly or clumsily at times, wouldn't be the one getting the short end of the stick in your normal harem series.</br>  <br>I'd love a series where characters similar to Miura and Saki are the main heroines.</br>  <br> I don't see how anyone could seriously think Yukino could win. <br>They don't.

Hell, I’m not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano’o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.  <br> battle shonen <br>wrong thread autist</br></br>  <br>Hirano is too busy with evil Jesus to make another Hellsing.</br>  I'm pretty sure that Enel can just create enough volts to kill all the souls in Alucard at once.    <br> name one character that could beat him <br>not<br> name one character from a slice of life or edgy angsty teenager drama show or entry level anime with less than 100 episodes that could beat him </br></br></br>  She gets some really OP cards by the end of the manga, also Clow could easily kill Alucard.  <br>Are his eyes towards his nose or something?</br>  <br> childhood rape <br>She's a bit late for that.</br></br>  <br>Mr. infinity.</br>  Inferno Cop.  <br>The explanation for Hellsing beating Alucard was Alucard wasn't as strong back then due to the Hellsing organization experimenting on him but his old form was stronk as fuck anyway so Van Hellsing was still likely a complete and utter badass. <br><br>But I sorta doubt Van hellsing being completely human since Anderson was a regenerator before he turned into that tree thing and alucard still considered him 'human' so it's all ambiguous.</br></br></br>  <br> Go to rape kiddy vlad <br> "This is a male only boyslut young woman, please try next mosque!" </br></br>  <br>Last time I checked vlad's desire was being beaten by humans (namely: You don't go monster mode.

You could beat him if you talk him into thinking he isn't real. It could work as long he doesn't decide he should just attack you.</br>  <br>bobobo is always the answer.</br>  <br>Unlike Cars, Alucard could improvise propulsion in space from his millions of lives. He could just split off inner lives and throw them in the direction of his momentum to slow himself down and then eventually start propelling himself back to Earth. Schrodinger Alucard would just stop being in space and be on Earth again like it was nothing.</br>  MEoDP is the perfect counter to his immortality and given how much Alucard loves to give his opponents the first hit he's fucked.  <br><br>One Vampire killing vampire against another vampire killing vampire.</br></br>  Beat him in a fight?

How do you say<br><br>To carry something? Does 持っている work?<br><br>Where should i put x?<br><br>Ill go get x.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, the guide says that kanji, vocab, and grammr should be learned at the same time, but I'm a little confused. In Anki, vocab decks use kanji for the words. In order to be able to read those, you'd need to be able to read the kanji. So wouldn't you have to know a fair amount of kanji before you can do vocab? Or am I misunderstanding?  <br>You can learn kanji when they come up in vocab words, you know.</br>  <br>運ぶ means to carry something, especially something heavy.<br><br>Where should I put X?<br>Xをどこに置きましょう？<br><br>I'll go get X.<br>Xを取って来ます。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends. If you mean carry something somewhere it's 運ぶ, but you can't use it for objects that are too small or light like a pen. If you mean simply standing there holding the thing 持つ works.</br>  <br>Im a bit confused about to put. Could you also use 出す for a verb as to put something?</br>  <br>置く literally means put something somewhere. I don't know why you'd want to use anything else. I've never heard 出す used that way.</br>  <br>出す　is for pulling things out, like ちんこを出す</br>  <br>Yeah, that's true.</br>  <br>Oh ok, im just nervous, in japan, when i said x はどこに置くか？ I got a confused look. Is it because i didn't conjugate it into 置きましょう？<br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. けいたいをだ出した</br>  <br>x はどこに置くか? Would be interpreted as "Where are you going to put that?" You should have used 置こう / 置きましょう, or even 置くべき (should put).</br>  Today's hard. Really really hard physically. I don't want to read as much as I normally do tonight after work. Someone call me some names or post cute dekichan please.  <br>So when the verb is in volational form or べき it makes it question personal.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It's just that when you use the non-past form, it doesn't make sense as a question when you are the subject.<br><br>If you were the subject of x はどこに置くか, it would mean you were asking "Where will I put this?" not "Where should I put this?" and that is why you got a weird look. The listener can't tell you where you're GOING to put it, only where he/she wants it put.<br><br>If the listener of x はどこに置くか is the subject, then the question is "Where are you going to put it?" which makes a lot more sense, so they are more likely to interpret it that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Putting か at the end of a non-polite sentence can be pretty rude, and か is usually used with yes or no sentences in casual speech. Most of the other things suggested so far are pretty unnatural<br><br>You want something like どこに置けばいいですか？ or in casual speech even just どこがいい？</br></br>  <br>Hmmm, i thought you could be more relaxed with that rule, but i guess not.</br>  <br> I got to study being more polite.</br>  <br><br>Would something like ほうがいいかな sound dumb as well?</br></br>  wow my reading improved a lot. Don't give up at beginner reading hell. You can do it!  <br>ほう implies a comparison between two things, so yes.</br>  <br>I started Yotsuba today. I'm reading it fairly slowly and referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate. It makes me feel really dumb at times when I'm completely wrong or don't really understand a line (especially when it's adults talking), but it's still a major step up from the incomprehensible scribbles it was before I started Japanese.</br>  <br> referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>Don't do this, man.</br></br>  <br><br>Why not?</br></br>  <br>By translations, I mean the Yotsuba reading pack, a translated version of Yotsuba (just as a general idea of what the line was about if I was completely stumped), and sometimes checking the archive to see if anyone else was confused about a line in particular. I'm mostly just using it as "training wheels" so to speak and plan to stop using it after the first volume or so. Are the translations really that wrong? Or is there something wrong with checking the translation on lines that stump you?</br>  <br> guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>If you're just guessing and have no faith in its accuracy then you should probably study some more before you read. Especially if you're doing it after each page, seriously. <br><br>Because you're basically doing the equivalent of learning from anime subs. You're enforcing in your mind someone else's specific english rendition of the text as what is correct instead of understanding the japanese on its own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to do this. It's great at first when you're but don't get used to only doing it. The translation isn't always there. Try going a couple of pages without it for reference. Don't listen to the haters, its great to get started.<br><br><br>I prefer Hanahira as my first reading material, since you have a text hooker you spend little to no time referencing vocab you don't know so you can focus on reading more. Also it has voice acting which is really nice and useful</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AcE<wbr>29niMLEs</wbr>  [ ]<br>Watch this<br>They go to a ハーフ会<br>This is what your kids are going to be like</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about よつばと translation since I never actually read it in English,<br>I doubt it's terribly inaccurate since the language used in it is pretty basic, but you can never be sure with translations. <br>Worst thing about this method is that it keeps you thinking in terms of Japanese to English translation, when your goal here is just understanding Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br> implying any of us will have kids </br>  <br>to add to this, i didn't have much vocab when i started reading, so i was constantly looking up words i knew but didn't know i knew, and the same words over and over again. Doing this significantly slowed me down and i was exhausted after 10 sentances. What i did to fix this was i signed up for LingQ, self-refered myself several times, and read "who was she". until i got used to reading. When i went back to Hanahira i was blazing through it compared to my old speed.<br><br>its really situational, but it's what got me through the beginner reading wall. I've never noticed such a huge improvement in a couple of days before.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you be under the impression that I want to impregnate a Japanese person?</br>  <br>Kill yourself, nigger.</br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>I tried doing that first, but text hooker didn't pick up a lot of the slang/slurred words and the archive wasn't much help for a lot of the lines I was having trouble with, so I decided to step back and do a couple volumes of Yotsuba first and then maybe try Flyable Heart after that in hopes that that has slightly less slang/slurred words.<br><br><br>It's mostly a self confidence issue if I'm honest. What I think the sentence is / is about is right most of the time, but I still feel the need to check anyways just in case I'm wrong.<br><br><br>I'm trying not to translate into English, I'm pretty much just using the translation as a rough guideline to see what the page/conversation was to see if I was following it well in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a weeaboo that can't do anything except shitpost and project like a son of a bitch.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up.

People here generally don't know or have experience with doing such and so they lash out when people ask such questions. <br><br>For speaking practice one of the best ways of getting corrections is to look for a conversation partner/tutor. If you live in an urban area you may be fortunate enough to find people advertising Japanese tutoring by natives at a per hour rate. With a bit of preparation these sorts of encounters could be used to get a whole heap of answers to questions which come to mind during study, and to get speaking practice with someone who will stop you and provide actual corrections. <br><br>italki and mylanguageexchange are decent online resources but it's a bit of a gamble. Shadowing audio from text is also a powerful tool for getting your mouth used to making Japanese sound like Japanese and can be like a wading pool of sorts to build confidence before speaking with natives/unscripted. There are plenty of websites with text/audio for basic conversations, etc. Jpod101 is great for this as their audio lessons come with a transcript with vocab and grammar points. There are gigs worth of lessons in the CoR. <br><br>If your reading is okay enough there are also a range of audio texts in the CoR under Japanese !L-R.

He Cant even die. He can literally just leave crumb size pieces of his body somewhere and regenerate from that in a few seconds. Punches don't work, energy blasts blast through him and he is like "whatever". Even the biggest spirit bomb in the series almost failed.  <br>The problem with Buu is that he was literally just a retreading of Cell.<br><br> he can regenerate! <br> he knows our attacks! <br> he absorbs people! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Cell was clearly getting hurt and tired as he fought. Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once.</br>   Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once. <br><br>Just like Cell. And my point wasn't really about power it was more how buu wass cell: pink edition.</br></br>    <br>Buu is more like an improved Cell. Cell cant absorb people as he pleases, he had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids, while Boo absorb powers are limitless. And Cell actually can take blows unlike Buu which ends up absorbing the blows too with his elastic body.<br><br>Anyways the real enemies in DB are the saiyans, if they could stop beeing self centered assholes and protect the earth as they should they could have avoided the births of Cell and Boo to begin with. Maybe even Freeza, without the Namek battle, eventually Vegeta could have achieved SS to slap Freeza's shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Buu can actually reform from atomic particles. No cells needed. If Buu is even made of cells like a normal thing.</br>  <br> Could Vegito reach Super Saiyan 3 <br>In my country, it was translated that he's Super Saiyan 10</br></br>  Demonbane is the strongest DBZ character. Demonbane is the strongest everything.<br><br>Demonbane is love, Demonbane is life</br></br>  <br>Dandy already defeated Demonbane in an infinite number of universes.</br>  <br>How exactly?</br>  <br>Because Dandy exists in a Universe of every possibility, and in the universes Dandy loses to demonbane his mind just changes universes.</br>  No because Vegeta cant  <br> Saiyains being anything more than a proud warrior race.  <br><br>The mere thought is blasphemous.</br></br></br>    <br>Vegeta is weak anyway he cannot goes SSJ3 when trunks and gotenks can. So in multiplier coefficient vegeta is much weaker than gotenks and trunks.</br>  <br>Why goku is combine with vegeta. goten and trunks are muchstronger. They can go ssj 3 while vegeta only can reach SSJ 2 at most.</br>  <br><br><br>This thread got real Brazilian real quick.</br></br></br>  <br>Right back at you african nigger faggot.</br>  <br><br>Are you coming onto me?</br></br>  <br>Are you a racist white pig?</br>  <br><br>I'll be whatever you want me to be</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Good for you then Now you can go back to your cage.</br>  <br>Only if you come in here with me and throw away the key.<br><br>The suns coming up but that don't mean the fun's gotta stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Source? That's too fucking powerful. <br><br>I don't give a fuck, that must be Beerus level</br></br></br>  <br>  implying SSJ 3 fusion is strong <br>Just look how weak is gotenks.</br></br>  <br>Gogeta can probably defeat beerus too. He is not yet face any goku fusion related until now.</br>  <br>Neither kid had reached SSJ3 alone, and they were the dance fusion. Potara is stronger, Vegeta and Goku are stronger, and Goku has already mastered SSJ3.<br><br>Doesn't compare.</br></br></br>  <br>  asumption <br>It's just your asumption without proof. IN FACT There is no difference betwen going SSJ 3 in fusion or in normal state.</br></br>  <br>Post the assumption in my post.<br><br>Dance fusion drains Ki, hence the time limit. Potara multiplies both users energy while creating greater endurance. The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito, they'd just be shaving a few years off their life due to the immense pressure. That's far stronger than only keeping up the form for a few minutes.</br></br></br>  <br> Post the assumption in my post. <br>All your post is assumption!<br> The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito <br>Source and Wat?<br><br>Vegitto power level is just in your fanfic. Actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring. Pottara power in your post is just merely fanfiction because in fact the power is not strong. look how buu can dispell pottara earring and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito. The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. And the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>one advantage cell has it that he has the hax sayian ability of getting stronger every time you almost die. and since he can regenerate from a single cell, its a pretty OP ability for the most part.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because there's a new Dragon Ball anime out?</br>  <br>  cannot use genki dama again <br>I don't think vegitto is a best move since he cannot use his strongest attack and the strongest attack in all dbz warrior. There is no attack that known can kill buu ultra regeneration and many other main villains regeneration except genki dama.</br></br>  <br>Probably, but at this point it would be better to go Super Cyan since both halves know it and it's most likely stronger than SSJ3</br>  <br>Trunks and Goten can't go SSJ3, but Gotenks can.</br>  <br>You can't be that stupid</br>  <br>There is no single proof that both goten or trunks cannot go ssj 3. and there is no proof that the fusion can change your level even 1 level higher than the state of the fusioner.</br>  Can two fused people fuse? Like, can Gogeta and Gotenks fuse to make Gogetanks?  <br>  stupid answer <br>You cannot be that idiot. fuck off newfag.</br></br>  Whose idea was it to design the most powerful being in the known universe as a flaming gay man?  <br>it cannot. fusion also cannot be done when they're not in sync both power level and dance. The height also will be a problem sync it will make the dance harder.</br>  <br> implying vegito wont reach SSJG at some point in super </br>  <br>  sync <br> since it will make the dance harder to be synchronized. </br></br>  Bernkastel can easily destroy DBZ for fun  <br>Everything you said is so off that I simply feel sorry for you to be that retarded. Go educate yourself, summer fag</br>  <br> cannot bring any proof <br>Go away idiot newfag. Your idiocy in this thread has made me cry. Go cry a river somewhere and bring your BULLSHIT! fanfic with you.</br></br>  <br>  crying because nobody believe his fanfic theory </br>  <br><br>Because we're not allowed to make Naruto threads.</br></br>  <br> He had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids <br>Super Perfect Cell says otherwise.</br></br>  So I just started DB: Super and decided to also watch the movies that came out before it, regardless of whether they'll be canon or not.<br><br>Finished Battle of Gods but am having trouble finding a torrent for Resurrection F. Am I missing something? I thought it has been out for a while now.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about all that, but  Vegeta is undefeated against Goku .</br>    so bog isn't canon anymore because super overrides it right?  <br> actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring.  <br>Two weak gods fuse and are still weak. What a suprise<br> look how buu can dispell pottara earring <br>Buu had no idea that they would defuse inside of him. He ate them as last thing he could do against Vegito.<br> and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito <br>He did not want to kill Buu as Piccolo, Gohan and kids were still inside of him<br> The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. <br>I don't even, are you that stupid?<br> and the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power. <br>And again, you are wrong. By eating someone way stronger than Buu, you mean easilly? He ate Veggito only becouse he had to rescue z fighters inside of Buu, nothing else.<br><br>I know that this is bait, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. It's weird also because super takes place 6 month yes some years in the future where BoG takes place videl has not gave birth to pan.</br>  <br>BoG was never canon in the first place. Super actually has a right to that claim (with the manga by AT even if he isn't drawing it). RoF is next on the list of shit to be 'retconned' (while not being canon to begin with).</br>    <br><br><br>Are you both stupid?<br><br>Videl has not given birth to Pan yet. Not in Battle of Gods, nor in Super.<br><br>Let's say she got pregnant after Z (after the fight with Boo she and Gohan got sexytime). Less than 9 months have passed until Resurrection of Frieza since Pan is not born.<br><br>That epilogue from DBZ is years down the line. I think 3 or 4 years after Z?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, up until Super both new movies were canon. It's just that they eventually decided a new series would bring better profits and now we have Super.</br>  <br>  assumption <br> IN FACT he cannot defeat buu. <br>  IN FACT the earring is dispelled instantlyinside boo's body. he doesn't even try <br>  IN FACT kaioshiin pwer level is thousands times stronger than frieza <br>  IN FACT kibito has superior skill in speed and healing ability than Goku  <br>And yet he still a weakling!<br>Are you idiot?<br>Bringing you masturbation fanfic theories won't bring you far, idiot newfag.<br><br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ3 is easy for fusions.</br>  <br>You're dumb. BoG was written by another in a Toei film set in the anime continuity. AT's rewrite was only ever advisory in nature. This is the real deal. RoF had some room for arugment, BoG didn't. Super is a clear case (not the anime though).<br><br><br>And you're dumber. What are you prattling on about, boy? None of that addresses the most important question of all.  When will Vegeta beat Goku again for 3-0 ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>and shit for everyone else</br>  <br>AT completely rewrote most of it to serve his own intentions, so what the original writer did hardly matters. The only thing left over was god of destruction vs super saiyan god. Unless you think Super isn't canon because AT is still using that writer's ideas.</br>  <br>The Super manga is an abridged adaptation of the anime story, so it's not canon if that's what you're implying.</br>  <br><br>You won. Your stuppidy is overhelming. It's like talking to wall.</br></br>  <br> most <br>Not his story. Not his characters. Not even his final say.<br><br> Super <br>Entirely his take on things (as already noted). He can do with it as he pleases (as seen in the manga thus far).<br><br><br> blue hair Bulma <br> five finger Pickle Man <br>Anime-continuity is not canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only 3 of those are Dragon ball threads, the others are just using DB picture.</br>  <br>The epilogue is 10 years after Buu. Pan is 4 years old and Uub is 10 years old during it.</br>  <br>I honestly think Toriyama is a faggot<br><br> Magna with 99% shredded men fighting each other as their clothes gets destroyed through every battle. <br> Zero relevant female characters <br> Always a fucking gay guy added, in every. fucking. arc. <br> Whis is the most powerful being in the universe by leaps and bounds <br> Cant write female characters to save his fucking life. <br><br>I love Dragon Ball but hes fucking gay man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The writer wanted beerus to be a completely evil lizard-man and the character designer wanted SSG to be like a sort of mix between SS3 and SS4. AT got his way on both fronts. In the end, it was a collaborative effort, but AT's push was far greater than anyone else.<br><br>Then nothing about it is canon. I don't think AT has anything to do with the manga. He's writing the scripts for the anime, and it's likely the manga writer gets the same scripts and does his more abridged version.</br></br></br>  <br>  cannot into math <br>Are you stupid?<br>It's stated that BoG film takes place several YEARS after kid buu defeat. it takes more than 3 years after the even of super to be precise. so in three years the baby should have been born.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain carefully why, in the movie, Beerus wakes up from a 40 year long nap, dreaming about a Super Sayain God, and immediately undertakes a trip to locate it, going first to King Kai's world, then Earth.<br><br>While in Super, he spends the first episode already awake, out in space, eating space cuisine made by space chefs, and then blowing up half their planet.<br><br>The facts don't add up mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stuppidy <br>Right back at you, stupid newfag.</br></br>  <br> Toriyama called Battle of Gods a continuation of the manga <br> Called Resurrection F a sequel to Battle of Gods <br> Gave tbe idea for the cartoon of Dragon Ball Super, upon which the comic is an adaptation <br> You're still tryung to say that the movies are non canon and that Toyotaro's comic is canon <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good you admit defeat. Forcing your masturbation theory with your delusion fact won't get you anywhere and going nowhere.</br>  <br>But Whis and Beerus are canon now, and they are stronger than Vegetto</br>  <br>It's retconned by super and become non canon or filler now.</br>  <br>Sounds like the first episode of super takes place after he wakes up, but before her gets to Earth / King Kai's place. Maybe he got hungry on the way?</br>  <br>If he is already full why in the heck he still feeling hungry on earth like a starvation person and being edgy revengefull bitch because of food.</br>  <br>It's completely different and disconnected from the movie.</br>  <br>He's really REALLY hungry? I mean, the Buu saga did happen. Let's not pretend Toriyama is Shaskespear or some shit.</br>  <br>Retards don't know how to use a catalog. Dragon Ball needs to be purged and blacklisted on the same level as Narutards</br>  <br><br>The dialog in movies told otherwise and whis transformation skill said to be the fastes on universe. I think beerus has no time changing his mind in faster teleportation skill than goku's instant transmission. The speed literally instant. he logic doesn't add up. You're day dreaming.</br></br>  <br> AT gets say in another guy's script <br>Not his story. Super is.<br><br> in the end it wasn't AT's story <br>Good chat.<br><br><br>BoG didn't happen.<br><br><br> AT said <br>AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon. BoG wasn't his story. He has now made it his own with Super.<br><br> tbe <br> tryung <br>You what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Potara, probably. The difference in heights would prove an obstacle to the fusion dance though</br>  <br>The fact that he jumped into it half-way does not negate that he made it his own while still using the base elements. He's still currently using those elements and has based the entire start of the series around them, so it's sort of silly to harp on that. It was completely canon until Super and would have remained so had they continued doing movies.</br>  <br>but then theyd be weak so no reason do that</br>  <br>The dvd/bluray for RoF doesn't drop until October. There won't be any good encodes or subs for the movie until then. However, the movie premieres English dubbed in US theaters next week.</br>  <br>Really- really hungry but stop eating before get full? when he is act like a spoiled god that want his wish granted even the wish is illogical and forced other to believe his delusion and dream. he literally forcefull against stupid things but choosing to become desireless on his needs and hobby on eating.</br>  <br> does not negate that <br>It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon).<br><br> canon until <br>It was never canon. Super has taken that movie trash and made it canon trash. Rejoice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's neither here or there, Anon was asking whether it was possible, which it is.</br>  <br>You have a silly definition of canon then. The movies were canon as according to AT half-writing one and fully writing the next. The anime is now canon due to his writing superseding the movies.. That's it.</br>  <br>no its never shown possible and FACT is that its weak so cant be done... stop your fanfic newfag</br>  <br>I think it's interesting that with the inclusionary SJW enviornment we have in America nowadays, Toriyama managed to drop tons of gay characters all over his manga, and it never felt forced, and it was never treated like a special thing. It's kind of hard to find in other shows, all portrayals of homo characters are either yuribait or fujoshi bait in Japan, or sjw pandering in America.</br>  <br> It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon). <br><br>AT has a less active role in Super than in the movies though, which is why we're getting filler characters in Super. <br><br>He just made the plot outline for Super, while with the movies he was either tweaking the final script itself (BoGs) or actually writing the script (RoF).<br><br><br> AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon.  <br>He said that he saw it like making a new story for the manga, that's the closest thing you can get to "canon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In rof has much more filler than super now. Jaco and some random shits. Super is retconning the 2 movies tho</br>  <br>Potara can fuse a dead man and a living one together with no complications, so two fusion beings fusing probably wouldn't be an obstacle</br>  <br>wat please speaketh gooder enrigsh my brothser</br>  <br>It's not half writing if his name is nowhere credited as the writer. You're deluding. Nips has admitted at as not thewriter of bog since long ago an some interviews.</br>  <br>I'm using small phone with jumpy touchscreen, gay faggot.</br>  <br><br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>Probably yeah. But he was stronger than the strongest SuperBoo (with gotenks and gohan absorbed) without even being a supersaiyan. (well if you go by the manga just being a regular super saiyan). No need to even go SSJ2.</br>  <br>Vegitto is in fact weak and has no kill number. Only masturbated fans think otherwise.</br>  <br> the anime is now canon <br>Anime-only scum, please.<br><br><br> he didn't call anything canon <br>This is true. Thus, we default to his authentic works. Like Super (not BoG, DBO, etc.).<br><br><br>Get good, nerd.<br><br><br>That sounds like anime talk.<br><br> SSJ2 <br> J <br>There's no "J" in Super Saiyan, friend. You're speaking English, so let's not pretend you're referring to "Saiya-Jin" (unnecessary to denote them as people anyway). As for boat talk, it ain't "S.S." and boats aren't exactly common in the show (much less those of the sunken variety). No excuses, weeb.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He mostly CANNOT become SS because pottara fusion mostly has the same power like mystic transformation. It's logical because mysic is suprem kai technique the owner of all those pottara rings.</br>  <br>Vegito appearance like mystic appearance. He cannot go any further.</br>  <br> It's logical because mysic is suprem kai technique the owner of all those pottara rings. <br>It's not though. The unlock potential comes from the witch that fused with Supreme Kai, it's not a Supreme Kai specific ability.</br></br>  <br> every single interview basically talks about how much AT changed and contributed <br> they didn't call him the writer so he did shit and all that was made up <br><br><br>AT is writing for the anime. The manga is an adaptation of it and has nothing to do with AT, so, yes, the anime is canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fused people in pottara skill and everything become one. No separated skill, read more. It has been more than 75 million years after he fused.</br>  Went to /a/ to read anons bickering about power levels, I am now satisfied.  <br>Git gud newfag and read more interview. Or googling.</br>  <br>I cant googling because I aming english worse</br>  <br>Potentially, he could get to SSGSSJ given his two parts reached that level.<br><br>As for who's the canonically strongest character, we dont really know since they never stated how Vegetto would fare against Bills and Whiss. Whiss said that if Goku and Vegeta teamed up they could take on Bills in SSJGSS so Vegetto in that level could hypotetically beat him but we dont know.<br><br>Top 5 would be Bills, Whiss,Vegetto, Goku and Vegeta but we dont know the proper order. There's also Champa and his assistant who may be about as strong as Bills and Whiss.</br></br></br></br></br>  of course he can  <br>Vegitto only last very2 short time frame to be even judged has good endurance and power. There is high chance vegitto power is like ssj3. A mere transformation that last no long or mistyc.vegitto cannot use genkidama he is much weaker in terms of skill and technique. Goku with genkidama is factually stronger because the skill can kill ultra regenerative beings.</br>  <br>How would Vegetto get to SSG? I'm sorry I haven't watched Resurrection F so I'm not sure if they found away around the requirement of 5 other saiyans. With Vegeta and Goku combined, they would be short 1. <br><br>If they wanted to fight Bills or Whiss, they'd have to pick either SSGSSJ Goku or SSJ Vegetto. Who's stronger?<br><br>I can't help myself I love these threads!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegitto cannot use genki dama the only skill that is matter. He is shit though.</br>  <br> bah </br>  <br>lrn2 english<br><br> here is high chance vegitto power is like ssj3 <br>A mere fusion ssj is stronger than ssj3 Goku and Vegetto is stated to be way more powerful than conventional fusion. It also has been stated in databooks that Potara's power increase is exponential so it's at least as strong as GokuxVegeta. SSJ3 only multiplies your base power by 400, Vegeta has much more than that.<br><br> Goku with genkidama is factually stronger  <br>No, he really isnt.<br><br><br> How would Vegetto get to SSG? <br>Both fusees can get there.<br><br> I'm sorry I haven't watched Resurrection F so I'm not sure if they found away around the requirement of 5 other saiyans.  <br>Its shown in BoG that Goku can transform in SSG on his own., you only need the ritual once.<br>And Vegeta can also do it.<br><br> either SSGSSJ Goku or SSJ Vegetto. Who's stronger? <br>As I said, they havent said so.<br><br><br>lrn2 english</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not knowing genki dama. Owh such a newfag faggot is here.<br>Please if you don't understand english you need to stop posting instead of being whiny faggot.</br></br>  <br>Using non canon material. Owh you are such a misguided newfah. Pls fuck off.</br>  <br>dragon ball multiverse is pretty good br/a/h</br>  <br> non canon <br> written by Toriyama </br></br>  <br>Using non canon and contradictive material. How pleb you can be newfag.</br>  <br>Super is hardly going to change anything important from the movies.</br>  <br>Goku himself felt that he wouldn't be able to match a supressed Bills even if he fused with Vegeta. and although potara fusion is stronger it's fair to assume it's not that big of a difference to matter.</br>  <br>No you pleb newfag all guid books has more than often contain contradicting information and false information. And a lot of them is not writen or even be touched by toriyama, pleb.</br>  <br> contradictive material <br>YOu mean like the original manga?<br><br><br> Goku himself felt that he wouldn't be able to match a supressed Bills even if he fused with Vegeta. <br>He didnt say so. Also, there's a huge difference between potara and fusion.<br><br><br>  more than often contain contradicting information and false information <br>If that's enough to diss them, then the original manga is not canon I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retconning is still retconning how small it is. Hypotheticaly talking if the difference is not a lot.</br>  <br>Yea right. All power level after vegeta saga is non canon.it is common sense.</br>  <br> it is common sense <br>So characters arent powerful after Vegeta saga?</br></br>  <br> still going on about some other guy's story <br>BoG was never canon. Super is. Deal with it. You kids need to stop falling for this sort of shit (like with DBO and all the other crap in recent history).<br><br> anime is canon <br>Anime continuity isn't canon.<br><br><br>The movies have never been canon. That continues to be the case, boy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must be reading about db doujinshi or fanfic because that is not even possible</br>  <br>Original manga is canon but not your shitty fanfic merchandise guidebook.</br>  <br>but you not understand the genkidhama most important part vegeto only there for short time beaten by buu easy becuz and fusion seperated so he weak and cannot beat bil</br>  <br>true</br>  <br> BoG was never canon. <br>It was, and we can still use it until Super shows something different.<br><br> Anime continuity isn't canon. <br>so Super isnt?<br><br><br>What do you mean?<br><br><br>Why? Because you say so?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not numbered without scouter fkn newfag. It's obvious</br>  <br>That's like saying distances didnt exist before units to measure them were made.</br>  Why does Vegito look so much more like Goku than Vegeta?<br><br>Its like Goku but wearing different clothes</br></br>  <br>It's because this is not create your own random theory for each masturbator fans theory wet dream theory.</br>  <br>Yes it did not. Congratulation to become a bit less ignorant.</br>  If two pairs of characters did the fusion dance, could the resulting fusion characters then also do the dance to fuse with each other? So a four person fusion basically? And if so, then how deep does this rabbit hole go?  <br>  create your own canon disregard the manga contradiction </br>  <br>Exactly. Good thing I'm not doing that and I'm based on facts.<br><br><br>So cavemen could be instantly everywhere?<br>Neat, we really need to d o that again.<br><br><br>Nothing has been stated on the matter, so why not?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You wat m8</br>  <br>genkidhama not real but because vegito real it okay because majin buu not strong but stronger then vegeto read the manga not make your own masturb fan theory newfag ok</br>  <br>Yes and your shitty bait for your retarded masturbatory theory you think will be accepted by your retarded and false assumption. No faggot. You are just one of misguided non canon fanfic theory plebs.</br>  power levels<br>Whis&gt;=SSJ4 Gogeta&gt;Beerus&gt;=SSJ4&gt;SSG&gt;SSGSS&gt;Vegit<wbr>to&gt;Gohan&gt;everyone else</wbr></br>  <br>You and your retarded assumption. You probably needs to learn english before posting let alone making logical assumptions.</br>  <br>If you are being genuine, you must be heavily autistic. Probably Chinese as well.</br>  <br>You must be an idiot cavemen.</br>  <br>They never said how SSJ4 fares compared to the new canon ones, YOu're missing the GT villains, Hildegan and Buu with Gotenks and Gohan in there. <br><br>They also never said how Vegetto fares against Bills and Whiss<br><br> SSG&gt;SSGSS <br>Are you mentally challenged?<br><br><br> You probably needs to learn english <br> You probably needs <br><br><br><br>I think its bait, but hardcore dragon ball are very autistic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  assumption <br>Comparations</br></br>  <br> was <br>Not.<br><br> can use until <br>No. You can't.

It's not clear if it's dance or potara, but considering how only the potara was used in the series most people assume it was potara.</br></br>  <br>Nope. Super manga has nothing to do with anything. AT is not writing it, and he is not writing for it. He's writing for the anime.</br>  <br>SSG&gt;SSGSS <br>this has been stated, SSGSS is just turning ssj after retaining a small part of SSG</br></br>  <br> the anime <br>Anime continuity is not canon. Piccolo doesn't have five digits, boy-o. Didn't you read the manga?</br></br>  <br> From two kids who had SSJ1 but no really much power to a SSJ3 at the level of Super Buu, way stronger than Goku SSJ3 <br> Weak </br></br>  <br>It's just an asspained BR. You can tell it's just bait too, consider he replies to the same post more then once.</br>  <br>  grammar smart ass </br>  <br> Not. <br>Yeah, its was written by the original author of the franchise before super was a thing. <br><br> You can't. It would need to be canon for that, sport. <br>When super changes shit, then we'll talk.<br><br> Super's manga is in the manga continuity as it stands <br>The super manga is a secondary product to shill the main one which is the show, it's not intended to be canon.<br><br><br> hey said that fusion wouldn't be enough against Beerus. <br>They didnt.<br><br><br>No, not really, are you high anon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  These canon debates only expose one thing: The people in charge of the series don't think in terms of canon. Both the movies and the new TV series are official productions with Toriyama credited as the source for the story. The difference is that moving forward into the Universe 6 arc, Super's version of the events are the only ones that matter in this continuity. That doesn't invalidate Battle of Gods or Revival of F, it just means those movies don't apply when it comes to Super's continuity. You all are taking this fanmade concept of canon too seriously when it just doesn't register with the people in charge of making new developments in the series.  <br>It doesn't matter what the anime adds or doesn't add. It's either canon or it isn't. The manga is an adaptation, i.e. secondary material based off of another like the DB andime DBZ anime are to the DB manga. It has no meaning anywhere.</br>  <br>You can cry a river white pig kid. Sorry to hurt your bubble that your masturbated theory only be accepted in your wet dreams.</br>  The very nature of the SSJG ritual is more than enough to prove it is stronger than a potara fusion since it is a combination of powers between 5 saiyans and multiplied by an unknown number.<br><br>Gohan Vegeta and Goku at that point were clearly above the SSJ3 Gotenks who could have finished off Super Buu, the sum of their powers alone would be more than enough to match base Vegetto back in the day.</br></br>  <br>Toriyama is not credited as the writer for bog anywhere, though.</br>  <br>It matter in the cases where the material ignores established concepts in other areas. RoF completely invalidates anime filler and GT due to its treatment of hell. If Super keeps along the same lines, that makes it unable to be included in the same timeline as well. The two movies can be considered sort of the opposite of movies that summarize arcs.</br>  <br>or you know, you could just kill yourself?</br>  <br>  fanmade concept of canon  <br>Its not fanmade. <br><br>And yeah, you're right about the rest. Doesnt mean there's no canon, it means they dont care. It also doesnt mean people should be so retarded that they end up thinking their fanwank is relevant.<br><br><br> The very nature of the SSJG ritual is more than enough to prove it is stronger than a potara fusion since it is a combination of powers between 5 saiyans and multiplied by an unknown number. <br>It really isnt.<br><br> the sum of their powers alone would be more than enough to match base Vegetto back in the day. <br>No, fusion is addition and more. Vegetto is exponential, so GokuxVegeta and more, its way stronger than usual fusion.<br><br><br><br> RoF completely invalidates anime filler and GT due to its treatment of hell.  <br>Rof "invalidates" GT because GT was never canon and RoF is made by the original author. Specific details like hell doesnt matter since dragon ball was never consistent to being with.<br><br>Heck, ROF contradicts how hell is stated to be in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really gt has always have been canon because no story retelling gt timeline and gt is official continuation of the dbz anime, though.</br>  <br> Vegetto is exponential, so GokuxVegeta and more <br>There is no canon source that proves that, his showing in the manga where he needed to go SSJ2 to match a character who was at best 2 times the strenght of a SSJ3 fusion shows that the boost is not so high as you claim.</br></br>  <br> SSJ2 <br><br>What? Vegito only went Super Saiyan against Buu. He only got SS2 in Heroes.</br></br></br>  <br>  judging some material canon using non canon material. <br>Oh, whatever</br></br>  <br>When responding to the notion that they don't care about canon, it is an important distinction that they are clearly abandoning any direct connection to stuff like GT and anime filler. I don't think we've gotten an explanation on what Frieza is doing in hell in RoF, but it could be something as easy as that he either cannot be recycled or powerful people take time to be recycled.</br>  <br> There is no canon source that proves that, <br>Yeah, databooks. Its also stated on the manga that Potara is waaay bigger than fusion.<br><br><br> he needed to go SSJ2 to match a character who was at best 2 times the strenght of a SSJ3 fusion <br>He didnt need to go SSJ2 tho, he was stronger in normal.<br><br><br>The manga put some electricity on his transformation, that's why he thinks its ssg2.<br><br><br>Good thing I didnt do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Electricity is the indication that he was SSJ2.</br>  <br> SSJ2 <br><br>Nigga you what? He only got that last year.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't Vegito only just get SSJ2 in that arcade game?</br></br>  <br>Databooks are not official or supervised by toriyama.</br>  <br> implications as sentences <br>Curious.<br><br> super <br>Proper noun.<br><br> we'll talk <br>I'll (continue to) gloat. You'll be silent.<br><br> the show <br>Anime continuity.<br><br><br> anime doesn't matter <br>Just so.<br><br><br> the movies <br>Aren't canon.<br><br><br> databooks <br>These boys never learn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegetto not have ssj2 nor genkidhama he is not as strong as you guys think but not ssj2 which is why hes not as strong like super buu who beat him easily</br>  <br>So Super isn't canon and the original DB manga is the only canon then. Good to know.</br>  <br> anime isn't canon <br>Now you're getting it.</br></br>  <br> Vegetto <br> SSJ2 <br> Canon <br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> are not official <br>You dont know what official means.<br><br> or supervised by toriyama. <br>So? They were an official manga guide. Seriously, the only franchise people dont accept this is dragon ball.<br><br><br> I'll (continue to) gloat. You'll be silent. <br>So you know the future then?<br><br> Anime continuity <br>So?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I cant accept something that isnt the original manga <br>This iw why I hate the DB fanbase.</br></br>  <br>It's either anime is canon or Super as a whole is not canon. There are no other choices. The manga is irrelevant.</br>  <br> He didnt need to go SSJ2 tho, he was stronger in normal. <br>You have no proof for that, anime version where he matches Buuhan is just filler. and if you're going to use filler you'd only end up making Buuhan much weaker in the end because SSJ3 Goku managed to stall him.</br></br>  <br> know <br>That you forgot a comma? Yes, I noticed.<br><br> so <br>What more need be said?<br><br><br> iw <br>You what?<br><br><br> source material is irrelevant <br>Anime-only, pls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  how did it come to this? how did vegeta became a better family man than goku?  <br>Do you really not understand that the Super manga is not the source? The anime was made well beforehand. Just because the manga started publishing first as an advertisement does not mean it is the source. The first X episodes of the anime are already quite done, while the manga has yet to be drawn past the next upcoming chapter.</br>  <br>This<br><br><br> You have no proof for that <br>YOu have no proof on the otherwise.<br><br><br> That you forgot a comma? Yes, I noticed. <br>I really didnt, lrn2 english, seriously.<br><br>Official means "licensed product of the franchise" it doesnt mean "canon". Both Evolution and GT are official.<br><br> What more need be said? <br>You know, what I said after that, but that would require reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>super buu was getting tired fighting vegito though no? vegito was hitting him without blowing up part of his body or dealing massive hits, so super buu wasnt regenerating, couldve finished him but wanted to revive the others trapped inside afaik</br>  <br>He is credited in several interviews and official publications promoting the movie. Watanabe wrote the original script, brought it to Toriyama so he could look it over and edit it, and Toriyama ended up scrapping most of the content and rewriting the entire thing. The process isn't much different from how the manga was originally written; Toriyama had ideas, some of which made it into the final product, and some of which were scrapped by his Editor. Except in this case, Toriyama was the Editor, and a very hands-on and controlling one to the point of making it his own story.<br><br>Honestly, I think that's the reason BoG turned out better than RoF. When Toriyama is given too much free-reign things get a little sketchy, but working with an editor, or in the case of Battle of Gods, retooling a story to better fit his image, he shines best.<br><br>And I think that's the most important thing to take away here. Fans are way too concerned with projecting their made-up idea of what's canon or not, and not focusing on the actual storytelling here. Super is adapting the movies into arcs and has the potential to flesh things out and tell the stories better than they were told in the movies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  ignorant is a bliss <br>I see that is your motto because it's obvious</br></br>  <br>Burden of proof is on you, fuck off if you can't show a canon source of base Vegetto outmatching Buuhan.</br>  <br> I have no arguments left <br><br><br> you can't show a canon source of base Vegetto outmatching Buuhan <br>Ok, I cant, that still doesnt mean Vegetto needed to go super saiyan to beat Buuhan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you really not understand that the Super manga is not the source? <br>The source for both is actually the Toriyama outline though, not the anime or manga. The Super manga has a completely different script from the anime in spite of showing similar events at times due to that. <br><br>Yes, the outline was primarily made for the anime, but it's not the final product itself either.</br></br></br></br>  Super Saiyan multiplicator is BS  <br> Toriyama is not credited as the writer for bog anywhere, though. <br>He isn''t credited for the script itself, he's credited for the story (and I don't meant the "original creator/story" stuff) though, due basically changing the original story completely with his input.</br></br>  <br>Creditted in interview or talk show so it's not recorded in anywhere let alone official sources. What the fuck is that.</br>  <br> Vegitto power level <br><br>Vegito is canonically the strongest character at the end of DBZ. And he stayed at Super Saiyan 1 in both the manga and anime.<br><br>Vegito has never fought at full power or took a fight seriously because he was beyond overpowered. Potara are God items used by the Supreme Kai. Vegito is a permanent fusion created by a God item. There are no drawbacks besides the original beings lost. <br><br>If the only thing that can kill a god is another god, then Vegito is your man. He probably doesn't even need Super Saiyan God, he is already at God level in his base form. It'd be interesting to see how Vegito scales up with Dragon Ball Super villains.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still defending anime continuity as canon <br><br><br> english <br>Proper noun.<br><br> run-on <br>Come now.<br><br> official <br>Officially non-canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The script is made for the anime definitely. From there, the guy either saw the episodes and adapted them or had the same materials and shortened it to fit a more concise format. Considering that the tractor part was fairly similar, I'd day the former is more likely.</br>  <br> I have no arguments left, so I'll get autistic about your english <br><br>And if you're going to do that at least know english.<br><br> Officially non-canon. <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that current Supes can still lobotomize Vegetto SSJG2.  <br>You cannot even prove he can kill buu let alone knowing his power level is just assumption because buu still has ultra regeneration power</br>  <br>He is credited as the original manga creator like in the all filler movies</br>  <br> You cannot even prove he can kill buu <br>Yeah, Vegetto definitely was losing that battle.<br><br><br>That makes no sense tho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was Super Saiyan 2. He had lightning.</br>  So where the flying fuck is episode 4??  <br>Can we not?</br>  <br>He punching him so he is not regenerating. That is idiot.</br>  <br>Nappa had lightning aura, does this make him SS2?</br>  <br>Obviously he has the original creator credit, but he also has a story credit separate from that.</br>  <br>He has not yet win. He is like fighting cell he thought cell already destroyed to pieces because the desparation and goku sacrifice yet he comeback much stronger than ever.</br>  <br>He means the lightining bolts.</br>  Are fusions a power multiplier, or a sum of powers?  <br>Yes, he simply never had any hair as proof of his state.<br> His eyebrows are painted on. </br></br>  Yeah, sure.  <br> He has not yet win. <br>Yeah, and if you read the manga you would know why.<br><br>Are you sure you like dragon ball, I thought it were the haters the ones who had no reading comprehension.<br><br><br>Metamor dance is a sum and more.<br>Potara is stated to be exponential increase.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With SSGSS Goku &amp; Vegeta fusing? I say that even SSGSS Golden Cell would be beat.</br>  <br> The script is made for the anime definitely.  <br>Toriyama isn't writing the script for Super. He's writing a story outline that then gets turned into a script by various writers (heck, each episode had a different writer so far) for the anime and adapted by the manga artist for the manga.<br><br>Even when they were showing similar events, you can see that the actual words and such are different.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither could defeat Beerus, the movie said so directly.<br><br>Catgod is stronger than SSJ3 Vegito.  That means Super Saiyan God is so much stronger than Super Saiyan 4 it's hilarious. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you idiot? Db evolution is not anywhere stated ad official SEQUEL.</br>  Is there anything that can come close to even hurting Whis?  <br>femWhis</br>  So, Super retcons the epilogue and GT?  <br>The fuck are you smoking bringing engrish website. That shit in story mean he is credited as original manga story not anything else.<br>..</br></br>  <br> Db evolution is not anywhere stated ad official SEQUEL. <br>Are you an idiot? I never stated it was a sequel.<br>It's an official product of the franchise.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant in their universe.</br>  <br>Girl Whis.</br>  <br><br>The common cold, because no being is immune to diseases</br></br>  <br>Vegitto is in fact is weak. Only fanwanker theory said otherwise.</br>  <br>Golden SSGSS Cell, who trained for  1 month </br>  <br>If it's more potent than Goku's heart virus, then sure.</br>  <br><br>Pathetic. Buu only needs to train for 1 week to get even stronger</br></br>  <br>M-muh dick</br>  <br> says unsustained bullshit <br> what's actually stated is fanwank </br></br>  <br>Going by how physically weak DBZ characters are, I bet Whis would die if you dropped a blue whale on him.</br>  <br>Officially Vegito is, in base form, as strong as Super Saiyan 4 Goku if not stronger.<br><br> The anime comics for Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy states that Vegito is perhaps even stronger than a Super Saiyan 4 (Goku was the only Super Saiyan 4 at the time the anime comics was released). <br><br>I can find the scan if you want it. It shows him in base form.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> know english <br>I'm unfamiliar with this usage of the term as a common noun.<br><br> citation <br>Have you tried reading the source material?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you idiot? Only official sequel matter. All movies and sailor moon crystalare official but not sequel.</br>  <br>Bills can fly billions of times the speed of light without need if whis' staff, his mass at that point is infinite.</br>  <br>No one said anything about talk shows. I think you need to calm down and do some reading. Toriyama has had interviews in multiple official publications promoting the movie that tell the same story, and in the actual credits of the movie, he has three credits: Original Author, Story, and Character Designer. Original Author refers to his work on the original manga, and Story refers to his work on the movie. There is no "writer" credit for the movie:The original scriptwriter for the movie, Watanabe, is credited for the Scenario. Battle of Gods is as much a work of Toriyama as Revival of F and Super.</br>  <br>Squirrel Girl solos them both.</br>  <br><br>Clearly, as Goku showed us, all you need to defeat superbeings is to take them by surprise. So just hit Whis while he's in the bathroom too focused in shitting and he will feel the pain</br></br>  <br>a single energy disk from even the weakest characters that use ki</br>  <br>So you're full of shit, cool.<br><br><br> Only official sequel matter. <br>For canon discussion maybe, I was trying to explain what "official" means.<br><br> are official but not sequel <br>So I'm right then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> run-on <br>You run, but you can't hide. Vegeta is undefeated against Goku (that's canon fact).</br></br>  <br>That is mistranslation and non canon. Vegitto is new entity and not transformation. He is implying that two people can achieve stronger power than one. Like gogeta is stronger than ssj 4 but in reality it is not because goku cannot perform spirit bomb the only skill that win in db universe.</br>  <br>Wat?</br>  <br> Merging With Vegeta! <br> After Goku and Vegeta use a merging item to merge, they become Vegetto! They can furthermore become a Super Saiyan, making them Super Vegetto! After the two strongest people merge, they become the greatest master in the universe! Perhaps even stronger than Super Saiyan 4! <br><br>It's an official source, and one of the few that imply anything about comparisons between GT and Z.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you know all nips considered watanabe as the writer and o one else?</br>   tfw we will never see Vegito or any other Goku/Vegeta fusing again   <br>But it's not canon, so.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> dbz </br></br>  <br>If Super ends up as a long runner like Z, it'll eventually happen. The writers will run out of ideas and resort to it again.</br>  <br>That's the official site for BoGs. Also, the original creator credits is there in kanji. Story is a separate credit.<br><br>Well, now we cleared that up, right? It's always good to help people.</br></br></br>  <br> Universe 6 arc <br><br>Anything's possible nigga. Don't lose hope yet. If not we might at least see Gogeta maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>  non canon guide book <br>Bring your shitty merchandise fanfic doujin guide book to your own wet dream. That is non canon as fuck.</br></br>  real talk, is Vegetto as strong as the writer wants him to be?  <br> anything <br>Not Goku beating Vegeta in a canon fight.</br></br>  <br>It's canon to GT. GT doesn't have a single author, even the main writer changes midway through and then a cowriter leaves once the Baby Saga is done. So, anything official from Toei regarding GT is canon (regarding GT) since it's not tied to any single writer.</br>  <br>Yes. All fusion is. Gotenks became strong enough to be even with Super Buu when the two fusers were weaker than Android 18.</br>  <br>canon to gt? fuck cares? gt aint canon</br>  <br>People were talking about Vegeto vs SSJ4. Official source says that Base Vegeto might be stronger than SSJ4.</br>  screw canon talk, it's all about multiple timelines<br> I probably need to replace BoG and FnF with Super </br>  <br><br><br>"Canon" is meaningless. It's an official source. They're all alternate universes/timelines anyway.<br><br>In one timeline Goku dies from a heart virus and Future Trunks happens.<br><br>In one timeline Future Trunks stops the Androids but Cell ganks him.<br><br>In one timeline Beerus gets his pudding and GT happens.<br><br>In one timeline GT doesn't happen, most characters live peacefully into old age, and Buu makes a blue googirl waifu for himself.<br><br>All of these things happened. Not all to the manga's continuity, but to alternate timelines based on it.<br><br>Now let's all talk about Majin girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Toriyama knows how physics works </br>  <br><br>multiple timeline mind<br><br>female majins a cute</br></br></br></br>  Why no new episode? Is there some kind of a list of shows not airing this week?  <br>He did, but he forgot.</br>  <br>Movies are all different timelines and just retread main timeline stories.</br>  <br>Majin girls a best.</br>  Why does Beerus and Whis fly super fast instead of teleport like Goku or the Kais? Is it so they can build up tension by taking more than an instant to get somewhere?  <br>Not the other guy<br>  They're all alternate universes/timelines anyway. <br>alternate universe and timeline are two different things. Also, its never been stated if GT is part of one of the 12 universes.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish people would understand this. The whole "MUH CANON" shit grew tiresome ages ago, there is indeed a canon continuity but there are also many other continuities within the DB universe. <br><br>Majin Girls are the best, thank you based Xenoverse for finally letting me play as them. Will play as one when the DBO english thingy comes out too.</br></br></br>  <br>GT and games are not canon nor part of the mulitverse unless stated otherwise.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128 <br>  everything is canon because i'm a total idiot that don't know anything about logic <br>Go kill yourself, idiot.</br></br>  <br><br>Divergences in the timeline creates alternate universes, man.</br></br>  <br>probably Toriyama/Toei has some other idea of timelines and universes</br>  <br>That has never been stated.</br>  Everything is canon, the thing is to WHAT continuity they are canon. A fine example is Super, which is canonical with the Z anime but not with the manga.  <br>Function the same in laymen's terms. Will need to see what "Universe 6" is about when it happens.<br><br>In either case there were at least 4 different timelines in the manga, and most movies were stated to take place in parallel worlds according to official guidebooks.</br></br></br>  So we can all agree that Gohan is the biggest faggot ever now right?  <br>Your English is broken and terrible enough that I'm almost willing to believe that you're Japanese and know what "all nips consider", and that you aren't just a Mexican child talking completely out of your ass instead of just reading the credits of the movie.</br>  <br><br>Never been stated, but it is the most logical conclusion, as the timelines runs separately each other instead of pulling a chrono trigger and making any change to the past affect the future.</br></br>  <br>He was a faggot for 99% of the series. It's his natural role.</br>  <br>He's about to reach his final form and become the new Bulma and invent everything for the show.</br>  <br>Technically Super is a sequel to Dragon Ball Kai, specifically.<br><br>So you could think of it as:<br><br> DBZ -&gt; DBGT <br> DBKai -&gt; DBSuper <br> DB manga -&gt; DBOnline </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything is canon, the thing is to WHAT continuity they are canon. <br>That's not how it works.<br><br><br> Function the same in laymen's terms. <br>They are different conceptually.<br><br> Will need to see what "Universe 6" is about when it happens. <br>Exactly, till then, keep with what we've got.<br><br><br> In either case there were at least 4 different timelines in the manga <br>There were 3<br><br><br>Yeah, who likes staying in character?<br><br><br> but it is the most logical conclusion <br>Not really,no. Bills stated there were 12, if there were 2 more created by Bulma's time machine he would have been notified.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bills <br><br>Post discarded.</br></br></br>     <br>Of course because i have many source instead of you white pig kid that literally posting the source is in my ass.</br>  <br>4. 3 of them were shown, 1 was implied.<br><br> "Normal" Dragon Ball <br> Future Trunks <br> Future Cell (Trunks deactivated the Androids) <br> "Other" Dragon Ball where the Future Trunks of Future Cell's timeline went to </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They come in all flavors, too!</br>  <br> "Other" Dragon Ball where the Future Trunks of Future Cell's timeline went to <br>That Trunks didnt go anywhere, cell killed him.</br></br>  <br>He stopped the Androids. He'd been to the past once before. That's why Cell killed him.</br>  <br> He stopped the Androids. <br>By deactivating them, you said so.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Okay but<br><br>Majin girls<br><br>or<br><br>Saiyan girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which he got by going to the past. He couldn't beat them in the future, past used the remote control.<br><br>Which he learned about in the past.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Time travel works in strange ways, so maybe they always existed as separate universes. Otherwise, we would have to accept the idea of 2-4 more Whises and Beeruses existing in the alternate timelines</br></br>  <br>It's just a disguised Naruto thread</br>  <br>Android girls</br>  <br>IIRC he went to Gero's lab.<br><br><br> Time travel works in strange ways <br>Its pretty clear in DB tho. And oddly enough, one of the best time travel mechanics I've seen.<br><br> we would have to accept the idea of 2-4 more Whises and Beeruses existing in the alternate timelines <br>Yeah, such as there was a Goku and so on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Prettiest Android a best. </br>  <br>Tecnichally db online cannot be canon because shenlong can grant level up and can change you to super saiyan eventhough the user already stronger than dende.</br>  <br>There are multiple sets of Dragon Balls in DBO. Shenron was enhanced but also limited in the wishes he could grant. This is all in the backstory.</br>  <br> eventhough the user already stronger than dende. <br>the user IS alredy stronger than Dende<br><br>and that rule never made sense, Kami Sama and Dende cant revive people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean? You cannot alter anything let alone changing races of warrior bodies.</br>  Another DB thread turned into shit posting, sage.  <br> putting real world physics on Dragon Ball. </br>  <br><br>But anon, ALL DB threads are shitposting cancer. They can't turn, they already are</br></br>  <br>You may not have won any arguments today, but your dedication to shitposting in a language you can barely speak has won my heart. Thank you, anon-sama.</br>  <br>Would you a Kai?<br><br>COULD you a Kai?</br></br></br>  <br>God can revive people but no alter them. It's make sense if thinking dende is only the medium that can transmit shenlomg power together with the dragonballs. Themedium has limitation on altering something.</br>  <br>Never was this said. Please stop reading Kotaku. SSGSS has been overwhelmingly talked about and promoted as the strongest Super Saiyan form ever.</br>  <br>official source? the fuck are you on about?</br>  <br><br>Of course. Not even the kais can resist the dick</br></br>  <br>  bitter and deluded loser kid </br>  I figured Vegetto was SSJ2 in the series because he had lightning bolt aura, but I guess it wasn't the case and Toriyama just forgot.  <br>We had like one good db thread months ago with people who had reading comprehension skills, it was great.<br><br><br> God can revive people but no alter them. <br>so?<br><br> It's make sense if thinking dende is only the medium that can transmit shenlomg power together with the dragonballs. Themedium has limitation on altering something. <br>That makes no sense even after translating it to actual english. (inb4 noun)<br><br><br>Source:  read the thread </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  only thing that known that SSGSS is Super Saiyan witht the power of a Super Saiyan God<br>it could imply, that SSGSS is just an alternate way of utilising the power of SSG or it could also mean, that he is a Super Saiyan on top with his God Powers<br>there is no implication, that SSGSS is significantly stronger or weaker than red haire SSG.<br>my personal opinion is that SSGSS is just as strong as SSG (power increase through training excluded)</br></br></br>  <br>Not canon.<br><br><br>Nope.<br><br><br>Probably. I wonder if they'll be revealed as regenerators too.<br><br><br> muh goku <br>AT will never let him win against Vegetable. Search your feelings. You know it to be true.<br><br><br>Will Goku ever stop being such a shitty father, husband or friend?<br><br><br> Read the manga .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is not win is a fact to stop you making a wild wild guess that is only in your masturbated theories.</br>  <br>I always kind of wanted Vegito to stay because I wanted to see the hilarious wife-sharing antics Vegito would have to go through.<br><br>Some how though I feel like Chi-Chi would be pretty willing to move into Capsule Corp.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch gt to know that shenlong is also an independent godentity. It's magic i don't have to explain shit. That is the mechanic tho.</br>  <br><br> Bills </br></br>  <br>In gt he is winning against vegeta goku is the finisher the others only the audiences for goku.</br>  I wonder why Chi chi never made Goku gather the dragon balls and wish to be rich  <br> winning against Vegeta <br>Not in a fight. He even dreams of it, he best wake up and apologize lest he find himself eating dirt again.</br></br>  <br>In gt vegeta is only side character and not part of the journeys</br>  <br>...or, the lightning was just to show his power, as it had been used in the series before, including when Goku powered up against Cell. Most things aren't "Toriyama forgot"<br><br>Buuut all the promo calls ot the strongest form, the Super Start Guide Q&amp;A has it as the strongest form, and Extreme Butoden has it as the strongest form.</br></br></br>  Toriyama said that he doesn't like how old the characters looked in the end of Z.<br><br>Couldn't they just make them gather the balls and wish them to be younger or look younger for some reason. Problem solved.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure Toriyama is ready to say "Fuck that old ass ending. Let's do this instead". I actually hope so, too. Not only would it be good for the story, it would enrage the "muh inconsistencies" fags even more.</br>  <br>Vegeta does not have spirit bomb and instant fusion to escape from muh saiyan cannot breath in space.</br>  <br>You cannot do that because they're stronger than shenlong.</br>  <br><br>...<br><br>They could... use Super Dragon Balls...<br><br><br>IT WON'T HAPPEN FUCK!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't that you have to be weaker than Shenron for everything. Shenron Revived many people on Earth who were stronger than him. Killing people takes strength.</br>  Batman with preptime can beat Goku.  <br> Read the manga <br> when talking about GT <br>you're literally retarded<br><br><br> I have no arguments left <br><br><br>GT is not canon and that contradicts what was stated in the manga, which was kinda my point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But can he get his parents back?</br>  <br>That is only revival i have explained that before.you cannot alter body that is why krillin cannot change android 17 as full human because she is stronger. And only getting away removing their non body part like the time bomb.</br>  <br> cannot change android 17 as full human because she is stronger. <br>Didnt know 17 was a girl. You learn new things every day.</br></br>  <br>Gt is not contradicting anything, idiot.</br>  <br> manga <br>Shenlong cant do what Kami cant<br><br> GT <br>Shen Long is independent<br><br><br>Granted, the manga already contradicts itself on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  As if there was ever any doubt.  <br>Your posting seems you never watched gt let alone knowing the mechanic of db. Go watch gt and lurtk more before posting, newfag.</br>  <br> Buuut all the promo calls ot the strongest form, the Super Start Guide Q&amp;A has it as the strongest form, and Extreme Butoden has it as the strongest form. <br>And yet they seem to have made no progress in comparison to Beerus, who's still clearly much stronger than them, even though he ran out of power while fighting SSJG Goku. Yeah, Beerus was holding back to 70%, but that's really not such a huge difference. If SSJGSS were a big power up, they should have surpassed him already.</br></br>  <br>GT isn't canon so therefore it is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.<br><br> step into the grand tour GRAND TOUR GRAND TOUR </br></br></br>  <br>Explain why.<br><br><br>But we're discussing GT<br><br><br> And yet they seem to have made no progress in comparison to Beerus, who's still clearly much stronger than them <br>Yeah, they got stronger than before but not as much as Bills, what's the problem?<br><br> even though he ran out of power while fighting SSJG Goku <br>He didnt, he says so in BoG.<br><br>  Yeah, Beerus was holding back to 70%, but that's really not such a huge difference <br>30% is a big thing dude<br><br>  If SSJGSS were a big power up, they should have surpassed him already. <br>Not really, no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I haven't watched Dragon Ball Super yet.<br><br>What did Yamcha become ? Does Tienshinhan still train in order to beat Goku ? Does Launch still exist ?</br></br>  <br> What did Yamcha become ? <br>He barely appeared, so assume he's still a dandy.<br><br> Does Tienshinhan still train in order to beat Goku ? <br>He never said he stopped.<br><br> Does Launch still exist ? <br>Yes, she didnt appear tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the part where he draws kid Goku/ kid Gohan bathing naked or pissing.</br>  <br><br>just in numbers, if Goku wants to surpass Beerus 100%, he has at least to be 42.9% (100/70=1,428571428571429 )stronger than during BoG</br></br>  <br>Are you japanese ?</br>  <br>If he uses namekian the dragon balls.</br>  <br> 30% is a big thing dude <br><br>SSJ is meant to be a 50x multiplier though. Heck, even the smallest factor (based on Toriyama's comment about how it's generally drawn lesser than that) would be something like 15x. So, whatever power up SSJSS has in comparison to SSJG, it can't even be twice as strong.<br><br><br> What did Yamcha become ?  <br>Nothing? He retired and doesn't even go to face Freeza's grunts in Revival of Freeza while Roshi goes. Dragonball Super itself might change that though. <br><br> Does Tienshinhan still train in order to beat Goku ? <br>Since the Cell Saga, Tenshinhan just trains to see his own limits, not to match Goku, which he knew it was impossible even back then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally become 10 million stronger than before a twice is like a piss in the park.</br>  <br>  frieza </br>  <br> He retired and doesn't even go to face Freeza's grunts in Revival of Freeza while Roshi goes <br>I think that's complete bullshit. Even as early as Saiyan Saga, Yamcha had already surpassed Roshi by leaps and bounds. Remember, Roshi was less powerful than Krillin at the start of Z and by the time they all fought the Saibamen, Yamcha, who was weaker than Krillin at the start of Z, was able to give a Saibaman a good thrashing.</br></br>  <br>Even a marginal increase is an increase.<br>Maybe Beerus got stronger? <br>Also, Beerus didn't really get tired. He just used that as an excuse to spare Earth bevause he liked the food. I wouldn't be surprised if Toriyama said "fuck that whole 70% thing" one of these days.</br></br></br>  <br> Remember, Roshi was less powerful than Krillin at the start of Z <br>He wasn't in the max power form when that was taken though. He used a midway buffed form when facing Tenshinhan in the 22nd Budokai, and here he actually fights in the buff form all the time. Assuming that he went back to training at some point while Yamcha stopped, it's possible that he eventually surpassed Yamcha.</br></br>  <br>This is reason why power level is non canon as fuk. The logic and the math are not equal each other.</br>  <br>No, because beerus not training ( let follow db logic). Beerus only training the fastest period is once every 1500 years.</br>  Beerus only trained once in 1500 years and still strong as fuk but gohan not training for few months become the ultimate jober. Is gohan a failure?  <br>So strong that even in its ki transformation can be one shotted by small gun from literally a small grunt.</br>  <br>Power levels were intentionally bullshit. No one should rely on them.</br>  <br>What? I don't understand your post.</br>  Gold Frieza has a powerlevel of 100 quintillion according to toriyama.<br><br>Even assuming Goku had a base powerlevel of 150 million in the buu saga(not even remotely implied by anyone) and assuming the potara squared this number (there is literally nothing to confirm this and is contradicted by simple powerscaling) Vegito at SSJ3 would be only 9 quintillion in PL.</br></br>  <br>Have you watched dragonball? Frieza can overlap all of them because all dbz warrior is not training in 4 months period when frieza is trainning like hell.</br>  <br> according to toriyama <br> toriyama </br></br>   this thread has 400 posts   <br>That wasa joke by Freezers VA</br>  <br>it was his VA, not Toriyama, and it was a pun on Golden Freeza being a "nice guy", with "guy", read as "gai", is also the word for 10^20</br>  <br> even though he ran out of power while fighting SSJG Goku. <br>What? No he didn't. He wasn't even going all out. The whole "I got tired" thing was just him bullshitting so he wouldn't destroy the whole planet</br></br>  <br> Gold Frieza has a powerlevel of 100 quintillion according to toriyama. <br>First of all, that was from his VA Ryusei Nakao. Not Toriyama<br><br>Second of all, the 100 quintillion thing was him making a joke. He was asked<br> By the way, how high do you suppose Freeza’s battle power has gotten now? <br> He’s a nice guy, so maybe 100 quintillion? <br>This is a pun on Freeza being a “nice guy” (ナイスガイ; naisu gai) and his battle power being a “hundred quintillion” (垓; gai).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn "i'm PHYSICALLY tired" it was "I'm BORED tired"</br>  <br>It wasn't even that he was tired or bored. It was him just being a nice guy, also, not wanting to lose Earth's food</br>  <br><br>Dat QUALITY Bulma</br></br>  <br>He said he'd destroy it, but never stated WHEN.<br>After all, what's a few million years for a god such him?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It started as a joke by the VA but then toriyama confirmed it later.<br><br> “In other words, up until the events of this movie, he hasn’t made any serious effort in fighting (laughs)! Generally looking at what’s happening in the movie, I believe Krillin is displaying an equal, or perhaps more, fighting power than Kame Senin. By the way, in this movie, Golden Frieza’s power level is at one hundred quintillion (100’000’000’000’000’000’000). <br><br>vegetto niggers btfo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he is adding to the joke. Especially since that article was actually about Roshi's strength. Toriyama doesn't think in terms of powerlevels and if anything, he probably read that and thought "Oh that's funny, we should just keep saying that"</br>  <br><br>Well, wasn't it supposed to be a surprise that he was a lot stronger than Beerus? Not that it was implied he wasn't also uber strong, but him smacking down Beerus was kind of a "whoooaaa" moment, at least at the theatre I went to. (for dat big screen experience)</br></br>  <br>The canonically strongest Dragonball character is Whis, you moron. This has been confirmed by Akira Toriyama himself.<br><br> Whis is currently considered the most powerful character in Dragon Ball Z. His power exceeds that of the God of Destruction Beerus, who easily defeated Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Super Saiyan Gotenks, Ultimate Gohan, Mr. Buu, and a fully-powered Vegeta, as he manages to knock him unconscious with a simple chop to the neck. According to the series' original author Akira Toriyama, in terms of power, Goku as a Super Saiyan God would be a 6, Beerus would be a 10, and Whis would be a 15. </br></br></br>  <br>We've been too lax with keeping /v/ out. Their go to thread starter is DBZ because thats all they fucking watch for the most part.<br><br>I'm just surprised we haven't seen Cowboy Bebop and TTGL spammed to hell and back, though that might be because they aren't still getting shilled.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>THAT LOOKS LIKE SHIT<br><br>S<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Up until five months ago I rarely ever saw a single DBZ thread. The best way to out yourself as a /v/-tard is to talk about DBZ as if its still relevant. I understand discussing the new material, but endlessly retreading a series in which literally everyone knows everything about is something /a/nons don't do.</br>  <br>And he remains undefeated against Goku.<br><br><br>He's always fucking up with consistency, so don't you worry about that.<br><br><br> various <br>And yet Vegeta always beats Goku.<br><br><br> retarded <br>One would have to be to not start with a capital and finish with punctuation.<br><br><br>You what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Earth really has great food, huh? If he manages to find his way into the Toriko universe, Earth is fucked.</br></br>  <br>It's not so much "fucking up consitency", but more "that's old news. Retcon time."</br>  So, I just watched RoF. Based on how they fought against Freeza's grunts...<br><br>Gohan &gt; Tenshinhan &gt; Piccolo &gt; Kuririn &gt; Roshi<br><br>No, seriously, Tenshinhan seemed to be the only one aside from Gohan who didn't get pummeled by random grunts at any point of the battle. Even before facing the red demon guy some grunts had gotten hits on Piccolo.<br><br>Kuririn was almost defeated by them and had to be rescued by Gohan at one point, and Roshi was clearly the first one getting tired and beaten up by grunts, even if he managed to find ways to continue fighting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So much talk about Vegeto. Why havent we talked about SSJ3 post evil Dragon Ball Online edition Bardock? Dude beat fended of SSJ4 Gogeta twice, and the second time Gogeta had backup! All of this was in base form, too. When Supreme Kai of Time summons the Supreme Kais of OP Glory and punch his mask off, he goesz SSJ3 after realizing he was controlled. How bad is he going to wreck Mira's powered up state and possibly the Super cast?  dragon ball is entry level anime for casuals  <br>Elder Kai explicitly states that Potara fusions are stronger than the dance fusion. <br><br>Are you baiting? You're misspelling every other word and your grammar is strange.</br></br></br>  <br>Stronger because the time time limit is longer could be the case, 0,000000000000000000000000000009 point stronger also certainly stronger too. Silly boy.</br>  <br>This is why non canon material is idiotic and the one bringing it also stupid and annoying. Goku in base form in the GT anime itself said he already stronger than perfect boo and his attack will trample boo's level. vegitto base form mostly &lt; goku base form because vegitto fusion is dispelled by boo's ki making thing that boo's ki can overpower vegitto's ki.</br>  <br>What about Jaco?</br>  <br>If only citing by only canon material SSJ 4 and ssj 4 gogeta is the far strongest. If citing using fan wanker, doujinshi, merchandise, fanfic guidebook,or any other alien source SSJ 999999999999999999999999999999xxxxx<wbr>xxxxx is the strongest super saiyan.</wbr></br>  <br>Those seem like unreasonable assumptions, because I think a mangaka (especially Toriyama) would make a distinction between a more powerful fusion and a longer-lasting fusion.<br><br>It's unreasonable to assume the power increase would only be a tiny number, because then Toriyama wouldn't have Elder Kai bother stating it in the first place.<br><br>You're definitely stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're definnitely an idiot bringing imaginary number and begging people to actually guessing your masturbatory non canon number. You can go back crying to your db heroes and doujinshi if you reallly like using fan wanker number or masturbatory or wet dream numbers,</br>  <br> bringing imaginary number <br>I didn't bring up an imaginary number or non-canon sources you retard. Jesus Christ this thread is infested with you people.</br></br>  <br>  want people follow his imaginary assumption <br>  not imaginary number <br>Idiot. You can start by SPELL the NUMBER and bring CANON ONLY MATERIAL or that cite vegetto is more powerful than somebody. instead want people to enjoy your imaginary assumption and discussion and bring your fanfiction to annoy people. And use canon only, db heroes faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>  vegitto <br>  very- very strong <br>  the most achievement that he can take defeating boo even though he is in fact never defeat him and in fact in general never defeat anybody. <br>  goku's KID form in BASE FORM GT already stronger than pefect boo. <br><br>The equation does not match.<br>So what is your point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   (OP)<br>  pro  <br>fusion<br>  fan theory said he is stronger than boo <br>con<br>cannot use spirit bomb the most powerfull technique that is existed and works with ultra regenerative or evil spirit opponent<br><br> GT kid's goku in base form<br>con<br>  he is weakened by dragonball <br>  lower reach <br>Pro<br> eventhough he is 'weakened' he still stronger than boo so he is on par with vegitto's power in fan theory <br>  can use spirit bomb that make him more like able to defeat boo than vegitto <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128649902#p128699728">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anime Openings<br><br>Post them<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMo<wbr>VmSV4yA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tJr82_VZoQc<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mJv<wbr>L5HKMmz0</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Smr<wbr>oZqXImbo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Post better opening.<br><br>Protip:  Maybe you can </br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qaJ<wbr>w6lqGFew</wbr>  [ ]</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b5C<wbr>a_E_-IVE</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XBw<wbr>ZJ2kWS9Q</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>Top tier.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=akH<wbr>8OQY0OxI</wbr>  [ ]  Personal Top 5:<br> 1.

I'd seem she has a nice body but for me her age (Remember that this guys are all in their late 30s) combined with the baggy childish clothes just make her a turn off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My dick likes the slender types. I was just pointing out the criticism of "her trying to be Kawaii" is also a non-dick-related point. <br><br>Yozuru's assets never get shown because we never get enough screentime of her. The times we do get it, it's usually side shots of her crouching over to give us a good shot of her chest in relation to the suspenders.<br><br>Gaen is hit by the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A god.</br>  Why is this show so great? <br><br>Why the fuck did he rent a hotel room with that one girl, who is definitely not his wife, just because he stumbled into the hotel in the rain? Did they do lewd things?<br><br>Why does he not love his wife?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Since it was a shonen inspired by a hentai she made many years ago, she used a similar female MC design. She probably made Rin's design when her editor told her to create a rival, then regretted not using the design as the female lead character.<br><br>So she shifted Rin from a rival who would have a smaller role in the manga to a much bigger role. Especially when she realized that Rin got really popular and essentially kept the series from getting cancelled.<br><br>It explains why the anime skipped a lot of Ui scenes early on, because they wanted to run into Rin's introduction. It wouldn't shock me if they skip more Ui scenes just to go to the first big Rin nude scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah looking at the original series, it seems that Yumi Nakata basically remade the series in a more family friendly package. The main character is Ui, the guy's name is Hayato. They even have similar styling cues.<br><br>This is what the series would be like with no Rin, a bland hentai of Hayato and Ui just having sex the whole time. One volume is enough to tell the storyline.</br></br></br>  <br>They're like 14, I doubt 14 year olds rent love hotel rooms.</br>  <br>Ui, Hayato, Rin, are all first year high schoolers in Japan, they are 15-16 year olds when the manga starts. I think the school year is almost done in the new volume, if it hasn't already, so they are all closer to 16-17 in the newer volumes.</br>  <br>Do 15-17 year olds rent love hotel rooms? I'm not an expert on Japanese prostitute hotels, but I'm not sure teens use them.</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related<br>http://buyfag.moe</br>  <br> no stormtrooper nendo <br> no min factory military qt <br><br>Dang</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask /fit/.</br>  <br><br>use a straw</br></br>  <br>I think kegels help with that.<br> You're gonna post gifs, right? </br></br>  Is Sansei Muramasa Bunny Version releasing early enough in August? It seems that AmiAmi is not bothering to split her from my July order, which suits me fine either way, but I wanna know when I can expect a bill.  Holy shit Gainax, how could you end it like this? I never liked him, but this is too much.  I didn't watch this show, but I like depressing shit. Should I give it a shot?  <br><br>It's great.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Easily AOTS. Makes me sad it flopped. The first couple episodes can be a bit of a drag though. I remember episode 3 made me drop it for a few weeks.</br>  <br>Is this your first Gainax series? If you like pretentious directors and edgy plots, you have found your company.</br></blockquote>]
