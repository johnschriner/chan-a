This was one of the moments in the manga that literally made me break down with laughter for a good minute or so. <br><br>I was fine with it before, but honestly this is a gag manga and the jokes are what take priority, if you rush them then it simply is not the same.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I know he is a faggot but you are a fucking crossboarder and that is worst.<br><br> cucklord <br><br>Fuck off retard, go back to your cancer board  and stay there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gakuto is a real human bean  <br>I'm not the OP but cucklord?

Dafuq?  Senketsu subs when?  <br> Dafuq? <br> Not knowing what HS does </br></br>  my fucking sides  <br>Please don't do this</br>  <br>They rushed it, but everything is still exactly how it needs to be.<br>This show is a masterpiece of directing.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry I forgot</br></br>  <br><br>what?</br></br>  people still watch this shit?  <br>Nah, its just a meme</br>  WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE SUBS  <br><br>posted in this thread you bitch ass nigga</br></br>  <br>Bitch where?</br>  <br/>  <br>CR fucked up like always, just load different files from nyaa.</br>  What the fuck is a dirty rip? Is there no other option at this time?  <br><br>i didn't see anything different from the usual HS rips</br></br>  <br>Its infected with a virus</br>  <br>Fuck it then, I'm downloading. For Shimoneta, for instance, there were usually funi .ass and raws readily available within minutes.</br>  <br>why u lying nigga</br>  <br>Senketsu alredy released the .ass file for the raw, you dumbass</br>   mfw this pacing  <br><br>fucking JC Staff.</br></br>  <br>CR has nothing to do with this, they're not streaming it. Blame Funi, they're the ones who always fuck up.</br>  why does this adaption exist  <br>You mean you love every single sec of it, right anon?</br>  Why are you all complaining about the pacing? Why would a person in their right mind enjoy a slow paced anime?  <br>I have to agree, they are really fucking rushing this adaption.</br>  <br> Literally cramming as much story as they can into every second <br>FUCKING SLOW DOWN NIGGA</br></br>  <br>Because it doesnt always have to be blazing fast?</br>  <br> how can people like different things <br>ask the therapist who's seeing you for your autism</br></br>  How many chapters did they cram into this one episode?  <br>this time it was 8</br>  Why?<br><br>I don't want to wait for BD's</br></br>  <br>Why what? Thats the same as the manga, she never got her panties dropped.</br>  I don't blame the anime for rushing things. I think the manga pacing was too slow.  <br> i don't blame the anime for rushing things <br>So because the manga was too slow, you think it's okay for the anime to have a Red Bull tier pace? <br><br>I personally think the manga is paced just about perfect. I prefer it to be on the slow side anyways.</br></br></br></br>  Filthy secondary here.<br><br>I'm loving the anime so far, but I haven't picked up the manga yet. I wanted to go for the 3 EP rule and it passed.<br><br>So far I'm finding the pacing in the anime as fine. There's no information that I feel like I'm missing, but still I'm absolutely loving the gags.<br><br>Is the manga as slow paced as people say it is?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  what would be a good pace for you? 3 chapters per episode? <br>you know they have 12 episodes to work with and bunch of source material they can adapt</br>    <br>No, manga is fine.</br>  <br>Yes, you'll spend hours reading the manga just to catch up with the latest episode.</br>  <br>No. Autists are flipping out over this not being 1:1 with the manga. Even with this pace, the story is still as great as it is in the manga.</br>  <br>Anon they are literally rushing to get to the arc where the boys are released from Prison. That's about 8/9 Vols in 1 cour.</br>  <br>manga is not slow paced at all<br>it just covers everything in a detailed way</br></br>  Least they got the two scenes right, Pretty well done.<br><br>We're already at the hair scene already, This is going pretty fast maybe we'll get the Infirmary scene in two episodes.<br><br><br>I started the manga after the first episode because I loved it and it's worth it, Honestly with these shitty ass censors there you should really read the manga, The art style is fantastic as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The story makes sense, and is as great as you say, but there's more detail in the manga.<br><br>Don't worry about the people crying over the missing details.</br></br></br>  <br>manga is much better<br><br>it sets up the gags in a much better way, since we aren't rushing through it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because you read it at your own pace</br>   Everybody complaining about the pacing <br><br>They were only given 12 episodes to work with, and the closest event that could be considered a finale would be them going free after eightysomething chapters.<br><br>Would you rather have them end on a cliffhanger that may never get a second season?</br></br></br></br>  I haven't watched the anime yet, I find it dumb to watch with all the lightbeams, so I don't know if it's indeed rushed -strictly with chapter numbers adapted, it does seem so, but could be wrong- but the manga is definitely not slow  <br>I would rather they don't choose to adapt stuff they can't do justice to</br>  <br>It's not rushed. It has the perfect pacing.</br>  <br>well there's a difference between reading pace and story pace, and i'm talking about story pace.<br><br><br>then give it an anime only ending. i'd personally like to see original content instead of them butchering manga events</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems to be out at Funi. Although I wonder why HS still hasn't release this. I'm guessing Funi broke something again on their site so HS ripper failed to rip this.</br>  hello where are de subs :-DDD  Haven't read the manga, pacing seems fine. It keeps things moving and never gets boring.  <br>download the raw.<br>and load this http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>15690</wbr></br></br>  <br> but the manga is definitely not slow <br><br>The author goes into extreme detail and can do an entire volume for the events of 10-20 minutes. The story has only moved from april to the beginning of july in 4 years.</br></br></br>  <br>here i am, a despicable secondary who severely misunderstood op's file name ...</br>  <br>That fucking amazing soundtrack at the end.</br>  <br> Would you rather have them end on a cliffhanger that may never get a second season? <br><br>fuck yes</br></br></br>  Is homosex MISUNDERSTANDING temporary or will it last throughout later chapters?  <br>Temporary, They needed it to scare Shingo away.</br>  <br>There will be actual homosex later.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>that's only a problem if he doesn't fill every page of said volume with stuff and just stalls<br>indeed, the story moved two months in 4 years. and it didn't have a boring/pointless part in all of this</br></br>  Is it okay if with how good the manga art, the ecchi stuf, the bro/comradeship, the suspense and the absurdity parts are I consider the  humor  my least favorite reason for reading this?  <br>nothing wrong with that, the more detailed parts are later in this arc.</br>  <br><br>That's like how fast the manga went. Plus it's a comedy, speedy like Gag Manga Biyori.</br></br>  <br>The poop.mp3 joke worked better in the anime because it was instant.</br>  It really bothers me how they pronounce it prizoon (especially in the OP).  <br>More so in-universe fictional homosex fascination out of fanboyism and trying to impress a girl.</br>  You can only pick one, choose wisely.  <br>Iri. Not a pedo.</br>  <br>Iri.</br>  <br>Marry Miyu<br>Fuck Kuro<br>Adopt Ilya</br></br></br>  Always Miyu.  <br> choose wisely <br>Irisviel, not even a competition. Now between Irisviel and the maids, THAT would be a difficult decision.</br></br>    <br>Where is Bazett? Where is Taiga? Where is Leys and Seyla?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh hell, normalfags ARE fucking up Illya threads indeed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Christmascake fags please go and stay go.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> normalfags </br></br></br>  <br>Irisviel, but only if I can get Zero Irisviel. Otherwise, I choose  none. </br>  <br><br><br>Shit taste hivemind.</br></br></br>   this thread <br>No wonder nobody complains about the horribly drawn loli swimsuit figures, people just do not care.<br>Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br><br><br> everyone that doesnt like lolis are normalfags <br>Okay, multiple special snowflake-san</br></br></br></br>  So is Miyu a cuck now? I'm not memeing, it's just that she seems perfectly content with letting Illya make out with Kuro all the time while just watching.  <br>No contest.</br>  For those poor souls who still hasn't seen the episode.  <br>Do you even know why they're kissing?</br>  <br><br> implying special snowflake <br> implying shit taste <br>Why not go back to your shitty /vg/ generals instead of shitposting?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't mind Loli really, I appreciate most body types, but Iri is somehow more appealing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Marry Iri<br>Adopt Miyu<br>Fuck Illya<br>Kill Kuro</br></br></br></br>   loli anime <br> /a/ is picking the old hag <br><br>LRD is right you know.</br></br></br>  <br> everyone who disagrees with me belongs to /vg/ <br>Go on anon, its actually fun to see you reply.</br></br>  <br>Of Prisma Iri and maids? Leysritt. Sella has too much of a temper and Iri is Iri.</br>  Kuro is by far the sexiest. It's not even close. She's like 4 tiers above everyone else.  <br>Or the OVA.</br>  <br>I just wanted a decent shot of the girls where they look like they actually have a body, not just blobs.</br>  <br>Now we have the complete collection:<br> http://web.archive.org/web/2015061<wbr>2190032/http://a.pomf.se/xqvrst.web<wbr>m - 2wei (Kuro x Miyu)</wbr></wbr> <br> http://webm.host/e7421/vid.webm - 2wei OVA (Kuro x Illya - Bonus Miyu) <br> http://webm.host/edd11/vid.webm - 2wei Herz (Kuro x Illya) </br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya wins with her childish innocence, sweet white/pink softness/silkyness and absolute girlyness.</br>  <br> 3 normalfags is suddenly /a/ <br>Fuck off, LRD. You're probably samefagging.</br></br>  <br>Emiya-chan.</br>  <br>Now we wait for this one.</br>  Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate and marry Kuro</br></br></br>  <br>Two of those anons just mentioned Iri. She's a married woman, not cake. As for the maids, are they even over 25 in this universe?</br>  <br>I can't be responsible for this much shit taste, but I can at least understand who are the people who go apeshit by my legit complaint about fucked up fanservice.</br>  <br>Oldhags are oldhags, so you can fuck off.<br>And how is Iri no cake?</br></br>  <br>But 3rei isn't getting an anime though</br>  Fuck me, if I knew just picking Iri would have caused this much butthurt I would have said nothing at all.<br><br>Let me say it again, I DON'T MIND LOLI. If you want me to pick between those 4 though, Iri is my go to.</br></br>  <br>I'll take a raincheck for Angelica instead. She's delicious homunculus tier.<br><br>And we all know homunculi are the purest.</br></br></br>  <br>She is already married.<br>Not that I expect newfags to know what a cake is.</br></br>  <br>Just because it's an older woman, doesn't mean they're a cake.</br>  <br>That's what they want you to think.</br>  Chloe is the best Illya.  iri  <br/>  Illya = Miyu &gt; Kuro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iri<br><br>Anyone who disagress has shit taste and should be castrated.</br></br>  <br> And how is Iri no cake? <br><br>because she's married.</br></br></br>  <br>You can stop now.</br>  <br/>  <br>I marry Illya and adopt Miyu, but since Kuro needs mana she can come as well.</br>  <br>None of them.</br>  <br><br/></br>  So this show is basically pedobait, which is cool because it's allowed me to unfriend some folks on facebook who were defending this shit.  <br>I"d fuck any of them untill my dick was raw. Except for Iri, not even because she's too old but just because she's too motherly</br>  <br><br>No you are probably just a kid, lolis are like red wine and caviar, your taste will become refined with age.</br></br>   LRD is samefagging as a normalfag <br>So nothing new.</br>  <br>If you are really serious about your "taste", then you should get the fuck out of Illya threads because you clearly don't belong and have missed the door.</br>  <br>Your kind should be prisoned. You are a menace to society.<br> also banned the fuck from /a/ </br></br>  <br/>  <br>Facebook itself is cancer, but discussing anime on Facebook? Fucking christ.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Stitches from the last thread.

I just said she's cute.</br>  I know rachnee is my waifu and the best girl because when I think of the others monsters girls, I mostly think about fucking them, but when I think of Rachnee, I think about fucking her, then cuddling with her, then go on a date with her and chill with her in an hammock all year round.  <br> kidnapped by "O" <br><br>So there's a D and now and now an O?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a filthy fish top pleb, ignore him and bask in glorious human top goodness</br>  Should I keep posting ch35?

Furry pls go.</br>  <br>I'd like to say it could work as an OVA, but then you'd risk driving away the secondaries expecting to see the later girls of the harem.<br><br>It could even open with that MON swimsuit omake.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought she appealed more to /fit/ than /fur/</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128534735 <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>Its okay.<br>She a shit.</br></br>  bird  Head waifu &gt; mlp waifu  Why can't monstergirls be real?  <br>But they are.<br><br>They're called SJWs</br></br></br>  Reminder: There isn't a better girl than Suu  <br>stop trying to force this into unrelated discussions.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128534735 <br><br><br>GET THE FUCK OUT CROSSBOARDERS</br></br></br>  Do you think this world has some sort of slime society or are slimes basically "wild" monster girls? I mean Suu came out of nowhere and they still have no clue where from.    Remember when people didnt actively hate any girls (hello polt) except maybe draco? I miss those times. <br><br>Post more best girl.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll mix the order of some episodes. Maybe Lala will show up before Polt</br>  <br>they could live in an underground aquifer system like undines spring.</br>  <br><br> OCT <br><br> 8 <br><br> 8th potential harem member <br>its like Pottery</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to cuddle with Cerea's ass.  <br>I like draco</br>  <br>Who hates draco?<br>She just wants dick.</br></br>  <br>Hey man I dont judge, but considering, she was amongst the most disliked, along with Doppel.</br>  <br>Mero has always been mostly hated.</br>  <br>Best.</br>  Reminder that all girls are cute and patoote  <br>Best girl?<br><br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br> Remember when people didnt actively hate any girls <br>Me neither.</br></br>  <br>I thought mero was the most disliked</br>  <br>I'd hope they had a family or something similar.<br><br>I don't want to see a sad Suu anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Desliked as in rankings? So far i didn't see any reason to hate on any of then.</br>  <br>This panel makes me realize how little we've seen of Lala's body compared to the other characters. She's got a great figure but I guess its too humanoid for crabman to care much about showing it off.</br>  <br>isn't suu just a gestalt conciousness?</br>  <br>So before Mero?</br>  <br>I wonder if all cyclops are self concious and anxious like her.</br>  Torikissa on the Monster Musume thread!  <br>I always remember there being a few people that liked Mero despite the tragedy fetish.  Myself included.  </br>  <br>irc cyclopes are suppose to be huge, so I'm guessing the rest of her kind have Tio type bodies perhaps.</br>  <br>She's basically past that, she dosn't want tragic love if it's with "darling".</br>  <br>Mero was originally only hated by Miiafags who felt offended by the NTR thing. Then Murderfish happened and hating her became a meme.<br><br>Great character though, I'm glad we're finally having an arc for her.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean "Dear sir" Right?<br><br> What is this fucking german car captcha bullshit motherfuck.  </br></br></br>  <br><br>They're also frequently bullied for being mono-eyes, even in the original mythology. I wouldn't be surprised if anxiety was more common around that particular species.</br></br>  <br>Wait where did you read this?

Did I miss something?</br></br>  <br>what do you mean?</br>  <br>Nothing other than the usual furry accusations.<br><br>Which is funny.

Mia needs meat, and that gets expensive. While Cerea eats veggies only, but she needs a lot of it. Not to mention.l their size, ramps for Cerea and NO automatic doors. Her ass is to fine and phat to need them. Mia can get ramps or stairs. Bath would be the same, Mia is ok with normal bed. I think Cerea would need a special kind of bed, since she has to sleep weird.</br>  <br>Cerea would be the most expensive to accomodate her massive horse but IMO.<br><br> I'd pay whatever it takes to make her comfortable though. </br></br></br>  <br>Good. Then she is the best girl for me.</br>  <br>Holo's only a wolf-girl. A far degree from being covered in fur. Give polt a normal nose and cut the fur down by 80% and she'd be OK.</br>  <br> While Cerea eats veggies only, but she needs a lot of it. <br>Greens can be very expensive in jap-land.</br></br>  <br>Spider pussy!</br>  <br>She has those pedipalps for a reason, Anon.</br>  <br>Arachne would probably be the cheapest since her web sells for a pretty penny and she's very self sufficient.</br>  <br>Well one can renovate and grow your own, but yes, it could get expensive. But nothing would be too expensive for me to buy her. Only the best for my love.</br>  <br>Dude she can make clothes on the fly, she could open up her own clothes store.</br>  <br>Did we even see Lala this chapter?</br>  <br>Nope. Which means she'll probably show up to save darling from the O.</br>  <br>I think calling it hate is a little strong. People just dislike her for being a higher percentage of furry.</br>  <br>You know, that's a good question. And not even in the joke manner</br>  <br> Wolf ears have fur on them </br>  <br>Why would she? She hasn't saved him before.</br>  <br>Foodwise<br>Miia and Cerea<br><br>Housewise<br>Mero <br><br>Cheapest would be<br>- Suu (leftovers, no space needs)<br>- Zombina (does she need to eat? Can't remember)<br>- Manako (she's just a one-eyed person)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's turning into a joke by this point, hotsprings chapter also had someone going "i didn't even know you were here" when she showed up near the end.</br>  <br>Someone send this to crab</br>  <br>It's already a joke, but atleast she showed up. We didn't even see her this chapter  while we saw Okayado </br>  <br>Lala.<br><br>That was easy.</br></br></br>  <br>I have to imagine Miia would be pretty cheap food wise because she is cold blooded.</br>  <br>Miia mostly eats eggs though, are eggs expensive in Japan?</br>  <br>Heating bills would suck</br>  <br> Miia <br>Rats are pretty cheap and free if you leave the garbage unsecured.</br></br>  <br> I-I'm n-not a furry just because I like a character with wolf attributes </br>  <br>Hint: there are other ways of keeping warm.</br>  <br> Rachnee <br> Human pussy <br> Flexible <br> Can use web to achieve your wildest dreams <br> has limbs specifically meant for holding you during sex <br> Has good-sized tits <br> Cute human ears <br> Will be super chill and sexy, if a bit lazy. <br> Can eat like you always do. <br><br>Cerea<br> Over-sized disgusting horse pussy <br> Extremely rigid and awkward, horse limbs are shitty as fuck. <br> Will destroy your floors with horseshoes and immense weight (over 500kg I believe) <br> You can only have sex with her in one position, and the hole will be too big and make your penis seem small in comparison (and she will notice this) <br> Has disgusting cowtits <br> Ridiculous donkey ears <br> You will have to constantly hear her drone on about knight bullshit <br> You will have to give up meat <br><br>How is this even a question</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people still arguing over Polt <br><br>It's like I never left /tg/.</br></br>  Does Rachne need to eat live food? Does she spit her digestive juices into it, wait until everything liquefies, and then slurp it all down?  <br>She falls into the commonly accepted non-furry range, so it doesn't work in reverse. One has attributes that simply adds "accessories" to an otherwise normal human, while the other requires on to find animal attributes attractive because they make up the majority of her features.</br>  <br>And suddenly I want to give Rachnee a Slurpee...</br>  How does Smith-san even have a job still? Is there just no oversight on her department at all?  <br><br>It's just people reacting to "best butt" posts.

Or just stop trying so hard to fit in.</br>  <br><br><br>Not saying I dislike huge ones or specifically Cerea's, just asserting that theres definitely a difference between her and Rachnee.</br></br></br>  Anyone have the translated version of this? Someone asked in the last thread never saw a response.  <br>1. The centaur infographic states that the bigger and heavier the centaur body, the more milk is needed for a newborn calf, and so their breasts get bigger.<br>2. The heavyweight breed has smaller tits than Centorea, even accounting for her armor squeezing them down.<br>3. Even though she seems like a normal, jousting-capable fighting centaur, Centorea is more in line with that of a diary breed in terms of chest size.<br><br>What does this mean for her genetic line?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is neck and neck with Rach-nee in the darlingbowl.</br>  <br>What?<br>This isn't what happened IIRC.<br><br>Cerea's mom was being prepped by some bishie boy and when some stallion came to fuck her, the bishie fucked him up and then he married her.<br><br>I thought that's what had happened, it turns out that her mom is the slut fuckhole of some stallion?<br><br>That sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monster girl =/= dysfunctional tub shitter. You'd never get near a government exchange programme if you don't function properly within society norms</br>  <br>She did not fuck her "husband", she came to fuck her, but the dude knocked him out, and then they lied to him telling him he just passed out during the deed. She even says she never lost a fight against her husband.<br><br>She probably still has the guy as a lover, but she can't exactly marry him since her family probably forced the male centaur on her.<br><br>I still find the whole cuckholding needed for centaurs to mate to be really weird.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> liking girls more due to animal features  <br> not furshit </br></br>  <br>If I had to guess I would say the odds are Miia&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rachnee=Cerea&gt;everyone else, although part of me wants to think Smith should be second.</br>  <br>That is, what happened.</br>  <br>The bishie boy was just a teaser so that the female is ready to mate, much like horse breeding works, as Cerea's mom told. At the last second she knocked the male centaur and tricked him into believing that he mated with her, when in truth she had sex with the humad and IS in fact Cerea's dad as told by her mom.</br>  <br>Harpies a best</br>  <br>It was the guy who knocked the male centaur out actually.</br>  <br><br> a girl's butt is an animal feature <br><br>Kindly kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>sorry anon. Okaydo's words are law!</br></br></br>  <br>Are you basing those odds on the first girl rule?</br>  <br>Papimom a best</br>  <br>No no no, the human hits the male Centaur on the head and he passes out, but Cerea's mom is still married to the male Centaur. So everytime it's time to mate the male Centaur is knocked out and human sexes female Centaur. I don't like the way crabman did this. But he is the boss. So I have to deal with it as a Cereafag</br>  <br>He's never been inside her so fuckhole seems wrong.</br>  <br>Ah. I see, my bad, thank you for the correction anon.</br>  <br>Read as: Fucked<br>Harem end is best hope, the Law of First Girl is nigh-unbeatable and unless Crabman does it by poll we are most likely getting an Open, a Harem or a Miia end<br> Until Darling dies and best girl achieves eternal victory </br></br></br>  <br>Monster Musume is good and all, but I hope it's popularity leads to people making anime/manga with one monster girl love interest instead of this harem shit.<br><br>Maybe a Holstarus. I just want Monster girl love stories.</br></br></br>  <br>It's weird that centaurs didn't just selectively breed out the old Greek image of strength over the centuries. Instead the women just put up with either getting plowed by shit viking-fist or cheating. Makes you wonder how many pure blooded centaurs are even around.</br>  <br>I guess partially but its mostly just the amount of development with Darling.</br>  A-1 [spoilerKae[/spoiler]delivers<br>TakeP smile status: PROTECTED</br>  So much Kaede today.

I'm in the later.<br><br>If they ended it on episode 12 things would've been dandy, but they did everything they could to ruin it after that point.</br></br></br>  <br> blood c <br>I salute your sacrifice. How did it end?</br></br>  <br>I liked the Crow and the Junk grandpa filler. But honestly most of the episodes before CLEAR MINDO and the final duels were hard to deal with.<br><br>Jack vs Yusei finale is probably one of my favorite duels of all time though.<br><br> Synchros &gt; All </br></br></br></br></br>   seems like you lost your memories kid <br> y-yeah that really sucks <br> better take you back to your parent, aright? <br> N-NO! I just remembered that my parents suck dick <br>Is Oda testing me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying I'm not talking to you</br>  <br>how do you guys even know who anyone but jean bart and bepo are in laws crew. like the other guys are generic faceless people how are they interesting at all? and why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art?</br>  <br>It's turning other people into her.</br>  <br>Blue haired Penguin reminds me of a movie I watched when I was little called Scamper the Penguin <br><br><br>That's why I ask people to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just tumblr/deviantartfags having fun</br>  I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.  <br> Is it really popular or is just one anon beyond autistic and just keeps posting that picture over and over again? <br><br><br>What the fuck do you think</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can just check knowyourmeme.com and find out for yourself.<br>After all, SakuraFish is a popular meme among normies and newsies.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad memes can bring us all together</br>  <br> Sorry, but there were no results for 'Anonymous of Gensokyo'. </br>  <br>No one cares about Daog</br>  Kaarage arc -  Commence   <br>Thank you, based anon. Will you translate all the three novels?</br>  <br><br> The two scrubs from the dorm or glasses dude. <br> Chinese girl houjou, unlikely since she was a great help. <br>   Aldini brothers  would be interesting since they have been reduced to jobber tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I plan on doing so</br>  <br>Takumi won't go he has too much fan backing, maybe his brother.</br>  <br>you can think of it that way for now. After all Alice, despite all her big talk to Erina about how Erina's in high school but she's never even had a crush, actually doesn't really know anything about love herself either. It's just bravado to try to show up Erina.<br><br>We'll see what happens when Alice starts to awaken as a woman.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
