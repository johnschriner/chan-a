[ Next episode airing in nipland reasonably soon. What do yall expect from the next episode?  More boring melodrama  Absolutely nothing and I'll still be let down    I bet you guys are great at parties     I'm probably gonna kill myself because of the ending. Until subs come out, I'll be avoiding /a/ like the plague.    no one gets together  my dad works at nintendo     Yui winning 8bowl   mfw when i'm not joking     A cancellation.  Holy fuck this series went down the shitter    Haruno fighting the good fight and keeping this shit from going full generic harem     crushing disappointment      Is it the final episode?     Yes.    1/6   2/6    3/6    4/6    How long did it take you to understand the amount of japanese required to read the LN. Lately I have been trying to learn.    5/6     Hachiman will be getting hit by another car!   i can't read moon runes for shit    6/6 Can someone translate these? Its from the BDs Based on the chinks who posted these, 3,4 are from Yui's diary and 5,6 are Yukino's     I hope there's some Irohasu in it, that's the only reason why I even bother anymore.      man the Japanese don't get a lot of words to the page       the presence of kanji balances it out somewhat, since that's basically one whole word jammed into a single character.   I want to kill this fucking  ghost   So was Yukino liking Hayato confirmed?   Not yet but Yui likes Tobe.    suffering    Yui's mom   hair bun   dem gahamas   comfy as fuck   genuine smile   looks young enough to be Yui's sister   "Hikki-kun...right? Yui talks about you all the time~~"   Man I really hope that they won't cut her scene.            "Hikki-kun...right?   This sounds retarded        "Hikki-kun...right? Yui talks about you all the time~~"   Oh god, my heart can't take it.      Just got done watching episode one of this show since it's been plastered all over here the one time I come here for an anime recommendation.  Jesus fucking christ you pathetic neckbeard fucks, I mean even I'm watching that fucking retarded "Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon" shit, but this shit is so aimed at you weird little shits its pathetic how its so adored here. No fucking duh, I'm surprised this isn't /a/'s posterchild anime.  with love,   your all neckbeard faggots who never learned to stand up for themselves or look a person in the eyes.        Gamama confirmed for best girl?     on that note its time for episode two     IROHA AKBAAAAAR      You sure showed us, now go back to reddit nigger    here's your reply    With no survivors?    Ma nyigga.    Best Gahama    I don't have time to translate the whole thing right now, but here's the first page as a teaser.   What's spelt in a certain diary is...    There's something I want.   To me, it's probably something important. There are other things I hold dear, but lumped together you could call them necessities.    The thing I want has no shape, so I'm not sure if it's really alright.   I kind of have an idea of its shape, but I'm not that good at thinking, and I'm not diligent either, so I'm not confident that my idea is right.   If I was smarter or purer, maybe I could come up with an answer that would convince myself and those around me.   If only I could explain it properly. If only I could get so engrossed in it that nothing else mattered.   In the end, I'm not smart, and I don't play fair, so I only have one answer.   It's my only answer, but the genuine thing I'm thinking of somehow doesn't feel realistic.   So, regardless of whether or not I understand. Regardless of whether or not I'm dumb, or I'm unfair.   In other news, my copy of volume 11 should arrive tomorrow. This will be a good weekend.                  Komachi exam stuff glazed o  (Hopefully) Gahama-mama and Y+Y bonding  3p deito and the offing of gloves for the final battle for the 8bowl  Iroha getting a token scene early on to keep the Legion from foaming at the mouth.           she talks about 8man with her mom   That's cute as fuck.       if I was purer  Slut.     Best family    same. I wont bother to read moon anymore unless it's something Iroha related. Missed those days when I went over the all trouble to use the OCR software to convert scans to text, then write a small ruby script to merge the lines and clean up the furigana, then add some html markup to open it in firefox and read it with the assistant of Rikai-chan.  Now I'm just sitting here waiting for some kind anon to translate them all.      Yui talks about 8man with her mom.  Then I guess Yukino masturbates with her panda screaming 8man's name.       Then I guess Yukino masturbates with her panda screaming 8man's name.  I can see Yukino feeling very disgusted with herself afterwards then going to sleep.     Then she does it again in the morning.   Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”    These were flirtings.                        These were one-side flirtings.   F T F Y      This wasn't     Expected answers from denialfaggots:  he didn't like it   he lied   he rejected her          he didn't fuck her     Let them come.     yet     Not being party pooper but i take that scene when 8man admit that what Iroha doing to him is too sweet for him but he didn't dislike it.  He thinks she still do trial and error before take off to hayama, so to boost her confidence he tell her what actually he feel about it.     8man fuck hayama infront of yumiko   Yumiko fuck yuis dog infront of Yukinos car     this gets me every time    Can you say that again in coherent english?     when 8man admit that what Iroha doing to him is too sweet for him but he didn't dislike it.  Exactly. I hope you realize the implications of this       No. 8man didn't admit. On the contrary, he lied. He says "I don't hate it" first, and "it's too sweet for me" later.       1- not true 2- not strictly true, since he wasn't being straightforward in his words 3- a valid interpretation, no matter how much it might trigger you.  Also worth noting that 8man early in this volume seems to be acting very Hayama-like in trying to "meet everyone's expectations"  It would go a long way to explaining why he tried to ask Yui out on their date and walk her home, for instance. If 8man really was acting genuine in episode 12, then that date request means every other girl can pack up and go home.          You could say 8man approve of her affection to him to boost her confidence when she does it with Hayama.    damn im on episode 5 now.  he's finally getting what he wants... and he doesn't even know it!      That's not really the correct translation though.  The debate is between "It's too sweet, but I don't dislike it" and "I don't dislike it but it's too sweet". But that's just english, in moon it leans more towards the former because of the lack of commas and the placement of the pause.       The "too sweet" he muttered at the end might still support the second though, as if his initial train of thought went "it's too sweet, but I don't dislike it" but he ended up settling on the later after another moment's consideration.    yeah it gets less edgy over the time   Preview?    in moon it leans more towards the former  No it doesn't. ・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど indicates that there is uncertainty. There's not a literal "but" here, but something that implies it. Then you have WORDSWORDSWORDS, 8man saying to himself he'll give Iroha the answer she wants ("the answer is the same"), then Iroha nods and goes away to Hayama. Then you have some more WORDS. Only then does 8man then say 甘すぎだな・・・・  There's no way you can connec these 2 sentences. He doesn't say "It's too sweet, but I don't dislike it" nor "I don't dislike it but it's too sweet". He says "I don't hate it" and then "it's too sweet for me", indicating in the middle that "I don't hate it" with regards to her way of acting is what Iroha wants to hear.         what volume should I read for the cut Saki parts   well he doesn't dislike it either way.  Not the chocolate, nor the sly/sweet acting, nor  Iroha's saliva .     Where else can I watch it? komica - gets me missing file apache error   yuckynodrama pls go    ・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど indicates that there is uncertainty.  You're wrong. The incertainty would be there if the ellipsis were at the end of the sentence, not at the beginning.   And now let's move on the most important thing right now: PREVIEW FUCKING WHEN?       retarded irohafag plz go and stay go  at least the ones picking apart 8man's dialog are interesting      Yukino doesn't like 8man that way.     The incertainty would be there if the ellipsis were at the end of the sentence, not at the beginning.   No, that's really not necessary at all. Unless you can provide a citation of course.     How do either of those lack a romantic connotation? It's quite common for some kind of flaw to be paired with "I don't dislike it" in a tsundere-style light confession. And 8man really is tsundere as fuck when it comes to Iroha.  It's not like putting "I don't dislike it" first somehow makes the "it's too sweet" somehow a negative thing.      You're pretty much going denial and stating that he's lying. It's pretty easy to guess that he knew she was talking about her flirting, otherwise there'd be no "words that she wanted to her". It's not that she wanted to hear a "yes, I love it" or anything of the sort, it's that she wanted to hear what he thought of what she had just done.  Besides, this ・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど is usually used when you don't want to admit enjoying something. The けど at the end of it can either have a "however" or "indeed" meaning.    Yeah, that's called discussion. Amazing what that one Iroha scene can bring of good to these threads. You know Watari's writing skills are decent when he's able to pull something like this.             Its Confirmed.....  Yukinon's Mother Forced Her to Married Hayato, Yui confess to 8man, but he rejected her, Finally Hachiman Being alone, time skipping, when Yukinon and Hayato Married, Hachiman comes, but for while, and he go outside and meet Miura, Miura looks so sad, and 8man sit beside her, and Miura asked 8man to drink Coffee....  Just that....From Vol 11       Let me guess, he then asked her if she liked Saize.    Not him, nor am I an expert on Japanese grammar but since this seems to be the point of contention in Japan too, I think it's close enough to be similar to how it would work in English.  Effectively, having the ellipsis in front would seem to indicate that there was a part of that thought left unspoken, and that the "I don't dislike it" modified that thought.   It's a matter of which is modifying the other. The former would mean he's not turned off by her advances, the later would mean that nice as they are, he's just not interested.        Can't believe I wasted three months with you guys.   ESLshit/10  Next time learn to start saving copypasta you like in a .txt file or something.       Yukinon's Mother Forced Her to Married Hayato   forced  She still loves Hayama even after all these years.       Saize   Also, preview when?      What's with this grammar?    Please don't be a ruse      けど here works like "though" and is used to reply Iroha's question. She literally asked him if he dislikes/hates the sweetness.  The ellipsis at the beginning of the sentence represents the pause before answering (8man tends to do that a lot if you pay closer attention to the LN). Otherwise, if they wanted to imply "I don't dislike it, but...", they would have put a comma and/or ellipsis at the end of the sentence, or even a hyphen to represent that he got interrupted or shut his mouth      I feel like you're really reaching with that.  You're taking two completely separated sentences only linked by implication, trying to create equivalence with a fundamentally different language, and then drawing definitive conclusions that are shaky even within the language you're trying to create equivalence with.      people are actually discussing the LN and breaking down the dialogue  Is this real life? Do I need to jump off my window to wake up? Why can't we have this kind of Irohafag and non-Irohafag all the time?     Frankly, it doesn't even really matter.  Iroha may be on the home stretch, but as far as this particular volume goes, pretty much nothing has been resolved.      Anime is ending LNfags are coming out of the cave.      mfw 8man tried to take Iroha to Saize on their date    If last week serves as an indication, we should be getting the previews in about an hour or so.   The most ridiculous part of this whole discussion is that Iroha never heard the "甘すぎだな" line anyway, so it bears pretty much no relevance to her reaction.  As far as Iroha knows 8man gave her a positive, if 8man-esque, response.       Both 8man and Yui loves eating at saize   Saize being their usual dating spot.      Because usually one or two retarded Irohafags start spamming IROHA OR DEATH and whatever their other epic meme du jour is ("he likes the taste of her saliva!" for instance), then other fags start shouting them down for shitting up the thread.  Meanwhile the sane ones, being sane, realize that posting will just draw the anti-irohafag fire their way and nope the fuck out.      He took her to a ramen shop  10.5     PREVIEWS WHEN   Oh boy. Where did you get this? It's not on the usual spot.     Yeah but before that he offered Saize because he thought girls only eat pasta or something.    It would make sense. Yui would respect 8man's frugality, and be more than happy just spending time with him.   PREVIEWS NOW?!       The fact that you try to place blame on only one party for shitposting really says enough about your opinion.    Retardation also happens on the other parts of the fanbase, anon. I'm not going to list what each part does to fuck up the threads because that'd take too long.      Dat unwavering determination     You should be thanking Irohafags. Their hostile takeover of the thread is the only reason we're not still being spammed with autistic infirmary edits and yui cuck.    Man, the drama always happens during the sunset or under shiny lights. If anyone ever confesses to 8man during sunset he's going to start crying in despair.      Hey, I'm definitely not trying to start a shitposting war     Fucking Konokon, put on your trip so we can filter you.    Here is your reply   Only just finished reading 10.5  How can anyone hate Iroha     I didn't understand why Iroha was so reclutant to eat pasta during the date. Am I missing something?     whine whine whine, notice how I said one or two. In no way did I implicate even the majority of Irohafags nor state that anyone else was blameless, but your camp just happens to be the one the noisiest handful of retards in these threads are a part of, as per the IROHA OR DEATH example.     Had she heard that, we've have a much better insight on what's going on. But Watari being Watari, says "Nope, buy the next LN faggot"     Well yeah, no one's disputing that. The claim (at least, mine) is that the 2 sentences are separate and cannot be linked as if the lines upon lines of text between them don't exist. 8man did flirt with Iroha there. That's a fact. He wasn't being genuine, that's also a fact. He didn't say anything like "it's too sweet but I don't hate it" to Iroha, just "I don't hate it" or a variation of it.     FEEL has a huge fetish for outdoor scenery and evening lighting. I wish they had more prominent shows.    She's a threat to their ships.     She just wished for 8man to call her by her name.    ;_;       Iroha or death, brothers.   Dumping a newly-typeset Yui fanart.  1/3    Did anyone check Watari's twitter yet?   There's nothing there but tweets about Irohashit and dear Komachi    I would say that Yukinoshitters are more vocal than Irohafags.    2/3     He wasn't being genuine, that's also a fact.  Elaborate, him flirting with her while being fake about it would be him doing what he hates the most. Like that time during the field trip when Yui confronted him after the confession.   No, take your falseflag and leave.   Yeah, nothing new.           Stop falseflagging faggot    Exactly. As someone neutral who is entertained only by seeing all this shit unfold, here's what I saw in this scene:  What's implyed here is that, be it "too sweet, but i like it" or "i like it, but it's too sweet" doesn't matter in Iroha's point of view. As far as she's concerned, 8man gave her a free ticket to 8inch. If 8man DOES know/noticed that, then the "too sweet" shouldn't matter, since he himself knew the implications.  The question is: Did 8man notice that and willingly said that even though is "too sweet" or he thought that she was still going after Hayama, so he said what he thought Hayama would say (the answer she wanted to hear)?  I mean, I'm thinking more about "the words she wanted to her" than the "it's too sweet" part.          Just because there is a gap between those two lines doesn't mean they were completely unassociated in his thought process. especially considering "it's too sweet" fits perfectly as the unspoken part of his answer to her question regardless of its positive or negative connotations for their relationship.   8man did flirt with Iroha there. That's a fact.  This is coming from a Yuifag who has poured over every sentence of every page of interaction she's had with 8man in the past 4 volumes or so: loosen the strap on your waifu goggles a little.       3/3  This was a huge bitch to typeset.        I'm certain they're made look shit because holy fuck my sides.  MOAR        It's true though.       it's too sweet  Why are people assuming this is bad? Remember 8man puts ridiculous amounts of sugar in his coffee     Damn son.    Yukinofags got shat on the most  Every fucking time someone praise her, other faggots yell shit taste/worst girl etc         MOAR  Translated Yahari fanart pastebin:  http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B       I feel like saying he wasn't being genuine is a pretty big stretch. The massive shitstorm that nearly tore the club apart was from the last time he was romantically non-genuine, and that was both to and for people he gave no fucks about.  There's really no way in hell he'd repeat that mistake, with Iroha of all people.  The most likely interpretation is that the "too sweet" was not of actual dramatic relevance. It was a sentimental expression rather than a rational one.   This is also reflected in the way he says it. You guys are acting like he says 甘すぎ or 甘すぎる, when in reality what he actually says (甘すぎだな) doesn't carry nearly as much of a negative implication, if any at all.          He flat out says that he said the words that Iroha wanted to hear. And later on comes the "it's too sweet" part, when Iroha can't hear it. He wasn't being 100% genuine.    Just because there is a gap between those two lines doesn't mean they were completely unassociated in his thought process.  The thought process was connected. The dialogue wasn't. Again, you can't connect 2 sentences separated by time to make them one single sentence.  loosen the strap on your waifu goggles a little.  What waifu goggles nigga? My personal opinion is that Iroha is toying with 8man. Flirting is not necessarily something serious. 8man is a teenager, he feels some kind of attraction to Iroha even if it's weak, him flirting with her is not abnormal nor significant.   Because the moon implies that the amount is excessive.               Every fucking time someone praise her, other faggots yell shit taste/worst girl etc   Normally they praise her AND at the same time attack Yui and Iroha     Given the change of topic as the last thread dies, I was going to muse about why nobody had done Yanagi Nagi vs Quad City DJs yet, but 5 seconds in google proved me wrong.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zsT<wbr>RHUiTQsY</wbr>  [ ]     This    Thanks nigga  Literally      You're joking right? When Yukino got her infirmary episode people willingly let Yukinofags have free reign for over a week, since she finally had a good moment after almost nonstop drama with her at the center.    too adverb 1. to a higher degree than is desirable, permissible, or possible; excessively.       he said the words that Iroha wanted to hear.  See    It's not that she wanted to hear a "yes, I love it" or anything of the sort, it's that she wanted to hear what he thought of what she had just done.     He wasn't being 100% genuine  He's not going to do it again after he broke down in the club room. He even called out Yui and Yukino not being genuine in the end of the volume.          Well OK, maybe "not genuine" is too strong. Because it's true that he doesn't not feel anything about her. But IMO that action isn't 100% honest.  Or, like a couple other anons suggested, "I don't hate it" are the words Iroha wanted to hear because she was doing a pre-emptive test for Hayama using 8man. In that case "it's too sweet" just reinforces this idea and it becomes an objective statement.      I know it's just fanart but holy shit if she gets animated and is half this cute, June 24 2015 will forever be known as the day an entire fandom collectively jumped ship for a background character.   mfw it's a glimpse into Yui's future mfw sadder than ever about no Yui gf         posts dictionary definition   english  Too bad the original text is in japanese     i miss old 8man   And when he saw Yui smile and saying that just like him. He cried because He realise that he doing Hayama all the time before this happen.     Yo, 'sup     With the club.      HOLY SHIT GAHAMAMA A QT  Gahamama &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yukimom        That was fast    BEST JAM    If only Feel had animated the entire thing, we'd know by their expressions. Watching his behavior while he was licking that remaining chocolate while saying 甘すぎだな would put a definite end to this debate.     Yeah, thanks m8 for added this.    Cut me some slack, I wasted two hours just to typeset this OOC shit.   new oc  use with responsibility     Shit &gt; Yukimom         mfw ara-ara      Gahamama met Hachimama when?    Oh I'll use that responsibly indeed    Best mom.    The problem is that nobody in the club appears to be acting in a genuine matter for most of what was covered in episode 12, and that's what Haruno called them out on. It's no stretch from there to conclude that 8man was doing the same with Iroha.   Nah, it probably wouldn't. They'd make him blush even thought the text of the novels indicate no such thing, and the initial shitstorm would still be raging instead of subsiding into actual discussion peppered only rarely by retarded-ass Irohafags spouting nonsense.       Gahamama and Yukimom was in a 3some relationship with 8daddy during highschool. Then he decided the 3some wasn't genuine and went after his kouhai, who turned into 8mom now.   History is repeating itself.     Everytime time I go into a Yahari thread its like a revolving door. I go in and as soon as I am in I'm out.    don't talk to my other guys  lel what     This thread has minimal shitposting so far and people are discussing the LN, so go and stay go.     "I don't hate it" are the words Iroha wanted to hear because she was doing a pre-emptive test for Hayama using 8man. In that case "it's too sweet" just reinforces this idea and it becomes an objective statement.  Now you've just completely butchered the continuity of the scene. -"I don't hate it" was before anything about the "words she was waiting for", so there's no real argument 8man wasn't giving her a straight answer -"words Iroha wanted to hear" was never the original meaning of the scene in question -since the "words she was waiting for" was not in regards to the chocolate, it also had nothing to do with Hayama.         Then he decided the 3some wasn't genuine and went after his kouhai,   Implying that kouhai wasn't Yukiaunt     ITT: https://d.maxfile.ro/xohtfwrbes.web<wbr>m</wbr>   COME ON AND SLAM    Fuck, I messed up. I'll upload a second version next thread I guess.     retarded-ass Irohafags  You can stop already with your damage control     Not really, if you look at how much they changed the Infirmary scene we can't really claim they'd be a good representation of the LN.  Speaking of which, I have to wonder if the scene really was cut because of big time LN spoilers. or if the FEEL director is just a massive Yukinofag.      What is that expression trying to convey?    except "the answer is the same" means that "I don't hate it" were the words she wanted to hear.    I don't think this is a correct interpretation anyway. But,  -"words Iroha wanted to hear" was never the original meaning of the scene in question  What was it then?  Also the words thing can have something to do with Hayama, if we think that she was practicing the entire act on 8man. It doesn't just refer to the chocolate or herself, it refers to her entire act in that scene.         They'd make him blush even thought the text of the novels indicate no such thing  So you're saying they would be staying true to the LN art, where it explicitly shows 8man blushing in that scene.      or if the FEEL director is just a massive Yukinofag.  I doubt it. Some have pointed out that they cut it to release with the BD, since 8man just teleports right next to Yukino after his choco blush      Hikki, we will be together, forever     Yukinofags got shat on the most  They deserve it for being cunts to other people. They are called YukinoSHITTERS for a reason.      actual discussion peppered   retarded-ass Irohafags spouting nonsense  You know you can't start talking about actual discussion, and then write an obviously provocative remark at the end of it.   Just because you're pretending to take the moral high ground, it doesn't change the fact that your post is a shitpost.         I bet you guys are great at parties  Yes, we aren't there.     Except for the fact that the art explicitly shows him blushing, along with her blushing and staring at him bashfully.     legit LN discussion going on   you post that  Nigger get the fuck outta here with that shitposting, and get the fuck off my ship in case you're a Yukinofag.      Which was after Hayama and the chocolate had been removed from relevancy in the conversation.   It specifically says that she was searching his eyes for an answer, immediately prior to 8man "giving her the words she was waiting for".  In context, the most likely interpretation is simply that he properly answered. It just put a lot more weight on the question, as it was indeed a very significant queston.  What I'm wondering is if the language is as sexually charged in Japanese as it does in english.          yucie is kill what now?   Who?    looking at tags for Yahari on medukami   "Egotistic Male Lead"  nani     Wat    touche, point to Iroha.    I'll never understand why people jump to defend their whole ship when someone tries to draw a distinct line between the good ones and the bad ones.  Irohafags have been the problem in these threads the last couple days, just like Yukinofags were the issue right after episode 11 and Yuifags shat up threads after Destiyland got animated.          But it's not fanart. It's from the animator's twitter I think.        makes generalized shitposts   complains about generalized defense   here's your reply      I expect it to further slip into harem territory.   Well,     HYPE!       Just going to start reading the book. Anything new concerning Yukino/Yui interludes anons?   Doesn't excuse the fact that you were trying to start shit. Obviously if you use the phrase "retarded Irohafags" then Irohafags in general are going to get defensive.  Is this your first time on the internet or something? Generalizations are kind of a thing here.   I think there was a tag on a site for "sexist male lead". I think you can guess where it was from.           Yes    DON'T FUCKING RUSE ME HOLY SHIT   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127154504  Here's your reply   Is there going to be a livestream? where can I watch it?    he said the words that Iroha wanted to hear.   you know, us Irohafags who knows few runes obviously know its not "wanted to hear" and more like "wanted to know about". But why seriously translated/corrected anything when it sure is fun seeing the denialfag/uneducated EOPs keep using that phrase to argue?  I bet the original translator of that scene using those words on purpose, too.        Internet   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127154504  Yeah, people should really be reporting you instead of feeding you replies.    well done would support this ending     SLAMFU   HOLY FUCK MY SIDES      Here   http://vocaroo.com/i/s14JEX6dkFWU      I get that but the internet's a big place. Specifically, what site could i go to, besides google, to check it out?       Yo, 'sup   ruined         Also worth noting that 8man early in this volume seems to be acting very Hayama-like in trying to "meet everyone's expectations"    Not only in this volume. He actually already act that way since volume 10 and 10,5 unconciously.  It was really showing at volume 10,5 chapter 3 when he try get his work done before deadline. I think that's why Yui encourage for him at that time really boosting him because she didn't place her expectation to him.         maybe if you were less of a NEET you'd actually get on the BALL and find the answer yourself.     Yeah, maybe if you were able to CONNECT with the CAST some more you would be able to find your own answers.    This is stupid. What is Spyro's interpretation of that scene?   Well the category of "egotistical male lead" isn't bizarre, but categorizing 8man as an egotistical person is.      I laughed.      Did Yui talk about Yukino with her mom too?    His interpretation is that Iroha symbolizes Mara and 8man's answer structure is representative of how all of us must vigilantly fight against Mara and might be drawn close to him from time to time.   Friendship end incoming     Actually it's from FEEL's official twitter account:  https://twitter.com/feel_feel/statu<wbr>s/614004128398770176</wbr>        Definitely, if anything it's the exact opposite with him caring too little about himself. But I suppose from a first impression that is the feel he gives off due to his loner monologues. Still silly though.   I also do birthday parties.        Thanks for spelling it out. I will reevaluate my life and try to genuinely understand Yahari's cast.     heeeeeeeeey that wasnt a live stream at all    Most probably, since Yukino is her best friend.    No it wasn't but isn't it pretty hilarious?  You just been trolled on da interwebz :^)      My guess is yes, though while I'm guessing, I think that scene may be the day 8man meets with the girls for the 3P date, so Gamama's introduction to Yukinon may have happened earlier and off-screen, so sadly we won't get to see her gush about both of Yui's favorite people.    Seriously anon? You clicked on that? Jesus    8man is tsundere. Against the world.  it's not like I'm doing these for your sake, you ungenuine people      Seriously, why do they always trying to remove Yui's Yuis?    To be fair, 聞いた does have a "to hear" TL to it. I don't see much of a problem with using that, but then again my moon is still nowhere near Spyro's level.     GAMAMA STATUS: HAPPENING    But they are not that close before    8man is Hinedere    If this and the spoiler were true. Doesn't that mean Yui is the one that understand 8man the most outside his family and sensei?    Iroha has no feelings for 8man, last episode just proved it. Nothing will come of the finale for the Irohafags.   Maybe you'll get a little scene in volume 12 if you're lucky :^)      Thanks 4chan, you're like that bully that secretly wants to help.      :^)  Here's your reply.       Honestly I never felt like that was in question. It always seemed like an intrinsic part of why she was so important to both 8man and Yukino coming out of their shells; she's always been the Monster of Understanding.   I'm glad you finally realized what good a little pain can do you.      Shitpost levels on this thread are minimal. I'm proud of you anons   We're just Hinedre.    What should I expect from this shitty anime that I dropped ?    but i was curious and you know what i couldnt even find  and yeah it was pretty funny      No, that is because she is just being herself, the nice girl    Does she have pink hair or black hair?    The problem is that the connotations in English are pretty severe. "What she wanted to hear" implies he is giving a fake response in order to please her, which gives a negative meaning to his later statement of "Too sweet".   However if it is translated as "What she wanted to know" then the scene has a much more positive meaning. And the "Too Sweet" could be considered one of 8man's wry remarks about her rather than a rejection.  Translating to English is difficult since the language has far too much room for fuck ups like this. And words can have a wide variety of meanings because we fucking love homonyms for some bloody reason.    Here's your reply.   Irohasu~    Fuck off kid, it's not like we're doing it for you or anything. I just happened to accidentally use caplocks that's all!                shitpostking.jpg    Discovering the truth about your real father.   Anyway, preview when?   Saize is the best dating spot.    Never, they just broke the record for being late with them.    But in the spoiler Yui said she is not nice girl.    She'd probably be brunette, though I wouldn't be surprised if nobody mentioned to Feel that Yui's hair is a dye job.    The meaning of highschool life and why you were a failed abortion.    and 8man believes that wanting to understand other people while not caring if you're understood yourself is selfish.     Implying they wouldn't get matching dye jobs.     It would be hilarious to see Yuimom has pink hair.      WELP.  More reason for me to rooting Yui ending.  Please don't dissappoint me, Watari.          That would be pretty fucking cute. Maybe Gamama has a couple greys to hide, after all.    Ah, you're right. Like I said, my moon is still far from something to be proud of, so I can't really give a proper input on the matter. I wonder how Spyro will translate it, because I'm sure his choice of words are going to cause a shitstorm regardless.     How to fuck up simple things : begginer's guide    She is always smooth things over then    Someone should just ask Watari to clarify on the meaning of the scene.    I am just going to sleep and wake up tomorrow afternoon to watch this shit.  Staying up all night on Commie's wild ride is too much for me.      Is the first chapter about misspelling a simple word like "beginner"?    But 8man pretty much said in monologue during first genuine speech that he wants relationship where both parties shoving his/her selfishness toward each other being.    Meanwhile Yukinomom ignores 8man existence    The meaning is that Iroha likes 8man and he doesn't know who the hell he likes. News at 11   Exactly, his entire monologue was contradictory horse shit. Because he's as bad with emotions as Yui is with hieroglyphs.       He'd never do that, he wants to leave everyone in the darkness so people buy the next volume to find out what happened.     The meaning is that Iroha likes 8man and he doesn't know who the hell he likes. News at 11   he doesn't know who the hell he likes   he doesn't know who the hell he likes  This.       tfw previews never ever    So that means We can't take his monologue at face value but we can see it true or not from his own action, right?    5 minutes more.    I guess        I wonder if we'll get vol 11.5 instead in November. Or, the Yukino and Yahari main arc ended in vol 12 but all the romance loose end will be resolved in 12.5      11.5  Please no     BACK YE DEMON! BY ALL MEANS, DON'T SAY THAT!   I also think we'll get a 11.5 instead, sadly       Gahama-mama 2adorable.   IROHA IS PERFECTION  Between the hags and lolis.  Are collage aged idols no good?    they're all good anon   just some are gooder than others, depending on who you ask and how way their particular shit tastes developed       Which one was Laika again?     college aged idols  They're called gravure, OP.     College aged girls are the best because I am in college and I like more mature girls anyway    enjoy your std infested sluts    I'm pretty sure real idols don't go to College.    More like AV. Even lolis do gravure.      Dont spoil my dreams.     Now I want a little kitten Anyan Look at her tiny little paws        collage    There is at least Horikoshi in Tokyo which is basically a place where idols can get a normal education.      Poor slut, always getting cockblocked by her sister.  How relevant is Rin? I'm considering picking this up just for her.   She's Scamco and Japan's favorite girl, although she doesn't really have as huge a presence in the anime as you'd think aside from the first few episodes That being said she's complete garbage and there are a  Miria d of better girls to watch the show for      aside from the first few episodes  How kind of them to put the girl I'm most interested in in the beginning episodes. I guess I'll add it to my backlog then, if only for the first few episodes.     she is the worst girl, don't bother    There must be a reason Japan likes them so much though.     Oh Generic straight dark haired beauty-sama please step on me  Rin a shit     Don't listen to  Rin is great.     While Uzuki is better.  Suffering soon.       Uzuki is a cutie. I hope she doesn't suffer too much in the second course.    Neither   Momoka is the light of my life   Eh, I found Uzuki kind of boring. I prefer Rin and Mio.    Most of the girls are, which doesn't say much about Uzuki but should speak volumes about Rin It's okay though, I'll help you find a better group of Cools to root for    Daily reminder that Anya is perfect.

He will protect her smile.    How could he protect someones smile when he couldn't even protect his own?   All the CG idols are no good.   Except Miku   Kanako the best.   For some reason, the nips like talking about Miku. It's cat posting central over there.    http://imgur.com/XHTAIsO Kanako is a yokozuna.     I beg to differ    Why is Producer-San the most moe character    Generic rapeface-san    I want to play with Kaede.    Drinking games?  (You'll probably lose, you know.)     These lips have sucked dick.   Hmph; I won't lose to a girl.   I never got into this whole iM@s-thing and the girls I've seen in these threads have been kind of bland. Recently I've been seeing a lot of this Kaede girl on the front page and she looks really cute and hot. Is she a new addition to the franchise or has she been around for a while? This is a first time in a while that I actually have committed a folder for a girl I know absolutely nothing about.    She's been around for a while.     You have a good taste muh niggah. Here's some choco.    You mean, woman.    Her actor/singer is Saori Hayami, a wonderful singer. Definitely do try "Koi Kaze" and "Yuki no Hana".   Why is this thread back in /a/, I thought you guys got booted to /vg/.   There is no Cinderella Girls thread in /vg/            I want to get rape by Kaede.    My bad bruh "real woman" she is.      Cheers, bruv.      Is she telling me to sit down?    How can a character I know absolutely nothing about be so infatuating. I have absolutely no interest in idolfaggotry stuff but I almost feel compelled to get into it just because of her.    She's guessing you can't stand up straight.    I hope you like bad punsters. (You do now.)      whens the new pv    Too bad bruh cuz the anime lacks cakes. But Rin is ok; I guess.    My brother.   The best images keep her heterochromia subtle.

Whiskey   from a mug   Oh shit nigga, what the fuck are you doing.      So it's safe in this thread to wish for more actual women instead of teen girls in the second cour?    not splashing your coffee with bourbon  Not an anarchist are you?      Wants actual women   Posts a bratty 17 year old.      sake with a splash of sake   Bullshit and broken anime and manga techniques.  I'll start.        Did you... want what's depicted in the second image?  Isn't what you ended up getting infinitely better?       Did someone call for Captain Broken?   Shirou's projections once you realize he downloads the experience of the people who've used the weapon.   You know, Prince of Tennis is the exact same deal.    Gilgamesh was the only hero he could defeat.  ...maybe True Assassin.      Remember how the dinosaurs went extinct because of tennis?    He takes on several servants throughout the story, and that's not too shabby considering he's a high school kid.   Can somebody tell me what the fuck Emperor Eye is supposed to be?  Is it this? It's this, isn't it?      He takes on several servants throughout the story  Name them.     Archer, Gilgamesh, Berserker (Heaven's Feel), Saber (Heaven's Feel).  They all come with asterisks when facing them, but that's still pretty good considering he's still basically a kid.      OK so you know how in a video game or a sport you can predict what the opponent will do in certain situations? It's like that but with greater accuracy.    When are we getting broken anime Rugby?     implying Japan knows what rugby is     No, that's Kise's Emperor Eye and Perfect Copy.  Yes, it's as retarded as it sounds.      Are you being serious?    No, I wanted the gay. I am Makotosexual.     O-Oh...    Small Head Powers.   Reverse steroids, maybe?      Why the fuck would anyone want shitty magic basketball instead of delicious gay?  Do you think everyone is a 15 year old straight boy?       S-Sorry. ;_;     Yes. Yes, but basketball.    I can't wait for the whole shit to go world level and Nippon got curbstomped by far more powerful super techniques from the world players   The real problem with Japan in sports manga is that they fucking suck at every sport except baseball.   Volleyball is gold though, no lasers or shit    I lost interest in it after the Japanese championship. Up to that point it at least had the appearance of following a coherent story. Afterwards it was basically just superpowers upon superpowers and inflationary powerlevels to an extent that was simply tiresome.     Federer curbstomps Japanese players with his Galaxy Shuriken and Russian Nest Doll Mech   Nadal on Clay allows him to become a Million Nadals      They can be pretty good at swimming, not so much at the moment     Comparing exaggerating a spike in volleyball to fucking intergalactic lazers     Yeah, volleyball got the short end of the superpower stick.    What they hell? I remember watching this show as kid where everything had normal proportion. This is so messed up that even Titans from SNK have more realistic proportions.    You can see the super-speed spike in international competitions.    Judging the concept of creation Hypothesizing the basic structure Duplicating the composition material Imitating the skill of its making  Sympathizing with the experience of its growth   Reproducing the accumulated years  Excelling every manufacturing process          They're great at ski jumping for some reason.     watching this show  Yeah, obviously. Of course an anime would fix the bad drawing skills of the mangaka. The manga was infamous for its weird proportions. Have you never even seen that group photo?        At least Karasuno fucking actively trains all the time and you can see them improving. Seiren just becomes "lol perfect team direct drive zone" because Akashi's bullshit was getting out of hand. On the other hand, you can see Karasuno developing into a goddamn team. It's like Diamond no Ace in that regard. You actually care about the growth of the team and characters.  When Sawamura got the yips, I teared up a little bit.       There are like 12 people who ski jump. It's not especially hard to get to the top of that. I've met a top 200 jumper because I've been in a place with snow.  Japan has really good fighting game players cause of arcades. A second volume of manga about one of the top players was announced today. He doesn't have any bs superpowers besides occasional mind-reading     Instant transmission.  Bullshit power that Goku never uses to great effect because it would be "cowardly" to teleport from behind your opponent and kill them that way.     And the one manga about ski jumping I liked got cancelled.  Thanks elevens.       Not really. Goku doesn't use it for battle because it wasn't super applicable against his opponents after he learned it.     As kids they have normal head proportions. The problem is that their bodies grew but their heads didn't.  Even up until marriage.       Not really. Goku doesn't use it for battle  Expect for Cell, amirite?   because it wasn't super applicable against his opponents after he learned it.   It's always super-applicable. Just go to any power level thread and you'd have some retard saying he uses it all the time in battle to defeat any number of overpowered opponents.         That what always bothers me about sport anime/manga. If that is the level of highschool player, pro level must be something surreal.     we already got Eyeshield   Is there any better sport manga than Real?    Expect for Cell, amirite?   He uses it once against Cell and then stops because he expended so much ki on his Kamehameha that he's exhausted. He proceeds to give up afterwards and volunteer Gohan to fight. Who else would he use it against? The Androids/Cyborgs? No Ki signature to lock on to. Buu? Irrelevant, he'd just reform fucking immediately. It's not a practical battle technique against the enemies he ended up fighting.      Slam Dunk    Have you met Ricardo Martinez?     I've met a top 200 jumper  That doesn't mean shit. Laws of probability dictate that so long as you're among people sooner or later something like that is bound to happen. In fact, the top 200 of ski jumping has just as many members as the top 200 of any other sport: 200.        But Ippo isn't in high school.     I don't really mind bullshit powers in sports. At best they can make things pretty interesting, at worst it's at least entertaining as hell.  Realistic sports is good too though. Best genre all around.       Teleportation to cover distance at the speed of thought   not useful   By that logic, any claim that Goku could teleport inside Toppa Tengen Gurren Lagann to destroy Simoun inside the cockpit is utter bullshit.       Not even remotely my point.    pro level must be something surreal   That's the point I'm making. That's what I'm replying to.        Ippo was in high school when Takamura met him and he destroyed a heavybag once.    What would Buu absorb if Goku teleported him to a distant galaxy with no life in it then teleported back?  Checkmate, autists.       Again, it was not useful as a BATTLE TECHNIQUE for Goku because the opponents he fought after he learned it either   A: Had no Ki signature   or  B: Had ridiculous amount of regenerative abilities.  So the notion he didn't use it because it was cowardly is just outright not true.   By that logic, any claim that Goku could teleport inside Toppa Tengen Gurren Lagann to destroy Simoun inside the cockpit is utter bullshit.   He couldn't. There is a limit. TTGL is a mass of energy that is light years tall. Goku couldn't even use Instant Transmission to go to New Namek because it was too far.                  He'd just teleport or fly back. He doesn't need to breath. Besides, the Dragonball universe has only 4 galaxies.     There's so many dumbfucks on this website that it's safe to assume that he is.    Well, there's tennis now as well even if it's only one.     teleported him to a distant galaxy with no life in it  That's not how instant transmission works.      Again, it was not useful as a BATTLE TECHNIQUE for Goku   Bullshit. He has used it numerous times as a battle technique and even Kid Buu used it too, like the Instant Transmission Kamehameha or Teleporting Vanishing Ball.      Instant Transmission allows Goku and anyone that is in physical contact with him to instantly travel great distances (from meters to light-years, between the living world and Other World, or even travel outside time itself) just by concentrating on a particular individual's ki signature, and transmitting or feeling that being's location.  Yes, that's how Instant Transmission works and he should've used it before Buu absorbs anything dangerous, like his own sons.       on a particular individual's ki signature  In a galaxy with no life inside there is no individual to lock onto. I'm not sure what you're smoking.       He has used it numerous times as a battle technique   Like that one time he used it against Cell and... never again. Every time Goku used Instant Transmission, it was for transportation purposes. Getting Dende, locating Fat Buu, trying to escape Kid Buu, coming back to Earth, searching for Vegeta after Super Buu, etc.   and even Kid Buu used it too, like the Instant Transmission Kamehameha or Teleporting Vanishing Ball.   Literally filler and video games. Ignoring Kid Buu was used the Supreme Kai's teleport because it's better in every aspect.           Yes, that's how Instant Transmission works and he should've used it before Buu absorbs anything dangerous, like his own sons.   You mean when he was dead and could not go to earth? I don't see how Instant Transmission would have helped Gohan being a fuck-up and getting absorbed.       In a galaxy with no life inside there is no individual to lock onto.  He doesn't need to lock into a signature, he needs the ki signature of the person he needs to transfer.      Gotenks gets absorbed because Gohan   Gohan gets absorbed because Gohan   somehow IM would have stopped that       But he does. Show me a canon example of him traveling around with no living target.     He doesn't need to lock into a signature   Yes he does. This is exactly why he couldn't find New Namek, why he couldn't find the Androids, and why the Supreme Kai had to bail him out of Kid Buu blowing up earth.       I remember an hilarious thread about top american players in the basugay world that depict just that kind of surreal.      Like that one time he used it against Cell and... never again.  He used it in his fight against Kid Buu though.        Show me a canon example of him traveling around with no living target.  see   between the living world and Other World,        He didn't. Read the manga. The Kid Buu battle lasts a couple chapters of them and it consists of them jerking each other off, and Vegeta's reflection, before Vegeta interferes and Goku tries to recharge his energy. He doesn't use IM at all.     Would that even work? Helicopters create strong winds. I'm pretty sure that any arrow not coming from straight above would completely miss the target.      Nadal on Clay allows him to become a Million Nadals     His targets have always had a ki signature, dead or otherwise. But you're right, I didn't phrase that perfectly.      The Kid Buu battle lasts a couple chapters of them and it consists of them jerking each other off,  Stop reading Dragon Ball Z yaoi hentai and mistaking it for canon.      between the living world and Other World   You mean when he locks on to the Ki signature of Supreme Kai/Gohan?      So Goku instant-transmits Buu to a Alderaan.  The Jedi can take care of him.         living      Supreme Kai   Gohan   Dead   Please stop shitposting.        can cut dimensions   still loses a lot and was too weak to participate in the last arc     Link please     too weak   He was, at least, going to try before being talked out of it to instead focus on his studies.        Is this show any good The titty manager piqued my interest     He couldn't even last against Sensui, and he was a weak S-level.  Take note, he never trained afterwards either.      bullshit techniques   no Musou Tensei   I'm surrounded by millennials.       No one lasted against Sensui, really. Hell, even demon Yusuke might have lost if Raizen didn't interfere.      No one lasted against Sensui  Yusuke lasted against Sensui before his ancestor curbstomped him. Also, they all leveled up significantly since then.  Kuwabara did not.        watching sports shows for the manager  That's almost as stupid as watching it for the token female "love interest" of the male lead.    How different would anime be without beam spam?      Djokovich outdoes the both of them by becoming this.     The only conceivable reason for cartoons to not develop energy beams is for them to be outlawed. Now tell me, who would outlaw energy beams? Steven Hawkins?       Yusuke lasted against Sensui   Yusuke was still on the losing end and was beginning to run out of power.   Also, they all leveled up significantly since then.   Kuwabara did not.   Yes, they trained for the tournament. Kuwabara did not. That's what I was saying - before the tournament was announced, Kuwabara was going to join Yusuke but was talked out of it by his sister. So he WOULD have leveled up had he gone. I'm not saying he wouldn't have been strong or won, just that the reason for him not being in the last arc had nothing to do with his strength.           Actually, if beam spam weren't conceptualized from the beginning, we'd have more martial arts fights instead of beam tug of wars.     Yusuke was still on the losing end and was beginning to run out of power.  Not in the least, his Rei-Gan almost killed Sensui had it not missed and those punches he could take with his iron body.   Kuwabara was going to join Yusuke but was talked out of it by his sister.  Rather easily too. Don't blame him, he's not going to make it at all.         Not really. If Dragonball didn't do it, something else would have. Shit, Ki/Chi/Nen were popular in eastern stories for centuries.     It's a very obvious thing to do. You cannot see bullets, so you need to draw their path into the air. You can see punches, but making them produce some energy aura just makes them seem more powerful. Energy beams are a cheap and highly effective tool.        Not really. If Dragonball didn't do it, something else would have.  This is a theoretical world where beam spam doesn't exist. Don't give me your inevitability of beam spam shit. Alternate worlds don't work that way.      Even if it did hit. The armor plates of modern attack helicopters could actually hold up against several hits from 23mm cannon before failing. Normal arrows wouldn't even leave a scratch.  It's magic arrow or some bullshit like that.      Why does Alex suck so much?  Even a retarded ginger teenager did better them him. Even with out magically flying swords, Shirou did better at deflecting with his sword play.  Alex had less sword projectiles to deal with, and he still got skewered, even before he got chained up.       Literally a meme servant  Iskandar is a bitch ass nigga who was all talk.   All he knows how to do is charge forward     what is plot armor  Also the VN version is completely different Shirou was nearly standing and was up close to Gilgamesh not letting up breath if he lets up for one second he is dead.    Iskander vs Gil &gt; Shirou vs Gil  In anime big guys with muscles are only there to job to make the pasty fuccbois look good.    Shirou   Pasty fuccboi      You heard me fuccboi    Dude tans so hard he looks like a goddamn Mexican.   Iskander fanboys are closeted homosexuals nine out of ten times.    closeted  I'd proudly get fucked by him any day.    Though Alexander would wreck shirous face in, Its a rock paper scissors situation  Can Rider jump 20 feet in the air going 60mph? Didn't fucking think so.   Iskander fanboys are homosexuals nine out of ten times. There, happy now?     He said nine out of ten. You're the tenth out of ten.     I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night     You're the 10 out out those 10   Gilgamesh actually respected Rider. This is why Gil deigned to use Ea against him. To Gil, Iskander is one of the few opponents truly worthy of the King's Sword.  On the other hand, as a shitty mongrel, Shirou wasn't. That's why Gil didn't use his insta-win drillsword against Shirou.     What did he achieve again?   Defeat Assasin  Wow   Rekt by Saber   Rekt by Gil            Alex   Rider      And he got fucked for it.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-nc<wbr>rDHH3z7g</wbr>  [ ]  You just don't mess with Shirous harem.      Alexander murdered his childhood friend.  Of course, he acts like a retarded nigger.     Gil was designed to win against anyone but Shirou. All Shirou had to do was copy himself and open his imagination zone and Gil's stupidity did the rest    What did he achieve again?  He got Gil's respect. Fucking Gilgamesh.      Unlike Alexander, Shirou would never allow Gil time to charge up Ea while being 3 football fields away from Gil.    He spent too much time fucking around instead of fucking shit up.    No one gives a shit about respect from a manchild like Gil.  I rather get respect from Zelretch who pushed back the Moon, itself.       Zelretch  literally who?     Like I said, big guys can't do jack shit even if they are hyped up.  Iskander's F/SN equivalent is Berserker, who's another big guy that doesn't achieve anything even if he's hyped as the strongest servant.  Let's what he did.  Fate  Wound an underpowered Saber   Kill Archer (after getting rekt 5 times)   Kill Shinji   jobs to Saber/Shirou   UBW  absolutely fucking nothing    jobs to Gil   HF  absolutely fucking nothing   jobs to Dark Saber   Big guys can't catch a break.                        For you.    Yeah rider a shit. Could have easily won if he wasnt so stupid.   Summon army and gangbang saber   run over Gilgamesh with chariot before he could even say mongrel.   Win holy grail.         That's literally what happens when you overuse projection magic     The bigger they are, the harder they job.   Iskandar is a GOAT character. Easily the second best Fate character, behind  Ilya__    Because forced comedic relief and jobber.    Berserker is a victim of "The Worf Effect", in each route he's thrown aside to showcase a powerful new villain or power-up.    Big people are always fated to lose in mythology like David versus Goliath, etc  Also, in the Trojan War, all the Greek heroes known to be big ass motherfuckers ended up dying while normal sized heroes ended up surviving.     But, didn't Gil use Ea at like, the start of the fight with Alex? If he didn't underestimate Shiroe, he probably could have won that too.   Big surprise, a RIDER famed for his Hetaroi sucked shit when alone, and on foot.    He also serves to keep Caster from being too active in Fate, at least.  Caster only got brave enough to do shit in UBW because Berserker failed to even wound a gimped Saber on the 3rd night.      As long as UBW was up, Shirou would have never given Gil the chance to use EA, it has too much start up to be effective inside UBW.  Riders RM starts him and his army a billion feet away from their enemy, so Gil can do w/e the fuck he wants.       literally who?     Gilgamesh wasn't as strong as he was before    THERE WAS A MOVIE ? Pls no    Is anybody here considering the fact that Rider had the most lackluster master to work with.   Rider had no idea Gil even had EA. Shirou would be rekt in 5sec in he had used it from the beginning.    He never would have though. Why would he used his ultimate weapon against a high school student?  Think of the people he's used it on. On just a pure hypothetical level, do you think Shirou matches up?      Because no one is allowed to make Saber look bad since she sells merchandise.  The amount of plot armor that Mary Sue has is ridiculous. There is NO explanation for her to beat RIDER at RIDING with a noble phantasm that's a chariot stolen from Zeus.      She didn't beat him. She caught up for one second using a top-line motorcycle pushed to its limits, filled with nitrous, reinforced with her armor, guided by Invisible Air, controlled with her energy, guided by her instinct, and helped with a bit of luck.     Implying Shirou would give a chance for Gil to power up Ea     It takes a literal second. He can take it out of the gate and charge it up before Saber can finish launching Excalibur. If Shirou wasn't close like he was at that point, he wouldn't be able to do anything.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=siN<wbr>SFBAM4CM</wbr>  [ ]  He literally showed that it takes just a few seconds. And that bit of power already fucked up Shirou.      I love how Shirou shit's his pants as soon as he sees it, despite not knowing what the fuck he just pulled out.    Isn't Alex one of the weaker bitches in the series? Let's first put out the master and assume btoh master's can't be hurt ala Extra.  F/Zero  Saber  Got Rekt  Archer  Got Rekt  Lancer  Probably would win if he gets up IH  Caster  Would wreck without being near the river  Beserker  Not really sure about this one. If we assume it's already in IH, he can't get any weapons but the army's.  Assassin  Wins this one  F/SN  Saber  Got Rekt  Archer  The RM thing is too much of a bother to think about so let's assume both won't use their RM. I think Archer would win if he would snipe. Head-on? I think Archer could handle it if he could handle Berserker in an enclosed castle.  Lancer  If we ignore Lancer's mano-a-mano rune, he still got his speed and the thrown version which should sorta be enough. And I seriously doubt a guy who survived hours with Gilgamesh could be that easily dogpiled.   Rider  I have no idea if Alex has anything that can stop Bellerophron.  Assasin  Can Assasin even be put into IH? Isn't he bound to the gate or something. I think Alex could win it.  Berserker  Nah.  F/Extra  Rider  Her guns and cannonscould probably shoot down a ton of dem dudes but I don't think it'd be enough.  Archer  Fuck no. Unless he plays dirty. and since Alex died to poison maybe that would help?  Caster  Probably not if we ignore the RM's.  Lancer (Vlad)  Actually, Vlad's Something Bay (summon spears around him) mar prove to be a good counter. Still, Id give it to Alex  Berserker (Arc)  Probably not. Maybe the weakened form.  Berserker (Liu Bu)  If Dynasty Warriors has taught me anything, Alex probably doesn't have a chance.  Assasin  Highly Likely. Still, dat Presence Concealment could fuck a ton of bitches up. Maybe even enough to dispell IH  Saber  Let me put it this way. The first time Alex used IH, it was at night, but in the RM it was day. It's always day in IH. Saber wins.                                                  *Fuck Yes    Now zero rider is being downplayed. Gilgamesh treated him seriously by using EA right from the start.    Can't practice surgery without an arm fuccboi Gil. License REVOKED.      He never used both arms, so this is fine.    Harem protagonist   Losing to the final villain  That's never gonna happen op. That's why everyone else jobs.      Shirou   Harem Protagonist   He ends up with one girl as a consequence of the route he's on.        Why don't you watch the episode again?  Shirou didn't even activate UBW yet.       I'm pretty sure he lost mainly because he and his army were shot with Ea. And fucking no one survives that broken shit.    Numerous harem anime/VN have the protagonist end up with one girl.    There isn't even a harem to begin with in FSN. Look at the way the story unfolds.    If you actually belive Shirou could beat Gil when he uses EA you are just beyond saving.    But that was his surgery arm.     implying he isn't ambidextrous  mongrel.     What about the "good endings"?    Shirou is only in a romantic relationship with Rin at the end of UBW Good. You have to make assumption that there's going to be a three-way.    If you actually believe, Gil could get a chance to use Ea in UBW which responds to Gil's actions far faster than Gil can react, you are beyond saving.   The author himself said Shirou is not as strong as any servants you retards. He only beats Gil because he underestimated him. Please stop your fanwanking.   UBW never did anything ''far faster'' than GoB. It's a bit faster, yes, and it could counter every blade Gil fired, but Shirou had to bumrush him and force Gil to lose momentum by shattering his swords to seal the deal.    its a bad movie too.    Your average anime fan can't self insert as a big guy is my guess why. I heard something about Japan calling the new fit Ike for "gorilla Ike", so maybe they don't like big guys I dunno.    What if   sword hilts popping out from ground with enough force to push him forward or up into the air        I heard something about Japan calling the new fit Ike for "gorilla Ike", so maybe they don't like big guys I dunno.  The ガチムチ　ゴリマチョ is actually a good epithet in the Jap gay community, if they say a big character is a Gorilla it usually has positive sexual undertones.     You forgot  easily fights off Lancer (even if he wasn't using his full strength)   fights both Caster and Assassin at the same time while being weighed down by Caster's boundary field       this is the best post ive ever seen    Oh really? Thanks for clarifying    If we follow the actual Zero novel, Gilgamesh actually opened the full GoB since the beginning against Iskandar.   In other words, he wasn't playing. The anime made it look far less serious.      He's not MC or MC's servant so of course he lost, no need to think too hard about it. It's actually a good thing Rider could manage to be an actual inspiring character with no "muh powerlevel" involved.     It's actually a good thing Rider could manage to be an actual inspiring character with no "muh powerlevel" involved.  This    Fate is shounen wet dream where Japanese highschoolers get to beat up actual accomplished heroes from other countries to prove how superior nippon is. If you're a gaijin and hope to see your country's heroes get to do awesome stuff in this kind of setting then you're simply out of luck.   We technically don't even know what Shirou's race is.    Is this bait or you're just desperate?    We actually don't. We have no clue who his parents were.    He's a ginger. Maybe he's half Irish or something?    I wouldn't say that's impossible. There isn't a single main cast member who isn't at least partially European.    That's what jobbing is. Lurk less on TV Tropes.    So Kondo and Sorachi are considered to be sexy?    Rider has red hair, maybe he's Shirous dad    I've seen people say he and Ryuunosuke could be related.    the fuck    He would be avenging his father in UBW by killing Gilgamesh then. What goes around must come back around.    It's like poetry    Hell, it's pretty much stated that if Hercules was another class (Read: prettier) he would have fared much better.  It's anime logic at work.      Dude he cant win because that would be bad story telling. if the strongest would beat everyone it would be cheap.In every Route we awesome Bersarker is even if he lose. you need love m8.because without love it can not be seen.       A Japanese anime for Japanese people.  No one expects something different.  If this was an american novel or graphic novel , the American wizard (or the hero of the story) would defeat the foreigners enemy.       But according to /fit/ manlet always get BTFO.     Why does Alex suck so much?   Because the writers are retarded  IH is supposed to be an EX rank NP but basically everyone and his mom can beat it.        Is it so hard to imagine that a nation full of manlets would write a fictional world where manlets win against big guys?  Gilgamesh just happens to be King of Manlets tier, surely that's not a coincidence. But he get BTFO by people even smaller than him.       Kirei?   Why didn't Gilgamesh just wear his armor?   I'm like to think that Rider would defeat anyone in that war, except for Gil because Ea was too op. Saber was frightened as fuck when Al-Iskandar summon his army.  but yeah, i'm just delusional.       Frodo no.    But if you read the Trojan War, only the manlets survived and a manlet like Paris killed quite a lot of big guys.    Rider's shitty army couldn't even damage Caster's tentacle creature.    Actually, do we know anything about Risei's wife?    Greeks thought little boy bum was pretty cool. They aren't exactly a bastion of masculinity    Well it's Saber, so the writers would find a way for her shitty swordbeam to wipe out his entire army despite max targets being only 1000, on top of also somehow destroying his Gordius Wheel.  It's Saber after all.      Kirei isn't Risei's biological son, he's just some random orphan he came across while on a pilgrimage.    No wait, I'm being fucking retarded. Kirei was adopted, right? So his origins are about as much up in the air as Shirou's.   Is the Fate series actually good or is it just shit like Naruto that has constant threads up mostly because it's popular with normies?   Plenty of people like it, yes.     use Reality Marble   put enemy 5 FUCKING MILES away   "lel I bet this will look cool!"  Literally the shitiest king.       Nigz, Rider always lead the army from the front cause m-muh glory. It's pretty much like painting him red and giving him a sign saying "Shoot here!" for Saber. Don't forget that he's petty and prideful like most other kings.    No servant can damage that thing besides Gilgamesh and Saber.  Even Heracles and Cu would be useless against it.  It's times like this where you notice how the plot is so contrived just to make Saber look good.  Oh THANK GOOD your ebin swordbeam just happens to be Anti-Fortress! XD  Meanwhile every other "raw power" NP like Bellerophon and the Wheel somehow is Anti-Army even though there's NEVER A FUCKING ARMY TO FIGHT IN THIS FUCKING STORY          She's such a marysue it hurts.    What if he materialized his army above Gil's head?   Gil respected Iskander and took him seriously, Eaing him as soon as he popped his RM.  Gil was laughing at shirou and mocking him until he lel cut his arm because he even hesitated to use Ea when Shirou was coming at him faster than Lancelot's jet.  Gil would've demolished Shirou in one second if he decided to took him seriously.         Caster's tentacle creature   Caster was not even his true class and even so he was a pain the ass.      NO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK  NOW READ THIS... YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITH YOUR EYES OPEN      Without knowing Gil's weakness, all he did was pouring fire into a pond no matter how strong he and his legion is For that he's only unfortunate      As obvious as it seems to you and me, there's people who don't get it.     He was too tall to be a nip anyways.    Nigz, anti-this or anti-that is just the area of effect the main power of the NP has on. Anti-World is a special case special weapons with special properties.    GO TELL THAT TO MY BRO, GANDALF, CRACKA!     Gil would've demolished Shirou in one second if he decided to took him seriously.   that the full point. Gil is an asshole. It's like if Saber decide to deal with Kirei without sword, armor and only with martial arts.      Thank god I'm not the only one thinking that was complete fucking garbage.    Remember Alex is a king who doesn't pull dirty tricks, call it pride or stupidity    Sorry but Hercules would wreck Caster's monster.  Caster's monster only stays alive due to Caster hiding somewhere in its body.   Hercules is the only Servant that can actually get down and dirty in the water and plow his way through the monster until he kills Caster since his whole body is a weapon.        What if he materialized Gil into the ground?    Is there where I should reply with &gt;lel serious gil doesnt exist meme?     plow his way through the monster  It instantly regenerates. INSTANTLY. Are you fucking retarded?      YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITH YOUR EYES OPEN  That's actually false though.     Same as Hercules except Hercules also gains immunity.   Are you the one that is retarded, instead?      the larger the legend the more powerful the hero   except when it's not   the older the legend the more powerful the hero   except when it's not  Iskandr in a nut shell       We do not know. Theoretically, any servant could find a way, but there are rules of story that only the protagonits can do it for plot.  PS:I would love to see Artutia as Caster. I am sure that would be adorably incompetent, all serious and professional, but unable to do any shit.       literally who?   not knowing the most powerful magi      What if he materialized Gilgamesh right in the center of his army; totally surrounded.    It's an inferior version of all the Greek monsters Hercules ever fought.  A slow moving, mindless creature compared to the Hydra or Lion.      Being foreinger is a big deal in Japan, if he even has a small trait of non-japanese, it would be brought up already. Theres literally no reason to think Shirou could be any race other than Japanese.    Sure and Shinji and Sakura are aliens because they have purple and blue hair.       Doesn't matter. Gate of Babylon is most probably omnidirectional if needed.     implying Sakura isn't an alien.     It's not just Hercules. All Servants are hyped up to be next level shit and they just job harder and harder as the story continues through further routes.     Implying he can gangbang saber  She can wipe them out with Excalibur   implying he can run over Gilgamesh before he could say mongrel  Archer class can see what's coming from miles away. And berserker was stlll alive after one run over.  I'm a bit surprised that no one is defending Rider. His skills might not be great, but his personality is the best in Fate franchise.          Fuyuki is actually home to a large number of foreigners. Remember the western styled church? Rin, Sakura, Shinji, none of them are completely Japanese.    And Saber is also a Japanese girl doing cosplay of a Western. I hate how they have made her a yamato nadeshiko.       John Cena, the servant      unfortunately.   Oh, i'm so damned, my blood is corrupt and impure.       I'm a bit surprised that no one is defending Rider.  Because he doesn't need to be defended? He's overall well liked.  but his personality is the best in Fate franchise.  It's a Gilgamesh Lite like Nero, while he's one of my favorite servants I really don't see what's so special about him.       Saber and Shirou are the ultimate John Cena duo  Them beating Heracles was the ultimate John Cena moment and the greatest asspull in Fate      Cu is more likable than Alexander.    Rider can fly using his chariot.      yfw Kotomine is Vince and Cu is Steve Austin   Everything makes so fucking sense right now....       Alexander the Great   conquer half of the known world with a shield and lance   isn't summoned as lancer   blah blah blah "he was a shit warrior", who gives a fuck, Saber isn't even a top 10 KotRT and you see how that turns out.  Just let him summon the PROUD SONS OF MACEDON, and let em Phalanx the shit out of anything and everything.  do you think Kayneth originally intended for this to occur?           There's also the fact that Rin can't pin point where Archer is from initially. If he looked Japanese, wouldn't she be able to figure that out? Shirou being mixed is not a complete impossibility.    By that logic no one is completely one race. Shirou is seen as Japanese and represents the undying Yamato spirit, that's what matters.    I don't see how Nero and Iskander have the similar personality. Their reality marbles reflects that, one is a narcissist, and the other is a king.   Same with Gil, Gil has been a tyrant more than a king. Iskander's personality is that of a true king.       You end up turning into a Mexican?     Dynasty Warriors  Underated post     Cu is a bro, but he is mainly good for one thing.    It damages your cells  So basically they are saying being a nigger is equivalent to having damages cells      I think it's a little different if you only go back a generation or two. You can easily tell in the looks (at least in real life). Rin, Sakura, and hell even Shinji, all had European grandparents.  Shirou is just kind of left ambiguous, though Rin questions Archer at one point asking if he knew Saber back in medieval times when trying to guess his origin.      Isn't it the same? All Mexicans cells are damaged by default.    Achilles   not Lancer class   Nice game Fatebabbies      No, Alexander acts more like a general than a true king.   Alexander only cared about war.  Administration, paperwork, etc he never did that shit and just left to it his advisory because warring in foreign nations was his whole adult life.       would Philip II be a Rider/lancer than Iskandr?   His hardcore fanbase always shouting he's the best and that his "fight" against Gil was the best thing ever (this shit was the worst one of the serie) manage to make me hate him even though I liked the guy at first.  So yeah, seems like a fanbase can even make you hate a character that isn't bad at all. But this fucker is way too overhyped.      Well,shit.  If things like paperwork are being taken into account then that narrows being a " true" king/queen down to very small number throughout history and legends.     If you are into actual fighting scenes then Gil vs rider is ass, hell it's barely even a fight. People like it for the emotional impact, and the atmosphere where you have too acient Kings going against each other out of pure respect was simply epic.    He's a powerlevelbabby so the only thing that appeals to his infantile mind are ebin fights with asspulls justified through Nasu's "genius" writing.   Is this considered an essential must-watch anime?   Yes it's worth watching (at least the first stage). The eurobeat is awesome     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xu9<wbr>JdmpSMLI</wbr>  [ ]   elevens don't realize this song is about snorting cocaine     listen to eurobeat while   cycling   end up going way faster and not even getting tired   Driving is for normies anyway.      really loud eurobeats   I just recently got my driver's license   how do I drift      [HorribleSubs] Ore Monogatari!! - 12 [720p].mkv   slut  Suna! Call the police! Takeo was violated!  Is it hamsterbanana time?  You should use spoilers for NSFW content.   No you shouldn't. That's explicitly against the rules.    Yes you should. That's explicitly follows the rules.      Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards.       I like how Suna was scared when Takeo came in his room asking for a favour. You could really hear it in his voice.  so did everyone drop this?   Yamato was too much of a slut.    Nope it's just there are more people with shit taste watching shows like hibike   Oh baby its time  I haven't seen the episode but allow me to get   kyaaaaaaa   kyaaaaaaaaaa   SUKIDA   for 20 minutes   no plot or characters in sight   Suna sighs because he hates being here          Takeo's dad would be a handsome man if it weren't for his all black eyes. He looks frightening.   Incoming doujin were he cucks his son    Anon please. Takedad wants his women with some meat on her bones. Also I'm sure his wife could beat the shit out of him if he tried    the people on /a/ are way too mature for shows like this    No but most people are going to let it finish then marathon it. It's a good show but it just kinda drags at some parts   Suna is really giving me more and more gay vibes.   mfw this season    You marathon romcoms or else they aren't as good    I'm watching but I rarely drop by on the threads.    with the others, waiting to marathon it   Yamato's mannerisms were so damn cute this episode   I wish I could marathon it, but I can't help but watch it now. It's too damn good      Man I really like this anime. In most romances it is some normal, nice guy, with above average grades dating a pure girl who would never imagine doing sexual things.  In Ore Monogatari, though, the protagonist is not some decent student but a really tough jock who gets all the women to like him. He doesn't go for nice girls but prefers to fuck sluts who want to hold hands with him and do things to him when he sleeps.     When is the new girl going to appear and NTR that slut Yamada    implying they won't both cuck their son for Yamato     Holy quads batman      No <br/>    So Tekeomom wishes some grandsons?   MFW All doujins featuring Tekeo dad NTRing his son.    No even practicing on Suna?     Suna-kun, I have to practice getting a blowjob!    Why the fuck is the handsome as fuck dad with someone like her?    Love is stupid that or she is really good in the sack ugly girls give the best head    Chapter 14 translation when?   She started off as a young, petite, pretty thing like Yamato.  Then she gave birth to a human mountain. That does things to the body. Things that aren't always pleasant.      Real life/reality sucks. That's why we watch anime.  Faggot.      His voice is really weird for some reason.     She was a wrestler before she got married, man. Takeo's dad probably just viewed anything less as not enough of a challenge. I mean think about it, would it be much of a rodeo if people had to ride cows instead of bulls?     Same reason why Yamato is with Takeo.     What the fuck is this food?   Salisbury steak or rissoles with pineapple and a salad.       It just works      thought this post was a bit too early to make that assessment   thought people would start flooding in   "m-maybe there's another thread?"   there isn't   people actually dropped this         More for us.   Has Yamato's voice gotten less annoying?   Nope. I still have diabetes   I love Takeo's parents.   It's not the type of show where there'll always be a lot of discussion.      People don't deserve this show, it's too cute!   This is the only romance anime that i actually can relate to.   I'm still watching, but I usually end up too happy to visit /a/ afterwards I was just here for webms  No need for negativity after all that heart-melting goodness       Are you also a slut then? pft, I bet you'd want to  make a good impression on his parents before announcing your engagement  too, you lustful maneater     I really don't like anime romance because its always the same boring cliche stuff but this show really breaks every cliche. 9/10 show so far and everyone can watch it and have a good time.       this show really breaks every cliche   That's a good and a bad thing though, like when  the anime catches up to the end of the manga where it subverts their happiness with Yamato ending up in the hospital and dying from the same heart condition that took Suna's dad.   ;_;         All moon mothers want grandkids.   The lack of hamsterbanana in this thread is disturbing.   Episode 13 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato being jealous Episode 14 - Ai and Oda part 1 Episode 15 - Ai and Oda part 2  And the chapter you're talking about is somewhere in volume 5, while episode 14 is the start of volume 4.       So, was this the season finale or are we getting more episodes after this one?    that fucking QUALITY      There going to be 26 episodes.    You have to be suicidal to do that.     It's confirmed 24 episodes, might be a week off next week      Neat. Thanks.     It's two cours, supposedly 26 episodes. Scanlations only go up to the first couple chapters of volume 4 (the latter of which was only actually typeset a couple months ago using an old translation posted here back in August). And this was included with the newest scanlated chapter, meaning it's a bit later after , especially since this is somewhere in volume 5.  Chapters are supposedly contained stories, so the first three episodes where Takeo and Yamato meet and get together is one chapter/story, and the most recent scanlated one is the 13th chapter.       might be a week off next week  No break next week; business as usual; no delay either: http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/detail<wbr>/21841686.html</wbr>     Chapter 1 - Takeo and Yamato (episodes 1-3) Chapter 2 - Ai Sunakawa (episodes 5-6) Chapter 3 - Yamato's friends and the fire (episode 4) Chapter 4 - Judo competition (episode 7) Chapter 5 - Yamato's birthday and Sunakawa's dad's surgery Part 1 (episode 8) Chapter 6 - Yamato's birthday and Sunakawa's dad's surgery Part 2 (episode 9) Chapter 7 - Hiking and lost in the woods (episode 10) Chapter 8 - Going to the beach (episode 11) Chapter 9 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato's jealousy (episode 13) Chapter 10 - Studying (episode 12) Chapter 11 - Ai and Oda (episodes 14-15) Chapter 12 - Sports tournament? (episode 16?) Chapter 13 - Athletic meet, Swedish relay, and Mariya (episode 17?) Chapter 14 -   I'm not sure about chapter 6 onward. It sounds like it's part of chapter 5 honestly, but I'm going by what Batoto says. If Batoto's wrong, it means chapter 13 will happen in episode 18 or 19.  There's also the chapter where Yamato is in some baking competition or class or something, and one of the chefs falls for her, and there's all the KISSU chapter, and I have no idea when that happens in terms of story placement, but I think it would make sense to have it in the last episode.   Aah, thank you.                        24 episodes   This better not go full Kimi on me, I am not putting up with 24 episodes of "Oh I hope this person who obviously likes me likes me" bullshit      I think it's kinda cute now, though I think I've just gotten used to it by now.    Try 3. The only thing you're gonna be waiting on is the KISSU (which does eventually happen going by manga raws), because Takeo and Yamato get cockblocked every time they're about to try it.    It's not like that. Also, try Horimiya. It's a manga, but it's not full of misunderstandings.     That Slut!    Is that actually what she said?    Is so fuck, type 2 inbound        Thank you for censoring the niggerlips. This pleases me.   gotta love how suna just noped the fuck out of the way of that incoming shot.    Nope. This series is so uplifting that I need to watch it every wednesday so I don't become an hero.    Please be trolling. PLEASE.    Seriously? After all the NTR and homo shitposting you're still worried about crap like that? How many thousands of times do you guys have to hear it said? This isn't that kind of show.      I got everything I wanted from the first three episodes. The rest of the episodes just seemed like extra credit to me.    two weeks for the exams.   zero motivation to study.   this episode comes out.     reminded there I have no qt girlfriend to study with       Still on the grind anon? Is it   summer quarter   already?    yep, still on the grinder. Spring semester officially ends this Monday then exam season till the 24th.     Chapter 9 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato's jealousy (episode 13)   Fucking finally. The three of them always hang out, yet there is next to no conflict or relationship between Suna and Yamato.  Either make them bros or have them catfight to see who wins the takeo bowl, but for the love of god stop making them so neutral of each other.       I dont understand the problem, Two Takeo's plus two Yamato's would be great, it opens up so many options, orgies, swapping, One couple stays at home having mad sex while the other goes to school and they swap daily. if one Yamato gets incapacitated from her sexual duties you always have a backup.    It was a girl's college  Ok, I chuckled.     Yamato isn't jealous of Suna. After celebrating Suna's birthday together, Takeo and Yamato are taking the train back home when they see a girl getting getting groped by someone like with Yamato. Takeo springs into action and scares him away, only to discover the girl was Satou from middle school, the girl he used to have a crush on. After a slightly awkward stare between her and Yamato, Takeo and Yamato leave and talk about her, and Takeo accidentally lets it slip that he had liked her in the past (he mentions what Sunakawa said about the girls he liked talking behind his back). Yamato becomes downcast and unresponsive, and Takeo realizes he fucked up by saying that. He goes to Suna for advice, and they agree that hiding it from Yamato would have been wrong, though Takeo still regrets not handling it better. Takeo thinks that it would be best to give up helping people so that Yamato won't get like this anymore, but finds that he can't. The next day, Yamato still has the same downcast expression, and then Satou calls Takeo (she still had his number from middle school) and asks for help, because the same creep from the train was waiting outside the store she was in, waiting for her.  Yamato convinces Takeo to help her, he scares the guy off, Satou goes to thank him, and Takeo shows that he's holding hands with Yamato and tells Satou that she's his girlfriend. Takeo tries to apologize to Yamato after, but Yamato says she's the one who should be apologizing for getting unnecessarily jealous over a situation like that. Takeo helps people by nature, and if some girls end up falling for him in the process (which actually does happen in chapter 13), so be it, and she's prepared to fight for him, even though she knows that Takeo is for everyone. Takeo promises her that he'll always be just hers, at least until he's helping someone, but then he'll be just hers again right after.     Suna you glorious bastard, I love you.   I can't drop it, it's become my weekly life support now.    I dropped this. Did they  fuck ?     Maria, if you happened to get your hands on these you could go see it together! (believe those are movie tickets)   Pass me the ruler   Oh.   !!!  There you go. You're welcome.        I dropped it  I thought it was pretty damn cute but then I realized it's 24 episodes and immediately thought that I couldn't do it anymore      It's a hamburger without the buns. Normal, sliced bread and buns aren't actually all that common in Japanese diets.     Fuck.     There's the unspoken To-love-rule though. If it's only boobs and it's relevant to the discussion you can post it on /a/, as long as it's spoiler tagged.    There's some things you're not supposed to say,  like how if a post gets enough reports it'll automatically be deleted    Yamato being so lewd is my favorite part of this anime.  Takeo dies. Suna takes it even worse than Yamato and blames himself. She comforts Suna telling him Takeo won't like him acting this way. They get together and have a son named Takeo   Checked     Yamato being so lewd  Is this actual lewdness, or just muh hand-holding     She's horny all the time, it's actual lewdness.    What do you think?    Picked up again.   If I had to guess, I'd say hand-holding and hugs.        Naruto dies. Sasuke takes it even worse than Sakura and blames himself. She comforts Sasuke telling him Naruto won't like him acting this way. They get together and have a son named Naruto.   Sorry, I just saw stupid shit like this all the time years ago.      Are you implying hand-holding isn't lewd? What kind of sick fuck are you to think that way?     Dropping AOTS    So were they just afraid to color him black? It's clear as day that he's supposed to be a black dude.   But I  didn't   I guess I'll give this some time while waiting for the summer season...     https://d.maxfile.ro/lnziczbzwu.web<wbr>m   audio version  </wbr>    Takeo-kun... now I am more suited to be with you... come... this way... follow me.     This, the show makes me feel too good and I don;t wanna ruin that feeling.   Pls   I just got bored. I think the last episode I saw was the one before Yamato's birthday.    That's a dangerous misinterpretation of the situation.    I keked so hard at this hahahah    I can't drop a show because OCD but fuck this is hard.  This show is awful. Fucking awful. I expect Togo Duke high school life and I got that cringe worthy garbage..      i felt like i should have seen that twist coming too    Same, it just makes me feel warm inside. It's like happy pills you take after a bad day.     I marathoned the first 8 episodes and it was exhausting  I enjoy it more now that I can only watch it once a week      What's good about this crappy show?  I saw better fanfic in bioware forum.      Swedish relay  Will we get that delicious Suna ass.     No, you just get to watch a stuck up girl named Mariya fall for Takeo because he helps train her for the relay and doesn't care that she's slow and weighing the team down.   Why is Sunas sense of humor so shit?    This shit is 24 episodes  For what reason?     Because he's gay for Takeo and thinks everything he does is qt and funny.     This shit isn't 240 episodes  For what reason?      A plot was established in this episode    K-Ons have the best fashion sense.  That they do.    I can only imagine how the boys in their world can't stop drooling as soon as they show up.     Just watched this episode   I wasn't told about this, why am I crying to moeshit?       rhythm   rock      Those are whore party clothes  Today I will remind them.  I want to obsess over the kind of clothes I wear too. Why is mens fashion so boring?   So true. Men's fashion is a fucking bore, unless you're part of the 1% of exceptional looking men who can pull of actual high fashion looks without looking retarded.    Because you're a kyoanifag and the cancer killing anime.     plebs not recognizing Azusa's effay as fuck Comme des Garcons Ann Demeulemeester head to toe     I think the taxi driver in London was the only man in their entire world.   I haven't read the manga and I'm about to finish season 2. Who else joins after the 3rd years graduate? Jun said she would and I guess Ui will to, but they still need someone to play drums and piano. I don't really want to touch the manga because I'm still hoping they'll make a third season.   See now if you do start the manga you're going to read it from the biased point of view of a KyoAnifag and won't be able to fully enjoy it if you tried. Shame, everything was done so much better in the manga. I think KyoAni missed the fundamental point of the series with their adaption, but having seen that adaption first you wouldn't be able to accept that.    There's Ritsu's otouto and the guy in the music store where they bought Yui's guitar off the top of my head.    The school's headmaster, the one of whom Sawako lives in constant fear.  There's Ritsu's otouto  Anime original. That music store clerk though, God bless his soul.        Anime original  If you're going off the manga, you can throw in Yui's father (that's right, kyoanifags).     Chitanda, is that you?    Azusa could literally wear fucking cargo shorts with socks &amp; sandals and she'd still be the cutest    Yui's parents are shown in the movie, too.    I think she did that once. No, she was not the cutest.    Did the gang meet them?    I demand proofs Azusa is always the cutest     How does she play guitar with those hands?    The Mustang is better for people with smaller hands    She played in the same band as Akiyama Mio. You can not make those kinds of statements.    Mustang is a smaller scale guitar.    I can and will m80, what are you going to do about it   I want to cum on Ritsu's  feet.   I'm in love with Mugi!  And I hope those Mugicucks are fucking dead!    I'm going to post Mio.    I do hope you're a woman making that statement.    Then I'll have no choice but to post the angel of HTT   So if among us guitar fags, how mant HTT songs can you play to completion?  Fuwa Fuwa Time need not apply.     I'm not, but my hair is woman-length and I'm pretty frail, so I'm sure she'd be able to accept it.    They only called her that because they felt guilty for leaving her out as they prepared for college entrance exams which were important because they all wanted to go to the same high-ranking school Mugi got recommended into because they wanted to stay together as friends after high school because the world does not end after high school fucking KyoAnus.    The fundamental point was growing up both in the manga and anime. Since the manga is a 4koma it wasn't nearly as emotional or had the same impact as its adaptation. Too bad your anti KyoAni mindset has blinded you    The called her and angel because she is one    10. Go Go Maniac is the best.      The world does not end after highschool   But anon, it does.       Have you actually read the manga? Its primary gags are paced around the 4 koma but there is a continuous storyline among pages.    I started learning to play the guitar just to be able to play Fuwa Fuwa Time.    Have you actually watched the anime? It's primary gags are paced around scene by scene but there is a continuous storyline among the season.    And the point of that comment was?    Try to bash on KyoAni by responding with a completely irrelevant statement to the fact that KyoAni's adaptation is miles ahead of its source material despite both telling the same story?    If you actually read the manga instead of being a retarded kyoanifag you would know that they do not at all tell the same story and that everything you have said up until now has been out of ignorance.     Fuwa Fuwa Time got me back into playing.   Once you get the opening riff down it feels like sex coming out of your amp.       They pretty much do tell the same story my little anti KyoAni babby. But keep crying I'm really enjoying your tantrums.       he says having never read the manga (or proably never having watched the anime either)      Get a room you fuckign nerds     Have you read the manga? No? Shut the fuck up, Black Jack.    Yes actually    Then you'd be able to answer trivia questions? You understand that failure to answer them correctly would determine your opinion to be invalid?   The anime actually expands upon the source material. The manga is just another crude 4koma. KyoAni fleshed out the characters and gave them more personalities. K-On anime is simply better.   You haven't read the manga, you don't know what you're talking about.    I have. But its pretty clear that you haven't watched the anime    Do you know where you are? Do you know what the K-ON! anime is?     What a silly post by a silly person. What the fuck are you even saying     What is the argument device called where a person knows full well they know nothing of a subject, and in order to mask this ignorance they shall imply that their opponent also doesn't know these things? Because I feel that's what you're doing, and I won't stand for it.   I'm worried about them. They are alre ady in college and haven't met a single guy to go out with. At this point they be alone like Sawa   Only Ritsu. Who gets who? Let the people who supposedly have also read the manga figure it out.    Nice job projecting this hard, anon.     It's funny because think about this for a second.  You spent a minute or two typing up that paragraph, and thought about it in order to reply to me.  And that's your entire life anon.  Also, you're post is retarded because the anon asked if you've seen it, yet you reply with "It's an anime, do you know where you are". Which is irrelevent because that has no bearing on the topic at hand. Technically you haven't answered the question           Had pretty much dropped guitar until I watched K-On, it got me back into it. I can play most of them besides a couple solos. I like to arrange acoustic renditions of songs too.    See I beat K-ON! Houkago Live!! after I finished everything else to do with the franchise. There is nothing you know that I don't.    This is what is known as projection.    Not that guy but he's right wouldn't call the manga "crude" but the anime did everything the manga did but better. Fantastic adaptation.     You really are retarded aren't you  Don't you have a book report coming up or something       You literally read a few chapters of volume 1 then closed your manga reading program, didn't you?    You keep projecting.    I literally paid for hard copies.  What do you think the manga did better, besides fanservice?    Would you want a S3? K-On restart was kind of shit to be honest but KyoAni could work its magic and turn turd into gold like they did with Lucky Star    I don't think you know what that means    I'd watch it         Most of the new characters are just too unlikeable    I did too. Have you actually read yours? Or did you just buy them for completeness?     Nobody cares, you fucking faggots.      Suddenly, this became a cringe thread.     Jesus Christ lad you are literally autism incarnate  All of you read back on your arguments now and ponder on how fucking stupid you sound     What's the first thing that comes through your mind?   that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude.   Calling the FBI now.   Ghost cunny.    I think they're used too much. I mean, you don't need that prop to show they're e--ary students, that should be obvious from how they already look   Puffy vulvas   Quzilax    [x]Smooch loli tummy    Those look really uncomfortable.  Who the fuck makes a backpack out of non-breatheable material?  3DP VC         i'm thinking there's this one company that produces all the randosels in Japan, and they got some lobby/bribery scheme with all the schools to keep it that way.    How the hell every Japanese family can afford one? They're like five hundred dollars each.    They don't have to replace them and japanese families usually have 1 or 2 kids    Tradition   It's cheaper in Japan. Also it's strong. They can use it until they finish Elementary/Grade school.       These backpacks look so comfortable to wear.    rape   That thing is erotic as fuck, I would buy one if I had a little girl around here.   Raep.    Why is that backpack 3dpd?   This is pretty likely.       This. My first thought was. Expensive Bags.      It's cheaper in Japan   No: http://ranking.rakuten.co.jp/daily/<wbr>301055/</wbr>       Oh, it's backpack sized. I thought it was a belt-pouch or something.  This thread makes more sense now.      Holy shit, no wonder nips don't want to reproduce. That's insanely expensive.    loli porn    We had ransel back in elementary school, but they were all brown and wider.  Fuck ussr female school uniform, it sucked.     Please translate I cannot read moonrunes. I can see a varying prices ranging from 1000+ yen to 54000+ yen. Tell me that the 54000 are the posh ones while the 1000 ones are the common plebian bags.     nice blog, post pics    Symphogeah is so popular yet its subs are never consistent. Truly suffering.  Remember that bullshit with commie not subbing the final episode until month+ later   A little boy wearing nothing but white socks and ransel, waiting on a desk  Excitement!!   It's high quality backpack and can last through your entire grade school session(which is like 6 years), I wouldn't say it's expensive at all.    The question now is "how strong is it?"  I imagine that unless you got run over by a Japanese truck, that bag should last forever.      The word 'randosel'.  Does anyone else actually visualize the spelling of the word first, or do they jump straight to associated images?     St. Margareta.   Yep. Made out of 200 components fabricated using Japanese technology. I've watched some parts of a show about how it's made (The Mark of Beauty on NHK World) and it shows how autistic Japan goes when it comes to aesthetics and detail.   Honestly, I started thinking about how nice it would be if I could have someone like Lili from DanMachi in Diablo 3.   And then I thought a little bit about how that role wouldn't work for a character in an MMO because no way in hell would anyone let someone else pick up all the loot. It just makes no sense in game design but it does make a bit of sense in the context of the story.  Sorry, I gave more than the first thing.      I am going to jail and it's going to fucking suck and not even be mildly pleasant   I didn't even know the word. And also, no.     Very Loli.   I keep hearing that it's sturdy and will last until the kid is in middle school (when they stop using them), but even the cheap ones seem to be around 220 USD. For six years, that's around 36 a year, that's way more than replacing the backpack when needed  Am I just dumb or are these that much cheaper in Japan?    Worst fucking prop. I want my rape victims to be intelligent enough to fully process what's happening to them. Elementary schoolers don't cut it.    that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude   Cardcaptor Sakura?      Apples.      You did not just talk about Sakura like that.    Pretty sure it's Yoiko Funny anime. Like SYD but good     Tiny, undersized backpacks.    Recorder to Randoseru     Amatuers     I'd stick it in her fanny pack.    swimsuits and thigh-highs    Cash.    Looks like a mailbox    You can get a $40 Jansport backpack that lasts 6 years. This sounds more like a way to show off to the other parents.    its even in the name    kawaii as fuck http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ui_a<wbr>7ahBaDU</wbr>  [ ]    Why do my kids keep leaving their backpacks in my room?    That I want one, solely for the fact that they're so commonly used and so expensive. They must be really amazing somehow. But I won't get one because I'm not a little kid and don't like using backpacks.      "I wonder if Jlist still sells those"is my thought.    This photo of Aoi with a red backpack that resembles a randoseru.   This      Kyon-kun Denwa       That's been made impossible by the number of adults who look and sound like e--ary students running around. We need extra confirmation.     e--ary  What is e--ary?     小○生   Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions): https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true  Previous Thread: https://archive.moe/a/thread/127083<wbr>562/</wbr>   </wbr></wbr>    How do you propose going from deciphering to fluent reading without looking things up?    Keep deciphering and studying until you get it. I don't know why that other guy is going on about "negative attitudes", being pragmatic doesn't mean being negative or cynical, nor is it meant to discourage people who know very little. Your attitude is your own.    Depends on how you look at it. There are several hundred usages of common particles and structures which are taught as 'grammar'. There are also several tens of thousands of words to learn.   If you invest time into grammar and reading the chances are the gaps in your knowledge will be vocabulary based long, long before they are structural comprehension/grammar based. On the flip side the wider you read the more unknown words you will come across. Grammar as a formal or structured approach to study is probably multitudes less involved, time wise, than the process of vocabulary acquisition. Have a balances study of both and you will see for yourself which is harder or easier for you. It is hard to give a cut and dry answer without it being misleading.       Thanks anons.

Refrain    First, I'd like to say that my free 1+ hour ended long ago, so maybe I'd look into translating these, but only tomorrow at the very earliest. The game comes first.  Next, due to quality translation concerns, I'd greatly appreciate it if the Japanese raws are also available for me to cross-reference with if I should have doubts about the Chinese translated text (which is rather often, to say the least).  Now, about the doujin themselves: The first 3 look good (and the nip raws are available on sadpanda, too), but the 4th looks like by the time I get around to starting on it, it'd have been translated, and since I'm not too big on anal, the 5th will be of a lower priority. On top of that, sadpanda doesn't have the nip raws for it so that's another point against it, at least unless some other site has it.  Well then, back to world 4 weekly.          </blockquote>]
