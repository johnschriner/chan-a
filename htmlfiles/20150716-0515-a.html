[ What's so bad about NTR?    You're basically asking What's so bad about a story with a none logical plot  <br> enough to fuck your shit up royally! </br>  nothing tbh, yuri is still better tho  monitoring this thread  <br> reading hentai for plot </br>  <br>Isn't this just plain rape? People should just stop calling NTR to everything.</br>  <br><br>Are you really that much of a beast so eager to sexually relieve yourself in anyway possible that you don't solely enjoy stories where people love each other so much they want to have sex? <br><br>Does your erection make your heart stop working? Do you cease to feel? <br><br>Are you some sort of monster?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yea</br>  <br>Apparently even some off hand comment about a boyfriend or showing some faceless guy wearing a suit in one panel is now NTR</br>  KUROSAKI-KUN!!  <br>Nah, she preferred their cocks over her husbands by the end IIRC<br><br>Basically the definition of NTR</br></br></br>  <br>I'm no person to tell you what should you fap to, still, I find NTR boring and most of the artists either draw like shit or draw good female bodies in no exciting/erotic positions</br>  <br><br>Monster.</br></br>   Oku-san NTR   <br>Okusan is only good for NTR you blithering faggot.</br>  its easier to NTR okusan since you never actually see her husband  <br>They're all the same though, do you cucks really just like reading the same thing over and over?</br>  <br>I don't insert as the cuck, I just dislike happy couples. It doesn't get my dick as hard anymore.</br>  <br><br>Whatever rocks your cock bro. I like romance, hell even in a non-h manga or show when they do something cute and romantic my dick gets hard. It's a strange thing.</br></br>  <br>Romance a shit. Hetero NTR a best. Yuri a best.</br>  <br>I only tolerate NTR if the MC is an unlikable pussy faggot. So m, basically more often than not.</br>  <br><br>Get this cuckshit out of here.</br></br>  Will we ever see the opening chant/dance for a duel again? <br> Will they ever do it together again? </br>  Ruri is the most beautiful girl in the multiverse.  <br>If she doesn't turn up until the very end of the series, I'm going to be fucking mad</br>  <br>Sawatari tried to get one going, but shitty entertainer Yuya dragged down the tone</br>  <br>Hopefully she has a decent personality unlike Yuzu.</br>  <br>She is going to be pure and demure and devoid of any crudeness. And have whopping great tits.</br>  <br>Yuya confirmed for worst entertainer. Why haven't the Luddites converted to JACK yet?</br>  <br>How can you tell if someone does what they like solely for self satisfaction?</br>  I've done it gentlemen, I have saved the game.  <br>You forgot to put the Nekroz in</br>  <br>I think he just shit-talks everyone he beats. Kind of like how /dng/ says "git gud scrub" no matter how good their opponent's records and strategy are.<br>I should probably flush all the Crow out of my brain.</br></br>  <br>She will only have like 5 minutes of screen time, why do you want her to have a personality?</br>  <br>About that, what did he mean about Jack being a Traitor?</br>  <br>Damn Christ, Jackfags are just as annoying like Shunfags and Sawatarifags.</br>  <br> what did he mean about Jack being a Traitor? <br>Jack used to be Commons, and now performs for Tops in the tourney they made to pacify the commons</br></br>  <br>Patience my fellow Ruri enthusiast. Her time will come.</br>  <br> We like Shun because he's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything <br> We like Sawatari because he's shit but we like to joke about him anyway  <br> Jack is the best because he's the best fuck you <br>I don't understand</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ripped stockings <br>O-oh</br></br>  Sacred Warrior Black Luster Soldier. I guess Yugi wouldn't be Yugi if he didn't use it. It's his most powerful card bar his ace.  Ruri is going to be the evil Yuzu and she's going to break Shun's heart.  <br>I guess we find out soon, Anon.<br>Maybe the final of the first Friendship Cup was fixed or something, and Jack was selected to win because the Tops liked the look of him. Maybe there was some incident with him and Crow and the rest of not-Team Satisfaction. Or, maybe nothing happened and Crow is just pissy because he's in a shitty garage while Jack has 11/10's riding his  bike .</br></br>  <br> tfw I made it to Turn 28 against Burning Abyss and had all but the head <br><br>For a fucking shit deck that makes no sense, that was surprising, even against Burning Abyss.</br></br></br>  <br>In other words he's a fucking sell out. He became the Tops monkey that performs for them in order to keep his luxuries. All empty though as Jack is dead inside at this point.</br>  <br> and she's going to break Shun's heart. <br><br>She's going to reject him?</br></br></br>  <br>He'll be dead outside as well soon.</br>  <br><br> Shun rescues Ruri <br> As they're escaping Yuri appears <br> Shun gets OTK'd and right before he's carded he sees a grinning Yuri <br> Tells Ruri to run while holding his hand out like Teppei did before he was carded <br> His last moments are of Yuri thanking Ruri for leading him into a trap by telling him where the escape route was <br> Ruri cards Shun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then Shun was a Barian</br>  <br>Oh, I know exactly why I hate this boner.</br>  <br>Jack was a monkey in original 5D's. It was a plot point that he was allowed to live in New Domino City in exchange for Stardust Dragon. Goodwin hid the fact he was satellite scum from the public and he built up a name for himself as King with his Signer Dragon. Then there were probably a few fixed matches now and then to assure Jack's status via Dragan and the like. He was a false King.</br>  Episode 66: Opening Match!! Crow vs Gongenzaka<br>26th July 2015<br>Opening match of the Friendship Cup! Clash between Crow and Gongenzaka!!<br>The Friendship Cup finally begins. The opening match is a duel between Crow Hogan and Gongenzaka Noboru! The biggest duel festival of the City, filled with intense white-hot battles between duelists, starts here!<br><br>This week's Gongenzaka: Restoring the reputation of Yuya!!<br>Gongenzaka takes the first turn and goes all-out with his full power, trying his best to clear Yuya's negative reputation as the duelist who lost to Jack. On the other hand, Crow seems to be distracted by something among the audience, and could not focus on the duel...!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Atem IS Black Luster Soldier. It's arguably his most important card. It's weird that it doesn't get hyped as much as the Magician.</br>  <br>BARIAN<br>CHAOS<br>DRAW<br><br>THE EIGHTH ONE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because DM was all about friendship and shit and DM and DMG were his friends, like BEWD was Kaiba's orphaned witch waifu.</br>  <br>Crow's jobbing by being distracted?</br>  <br> Gongenzaka takes the first turn and goes all-out with his full power, trying his best to clear Yuya's negative reputation as the duelist who lost to Jack. On the other hand, Crow seems to be distracted by something among the audience, and could not focus on the duel...! <br>Crow confirmed for losing.</br></br>  <br> draw card <br> no targets <br> end turn </br></br></br>  <br> Gon beats Crow <br><br>I'd actually be pretty surprised honestly. I wonder what Crow is distracted by, I'd imagine either Jack Kinging it up or Dr. Fudo stroking his dick.</br></br></br>  <br> Restoring the reputation of Yuya!! <br> Another Gon duel thats MUH YUYA <br>I thought he was strong enough to stand on his own now?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You know it's a two parter, right?</br></br></br>  <br>This pretty much confirms that Gon will be in the lead at the start, which means Crow will be the one to pull a reversal</br>  <br>Also Reira and ENJOY confirmed for the Friendship cup</br>  <br><br>Odd, the last summary clearly mentioned that Gon is off to a bad start due to his first Riding Duel. And everybody was saying Crow's going to win.</br></br>  <br>Gon is the Yuzu of ARC-V</br>  <br> REIRA IS PART OF THE CUP </br>  <br>I know this though Anon. In both situations, Jack saw a way out of poverty and took it. Crow can bitch all he want about Jack being a traitor but in the end of the day, Jack isn't the one scavenging for food everyday to feed three hungary children in his care.</br>  <br> the last summary clearly mentioned that Gon is off to a bad start due to his first Riding Duel <br>I doubt that will last longer than 5 minutes, he'll probably stand upright on his bike to be steadfast even as he's moving or some other dumb shit.</br></br>  <br> Reira is gonna be on a D-Wheel <br><br>FUCKING HYPE</br></br></br>  <br>I know exactly why i got this boner</br>  <br>Off-screen :^)</br>  <br>Sure he isnt going to skateboard like the other 5Ds kids did?</br>  <br>He's going to get a D-Bicycle and he will like it</br>  <br>Jack could've at least secretly sent money or something to Crow and Yusei (if we count original 5D's plot) or something with his fame bux.<br> Jack isn't the one scavenging for food everyday to feed three hungary children in his care. <br>That's because Jack was an introvert and didn't really give a flying fuck about people's suffering other than his own. He had a real big problem with Yusei's bond shit and he wanted to focus on himself. He would probably leave the orphans to themselves if the roles were swapped with Crow.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit, Reiji will force him, it's an order.<br><br>Only one way to make him a man.<br><br>C/C/Cycle.<br><br>I hope Reira wins the Tournament and beats Jack instead of Yuya. I'm all in for Reira.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If D/D/D stands for Different Dimension Demon, what is C/C/C?</br>  <br>Crappy Copy Cats</br>  <br>Well C is Chaos, and CC that Reira uses has Persona Shutter cards for a Camera and Copying, so I'd imagine CCC is something like Chaotic Copying Camera, probably to do with him trying to copy and take 'pics' of Reiji's dueling.</br>  <br>Cinematic Copy Creatures, or some shit like that.</br>    Hey guys, I found all the Ruris  <br>I'm pretty sure Reiji telling Reira to pay attention during key duels in the Maiami Championship has something to do with him having an eidetic memory.</br>  <br>But Yusei and Crow didn't have contact with Jack three years. I mean yeah, he could have if he wanted but I doubt the money would get there because Godwin.</br>  <br>If Yuri carded Ruri a second time, Shun would transcend the immortal plane and duel him into literal oblivion.<br><br>In other words, Shun was a Barian</br></br></br>  <br>Post the effect.</br>   tfw Reiji, Serena, Shun, and Jack all battle Leo using the strongest shit they got <br> Super Poly, Accel Synchro, etc.  <br> tfw Leo rips them apart like it's nothing and it's up to Yuya to do it <br> Reiji never acquired Egyptian Barian Super Accel Pendulum Sway is that's why they all lost </br></br></br>  Who has the best duels on average in Arc-V? Shun's duels are fun, but he has a load of shit duels. Is there a character that hasn't had a single bad duel yet?  <br>Maybe Reiji?</br>  <br>Gon if you mean 1v1 only.</br>  <br>ENJOY<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QiW<wbr>7xNT3YVQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Reiji. Sawatari's are fun to watch just for the comedy.</br>  <br> Is there a character that hasn't had a single bad duel yet? <br>Reiji, even if Barret was meh. Sawatari if we dont count those shitty battle royale duels<br> First duel had KALEIDO MIRAGE <br> 2nd duel had Yuto hype back when Yuto wasnt a joke <br> 3rd duel had all dat entertainment </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Amazing duel vs Yaiba <br> Amazing duel vs Yuya <br> Amazing duel vs Evil Gon <br> Great duel vs Bennis <br><br>Huh. I think you might be right. Either him or Reiji then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuto was never really a joke. He ripped Standard apart, made Sora look like an absolute joke, and even with Yugo he had a fun duel, despite Yugo's deck countering his. <br><br>Yuto, Reiji, and Sawatari are the only good ones so far.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'd go with Gon. Reiji's duels are too few and far between.</br></br>  <br>Reiji can't duel as often because the writers are scared of his anime deck's power combos.</br>  <br> Reiji's duels are too few and far between <br>If we discount all the shitty tag duels, Gons only dueled once more than Reiji. And all of Gons are 1 episode duels, while 2 of Reijis are two parters</br></br>  <br>He had 2 godly 3 card combos, right?<br>Swiral+Night+Berfomet and Swiral+CEO+Abyss Ragnarok.<br><br>They're way too strong in animeland</br></br></br></br>  With all the hype of Yugo vs Yuya, what if Shun is the one who kills Yugo? All Yuya has to say is "He's the one who killed Yuto" and Shun will beat the banana shit out of Yugo.   Yugo jobs against filler <br> Yuzu encourages Yuya from the sidelines <br> Yuya's smile returns <br>All to be expected next time on Yugioh, Arc V</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not like he wanted to become an entertainer, to be fair he kinds of forces it down on himself.</br></br>  I want Jack to be crushed utterly.<br>I want him to be stained with humiliation<br><br>I want him to go on a quest for revenge for his dead wife killed by a man with a claw and his six robot piloting soldiers that include his former mentor, a guy with an Oedipus complex the size of the moon, two kids, a stripper and a shitty older brother</br></br></br>   Rank 4 Trap holes from deck <br>NONONONONONONONO</br>  <br>post the effect faggot, nobody cares about ruris.</br>  <br>Just once I'd like for then to make a really good R2. Or R9.

If you enjoy something the /a/ hive mind doesn't allow you to enjoy, you have "shit taste".<br><br>Personally I enjoyed AgK too, even though it's overal of pretty mediocre quality.

I was indifferent to her before. God damn, are you guys annoying.</br></br>  They rushed the anime original ending so fucking fast.

And kill this shit-tier thread already.</br>  <br>And you did besides the fact that manga Mine &gt; anime Mine.</br>  Did the manga die or what?  I maintain that if Asuka had been the protagonist of 3.33 and it didn't have such a meaninglessly long timeskip, it wouldn't have been that bad of a movie. I felt like a lot of characters were bogged down by 3.33 and while Shinji wasn't necessarily portrayed badly, I feel like all the extra bullshit in 3.33 probably ruined his psyche. It was too much.<br><br>Also my waifu's reputation was ruined, so there's that too.<br><br>Whatever. Let's have an Eva thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br> if Asuka had been the protagonist <br>That doesn't make sense.<br>Ultimately Evangelion is the story of Shinji growing up. As cruel as it sounds, Asuka is just a vehicle for him. Somebody to provide him with sexual tension, somebody to talk down on him, somebody to look up to and somebody to fear. Possibly also somebody to fall in love with.<br>But you cannot turn the attention away from Shinji.</br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Asuka.  <br>Well maybe you should.</br>  <br> I <br>Good to know there isn't a whole organization that thinks this way I guess.</br></br>  <br> my waifu´s reputation was ruined <br>Well, everybodys reputation was ruined.<br><br><br>This.<br><br><br>Nice trips Moot.<br><br><br>Am I the only one who thinks the plug suit she´s wearing in OPs picture looks like shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it looks pretty cute</br>  <br>Hopefully 3.0+1.0 delivers.</br>   it wouldn't have been that bad of a movie <br>heh</br>  <br>What a pointless post.</br>  Only delusional idiots are holding any hope whatsoever for 4.4. 3.3 ruined things worse than the prequels killed Star Wars (not financially, of course).<br>There is nothing left to hope for.</br>  <br>Good music,<br>Good animation,<br>Shinji masturbating,</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty sad that the potential for watching a 14yo boy jerk off is the closest thing you have to a valid expectation.</br>  3 wasn't very good , but it wasn't the blatant insult that 2 was.  <br>Please explain where 2 was worse than 3.</br>  <br><br>Asuka does not even need screentime to be the protagonist of 3.33<br><br>appear right on time to deal with shit while everyone else (Shinji) act like complete retards and fuck shit up big time (Shinji)</br></br></br></br>  NGE was godlike<br>EoE was good<br>1.11 was quite good<br>2.22 was okay<br>3.33 was meh<br>I see where this is going</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> NGE was godlike <br> EoE was perfection </br></br>  <br>Move everything down a few degrees and you're correct.

Even Anno is on the field commenting on Asuka's newfound popularity.<br><br>Because of that I dare say Asuka was actually part of the problem less than Shinji. Shinji gets introduced as-is since he was in a coma, and while his character is poor compared to previous Rebuilds and NGE he's not the biggest change here.<br><br>Everything else is. Take Asuka, she was introduced as a mercenery/warrior princess type with more action scenes than she has dialogue or development (and NO introspection! In EVA!).<br><br>The answer is actually less Asuka if you want to improve 3.0.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tang</br>  <br> you will never suck tang from Rei's massive tits </br>  <br>more than Shinji*</br>  <br> you will never suck cum from Asuka's massive cock </br>  <br>Is that a penis</br>  2.22 was worse than 3.33.  http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94141<br><br>First part of 219 spoilers.<br><br>Full chapter is 65 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chapter 220 announced to be in October</br></br>  <br><br>get out</br></br>  <br>It is the "real thing", only digital.

It's also possible they are adding content to the episode now that they have more time and it's still in an unfinished state.</br>    I wonder why I didn't fucking watch this last season. No fucking wonder so many goddamn people said it had the best OST of the season. <br><br>The show so far has been really good. I fear that this show gets way too popular (since it is getting dubbed and whatnot), and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. And don't you fucking deny it. When the show aired the threads were full of fags extolling the show, and once it got ridiculously popular /a/ hated it because "muh newfags."</br></br>   this OST <br>It's tracks like "Call You Later" that make my day a little brighter.</br>  Hopefully the OST will keep me alive until ep 12 finally airs  Back to Back Raw<br><br>http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94140<br><br>Half Life 3 Confirmed To Be Skipped</br></br></br></br>   Call You Later    Sidewinder   <br> and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. <br>Too late. /a/ is calling it fujoshit now.</br></br>  <br>What show doesn't /a/ call fujoshit?</br>  <br>Moeshit?</br>  <br>Whoa, thanks anon. Wasn't expecting it this early.</br>  Illustration from the new chapter. I won't have time to actually sit down and read it until later but just from skimming through the pictures, it looks like  Zapp throws a suitcase with the president's head into Leo's apartment?  It was also surprisingly short for a quarterly chapter. It's like half as long as his old quarterly chapters, not sure what's up with that.  It's already out? Damn, thanks for the reminder anon.<br><br>Too bad we lost all the hype on here. Can't reallt blame /a/ though, especially after this cock-tease ep 11 ending.<br>Oh well, at least the ost will help me suffer through those days/weeks/ m-months? ;_;  <br><br><br>"It's magic" is just too good. 2groovy4me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Potus   got decaptated, now it's up to  LEO  to put him back together </br>  So if I wanted to start reading Back 2 Back, could I just read volume 10 or are any of the episodic chapters in 2-9 important other than what the anime covered?  <br>Plotwise, no, not really.<br><br>You'd be missing a hell of character building though.</br></br></br>  <br> In The City <br> It's Magic <br> Hands On <br> Starbow <br> Early Train <br><br>I was sure as fuck waiting for this day to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I'd definitely go back and read them, it's just way too text-heavy to get through all ten volumes when B2B raws are staring me in the face. Figured I'd just read 10 now so I don't need to worry about spoilers.</br>   Call you later <br> It's magic <br> Catch me if you can <br>Fuck, I actually feel bad for torrenting it right now, shit's just way too good.<br><br> S2 never </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please let this lead to a Futurama-like development with talking heads in fishtanks.</br>  <br>Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing!</br>  <br>There's a new character introduced in volume 8 and it also shows a little bit of what happened in New York from 3 years ago, and in volume 7 it brings up the fact that  Leo's eyes start to steam/burn when he over-uses them  although that's not super important so much as it probably looks confusing if you don't know about it. You won't miss anything really big, but bits and pieces of the world get filled out gradually, like showing you KK's family or Chain's werewolf gang. It's probably fine as long as you go back and read it later though. Volume 10 is probably the most important for having the biggest character-focused arc and filling in some of the details about the god eyes.</br>   10. Attack The System   07. Call You Later  <br> a new character introduced in volume 8 <br>Who? Doctor?</br></br>  Retard post here, where's the ED song?   On My Own <br><br><br><br>It's on Nyaa.</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the most came early.  <br> Why is this thread so empty. <br>It is a thread about poor quality anime.</br></br>  <br>It's a thread about a god tier soundtrack unlike hibishit.</br>  Final episode fucking when though  <br>Yes.<br><br>I was thinking that the whole time.  Sometimes I wonder if the author ever watched that show what with the alien New York setting and Zapp being almost exactly Bender. </br></br></br>  If the last episode sucks at least we have this good soundtrack. I might want to buy a physical copy.   ost sounds exactly like the stuff Sawano used to do back when Sawano was good    At The Gates <br><br>Oh wow I just got Heat Guy J flashbacks.</br></br>  LIFE IS WORTH LIVING AGAIN  This will be the perfect thing to listen to while I finish reading Trigun.  <br>Decide on one thing already, you bue faggot.</br>  <br><br>Can't read moon but it seems   Leo's task is to bring the president's head to the hospital to have it stitched back to his body while dodging crazy asshole trying to stop him  Looks bombastic but I agree with anon above it's quite short.</br></br>  Is Taisei Iwasaki the new Yoko Kanno?  <br>Nightow was having too much fun watching Matsumoto's anime to draw more.</br>  <br>He doesn't plagiarize his shit does he?</br>  <br>Depends on how many people he's sampling from.</br>  OST of the fucking year.<br>It would take something elder god tier to even go against this.</br>  <br>He sure is impressively diverse, and the special made it sound like he really thinks about the show when he's composing music for it. I'm eager to hunt down some of his other soundtracks now.</br>  What are the chances of anyone translating the first Back2Back chapter?   Starbow <br>Beautiful. I'd love to hear an extended version of this layered with field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning.</br>   On my own <br><br>Yes, the feels are still overwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  To be honest, my hype for the eventual finale was waning, but now I'll never be not hype. I'm only on track 9, but everything is so fucking good.<br><br>Thank you based Iwaski. I knew you would deliver.</br></br>   tfw no sonic in the new chapter <br>I wonder if the anime designs influenced him at all or if it's just the quarterly schedule, but the characters look very slightly different somehow. Leo's hair looks a little fluffier for one thing, and did Zed get a new outfit?<br><br><br>I guess he was busy with the promotional stuff like the mini-chapters and the light novel illustrations and the blu-ray covers. Hopefully the next chapter is a little longer.<br><br>Likely, since multiple moon-readers post in the threads. I'm not good enough to translate the whole thing but I got the general gist and could maybe do a loose summary tomorrow if no one else has stepped up by then. But I would definitely appreciate dialogue translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very good actually; I'm doing it right now. <br>Don't expect a full draft until I finish my volume 10 corrections, but I don't expect those will take more than another day or two.<br><br><br>This is a brilliant idea and if there are any soundmixer anons in this thread I will personally translate a doujinshi of your choice if you make a track like this and post it here.</br></br></br></br></br>  My guess for the short chapter is so it'll fit in the next volume. We've already got three extra chapters from WSJ and SJ, plus that short one from SQ.19 an anon translated. This plus the next chapter should just be enough to make volume 11 (or 1 if he restarts under the new name).    <br> did Zed get a new outfit? <br><br>He definitely did. He has sleeves now, and it looks like there's a cutout in the back of his shirt too.</br></br></br>   the entirety of Disc 2 <br><br>Holy FUCK.<br>This is so good, I love literally every track.<br><br>Also, there is some stuff that I have never heard before that sounds really great. Is it possible they just never included it or is the finale going to be extremely good?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, next chapter in October and volume 11 by Christmas? Sounds like a plan.</br>  <br>I could do it myself but I have no field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning and I'd only be able to loop parts of the song to extend it.</br>   footloose   <br>Zed's gone FULL NIGHTOW. <br><br> i'm going to lick that back cutout </br></br></br>  CRUIIISIIIING  <br>Zed O'Brien a slut now<br><br>A manslut<br><br>Huge manfishslut</br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later <br>WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT AWESOME BASS INTRO</br>   A Way Out <br><br>GOTTA FIND A NEW ATTITUDE<br>IF YOU WANNA <br>GET OUT<br><br>This shit is funky as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later   <br>This song is fucking amazing but... what episode is it even in?</br>  Last Kekpisode when?  <br>May as well make it a fucking movie at this point.</br>   United   <br>Well I think they aren't airing it on TV because it is going to be much longer than a normal episode.<br><br>So, extended OVA type thing?</br></br></br>  <br>When the OST tops the Oricon Charts.</br>   amazing soundtrack <br> show barely uses it <br>Every fucking time.

Didn't see that coming.<br><br><br>We discussed this just here </br></br></br></br>  So I definitely wasn't expecting the chapter to get leaked so soon but it's a little late for me to start a dump. I could either dump chapter 4 tomorrow, or I could dump it together with chapter 5 on Friday or Saturday like I originally intended.<br>I might also try to typeset the new chapter once I'm done with 4 and 5, assuming there is a translation by then.

It's definitely possible.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon! it's nice to see the manga worked on since the anime would be ending soon, whenever episode 12 airs.<br><br>On a side note, i'm so glad we have so much content today with the OST and the B2B chapter</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like he's missing at least one.

This entire OST, man.<br><br>I'd have trouble saying where most of this stuff was used because I'm usually focused more on the visuals, but goddamn.</br></br>  Does anyone know what song it was during Episode 5 while Aligura was flying through the air after getting punched?

There's some changes here and there to better fit the format but its overall well done but the last episode has been delayed so you may want to wait a while before making the jump.</br>  <br>1 day after your dead.</br>    Can someone make lyrics for the songs?

Hopefully the soundtrack will ease the pain I been feeling every week knowing that the last episode isn't even out yet.<br><br>For fuck sake, I wish it would have ended on an arc straight out of the manga so I wouldn't be left wondering instead of having the twins being too damn integral to the plot.</br></br>  <br><br>Hibike.</br></br>   moe <br> best of any season ever </br>  <br><br>Did you actually watch the show or do you just like throwing around words like a retard?</br></br>  <br>dropped after 3 episodes</br>  <br>After the finale airs</br>  <br>Like a bitch in heat</br>  <br>Klaus and Zed<br><br><br>sarufag, your sarus bring a smile every time i see them. never stop saruing.</br></br></br></br>  will they be daijoubu?  <br>White is already dead</br>  <br> 21K <br> 9K </br></br>  <br>Everything will be  die joubu.</br>  So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women for cheap sexual thrills the entire time, right? <br><br>Or does it actually develop a plot and get better?</br></br>  <br>Yes. <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry OP, it's not purely S&amp;M faggotry.</br>  <br>I have to agree with </br>  Bros doing bro things<br><br> This scene animated <br><br>Main reason I want to watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Picked the fuck up.</br>  Prison School is honestly AotS.

Didn't even crack a smile during the entirety of the first episode. <br>Did you actually try reading the guy's post who you replied to? He said that he didn't find the beginning funny either.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he meant gorge as in feast. Like you eat so much your eyes pop out of your head.</br>   prison school <br> AOTS <br> even AOTS material </br></br>  As usual advice, if u want to enjoy the shit out of this manga, turn off your logical thinking part because it will never make any sense at all and they not gonna get any better at all up to now.<br>Second, embrace your M-side and forcefully held on it cuz if you're not there's a lot of blue deep ball waitin for ya.<br>You past those two, then you'll realize how glorious and masterpiece this piece of crap really was 9/10 topkek.</br></br>  <br>all of you fucking sub humans must realise that you must READ THE MANGA to start dreaming about thinking about becoming humans<br><br><br>also you must be a true assman</br></br></br></br>  Just looked like tumblrs wet dream, dropped so quick  It's for comedic thrills  R E A D T H E M A N G A<br>E<br>A<br>D<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>M<br>A<br>N<br>G<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's a lot of masochistic stuff, but rather than anything fetishistic I just find it hilarious. And there'll be more of a plot to it than just twelve episodes of ecchi Auschwitz.  <br> So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women for cheap sexual thrills the entire time, right?  <br> Or does it actually develop a plot and get better? <br>the manga is some of the greatest comedy literature to come out of japan EVER. and Hana is a best.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope. It is about the friendship of the 5 boys and their various hardships and trials against the underground student council.</br>  <br> So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women <br>Oh shit, my ultimate fetish. You just convinced me to read this.</br></br>  <br>McNig you gotta tone it down on the masochism man,   just kidding I would give my left nut to be one of the five male students. </br>  <br> tfw you will never be tied up, beaten and beheaded by pic related </br>  <br>Censored garbage<br>its great for a harem though</br></br>  <br> Censored garbage <br>as opposed to Prison School? More shafts of light! MOAR</br></br>  <br>This</br>  It's a comedy with cheap sexual thrills.<br><br>What "plot" are you actually looking for? I mean they already said they're desperate for girls since they turned to co-ed.</br></br>  <br>As long as nipples exist, I don't care.</br>  So how are the estimates ? Is it flopping because of the changes?  <br>Nipples?</br>    <br>If only she wasn't a slob</br>  <br>Probably terribly because of this garbage adaptation.</br>  <br>if you didn't laugh you should stop watching<br><br>I laughed, so I'll keep watching<br><br>simple really</br></br></br></br></br>   All the main girls somehow are martial art monsters <br> Dumbass plot and characters <br> excessive violence toward boys. <br>Usually all of those point is red flag for me but somehow i just cant help myself.The only thing that made me keep going is somehow the boys are self aware of their own masochism so its funny i guess. Also the bromance and comedy here are painfully gold.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>blah blah buy the BDs blah</br>  <br>It's a comedy. Why are you asking for some complex plot?<br><br>Well, the status quo changes quite a bit, so you have that to look forward to.</br></br></br>  <br> beheaded <br> not wanting Valmet to break your neck first </br></br>  <br>   They get girlfriends. </br>  <br>Its a comedy anime.<br>The things they do is ridiculous,the reasons why they do it is ridiculous,the whole setting of the anime is ridiculous.But its funny as hell.<br>So don't try to find some reason or logic for every fucking thing,its a anime.Just watch it.</br></br></br>  <br> don't have time to read manga <br> have time to watch anime <br> despite the fact that reading manga is overall faster because of lack of animation and because the characters talk as fast as you can read <br><br>You're not the brightest in your family, are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since when "tbh" is considered cancerous, what the fuck. It's the same as "mfw" and "tfw", it has always been here.<br><br><br>In other news, manga &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime because QUALITY. Also Hana a best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuuuck.<br>One thing's for sure,<br>my dick will still be hard long after I'm dead.</br></br></br>  <br> AotS <br>Wait.... an Attack of the Show anime? Odd, but I'm sold.</br></br>  <br>Plot? Nigger this manga has the best fucking plot you'll ever see  Ifyouknowwhatimsayin' </br>  A year ago, I sae a post recomending it but I didnt find it interesting at plain sight. (Didnt read the manga by that time).<br><br>This year the anime comes out and its all censored. <br><br>  Had a few laughs (dunno if the studio is doing a shit job adapting the manga). <br>  I dont like so much S&amp;M  <br>  The design and drawing style are not that good IMO <br>  The guy with the small face... just WTF <br><br><br>Still many of them recommend it with all their soul. Stopped reading manga when the blond guy betray the group.<br><br>Will it get better? Should I give it another chance?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eventually it panders to scat fetishists.</br></br>  <br>Not that guy but although I do agree with the manga part<br>  it has always been here. <br>is not true. tbh hasn't always been used and it actually only in the past month/couple of months started being used together with "smh" and "bae" mostly in ironic shitposting. <br><br>mfw and tfw are a bit older, but if you were here you would remember that they were also met with hostility when people first started using them. (Funny enough they also started being used as ironic shitposting but I guess they just caught on eventually)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Note: I'm talking purely about the shortened versions "&gt;tfw nogf" that started out as ironic shitposting, not "my face when" as a whole.</br>  <br>I suggest finishing Boys' Prison arc and then deciding, if those bro moments and lewd comedy were keeping you entertained. If not, drop it.<br><br>I began reading this as an S&amp;M enthusiast, but stayed for laughs and manly friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Rest in peace G4.<br>Wonder what Olivia and Kevin are up to now</br></br>  <br><br><br>Kevin is doing the same thing, just online.<br>twitch dot tv slash theattack<br><br>I know he also hosted the Nintendo World Championship at e3.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Really hoping they compile the chairman's ass adventures into an OVA  <br>Olivia is going to be Psylock in X-Men Apocalypse<br><br>She sucks cocks in her free time</br></br></br>  <br> sucks cocks in her free time <br>was there ever a time when she didn't?</br></br>  <br> being this retard <br><br>READ THE FUCKING MANGA<br><br>MANGA<br><br>M<br><br>A<br><br>N<br><br>G<br><br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's a fucking comedy.

By no means is "tbh" an innocent abbreviation.</br>  <br>The best part is when the main character watches that one woman piss on the grass.</br>  I'll probably get shit on and have my taste question but I honestly find the anime more humorous than the manga. It just feels like the message is delivered better with motion than still images.  <br> a true assman </br>  <br>pz nigga, /sp/ isn't important enough to have memes<br><br>much less cross board butthurt</br></br></br>  <br>das a doujin... right?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>sadpanda.org/g/785065/8a872340da/</br></br>  <br>ushio to tora<br>monsume<br>charlotte<br>gangsta<br><br>'sabout it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> monsume <br> any relevance at all </br></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>Jitsuwa<br>GATE</br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa <br> aots </br></br>  <br>We can all agree that Game of Laplace is aots.</br>  <br>Literally everything, because Prison School sucks so much.</br>  You must be gay or a moeshiteater if you dislike Prison School.<br><br>Its really about a bunch of friends having fun at school</br></br>  <br>I can see animeonlyfags disliking it. First Ep was shit.</br>  Have you praised for PBR-sama today, /a/?  Enjoy it in its true glory, manga. Also, Hana belongs with Kiyoshi. Chiyo can gtfo.  <br> Little does gakuto know there was a dick in that thing minutes ago </br>  <br>Some scenes were funnier in anime form, honestly.</br>  <br>Slut Chiyo &gt; Hana</br>  Sounds like fun-hilarious kind of trash, I should pick it up.  <br>Slut chiyo was probably one of the worst mini arcs in the manga and made me dislike her character. Maris naivety made that shit tolerable.</br>  <br>Anime form: funnier in some scenes but less intense scenes<br>Manga form: still the best</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116435 <br>Nice job shingo.</br>  Fuck off secondary retards.  <br>At this point why would you run to read the source just so you can experience redundancy with the anime? May as well enjoy being surprised while it lasts.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116435 <br>Did you have a bottle? This an important question.<br><br>You must have made a mistake along the way.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116435 <br>Doesnt work unless the girl is extremely into you.</br>  <br>can you imagine how stupid that conversation might be<br> so hey, do you love me <br> yea i do <br> like really, really love me <br> you want to do anal, right <br> no, not anal, i dont wanna do anal, unless you wanna do it, then i wanna do it <br> if its not anal then what is it <br> ok, right, heres the thing, have you ever heard of golden shower </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can slut chiyo arc be bad? it developed characters and showed sides of them we haven't seen before, what was your issue with it?</br>  <br>Slut chiyo was fine but she did her makeup with a sharpie. tbh, wished she stayed with the twin tail look.</br>  <br>Precisely because it developed characters in a good way except chiyo. Here we see her delve into madness because she has extreme trust issues and always draws her own conclusions without looking at the whole picture. At first you think oh this could be it, some development between her and MC, NOPE. She is instead immensely more concerned with her sisters honor and reputation than anything. Her and MC developed more as friends than anything and that is disappointing with the way the MC idealizes her so much.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116435 <br>the trick is you need to find a girl that's more fucked up in the head than you</br>  <br>Wait.<br>You don't like slut arc, even though it has development just because it's not the development you wanted?<br>Good way =/= what you wanted. Chiyo was shown to not be the angel kiyoshi imagines, she has trust issues, overreacts, etc. Kiyoshi was also developed to be more than just a pervert, since he didn't fuck her when he could. You can even say it was hinted that chiyo might like kiyoshi, even if the focus of slut arc was her deal with mari. Also, mari's hypocrisy was further stressed. It had interesting development, just not the one you wanted.</br></br></br>  What is it about midweek threads that turns them into a hotbed of cancer shitposting compared to the weekend ones?

I believe the MC did have sex eventually but i dropped it before.</br>  <br>I think this is a great bait.</br>  <br>Finally some good taste in these threads</br>  <br>Why did you go through all the trouble of typing and posting that if you have absolutely no idea of what you're talking about?</br>  I almost masturbated to Kiyoshi last chapter  Andou's face just gets smaller and smaller.  <br> I believe the MC did have sex eventually </br>  <br>Why'd you stop?</br>  <br>What is with his mongoloid character design?</br>  <br>Because I realized it was him and not one of the girls</br>  <br>I already fapped to Kiyoshi, get on my level.</br>  <br>And the problem is?</br>  <br>Congrats on being a fag<br><br>I'm not a fag</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares as long as it's 2D? It's like saying fapping to loli makes you a pedophile in real life.</br>  <br>I was actually impressed, I didn't think Hana had that nice of an ass.<br><br>I was then sad<br>;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pee</br>  <br> I'm not a fag <br>First: Why would you care if you dick gets hard anyway? Just fapp to it.<br>Second: I'm not gay either but Kiyoshi is still hot as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Any characterization he had was better than AM AN ANGRY BLACK MAN of a protagonist from Prototype 2.</br>  <br>You can literally see the testicles</br>  <br>Hey, considering the roast beef on Meiko, it wouldn't be that unlikely that it was actually a vagina.<br><br>It wasn't, though. ;_;</br></br></br>  <br> roast beef <br>but there have been shots of her thong digging into her pussy. if she had a roastie it would have been hanging out the sides.</br></br>  <br> roast beef <br>No. That was her vulva you fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>This is some quality debate right here</br>  <br>I think it has the most development ever seen in ecchi manga. It's damn fucking good. Go read it, seriously.</br>  <br>I'm sorry that I wasn't using the correct technical term when describing a vagina.<br>I'll make sure to study and be able to please you, anon.<br><br>It's still puffy, regardless my point stands.</br></br></br></br>  I was good with the entire thing till the piss stuff started<br><br>goddamn that fetish ruins anything its in</br></br>  <br>Keep reading. It's bad, but I think it shows extreme sexual frustration.<br><br>The last like, ten chapters pretty much resolve everything regarding pee, so you're good.</br></br></br>  <br> not being a master of female anatomy after all the years of fapping to ero manga <br>Come on, man.<br><br><br>I normally hate piss but it didn't ruin the manga for me because it was so over the top and ridiculous. But if a girl just pisses herself while getting fucked because she has bladder problems, then nope.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting to see how the Gakkou Gurashi anime turns out before making any nominations.</br>  <br>To be fair, I actually dislike most Ecchi / H shit, but this is a big exception.<br>The plot is pretty fucking good.</br></br>  Prison school is enjoyable  So did the anime get uncensored on that other channel?  <br>Doesnt really bother me because theres more to it than that.</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>Very good.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking why<br><br>Oh well</br></br></br>  <br>The reason I like it is because it reminds me of some of my friends and its not a bad manga/show its better than some of the anime airing atm and also its something fresh instead of watching an anime about super powers</br>  <br>Just wait a few months, it'll eventually be released.<br><br>You won't be let down.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, I was just hoping I could see that delicious ecchi early. I'm still going to watch it as it releases though</br>  <br>read it first</br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br>"Now I've lost it, I know I can kill"</br>  What type of a face is this?  A moist one.  <br>A fuckable one.</br>  The pleasure of being cummed inside  <br> The pleasure of being boned inside <br><br>Fixed that for you</br></br></br>  It's the face you make when you realize you're in AOTS.    <br>maybe</br>  <br>Where the skull pepe pic?</br>  Face of best girl.  <br>A new challenger eh?</br>    The face of wild and dirty sex.     mfw Momonga picks a waifu <br> Not just impregnating all of them (including the elf twins (including the trap)) <br> Not just picking an heir based on which child is the most worthy </br></br>  <br>He can even impregnate women? Phisically I mean, I guess he could impregnate them with some magic bullshit but could he impregnate them naturally? <br><br>He doesn't have a dick, right?</br></br></br>  I want to believe that's what happens when you change a description of a character from a bitchslut to loves Momonga-sama.  <br>By getting a "boner"<br>Clackclackclack</br></br>  <br>Her throat looks like a smug fat man with a weird mustache</br>  Mine after being tenderly tickled by a huge dildo.  <br>Is she a bloodmage?</br>  <br>made my day.</br>  <br>YOU THINK THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE NIGGER?</br>  <br>I think technically she's a semen demon</br>  <br>You mean like the Prime Minister from Akame ga Kill?</br>  <br>No bones about it!</br>    how do they make a babies if skeleton doesn't have a penis bone?  <br>There's a cash shop item for that.</br>  <br>I was wondering about that the whole time—can a lich even have children?</br>  <br>he could just slaughter/revive an orphanage</br>  <br>Being able to wield powerful magic, I'm sure there's a way.</br>  <br> *rattle*rattle* </br>    This thread  <br>Well that's creepy.<br><br><br>And you sir owe me new sides.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the pleasure of being cummed inside.jpg </br>  Everyone is always questioning weather he can bone her or not.<br><br>I'm more interested in what their offspring would look like.</br></br>  <br>Never thought someone could top Smugfu reaction faces so quickly</br>  <br>A nothing happened in two weeks instead we got awful and diluted shenanigans face</br>  <br><br>I wonder what would have happened if he had not modified her character.<br><br>I bet her character description has tons of mention of her bitchiness that is now conflicting with her being in love with Momongo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The face belonging to the most pure of loves.</br>  She's so hot and devoted but also damn troublesome to deal with    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128117233 <br> Ore no wife. <br>Off yourself.</br></br>    <br>This.
