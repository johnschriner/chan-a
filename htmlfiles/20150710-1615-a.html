Now I have no idea how their quest is supposed to tie with Strawhats, Shanks seems so far away from everything that is happening.<br><br>Speaking of Yonkos, I'm surprised Kuzan is with the Blackbeards, although I'm not certain if he is part of the crew or just has agreements with them.

The entire plan was to provoke Kaidou to take down Doflamingo, not attack him, right?</br></br>  <br>Legbeards aren't girls.</br>  <br>is that your definition of fun?</br>  <br>The shounen genre is actually quite popular among us. Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. There's something for everyone. <br><br>Kizaru a piece of shit. I've never understood why people like him.</br></br></br>  <br>SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies so they fled with their tumblr fanfics to One Piece.</br>  <br>trap, trans, fag you guys don't know what to call yourselves anymore but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies</br>  <br>Law.

It has tentacles, and those tentacles are so huge, its sucktion cups were what we saw sucking Capone's ship up in the air. Capone is now working for Kaido and his job is to capture Caesar so that Kaido can keep getting those SMILEs. That creature is bigger than Kraken so it might be even different species. Rogue Sea king, artificial creature or other mythical beast maybe?</br></br>  <br> Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. <br>So then the same reason the rest of /a/ watches PreCure.</br></br>  <br>Hey, don't talk shit about my legs, they're always smooth as fuck.</br>  <br>People like him because he's a piece of shit that looks like he stars in JAVs in his spare time.</br>  <br>How can he just quit when he was drafted?</br>  <br> SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies <br>How so?</br></br>  <br>It did ? How ?<br>Hell I remember last month chapter included ErwinLevi fujobait.</br></br>  <br>Capone is working for Big Mom.</br>  I am so fucking hyped for Vegapunk.  <br> but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies <br>And yet some guys wonder why they can't ever put their dick in anything but a hoover and their dog's anus.</br></br>  <br>By mutiny.<br><br>Like he just did this chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but I can</br>  Will Green Bull also be a huge moralfag? Maybe Akainu should do a psychology test instead of hiring them for their height and fighting power.  <br>At least we still have a dick.</br>  <br><br> can't deal with any marines at all until he catches lawhat <br> never chases them <br> never has to do marine stuff ever again, can't be redrafted or forgiven </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is by far the best Law pic out there.</br>  <br>Oda copped out on Smoker.<br><br>Smoker didn't even get any new stitches on his face despite Dofla just making new and new bloody scars all over his face.<br><br>It's bullshit when he gets bandages on his body instead when Dofla attacked his face more than his body.<br><br>Guess Oda can't have a disfigured Smoker in his kiddy manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When Freud said girls wanted a dick, he was referring to the priviledge that goes with it. Not the actual thing.<br>Also technically they do have one. It's called a clit.</br></br>  <br>Dressrosa happened. Law became pseudo-main character. Doffy was shown to have a soft side for his family. Caring-dad figure, decent looking character that wears makeup. Trap-boy that likes wearing high-heels. There are three points in one piece that had a sudden influx of new readers. Enies Lobby, Marine Ford, and now Dressrosa. This influx is the era of fujos.</br>  <br>No it's not.</br>  This damn chapter hyped me too much, I ended up dreaming about it. I was desperately trying to call the Heart Pirates to say "To Dressrosa! Your captain is in danger!" because I thought they had a submarine and I can't remember if I was even able to call them. I was using something weird to contact them, not a regular phone, but not a den den mushi either. I don't know. What the fuck  <br>I don't care about Smoker I only care about Vegapunk.</br>  Shit more happened or was revealed in this chapter than in the last 50 on dressrosa<br>Shanks is gonna get BTFO by Kid and company but never shown until one chapter hundred weeks from now like BB Vs. Ace was so it'll be short and sweet (i really hope they speed up the road to raftel by doing this)<br>It's shown that Doffy was practically the Fifth Emperor in term of connections and power<br>Luffy is gonna have another pirate gang hot on his trail right after this arc<br><br>Did I miss anything?<br><br>Man I love the sea politics chapter way more than the fightan, but I am still hype for what's next</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that memebase and 9gag love shanks<br><br>Memebase and 9gag epic BTFO</br></br>    <br>look at the bonsai trees you idiot, this is probably Wano and the outline is a japanese styled building</br>  <br> because I thought they had a submarine <br>But they do have a submarine.</br></br>    <br>I didn't like Kizaru either at first but his jokey kind of attitude grew on me over time</br>  Kaido will be Godzilla Zoan.<br>Luffy will fights Kaido while riding on T-rex Drake, like Blue in Jurrasic World.</br>  <br>Oh please it's just a giant horned shadow. Building, demonic Totoro or giant den den mushi, we have no way of knowing what it is for sure.</br>  Which is more satisfying. This punch, or Bellamy's?  <br>I really don't like Luffy, for some reason. Never have. Didn't like either punch. <br><br>Most satisfying was him punching Wapol.</br></br></br>  <br> An entire arc taking place in Vegapunk's old laboratory <br> Learn nothing about him the whole time <br><br>I don't even dislike Punk Hazard, but this still pisses me off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This one.<br>I thought Bellamy's was cool, but since I felt more pity than anger toward Bellamy, I didn't really feel any satisfaction.</br></br>   tfw when got bored halfway through fishman island and haven't been back to OP since   <br>That's not just his best punch, that's the best moment in the whole series.</br>  <br>This meme just doesn't work with Shirahoshi as the MC.</br>  <br>This one. Bellamy's was satisfying at the time but he grew out of being a douchebag  and is a cute now </br>  <br>This. It shows Luffy's bravery and how he would rather die than be subjugated by some fat coward who hides behind his title</br>  <br>literally the GOAT moment in One Piece. I really felt the old vibes that the old manga had where Luffy would just punch anyone that pissed him off and punch them hard.<br><br>Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action.<br><br> tfw he punched the shit out of helmeppo those first few chapters </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the top right panel next to Drake's face. It is meant to show location, yet it looks like an exact fragment of the bottom panel.<br> in case this needs to be spelled out: that's just the scenery and not the silhouette (unfortunately). </br></br>  <br>What if they tortured him instead, though? I bet the Celestial Dragons have some really nefarious torture methods, since they've been running the world and quashing dissent for ages. We saw that torture exists in OP with Smoker's regiment.<br><br>It'd be interesting to see how Luffy'd react to Chinese water torture or hot pokers.</br></br></br>  <br>Seconds later, Luffy tearfully begs Kuma to stop raping his crew.</br>  <br> Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action <br>What ? What manga have you been reading ?<br>He just didn't meet any weak entitled idiot stupid enoug to challenge him since then.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, you might be onto something.</br>  <br>I don't think its bravery when your entire life is defined by taking down oppressive authorities. The list of people Luffy wouldn't punch if they ticked him off is probably empty.<br><br>Also, this chapters name was The Tiger And Dog. Fujitora is the tiger, was Moltres the dog(of the government)?</br></br></br>  <br>Akainu means "red dog"</br>  <br>i miss vander deckan...</br>  <br> was Moltres the dog(of the government)? <br><br>wtf are you talking about</br></br></br>  <br> Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action. <br>When has that ever happened recently?</br></br>  <br><br>He isn't dead, but we probably won't hear from him again soon, no hazuda.</br></br>  <br>I most certainly am. I initially didn't want to give in to those retarded people saying that that was a building, while I was convinced that the shitty shadow was indeed Kaido. Then I saw panel and realized I was the one being retarded &gt;(and half of 4chimp).</br>  <br>I meant they had a submarine, which is a much better means of escaping than the Thousand Sunny. Sorry if that wasn't clear.</br>  Pretty shitty chapter. Too many worthless nobodies taking up panels.  <br><br>don't even remember who that guy is. Fuck that arc.</br></br>  <br>How did Law get a submarine anyway?</br>  <br>It's more hype than anything.<br><br>Luffy and Drake/Kaidou showdown coming soon to Wano.<br>Luffy will probably get stomped and humiliated then have a rematch years later on a different Kaidou island.</br></br></br></br>  <br>autism the post</br>  <br> &gt;It's somekind of huge creature working for Kaido <br> &gt; Hundred beat kaido <br>make sense. . kinda..</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about shipping. I do care about the science of having sex with Alvida and Kalipha though. <br><br><br>Alvida isn't frictionless. Otherwise she wouldn't be able to wear shoes or the likes. They would just come off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>just ignore the bait, he wants you to post</br>  <br>We did learn that Caesar worked with him and that he doesn't seem to be inherently evil like caesar is. He does seem to have some bit of morals about his experiments.</br>  I'm confused. Are the Gorousei on the top of the World Government or not? Are the Tenryuubito just a completely independent existence that they allow to cause trouble and fuck shit up?  <br>This is the first time I've seen one of you anons admit you were wrong. Especially before the most obvious thing was revealed. Can't believe how many people think some shitty shadow is a kaidou reveal. Most obvious tactic ever</br>  Reminder that Rosinante got himself killed because of his over obsession with a D.<br><br>you can't run away from it</br></br>  <br>Excuse me for wanting the plot to develop rather than seeing a bunch of random faggots like Capone and Urouge repeat for the millionth time how amazing Luffy is.</br>  <br>in order to emphasize my answer I have to post several pages.<br><br>Oda made a chapter where the straw hats almost got an unidentified treasure chest.<br><br>A monster appeared so the treasure got taken out of their reach and we never got to see what was in that chest by the way.<br><br>Then even the monster got terrified because we were shown what (at the time) we believed to be the largest giants ever depicted in one piece.<br><br>Oda named the very next chapter (222)<br> New Heavy Weights Appear <br>In the following pages Blackbeard's crew is introduced, starting with Van Auger.<br>Now here is the two pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>that was before usopp knew of CoO though<br><br>he didnt even know he had awakened it and pulled off a crazy shot.<br><br>when he actually masters it should be even better than that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is strong evidence that Van Auger was pre haki as well (fought Ace), and other than how amazing his shot was, no evidence he used haki to do it.<br>Even with CoO Usopp has not matched that shot (hitting a target beyond the horizon line) ever.</br></br>  <br>By being kawaii</br>  <br>he hasnt because this was his first time using it ever with sugar. He didn't even realize he awakened it.<br><br>Sanji and zoro and luffy were the only haki users post time skip and now usopp is the fourth.</br></br></br>  <br>But Blackbeard had all those Level 0 prisoners kill each other.</br>    Jesus gets jobbed <br><br>when am I supposed to like Sabo.</br></br>  <br>That would be his name if he had Apoo's fruit. Or hell, any other music related one.</br>  <br>Correct, he had no choice but to because he didn't want that many crew members and didn't want to release legitimate competition to come challenge him later. Kuzan put all those lv 5 prisoners in permanent ice stasis (odas version of death) on punk hazard, so he shouldn't be too upset that BB eliminated all the others.<br>I agree that eventually Kuzan will fight Blackbeard and lose.</br></br>  <br>I guess the same place he got matching clothes with his logo on for his whole crew?</br>  I really hope that Fujitora gets a proper fight like Kuma, instead of Sabo or someone else meddling in and saving them. Luffy and Law probably can't fight (unless Mansherry intervenes) but there's still Zoro practically woundless and Kanjuro with Kinemon who haven't really fought.  <br>Fuji is not going to attack law &amp; luffy</br>  <br>He doesn't. People are just assuming he does because of recent events.</br>  <br>Zoro and Fuji already began a swordsman duel do you really believe Zoro won't beat an impossible opponent in the arc everyone says mirrors alabasta?<br>They gon fight EVEN IF Fuji plans to let them go all along.<br>The swordsman duel started already no way it won't finish. That's the real reason Zoro fought a easy opponent in the conflict.</br></br></br>  <br><br>remember that clothes act differently on the bodies of fruit users. Sabo's clothes don't burn away, Luffy's stretch with him, Bonney's change size with her. It stands to reason that Aldiva's clothes are not affected by the slipperyness, but are, themselves, slippery as well</br></br>  <br>Okay assuming her shoes are frictionless why isn't she constantly in motion or able to stand upright? <br><br>Surely there is some traction there albeit how little it is.<br><br>She is also able to hold objects like her mace.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bonneys doesnt change</br>  i just read another translation of the chapter cause fuck my manga panda didn't make any fucking sense other then the fleet admiral was super mad, now i can actually understand why<br><br>jesus fuck manga panda</br></br>  <br>I don't think he's going to risk his position in the government. There's already an Admiral who deserted to go against the WG, there probably won't be another.<br><br><br>Zoro would definitely not beat Fuji. He's stronger and more important than Doffy, he's the typical stronger character at the end of an arc that forces them to leave. I somehow want Zoro to lose, but that shouldn't happen, so I hope that it ends in a stalemate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm.</br>  <br><br>I assume that she can control how slippery they get, but in more of a subconscious way a la buggy. Buggy can't get cut and Alvida can't get hit/hurt with anything else. They are a nice match.</br></br>  <br>Mangapanda is only good for pic related</br>  <br>I don't think Fuji gives a fuck about the government anymore.</br>  <br>I think one of the Blues is well known for having more advanced technology than the others. Possibly West Blue, the one Sanji is from.</br>  <br>He's just seen the equivalent of an earthquake combined with the Amritsar Massacre and all of it because of the government.</br>  <br>What I mean is that Oda wouldn't have Fuji be introduced this arc, only to leave the Marines at the end of it with us barely knowing about him. Aokiji made sense, we knew a lot, and he had a big fight and all that. Besides it'd be having the same shit happening again in a span too short.</br>   6th months till Gear Four appears in the anime   <br>Jesus can't become a pirate anymore right.<br><br>It looked like Sabo burned one of Jesus's eyes until it became blind and 3rd degree burns all over his face.</br></br></br>  <br> Zoro would definitely not beat Fujitora. <br>Okay, I can honestly understand feeling the way you feel, but everything about Dressrosa proves you wrong.<br><br>Oda isn't ever gonna have an admiral defeat the SH crew again, he already did that three times, with the third being the direct cause of the time skip with Luffy literally having a flashback of it and saying "never again!!!" Before he accepted to be trained by Rayleigh.<br><br>Zoro will win.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This chapter made Akainu look like a fucking joke. All he did was whine like a little faggot and get told off by his bosses and even his fucking subordinate. <br><br> M-muh reputation <br> Y-yeah?! W-well you're not allowed in my club anymore if you don't make it up to me! &gt;:C </br></br></br>  <br><br>I think he will be the chaotic one, with the navy tolerating his mess because he follows their orders.</br></br>  <br>From my understanding, in ranking of actual power held:<br><br>Tenryuubuto: The Top, but don't actually do anything and simply exist in opulence. The royalty that don't do anything.<br><br>Cipher Pol: Agents of the Tenryuubuto and work to make sure they stay in power. The FBI that does undercover work.<br><br>Gorousei: Actual head of the government part of the World Government that makes decisions. The Senate or Congress that passes laws.<br><br>Marine HQ: The military part of the World Government. In charge of enforcing the WG's rules. The military that answers to the government.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't wait when Akainu tells Kizaru to head to Dressrosa with the authority to Buster Call as well since he can't trust Fujitora anymore.  <br> Mangapanda thinks Hiken is Fire Gun <br> Mangapanda thinks Mariejois is Marie Joy </br></br>  <br>I get what you say, but its not like someone like him who hasnt drink the Marines kool-aid could remain an Admiral for long.<br>But something would happen that will make him keep his position.<br><br> Fiji, pls take Law away <br> Save us from the Waterlawl ride. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it didn't.<br>Akainu is the first character to legitimately challenge the Gorosei in the whole story.<br>I thought Akainu was a bitch because of what he did at Marijeford, but this proved me wrong.<br><br>Akainu is mad at Fujitora really only because he feels his actions humiliate the Marines. They both clearly agree about removing the shichibukai.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing is not getting curbstomped and another thing is winning. We are still at a too early point to have Zoro beat an Admiral, especially before even Luffy doing it. In fact, that shouldn't happen until after they've beat some Yonkou's high members or something.<br><br>A stalemate from a close fight favoring Fuji would be for the best.

WG serves the Tenryuubito. Remember it was the Tenryuubito who created the WG some hundred years ago.</br>  <br>This is shonen. Blindness actually makes you stronger.</br>  <br>That's Kizaru though.</br>  Would you sacrifice your balls to  revive Monet?   <br>Why the fuck would anyone use mangapanda? Shitty translations aside, they plaster their watermark fucking everywhere.<br><br>I swear I've seen pages with that fucking panda over word bubbles and characters' faces.</br></br></br>  <br>she would because how else would she use it<br><br><br>any motion would send it flying</br></br></br></br>  <br> We are still at a too early point to have Zoro beat an Admiral, especially before even Luffy doing it. <br>Doffy was above admiral level.</br></br>  Who is ready for Kid and alliance to get btfo???  <br>Of course I did. Fuji won't have good relations with the WG, but that doesn't mean he won't keep working for them. Even if he doesn't agree with their ways, he has accepted them, and now is willing to go after Law and Luffy even after all they did.</br>  <br> op-op fruit </br>  <br> No Harpy parts <br><br>Shit<br>would rather bang Sugar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Had no choice <br>Come on man, he totally had a choice. Blackbeard doesn't hold grudges, but he's totally got no qualms about killing anybody because it suits him.</br></br>  <br><br>The guy who ran away from Kuzan, yeah.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Doffy get dumpstered by Aokiji</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>With or without wings, Monet is the best.</br>  <br>People only use Panda because they come out really early and they want an idea of what's going on.<br><br>When you read Panda, you don't actually read the translation, you just kinda skim it</br></br></br>  Anyone here play Dance Battle?<br><br>Why don't more people play Dance Battle?<br><br>Also why isn't it in available in English yet?<br><br>Also did they remove the referral bonuses in the 2.0 update? I can't find any options to share to Twitter/Facebook/LINE to get 5 coins like some online guides indicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alvida had to take her shoes off to slide around on the floor. She can obviously control it though.</br>  <br><br>This. Even if mangastream uses a lot of slang, at least it is pretty understandable and trustworthy.</br></br>  <br>Dude...<br>Just think about the shit you say. Jozu lost a fuckin arm to Kuzan, Kuzan lost a leg to Akainu, Whitebeard lost half his face and had incinerated internal organs.<br><br>Luffy outright would have refused to continue his journey if Rayleigh didn't tell him he's admiral tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shanks <br> btfo <br><br>yeah, no.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Mangastream takes a lot of liberties with their translations but at least it's coherent.</br>  <br>We already had a "stalemate" where Fuji ran away from Zoro after his gimmick failed.</br>  <br><br>Given the story so far:<br><br>The Gorousei seem to be on top of the world since they control the marines. Tenryuubito seem to be nothing but just the descendents of the creators of the world government; out of respect for that fact it seems the marines give them a status above normal nobles. However, there has been hints to some sort of national treasure in Mariejois and a prophecy involving the "D." line.... Not to mention the ancient weapons and the Void century. It could be possible that it's later reveled that the Tenryuubito have access to a powerful relic that their specific blood lines can only activate, maybe this relic allows them to strong-arm the world government into giving them their special status as long as they promise not to use it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as there is 'sort of' a depression for her to hold it it would be fine. The curvature of the mace and her grip strength will provide resistive forces.<br><br>If its the same mace she used while fat there should be no problems, except it would slip around a bit while moving.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you seriously think that Luffy is at the same level as Whitebeard and his crew? If you do, I can't say anything, there's no point in arguing with retards.<br><br><br>That wasn't a fight, that was just a small clash.</br></br></br></br>  So is fuji fight trastraw or is he giving the finger to Akainu?<br><br>I'm not sure either way due to translation shit.</br></br>  <br>What will ascend luffy to be whitebeard tier?<br>Awakening?<br>He's gonna need to be that level to reach raftel.</br></br></br>  <br>He would have to become the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br> ... <br><br/></br></br>  <br>In Marineford it was directly shown that Doflamingo was stronger than a WB commander.<br><br>Yes, I think that Luffy is stronger than Ace was when he died. You don't?<br><br>Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died.<br><br>Luffy is not as strong as Shanks.<br><br>It was a fight. Fujitora ran away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died. <br><br><br>Release day is amazing</br></br></br></br>  <br> if I don't like Luffy's statements they weren't said <br>Fuck off.<br>We are 3 months to revery in story you stupid fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard <br><br>hahaha get a load of this guy</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Doffyfags were dead but I guess not.<br><br>He's not, he ran from Aokiji like a bitch and tried to kick Fujitora and failed. He's not admiral level.</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to hear Akainu say what he said to give Fuji reason to keep doing what he's doing and that's to expose the WG for it's wrongdoings.<br>Akainu barring an Admiral just to save face is being absurd and it will only strengthen Fuji's idea of justice. Fuji won't be doing anything to the strawhats as he has no intention of handing them over. So, he'll remain chasing them and fail doing so while never being able to report back until people call out Akainu's extremism.</br></br>  It's depressing to think the best we have (for free) is Mangastream.<br><br>I miss Mangarule and Powermanga.</br></br>  <br>Question<br>How the FUCK did Akainu not get a little permanent injury from the most DIRECT hit from Whitebeard</br></br>  <br>Its for free so I wont bitch, nigga.</br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died. <br><br>I hope you realise how wrong you are when Luffy severely loses his first fight with Kaido.</br></br></br>  <br>He was permanently scarred. Look close.</br>  <br>he lost his first encounter with doflamingo and it took gettings his organs mangled and luffy going gear fourth twice to take him down.<br><br>Where the hell are people getting whitebeard level from<br><br>his gear fourth kong guns didnt even beat some animals on that island hancock keeps her pets</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are tattoos dumbass</br>  <br>I think he is referring to the frankenstein scars</br>  <br>Luffy is admiral level his organs healed partway into the fight</br>  <br>Akainu has some awesome tattoos. Yakuza style tats are just cool as fuck.</br>  <br> Luffy severely loses his first fight with Kaido. <br>I just hope he doesnt go all post- Marineford angst again and realizes that ´´okay, I fucked up, lets make an actual keikaku´´</br></br>  <br>neither luffy nor doffy are admiral level<br><br>They are in that niche zone between admirals and vice admirals.<br><br>Admirals are masters of all and super well rounded. There is a reason Doflamingo ran away from an Aokiji who no longer had ties to the government. He could have possibly beat him with luck but he knew he was definitely at the disadvantage. Breaking the ice was a bluff and aokiji was just letting him know he could kill him if he really wants to start something.</br></br></br></br></br>  Luffy is not Admiral level.<br><br>An Admiral would not need thousands of people's help to defeat anyone not to mention Law doing half the work,</br></br>  <br>You mean like with crocodile where he tried using water during round 2?</br>  Pick one  any decent translation of the chapter by now ?  Anyone else think this smug bastard's gonna beat Zoro to Mihawk?  <br>niggastream was out since 14 hours ago</br>  <br>first one</br>  <br>No<br><br>VIZ's will be out on monday, and powermanga in a couple weeks. Good translation takes time, save it for a reread of the arc.</br></br></br>  <br>bro, the boys at niggastream got you ass covered</br>  <br>That was hardly a plan, more like picking something up on the way, but given how they were in a rush its okay.<br>I mean more like a more intricated plan that involves more than show up and beat up the baddies, then again it will always end up in that.</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo, the king of the One Piece underground and would probably know about Aokiji and Blackbeard's connections. <br><br>For one thing, Blackbeard's crew is getting powerful devil fruit, which could easily tie in Doflamingo. <br><br>I feel like the whole "I don't have any intention of fighting you . . . what's your current status, Kuzan?" thing was an intentional verbal attack on Aokiji, probably since he knew good details about Kuzan and BB. He probably thought it wasn't in his best interest to fight Aokiji, regardless of if he could or couldn't beat him.<br><br>But I agree on what you said. I feel like Doffy's actually just really hotheaded, lashing out at Fuji sometime during this arc when Fuji ragged on the Shichibukai, while not fighting Aokiji. Makes power levels more bullshit, but personally I think doffy would have been murdered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido, Big Mom, and Shanks were all stronger than final days Whitebeard. He was still really strong and still had his op fruit, but he was on life support literally.<br><br>Kaido and Shanks arent.<br><br>The real reason WB told his commanders DONT INTERFERE is if Shanks was there to kill him, that way his sons wouldn't also be killed.<br><br>Shanks blocked Akainu with Haki.<br>Whitebeard got his face melted.<br><br>Think about WB speech when he said he wouldn't always be the strongest, he didn't mean when he died he meant in that time that he was alive.<br>He was really really sick physically to the point that at one point he seized up due to his medical condition, which caused all his commanders to look and get distracted from their own fights.<br><br>Do you seriously believe that a rubber man, immune to quake, immune to blunt damage, resistant to all damage, who can retain his rubber property vs haki and exponentiate his attack power with gear 4 could not hit Whitebeard while he randomly gets full body paralyisis for brief periods during the fight?<br><br>Whitebeard was only strongest at Marineford because of his reputation.<br>He hadn't been in a real fight for a long time, think about that too, think about how BB thought WB would die easily, because he knew WB wasn't the strongest anymore, knew all about his illness from being on ship 20 fucking years.<br><br>WHITEBEARD WAS NOT STRONGEST AT MARINEFORD.<br><br>Shanks easily was, that's why he stopped Kaido from taking advantage he knew WB was inflating his power level to protect his family by reputation (remember FI)?<br>If WB wasn't perceived as strongest still, those islands would get challenged even before his death.<br>You gotta read with eyes unclouded anon.<br>On a unrelated note Buggy was looking for Johns Treasure.<br>Did you know that Luffy never obtained the (exclamation mark circled by Oda) unidentified treasure chest within this derelict ship?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He said 'decent translation'</br></br>  <br>He'll get wiped out like Burgess</br>  <br>the 'trusted' translators agreed it was pretty on point this week</br>  <br>ain't nothin wrong wit' a little slang, gotta loosen up and enjoy the flow</br>  <br>Sorry. 14 ours ago i was a work or sleeping.</br>  <br>One Piece threads will always be terrible, because the mods doesn't care.</br>  <br>Why is everyone assuming that he's going to quit the marines instead of pursuing Luffy?</br>  <br>Because we read the decent translation<br><br>his reply was akin to "pfft like I care" or "That's fine by me"<br><br>when akainu stuttered and told him he would be kicked out if he didnt kill luffy/law</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>"That's fine by me" could also mean he's fine with taking out Luffy to make up for his actions.</br>  <br>What if that translation is based on an incorrect reading by the "trusted" translator?<br>If Fuji attacks Zoro next week should we default to manga panda since it would confirm one group translates real but ugly while another translates styled based on fan thoery of the translator?</br></br>  <br>Black suit Doffy master race</br>  <br><br>Looking at this, I wonder how many times a week do One piece characters have sexual intercourse? Or you think they all are actually virgins?</br></br>  <br><br>It's the island from the cover story with the quicksand quicksand guy where kaido's forces rivet-plated an entire island then in the end Drake X showed up</br></br>  <br> virgins <br> children <br> pregnancy <br> sex slaves for the tenryubito <br><br>quad satan pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>can't people just accept that it was probably intentionally ambiguous, on the part of both Oda and Fujitora?</br></br></br>  <br><br> the crew having frequent orgies <br><br>Muh dick</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>That's some quality post, mate.</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo fucked all the women in his crew</br>  <br>It was definitely meant to be ambigous but you have to take into the context of everything else. He did something he knew Akainu would be pissed for and pretty much did the shounen equivalent of cursing out akainu via cellphone.<br><br>His words about being told what to do wouldn't be a "yes sir right away sir"</br></br></br>  Is Corazon the only flashback character with devil's fruit? Am I missing some other characters?  <br>it's a new age, and yonkos wont be able to exist in the presence of a Pirate King<br>They have to fall and these are the real contenders to make Shanks fall, the only other one to BTFO Shanks is Luffy, but he has no reason to Shanks <br><br>The reign of the one armed bastard is coming to a close man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Jora?</br>  <br>Even Jora?</br>  <br>Why was his devil fruit such pointless shit that existed for one gimmick scene with law crying? <br><br>This is one of the cheapest things Oda done in one piece.</br></br></br>  <br><br>- Zoro fucks Robin everyday and Nami twice a week (when he gets money)<br><br>- Usopp is constantly being teased by Nami, maybe she sucks his cock in the morning sometimes  for free <br><br>- Luffy has fucked Robin a few times, when she joined the crew, after her rescue from EL, and post time-skip being the more memorable ones. He fucks Nami at least three times a week.<br><br>- Franky is only interested on Robin, so they fuck 3-4 times a month for sexual release.<br><br>- Chopper constantly takes baths with Nami and Robin, he's used to see them naked and also is not interested in human women.<br><br>- Brook is always peeping on the girls, but he  just couldn't get a boner, YOHOHOHOHO <br><br>- Sanji  don't even know how a pussy looks like </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does Sabo get those batshit crazy eyes so much? Is he Yandere for Luffy tier?  <br>As far as I remember yes Maybe Kuina had a Devil Fruit too, that's why her father killed her, he wanted the fruit for himself</br>  <br><br>even moot</br></br>  <br><br>Shanks blocked an akainu who had already taken a whitebeard beating. Sure he got back up but he wasnt nearly in the same shape as he was prewhitebeard<br><br>You guys are silly. Whitebeard took a billion attacks and still beat the shitout of blackbeard and he needed his entire crew to kill him<br><br> luffy can beat blackbeard <br><br>just stop</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He´s not all right in the head.<br>But may as well be yandere as well.</br></br>  <br>it was flashback abd roci was gonna die anyway (from Oda's POV)<br>he knew he never had to show the practical use for a pirate</br></br>  <br>It's great if someone like Teach eat Absalom and Corazon's fruit. Unless if he stinks.</br>  <br>Pointless? Without it there was no way in hell he would ever get the Ope Ope fruit. Do you not see how clumsy he was. Seriously, do you extrapolate at least a little? Or does reading alone uses up all your mental resources.</br>  <br> Sanji don't even know how a pussy looks like </br>  <br>Shiki and his levitation fruit</br>  <br>All these fucking assumptions holy shit, and no I still stand by my point, he's not as strong as Whitebeard, even the same Whitebeard at Marineford.</br>  <br>You forgot Usopp's mom.</br>  <br>First Doffy lost his hair<br><br>now his throne</br></br></br>  <br> Why was his devil fruit such pointless shit <br>That fruit would make you a great assassin if not for Haki bullshit <br><br>It would make you arguably a better assassin then even invisibility</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Dellinger?</br>  <br> I won't let anyone touch my little brother </br>  <br>Kuina is Kaido<br><br>*K*uina<br>*K*aido<br><br>Oda is a genius</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a trap nigga<br> Cutie D. was the bottom bitch </br></br>  <br>Was the favorite</br>  <br><br>Cause Yonkos stand in the way to Raftel and One Piece.</br></br>  <br>Shanks blocked Magma.<br>Shanks blocked Magma.<br>shanks blocked Magma.<br><br>Easily. With Haki. With one arm tied behind his back.<br><br>Whitebeard got melted by magma. Whitebeard was unable to harm Aokiji with anything but his devil fruit.<br>He was unable to harm Akainu without using QUAKE.<br><br>Shanks intentionally did NOT use the sharp side of his blade vs Akainu.<br><br>Stop making yourself appear retarded just because you don't want to be wrong. You are, faggot.<br>Revery 3 month away either Luffy is super close to strong enough to fight Blackbeard or he's gonna fuckin die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido &gt; Kaidan (stairs)<br>Holy fuck Oda!</br></br>  Oda sold himself out after the timeskip. He's been creating shitty characters that don't fit One Piece at all, like pedo bait Sugar and fujo bait Dellinger.<br>As a result, the fanbase became more and more cancerous <br><br>Law is pretty much the co-protagonist at this point and I don't see it changing anytime soon</br></br></br>  <br>His clumsiness was conveniently inactive while he was stealing Ope Ope from Barrels' hideout. He could've done it without his fruit.</br>  <br>We knew that since the shit with Kuma though.</br>  <br>Shepard's nakama killed Kuina?</br>  <br>The attack wasnt aimed at shanks. It was aimed at a defenseless fodder marine and it was spread out instead of the concentrated attacks he used against whitebeard. Not nearly the same. <br><br>There is no way this version of luffy beats the blackbeard that was in marineford.That means he isn't sick whitebeard level and your whole theory falls apart<br><br>he doesn't beat akainu either. or whitebeard. Or any of the other admirals. <br><br>Even if gear 4th could possibly let him hang with them he will inevitably get his hakiless time period and die.<br><br>He couldn't even finish doflamingo in his first use of it and doflamingo was just on the defensive taking hit after hit.<br><br>Luffy will get stronger of course but to say he is currently as strong as whitebeard is hilariously inaccurate.<br><br><br>We knew he kept his word. What we didnt know is that he had a limit for SCIENCE!<br><br>most /evil/ scientists don't have a moral compass and put the research above all else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the risk of eating a devil fruit. You might get something pretty shitty.<br><br>But his fruit was rather useful as a spy tool, because he was able to make phone calls whenever he wanted to without any chance of anybody listening in.</br></br></br>  <br>there needs to be more shitty ones to make what spandam said about it true<br><br>so far all we have is sui sui and corazon's as the truly shitty fruits and they aren't that awful</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, we know he's eventually going to go after the Yonko for one reason or another. But he wasn't actively going after Kaido like people in universe are assuming, he just wanted to fuck up Doffy.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>People with shit fruits aren't going to make it in new world.</br>  <br> Swim through solid <br> Tactical Stealth  <br> shit  <br><br>are u a giraffefag as much as you are a tripfag?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Haki is willpower. Whitebeard is old, so he has no will left. Him passing on his will to his 'children' was one of the focuses of his attack.<br><br><br>More like:<br>- Zoro fucks robin regularly. Gets extorted by Nami every month or so for sex (she forces him to pay)<br>- Usopp gets the discounted price of free to fuck nami since she needs someone regularly and cant do most of the cew<br>- Luffy fucks no one because he's dumb<br>- Franky fucks no one, but gets off on exposing himself to the  guys <br>- Chopper fucks no one because bestiality<br>- Brook masturbates to the girls panties<br>- Sanji masturbates to  what's left of the panties when Brook is done  and he  adds his  semen to their food</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read all the way to the end<br><br>I said they aren't that awful. Just comparatively to every other single devil fruit power I would have them both at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br>Chopper's is useless if eaten by a human.</br>  <br>it gives them enlightenment. Oda still hasn't clarified what that means.<br><br>It might also make them more attractive like alvida's did</br></br></br>  <br>Dellinger is a cute young femboy, not a woman.</br>  <br>You don't understand. There are no shitty fruits, just shitty people who get them. That's the entire point of devil fruits. They are just random shit but no matter how fucking stupid they sound you could still use them for lots of useful things.<br><br>Many people thought that being made of rubber was a stupid useless power before reading the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>what is fun ?</br>  <br><br>Anyone with Observation Haki could fuck Roci. It's only useful if used against fodder.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps Luffy is the first gomu-gomu user who invents gear.</br>  <br>A human who ate the Human Human fruit would be able to transform into 3 different versions of a human, and would get the natural physical buff that all Zoan fruits give.</br>  <br>No there are definitely some shitty fruits. No one would say "man I am so glad I got the soundless fruit!" in a world where people can turn into light and use telekinesis.<br><br>Yes it has a usage but it's still one of the worst fruits. There is no getting around it. Even if you think it's okay for assassination Lucci is far better off the Leopard fruit than he is with a soundless fruit.</br></br></br>  <br>Not definition, but example.<br><br>You don't know what's the definition of the word definition, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Do human fruits give the carnivore buff or the herbivore buff since we are omnivores</br>  <br>Because he felt comfortable to know that even if he does fuck up, no one will hear it. That peace of mind alone is probably enough to alleviate a great part of his clumsiness. Plus, clumsiness aside, not being heard helps out in heist situation like this immensely. How else would he shoot explosives and shit. Instead of confusing everyone, it would give him away.</br>  <br>why doesn't blackbeard just kill kuzan and take his fruit so he has 3 fruits?</br>  <br>- Zoro fucks Sanji regularly. <br>- Usopp sucks Chopper dick regularly<br>- Luffy is a transgender, he's actually a girl<br>- Franky fucks the ship becos he's robot<br>- Brook doesn't have a dick<br>- Sanji doesn't want to fuck women, he's only admires them, he fucks nobody<br>- Nami and Robin are lesbian</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know that he isn't trying to.</br>  <br>blackbeard might have a limit to 2 fruits</br>  <br/>  <br><br> implying BB doesnt have like a shitload of DF powers now </br></br>  <br> Franky fucks the ship becos he's robot <br><br>But anon that´s incest.</br></br></br>  <br>He would die if he has two logia.</br>  <br>He said on Punk Hazard "I'm going to defeat all of them", so he's been wanting to go after Kaido for a while... and by that I mean a day.</br>  <br> this is why he didn't want mera-mera for himself </br>  How are BB and his crew stealing fruits? Clearly Jesus has the ability because he said when Luffy came out of G4 "Luffy is at death's door your gomu gomu fruit is mine" and he seemed to think he could take Sabo's fruit off him.<br><br>DFs don't spawn where the person dies do they?</br></br>  What would happen if someone eats an Oil Logia?<br>Will he drown because he is a fruit user or will he float because he is oil?</br>  <br>fruits so shitty I forgot all about them<br><br>I assume if you awaken your "jacket" fruit you should be able to forcefully take control of things</br></br></br>  <br>I want a filler episode with Franky dating Sunny a la Futurama.</br>  <br>They give the Mythical Zoan buff.</br>  <br>might float but be weakened when touching it<br><br>  I want to know when we will see a water water fruit user or salt water, clearly oda is keeping it in the back burner for future use  </br></br></br>  <br>Or turn things into jackets.... I smell a Wapolesque cover series.</br>  <br>DFs apparently go to the nearest compatible fruit, so Burgess was probably carrying all sorts of normal fruits in that big bag.<br>I'm sure BB just extracts the power directly from the user with Yami Yami.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he has a bag full of fruits, to make sure the DF will respawn there.</br></br>  What did Blackbeard do under the black cloth?  <br>If he activates it then he should float, similar to Akoji's bicycle stunt. If not, then auto drown.</br>  <br>Basically he's weakened but he'll still be able to walk on water.</br>  <br>That's true, but he wasn't specifically targeting Kaido. Kaido just happened to be connected to his current target.</br>  <br> he sucked Whitebeard's dick </br>  <br>I wonder if he is still wearing that uniform. I kinda hope so because it looks cool as fuck but at the same time it wouldn't really make sense for him to.</br>  <br>Sucked WB's cock to get the fruit out</br>  <br>We all know.  Blowjob.  The black cloth works as a spoiler tag.</br>  <br>He deep throated Whitebeard</br>  <br>sucked the big white moby dick of course</br>  <br>Akainu dropped everything he was doing in a major war to immediately kill Coby with all his might.<br>Without Akainu interfering, Coby hard countered Blackbeard who was planning to sink the whole island, shown literally distracting him with his Haki declaration.<br>Coby is not fodder.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to know how he got a submarine and I want to know what he named it. Why hasn't this been asked in the SBS? If I remember correctly, Law's birthday was suggested by a fan. Why hasn't anyone suggested a name for Law's submarine? Bandai had to print "Trafalgar Law's Submarine" on the model kit they made? They should've realized at this point that "Hey, doesn't this thing need a name if it's popular enough to sell?"<br><br>Someone suggested back then that the submarine could be named "The Walrus" because Beatles and Yellow Submarine? Can't remember.</br></br></br>  <br>That's an awesome power</br>  <br>He absorbed Whitebeards Soul with his Yami Yami or he just sucked his dick while his angel list lasted.</br>  <br>The Strongest Man in the World: die by a blowjob</br>  Haki lets you to attack DF users' real body, allowing you to hurt Logias and Paramecias like Luffy whose bodies are changed in one way or another.<br>What happens if you hit a Zoan with Haki?</br>    <br>I guess you would hit him as if he were in his human form.</br>  <br>Not as good as a Possession Fruit. Think about it. You can possess anyone. Take out a knife. Slit their throat. Winrar.

Time to warm up the ufo I guess</br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr is probably the worst place to follow advice from aside from DA. You're better off being told your shit than being in a hugbox.

My recording equipment sucks and it's hard to play with the guys on titanpad without editing shit everytime.</br>  <br>I'm pretty certain most of the anons only record a few measures at a time and splice them together before sending them in.</br>  <br>Yep. I do that.<br><br>I wouldn't worry that much about equipment either, some of us record with iphone mics.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really? Unless it's really different segments separated by a really long rest and I can't reliably do it otherwise I usually go for single take to preserve the same feeling of style throughout.</br></br>  <br>I usually record the whole song at once.

Best way to do it is to run through all the parts once, and then rerecord any isolated sections that had problems.<br><br>You can usually rerecord chunks separated by rests of a measure or more and not lose the feel/style of the piece. The amount of takes Wasteland and Tank got was unreal.<br><br> pic unrelated, rip accordion players </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am so sorry. I only wish that I could redo my part, but it's too late now.</br>  <br>Not a problem if you're recording in a DAW (Audacity, Reaper, whatever).<br> The "feeling" issue is definitely worth considering when recording in chunks, but if you can play a part consistently (comes with practice) then this issue is mostly mitigated.</br></br>  <br>It's OK /a/non, I only know how to destroy at least you can create.</br>  <br><br> Real World (Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita OP)  <br> Flute, Bb Clarinet, Alto Sax, Bb Trumpet, Trombone, E-Bass, Drumset <br><br>Aww man, I haven't played my sax in years and you're making me want to break it out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's beautiful.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who contributed into spawning that abomination.</br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck off.

You guys are amazing. </br>  I honestly like our Colors more than the original.  <br>It's a little comfier</br>   Somehow no Tsubasa wo Kudasai   Sis Puella Magica brought me to tears.  <br>Isn't it more like this?</br>  <br>It's great that you didn't realize how horribly out of tune everyone was.</br>  <br>I really liked it a lot more than I expected to</br>  <br>I could hear it due to being part of an orchestra for some years now but I didn't let it bother me.<br>I enjoyed a wonderful rendition.<br><br>I've been surprised by the entire album. In a real recording studio and with a little practice one would think this was done by actual pros.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just noticed, is this in f minor or A flat major?</br></br>  <br> I've been surprised by the entire album. In a real recording studio and with a little practice one would think this was done by actual pros. <br>What I enjoyed was the passion. Sure, it wasn't totally perfect, but you could feel that everyone really cared for what they were doing, and for the project. And for us.<br><br>I know it's in the spirit of the boards to release it for free, but I'd pay like 5 bucks for it on bancamp or some shit.</br></br></br></br>  The last track is what I expected the whole thing to sound like. Well done anons, this is something we can all be proud of.  <br>I agree with everything you just said, even the paying of funds.</br>  <br>And I just watched Gakkou Gurashi</br>  Anyone getting bad gateway on the titanpad?  <br>Mixing quality is inconsistent, but this is a step up from /a/ sings</br>  <br>Get used to it</br>  <br>This is the TV size. It's in A-flat major.</br>  <br>Yeah. Titanpad goes down a lot.</br>  <br>It crashes all the time especially when there's a huge traffic like now, just refresh it after a few minutes.</br>  is the anon from orchestr/a/ that played the trumpet here? what mic did you use?  <br>Pretty Cool</br>  <br>There's a few of us. I personally used my  macbook's  built in mic</br>  <br>Here's the link for the sheets.<br><br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/t8<wbr>a28tadrolcm/dangodaikazoku<br><br>Again, this is sort of a basic arrangement, so feel free to record extra melody/harmony/percussion not in the arrangement as you please. I intend for the song to be /a/ sings-esque, the more the merrier, especially in the chorus.<br><br>I still don't see what  was trying to point out, but feel free to QC for me. I probably won't change anything though.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I think one the guys mentioned he used an SM57, you can hear him playing the first trumpet in Tank.</br>  i like it  <br><br>Some folks in orchestr/a/ literally use their phones. Wouldn't recommend it for brass - at the very least, if you can't shell out the money for an SM57+setup (it uses XLR cables) get a Blue Yeti USB mic. They're pretty decent.</br></br>   tfw im too shit to play any instruments <br> tfw all i can do is sing baritone tunes <br> tfw I missed all the /a/ sings shit <br><br>shit sucks</br></br></br></br>  <br>hahaha nice<br><br>wow it is very clear. i like it. did that anon also do Ren'ai Circulation?</br></br></br>  <br>Cool, duly noted.</br>  <br> did that anon also do Ren'ai Circulation? <br>I think that's a different guy, he also had a pretty decent set up though.</br></br>   Nippon Egao Hyakkei (Joshiraku) <br>the best one by far</br>  <br>you can whistle</br>  <br>What if you can't?</br>  Damn, you guys sound good!  <br>No luck getting hold of a euph?</br>  <br>Nope. I'll keep trying though.</br>  <br><br>OP here. I'd be more than pleasantly surprised if it did happen. I admit, the odds are against it, but I can dream.</br></br>  I wish I knew how to play pipe organ. I'd be playing right along with you guys.  <br>I recognize those two.</br>  <br>Member of Orchestr/a/ here. Thanks for the thread. We were actually going to make one this weekend but I suppose we don't really need to now.</br>  <br><br>No problem, Orchestr/a/non. Thanks for the based tunes.</br></br>  How many people have joined the orchestra after the hype and visibility generated from this thread?  <br>Probably not too many, but I'm sure a few.</br>  <br>The better question is how many will stay after today.</br>  <br>Organs would be amazing. I've always wanted to hear Bach and Buxtehude live.</br>  <br>1 sax guy recorded a pretty awesome version of ZZZ, which is 1 more than usual when a thread's up.</br>  just started readin' this. do any of the boys get laid?  No but the girls do  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br>No, but Kiyoshi get's really close to vagina a few times and Assman is probably fucking bitches while the main story happens.</br>  <br>Lesbian sex</br>  <br>she shares her lemonade with kiyoshi</br>  prison school.

Andre losing his mind has definitely been going on for too long.</br>  <br>I want to fuck this hoe so badly<br><br>Delicious maso bitch made for rape</br></br></br>  <br>She's so pure and filthy both at the same time.</br>  <br>Anon...Andrenomics isn't over yet. Can't you see this is all an elaborate ploy by Andrei to get the Vice President back where she was before in order for his stocks to go back up?<br><br>Not to mention he trained another women to treat him the same as well.<br><br>If I was a betting man, I would put all my money on Andrenomics right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Andre turns out to be a hermaphrodite  <br>I've never been so impressed with a character before. She, as a whole, completely blew me away.</br>  <br>It's just in his... Nature!</br>  <br>The joke is definitely overplayed at this point. I'm hoping it's wrapped up in the next few chapters since they're talking about it now.<br><br><br>I'm with you on this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Andre man, he used to be a cool guy who cared about his friends, but had a masochist side, but now he is a full blown sexual deviant.<br><br>He needs to come to his senses during this cavalry battle and redeem himself, seriously, did he forget the wet t-shirt contest?</br></br></br>  <br>The fact VP is back may means he probably will as well.</br>  <br>Non of them do but one of them gets peed on lol.</br>  <br>Andre is even worse than Shingo right now.</br>  <br>It's just tsundere with more focus on violence and a piss fetish.<br><br><br>Andre choosing a wet t-shirt contest over a domme would be dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how can someone dislike best boy?</br>  When did it all go so wrong? Everything starting Mari's escape arc and onwards is godawful<br> Hana turned from a violent psychopath to generic tsundere <br> Meiko went kawaii uguu for 100 chapters (at least she's back now) <br> Chairman does fucking nothing  <br> Andre turned into literal gag <br> stupid bottle joke was never funny <br> significant drop in drawing quality starting ~ch150 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stupid bottle joke was never funny <br><br>Really? I chuckled quite a bit when gakutou almost peed into the PBR sama</br></br></br>  <br>Gakutou deserves to get laid the most. God tier character.</br>  <br>Indeed, he does deserve to get laid.</br>  <br>I find the 2nd arc better, at least the "girls hitting boyz" pseudojoke isn't used that much. andre is still funny imo, and while pbr can get dull, the pbr vs medusa talk was awesome</br>  <br>Andrenomics is probably the second best joke in the series. The best is Kiyoshi's guide to kissing girls</br>  <br> Hana turned from a violent psychopath to generic tsundere <br>Hana was always tsundere<br> Meiko went kawaii uguu for 100 chapters <br>Meiko i agree with, shitty way to develop a char<br> Chairman does fucking nothing  <br>Chairman never does anything besides be funny<br> Andre turned into literal gag <br>Andre was always a gag have you paid any fucking attention to what he looks like?<br> stupid bottle joke was never funny <br>Whats funny to some can be unfunny to others<br> significant drop in drawing quality starting ch150 <br>Havent noticed, looks way better than what it used to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if anything, seeing whacky amnesiac sylvio adventures is better than having him in school while everything around him goes to shit while he stays passive and gets shittalked</br>  <br>The point of the principal is looking badass while still always being useless.</br>  <br>I think Kiyoshi laughing even when he had no idea what the fuck was going on was pretty good.</br>  <br>that's a stupid point. he should be looking badass while being badass</br>  I can't wait for the anime to suck ass and make me pick up the manga  <br>You aren't reading the good manga then, Prison School is pretty much all about this kind of contradiction joke between how it looks and what is actually happening.<br><br>The principal is the best when he's talking about asses anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay sure, love me some ass-loving principal. Doesn't mean he have to be passive though.<br><br>And I kinda don't agree with what you say, ps isn't contradiction so much as absurdity .</br></br></br>    <br> Anon...Andrenomics isn't over yet. Can't you see this is all an elaborate ploy by Andrei to get the Vice President back where she was before in order for his stocks to go back up? <br> Not to mention he trained another women to treat him the same as well. <br> If I was a betting man, I would put all my money on Andrenomics right now. <br>So he diversified his Portfolio. Clever guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was so pissed at Kiyoshi at that point. I was like "No, no this is not funny you have no idea what is going on! Stop messing up my lesbian sex moment!"</br>  Raw usually comes out tomorrow right?  <br>yea and i guess the anime now too</br>  <br>Holy shit, I totally forgot, fuck yes.<br><br>  Gate <br>  Overlord <br>  Prison School <br>  Release of Little witch Academia 2 <br><br>And here I thought I wouldn't have much series to watch with the ones I were following who ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would act out the BL yaoi with him in a respectful non faggy way<br>This manga is what made me a homosexual. I came to realize what true BL is about and the deeper bonds that can form between men. But then I realize this can never happen because gay men are as awful as women. <br>Although I do think women are more attractive but do not deserve emotional attatchment.</br></br></br>  I started reading this 2 days ago and i'm already on chapter 182<br><br>This is a fantastic manga<br>I wish I had a girl like hana in my lifeTo pee on my face and to watch me pee, to take my first kiss and further seek to defile each otherThe potato mind break triggers me.<br>I want to see jo's face clearly and properly.<br>I want to see a god tier end for Gakuto.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gfdi, MOOT, the spoilers didnt work.</br>  <br>Definitely preferably with Vice-Pres. I kinda shipped them during the earlier chapters and i still do.

Is his brain retarded?<br>Why is wet t-shirt contest such a big thing for boys that they turned down their potential girlfriends?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Always in the back of my head when i read this i see the potential gag emerging of mari falling for gakuto if its played right. She would need to see he has an absolute perfect ass but will be reluctant to admit it because he shat himself.</br>  <br>Because you're retarded and missed the entire point of a gag manga. If you're taking it that seriously you need to read something else.</br>  <br> mari falling for gakuto if its played right <br>I was talking about Vice-Pres tho, whelp if that's your OTP then sure why not. But IMO i kinda prefer her to be a dyke that 69 was Intense</br></br>  <br> Why would Hana go to take a leak in the woods when the school clearly has outside toilet? <br>She was looking for kiyoshi and had to piss real bad?<br> Why was it never explained how Mari controls her birds? If she can control them with insane precision, why didn't she use it to aid her escape? <br>Didnt kate capture the crows?<br> Why would Andre ever be unhappy in prison if he's such hardcore M? <br>Because they were denying him punishment.<br> Why would USC be the ones deciding on cultural festival schedule? The fuck is the function of ASC then? <br>They both have different schedules..<br> Why did Kyioshi seriously think plastic bottle thing would work for real? Is his brain retarded? <br>Because he experienced something he never did in his life with a girl and wanted to pass it on to a friend. Its meant to be funny.<br> Why is wet t-shirt contest such a big thing for boys that they turned down their potential girlfriends? <br>Bros before hoes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kinda prefer her to be a dyke <br>Well she probably is and meiko might as well be too.</br></br>  <br> its a gag manga so it can be badly written  <br>oh ok m8. PrSc is clearly written with next to none forethought, we have a scene where Meiko is literally terrified of Mari but then 50 chapters laters apparently they're best friends forever.</br></br>  <br>You're reading a manga where the chairman of a school is watching anal porn on his laptop at work and generally just does stupid shit like the rest of the cast and you're complaining about bad writing? The problem is you.</br>  <br>She was looking for kiyoshi, toilet was too far and she couldnt hold it from drinking all that tea.<br>The manga isnt finished so theyre bound to get to it eventually.<br>If the crows were caught aiding and abeting it would possibly mean the crows getting injured or captured at some point.<br>He wants to feel pain and suffering, he was in a jail with 3 square meals for a guy that size with all of his friends.

Currently I'm putting pic related at 5/10. Obviously this is all up to individual tastes, but I want to see if any insight can be gleaned from what /a/ finds exactly average.<br><br>Also, but less important, 0/10 and 10/10 anime.<br><br>Maybe something easily quantifiable and most people would agree on like Dragonball or SAO or some shit should be 5/10? What do you think is a good measuring stick?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fine, fuck you too then /a/ssholes.<br><br>How about this one: I don't think any anime series has ever actually been 10/10 because it's impossible to do a whole series with no real flaws. I think only movies or OVA can possibly be 10/10, because perfection can only be created in smaller quantities.<br><br> tfw every thread you start goes straight to the bottom </br></br></br></br>  "Measuring sticks" are different. I'd rate something a 5/10 if I thought it was "not good", and 7/10 as "average". See MAL. Which one are you thinking of?<br><br>I only have one or two I might rate around 5/10 because that's quite substandard, and I usually wouldn't even force myself to watch more than a few episodes or so if it was like that. To watch a 0/10 long enough to judge it as such would be near unthinkable as well.<br><br>My 10s are HunterxHunter, FMA:B, and Steins;Gate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There will always be flaws, but if they're minor enough and the rest of the series is good enough, I don't think that disqualifies the possibility of 10/10.<br><br>Now, if the scale were larger, like out of 100, you would be right.</br></br></br>  <br> 7/10 as "average" <br>wat<br> See MAL. <br>okay this adds up now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm definitely thinking of 5/10 as being average, basically like the ANN scale. And yeah, I've never rated something 0/10 either, I think the lowest I've gone is 4/10 and everything else is just in the dropped pile.</br>  <br>I try to rate things out of ten in a linear fashion, so I can make use of the whole range from 0/10 to 10/10. Therefore for me, a 5 means that the show doesn't have any horrible flaws, but isn't outstanding in any way either. Even though I generally like them, a lot of SoL shows fall under that criterium for me. <br><br>I've only ever given 10/10 to one thing so far, and that was the first Ghost in the Shell movie. My best rated series is Serial Experiments Lain with a 9/10 (among a few others, but if someone asked about my favourite series, I'd tell them SEL). Then again, I'm a huge cyberpunk nerd, so my ratings might be somewhat skewed in that regard.<br>I've yet to give a show 0/10, but I don't bother watching stuff I know I won't at least like a bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations on your safe but acceptable taste, anon.</br>  <br>There is one 10/10 anime: Kill Me Baby.</br>  <br>5/10: Glasslip. Decent art, okay characters, takes itself way too seriously, nothing happens, utterly forgettable</br>  <br>a 5/10 show should have a few memorable characters and episodes. If a comedy series, there should be genuinely funny moments and episodes, if a drama, there should be scenes where you care. But the whole thing is dragged down by cliche/QUALITY/poor decisions.<br><br>My absolute 5/10 series would be Beelzebub. There are actually several characters I like quite a bit, but just as often I was pretty bored, and while the plot actually moved along, it was riddled with cliche and poor direction<br><br>a 3/10 would be something where the likeable characters are less significant, plotting decisions are worse, and often where filler bloat or budget crisis becomes intrusive and apparent. a no-ending is more than likely. My example here would probably be Accel World.<br><br>7/10 are going to be overall solid series with no serious flaws. These will almost always be only 1-2 cour. anything longer is going to have some fucking problem somewhere. Example here is Bartender. Technically proficient as all get out. No QUALITY, no filler, well acted, solid soundtrack and design. Whether or not you like it is purely whether or not the subject speaks to you.<br><br>0/10 is somewhat idiosyncratic. Rather than simply being awful in every respect, these could actually be something that would otherwise score anywhere along the scale, up to a near perfect score, but has one serious dealbreaker that simply cannot be overcome. This could be a terrible casting choice, a cringy character design, or animation which varies between slideshow and QUALITY with no middle ground. Zero no Tsukaima is demoted from probably a 4/10 (cliche and lazy, but mostly technically competent) to a 0/10 by virtue of Rie Kugimiya, who I hate so. so. so much.<br><br>10/10 is equally idiosyncratic, in that it's something which happens to hit my buttons and appeal to me. The difference between a 9/10 and a 10/10 is not technical in any way, but whether it speaks to me on a personal level. LOGH is 10/10 because I am a boring historian.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a great post.</br>  5/10 is don't watch.<br><br>6/10 is only watch if you have time to kill, it's currently airing, and there's some particular appeal to your unique tastes. ie Kuroko no Basket for me because sports anime is my guilty pleasure.<br><br>7/10 is worth watching if it's currently airing and you have time to kill.<br><br>8/10 is worth watching even outside of its airing time, can recommend to others.<br><br>9/10 is must watch regardless of when it aired.<br><br>10/10 is a show entirely based on my waifu going on dates with me.<br><br>That's how mine works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A 5/10 for me would be Plastic Memories.

Just because I prefer one route doesn't stop me from enjoying Fate and UBW.<br><br>What is it that you guys don't like about Heaven's Feel? And be real with me.

Disliking the lead heroine is a shitty excuse to shit on the entire route.</br>  <br>Well yeah. I liked it for Ilya and the final fight with Kotomine but those are literally the only scenes I enjoyed in Fate/Stay Night.</br>  It's literally the best route but it's usually shitters who can't even read VNs nor have attention span to do it that hate on it based on few screenshots from it.  <br>rinfags literally cannot keep themselves together when reading it</br>  I dislike F/SN as a whole, no problem with Heaven's Feel in particular.  everyone likes heavens feel, they just dont like sakura  <br>Wait... if you didn't enjoy FSN except for those scenes then why didn't you just quit while you were ahead?</br>  <br>Literally because I didn't have internet and had nothing to do.<br>I actually stopped after reading the Fate route for months and then just marathoned UBW and HF.</br></br>  <br>It's the best route with the worst heroine</br>  <br><br>OK, then why don't you guys like Sakura? And try to give an answer besides "LOL WORMSLUT LOL DAMSEL IN DISTRESS".</br></br>  <br>Not them, but she just didn't do anything for me. I find all the heroines pretty bland, to be honest.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127760<wbr>892/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Here is your response. <br><br><br> And if I'm reading manga, should I do the same thing but import it into the same deck with epwing2anki or some similar program? <br>Epwing2anki doesn't export directly to Anki so you can open the resultant .csv in a spreadsheet and in a new column tag the cards with the manga title or medium, etc. as a means to distinguish them from other cards if you want to use the singular deck. This will allow you to search by tag and/or study specific tagged cards. In this way it makes a large deck effectively smaller decks in one, and more manageable. <br><br>I would prefer to have multiple decks for these but study by tag and such features does allow for ease of manageability.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on what I'm reading.<br><br> Manga with furigana <br>Look up the word in Jisho, and then copy it to a text file.<br> Manga without furigana <br>Looking up words in Kanjitomo and adding them to its internal list. Export the list when I'm done reading. Alternatively, I use Google Input Tools for handwriting recognition.<br> Videogames <br>Google Input Tools, look up the words in Jisho and copy them to a text file.<br> Visual novels <br>Chiitrans Lite to look up the words on mouseover. Add the words to a text file. I also made a shitty script to copy the contents of the clipboard to a text file with a key, but it copies the whole sentence.<br> Light novels <br>Kindle with converted Aozora Bunko files and passed through the Amazon Document Service. Highlight the words I look up in the dictionary and when I want to import the words, copy the "My Clippings.txt" and filter it with regex.<br><br>I then create cards from the words on the text files en masse with Epwing2Anki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting.<br>This is the first time I even hear about that.</br></br>  <br>It's a bit of a rare use for the passive voice.</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty good idea. I just figured all mined cards should go into the same deck and be studied at the same time, but separating them sounds better.<br><br><br>I'll save this for future use, thank you. Also when you say 'done reading' do you mean you import after every chapter or volume or what? I'm guessing it'd be better to import after every chapter so the word is still somewhat fresh when reviewing.</br></br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1535<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1534: </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>friday 12:00am 4chan time (est)</br>  <br>6 hours and 50 minutes from now.</br>  <br><br>Ah, thank you very much anons.</br></br>  <br>EST here, it's usually 7:00AM, but who knows, I don't start these.</br>  <br>Blame tharja-fag</br>  What hit you harder, the ending to Gunbuster or EoE?  <br> saviors took so long the earth had to be saved again before they got back </br>  <br>to be fair, their entire journey back was going to take as long as human civilization had been around.</br>  <br>Humanity did it to themselves because they forgot about all the tech they threw out into the universe to prevent things from happening again.</br>  <br>EoE I guess, even though I don't care for it, because Gunbuster was spoiled for me</br>  <br>Just spoil my shit.</br>  Alright so I just finished this.<br>Am I supposed to be OK with the ending or is it something universally considered bad?</br>  <br> muh 2deep4u waifu <br><br>sometimes I forget it's already summer</br></br></br>  <br>What state did Madoka live before coming back to Japan.</br>  <br>Then it's a trick question.
