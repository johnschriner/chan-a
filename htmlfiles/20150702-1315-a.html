[ Reminder.<br><br>Asa-nee likes hanging out with porn stars.</br></br>  <br>Anyone to get her drunk as hell and pound it</br>  <br><br>And have sex with then.</br></br>  <br>Does she do hentai then? Because then they'd be colleagues.</br>  <br>only the best</br>  <br>Name of the actress?</br>  <br> Rei Mitsuna</br>  <br>Posting the qtest</br>  <br>You posted the wrong seiyuu.</br>  <br>How much dick do you think seiyuu get in secret?<br><br>It's not like there's a hymen check before each concert.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm rewatching simoun. it's fucking amazing. 19yo kitaeri lezzing out pretty hard within first 5 minutes</br>    <br>She's actually done quite a lot of hentai, just under pseudonyms. Someone once linked a Nip site that matches hentai pseudonyms with the actual actress so you can see what porn they've done, but I lost it when I accidentally my bookmarks a while back. Anyone know the site I'm talking about?<br><br><br>Also goes by Rei Mizuna apparently, probably both pseudonyms too.<br><br><br>She always looks like one of the kids of well-off Asian immigrants I went to HS/college with, liberal but well-done makeup, busy but cute clothing, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to think that Amamiya Sora did. She just came out of nowhere last year with all these leading roles.</br>  <br>That JAV actress has modelled for that Eva clothing line.</br>  <br>She did and it's pretty good</br>  <br>She's cute</br>  She also likes it in the ass.<br>Her ex-husband confirmed it.</br>  <br>Why'd they break up?</br>  So, how's Yukarin? Has she found a man yet?  <br>I've never seen sauce on this but for some reason it makes sense.</br>  <br>she's going to commit sudoku this year</br>  <br>Yuu-nee will fuck anything</br>  <br>She's an alcoholic</br>  <br><br>Hope not, then we'll never get a Muromi S2.</br></br>  <br>Well that's depressing. And he's no good either for not supporting her. Boo!</br>  <br>Either alcoholics or chainsmokers, why are Japs so disgusting.</br>  <br>If her voice wasnt sexy enough for VA work would she have gone into JAV instead?</br>    <br>Japan life is suffering</br>  Ayaneru is my waifu  <br>She's gay</br>  A CUTE.  Number one cute christmas cake seiyuu coming through!  <br>I like it when she makes faces.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>    <br> Someone once linked a Nip site that matches hentai pseudonyms with the actual actress so you can see what porn they've done <br>I know which one you're talking about. Don't remember the name either.</br></br>  <br>Why use Noire instead of Tsubaki here?</br>  <br>Because Imai-san, you retard.</br>  <br>good thing I'm a little girl.</br>  <br>But she voices Tsubaki too!<br><br> Unless here's some meta joke I'm not aware of. </br></br></br>  <br>I want to burry my face between Asakawa's asakawas.</br>  <br>Oh that Tsubaki. No one actually cares about BlazBlue.</br>  <br> Asa-nee likes hanging out with porn stars. <br><br>I'm always impressed at how much Rei doesn't look like a porn star, also all the crazy shit she does.</br></br></br>  <br>Mimorin is adorable</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't tell those two are different people. I guess all asians just look the same.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Is this it, I had it bookmarked from ages back.<br><br>http://gph.sakura.ne.jp/va_memo/sys<wbr>tem/vadb.cgi</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>    <br>Thanks. You can have this in return.</br>  <br>Looks like it, many thanks</br>  <br>Because Nep threads.</br>  Japanese 3D women can't look good without eye make up, why is that?  <br>Sounds pretty normal for 3D</br>  <br> What do you mean christmas cak- <br><br>Oh shit she's 29 already about to turn 30 this month. She still is beautiful as ever doe.</br></br></br>  <br>I love Imai! She is cute! CUTE!</br>  <br>Nah there are some qt westerners that look good even without make up</br>  I still ship her with Sugita  Does /a/ like Minami Tanaka?  <br>All WUGs are love.</br>  <br>Imai's not my favorite seiyuu, but I've never heard her voice anything I don't like, seen antics from her that weren't adorable, or read an interview with her that didn't amuse.<br><br>So she's not my favorite, but she should be.</br></br></br>  I need more Sora in my life  <br>Her voice was kind of generic, nothing made it stick out in particular but she wasn't bad. I think she's more suited to supporting characters than main.</br>  <br>She turned 29 the other day. 30 is next year friendo</br>  <br>That event was so amazing to watch. I really want to attend one in person some day.</br>    I don't really care about Seiyuus but is it true that they have to pretend to be pure and act like virgins if they don't want their fans to burn all their CDs or shows they've work in?  <br>Some. Depends on the higher-ups' decision.</br>  <br>Varies on the type of seiyuu. Some are more focused on their voice rather than idol focused.</br>  <br>I'm guessing seiyuus that work on idol or harem shows are the ones pretending to be virginal airheads</br>  <br>Based Yuu <br><br>Also<br> Turned moot down on twitter <br>I will never not find this funny</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The question is though, do you think she knew who moot was?</br>  Remember<br><br>Pray For Yukarin<br><br>God help us if Nana ever gets married.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>That little bite right there is about 200 calories.

If you don't think too hard about it.  <br>It was GREAT!</br>  It was pretty good and I think Bones and JC Staff did the best this season.  <br>That Gainax car commercial was very good too</br>  <br><br>Yamaha commercial was best though</br></br>  <br>It was surprisingly good.</br>  OTP  <br>It ain't an SB69 thread without you, OTP-anon.</br>  <br>It was fun.</br>  Was ok then it went full fujoshit.  <br>Subaru was truly subarashii.</br>  <br>Fuck you, I've never seen characters carry a show as hard as the shingans did.</br>  <br>explain how?</br>  <br>Imagine k-on that turns into free half way.</br>  <br>but it didn't, tho. shingan were prevalent but nothing they did was fujo fuel? aside from praising rom, but c'mon. <br><br>he works a full time fuckin job</br></br></br>  <br>Still have a couple more sameposting anons to wait for too.</br>  <br>Does anyone have the 'His feelings for me increased' screencap?</br>  <br>I have this while you wait.</br>  <br>well... this happened. but the rest of shingan are straight. rom just has it out for boypussy</br>  Nah, they made Cyan one of the worst MC in this season.

Hibike<br>Sidonia<br>Can't decide on the third one yet</br></br>  1) Hibikek<br><br>Didn't watch anything else.</br></br>  Sidonia<br>Kuroko no Basuke<br>Hibike!</br></br>  Kekkai<br>Ore Monogatari<br>Hibike/Shokugeki joint third</br></br>  Hibike is tops<br><br>That last episode is a masterpiece</br></br>  <br>Band Nerds; The Anime has been my favorite so far.

As a member blackmailed into joining by Ayame, Tanukichi ends up taking part in obscene acts of terrorism against the talented student council president Anna Nishikinomiya, whom Tanukichi has a crush on.  <br> Masterpiece <br>They have one. It's called Utena.</br></br>  <br><br>The J.C.

People seem to give 10's Willy nilly and I think that it lowers the value of a rating. I think I kinda phrased it wrong so my bad. There can be very minor mistakes in a 10 but they have no effect on the final product so if they were corrected then they the score would still stay the same.<br><br>Ratings are subjective as well, a 5 to me is not the same as a 5 to you.</br></br></br>  <br>Kyoani should make a 2d ayano takeda</br>  <br>No. I fell in love with Kumiko.

That's why I assumed that Sasuke deliberately stays away from home in order to avoid the Uchiha curse. That would've made a lot more sense.

It makes the Gaiden feel like a shallow ode to how great Sasuke is. <br><br>Agreed. But if there is a small timeskip up to Sarada's graduation, then perhaps Sauce have had enough time to reconcile with Salad and be a proper parent for a short amount of time. At least this seems to be the most reasonable way to rescue their relationship at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>The keyword here is desirable.<br><br>You Narutards are literally the Sonic and MLP of anime.<br><br>We dont want this garbage on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, it's been 12 fucking years. A few months of Sauce being a decent human being isn't enough to cover for that.</br>  <br><br>Accept it. I've told you so, but you didn't listen.</br></br>  <br>I do and I've been here for years.</br>  <br><br>Of course, but that would at least explain why Salad and Sauce have a relationship AT ALL at the end of the gaiden.</br></br>  <br>There's no basis to believe that Sakura is Sarada's biological mother<br><br>If Sakura gave birth to Sarada Naruto would've just come out and said it. The fact that he was willing to believe it means he can't confirm that Sakura has ever been pregnant</br></br></br>  <br><br> I've told you so <br><br>Everybody at some point knew Sakura was going to be the biological mom, they just gave Kishi the benefit of the doubt. You're not special.

Go back to your KanColle thread and leave us alone.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>  inb4 /a/ then comes to /nrt/ and tells us to stop talking about Naruto on our own board and starts One Piece, Fate and DBZ threads on it. </br></br></br>  <br> Only villain without a hapy ending is Madara <br><br>Fuck this shitty garbage</br></br></br>  <br>Kancolle is not even popular.<br><br>You're stupid.</br></br></br>  dubs  <br><br>You're arguing with in-universe logic. In order to figure out that Karin cannot be Salad's mom, you have to look at it from a storytelling perspective. I explained this a lot of times already but some people just didn't want to listen. <br><br><br><br>The damage control is already starting. Getting nervous?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rai does give accurate descriptions of the pages. His only problem is that he can't read moon. He's also an SSfag while Evil isn't.<br><br>He might not know for certain and is just guessing based on how things appear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll admit that I wanted Karin to be the mom, but Sakura was always the most likely candidate. <br><br>But SS was put through the wringer for no good reason and ended up worse than when they started. And that's good enough for me.<br><br>Waiting on the movie now, albeit with slightly less anticipation.</br></br></br></br></br>  last thread got deleted<br><br>what's going on i only go on /a/ for naruto and some other shit</br></br>  <br>Sugoi</br>      <br>Rai just posted this<br><br> I think Evil's spoilers are legit minus the who was the mother thing. </br></br></br>  <br> you have to look at it from a storytelling perspective <br><br>Yeah, the moral of the story is that it doesn't matter that Sakura isn't Sarada's biological mother since Sakura is the one that raised her</br></br></br>  <br>Hypocrite janitors and buttmad shitposters. Ignore and keep making threads.</br>  <br>Sweet</br>  <br>Hello welcome to /a/.</br>  <br>The wrong people have rights here and use their corrupt power to delete Naruto threads for fun</br>  So Sakura is the biological mother? Then why the fuck all that "strong bonds beyond genetics" speech? I'm kinda dissapointed  <br> I only go on /a/ for naruto <br> the only people posting about naruto are oldfags I swear! <br><br>Check these dubs, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet it has an ongoing thread every fucking day. It wasn't even an anime to start with, it was a shitty browser game. KanColle should fuck off to /jp/, where it belongs.</br>  <br><br> so new they don't remember naruto thread were not welcome here before the ending last year </br></br>    <br>Fuck if I know. It's Kishi. If this was all some setup so Salad could want to become Hokage, there were better ways of doing it.</br>  <br> /a/ is one person </br>  <br><br> Getting nervous? <br><br>I don't give a fuck anymore. I'm just tired of you posting in every thread like you knew before anyone else. You're the one who's most invested in this shit it seems, which makes me think you're an SSfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>I agree.</br>   People getting baited by someone who can't read japanese <br><br>Seriously?</br></br>  how long until coolest guy deletes this thread?  <br><br>That lesson was already taught when Salad believed that Sakura wasn't her real mom. <br><br>The reason Karin cannot possibly be the real mom is because of that DNA test thingy. If Kishi wanted to reveal the actual truth back then, he would've had Karin there to explain everything and we would've gotten a flashback. The fact that Kishi decided to reveal that information in a less straightforward way showed that he was hiding something. Furthermore, Naruto insisted to talk about everything later. This implies that there is still a twist coming. Otherwise, there would be no reason to postpone the conversation. I said this many times. The DNA test chapter 100% confirmed that Karin isn't the mom.</br></br></br></br>  What upcoming summer anime do you look forward to the most?  <br>Nice dubs.<br><br><br>Nice trips.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're one person with trips. Checked.<br><br>Based mods do your work and delete the thread please.</br></br></br>  <br> rin </br>  <br><br>Great, so we're right back to where we started.</br></br>  <br>Naruto is, was and always will be welcome here as long as this board is called /a/ - anime and manga you stupid fucking cunt. <br>Those buttblasted corrupt mods and muh board culture maymay is the problem here, and we have that problem for a long time now.</br></br>  <br>It's an anime and manga board. So again, hypocritical janitors and buttmad shitposters such as yourself.</br>  Saged harder than a Narutard thread.<br>Oh wait</br>  <br>You know which one.</br>  <br>Hopefully Charlotte is good.

The anime sold 7K and the manga got a good boost.</br>  <br><br>Not watched the anime, but the manga is pretty good.</br></br>  I think this is the first thread I have seen in months and I bet it won't even reach the bump limit.<br><br>Forgettable show is forgettable.</br></br>  <br>Its because lots of faggots love watching mediocre trash and rarely love talking about actual good shows.</br>  This is supposed to be satire right?<br><br>The Japanese don't actually think their "ONE MIRRION TIMES FOLDED STEEL" is actually impressive do they?<br><br>Also GATES thread I guess</br></br></br></br>  everyone's in love with their own stink   folded 1000 times <br>Barely fit to cut bread with.</br>  <br>I wish I could drop this shit over 1000 times. This is going to be a long season.</br>  <br>Well I mean for the shit tier material they had to work with, I think they did a pretty good job.</br>  <br>Well I figure this one was made with modern materials and techniques.</br>  <br>Has anyone every taken actually good metal and done the same process?<br>Like I want a comparison between Japanese steel folded 1000 times over, and what is considered top tier metal folded 1000 times over.</br></br>  the elevens take their magic swords very seriously  <br>I guess it'd just be 'diminishing returns' since I doubt top tier steel would have many impurities that would have to be folded out.</br>  <br>Good metal doesn't need to be folded. Removing too much carbon would make the metal too flexible and thus ruin it.</br>  <br>Flexible might be the wrong word. Pliable may have been the word I was looking for.</br>  <br><br><br>Yes,yes Japan has been folding steel for swords since 1000 CE and they also learned the technique from the Chinese.<br><br>Western swordsmiths started folded 700 BCE and perfected it before 1000 CE (Ulfberht).<br><br>So yes lets give the japs a round of applause for being the fat kid at the end of the race.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Katanas have rather thick cross-sections and as such have to push aside more metal to get to the squishy bits, making them worse at penetrating armor.<br><br>The folding technique is to divide the carbon equally through the metal of the blade; otherwise you end up with metal that's got impurities all over the place. Japanese iron ore is traditionally rather shitty with its carbon content, so if they didn't do this the katana would not even meet the minimal durability requirements of a practical weapon. This means the folding technique is a necessary bother rather than some kind of super special awesome secret upgrade. Incidentally, while it is true that Japanese swordsmiths started folding around 1000 CE—having learned the technique from the Chinese—the Celts had been doing it since 700 BCE, two millennia earlier. The Vikings had mastered this technique as well, having allegedly learned it from various Central Asian civilizations, which eventually culminated in the creation of the exquisite Ulfberht. By around 1000 CE, Europeans no longer bothered with it, due to improved steel quality, knowledge of metallurgy (importantly how to remove impurities), and the use of the blast furnace which allowed production of large batches of steel.<br><br>In other words, katana wa shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And do you think with the shit tier original material they got, A-1 will be able to make a good anime out of GATE?</br>  <br> The Japanese don't actually think their "ONE MIRRION TIMES FOLDED STEEL" is actually impressive do they? <br>actually their method of folding iron produced an "almost steel like" material, basically they beat all the carbon out of the metal long before any industrial process in Europe invented "steel" <br><br>so for a time, yes, the 1000 times folded Japanese sword was technologically superior to pretty much every other iron weapon out there. however, once steel manufacturing became commonplace, the Japanese sword no longer was unique or even all that impressive. in fact, structurally speaking if you make a steel long sword, and a steel katana, the longsword will cut the katana in half due to the design differences (European weapons needed to be strong enough to cut through steel plates and steel mail, something you don't really have to fight against in japan)</br></br></br></br>  Baka gaijin  <br>The two posts above just explained that western swordsmiths did that technique over 1000 years ahead perfected it and moved onto improving metallurgy. So quit your bullshit anon.</br>  <br>why do you believe one post but not the other? just becauyse it's first?<br><br> the viking mastered the technique, learned it from central asia <br>doesn't this strike you as bullshit as fuck, anon?<br><br>I mean nobody is providing any sources, so what the fuck are you gonna do.<br><br>Here, I'll proclaim that the Egyptians mastered folding steel 5000 BCE and I've provided just as much proof as anybody else in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Steel was in use in Europe as early as the 7th century BC, and in widespread use by the 3rd century BC.<br>Jomon culture was dominant at the time in Japan.<br><br>You are so wrong I am angry.</br></br></br></br>  GATES is literally USA USA USA but for japs  <br>The Japs learned from the Chinks, the Celts didn't.</br>  <br>So obviously Clapistanis hate it, and since the rest of the world hates USA USA USA they hate it too. Only actual weeaboos like Gate.</br>  <br>Anon, the answer to your question came to me in a dream, The nips are proud of their steel for its symbology, each fold represents a time the US bent them over and fucked them during ww2</br>  <br>Why are you so mad over this?</br>  <br>Can't i like gate for my fantasies of having a couple of squads of spess marines fucking up a slaan empire?</br>  <br>they dont deserve to be happy though</br>  <br>There's like two chapters of that so far though, which is why everyone dropped it.</br>  Aw yeah, type 10  <br><br>Well, it sounds pretty cool. <br><br>Still prefer western swords though.</br></br></br></br>  So I see anime tout Katana as a weapon of speed, rather than strength and durability.<br><br>Any western sword out there that was made for quick strikes?</br></br>  The best Japanese swords were made from Swedish steel. Japanese steel was poor quality shit made from poor quality ore by a poor quality process.  <br>Close call between an épée and a rapier.</br>  <br> Any western sword out there that was made for quick strikes? <br>Shamshir, sabre, scimitar, cutlass - there's many. Actually they more common than heavy swords through all of mankind history.</br></br>  <br>Are you listing Fast-Very Fast swords from Diablo 2?</br>  What are you reading, /a/? now that shieldbro has been fully translated, minus the Do Over of Spearhero, i've been having fun tracking down unusual stuff and reading it even if I have to do it through google.<br><br>Following through awesome people that is translating them:<br>* RE:Monster<br>* Risou No Himo Seikatsu (which btw I am also checking through G.
