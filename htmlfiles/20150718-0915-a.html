Why doesn't it get any attention on /a/?  See you in 3 arcs  <br>It switches gears party way through. Turns from a great comedy manga into a decent action manga. And then into a pretty crappy action manga. Fuck the Future Arc man, that shit ruined everything.</br>  <br> This show is fucking amazing <br>A he he he</br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, pokemon ripoff-future arc made me drop the manga instantly.</br>    <br>This show had some god tier OP/ED and the ost was nice too. I also liked some of the character designs too.<br><br><br> a great comedy <br>That shit was awful and you know it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's shit.<br>Also you need to lurk more before you even think of posting.</br></br>  <br> Future arc is bad <br>what the fuck anon? the future arc was pretty cool and it flowed together well. everything after the final battle sucked ass though. I thoroughly enjoyed Reborn but it should've gotten a decent conclusion.</br></br>  <br> That shit was awful and you know it. <br>I thought it was fun. I don't know how the anime turned out but the manga was very enjoyable.<br><br><br>Future arc was awful to the point where I just couldn't give a single shit anymore. The main antagonist was absolute shit and those boxes were shit too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Tsuna is best Sky and best  girl <br><br>So, /a/, what would your flame type be? I fancy myself a Cloud.</br></br>  <br> The main antagonist was absolute shit <br>He honestly got better after the Ring Succession arc.<br> shit <br>thanks for all those reasons why you disagree anon</br></br></br></br>  I'm a die hard fan of the series but even I can admit it had a lot of problems. The comedy was really cheesy at first. Kokuyo Arc was gear shift into a more serious shounen, then it lightened just a bit with Varia Arc. The future arc was okay but it got boring after awhile, the Shimon were unnecessary (I wish they brought back other characters/ filled in plotholes than make another "7 new people, 7 new flames, new drama BS" and that dragged into the weird Daemon Spade + Elena drama, and then finally the Arcobaleno got their coverage.<br><br>But even then it was loaded with plot holes and the same "Oh no this character is too strong! Surprise, a new character is even stronger!" Previous powerful characters got nerfed to hell the ending didn't give fans the closure they wanted.<br><br>If the series got a reboot/retelling I'd be absolutely happy.<br><br><br>Lightning all the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Too bad this was a forced cancellation.  <br>It's shit.<br>I remember my younger self lusting after Mukuro, so I looked up on the wiki what episodes he appeared in, and watched them all. Then I never watched it again.<br>Dark times. But at least watching that shit enabled me to understand what was going on in Yoneda Kou's doujins.</br></br></br>  <br>Sun has objectively the best attribute</br>  I don't know how it was doing before the Kokuyo arc, but you can tell they told the author to get it together and make it more shonen. <br><br>I for one think the Flame system could have been handled well without disolving into DBZ tier fights.</br></br>  Yamamoto is the only remotely interesting character who isn't a talking baby.  <br>I wished they woulve animated the last 2 arcs</br>  <br> This show is fucking amazing. <br>HAHAHAHAHA</br></br>  <br>He kinda got sidelined after  obtaining the Vongola Gear <br><br>Shame since he is my favorite Rain</br></br></br>  <br>to many filler arcs and recap episodes</br>  <br> the future arc was pretty cool and it flowed together well. <br>There is literally nobody who had this opinion.<br><br>Future arc starts decent and then goes into power up bullshit way way too hard. It's full of plot points that don't get expanded on and it is too fucking long. I think even the mangaka realized how long it was because they start rushing through boss battles like crazy.<br><br>I'd also note nobody even seems to talk about the manga past the Future arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show was shit and you know it<br>It was bad as a comedy and terrible as a serious show<br> Haha we just beat the 7 funeral wreaths! <br> No, you beat the fake 7 funeral wreaths. Now you have to fight the REAL 7 funeral wreaths :^) <br>Lurk more you turbo faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Oh no this character is too strong! Surprise, a new character is even stronger!" <br>I remember this being pulled after the Future arc was such crap.<br><br>They have powers from the FUCKING FUTURE and there are stronger guys. Like what the shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you could always count on her to ignore anyone who might do something if there was another chance for Hibari to be indifferent.</br>  <br><br>This exactly. Amano went on to focus on Psych-Pass and elDLIVE and It's a total bummer because I feel like the series could still be worth salvaging into something good.<br><br>This too. I was looking forward to the flames being explored in more depth and it never happened. Also in depth Arcobaleno coverage. I'm still salty over the fact that my favorite characters got no coverage.<br><br>On a plus side, they're still making new merchandise of the series, so maybe it isn't entirely dead yet. Too bad it's just of Reborn, Tsuna, and ultimate mary sue  hibari .<br><br>That's because Future Arc rolled immediately into a plot hole filled Shimon arc. The last arc for me was the best arc because we finally got some coverage on shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This reveal was hype as shit and you know it.<br><br>What exact plot holes? I for one found the evolution of everyone's strength to be very understandable and it didn't go too fast for me at least.</br></br></br>  <br> This reveal was hype as shit and you know it. <br>No. No it was not. <br><br>Nobody ever said "There are more funeral wreaths and the ones they've been fighting for like a year are fake? WHAT A GENIUS TWIST!"</br></br></br></br>  This show was cool when I was 16.  I honestly forgot this was a thing that existed and was popular  I dropped it after about 12 volumes but Lambo made me laugh so fucking much. It was so childish but I don't care.<br> I only pretended to pee my pants </br>  <br> manga  <br>Oh silly me, I didn't see that. The anime made the comedy unbearable at times. I remember skipping episodes because of how bad they were.<br><br><br>I also forgot to mention this series had the best waifus. If you'd ask, "Who was the best girl?" the only anwser would be all of them. I seriously can't think of one bad girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haru and Kyoko did nothing worthy, and neither did Chrome after a while</br>  <br>Didn't make them bad girls though. I honestly loved the fact that even though Haru and Kyoko did not fight/ were civilians in the entire series, they put up with the bullshit going on.<br><br>Chrome continued to be a bigger disappointment as the series went on. I really, really wanted to like her, but she was just constantly needing help until she finally found her own resolve. I was happy M.M. bitch slapped her when no one else would. Honestly as much as people hated her, M.M. could've been really amazing if Amano cared more about her female characters.<br><br>  Oregano   deserved more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haru and Kyoko did nothing worthy <br>Best girls don't need to do anything. Also.<br><br> shounen women <br> doing anything worthy </br></br></br></br></br>  why does the khr fanbase give tsuna's dad so much hate? dude was alpha in the final arc  I watched the whole anime and I was very disappointed at the end. The beginning was good, I loved the arch of the fights for the rings, but the future arch is so goddamn slow and boring. Plus, the characters at the end are pretty annoying, with "the thing" each one has to spam and repeat every bloody second they are in screen.  It was shit.<br><br> I always did like the idea of using dynamite as a primary weapon though. </br></br>  <br>He was a terrible father and Nana was a terrible mother. They both pretty much gave up on their one son and let Reborn raise him. I know Tsuna sucked in the beginning/was a brat but he was a stupid teenage kid. Nana just criticized him constantly and Iemitsu was never around (I know he was working, but when he did come home he never reached out to his son. He just drank and slept.)<br><br>Plus punching your child in the face is not going to leave a good impression on people. Yes, it was a fight and all was fair in it, but most of the fans saw that and went "wow what a dick."<br><br>Yamamoto's dad and Shamal were better dads</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shamal <br>This is a reach</br></br>  Lewdness level?  <br>MAXIMUM</br>  Why was such a design wasted on a irrelevant character.<br><br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>best girl she needs to appear more.</br>  <br>That's not lewd its Slutty</br>  Shameless.

It's a shame for some of these to not be main characters of their own series.  So does Erina already know that Saiba guy is Soma's father? Will she stop being a cunt towards him if she finds out or will she just straight up deny it.    <br>No, remember Souma has a different surname. He's Yukihira, while she knew Jouichirou as Saiba.</br>  <br>Go read the manga.
