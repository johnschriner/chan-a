NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Draw it good and post that shit, my Monstergirl folder could always use more pics.</br>  If I worked in a grade school full of Monster girls, all I'd do is tell dad tier jokes.

Not worth my time.</br></br></br>  this is my fave monster girl  Why does Japan routinely punish the tomboy?<br><br>She never wins.</br></br>  <br>nhentai has some and there was also that big torrent that followed shortly after. You are better off going directly to the translation groups if they haven't already been shut down (iirc, LWB was lost to us).</br>  <br>panda.chaika.moe<br><br>there's also a google doc somewhere that lists it at least, too</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Well never mind I guess.</br></br></br></br>      Read the guide<br>http://buyfag.moe</br>  <br>You gonna get Metabee too?</br>  <br> buying toys <br>Do you still play with legos too?</br></br>  <br>Original character</br>  <br>http://www11.ocn.ne.jp/~tokitama/CC<wbr>P015.html<br>Please join our cult.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Nope, I don't like Beta-san.

Goddamn this shit was leagues below fate zero.<br>I actually forced myself to watch it till the end.<br>Fucking damn it, what a disappointment. Also, that pathetic excuse of an OST. They didn't even try.</br></br>  <br>I'm addicted to shitposting</br>  <br>I read Tuskihime and really I didn't find it that enjoyable. Most of the interesting world building that's in Fate or Melty Blood really isn't there yet, and frankly I was just bored in many routes. Seriously, how many times I read to read about Hisui waking Shiki up drove me insane, not to mention at the beginning of most routes you're literally just there waiting for Shiki to go do something interesting, instead we have to play the "I gotta pretend that these supernatural events never happened" game for awhile.<br><br>Not to say it didn't have it's good points, I liked most the battle scenes in the Near Side route were pretty neat.</br></br></br>  <br>Arc's route is shit, Ciel's route is enjoyable only if you read it before Arc's since they are so similar, the other three are good, but start off really slow like the Akiha one having a crapton of nothing happens school days.</br>  <br><br> dat pose <br><br>bueno</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime is very overrated. It boggles my mind how it keeps getting that much praise. Chaos;Head is the same as well.</br>   2014 <br> Every wikia says she is 165cm <br><br> Now <br> Every wikia says she is 168 <br><br>Did something changed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there an actual project translating the novels?<br><br>Also monster girls when?<br><br>How can the racist Japanese ideology allow monster girls live and work inside society without being victims of discrimination?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, fuck off. Yes, its bad.</br>  <br>Yeah they were in the infirmary together and she kept on feeling guilty that she out of battle instinct attacked an ally. So in turn they had a long recovery together.</br>  <br>I'm sorry but I got bills to pay and I really can't really afford commissions</br>  <br>I don't remember /a/ drawfags charging anyone.</br>  The anime fucking ruined shino. She was to be the tough bulky chick but had sex appeal, butt not some moe tiny shit. They at best couldve kept that as making the way rory is now. Though shes a gothic loli she can go whatever she likes.  Hey /a/, can you watch my Ryuuko for me? I'll be right back.  <br>Don't trust Satsuki, her mother, or Nui.<br><br>Rude.<br><br>Lewd.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does she like hugs? Or will she bite me and yell at me?  <br> her mother <br>We can't trust Raygo? But she's owns a major company! If we can't trust capitalism, who can we trust?</br></br>  <br> Does she like hugs? Or will she bite me and yell at me? <br>I think pic related is what will happen.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a rainbow that thinks wherever she goes she must also rape.</br></br></br></br>  Oops   tfw you're waifu loves the son of God more than you   <br>It isn't, much less liking cocks.</br>  <br>Loki goes to the God meet in a dress in ep 2 or 3.</br>  <br> bestia <br>Illa non est bestia, fungum. Ipsa comoedia relevium.<br><br> demigod <br>No.<br><br> a new golden age of legends <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> original mythology <br>Which this show throws out the window anyway.</br></br>   tfw you're waifu doesn't know of even your semi-existence   Why do we hate her again?  <br>Pretty much my whole argument is that you will be judged on more than just your actions. Actions don't occur in isolation.</br>   Enjoy a show <br> Threads are cancer or dead. <br>Every time.</br></br>  <br><br>I would call it a lecture considering she made him aware she knew about everything he did then essentially said he was abusing his powers. She basically said that how he was using his powers was abuse all the while using her own powers to spy on him then using them to beat the shit out of him. She is just a straight up hypocrite pretending to be a good guy because she has some noble goal or something.</br></br>  <br> I don't know where the fuck anyone on /a/ is getting this moralfagging bullshit <br><br>People pay more attention to the pretty colors and panties than the dialogue, it's nothing new.</br></br></br>  <br> B-but no one was actually hurt! <br>You're probably worse than Yu is. At least he doesn't bother to make excuses for what he does. <br><br>There is no absolute right and wrong like you seem to be implying. Yu is just a jerk.</br></br></br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>Kirito/Asuna/Lisbeth is a better threesome option</br>  <br> Make Kirito into traprito the entire time <br>Read the LN you secondary.<br><br>Then I was gripped by a sudden foreboding and realized what<br>Kayaba’s present, the &lt;hand mirror&gt;, meant.<br>I raised the mirror in a rush, and the face staring back at me.<br>Black hair that lay neatly over the head, two weak looking eyes<br>that could be seen beneath the slightly long hair, and a delicate face<br>that made people mistake me for a girl even now when I go out in<br>casual clothes with my sister.<br>The calm face of a warrior that &lt;Kirito&gt; had had even a few<br>seconds ago was no longer there. The face that was in the mirror—<br>Was my actual face that I had tried so hard to escape from.<br>“Ah…it’s me…” <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127739356#p127758817">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fuck off, hash gives nothing either</br>  <br>so kirito was a trap the whole time? why does he make a big deal about being girlier when he was girly in the first place and it wouldn't make much of a difference?</br>  <br><br>so was that guy like a real NSA spook?</br></br>  What the fuck did I just watch?  <br>I deleted my post because I didn't reply to yours, sorry.</br>    <br>I've made steaks with her, but not that many times.<br><br><br>Oh right,  swapping food with kisses.<br><br><br>But you did.</br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  I don't think Apple liked my psychological analysis that exposed his secret fetish.  <br>mistakes or made steaks? ;)</br></blockquote>]
