I would like to see a crossover of Kuuko getting molested by Twoearle who mistakes her Tail Red, and Kuuko unsuccessfully trying to block her because she wants Nyaruko instead.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178379  I plan to once I can actually draw something passable.   Requesting Eleonora wearing the Zipper One Piece on the right  Requesting Houki wearing tailgear.  OR here for the Kirika request, I couldn't have asked for anything better! I was away for a few days, but I caught it on the archive. Many thanks to Boa for picking it up!  (P.S.- is Kirikafag supposed to be me, or another person on this board? I only requested this twice.)     seconding this, but mostly because I like girls in fuck me heels   Sorry to ask but is it possible to see a WIP of the twintail fusion?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178695  what does this crew do?

Sorry for the late reply, I just woke up, but "MUH DUCK" this is perfect and bonus points for the embarrassed expression, thank you Audere.  Maybe one day armor version aswell? Sorry for sounding greedy     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178379  what is one supposed to do when one is in the crew?   Requesting Orihime at a cook off with shitty food, like an ice cream tomato sandwich, either  a) celebrating a participation ribbon or  b)wearing only and apron and panties and getting first place in a cook off despite her shitty food.       Not until now, but he did just as an amazing job as Boa did!   Nope.      Warmly waiting.  I would once again like to thank you all for indulging this dirty and sinful knight on this fateful day. Though I am only a hollow construct, made only to serve in the name of his King, a filthy blasphemer like myself feels truly loved here in the hall of you comrades. It is only right that I express my thanks one more time. Accept my sincere thanks and know that I feel truly at peace along side you all. Thank you for showing my my King today, I am an undeserving mongrel.    this dirty and sinful    filthy blasphemer  Huh? I don't remember that much self-deprecation in WoL's posts.      is this a one thread thing or are you back for real?    OR here. Thanks, it looks awesome.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179279   but if someone goes for it I can offer one of the several full-length live-action WAM (Wet and Messy) gunge dunk tank videos I have from DunkTankBabes.  Oh no, another one.     cool, then i'll finish it.    I fall deeper and deeper into the spiral of depravity. As more Sabers are revealed, so too is my sick nature.   I never leave, this is my home and I always return sooner or later. One thing must be dealt with first.  My backlog is massive, I only saw three shows this season.        That's why you don't take 4chan off 4chan.     As more Sabers are revealed, so too is my sick nature.  And people called me crazy. Slut.       My backlog is massive, I only saw three shows this season.  I hear that    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179279  Cry harder, dunkfag. In the end, he's still in the right.   Requesting colouring of this: http://a.uguu.se/odagst.png   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179279  <a href="https://sys.4chan.org/a/imgboard.php?mode=report&amp;no=127179279" target="_blank">https://sys.4chan.org/a/imgboard.ph<wbr>p?mode=report&amp;no=127179279</wbr></a>     wouldn't it make more sense to post the picture you want colored and link the color ref and not the other way around?      If you're still there, I can colour it for you. I hope you like it.     All Sabers make me lust, there is not a single terrible one in the bunch. Under my master's heel is where I belong but as I am but a man, my soul harbors dirty feelings for those similar in style and class as my Lord.   I only stayed up to date with UBW, Seraph of the End, and Danmachi. I need to catch up to Gunslinger Stratos, Yamada, Kekkai Sensen, Gintama, and that is just this season. All I finished last were Ange and Aldnoah.  Also Kamen Rider Drive.        I guess it would, yeah.    I was watching Show by rock but I got distracted.  WOL a qt come to streams sometime      You're welcome to your opinion.   Offering that because I'm assuming someone who draws it would have at least a passing interest in the fetish. If they want something else unrelated instead I can always go hunting.        Or you can end your own worthless life and do everybody a favor.    Really who is this guy?    fyi, im not sure if you picked up on it yet, but dunk tank requests arent exactly welcomed with open arms here    /shitposting/ came to shit on the subhuman and the thread while they're at it  Oh well, too much /a/ for today anyway.    The subhuman deserves to get shit on though.    That he does.    Nice to see you again, WoL!    It feels nice to know I was remembered, even being the repulsive and hollow knight that I am. I feel such warmth in my heart today, that smile on her face look fantastic. A fire has been lit in my chest and my heart beats like a herd of bulls. Accept my thanks for not only showing me such a caring look at my King but also for being my dear comrade.    Have you ever heard of Etotama and Pleiades?    cute  but yamato looks like some sort of landwhale    Out of curiosity, some long ass time ago there was an attempt to make a tarot set for /a/. Did that ever get finished?        Damn, is this the legendary A+ Charisma. This is beyond popular, this is a curse.         pretty sure its been dropped.    I saw the Pleiades ova and I had the show in my backlog. Truly my backlog is massive and I must take care of it before I do anything else.    Aww    I thought almost all the tarots were finished?   Requesting an older version of the blonde girl on the the left. Keep the same witch costume.  her hair similar like the blue girls hair on the right and chest size maybe bigger like D-F cup range with the same white stockings and shoes (can be red to match.)     Is there a tag on the booru?    yup its  tagme      requesting puffy vulva, thats all.   Damn nice work  (not OR)      You're one weird mother fucker, you know that?   Requesting a cute and tired/sleeping Sawyer hugging a pillow.  http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=126571 http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1390424 http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2433374  She can be wearing just her underwear and a shirt, or a pyjamas, etc.   Could be hugging a teddybear or other stuffed animal instead.    </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>     done    http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=list&amp;tags=tarot%2A  ?  </wbr>    I am a dirty knight that deserves to be punished. Truly I am part of the shameful aspect of humankind, only the light of my King is enough to keep me sane.    No you don't, you fuck!    Thank you very much. I guess I'll colour it, I kinda liked it too.   Requesting Luvia in a dress similar to Isis's.   cute    I stopped requesting after I got the one I wanted.   Requesting a loli drinking apple juice straight from the jug. No specific details, make look however you want as long as its cute. I'd greatly appreciate it!       Really?      Figured that, but judging by the archives they also get drawn from time to time, there were some very good quality ones there.     Kamen Rider Drive makes you a-ok in my book, WoL! If you're around during the WWD tomorrow, I'll draw you a Drive-related Seiba.     Theyre the next Keyhole Sweater   I hope palette-anon gets to me   Aren't they already usurped by the Hestia string though?   Please someone draw a tribal girl Homura, Ikaruga, and/or Yomi from Senran Kagura, like this pic here? Maybe also  or using pampered 'ojou-sama' type girls    Thanks.    I am a slave to my King, I am sure to be around now.    You're welcome. I will do about any Ryuko request that isn't too stupid or too lewd, so sure, will do transformed another time.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482  Ahahaha. 11/10! thanks!   Requesting Yayoi Kise struggling to draw  your waifu for you.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482    Usually they do that just to shitpost and kill the thread. Either way, I hope you choke.     play it fag   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482  I can fap to this   Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482  Oh god no.    Here it is  i also uploaded the lineart, so, if you find someone who can colour it correctly then you can do it      Noice.       Her outfit is cute but I am not the man for the job.    Requesting lewd Eto, a pose that showing her cute butt while she's smile, and anything else lewd is good too.  Requesting Kaiki as a grey Super Sentai or Kamen Rider with a white Scarf and no helmet posing in a way that totally clashes with his usual apathetic expression.   As the image was loading, I didn't think it looked bad, then suddenly  Amputee   She's supposed to be kneeling down, right?      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482  No!!   Have you got your request prepped for tomorrow?   I need ideas.    I hope drawfriends like flowers.    I'm deciding between two    Do you neets really look forward that much to the wwd?    Naw, I just kind of wing it.  I always add "anything is fine" and such to my requests, though that doesn't mean much      It's the main event anon.    Renge in a micro bikini    Wedding dress maybe     neet  I miss those times, but no.     requesting rei as a knight,go for a melancholy feel.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482    here, have a 2 minute sketch.   I wanna draw some /fit/ girls.   Hey, mine too    That meme sort of died out already. Cute sketch, though.     Draw me mugi squating below parallel    Requesting Sherry leBlanc in a sports bra and boxer shorts, with some fit as fuck abs.    OR here; very cute! thank you!     I was serious though     Shitty Sketch Fag-kun, is that you?    Draw waifus with muscles but not like that huge bara shit.    Seems like it doesn't take much. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482      sounds cool, i'll see what i can do    Shouldn't be too hard.  An OVA for the show she's in was just released.     Cool one, gonna be a bitch to draw that form, but let's do it. Setting up stream https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>     Kanadefag?    just cause I'm curious, how'd you know? is it just a lack of skill thing or have I just been doing something in particular retarded that tips you off that I should stop doing.    how about a fit april o neil?    how about go to /co/?     Fuu Inubouzaki cosplaying as Old Snake   something like this?    What the fuck kind of criticism is that?      kawaiii    Even if your drawings are technically not great, they still have a lot of consistencies with your previous drawings.  Super round head   Photograph   Looks like it was drawn with a HB pencil   Questionable anatomy/perspectives   Charming          deleted it because someone already did it, youre lucky you saw it    I'm not sure if he meant it as criticism, but its important to remember this isn't /ic/, a lot of times anons just know something is off without know what it is.  although saying something looks like a whale instead of a human is usually a good tip off that its probably your everything.      Niiice.   I don't wanna be greedy but could you do one where the uniform is white? If not that's okay too.    Very much appreciated anon.       Requesting the fusion chart of Samurai Flamenco, Tekkaman Blade, and Guyver I   anon people get double deliveries all the time! if you put a lot of work into it you should post it!     totemo faggato desu ne anon sama   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182482     being this buttravaged that you were second    My pen scratched the surface of my wacom, what should i do?  running in circles with my head in flames didn't help too much     I loved it anon, keep working on drawin' and dont give up.    I actually scan more often than photograph but thanks, was just a bit curious what lead it on as opposed to other anons that do pencil drawings. (other than the questionable fundamentals that is). but this is getting a bit too chatty for me so I'll shut it now.    I think the point is it's based of Totoro and Mei and he's supposed to look giant.    I personally prefer the blue one, but your choice. There you go     Clean the tip? Clean the surface?   Call tech support?      I like both but white is more nurse-y.  Thanks a lot anon, hope you have a great Friday and weekend.      well first change the tip. second how badly was it scratched? if its just a surface one give it a slight rub down to smooth it out and continue on, if its a deep one, why the fuck are you drawing with a knife?      That stocking flash     Thanks, you too.    I want to request Natsuru in that pose but I think Natsuru got a delivery a few days ago.   requesting a bunch of narutos poudning a purple dolphin monstergirl who is evil with their fists like in northern star cause it was she bad and wrongs sasukay because they made him wet his pants in kawaii but darker style  thx        maybe i panicked too much, it's a small superficial scratch, outside of the drawing area  anyway its weird 'cause i always keep the tip round and clean      Requesting Mio Isurugi and Louise Francoise crying at a cemetery and comforting each other in a not lewd sisterly way.  Requesting Jibril wearing any kind of Swimsuit, preferably something like a one piece  for something kind of lewd nipples can be pushing up the material    honestly you should rarely leave a noticeable scratch if you're not jamming it into the tablet. trying lightening up, having 10000 pressure levels doesn't mean you have to use #10000      I spent to much time designing my - tan and forgot about my request ;_;     literally self insert beta tier bullshit &gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/     I feel suitably baited. I'll see what I can do.    so far i have this   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186073  She's not ready for display yet, I was happy with how she looked last night until I realized she looked too similar to  raymoo      Sweet!    Very nice.    Status: Stronk    Not that anon but Kanadefag here. I am also pretty hype for weekend though!   Request nude catgirl eating taiyaki (the pastry) or playing with a big taiyaki pillow.  That's weird, I'm drawing something in practically the same pose.   fucking forgot to link it, I'm dumb<br/>     Funny you should say that.        I have you know I wait in anticipation for the next dunk tank delivery on /a/ every day.  Its just a group of haters who continuously slander Kogasafag. A most generous gentleman who shares his commissions with other dunk tank fans.         Scandalous    What is this homosexual shit?    Requesting Yuzuko from Yuyushiki, doing a fucking ahegao, that's all what I want D:    counterrequesting     D:     Today has been wonderfully grand for a twisted and pitiful knight like me. All the wonderful depiction of my Lord lights the fire that was long dead in my body. With this I have a new found passion, one that was long forgotten in this hollow shell I call a body. Thank you comrade, I grow happier and happier each time my Lord is drawn.    OR here, thank you so much!     I really don't know what to think of you...      homosexual shit   It's called yuri.      WoL is a masochistic Saberfag but if he isn't an enjoyable fag you would be lying.    His charisma is beyond A+, this is some EX level shit right here. A curse I tell you.       rrrrrrricooooo   How do I into anatomy?   i've heard rumors of a really poetic saberfag named warrior of light thru the oldfags, but i totally didnt expect this EX-rank charisma   now add WUG's leader into it and you shall get even more fame      Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  requesting tamamo lying in bed pov similar to this Maybe with a fang showing    I've been so unsure what to request the past couple of weekends. Maybe I'll just wing it, no matter how unusual or lewd it might be.     If you weren't here in the heyday, you missed a hell of a lot. I have never seen one fag able to charm to drawbros to the point where they went out of their way to draw for him.      summon him for holy grail war   NP is knight speak   able to charm literally every other servant   except for Saber         told myself that I'd stop requesting, regardless of how much I got shitposted   haven't really been in the threads for a while now   still want a few more drawings but the threads are utter shit now, with shitposting everywhere, worse than before    Should I bother this weekend, or just move on entirely?      Requesting full-idol raifus And wearing (power?) armour like their actual gun    join streams, everyone there is super cool    Give it one more chance I'm sure she'll be drawn.   Draw younger girls matured into adults. So for example, Ayame at age 20 or 25; or Yoshino..   Doohinkus may help    if i ain't in the middle of  drawing a maid waifu mini-collage  i would have drawn for him right now, but perhaps i should just insert saber into it    requested only in 2 out of 3 previous weekends, 2 weekends saw my waifu drawn and the weekend where i didnt request saw my waifu included in the collage  guess imma lucky, much ureshii        Requesting Mugi smoking a blunt with Yui please   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189298  I really wish people would just request and fuck off and not shitpost about stupid shit like circles, harems, and all that. Just draw and have fun    kek    it's a fairly common pose, and looks cool   nice anatomy btw    looks cool too        love him, of course, i mean, it's the coolest fag of all times, just look at that charisma.    Finished. Hope you like it bro!  Still streaming btw.     Just insert saber into it, he will be the most grateful anyway. He is Sabersexual, I even seen him getting lovey about Jeanne D'Arc so yeah.    He is clearly a really big fag, the way he types should be annoying but somehow he bypasses all of this to be a really cool fag. I think he just has really good charisma which is strange since he is a saberfag.    Holy shit, nice.    I want to fuck that.   Requesting Mistuba doing chubby loli things, such as wearing small outfits that are much too tight for her chubby frame, or shoving a big thick  salami  or a nice juicy  footlong  into her mouth.   No, I never go there, it's cancer. Never will you find a more wretched hive of autism and faggotry. Unless you go to r9k or something.    ooooooooooo!!!    We don't serve your kind here    What a nice request.   Fuck legs.       C'mon, son!     fuck legs  them's fightin' words     You wanna fight?    Yeah you do.   Anyone got something lewd that needs coloring? I could color some tits right now.  Playing some music while waiting  https://picarto.tv/live/channel.php<wbr>?watch=asocf</wbr>       We don't serve faggots.    Then how do you ever expect to get a delivery?    Fuck.    http://i.imgur.com/Cdxy5nF.png [SPOILER]Cerebella from Skullgirls    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray). It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling. Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.     Tamamo in a naked apron for you if you like http://i.imgur.com/74kD15L.jpg   Requesting Tomoko wearing a lewd Egyptian outfit.   Okay, that's pretty funny.

I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance. Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan    thanks stronger, you really nailed the style, this is definitely gonna help for my collage idea!   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192387  im not drawing it its a request idea.

I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live Both have mind-controlling abilities.   Requesting anything with Dr. Bees harassing Miroku or otherwise triggering some kind of PTSD reaction from Miroku.  Bonus points if you quote "The Wicker Man"     I might do some more MILFs, I need some names thrown for inspiration.    Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal.  Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.    There's two in the post, Ayame from NouCome and Yoshino {Date A Live I think) so those? I mean I'd like Ravel or Koneko from DxD myself.     do a milf darudayu    A MILF Tamamo    Yuri, homosexual. Doesn't matter what its called. All that matters is what it is.    MILF Mashiro?

I have no idea what to request.    revvin up my  Diego  request    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127194780   tfw don't know what to request.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127194780  Could you try this    Four hours remain.   Goodnight    20 minutes here in cali    I hope you go into poverty, Kogasafag.    Out of idle curiosity, is there a spot where the previous dunk commissions got uploaded? The archive images go dark after a week or so back.    Christ the horror.    yukino/yuigama/iroha/kawasaki from Yahari    Nice, who drew this? ch2o?    Fuck. Off.    A couple or requests (and a coloring WIP) before I go to sleep: Something lewd with young Mikado Ryouko (brown hair) and Tearju Lunatique (blonde). The pics on the left show their school uniforms. Both are from To Love-ru....    Unsure, it has the drawfag tag on Sankaku Channel. There's around 20 images there under the dunk_tank tag. Most are fine, though there is one that is just fucking horrifying because some futa-furry got a hold of the idea.    And requesting Mami getting a little something in return for letting Madoka sleep over...  GOODNIGHT!      Now you know how everyone else feels, faggot. Stop posting this shit here.     dunking is fine, furry is disgusting    Not sure if this is even MILFy enough, Satsuki already fills those shoes very well. Someone suggested me Satsuki, and after some thought the belly dancing dress Junketsu came to my mind. So I guess that's that, hope someone enjoys it.      Dear lord you people get mad fast.  Asking honestly as someone new to these threads; is Kosa really that shit that he's made the whole anime WAM community look bad by association?       Requesting Kuroko causing Frenda to make bad life choices with her teleportation ability.   kek    Nah, drawthreads just filled with crybabies, didn't you see that collage the other week?    Literally the first day in the thread following from the rager spamming the DA dunk tanks. Didn't know /a/ had a drawfag thread before today, though I've spent a lot of time in the /v/ one and the /i/ NSFW one.    I really enjoy doing lolis and chubby girls. Im definitely going to mess around with this character tonight.    Please don't drag in dA drama here. This isn't the place.    It is also not the place to post completely unrelated commissions.    Tell that to the retard Locodoll linking the threads in his rage posts. Though I do agree 4chan shit should stay on 4chan and dA shit on dA. All linking that shit does is bring in more normalfags, or worse.    I'm glad I checked back one last time before going to sleep. OR here, thank you drawfriend, this looks great.   Pushing her shirt down but the tiny bits of fat are still sticking out  I bet she could fit that whole thing inside her, chubby lolis truly are a miracle of the universe.       Kogasafag going to these lengths just to shitpost  Amazing.      think I know what I want to draw   people finally request it   realize I don't know what I want to draw        unrelated commissions   anime characters on an anime board   fuck the fetish freaks, but come on now, if it came out of these threads then here it gets posted        look at comments   he's a navelfag  Sweet Jesus the ride never ends.      alright then I'll get mad slow, but you may not like it     Starting to get confused. Are we saying Locodoll is Kosafag? Or something else?     He appears to be a navelfag who is assblasted enough at dunkfag to shitpost on a completely different website.    Oh.  Sorry, it's 4AM and my brain is doing pretzels. Dumping the rest of that and then going to bed.       gets told off for blogging paragraphs   responds with the longest blog yet   Fuck me what the fuck       STOP STOP STOP ITS ALREADY DEAD ITS MAKING THE DUNKFAGS LOOK REASONABLE FUCK     Clearly, Kogasafag is just misunderstood and didn't do nothing, he just needs money for those commissions   going full /pol/ with that line and then full retard at the end      so navelfag was the true shitposter all along. Pity cuz navels are pretty great on their own.    navels are great, feet are great, don't condemn them for the people who are associated   god its 1:35 in burgerland wheres the WWD  wifu?   Hello Best Coast brother. Unfortunately we still have three and a half hours to go.    BROTHER!  why do we have to wait that long      Think the person said 8AM Eastern or something    That's usually when the threads are made usually 7/8am 4chan time.     eastern  shit.    requesting Dejiko doing the "wakarimasen lol" expression  im so god damn tired have fun in the WWD without me guys    OR here, thanks again!    I never got what 4chan time was supposed to represent.    Eastern Standard time    4chan's servers are located in new England somewhere, Massachusetts iirc but I'm not sure. 4chan time is just another way to say "eastern time" or "gmt+5"    Anon, he said "your waifu," not "my waifu."    You mean gmt-5?   Requesting Chiri in proper IJA uniform.    Not a bad collection. Its missing quite a few though, including my personal chihaya dunk one. Its fast in other ways though, the furry one only appeared on hentai fondary 3 weeks ago. I didn't post it here because /a/ doesn't like furries.  We could use an archive perhaps compiling all the 2d dunk tank pictures out there. It can get posted whenever someone asks for it.       That's because you're new and weren't here before the inline was around.    Dunkfags aren't welcome here. Git out.   Requesting slutty girls wearing slutty sandals to show off their lewd, slutty feet.    he's  the term was landwhale, which relates to females and yamato is the girl's name mei is a kid, so she has chubby features, but the recreated version even increased the body volume and kept the height proportion as is yamato is a slim teenager, and the portrayal doesn't really match chibi, she just became a fatass i'm not trying to complain btw, it's just a comment        Captain's log: Spirits are high as we enter the final hour before launch. Let us pray that our voyage bears fruit.   One hour remains. Say goodbye to your family   dude, I did this last thread; this hurts me so much    You did? I'm sorry, I didn't actually request last thread and wasn't around, so I didn't see it. I'll check the archive.    wifu soon   still no idea for a request     micro bikini mud wrestling    Wifu drinking a glass of cum.     well, time to sleep   wifu starts in less than an hour   its not like I wanted to sleep or anyhing. Only 6:19am, I can see the sun rise  again ;_;        Me too fam, I'm hitting the hay. Fuck it     Waking up to a delivery is priceless.     I feel a bit bad about the fact it's normally been hours since the drawfriend posted it and thus I wasn't able to immediately thank them.    With my sleeping schedule I need to do it constantly, unfortunately. I always seem to miss the last one or two threads too.   Thread is up. Request away.  <br/>   I guess I go and request the same thing I requested here.   Navelfag's a fucking retard for bringing the Deviantard here, but he's right.   Requesting you hang yourself with the slutty straps to those slutty sandals.    Slut.    What's the context of this?      OR here, nice work. I especially like the shading used. Only major complaint is that Honoka's text on her top is backwards.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127202151  that's a lot of white space in your reference buddy   Bump   Yes.     So navelfag was the true shitposter all along.  Somehow, I don't think that's the case. Navelfag hasn't responded to any of these posts, at least. He hasn't talked about this crusade, either. The real shitposter is the guy who is making a request just to piss everyone off (the new Dunkfag)    Requesting chubby (not landwhale obese) Misaki in a cow-patterned micro-bikini chewing on greens and looking happy. Give her a collar with a cowbell attached, too.   Or an out-of-shape Misaki getting fucked fit by this goddess   Reminder to practice drawing feet, because footfags and anti-footfags are all just useless garbage beneath the  feet  of an artist. Your progression is all that matters.   Don't believe Kogasafag's lies.   Something I sketched out of bordem. Since it's summer, I decided to draw a picture of a girl in a bikini. What do you guys think?   Is there somewhere where the pics are stored at the moment?  The furry one is the only one I've hated thus far. The concept of it doesn't shun me - the idea of some haughty stuck-up bitch who really has the humiliation coming getting dropped into a vat of cum is a fun one - but between the furry and the futanari and the art style, bleh. To each their own, but fuckin bleh.      The problems are innumerable.  But it's good that you're drawing. Keep it up.      This is true, learn to draw sexy feet because it is something else to learn to get good, not because of footfaggtry.    This. Learning how to draw boobs doesn't make you a titfag, so why should learning how to draw feet make you a footfag?   Draw what you would do if you caught a wild Yuki      footfags are THIS desperate to be noticed  Pathetic freaks.       Looks like the one desperate to be noticed is you anon.    That Anon IS full of shit, but he isn't using anything that'd make him be noticeable. It's not as if he went full "hey look at my, feet blow, navels are better"    Admittedly, was assuming he's the same guy who spammed about footfags earlier. Difficult to tell.  Can't we all just enjoy our individual fetishes? Everyone gets off to something, and there's certainly more degenerate things to fap to out there.      footfags   not the Jews of fetishism      not furries who spend thousands on real life fursuits     At least furfags are kicked around and put in their place every day. Footfags don't recieve that kindness.   Requesting Rule 63 on Raoh   Drawing for the threads for quite a while now   Thinking about starting requesting too   Summer starts   Will just get thrown into the shit drawer with them  I'll just wait a few months, I guess.       Just jump in, the sooner you start to blend in the better.    Request characters lifting.    I could always offer art trades, but that'd seem like I'm being a massive faggot.    You can try, you might get some good feedback but the only downside to that is that you'll get some hate from non drawfags because you're doing something they can't and they fear it becomes a thing here.    Faggot? You mean master race?   i want to draw the Darudayu, Rosia, and Cyan. any ideas on what they should be doing? no lewds   Pajama party    Cooking dinner   boom  fed drawfags   What did they eat?    hopes and dreams     REAL boobs shouldn't be bigger than the head   don't stylise them like a WEEB   Korra  Yeah, I'm not taking this virg's advice.       It's a beginner artist who isn't wrong on most points but has no business drawing tutorials.   There are way better ones out there. Like the ones in the OP, for example.      But isn't it usually those comic artist that draws shitty balloon implant tits?     One thing he is wrong on is there's no space between breasts. They might not touch or press against each other each other unless they're huge, but even flat chests meet in the middle, although generally you won't define them enough to show that.   Yes.        You still alive anon? And if so, mind if I pick this up?     It's a beginner artist who isn't wrong on most points but has no business drawing tutorials.   He's a Korafag, that's enough reason to not listen to him        i guess ill go with the pajama party. drawing them all cooking dinner sounds hard to do     Requesting Homura tricking Madoka into going abroad for summer vacation, while hiding a newspaper behind her back, with the headlines "Same sex marriage legal in the USA"  This banner looks a hell of a lot like Miku about to pleasure herself with the leek, so could someone maybe draw that?  gimme a simple request. CLEAR   Marii wearing Erza's outfit in this. http://i.imgur.com/jhXpmsp.jpg    I know what to request!   If you could       this wasnt as simple as i thought. cheers   i guess i could do this too, its going to feel wierd doing it though       That's because you underestimated the power of the flame pants    Awesome. Thanks so much, dude. This is great.    Thanks anon! But yes, don't underestimate how complicated a simple request that isn't chibi can be.   Requesting a cute drawing of Kyoko Iwase in bikini eating an ice cream next to her black FD3S  Anyone know what happened to MDF? He seems to have dropped off the face of the earth.   Good, he became a faggot anyway    I loved his work.     Lewd or not lewd?      i guess i could do this too, its going to feel wierd doing it though  Thank you, anon. Don't feel weird, it happens all the time in fiction.    Noire as a mobster with a tommy gun and brass knuckles  Oora?  CLEAR!  Any WIPs?   i-i-its not like i drew this for you anon i just happened to have paper around ! !  b-b-baka!      looks good tsundere anon also,  same sex marriage now lego!  i laughed.       Then I choose Ochako    woahhh! looks nice!     Oh shit I have the worst attention span today   Well, thanks, yeah, you could definitively practice a bit more. The legs look pretty disproportionate and uneven, and I'm not gonna lie, that's quite the manface.     June 26 is Tite Kubo's birthday. Requesting beautiful bodacious Bleach babes doing sexy birthday stuff, like wearing nothing but birthday present ribbons or popping out of cakes in sexy outfits or whatever.   requesting rei as a knight,go for a melancholy feel.  See here I don't know m8       I have no idea who this is but nice not OR! What about the other gals in the post??     Might want to go to the Drawthread then     Disregard that, I'm retarded. I thought I clicked on the Bleach thread tab I have open.     c-censored for the sake of sfw my catholic grandma watched me drawing this 'what a pretty dog' she said...      awesome deliveries as always AV   tfw, can't draw anything as im at work till sunday, nor rest for me        'what a pretty dog'  I'm getting a whole different image in my head with that     Holy shit this is fantastic.  Arch?     A lovely cat and a lovely  Precure Thread !    If we made love would she leave scratch marks on my back?     Otokichi can help with that.     I'm going to marry Haruharu!  megu midriff    I wish her Precurel form had midriff     That was the lewdest outfit in the entire franchise. Toei's been so bold recently. I guess the soccer moms just don't pay like they used to.     Sluttiest pink     Ah. Jerked it to her so much you lost you ability to cum or get hard anymore then?   I just finished HeartCatch.   The last four episodes was amazing. I kept reading how it's considered the best season so I think I went in expecting it to be miles above the others and was slightly disappointed, but the last few episodes completely changed my mind.  I didn't really care much for Yuri throughout the series, but the scene with her dad made me tear up and grow to love her. I loved Infinite Silhouette. It's a shame though super-Tsubomi purified Dune with a punch and not a hug though.  I liked seeing the Generals all get happy endings, especially Sasorina for some reason. She was my least favorite, but it made me happy seeing her as a teacher. Itsuki growing her hair out and sparring with her brother and the last scene with Futaba holding a precure Perfume was great. I really enjoyed HC and I'm sad to see it go, but at the same time I can't wait to start on Suite tomorrow.           She pulls off subtle lewd off pretty nicely     I'm going to pafu Pafu's pafus!        Everytime someone finished HeartCatch.   Proof there is a lewd god   Now neither of us will be virgins!   This movie's great.     Why do you all watch a show made for little girls?    topless mermaids  Nice.         Is that the Bandai Tamashii Web Exclusive S.H.Figuarts Cure Sunny?! Lucky!    Noise?!  This is the exact same plot as the HaCha movie...     mermaids aren't topless anymore  You had one job, Toei.    Is that a fucking Magikarp?   Well that was anti-climactic as fuck. At least Nico got a Dracky out of it, I guess.   Nico wants a dicky       The Smile movie was everything that I wish Smile had been.   The Smile movie was not particularly original in terms of plot, but PreCure movies usually aren't very original, and I seem to enjoy them anyway.   I liked Nico, and Miyuki's cluelessness was actually plot-relevant in a good way.          I wish Monkey Yayoi was my girlfriend.  Mana's going to marry  a deceased canine .   There isn't enough fanart of Mana being fucked by a dog    Is any Cure safe from dog love?   I kinda hope the lovely cats are safe from dogs.      saucenao   this work was deleted from pixiv  why      Little brown idols are the best.    pixiv   why  Because Japan.        I want Hime's cherry.   She's already given it away, and claimed to be giving it away a few dozen more times.    It was a play punch, really. I think they made that much clear.     I want to give her cute round belly.  Gokigenyou!  He's even doing the squat.   SLAV L A V        Wow you're pretty ignorant of Japanese culture huh?    I know what you're talking about. Still makes have a lel    interspecies couples is wrong that's why   I love this ending. The CG looks great. Did they do one with HapCha's CG? The HapCha CG had more texture and better colors. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qvw<wbr>g-qkjAZA</wbr>  [ ]    Yuri looks so out of place.    I hate it when people upload videos with 720p as an option when the original encode was shit to begin with.    That's because she looks so ay lmao     Doki has the best EDs, they are upbeat and the dancing is pretty good.       Erika remains the best.    I prefer the first ED to the second but yeah they're really good.   Can Ako twinkle?   Maybe in a few years, but right now she can only Muse about it.    Only for Souta.   Honoka is really cute.   She sure is.   It's a shame Toei rehashed so many designs from FW when they made SS. When you get past that it's pretty good and has a deal enough to set it apart from its comparative.   I'm sure if the MC and fairy designs were different then more people would give this season a chance.      The fairies looked different enough.        They should have given it some time before airing right after MH. I would have given it at least 2 to 3 years minimum.    I want to lick their collar bones.   Flappy sure did, the other one not so much.    Aside from the designs SS is pretty dank. I'm glad I chose this as my last season. Though, if I could I'd rather choose Fresh or HC. Oh well, this is not bad at all.      Will we ever get another subbed musical show?    It had some awesome fights and I feel like the dual transformation is good compensation for the lack of team members.        Why does Itaoka make the best transformation sequences?    Iona is my angel.    dual transformation is good compensation for the lack of team members.  I love it. I hate the bigger teams. I think 4 is as high as it should go, 2 or 3 is most optimal. I only gave a shit about half of the Yes 5 and even less than that many Smiles.   Now you'd think that I'd love Max Heart, but in truth it is my least favorite. Maybe someday we will get a Precure with just 3 Cures but I don't think Toei would ever want to give up the money you can get from shilling multiple Cures.        heart beat   Cannot be stopped. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KMV<wbr>TbAS1Psc</wbr>  [ ]    beat is not crash    resound  It's a shame this was only used like 3 times, it was a great idea: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2Q0<wbr>8us3GK_U</wbr>  [ ]   So how are you guys going on those coloring books?  For those who would be interested, CDJapan has the DokiDoki movie at 50% off (3800 yen, about $30). They only have one copy left. I'm passing since I just bought the HaCha movie, but maybe someone else ITT is interested.  http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/TC<wbr>BD-320</wbr>         knpk    mktn       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mfn<wbr>IpzoqpaQ</wbr>  [ ]   Daisuki Shin     earrings in the shape of her symbol  that's cute as fuck    Suite doesn't really have any wild boys does it, also what's up with Hakushaku, how does it fit the naming theme of Ouji, Baron, and Knight?  Rare footage of Cure kigs and Kamen Rider suit in the same place as Super Sentai statues. Also OBAACHAAAN  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yrY<wbr>T_-hvr_0</wbr>  [ ]     Yes, in fact I believe it usually translates as Baron itself.   Geez Kanade calm down.  Heartbreaker!  I wonder who that could be.      guys  We're all little girls    A Hummy note!  This is the cutest note!     Usually translated as Baron or Count.    Wait, why is the Rider there? Did the Beat costume get ruined or something?    I bought a 300 dollar tablet last week specifically so I could scribble all over those pages like with real crayons, but it just takes so long to color those things that I never finish one before I get bored.   I guess if I had to pick I would pick Kishi     mktn is the best.      Suite and OOO were on TV at the same time.     Not posting the shower gif  Why do you do this?     banana peels  kek     I don't have that one, sorry.      Look at this cute, cute, cute cat      This cat is cuter.    They always say the cupcakes are oishii, but all they're eating is the frosting.     Sonna banana    This bothers me too     That always bothered me when I watched it.     I too am bothered by that.     ayyyy lmao     Who the hell eats cupcakes for the actual cake?   Frosting is gross. There, I said it.  Time for summer uniforms!  Nine seconds in and we're already getting started.   Suite has some of the worst male uniforms I've ever seen.   I never would have guessed   And why do half the male characters have Hibiki's dad's faggy haircut?     faggy   Most of the guys in Suite come across that way. Ouji and his crew are the worst, but a lot of the others too. Not Souta though.        Hibiki's dad   You mean grown-up Rin?         Hummy yelling  Off-screen though   Hummy is a devil!         Not even Hummy can deal with their bullshit forever.     Now I'm kinda sad   Those two episodes were pretty sad.    I liked them, like a lot   That's just mean.   Two?       Man this super terrible Siren, literally the worst thing you've done.  Now that I think about it, Hibiki's family situation reminds me of Tsubomi's backstory, that made me cry a little too.     Isn't it a pretty common family situation in Japan? Everyone's always busy busy busy no time for the family. I don't like it.    I want to make Hibiki not alone by being alone with her all night    real Hibiki mama  Fucking great   We are not alone together     Lewd    Mix and match dildos   Suite had a kind of weird progression with their finishers.  They went from Passionato which needed both of them to do, to getting separate finishers with their Belltiers that they could use together, and now they combined them again for a duel finisher.       This was the best Suite finisher, yet the only used it about three times.     This mom and daughter pair are super pretty.  I really do live the Suite designs  for the girls.      Hibiki doesn't remember any lullabies by her mom    I want Hummy to fall into that pot and be boiled alive    Yup, two. But then you're probably realizing that right around now.   These last two episode have been really nice.   It felt like this was the moment Hibiki really came to life and became a much more profound and maybe even relatable character. It's a shame they didn't do the same with Kanade.   I love it when Precure makes me feel things  Absolutely love it.    One of my favorite Precure episodes.  Hibiki's mother is gorgeous.   well she sure as fuck didn't get her good looks from her dad    That would require some genetic relationship to her dad.     Kanade was a bitch to the very end.     I'm not sure I like what you're implying.   See? Everyone thought this was the end of the series.  And now into the long dark age that is the Smile midseason.    This is such a weird tradition. They're not just big, they're fucking ridiculously huge.  Best royal guards ever.  This is going to be the best thing ever, isn't it.    I need to watch this now...but I can't... Why can't I just sit home watching anime and make money?     So the Pierrot clock resets and counts up to his "true" ressurection and the Decor Décor has to be refilled again to actually awaken the queen? Well that just makes the midseason climax look all weird and out of place and pretty much like it never happened.  Oh well. Here we go again, I guess.    Well, ocean, actually. How will we avoid bathing suits this year?  And no OP2? Boo.     I'm not gonna lie, you can easily skip at least 5 episodes in this stretch of the series.    I want to fuck tiny furry Reika    You can easily skip any number of episodes in any season (except MAYBE doki doki).  It's about the journey, not the destination, man.     Heh, this is fun. I feel like this has been done before, but for some reason it's cute to watch these two compete so hardcore with one another. Maybe it's because there isn't really anything mean about it.   Considering you could probably skip more than that most years, I'd say even more, then. But some people get all testy when you start talking about doing that.   Imagine my disappointment when they didn't have tiny fairy cure forms.        Oh Smile. How you do such a great job of making buttmonkeys of your cures.   Still waiting for you to embarrass Beauty, btw.      spoiler: the bad guys lose the cures win, there now you can skip the entire franchise     Expecting Reika to ever be embarrassed  That's a nice joke.    Sometimes I wish that I was dead.    At least she's not CGI this time.     I'm starting to think that this anon has tried to kill themselves hundreds of times, but can't. I wonder how far they are from hollowing.    To be fair  Reika doesn't do anything.     About 100 more ceiling fans to try hanging himself on.    Pop admiring the fairy harem he just created   Kind of cool, actually. They actually made it surprising by having him be relatively ineffectual and grovelling throughout most of the series.   Also he looks like the first form of a Dragon Warrior final boss.     I dunno, I figure if it can happen to mktn, it could happen to anyone.    I want to make fairy babies with them.    You're not a fairy.    I might be.    Where's your ridiculous verbal tick, then?    It doesn't show in typing.    Typing out a verbal tick is a bit silly no?    That's part of what makes it ridiculous.   And now I wish I could remember all the instances where fairies wrote letters to see if you're right or not. Damnit.        But what is it?     Tarte wrote one that time Chiffon's food ran out.    Yeah, that's the only one I could remember. But they couldn't read it so it never came up.    Nigga   I fuckin did it, guys. I watched all the Precure. Splash Star was hype as fuck. Definitely within my top 5.   What do I win?     You don't just finish. You can't watch it all because you need to watch it all again.    Now I know how the I want to die anon feels...    Omedetou! Now you can't become a normal person. EVER.    A lifetime of suffering and misery.    Now you have to go watch some bootleg Precure.     Alice is the sexiest Precure.   The second ED mostly consisted of handwaving while standing in place though. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-p6<wbr>fRlO1Y18</wbr>  [ ]  I miss Maeda.        Don't forget the technology.   Mods are asleep, post Fairy Tones.     Now you must watch them all over again with out subs then faces the extra boss Balala.    Out of curiosity, how long did it take you?   I don't want to fuck Mana but I want Mana to fuck me.   Now you have to watch the various dubs.       Are they pen pals?       Mana is taken, anon. She's mine.        I want a piece of Erika    I want piece of her mother.    Welcome to the elite club, the realm of true Big Friends.    We can share. Mana likes being shared.    Yeah, it wasn't a serious punch. "I punch you, because we're friends and I know it's OK".  I loved Heartcatch. Everything (almost) just came together. FW was good too because I enjoy the characters more than in most seasons, but it's poorly plotted.       Smile movie was really good, except that they don't really seem to grasp how Miyuki's role in the group is supposed to work. Still, fun movie. HC movie was better though.     Doesn't seem like it.    Yayoi is top cute. Be sure to enjoy the upcoming Cinderella episode.    Check this out.    Cupcakes are dumb as hell. It's just a piece of sweet bread to put frosting on, and who wants to eat big chunks of frosting. It's a fundamentally flawed idea.      The second half is the best part of Smile though.    Aren't Knight and Kishi the same thing?  Same with the other two?     Niggatone    Yui is perfect.     I would love to make her unmarryable   What were their names?   I would love to join you in doing so.    Then why isn't she a princess?    They're going to reveal in the final episode she was a princess all along.    A princess has to be fit for marriage.   Do you hear the creaking leather sound?   I hear the sound of clanging metal    Yes. It makes me think about how painful it would be if they tried to hold your hand that tightly.  Which is kinda hot to be honest.     I cropped that pic you posted. I tried to shop heart pupils into it, but it was harder than I expected and I wasn't happy with how it turned out. Maybe it was for the best.     Are these real prototype Cures or fanmade?   False.    Fake and gay.    They are fanmade but some people will claim they were the prototypes for the real Cure Beat which is also a lie. They do look cool though.    Waon makes a better Cure Beat than Ellen.  Fuck a cat. I want a lovely dog Cure.      They're real  in my heart.         Is it common to have fakes like that? Or of that quality?        Naw no it's not common at least from what I've seen. And it's Japanese fan art they usually put more care in their fan stuff. So you won't see any lazy palette swaps like those you see on DA.   Few threads back someone mentioned precure motifs and the seasons were mentioned.  Someone in Japan had the same idea. Not bad for fan Cures. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=puv<wbr>YambeJ6k</wbr>  [ ]     I hear they were fake leaks made by Toei themselves because they were pissed that someone leaked Cure Sunshine's identity during Heartcatch. I don' know how true that is though.   1-hour drawing incoming.  Today's theme is episode 12 of Fresh Precure. You know, that wig episode, the best episode of Fresh animation-wise.  http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-26?<wbr>lang=en http://togetter.com/li/839669?lang=<wbr>en</wbr> </wbr></wbr>      Some people despise fan Precures but when they're done really well they aren't that bad. As long as they aren't gaudy or being past off as leaks I don't mind.    best MOTW  Hype     What is the concept here, Dynasty Warriors Precure?    Whose dick do I have to suck for a Dynasty Warriors Precure?    You know whose.   Hm. She looks kinda familiar, but I can't quite put my hands on it.   I had forgotten about her eyebrows.    Anon, you can't go out with all three of us so whos it going to be     None of you. I want choose Love.     eyebrows are the hottest charm point for cures  armpits are number two       And Hime, having both, makes her the best!     Tsubomi &gt; Miyuki &gt; Nozomi  I'd probably still choose Miyuki since she seems like she'd be the most fun to hang out with.       Haruharu is so close to being the most perfect cure.      wanting to have fun  You aren't living your life correctly.     There is a story but I can't read Japanese    I can relate to Eren here.  I used to feel the same way about getting nails trimmed.      Nozomi.   Good thing Milky Rose has both.       I want to be a precure.   Was the ever a more perfect Cure?       Tsubomi because I like smart girls.    Melody. She even has the midriff and ZR.     Cure     This is a Cures-Only thread. Please remove yourself.    Where did she get those boobs? I want to get some for my Precure.    I can and I will.    Milky Rose isn't a Cure because she's  too good for them .     Instead of the mentor enforcing Renai Kinshi, he states that the number one rule is to not pursue Lu Bu   &gt;tfw the girls kill Diao Chan instead        Milky Rose looks just as odd with them ad she does without them, it's weird.    After you, Milky Lose.       Hikari is a cutie, would adopt and raise to be a good girl.     I want to make Hikari my wife.    why is her genyou showing    mfw reading this post    Haruka subconsciously wants to get gokigenyod.    Her defenselessness is one of her most endearing traits!   I want comics about periods again.      Milky Rose   Perfect   Cure          Hasn't come yet   In which way?      spent the whole day in /feg/   I hope the day isn't already over for most of us here  Daily Minamin!!        Minami will never tear your hymen     Waon goes in the group of characters who should have been Cures.      Eyebrows   Armpits   Midriff   most knpk         Is Seiji on that list?   What are some of the best character entries, re-entries, returns, hype moments, "holy shit" scenes and all that type of thing, in anime/manga?  eg. Rock Lee's whole thing in the Chuunin Exam. Kurono fucking up dinosaur aliens without his suit. Guts stepping up to fight the Ogre in the witch forest village, having never really demonstrated to his new companions just how insane his capabilities are.  You get my drift.

Good afternoon, requesting my lovely Ai Nanasaki saying "Don't give up", or something similarly motivating, with gentle, but confident look on her face.  Anything is appreciated though.

I would like to request my beloved Mizunashi Akari wearing a sexy hotpants/short shorts with a top bikini, please!

Requesting Fujibayashi Ryou dressed as a Civil War era nurse, please, perhaps changing dressings or watching over patients. Have a good weekend, everyone! Outfit reference: http://imgur.com/a/4cDtn#0   In light of recent events, I'd like to humbly request my husbando acting cute/bashful  on a date with the viewer  in first-person    Th-Thank you for hearing me out, drawfriends.

Please and thanks!      A couple ideas this week. I'd be happy with anything!  - Requesting my waifu wearing Fatima's witch outfit from Luminous Arc 2! Any pose is fine, ans any variant of the outfit is cool too - either a version fitted to her own stature, the outfit as-is and her being embarrassed trying to cover herself, or an older version of Hinagiku with proportions to fill it out.  - Her dressed as Saber Alter or Saber Lily (looking at my past deliveries I kinda want to complete the set, haha)  - Her waking up in the morning wearing nothing but a bedsheet and a smile. More tasteful than lewd, if that helps at all.  - Cosplaying as another waifu in this thread.  Please and thank you as always!             Good taste in jackets.   Requesting a cute Yui successfully playing vidya.  Requesting Laharl with any kind of summer theme please! Something like at a beach or during a hot summer night or eating watermelon would be lovely!  If anyone is interested in art trades I'm up for it.     Great stuff, I wasn't expecting a delivery so fast, thanks for the drawing and the compliment, both are appreciated. She looks so cute here.  Sachiel in the back is also endearing. Again, thank you very much.     I have a lot of requests of Mei Hatsume that you can choose from:  -This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background.

Maybe make it look like she's having trouble walking with all the weight?  -Anything with her in chibi form  -Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop  Thanks for considering!                    Requesting my waifu Yukari.  I'm fine with anything, but seeing her dressed like something out of Mad Max or a Fallout raider or something would be cool.  Have a good weekend      Requesting lovely Sanya enjoying a nice summer day eating a popsicle or being too tired because of the heat but just seeing something sweet with her will make my weekend.

Cute fangs would be lovely as well.  -Anything one of you draw friends would think to be fitting  Thanks in advance if anyone takes up my request, I know you're all super busy! Also a friendly reminder to ignore any debates about her name, it's not worth clogging up the thread for it!                     Woah. That's really great anon.   Requesting something cute of Cathyl, cute lewd is fine too.     see  for why obvious trolls for whom stubbornness is more important than her shouldn't be encouraged.    That's actually a very good piece of drawing. Good job    pls. Just pls.    that's super good, gj.    As I said in that post, we can have a thread if you want me to explain to you what katakana are.    I'm not him, but last week was fucking stupid. I don't care what the argument was, but it shouldn't have lasted for 3 threads.   Cyan from show by rock rocking out in this outfit.    Requesting Hibiki relaxing while wearing DT770s. http://i.imgur.com/OjN3M1C.jpg    awwww.    those legs   Requesting both styles of Kneesocks interacting, like holding hands.

Also those legs     The guy has been persisting on an obvious fallacy for four years out of pure autism, even though all he has to do is turn the audio on. Three threads are nothing.    glad you like it   Requesting Yutsuki.  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, enjoying and dancing/playing Dance Dance Revolution.  For the outfit, you can draw her in her highschool uniform (in the ref picture) or in any casual clothes you want if you feel like it, as long as it's not vulgar/too lewd.  Anything cute would be good too.  Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.        Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  I'd like to request Nio wearing a plugsuit from Evangelion, please. If possible, please keep her bowtie on as part of the design. If colors are applied, it would be really cool if the color scheme could be based on the black, red, and gold of her school uniform.  If not, anything cute, funny, or cool would be appreciated.  Thank you to anyone who may be interested.       Requesting Rozalin dressed as Farangis from The Heroic Legend of Arslan, please.  Requesting Rangiku forcing anon to take her shopping for beach clothes.  Requesting Pamela coming out of the water with a very wet and skin stuck bikini while water drips off her soft, defined, curves. Thank you      Hmmm       to be fair (not saying one way or another) if someone sees a format they like they might use a similar one in their own request.    Yes, they do look quite suspicious.    I am considering doing the same. My only request won't get drawn and the "anything" part is always ignored.    I want to say that the first two are at least different people because two different IPs but I'm not so hopeful.    leave meibro alone    How would you know it's separate IPs?   Meifag and Hinafag are not the same people you morons. If you weren't so summer you'd know that.  I can't speak for Victorique but given the amount of autism that seems to be following him around he has his own story, too.     Appchan setting to display IP count for each new IP next to the post.    Why do you keep doing this?    You seem to be the third, at the very least.    I guess the effort wasnt good enough this time around right?     mami     cute waifus     Not Oora!    Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune leading her hyakki yakou or wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.

Her outfit looks really cute.    Healthy!   Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:  http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276 http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a>  </wbr> </wbr>    Requesting my lovely angel Kaede-tan. Since we're at the end of the season, I'd like to make a VA-related request of her dressed up as either Shinoa Hiiragi or Ryuu Lyon in their combat outfits. If you pick Shinoa's, one potentially interesting thing to note is that Kaede is over 8 inches (21 cm) taller. If you pick Ryuu's, giving her elf ears would be very cute.  Here's the ref for the outfits: http://i.imgur.com/49oj6jF.jpg      Flatchouli   I love you.     What's the general attitude towards requesting both here and in the other drawthreads, assuming one requests the same character, but not the same thing? Is it frowned upon?  Requesting Misha in a zipper bikini or the lingerie in the bottom-right corner or like a trucker with the hat too, please and thank you. Additional references: http://imgur.com/a/CbSUD#0    Don't double-dip.     Is it frowned upon  Heavily. You can maybe get away with doing it on other boards, but if you request here and in the /a/ general you're going to get roasted.    Requesting Hex Maniac wearing some thigh highs, maybe with garters. On-model or 36J stuff welcome.   Reminder that he will just appear in the general if you draw for him here.     video game character    npc    Why is this allowed?       Quit pushing me around Phalanx! I swear once i'm done with the training arc, you will see!   Thanks for drawing, it does takes time and effort to draw even it it FLAT!       You ungrateful little shit.    tsuntsun ycake is cute.   Requesting Ryuko waiting to get sunscreen rubbed on her back.  Mine's an odd request but could I have Tenryuu in a mecha version of this tank? If the color scheme could be in purple and black rather than the tank's scheme of blue and metallic white as shown in one of the pictures that would be nice. If camouflage is a possibility though that would be pretty great! And instead of her sword perhaps an energy saber of some sort in a purple and black color scheme would be a nice add on too.  I can provide a video of the unit in action of needed, but it comes from an old RTS game.   Anything cute or  scary  will do if the idea isn't interesting enough!   Already requested, but how about something fun to try for drawfags?  Requesting waifu team attacks.    Requesting Junko Enoshima canoeing down a river of blood and dead bodies.  Requesting Futayo Honda dressed as a school nurse (Lab coat, Glasses, Sweater or a top exposing her lacy bra and Pencil Skirt. Stockings optional) or dressed as Namie Yagiri from Durarara!!

Did I do something wrong in mine?      Thank you very much for waiting patiently for it. I'm sorry that I couldn't get it done fast enough. I got upset and tore it up due to personal problems. I'm redrawing it right now.    Requesting anything cute of my daughteru, Fiona Mayfield. Thanks in advance!   I support this. Maybe with waifus in PQ's chibi style.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223695   waifu drawthread   ;_;   Is there ever any support for husbandos here? I've been wondering that for a while.       Which one of them?    plenty     I like this idea. Sounds cute.     No worries anon just do you best!    no one would pick my waifu in a team    Or even Persona style!   Im adicted to checking if she was drawn. Please offer help.       I can draw her so you stop checking    A watched drawfag never completes a 2-second sketch.     This sounds nice, perhaps there could be themed combinations (DFC group, short hair group etc) depending on the artist's preference.     Can you do ?    Onegaishimasu.    tfw your waifu isn't popular enough and well liked   everyone says you have shit taste  Fuck.     You must tell me who she is    This is awesome.    Fuck off Mimifag.

Requesting this scene. But instead of Misaka trying to hold her skirt down. She doesn't care because she wearing shorts underneath.  Her face should be like a "I don't care". Perhaps shes busy texting, or her arms or crossed, or what ever you want.  (background and background characters of course not needed)       I've never heard of that before.    i really suck at coloring, but i hope you like it. you can rerequest if you want to    Learn to read minds through text.    Draw mine instead     I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"    Requesting a list of waifu bust sizes starting from biggest to flattest.   Very cute.    I feel like you're someone I should be recognizing instantly, but it's not coming to me.  Anyway, super cute!      What if my waifu's varies?    Pretty sure that K or NotK imitating Harda style.    I like this idea. Should we make a list of the combat waifus in the thread?    Crabs    thank you    No. Combat or not doesn't matter.    This is super cute and I hope one day you draw my waifu.       I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"   "Wow you should love you're waifu as she is it is only ok to shit on ycake for it!"  At least be consistent thread.      Drawthread is made of many different persons and opinions    ycake is for bullying    Y-you look cute.    It was an art trade and I think he only said that because he knows I don't like big breasts.    You don't bully your friends?     Not liking big breasts    Requesting my dear Ion, thank you!   But that's really cute anon, I really like it. I love how embarrassed she looks.  Thanks a lot anon, I hope you have a great weekend!      added to the list    I guess some people liked the format I use, but yeah, I had a feeling people would say I'm haremfagging if I posted right after the first guy you linked.   Requesting her sunbathing, or lying in some grass, please. Thanks for stopping by!     What name should I put by her picture?    彼女の名前は?    I wanted to draw her for you a while ago.  As you know still practicing so sorry for badly drawn wifi.      Junk Emoshitma.    Do you have a link to the colored bottom right picture you have?  I need it for reasons.      What's her name?    知りませんwwww    Damn, this is really amazing.    everything will be ok, even if she has no name    that's nice    holy shit nice    Pretty lewd, but she looks very relaxed. Good job.   Requesting.  Since it's her birthday today. Requesting Yuumi receiving her presents like the genki girl that she is, anything else is fine, really. Have a great weekend and good luck!     Why does Futayo get all the nice deliveries?    You keep improving your coloring with leaps and bounds, Twrl-senpai. Lovely work    Because he does art trades      Why does anon do nothing but shitpost at home alone on a Friday night?   rip this drawing looks like shit there goes my confidence   Requesting Lain!   ayy    What episode and time does she appear? You've been requesting her long enough to pique my curiosity.     bringing yourself up     very nice    Let's all love Lain!    Thanks, I've been trying to focus on that a little bit.   Requesting anything Frau koujiro   Very cute    Aw, thank you. I like it, and as you keep drawing and practicing you can only get better. Thank you, have a great weekend!    Why does she have a sheath on her hip while also unsheathing the blade?    shhh     I wish I had a pair of pajamas like that     Two swords fumbass.     fumbass      Fumbass     She carries two, she loses them a lot.   Requesting Erika, please! Anything would be lovely, but doing capoeira or something with a similarly dynamic pose would be pretty great, but alternatively something cute that could soothe my heart would be nice.  Thanks a lot, and I hope you're all having a nice weekend!    I would appreciate anything of Kurumi. For example, wearing an evening dress sitting on a bed's edge, or at a bar or sorts. If you want a specific outfit, a classy dress fashioned after her Astral Dress.    fumbass     There clearly isn't another sword there. Look at the hilt of the one she's drawing; you'd be able to see that sticking up from behind her hand if there were another sword in there.  Dingbat.     Clearly it's pointed towards her back so perspective makes it stay behind her hand.    It didn't end up looking much like her, but I hope you like it anyway!    That doesn't even make sense.   Since I have plenty of pictures of my waifu in her frilled uniform and because I heard that her hair is a bit complex to draw, requesting her in an outfit of your choice and in a cute hairstyle that the drawfriend finds a bit easier. Long, straight hair is something she's done for example  How much gesture drawing do you guys do?   Kawaii    This is a fucking awesome delivery, and I'm sure OR will love it.    This is nice.    Your drawings are really cute.    I think you need to work on your hands a bit, but the face is really cute!    Not enough   Has despair set in yet?   cosy and cute     edgyfluf.jpg  I giggled. She's looking mighty  sharp  there. I love it, thank you very much!    Ryuu has two blades, neither of which have crossguards. Let's go with            I'm having empty thoughts like last week, yeah    I'll give it until Sunday night again before despair fully sets in.    The weekend hasn't even started.    But anon, it's only the first day. Stay hopeful everyone!     I haven't even requested yet and it's set in.     I despair everyday, the fact she hasn't been drawn contributes little to that.  Mostly cause I can just as easily do it myself.     Is anyone streaming?   You should have a picarto account by now, anon-kun    I watch other people's streams but I'm not fond of streaming myself. Besides,  I'm a bit busy with comms  but I like checking in now and then.   Post WIPs   I gave her different hair if you're cool with that   Requesting ghost girl Kanoe Yuuko as a Ghostbuster.   Bonus points for any gratuitous inclusion of Bill Murray...     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228472  pls no   it's shit       Despair why? I got a delivery in the first thread   Requesting Dyshana wearing a black sleeveless sweater or top and a white skirt, pregnant and happily cradling her baby bump. More references: http://imgur.com/a/kWB2E#0   Also, never really got the chance to thank the bro that replied to my request at the very last minute last week. Cheers, mate!   Damn that's fucking cute anon. Eureka seems to look pretty cute with a lot of hairstyles.     Here, Anon. It's a bit too sketchy, but hope you like it.   Hello, drawthread.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782   I have no idea what the list or the circle is, just picked what I liked. You drawfags are like the Illuminati.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782  Are you starting shit    This is cute as hell. Nice work.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127228782  Fucking kill yourself.      Requesting Kurumi posing semi lewdly with her shovel or fighting a zombie in her bikini.  Please and thankyou!     Surely you must be joking.   Requesting Mazaki Anzu being blushfully embarrassed, the reason for being so up to the artist.  Any other works are very much appreciated.      not sure if you can recognize them but here you go. feel free to request again and all that other fun stuff.      I hope you like it      I used to namefag as blush long time ago but I stopped using it         cute~   also cute~        782  You're getting a lot better. I'd say to spend time practicing the torso. Slimming it down while maintaining the girls' proportions might improve the look of your characters.     ignore that green text not even sure how that got there     Requesting Kukaku as Rosy the Riveter with a wide smile on her face.   Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps acting romantic and/or saying " I love you."  Have a good weekend.     Hooolyshit this is cute!  Thanks SSF. Have a great weekend! Continue your drawing journey!~  you can rerequest  how can I though after this?        You're a shit.     green text portion  I've noticed on some browsers if you have something highlighted when you reply it'll automatically copy it into your reply box. gets confusing sometimes  advice  thanks, its always nice to get that.       Very nice. I always love your drawings.   Requesting Yuki reading intensively a manga or a LN, wearing her glasses, thank you in advance  Hi everyone in the 2nd thread. Requesting my love Shinobu laughing after hearing something particularly ridiculous.  Thank you and have a nice weekend, all!      I stopped  Why is that?  I was very happy when I saw you coming here again.       Nah. I expect my request won't be taken but I will still hope for the best. No despair for me as I got a cat.    Morning with Kaede! Hope you are still here.    Very cute. The alternate hairstyle is adorable!  my thanks.      oh my~ that's good     drowsy waifu with bed head   I know what I'm requesting next week!  This is awesome, keep up the great work!        fuggin cute   Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  A bit late in the thread this time, sorry. Still hope everyone is doing well though! Requesting Shinjiro flipping through the channels on a tv, looking bored as hell; just coming out of the shower  no lewd please ; or hiking somewhere pleasant. Anything is also fine, thank you very much and I hope everyone remembers to take it easy.     It's actually looks great. Thank you for drawing her!     This is wonderful, Anon.     Draw more fluffiness, that is amazing.    gosh your drawings are always so adorable.  never stop please. I wish I had a waifu just so I had a chance to get something from you     This is adorable enough that it hurts. Lovely work.    Thanks drawfriend! Your month of learning has paid off. I really like your colouring.    What do I do to get a delivery of this quality?   My end of a trade with the guy who drew Cona Madaya for me.   Not be an unlikable asshole.  That's pretty cool anon, nice job.      art trade   wait, how do art trades work again? they're not deliveries right?    Promise an art trade, but then never actually return the favor.    commission    If you're asking if you should keep requesting after a successful art trade, the answer is no, it's distasteful    But no one outside of shitposters hate me. I've even had a few drawfags in the Circle draw her.    Then just wait. Only like 2 or 3 drawfriends ever acknowledge me, it just takes patience.     It's really great, thank you very much Twrl. Enjoy your weekend.    Sure, but can I know for what reasons?        even fluffier hair   cute drowsy face   that drool   that lighting  Holy moley this is gorgeous! She is absolutely adorable and I only wish I could wake up to see a sight this grand next to me. I've really enjoyed the work you've done so far, but this is by far the best (I may be a little biased). Thank you so much!        Not all of us can draw that well anon, even if we put our all into it.    I've been delivered, but I was also  trying  a request that also offered a trade  i don't know it's looking pretty bad though     Requesting Tsubaki dressed as Tsubaki, please. Fox ears and tail are not needed.   You and your waifu are a cute.    Oh, well then no, you can keep delivering trades and (hopefully) getting returns.   Rori draw my waifu,   who is your waifu my friend    Here you go.    Oora!   Requesting Noire dressed as a knight, similar to the RO Rune Knight please.  Araki really out did himsself in terms of waifu material with Yasuho. Prove me wrong  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87    in b4 hot pants and yukako   having a waifu   Do any of the novels or such talk about Santana's motivations? I'm pondering an AU where Joseph doesn't show up to stop him. Did Santana even know about the other three being in Europe? Did he hold a grudge for having been abandoned?   Jorge Joestar makes him out to be outright insane.   new chapter when???    Did Santana even know about the other three being  Reread Part 2     When HWM gets the raw scans faggot    Kars' crew definitely knew about Santana, but there's nothing to say whether or not Santana knew where they were going before he was frozen in stone, which I think is his point.    They still didnt get the raws yet, but they got the translation done.  Translation: https://mangahelpers.com/t/kewl0210<wbr>/releases/41436 Shit RAWs: http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3839343714<wbr></wbr> </wbr>      Is the part 4 PDF broken or is my internet just shit?    He wasn't frozen in stone you double nigger.      Damn, thanks, I can live with this for the moment, friday's aren't gone to be the same without JoJo   I want to impregnate DIO.  o-ok...   Thanks for reminding me of the shitty Shamo ending.    Ki special attack route doesn't seem so bad now over REALISM, huh?    That was stupid too, but fuck, I didn't think the author was THAT mad about the whole thing. It seemed like he wanted to kill it as hard as he possibly could and just forget about it.   so the cousin is from the new future he's creating right? that's a nice twist.   hey, me too   How do we fix him?   Don't fix what's not broken.     Put him in a normal series. He'll literally be the strongest human on the planet.     Krillin is stronger than him, as is Tien. He has the #3 spot.     They could never catch up to the saiyans, so you would have to introduce a villain on their level. There could be a arc where a villain arrives from another planet and wants to challenge the strongest earthing, naturally Goku steps up to the plate, but since he is not an actual earthling he is disqualified from the challenge, so it would be up to Krillin, Tin, or Yamcha to beat him.   would definitely watch    Or you know, Gohan      implying he won't be defeated by Mr. Satan   Why send a half breed when you have the real deal?       Goku is an earthling dumbass he lives on earth he's just not human.    Make weaker bad guy underlings that Yamcha tien and Krillin can handle.     tin  I giggled     Give him a soul patch    You should ask Yamcha that     Make him the MC of a baseball series and have him be like One Punch Man of baseball because of his inhuman strength and speed.  One Swing Man      Give Humans a massive buff. Allow them to unlock their "Human God" potential, making them on the same level as a Saiyan God.    you can't .  It isn't like Tien and Krillin where they actually did shit and became more useless as time went on. Yamcha was pretty much shit since day one     Have humans their own transformation, Super Human. Then give them Super Human God, and Super Human God Super Human.   Jesus Christ that sounded retarded.     Yamcha disappointed me, I actually thought he had potential in Dragonball but throughout the series he spiraled downward. Now he's just a former shadow of himself. Unless he enhances his spirit techniques he's just gonna job his way through the series   Start a movie like regular one, with new bad guy showing up. Everybody else gets fired up for a fight, but Yamcha just can't do it anymore, and movie follows him instead. Somehow he catches trail of somebody who is controlling the big bad guy from shadows, and forms a plan to take him down, maybe he could get Yajirobe in on the plan too. At the end he beats the real baddie, which causes Goku to be able to land winning blow. He goes back to everybody else all bruised while they're celebrating. Cue "Where have you been Yamcha? You missed all the fun, join the party though!" and then credits roll.      Ever since the 21st Budokai Yamcha's only purpose was to lose to the newest strong person.    make him into a Werewolf, Zarbon style his Dancing with the Wolves origins made him distinct, maybe a little Bleach's Starrk    Make humans able to make weapons strong enough to fight strong beings.  Giant robots with megalazers vs Frieza.  Technology &gt; raw strength       Tenshinhan and Krillin never officially became "dead weight". Krillin got everyone revived on Namek, and turned the androids into allies.   Tenshinhan did his Shin Kikoho on Cell, and stopped Earth from getting destroyed.  Yamcha is just Yamcha        This actually feels like it could be a Toriyama movie that I would enjoy very much.     One Swing Man  Just like his date with Bulma   also check'em       I truly hope they somehow fix the humans in the new DBZ. No one expects them to ever become as strong as the saiyans, but I would like them to be more than just background objects for them to show off their wind on clothing montages.    Krillin   human  Anon...      I'd rather Tori stop being so lazy with humans and actually gave them a ki ability that lets them keep up.    and with his bold head he's at least 20% marble     Technology &gt; raw strength  If the Androids didn't exist, I would say that's complete and utter bullshit considering Frieza has enough strength to destroy a planet with his pinky at his very weakest.     Tenshinhan you have 3 eyes, chill    make him android, eg android 88,89    You do know that he's just concentrating his ki into one point and it's not actually the strength from his "pinky" right?   Multiverse fag pls      Don’t you think people make fun of Yamcha too much?  Certainly when one thinks of Yamcha, the phrase “good-for-nothing” often comes up. But that does not establish his value. First of all, he is very respected. That’s very apparent when you look at Puar. And speaking of Dragonball, it is a manga famous for having lots of treacherous underlings, subordinates taking their superior’s place. Among them, it is rare for one whose loyalty to their master always persists. In terms of Yamcha’s position, his senior as a pupil, Krillin has more raw strength, but even he addresses Yamcha with the suffix “san” attached, which I think shows just how much respect he has. Even in the episode where he split up with Bulma, that was actually Bulma getting dumped by Yamcha. A man of Yamcha’s calibre would not get left by a woman. But Yamcha wasn’t demeaned by Bulma, he chose to be a clown on his own.  DB is liable to have character’s value be determined by their strength, but I think the one with the truly greatest calibre as a human is Yamcha.         That still makes him significantly more powerful than what a machine should be capable of.     His literally last major showing is getting curbstomped by Tien at the 22nd Budokai and made into a literal gag character by a disguised Kami in the 23rd Budokai, Eveb between the 21st and 22nd Budokai sagas, he was useless in the Red Ribbon Arc and Piccolo Daimou saga before the 23rd Budokai.  And its repeated against in Dragon Ball's second part.       I still like DBO's solution. Humans as ki clerics and ki paladins    That sounds more like a plot for Krillen.  Or both of them team up     If they really wanted to make the Earthling/weaker DB characters relevant again then they would just need to take a page out of Oda's book and make a somewhat larger cast of enemies for the weaker allies to have one 1 on 1 fights with  but that takes actual effort .   We kind of had that with the latest Frieza movie but Frieza's army was mostly just mooks and for some reason some guy who was moderately strong was able to take out Piccolo even though his power level should not have been any where near his...     I agree.   Why'd bulma break up with him again?  I forgot   It's Frid/a/y Night F/a/ggotry, /a/, why aren't you listenting?   Google r/a/dio     just stop   Huh?   Because kuma is dead.  This is against the rules, I'm telling mootles on you.   Seriously stop with this shit.  Saged.     Because Eku became a normal, kuma isn't around, Kilim plays vidya shit, Bacon is a fucking retard that doesn't know how to stream and Eggmun is hardly around.  Not to mention the threads on meguca are atrocious trash of blogging, ERP and circlejerks.    I want to cum inside Eku.  psst, /a/ doesn't publicly like r/a/dio anymore It's okay though, I still like you    r/a/dio is only good when no one is the DJ    a-anyone still listen to Eden radio? Or am I alone on this... I dont even know anymore    Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:  http://buyfag.moe      Having dirt show on your figure's promotional shot     What dirt?    Right there on her tit.    Clean your screen, man.    Joe dirt    they want 14k for this  how      Not seeing it, unless you are retarded enough to think the shadow tones are dirt.    Time to clean up your monitor m8. Also meme girl is dead. Anime sold like shit, rip.     Literally nothing there.    Blind or joking?    Didn't bother watching the show, was it even any good?    That fucking face    Fuck no. Typical super special strong male MC in a generic RPG-inspired fantasy world full of girls who want his dick to varying degrees.     No.    no      I thought so, I'm a sucker for girls with twintails, and this bitch is pretty decent looking, but I can't be assed to watch the show when I could tell just from this gif its faggot shit.      I don't care about the meme, I like her character and I like her appearance so I'll just buy it.       /a/ didn't like it, its probably good.        asking /a/ if an anime was any good     Hestia is only popular because she's an H design in a non H anime. She's designed to be sexualized, that's all.    http://hestia.dance/   Taking all bets; how hard with Hestia figs bin.  I'm thinking at least 40%.    What's the quality on Q-Six figures usually like for the price? That Lovers figure is pretty tempting.   *my shiny teeth and me*  Nah, I like girls with twintails too, and that wasn't enough to make me like Hestia. It's not worth it.     still waiting   Design wise, her outfit is the only unique thing about her, dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen, i can't speak for her personality or anything since I haven't seen the show but her looks are not enough to hook me.   God, I can't wait for the others to be released. Chihaya and Haruka are a must, personally. Yukiho too.  Still, at the rate they're going, it's gonna be a while     ANd you will be losing since the very start, given this one is made to order so it can't bin.   Got these recently, cute as fuck. I hope the anime isn't shit.   This isn't /v/ you fucktard.     dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen,  So, are you saying we need to create new hait color to make a character unique.     I'm looking forward to Chihaya and Haruka the most too. At least its not releasing as slow as their figma line, which seems to have been halted in favor of cinderella girls.     Whoa, where at anon?    Haruka's gonna be last. Gonna give fans a reason to collect them all.    Mami is the perfect daughteru, and Ami is a shit-tier whore.  Being Mamifag is suffering.      Azusa and Ritsuko are all I want.    Meant to quote      http://shopping.hobidas.com/shop/g/<wbr>g110377</wbr>     Ritsuko should come out really nice, but Azusa im not so sure. Her art is drawn from a high perspective, it might not look to good in figure form but I guess we will wait and see how that goes. I think Chihaya is going to look stunning as long as they don't fuck it up somehow.     I can't wait for the Monster Girl merchandise. Figures when?  anyone know a cheap place to get movic stuff or should I just proxy directly off their website?   I wish I could, but I'm really running out of space and money.  Just gonna be Iori, Yukiho, Chihaya, Haruka, and Makoto for me, and that'll be it buyfag-wise for a while..      I SEE IT!   I'm so sorry      Hmm. Anyone going to go for her?   Yes.    They could have made a Saber figure instead. What were they thinking?        mfw      tits too big   wafer thin waist   Of course I fucking am.         fruit roll-up as a cape      They could probably get away with re-angling Azusa's head down a little so she's more forward facing. I agree, she'll probably be difficult for them to pull off, but I'll buy her regardless. Besides the wedding one, none of her other scales look particularly great either but I have them all.     When?     Takane is really the worst of the bunch, in this line anyway.  She looks like an old woman, and it's a shame because otherwise she's best girl.      I imaine Azusa will be leaning forward until her face is level. I really like her outfit even though I don't care for her as a character that much.   Red indicating that which didn't order/don't want, so I'm glad it's only the girls I want left now.   If only Takane had turned out better.        Oh shit now I want fruit leather.  Thanks asshole.      Why did they fuck up the Archer fig but this one looks great   Lucina's price on amiami is 6800JPY, which is the MSRP with Jap tax included. I thought they excluded the tax for the gaijin site?   Yeah I'd hope they take some liberty for the sake of the figure but who knows, I thought they'd mess with makoto but they didn't really do anything with her, and we still don't know how they're doing ami and mami.  Leaning forward could work I guess, could be kind of similar to yayoi.        tfw my screen is dirty as fuck and it actually looks like the figure is filthy      They up the price nearer release lately.    I really want to see some scales eventually.    This. I prefer shows with weak, useless MCs with girls lusting after every other cock instead of his.    The best poses are the ones where they have their mouths closed. They'll also be the least cockmongly figs, then.    I liked Takane's, but I seem to be in the minority here on her. The only ones I really don't want are Yukiho, Haruka, Hibiki, Makoto, or Yayoi. So I'm still looking forward to seeing the rest.       Because someone at Alter said   Hey guys, maybe we should turn him into fujobait to get more sales!   And then they lost mine and of around 8 friends that also wanted it. Fuck them. Hope Orange (GSC+MF) can deliver on a non fujoshit Archer in the near future.         She's going up on Japanese Aniplex+ on the 27th.     Nendos come out   Cerea and Miia have separate lower halves   Can make just about any Nendo a centaur or a lamia  Just go ahead and take my money.       How does a character become fujobait?     8 whole friends     Mind if I join you?     By turning him into a 16 year old pretty boy when he's far from that.     I think I have seen more people here that like Sexy Grandma. I understand the poses are based off the DVD covers but those poses are just downright silly.     scales  Wheyyy.     Cerea Figma when?    That would be a breath of fresh air honestly.   I got some art books from amazon JP and the box is much smaller than normal, maybe within an inch of the books on two sides.  The shrinkwrap was tight enough to hold them in place, but I don't want to risk it with them again.    It's more like someone said   let's use Takeuchi original gorilla arms design and not the updated ufo one that everyone wants  Seriously though I hope he gets another one because it's just awful      I always wondered if Amazon jp's packaging sucks as much shit as what I get from regular Amazon.    I think her design doesn't even translate all that well into a figure. Kinda boring when not in motion.     Is your autobiography getting an anime adaptation?     I do like Takane, but I will try get her on the aftermarket.  I have a lot of preorders at the moment so I can't exactly afford her at the moment.     want to get this babe   dont want my mom thinking I like fat 3dpd   I hate real life 3dpd but for some reason Pochaco triggers my penis.      maybe you should just kill her     aftermarket  judging how iori and hibiki turned out im kinda worried about the aftermarket for takane    I want to bury my face into Wo ass.    Bell-kun   Po-chan &lt;3     At least its not releasing as slow as their figma line, which seems to have been halted in favor of cinderella girls.  Very true.  They're releasing the line faster than I thought they would. A third or something is already out.       More like bell-end, amirite?    cg ruins everything the soulless cash grab wins again not that the originals are not cash grabs        That's really cute    Exclusives can drop in price on the aftermarket if no one wants them. It just might take longer than it does with a standard release.    What's this from?   I'm about to order from AmiAmi for the first time.  Do they put the bill on the outside of the package or do they put it inside?     are you stupid?    Both    So? Prices going down in the aftermarket DOES NOT mean a figure bins. For the later to happen the offer should be higher than the demand which is exactly what drives the prices to the point stores put them in their offer bins.      dominos     sure     Amiko doesn't leave the sales tax out of their prices, they just give a higher discount percent so it looks like they do. BiJ, HLJ and HS leave the tax off the prices from the start.    I mean, it's obviously Miku, but is it from a specific song?   http://animaru.jp/shop/pages/k-on_f<wbr>igure_tsumugi.aspx/</wbr>   I'd rather an Echidna scale, that would be hot.   And she would be delayed       Clear when?    "Miku Expo is coming to Shanghai! Of course we have the cutest Exclusive Nendoroid Miku to join her too!!"     The figure of Kotobuki Tsumugi has been canceled, due to unforeseen circumstances she will only be available at the black market.      301x336     Slightly higher res     Wish this retarded joke would die.     Ah, great. Thanks for the info.    I really don't want to get onto the slope that is miku nendos, but she's so beautiful    just avoid slipping    Holy shit she's beautiful. I already have enough Miku nendos but I don't think I want to resist this one.     figure sits on shelf at retail price, doesn't sell   price is lowered until someone buys it  That's exactly what binning is. Of course producing more than people currently want is a more frequent reason for binning, but a character losing popularity or a better figure coming out will also cause it.       &gt;figure sits on shelf at retail price, doesn't sell  Thats the point, the figure doesn't sit at retail price since there are no distributors, anything on the market after the release is second-hand.  That is not binning at all.      The bird died :(   Actually it's not, binning is making it's way into a distributor's sales bin AND the price going down because of that, and exclusives don't have distributors beside the manufacturer/production company themselves, that's why technically they can't bin. Only decrease their price at the after market.    You're going to follow suit I hope.    Give it a Viking funeral.    Then get out of the mine.    it's a message from your cat  you next       BiJ and N-Y are distributors. If people cancel their orders, they're left with figures they may or may not be able to sell right away. I'm sure there are other stores worldwide that deal with exclusives too, and have the same problems.  And the definition of binning is to sell something at a reduced price. Exclusives are sold at full retail plus tax so technically, selling it for anything below that is binning, though most would probably agree there's a threshold it has to cross first before it's actually considered binning.       Fuck off with your shitposting emoticons.     BiJ and N-Y are distributors  Wrong, they are resellers      BiJ and N-Y are distributors    Yeah no, not for exclusives, they are scalpers, resellers if you want to call them that        And the definition of binning is to sell something at a reduced price    Actually it's not, comes from the fact that they are in the sales bin of the distributors, not just because their price got reduced. By your definition the lower than retail prices amiami offers are binning.      Woah!    And finally, the ongoing DRAMAtical Murder series will also become ORANGE ROUGE!   ongoing   Soon. I hope they'll announce his nendo at Wonfes.       best dinghy    The ships floating around her look kind of half-arsed, with their clear bases and black support stands. A cool idea in theory but the execution is shitty. If I get her I think I'll display her without them.     Whatever. If a figure is sitting in their warehouse because they can't get rid of it until they lower the price enough, and that price is below retail and the figure is an exclusive, it's binning. And they also lose money since they don't get a discount when buying it.   Yes, okay, anything below the initial discount price can technically be considered binning. It's just the more radical examples like 50% off that jump out at people.        I am pretty happy that amazon.jp put her up for global shipping.     Oh come the fuck on, I already have two Miku nendos.     Lame, it was cute.     And they also lose money since they don't get a discount when buying it.  Main point here is neither the makers nor the real distributors lose money, it's the reseller who does, that is second hand.   It's like a random anon buying a second copy of a figure and never selling it because the local market is not that friendly.  Just deal with it, your definition of binning is fucked up.           two  Whoa, watch out for that slope.      anything below the initial discount price can technically be considered binning    You just went full retard. Your usage of the word binning is screwed beyond belief.       Fuck off back to where you came from.     Shit, I want it. Surely they'll put it up for order in their store, right? It won't be like Ahri where you have to go to the damn country the event is in to get one for non-ridiculous prices, right?     It's too late for me, anon, she has too many designs I like.   Not sure whether to get the tan version or the standard...   Neither because it looks like shit.   Well AmiAmi just took my money. Now I just have to sit back and wait for the other two girls to be released. Only thing I don't like is how they changed the base. Not going to look right next to the other two.   The thing about Ahri is that it was a commission by Riot. So GSC couldn't sell it even if they wanted to.   I got Alters Estelle and Raven and that Jubilee scale on a whim. Eventually I'll work my way up to Yuri and Rita   Best loliballer when?   Nice display.    Best loliballer when?  She was released first.     Damn. Someone really put a lot of effort into this.    Can't I have Sakurider instead? Or how about that BB figure that was announced a while back? Or maybe just a decent Sakura figure besides that one Dark Sakura with the weird hair/forehead.    I'm pissed about the base too. Saki is next and she'll be getting the same curved base.    Oops, you can't see her behind the ugly giant in that picture.     Once HF comes out maybe.   Who am I kidding it's going to be full of Sabers like always        I know. So I'll have two with the first style base and three with the curved based. Since Maho is my second favorite loliball I can't just hide her in the back.    I'm surprised they didn't make some sort of deal. Going by the resale prices she would've sold very well as a standard release or as a Riot/GSC store exclusive.    HF will just be an excuse to make more Saber Alters. Maybe a Rider or two. We'd be lucky to get a Sakura.    Two flat and three curved isn't so bad. You can display them like X Y X Y X.    gamagori fig when?   just buy a mako for scale and then print a poster out that'll cover a wall for gamagori     Airi is love. Airi is life.     Just watch them do re-releases of the first two with the new base  as exclusives.     She's too  short    I'd be fucking pissed.       The ships themselves are pretty cool, but your right about the stand/base.  And to me they distract too much from Wo herself.      I was hoping that Saki would have her hair down in her bunny figure. Hair down Saki is sexy.    Holy fuck, that's honestly the worst loliballer you could've chosen.    Really? Well I hope that happens      She's not the worst. Close.   They go in order: Tomoka Maho Hinata Saki Airi          exclusive   Not bad, but this is the real order: Tomoka Hinata Airi Maho Saki        Would you?  Fucking release when    Maho that low  End your life. It isn't worth anything.     Tomoka beats Maho because of the better personality. Maho is cute as hell though.     They all suck. LeBron would beat the shit out of all of them.      Ill help you guys out since it looks like you need it.  In order: Airi Hinata Tomoka Maho Shit More shit Aoi Even more shit Saki                I kinda wanted Maho, but if I am to choose just one it'll be Saki for sure.    Only utter fuckwits hate any of them.    Shitty weeaboo art   pedophiles please go   Not sure. Both LeBron and the loliballers have a hard time winning championships.    But Airi's personality sucks. She's not cute. Has too big of boobs. Is scared of everything. Has too big of boobs. And is the weakest girl on the team. She also has too big of boobs.         She was annoying as fuck, though. To coincide with that statement, she was objectively the most cliched character in the show. These two very major faults could have been forgiven if she was even the slightest bit attractive, which she wasn't. At least she wasn't Saki, though, right?      Event or store?     I'm reminded of that loliball thread that had some real-life basketball announcers calling a loliball game.     Miku Expo exclusive, but GSC apparently said on their Facebook she'll be up in their store too at some point after the expo. I haven't fact checked this so it could be devious lies.   In the end, does it matter? We'll all have all five loliballers and then sit around wondering if the fifth graders will ever be released. Oh to have TsubaHii.    Damn, must have missed that.     Hair up or down?  What's going on here? Time for more Yurus!    best yuru    Why does she wear the buns?     yuru yuri is fantastic but i think the threads could use a break since there hasnt been anything new for ages unless theres a new chapter im not aware of      Wannabe general threads should fuck off.    I lacked presence until I put on the buns    Silly anon, we yuru yuri lovers don't do generals   I want to rewatch another episode of this, but I don't know what episode should I watch. What's the best episode you can think of /a/? (Besides the time travel ep, already saw it)   just watch all of them you dingus    b-but my backlog is huge enough as it is.    mine is too, but we have to accept that it'll never get smaller. follow your heart and rewatch stuff if you want to.    Making daily threads about a show with no new content. Could have fooled me /yyg/. You guys are a general in all but name. Kinda sad really.    wake up   see this right in your face   What do?      Stop making generals for a series without currently content.   The handful of regulars that bump this thread just to keep it alive should create a channel for the discussion and have a little more respect for the board. http://www.rizon.net/        without currently content   The manga is ongoing, dumbass. Get your facts straight before you embarrass yourself next time.       He's saying that no new (translated) chapter was released. OP should at least attempt to start a discussion, not a general.  I don't get how this is so hard to follow. It's like post-S2 again.     Yeah, I mean, come on. There's two OVAs coming before the new season. At least make it related.  And there's this, that's using the anime designs, which is cute. Feels like forever since any news, though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155363  Sounds like you're the one bitching instead.  Also, mods haven't deleted these generals because they've been tolerating them, not because they're quality threads. You'd know this if you weren't such an oldfag simply because you joined after the OVA.     Jesus tapdancing Christ, this is why we can't have nice things. I come here to get a laugh, not listen to you asshats bitch about proper posting etiquette.    Honestly? If you bitch about something, some other idiot is going to bitch back at you. I'm not going to pick a side, but don't try to be coy about it. And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.      We could have had a pleasant thread, OP. We could have had nice things. But you chose not to post any Yurus in your image.   Now Kyouko is crying. I hope you're all happy. ;_;       If you don't want people to bitch, start by not creating shit threads.   Quality thread, gentlemen.     one of the cutest    Part of me wants to believe that this is just a cute Chitose cover, and not some nefarious subliminal shiptease. But I know better.     The manga is ongoing, dumbass  So make a thread when a new chapter is actually released. It isn't hard. These generals aren't discussing anything about the show anymore.    If you don't like how the site is supposed to function, find an IRC where you and the other ten regulars can ERP together.         And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.  It isn't. That doesn't make it right. If you think those other threads aren't being reported you have another thing coming.   Two wrongs don't make a right.       If you don't like it, fuck off  Wow simple      You can't ignore the truth!    It's literally one-sided. Ayano doesn't even think of gran-chan that way.    When she loses the Kyoukobowl, she'll stop being so blind Just like how China will finally admit her love for Akari when she loses the Yuibowl    I want to hug Yui!   Welcome back!    Thanks! I love you anon-chan!    Whose birthday it is?    Well, recently it was Namori's, before that Nana's, and Himawari's. Maybe that anon can't read.     I know I know, I just like Sakurako on this pic.      I like Sakurako in all pics. Except for the ones that delve into weird fetish material.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471    K     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471  See you later.    Why is sakurako the best yuru?    Vampiric hypnosis   Which one would you?   neither. i'm into older women but not THAT old      both       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155046     ok I think the ass blasters are gone so now lets enjoy our Yurus our way        Ok, Kyouko wins a all paid vacation to anywhere she wants. However, she can only bring two friends.Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Ayano and Yui.   Anywhere, I don't care.       Quads must tell the truth     Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Easy. Chinatsu and Yui, Akari will join them regardless, because Akarin.  She would probably go somewhere really close, but take several trains and buses to get there.         From the catalog I thought this was a pregnancy checker    Obviously she brings Ayano and Yui.  She likes attention so would want to keep her dominant harem members close at hand.  She takes them somewhere that Ayano likes to make puns about, so that Yui can be cutely cracking up the whole time.        You think Himawari finally got knocked up by Sakurako? Her breasts have been looking unusually big...    She brings Kyouko and Kyouko, and goes to Comiket.    mom's spaghetti   If the yurus were in a band, who would play what instrument?   Akari would play  triangle.     Probably    what else would she play?      Kyouko: Guitar Yui: Bass Chinatsu: Costume design (she's aiming for cute, winds up with death metal) Akari: Triangle Ayano: Manager Chitose: Piano Brat: Drums Boob-chan: Shy lead singer           I could see it   Found this in my old screenshots today, Himawari sure has a big bush.     what the fuck      Indeed she is.    Because she can drink cocoa like an elegant adult        Drink Cocoa   Lewd.       My kisekae yurus were better, and edgier.     I bet they weren't.     Chizuru a cute. For some reason, Chitose a not so cute.  I think it's the eyes.      page 9  Chinaslug will slide us back to page 1     C-Chinafrog could have got us there faster. J-Just saying.     <br/>    Chitose is already cute, but Chizuru is extra cute because of gap moe.      not recognizing China Sue as uniquely beautiful    Don't judge a book by its cover, Anons.       best doujin  I was prepared for despair I really prepared myself for a sad as fuck ending   I was pleasantly surprised           no u       No words.     Well then guess I have something new to read. Is everything on bakkingamu site? I know they scanlated a few of them   Don't die while I'm sleeping, little thread.   if this thread is still here in the morning I'll be surprised   I want to cum inside tomato pajamas.     I will keep it up just for you anon. Sleep tight     I'm surprised there aren't more doujins about Chitose. She has a lot to work with. Chizuru is better, though.      Why is Kyouko so artistically gifted?   Autistically*     She probably has ADHD, but I doubt she's autistic.     How can a person even be autistically gifted?    Very easily amused.    Oh cmon even I would want that shirt    I guess we're all autistically gifted.      that fucking shirt   Damn Namori for making me love Kyouko more and more every time I see her. ;_;      Hey Yurus, just letting you know if you haven't seen it yet I've started a yuru yuri kik group (#yuruyruilove), anyone is welcome. and dont ask about an IRC, i dont wanna pay money for a server so yeah   #yuruyurilove, spelled it worng      what the fuck is this shit    but i don't have a phone. why are you excluding me?    Over 20lbs of pussy and ass    I am so confused and aroused rn    You wouldn't this snail.    I would.    I want to drink her  t e a      I would China her Chu.     How lewd.    no no no no no no    i already said why, im not gonna pay for a server      We're always here anon. We're here to remind you that you are deluded with your shitty thread that you bump with image spam. There is no need for you guys to keep a constant general up for your show.    last thread lasted 5 days, I think we will be safe, ayano-chan      not fair! i want to talk to people too!     does anyone have more pics of Akari from the manga?   she's even obfuscated by her own weapons. poor akarin. ;_;    You're better just setting up a room in something like raidcall or something       BAM!  Thinking about oppai   Thingken*   Wait, why do you guys think IRC channels cost money???   I would totally play a shump game of akarin and her buns as weapons. Kinda got the vibe from that image.    millennials   What is Akari dreaming about?   just finished reading yuru zero. Other than Archer being way off character it was pretty good      She's dreaming of being popular with the girls.   Little does she know she's already very popular with the little girls on /a/.       needing to poop and no bathrooms nearby   Who are you going to main /a/?   Anyone not maining panda is a faggot.    why Dante?        just woke up   thread is still alive      I'll stick with my main girl Himawari. She's an underdog.   It's been "updated" unnecessarily.       You're welcome. Now it's my turn to sleep.  I'm counting on you!       Thanks! I'll do my best!    Reading through it for the first time at the moment and making crops as I go. Got about 120 images so far with about 30 being Akari. Will post them all as an imgur album or something when I'm done.    It's an SMT: Nocturne joke. And now I'm imagining the yurus as SMT demons. Chinamata.      Just skimmed through my smt4 bestiary and no yuru demon look alikes    tfw no demonic yurus with which to drown the world in chaos        Bumping for the starving children in Africa. China Sue cares THAT much.     Check Bakkin.   No new chapter.  Delete your thread OP.     Here we go again.   Is everyone in the other thread?  saved by chinasue   I want Chinatsu to lick ice cream off my cheek too ;_;    You can let it die, just make another one when there's more anons around. Can't even have discussion if there's no peeps.  I want to marry Sakurako.      It's a comforting presence, it's nice to go to sleep, wake up and find the thread still here.  Thankyou based phallic-object-eating Chinatsu for saving the thread.      i might've killed myself by now if not for the comfiness of this thread.   Chinatsu is love and Akari loves her.  We can't move to a chat because not enough of us have smart phones, or at least interest in downloading that smart phone app. (I just don't have much data.) And the Anon that made it doesn't understand what IRC is.  Anyway, I agree that it's very comforting to wake up to this thread being alive, and it gets really hard to find replies to shit you said yesterday if you keep having to search for archived threads.  It's lovely to wake up, have some tea, and read meaningless babble about cute lesbians.  And of all the cancer on /a/, this is clearly the best, cutest. It's almost as wonderful as Akari's wonderful sister.         Why would you want to marry Sakurako?  Okay, that's a bad question, obviously any sane person would want to. But do you really think you can be a cuter wife than Himawari? The competition is too strong, Anon.      I want to be Akane's imouto!    Ah, to be truly loved.  It's nice how these sisters are so close.     I want to be Yui's sister      Any /a/nons gonna get the Yuru Yuri video game when it comes out?   Nope.   Since I don't own any console.       we don't know how much yuru stuff is in it. i might buy it though.    It seems like it might be quite a bit since YrYr has been the most advertised. I want to see Karen though.     shit, i didn't know there'd be kiniro mosaic characters in it. and after a quick googling i saw there'll be tesagures too. i guess i'm buying this game.    I really hope they actually do something with the crossovers. I want to see Shino get all kinpatsu over Kyouko and Sakurako.     image for ants  I'll pass on it if it only has a handful of songs, which seems likely, but I hope they make another, only more yuru-oriented.   http://miracle.sega.jp/        KIN!    PATS    page 10   Have you handgargled today yet anon?   That'll never catch on.    So you say but I've just finished doing it   No! Bad Chinatsu! Akarin doesn't want it! Get! Shoo!    Yes, Akari is extremely opposed to this     When will the trauma end    how can we save akarin before stockholm syndrome kicks in?     It may already be too late. ;_;     I'm afraid she's too far gone now.    I want to go with her.    Definitely too late.   Okay non-IRC people.  I'll register an IRC channel, I like Freenode.net personally.  ##yryr and ##yuruyuri are already taken. Any suggestions what name we should use?  I'm not convinced this won't die without the asynchronous nature of 4chan but it's worth a try I guess.  How is the phone-only chat going, phone guy?            name  nanamori or gorakubu, perhaps?     Why would you post a Bane mask with a white background? We all already have better shoop images of that.      irc  sounds pretty good you'll be able to use it on nearly all devices      ##rumraisin    ##rumraisin on irc.freenode.net is ours  I'll go ahead and sit in it most of the night.  If it doesn't work out, well all the more reason for us to continue having this very on topic thread all the time.          It will either get as slow as this thread or will become full of erp. The reason this threads work is exactly because it's slow and I can post something and come back to find and answer 3 or 4 hours later. That can't happen in an irc room      become full of erp  Is that something that actually happens often?     It happens from time to time in these threads. Something about lazy lesbians attracts that crowd    Yeah, the slow nature of the thread is nice.  Just thought with this guy with his app and the couple others complaining about it, maybe we could try.  And if it's slow enough, the reply might still be there hours later! (Although I hope not.)        If the irc is that slow it won't be any different from these threads and the only real difference would be that people would have names    Stupid sexy Yurus     China_on_the_prowl_for_a_mate.gif     Happens all the time with cute girls. Sometimes as a joke, but it's hard to respond to it without going out of hand.    brb, changing file name rn    I don't really mind it occasionally. N-not that I've ever done it in these threads but it's fun to read every now and then    Hmm. That stutter makes me think otherwise, anon.    But I haven't! I'm too pure for that!    We all have our dark side.    Is that your confession to being a nigger?    Yes. I am literally completely black on one side, like a special edition Friesian.    That sounds somewhat delicious    pls no cannibalism    M-maybe just a nibble?    We've become that which we once mocked.   Maybe just a nibble.       Did we now? If you hadn't compared yourself to food this wouldn't have happened.     I'll just nibble you in the ear a bit then.   It's still your fault           And then anon was delicious keiki.     I keep my thoughts about 99% Yurus pure. I talked about this in a thread a week or so back. But if I were a lazy lesbian I'd need a girl like Chinatsu, because even as one I'd probably still have no initiative.    Waaai~ delicious anon cake!    Are you going to make me take responsibility?     Waaai~     How the fuck did you get pregnant from an ear nibbling?    I'll help you raise it          Get married you homos It's legal now       Joke's on you faggot it's always been legal in my country    Didn't you know Yurus can get pregnant from hand-holding? So ear nibbling is pretty much guaranteed magic science babies.   I knew you were an anon I could rely on.       science rules.    Well fuck then I may have more magic yuri babies around.     so do we get married now or just keep split custody?        What are you, some kind of ear nibbling fanatic?   I'm not sure I know you at all anymore. But I don't want our child to grow up in a broken home either. It doesn't seem Yuru at all.       I think I was in that thread actually. Maybe you just need a serious head injury either?    This is the other common form of lesbian impregnation.      Now I'm just going to wince whenever one partner abruptly snaps off their half midway through.     why is this purple dyke so fucking beta     When I was in pre school me and friends of mine experimented on ear nibbling so now I'm afraid one of them got pregnant     but those years are past me and I think I'm ready to settle down with a nice yuru who will love me     sorry I'm at work and needed to do something          I think a better question is when did Kyouko become so alpha?          It's fine as long as it was just practice.   I trust you'll be a good girl then anon. Together we can make this family work.    We've had our fun and that's all the matters.          LEWD     It was.    I'll be in your care as well anon-chan. I'll say this upfront though. I'm terrible at cooking.         terrible at cooking  I'm suddenly open to polygamy.   We haven't overcome all these obstacles to starve, right?       Rude!   I'm willing to learn if you can t-teach m-me.        Can't please your man if you couldn't cook. Them's the rules.     TOO LEWD   Claude-sama   Claude face when   Did you like the duet version of El Ragna?  CROSS ANGE'S LIST OF DROPPED PLOT POINTS - The song. It was hyped to be something important; at the end it was nothing but a key for a MAP weapon and a beacon used to find Embryo's rape dungeon.  - Julio wanting to rape his little sister - Red mana - Ange being aroused by violence and blood and how Zola implied that normas are violent by nature.  - The implications of Vivian being a DRAGON: they just put it under the rug.  - The mana civilization as a whole. They just disappeared during the second half. - Misty Rosenblum. Like the song, you got the feeling that she was supposed to play an important role.  - Why Sophia knew the song? - Why Sophia gave Ange the ring, exactly the thing she needed in case of the baptism going awry?  - The failed Libertus. We never knew exactly how Jill lost her arm or how Embryo managed to corner and kill the ancient humans and their norma allies.  - Tusk searching for his friends after parting ways with Ange. They awkwardly retconed that into lol all the ancient humans died.   I think I'm forgetting even more. My theory is, the writers, director and Fukuda thrown all of those plot points since the beginning but they were unable to use them in an effective way; the story and the conflict inside being big enough for more than 25 episodes didn't help things.    <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127172223#p127231557">Click here</a> to view the full text.                     the multiverse montage  But it's a great handwave for if people say the bait was kind of shitty of them. Genuinely one of the only things I'm still bitter about.      the plot point of this was the following so it's a dropped plot point  Okay.     It seems like a lot of these were character based as well, which may seem less significant to a lot of people, but are still annoying.    Given how character-driven the show was, those are as annoying as the big ones. A particular example: of all the first squad, Ersha never got any significant character development. That's why her betrayal feels shallow compared to Salia or Chris. We never truly understood why she gave so much importance to those little girls, even when the show implied that she had a strong maternal instinct.    The new LN releases today. Let's all wait warmly for it while discussing cute yuushas      Ikemen? So Wakaba Nogi is a reverse trap?!?       Yuuna punches everything into daijoubu   Basically what happened.      If only she could punch this world into daijobu.    he does it for free   COOMMIE WHERE DA FUQ ARE MY SUBS??   Never give up on Yui!   the only good option for 8man is iroha. irofags actually helped me realise this with the dubs of truth. although she should learn to set her priorities straight and go after 8man instead of using hayama as a decoy to make him jel   Bijin!?
