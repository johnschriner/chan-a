We'll need to wait for the manga to catch on to the anime, and then see if it goes on.</br>  <br>Ryuu is best</br>  I kinda regret picking it up.  <br>Actually not too bad. Nothing great, but definitely entertaining. Probably my favourite show of the season.</br>  <br>LN translations are going at a crawl too.</br>  <br> what did you think /a/ ? <br><br>It was pretty bad. A lot of promise and interesting things going on, but nothing got done and nothing happened. It was just so average, that the more you wanted, the more you were let down. <br><br>Sword Art Online wasn't well written, it was a horny kid's fantasy, but at least that shit got finished and told the story it wanted to tell. DanMachi was nothing but a prelude, a small taste of vanilla ice cream. <br><br>No one hates vanillia ice cream, but it's also bland, boring and unoriginal at the same time, just like DanMachi. You could skip this shit, and you wouldn't be missing out. <br><br>5/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>honestly it wasnt horrible <br><br>i agree tho in the sense the show literally went know where. It's as if in the last 2 episodes they said to themselves " yeah, lets just finish it up with a regenerating titan " <br><br>That aside I did enjoy it and i did look forward to each new episode</br></br></br></br></br>    Way too rushed, it could have been good for me if they had taken the time to explain some things  Not bad, it was just incredibly... average. Nothing really special about it and didn't really accomplish anything, so it was pretty average/bland.  fun/10. <br>Battle Harem with a twist. No shitty tsundere girl, "childhood friend" was 6,000+ years old, and Bell-kun wasn't overpowered as fuck who could solo final boss by himself. <br>Also nice that Bell-kun wasn't a messiah trope either. Just some scrub who wanted to 'git good' for a girl, even if she was the worst of the series.</br></br>  I'm a little burnt out on anime in general so this was the only show I watched this season. I enjoyed but I know that I'll never see these characters again because no season 2 or LN translations, like always. Oh well.  The show did what it set out to do, have a bunch cute girls in one show with a bland MC and very basic shonen plot points to tie them all together. It relies entirely on you liking one or two girls which was pretty easy in its big cast. <br>5/10 Could've been better.</br>  they turned a show with the potential to become the next; naruto, bleach, one piece into a rushed, short, typical shitshow.<br><br>Sad that they decided to gut this show, I honestly looked forwards to every episode</br></br>  Kinda have the feeling there will be S2, because of the shit with Zeus.<br>Atleast I hope so. If no S2, the ending was complete trrash.</br>  <br>your trips could have been better</br>  <br><br>Best chinese cartoon since Macross and I'm being 100% serious</br></br>  <br>i agree with this, they didnt have to rush the ending like they did because i was fine with it how it was going tbh<br><br><br>A S2 could so easily be done. With more about Zeuz and that evil lady always sippin her wine ( forgot her name )</br></br></br></br>  it was fun. Last 2 or 3 episodes were when it got good. <br><br>S2 would be nice, but i wouldn't care if there wasn't one</br></br>  <br><br>Season 2, nonstop status updates and Bell finds a loot cave that keeps re-spawning shit, then he fooks all the elf sloots</br></br>  Pretty entertaining in general, hype grew exponentialy. The hype for the lasts episodes was gigantic<br>Autistic Gary Sue "I'll save everyone" MC but he is cute so it's ok<br>Cute girls<br>Hestia Breastia<br>Git gud syndrom, but for the worst gurl<br>No one ever gets or severely wounded<br>Funny grampa<br>Hope for a S2, but don't knoe where are the LN at<br>7/10 in general<br>8.5/10 for the ep 9-13</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I looked forward to it every week. I thought it was cute and the action was alright. I would watch a second season.<br><br>Ryuu and Lili are best.</br></br>  Pretty fun. <br><br>Fight with the minotaur was by far the best part. <br><br>Everything after it was pretty meh.</br></br></br></br>  It was a fairly enjoyable and fun ride with cute, if underdeveloped, characters, and had an interesting setting. I think it's a bit unfair that it often gets compared to SAO because, despite not being a particularly good show, it was still many times better. Especially in the MC category. Bell is a likable character rather than edgy messiah chaacter and while Bell is stupidly overpowered, there’s at least some sense of tension when he fights upper level monsters that simply didn’t exist in SAO. The ending was kind of a let down and screamed BUY THE LNs but I still enjoyed it and I'd definitely watch a second season. <br>7/10 <br>also Ryu was best girl</br></br>  <br> bestgril.jpg <br>nice try there anon, well all know vanilla is best girl</br></br>  <br><br>It was all a dream.</br></br>  <br>That would be beautiful.</br>  <br> it was all a dream <br>   Hestia and Bell are siblings IRL </br></br>  It was okay.<br><br>I was disappointed when they started trying to turn the MC into Kirito instead of leaving him the cute fucboi he was in the beginning.</br></br>  bell coon really needs to lose an arm, leg, eye or all 3. Ya know, for character development.  So which son of zeus is bell? perseus? heracles? Or did zeus fuck a jap?  <br> even if she was the worst of the series <br>I'm pleased to know you will die one day.<br><br>It may even be soon.</br></br></br></br>  The minotaur fight scene was solid<br><br>Everything else wasn't<br><br>Despite that it was fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you just made me remember the long ass hiatus Berserk is in</br>  <br>Not before you friend ;^)</br>  <br>hehe i like this one</br>  <br>Actually, it would be pretty cool if he lose a leg or something.</br>  It dicked around too much at the start and the Lily thing took more time than needed. I did like the Minotaur bit and the boost in confidence it gave Bell but it was kinda too late ep count wise.<br><br>tl;dr It was okay.</br></br>  <br>With that taste, it's really hard to believe.<br><br>Nice dubs tho.</br></br></br>  What's up with still shots in the end?<br><br>Ran out of budget?</br></br>  6/10 good but forgettable<br><br>Except for Hestia. Doujins will make sure I remember her for a while.</br></br>  Writing was bullshit but at least it was enjoyable bullshit. And that's what matters most.  <br>Kicking it like old school Gainax.</br>  <br>I want some of the elves and delicious brown girls.</br>  ZEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUS WHAAAAAAAAAAAT  So much Ryu action. Everyone unleashes their final attack. Barely any Aiz to be seen. Hestia being motherly at final scene. Best final episode.  <br>Best part is Zeus is exactly what you'd expect him to be, all about fucking, fighting and friendship.</br>  It's shit but I'll masturbate to hestia  <br>Pretty much this. No conclusion to anything and the last episode seemed to make less sense every minute.<br><br>Some episodes were enjoyable though. 5-6/10</br></br></br>  <br> no LN translations <br>http://www.yenpress.com/is-it-wrong<wbr>-dungeon/</wbr></br></br>  <br>It was fun, didn't try to be anything it wasn't, great girls and Bell was absolutely adorable.</br>  <br> Great girls <br>There really was a girl for everyone in this show. Unless you are a massive faggot and like Rei-clones or tsunderes, which is great because those people shitpost the worst.</br></br>  <br> Sword Art Online wasn't well written, it was a horny kid's fantasy <br><br>At least they fucked in SAO. This shit is going to go 20 volumes before the MC gets some balls.</br></br></br>  Why didn't Hestia or Hermes just use their god powers to kill the monster?  So wait, Bell is Hercules right?  <br>Same reason everyone stands around and watches Bell fight</br>  <br>Apparetly there's one with the brown girls but its a huge letdown.  I still haven't found the source </br>   happy teary eyed half elf in the end credits <br>Eina is LITERALLY the best girl.</br>  <br>Using god powers is a no-no in the dungeon. They weren't even suppose to be in there. Hermes explains it in the episode before they went in.</br>   his grandpa is zeus <br>.......<br><br><br>Also how much he got for that big ass gem?</br></br></br></br>  It wasn't insulting. 5/10  <br>But she used it before to save Bell.<br><br>Fuck the rules</br></br></br>  What the fuck was with the ending? It was literally a slide show.  <br>Is everyone in this thread literally fucking retarded? The reason the monster is there is there in the first place is because Hestia used her god powers and it was sent to punish them.</br>  <br>elves win again!<br><br><br> hermes <br> following rules <br>he uses a cowboy hat for a reason</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking hell first Owari no Seraph and now this<br><br>Quick /a/, reccomand me some new anime I can watch on Friday and Saturday and are active on nyaa</br></br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br> and that evil lady always sippin her wine <br><br>Awww, don't mock Freya. She is the patron goddess of the Arunafetz States in the Ragnarok Online game. The RO game has incremental changes as all games do. Major changes are released as episodes. In a long distant future episode (so far in the future that iRO will probably never see it). Freya will oppose Odin and others and cause a large catastrophe to the world. Many characters had never advanced enough to see, but there was a historic quest which revealed what Freya's high alchemy disciples had accomplished with magical engineering of DNA of titanic creatures in order to harvest and use their energy. There's vat after vat in the game and it's a shame so much effort was done for so few people to ever see. And no, if they allowed factions, I would be in the Odin faction even though I have a lot of sympathy for the reasons why Freya's first disciples first emigated from Izlude to found Rachel. All that history is provided in game via quests or exploration. Ahh well, not everyone likes to poke around every bookshelf or closet they see in the game.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127230373 <br>this</br>  <br> Why didn't Hestia or Hermes just use their god powers to kill the monster? <br>You are stupid. Since it was explained a short time ago in the anime, your memory or observation ability also sucks. So it's no wonder you don't understand things unless it is a really simplistic moeblob show.<br><br>Level 18 where they are is a peaced level. But the monster and other midlevel monsters appeared because deities went down and unlocked their existence if even for a moment. The monsters appearing are a reaction to that. <br><br>The world imposes limitations on what deities can do, and pushes back if deities use deity powers. It's why Hephaestus doesn't simply forge deity weapons every day since it wouldn't be long before all the monsters (even a bunny) became immune to anything less than Kirito-grade weapons.<br><br>If season two dared to be smart, it would have the deities meet to censure Hestia for unlocking her existence in the dungeon for a brief time. I guess that would make Hesita Second Bestia for a few episodes while she is censured.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> i agree tho in the sense the show literally went know where. It's as if in the last 2 episodes they said to themselves " yeah, lets just finish it up with a regenerating titan "  <br><br>I came here to say exactly this. That ending was such a let down, no resolution, he doesnt even get the girl, when that is LITERALLY what the title of the show is about. It's as if they planned out an adventure harem show, when they just kept doing SoL shit, and then all of a sudden they went "oh shit, only 2 more episodes left, let's just throw in a final boss and have bell get the last hit and save the day." Honestly the show was a 8/10 guilty pleasure to me up until the last few episodes that made it a 6/10 piece of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>oh, and I forgot to mention that they went fucking NOWHERE with Freya, Bell didn't even know she existed, no 1v1 between bell and her stronk strength build lieutenant, fucking pointless to have her in there.</br></br>  Why was everyone so happy in the end? <br>Hestia used her godlike aura or whatever for no reason and spawned a floor boss, who probably killed a shitload of people and destroyed safe zone. She's fucked, right?</br>  <br>I pretty much agree with anon here.<br><br>The story was enjoyable for the first 2/3rds or so but then it just went full-retard rush to finish and it did a horrible job at it.</br></br></br>  people compare it to sao but honestly i think that's a shit comparison. danmachi had a lotta heart, and seeing bell get to do cool shit was really uplifting.<br><br>sao is a really shitty attempt at edge, like a dull katana or something. danmachi was like tasty vanilla ice cream</br></br>   everyone was winning in that fight with those asshole adventurers <br> hestia out of nowhere does nothing and still ends up fucking everything up <br><br>so fucking stupid</br></br></br>  <br>The question is:  Did they fug? </br>  <br><br>This is the anime original ending that people wanted so badly in previous threads.</br></br>  the red tint made me feel sick  <br>The whole anime was essentially anime original thanks to JC Staff. That's why the BD sales are flopping while the LN sales are skyrocketing.</br>  <br>Maybe the "good JCs" went to do Soma? Heard that one's amazing. I can't watch food anime without getting starved as fuck and crave for trans-fat food, so I didn't bother watching it.<br><br>I can't believe DanMachi's director is the one who wanted to do this "because the fights are hotblooded" and this is the shitty crap he came up with in the end (source: Nico's anime annoucement).</br></br></br>  What do you think of Hestia's butt?  Everything besides the girls and the minotaur fight was pretty awful. I regret sitting through the entire thing and not just coming to the threads to see if there was any notable fanservice.  <br>nice loli butt<br>8/10</br></br>  <br>Who knows, I dropped that shit after the currynigger asspull bullshit and haven't looked back since. All I know is that they have a long history of pulling this shit. Turning a side character into a main love interest in Sakurasou, anime original end in Henneko, and now axing every single character's scenes for Hestia, who was essentially irrelevant in the LN until this shit.</br>  <br>Is he ded?</br>  <br>Middle of the road as a fantasy story and babby level as a harem. I really can't think of a more accurate summary.</br>  <br>Yup he died of his injuries a few hours after finally getting home.</br>   Berukun's ult is explicitly told to have days long cooldown <br> suddenly he can do this shit twice in a row because fuck it MC powa </br>  <br>Wasn't that the reason the boss appeared in the first place?</br>  <br>To be fair, I thought the anime was okay until this final episode, where they completely just went fuck it and pull out shit from everywhere.<br><br> Bell somehow could hear Hestia <br> Bell completely ignored the side effects of Argonaut when literally 2 episodes before he was shown panting considerably by going against the minos. <br> Everyone smiling for a picture shot at the end. <br> Loki and Hestia actually having a meal together. <br> And of course one final shot for Hestia because that wasn't enough. <br><br>This episode was pure asspull to the extreme.<br><br><br>I wish he died for real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fun show, shit ending. It's what I get for watching 1 cour shows.  <br>That ending just made it past satisfactory. I thought it was going to end with "everyone fails and Bell has to save everyone even though lvl 5 monster with hack regen against lvl2 adventurer with only 2 months of experience"<br><br>And it ALMOST did. But everyone did weaken it to a certain extent.<br>And Bell was justified with the final blow with Hermes just yelling out "He's Zeus's kid! Last hero!" explaining that he was super special all along.<br><br>7/10, wouldn't watch it again. Maybe watch season 2 if they ever do it, but I'd wait for a year or two.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. The ult isn't time based it's based on his battle and desire. The cool down isn't time based either it just takes a shit ton of stamina he can only do it 1-2 depending on how fucked up he is and if he has the energy to pull it off.</br>  <br>Well, at least the manga with superior Yasuda art is still on going.<br>I watch this for animated tits and asses anyway.</br></br>  <br>goodbye space cowboy</br>  <br><br>Agreed. Fairly asspull-y<br>Though it would have been amazing if he died or went into a coma from exerting himself, and Hestia is in denial about it.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot<br><br> Asufi completely reduced to gag character and barely did anything <br> Ryu asking Bell to follow her to attack Goliath <br> Bell thinking about David when channeling his Argonaut <br> Welf's sword actually burn through mountains of mobs and COMPLETELY stopped Goalith from regenerating. <br> 500 men raid reduced to still frames. <br><br>Truly based JC for making Nipponese buy the LN.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> JC staff <br> animation studio <br> all still frames </br></br></br>  <br> no pouting Ais <br> no Ais in cute clothes <br> completely destroyed Ais's design, in both personality and art <br> "we don't know how to draw/animate Ais so here, have more Hestia!" <br> okay <br><br>Yeah, no. There's a reason why I'm sticking to reading the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  i really hope this gets a game  <br>dont like, you watched all the eps</br>  <br>Yozakura Quartet staffs should've handled this.<br> good character designs <br> sakuga <br> good soundtrack <br> absolutely orgasmic sound effect <br>Imagine all of this in DanMachi</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aiz best girl. Ryuu second best.  <br>Everyone best girl &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hestia &gt;&gt;&gt; Lefiya.</br>  <br>Kind of rushed. I hope the manga continues.</br>  I miss it already.  doujins when?  <br>SBC has no money unlike KADOKAWA papa.<br><br>Honestly, SBC/GA is completely retarded for not making this 2 seasons. It's their ONLY grand award winner for the annual writing competition. DanMachi IS their name and brand in a sense, yet they still refuse to dump money into this. Their competition's monetary award for ranking is already less than Kadokawa's, and they still aren't willing to shill the money to advertise their only selling series. Instead, they waste money to animate Rakudai, Bahamut, and Hundred. DanMachi is literally 3x the sales of Rakudai and Bahamut pre-animated, and Hundred has no following at all.<br><br>Their whole 10th anniversary campaign strategy just makes no sense what so ever. I hope Kadokawa NTR DanMachi title from GA just like their branch Fujimi Shobo did to Nobuna. GA is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ryuu&gt; eina&gt; Asfi &gt;everyone else</br>  So what are the chances of season2?  <br> i am smarter then people working in the industry </br>  Was this the no game no life of 2015  does anyone have that webm or video of Bell's grandad  (Zeus)  going "rrrrrrrrrrrrromance" then that cute little bitch yelling ojisan ?  <br>I wonder if anime-only viewers actually know what these things are.</br>  Why was Freya even in the show? That time could have been better spent literally anywhere else.  <br>it wasn't THAT bad</br>  <br>Anything would be better than rewrite-tier shit. At least bad animation doesn't carry into affecting the original source material and side stories, unlike the kind of shit JC Shit pulls.</br>  <br>werewolves you elitist prick</br>  <br>wolfie people</br>  <br>Yeah, because it takes a genius to figure out Nourin, World Break, and Inou Battle are huge successes right? Rakudai is literally your typical harem pos that nobody gives a shit anymore (like Fafnir and Absolute Yaa from last season), while Bahamut and Hundred = your IS rip off (not to mention they're airing after Asterisk, which is another IS rip off).<br><br>All these series will bomb</br></br></br>  <br> literally never explained in the anime <br>Gee, I wonder</br></br>  Always felt like it was dragging its feet. Events that should have been wrapped up by episode six were still not resolved by the end of episode eight.<br><br>I mean, do we REALLY need an episode about some dudes being assmangled about his quick growths that they challenge him to a duel where he wins by becoming fucking Daredevil out of nowhere?</br></br>  <br>What's that mino going to do to the poor dancer?</br>  <br><br>They're bears man. Bugbears. There are no wolves on this floor.</br></br>  That's not the end of the story, right? The plot line with the sex goddess doing nefarious things was never really resolved.    <br> you don't need a business phd to understand that they're fucking up <br> most companies just want to throw out as much shit as they can before they go under <br>This is their strategy make shit anime for the otaku waifu faggots then be bought out by a big studio or go bankrupt and reorganize under another name.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks for that random trivia, truly enlightening</br>  <br> Hating Hestia <br>She's not even that bad.<br> Hating even Lefiya <br>Wow, fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  I will miss it for sure.  <br>bitch, this is a bugbear.</br>  <br>Fate/Zero.</br>  <br>You are welcome, I do go to wiki and read a random article everyday afterall.</br>  <br>You just got JC Shafted son.</br>  <br> liking Lefailya <br>Dude you need get some taste man you're critical. She's literally the worst character on a bad spinoff. Oh wait she much be kawaii~ right so it's alright? Fuck off cancer.</br></br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kicks everyone ass. Best gundam moment ever.  <br>o god...not again</br>  <br>HESTIA IS SHIT, A SHIT.</br>  <br>meh/10</br>  <br> bad spinoff <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>You can never escape the JC train.</br>    <br> Also hates even Oratoria <br>It's time you killed yourself. There's no saving your shit taste.</br></br>  <br>You're seriously underestimating bad animation. But yeah, in DanMachi case, rewriting was a shit decision.</br>  <br>The spinoff is fucking garbage and if you have any taste you'd know it. It adds nothing to the lore, world building or characters' developments whenever the "battle hardened veteran adventurers" aren't doing cutesy moe things they're solving random problems with no sense of urgency or danger with sub par fights they're yuribaiting with Lefailya(no idea how the fuck she's a level 3 with how garbage she is) we have a character like her already and that's Bell only he pulls his weight with his team and doesn't have a crisis of confidence every 5 seconds. The entire upper echelon of the Loki familia are amongst the strongest in the city yet no one ever know who the fuck they are the reason I stopped reading it is because Ais is just as bland and boring as she is in the fucking main series.</br>  <br>Except she is a good character. She develops and has a likable sense of conviction to give her substance and a tangible personality. And being cute as a button sure helps.</br>  <br>1/10<br><br>You tried.</br></br></br>  AOTY!!!<br>o<br>t<br>y</br></br></br>  <br>Why should I fucking care? Gonna oil up my sword or brew some fucking potions otherwise??</br>   tfw there is a lvl 100000 bar maid and you are till shitting your pants on floor 1   <br>How the fuck has she developed? She's just as useless in volume 1 as in volume 4. In the most recent fight she literally had the exact same inner monologue about wanting to be save as she did in volume 2. <br><br>"P-p-please work, they n-n-need me" *freezes* *pause for "dramatic" effect* then gets saved by fucking Riveria, again. She then watches Ais hold her own against fucking Otar even though just 5 minutes before he was wrecking the shit outta every other level 6 he's come across Ais included. If you guys think the main series has bullshit asspulls Oratoria is worse and the author doesn't seem to give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The only anime i followed this season. The other probably will wait.</br>  <br>Show 'em anon<br><br><br>You can do it!<br>I believe in you!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>93/ 100 great art and animation.</br>  <br>ELF MAIDO BEST GIRL</br>  <br>You're trying too hard there, pal. Powerlevel has nothing to do with her development. And she develops, not that she is an developed character. She has overarching development that's almost similar to Bell's own development. Her insecurity and self doubt are issues that she slowly works out, and she does become stronger mentality.</br>  So, should I begin translating the script into Latin?  This scene, this fucking scene right here. God damn, my dick's still hard.<br><br>I mean, they still got fucked up, but hearing that bitch slap connect with that shield, oh dear lord, I don't know how to describe this feeling. <br><br>I should stop playing tanks, god damn it.<br><br>I wish I can jump that high though, like what the fuck, do they have a trampoline or some shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So bell can 1 hit level 5 floor boss at level 2. So he is level 2 with status over level 5.</br>  <br><br>anal penetration</br></br>  <br>this girl did a billion shadow step combo, then casted epic elf magic. got grabbed and carried the item girl. and some dude that did a single block got your dick diamonds? LITERALLY GAY</br>  <br><br>I liked it, but I've since read the light novel up to volume 7 and think it could have been adapted a lot better. They skipped so many details I'm not really sure how it even made sense to the average anime-only viewer. They also removed/shortened so many scenes with every character except Hestia.<br><br>Also, I was incredibly hyped for the Goliath fight last episode (expected something comparable to the minotaur scene), but it was a bit of a letdown and had pretty bad production values.<br><br>It's certainly not anything super-special, but it's definitely better than your average shit LN. Grills were cute and protagonist actually progressed instead of there just being an endless power creep. Hoping for a S2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all stats  BOIPU SSSS Y </br>  <br>Yes, with several higher level adventurers whittling down its mana over a long time and Welf using up his sword and with a weapon drop that comes from the boss twice as many floors down that was solo'd by Aiz to get to level 6.</br>  <br>Because of this scene i realize my desire for Shield Wielding only Mc's, that tanks all the time.</br>  I liked it, I'll probably try the manga now, even though it makes me salty that by saying that I'm allowing them to sucker me in with this teaser of an anime that basically just says "now buy the book to continue, nigger"<br><br>Worst part about the final episode was the way everybody just pulled a super ultimate attack out of their ass in the last 5 minutes with no context or warning that any of them could do such a thing. <br>Samurai chick that was in the group that got their ass kicked by bunnies 2 episodes ago just made a massive gravity cage around a 100ft giant? Ok.</br></br></br>  <br> underestimating bunnies <br>You should know better than do that.</br></br>  <br>Bad animation ruins anime adaptations, which isn't really that big of a problem since most harem/romance anime these days have shit designs and art compared to the original source material/manga adaptation, with a few rare exceptions. Which is funny since these studios have no problem with dropping over half of their budget on worthless VA leeches. Rewrite-tier animation, like JC Staff does, has the ability to negatively affect the direction of the source material and consequentially the manga adaptations. These have far more value than an anime adaption due to the value of the immensely better art quality. It would be like if Production IMS had the ability to completely destroy the talent of any artist of a series they were animating, except that would never happen. In JC Staff's case it's happening to the author and their stories instead.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/XcxKIJTb3Hg  [ ]</br>  <br> It would be like if Production IMS had the ability to completely destroy the talent of any artist of a series they were animating </br>  I thought this would be 2 cour  <br>Terrifying, isn't it.</br>  <br>The LN is the one with Yasuda art(pic related).<br><br>Manga is not but it's not generic like the anime so I like it.</br></br></br>  I like how everyone tries to cockblock Aize and Bell. <br><br>At least JC didn't go for Bell liking hestia with their fanfiction</br></br>  <br>Also the fact that Bell still smiles at Aiz and gives 0 fucks about the other 2 inferior monkeys on his side. <br>It's like he's saying "It's OK, let them be"</br></br>  Fucking trash 0/10  <br>Enjoyed it all, it was a fun ride, would like to see a Season 2 where we could catch up with his grandfather</br>  <br>She didn't use her power, just stopped restraining her godly presence. And that alone caused the broken-ass boss to appear.</br>  <br><br>what i inferred is that its praying to your familia god to lend you power/use their power, so you are basically just channeling your god in times of emergency. if you used that every dungeon run your god would probably be pissed.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Danmachi is pandering garbage for tasteless idiots.</br>  Hestia sucks<br>This show sucks<br>You're all cancer</br></br>  Daily reminder  So the protag never actually catches up to Aiz or what? I feel very unsatisfied, less showing of him catching up more dungeon crawling  <br>Yes, I gave you cancer! I am the neoplasm that ends your life.</br>  <br>is this the work of that hacker guy, 4chan?</br>  S2 when?  <br>shouldn't be any bosses on that floor either.</br>  I picked it up because my list for the season was pretty short. I expected it to be shit, but after the first few weeks it turned out to be quite a bit better than I expected. As it went on I started liking it less and less and the finale was really shit.<br><br>I don't regret it and I guess I can't felt let down by something I was expecting nothing of, but I wish it had been better than it was.</br></br>  Are the LNs translated?  <br>Until 4</br>  i like the mythology and world of the series, it would make a neat game.<br><br>the designs are fucking great.<br><br>other than that it was okay.</br></br></br></br>  What the fuck happened this episode? Elf girl did a buncha shit like telepathy, I'm guessing she's mid level 2 or something and Bell's now upgraded to high level 2.  <br>Elf is level 4.</br>  <br>I was hoping somebody would post this stitch.<br><br>Overall I'm happy with the anime because it gave us some hype and covered material not translated yet. Also confirmed his grandpa was Zeus. They cut out a lot of content, like lots of scenes involving Eina. If I'm not mistaken volume 4 was squeezed into a single episode.<br><br>As a a standalone, this is mediocre. If I think of it as a bonus animation to go with the Light Novel, then I love it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice<br><br>I guess I'll hunt them down and read them<br><br><br> What the fuck happened this episode? <br>A metric shitton of asspulls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This anime was very fun to watch, although the ending didn't wrap up in a meaningful way.<br><br>The minotaur fight scene was still one of the best sequences I've seen in a while and was something I did not expect from this show. Disappointing that the last episode didn't have as much planned choreography.</br></br>  Can anyone who's been reading the untranslated light novel let us know exactly what "limit off" is? This wasn't the first time they mentioned a term and didn't explain it at all, but I think it's the first one that isn't covered in translated material.   Zeus is Grandpa Bell <br><br>No wonder why his spirit form is similar to hestia's</br></br>  <br>You know how furigana works right?<br><br>It's writtened as "adopted grandson" but pronounced as "grandson". Zeus really loved Bell, but they aren't blood related.</br></br></br>  People are really confusing what happened with the ZEUS thing.<br><br>Zeus used to be on earth with the other gods and his familia was the strongest, Bell's parents were in this familia so are "children" to Zeus. So Bell is his "grandson".</br></br>  Wait so we don't get to see Aiz's reaction to him killing the level 5 monster, only some fucking shitty slideshow in the credits<br>How did wolf boy react to Bell bringing back a giant ass crystal</br>   no more Hestia <br> no more Aiz <br> no more Loki, Ryu, Tiona and Tione <br>Time to kill myself.</br></br></br>  <br>It's worthless because of very strong regen.</br>  Final episode was weak as fuck. Worst episode of the series and was basically just setting up the sequel.<br><br>Zzzzz.</br></br>  <br>Both the giant crystal and the party after are anime original. Neither Ais nor tsundere-wolf heard about Bell until later. I don't think they were that surprised because Guild gave an order for everyone to shut their mouth, only "rumors" circulated. <br><br>Soon after, Bell got involved with homo (Apollo), so Ais was more concern about helping him through that. Tsundere-wolf just goes into dungeon to train some more after seeing Bell won against Hyacinthus.</br></br></br>  L-lewd  <br>Wrong, familia member won't call zeus or other god father or grandpa.</br>   Episode 12 <br> Show a spooky boss approaching <br><br> Episode 13 <br> They're battling some generic black goon <br><br>WHY?!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>litterally shows aiz creaming her pants while hesstia and lilli get mad</br>  <br>bitch ryuu is lvl 4, did u notice her doing shadow step and magic casting, while lvl 4 crafter girl was day dreaming</br>  <br>I think bell bypassing damage limit</br>  <br>Who the fuck are you to tell me I'm wrong when you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.</br>  <br/>  <br>Well that's disappointing considering it's a level 5 monster and even Loki's guild only has Aiz as a level 5 figured they'd be jelly<br>Are volumes past 5 translated anywhere? Or moon only</br></br>  <br>The damage he can take? Or the damage he can deal? Does it come with the bell tolling sound track?</br>  <br>Yes you are wrong. Nobody called loki mother. Real family relationship is different.</br>  Daily reminder:<br>Elf-tan wins in webnovel.</br>  <br>The damage he will give.</br>    <br>Because extinct Zeus familia which treated each other like family is the same as Loki familia.<br><br>What the hell are you talking about?</br></br></br>  Is Bell level 3-4 now?<br><br>He was level 2 and then got solo experience on a level 5 boss... that's good enough for at least 1-2 levels.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that there isn't a webnovel.</br>  <br>which elf?</br>  <br> even Loki's guild only has Aiz as a level 5  <br>This is not entirely true.<br><br>Ais at this point is already Level 6 (remember episode 8 and Bell emo-ing going muh Ais the entire time?). Finn, Riveria, and Gareth (pic related) are all already 6 before Ais. Bete, Tiona, Tione are the remaining Level 5s.<br><br>I don't follow translations, but last I heard 5 isn't fully translated either, so I don't think any translation past vol 5 is available.<br><br><br>Are you sure you replied to the right person?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> solo <br><br>...did you even watch the episode?</br></br></br>  <br>No, just cause he got the last hit doesn't mean he gets to level after he just got to level 2 after six months, not even close to enough experience or stats.<br>It was &gt;500 man raid too.</br></br>  I couldn't take the last episode seriously.

Probably won't be remembered all that well in a year's time.<br><br>I was honestly expecting more with the weapon that Welf lost.</br></br></br>  <br>If he is regen. His hp already reached maximum or full again.</br>  <br>Bell only really dealt the killing blow.<br><br>Asufi and Ryuu were the ones doing most of the work in the fight.</br></br></br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br>The weapon got a double spread of "illustration" in the novel, it was SUPPOSED to be more.<br><br>It's power is like Moses parting the sea of monsters and completely removed the Goliath's ability to regen. It looked completely retarded in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>i knew 2 nukes wasnt enought</br>  <br>Basically shit, only good thing about it was the girls who got less and less screentime as the show went on.</br>  <br>If the monster has tremendous regen attack is useless. That's why bell destroy the core by dealing destructible damage that oblitetated its body.because all the previous attack already cured.</br>  Where it sold some compassion? to quench my loneliness .<br>Where peddle dreams of love? because I want this trouble sleeping .<br>I remember the day that my freedom was priceless and no end. however today was to eternity, to see the sun rise tomorrow.</br></br>  <br>Total raid damage (minus Bell):<br>Lower jaw + facial tissue<br>Paper cuts<br><br>Bell damage:<br>Half of head<br>Entire torso<br><br><br>They were merely distracting him.

Hopefully I can find something until Danmachi S2 comes out. Might even have to resort to SAO for my fill  <br>The regen source is the Goliath's natural magic pool.

I don't see this shit with other LN adaptations, why the fuck is DanMachi so filled with these kind of crap. The show isn't even that popular, why the hell anyone would care to waste their time making up shit like this is something that will be forever beyond my comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please tell us more</br>  <br>You're wrong, everyone says you're wrong. Novels say you're wrong.<br>Shame on me for falling for this bait.</br></br>  <br>No it won't explain why it can survive without head. The heart or the crystal is the core that's why he cannot regen aftet it's destroyed.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for you effort though. True gentleman and scholar.</br></br>  <br>If its mp already nothing there is no need for bell to quickly give the last blow because the goliath literally already dead.</br>  <br>It has a core yes, but the core is just the core. Core doesn't provide the magic. Read the page, it already says Goalith cannot regen even when the core is still intact.<br><br>Are you basing your shit on what you saw in the anime? If you are, that is anime original and we're arguing totally different things and wasting each other's time.</br></br></br>  <br>  no need for bell to quickly give the last blow because the goliath literally already dead <br>Did not happen in the LN, was an anime original thing to make Bell look cooler.<br><br>Read </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not wrong in saying Bell did the most damage and he should have gotten solo experience.</br>  <br> bell to quickly give the last blow <br>This shit makes no sense. 2 episodes ago he used Argonaut against 3 cows and was unable to even stand after. This episode he used an even souped up version and runs around like a monkey even after that.

I was disappointed.</br>  <br>  wat , <br>No you cannot regen if you one shoted kill that is <br>common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Translated one more of from legal source is far more legit than raw.</br>  <br>I mean, I guess it's cool to be alive but, nigger should have just used his dagger. It should have broken its limit with him. <br> Work hard <br> Get sweet loots <br> Rookie-kun breaks it just to kill a boss <br>and where was Ais? For all people bitch about Bell, Ais is the mary sue.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It destroys the weapon. The dagger is far more exprnsive than the sword.</br>  Also, is no one else impressed with the OST?  Did his nipples get destroyed?  <br>Are you sure about that? Isn't the Hestia Knife unbreakable?<br><br><br>Be became too erect from protecting bell-kun</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read my previous responses. I said regen needs a core and management, whereas the other guy says you just need core.<br><br>Having a core without mana means you still can't regen.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno about being unbreakable but the dagger do growth.</br>  <br> translation more legit than raw <br>Okay you are that guy. I requested multiple times for you to put on a trip so I can filter you, why haven't you done so? I asked very politely too.</br></br>  Sure is summer in here  Did Bell just summon a sword where the fuck did he get that? Or did they skip an entire scene with blacksmite guy  <br>By management I meant mana. Phone is shit with autocorrect.</br>  <br>So what you're trying to say is if given another 10 minutes or so, Ryu would have soloed it?</br>  <br><br>Yes bell got his new skill, unlimited blade works to make more people scream op</br></br>  <br>What you are expecting 4 channer to be fluent at japanese to confirm it?</br>  What is this?  It's a cat, you twit  <br>It's a Menchi.</br>  <br>emergency rations</br>  <br>A bad anime.</br>  <br>a stray left over from Excel Saga</br>  <br>Menchi was actually cute unlike this piece of shit.</br>  <br>Reincarnation of Yuuta<br>In Shintoism, the mourning period is 49 days after the person dies, and in Buddhism, it takes 49 days to be reincarnated.<br><br>Also notice that Yuuta's picture fell down when they heard it, and named it after his panchira fetish (panchira means "panty peek", and the chira in Chiranosuke means "peek"). Of course, he runs off with the panties in the end.<br><br>And just because he's his reincarnation, it doesn't mean they're the same character either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Chironosuke is reincarnation of Yuuta who already possessed very strong spirit power and can travel through time? Then he abadoned his body for new Yuuta who traveled back to tell the old ghost Yuuta about meteor? So basically we can assume that Yuuta and Chironosuke are both Pine from different time lines. Am I right?</br>  <br><br><br><br> It's a chinchilla, a kind of persian cat. <br><br>Didn't you listen to Ito? :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it takes 49 days to be reincarnated <br><br>It doesn't look like a newborn kitty</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Basically, Chiranosuke is what happens when Yuuta succeeds in stopping the meteor, but dies in the process. Even if the loop happened over 4 billion times, that's just 4 billion times for that Chiranosuke, that Yuuta that succeeded but died.<br><br>Now as for why he becomes a spirit later on to help Yuuta, that's also up for interpretation. It could be that Yuuta's spirit powers were high enough after dying. I also think that line Rabura throws out when exorcising Tsubouchi Qmay is interesting, when she splashes "God's sacred sake" on him, which is what Chiranosuke is always drinking.<br><br>Chiranosuke also talks about the "Human Preservation Project", which he could have come up with on his own, but it sounds like something he was collaborating on with someone else. If I had to guess, God. Now this gets into really speculative territory, but the game supposedly has 10 more episodes of content to it, and loops occur much more frequently.<br><br>God makes Chiranosuke a spirit so as to help Yuuta stop the extinction of humanity. That's probably what he did to the original Yuuta after VR-1 hit the first time, and then that Yuuta (or a later one) stopped it, became Chiranosuke, and then helped out future Yuutas. The big question here is how to end the loop.<br><br><br>It's a kitten, so it was born after Yuuta died, but it became his reincarnation then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rabura throws out when exorcising Tsubouchi Qmay is interesting, when she splashes "God's sacred sake" on him, which is what Chiranosuke is always drinking. <br><br>deep</br></br></br>      Is it gay to be attracted to chiyoko-yuuta and not chiyoko-guriko?  <br>Yes. We all thought he was a guy for almost 6 episodes</br>  Where IS the Punchline, damn it?!  <br>Do you think Chiranosuke mentors Yuta #6,373,153,741?</br>  <br> #6,373,153,742 <br>I mean</br></br>  can someone explain the finale for me please?  I knew it was going to be a buy the game for true ending yet I still watched it. I'm so pissed but damn it I'm going to have to buy the game now  <br>You mean #6,373,153,743, and I'm not sure, actually. Chiranosuke is present in the game, and he makes you pull pranks, but it's not like the Yuuta that just went back in time needs him there, though the now disembodied Yuuta might. If they can get a system going where each Yuuta tells the next everything that happens and what they need to know, they won't need Chiranosuke.<br><br>#6,373,153,740 = Previous Yuuta/Miyaken<br>#6,373,153,741 = The Yuuta we follow for the entire story<br>#6,373,153,742 = The Yuuta that goes back in time at the end of the anime (already received help from Chiranosuke as a spirit)<br>#6,373,153,743 = The newly disembodied Yuuta at the end of the anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  shit cat from shit show  <br> #6,373,153,742 = The Yuuta that goes back in time at the end of the anime (already received help from Chiranosuke as a spirit) <br><br>Chiranosuke gives the exact same rules to this Yuta, and approves his change in history?</br></br></br>  <br>meteor got destroyed<br><br>Earth is saved<br><br>The END</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually we know, that Yuuta's spirit power was exactly the same as Chiranosuke before VR-1 impact. He was almost or already god same as Chiranosuke but god can change nothing in this anime. <br><br>The biggest problem in interpetation is why Chiranosuke had memories from loops? But what if it was a lie? What if Yuuta in Chiranosuke reincarnation remember only 1 loop but he's lieing to increse ghost Yuuta and in the future, new Yuuta's morale? <br><br>I really don't think it's that deep because all Punchline budget went propably in last 2 episodes and it isn't good anime at all but it's funny to make interpretations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chiranosuke didn't tell Yuuta he wasn't allowed to change history until after he got his body back. If Chiranosuke isn't present for the coming Yuuta, he won't have to abide by those rules. He also knows pretty much all the important stuff that the previous Yuuta learned.</br>  <br>Damn, you're an expert at this. <br><br>The one thing I don't understand is, what was the point with Muhi? Should've used the bear to save Yuta with it's regeneration ability.</br></br></br>  <br>Chances are that Muhi will be more relevant for the game, but he also acts as a way to introduce Tsubouchi Qmay into the story.<br><br>Muhi is basically a W, and Tsubouchi thought that they needed him to create others, when Teraoka had done it already. Yuuta and Mikatan rejected the idea of becoming a W, as that would be basically accepting Qmay's ideals like Teraoka/Guriko. We also don't know how one actually becomes a W (hopefully it'll be elaborated upon in the game), or even what W is supposed to stand for, so I don't think that just having Muhi around would have been that helpful for Yuuta.<br><br>I'm assuming that Tsubouchi's plans were to possess Muhi himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubouchi's plans were to possess Muhi himself. <br><br>The bear can Uber too? That's be weird.</br></br></br>  I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna watch this shit for the first time. <br>What should I expect?</br>  <br>good meme but if your serious its like gay porn</br>  <br>Don't, watch something good like master of martial hearts or glasslip instead.</br>  <br>that's it? it's gay porn? that's what so horrible about it?<br>I'm disappointed. I'm going to watch the first episode now.</br></br>  <br>Pics+timestamp or it didn't happen</br>  It's okay. Very vanilla for this day and age.  I miss this show so much, I need a season 2 right now.  You need to play more Sega.   season 2 <br>In 14 years with kickstarter.</br>  Fuck EVERYTHING  Now post a WebM or fuck off. It's Queen Bee so it's automatically complete shit, but that's obviously a motion frame (which always look several times worse than everything else).  <br>New episode was due today, wasn't it? Given that it's Queen Bee, I don't know how to feel.</br>  Please tell me this isn't Queen's Bee version.<br><br>WHY DO THEY FUCKING STILL EXIST, HOW DO THEY THINK THEIR SHIT IS ACCEPTABLE?</br></br>  <br>Don't they just trace the scene from the manga, everything else is "motion frames"</br>  <br>They exist because they are the only option, so people fund them out of desperation. Since it costs nothing to make OVAs out of a handful of still images, that funding gives them several times multiplied profit.</br>  Is it on nyaa yet? I can't see it but I have a history of being retarded.

I don't know what you're saying</br>  can anyone explain to my why these "animation" style is so abundant now a days? is it just because it's cheap, because i don't see any other reason why someone would release this kind of shit.  <br>It's entirely because it's cheap. But people will still buy it because your dick turns off your eyes.</br>  <br>It's literally one studio that churns out this type of shit so i wouldn't really call it abundant.</br>  <br>Any idea when the next DR:2 is gonna get released?</br>  <br>they have been releasing a lot of shit lately, 1 or 2 every month for like the past year. I'd say that's abundant</br>  <br><br>Aqua Teen Hunger Force, no amount of marijuana can fix Futabu.</br></br>  <br>Natsukomi.Freshly posted on his BBS.</br>  I saw a GIF of a scene from Peace Hame. Did it get an animated adaptation?  <br>Could you be so kind as to fill me in? Can't read japanese, and google translate sucks ass. I need this like a crack addict in withdrawal.</br>  <br>No it did not.</br>  <br>Dammit</br>  Wait, wait, wait, wait...<br><br>Maybe it's all starting to blend together in my mind, but wasn't this a doujin series that came out within the last decade or so? And, is it a an anime series or some kinda hentai OVA?</br></br>  <br> I went to college. <br>I lost it.</br></br>  <br>the Peace Hame animation has been around for a while. it's shit though. they had a good start but then they reached the part with the Cheerleader and skipped every possible close up of her, so they skipped best girl at every chance they had and since it's like 6 episodes they had to cut a lot of the best girls in the manga.</br>  <br>Holy shit, I had no idea<br><br>I need to watch it, even if it's shit.</br></br></br>  <br> People hating balls on Futa <br><br>Uber gay.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah i guess you could get a good fap out of it, obviously depending on what girl you like the most</br>  <br> Balls <br> Not preferring your futas with magical semen portals instead </br></br>  <br>Pisu Hame deserves a proper adaptation.</br>  <br>Do you even futa anatomy?</br>  <br> multi-purpose gonad <br>Fucking stupid.</br></br>  Episodes 1-2 were amazing and then they just had to fuck up everything else  Just got done with the thing, I guess this was my first QB adaptation because holy shit I don't recall seeing this level of animation before. Even the previews for Kiniro Mosaic S2 were better than this, oh wow. And what was up with those dick sounds, penises are not made of rubber as far as I know.<br> that PS1 boot-up sound at the start <br>And thanks for the unexpected nostalgia.</br></br>  Holy hell this is terrible, I feel like it's a bunch of college students that got together to make a pseudo-slideshow.<br>Did they make this in flash?</br>  <br>but where's the nutbladder?</br>  <br> not labeling the mosaic </br>  <br>It gets better but it's been a while since I've seen it.</br>  <br>I don't even know what I'm looking at.</br>  Oh god this is pure gold  Ah. C'est moche.  <br>Too bad that's not what we're watching</br>  Oh shit  Last episode today in 2 hours. Is amami still cute?  <br>Dunno, but she's cute for Inoue, that's for sure.</br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  <br>Getting raped by invisible men and the only way to see them is through a cellphone camera.</br>  Finally this shit is over.  Is this the hidden show of the season?  Last week felt like the real finale<br><br>Is today basically an OVA type episode?</br></br>  <br>This is how Nagisa got pregnant.</br>  <br>I think it's a amusement park episode.</br>   people still haven't dropped this   <br>Nah, good yuri doujins when?</br>  <br>I don't think it's popular enough to sprout doujins. The manga looks different from the anime so I don't know how the styles would look.</br>  <br>The last few episodes have been quite good.</br>  I want to marry Hibiki.  <br>More best girl for me.</br>   you will never be this guy   <br>thanks god</br>  I want to marry Amami!  <br>No, but this anime is still shit.</br>    <br>You're shit</br>   that fucking ost      Holding hands all night     Don't open!  <br>I want to make Amami a single mom</br>  <br>Sorry, I'm not going to let you kill me.</br>  <br>"Tell me I asked for it."</br>    Gosh Amami is so cute.  <br>Jesus Christ that detail</br>  Was this show yuri? Because the first episode made it sound like it was.  <br>Why does it matter?</br>  <br>It isn't but it's cute regardless.</br>  <br>It's yuri of the blatant subtext kind. Mostly used for comedy, but there's a few plot points about it.</br>      <br>Yes. Cat agreed, don't bother him about it.</br>  So is neko-sama actually kill?<br><br>9/10 show would rewatch on Christmas</br></br>  they did it ALL night    <br>Nagisa who?</br>   [HorribleSubs] Re-kan! - 13 [720p].mkv   <br><br>Shut up, Narumi.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/wkaszwfjgv.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> everyone has better taste than me. </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  This is the worst goddamned yuri bait since Love Lab. I'll admit that Love Lab was my own fault, but this show has more yuri in it's OP than the entire season. Fuck this stupid show and fuck you Inoue for being such an annoying cunt.<br><br> yes I'm mad </br></br>   Worst girl gets pregnant <br>Dropped.</br>  Well, that's one way to cause a miscarriage.  <br>kek</br>  <br>You fucking pleb<br>Iwasawa is prime wife and mom material</br></br>  <br> dead <br> pregnant </br></br>  <br><br>I like you. If this weren't the Internet, I'd give you a highfive.</br></br>  <br> Worst girl <br> Implying implications </br></br>  <br>Wat.<br><br>How does one give birth in the afterlife? Would that mean that the life she gives birth to is dead already?</br></br></br>  will this vn have a TL?   voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro <br> worst girl <br><br>Impossibru.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish.</br>  Now I remember a novel about a woman who give birth in death state.<br><br>Incidentally, that woman is one of the wickedest witch and her children is suffering incarnate.</br></br>  Will Otonashi get to tap her?  <br>hopefully no.</br>  <br>It was already confirmed that the Yui route is Otonashi playing wingman of the year and hooking up Baseball dude and her together.</br>  <br>shouldn't she be gettin' it from the bule haired dude</br>  <br>Unfortunately no, in both her and Hinata routes you do wingman.</br>  So you can get pregnant afterlife?  <br>Nah, otonashi won't do that to his friend,right?</br>  how is gost babby formed???<br><br>how ded girl get pragnent?</br></br>  <br> no brojob route <br>boooo!</br></br>  <br>wow dude, I like ntr and even that is disgusting for me.</br>  <br>I watched this a long time ago, but weren't everybody in that space dead or in a comma like in lb? If so, how did she even got prego, in that shyamalan type of shit</br>  <br>Really?</br>   fistingtime.jpg   <br>let's be honest anyone would like to do that to yui, but I'll agree this is OOC for otonashi</br>   angel shits <br>No thank you</br>  <br>Wait, doesn't this would destroy the after life? How do you get a spirit pregnant? What the fuck?</br>  <br>Unless that is what you need to pass on .To give birth.I guess the baby is just an npc who died while really young and didnt have a nice childhood.</br>  <br>The ramifications of this are interesting.<br><br>You'd wonder whether Otonashi and Iwasawa might inadvertantly orphan the kid in a moment of post-birth pure happiness.</br></br></br>  So, they turned every girl other than Yui into a harlot?   No Judo guy or TK route with sex scenes <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br>Nope. We get another Episode 10.</br>      <br> 巡って流れて 時は移ろいだ<br>もう何があったか 思い出せないけど<br>目を閉じてみれば 誰かの笑い声<br>なぜかそれが今一番の宝物</br></br></br> </br>  So what's the fucking deal with TK? I want to be done with this shitty series, but I need to know more about him before I can get closure. Anything.  <br>TK is best grill, watch it for him.</br>  <br>So far out of the CG there's nothing noticeable. However as far as I've heard there's supposed to be something stored for him.</br>  <br>His route is not included in 1st beat, so... nothing for now.</br>  <br>yui best girl</br>  What took so long  <br>Hopefully all the other girl's routes will be romantic at least.</br>  <br>i literally cant even remember her<br><br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>I agree. It made sense that Yui's route wouldn't have romance but it would be disheartening if other girls didn't have the option.</br>  <br> worst girl <br> implying </br></br>  <br>She was the guitar girl with the drunk, abusive parents. She left in ep 3.  I liked her </br>  <br>He just wanted one last dance.</br>  No sex scene? or at least lewd illustration?    <br>This game not having h-scenes is maximum wasted potential</br>  Hope it will get a TL someday.  <br>I'd be 100% more interested if this is in english</br>  <br>Wait until it got translated. <br>Since Angel Beat have a relative popularity, its a matter of time till it get translated.</br></br>  <br>fuck, seriously? well I've lost all interest.</br>  <br>No cute small girls to impregnate.<br>This game has officially earnet the title shit.</br></br>    <br>Being a pedophile is wrong Anon.</br>  <br>better run that by the supreme court before you claim that anon.</br>  <br>How so? Who said so?<br>Certainly not God or the Holy Bible.</br></br>  <br>3D, yes. <br>But its totally ok to love lolis.</br></br>  <br>While 3D is PD by default, there's nothing inherently wrong with just being one.</br>  <br>Hey, this is surprisingly cute.</br>  <br>Considering Iwasawa never looked that happy in the anime, it is VERY cute</br>  <br>I heard he tried to save her girlfriend from mafia.</br>  <br>"His" ...anyway...he could not, i remember if he stopped dancing, the kill her... he was non stop for days, his last words were i will kiss you to her.... i dont know if it is truth or not, some anon post</br>  These fans really are the worst. Nothing more than little immature kids.  <br>Wow, they'll fit in very well on /a/.</br>  <br>What am I even looking at?</br>  <br>a bunch of little kids running to see a movie with 2d waifus and knocking everything in their path so they can get the best seats</br>  <br>I don't see anyone running.</br>  <br>In nipponese theaters, you have to reserve your seats before hand.</br>  <br>Idol otaku are subhuman filth.</br>  <br>Cleaning scattered paper is easier than cleaning food mess left behind by obese murrican.</br>  <br>Oh shit.</br>  Idol fans are the scummiest shit in the otaku world. This is a fact of life.<br><br>They're the kind of fans who stalk VAs and burn their blurays if another male aside from the self incert 'Producer' is introduced to the series.</br></br>  LL really keeps building a reputation for it's bad fans.  <br>Getting the best seat?<br>What?<br><br>They don't sell numbered seats?</br></br></br></br>  I have no clue why otaku are some of the most fucking ugly human beings in the world.<br>Even the worst of murrican landwhales don't get that bad.</br>  <br>I-is this also what a typical fujo looks like?</br>  <br>That's probably a man.</br>  How does this even happen. His facial structure is all kinds of fucked up.  Which Gatchaman would you Gatcha, /a/?  <br>Hajime-ssu, every time.</br>  <br>The one that provides me with endless fap fodder</br>  Is there still no subs for Insight ep 0?  <br> Katze just grabbing Hajime's boobs </br>  <br>I choose to believe that Katze is literally inhabiting Hajime's boobs.</br>  <br>No. Unless you want some spanish one. It's not something I'd worry about though. The dialogue isn't very heavy, so it's not too difficult to pick up on the plot by watching and listening carefully.</br>  <br>New duos are:<br><br> Hajime + New girl <br> Rui + O.D <br> Sugane + Joe <br> Usutsu + Paiman <br><br>I still find it absolutely disgusting that they would separate Usutsu from her parental figure, they should have just paired Rui with Paiman. I am glad Sugane gets to partner up with his role model, since Joe was the reason he become a Gatchaman and his character development with Hajime is pretty much done.<br><br>Hajime and Rui seem to have been partners for a year between S1 and S2. They seem to be really in sync in episode 0 so I wish we could have gotten to see them fighting together more</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Rui's going to be busy with the Orange dude for maximum fujobait.<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  O.D is best bird  I forgot this was coming out, I loved the first season.  <br>Cthuko are working on it, but they usually take a really long time to release stuff, I doubt it will be released before ep 1 comes out</br>  I fear this new girl will end up with Rui because of her color scheme.  Can't wait for more threads  I just want to see Hajime's huge tits. That is the sole reason I will watch. We got almost no fanservice of her in S1. This will be the year.  <br>and that booty</br>  <br>What? That doesn't make much sense</br>  <br>what are you talking about</br>  <br>Hajime a shit. A shiiiiiiit.</br>  Post 'em!    <br>I laughed way more than I should have</br>    <br> Both are the best girl. </br>  <br> Hibiki <br> girl <br>U wot m8?</br></br></br>  A lovely cat and a lovely  Precure Thread !
