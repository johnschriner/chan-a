[ New Onepunch Man teaser<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qea<wbr>FvbUi7mU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Well this actually looks good.  <br> those sloppy effects <br> shitty coloring <br> CG backgrounds <br><br>Yeah, not having much hopes for this one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wow this is amazing</br>  It looks amazing.   mosquito girl is white <br>Fucking dropped.<br><br> I liked it. </br></br></br>  <br>Looks better than the first PV did. Still that smoke at the start makes me scratch my chin in worry</br>  <br>Looks pretty good.</br>  YES<br><br>DELICIOUS JUNK FOOD</br></br>  <br>That's pretty lame if that's the best looking stuff they have to show for a pv</br>  <br> spouting buzzwords <br><br><br>Yeah, me too<br>Also all the secondary shitposting that's sure to ensue</br></br></br></br></br>  I am excite  Voices match the characters pretty well.<br>Also inb4 shitting on madhouse and torrents of buzzwords because jelly</br>  looks really cheap visually but maybe because the manga looks so good in comparison  As long as the fight scenes are animated well, I dont give a damn.  <br>that face...</br>  They look like they understand the balance between the well animated scenes and making Saitama look like some bald asshole drawn in MS Paint. I'm so excited  <br>The smoke CGI is pretty bad though, I mean it's not Death Knight in Overlord bad, but still not great.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>The atmosphere is great as well. The first teaser made it seem like it´s super serious. But this is just as it should be.<br><br>Meant to ask for a while now. Will this really be the opening song? I sure hope so, it´s awesome.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pV5<wbr>1TIs-Izw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Death Knight in Overlord was great though.<br>Not as great as something like the suits in Gatchaman, but for a one time thing it was pretty well done.</br></br>  <br>I'm still not feeling his voice.</br>  <br>I think it's okay, if you have to cut budget somewhere, cut the lower priority effect.</br>  <br>Dude it looked AWFUL it ran at less of a framerate than going through Blight town in Dark Souls, on a PS3, and looked so low poly and fake.</br>  <br>Go see a doctor</br>  <br> Licenseless rider <br>Anime is saved. The action scenes look really promising, this will turn out great.<br><br> Muh buzzword fest. </br></br></br></br>  So do we know how far it's going to go. Are we going to get to Sea King or even to Boros?  <br> look at me, I hate everything, am I cool now guys? </br>  <br>Sounds like the most generic motherfucker ever<br>...<br>IS PERFECT!</br></br></br>  <br>Since Tatsumaki is in I assume it's to Boros</br>  <br>Chapters are not that long so I guess this will make it to Boros.</br>  <br>I was keeping my hype low to not be disappointed, but this teaser showed me I don't have to worry.</br>  <br>And why is that?</br>  <br> Mosquito </br>  Fuck, looks great.<br><br>Also, seems like the special chapter with the B class is confirmed. A bit weird they would only show Tatsumaki when Fubuki appear in it as well.</br></br>  <br>No, that's a fanmade opening made quite some time ago</br>  HOLY SHIT, THE NEW MURATA CHAPTER IS OUT AS WELL.<br><br>  M..aybe chapter 102 too <br>  nope <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Great, I was really looking forward to that arc being animated but I thought I was going to have to wait till season 2 if at all.</br></br>  <br>  8 pages <br>  no metal bat </br></br>  Looks pretty fucking hype  <br>The low poly itself isn't a bad thing.<br><br>Whoever the low framerate and the fact that they didn't polished the texture was a real bad move.</br></br></br>  <br>Thats what you fucking get for playing in consoles, peasant.</br>  so if the show is about a dude who can kill anything with one punch, whats the conflict?<br><br>Him being sad that there's no challenge for him? Yawn. This better just be an OVA then</br></br>  <br>Dude even on PC Blight Town ran sub 30.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  My dick is ready.  <br> Mom, Im baiting! </br>        <br>It won't be as good as the godlike manga but this looks very good.</br>  Guys I got a raging boner since I saw and heard Tatsumaki in that PV.<br>What should I do?</br>  <br>I like this fan made video's music though<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm245<wbr>38161</wbr></br></br>  <br>She can suck my blood anytime.</br>  <br><br>same is true of just about every Anime adaptation. This one looks like it will at least be worth watching though.</br></br>  <br>I want to paint her face white</br>  <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>All is lost.</br></br>  <br> whats the conflict? <br>The problem occur where the said dude doesn't present.</br></br>  <br>Remind yourself that she won't apply to your fetish beyond the ones she already fulfills.<br> I'll never get Fu and Tatsu using psychic powers to get tubby </br></br>  <br> &gt;CG backgrounds <br>This is the only thing that really sucks. <br>I'm getting really tired from samey looking low quality CG backgrounds</br></br></br>  <br> all that blood on the building Saitama slapped Mosquito Girl through <br>This is the feeling of sadness.</br></br>  <br> No Fubuki <br><br>So I guess they might not animate the side chapter.<br>Also I expected Tats to sound bitchier, or maybe just older</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128845646 <br><br><br>The digital coloring is genuinely lousy though. It's really bland.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks better than the first.<br><br>The new chapter is out, I'll post it here.</br></br></br>    <br>  Those lined 3D models <br><br>This a joke right ?</br></br></br>  <br>Charanko getting bullied, huh?</br>  <br>Thats how most if not every incoming anime will be, get over it nerd, its 2015 already.</br>    This looks great. And I'm going away, because the ebin badhouse memers are here  <br>what is up with this page, the characters in the crowd looked really lazy drawn<br>just compare it to how he(or rather his assistant) usually draws them like here </br></br>    <br>Huh. I just noticed that the sky and ground were split in Saitama and Genos' meeting scene. Wonder what happened.</br>  <br>I'm not expecting it to be on par with a KyoAni show, but at least it wouldn't hurt to have competent color direction.</br>  <br><br><br>For some reason he decided to make it with a 3d program.</br></br></br>  <br>But KyoAni is shit. They haven't made a good anime in years</br>  <br> so if the show is about a dude who can kill anything with one punch, whats the conflict? <br> whats the conflict <br><br>Maybe read the manga and stop shitposting.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>haha, good luck waiting for that one retarded studio who would paint every cel just to appease your traditionalist bullshit</br></br>    <br>They probably just fought right at the equator, where the two halves of the Earth meet. That's actually what it's like there.</br>  <br> literally actually replying to this bait to start a conflict with One Punch Man and KyoAni <br><br>Anon, you're better than that.</br></br></br>  <br>that those fantasy buildings are made with a 3dprogram is not unusual for this manga(all the hero association buildings are done that way) but even the crowd?</br>    Could be worse. Will always be worse than the redraw/original.  <br>Get a better rig.<br><br> it dropped frames big time though </br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's irrelevant to the topic at hand.<br><br><br>I never implied that only cel painting is able to provide good colors. Digital can do it as well yet Madhouse dropped the ball in this aspect. But then again I shouldn't be surprised given how ugly the colors are in most of their other shows like HxH.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll take the other sister, thanks.</br>  <br>Say what?</br>     that extremely generic voice on Saitama <br><br>It's perfect.</br></br>  <br>Looks fuckin awesome</br>  <br> Komachi is love, Komachi is live, Komachi is a miracle of the universe </br>  <br>looks bland as fuck, just like the manga</br>  <br>another member of the Chinner family?</br>  <br>Saitama's cover is already blown.</br>  Why is this series so popular?  <br> color direction <br>Post your art</br></br>  <br>You'd need a higher budget than a lot of hollywood movies (and to start like 7 years before it airs to dodge production issues) to get a TV show that's as high quality as Murata's version<br>I may be exaggerating, but the point is that the way anime production works, it would be pretty hard to get a show that's as good looking as Murata's OPM redraw</br></br>  <br>It's fun and doesn't take itself seriously</br>  TRANSLATION WHEN  <br>Next chapter in two weeks.</br>  Pacing is quick as expected, an extremely average voice for Saitama, and the battle goes from looking "tense" to just a quick battle. I love it.  <br>In every chapters I'm hoping he'll have to resign to not have any more of this tournament shit.</br>   deep voiced sonic <br>so much for the trapmode</br>  <br>thx anon</br>  <br><br>Oh good. He's just not the same without the bald.</br></br>  <br>All<br>is <br>Lost</br></br></br>  <br><br>dafuq</br></br>  How many minutes will they do?  <br>Imagine all the anime only fags who won´t get the point of OPM.</br>  <br>saitama will take care of that</br>  <br>I hope this is just a sample of what is to be transmitted, and that the final product has better quality</br>  <br>It's funny, a good parody, light hearted, and showcases some great artwork.<br><br><br>This series was made to have a dumb tournament arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it won't, so you better stop now</br>  <br> Imagine all the anime only fags who won´t get the point of OPM. <br><br>Of course they won't. the excuse nowadays for anime only fags is "What's the point of reading the manga, when I can just watch the anime?"</br></br></br>  <br> Madhouse <br> second season <br>Good luck wtih that.</br></br></br>  <br>  This series was made to have a dumb tournament arc. <br><br>Giving us that just before the MA arc is just teasing.</br></br></br>  Is Sawano doing the OST? Sounds like Sawano cheesy music.  <br> Holy shit, this is the biggest trainwreck I've seen in years. Disregarding for a moment the nonsense plot, the whole directing is completely rubbish. No sense of flow, no aesthetics, it's just random pandering scenes pieced together in a desperate attempt to make some money from the degenerate otaku. Don't even get me started on all the bloom and blur, the terrible CGI, all the forced animation, etc. </br>  http://www.redbubble.com/people/fen<wbr>gsong/works/9963319-onepunch-oppai?<wbr>p=t-shirt&amp;style=mhoodie&amp;body_color=<wbr>white&amp;print_location=front<br><br> tfw it doesn't come in yellow </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  FUCK YEAR  <br>Are you the same guy thats saying this crap in the Overlord threads too?</br>  Sonic talking was kinda shit and I don't know why they advertise Tatsumaki when she didn't do anything in Murata version but other than that it looks quite decent  Looks pretty awful. Maybe /a/ will like it since it's just storyboards copied from the manga and everyone here thinks that 1:1 adaptation = good.  <br><br>uhm.... nope</br></br>  <br>she is the only main girl that appeared in the first 8 volumes of the manga, of course they are going to highlight her, even if she barely appears.</br>  <br>Fubuki a better.</br>  <br>fine, but you will just be wasting your own time you know<br>it's like you are standing on the railroad and see the train comic, but you keep on standing there. Eventually it will run you over, and what have you gained by doing that? Nothing</br></br>  VA's are terrible for the characters but I'll get over it, Looks fucking nice, Can't wait for the Sea King part to be done.<br><br><br>All them shitty colors for it, Holy fuck. 30 pound is pretty cheap though but them colors are nasty.</br></br></br>  <br>Fubuki appear in a special chapter along with Tatsumaki way before the Boros arc though.</br>  <br>better or not, she doesn't appear until much much later, she will probably not appear in the anime at all, since it will most likely end at the boros arc</br>  <br>Sonic with the voice of Eren from Attack on Titan, what were they thinking?!<br>I'm fine with Madoka as Tatsumaki.</br></br>  <br>This is one of the rare instances where I've read a fuck ton of the source material first.</br>  <br>please tell me thats serious series : serious chair balance swivle</br>  <br><br>They don't fucking come in Yellow and that makes me mad. I wonder if there's another place to do it.</br></br>  <br>Tatsumaki is getting an expanded role in the anime.</br>  <br>which will most likely not appear in the anime, and tatsumaki had way more screentime even during that one oneshot</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you linking the fake one?</br>  <br>God is real.</br>  <br>Kaji Yuuki is good with edgy characters.</br>  <br><br>It's a good point though.</br></br>  <br>Posted it behind your cheek.</br>  <br><br>No, it's not. you'd have people whining "When is a 2nd season going to come? why does it take so long? Manga is boring because it doesn't move, have sound, or voices." <br><br>Which is all bullshit. you want pisspoor budget because you have A.D.D?</br></br></br></br>  Soon.  <br>This is the real one<br>https://bvc.bandaivisual.co.jp/feat<wbr>ure/146/</wbr></br></br>  So House of Evolution confirmed.<br><br>Not sure how I feel about Tatsumaki's voice, but Licenseless Rider is definitely welcome. I figure the backstory chapter is in the first episode. Wonder where the Personification of a Light Pull Cord comes in.</br></br>  <br>x10 better than the original pv, this maybe end up being a good adaptation</br>  <br>Sonic looks too masculine. I wasn't confused at all. Dropped.</br>  <br>Yeah the wicked humor and deep philosophical implications of this series are too much for filthy anime only plebs.<br>Obviously all those things could only be expressed through the subtleties inherent to the medium of manga anyway.</br></br>  <br>They should have chosen someone with a voice more effeminate, or even better, having a woman doing it.<br>This ruin the whole gag of not knowing what's his gender.</br></br>  <br>so so</br>    BDs when ?!  <br>That was never a gag</br>  <br>The best.</br>  <br>What is he thinking about?</br>  What moments are you looking forward to? <br><br>The anime better do justice when the Ninja hops around the trees and the camera follows Saitama's eyes and him at the same time</br></br>      <br>being bald</br>  <br>Effeminate Sonic is Murata only dude, it was never a joke to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Is it wrong to want both?</br></br>  <br> The anime better do justice when the Ninja hops around the trees and the camera follows Saitama's eyes and him at the same time <br><br>You know damn well it's going to be CGI.</br></br></br>  <br>How can one girl be so best?</br>    <br>  I know ;_;  </br>  <br> What moments are you looking forward to? <br><br>You just posted it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the green hair.</br>  <br>No, both sisters are acceptable.</br>  <br>It doesn't sound like Sawano to me.</br>  <br>It's the everything.</br>  <br>Can't wait for Murata Psykos to have the Esper pussy trio.</br>  <br>He is jumping from the moon here, right?</br>  <br><br>i don't see why it should be</br></br>  <br>JUSTICE SHALL BE DONE</br>  <br>So Licenseless Rider's glorious victory will be recorded on film?</br>    Anime PV2 looks great <br>  meanwhile <br>  no ch.102 in sight <br>  no ONE HURRICANE 2 in sight <br>  Murata release is 8 pages long of tornament fillershit, no Metal Bat either <br><br>I have mixed feelings.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i will settle for this actually</br>    <br>Look at this <br>Saitama colored looks like shit in the PV, except for some shots like the one in OP.<br><br><br>Mahouka is getting a second season, and Ace of Diamond is near 100 episodes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>subs when?</br>  <br><br>How can Murata draw so damn good? The punches really feel like they're moving. The way people get knocked back or fly really fast and especially the scenery.</br></br>  It looks good.<br>I'm happy.<br>That's all.</br></br>  <br>prob not. on the moon he was holding his breath so buffed up cheeks</br>  <br>Madhouse always has shitty sound effects. Remember Parasyte? Shit sounded terrible.</br>  <br>im am so fucking excited</br>  <br>Well, it is Badhouse. You can't expect much out of their adaptations.</br>  <br>No, I think it's from the Meteor arc </br>  <br>Will Fubuki be voiced by Yui Horie?</br>     saitama visuals <br> those voices <br>I don't want to see Fubuki, my dick will explode.</br></br>  <br> Saitama colored looks like shit in the PV <br>Do you even know how to draw, retard? Or you think that this  is easy to colour in animation? Fuckin kids from elflands.</br></br>  <br>no it's from when he killed beefcake</br>  1 cour or 2 cour?  <br>  "When is a 2nd season going to come? why does it take so long? Manga is boring because it doesn't move, have sound, or voices."  <br><br>Do these people even have any influence to begin with?</br></br></br>  I never know if I should read the manga before watching the anime.<br>I had it in my backlog for some time, but kind of hadn't come to read it.<br>So what do you think, read or wait?</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself already speedreader.</br>    <br>Wait, reading the manga first will only make the anime more disapointing.<br>But if you watch the anime first and don't like it, give the manga a shot anyway, even if you only do it for the art. (Murata's version)<br>If you read the manga and enjoy it because of the humor/story, go further and read ONE's version.</br></br></br>  <br>Is blizzard of Hell going to be in it?</br>  <br>Hey I actually enjoyed ONE's OPM. This doesn't affect me at all.</br>  Fucking Sawano. OPM deserves better than your shit that literally sounds the same in every show you do.<br><br>Disturbingly little animation in the trailer, too. Madhouse, what are you doing?!</br></br>  <br>  asking this seriously <br><br>In 99% of the cases people will obviously tell you to read the original.</br></br></br>   That mosquit girl <br> That tatsumaki " fuyukai" <br><br>My penis is very hard.</br></br></br>  <br> easy to colour in animation <br>Not easier than picking a random skin color and using it in every single scene.</br></br>  <br>Is it even confirmed that it's Sawano or are you just shitposting?<br>And there's some subtle animation that I didn't expect, like that crowd at the beginning. Thank God it isn't CG like in Parasyte, that was terrible.</br></br>  <br>I know, but I just want to be sure because of the reasons<br><br>has given.<br>Maybe reading the manga first could make me disappointed with the anime.<br><br>But I think I'll read the manga first after all, as I am a bit bored, and the trailer made me excited.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the actual manga has a serious action sequence once in a blue moon. Most of the gag stuff is obviously not going to be excellent sakuga. Murata's excellent visuals aside, it's a comedy manga with a quirky premise, and it's being marketed as such.</br>  <br> being jelly of deadhouse <br>only if i`d want my favorite source material butchered by cheap made by korean cup noodle slaves</br></br>  <br> so if the show is about a dude who can kill anything with one punch, whats the conflict? <br>The dudes who can't.</br></br>  <br><br>This "will be disapointed by Anime" reasoning is stupid, you'll still be disapointed either way if you begin with it or not, having the best experience in first is obviously the most logical choice, and the Anime isn't even out yet anyway.</br></br>  <br>Too bad she gets killed.</br>  Should have been Mappa doing this. Fucking deadhouse.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128849371   <br> Bandai visual <br>It's shit isn't?</br></br>  <br>This, plus there's no guarantee that you'll like the manga more than the anime anyway. Like I rewatched Beck recently and I enjoyed it a lot, so I looked in the archive for general opinions and discussion. Like usual, mangafags claiming source is superior so I thought I'd give it a shot. Dropped that shit a few chapters in.</br>  I think I have the answer for the people itt leaping behind, fearing Muratas art will spoil them too much. <br>Read ONEs version and wait for the anime. If you are dissappionted, Muratas stuff's still there and also closer to ONEs progress than it is now.</br>  <br>We think alike.<br><br>I picked the manga up because I saw a picture of her and stopped reading shortly after she got swatted, in my mind I just pretended she got Team Rocketed and didn't necessarily die.<br><br>Looks like the Anime is far less ambiguous in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br>  Didn't know so many people liked the mosquito girl.  <br>So you mean a meme, meme, and another meme?</br>  <br>Am I the only one who is mostly excited for animated Genos being all drama voice acting and serious buisiness?</br>  <br>She's no less than 9th ranked in the popularity poll, that's quite something.</br>  <br> the next one to appear will be a woman <br> despite have a nutsack for a chin, she will actually be attractive <br>I don't think I'll be ready</br></br></br>  <br>SHEET, I missed that.</br>  <br><br>I think people are just thinking too hard on pointless shit and giving random ass advice they didn't use themselves. Just read/watch whatever you want. I started with Murata and finished ONE's and re-read them like 7 times and I'm going to watch the anime even if the adaptation is shit, and I won't regret a single second of it.</br></br>  <br>He uses photoshop or something for the motion blur and stuff, but still he's pretty damn good</br>  <br>The wait is ending. <br>My hype is overflowing.</br></br>  <br> meh effects <br> respect the artstyle <br>sort of want.jpg<br> sonic doesnt have a trap voice <br>dropped<br>i'll stick with murata/ONE<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pV5<wbr>1TIs-Izw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pre-hair loss Saitama is GAR as fuck.  <br>I'll never understand the popularity of this fansong, it's terrible.</br>  <br>I'm betting asteroid scene</br>  <br>Faggot<br>You don't understand the sweetness about the deep voice of sanic.<br><br><br>It's not that bad, good montage and french circlejerking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's too popular and wouldn't fit as the opening at all.

You are just as retarded as this guy  throwing random buzzwords and all</br>  Some sweet MAD video got uploaded recently by the way.<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm260<wbr>15497<br><br>Also, for those who are thirsty for some Anime Fubuki the animator guy who was working of the fan opening uploaded a speedraw video with her :<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm259<wbr>56542</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I thought the Bee Queen was Yellow/Back, not Black grey this whole time.</br>  <br>It's not a bee</br>  <br> bee </br>  <br>I'd like this character more if it wasn't for boa.</br>   Tatsumaki introduced <br> no sister in sight, despite her being shown first in the manga. <br><br>directors = Tatsumaki-fags confirmed.<br><br> me too. </br></br></br></br></br>  My dick is ready   sonic speed <br> not speed of sound sonic <br><br>Dropped</br></br></br>  <br>when he beats boros</br>  <br>He said exactly what he says in the manga.</br>  <br>What? You thought that the japs would have a character not be white? What are you high?</br>  <br>Director have superior taste.<br>Also Tatsumaki rol expanded.</br></br>  <br>i was hoping it would be more stylized but normal is fine too</br>  <br>fubuki was just shown in silhouette until volume9, if you don't count the oneshot which barely had any screentime of fubiki much less part of the proper story.</br>  <br>there are many black characters in animes but not common brcause thete are actually not many black people in japan</br>  <br>thats a guy</br>  <br>God i hope this ends up like Overlord</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>Even better</br>  <br>It should stay white only.</br>  <br>considering she looks exactly like in the manga, i figured that anon just worded his complain a bit wrong and meant that she should be more colored, like, i don't know, yellow or green or something</br>  <br>nothing</br>  <br> white weight lifter <br> Tanktop jobber <br> black weight lifter <br> Glorious Darkshine <br><br>Black power</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The webcomic is funnier<br>The remake is visually stunning<br>Why would I watch a 3rd version of onepunch man? Is it going to combine the best of both versions but not perfect it? Not excited tbh.</br></br></br>  This is made by madhouse right?<br>I expect better coloring from them. But oh well the rest is better than I expected.</br>  Filthy secondary reporting in.  <br> Sawano <br><br>I swear if Sawano is composing OnePunch Man I'm going to be so fucking mad. His OST does not have any variety in them they all sound like the same shit. Seriously fuck the OST if it's by him. <br><br> Sawano Composes the OST <br><br>Well the OST is going to be shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't you watch a 3rd version of OPM?</br>  <br>Some parts sound a bit like his work, but I wonder why they didn't announce him so far if it's really him. He's a good commercial argument. Maybe to have other big announcements to keep the hype machine up?</br>  <br>Asura Rhino</br>  <br> His OST does not have any variety in them they all sound like the same shit <br> I've never listen to a Sawano OST outside of the popular anime he was in. <br><br>If only you knew how bad the sound directors are when they work with Sawano. He produce a shitload of excellent tracks in most of his OSTs, but the sound director fucks everything because muh epic choirs and muh insert songs.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Genos so moe?  <br>The death punch saitama gives genos only to flick him in the forehead</br>  <br>Sensei doesn't care about him.</br>  Will they animate this?  <br>no</br>    <br>I posted earlier in this thread that I didn't think it sounded like Sawano, but now I do hear some electronic sound effects at the beginning of the second track played in the trailer. Although I can't really compare these tracks heard in this trailer to any tracks I've heard in his osts.</br>  <br>Still not really understanding that complaint when the KLK ost had plenty of variety.</br>  <br>lolis are love, lolis are life</br>  It's not Sawano. That orchestra doesn't sound loud enough and those drums sound cheap as fuck. If there's one thing Sawano does well, it's his drums. They have their own distinct sound.<br><br>If anything, it's a wannabe Sawano.</br></br>  It isn't nearly as bad as I imagined it to be.<br>The character designs seemed to be closer to the manga than they were in the preview pics we got and the animation is decent enough.</br>  <br>  Ba-Baka </br>  <br>Only if she lezzes out over her sister.</br>  <br>wrong yellow</br>  remember to filter all posts containing ''baaaaaaww its not the same as the manga'' to have quality threads  I hate to be that guy but OPM really needs animation and drawings on par with Akira.  <br>The conflict comes when the guy's not there. And from curiosity of finding an enemy on the same level as him.<br><br>That being said OPM is only really popular because of how great the drawings are</br></br></br>  <br>I think if you kill a good character really early then people will always remember him and all.<br><br>Kinda like how Zabuza and Haku were the most popular characters for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Those violins and the drums in 0.55 sounds really like one of his works, but yes, you're right, some parts really are different of typical Sawano.</br>  <br>She was super interesting indeed, no wonder people didn't forget about her.</br>  Why the new chapter is so disappointing?  <br>This is actually the real one. Looks good tbh.</br>  <br>Because you want something to complain about.</br>  <br>Who is doing this boring filler? Garou vs 2 Master when? Monster war when?</br>   madhouse <br>not even going to read the manga at this point now.</br>  <br>way too few pages ad nothing interesting happening.<br><br>Frankly, I don't get why ONE is doing that. There are already plenty enough of good heroes and vilains we're just waiting for to get screentime and interactions with Saitama. Who the fuck care about this weird ass martial artist guy who just appeared and won't be relevant ? We just had Metal Bat in the last one, why not continuing with this ? Or if it's just to get more content done before the MA why not make some side stories with S class heroes that doesn't apppear in it ?<br><br>Meanwhile every chapters in the original since the MA arc where really cool and we directly got Fubuki and Tatsumaki back. What we're getting at the moment in Murata's version is really disapointing and boring.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not even going to read the manga at this point now. <br>LMAO<br>M<br>A<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  looks fucking great. trailer seemed to focus on his sidekick though  <br>hittler duck always get me</br>  <br>The effects animation looks good to me.</br>  <br> This better just be an OVA then </br>  <br> Who is doing this boring filler <br>The author of the manga.<br><br> Master when? Monster war when? <br>Right now. Open the original and read it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you be this retarded?</br>  The filler is so shit, even if it's mad by ONE.  <br>How can you be such a whiny baby?</br>  <br>Crowd looks really sloppy</br>  <br>What, traps with husky voices are god tier.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>5 fight DAMN<br><br>How many chapter this tournament SHIT arc is going to take ?</br></br></br>  <br>meh</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>long enough for the anime to play through and people to catch up to the original version so there's not spoilers floating around.</br>  <br>For what?</br>  <br> Animeonlyfags <br><br>How many animeonlyfags are in this thread?<br><br>The new chapter is not that good by the way. Why the fuck he decided to do a tournament arc before the Monster Arc?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Animeonlyfags <br><br>Do you even know how to use a meme properly? For fuck's sake.</br></br></br>   being excited for meme anime   <br>See<br/></br>  ITT: impacient entiteld fucks<br><br>Just be happy there's more OPM and above all, be happy Murata is the one drawing it.</br></br>  <br> Mangafox <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>They all just want Unicorn Sawano or in the fuck up of KLK want him to imitate Iwasaki for whatever reason</br>  <br>I know man<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ykj<wbr>Vykdl8mk</wbr>  [ ]<br>I can barely believe this came from him<br>And why is everyone assuming Sawano is doing the OST?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I can make my text green too anon does that mean my opinion matters? </br></br>  <br>Easier to start shitposting</br>   Licenseless Rider <br> Animation looks pretty good <br>Well that's all I needed</br></br>  <br>What is the point of this existing when it will never live up to the amazing shit the manga put out?</br>  Imagine how ONE is feeling right now. He wrote something that has an anime now, he's a legit mangaka, a force to be reckoned with.  <br><br>Fuck this show.<br><br>I'd rather have another generic battle harem with a bland-as-fuck MC, along with a cookie-cutter female cast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking this</br>  <br>I don't think my dick will be able to handle Fubuki animated</br>  Fuck Attack on Titan, THIS is the shit.

Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.   two best girls <br><br>Blasphemy. There can be only one.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is bestest.</br>  Are you staying hydrated, /a/?  Is Yui still in love with Hikki? It seems to me she fell out of love with him.  Err, why make a BTB thread then make this? <br>It's like you want stuff to get pruned.</br>  Needed reminder. Iroha a shit.  So someone fill me in because I don't usually lurk in Yahari threads. Has the final volume come out? What happened to the "I want to kill this focking cunt"? Is Haruno still the Joker?  <br><br><br>I hope you both live long and fulfilling lives. If you really feel the need to vent your frustrations here, then I understand. Just try to keep your friends and family out of it.</br></br></br>   contaminating Yui with your dirty Yukino  <br><br>Get out. Perfection must not be sullied.</br></br>  <br> Has the final volume come out? <br>No.<br> What happened to the "I want to kill this focking cunt"? <br><br> Is Haruno still the Joker? <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're entitled to your opinion but I must insist that if you truly appreciate Yui then you should also appreciate her best friend, Yukino.</br>  <br> both  <br>So you want one of us to die? Which one?<br> It's the yuckyno guy isn't it. </br></br></br>  <br> good irohasu post <br> irohasu hydration post <br> venting frustrations <br>Come on dude, please tell me that's bait.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino a SHIT <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  Reminder that ZR is god's greatest gift to humanity  Too fucking many Yahari threads already.  <br> Implying there's ever enough  <br>This is one ride that won't ever end.</br></br>  <br>  <br>I'll take that as a yes, then.<br><br><br>It appears that OP wanted this to be a Yui and Yukino-only thread but neglected to specify as such.</br></br></br></br></br>  Posting to appreciate my Goddess.  <br><br>Surely we can talk this out like adults? How about you each explain you're viewpoints and provide evidence from the series to back up your claims?</br></br>  <br>If she is so perfect why is the only thing she's good at is spinning bowls?</br>  Is Yukino actually Spyro's waifu or just his favorite Yahari?  <br><br>Either way he has shit taste.</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>What's the /thread for, anon?</br></br>  I agree that she's in a tough spot right now but she has a lot of potential for a come back.  <br>Anon, she has a kind heart and tries her hardest. Not everyone can be born a genius, that's the sad truth, but in terms of personality she's an S+.<br><br>I do not however endorse  inflammatory post.</br></br></br>  <br>The same OP who thought he could still delete a thread HOURS after creation ??</br>  <br><br>What girls the fanbase likes have nothing to do with what the girls think of each other. See Saekano, even though Megumifags and Eririfags hate each other, Megumi and Eriri are best friends.</br></br>  <br><br>Haruno should just cuck Yukino, maybe that will jolt her out of her dependency issues.</br></br>  <br> See Saekano, even though Megumifags and Eririfags hate each other, Megumi and Eriri are best friends <br>I used to think Saekano was the worst fanbase of the year.<br>Then I came here.</br></br></br>  <br>This is officially pasta as of now.</br>  Perfection.  <br>She's already done it through her keikaku.</br>  <br>Another one for the pile.<br><br><br>The only fanbase that compares to this is Haganai, and since it's been so long since it happened, I'm not sure which is worse.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Embarrassing samefag.</br></br>  <br>She could make a comeback, but exactly comeback to what?<br>In Destinyland it was hinted that the real Yukino is actually pretty childlike, when she can't keep up with her mature way of speaking and mannerism, she stutters stumbles over her own words and gets scared.<br><br>Hopefully she does return to the way she was at the end of S1, she confident in herself and trusted her friends working along side them rather than depend on them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno end would also be way, way better than any of the other 3 ends.<br>And let's not forget about the possible wonderful reaction from the cunt.<br>Quadruple-butt-frustration.</br></br></br>  <br>Haganai was a huge waste of time in retrospect. It doesn't even have Yahari's excuse of "muh relatable MC" and most of the girls really were garbage, one-note characters. I will never understand how it got so popular.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Repost <br> Not even new IP <br>Gee, I wonder who THIS could be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly want the cunt to come on top now that I'm convinced that he is the most miserable one in the Oregairu cast.</br>  <br>Fuck off Cuckinofag.</br>  <br> buttflustered Yukinofag </br>  <br>I'm grateful for these threads because they were the shitposting magnets of last season and kept the rest of the board relatively clean.</br>  I think they're an excellent match for each other. They can relate to each other quite well, they share similar interests, have unique and compelling conversations, they are both attracted to eachother, and they already have a strong friendship from all the problems they've worked through together in the club.<br><br>It would be amazing to finally see them start dating after they fulfill each other's requests.</br></br>  <br><br>Looks like I got my answer.</br></br>  <br>Yes, let the best flow through you</br>  <br><br>I would like it if all the things Hachiman gave her were brought up again (assuming they end up together)<br><br> Destinyland picture in their living room <br> Pan-san 8man gave her on display <br> 8man's tshirt on Yukino's closet </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is THK. Because somebody had to say it.</br>  <br><br>They will have the cutest daughter.</br></br>  <br>Of course you did.</br>  <br>Give it time. It's not like it hasn't happened before.</br>    <br> Screencap meaning anything </br>  <br> Dyed blonde hair <br>No matter how hard Hayato will try to hide it he knows deep down she will never be his.<br> ;-; </br></br></br>  <br>Not a Yukinofag, but those fucking glasses.<br><br>Also, Yukino needs to wear her hair back a lot more.</br></br></br>  <br>Wearing her hair like in Kyoto, with her pink scrunchie, PC glasses, and in 8man's class t-shirt.</br>  <br>You son of a bitch. That gif distracted me so much that I completely forgot what image I'm about to post.<br><br>Only one way to find out I guess.</br></br></br>  <br> inspect element <br>nice try</br></br>  <br>Best hair she wore in series by far. Holy shit</br>  <br> space between hashmark and (You) <br>Ya blew it</br></br>  <br><br>Not even going to bite.</br></br>    <br> that gif <br>my dick</br></br>  <br>Didn't realize until now.  was meant for .</br>  <br>But you replied.</br>  Is Yui wearing colored contacts? I notice a lot of artwork shows her with blue eyes but the anime shows her with reddish eyes.  <br>In the LN her eyes are blue, in the anime they're supposedly brown.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128824236 <br>I think we're all very much tired of dubs threads, but I appreciate your enthusiasm.</br>  I still can't fucking believe this. How?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128824236 <br>I'm an idiot for not noticing.</br>  .   "instead of solving your differences between yourselves be genuine. I have no clue what has been bothering the two of you but you should remain genuine" <br>8man is an asshole.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128824236 <br>Yes, Haruno. Fapped to your sister.</br>  <br>He's not forcing them to be genuine. They all want the same thing.</br>  <br>What's with Yukino's lack of reaction to this, she didn't get mad, she didn't blush, she just kind of stared back.<br>The second time he stares that intently does it she doesn't pay it any mind.<br>Third time she just casually covers herself up.</br></br></br>  <br>She's useless at everything else though</br>  <br>For all we know, Yui could have been a basketball player ace and taken Sobu High School to the nationals and had her own sports spinoff series. But nope.</br>  <br>They want what he wants. It is still a bitch move when he does that sort of thing and then ignores their feelings for him.</br>  <br>She probably thinks it isn't that big of a deal. Which to all ends and purposes is true. Some guy walks in and sees you in your undies. So what? It's not like he did it on purpose with impure intentions and as long as he didn't see you completely naked what's the fuss? There's no damage done to anybody.</br>  <br> There's no damage done to anybody. <br>Except Hikki's brain damage thanks to Yui.</br></br>  <br>My gods, what happened to 8man? I knew S1 had QUALITY but that's far beyond anything I remembered.</br>  <br>You were distracted by 8man's soothe and sultry monologues occurred throughout season 1.</br>  <br>Fuck off 8man</br>  8man could write excellent poetry if he used Yukino as inspiration.  <br><br>The only thing I think of when I think of Yukino is SHIT.</br></br>  <br> The only thing I think of when I think of Yukino is SHIT she's so beautiful I think I'm going to pass out <br>Right on man</br></br>  <br>You and 8man are very different people.<br><br> Just like her namesake, Yukinoshita Yukino appeared to me as snow personified. <br> Translucent white skin; long and beautiful legs that extended from her shapely calves to her hips; a surprisingly narrow waistline; and a modest yet still eye-catching bosom. <br> Yet within a moment, she hid that sight behind a pareo. That was close. I almost died from lack of oxygen just then. <br> “You said you’re a practicing Buddhist, didn’t you?” <br> “Oh, yeah…” <br> Right, I’m a Buddhist. Therefore, I wouldn’t lose to this level of seduction. Don’t underestimate an ascetic monk. Still, I wonder how Buddha managed to have children. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> beautiful <br><br>Not with that chest.</br></br></br></br>   yukinofags trying to befriend yuifags after years of shitting of them <br><br>Top cuck</br></br>  <br> translucent white skin <br>So Yukino isn't Japanese?<br><br><br> bust size determining beauty <br>sup manchild<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every time he sees Yukino get all weird about her small chest in his thoughts it's always like he tries to say something then sidelines it telling himself that she should have some hope with her genes.</br>  What do you guys think of Yui and Yukino's memorandums? They both made me really want the story from their perspective.  <br><br>Everyone has abandoned them, now they're just trying to play off Yukino's friendship with Yui to get some more support.</br></br>  <br> So Yukino isn't Japanese? <br>She's a Japanese beauty, I think the best comparison to Yukino would be a Yuki-onna.</br></br>  <br> Yuifags trying to befriend Yukinofags after years of shitting on them <br><br>Fix'd for actual truth.</br></br></br>  <br>It was quite eye opening, or at least Yui's was.<br>I don't recall her ever showing signs of self esteem issues before, but I guess she really does give herself a hard time for her shortcomings.<br><br>I do hope she at the very least finds peace and learns to appreciate who she is.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Replying to your own bait <br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br>   this fanbase <br>Embarrassing.</br>  <br>We've been doing a lot of extending the olive branch. Yui got so much shit for ages and volume 11 gave shitposters the barely-justifiable ammunition they need to attack Yukino en-masse, so we know how it feels.</br>  <br><br>Why would Yuifags need to befriend Yukinofags? They are already well-liked among everyone else.</br></br>  <br>Nope, and you're literally a cuckinofag.</br>  <br>Her actions make a lot more sense when you realize she has shit self esteem and is fcking terrified of losing Hikki.<br><br><br>Yukino's was interesting but leaves far more questions than it answers (none)<br><br>All we can gather is that she really really wants genuine to be what she thinks it is and something makes her smile and blush seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Second most obnoxious after Irohafags <br> well-liked </br></br>  <br>Yukinofags have been historically the most obnoxious pieces of shit in the fanbase.</br>  How long until Yukino and 8mom meet?  <br>Isn't that usually the chance with firstgirlfags?</br>  <br><br>Yuifags and Irohafags make up the majority of the fanbase. If you think they're disgusting then you're just a disgusting Yukinofag, a vocal minority.</br></br>  <br>I really liked how Yukino reflected so much on genuine, Yui didn't do that as much but it made me understand her character better.<br>But I hated that it really left more questions than answers like you said, plus it really didn't specify on her feelings for 8man</br></br>  <br>Will Yukino realize why he chose to give her glasses instead of some random Pan-san thing at that point?</br>  Don't respond to the bait anons.  <br>So I guess that means you weren't around for the last month or so of S2's run where Irohafags went full Branch Davidian?</br>  <br>Irohafags did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>I wonder if he did that deliberately or if it was his subconscious acting subtly.</br>  <br>Irohafags at least have good reason to worship their waifu.</br>  <br>I'm not sure I'd call being a bunch of lunatics "good reason"</br>  <br>It's a valid reason though.</br>  <br> it really didn't specify on her feelings for 8man <br>We can infer them from the regular story and how fixated on genuine she became. Genuine = 8man's request, the one she brings up all the time.<br><br>I wish there was one of these for the transition between vol 10 to 11 and vol 11 to 12 to see how they have changed.<br><br>Yui doesn't reflect on it as much because of what she said, she thinks her idea of it is not what they want and she mostly wants what she wants.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can stop making up shit, daily reposting Yukinohater. Irohafags have cemented the fact they're the most obnoxious over the past several months. Yuifags have been so annoying of late, they are put right under them.<br><br><br>Hardly. The size difference between all three fanbase are marginal at best. It's still a fact Irohafags are most obnoxious and you can't say otherwise when we look at the reposts and unfunny forced meme on top of the constant shit-flings they start more than any other fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste is a good reason to excuse what they did?</br>  <br> constant shit-flings they start more than any other fanbase. <br><br>Prove it. Oh wait, you can't because you just automatically assume all anti-Yukino posts were made by an Irohafag. They're just a boogeyman to you.</br></br></br>  <br>What did they do?</br>  Yuifags and Irohafags are pretty desperate to create a false peace and act innocent, more so for pretending they are allies. I guess the weak have to team up in order to overcome the bigger and common enemy  <br>Poor bait. We all know shit taste is reserved for Yukinofags.</br>  <br> yuckynoshitter delusions </br>  This thread proves that Oregairu threads are as good as dead unless there is bait because bait is the only thing which keeps them going.  <br>Same way you can prove all anti-Yukino posts are made by everyone and not typically Irohafags or even Yuifags who before Iroha came around was the primary rival and enemy, right?</br>  <br>Irohafags burned my house.<br><br><br>There is no peace, there are no alliances. It's all dirty political-like tactics.<br>The only alliance that I know of is the imouto one, with Komachi/Iroha.<br><br>But honestly I don't see any of the bullshit that you just posted happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't want to infer them though, that we can definitely do enough of. If she said something like Yui's "hands" then that would have been great.<br>I'm mostly missing the romantic development between the characters, although I do know they have to take care of their drama first, that's not why I started this series<br><br>I just hope Watari can actually develop the romance instead of teasing us this much</br></br></br></br>   this shitflinging back and forth <br> 131 / 23 </br>  <br>Stop it Anon, that's no good.</br>  <br> delusional Irohafag </br>  <br><br>Neither Yuifags nor Irohafags have done anything wrong.</br></br>  <br>Your "imouto alliance" is a fiction. Irohafags love Komachi while Komachifags just know better than to get in on the shitflinging.</br>  <br>It's literally two retarded Yukinofags and two retarded Irohafags duking it out</br>  <br> liking a girl whose name literally says that she is a shit </br>  <br> liking a girl that's as plain and boring as the bottled water she's named after </br>  <br> liking a slut who jumps from guy to guy </br>  <br>それはだめだ。</br>  <br>Yukino did exactly that. She's used goods anon.</br>  <br>Irohafag confirmed for delusional and underage.</br>  <br><br> Irohafags <br>I never took part in the shipping wars myself, but weren't they shitposting pretty hard about a month ago? All those edits of armadas and Helm's Deep, "Iroha or death!", etc. The backlash was so severe that one guy even made graphs comparing the percentage of shitposts made in favor/against Iroha, if I remember right. Not saying that Irohafags were the only ones doing such things, of course. All I remember is that they were a singled out group a month ago.</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't jump from guy to guy though, she abandoned those feelings for almost over a decade before feeling anything for Hachiman.</br>  <br>3 year old Hayama fucked her real good</br>  <br>  All those edits of armadas and Helm's Deep, "Iroha or death!", etc. <br><br>That's just support for their girl. It's only shitposting if it's unjustified attacks against another girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino vs Yui was the Kirino vs Kuroneko before S2. Anyone who thinks the shitstorm that occurred in Yahari threads weren't mainly done by them are either new or trolling. Yuifags simply far from being innocent and were combative as hell.</br>  <br>Statisticsautistanon's findings technically pointed to most Iroha-related shitposting being "anti" but then he also didn't classify "Iroha or death!" et al. as shitposting.<br><br><br>Highly debatable considering how rampantly they spammed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the shitpost percentages were made before all those edits of armadas and Helm's Deep, "Iroha or death!", etc.<br>Irohafags have long been singled out since the beginning of b2b threads for their enthusiasm.</br></br>  <br>The statistics anon? His last posts were about how Irohafags weren't the issue but some were still biting obvious stuff.<br><br>The real Irohafag shitstorm started once those IroHachi scenes got translated. Now THAT had a backlash.</br></br></br>  <br> she abandoned those feelings for almost over a decade <br> this is what Yukinofags actually believe </br></br>  IROHA OR DEATH  <br>The best girl camp is a lonely one, even during the LN threads we were a bit singled out.<br><br>"Iroha or death" is actually fine by me, as long as it's not falseflagging.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukinofag confirmed for cuck.</br>  <br> Yuifags simply far from being innocent and were combative as hell <br>I'm gonna have to agree with this, a quick skim of most Yahari threads from these past few months were decidedly anti-Yukino. And of those anti-Yukino posts well over half were pro-Yui as hell. Though to be fair, this was a time when nearly every character was being shitted on and Yui was implied to be the only character who was allowed to be liked in the threads while the show was airing. There were truly passionate and sometimes vindictive Yukinofags no doubt, but they were mostly drowned out.

I do get see some appeal in that both are from wealthy families and have a past with each other, but beyond that is, well, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>It pisses off Yuckynofags and gains easy (you)'s</br>  <br>Aesthetically they look good but then again they match as good as any mix of Hachiman, Yukino, Hayato, and Yumiko.</br>  <br>Trolling mostly, but I think a small portion of it might be people who want to see Hayama redeem himself and reconcile with Yukino in the same stroke.</br>  <br>I vouch for Hayama but the ending I want for him is to tell everyone to go fuck themselves and ride across Japan in a motorcycle.<br>He doesn't need an autistic bitch, Hitler or bimbo like Miura. He needs to stop being such a pussy.</br></br>  <br><br>Any Hayama x Iroha fans around?</br></br>  <br>Hachiman is the black haired angrier Hayama.<br>Yumiko is the blonde haired angrier Yukino.</br></br>    <br><br>According to his memorandum it seems like he's having identity issues, looks like he's trying to put up an image for everyone but he wants 8man to see through him.<br><br>I personally believe he's just making a big deal out of it though, he really should just tell everyone to fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One does not simply tell everyone to fuck off in this LN.</br>  <br> he wants 8man to see through him. <br>As he should.</br></br>  <br>Really, if I knew Hayato I'd send him a copy of pic related.</br>   YY thread   <br><br>Hayato's memorandum is actually the easiest to understand by far, next to Haruno's (thank god he's not as autistic as the others)<br><br> A different book after the other, I continued searching, without growing weary, unable to give in. Over and over again, I went through “No Longer Human” and “Run, Melos!” <br> For the other party to have addressed you, to have sympathized with you, be something entirely different was nothing more than despair itself. <br>I couldn’t forgive myself for having expectations, for thinking I had understood, for thinking I was understood.<br> Compared to the existence as described in “No Longer Human”, I was much more diminutive, cowardly, and vulgar. Dazai didn’t realize that he was plagued with a much paltrier problem. <br><br>Hachiman admits he has a deep connection with the book No Longer Human, Hayama compares himself to the book and sees a huge difference. No wonder he said he was doing it for himself when he pulled that stunt on Orimoto and friend, he wanted to confirm if 8man and him were the same.<br><br> That maybe if it was this book or that maybe if it was that person who was unusually more sensitive to the evils of people, I thought, perhaps, they might find me. Perhaps they might see right through me. <br> Yet, despite looking at the things that were so close to me, despite seeing right through everything else, I was the only one who wasn’t looked at. <br><br>...and 8man wouldn't even notice him.<br><br>Truly a poor soul. Clings to superficial friendships, wanting to know himself better but not given the chance to, due to expectations and then the only person who he thought could save him couldn't even take a second to look at him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So apparently her simply standing there is classified as seduction according to him yet it doesn't count with other girls with clearly superior assets.</br>  <br> muh japanese beauty trope <br>That's why.</br></br>  <br>Has 8man ever refered to her as a Japanese Beauty rather than just beautiful?</br>  <br>Yukino is the perfect beauty I would want in a girl. 8man and I share similar taste.</br>  <br>Too bad Yuckyno a shit beauty to the eyes of the rest of the world.</br>  <br>Christ, this autism. You never stop, do you?</br>  <br>Majority around the world actually like Yukino most. Stay salty.</br>  Why didn't Yukino let 8man kiss her?  <br>I guess that just means she's little more special to 8man.</br>  <br>Yeah, I've seen her popularity on shit holes like reddit and facebook.<br>Makes sense now.</br></br>  <br>So I guess she's popular in places with people that are actually adjusted to society.</br>  <br>How low can you go?<br>You might as well post those gifs with tumblr filter on them.</br></br>  <br>Allow me to explain.<br><br>Yukino and 8man suddenly locked eyes, their faces mere inches away from eachother.<br>Both were in complete shock and unable to focus on anything but the other's eyes.<br>Amidst this surreal moment for the two of them Yukino subconsciously began to lean in closer.<br>In the process of this she put pressure on 8man's wound.<br>The sudden pain broke 8man from the trance which in turn broke Yukino from the trance.<br><br>Having returned to their senses they continued on as they would have normally, unaware of how close they were to advancing their relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where's your sense of humor Anon?</br>  <br>Cherrypicking wont' do you any good.

Why does everyone need to be autistic hikki you kimoy fuck or senpai please stop hitting on me? Are there even humans in this series? Wataru you fuck. Just add a cute honest girl in this shit.  <br>It's a seinen why would you expect things to be happy and perfect?</br>  <br>yes. some people argue that they are a bad couple because they are too similar, but i disagree. who they are as people they are pretty much polar opposites. she is the prettiest and most intelligent girl in the school, while he is, in the eyes of the normals, boring and loser.<br><br>but they have similarities. she became an outcast because of how outstanding she was while he became an outcast because of how seemingly unnoteworthy and awkward he was.<br><br>and because they are both outcasts they are able to see things differently and have similar perspectives and opinions. How they grew to know each other felt very natural and subtle.<br><br>I like Yui as a character and she has had some cute moments with 8man, but i just dont think they are as good of a match. also her love for him feels less believable. seems like she liked him for the fact that he saved her dog. seems pretty unrealistic considering he has average looks and a relatively unattractive personality unless you get to know him better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>when did he give her his t-shirt? i dont remember this</br></br>  <br>Just because feelings start one way doesn't mean they can't become real with time.<br><br><br>He never got his class shirt back after Yukino wore it during the concert, it just disappeared since the only things he had in his bag after the festival was the work he needed to complete.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what is this from? the LN?</br>  <br> she is the prettiest and most intelligent girl in the school <br>Forced Mary Sue.<br><br> I like Yui as a character and she has had some cute moments with 8man, but i just dont think they are as good of a match. also her love for him feels less believable. <br>Than Yukino? You have to be fucking kidding me, there's no way you're this stupid.<br><br> but they have similarities. she became an outcast because of how outstanding she was while he became an outcast because of how seemingly unnoteworthy and awkward he was. <br> and because they are both outcasts they are able to see things differently and have similar perspectives and opinions. How they grew to know each other felt very natural and subtle. <br> seems like she liked him for the fact that he saved her dog. seems pretty unrealistic considering he has average looks and a relatively unattractive personality unless you get to know him better. <br>At least this kind of proves that this is not falseflag. Jesus...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, read the memorandums in the LN.</br>  <br>I agree with you for the most part except for the part with Yui.<br>She didn't like him right off the bat because he saved her dog, she actually treated him pretty badly and then developed a crush on him as the club spent time together.</br></br>  <br>was he not the guy she wanted to make cookies for when she first came to the club?</br>  <br>Yes but at that point the cookies really were a "thank you" she even mumbles about it during the Birthday Song for You story.</br>  <br>i mean any girl liking him isn't believable. or atleast these pretty top tier girls. But what I meant is that Yukino didn't like him from the beginning, she grew to like him over time and it seems like she wasn't even aware of it until near the end. I'm not even sure if she was even fully aware of it at the end. seems like she was in denial about it similarly to how 8man tries to suppress his own feelings.<br><br>i feel like these kind of feelings make sense for a guy like 8man, who doesn't seem like obvious boyfriend material at all, so the attraction would have to be very subtle and gradual. <br><br>but with Yui she seemed to feel so sure of her feelings for him and has tried to make it obvous that she liked him for a long while now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hmmm. okay i get it... i guess thats pretty probable. did she know that he never got the first cookies she sent as a thank you though? because if she had thought he had already received her cookies then she wouldn't have any need to do it again i would think. also she seemed so very sure of her feelings for 8man way before Yukino was, so it seemed to me like she already had feelings very near the beginning of the story. that would just be do to each of their types of characters though. Yukino suppresses her feelings while Yui embraces them typically</br>  <br>could be* not would be</br>  <br> but with Yui she seemed to feel so sure of her feelings for him and has tried to make it obvous that she liked him for a long while now <br>She fucking spent a whole year observing him</br></br>  <br>All the girls grew fond of him over time. <br>Club girls because he spends time with them and does stuff with them. Iroha because he helped her and spent time with her.<br><br>Come on Yuifags, why is an Irohafag such as myself having to defend Yui from this bullshit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To me this thread looks like a Yukino thread and Yuifags are only here to keep the thread alive when they try to shit on her</br>  Do you anons think the series will end with volume 12 or will it go on to 13? I hope it goes to 13 just so WW can dedicate an entire novel to 8man's request after Yukino's  <br>do you mean the year before the story starts? because thats exactly what i mean by unrealistic. all of his good qualities only come out when you get to know him, but from afar and at first glance hes just some creepy weird guy. so in reality theres no reason a girl should like him. other than the fact that he saved her dog. which still, in reality, isnt all it takes to start liking someone if they arent outwardly attractive. not that its impossible, just relatively unrealistic.<br><br><br>also another reason for why i think Yukinos love for 8man is believable is because he seems to be the only one capable of understanding her. He is someone that always tries to look past the mask that people wear in public and tries to see their true self. Yukino needs someone like this. Or at least she probably thinks she does. She probably admires him for this ability and appreciates the fact that there is someone else sees the world similarly to her.<br><br>Even though 8man realizes that his judgements of her were wrong, and she wasnt the strong girl he thought she was, he at least made an effort where others didn't and when he does discover the truth, it seems he is the only one other than her family and maybe Hayato. And he seems to be the only one aware of the issues she has with her family and the only one to show sympathy towards her in regards to that.<br><br>I don't think Yui is in as need of someone like that like how Yukino is. Yui is much more open about herself. Even though 8man was kind of wrong about her being a nice girl, he wasn't really. Even though she kind of forced Yukino into a corner at the end, that didn't eliminate who she is and was up to that point which really was mostly on the surface</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am a Yuifag but I don't really think she's a good match for 8man.</br>  <br>apparently he is contracted to finish with 12. i dont know how final that is though? does that mean he can't write more after that if he wanted to? idk, but i hope not I want more.<br><br>also can someone tell me how many episodes a volume covers? people talk as if we will only get an episodes worth or something due to only 1 more book, but then i realized there are only 11 books out currently and we have a total of 26 episodes. and people even complain about stuff being omitted in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't start this</br>  <br>That was my first time ever posting in these threads. I have always cautiously kept my distance until now.<br><br>Goodbye, kind Anon. I will see you when you ascend to Valhalla.</br></br></br>  <br>i can appreciate that</br>  <br>Have you read Yukino's monologue? She's a complete mess right now.<br><br> And he seems to be the only one aware of the issues she has with her family and the only one to show sympathy towards her in regards to that. <br>Fucking hell, Yui has no idea and definetely isn't bothered by it, right?<br><br> I don't think Yui is in as need of someone like that like how Yukino is. <br>So? That's not how love works.<br><br> so in reality theres no reason a girl should like him. other than the fact that he saved her dog. which still, in reality, isnt all it takes to start liking someone if they arent outwardly attractive. not that its impossible, just relatively unrealistic. <br>8man is not bad looking, only his eyes are messed up. The damn dog was just what got her interested in him, the actual desire to get him came later after weeks of staring at him in class.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No pls we need more open minded people like you dont leave</br>  <br> unrealistic <br><br>So everything that's not about Yukino is unrealistic for you then. She spent a whole year observing him. A whole year behind him in the same classroom. <br><br>At first it would have been because he saved her dog, but she couldn't muster up the courage to thank him personally. Then she would have felt guilty because he's a loner and she thought it was her fault. Later she would have thought he is creepy from how he laughs alone. In between she would wonder if he recognizes her or not and with the passing of the time (1 year), she would realize his good points from all the creepyness and realizes she can't stop watching over him<br><br>I'm pretty sure this is more realistic than Yukino, perfection incarnate, to fall for a creepy dude in a couple of months</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> also can someone tell me how many episodes a volume covers? <br>Usually a standard LN volume can be adapted in 3-4 episodes, but that's not a very reliable indicator for Oregairu, because you have things like vol 5 adapted with only 1 ep and vol 10 with around ~30 min over 3 episodes, and then you have the 5-episode vol 9 adaptation.</br></br>  <br> 5-episode vol 9 adaptation. <br>And even so they cut out Saki and Keika scenes</br></br>  <br>Literally the purest girl in the show</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>i mean yeah Yui knows and cares, but Yukino isn't a lesbian. <br><br>and 8man isn't bad looking, but hes not good looking either. its stated a lot that hes average looking. i think only by himself, but i dont think his awkwardness would be enough to cancel out good looks enough to the point that he became this type of bitter lonely person,<br><br><br>idk that logic sounds kind of like it leans towards self insert justification writing. "i may seem creepy to most people, but if a girl were to just watch over me long enough, she would eventually fall in love with me." but maybe im just bitter about the fact that i dont have a cute girl that watches me from afar and has developed a crush on me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's stated that he's good looking but his rotten eyes are what makes him unattractive<br><br> idk that logic sounds kind of like it leans towards self insert justification writing. "i may seem creepy to most people, but if a girl were to just watch over me long enough, she would eventually fall in love with me." but maybe im just bitter about the fact that i dont have a cute girl that watches me from afar and has developed a crush on me. <br><br>Then what about Yukino? If we follow your logic: "I'm a 11/10 japanese beauty that fell for a creepy loner because we look similar but he's not as autistic as me and can "solve things". Oh, and I just happen to love a fictional character that has the same eyes as his"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm afraid we wouldn't get the romantic development I wanted if we end in vol 12.<br>If it doesn't go to vol 13 then we probably would get a friendship end which no one wants</br></br>  <br>I want a friendship end</br>  <br> friendship end which no one wants <br>Speak for yourself; I won't mind a friendship end if the major plots of the story gets resolved and the Service Club stays together. People would probably flip the fuck out though.</br></br>  <br><br> Yui's crush <br> unrealistic <br> self insert justification writing <br><br>I don't even know why are you doing this. First of all, you can't rationalize love. Some might have a crush because of looks and others because of the behaviour. Just because they didn't show the previous year in the LN, doesn't make her love for 8man less genuine. <br><br>In fact, if you really want to reason about that, then I would say Yukino's crush for 8man is even more self insert justification writing compared to Yui's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Yui</br>  <br> People would probably flip the fuck out though. <br>Only die-hard shippers. The story isn't about romance but relationships</br></br>  <br>with Yukino he earned her love. she didn't like him until she got to know him. she likes him due to his personality, outlook, and yes, his ability to solve things. putting quotes around something doesn't make it less legitamate. hes capable is solving issues. thats a desirable trait.<br><br>now, Yui also gets to know these things about him as well, but she liked him even before getting to know him. and even still, personality wise she isn't as compatible as Yukino.<br><br>i guess personally im an "earn your happy ending" type of guy so i dont like it when a girl likes the mc without him actively doing something to cause it gradually.<br><br>also when did is say he was good looking but his rotten eyes make him attractive? im curious cuz that kind of changes my image of him. and you know i figured he had rotten eyes because of being a loner which i figured was due to being outwardly unnattractive<br><br><br><br>while i want Yukino to win, i think i wouldnt mind a friendship end if it was done meaningfully<br><br><br>eh idk i disagree there that Yukinos is more. unless you mean because shes the prettiest girl in school, but really wev only heard 8man say that himself so that could just be his own opinion. really i mean the whole story has alot of self insert justification stuff going on. really i didnt mean for this realistic vs unrealistic point to be such a big deal it was just one of my opinions on the whole thing of why i like one relationship more than the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoiler for blogshit<br> The thing is, they'd actually make a great couple except for the part where 8man would eventually find some stupid, niggling thing to blow out of proportion in his head until it eventually drives a wedge between them.<br><br>Source: my last relationship. She was the best thing that ever happened to me on a dozen different levels and I had to go and break it off over something stupid as hell.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>This is why I avoid these threads</br>  <br>More like that is why you avoid replying to Yukinofags.</br>  <br><br>Was there every any confirmation that Yui and 8man were even in the same class their first year? I know at least sometimes Japanese schools switch up class compositions between years, and unless I'm remembering wrong and Yui and Sagami were "friends" in middle school, that would explain why Yui wasn't in Miura's group from the beginning.<br><br>and re: Yui's developing feelings for 8man, I really got the impression that it was just a sort-of crush on some creepy guy between when she joined the club and their "reset" and that she only really started falling for him after that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> with Yukino he earned her love <br>Just because Yui started out with a crush on him doesn't mean 8man did any less to "earn" her  genuine  feelings.<br><br> personality wise she isn't as compatible as Yukino <br>In some relationships like attracts like, in others opposites attract. Generally it's pretty arbitrary but if I wanted to try and get into theory on it though I'd say that people with "extreme" personalities work better with a foil to balance them out. 8man being the monster of logic, it would probably do him a world of good to marry someone who can actually understand people on an emotional level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you except for the part with Yui.<br><br>But that's also precisely why I think the relationship between 8man and Yukino would work much better as friend instead of lover.</br></br></br>  <br>I can see 8man cheating on Yui though. He's surrounded by girls who want to bang him, and even if Yui did find out she would know how to react and just go with it.</br>  <br>8man's not nearly enough of a scumbag to cheat. Break up with her because he fell for someone else sure, but keeping the relationship going when he has feelings for someone else wouldn't be genuine.</br>  <br>That's possible but 8man has never hurt anyone like he would hurt Yui is he cheated on her. At that point I think 8man would be forced to hide it because he would think Yui would go suicidal if he told her.</br>  Yumiko drama CD when?  <br>Why is the cutest girl the one with no feelings for MC.</br>  <br>That's why she's cute.<br>She's not messed up enough to fall in love with a lonely edgelord like 8man</br></br>  <br>You've got a point. Too bad she's head over heels for Cuckboy.</br>  We need to get the 8get  why no s3 or OVA  <br>8get will happen in about 36 hours or so.</br>  <br> Irohafaggots might 8get <br><br>Please no</br></br></br>  <br>Since it's a very fucking rare get, everyone on the board will try, so it's highly unlikely to happen here.<br><br>It would be hilarious if Iroha got it, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder</br>  <br><br>Irohafags are the last ones that should get it. their GETfag contingent will absolutely never shut up about it.</br></br>  <br>That would've been even more amazing if it wasn't a post rigged by a mod.<br><br>But we did get the 80000(8man) get on the sekrit club thread.</br></br></br>  <br>How did mods rig that?</br>   There are some who don't want this to happen <br>It's like they don't want Hachiman to be happy.</br>  <br>That's just what I've been told.<br>But let's be honest here, the chances of getting an octa 8get with a 8man pic are very, very fucking low.</br></br>  <br>Based mod.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/888869<wbr>90/#q88888999_34<br><br><br>See above.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  good friday, everyone<br><br>did you see my brothers?</br></br>  Any TLfags around for this pic?<br> I must warn you, though: it's gay as fuck. </br>  <br>If it's not about Iroha, it's not getting TL'ed. <br><br>Trust me.</br></br></br>  <br>No Iroha?

A SHIT.  <br><br>Maybe we can get Jun Maeda to direct it. Surely, he would get investors right? And nothing wrong would go with the plot or story right? Right, anon?</br></br>  <br>Yukino would just mumble an "I see.." and look down with an empty expression. <br>Yui would initially insist that he's lying because he doesn't want to hurt one of them and would rather choose to reject both. He'll avoid her gaze and she'll give up, make a sad smile and leave the room.</br></br>  <br>Said "someone else" enters the room and it obviously affects 8man.<br>What then?</br></br>  <br> Ebina gets a remote nosebleed because the someone else is   <br><br> Totsuka </br></br></br>  <br>No, it has to be  Hayama </br>  <br>Ridiculous levels of awkwardness, crushed dreams and broken hearts. Both YY stare at the ground, fidgeting, until 8man takes his special someone by the hand and escorts them outside the room.</br>  <br>They will be crying and hugging each other.  And because of that Yui still feel a little happy inside though. </br>  <br>They'll be free to love each other.</br>  <br>There will be blood</br>  <br>Yandere yui is boring.</br>  Why didn't 8man prevent Yukino from falling in love with him? He said he didn't want a romcom with her. He managed to do it with Yui.  <br>Anything he would have done would have just made her fall in love with him faster, honestly. There's literally no way to stop her from falling in love with him outside of the Yui copypasta where he confesses to her then pretends it never happens.</br>  <br>The first thing he tried to do when he entered the club was try to intimidate her so that she would hate him.<br>Unfortunately she was trying the same thing and he was terrified.</br></br>  <br><br>You see Ebina isn't really a true fujo, but actually just the hugest Hayama x 8man shipper in existence. You think she doesn't see the fucking Saika x 8man verbal foreplay that happens every day every fucking break between class periods?

He's the only person besides Hayama willing to stick around long enough for her to get to know.<br>If it were best boy Tobe in 8man's place, they'd have been dating since the Kyoto arc.<br>Even desperate Chuuni would stay in the club for her.</br></br></br>  <br>Not entirely true, they do love some girlier guys as the bottom but I think Saika might just be on the wrong side of the line.</br>  <br>But the girlier guy has to resemble at least a guy. Saika is just a girl (with a dick) so it wouldn't work because it looks completely like a hetero relationship<br><br>Source: my fujo cousin</br></br></br>  <br>He never thought Yukino would fall for him. His girl sensors didnt activate in the way they did with Yui</br>  <br>Yukino is like a beautiful statute for him. It has all of the Japanese beauty ideals, radiates intelligence and strong personality, etc but 8man turned her into not a girl or something date-able.<br><br>On the other hand, 8man has considered Yui from day one a woman. A very attractive woman, but labels her with slut/bitch. Later, he retcons it into "nice girl". In both cases, he makes it in his mind that Yui wouldn't want to date him either, but she is still a woman.<br><br> Essentially, fuck you 8man for making this difficult for everyone. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> isnt all it takes to start liking someone if they arent outwardly attractive <br>Well it's not like 8man is actually unattractive, even when Yukino criticized him when he says that he handsome Yukino only criticizes his facial expression not his facial features.<br><br>Even when he thinks she's calling him ugly by comparing him to Nighthawk's Star she tells him that wasn't the point.</br></br></br></br>  The third bluray cover is out. I'm not a fan of these covers so far at all. They all look kind of weird.  <br>Yes opposites attracts but in the end if you have nothing in common or don't have similar interests things just kind of fall flat.<br>Aside from the fact that Yui is not to cause any strife it just leaves them in a boring relationship I mean sure you get the 100% love but relationships do need conflict in the end.</br></br>  <br> also when did is say he was good looking but his rotten eyes make him attractive? <br><br>He says he's good looking and the counter argument he gets is always his eyes are rotten, instead of denying that</br></br></br>  <br> Even desperate Chuuni would stay in the club for her. <br>He still can't talk to girls Anon.</br></br>  <br>Perfect cover. Now I have to buy that volume and hopefully the novel is about Isshiki as well.</br>    <br>Post cover  please </br>  <br>He doesn't have to try to talk much.<br>He can just sit there working on his LN, while she reads.<br>Once in awhile he'll hand it over to Yukino to check.<br>She'll berate and insult him and he'll try his hardest to keep his diamond hard dick under control.<br>She'll berate him,</br></br></br></br></br>    Miura is cutest  <br>Kimoi!</br>  <br>In that single instant he took her purity.</br>  <br>She will forever be pure</br>  <br><br><br>How does this work exactly?

The same people that jumped ship like mad once the final episode of s2 aired.</br>  I'm slowly starting to like Maynard although he's a jobber and I'm not even Akainu  <br> and I'm not even Akainu <br>Who might you be?</br></br>   Gravity&gt;Light   <br>That's nice. I'm slowly starting to warm up to Urouge. I really liked how he reacted to Kaido's suicidality.</br>  <br>Maynard obviously.</br>  <br>All Shiki cared about was world domination and Roger's thorny dick. He never cared about One Piece.</br>  <br>Fujitora vs Kizaru <br>Tiger vs Monkey<br> Zoro  vs  Luffy </br></br></br>  <br><br>I like Urouge even more now.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Praise the Urouge.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know people here do it for shits and giggles but me too.

Kaidou gonna wreck Mingo soon.  <br><br>Also, luffy was riding a shark on zoro's introduction chapter</br></br>  <br>I don't know, feels like he's a Tiger and a Dragon sometimes. Never a shark. I'm guessing Oda said so because of his bloodlust or something hut it just doesn't for some reason.<br><br><br>Are you not defeating your enemies when you kiss them without warning ?</br></br></br></br>  Can we agree that the blind fart is the worst admiral?  <br>What's left to wreck ?

Have you learned nothing from Dressrosa ?</br>  Reminder that Shanks stopped this nigga from going to Marineford.

Could've been good but the pacing was atrocious and I didn't enjoy any of the fights. Granted, it had some nice ideas, ok humor and likeable characters. Overall, however, it was bad due to poor execution.</br></br>  <br>Of course you're right master, I'm sorry I forgot about such an important point.</br>  <br> thinks creature and human mean the same thing  <br><br>just kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Oda might have changed his mind. Or the characters evolved.</br>  <br> Punk Hazard <br> pacing was atrocious and I didn't enjoy any of the fights <br>that would be dressrosa arc <br>and the fishman arc</br></br></br></br>  In an SBS question, a fan asked Oda what each crew member's least favorite food was.[18]<br><br> Monkey D. Luffy: A certain shop's cherry pie<br> Roronoa Zoro: Chocolate (It's too sweet)<br> Nami: Orangette (Prefers actual fruit)<br> Usopp: Mushrooms (Got sick once)<br> Sanji: Konjac (Not nutritious) <br> Tony Tony Chopper: All things spicy (It's not sweet)<br> Nico Robin: Gum (Can't swallow it)<br> Franky: Marshmallow (It's not hard)<br> Brook: Lemon (Can't make a sour face) <br><br> cant swallow it <br> CANT SWALLOW IT </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Worst arc after Punk Hazard imo.  <br>Everyone has preferences but yours is pretty shitty.</br></br>  <br> Law <br> manly <br>Anon pls</br></br></br>  <br> Monkey D. Luffy: A certain shop's cherry pie <br><br>poor Teach.</br></br></br>  <br>Those animals were selected by Toshio Asakuma not by Oda.</br>  I can't accept that she is dead. I simply can't.  <br>Because Kaidou TOTALLY looks like someone who listens to reason</br>  <br>nope, it had many great moments and the pacing is just fine when you read it in one go. And PH was also enjoyable.</br>  <br> &gt;cant swallow it <br> &gt;CANT SWALLOW IT <br>therefore it's not food</br></br></br>  <br>Robin a cute</br>  <br>franky confirmed gay<br><br>I agree with Nami though, orangette is disgusting as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> it's not hard </br>  <br> Worst arc after Punk Hazard imo <br>the marinefordbabbie is strong with you</br></br>  <br><br>They don't mean the same thing. But "human" is a subset of "living creature". Or are you suggesting that humans aren't living creatures? That's why WB was the strongest MAN despite the fact that Kaidou was stronger than him.</br></br>  <br>No but that nigger is probably crazy/dumb enough to be tricked into it.</br>  Real talk Sabo having amnesia was really pointless and detracts from his comment about "going anywhere if Luffy needs me since I don't want to go through [that] again".  <br> Brook's reason is still just a skull joke </br>  <br>being a good talker means knowing who you are talking with</br>  <br>That was the high point in the arc for me. That really was the worst thing that could have ever happened and watching the pieces slowly fall into place was glorious. Adding God Ussop to the mix was perfection.</br>  <br>Oh come on he's no girl either. Not like I mind effeminate guys anyways.</br>  <br>Nope, he is still alive. Kaidou is gonna murder his ass for failing with smiles and Caesar</br>  <br> the pacing is just fine when you read it in one go <br><br>Nope. It's horribly drawn out. <br><br>And I can't enjoy a single fight because you only get to see a snippet of it before the next interruption. Oda was guilty of doing that in previous arcs but this time he has gone too far. You're not able to focus on one thing because there is always a clusterfuck of other shit going on at the same time. Dressrosa feels like a bunch of teaser tied together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't not want to remember. He'll be there for everyone he recollects</br>  <br>It's just an excuse for why he hasn't showed up until now and why he didn't try to save Ace.<br><br>But I think "really busy with revolutionary stuff and not aware until it was too late" would have explained just fine.</br></br></br>  <br>With "that" he means feeling like shit because of losing another brother</br>  <br>I got nothing against Law but he ain't got shit on Franky or Senor, is all I'm saying.</br>  <br>what if they mean creature as in created being</br>  <br>That's my point. <br><br>The comment about feeling like shit about losing a brother would have been a lot more impactful if he was tied up doing something and couldn't get to Ace rather than "I just literally forgot about him until he died". They're the same thing but amnesia is just so overused and stupid.</br></br></br>  <br> Nope. It's horribly drawn out. <br>Nope. There is just a lot of stuff happening in this arc and it did not feel drawn out to me at all. But I guess it can feel that way if you have to wait a week for every new chapter.</br></br>  What if you fed a devil fruit to another devil fruit?    <br>He's already lost his country, his crew, basically his body and his freedom of speech. His life is the only thing he has left. Kaido would be putting him out of his misery.</br>  <br>Terrible attempt at damage control. Creature and human are absolutely not the same thing.</br>  <br> You're not able to focus on one thing because there is always a clusterfuck of other shit going on at the same time. Dressrosa feels like a bunch of teaser tied together. <br>If you're reading it in one go? Honestly I did have trouble following it weekly since I just forgot about shit but reading it through wasn't hard to follow at all. Unless you have ADD or shit reading comp or something it shouldn't be that difficult to digest reading through.</br></br>  <br>nah you're just a trolling faggot <br>this shit has been seen time and time again</br></br>  <br>   Gravity&gt;Light <br>Doesn't mean shit to a guy who can simply change the direction of his movement mid-air.</br></br>  <br> combine perona's fruit with sugar's fruit <br> you can now turn people to toys with ghosts <br><br>one piece is over</br></br></br></br>  <br> if he was tied up doing something and couldn't get to Ace <br>This again. Then there would be a million plot holes, especially the fact that he did not contact Ace or Luffy in 10 years</br></br>  <br><br>Franky is my least favorite character. Not funny, No interesting goal. No character development since he was first introduced. Ugly design that just keeps getting worse. Is his name supposed be a pun about Frankenstein? Lame. Stole Usopp's role as inventor and his inventions are just shit they put in there so they can sell it as toys.</br></br>  <br> But I think "really busy with revolutionary stuff and not aware until it was too late" would have explained just fine. <br>No it really wouldn't have been. Too many plotholes.</br></br>  <br><br> strongest = cant be beaten <br><br>top lel faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>How am I trolling? Everyone fucking complains about the Sabo amnesia thing. Not my fault nobody bothers to actually explain why they think it's a problem to the point where they just post a picture to get 200 replies.</br>  <br>Well of course, but you're not being fair to Law by comparing an ordinary guy like him to paragons of manliness like Franky or Señor. Is all I'm saying.</br>  <br>I assumed thats what it was from the start. I don't think anyone was really convinced otherwise. He could have been undercover, or uninformed, or on the other side of the world, or Dragon forbade him from getting involved in pirate affairs, or he just trusted Whitebeard to sort it out. Amnesia is like making a solution to a problem that didn't exist, and the worst solution at that</br>  <br> strongest = nobody (including Shanks) is stronger than him <br><br>fix'd</br></br></br>  <br> not combining Bonney's and Bon-chan's fruit for an eternity of good time <br>Nigga, please</br></br>  <br><br> 4 replies <br>I warned you guys and you stilll fell for it.</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone fucking complains about the Sabo amnesia thing <br> implying <br>most people admit that it is the most reasonable explanation despite it being pretty cliche</br></br></br>  <br> Why did Ace wait until Alabasta to talk to Luffy  <br> Sabo is apparently the right hand man of the most well known criminal on the planet that everyone knows about but that's okay because Luffy is too stupid to know anything so "it's a secret" that needs Sabo to be an amnesiac to keep </br></br>  <br>What if Maynard cheat and used loaded dice...What if Fuji is cheating?</br>  <br><br>I agree. The amnesia stuff was a dumb copout.</br></br>  So, since everyone except Shanksfags here know that Mihawk&gt;Shanks, how do you think he will fare against Kaidou?  <br><br>Not all living creatures are humans but every human is a living creature. Go read a dictionary and get back to me when you have even half a clue as to what you're talking about.</br></br>  <br>Since it'd probably be a zoan, I think the result would just be a devil fruit that turns into some kind of animal.<br><br>Maybe if you took a bite of it you'd still get whatever powers it grants.</br></br></br>  <br>I read somewhere that Oda wanted to draw TB before EL. Don't know if it's true or not but maybe he intended Franky to be some sort of zombie-cyborg thing. Cutty Flam could have been an entirely new character.</br>  <br>Don't you dare talk so lightly of my husbando's possibly imminent death. <br> ;_; <br>Though frankly, I don't think Kaidou would kill a man who can't fight. Doesn't look like it.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is too stupid to know anything <br>if you actually read this manga you would know that Luffy is not interested in other stuff besides food and adventure, it was always in his character so don't try to act like it isn't all of a sudden</br></br>  <br> combining Bonney's and Bon-chan's fruit for an eternity of good time <br>Isn't that redundant?</br></br>  <br>Ace met Luffy within like a month, bro.</br>  <br>What all of those don't explain is why kid Sabo wouldn't have just asked the Revs to bring him back to Ace, Luffy, Dandan when he woke up and they suggested they should bring him back to his parents. He had no reason to set sail with a bunch of strangers if he remembered he still had his brothers on the island.</br>  <br>shit taste detected</br>  <br>copout was the fight between robin and hakuba <br>not amnesia</br></br>  <br> Sabo is apparently the right hand man of the most well known criminal on the planet that everyone knows <br>source on that before timeskip dressrosa?</br></br>  <br> He could have been undercover, or uninformed, or on the other side of the world <br> uninformed <br> with the whole information network of the revs right at his hands <br>right</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> = cant be beaten by shanks or anyone <br><br>top top lel</br></br></br></br>  <br>He still has Croc.<br> and possibly Monet, although I doubt it </br></br>  <br>Reminder that Luffy killed in one blow the sea King that tore Shanks arm off.<br>East Blue Luffy &gt;Shanks</br></br>  <br> Mihawk&gt;Shanks <br>but anon-kun, fishing day isn't til sunday. please don't waste our bait</br></br>  <br>I never disliked it but I don't especially like him either<br>he's really nothing special<br>he's just an other big guy who's probably not even that strong<br>he'd get wrecked against most supernovas of his generation</br></br></br></br>  ALRIGHT ONE MORE, THOUGHT PATTERNS<br><br>In an SBS question, a fan asked Oda what he and the Straw Hats' inner brain looked like. As a reply, Oda wrote: [12]<br><br> Monkey D. Luffy: Meat, Meat, Meat, Meat, Pirate King<br> Roronoa Zoro: Sword, Sword, Strength, Train, Sleep<br> Nami: Money, Money, Money, Money, Beauty<br> Usopp: Warrior, Lies, Lies, Run, Run<br> Sanji: Women, Cook, Cook, Nami-san, Robin-chan <br> Tony Tony Chopper: Doctor, Medicine, Sweet, Trust, Beast<br> Nico Robin: Learn, Read, History, Old, Secret<br> Franky: Weird, Weird, Weird, Dance, Iron<br> Brook: Panties, Joke, Laugh, Tea, Tea</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, Kaido might actually just kill everyone except Doffy to teach him a lesson.

Urouge confirmed stronger than Doffy and being able to use his strings as toilet paper.</br>  <br>I like how Meat overshadows Pirate King in Luffy's mind.</br>  <br>Nah brah, he obviously went to the New World on s top sekrit mission within an hour of waking up.

She defeated him with little effort. There is a reason Robin rarely ever gets to fight. Her power is just too OP.<br><br>I bet Oda came up with the amnesia stuff after reading a comment along the lines of "why didn't Sabo try to rescue Ace like Luffy did?" He probably said to himself "Ugh I didn't think about that since I just invented Sabo to replace Ace. I don't want fanboys to complain so I'll have to come up with something." Then Oda noticed that he's out of cigrattes and quickly wrote some lame amnesia justification plot before he went to the store to buy another 20 cartons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nico Robin: Gum (Can't swallow it) <br>nghlknfOINZFPOZN</br></br>  <br>Man, Zoro's dedication is fucking awesome. Him and Robin are the two that actually gets their priorities straight.</br>  <br>Reminder than Foxy damaged Luffy more than Enel<br>Foxy &gt; Enel</br></br>  I was thinking earlier today, and I realised something.<br><br>It's taken Oda five years to cover the first week of activity after the timeskip.<br><br>If I recall correctly, the East Blue Saga covered several weeks in about a year, and the rest of the pre-Timeskip sagas covered about a month between them in 12 years, so about 3 years for a week.<br><br>What do we all think the pace is going to be like in the future? Is this a slow period near the beginning of what is going to be a swifter course? Is it the beginning of an increasing hectic, stretched pace? Is the comic not far off of it's conclusion, say within the 4-6 year mark?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He can be beaten (i.e. subdued) but no living character is stronger than him.

You don't like that it is the amnesia cliche and make a fuss about it that is all.</br>  <br>Nigga couldn't make up his mind between a beetle and One Piece.<br>Admittedly, it was a cool beetle.<br><br><br>What ? It might be possible. His 'suicide' quirk might have even originated like that. Someone killed his old crew but he lived and now he can't die.
