[ Is there any anime where the military is competent?  <br>Yes.</br>  No.  <br>Other than the dozens if not hundreds of military anime you mean?</br>  Wow it's almost like when a show or movie even if it's western is about something besides the military, the military is incompetent and the focal cast of work ARE.    I understand this is a thinly-veiled rec thread but it's a good question. Only Zipang comes to mind.  <br>vampire nazi in helsing</br>  I don't know  <br>Zankyou no Terror</br>    <br>The one coming out next week.</br>  <br>Is there any anime where the military is competent and not little girls?</br>  <br> Is there any anime where the military is competent? <br>As others already said, only the main characters are allowed to be competent. So military are competent if and only if they are the main characters, but same goes with everything else.</br></br>  End of Evangelion<br>The JSSDF did their job quite well</br>  <br> Things melt from radiation before the insane shockwave hits them. <br><br>This is completely retarded...</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YP6<wbr>mMCyXFsk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Sora no Woto</br>  Anime about cute JGSDF doing cute JGSDF things when?  <br> implying the people who made this and those who watch it give a single shit about its technical accuracy concerning the destructive effects of nukes <br>As they should, I might add.</br></br>  They are only competent when their opponent is technologically hundreds years behind.  <br>OP said "competent"</br>  <br>Samurai Flamenco, kinda.</br>  Bokurano has rather realistic military involvement. Sure, it's not like they can do some actual damage but it's refreshing to see that those kids had actual military officers assigned to them.   there will never be an anime where a supernatural force gets pushed back by the military and the story focuses on their struggle to survive the losing war they started   <br>hellsing did this sometimes but the humans would eventually all get wiped out and the story would go back to the 2 worst characters in the show, edgelord and mc useless.</br>  <br>What tech level are dragons?</br>  <br>Yeah, special forces curbstomping nerds is an excellent display of competence. Not to mention hesitating to kill Shinji immediately upon finding him and then getting merced by a skirt with a glock.</br>  <br>Well the heat from the explosion travels faster than the blast wave. You've seen the videos where the car or house or whatever fries a bit before getting blown out the way.</br>  <br>Mars</br>  <br>That is literally the plot of 'Door- thus the Imperial Japanese army had a conflict there' next season.</br>  <br>why the fuck does the bomb have a parachute?</br>  <br>Japan never had a competent military, so they don't know how to make one in an anime.</br>  Do the Japs hate the military or something? No matter what, it's usually a story of "They appeared and wiped our military out in 2 seconds" just to make way for a kid with a super mech or something.  <br> Things melt from radiation before the insane shockwave hits them. <br><br>Yes, that actually happens retard.</br></br></br>  <br>airburst niggaaah</br>  <br>you want the bomb to go off just before it hits the ground. If the bomb goes off due to impact it does considerable less damage.<br>It is a real tactic but I don't know if it was specifically used for hiroshima.</br></br>  <br>I know about Gate and I enjoy the onesidedness, but I can't really get off on the military winning against people who are literal barbarians with a bit on magic and some large lizards.<br>I want an alien invasion or some device that usually mean humanity being wiped out, but instead the military pushes their shit in instead.</br></br>  <br>So that it detonates at the correct altitude.<br><br>It would do less damage at ground level because a significant amount of energy would be expended moving dirt.</br></br></br>  <br>Japan technically isn't allowed to have a military thanks to good ol' uncle sam so all they have is their shitty little SDF</br>  <br>Airburst has been around since ye olde cannon days.</br>  <br> Melt <br>They burn, but they don't melt. Their face doesn't liquify like in the video. They roast.</br></br>  <br>At Hiroshima they let it hit the ground at Nagasaki they exploded it above, partly to test which one caused the most damage but only 1 of each is hardly a large sample.</br>  Fullmetal Alchemist. <br><br>Well Armstrong's soldiers, they're pretty fucking operator whenever they appear. <br><br>That part where they pinned down god with machine gun fire and mortars whilst dragging Ed to safety was awesome. <br><br>M3 also had troops kill an monster, with a mortar. <br><br>Mortars are love. Mortars are life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This reminds me of that Argentinian cartoon about the Falklands. <br><br>This shit is hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Which is larger than the vast majority of militaries on the planet...</br>  <br>The JSDF is a military, no technicality about it. Japan just can't use it overseas for pretty much any reason and has formally given up the ability to declare war on someone.</br>  <br> Shitty little SDF <br>That shitty little SDF is bigger the Korean forces and the ROC armed forces (pathetic but a major Asian armed force nonetheless.)<br><br>Nobody in SEA can say that they top Japan in military muscle really, and it's the same in most of Asia-Pac. In before obvious hurr durr PLA and Russia stronk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It had ok dog fights.</br>  <br>Also maybe it gives the plane enough time to get away</br>  <br><br>Fuck off newfag.</br></br>  <br> Japan technically isn't allowed to have a military thanks to good ol' uncle sam so all they have is their shitty little SDF <br>America has nothing to do with Japan's constitution.<br>And their "shitty little SDF" is one of the largest and the best funded militaries in the world/</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>No you dumbasses. Why the fuck would you need a parachute for that? You would just set the fucking timer shorter if you wanted it to detonate in the air.<br><br>The parachute is there so that the airplane that drops it has enough time to get clear of the blast zone before the bomb detonates.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't exactly small though. By modern standards it is actually a rather large peacetime military.</br>  <br>The one you posted?<br><br>They were competent but didn't have the necessary tech.</br></br></br>  <br>You are wrong. Abe administration has been working through constitutional amendment and the SDF have actually seen oversea deployment in humanitarian capacity for a while.</br>  <br> there will never be an anime where a supernatural force gets pushed back by the military... <br><br>Yukikaze, but only in reference to this part.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's only for the biggest bomb ever made, gives the plane like an hour to get the fuck out of there and even then they aren't sure they'll make it.<br><br>Facing away from the blast center you still need to wear special goggles to reduce the induce brightness.<br><br>Tsar Bomba.

Japan voted on it and passed it without compulsion. They were also totally free to declare it void and null at any of the past 70 years. Don't talk about things that are over your head.</br>  <br>For the first 26 episodes, replace the current episode's enemy commander with a cabbage. The protagonist of the episode then loses as there is now no one to give horribly stupid orders.</br>  Better question, what anime shows a competent real life military.  <br>GATE (real life?)<br>Zepang (real life?)<br>Silent Fleet (real life?)</br></br></br>  Can the military be little girls?  <br> America has nothing to do with Japan's constitution <br> Americans wrote the Japanese constitution <br>B-b-but Japan could have changed it so clearly writing it is having nothing to do with it.</br></br></br>  <br>-5.1</br>  <br>Im  SORRY  alright!</br>  <br>The drop altitude was above 30,000ft. The detonation altitude was around 300ft. The bomb was in transit for about 44 seconds before the parachute opened.<br><br>Flying at 335 miles/hr the Enola Gay was well out of range BEFORE the parachute opened. It was about 11 miles horizontal away from the danger zone.<br><br>The parachute was for the airburst test.</br></br></br></br></br>  It ends, for now.  Good riddance, what a waste of time.  The ending was so unconclusive. Like nothing was solved. I thought the girls we're going to confess or something.  <br>I wonder where are the rest of the people shouting in previous threads that there won't be a status quo ending and the girl x will win?</br>  <br>Yui indirectly confessed by giving 8man the handmade chocolates, something more obvious when taking episode 12's content into account.</br>   pick Yukinon <br> her shitty family comes with it <br><br> pick Yuigahama <br> get this </br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Yukinon's sister?</br>  <br>You mean the annoying college-aged woman who apparently can't find a better use of her time than to stir shit up between high school students?</br>  <br> for now. <br>Hopefully for good</br></br>  What an unsatisfactory end.  <br>Reminder that Haruno is literally a loser obsessed with highschool drama<br><br> Just like all of us. </br></br></br>  <br>Those people were talking about the novels.</br>  about fucking time. i was sick of their cancerous generals  Can the threads end now? Please?  <br>I liked the end because I didn't want Hikki to pick either of them. Picking one means making the other one sad, and I don't want that.<br>It'd be nice if things just stay as they are.</br></br>  <br>This may sound radical, but you don't have to read them.</br>  <br>Gotta sell those LNs.</br>  Fuck commie. I hope other groups pick up S3.  Isn't the LN pretty close to it's end?<br>And the adaption got to volume 11 so yeah,it ends forever, probably.</br>  I hope someone other than FEEL adapts the end if it gets animated. Was getting tired of their blatant Yuifag bias.  <br><br>Why don't you filthy secondaries just stop posting in them then?</br></br>  <br> S3 </br>  <br> tfw ln readers are now secondaries </br>  The only way to win is if he takes Iroha-chan. <br> get cute girl <br> keep friendship with the other two <br><br>or better:<br> &gt;threesome </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are if they're reading that shitty translation</br>  <br> thinking the threads will end when there's at least one light novel left <br>Don't even pretend you've read shit, faggot. You can't even managed to find the hide thread button. I doubt you have the attention span to read a pamphlet, let alone anything with more than 20 pages.</br></br>  <br>Did you mean to reply to someone else?</br>  <br>Watari is currently bathing in our shekels as we are forced to wait another year for this shit.</br>  How many LN volumes left?  Yui almost made them decide that they would be friends forever. But 8man coerced yuki out of agreeing, we will wait for next year and let the fact sit in that jack shit happened in season 2 besides revealing the fact that Iroha loved Hayama, and yukino has become a slightly warmer person (against most of the audiences will)  <br>wait a minute do people actually feel the right to brag that they can read a LN? what the fuck that's hilarious</br>  When is novel 12 due?  <br>I think it's pretty obvious how it ends if you read between the lines at all<br><br>I would have liked it to be more conclusive but if you think nothing was solved you're clueless</br></br></br>  <br><br>Most people seem to think it will end at 12 but I don't think that's necessarily been confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Maybe these horrible /soc/ tier threads can end now, too.</br>  <br> anime was supposed to sell volume 12 <br> no volume 12 for sale <br><br> Japanese in charge of decent business models </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's just hilarious when secondaries complain about threads existing when they're easily the most annoying part of every single one with the same retarded questions.<br><br> Does Saki even like 8man? <br> Why does Haruno care? <br> Wait, so Iroha is going after both Hayama and 8man? <br><br>Every thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not knowing about expectations <br>People eagerly waiting for it to be released is even better for business.</br></br>  <br>'Buy the LNs' - WW</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/vxingxhkjj.web<wbr>m<br><br>“Some men aren’t looking for anything genuine like a waifu. <br>They can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. <br>Some men just want to watch the yahari threads burn."</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br><br>There's definitely a 12th one coming. Wataru was contracted to write 12. Supposedly the sense of people who read 11 is that there's going to be at least one more after 12. But that's not confirmed either way.</br></br>  <br>People's interests declines with time. If they don't release the novel in the next 1 -2 month the anime was fucking pointless.</br>  <br>gtfoYuigahama</br>  <br>their interest will hold long enough to buy all the rest of merch released alongside the anime. and of course volume 11.</br>  <br>Yours perhaps</br>  <br>this</br>  <br> off by 1 <br>Jesus, you almost got us there</br></br>  I want 8man to reject them both and get with Iroha.<br><br>I know it'll be Yukino, but god damn it, why do the Japanese always make the main heroine the worst girl.</br></br>  Reminder that Yukino followed her sister for her entire life and now she's following 8man.<br>It's not healthy, she has to save herself.<br>Also, service's club job should be "teaching a man how to fish", it's not about giving a fish to someone. It makes no sense to date Yukino so he can solve her problems.</br></br>  <br>Why does Chrome keep blocking maxfile links?</br>  So, I don't know if I got things wrong about the ending, but:<br><br> Yui wants to take everything, and solve Yukino's problem <br> She basically says she'll take Hachiman (solving Yukino's dependency of him) and asks for her blessing to do so. <br> Yukino is conflicted but about to accept since all she can do is go with the flow. <br> Hachiman calls bullshit and says it will solve nothing </br></br></br></br></br>  So is Volume A going to be Yui and Yukino's perspectives of volume 1 or what?  <br>Well meme'd commie</br>  <br> being part of the botnet </br>  <br>She's following everyone. She couldn't even give him cookies without Yui being around. She literally can't make her own choices. They'll have to deal with that in Vol.12.</br>   QUALITY   <br><br>Basically, yeah.<br><br>Some think that Yui foresaw Hachiman's refusal to accept it and so this was all a scheme by her to get Yukino to bring her real issue to the surface and/or clear the air between them.<br><br>Though I think Yui expected Hachiman to refuse her, I think she would have been happy if he had not. That was the 'selfish' she was talking about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Yukino is going to win when Watari decided to make her character complete shit from vol 7</br>  <br><br>Yukino doesn't even feel like the main heroine.</br></br>  <br>Yui could win; seems unlikely but possible<br><br>This entire volume was getting Yuki to express her feelings because she is unable to. Well, getting her on the path to do so because she has problems dealing with feelings. Its been what...2 months since her shell was blown away during genuine speech? After having all her childhood and most of her teens year up until she met Yui/hachi, I'm not surprised she's an emotional blob<br><br>Vol 12 I hope Watari shows major growth for Yukinoshita. She doesnt deserve all this crap Watari is making her go through</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bya<wbr>LoLE3Or8</wbr>  [ ]  lol Haruno is such a bully, sometimes i wanna just say grow up bitch. but then I remember I'm also in college watching an animated high school drama. Then I cry.  <br>That's why a Yukino end wouldn't solve anything.<br>She would just keep following after him like she's been following Haruno her entire life.<br>The only end that can save Yui and Yukino at the same time is a Yui end.<br>If Yui wins Yukino can still be her and 8man's friend and can start to follow her own path.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Blogshit </br>  <br><br>Are you kidding? We are being constantly pounded with Yukino's problems for two volumes now. Especially this one.<br><br>By this point is almost seems like the main theme of the series is Yukino confronting her issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know . The continuing plot mostly revolves around her and it sucks.</br>  <br>She is because the entire story revolves around her since Vol 6 or so.</br>  <br> The only end that can save Yui and Yukino at the same time is a Yui end <br>Elaborate</br></br>  Honestly 8man doesn't even have much chemistry with Yukino.<br><br>They don't feel like they have romantic tension like Yui and he does.<br><br>They feel more like friends. If you made Yukino a guy, the show wouldn't change at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But having "everything" is impossible for Yui's case, because it would mean her claiming Hachiman AND still be friends with Yukinon, in which if we assume that Yukinon has feelings for Hachiman, too.</br>  <br> 333 <br>Holy shiiiiiit</br></br>  <br>By that logic, Yukino can never have a romantic relationship in her life.<br><br>8man already said she can solve her own problems without his help. We still have an entire Volume left to go.</br></br></br>  <br>What? The entire plot revolves around her.</br>  <br><br>Nah<br><br>Yui is being immature and selfish. She needs to learn how to copy with rejection. That's what a Yukino end would accomplish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first time she says she wanted to be like Haruno 8man just tells her she's fine the way she is, which for a while stops her from depending on anyone and actually decides to work alongside everyone including Haruno.<br><br>She has the capacity to save herself, she just needs to know how to do it.</br></br></br>  Why do all the good anime have to turn into shitty harem ones? Dropped  <br> That's why a Yukino end wouldn't solve anything. <br><br>Single forever</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people keep on feeling that you have to cannot seperate romantic feelings with her identity issues (which I think is the real problem, not dependency)</br>  <br>all praise the edgelord.</br>  <br><br>She had barely any screentime this season. If anything Yui feels more like a main heroine.</br></br>  <br><br>She was basically ordering Yukino to sink her own ship in exchange for Yui fixing her problems.<br><br>She was trying to make Yukino back off Hachiman AND accept being Yui's friend still even if Yui gets Hachiman.<br><br>She was appealing to that inability for Yukino to stand up for herself. And she almost got away with it until Hachiman intervened. Though Yui probably expected Hachiman to not accept that. Of course we must also consider that Yui seems to think Hachiman has feelings for Yukino. So that might have played into her expectations of Hachiman refusing her offer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why she asks Yukino is she's cool with it. It's selfish. She's using Yukino's troubles to convince her into accepting her own relationship with Hachiman.<br><br>She wants to win everything. Get Hachiman for herself and remain friends with Yukino. But it wouldn't truly solve anything. That's why he refuses.</br></br></br>  <br><br>From reading your posts, the best ending is rejection to both of them</br></br>  <br>Do I really need to?<br>As I said before, a Yukino end wouldn't be healthy, she has to stop following someone and start to follow her own path. We saw on episode 13 that she was following 8man's when she talked to Haruno.<br>And about Yui's end. She loves him for a long time and they could be happy together. If Yukino start following her own path they can still be friends and go out together. It's the only way to "save their club".</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you watch only fragments of the anime? That couldn't possibly be more wrong.</br></br>  <br>Worded that horribly; <br><br>You can tackle love issues seperately from her other problems. <br><br>Take the cookies. She wants to express her feelings for hachiman but cannot do it without someone pushing her (her character has needed pushing to get things done for a few volumes now)<br><br>By having her step up and tell her feelings/giving him the cookies for Hachiman, its a step on the right path for Yukinoshita.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've hated Yukino for so long, but now I finally realize why. <br><br>She's such a fucking coward holy shit. Just do something, anything, and you might not be such an insufferable cunt. Stop relying on other people and not even having a personality of your own, it's actually pitiable.</br></br>  <br>Are you the positive reinforcement guy that pops up from time to time?</br>  <br>And then title drop. Love it. Notify the editors.</br>   People thought Yui was pulling a minori and trying to sink her own ship <br><br>She does the complete fucking opposite. She uses Yukino's identity issues to try and trick her into accepting a Yui/Hachiman relationship. <br><br>I'm really liking this final stretch. All three character are coming to light and showing their true colors.<br><br>If you had told me that by the end Hachiman would be the less screwed up character I would've laughed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It ended with yui almost succeeding in keeping them friends forever, but 8man convinced yuki not to accept. Basically, we're back to were we fucking started.</br>  <br>lol this is worse than the onii-sama compilation. it almost morphs into a sublimial alien language by the middle.</br>  <br>Does this mean you liked her in S1?</br>  <br> 8man already said she can solve her own problems without his help <br>That's the point. She has to solve her own problems before she can get a romantic relantioship.<br>She doesn't need a boyfriend at this moment of her life, what she need right now is to solve her problems with her family.<br>A Yukino end would make 8man solve her problems for her, like he's solving everyone's problems from the beginning. We need character development, for both of them and a relationship wouldn't be helpful.</br></br></br></br>  So Yukino still can't bring herself to confess to Hachiman, huh?<br><br>It's obvious to everyone that Yui likes, him, but I wonder if the series will end with Yukino finally getting the balls to tell him how she feels.</br></br>  <br>I managed to put up with her bullshit for some of it, but it's just ridiculous to me that someone with all the personality of a chair can win this.</br>  As much as I love Yukinon, I really want Yui end. I just want, for once, for the underdog who is always struggling and getting hurt the most to win.  <br>Dubs have spoken</br>  <br> A Yukino end would make 8man solve her problems for her <br><br>You're assuming far too much. Her main problem is lack of action. She goes with the flow, and ends up depending on people. THat's why she freaks out when Yui tries to leave when she's about to give her chocolate to Hachiman, or why Yui has to push her towards giving him the chocolate.<br><br>What she needs right now is not to be alone. She has to find out what she truly wants, and chase it for herself. To have Hachiman reject her would just be a repeat of her relationship with Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I really want to see the proactive girl rewarded for once.</br>  <br><br>you and me both buddy. That and it's near inconceivable to me that the girls would break their friendship by this point.</br></br>  <br> and getting hurt  <br><br>Oh fuck off. She has the absolute easiest. Yukino suffers the entire S2, and half of S1. All Yui does is act like a sad puppy around 8man.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm curious about her cookies she wanted to give to Hachiman. She couldn't do it by the end of vol 11. But vol 12 is probably going to pick up immediately where 11 left off. Maybe she gives them to him near the beginning after she's given her request and everything.<br><br>However I get the feeling like her inability to either express her feelings to Hachiman or give him those cookies throughout the volume is foreboding somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did we even watch the same episode? Hachiman would never solve Yukino's problems for her so I dont see why that would be a problem for a Yuki end.<br><br>Also, I think you're being too harsh on her. She can solve problems and she can do shit; we've seen it in the LN's from time to time but the problem is she lacks the confidence. She just needs to find that spark again<br><br> “In the end, I’m the one who’s unable to do anything the most,” Yukinoshita muttered, looking at the indistinct sunset. <br> “You’ve done more than enough. It’s not like Yuigahama and I are any good at scheduling. Isshiki’s pretty good at bragging and making ends meet, but she’s not exactly the type that can plan things…” <br> “So, uh… you’ve been a huge help.” <br> “It’s simply an emergency countermeasure in the event we don’t make it on time. We’ve already factored the extra expenses that will come with making corrections in the budget, so there shouldn’t be a problem. I’m afraid we may not be able to do a final check on everything, but… there’s little we can do given the situation,” Yukinoshita said, and smiled. In order to deal with any unforeseen accidents, she prepared a schedule with a buffer as a last resort. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the proactive girl rewarded for once. <br><br>You will, when Yukino finally gets the courage to confess to Hachiman in Vol.12.</br></br></br>    <br> A Yukino end would make 8man solve her problems for her <br>Yes, in the same way that buying a new car automatically refinances your mortgage.</br></br>  <br>I think that she finally expressing her feelings for him will be a big part of Vol.12.</br>  <br> What she needs right now is not to be alone <br>I never said that she has to be alone.<br>She need friends. She needs Yui as much as she needs 8man.<br>If she Yukino win, Yui would still try to be her friend, but things would never be the same, she would be losing something.<br>If Yui win it's easier for them to still be friends since Yukino is a strong girl (or at least she tries to be).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek that actually happened to me once</br>  <br>Didn't you know that teenage crushes are the highest form of suffering?</br>  <br> courage to confess <br> being proactive <br><br>Well yeah, after being squared by 10</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're assuming no positive growth for Yui.<br><br>Yui has to be able to cope with explicit rejection in a healthy way. She's like the only major character in the series who has never been flat out rejected. She has been indirectly by Hachiman before, but that's not the same. For starters she's never quit trying to get him. She needs to learn what it's like to be "not chosen" and not take her ball and run away.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They both lose regardless. Yukino wins, Yui loses, Yui wins, Yukino loses. Someone will get hurt. That's the entire point of Sensei's speech all the way back in Vol.09, and of Hachiman's final speech in Vol.11.<br><br>He knows that by baring their feelings, they ight get hurt, but he cares about them too much not to do it.</br></br></br>  Why does Yukinon copypaste?   Yukino pillow <br><br>Are there any  Saki ones? </br></br>  <br>Yukino has the trauma of not being chosen. In order for her to overcome that and show some character development, she will suffer the fact of not being chosen again</br>  <br>I dont think you understand what the prefix "pro-" means anon.</br>  <br>I mean Jesus, Yui was not fucking suffering by this series standarts. Yukino was. Hachiman was. Hayama is. <br><br>Yui has the absolute easiest. If anything, she became much more interesting now that she tried playing master manipulator by trying to convince Yukino to drop out of the 8bowl.</br></br></br>  <br>I want an unagi one.</br>  <br>You're beyond help</br>  <br> Did we even watch the same episode? Hachiman would never solve Yukino's problems for her so I dont see why that would be a problem for a Yuki end. <br>He would have to.<br>Yukino can't even talk to her own sister without copying 8man's words.<br>She would never be able to solver her problems with ehr mother by herself the way she's right now.</br></br></br></br>  I wish this was written as a VN so everyone's free to choose their own girl.  <br>I don't trust you.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  So, Yukino got her own place to stay so that she'd be able to overcome her dependency issues. Her mother was against it, but her father was overjoyed, according to Haruno.<br><br>I wonder, does Yukimom really want Yukino to overcome her problems? Or does she prefer the more pliable doll Yukino to do her bidding?<br><br><br><br>There is a VN. And another one coming.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She been rejected/ignored 3 times.<br><br>It's nothing new for her.</br></br></br></br>  God S2 was fucking shit. I wanted a romantic COMEDY not a shitty dorama.  Yui's suddenly angel ways don't wash with me, i know ulterior motives when I see one.  <br> Yui has to be able to cope with explicit rejection in a healthy way <br><br>This again<br><br>How about we change the statement: "Yukino needs to be more proactive in pursuing her relationship if she want to be with someone she loves."<br><br>Also, do anyone ever give a shit what kind of effect 8man will take if he's losing one of them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do you think they are releasing another Vita game? </br>  <br>How the hell is Yui encouraging Yukino to get her ass moving "trying to convince Yukino to drop out of the 8bowl?"</br>  <br>if you're still hanging out with high school kids when you're in college you're just a fucking loser</br>  <br>you know that anon is at least correct in some regard. that's why it hurts.</br>  <br><br>She's never been directly rejected. If she was truly rejected, she would have given up on 8man but shown the maturity to not turn on her friend. But that has not happened. That's where she needs to grow.</br></br>  How the fuck can you be so useless?<br>Literally Yozora all over again.</br>  <br>Hachiman has already fucking said that she'll solve her own problems. He won't do it for her. Jesus fucking christ, he knows exactly what's going on, and knows that she can do it by herself.<br><br>What he doesn't want is for her to lose sight of what she truly wants just because it would be an easy answer. Yui wanted to win, get 8man for herself and continue to be friends with her. <br><br>Hachiman called bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will we ever return to this in a Yahari thread?  <br><br>  "Yukino needs to be more proactive in pursuing her relationship if she want to be with someone she loves." <br><br>I absolutely agree.</br></br></br></br>  <br>except her problem isn't dealing with rejection.</br>  <br><br>You're helpless <br><br>He literally says that Yukinoshita needs to solve the her own problems. And he knows that he can because he's seen it before. She's a "strong girl"</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui encouraging Yukino to get her ass moving <br><br>She said she was going to win the competiton, get 8man to make Yukino's dependency issue stop and still be friends with her. And she would've gotten away with it if this wasn't "I've seen some shit" Hachiman.</br></br></br>  Yui was a bitch this episode. Trying to capitalize on Yukino's problems by saying she'll 'take' Hikki for herself so Yukino will stop relying on him and then they can remain friends forever!<br><br>That right there is cold shit. "Oh I know you like him too but fuck you he's mine but let's still be friends anyway!" <br><br>I hope 8man really picked up on that. That's a red flag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's a "strong girl" <br>For you.</br></br>  <br>fuck off falseflagger</br>  <br><br>That's exactly what Yui's problem is. Or at least one of them. That's what she's shown in vol 11. She can't deal with it in a mature adult fashion.<br><br>But by the end I suspect she will show it.<br><br>The other issue Yui has which has been shown throughout the entire series s an inability to articulate her real feelings. She has made progress on that in the last volume.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She was basically ordering Yukino to sink her own ship in exchange for Yui fixing her problems. <br> She was trying to make Yukino back off Hachiman AND accept being Yui's friend still even if Yui gets Hachiman. <br><br>This is only the face of her proposal, designed to be as distasteful to Hachiman and still hoping Yuki herself rejects, constanty prodding for, "Are you ok with that?" and finding Yuki's response disappointing till Hachiman salvaged everything as hoped for.<br><br>Yui sacrificed her date for Yuki's sake, and possibly any hope, in her mind, of being with 8man due to her horrible self-esteem issues. Even insisting Yuki stay on the 3p date, and telling 8man to go look after her when she left the penguin exhibit.<br><br>Yui had no intention of following through with her proposal, she wanted to help Yuki out of her shell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Yukino needs to be more proactive in pursuing her relationship if she want to be with someone she loves." <br><br>Yes, that's the point. She's going with the flow, never taking chances. She still hasn't given him the chocolates. <br><br>We'll see if she finally gets the courage to do it in Vol.12.</br></br></br></br></br>  Now that's alpha.  <br> who? <br><br>Second best girl</br></br></br>  <br> Generation Kill <br><br>Thats quality animu mah nigga<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eeU<wbr>YE1XNO5E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and then when they experience the other girls' endings will they truly be at rest who is the 'best' for them.</br>  <br>the DB will fix it bro</br>  <br>So she is trying to help solve everyones angsty teen problems, keep her friends, AND confess to the boy she likes.<br><br>Wow what a selfish bitch trying to help her friends and make everyone happy including herself.</br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br> She uses Yukino's identity issues to try and trick her into accepting a Yui/Hachiman relationship. <br><br>She's a cunt. She's as cunning as Iroha and manipulative. Both of them and Yukino would be shit wives.</br></br></br>  <br>She was a bitch, but she did it on purpose. It slapped some sense into Hachiman, and made Yukino aware of how passive she'd been acting.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Foursome</br>  <br><br>I dunno. I think she was showing her real feelings in trying to pressure Yukino. If you read her diary that's been posted and some of the things she says, about being selfish and about not being a nice girl.<br><br>She absolutely would have be fine with her proposal. She expected Hachiman wouldn't agree, but she would have been happy if he allowed it. She wants it all her way and on her own terms.<br><br>However, in the larger narrative she fulfilled the same role she's had the entire series: being a bridge between Yukino and Hachiman. I just don't think it was necessarily what she wanted. Maybe what she expected however.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why she has to lose so she can get over it and become genuine.</br>  <br>Are we reading the same novel? What kind of rejection that Yui had to deal with? And how did she do that in an unhealthy or immature way?<br><br> Genuine  question since I must have missed all stuffs you have seen to get to that conclusion.</br></br></br>  <br> The other issue Yui has which has been shown throughout the entire series s an inability to articulate her real feelings <br><br>You got it backwards, m8. Yui is fine with expressing her feelings. But not so much for Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>Mad I ruined your perfect princess Yui? She's a bitch. Deal with it. These two ladies are superior to her, Iroha and Yuki in every way.</br>  <br>It would make no one happy but herself. It would deny Yukino's feelings amd not take Hachiman's feelings and request into account.<br><br>Still, it's obvious that she expected him to flip out at that. She realized that what she wants is different from what Yukino and 8man want, so she's trying to make the best out of the situation.</br></br></br>  <br> She does the complete fucking opposite. She uses Yukino's identity issues to try and trick her into accepting a Yui/Hachiman relationship. <br><br>Wrong, she tries to provoke 8man to confronting their issues by making her date an opportunity to help Yuki up. What you describe is merely the face of her proposal, designed to get 8man to act.<br><br>Thematically this makes her a brave, empathic girl, willing to sacrifice her happiness for the sake of others and by virtue alone makes her the best girl as codified in the /a/ppendix of Best Girls.<br><br>From her POV she probably thinks her ship is sunk, but on a meta level she's never been stronger before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  What's wrong with Yui having both options in mind? It gives her a lot more depth other than just hurr durr she's copying the 8man.<br><br>She wanted the proposal to get through but also had the expectations of Hachiman turning it down.</br></br>  <br><br> Using Miura as a scapegoat for your falseflagging <br><br>Fuck you. Seriously, fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her problem was to speak her mind I'll give you that. but a problem of fearing rejection? that's stretching it considering how well she took hikki's refusal. if you want to argue about rejection, then backing off due to threat of rejection might still be valid but she was able to confront that as well in the final scenes.</br>  <br><br>Wrong, her proposal would have been a the status quo, 8man says it himself that he'd be alone going with that, by rejecting it outright and getting Yuki out of her shell, they are actually moving forward for once.</br></br>  <br>You're fucking delusional. Her diary outright states that she would be fine with that sort of relationship.<br><br>If Yukino said yes and Hachiman said nothing, she'd go along and get him for herself. She has issues.</br></br></br>  <br> It would make no one happy but herself <br><br>She wasn't.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Being rejected period, such as if Hachiman flat out rejected her in vol 12. If she really has the attitude that she can't accept being friends with Yukino and Hachiman if they become a couple, then that is completely immature of her and has to be addressed.<br><br><br><br>The entire series, Yui has had trouble expressing her real feelings. Particularly about Hachiman. She has had a crush on him since the very beginning and has never been able to confess to him clearly despite trying and coming close a few times. Even here at the end, she could only manage at best an indirect confession. She has never told Yukino either which was probably a big mistake on her part.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with Yui having both options in mind? <br><br>A lot, but it served a greater purpose. Hachiman's true colors have finally shown, and he won't take the easy way out.</br></br></br>  Rough summary.<br><br> Pretty much she calls Miura unfair for using gap moe (how she's "usually a serious bitch" vs. how cute her gateau au chocolat is) and laments under her breath that he (HayaMan) has a bad personality too. She closes by saying it's good to have a rival in love. <br><br> Irohas hands him a cookie, does a 'teehee' face and says to keep it a secret 'cause it'd be annoying if people found out. Then she goes off to find the cunt. <br><br> 8man ends up standing upright blushing because of it. She's already straight up scary... Maybe the old him would have fallen for a move like that.  <br><br> In the end, 8man keeps it a secret like she asked <br><br>8man is falling. I repeat, 8man is falling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Gahamama.  <br>She wasn't at tiniest bit happy at the answer she came up with.</br>  <br><br><br>If they're making a new one, you think they will include the LN end if it comes first? I could finally put /djt/ to good use.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui cant FORCE Yukino to act, all she can do is encourage her. And if she still pussies out then Yui can make her move with a clear conscience.</br>   Yui pulls the complete opposite of Minori by stating that she's going to win and take Hachiman for herself <br> Still loses <br><br>Great. Maybe now you fucking retards will stop comparing it to Toradora.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I meant interpreting her scenes that way. I think it's the best thing to come out of character so far.</br>  <br>YES, YES! SHOW ME YOUR TRUE COLORS WRETCH.</br>    <br>We’re finally here: the grand finale. Now, onto the question at hand:<br><br> What in the name of all that is cliffhangers did I just watch? <br><br>At this point, Yui and Yukino are both fully aware of each other’s feelings for Hachiman. Yui herself finds the resolve to make a decision, which happens to be a very serious one: giving up on Hachiman for Yukino’s sake. To do this she asks both Yukino and Hachiman out on a date. At the surface it seems like a simple gathering of friends, but at the heart it’s something much more. Yui’s ultimate goal for this “date” is to force Yukino to confront her feelings for Hachiman, by pressuring her with the indirect (though direct as indirect can be) admittance of her own feelings. She seeks to use her own feelings as a weapon to force Yukino to make a decision. I think in the end, she saw the same exact thing Haruno saw: a love triangle spiraling towards disaster. As Yui starts off by playing wingman, we see how difficult this decision is for her. The bittersweet expressions on her face, coupled with Yui’s rendition of Hello Alone playing in the background (even as a Yukino supporter, that was incredibly depressing), show just how much it kills her on the inside. For the happiness of her two best friends in the world, she’s actually willing to throw her own feelings away. And when the time comes to set her grand scheme into action, it almost goes just the way she planned. Visibly trembling from head to toe, she puts her own feelings out in the open by giving Hachiman her Valentine’s Day cookies, which is essentially a challenge to Yukino to confront her own feelings right then and there. This shocks Yukino and puts her at a lost for words. As Yui solemnly awaits Yukino's answer, it’s apparent that she’s prepared to have her heart broken. I think if Yukino had openly admitted her feelings right then and there, Yui would have chosen to back out for good.<br><br>cont...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> as if  <br> If <br> then <br>You are taking shit that hasn't even happened and pretending it did. Now I can tell why you think that stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe the old him would have fallen for a move like that. <br><br>Irohafags BTFO</br></br></br>  <br> confess <br><br>That's not really her goal though. Sure it also part of her objective, but not on top of her priority. Her priority is to get close to 8man and Yukino. She might confess, but right now is not the right time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yui is a saint.<br><br>Pic related, play by play of the events.</br></br></br></br>  yukino's character arc is simply amazing  <br>Have you even listened to 8mans end speech? He's the one who imposed the ideal of a strong girl onto Yukino who in actuality is pretty weak-willed.</br>  <br><br>Oh it was a great, if very late, character stablishing moment. Yui for the entire series has been nothing but a shallow waifu-bait wish fulfilment bit tit nice girl. She finally showed what's she's capable of, by proposing something that goes against what both Yukino and Hachiman want.<br><br>First time in the entire series I really liked her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It’s pretty clear that the mind of Yukino is a mess right now. Though she’s coming to grips with her feelings for Hachiman, she is not yet prepared to take the next step in her pursuit, as evident in her being unable to give him her Valentine’s Day cookies not just once, but twice. When Yukino realized Yui has feelings for Hachiman, she may have started to feel guilty about her own feelings, which made it all the more difficult for her to confront them. She also sees through Yui’s grand plan to extent: she notices that Yui is trying to play match-maker, which makes her visibly uncomfortable. At one point, she even leaves Yui and Hachiman alone out of conflicting feelings, something Yui picks up on. But despite her keen observations, she wasn’t at all ready for the stunt Yui pulled at the end of the “date”. In a panic, she frantically tries to find an answer for Yui, and her thoughts become a jumbled mess. While Yukino may be conscious of her feelings for Hachiman, she’s also scared and confused. Her problem is that she’s thinking of everything that could possibly go wrong if she were to actively pursue her feelings. She’s scared that she might lose her best friend in Yui. She’s scared that Hachiman might not feel the same way. She’s scared that the she might lose the club. She’s scared of getting burned again by people she holds dear. Despite all of this, it seems she still found the resolve to give Yui an answer. But, before we can hear it, Hachiman cuts her off. After being saved by the 8, she elects to finally make a long overdue request to Hachiman and Yui. And again, before we can hear it, it ends on one of the most gut-wrenching cliffhangers ever.</br>   You will never two cute young sweet girls after you <br>Why are we even alive?</br>  So what Volume should i read now LN fags?  <br><br>I never claimed that it's happened. All I'm saying is that in vol 11 it has been revealed that Yui immature. And because of that, she has a problem that needs to be addressed somehow. Furthermore, we saw a hint of it early in the series. Yui thought Yukino/Hachiman were a couple and she started completely isolated them from her.<br><br>So it's not a stretch to think that the next volume will address it, most likely by Hachiman explicitly turning her down.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you read her diary that's been posted and some of the things she says, about being selfish and about not being a nice girl. <br><br>It's the same thing she says in the end of episode 12.<br><br>Yui has some self-esteem issues and knows doing her 8man ploy to get everyone in the club to move forward might cost her friendship or 8man's opinion if it doesn't work.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, keep that goggles on, m8.</br>  <br> Maybe the old him would have fallen for a move like that. <br>And so she was S1 Yui'd.</br></br>  <br> Maybe the old him would have fallen for a move like that. <br> 8man ends up standing upright blushing because of it. <br><br>If that's true then the poor man is having a hard time not giving the 8bowl to her then and there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. Hachiman is outstanding, but Yukino is amazingly written. Even Yui went from rather shallow to very deep in the last few LN's</br>  Phew I'm glad girls didn't like me at all in school. I couldn't deal with all this drama. Sleeping was so much better.  <br>You wouldn't want that drama IRL, actually.</br>   you will never have best boy   <br> bring her in <br> immediately have her leave <br>Why this</br></br></br>  <br> Draw a girl <br> Call it a boy </br></br>  <br>It's not as good as you'd think.</br>  <br> If she really has the attitude that she can't accept being friends with Yukino and Hachiman if they become a couple  <br>Since when was this stated? Nothing in vol. 11 pointed towards this, unless you have a very negative way of interpreting her proposal - which she made to give Yukino a push to speak her mind and intentionally expected Yukino &amp; 8man to reject.<br>  Being rejected period, such as if Hachiman flat out rejected her in vol 12 <br>Hasn't happened yet. With the way things are playing out, there is a 50-50 chance of it happening. However, assume it happen, how do you know she would deal with it in an immature way?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Forgot to cont... at the end of that <br><br>I think the reasoning behind Hachiman stopping Yui’s plan is pretty simple: what she was doing wasn’t genuine. At the very least, Hachiman could see that Yui was forcing herself to do something that would only end in self-inflicted pain. Hachiman, more than anybody, could relate to this situation and put himself in her shoes, because he’s self-sacrificed more than anybody else. He knows that what she’s doing isn’t the right thing to do. Whatever the future has in store for him, Hachiman doesn’t want the foundation of it to be built on deceit. I’m not even sure how Hachiman would answer either of the girls at this point. He definitely has special feelings for Yukino, but I wouldn’t say that he doesn’t feel something for Yui as well. At the very least, he doesn’t want to see Yui suffer like the way she was making herself suffer this episode. I also think he’d prefer Yukino express her feelings on her own terms instead of being pressured into it. He even says outright that he views Yui as a kind girl, and Yukino as a strong one. Seeing them both interact like that at the end contradicted the ideal images he had for them. In the end he was really looking out for them both. Even so, to say that the guy has a lot of thinking to do would be an incredible understatement. But at least now with that cliffhanger, he has all the time in the world to make his own decision. And that decision will be choosing to marry the best girl Saika.<br><br>Finished 3/3</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Noice, but why the Saika pics? I don't mind them, they just stand out.</br></br>  <br>How cute would it be if he nibbled on your dick</br>  <br>And we're asking what exactly is her problem?<br><br>The entire series, the only problem which has any relation with a character name "Yuigahama Yui" is 8man's own perception. And it really wasn't her fault to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the vita is shit fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Forgot to put cont... at end of 2nd post read 3rd<br><br/></br></br></br>  Season One was godlike.<br><br>Why was S2 so shit?</br></br>  <br>What? You really want to deal with this shit all the time? Fuck that.</br>  <br>too cute</br>  Welp, it's been an incredible ride. I hate every single one of you motherfuckers, nd I hope you die horrible deaths.<br><br>See ya when Vol.12 comes out.</br></br>  <br> Wanting to have retarded chicks around you <br><br>No thanks.</br></br></br>    <br> here,<br>I wouldn't say sacrificing your chances to even the playing field, or playing the bad role to push your friend to speak out her mind as being immature. Also, by that "early in the series" point (vol 1? 2? can't remember), she was way further from being a friend with Yukinon than now.</br></br>  <br><br>S1 was a comedy with a slight bit of drama every now and then.<br><br>S2 was a drama with a slight bit of comedy here and there.<br><br>Depends on your preference I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHAT FUKING VOLUME DID THE FUKING ANIME END AT FAGGOTS?  <br>13</br>  <br>It was a direct continuation of season 1. You should look at it as one long 25-26 episode anime instead of two different seasons of one show.</br>  <br><br>Yui has consistently been the girl who holds more empathy than 8man and Yukino combined, on par with Sensei really, and puts a lot of effort into the club, for Yukino, and 8man's sake.</br></br>  It's looking more and more like Yui is going to win. Does this mean we will never get vol 12 translations?  <br>Lying is bad and you should live your life more correctly.</br>  Why 8man reacted to the word fireworks while having a flashback to fireworks festival in S1? Weren't they also watch some fireworks in Destinyland?  <br>What, you're going to punch me?</br>  <br>Because Yui mentioned it, and the only one looking at the fireworks in Destinyland was Yukino.</br>  <br>season 1 also had more traps</br>  <br>Spyro has said before that he's fine with Yui or friendship end.</br>  <br>Yui has better chance to win, but very unlikely. Because,  she is not a main heroine #1 <br><br>Also, we'll wait until vol 11 got translated. So we'll know in which girl 8man's heart lies (aside from Komachi of course)</br></br></br>  <br>S2 got really fucking philosophical. I personally loved it but I would definetly understand why someone who was there for the comedy from season one would dislike it.</br>  <br><br>I'm telling you man, she did not pull an 8man there.<br><br>She made a move to get Hachiman and keep Yukino as a friend simultaneously, by trying to pressure Yukino to quit exploiting Yukino's weakness. She would have been happy succeeding because "I'm unfair and cruel" and "the truth is, I'd be fine with a lie" as her diary says. She really doesn't care as long as she can get what she wants.<br><br>She did expect Hachiman to not allow it and Yukino to be moved by that. But she still had to do it, even though she expected a sad result for her personally, because she had to finally at least try to take that step that's been eluding her the entire series. It ended up not being as sad as she expected. Her ship did not sink after all.<br><br>That's what she was doing in that scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why cant 8man have both girls?<br>A man only having 1 women is a modern social construct<br>He should be smart enough to realise this</br></br>    <br>Because 8man is a penguin.</br>  <br>I'm going to fuck your mother and turn her into my sex slave to make her teach her child properly.</br>  <br>If we ever cross paths then yes.</br>  <br>I think he was also watching it.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>The fuck are you tslking about? First of all Saika would be a twink since he's naturally that way and not some creepy guy trying to look like a girl. Also there was way more Saika in s2 and there were real points where Hikki could've gone full homo and not just him thinking in his head that he would like to fuck this dude.</br>  <br>Who are you, the MC of a LN?</br>  <br>He has to realize that they all genuinely want a 3p end though.</br>  <br>The point I'm trying to get at is that I like girly boys</br>  <br> Double Entendres: The Anime </br>  <br>Why don't they just 3 way? Both grills would definetly be into it.</br>   look at floor <br> "u-u-u.." <br><br>CHARACTER<br>DEVELOPMENT</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU PASSED UP<br><br>YOU LOSE</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>They're all part of Yui's harem anyways.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Character does something <br> Assume it's character development </br></br>  <br>You have to break her false persona before she can get a real one.</br>  <br>She had chocolate or something to give 8man the whole time right, but she kept chickening out?</br>  <br><br>HOLY SHIT FUCKING THIS<br>WHAT A BITCH<br><br> she's so hot though goddamit why </br></br></br></br></br>  Someone please make Yukino AMV with Linkin Park song  Everyone saying this is an 8man harem is wrong, Yui is clearly the one building her polyamorous threesome.  <br>And use Runaway or Points of Authority, please.</br>  <br>Whats wrong with regular boys?</br>  <br>Hikki is godtier in holding restraint. I would've already let go when he was seductively calling out his name while asleep.</br>  <br>why not both</br>  <br>This and a shoegaze one.</br>  <br>Didn't he went out to the woods calming himself?</br>  Big development for Yukinoshita if this episode was any indicator is her mustering up the courage to give Hachiman her homemade goods.<br><br>Also, did Yui offically make the first move in the 8bowl when she gave him the cookies? Hachiman has to know that they were just friendship/thank you cookies like the ones Yuki gave to Yui/hachi at the beginning<br><br>Has anyone who made the first move won in a japanese romcom especially when said girl isnt the dere main girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what the glasses were for.</br>  <br> Saika is even wearing what looks to be a bra in Season 1 <br> Is a boy </br></br>  <br>werent*</br>  <br>Saika is not actually a homo though.</br>  8man should just go full Touma and punch Yukino for not living her life genuinely  <br> Yui's tits extend past her arms <br> Wider than her whole body <br><br>Good job artist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have no proof of that.</br>  Whats the best possible way for WW to end the LNs?<br><br>In my opinion its  Yui confesses, 8man rejects her. Later, he confesses to Yukinon and  she rejects him  </br></br>  <br>.....<br>IT'S FUCKING MILF ERUNA</br></br>  <br>Saika is visibly uncomfortable when guys make a pass at him. I mean I hope he becomes homo but right now, he wants to hold on to his delusion of being masculine.</br>  Everyday until I'm bored.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/tplqqbrcmf.mp4<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Absolutely based</br></br>  <br>50% yes<br>Yes</br></br>   Yukino clams up again <br> doesn't know what to do <br> 8man saves her ass again <br> this fucking look <br><br>She wants him bad now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly my thoughts about every finale I've seen so far this season.</br>  This season sucked in comparison. Holy fuck.  <br>Be genuine.</br>  <br> admiralbulldog.jpg <br>dafaq</br></br>  <br>Someone who actually understands the story what the fuck is this.</br>  I've made a pastebin for links to all of the interesting Iroha videos out there.<br>for those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br>  What a melodramatic story.<br><br>Did the artists forget how to draw Hikigaya in the past few episodes? He looks different in nearly every shot. Sometimes his facial features are so low on his head he looks like he has a deformity.</br></br>  <br>Better than no chicks. And at least they are nice girls not bitches.</br>  <br>Wait did she really give up in the 8bowl? <br><br>Or does she know that what she is doing-prodding Yukino to express her feelings- makes it unlikely for her to win (because of all the Hachi x Yuki clues over the last 2 volumes). Is that what you meant?</br></br></br>  <br>She sort of did and didn't.<br>Instead of giving Hikki the cookies to express how she feels about him she goes to say it was thanks for him helping her.</br></br>  Yukino makes some pretty good faces  <br>She baited 8man because she knew he would not accept that.</br>  I liked that one episode where there were three characters and one of them said something and the other two acted surprised and then at the end you realized nothing has ever happened in this entire show  <br>That's one cynical interpretation of that scene, but I'd admit it's as valid as the other interpretation - depends on how you look at Yui's character, I guess.<br><br>Although, that'd bring up the question with why she was disappointed when Yukinon was going to agree to her proposal, and happy / didn't feel bad when 8man rejected it.</br></br></br>  <br>8man pulls off 1 final Batman and rejecting the confessions of both girls and friendzoning them. Him realizing genuine friendship is worth more than silly highschool romance.</br>  Why has Yukino changed so much from the first season? It seems her interest in Hachiman came out of nowhere.  <br>I can live with this.</br>  <br>She was always interested in him, that interest only recently became romantic though.</br>  <br>Are you anons fucking stupid? The entire nature of the main characters' relationship changed over the course of the season. No confession ≠ nothing happening.</br>  <br>this</br>  More importantly, which girl 8man really need right now? Yukino or Yui? And how 8man would react if one of them rejected him?  Yahari Oregairu is easily the most pretentious and melodramatic shit I've ever seen  <br>Yukino doesn't know what she wants.</br>  <br>I don't know how people keep missing the obvious parallels between her infatuation with pan-san, a mascot character with shifty eyes that she finds cute but everyone else thinks is creepy, and 8man.<br><br>Yes she's always liked him.</br></br></br>  <br> Hachiman has to know that they were just friendship/thank you cookies like the ones Yuki gave to Yui <br><br>Yui wanted to give him love chocolates, but she threw it all away for Yuki to get better.<br><br>In a way, her handing of chocolates were both a provocation to get Yuki and 8man to do something, and her deepest held feelings for 8man.<br><br>It's why she trembles and shakes like a leaf handing them to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> need <br>Doesn't need one, unless Taishi begin his move</br></br>  Is Yukino a skin-walker?  <br>Then you haven't seen much.</br>  Am I the only one that was disappointed by the ending?  <br>What is this autism? What's wrong with her?<br><br><br>That's what I thought as well but everyone and their mother is saying that Yui sacrificed herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need anyone anymore. He's pretty much a normalfag now.</br>  <br>This show is a shitty formulaic cash grab comprised of cheap korean animation thrown on top of what is essentially a poorly written drama CD written by a guy who clearly has never interacted with another human being. Every single character in this show is written the exact same way, I hope you enjoyed watching two whole seasons of a bad writer talking to himself.</br>  Fuck, I ship Hachi x Yuki but 8man should just babies on the side with Yui as well.<br><br>She's keeps on fucking bridging the other two together no matter what. God damn it Yui</br></br>  <br> autism <br>You answered your own question.</br></br>  MEME DRAMA    Why don't they just pin him down and take turns until he picks? Asymmetrical docking, double riding etc.  <br>Yeah, that's how I saw it as well.</br>  <br><br>You are so assbackwards in your logic that you should just stop trying to figure things out on your own forever.<br><br>Are all Yukifags this deluded?</br></br></br></br>   just finish the episode <br> literal cliff hanger into LN <br>mixed emotions</br></br>  <br>I will.</br>  <br>I want to love Yui, she is too pure.</br>  Im confused as hell <br><br>So was Yui being a hero or a villian? Was her intentions pure or was she trying to her Yuki's insecurities in order to further own own desires (but knowing that Hachiman would shoot it down regardless)</br></br>  <br><br>POETRY</br></br>  <br> not the orange one </br>   look down and stutter for 5 novels straight <br> can't speak for herself <br> can't construct original thoughts <br> has other people solve her problems for her <br> still manages to find humor in insulting 8man despite how pathetic she is even compared to him <br><br>10/10 BEST GIRL WOULD MARRY</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretends to copy WW2 <br> Yui actually wins in the end <br>Watari is the best  hack  writer ever.</br></br></br>  <br>She was trying to make the best of a not great situation. <br><br>Her making her feelings, albeit somewhat obliquely, known was intended in part to either drive Yukino out of complacency to action, or failing that to create a detente where neither would romantically pursue 8man and would preserve the club as is. As she says when 8man finally intercedes, she also hoped however that he might provide a third way out of all this, which he did. But she needed to make that first move to get him to take action.</br></br></br>  <br>She took a risk because she knew 8man would shoot it down. In her diary she was preparing herself for the consequences of failing. She would be fine with a lie if 8man didn't step in, but she was visibly unhappy until he did stop her.</br>  <br> these scenes have similar camera angles but aren't the same at all <br><br>10/10 analysis</br></br></br>  pls tell me where the anime leaves off for the light novels  <br>Option 1: Yui is secretly an evil manipulative bitch at complete odds with everything she has ever done and everything we know about her.<br><br>Option 2: Yui is Yui.<br><br><br>Take a wild guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I mean having the Axis win would be wrong as expected</br>  Was the confidence she displayed in season 1 just a pretense?  <br>Ends at the end of the LN. We got nothing left until Vol 12 <br><br>At least we got 11 animated so we got spoiled before the translation came out<br><br>We wont get that luxury with 12</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if Yukino accepts Yui's proposal, they will both have to suppress their feelings for rest of school. This is opposite of 8man's genuine request, and also not in line with Yukino wanting to be honest and make independent decisions rather than relying on others to decide for her.<br>It's a genuinely selfish request, and she's ok with that. But she was also hoping Yukino would speak up. Yui also suspected that 8man would not be ok with that proposal.<br>It's not a villain or hero thing, it's a I'm being honest with my feelings now thing.</br></br></br>  I was hoping this would end up like the non-shit half of kimikiss pure rage. Where the third wheel acts as a bridge between the two. But no, fuck you, blueballed. Hopefully the LN hits something satisfactory.  <br>So much for taste.</br>  Who else did not see the love triangle coming?  <br> wanting things for yourself is villainous <br>Maybe if you're an identity-less husk like Yukino.</br></br>  <br>Why do people keep thinking the series is only one volume?</br>  <br>Yes and no. She has shown the ability to be confident at times and stand up for herself. But after the Stuco election arc, shit hit the fan and she becomes an emotional trainwreck (no confidence, has no clue what to do with her feelings for Hachiman, worries about her friendship with Yui, etc)</br>  Now that's beta.  <br><br>  Yui is secretly an evil manipulative bitch <br><br>That's too extreme a statement. She just "isn't as nice as you think I am" as she tells 8man.<br><br>She is a nice girl who has genuine affection for both of her friends. But she wants them her way. And that's what she was trying to do, but also expecting it not succeed.<br><br>I think from Yui's PoV, she thinks Hachiman has feelings for Yukino. She does not expect to win him, but it was important for her character and her growth to really try her best to, even if she has no expectation of it working.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but Satsuki made the first move and lost</br>  <br>Of course. Inside, she is confused about her identity but outside she tries to display what others have put forth instead of being genuine.</br>  <br>Just one of the stolen personalities she carried before finding someone else to mime in 8man.</br>  <br>What happened in KimiKiss? I thought the best girl win?</br>   yui &amp; yukinon both so beta they share their first deitoh <br> "oho, why not all not be virgins anymore together" </br>  <br>This I can agree with.<br>No romantic comedy indeed.</br></br>  <br>Correct statement, incorrect conclusion. It is in fact a Haruno end that is the only thing capable of saving Yukino.</br>  <br><br>Yeah it's a bit over dramatic about high school teen romance but that's how it feels when you're a high school teen in the middle of all this.<br>Then you grow up and realize how trivial it is. Yet it still sticks to you like nothing else and you wish you could go back to it.</br></br></br>  <br> Satsuki made the first move <br><br>Then you need to reread it again, m8.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Yukino was very much her old ice queen self when dealing for example with Tamanawa during the Christmas event arc. <br><br>However, that was in a pseudo-professional environment and with individuals with whom she had no emotional connection. Old Yukino is alive as ever, but we're now privy to her family life and her personal feelings, two arenas where she has never been the confident and unflappable girl we came to know in S1.</br></br></br>  <br>It goes wrong as expected.</br>  <br>Or she'll break completely and kill herself. So I guess that's a win-win situation.</br>  <br>she was pretending to be  Haruno </br>  <br> you wish you could go back to it. <br><br>Speak for yourself. I would never want to go back to that overdramatic shit I went through in high school and college.</br></br></br>  A lot of Yukino's actions make a lot more sense in retrospect now that we know she is in love with 8man.<br><br><br>What was the point it was trying to convey?</br></br></br>  <br>Things must be broken before they can be rebuilt. Obviously, her offing herself is a risk, but it is a necessary one.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>I can't believe how fucking flustered Yukino got when her sister and mother asked her about her future. <br><br>Brushing your parents off isn't a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Says that [enguins mate with only one partner.<br><br>2 girls want the same guy. Connect the dots</br></br></br>  <br>It is in Japan especially when it comes to an affluent, well respected family. And remember, Yukinoshita has always been 2nd fiddle to Haruno her entire life</br>  <br><br>Did you make someone preggo or something? Play two girls at once and get caught?<br>Don't be a retard and it won't be that bad.</br></br></br>  Thread's really slow. Is it really the end? I don't want it to end.<br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Once it ends, some of the shitposting might also end. And maybe we can have slightly shitty, instead of really shitty, Yahari thread again.</br>  <br> picking Haruno over Yukino <br>That would kill her, in mind and maybe in body. Losing 8man to Yui would really hurt her for years but losing him to Haruno would absolutely kill her.<br><br><br>Oh, so the plaque reminded them that there was only one winner to the 8bowl? Someone should tell them Orimoto likes him and he likes her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Less shitposting waifufags, the better.</br>  <br>We'll be back to discuss this again when  you read the LN .</br>  <br><br>Yuki just can't stand up for herself at all when her sister is involved. It's sort of sad seeing her sister be so overbearing over the normally cool and confident Yuki.</br></br>  Why was Hachiman looking away at the beginning when Yui asked if the cookies were just for her?<br>What kind of cookies were those anyways? Chocovanilla?</br>  <br>I want to love this useless cunt.</br>  <br><br>Because he's aware of Yukino's feelings. He knows the implication behind what Yui was saying. And that made it awkward.</br></br>  <br><br>He knew Yui was trying to get Yuki to reveal that she made cookies for him.</br></br>  <br>Yuifag butthurt</br>  <br>brilliant</br>  <br>Hachiman probably does to some degree<br><br><br>What did Watari do to you Yukino? Still cant believe Oregairu is basically her story now</br></br></br></br>  why doesn't 8man just go out with one of them  <br> Yukinon realizes that she's not romantically attached to 8man and was just relying on him <br> She solves his problem by hooking him up with Yui and they begin to date <br> A month later, Yukinon head off to study at a private college, still following in her sister's footsteps <br> 8man realizes he never solved Yukinon's problems and that he's using Yui to feel genuine <br> Chase sequence to the train station so 8man can find Yukinon and be genuine <br> Yui has a moment where she says she'll always love 8man and Yukinon and comes with them <br> Tears, confessions, embrace <br> 8man and Yukinon end up together as Yui makes the sacrifice </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari has always been Hachiman and Yukino's story.</br>  <br><br>He will. Probably Yukino but we'll see.</br></br>  <br>But I'm a Yukinofag anon.</br>  why doesn't he just get them to go full yuri FRIENDSHIP route while sensei gives him the genuine?  <br>Rewatching that scene, there this piano music that always played whenever we get a Yuki x Hachi moment (also played during ramen walk, water ride, etc)<br><br>Did Yui ever get an equivalent? Was it the "Hello Alone" ballad?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm Yuifag and I'd admit that there are two interpretations of that scene. Both are valid possibility. Personally, I believe she was pure and a hero, but there are people who think otherwise and it will be hard to convince either side until we get more info.<br><br>So for now, it boils down to which you want to believe in.</br></br></br>  Honestly, this whole thing got way too meta way too fast.<br><br>I got blindsided by all the subterfuge because I didn't notice it was happening until I was invested in what was going on. Then, it was like everyone was playing chess with each other and no one was winning.<br><br>This anime's getting hyper than any action shonen I've ever watched. I've never felt this much tension over which girl a protag would chose. There are far more implications behind his choice than in any other rom.<br><br>The fate of the world is literally riding on 8man's future expression of emotion at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just want Hachi to blow everyone the fuck out and end up with Sensei or Saki.  <br>Dubs are not special anymore it seems</br>  Anyone feel Feel went too far with the drama or with Yukino compared to volume 11? It doesn't really feel as bad as it does in the anime or is this just because of written text?  <br> Yeah it's a bit over dramatic about high school teen romance but that's how it feels when you're a high school teen in the middle of all this. <br><br>Honestly, it's extremely melodramatic and contrived. None of the plot points are rooted in reality at all and the basic premise is outlandish. That said, the characters do 'somewhat' act like real teenagers by making everything more complicated than they need to be, but I'd hardly say this is how you feel in highschool.</br></br></br>  Yui tried to do something uncharacteristic of Yui but in the end did what Yui has always done. That's how I see it at least. I don't believe the whole scene at the end was premeditated and planned by her. But none of it came as a surprise to her either.  <br>You're overthinking, just like every fucking one in the show.</br>  <br>Probably a consequence of it being condensed. They've gotta hit all the big scenes in 24 minutes so you lose some of the milder scenes.</br>  <br/>  <br>not sure if bait or 12 year old.</br>  <br>I miss yugi</br>  <br>Shitposting actually made you dislike an anime? Man just walk away....</br>  <br><br> The fate of the world is literally riding on 8man's future expression of emotion at this point. <br><br>Clearly bait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but they're definitely playing up all the Yukino scenes (even the innocent ones) and removing all the Iroha and Yui scenes. Even Watari was surprised at how they altered the infirmary scene for their ship.</br>  <br>Nope, guy tried to manipulate me into breaking up with him and used one of my best friends to help him do it. He then went on to date a third friend who proceeded to shove it into my face that she was in a relationship with the guy I liked, but then he dumped her, and dated the other friend in order to make the third jealous. Third friend started sleeping with another guy who wound up sleeping with her and her younger sister and got the latter pregnant. <br><br>Everyone got screwed over back then in my group, and to this day three of them are still trying to contact me to apologize. I won't have any of it. <br><br>You think that's not bad? You have no idea, kid.</br></br></br></br></br>  Before the series end, I another Hachiman essay that shows his growth<br><br>And for the Service Club to have a stupid SOL Comedy request like the first few volumes.

Hey buddy. You want some classic rock cd's? I've got a ton in the back." <br> I was told never to speak to little girls I didn't know, but the offer was so enticing I foolishly replied <br> "R-really? D-do you have The Beatles? O-or maybe Bob Seger?" <br> She chuckled darkly, "Oh yeah, I've got everything. The Who, Floyd, Tom Petty, you name it. But you'll have to hop in the back here if you want me to give them to you." <br> I knew I should have ran, but part of me was too scared of what she might do if I said no, as I walked to the back I could swear I saw her licking her lips out of the corner of my eye <br> As I reached for the handle the doors suddenly flung open and about five lolis reached out and grabbed me <br> I screamed as loud as I could, but one of them gagged me with her panties and they pulled me in with their mighty loli strength <br> They pinned me down, as I struggled I heard one of them say "Sit on the bitch's face, Sanae. Shut him the fuck up". <br> Suddenly my vision was then completely obscured and my screams muffled by pink softness, with what looked like a cartoon bear's face on the back <br> As tears rolled down my cheeks they laughed at my pointless struggle. It was at that point I realized there really was no rock. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there a tag for leg-locking?  <br>Just post it.</br>  <br><br>http://ehwiki.org/wiki/leg_lock</br></br>  <br><br>He didn't leave /a/, just we ain't going to see the moot trip.</br></br>  <br>deserted island + osananajimi</br>   netorare, harem, schoolgirl   OHOHOHOHOHO<br><br>UFOTABLE PLEASES FANS FOR MONEY</br></br>  VNbabbies BTFO<br><br>GOATfutable does it again</br></br>  Rin is old and busted.

Shirou shouts from the base of the Edelfelt mansion. <br> Noticing Shirou's exclamation, Luvia starts walking down the stairs leading from her bedroom to the front door. She is wearing nothing but a purple bra and matching panties, which are hardly purposed to cover anything. <br> "Luvia, I'm never going to get home in time to feed Saber if you walk that slowly..." Shirou responds, oblivious to the musky scent Luvia has been magically spreading throughout the house for the past thirty minutes, or the private Jazz band providing saucy music from the base of the steps. <br> "Shirou... Don't you think you can forget about Saber for the night?" Luvia whispers into Shirou's ear. At this point, Luvia's hands are exploring all around Shirou's body. <br> "I hardly think I could forget about her, she's the reason my grocery bill is always so high." Shirou casually responds. <br> Luvia bends down to greet Shirou's unroused member, perhaps his other mind will greet me with more passion? <br> As Luvia is about to unsheathe the bone of Emiya's sword, her target starts walking away. <br> Shirou has found himself a spot on the couch, and started to read a cooking magazine that happened to be lying around. <br> Luvia heaves a sigh, and follows the boy, sitting down on the same couch and leaning on the boy. <br> Noticing Luvia's giant breasts asserting their presence, Shirou pays Luvia the attention she is hunting for. <br> "Oh, did you want to read this article? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have just started thumbing through your things in your own house." Shirou apologizes, a genuine smile upon his face. <br> Luvia flashes a very small, near unnoticeable signal to her head maid, who promptly drops an ice cream cone on Shirou <br> Luvia gasps, and with an "Oh no! Here, let my maid take care of your clothes, you can wash up in my bathroom," Shirou finds himself sitting in a giant bath with Luvia. <br> The two of them are naked. <br> Shirou asks <br> "Do you like fish or squid more? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   epilogue is all original material that has just about absolutely nothing at all to do with the plot of the show <br> it's better than every other episode of UBW's second season <br>Bravo Nasu.</br></br>  FINNISH PRIDE FUGG :DD  <br> Prisma is for lolicons they said <br>I watch it for Sella.</br></br>  <br>luvia confirmed tuskarr confirmed<br> but if she is, how did she lose a 1v1 manfight to a &gt;grill </br></br>  Subs out    <br>s-sauce?</br>  <br>Is her titties really 4x the size of Saber's titties?

This episode was better than the rest of the show combined. I'd totally watch series about Shirou and Rin studying at the Clock Tower.  <br> This did <br>What? No it didn't.</br></br>   Fate Shirou <br>Travels around the world alone.<br> UBW Shirou <br>Travels around the world with his waifu.<br><br>Jesus, he's better in every single way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Was Luvia always a fan of wrestling or did they just canonized that?  <br>Hopefully at some point we get that. Would love that.</br>    How can they live happy ever after if rhynos lifespan is at most 50 years?  <br> Travels around the world with his waifu <br><br>You sure about that?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she was</br>  <br>yep, Luvia is pretty nice.</br>  <br>Fuck yes, Luvia-sama!</br>  <br>Yes, that right there was a metaphorical scene in which he stepped further than Archer.<br><br>Read the last lines with Rin. She's gonna travel with him.</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody dies, by your logic there can never be any "happy ever after" and the whole phrase has no meaning. Wait a minute...</br>  So which HF movie ending we will get?<br><br>Normal, True or Superhero one?<br><br>I wish they would use Normal one than True.</br></br></br></br>  <br> HF <br>Who cares?</br></br>  <br>So what?<br><br>Shirou will die at some point, and Rin will become a free bi christmas cake.</br></br></br>  <br>They already dived into HF True's epilogue by including stuff with The Clock Tower and Luvia. They're going to have to anime original it up if they want to make HF work now.</br>  <br>They're going to use True since it's the one with the Ilya and Kirei scene. We already know they aren't going to use Superhero since they animated the rain scene.</br>  <br><br>I thought the emphasised evening-to-night passage view of Sherou's house meant that the he snuck out alone. The post credit sequence proves this, he ditched Rin.  to be with Luvia-sama </br></br>  <br>It is True<br><br>The ending however can be anything at this point based on UBW. We may see Sakura with a child for all we know.</br></br></br>   dere Rin   <br>No, the evening-to-night scene was to imply they fucked like rabbits.</br>  <br>Strange that they didn't show them together in that last scene then.</br>  <br> Swole Shirou will never embrace you <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>We will get true (it's "true" after all) but who cares? The best one (superhero) will never be done so it's pointless anyway.</br>  <br>The scene was a metaphor. Did you not read what Rin was saying? Taking a step farther than Archer. That's exactly what he did.</br>  <br>But how it will end.<br>Does she deserve it?</br></br>  <br>They'll make their own happy ending.</br>  <br>They pretty much talk about what is going to happen. Rin says she will follow him for awhile, but eventually settle down in Clock Tower.<br><br>Shirou will become a hero and wander off doing hero stuff. <br><br>It's pretty heavily implied that, while Rin will follow Shirou for a few years, they're going to end up in a relationship where Rin is a homebody and Shirou comes and goes living his chuuni life. <br><br>It's pretty much the main reason Shirou is able to move forward past the point Archer faltered at - Shirou always has someone who is waiting for him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Being Sakurafag is truly suffering.<br><br>I hope Rinfags will be at least gentle with their "HAVE FUN IN LONDON" meme.</br></br>  <br>Like, here's Nasu's guide to the scene.<br><br> *Desert scene <br> After the end credits. A desert scene, same as the opening. <br> Shirou walks alone. His strength falters and he stops walking. <br> Shirou looks down to shield his eyes from the sandstorm, and sees traces of someone else having been there (the place where Archer stopped). <br> Shirou breathes out and looks up. There's fake endurance in his expression, but it's full of hope. <br> Shirou walks away with a steady gait. <br> The camera lingers on the traces of Archer's presence, and watches Shirou leave as the shot ends. <br> (If you want to make it easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can add Archer appearing in that spot and watching Shirou off... but I think you shouldn't.) <br><br>It was basically saying Shirou surpasses Archer in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also has a Terminator Meido. Waver truly is worthy of being Broskander's bro.</br>  <br>But at least you get the movies</br>  <br>We will be getting the best scene in the entire visual novel.</br>  Alright.<br><br>Now that I've finished watching UBW what do I need to consume next. I've already played the Fate route in the VN and watched F/Zero and I'm waiting for the HF movie.<br><br>Should I just watch Fate/kaleid? Or do I need to read Fate/Hollow Ataraxia? Are there any other spinoffs/sequels/prequels that are worth reading/watching?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Hollow Ataraxia and then Kaleid.<br>Some important characters in there are from the game so it would be pretty silly to see them first in a spin-off</br></br>  <br>Really? Which one is that?</br>  <br> Wait for HF <br><br>Just play it already.<br><br>It is not happening until Late 2016 if not 2017</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-u_<wbr>QQKVZKXE</wbr>  [ ]<br>I don't want to live in a world where Heaven's Feel is adapted without Shirou vs Kotomine and At The End Of A Miracle<br>I wouldn't mind some Sparks Liner High thrown in though</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well shit, that's not exactly a happy ending I was hoping for. Couldn't they just have a happy calm life together in London? I was hoping he'd get over the hero bullshit.</br></br>  <br> Rin and Shirou don't even have sex or kiss <br> basically no romance at all <br>How so? Heaven's Feel is the true canon route anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>I was considering UBW as the lesser work upon HF, but with this ending I don't think they can top the overall experience.</br>  <br> probably going to be shitty <br> 9 second nine lives <br> another wave of memes about worms and sluts <br>I don't even care anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to read HF before getting into HA.<br>At best, you can get into Prisma.<br>Or you can go into Nasu's older, better stuff like Tsukihime or watching the KnK movies.</br></br></br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Heaven's Feel, Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai LN/Movies are all great</br>    <br> Heaven's Feel is the true canon route anyways <br>Illya universe, Sakura wins both Shirou and Emiya from Miyu world.<br><br>How would that make Saber, Rin and also Luvia fans feel?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nasu's older, better stuff like Tsukihime </br>  <br> canon route </br>  <br> I was hoping he'd get over the hero bullshit. <br><br>That's kind of not the point of the story, dude. The beauty lies in that Rin's gonna support his dream all the way.</br></br></br>  If you only look at it from RN only when do you think Rin and Shirou first had sex?  <br> watching zero before reading HF <br>you already fucked up</br></br>  <br>Rin's already got at least one Shirou on lock in Prisma.</br>  I didn't realize how badly I wanted Luvia in the epilogue. I'm happy for the rest of the day.  the only thing that i didnt like was that shirou still has his red hair he should already have white hair because projetion magic<br>see interview or Fate extra</br>  <br>That's what Sakura and HF are for. UBW was always just a shitty filler route for tsundere-loving shounenfags.</br>  So what will you do now /a/, nothing fate-related for ages.  <br> prisma illya in 2 weeks </br>  <br>Probably a few months after the war. Maybe around the same time as the Eclipse scene.</br>  He was such a cute kid.  <br>This. UBW is the power fantasy. self-insert route while HF is the true Nasu route.</br>  <br>When he is going down the path of EMIYA he had white hair in his flashback. Shirou most likely will keep his normal hair as he will not have to push himself as hard since he gain his abilities much younger.</br>  <br>Rin already won the Sherobowl in Prisma</br>  <br>I hope every secondary casual who hates UBW fails to recognize Waver.</br>  <br><br>why did he become such a twisted adult</br></br>  <br>So Rin gets housekeeper Shirou and Luvia gets the manly hulk Emiya from Miyu world?</br>  <br> Prisma and Grand Order in two weeks <br> HF movies and Tsukihime remake news soon </br></br>  who is blue guy?  <br> Shirou <br>In HF.<br> Rin <br>Some time before Femme Fatale, as Sakura makes clear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iskander<br><br>Not even once</br></br></br>  Luvia is just best everything, holy shit, she makes Rin look so plain   Luvia is gradually forcing her way deeper into the Nasuverse every year <br><br>soon she'll have temporarily hired Aoko as her sensei</br></br>  <br> Rinfags being this desperate and delusional <br>Enjoy your CG dolphins.</br></br>  So, Shirou is living my fucking dream travelling the world with the woman I love while she's being absolutely cute.<br><br>But strangely enough, I feel satisfied. Why is that?</br></br>  <br>Why are Sakurafags so cancerous?</br>  Fuck. What a pleasant surprise. Clock tower epilogue with a ton of cast appearing, like Shirou's boss and other things. <br><br>Ufotable does it again!</br></br>  <br><br><br> This level of mad </br></br></br>  <br> Tsukihime remake news soon <br>I hope so.</br></br>  <br>because they cant accept that wormslut was just a plot device in HF and that Illya is actually the true Heroine</br>  <br>I don't see the problem.</br>  <br>Because Rinfags gave us cancer.</br>  <br><br>Wait a sec there, they're only being ironic, Sakurafags don't really exist</br></br>    who is blue glasses man?  <br> responding to bait </br>  Wait, what the fuck? Are they a couple now? Did I miss something?  <br>Because it was a good end and Shirou deserves it.</br>  Why was UBW just so satisfying? I honest to goodness find this to be better than Zero in almost every aspect.<br><br>And good grief. Shirou and Rin are such a perfect pair. It hurts that we'll never see them go on with their adventures in their stay in London, and then beyond that.</br></br>  <br>archive link?</br>    <br>You underestimate Miyu's brother, he's also housewife material</br>  <br>except miyuverse shirou hair is also changing to white because projetion its had nothing to do with archer path</br>  <br> I honest to goodness find this to be better than Zero in almost every aspect. <br>Lying on the internet is wrong, anon.</br></br>  Even Japan was dragged into Unlimited Blade Works before the last episode aired.

I said this before, but I really do love this more than Zero.</br>  Not even a Rinfag but damn.    <br>Damn, that's beautiful.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm kind of curious, are animeonlyfags aware that  Saber dies immediately after being sent back to her time? <br><br>Because I can't remember if it's ever mentioned in ufo's adaptation. In the last episode here, they seemed to imply she went on to  live a full life or something. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't dislike Takeuchi's designs, but Prisma Luvia is somehow hotter to me.</br></br>  <br>In Eclipse was stated that after UBW they visited luxurious hotel for their second time, but it horribly failed when Rin accidentally destroyed switch from air conditioner.<br>Eclipse scene itself was about their third time which was also their first proper sex, that thanks to Rin turned into babymaking.</br></br>  <br> Shiki is there <br>Well, now we know who made Rin and Luvia into women.</br></br>  <br>Never played FH/A, does he still call her Tohsaka in that? Is he ever gonna call her Rin?</br>  <br>Yeah, but since Luvia gave Miyu a place it would kinda fit if she also proposed to Shirou from Miyu world to live with them too, that would of course mean Rin would get fired and she would have to live with Illya and Kuro in other Shirou house.<br><br>Two perfect families as neighboors.</br></br></br>  <br>actually it's a massive fanservice for VN reader</br>  <br>wormslut need to prove something with the old poll</br>  <br>I can't wait until the last BDs come out. It's going to be so satisfying to marathon without having to wait between episodes.</br>  <br>I can't remember myself but Rin for a fact does switch between the two depending on how she is talking to him.</br>  THEY NEVER FUCKING KISSED<br><br>FUCK UFOTABLE</br></br>  <br><br> 2012 </br></br>  <br>But that shit hairstyle!</br>  <br> no Illya <br>Fuck this.</br></br>  <br>Yeah idk if i agree with them trying to ape takeuchi's style so much, but w/e.</br>  <br>How come glasses guy never returned?</br>  <br>Why do Sakura haters always type like retarded crossboarders?</br>  "He takes after Rider in that his sole pleasure lies in Japanese video games, though he has come to hate Japan and Japanese people. He orders a large number of games, and after playing through them fully, takes the time to diligently give his thoughts on the games through their survey cards.

There's something far too entertaining about a pair of ojou-types suddenly mudflinging like this.</br>  <br>I kinda liked it as older Shirou reminiscing about his classmates and Taiga, but yeah it didn't add anything new from the first 10 minutes.</br>  <br> What happened to this? <br>Nasu is probably too busy with Fate shit to work on it.</br></br>  <br>People only vote for Sakura ironically.</br>  <br> Waver <br> cheating on Rider <br><br>SACRILEGE</br></br></br></br>  <br> ploughs chicks <br>Weiba is pure for his husbando</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/782138/499dc2<wbr>4498/</wbr></br>  <br>The fact that I need to marathon the entire series and maybe Tsukihime, KnK, Prisma, Carnival Phantasm, and such just to get ready for Heaven's Feel has me stoked.<br><br>The fact that UBW's Blue Rays will have even more content, such as Archer and Kuzuki discussing what's right and wrong in depth is gonna be breathtaking.<br><br>The wait for said Blue Rays and Heaven's Feel is gonna suck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her grave was cucked.</br>  <br><br><br>they're just trying to mimic the original Takeuchi design</br></br></br>   mostly sunny <br> everythings are bright <br> no chavs <br> king Arthur is girl <br><br>why japan so idealize britain?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>even her grave knows how to please men</br></br>  <br> Blue rays </br>    <br> What happened to this? It kind of slipped under the rug and no news came out for years. <br>The new TM ace will have news about it. Eleven's on twitter were apparently going nuts about it.</br></br>  Hollywood makes every possible superhero comic movie then decides to adapt Fate route with the flavor of the year Jennifer Lawrence blonde opposite a Japanese cast, would you approve?  <br><br>do Luviafags actually exist or is it all a big troll to bash on Rin I wonder. I mean she combines some of the worst traits possible and is also completely irrelevant to everything</br></br>  How did Waver know who Kiritsugu wanted to become?  <br>  Jennifer Lawrence <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> 3dpd <br> approve </br></br>  <br>2 looks best<br><br>and they shouldn't</br></br></br>  <br><br>The main reason I don't want to play it is the VN translation was so bad during Fate that I could barely finish it. I really don't mind waiting a year for the HF movies.<br><br><br><br>Is HF actually required before F/Hollow? I know the gist of what happens because of threads on /a/. I'd prefer to just watch Fate/kaleid and skip HF and F/Hollow, but if there's actually shit that I wont understand I guess it can't be helped.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OHOHOHOHOHO</br>  <br>I mean, she pretty much did. She just accomplished so much while she was young. Truly best grill.</br>  As Saberfag for all this years, nothing chance about that but this adaptation make me realize how good is Rin too. I never hate her but VN didn't manage to make me, love her.  <br> Fate route <br> 3D </br></br>  <br> massive fanservice <br> Into the Night doesn't play <br> fight butchered <br> Gil jobs even harder <br>Sasuga secondary</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes, it would probably be a lot more enjoyable in 3D, and J-Law is cute.</br>  <br>Does someone have the collage comparing the UBW h-scene with the FH/A one?</br>  <br/>  <br>This whole episode was heartwarming/10</br>  <br> Is HF actually required before F/Hollow? <br>Yes, actually.</br></br>  <br> Though he attempts to connect with Rin, a complete game dunce, while being internally excited about the thought of discussing video games with her, she displays no interest in Akihabara or Nihonbashi. Causing his anger to flare, the only thing he can say to her is "Fuck! You're the worst Japanese in the world." <br><br>This guy is literally 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br>They haven't actually been there</br>   mfw was arguing with some anon that Shirou won't stay in school and will eventually set out across the world being a vigilante since being a scholar doesn't suit him <br> mfw anons were telling me it was my headcanon and Shirou will stay in academic life with Rin <br> mfw this episode btfo all of them  <br><br>Based ufotable, perfect ending to a near-perfect series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I assume she's Saber? Would be kinda weird, I'd assume Saber wouldn't have a modern British accent, but a modern American one is probably worse.</br>  <br>I don't know what spoilers you know about HF, but there are a bunch of twists ruined right away at the start of FHA. You're better off reading HF first as it'll help give you more appreciation for what happens in FHA.</br>  <br>I doubt that they throw complete story out of window. They will release it eventually.</br>  <br>He read the script.</br>  <br>It's not the real grave, the Glastonbury monks just made up the story to suck up to the king</br>  <br>Why would anyone approve of this?</br>  They fucked up the referent here. She says that he's not currently on the clock as A butler, not specifying whose. This isn't a joke, Shirou works part-time as LUVIA's butler according to side-material, not Rin's.  <br><br> Rin being at fault for the choices of her father she had no say in </br></br>  <br>Yes, we can all agree Rin is the worst.</br>  <br>That Rin. That face.<br>I was not mentally prepared for this episode.</br></br>   there is a place where you can report wrong subs  Am I retarded, or was the rin-luvia fight in hollow ataraxia and not ubw?  <br><br>the subs fucked up i believe</br></br>  <br>Fate route is universally considered total shit by all but the most zealous Saberfags.<br>Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel are both far better. The difference is UBW is more consistently good, while HF is more like great peaks separated by long valleys. Some of the valleys are boring, other quite peaceful, and sometimes you run into Sakura-shaped chasms.</br></br>  so Fate/Clock Tower WHEN    <br> He takes after Rider in that his sole pleasure lies in Japanese video games, though he has come to hate Japan and Japanese people <br><br>How weeb can you get?</br></br></br>  <br>The whole London scene wasn't in the VN. Rin and Luvia have a short fight in FHA that wasn't as good as this one.</br>  <br><br>The reference is in there, the subs just fucked up.</br></br>  <br>Why is she so great?</br>  <br><br>After tsukihime remake and Fate/EMIYA.<br><br>So basically when nasu needs retirement money</br></br></br></br>  <br>i can't believe you're that stupid</br>  <br> and sometimes you run into Sakura-shaped chasms. </br>  <br>I ship EMIYA and Luvia now. Thanks faggot.</br>  is grand order going to be on iOS?  Only full blown idiots are excited about studying in Clock Tower.  <br> has come to hate Japan and Japanese people <br><br>That's by definition the literal opposite of being a weeb.</br></br></br>  <br>All the greatest parts of an imouto and onee-san combined into one perfect girl</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't call it shit, but it's definitely less interesting than the others</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't he be pretty rich at this point? His works have been some of the better selling anime adaptations in recent years, not to mention the original games, merchandise, spinoffs, etc.</br>  <br>Token loli pls go back to your own show.</br>  <br>Why did Nasu turn Kohaku into Deadpool? She was a lot better as an actual sociopath who tricked fucking everyone</br>  <br>She's not. She's a psychotic bitch who kills Shirou in the most pointlessly sadistic ways and does a 180 out of nowhere and suddenly it's supposed to be okay because "b-but muh imouto". She's awful outside of Prisma.</br>  DAMN BOY.   Full Last Stardust when?    no Ciel <br><br>into the trash it goes</br></br>  <br>The Fate route gets too much hate. It's no where near as bad as people make it out to be. Then again, the average person doesn't have any recollection of the events that happen in the VN anyway and most people just parrot the same shit over and over again.</br>  <br>He spends all his money on Dark Souls merch<br><br><br>Don't you have some worms to feed</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>vidya doesn't pay for itself. And i imagine he gets some nice royalties but I expect company's like Kadokawa, Dengeki, Gung Ho, ETC to pay as little as possible</br></br></br>  <br> UBW <br> consistently good <br>Good lord no.</br></br></br>  Waka is beyond help now.  This chapter has left me without words.  <br>CUTEST COUPLE RIGHT THERE</br>  <br>But that's too lewd for a shoujo manga!</br>  <br>Nozaki, please.</br>  <br>This manga is very lewd.</br>  Are you ready? UtaPri!  <br>is this a good anime to watch if you're a straight man?</br>  Is that a serious question?  This season was nothing but disappointments, but I still don't want it to end.  <br>Agreed. I don't know if I should hope that the last episode will be good.</br>  So CG in the performance or wonky animation like Quartet Night got?  <br>In all honesty? I'd rather go with CG than QUALITY noodles.</br>  <br>Camus looks like he's standing on Ai's foot. Is this the worst quality to come from UtaPri?</br>  <br>This shot is a contender, too. Those tiny T. rex arms, man.</br>  IT'S TIME<br><br>I wouldn't say nothing but, I won't forget the deserved solo senpai time.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o2E<wbr>G3CX2SSs</wbr>  [ ]<br>The whole thing is gold, but the relevant part starts at around 2:50.</br>    I'm the sexiest.<br><br>I liked that end of the world wind howling.</br></br>      New challengers appear.  IT<br><br>IS<br><br>TIME</br></br></br></br>  HOLY SHIT  <br>Is that Otoya's blonde twin brother?</br>  I'm so fucking hype right now  HOLY SHIT  HEAVENS<br><br>I always believed.</br></br>  S3 redeemed  IIIIIIIIIIIIII  I'm so happy.      mfw introducing new characters then showing credits screen after it   I think Japan already hates them.  <br>Barnaby looks so cool.</br>   To be continued <br>S4 confirmed or it will be a movie/OVA?</br>  <br>I don't give a fuck. Japan needs to have more fun. This is awesome. I welcome the battle.</br>   Heavens crashing in at the very last minute <br>I love it.</br>  <br>Hope it's S4.</br>  MAKE IT HAPPEN, BROCCOLI  <br>I just hope it doesn't take another 2 years.</br>  <br>Japan also hates the senpai for taking away screentime from Starish so who gives a shit. Not like it is really affecting sales.</br>  <br>New game with these characters when?</br>  <br>I missed the livestream, but did any of them talk yet? Hopefully they get some good singers for them.</br>  <br>I know. It's been pretty bad, but I waited for so long for this it feels wrong.</br>  Does this one like blood?<br><br>They sang Heavens Gate and gave self itros at the end. It was glorious, get ready to shit your pants when the torrent is out.</br></br>  <br> Monochrome Blue HEAVENS returns <br><br>Be still my heart. I knew they had to put something in here for the chance of a S4</br></br></br>  <br>Subs can't get here soon enough.</br>  <br>Not sure about character names but I got the new voices down.<br>Uchida Yuma<br>Takahashi Hidenori<br>Kimura Ryohei<br>Yamashita Daiki</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of them is voiced by Yamashita Daiki, according to twitter.</br>  <br> Kimura Ryohei <br><br>Gross.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Aw yess, I love Yamashita. The first two are literally who though.</br></br>    <br><br> Yamashita Daiki <br>Hime hime! Hime! <br>Suki suki daisuki <br>Hime! Hime!<br>Kira kira rin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just exactly what I would expect from A-1 overworking conditions and imbalancing animation quality.</br>  <br>Uchida Yuma is Kaoru from Idol@ster sideM and Yuma from Gundam BFT<br>Takahashi Hidenori is Ishikirimaru from Touken Ranbu</br></br>   Heavens' site is down <br><br>Iiiiiii<br><br>Just do the right thing already, Broccoli. Let's get this shit going already.</br></br></br></br>   【INFO】突然ですが、号外です。 http://www.utapri.com  <br>They are announcing this on Twitter 15 minutes ago and now the site is down.</br>  <br> Yamashita Daiki <br>I feel like I've heard this name before, but can't place where.</br></br>  Am I the only one who doesn't care about Heavens?  <br>YowaPeda's Onoda, Shonen Hollywood's Kira, Touken Ranbu's Imanotsurugi and Sayo Samonji</br>  <br>I just crave for more senpai but they screwed them up so bad this season. As a gamefag it feels just bad.</br>  This season was really shitty, yet I'm hyped for possible S4 anyway.   127255293 <br> Ishikimaru from Touken Ranbu <br>I'd rather have Kashuu's VA. Masuda has a nice singing voice.</br></br>  <br>Same. Especially Ranran's episode pissed me off big time.</br>  <br> Takahashi Hidenori is Ishikirimaru from Touken Ranbu <br>God fucking bless. Please BROCCOLI make a game with them, and with the same writer of Repeat and All Star.</br></br>  <br> possible S4 <br><br>Anon, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it is your basic otome shit.<br><br>No cannon homo though.<br>Just boys doing cute idol things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, completely out of character except some minutes in the end. His "personal conflict" that episosde was a big bullshit and disconnected with everything you know about him from the games. Ranran is my favorite so it was really upsetting. <br>At least there was a bit of fanservice.</br></br>    <br>Are they that much better in the games?<br><br>Because from what I've seen while being an animeonlyfag, I really don't like them.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, the one from Touken Ranbu! No wonder I seem familiar with the name.</br>  <br><br>Otori Eiji - Uchida Yuma<br>Kiryuuin Van - Takahashi Hidenori<br>Hyuuga Yamato - Kimura Ryouhei<br>Tengusa Shion - Yamashita Daiki</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime doesn't do them justice. Reiji excluded, they start out as jerks, but dere up in the most adorable way.</br>  <br> those names <br>Elite as fuck.</br></br>  <br> Hyuuga Yamato <br>Please tell me he's related to Hyuuga-sensei.</br></br>  <br> Are the characters in their original source better than in the adaptation? <br>I know it's a otome game and not a book, but still.<br>They got Reiji on point in his cheerful personality but they completely erased all of his personal conflict, they wrote a Ranmaru straight out of fanfiction, Camus was "meh" and Ai's episode was messy and just disconnected. They have a nice development and you just end up really liking some of them or even husbandofagging.<br><br><br>Every single idol is lotta better in the games, same for the princes.  Ren's route gets on people's nerves though .<br>The princes still have only truly worthwhile game which is Repeat, the rest is mediocre or just plain fucking bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who knows, but<br><br> Otori Eiichi <br> Otori Eiji <br> 鳳 映一 <br> 鳳 映二 <br>These two are definitely related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to play the games to understand them much better, just like what  said. The senpais are much more interesting and likeable there.</br>  <br>Let's not forget Raging Otori.</br>  <br>I forgot to mention that Haruka is really cool in some routes, not just <br> Eeeeh? <br> Ahn? <br> T-they sparkle </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sixth down, the kanji is the same. <br><br><br>My god. What will I do with my life until next year, or have they been planning something awesome like a sim that will satisfy fan old and new and bring Uta into a new age?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It took 2 years for the senpais get a proper game? I don't even remember.<br><br>And yes, Debut still doesn't exist and everyone knows it.</br></br></br>  <br>I can only imagine how awful his episode must have been for you.<br>Ai's episode wasn't great, either, but at least they didn't rewrite his entire character, like they did with Ranran.</br></br>  <br>Himecut and Moody blue duet when?<br>S(N)atsuki and Nagi doujins when?</br></br>  <br> Himecut and Moody blue duet when? <br>Anon, did you sleep through the entire season?</br></br>  So Raging Entertainment spinoff is a go, right?<br><br>The fans can eat a dick, make it happen Broccoli<br><br><br>Aw shit, Ryuya DOES have a little brother named Yamato.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have been eating dicks for 2 years now? I like Starish a lot but their rabid fans are hilariously retarded. Good thing the senpais are popular on their on now, and same thing might happen with these boys if there's a new game with them, they'll get their fans.</br>   Uta no Prince Sama Revolutions - 13 [720p]   <br>Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>But add Natsuki to that duo and I think it'd be swell.</br></br></br>   Uta no Prince Sama Revolutions - 13 [720p]   Reminder that SHINING is a shitty father and has 120391039 kids around the world, Raging agency confirmed for purest (so far)  <br> iDOLM@STER SideM <br><br>nips pls</br></br></br>  <br>Broccoli needs to just do it already. Unless, is there another good reason why they haven't expanded besides butthurt?<br><br>If they made sure to treat the Princes as kings, the fans would get over it.</br></br></br>  Kaoru and Masayan's little sister haven't been shown in the anime yet?<br><br> Shining store only in japan <br><br>I am jelly.<br><br>With more Heavens It'd be nice if Tomo and Haruka got CDs too or atleast Tomo.<br><br> I would kill for a route with her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if Tomo and Haruka got CDs too or atleast Tomo. <br><br>Hahaha. You're funny, Anon.</br></br></br>  Daiki Yamashita sounds weird. Too bad it's not his Onoda voice.  <br>The senpai got merchandise the second they were introduced in Debut. Heavens still have nothing, except a tiny teaser website.</br>  <br>I'll always have All Star. And ASAS which I have to finish, I didn't do it because I wanted S3 to warm me up but since it was so bland, ASAS will wash these bad memories.<br><br>Ai's songs were nice in my opinion, I especially liked the second song in the CD but sadly his episode was completely out of pace. I had fun with Camus and Reiji's episode, however I found Reiji's kind of funny for other reasons<br> "Senpai I want to write your song and I need to know more about you" <br> Aw shiet they're goint to talk about Aine, it's going to be a sad song <br> Reiji teases and NTRs Haruka from Tokiya and Otoya  <br> "Kouhai-chan, the thing is that I'm just a damn awesome idol" <br> Music happens <br>It was a bit annoying they didn't cover shit about his actual persona but well, I don't think one episode could do it justice. Still was the best senpai episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SHAFT head tilt </br>  <br>Haruka does have a song at least. Tomo-chan could get something for her ;_;</br>  If anyone cares the Hyuga siblings in order:<br><br>Oldest: Ryuya<br>Second: Yamato<br>Third: Toma<br>Youngest: Makoto<br><br>Yamato was the one that Ryuya would always fight with, right? Shit time to boot up AS again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't do the sensei routes in AS because I've read they're sequels of Sweet Serenade and honestly, I found that game boring and just finished 2-3 routes. Are they good? I might try it if that's the case.</br>  They didn't even bother fixing the CG for the final performance. I guess at least the Heavens performance was on model, although that's probably because most of it was just a bunch of stills.  <br>They could have easily connected Reiji's and Ai's episodes, since they share so much backstory. <br>But the anime didn't even cover Starish's backstories in depth, so I don't know why I expected them to do it for Quartet Night.</br></br>  I don't really like any of the new Heavens voices. They all sound weird during their solo parts, except for Uchida. Yamashita and Kimura being the worst offenders.<br><br>The original Heavens song sounded better.</br></br>  http://a.uguu.se/pkzpui_heavensgate<wbr>.webm<br><br> mfw </br></br></wbr>  <br>They had the best routes in SS, but not so much in AS. Though if you ever want to do the Rainbow Route you still need to clear them.</br>  <br>The studio still bothered far more with Starish if you recap the events. Natsuki's conflict and why he was a second personality was covered, Tokiya in S1 had a stick up his ass but they got his reasoning partially right, Masato's relationship with his grandfather, Ren's family etc etc.<br><br>Sho and Otoya were lacking in the depth the most, but their episodes were fun and they didn't rewrite their personalities.</br></br></br>  <br>D-does it mean Ryuuya will finally have a bit of his backstory revealed in the anime? Then I'm in.</br>  <br> Ryuuya will finally have a bit of his backstory revealed in the anime <br>Just like the senpais, right?</br></br>  <br> Shooting the audience with laser beams <br><br>When will these madmen be stopped</br></br></br>  <br>Thank fuck it's not his Onoda voice, you mean.</br>  <br>I hope never.<br><br>I just watched the episode again and still am floored by the fact that they brought the fucking GATE OF HEAVEN onto the stage. <br><br>Could Broccoli even integrate these wild guys into the series? What would their routes be like?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We only know something about three of them and two of them are pure jerks and the other has only 5-6 lines.<br>Not sure if excited for Utapri's first rapist jerk, hope BROCCOLI don't pull it off to attract Diabolik Wifebeaters fans.</br></br>  How long until S4? The wait is going to kill me.  <br>As long as the staff don't mess it up. I'm still pissed how they fucked up senpais episodes considering they finally had a spotlight in this season.</br>  HEAVENS<br><br>It's utterly hysterical how their performance clearly had the most effort put into it.</br></br>  Did didn't even get a new song, No way is Heavens here to stay.<br><br>Also, Triple S opening act will be Shining All Stars, and you know it.</br></br>  <br>The entire budget for QN and Starish went to them. I am torn because I love all three.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say most effort, because while it was on model it was also composed of either stills or close-ups.<br><br>They're already staying for whatever is next in the anime so new song will probably be then. This one was just sort of remake because of the new members.</br></br></br>  Shion's hair looks so soft, I want to touch it.  Senpai and Cecil figures when?  <br><br>The laser beam were probably the best animation this whole season. It's hilarious!</br></br>  What a bunch of ripoffs.  <br>So does this mean that it was planned all along, or did they just get lucky that the three original names were in there?</br>  <br>OTP<br><br>Doujins when?</br></br></br>   HEAVENS came and stole the show <br>Praise the shitty cheap CGI gods!<br><br>So what? New game? New seasons? I guess at least it is not over.</br></br></br>  <br>Never, Nips ship the shota with Miku.</br>  <br>What. Why. Goddamnit Japan.</br>  <br>What? Not Natsuki? I thought that was an easy setup. Please explain.</br>  <br>Sometimes see him Kira too.</br>    <br>Fujoshis ship anything.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure we get a new season only if there are games to advertise. So yes, it is pretty much both.</br>  <br><br>I have no idea why they ship them, but Negi fanart comes in three categories:<br>Solo fanart<br>Heavens fanart<br>Negi/Miku fanart</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That shot of the judges collapsed on the floor afterward <br><br>I fucking lost it</br></br></br>  <br>*Nagi</br>  <br><br>Will Heavens be arrested for manslaughter?</br></br>  Why is he so perfect?  <br>Because derp moe, and shittiest english.</br>  <br>That episode was the best.</br>  2 more years of waiting... sigh.  <br>Homo episodes aside, some Music 2 episodes were really funny.</br>  <br>Sugita, please.</br>  <br>Maybe it will air next year?</br>  <br>I really, really hope so.</br>   Ending looks like it's leading up to the usual happy group sing along <br> Then HE★VENS completely hijacks it <br><br>Best scene this season. But do they really have enough budget for a third one? This is the episode that they're supposed to go all for and it was still full of PowerPoint slideshows.<br><br>Either way, next time they have to shove Red, Cat, and Hat into one song so that the rest don't have to suffer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are also some Sho, Ai and Nagi fanarts together because they're the "cuties" of their own group.</br>  <br>Meant a fourth season, now I'm really going blind</br>  <br><br>I just bought a ticket for a local Love Live movie showing in a few months. I was thinking that it wouldn't be so bad if Utapri went the movie route too and if it were shown worldwide.</br></br>  <br>Two different seasons are two different budgets. And it is not about if they have the money, because surely they do and milk it very well. There is just no point to making the budget any higher. It won't translate to actual sales.</br>  Speaking of overseas, Broccoli-senpai noticed us.  <br>It would probably take forever to get subs for a movie, so S4 is the best choice for me.</br>  When will this mad beast be stopped?  <br>Why would they show it worldwide if the games weren't released overseas?</br>  <br>But think about that movie budget. I'd rather wait than get another S3 full of quality.<br><br>In4 the movie also has cg dancing.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Haru-chan a cute but please don't try to compose anything for Syo, Otoya and Cecil, it just won't work no matter how much you try.</br>  <br> hope BROCCOLI don't pull it off to attract Diabolik Wifebeaters fans. <br><br>pls no, this series is too lighthearted for that.<br><br>If there were a spinoff I'd hope the heroine would have a bit more backbone than Haruka and be able to easily handle them, but maybe that's asking too much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Point still stands. They really need to release a Vita batch so AKSYS can work on it.</br>  Kuroko no Basuke ep 75  Is this the last episode? Fuck.

The sister part is NOT confirmed, but it was shown in TG iirc that a woman looking like Shuu lost her eyes and now Sharkboy is dreaming about nutcracker without eyes and shit.</br></br></br>  Is it me or does she look suspicious a bit ?<br><br>I think that she was send by Arima to watch over Haise after the auction, since Haise begun to act strangely.</br></br>  <br>I stopped caring about Haisebitch or the Quinx.<br>I wonder what's up with Hirako and that looking-like V dude.</br></br>  <br> a woman looking like Shuu <br>Er, what? Don't you mean, it was shown in TG that Shuu (that is, Tsukiyama) plucked a girl's eyes out of her head and had them sauteed for him to eat?
