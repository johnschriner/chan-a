But if she really destroys the whole island (as the title of next chapter implies) that would put her at the Dragon level, much above Gildrarts and Makarov.  <br>In Jojo Bizarre Adventures Part 5 the villain has a bullshit ability that messes with time. One of the previous protagonists fights him and discovers a way of getting around that power... And it matters not, because even without that the villain has the simple power of being strong and fast as hell.</br>  This will be GH all over again.<br><br>  These guys are so fucking strong <br>  rapes Natsu in the first round <br>  Master say there is no way they can beat them <br><br>  They beat them anyway just because. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how shounen rolls.</br>  How do you turn a girl into a catgirl?  <br>I'd trade anything to get a cyan.</br>  With AR of course.  <br> wewill be able to transform 3dpd into cute catgirls via AR in our lifetime <br><br>Oh god yes, I didn't know I wanted that until now.</br></br></br>  <br> we will all see each another as cute catgirls <br>The future is bright.</br></br>  <br>Give me a girl who can play the keyboard.</br>  How the hell did the "World champion" let thing get that bad?<br><br> no castling <br> apparently didnt move the rooks at all. <br> Lost despite having a rook and bishop advantage over the enemy. <br><br>jesus christ Japan. cant you play chess?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And don't get me started on how badly Brandon Sanderson wrecked the ending of the Wheel of Time series, I mean jesus christ</br>  <br>This guy's been spamming threads at an increasing rate the last few nights. Just report and move on.</br>  <br>Bakers boy was far worse.<br><br> mfw they published some sluts fanfiction  <br><br>It was so easy to be a writer in the 80s and early 90s.</br></br></br></br></br>  Game of Thrones on the other hand, I liked a lot simply because it was actually genuine a lot of the time  <br>"Report"? Who do you think you've been reporting to, faggot?</br>  That orbital strike was a thing of beauty.<br><br>Yuhata's the bomb.</br></br>  TWO hoshijoros nigga, TWO  JUST FINISHED THE EPISODE<br>MANGAFAGS, I NEED YOU!<br><br>Why is placentajiro sad!? Does she have Hoshijiro's memories and emotions? Is Hoshijiro even technically dead, or is her mind in some sort of Gauna-limbo gestalt consciousness thing?<br><br>Is there even material for a S3 to be made? Does anything about the Gauna get explained in the manga from where the anime has left off?<br><br>Why is being an Izanafag such suffering?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a dakimakura cover.</br>  <br>We can't say for sure why she's sad. Her expression was a bit more ambiguous in the manga, though it still looked sad to me. The placenta has copied Hoshijiro's brain, so the Gauna was likely at least influenced by Hoshijiro's memories or desires. But since her brain was replicated, she might possibly at some point regain full consciousness as "Hoshijiro". Both placenta clones did definitely become closer to her personality.<br><br> Why is being an Izanafag such suffering? <br> implying it's even close to the suffering of being a Hoshijirofag </br></br></br></br>  <br>She's dead, Jim.</br>  Yuzu with her hair down is the cutest.    Keep in mind that no one actually talks about the fucking cards in this series. All it is to people now is service bait to keep the lonely weeaboo losers like myself playing the game cause of MUH SEXY FEMALE DUELIST.<br><br>I thought 5D's would have shown everyone who had common sense that the animes are pure shit now cause there is no fucking storyline to anything anymore. There's no fucking goal for the fucking duelist anymore, and if there is one it's pointless to even reach at this level.<br><br>Black Cards? Really? I was even ok with Synchros but now. Now it's just pure utter garbage. They're trying to do as many variants of Special Summoning and Fusion as possible and are failing horridly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>get out old man</br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br>At least use a different picture.</br>  JIBUN WOOOO  IMA ANATA NO KOE GA KIKOERU  <br>BELIEVEEEEE IT</br>  FUWAFUWA TAIMU<br><br>FUWAFUWA TAIMU<br><br>FUWAFUWA TAIMU</br></br></br></br>  BOOTY BOOTY BOOTY BOOTY  <br>RINGO MOGIRE BEAM</br>   4 days <br> 4 volumes <br><br>Tonight, Destruction.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm listening to this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l2P<wbr>oSljk8cE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br><br>varying degrees of NOPE</br></br></br>  <br>It could be bigger than Godzilla</br>      Volume 12 is going to be released  someday .
