[ Let us discuss the greatest SoL anime there is and ever will be.<br><br>What is your favourite episode of K-ON?<br>What is your favourite HTT song?<br>And, most importantly: what is it that makes Azusa so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  Alright kids, hold on to your butts because this is about to get ugly. I know some of you dickwheels think your waifu is hot shit, but think again. Let's pretend a girl from K-ON came alive and started dating you. If that girl isn't Mugi, you just got FUCKED. PERMANENTLY.<br><br>Why? You're shit. Fuck your life, kid. You need someone to take care of you, that's why you're still living with your mom. Guess what, the ONLY bitch capable of that in K-ON is Mugi. Yui’s in the same boat as you, Ritsu’s batshit insane, Mio’s high maintenance, and Azusa would get pissed at how you don’t work and leave you, just like your last girlfriend.<br><br>Even ignoring that, you still have to entertain your waifu. I bet you can’t entertain any normal person, that’s why you have no fucking friends. The only K-ON girls you could please are Yui and Mugi, because they are easily amused. The difference? Yui likes simple shit because she’s on the border between retarded and braindead. Mugi adores homely things because before high school she lived a luxurious but lonely life. Not only that, she actually LIKES taking care of people, which means that you make her happy BY SIMPLY EXISTING AS THE DEPRESSING EMBARRASSMENT TO YOUR LORD(S) THAT YOU ARE.<br><br>And another thing. She’s RICH. With Mugi you wouldn’t need to work a day in your fucking life, yes that’s right you could finally silence that voice in the back of your head saying you’ll never amount to anything cause you just hit the god damn jackpot. Mugi’s so smart, she actually recognizes that a life of wealth is unfulfilling. That’s right; she can see that the simple beauty of humanity is more precious than money, something you’ll NEVER UNDERSTAND. Choosing a waifu other than Mugi is like saying “hey /a/, I plan on shitting on my own dick when I get my ribs removed to self-fellate better so I can recycle my bodily waste as food.” So choose Mugi you pig-dicked minge, or get fucking killed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a NEET though</br>  <br>'k</br>  <br>No, of course you aren't, you just don't make an effort in class because you are on another plane of existence when compared to everyone else at your school. <br><br>Stop lying to yourself, Anon, Mugi is the only one who can truly offer you what you need. <br><br>The sooner you accept it, the better off you will be in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty rude imply that Mugifags are all pathetic NEET hikikomori neckbeards,<br>even ruder to imply that Mugi's standards are that low</br></br>   there are unironically people on this website RIGHT NOW who are unaware that azusa is the best girl   <br> tfw no retarded Yui gf <br><br>It hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw no bossy Azusa gf <br>suffering</br></br>  <br>I just started watching K-On because I hated moeshit. <br><br>It's amazing, I'm just smiling throughout the whole show. I'm watching every moeshit now. I don't even remember why I hated them.</br></br></br>  <br>It's all downhill from here on because K-ON is the best of the moeshit</br>  Tsumugi's Tsumugis.  <br>Which Tsumugis are we talking about here</br>  Ritsu is perfect wife material. She is cute, fit, easygoing and down to earth, and funny. The other Keions are great too, but the rest of them have more negatives than Ritsu does when looking at them as potential wives. Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. Ritsu may be lazy but she is nowhere near as bad as Yui is. Ritsu could be reasoned with and taught to do things. Yui would just forget to do everything I told her to do. Mio and Mugi will both get fat once their metabolism slows down in their early-mid 20s. Many would think that Mugi being rich would be a huge positive for her, but to me it isn't. Even though she would be kind about it, she would always expect more than what I could provide for her on my own. I also would not want to leech off of her family's money. Mio's personality is adorable but overall I prefer Ritsu's. Ritsu is just more interesting to me. Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. I don't want to deal with her tsundere bullshit for 60 years. Jun is a fucking shit. She deserves no explanation beyond that. Ton-chan would be a better wife than Jun would be.  <br>eyebrows</br>  <br><br>shit gettin way too real in this thread about cute chinese cartoons</br></br>  <br><br>But she would want to kill me too.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Mugi would be great because of her money, but maybe I could get motivated to at least work for Azunyan if she could came alive.</br>  Isn't ritsu's birthday next month? I have do do something for her.  <br>This. When people say that Mugi is the perfect wife and Azusa is high maintenance, Azusa wouldn't stand by and let you fall into a wasteful NEET life, she would help you to improve yourself.</br>  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  <br>Ritsu is great, but I prefer more feminine girls, so there she goes.</br>  <br>She'd just constantly yell at you. At least with someone like Mugi or Ritsu, we could get out and do some cool stuff.</br>  M-M-Mio.<br>I think my favourite episode would have to be the field trip</br>  <br>Way to exaggerate.</br>  <br>That's bullshit though, she probably would if you act like a retard like Yui but she has a compassionate side that seems more real than any of the others</br>  <br>Mio is adorable.</br>  <br>are you saying she wouldn't do a whole lot of yelling?<br>I guess she'd be good at femdom, which could be a big plus.</br></br>  <br>Not unless you're a complete fuckup, but then she wouldn't be dating you in the first place</br>  <br>It's not like she's yelling left and right, she always has her reasons to yell, and they are not aggressive yellings.</br>  <br> I hated moeshit.  <br>Can you tell me why?</br></br>  <br>don't bully the Yui</br>  <br><br> implying I wouldn't feel awful about being such a worthless piece of shit burden on a literally perfect human being and not better myself just for her <br><br>The fuck is wrong with you retards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, HEY.<br>If it'd be Mugi, I'd cook excquisite food for us every day  from her money of course </br></br>  <br> implying she would be dating a worthless piece of shit in the first place </br>  <br>I can't remember why I hated moeshit. I just avoided it. Now K-On is the fucking best.<br><br>Yui best retarded gf, she's literally perfect for a stupid neet like me.</br></br></br>  <br>I suppose you have a point, still Mio and Azusa are a bit too strict for me.<br>I can relate much more closely to Mugi, Ritsu, and even Yui who are basically bro-tier.<br>I'd have hard time trying to have an intellectual conversation with Yui, though. that's kind of a deal breaker</br></br></br>  <br>Not him. I used to feel similarly. I guess anime with all-girl casts used to offend my younger, more immature, masculine sensibilities.<br>One day I became older and wiser when I decided to cast away my preconceptions of the genre and try an anime I had seen on a lot of AOTY charts around here, ARIA. Ever since then I've considered ARIA the GOAT. After finding ARIA I explored the CGDCT genre and found it to be peaceful and relaxing like nothing else; perfect at the end of a long, stressful day.<br>I now realize that to be able to accept and be secure in one's love of cute things is one of the ultimate hallmarks of masculinity, as all humans instinctively love cute things, it's just that some of them are too big of pussies to admit it to themselves or others.</br></br></br>  who are all these shallow fucks who only care about Mugi because she's rich? the whole point of love is that it's a bond. <br>how could you possibly say that you love your waifu, if all you care about is money? seems a little off to me</br>  <br> Implying Mugi has any character to speak of beyond "the rich one with the eyebrows" </br>  <br>Hey, nobody said "only", it's just a huge plus for someone who probably has freezing to death on street or starving to death as the most possible future aspects, like myself.</br>  <br> and the one that is able to find joy in the simple, beautiful things in life, looking at any hardship with positivity and never giving up, and wanting nothing but to spread her good vibes onto other people <br><br> also ripped and intelligent as all fuck <br><br>Literally perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why not join your country's military then? did you not finish HS?</br>  <br>She just doesn't seem "real" enough to me if you know what I mean.<br>Head always in the clouds, doesn't seem like somebody you could have a meaningful conversation with.<br>But then again she's barely developed at all in the series so it's not really her fault</br></br></br>  <br>Because I'd end up being Private Pyle</br>  <br> She just doesn't seem "real" enough to me <br>No shit. Because she's perfect, and perfection doesn't exist as it's merely a concept.<br><br> doesn't seem like somebody you could have a meaningful conversation with. <br> implying she wouldn't be the best to talk philosophy with <br> implying she isn't well versed in world cultures and history </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better than being homeless. I'm probably going to end up in the military once my parents finally kick me out</br>  <br>She's a moéblob. There are literally hundreds just like her.</br>  <br>I finished HS thank you very much.<br>I'm just chronically lazy about things like that, have probably some kind of social and work phobia, my eye sight is getting beyond repair bad yet I never go to doctor, and that applies to some kind of ugly disease that's slowly spreading from my crotch down my thighs, and it's itching, burning and fucks up my skin.<br>That's why money is a huge plus.<br> so much for blogging </br></br></br></br>  <br> disease that's slowly spreading from my crotch down my thighs, and it's itching, burning and fucks up my skin. <br>woah. you can't just say that without posting pictures</br></br>  <br>You don't want to see that, believe me. It started when I was 18, that was 10 years ago.</br>  <br>like this?</br>  <br>I see Junji Ito's mind is leaking into the real world</br>  gonna marry ritsu  <br> no socks </br>  <br>fuck off, normie. that's my fetish.<br>I'd totally lick her shoes. especially after a long day of running.</br></br>  <br>You're misinterpreting the post, and it's more about the sweaty feet, but yeah. Drummers get really sweaty.</br>  <br>She is shit because she doesn't wear thigh highs.</br>  <br>Sure, if you're fine remaining a virgin for the rest of your life.</br>  <br> bisexualism isn't a thing </br>  <br>None of the girls do.</br>  <br>it's a mental disorder</br>  <br>It can be, but it isn't.</br>  I am literally going to marry Azusa  <br>Yui, this board isn't for you.</br>  <br>/u/, please return to your containment</br>  <br>So is being attracted to anything but genitals and vaginal intercourse. I guess we're all sick fucks.</br>  <br>It's not like kyoaniggers know their but from a hole in the ground anyway. It's because of them that we will never witness the coming into fruition the greatest ship to sail the seas bearing the flag of Yui x Akira.</br>  <br>Well done man.</br>  <br>Don't know what the fuck you're on about lad</br>   Yui's face when everyone calls her retarded <br>Pls don't bully. Yui just doesn't over-complicate things and that makes her a beautiful person.</br>  <br>you do realize that that's just a copy-pasta right?</br>  <br>not even a yuifag, but I detest seeing her cry. I want to comfort her</br>  <br>She is still my qt retarded waifu.</br>  <br>She does show signs of autism</br>  <br>Come on nigga, bitch can't even walk straight.<br> ]I really started to like her as a character after seeing her develop and generally find something in life she can dedicate herself to and find joy in without losing what makes her who she is <br> All K-ONs are equally great. <br> It's just that Mugi is equaler. ererer. err. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the evidence based on which people call her retarded is almost entirely fabricated. She's actually a genius.</br>  <br> She's actually a genius. <br>My favourite meme</br></br>  <br>Yui's just too genki to give a shit about social norms, she's not autistic.</br>  <br>She can also flawlessly play an Iron Maiden song without knowing what a triplet is.</br>  <br> Iron Maiden <br>That was Death Devil, nigger. And if you had an ear for music whatsoever, you'd know it wasn't flawless at all, or even complicated to begin with. That would explain why you mistake musical talent for autism.</br></br>  <br> play </br>  <br>I forgot, people around here don't like to be reminded of their own autism.</br>  <br>What part of my post implied I was referring to any scene?</br>  <br>sry m8, ritsu is already mai wife</br>  <br>How do you know she can play Iron Maiden perfectly</br>  <br>you say that like if playing maiden was hard, which isn't</br>  <br>Do you doubt her ability?</br>  <br>Actually, I'm a musician who likes to scrutinize shit people say about music because I have no other outlet for my talent right now.<br><br>Also, you either don't actually know what autism is or you're projecting, so you should stop using that word.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes I think that you don't actually like Yui at all and are trying to turn her into something she's not</br>  <br>I knew it.</br>  <br>All of em<br>Rice is a side dish<br> asuza  <br>lol nope, ritsu is my one and only. <br><br>But really i came here for some advice, ive been watching k-on very slowly to make it last longer because of my love for it and i dont want it to end, so what do i do once its over?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lol nope, ritsu is my one and only. <br> so what do i do once its over? </br></br>  <br>Says the person who doubts Yui's ability to play a simple Iron Maiden song.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind taking care of Yui even if she's borderline retarded (she's not) and likes simple mundane things. <br><br>Cooking for her, taking care of all the chores and leading her everywhere by the hand like some little kid and many more things.<br><br>And you know why, because she's the definition of FUN. Simple, funny and always happy cheering up everyone around her with her bright smile. I dare you to get bored even a minute with Yui by your side, and that's just impossible.<br><br>Besides she has a cute butt.<br><br>So have fun with your empty richgirl, fuccboi.<br>And nice copypaste, it's been some time since I last read it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so am i just stuck here with you people reminiscing about k-on and looking at pics of the show?</br>  <br>There's always /r/k_on :^)</br>  <br>fuck off. Ritsu is mine forever<br> inb4 womb brawl </br></br>  <br>No need to samefag, Mio</br>  <br>I can't imagine that it's any worse than /k-on/</br>  <br>Thank you for reminding me</br>  <br> I dare you to get bored even a minute with Yui by your side, and that' just impossible <br>this nigga knows. That's what I fucking love about her, and people like her - that she can create her own joy, instead of relying on everything to make her happiness for her.</br></br>  The movie and the end of the main manga were both in 2011. K-on isn't relevant anymore.  <br>It obviously is since there's daily k-on threads</br>  <br>Sh-shut up! They could still do season 3, they just haven't yet... f-for some reason....</br>  <br>Boy was I wrong! It IS worse than this place.<br>I just went to r/k_on and everyone there was talking about streaming K-On on Hulu. Not only that, but every post was just recycled shit from DA and pintrest.<br>reddit is fucking SHIT</br></br></br>  <br>Threadly reminder that there would have been a season 3 if not for Tamako Market</br>  <br>fuck tomako market.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with Tamako Market, K-ON!!! would certainly have been preferable though</br>  Is there a keion more perfect than ritsu? I don't think there is  <br> that feel when nips go apeshit angry over the most anticipated Anko episode because she turns out to have a cute crush and Tamako sales are kill </br>  <br>Yes most of them</br>  <br>all the keions are perfect  but ritsu is more perfect </br>  <br>What a generic post.</br>  <br>nah</br>  Your favorite song from each character:<br><br>Yui: Gohan wa Ozaku<br>Ritsu: Yuuzora a la Carte<br>Mio: Pure Pure Heart<br>Mugi: Aozora no Monologue<br>Azusa: Joyful Todays</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>butthurt that ritsu is best girl?</br>  <br>Yui: Sunday Siesta<br>Ritsu: Mokujise Happy 100%<br>Mio: Hello Little Girl<br>Mugi: Hummingbird<br>Azusa: All of them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank goodness.<br><br>S2 ended perfectly, a third season could never have lived up to it.</br></br></br>  <br> great <br> SoL </br></br>  <br>how could you say that you love your waifu if you wont even drink her piss?</br>  <br>That's not true love until you eat her scat too.</br>  <br> Implying I wouldn't already have done that <br> seriously, though I hate the lack of k-on coprophilia doujins  </br></br>  <br>But Yui's younger sister's name isn't Ritsu.</br>   on /b/ <br> see k-on thread <br> decide to click <br> see ritsu get hanged <br> see yui get her head bashed in <br> see mio sliced up <br>help me. I didn't know evil like this existed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;on /b/ </br>  what kind of thongs do the keions wear?  <br> on /b/ </br>  <br>White cotton panties like all pure qts<br>t. I own figures of them</br></br>  <br> tfw looking under the keion's skirts expecting and expecting them to protest </br>  <br>Mio canonically wears shimapan though.<br><br>Even my Nendo of her has shimapan.</br></br></br>  <br>I only have Azusa figures but they all have white</br>  <br> implying I am a worthless NEET <br><br>I would've been one if it wasn't for Keion, after watching it, and making Mio mai waifu I decided that I had to be a man worthy of her.</br></br></br>  <br> replying to pastas <br>Nigga...</br></br>  <br> making Mio mai waifu <br>That's not how it works, cunt</br></br>  <br> I just wanted to blog a little because right now I am happy with my life. <br><br><br>Marrying her*</br></br></br></br>  <br>this. you don't "choose" or "make" a waifu.<br>Ritsu is my waifu. I didn't choose ritsu. she chose me</br></br>  <br>You don't marry your waifu or pick some specific time, you slowly come to realise that you love her</br>  <br>Fucking this<br>and this<br><br>waifus get inside your heart and never leave</br></br></br></br>  so /keion/ how do you keep your keion-waifu close to you?<br> pic related <br>My homepage and new tab</br></br>  <br> Taringa <br>Che vos flaco genial tu waifu 10/10</br></br>  <br>6 inches away from me at all times</br>  <br>She is my desktop background, I have figures all over my desk, I carry a picture of her on me and whenever I have free time alone in a comfy place I like to relax and imagine life with her</br>  <br>not Argentinian but<br> gracias lince +10 </br></br>  <br>Have you ever tried drawing a manga or writing some sort of story with the K-on's, Azusa and you?<br>I'm thinking about doing all that myself once I have more spare time in my hands.</br></br>  <br>what is that? i can't tell if it's huge or just close to the camera</br>  <br>Why would you set any image you care about as your desktop background? All it'll do is distract you from your work. Pick something dumb as a wallpaper.</br>  <br>Oh it was like that, I started to fall for her when I was watching the show.<br><br>I just made it official for her birthday. I count that day as the day I married her.</br></br></br>  <br>the statue itself is only 5.5 inches tall<br>I also have mugi who is the same height</br></br>  <br>Nice scenery out there...</br>  <br>Yes absolutely, I'm trying to learn to draw at the moment as well as the guitar and Japanese but it's hard to find the motivation.<br>I'm thinking about writing a VN in the hope that one day I'll have the talent and/or money to make it<br><br><br>I've had it that way for so long that I've gotten used to it, it's just reassuring having it there</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's really nice anon</br>  <br>It's nice, but it doesn't last very long. snow covers the ground 8 months out of the year.</br>  <br>Damn anon, where do you live, Finland?</br>  <br>Minnesota.</br>  <br>Off by one...</br>  good night, /k-on/<br>I hope this thread is still up in the morning.</br>  <br>Loving this meme with no survivors.</br>  <br> Windows-tan <br> on Gnome <br>reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</br></br></br>  <br> Thumbnail looks like real-life Ritsu walking into your house after school. <br> This will never happen. <br>It hurts.</br></br></br>  <br>stop it anon. men aren't supposed to cry</br>  <br>I thought we were the little girl.</br>  <br>We are.<br><br><br>Me on the left.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyways I could be cuddling Yui in bed right now, instead I'm browsing 4chan and talking about how much I want to cuddle Yui in bed right now.<br><br>Let me tear up like a bitch just for now.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a second...I wrote that in the best Keion survey thing a couple weeks ago. I have accidentally created copypasta, that's pretty neat. <br><br>Sorry for blog, it caught me completely off-guard.<br><br>Ritsu better have won that survey.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>congratulations on unknowingly creating a copypasta<br>and yeah. she won https://docs.google.com/forms/d/193<wbr>AvGTbrXZ-4UgCjUUJh0LuIC_VDkXFP-Y084<wbr>DZjPJ0/viewanalytics?usp</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I've cried to K-On! so many times, it's okay anon. Late night K-On! threads tend to bring out these emotions.</br>    <br>Damn straight she did.<br><br> Jun 0 votes. <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  I had some extra cash and bought the 5th anniversary yui statue for 26 dollars  <br>can't believe my poll actually got that many responses. and it was pretty accurate, too<br>I was expecting that ERP guy to make 20 sock accounts for mugi.</br></br>  <br>Post pic.</br>  <br>I don't have it yet and it should get here by friday.<br> I'm gonna get a new job and buy them all. not sure why the 5th anniversary azusa figure is $10 more than all the others. Is the demand for azusa really that high? </br></br>  I've been fapping to Azusa weekly for 6 years, I really, really want to stop doing it but it's pretty much a hobby right now, every friday at night, I do it one, even three times. How do I stop?  <br>Oh okay, congrats on the new job. Demand for Azusa is probably that high. I know nothing about figure popularity but from everything I've seen over the years I believe that Azusa is the most popular character.</br>  <br>Sometimes I think that falling for the keions was the biggest mistake of my life, yet the only thing I think has made me crave someone so much in like, ever.<br><br>But it's too late. The damage is done.<br>I have to live with the fact that I will never spoonfeed and cook for a clumsy Yui, play sports with an energetic Ritsu, listen to piano concertos with Mugi or reassure Mio that there are no scary ghosts outside of the clubroom after sunset.<br><br>Sucks sucks sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, probably because she's the cutest character by a land slide</br>  Couldn't upload the webm here because the file is too big, so I'll just post the link.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/deryxvqecg.web<wbr>m<br><br>This might be my favorite scene in the entire series. It was the perfect way to open up season 2. Her guitar playing is so full-sounding and satisfying to listen to. I open this file up all the time just to listen to Yui shred for a minute.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> K-On on iPod <br> Tenshi ni Fureta yo comes on <br> Need to quickly switch songs so my eyes don't start watering in public like a retard <br><br>I don't want to delete the song because then my collection will be incomplete. Remembering the keions is suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why do people say Yui is bad? Sounds pretty good to me</br>  <br><br> just like your last girlfriend. <br><br>Ya lost me, and everyone else here too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree anon. When you focus on the Keions so much life becomes suffering. I feel happy watching them and talking about them on /a/, but at the same time the longing to be with them hurts pretty bad. The only thing we can do is be patient and hope that a good virtual reality system is created within our lifetimes.</br>  <br>well, first off you realized what you are doing is wrong and that's the first step.<br>like any addiction, you have too ween yourself off until you are finally over it.<br>I'm sure you can find testosterone blocking pills to help you stop your addiction. <br>good luck, anon. I hope you can find the power inside you to stop doing degenerate acts</br></br></br></br>  <br> Driving slowly down an empty road in the middle of the night. <br> No rush to be anywhere. <br> This song comes on. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rs7<wbr>wSz3GXYs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's sad but so comfy at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Watching shows like that, it makes me want to create something beautiful. Yet it's very difficult.</br></br>  <br>I'm dropping my current shitty major to start studying literature this next semester. I wanna write stories where I can at least live on paper what it'd be like to be with the K-ON's.<br><br>Keion will never ever be real (or any fictional story for that matter) and that's something I yet have to fully come to terms with.<br>But it doesn't mean that I cannot try to get as close to them as I can.</br></br></br></br>  <br>good luck. why don't you start reading or listening to some novels to help inspire you to write a good k-on fanfic?</br>  <br>Perhaps. When my break starts I will get on it, start writing or drawing something at least.<br>I'll probably post all that stuff on some k-on thread soon.</br></br>  <br>People may insult you for it, but if it is what makes you happy then it is a worthy pursuit. The world needs more writers who are interested in K-On! <br><br><br>I think that watching K-On! actually made me a better person, as lame as that sounds. I think I began acting slightly nicer and more relaxed towards other people after I completed the series and fell in love with it. Both in-person and online. <br><br>I don't know how to create something beautiful, but shows like this make me want to improve myself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that I'm not doing anything now to get a step closer to the people I long for who just happen to be anime characters is millions of times more painful than any insult I could possibly receive.<br><br>I don't care about what pople say about me.

Being mecha does not preclude it from being slice of life.</br>  <br>I can't listen to the music anymore, it's too much of an emotional roller coaster</br>  <br>You could say the same to argue that literally any anime is a SoL</br>  <br>Have you seen Patlabor, out of interest? Legitimate question.</br>  <br>No but I watched some clips out of interest and looked it up and nowhere can I see any evidence that it's a SoL.<br>Just because an anime contains SoL elements (as pretty much every anime ever to exist does) doesn't make it a SoL</br></br>  <br> No but I watched some clips out of interest and looked it up and nowhere can I see any evidence that it's a SoL. <br>So in other words, you have no idea.</br></br>  <br>So Evangelion is a SoL</br>  sup /keion/<br><br>not even dreaming of a happy life with ritsu let me fall asleep tonight<br><br>what do i do with myself at such an hour</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're just proving how little you know about Patlabor. Congratulations, you found a couple of clips of the action scenes, probably mainly from the movies, on youtube. You remind me of the guy who found the intro of the first movie, watched it and then bitched for an entire thread that it wasn't all military labor operations.</br>  <br>Actually I found some full episodes on Youtube and skipped around a bit.<br><br> Wikipedia <br>Genre: Police procedural, Comedy-drama, Mecha, Post-cyberpunk<br><br> MAL <br>Genres: Comedy, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Police<br><br> IMDb <br>Genres: Short | Action | Animation | Comedy | Sci-Fi | Drama<br><br>There's no doubt that it has SoL elements but it is clearly not predominantly a SoL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, let me put it this way. By your standards, K-On isn't slice of life. It's a show about music.</br>  <br>I think this is the dumbest argument I've ever had on /a/. Next you're going to tell me that Planetes doesn't count as slice of life.</br>  <br>But K-ON is first and foremost a SoL, and a music anime second.<br>Just like Hibike is a music-focused drama</br></br>  <br>You are starting to see my point. Patlabor is a frankly ludicrous amount of things depending on the episode, but at its core is a strong slice of life element.</br>  I came here to say Azusa is best.  <br>thx</br>  <br>Every anime has SoL/drama elements at its core though, there has to be something going on in between the action<br><br><br>Excellent post</br></br></br></br>  best  <br>You seem to be under the impression that the action is the focus of the franchise, it is not. You would know this if you hadn't built your view of it from a couple of tags on sites and a randomly selected episode you lept around.</br>  <br>3 episodes actually, seems much closer to something like Hibike than K-ON</br>  <br>Which ones out of interest? Like I said, the show is a lot of different things depending on which episode you're on.</br>  <br>You need to shoot yourself in the balls and stop posting this in every thread because it's wrong. <br><br>"Slice of life for mech police" contradicts the very nature of slice of life. Conceptually it cannot be one.</br></br></br>  <br>where can i download a ritsu</br>  <br>  posting this in every thread <br>First time I've mentioned it.<br> "Slice of life for mech police" contradicts the very nature of slice of life. Conceptually it cannot be one. <br>"Slice of life" is very broad. It has meaning beyond 'cute schoolgirls doing cute things'. I'm not objecting to cute schoolgirls doing cute things, mind you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2, 10, 20</br>  <br>Funny, you managed to stumble upon two of the three main dramatic arcs in the show as well as an introductory one.</br>  <br>Filler doesn't make an anime a SoL<br>Naruto, an anime that is 90% filler, is obviously not a SoL</br></br>  <br> Filler <br>Alright, it's clear that you still don't quite get it.</br></br>  <br>Sure, but Mobile Police Patlabor is not a slice of life anime</br>  <br>Says the person who hasn't seen it.</br>  <br>I don't need to watch the whole thing to come to that conclusion</br>  <br>In this case, it would appear you do.</br>  <br>I disagree</br>  <br>You are free to, but that does not change the fact that the show can be classified as slice of life. It is not the only thing it is, but that does not mean it isn't.</br>  <br>Why is it not classified as a SoL anywhere then</br>  <br>That is a very good question. If I had to guess, because pretty much all current English-language sites on the topic are very poorly maintained due to being more recent than the series' popularity in the west.</br>    <br>I don't think three separate unaffiliated websites would make that "mistake", it seems to have a pretty large fanbase and I don't see anybody other than you complaining</br>  <br> pretty large fanbase <br>15 years ago, maybe.<br>Anyway, has it occurred to you how strange your argument looks?</br></br></br>  <br>Has it occurred to you what a mundane topic you have been arguing about for 80 minutes</br>  <br>Welcome to 4chan.<br>You're no better in that regard.</br></br>  <br>You started it</br>    Ritsu is and always be best girl.<br><br>I've always thought it would be cool to be the only dude in HTT, just because it would change the dynamic of the club/band so much.</br></br>  <br> I've always thought it would be cool to be the only dude in HTT <br>Ask Ritsu</br></br>  <br> Hair down Azusa <br>I approve of this image</br></br>  <br>I think the dynamic would only change if you ended up going out with a keion.<br><br>They'd pretty much treat you the same otherwise, although you might get kicked out of the room when Sawako is bullying Mio.</br></br></br>  <br> You will never protect Mio and Azusa from Sawako's abuse <br>why live</br></br>  <br>I will make use of Sawako's wardrobe by filming the K-ON OP/ED music videos.</br>    <br>God I love the Listen! outfits.<br><br>Also Sailor Moog.</br></br></br>    <br>Listen!! is objectively the best ED<br>Listen!! &gt; Singing! &gt; Don't Say Lazy &gt; No, Thank You!</br></br>  <br>someone hasn't heard shiny gems https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iVq<wbr>P1NM-MUQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>That's not an ED</br>  <br>i misread, sorry</br>  <br>Daijoubu<br>Although Jajauma Way To Go is the far superior image song<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q9k<wbr>JnCsGmTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128342704 <br>ok i'm sorry anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128342637 <br>You can't keep running away forever anon.</br>  <br>STOP<br>IT<br>NOW</br></br></br>  YAMETE KUDASAI  <br>They would want you to move on anon.</br>  <br>There is no moving on, the series has ended and they live on only in our hearts</br>     Why are we still here?

Like the old days  <br><br>strongest dude in the entire series actually.

I know they are low budget but using computers they should at least get the coloring and lines right</br>  <br>He's fighting Goku in episode 5.</br>  <br> being this autistic to not get the joke. </br>  <br> Akagi vs Washizu </br>  <br>this is the reason why everyone think that anime fans are autistic</br>  would Whis win against Superman?  <br>I wish we could get Akagi S2 to see another 24 more episodes of Washizu mahjong.<br><br>Not even joking.</br></br></br>  I haven't been following the news for this. Are they just going to use the movie as episodes or will we get new material for the fight?  <br>They changed a lot of the events. Expect new material. This is a re-imagining of the movies, not a straight retelling.</br>  <br>Not with screwattack writing it. Also the only way for this idiocy to stop is if DC and WSJ have a crossover. But knowing DC going all "we're not juvenile storytellers like Marvel", it has zero chance of happening</br>  <br>That, or give Goku the ability to create Mini Red Suns.</br>  <br>what's up with that video anyway? DC writers are so fucking bullshit.</br>  <br>'Murrica. Also, they said Nu52 superman, not MoS Superman. The irritating part about it is that they introduce the SuperFlare and never do anything about it. I honestly thought that the mention of it could change the match's outcome.<br><br>I honestly want Goku to gain an ability that enables him to get an aura that radiates like a red sun to shit up everything</br></br></br>  <br>SSJG radiates reddish light.<br><br><br>Considering the crossovers that happen in comics I think it's WSJ that would be the bigger hurdle. Western comics are like brands, you can do whatever the hell you want with them. Crossovers are nothing to western comicbook authors/artists/editors/fans.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe Frieza won't suck so bad this time around. That movie was terrible.</br></br>  <br> casual time travel at will <br> casual super ftl speed that cross galaxies in minutes </br></br>  <br> He's green lantern tier <br>Death Battle Supes was unusually strong in the rematch. He needed a sun bath to barely beat SSJ4 Goku last time yet this time he didn't even engage 2nd gear. Why would he wish Goku back to life just to kill him again? Why did he drop him just to catch him?</br></br>  <br>Considering that this is nu52 Supes, he isn't exactly as strong as his golden/silver age versions.<br><br>But seriously only DCAU supes would lose to Goku. And DCAU supes is like the most handicapped to begin with.<br><br>Though It would kill screwattack if Goku gets an Aura that's equivalent to a Red Sun.</br></br></br></br></br>  would you a whis?    who else loves that the pilaf gang is going to be in the next episode? i've missed shu and mai  <br>I think the Mai x Trunks thing is kinda messed up.</br>  <br>Mai x Trunks?</br>  <br><br>is he gay</br></br>  <br>They sort of got together in BoG.</br>  <br>Ambiguous effeminate.</br>  <br> According to the series' original author Akira Toriyama, in terms of power, Goku as a Super Saiyan God would be a 6, Beerus would be a 10, and Whis would be a 15. </br>  <br> I actually want someone to make washizu mahjong tiles. I can create the table but making the tiles eludes me. The game actually seems really interesting. </br>  <br>anon pls, shota is nothing new</br>  <br>If Beers is 100%<br>God mode Goku is 60%<br>and Whis is 150%<br><br><br><br>Toriyama is flipping the bird at powerlevels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expecting any kind of effort from Toei <br> in a weekly anime to boot </br></br>  <br>He scrapped the power level stuff as early as the start of the Androids arc.</br>  <br> He scrapped the power level stuff as early as the start of the Androids arc <br>He started taking it very seriously with this arc.</br></br>  These new "as strong as Freeza" leftovers from his army raise a question why didn't he call them over to fight against Goku on Namek, or brought them to earth along with his father. Bringing up Freezer's army is cool, adds realism to the cosmic lore and all, but there's never a good enough reason given as to why couldn't they show up earlier.  <br>http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/<wbr>asobitai/item/10000502/</wbr></br>  <br> You can't ascertain the power we saiyans possess by mere calculation. <br>Pretty sure that's flipping the bird at power levels</br></br>  <br>The Namek Arc took place over a week.By the time Goku showed up to fight, Namek about a day away from being blown up. Freiza and Cold didn't bring any to earth because they wanted revenge personally on Goku's home planet.</br>  <br>Do you even understand what he meant and implied by that?</br>  <br>He's talking about what Dr.Gero said a few minutes before. When Piccolo asks him if he saw the Namek battle with the spy robot, Dr.Gero says he didn't need too, and extrapolated Goku's present power just with calculations.</br>  <br><br>Vegeta's phrase is completely opposed to the power level stuff that was introduced with the scouters during the saiyan arc.<br>Not counting they were never treated like constant numbers that could be trusted.</br></br></br>  <br> Vegeta's phrase is completely opposed to the power level stuff that was introduced with the scouters during the saiyan arc <br>So you totally didn't understand what he said.</br></br>  <br>No, He's like Zarbon.<br>Effeminate but not gay like general blue</br></br>  <br>That was bad wording on my part. What I mean is that power levels were introduced as a meaning to calculate the strenght of a warrior, and its concept was completely diminished by the time of the arrival of the androids.</br>  I don't mind or care about the power level reset but there's one thing that bothers me, the animation is doing a really weak job to convey the vast power level differences. Think about it, the fights look pretty much the same if not less intense than those in Z. Fighters with their strengths in billions punch each other and the reality surrounding them is pretty much unaffected. Remember when in Z Goku fought Vegeta and that alone caused hurricanes, and mass animal migration? That intensity just isn't there anymore, animation lacks the area where it's supposed to convey the strength and power. Billion pwlvl punch should level a city.  <br>You know the real reason they never use Superman's Solar flare attack?<br><br><br>Because Marvel used one of their Superman knock offs and had them perform the very same attack like 2 months earlier than DC.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So vegito or gogeta would have the same power level with the fusion boost?</br></br>  <br>Toriyama likely wants to forget about those.</br>  <br>Goku said even Fusion wouldn't be able to fight Beerus, so either fused form would be below SSG</br>  <br>I was talking about a ssgss vegito/gogeta</br>  fat beerus when  <br><br>SSGSS is weaker than SSG.</br></br>  <br>SSSGSS is above SSG you retard</br>  <br>Untrue. Tori just said he thinks red&gt;blue, which is fucking retarded when you look at the way light works.</br>   SSG Goku - 6 <br> SSGSS Goku - at least 300 <br> SSGSS Goku - 30 Beeruses <br><br>Fuck dragonball</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the story behind this hate everyone says Toriyama has for Vegito? I know the Gogeta story where Toei beat him to it, but I've never read anything about Vegito.</br>  <br> because he hasn't gone super saiyan </br>  <br>SSGSS 3 and 4 when?</br>  <br>so SSGSS is stronger that beerus?</br>  <br>If we were to go purely off power level, sure. But we know Dragon Ball threw that to the wind ages ago, I believe in RoF Whis says if Goku and Vegeta as SSGSS teamed up against Beerus they might win.</br>  <br>that was such a lame line to be honest. They know about chinese cartoon in space? Chinese is an earth term and Beerus haven't visited earth since the dinosaur time</br>  <br>Nah. Whis said it would take Goku and Vegeta fighting together to have a good chance of defeated Beerus.<br><br>It's best not to take the 6, 10, and 15 as actual regular power levels but more like tiers.</br></br></br>  <br>SSGSS 4 Vegito confirmed?</br>  <br>It's a 4th wall breaking joke, it doesn't have to make sense in-story<br> /a/ - Autism </br></br>  <br>*defeating</br>  <br> It's best not to take the 6, 10, and 15 as actual regular power levels but more like tiers <br>It's best to take SSGSS as lower than SSG.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>All the Supreme Kai wear Potara Earrings. The only time they gave up a pair was to give Goku a fighting chance against Buu.<br><br>The fact that the Kai (God beings) wore them along with the power boost implies that the fusion result ascended into the state of God power levels.<br><br>Consider the following: In the non-canon Dragon Ball Z Fusion movie Goku was alive, Vegeta was dead, and so Gogeta was born with a halo on his head. Fusion Dance has other limitations like the time limit.<br><br>On the flip side, one of the participants for Vegito was dead (Vegeta), yet the fusion came out without a halo. Potara Earrings are God items, even capable of withstanding Vegito being turned into candy without his power level dropping.<br><br>Vegito is clearly the better match-up against Beerus if they turn to fusion. Him being canon gives us better odds too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How powerful is Goku compared to Supreme Kai? Stronger or weaker?  <br> [HorribleSubs] Aquarion Logos </br>  <br>That quality on Whis' face is terrible.</br>  <br>It's because of shits like you that Toriyama made it this way.</br>  <br> out of stock <br>dreams exist to be destroyed.</br></br>  <br>Vegito doesn't need to push pass Super Saiyan 3 to beat Beerus. Goku needed to push beyond Super Saiyan 2 to match Fat Buu, the jump from 2 to 3 is pretty high. Vegito has only been seen at Super Saiyan 1, what 2 and 3 look like is unknown.</br>  <br>Vastly stronger. Supreme Kai is weak shit.</br>  <br>I don't have an issue with SSGSS being lower, I have an issue with spreading misinformation like you're doing because you've extrapolated one sentence from an interview.</br>  <br> what 2 and 3 look like is unknown. <br>You know what the look like, their power though?</br></br>  <br>You don't even need to extrapolated, knowing Toriyama it's very likely that regular God mode is a stronger form than blue hawaii.</br>  <br>Yet he created the universe.</br>  <br>Ah, so you don't even have that, you've basically pulled that assumption out of your ass.</br>  <br>I don't know if this was the case with Frieza, but Cell and Piccolo both had different numbers of fingers in the Manga (I want to say three per hand and four per hand respectively) but were drawn with five in the anime for simplicity's sake for the animators. Frieza might have had a different number of fingers as well.</br>  <br>Super will confirm it soon enough and shit will rain.</br>   Don't watch Dragon Shit since I'm not a fucking 13 year old <br> See these threads on /a/ daily now <br> All I can make out is pic related <br><br>Why do you all watch this garbage?</br></br></br></br>  <br>how the fuck is ssg stronger than ssgss. Ssgss is a power up for ssg.</br>  <br>I realized long ago anime is 99% shit anyway, it doesn't matter what you watch,</br>  <br>You got something better to watch that isn't moe shit?</br>  <br><br>Literally any other show this season that isn't moe would probably do.</br></br>  <br>Only if SSGSS turns out to have some kind of weakness, like draining energy and such, but I don't see it happening. SSGSS utilises only the base SS form, which doesn't have this drawback.</br>  <br>So nothing.</br>  <br>He has magical powes that let him create shit. Evidently that doesn't translate to fighting power since he was shitting his royal robes over Dabura, Yakon and fucking Puipui.</br>  <br>It's weakness is that it makes you vunerable to laser weapons.</br>  <br>Good thing I have this super special ability that lets me watch more then one show at a time without hindering my experience with another show. Weird shit, man.</br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with the fact you're still watch absolute gutter trash?<br><br><br><br>Many things, even new DRRR beats this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Many things <br><br>I'm not even that into DB and I call bullshit on this. There are like 2 maybe 3 good anime this season. And Super isn't one of them.</br></br></br>  <br>indeed<br>i miss all that filler</br></br>  <br> absolute gutter trash <br><br><br>Yes, I watch anime. Your point?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like having fun.</br>  <br><br> DRRR <br> Charlotte <br> Rokka Yuusha <br> GATE <br> Semen Eaters <br><br>5 right there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DRRR is moeshit galore.</br>  <br> DRRR  <br> Semen Eaters <br> Rokka Yusha <br><br>Mate, I'm not arguing Super isn't shit, but if you want to convince me there are other good anime airing you actually have to list good anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implications <br><br>It has a slight amount.</br></br></br></br>  <br> People still like DRRR <br><br>Wow, it's like I'm really on Otakumemes.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Everything airing is shit <br><br>Why do you even watch anime son</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only see 2 or 3 good anime on that list though.</br>  <br>both goku and vegeta were dead in the movie</br>  <br> watching anime <br> not reading manga exclusively </br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think most anime is shit these days. That doesn't stop me from enjoying it or liking it, but over the last few years I've gone from thinking "That's good!" to "Well, that's pretty good for an anime."</br>  <br> I'm not a fucking 13 year old <br>90% of anime is targeted to 13-year-olds, so you're most likely watching one of them at the moment.</br></br>  <br>Nostalgia<br><br>I was 11 when I started watching Dragonball and thats 17 years ago, so Son Goku and his friends will always have a special place in my heart, if you like it or not kiddo.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a second, this guy is the "fastest in the universe" and it takes him 26 minutes and 44 seconds to get from Beerus' planet to Earth.<br><br>Meanwhile, Goku can use instant transmission to instantly (INSTANTLY) teleport to any location in the entire universe including places outside of the mortal realm like Kai's planet.<br><br>This guy is as much the "fastest of the universe" as Burter was. For fucks sake, would it be so hard for this supposedly super powerful guy to learn Instant Transmission, a technique that presumably all Yardrats know? Hell, what about Beerus himself? He wouldn't even need Whis then.<br><br>tl;dr: Whis a shit. A shiiiiiiiiiiit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he create them all as well if he created the universe? How could he be weaker than them if he was responsible for their creation? Actually, I'm completely off about this lore and where's the place of supreme kais in all of this.</br>  <br>maybe he's not using instant transmission because he's not in any actual hurry to get where he's going.<br><br>sometimes you just gotta slow down and enjoy the journey, you know?</br></br></br>  <br> dragonball <br> logic <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>What's the distance from Beerus' planet to Earth?</br>  <br><br>If your animu has a clock overlay on it since it's a breakfast broadcast, it's for kids.</br></br>  <br> Anime is for kids <br><br>MORE AT 11</br></br></br>  <br>Given how how impatient Beerus is, that's rather unlikely. If Whis could use instant transmission, Beerus would order Whis to do it. Or do it himself.<br><br><br>It can't be further away than the Supreme Kai's planet, which Goku instantly transmitted to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SSGSS is the result of a Saiyan going SSG.<br>SSGSS uses some of the leftover power from receaching that state for a permanent change to their Supersiayan form, but that doesn't mean its a direct upgrade. It'd be dumb for SSGSS to be stronger than SSG anyways since SSG is harder to achieve.</br></br>  <br>I'd consider much of the anime airing late in the afternoon or around midnight as teen stuff as well.</br>  Where is my Rebuild of Rahxephon?  <br>It's called Pluralitas Concentio and it sucked dick</br>  <br>There's not need for some reboot when the original is shit.</br>  <br>it's the best 8/10 anime I've ever seen.</br>  <br>I rate it 5/10 (average)</br>  Don't need to Rebuild what's already perfect.  <br>Garbage gets rebooted all the time<br><br>That said, RahXephon is quite great.</br></br></br>  Need to wait for the Eva rebuilds to finish so it can be better than them, the same way the original was a better Eva than Eva.  <br>I still don't understand why retards think this is an EVA ripofff even 12 years after it aired. At most it was inspired by it. But Rahxephon is the superior anime.</br>  <br> bones nowadays <br>You and me both know it would end up being dogshit.</br></br>  Rahxephon is so good that it doesn't need a reboot.  I feel for all the tomboys in the world who were born with huge tits and have to carry unnecessary additional weight when doing sports and feel embarassed when someone compliments them on their huge funbags  I'll always stand behind them to support that weight.  <br><br>No oppai!</br></br>  <br>why not? they are good at all sizes</br>  <br>I think that there is nothing more beautiful than a tomboy with generous mammary glands.</br>  <br>On 7th grade in PE class a friend said "even if you fell you'd have nice airbags" and I felt extremely ashamed, he then felt bad and I felt bad.

It must be destroyed.</br>  <br>because /m/ brings out peoples' FIGHTING SPIRIT which tends to be more masculine<br> Shit, now I need to rewatch Robotics;Note just for robot Poplar </br></br>  <br>Ai isn't much of a tomboy but she is a best, apart from her taste in men. She's way too good for Hachimaki.</br>  <br>She's not a tomboy next to Fee. She is when compared to just about any other female character. It's a scale, not a tickbox.<br> She's way too good for Hachimaki. <br>The manga kind of touches on that. It's cute.<br>Much better choice than Ching Chong, anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not liking embarrassed tomboys </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333437 <br>sad world we live in where a post about wanting to befriend other people gets deleted</br>  <br>where is this from? search gives nothing</br>  <br>It's a wonderful thing, but most tomboys go skin deep. More of them need to be comfortable in their skin, less who secretly wish to be girly and turn to mush the moment you express anything towards them.</br>  <br>I just wish there was some way for Kagefusa to get her boobs back and be happy, it just feels like the writer is taunting me.</br>  <br>But anon. You are supposed to be the one to make them feel comfortable with their body.<br><br>By wispering in their ear how beautiful they are</br></br></br>  <br>Because pedoshits are immature subhumans.</br>  I don't get dfc fags. Is it not enough to like just flat chests? <br><br>Why do they have to hate big breasts so much?<br><br>Even flat girls don't get that angry about big boobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the tits in this thread are just freakish, though<br>That's unappealing no matter how you slice it</br></br>  <br>What if I find them appealing?</br>  <br>then you're fucking weird<br>I prefer women to look like humans instead giant parade balloons shaped like tits</br></br>  <br>No reason to get all bent out of shape over it. Besides, its not the worst fetish in the world you know. They could be postig /d/ shit like egg laying or something gross like that</br>  <br><br>It's not a female if she has no tits. If you like flat chest and tomboys, then it means that you are gay.</br></br>  <br>Why not one that can make you embarrassed? Strong personalities a best.</br>  <br>In all honesty I love both. Being a mix means you get to enjoy both sub and dom girls.</br>  <br>That's the spirit. A lot of people just seem to like tomboys because of the heightened contrast when they get submissive. I'm all about the bubbly bro-tier girls that you couldn't keep down if you tried.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> dat manface <br>Tell me it's not a girl jumping.</br></br>  <br>Have you never watched Patlabor?</br>  <br> Calling that mecha cutie a manface.  <br>You just don't know how endearing Noa is.</br></br>  <br>Shit now im feeling lonely again. <br><br>  you will never had a girlbro to drink beer watch anime with. <br><br>I dont even like beer but I still would like someone to hang with.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did, a little. Ages ago.<br><br><br>Her face is literally the face of a boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Time to rewatch the whole thing.<br><br>TV series + OVA2 for comfy<br>OVA1 + Movie 1 + Movie 2 for talking heads and delicious animation</br></br></br></br>  What kind of Tomboy is Forte?  <br>But I like both.</br>  <br>Clearly you didn't watch enough if you don't know fucking Noa Izumi or the SV2 uniform when you see them.</br>  <br>Nah, i kinda don't have motivation to do so.<br><br><br>Yeah, that's why I said "a little", genius.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't want to see one of anime's best tomboys and greatest female leads doing her thing?</br>  <br>The one who gets fucked by a futa Ranpha.</br>  http://streamable.com/hf99  <br>A girly tomboy and a manly tomboy.<br>How can they work so well?</br></br>  <br>And then Ranpha will impregnate Forte and they'll have little tomboy babies.</br>  <br>Not a the time. Kinda no interest in mecha right now.</br>  What's the big appeal of tomboys? I don't get the hype tbh.  <br> absurd useless flesh <br> useless <br>Are you retarded? Why do you think it's common that people prefer larger rather than smaller boobs? Do you even know what boobs do?</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing the show isn't really mecha. Not in the traditional sense, at least.</br>  <br>You can fuck them and its not gay</br>  <br>Imagine you have a best friend. You do most everything together with this friend. You go out drinking, you go to the gym, you play contact sports, you get in fights but always forgive each other the next day<br>Now imagine you can have sex with that friend<br><br>Furthermore, a tomboy is still a woman, so she is still feminine on a fundamental level, but it is suppressed femininity. That means that usually it's not at the forefront of your mind when you're with her. However, there are brief moments when you become extraordinarily aware that she is a sexually attractive woman. In these moments, her feminine side is more pronounced than normal women's, and is thus more attractive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. Its the hidden gem part that gets you really.</br>  I don't think I can force another one out brehs  <br> Second paragraph <br>Webm related.<br>  I think it's the right one. No easy way to check on mobile. </br></br></br>  <br>Girls without all the bullshit that is girls tbh</br>              <br> he wasn't there when a mother of two posted on /a/ </br>            <br>managed it</br>  <br>  you will never make a big breasted tomboy fem/a/non a mother of two </br>  <br>She's doing that on purpose, right?</br>  <br> ass so fat you could see it from the front </br>    <br>yes</br>    <br>You will never have a tomboy partner and extraordinary close friend ('just friends') to confide a highly personal source of immense emotional distress in that also provides context for some of your less than stellar behaviour.<br>Feels bad man.</br></br>    <br>I don't think wearing a bra makes breasts sag more. It would logically help to prevent stretching out breast tissue.</br>  <br><br> You will never have a friend trustworthy enough to talk about your feelings wit <br><br>Keeping my emotions completely bottled up for 15 years is not healthy. I think im becoming completely apathetic.</br></br></br></br>    <br>You definitely need a tomboy childhood friend.</br>  <br>Wearing a bra does not in any way prevent or reduce sag, nor does it shape in any way. Bras provide support, not sculpting. Some studies suggest that wearing a bra all the time can worsen sag since certain ligaments atrophy, but they aren't thorough enough to be concrete evidence.</br>  <br>Everybody does.<br><br>Some of us never got the chance to have one, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Never had one. Even the one friend I have now I could never talk to him about that kind of stuff.<br><br>Ive never really been able to talk about my feelings with anyone since my whole family is shit too<br><br>How long till I break completely /a/?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about the tomboys that had no childhood friends, only finding a place for themselves hundreds of kilometres from home and at age 20?</br>  <br>If only life found a way like that.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about 3D. 3D tomboys are just dykes or ugly male looking atrocities.</br>  <br>But anon, I am 3D.</br>  <br>No, you're not. You're a cute little girl while you here, remember.</br>  <br>Who knows, you might one day run into a tomboy that you befriend, one thing leads to another and you end up so dependant on one another that it isn't inaccurate to say that you need each other, well before either of you start being direct about you feelings of course.</br>  Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that this guy took the time during a chaotic operation with lives at stake to edit the Wikipedia article of K2 to maintain factual accuracy.  <br>What was his name again? I hope he survives until retirement.</br>  <br>Is that HS? I guess I'd rather keep watching memesubs.</br>  <br>As expected of a highly-trained operative of S.O.N.G.<br><br>That's not H&amp;D, nor is it Commeme. I don't know who it is.</br></br></br>  <br> second highest <br> factual </br></br>  <br>I meant third highest.</br>  <br><br>It's HS, yes.</br></br>  This shit feels like I am watching Nanoha befriending all the little misunderstood bitches all around while fate is always being jealous of them. Because they get Nanoha attention.  <br>Wait, shit, I thought nobody was simulcasting it. Where is he getting 1080p geahs?</br>  <br>Crunchyroll is simulcasting it starting friday, and the first two episodes are already out.</br>  So the SUBS WHEN craze is officially deprecated starting friday?<br>I feel like we're losing an important part of the Symphohype.</br>  <br><br>I think I like the commie line more. What did H and D translate it to?</br></br>  <br> The peak elevation of the mountain has dropped to the 3rd highest in the world! </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Commie translated it as "K2 is now the third highest mountain in the world".</br>  <br><br>If so, HS is better.</br></br>  <br>Crunchy might be more amusing but there's no way in hell it's more accurate.</br>  <br>Crunchy's subs are even worse than Commie at some points. Plus they only sub some songs.<br>They only have the best video rips and starting next week Commie and H&amp;D are going to use them too, so there's no reason to keep HS except for speed.</br></br>  Reminder that Carol is a legitimate threat and deserves to be feared. Fail to do so, and you'll find some Autoscorers sucking you dry.  <br> Getting sucked dry by an Autoscorer <br>Not a bad way to go</br></br>  Did Hibiki suffered enough to be able to deal with her insane personality? I feel all she needs is time, maybe some talk with enemies. I'd like to see her getting kidnapped, would be better than another "Miku is in danger so Hibiki finds temporary solution for her problems".  <br>Reminder that I masturbate daily to Carol's legs.</br>    <br> Carol <br> Legitimate threat <br><br>She is going to break before Episode 10. Just in time to join the fight against the real threat.</br></br></br></br>  Some drawfag should make a Symphogear version of this:<br><br> DO NOT FIST AUTOSCORER GIRLS </br></br>  <br>Who wants a big hug? That's right, Carol does!</br>  <br>I thought she's going to die in Ep 7.</br>  <br>That's Genjuuro.</br>  <br>That would be Maria. She is going to "die".</br>  Remove miracles.  <br> Autoscorers sucking you dry. <br>Aww yeah that...wait, no, shark teeth. NO.</br></br>  <br>Please don't kill Hibiki. She's just a little insane, she doesn't deserve to be removed.</br>  <br> the page is protected <br>Anyone with a wiki account here? Some facts must be corrected.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is a very disturbed child. She needs to be put down.</br>  <br>Both bridge bunnys will die in fact they will all die when Red gets on that sub.</br>  <br>CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGES SYMPHOGEARS</br>   people will now watch HS instead of waiting for based commie   Just watched both episode HS put out and their wage slave translators make Commie look like native speakers. Seriously how are you paying someone and they fuck up that bad on top of the vomit educing type setting.  <br>They wont. The villains have to be redeemable and them killing people for real would make them immune to befriending.</br>  <br>I just wait for accurate subs every week so this changes nothing for me. <br><br><br>The doll with razor blade hands will not be befriended.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you care about other people? They can watch what they want, I'll wait for Commie for sure.</br>  <br>Elfnein is going to die. Really, they won’t kill off anyone else, and there aren’t a lot of things Kaneko would put in that would make nips uncomfortable. <br><br>There’s a brutally on screen dismembered loli.</br></br></br>  H&amp;D WHEN?  <br>The Autoscorers already killed a shitton of people. Besides, they're just killer machines. Doll joint terminators.<br><br>To be perfectly honest, redeeming Carol would also be fucking retarded after her Autoscorers killed so many people already.<br><br>  "You caused alot of people to die, but hey, I like your hat, let's be friend!" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria killed tons of people and was still befriended.</br>  <br>She was protecting civilians.</br>  <br>Chris killed loads of people with Solomon's cane though.<br>That why she turned all angsty near the end of G.</br></br>  <br>Yup</br>    I want to see Hibiki beat and tear one of the dolls to death extremely brutally.<br><br>It would probably be the red one, after it stabs Miku.</br></br>  <br> the way this post was written <br>this is why HS subs was a bad idea.</br></br>  <br>We didn't see her killing anybody on screen, though.<br><br>Carol orders her dolls to fuck some people up.<br><br><br>I would love that.<br><br>Especially with Carol crying like a scared little girl while watching.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Discussion of episode though</br></br>  Befriending/befisting regardless of the casualties is par for the course with Symphogear. Chris being the best example by a landslide, followed by Miku,  I'LL JUST SING GUNGNIR AWAY FROM YOU  Maria, and DMJii befriending each other. Big bads were taken down in both seasons, however. <br><br>I want to see if Carol will keep her big bad status until the end of the season.</br></br>  <br> The Autoscorers already killed a shitton of people. <br>We don't actually know they're dead.<br>I mean, yeah, they're PROBABLY all dead, but it hasn't been confirmed.<br><br>Maria only killed soldiers that were firing on civilians.<br><br>Chris only ever used the Cane against Geahs. In fact she deliberately lead them to unpopulated areas, against Fine's orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to see if Carol will keep her big bad status until the end of the season. <br>Nah, whoever created Carol will show up to fuck things up</br></br>  <br>You mean shitosting about subs.</br>  <br>We do not know if kissing kills.</br>  <br>I think there'll still be planty room for discussion when Commie release their version. They're faster than with G after all.</br>  <br> Carol being a homunculus specifically created to create other homunculuses <br><br>Oh boy. I can't wait.  Wait, does that mean Carol is genderless? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm fairly certain a bullet to the head does though</br>  <br>Why would I want to discuss the episode with people that don't understand what the characters are even saying? "I can't remember the words".</br>  <br>If she doesn't it's going to make Hibiki's arc another wet fart where no one learns anything just like last season. Her entire moral dilemma completely loses its teeth if Carol isn't absolutely serious.</br>  <br>What if Elfnein created Carol, and she's just fucking with us?</br>  <br>You do know they both look the same right?<br><br>They're both genderless, correct</br></br></br>  <br>It was in autodefense, and the guy looked like a faggot anyway.</br>  Plot twist: Carol is not destroying the world literally.  <br>I would like that a lot. She probably sets up the Gears to destroy the world themself.</br>  Does Carol have an age? A physical one, I mean.  <br>Unknown. Probably a few hundred years old since her dad got burned at a stake and that doesn't happen too much nowadays.</br>  <br>Europe is called the 'dark continent' or something now, so you never know.</br>  <br>Well, we don't know how the other countries are. We did see London, but we don't know what happened to the Euro zone following what happened to Greece.</br>  <br>How can I fear something this cute?</br>  <br>I want to bully her.</br>  <br>I want to rub her hair as she gives orders to her dolls while she tries to maintain a straight face</br>  <br>Everybody wants to bully her. Take a ticket.<br>Or we can all go together simultaneously, and hope at least one of us is still alive by the time we reach her hat to take it off.</br></br>  Biki is a baka!  <br>I wonder how many anon will flip their shit if they decide to kill off Carol for real.</br>  I want to  undo Carol's braid .  this is why symphogear is AOTY  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  After listening to Exterminate a few more times now, I've really started to like it. Definitely more than Vitalization and it's pretty tough competition to Synchrogazer.  <br>Im starting to like Exterminate as well. I believe that much like Vitalization, its an acquired taste. It takes a lot of listening to appreciate the intricasy of the song. <br><br><br>Right now for me its<br>Vitalization&gt;Synchrograzer&gt;=Extermi<wbr>nate<br>but by the end of the season it will probably be more like<br>Vitalization=Exterminate&gt;=Synchroga<wbr>zer</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did they give Kirika a hotblooded metal song while Chris was given a meh song?  <br>FIS girls &gt; original girls. Satelight agrees, don't bother them about it.</br>  <br>I don't even mind it. TRUST HEART is amazing and one of the 2 best songs of GX even though it's not entirely the same style as Chris's previous songs.</br>    Hello, fellow Mikafags.<br><br>Have a nice day.</br></br>  <br>Chris always tried mitigating civilian casualties and thought she was helping people, hence her conflict. Hibiki is trying to befriend an insane loli with killer dolls.</br>  Why only the memories of dudes?<br><br>Where's the dead women?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki probably thinks otherwise considering she saw Carol cry. Not really much of a defense, but that's what Hibiki is like.</br>  <br>That's gay</br>  I want to invade Carol's privacy.  <br> FIS girls &gt; original girls. <br>Only in terms of being sexy.</br></br>    <br>Very good, thank you</br>  <br> that's what Hibiki is like <br>A blubbering retard? Yeah, we've caught on.</br></br>  If you held a gun to Miku's head would Hibiki let you shoot her? You're human after all.    <br>Why would you do that</br>  <br>She'd be paralyzed with fear, but if you actually killed miku she'd probably snap, and go berserker mode even if it meant she had to impale gungnir into herself.</br>  <br>Miku is the only thing Hibiki will protect even if it requires punching humans or throwing away her own life.</br>  <br>That's an unfair situation given that any sort of threatening action would just result in you shooting Miku, so if anything Hibiki's only option would be to do what she usually does.</br>  I want Elfnein to kill Carol and become the final boss.  <br>What if I told her that she has to kill me if she doesn't want her to die? Either way she'll be breaking her one rule.</br>  <br>Miku can throw weighted objects over 1000 feet.<br>If you're just holding a gun to her head I'm sure she could move fast enough to avoid you shooting and beat out your reaction time of her moving.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry Miku it's just that your waifu's ideals are so ludicrous I can't help but want to see them break. It's not you, it's her. You understand.</br>  <br> yfw elfnein is the real carol and the carol we've seen is just a decoy </br>  <br>Male privilege.</br>  DESS DESS DESS  <br>Carol.<br>Please.<br>Into the dungeon. Take your hat.</br></br></br>  <br>She was ready to remove Ver because he was exception to her "we can understand each other" delusion. If you cross the line, she will kill you.</br>  <br>Carol is right though. She's an idiot and has ideals that would never work.</br>  <br>Exterminate is definitely my favorite of the OPs. I really like both Vitalization and Synchrograzer, don't get me wrong, but Exterminate is the only one I can just sit down and listen to on repeat.</br>  <br>Ver wasn't a cute girl like me.</br>  Is Hibiki going to go Unlimited Gungnir's Work?  Years later and I still can't get over how stupid Shirabes Geah is.<br><br>I'm glad they decided to not add any new Geah users because they clearly ran out of ideas.</br></br>  <br>When did she attempt to kill Ver though? She even stopped Maria from killing him.</br>  <br>I think you're gay and stupid but I don't go around telling everyone how gay and stupid you are faggot.</br>  <br>I still love it.</br>  <br>Kind of true, Hibiki attempted to beat the shit out of Miku when she got mind controlled, afterall.</br>  <br> hating on Shul Shagana <br>Shirabe isn't even close to my favorite gear user but Senki Zesshou Twintails was inevitable regardless, and the Heelies are adorable. That and seriously, flying around with buzzsaws looking like some sort of hourglass of death? Shul Shagana is great.</br></br>  <br> Dainsleif will be a gear, since it isn't a complete relic <br>I kind of hope Garie just flat out steals gungnir instead.</br></br>  <br>It's just because Agematsu is a twintail faggot.</br>  <br>Unlimited Dáinsleif Work maybe.</br>  <br>But they might also put a little bit of Dainsleif into everyone's gear to repair and upgrade them.<br>Their pendants are different in the official art and opening.</br></br>  <br>That scene after "My life... is symphogear!". DMJii had to stop her.</br>  <br> everybody gets a little bit of the magical bloodlust murdersword embedded in their geah <br><br>I don't see this backfiring in any way at all</br></br></br>  Sunday thread  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320981 <br>I like tsurime eyes like Shiranui, Akebono and Kaga.</br>  It feels like you're deliberately making shit threads in an effort to get Kancolle banned from /a/.  <br>Why did you make a thread when there's no reason? Why didn't you just wait for the 4koma guy to make one when he was done?</br>  Its not like 'shit threads' for any other anime get banned.

Poi   <br> playing for stats </br>  <br> Maupons <br> s </br></br>  <br>No, we will see S2 being cancelled because S1 was so crap that if they made an S2 no one will buy it even if they gave event tickets for every BD volume.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>    <br>S1 was a resounding commercial success<br> S2 cancelled <br>Nice fond wishing though</br></br></br>  <br>Are you being negative because you don't want them to be lovers or something?</br>  <br>Nah, the reason this thread doesn't get deleted is because mods are sleeping</br>  <br> resounding commercial success <br>Not according to Kadokawa</br></br>  <br>Sure, I'll watch S1 being a commercial success and S2 having 3 digit sales tops because people are so disgusted by Kadokawa that they'd rather drop this franchise and go to something else.<br><br><br>I can't care less about them. However, the cancerous anime is a different matter altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to industry standards, no one cares what Kadokawa believed to be the numbers to be a "line" passing success.</br>  <br>The anime isn't influencing the players to leave the fandom regardless of how bad potentially it could be.</br>  <br> no one cares what Kadokawa believed <br>They're the ones in charge of deciding if there's a season 2 or not.</br></br>  Someone needs to post more of the yuri loli Zuikaku series.  <br>If the the in-game lines keep being changed because of the anime, even they will get fed up.</br>  <br>The lines that got changed were before the anime came out.</br>  <br>And no one is dumb enough to throw away what sales it made even if S1 didn't live up to Kadokawa's stupid expectation.</br>  <br>That's because they got changed in preparation for it. Fubuki is now Akagi's little lesbian slut.</br>  <br>None of Fubuki's lines got changed. And no, Kai Ni secretary lines being updated don't count because that's normal for every Kai Ni.</br>  <br>You really have no idea how business work, right?</br>  <br>If it's at the cost of sales in other areas, they will.</br>  http://pururin.com/gallery/18396/fu<wbr>rutaka-to-sugosu-yoru.html<br>Nice doujin</br></wbr>  <br> that's normal for every Kai Ni <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Maybe he meant every recent Kai 2.</br>    <br>I don't think you do.</br>  <br>Aoba is Furutaka's only lover though.</br>  <br>So, the guys who are behind the funding and budget of the anime think that the sales were not as good as they expected? That totally confirms how much they'll love a second season right?</br>  <br> I have no proof that any decision regarding S2 has been made or reached yet by Kadokawa <br> But I'll just assume out of the blue its not going to happen <br>That's you.</br></br></br>    <br>Is it OK to rape Takanami?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>No.</br>  Daijoubu!!!  <br>They stated on their twitter that sales were disappointing.<br>Most people hated the overall quality of the product<br>Even people who have worked on the game have stated negative opinions about the anime<br>It ain't that hard to see why Kadokawa wouldn't want a second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>DIEjoubu</br>  <br>I don't know.</br>  <br>Kamo</br>  <br>Daijoubu.</br>  <br>Fantastic. Now I have that song stuck in my head.</br>  <br>Daijoubu!<br><br><br>Daijoubu desu!</br></br></br></br>  <br> They stated on their twitter that sales were disappointing. <br>No they didn't.</br></br>  GUYS YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT REALLY IS?<br><br>Its  NENOHI DAY! </br></br>  <br>Look again, they openly said that sales weren't up to their expectations</br>  <br>Who's the semen demon?</br>  <br>You ruined it.</br>  <br>Post the tweet.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it was on yaraon that the info got out and yaraon didn't get it from kancolle or kadokawa's twitter account.</br>    <br>https://twitter.com/michsuzu/status<wbr>/613158344983838720<br>Sales were impressive, but didn't live up to expectations.<br>https://twitter.com/michsuzu/status<wbr>/613157974501015554<br>They especially noticed the negative reaction after the final episode, and want to take into consideration what the fans actually want when making the second season.</br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I'm willing to wager that if Kadokawa makes an S2 and does the same stupid shit or worse, their servers will get DDOS'd like that piratecolle game did. The question is whether Kadokawa is willing to take that risk.</br>  <br>Today is Monday.</br>  <br>You could say that sales were disapPOInting.<br><br>Lurk more.</br></br></br>  <br>So they are making S2.</br>  <br>So they have decided to kill off the franchise once and for all. 2hufags will be most pleased.</br>  <br>Why do you hate the anime so much?</br>  <br>Today is still Sunday.</br>  <br>Stop being retarded, it says right there they want to consider what fans want to not fuck up again.</br>  <br> implying they will listen <br>How naïve.</br></br>  <br>So SOL of antics, some WW2 references, and large amounts of fan service?</br>  http://dec.2chan.net/60/res/5554394<wbr>.htm</wbr>  The problem isn't with sales, the problem is that now most people are disappointed with how bad the anime was. If they make a second season with the same quality sales might be lesser thanks to the poor reception.<br><br>It's not even confirmed that there's going to be a season 2, just that they will make some kind of sequel. It can be a movie or an ova, not exactly a new season.</br></br>  <br> If they make a second season with the same quality sales might be lesser thanks to the poor reception. <br>Just add special shit for the PS Vita. They couldn't do that before for the browser game but since Kai is coming out next month they can now.</br></br>  <br>Because it was utter crap. In addition, what Kadokawa did relating to the anime showed that it does not care about the fans. One lucky runaway success and they have grown lax.</br>  <br> One <br>Nigga Kadokawa has had many runaway successes throughout the decades.</br></br>  <br>I do not deny that, but they have grown especially lax towards this one.</br>  <br>Sunday, faggot.<br><br><br>Will the Vita game have micro-transactions too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They figured it was too big to fail. And in a way they were right.</br>   Wanting a second season <br>Disgusting</br>  <br><br>Not him but it's Monday here.</br></br>  <br>Its not Monday in murrica' so it doesn't matter if it matter if its Monday somewhere else.</br>  Does anyone happen to have this with all of the panels translated?  <br>It's Monday in the only timezone that matters.</br>  <br>Look at stalker's imgur.</br>  <br>But it's not Monday in EST yet.</br>  <br>You know what they say. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.</br>  <br>Cute Kaga</br>  <br>Yes</br>  /a/nonymous, Refrain, do you two already have raws of Yokosuka Anthology Vol. 10?  <br>That's because EST doesn't matter.</br>  <br> Home of the NYSE <br> doesn't matter </br></br>  <br>I ripped it the day it came out.<br>http://www.mediafire.com/?n16wp2wz4<wbr>89047t</wbr></br></br>  <br>I think so</br>  <br>Slap more shitter, kaga-san</br>  <br> S2 fails <br> people drop the Vita games and completely ignore the special shit </br></br>  <br><br>okay cool, I'll stay off it then.</br></br>  <br>Might as well milk the series for all its worth now that it has peaked. It's not like Kadokawa even gets money out the browser game anyways.</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/W7oCW</br>  <br>Home of the FTSE &gt; home of the NYSE</br>  <br>You can also stay clear of the ones here<br>https://www.mediafire.com/?tns8acvx<wbr>zhsse<br><br>Play manga also has raws for all volumes out.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>With what Kadokawa has done to the anime, there's nothing left to milk on the anime side. If they want to milk anything, they'd better milk elsewhere.</br>  <br>Thank you</br>  <br> there's nothing left to milk on the anime side <br>Merchandise is still selling out.</br></br>  <br>And they'd do good to keep it that way. Making S2 will cause the sales to stop.</br>  <br>Chinks don't do the anthologies much, so I'm unlikely to run into those anyway.</br>  <br>Oh I thought you were buying raws, never mind.</br>  <br> buying things <br>hahahahaha</br></br>  <br>Is Kumano a shitposter?</br>  <br>What if S2 is just SoL episodes like the 6th DesDiv curry episode?</br>  <br> not buying Shiggy's figure </br>  <br/>  <br>The good thing about the 6thDesDiv curry episode was that it was (comparatively) well-written, not that it was SoL. Just SoL would be fine for 5-minute shorts or extras, though.</br>  <br>Then only a reboot will do. Bringing Kisaragi back like nothing happened will only raise more questions.</br>  <br>How much is shipping?</br>  Just animating the 4koma or play manga would make things better.    <br>I GET IT! SHIP 'CUZ THEY"RE SHIPS!<br><br>You crack me up.</br></br></br>  <br>I would be down for that couple.</br>  Forgot to upload it, 4koma Chapter 92.<br>https://www.mediafire.com/?m5qbzmmt<wbr>qm1n0nv</wbr></br>  <br>Just appreciating how great the anime was would make things better.</br>    Is Kaga's song on Youtube?  <br>Is the figure accurate? By that I mean are her panties black?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Kancolle has the best lesbians.</br>  <br>I don't understand this pairing.</br>  <br>They are fun to pair, yes.</br>  <br>Yep, I translated a chapter or two from it already. Thanks.<br><br><br>In my experience, RSAL would cost ¥2000 or so.<br><br><br>I really wish they had, although at this point the event related chapters might be a bit too out of date.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the first I've even seen of it.</br>  <br>There was this one time that Akizuki and Oboro (and probably some other ships) both escorted Shoukaku. This is the only time both of the ships were in the same place at the same time. <br>Yes, it's that weak.</br></br>   <br><br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/741281/cbf5<wbr>0712d7/<br><br>A true lady has the utmost in bladder discipline!</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Personally I think it's really disgusting that people don't recognize that Akizuki is a lesbian who only loves Oboro. It's pretty vile that they still try to make her into some kind of male admiral loving cock whore.</br>  <br> Shoukaku <br>Actually it seems to have been the Turkey.

This makes it possible for the same people to expect the thread to be there all the time and hang out in it.

Kadokawa responded that didn't do as well as they hoped, but still hit sales targets and hope to do better in season 2.<br><br><br>I think he means that the thread would reach bump limit and die, but would not be replaced with a new one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's what he means then yeah it should be like that.

In retrospect, sales are doing even worse too - no exclusive event ticket bundled with volumes 2 and onward.</br>  <br>Honestly it's to be expected when the anime was so bad and its competition that season was Fate and Scamco's scamming mobage adaptation.</br>  <br>Homosexual.</br>  <br>But all three of those are shit.</br>  <br>Yeah but TM and im@s have very very loyal fanbases.</br>  <br>Heterosexual.</br>  How much did the sales for the volumes after 1 drop?  <br>What a nasty dream you posted.</br>  <br> have very very loyal fanbases. <br>And it sucks.

I wish it wouldn't be so successful.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The are in there are is a common casualty in spoken English, but representing that in script can be something of a challenge.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds more like he meant "normal" as in "I'm shit talking you faggots but trying to make it sound like I'm not shit talking you because this is a professional meeting." If you think they didn't miss a lot more potential revenue with that, you'll never make it as a producer.</br>  <br>I feel the same way but unfortunately Japan has shit taste.</br>  <br>I wouldn't lie to you anon.</br>  <br>What?<br><br><br>This sounds about right actually, Japanese people will rarely outright criticize each other, especially in formal contexts.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If I was in that meeting I would've stood up and called his favorite ship shit.</br></br>    Anyone got that one image of the TTK that wants to fatten up Ayanami kai ni?  <br>Notice how Ducky is at the center like she should be.</br>  Bookwalker hasn't put Sasebo vol 8 up yet so I'm not sure if I'll get it next week, usually they put incoming books within a few weeks of release.
