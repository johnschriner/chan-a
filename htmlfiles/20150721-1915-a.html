All those perverts who think it'll have nipples and shit when even the manga doesn't have it. It's not really an accurate portrayal of series popularity simply because it's skewed so far up by people wanting to see some softcore BDSM hentai.</br></br>  Gangstafags and fujoshit on suicide watch.  reminder that Rokka no Yuusha is literally the biggest flop in recent history  <br> ***,160位/***,157位 (***,435 pt) [*,**8予約] 2015/09/30 Prison School 1 [Blu-ray] <br>Noice, I'm afraid posting at Prison School thread since they didn't like the show at all. While I actually enjoyed it, the most I had fun from all the show this season.</br></br>  <br>I dont get it, why do people post preorder threads this early in the season?<br><br>Are you people retarded or just want a excuse to fling shit at each other using numbers that mean nothing this early?</br></br></br>  <br>Of all the things you could be butthurt about, you chose to be buttfurt about popularity of Prison School disc sales?</br>  <br><br>How much did it cost, what are the projecting sales?</br></br>  <br>Gangasta's actually relevant, unlike  SamFlam  which never ever appeared in these threads unless people were laughing at it. Gangsta has a pre-existing fanbase for Manglobe to tap into, much like their Hayate seasons and OVAs did.</br>  <br> just want a excuse to fling shit at each other using numbers that mean nothing this early? <br><br>We'll post any excuse for a shit flinging fest in /a/, yes.<br>Problem?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not butthurt, I'm just pointing out that these projected sales, which are just preorders that could be cancelled at any point in the future, aren't indicative of the actual quality of the series.</br>  <br>You mean,  THE STRONGEST'S FLOP </br>  <br>Just properly name it "Shitposting general" then.<br><br>No one will have to bother getting sales that no one cares or looks at and you still get your shitflinging</br></br></br>  What about Ranpo Kitan?  <br> "I haven't read the manga and I love sucking cock on a daily basis" <br>Wew anon, you didn't have to be so direct in your post</br></br>  *29,232位/*28,865位 (***,*34 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/09/16 Jitsu wa watashi wa 1 [Blu-ray]  <br>Except there are nipple in the manga, go read it fag.</br>  <br> indicative of the actual quality of the series <br> suggesting anyone is indicating this <br><br>You like to box shadows don't you</br></br></br></br>  <br>**1,921位/**1,728位 (***,*48 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/09/30 乱歩奇譚 Game of Laplace 1 (完全生産限定版) [Blu-ray]</br>  <br>Mizushima's brand power<br><br>And is a good show</br></br></br>  <br>He has a point, though. The author doesn't really go much more than the vice prez's vagina during the first arc.</br>  <br>Jesus, stop being a faggot. <br>It's just a data posted relevant to anime, it's not like OP expressed any opinions. <br><br>Whatever we do in the thread has no relevance to whether the info posted is legit.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder if Kyoshi x Hana does not happen I'm never watching harem nor anything romance related.  <br> Okusama ga Seitokaichou far above Gangsta <br><br>why</br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever watched Hajime no Ippo?</br>  <br>Makes sense, the anime has terrible character designs that don't capture the appeal of the manga.  It's the eyes, stupid. <br><br><br>Because waifus always sell BDs. Remember, the only people who buy them in Japan are hardcore otaku who are willing to shell out upwards of $120 for a 4-episode disc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hajime no Ippo <br> not Baki <br><br>I prefer boxing imagined giant bugs, thank you</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also helps that it has an uncensored broadcast. When you're not a huge title and you go censored, you'll probably flop.</br></br>  <br> All those perverts who think it'll have nipples and shit when even the manga doesn't have it. <br>Except it does, retard.</br></br>  <br>Because it's more enjoyable.</br>  <br>Don't forget the "It's her FUCKING NIPPLE"-scene and Anzu's misfitting bra.</br>  <br> Anime <br> At most 26 episodes <br> Ever reaching the point of nipple exposure </br></br></br>   implying the anime wont end when they get out of prison <br>It'll be an enjoyable ride until then I guess, if it even gets to that point</br>  <br>Totally forgot about Anzu's nipslip. But the nipple scene is just 1 scene that'll be in 1 episode out of however many it has. It's not like TLRD</br>  <br>And you know, the many many other time where they just casually have them in</br>  <br> ***,160位/***,157位 (***,435 pt) [*,**8予約] 2015/09/30 Prison School 1 [Blu-ray] </br>  <br>So what is it? No nipple slips or no "important" nipple slips?</br>  <br>looks like a shit season for anime sales</br>  Prison School season 2 incoming, that Kate licking Mari's nipple scene needs to be animated  Walk into your room<br><br>see this<br><br>what do?</br></br></br></br>  Wonder why my mattress is on a bed frame and not directly on the floor. Frames are bad for my back.  <br>My room is not pink or 2D so clearly I am in the wrong fucking room.</br>  Call the police  Commit a crime, go to jail, do not pass go, etc.  <br>If the frame is straight, and pretty much all bed frames are straight, why does it matter?</br>  <br>Wonder why OP is a fag</br>  Lie down in between them and stare at Illya while creepily smiling as she slowly wakes up to my pale disgusting fat neckbeard face.   people are actually turned on by this <br><br>It almost as disgusting as that Iori gif with her shaking her nonexistent ass and those soulless eyes.</br></br>  Nothing because I don't find Prisma Ilya attractive. I only find F/SN Ilya hot.  <br><br>Generally it's just not flat or solid enough for me. The elevation too.<br><br>The closer my mattress is to the floor, the better I sleep.</br></br></br></br>  Flop down on the mattress and see how high it launches them.  Crawl under the bed and sleep if heads<br><br>Roll up and down the bed from foot to head and back again while I pretend to be dio's road roller.</br></br>  <br>road roller if tales* I meant.</br>  <br>Lay down on my bed.</br>  Prisma hype reaching critical capacity and it makes me happy inside. 3rei is all but confirmed now.  <br>Take the pillow away from the bad girl and give it to the good girl</br>  <br>Dig into their anus with my index and middle fingers and lift them up with them.</br>  Would ask them to move away from my bed, however I really dislike waking people up.  <br>Shit I should do this.<br><br>Or better yet do best doing what they do in the land of the gods.</br></br></br>  <br> I put my mattress on the floor when I was 8 because that way no monsters could hide under there. <br><br>I was a fucking GENIUS.</br></br></br>  mape the raids  <br>Hope that next time 2D comes true, it won't be a FUCKING LAZY SHIT QUALITY COPY PASTE PANTY WORTHLESS SHOT like this was, holy shit I was angry that they couldn't even draw panties appealing.</br>  The maids rape  Which one farts more in their sleep?  <br> Give Kuro a Pillow <br> Give them a blanket <br> Shut down the light <br> turn around <br> get on the floor <br> everybody do the dinosaur </br></br></br></br></br></br>  [x] Put it in  I crawl into bed and enjoy the best day of my life. My hardest decision will be which one I'll tenderly love first.  <br><br>yeah instead they just slept with you dumbass nice going its probably why you post on this anonymous saudi homosexual activism imageboard.</br></br>  <br>I put on my robe and wizard hat</br>  <br>Wonder how my bed which is a couch turn into a normal bed.</br>  <br>Press face on the brown girls butt and enjoy the every second of it.</br>  Turn 360 degree and walk away.  <br> tap them gently  then  ask them if they need a blanket </br>  <br>Wish I had two faces.</br>  Rub my dick in between both of those beautiful ass cheeks until I cum on both of their backs.<br><br>Then go to bed in the middle with an erection, so when they wake up they can service me.</br></br>  <br>I can get away with it if I can cook, right?</br>  <br>What's the appeal of cummong on a girl's back?<br>That always happens in everything western.<br>Cum inside their butt, vagina or mouth for greater satisfaction.</br></br></br>  <br>On their backs? It is like you aren't even thinking of their pleasure. You'll turn one of those girls over, pull down her panties and lick until she organisms, then you can cum. The will be cuddling afterwards and then you'll need to turn over and help the other girl. After they are both satisfied then you can sleep.</br>  [X]Rape the maids  Cover them with blanket. Slip in between them and wait for what happens next.  The prisma fanbase managed to outcancer the regular fate fanbase.<br><br>That is a pretty impressive feat.</br></br>  <br>What the hell did you expect.</br>  <br>Yeah, so now go back to your fucking FSN generals.</br>  <br>I find it odd that the prisma spinoff is more interesting to me than the main fate universe.</br>  <br>He thinks the fate franchise is cancer, so that means he hasn't read the VN and hates fate threads.<br><br>Get your shit right.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he doesn't like Prisma, which makes me think he is actually a normie, so probably a Fate fag in disguise, just here to throw his feces on Illya fags.</br>  <br>I think it's quite hot if they have a nice butt<br>not sure why entirely but i like it</br></br>  <br>and how would raping some poor innocent maid help the situation?</br>  <br>Scoring up deep inside her butt, effectively forcing them to digest your semen is way hotter.<br>Or hitting their little womb, obviously.</br></br>  <br>Normies don't read VNs, and anyone who has not read the VN does not have an opinion on Fate, therefore what's his face is a total outsider.</br>  <br> Normies don't read VNs, and anyone who has not read the VN does not have an opinion on Fate <br>Not true, when it's FSN.<br>Every casual and his mother read it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't wait for Fate to be on steam</br></br>  <br> actually believes this <br>People who read the VN aren't "normalfags"<br>For proof, look at all the people in the UBW threads calling others secondaries for being dumb</br></br></br>  Im sure the majority in fate threads are anime only fags.  <br> tfw not into anal </br>  <br>Faggot.</br>  I want to F*CKING murder everyone who sexualizes Ilya. SHE IS NOT YOUR LITTLE SEX TOY YOU LOLICON F*CKERS!  <br>That's why fate threads become much better the further from an anime they are. In half a year, the threads will be good again.</br>    <br> People who read the VN aren't "normalfags" <br>Yes, they are.<br>People calling out secondaries are the biggest casuals.<br>Reading one, very casual and teen appealing VN won't make them somehow hardcore. Not when it's basically on Naruto level of popularity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> SHE IS NOT YOUR LITTLE SEX TOY  <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>[ ] call the police<br>[ ] call mods<br>[x] genuflect<br>[ ] confess to john cena</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course she's not your little sex toy, she's MY little sex toy.</br>  <br>I only like anal if it's with a man, so that's pretty accurate</br>  <br><br>Fate fags should fucking get out of Prisma Illya threads, and everything would be nice.<br>Fucking A type scum.</br></br></br>  <br> getting upset over animu <br>either b8 or you have the patchiest neckbeard on /a/</br></br>  Kick them out of my fucking room.<br><br>They have their own beds. I wanna lay down and watch chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br><br> "I-if it's popular it's bad!!" <br>Kill yourself. And I know you're the same fag from the other Illya thread.<br><br>Nobodies shitting up the Illya threads with "normalfag" shit. Look at the threads and it's clearly normal prisma discussion, with you shitting up the place constantly complaining about a non-issue. <br><br>Oh and by the way, Prisma and Fate are the same shit. You can't hate one and love the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The real crime is that you posted the gif instead of the webm. I want to fap to them in higher quality.</br>  <br>underrate post</br>  <br>Draw my gun, but keep the safety on for now. Call police.</br>  From the perspective of the picture I'm assuming that I became taller.<br><br>I would go outside and look the world from this newly acquired height.<br><br>Probably go and kick some ass on b-ball.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't hate one and love the other. <br>Having completely opposite target audience says otherwise.<br>Get lost you fucking normal faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> You can't hate one and love the other. <br><br>Oh, so that means DEEN's fate now can't be shit on. Great one.</br></br></br>  <br>post it</br>  <br>Tuck them in. What else is there to do?</br>  <br>Nobody is turned on by this. It's drawn horrible.<br>This, on the other hand.</br></br>  <br><br>A lot of things, I can think at least 500 things to do in any given room.</br></br>  <br>You have my full attention sir. Do go on.</br>  <br> completely different audience <br>Where did you get this bullshit from? You're making Fate out to be Naruto which it isn't. And Prisma isn't some "lel super hardcore loli show" like your making it out to be.<br>They're both meant for an 18 and older audience.<br><br>I'm talking about the worldbuilding here, it's the same shit between both.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Normalfags love the franchise and a lot of them played the vn. Stop being delusional.</br>  <br> They're both meant for an 18 and older audience. <br> FSN <br> 18 and older <br>My sides. Orbit.<br> You're making Fate out to be Naruto which it isn't <br>It is.<br> And Prisma isn't some "lel super hardcore loli show" <br>At least it has loli sexualization, something that FSN casual fags are disgusted in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck them, I guess.</br>  <br> shiny red butt <br>absolutelyharam.jpg</br></br>  <br>fsn is literally 18+ though, its porn</br>  <br>huh what? prisma is fan service for TM fans<br>the prisma anime has the best fight scenes in any TM adaptation, the loliservice part isnt the most important honestly</br></br>  <br>Porn for kids.<br> implying we live in the 90's where this mattered </br></br>  <br>The one being delusional is the one claiming that Fate and SAO have the entirety of the same audience, which is bullshit.<br><br>Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN.<br><br>And not only that, he's claiming these people specifically go into Prisma threads and shit them up, which is clearly not happening.<br><br>And how am I being delusional? I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Both are made for an 18 and older audience so its the same !!!! <br><br>I really hope you aren't serious.</br></br></br>  <br> implying SoL and loli service isn't the important part of Prisma Illya <br>Thank you FSN casual, now fuck back to generals.</br></br>  <br>rub my ugly, stinking dark, hairy weiner and balls on their crotches and asses.</br>  <br> relying on the "Fate is shounen XD" meme <br>Can't even take you seriously. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>All of these loli what do threads...</br>  <br> Fate and SAO have the ''entirety'' of the same audience, which is bullshit. <br> Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN. <br><br>That is true, though. <br><br> I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level. <br><br>Obviously not all of them. But its the majority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one being delusional is the one claiming that Fate and SAO have the entirety of the same audience, which is bullshit <br>They are almost exactly the same audience.<br> Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN. <br>They do.<br> And not only that, he's claiming these people specifically go into Prisma threads and shit them up, which is clearly not happening. <br>Apparently, it's happening.<br> And how am I being delusional? I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level <br>There are probably some Naruto fans who aren't normalfags either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please dont shitpost and lets discuss things like sane people without telling each other to kill ourselves<br>you can't deny prisma has the best fight scenes in the franchise, s1 had the best version of Emiya as well<br>sure there are lots of loli images posted in the threads but when you actually watch the adaptation you realize it's not all there is going for it</br></br></br>  <br>That's a fucking wonderfully erotic thought.</br>  <br>Lay down between them and take a nap, couple of nice space heaters like that will keep me warm.</br>  can someone tell me what is a normalfag now? if we're counting vn readers as normalfags then i dont fucking know anymore<br>i thought they were just, well, normal people who had a wife and kids and whatnot</br>  <br>Nigga what the hell is wrong with you? The main focus of that show is clearly the loli fanservice.</br>  <br>The fights might have been animated well, but they were still shit. Would have been much better as a complete SoL series, with more of the classmates.</br>  <br>Almost the entire fanbase of Prisma has seen another Fate work, why the fuck can you not claim they don't intersect at least on some of the audience?<br>I'm not claiming that everybody whose seen Fate is going to like Prisma obviously.</br></br>  <br>have you watched/read it?<br>the plot and fights are great, i read it for those</br></br>  <br> VN readers <br>It's like saying "anime watchers".<br>There are VNs for many kind of audience, and FSN is for normal fags. FSN normalfags = kids, who still live a normal social lives, go to school, talk about how cool they and their hobbies are with their friends.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Have no argument <br> "well it's happening I swear!" </br></br></br>  <br>Don't use image of a girl you don't even like for more as "daughteru", you faggot.</br>  <br> Almost the entire fanbase of Prisma has seen another Fate work <br><br>No shit, sherlock. It doesn't work the other way around, though. <br><br><br>You are the 1%.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you even saying? I like Prisma.</br>  <br>ive never seen someone in highschool who knew about fsn<br>then again, i wasn't in highschool when fsn was a thing<br><br>can you tell me what normalfag means now though? seems like the meaning is pretty broad</br></br></br></br>    <br>Then what the fuck is your point? If Prisma shares entirely people that have seen Fate, then obviously Fate can't be just "normalfags".</br>  <br>What kind of evidence am I supposed to have for something like this? I don't want to bring up my personal experience with people like that. Also, its not like you have any evidence either.<br><br>Well, just go to /r/anime or some other casual faggot forum and ask them if they have played the fate vn.</br></br></br>  push them to one side and sleep<br><br>fuck are u hogging all the room on the bed for bitches, you best sleep right next to each other if not hugging each other</br></br>  <br>You know, people who live a normal life, like socially acceptable things and definitely wouldn't feel attracted to little girls like Illya or Kuro.<br>In short, FSN fags.</br></br>  <br> a/nons <br> making their bed </br></br>  <br> Flat chests and flat butts <br> no hips <br><br>You guys are going against nature.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this too I guess.</br></br>  <br>this just sounds like "someone i hate" to me<br>generalizations are usually pretty dumb<br>im pretty glad "normalfags" exist anyways, i wouldn't get my autism money if not for people who were working</br></br></br>  <br> not making your bed </br>  <br> his room isn't pink <br>u gay son?</br></br>  Also theres no way normalfags would read a 60 hour eroge VN, lol, unless they're readers and are especially fast at reading. Which a lot of normalfags do not like reading to that extent.  <br><br> not having a cute loli meido that makes your bed <br><br>P L E B<br>L<br>E<br>B</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If Prisma shares entirely people that have seen Fate, then obviously Fate can't be just "normalfags". <br><br>Not ''entirely'' and not ''just''. I feel like you are trolling me. Nobody can be this dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>but fsn has anime porn, and it still has illya<br>i really dont know what you people are on about, it sounds kinda insane to me that an anime porn game would appeal to your typical dudebro</br></br>  <br>If you couldn't tell by the way he writes, don't listen to him. His definition of a normalfag is screwed. He also makes out Prisma to be a series he only watches for his "leet loli hentai" and ignores that the rest of it like the fights are pretty decent.</br>  <br>Pull down there panties.</br>  <br>I prefer to bully anyways<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bmt<wbr>JzjWhcY8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Except Prisma fans probably didn't like that other Fate work, since it has a completely different appeal, such as having edgy murders here and there, a whiny fag male protag who "mans up", and it hating loli.<br>Illya is pretty much the opposite. Even Shirou is better.</br></br>  <br>I have this too.</br>  <br> You are the 1% <br><br>but i have a friend who thinks alike, i guess we're the 2% or something</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why that guy is full of shit<br><br>I was addressing your point on Fate being "casual and entry-level", which you just admitted has a ton of fans who clearly are more than casuals. <br><br>The other point you wee making is that Fate "normalfags" were shitting up Illya threads, which they weren't. And even then, it's dumb as shit seeing Prisma is a subset of Fate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats not how it works.</br>  <br> Outcancer <br>You must be crazy. They are way worse.</br></br>  <br>Nah, liking lolis is natural instinct of all men, especially after they start developing hips and budding breasts. Illya definitely fall into the category that men finds biologically arousing. Except faggots who probably have problems with erection too. <br>That picture is just shit quality lazy work, which I'm angry about too.</br></br>  <br> Shirou never had hot, passionate but hard sex with his   onee-chan <br>This is why reality is cruel.</br></br>  <br>sniff their butts.</br>  <br> lol <br><br>You are the normalfag.</br></br></br>  <br>You are so fucking delusional. Not even gonna entertain your comments about Shirou being whiny and it "hating loli" (what does that even mean? How can you hate loli? You mean the Illya route which was cut due to time restraints? Jesus.)</br>  <br> even having a bed <br><br>Fucking hammocks bitch.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It is casual and entry level. Exceptions aren't examples.<br>And rest assured, the average Fate fag is disgusted in lolis, and it's no coincidence FSN doesn't have Illya sex scene.</br></br></br>  <br>same tbh fam smh</br>  <br> it is casual and entry level <br>yes, but that isn't akin to appealing to dudebros<br><br> and it's no coincidence FSN doesn't have Illya sex scene. <br>because nasu is a lazy butt?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cut due to time restraints <br>Sure. It's interesting that it just happened to be a loli we can't fuck.<br>No, they never even intended on it, Illya is just there for cheap drama and shock value, getting brutally murdered as how teens like it, since she's a "shitty little girl".</br></br></br>  <br> casual and entry-level <br>Define what this even means? A lot of people play it as their first VN? Okay. Doesn't make the series worse off.<br> no Illya sex scene <br>Holy shit I can't even believe you're posting this like it proves a point. You're literally just going<br> lel DFC true otaku XD <br>at this point. And by the way it was cut due to time restraints, not for "not disgusting the audience" like you think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why the fuck would you want more nasu h scenes, they're fucking dumb as shit</br></br>  <br> I was addressing your point on Fate being "casual and entry-level" <br><br>Thats exactly what it is. <br><br> which you just admitted has a ton of fans who clearly are more than casuals.  <br><br> It has tons of non-casual fan because of prisma and other obvious reasons. That doesn't mean it can't be an entry-level anime. Your whole way of thinking is absolutely retarded.<br><br> The other point you wee making is that Fate "normalfags" were shitting up Illya threads, which they weren't.  <br><br>I never said that. How do you even know they aren't doing that?<br><br> And even then, it's dumb as shit seeing Prisma is a subset of Fate. <br><br>Amd its something completely different at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cheap drama and shock value <br> getting brutally murdered <br>Only happens in a third of the routes, did you even read the VN?<br>You obviously haven't read Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it was cut because loli is niche, and disgusting for your average teen.<br>I'm not saying only people who like loli are "true otaku", but I can assure you that normalfags don't like lolicon, and are disgusted by the idea.<br>That's the real reason a loli hating franchise decided not to have a route.</br></br></br>  <br>Lie inbetween and cuddle them. Assuming I know them.<br>Else I'll double check to be sure I am in the right house.</br></br>   getting turned on by little girls <br>Pedos, every single one of you.</br>  <br> acting like Prisma is why Fate has a ton of non-casual fans <br>You're fucking insane. It's clearly the VN and Zero.</br></br>  <br>dude, you're not special because you like loli<br>just go on the boorus and look at how many dumb teens post LMAO BEST LOLI EVAR xDDD<br><br>again, you are no special snowflake</br></br></br></br>  <br> VN <br> Zero <br> not for casual <br>Please, this is weak even for a bait.<br><br><br>I've read it, and guess what? Still no Illya route.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or more likely because Nasu is lazy?<br>It's not like type-moon hasn't done sex scenes with lolis, look at Len from Tsukihime.</br></br>  <br>Redditors/mal/other anime sites and americans would flip their shit if the fate anime had a sex scene with illya.</br>  Gag them, tie their hands and feet, carry them downstairs and then tie their bodies around a pole. Rape them.  <br> special snowflake <br>Nobody said that, ever.<br>It still doesn't change the fact normalfags are disgusted by lolis being sexualized. Not to mention if we got to plow her.</br></br></br>  <br>do sleep better on the ground floor rather than on the fourth? how about at sea level instead of above it?</br>  <br>I said ''and other obvious reasons''. That cinludes the VN. <br><br>But now normalfags started playing vns so it doesn't mean all that much anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>so? normals are disgusted by anime in general <br>unless we're using some warped version of normalfag, kind of like what /v/ did with weeaboo</br></br></br>  <br>You're acting like liking Zero and the VN instantly makes you a casual. Which is just your shit taste that nobody agrees with. And Prisma is literally the same thing, the only differentiation is that it has loli fan service. <br><br>So what you saying is that the only reason anybody watches and likes Prisma is loli fan service. Which isn't true for majority of people.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd flip a shit if there was ANY sex scene. It's an anime, not a hentai. The VN is different obviously.</br>  <br>Anime is not as niche as to prevent the most casual fanbases from being normals.<br>See Dragon Ball for example. And obviously, FSN is among those fanbases mostly consists of normals.<br><br><br>Exceptions still aren't the rules.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Tie them before they wake up, then procced to enjoy my new toys.</br>  <br> normals are disgusted by anime in general <br><br>Are you living under a rock?</br></br></br>    can you watch this without giving a shit about regular Fate anything?  <br>even if this was true, i still fail to see the problem with having people you dont like liking the same things as you do<br>in the end, why does that even matter and how does it affect you in particular?</br></br>  <br>The point was you haven't provided any solid reason why TM cut Illya route due to apparently hating lolis?</br>  <br> it has loli fanservice <br>And SoL. And cuteness. Actually, aside from the fights, it's the complete opposite of FSN. Which is what I am talking about.<br>And even the fights aren't edgy in the manner of killing off everyone or something, they are magical fights, not murdering people.<br><br>They'd flip a shit if there were Illya sex scene in the VN too.<br><br>And there's a reason why FSN got crazy popularity among the normals, and not Tsukihime's sequel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Go play vidiya gaems or something  <br>i dont think you should really, its pretty much akin to things like carnival phantasm in terms of TM fanservice</br>  <br>Not anymore.<br><br>Fucking garbage like CR and Netflix are trying to make anime socially acceptable.</br></br></br>  <br> You're acting like liking Zero and the VN instantly makes you a casual <br><br>Thats not what he said/implyied/whatever. <br><br> And Prisma is literally the same thing, the only differentiation is that it has loli fan service.  <br><br>Its not even close to being the same thing. Its centered around loli fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude what<br>FSN is like 70% SoL<br>did everyone somehow forget about the cooking?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Go die you spic scum</br></br>  <br>Yes, liking loli is a good reason to watch it.</br>  <br>this nigga knows the comfy life</br>  <br>Having a loli only to be killed in different humiliating ways, and never giving her a route speaks for itself.<br>For your information, kids usually hate little girls.<br><br>The problem is not with those who like FSN and Prisma Illya too for what they are. The problem is with FSN fags that start to post their FSN faggotry and how disgusting pedos those are who enjoy Illya for what it is, not to mention those who spout "secondaries" to people who don't want to read that boring shit VN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lol where da problem at? xD <br><br>Normalfags like you posting in Prisma thread are the problem.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit this entire post is retarded<br> battles in FSN are only about murder <br>What? And Prisma has Servants who die too, the class cards. <br> They flip a shit if there was a Ilya sex scene in the VN <br>Not they wouldn't. Who gives a shit? Every other VN has that.<br> There's a reason why FSN got crazy popularity with the normals, and not Tsukihime's sequel <br>Yeah, and that's clearly because Fate is the bigger fucking franchise, as opposed to the add-on to the lesser known franchise. Acting like it had ANYTHING to do with a Len sex scene is insane.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. You're ven better off in a sense.<br>Don't listen to this  faggot. All you will miss are the references to a shitty VN.</br></br>  <br>Thats simply not true.</br>    <br> Not they wouldn't. <br>Yes, they would.<br> Who gives a shit? <br>Normalfags.<br> Every other VN has that. <br>Those are not massively popular with normals.<br> What? And Prisma has Servants who die too, the class cards.  <br>You can't compare to those fights with the murderous intent FSN fights. Class cards are just cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well all i see is this thread with someone going on about how fsn is shit for being a dudebro vn apparently?<br><br><br>dude, i have autism bucks, does this look like something a normal would own to you?</br></br></br></br>   retards think normalfags don't read Visual Novels <br><br>Aren't there vns on steam? Also, there was a kickstarter for a localized Grisaia. Normalfags love vns if they get an anime. Friendly reminder that they also use the word ''waifu'' all the fucking time.<br><br>Times change.</br></br></br></br>  Commit adultery.  <br>Yes. Yes it does.</br>   NORMALFAG NORMALFAG NORMALFAG <br><br>and you people say you're better than the other boards when it comes to memespouting</br></br>  <br>It's not centered around loli fan service. Maybe in the beginning, and it's a recurring thing, but it's mostly a lot of SoL comedy and battle scenes.<br><br> Kids usually hate little girls <br>How does this apply? Even if you're claiming Normalfags are invading they aren't fucking 12. Don't give me bullshit like "a lot of 12 year olds have read a 60 hour eroge VN and are now shitposting in Prisma threads"<br> normalfags are calling out Prisma for loli fan service <br>Again the<br> lol DFC otaku superiority!! <br>meme.

Yes, looking back, Kenshin was shitty.  Yes, the author said he was, that's why he stopped using him.    <br><br><br><br>Read Saito's side manga and you might change your mind a bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Saito's side manga <br>He was the best character out of the whole series let him have a good 2nd place.</br></br>  what is this manga  <br>Naruto</br>  <br>He took down Evangelion-Man. Hiko is ridiculously overpowered and could've saved Japan by himself but he just didn't give a fuck. <br>Those pottery yen and artistic recognition.</br></br>  <br>My Little Shadow Assassin During The Bakumatsu Can't Be This Cute.</br>  <br>Would the wolf of mibu and the first sword of the shinsengumi settle for second place?</br>  <br>You have any doubts?</br>  <br>He admitted his side lost. Also, he doesn't really care about rank or titles or that shit. He Kills Evil Immediately.</br>  <br>We'll never know because he barely did shit.<br><br><br> Death of the Author </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shishio was.</br></br>  <br>Saito got owned by Shishio tho.</br>  <br>Hiko could've beaten Shishio, Are you kidding me? He's so much stronger than Kenshin it's not even funny.</br>  <br>what side manga</br>  <br>Wasn't the emotionless brat on his side better than him? I dont know, its been a fucking while.</br>  <br>Nah, Soujiro was really good and a prodigy but Shishio was stronger. He was stronger than Kenshin too (Though perhaps that is because of what he went through)</br>  <br>What about Enishi?</br>  <br>He was so op the author had to make up a reason not to use him which was, Shishio isn't a national problem so he's not worth my time. I'm gunna make pots and drink instead.</br>  <br>Shishio had researched Saito's moves, knew he would go for a lounge to the forehead and prepared himself. It was pretty lucky and ballsy; Saito could've stabbed him through the eye or any part of his face - unless he headbutted the Gatotsu on purpose (Which sounds like somethign Shishio would do).<br>Without preptime it's hard to tell who would've won. Sword duels are decided by a bunch of factors that doesn't necessarily determine the better swordsman. I think Saito himself said "If you survive, you won" or something.</br></br>  <br>Enishi was not stronger than Shishio, IMO. Kenshin lost to him at first because his mind was fucked by guilt and regret. <br> That Kaoru doll was a fucking stupid cop-out, and was bullshit, but at the same time I'm glad the ending was a happy one. </br></br>  <br>My shitty channel never aired the full series, did he got his two waifus?</br>  <br>Kenshin only won because of the sheathing thing he did to damage Enishi's ears. I think Shishio would loose against Enishi.</br>  <br>Enishi's style was also built to counter Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, wasn't it?<br><br>Against Shishio's style, he'd be fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>Saito got a side manga too? I thought it was just Shishio.</br>  <br>Shishio was a weak ass and would have died to Kenshin much sooner had Kenshin used an actual blade considering how much blood loss Shishio would have experienced under a real blade compared to bruises.</br>  <br>Yeah but it shows that the entire theme about "REVENGE IS BAD BAAAW!" turned out to be even more bullshit.<br><br>If she died, it would have been more hilarious how that philosophy of allowing pedophiles and baby murderers alive (especially if those murderers in particular killed someone of your family) and then go all "Well lets forget and forgive right? let bygones be begyones."<br>Those kind of people are the ones that I relish when I see them suffer due to they actually want other decent people not to take revenge and justice aswell for their families that have suffered.<br>Or worse, if someones pet been killed by some kid (in my town it was a hedgehog who some 12 year old poked to death and then used his boot to kick it to death) and the SJW people were all like: "-:WELL HE IS JUST A KID! PEOPLE THAT AGE USUALLY KILL SMALL ANIMALS AND TORTURE THEM! DIDNT YOU GUYS DO THAT TOO?"<br>On a good note, its one of the few samurai mangas thats not about that fucking sengoku period, where the hell can one find any other manga or anime about any samurai period before that?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He still isn't on Hiko's level. The only people who come remotely close are Soujiro and Enishi.</br>  <br> Shishio was a weak ass <br>The guy survived a bullet to the head &amp; getting lit on fire. He even got right back up after Kenshin's blows.<br>  <br> Enishi <br>It's flat out said that Enishi is weaker than Shishio but is in a better position to defeat Kenshin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shishio had researched Saito's moves <br><br>Actually, Shishio has fought hundreds of Shinsengumi, who all use Hiratsuki style of swordsmanship which the Gatotsu is based on.<br><br>In short, Saito is meh tier. Not all that impressed with him in terms of Kenshin hierarchy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hiko could've beaten Shishio <br>Could've, would've doesn't matter. It's the people who actually did shit that actually matter.</br></br>  <br> It's flat out said that Enishi is weaker than Shishio but is in a better position to defeat Kenshin. <br><br>What does that even mean?</br></br></br>  <br>It's a handicapped person versus a complete offense expert. Anon, pls.</br>  Didn't Kenshin beat Hiko in a fight?  <br>He Amakakeru'd him.</br>  <br>Kenshin was the only one saving Japan. Hiko practically did shit.</br>  <br>It means that Shishio's overall stronger, but Enishi has certain advantages against Kenshin specifically. Basically, rather than a level advantage, Enishi has an elemental advantage.</br>  You know, Kenshin would have actually beaten Shishio outright had he used a proper sword. He got plenty of direct hits on Shishio with his reverse blade. If he'd used a normal sword, his Kuzuryusen would have dismembered Shishio.  <br>In a ritual designed for the Hiten Mitsurugi ryu's disciple to kill his master and become the next Seijuro Hiko.</br>  <br>Probably, but that was the handicap that the story gave Kenshin. By murdering that many people - and his wife - being so young, he became fucked up in the head and lost it. So he vowed never to kill again. Basically, in his particular case, the slippery slope fallacy applies because he probably wouldn't be able to stop if he started to kill again. That was his fear and one of the great tensions of that arc.</br>  <br>If what you said applied, Kenshin should've been killed by the Ishin Shishi and Shishio would've torn Japan a new one. <br>Also, revenge fucks you up, no matter how justified it is; there's a thousand stories that deal with this fact. <br>I'm not saying criminals in certain conditions cannot be killed, especially in a heated situation like in a fucking swordfight, but I'd say revenge as a general idea is not a good thing.</br></br></br>  Amakusa Shougo was stronger than Kenshin  <br> It means that Shishio's overall stronger <br>Not really, since Enishi could probably bulldoze through Shishio and last longer than 15 minutes.</br></br>  <br>His non-killing version of the Kuzu Ryu Sen also uses the hilt rather than a neck stab.</br>  <br>So in short he should've died there.</br>  <br> Without preptime it's hard to tell who would've won. <br><br>That's something a Saito apologist would say. Fact remains, Shishio busted that boy up like he was his bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but it would've been his choice. It wasn't a true fight, he accepted his fate and resigned himself to die. Only due to him being a man of immense fortune, he did not die and proceeded to further his legend by slaying fucking giants.<br>Ha, I'm joking.<br>He didn't kill the giant. The government put him to work on the fields.</br></br></br>  <br>Believe what you will. It's also true that none of the fighters that came to Shishio were in top shape; Saito had been stabbed in both legs and Kenshin and Aoshi were worn out from previous fights. Sano was spent too, but even at his best Sano had no chance.</br>  <br>I used to think that Saito was cool as well, but when I got older and reread Kenshin, I realized that Saito's role most of the time in the manga is to stand on the sideline with the other people and provide obvious exposition narration to what is happening in the battle and smoke which made me lose respect for the character.</br>  <br>I also think his fighting style was supposed to be a great counter to Kenshin's.</br>  <br>Shishio wasn't in top shape and he owned their asses until the Amakakeru.</br>  <br> Yeah, but it would've been his choice. It wasn't a true fight, he accepted his fate and resigned himself to die. <br><br>You keep sucking the dick of someone who doesn't do shit in the series and would rather die than do shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Saito is instrumental to the good guys' victory. Without him they would've lost. Same as Sano; they would not have sunk the Rengoku without him, and Japan would've been fucked. <br>Kenshin is a story in which all characters fit their designated roles; Saito never eclipses Kenshin since he's not the protagonist. He's a government sanctioned vigilante who answers to no one and murders conspirators; that's pretty cool - perhaps not cooler than the others, or cool in a different way. <br>He's a pretty flawed character too, but that adds to his charm.</br></br></br>  <br>No I'm not. I'd honestly rather Hiko not exist because he throws away the story balance by being so fucking overpowered. Doesn't detract from the fact that he's ridiculously overpowered.<br>The way I describe him in my post is just an exaggeration for comedic effect.</br></br>  <br> I'd honestly rather Hiko not exist because he throws away the story balance by being so fucking overpowered. <br> overpowered <br><br>Bitch, how would you even know he's overpowered if he doesn't do shit?<br><br> Watsuki said so <br><br>Death of the Author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Overpowered because he outsmarted Kenshin in a few sparring matches?<br><br>Really, bitch? Kenshin was wounded by the likes of Cho and he always finds a way to win. Just like KyoAni.</br></br></br>  <br>He stops the giant's blow, standing his ground, with his own two hands. The blow that leveled a fucking building. He fights Kenshin playfuly and Kenshin barely grazes him putting his life on the line.<br>It's all there in the story.</br></br>  <br> He stops the giant's blow, standing his ground, with his own two hands. <br><br>Are you honestly implying that Fuji can beat Shishio?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it, I'm out of here. There's no man more blind than the one who doesn't wanna see.</br>  <br> He fights Kenshin playfuly and Kenshin barely grazes him putting his life on the line. <br><br>In a sparring match, though.</br></br></br>  <br>You're saying that Fuji is stronger than Shishio if you're more impressed by Hiko beating him than Kenshin beating a whole battery of enemies and the one-man army known as Shishio.</br>  <br>Death of the author is the equivalent of plugging your ears with your fingers and going 'lalala, this doesn't exist.'<br><br>Regardless, Hiko is Kenshin but stronger, faster, and actually willing to kill. He's Kenshin with no weaknesses. That automatically makes him better than every other character.</br></br></br>  <br>Hiko didn't do shit. I rank characters based on what they've done rather than people jerking off over what they "could" do.</br>  Mastered Kenshin+Unrestrained Battousai Blood Hunger=Hiko is dead  <br>The OP question is Hiko Seijuurou the strongest character in the manga. The question is asking about ability, not what he did with said ability so in this case, saying that he could have beaten Shishio is a good statement of his ability.</br>  <br> On a good note, its one of the few samurai mangas thats not about that fucking sengoku period, where the hell can one find any other manga or anime about any samurai period before that? <br><br>But there's a ton of Edo samurai manga. There's even one about a surgeon getting in pre-Meiji Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>Exposing your emotions makes you extremely predictable in the Kenshin universe and Hiko shouldn't have problem dealing with the increased speed/power since he is far more physically fit than Kenshin and knows the style better than Kenshin.</br>  <br>Kenshin was cleaning up a mess he created.</br>  <br>I recall Battousai being extremely cold that added to Kenshin weight being lower than Hiko...wouldn't that give him chance to have the first move?</br>  <br><br>He didn't do shit because there wouldn't tension in the history the only thing that would exist is Hiko power triping on everyone. Also it doesn't matter how you rank the characters, the only canon rank is the one the author gives us.</br></br>  <br>Yeah he was. Soujiro was best swordsman and best boy though.

What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou. <br><br>Good point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if Blackbeard grabbed Luffy while he was in gear 3? Would losing his rubberness with all the air in him cause his limb to explode? Would he be able to hold it together with haki?  <br>Luffy used haki unconsciously to win the final exchange, since he punched through Crocodiles cutting attack which sliced solid rock the previous time it was shown.<br>Same shit happened vs Arlong.<br><br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do you actually believe this?</br>  <br>Because Crocodile second in command Mrs Allsunday was a traitor</br>    <br>Power creep. <br>Don't think too much of it, it happens to every shounen over time.</br></br>    <br>Forgotpic</br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>20/working-with-eiichiro-oda-an-int<wbr>erview-with-one-piece-editor-suguru<wbr>-sugita/<br><br> Well, now that we’re in the second half of the story, I think there will be more and more chapters that revolve around the main plot. The Four Emperors will also appear more in the story, so I think you’ll really enjoy what happens next! </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I'm pretty hype if Fujitora tries to follow his commands. Having both a Warlord and Admiral defeated would be some real shit assuming Luffy and Law can fight the following morning.  <br>Two knocked out novas versus a full health admiral. Yep, def gonna happen.</br>  <br>Fuji is just New World Aokiji<br><br>he'll follow them around lazily but otherwise isnt doing shit</br></br></br>  <br>its stated by territory, right after the war when the gorosei are talking i think. BB was in WBs crew for a long time and knew where all thin freshly unclaimed land would be and had crew that could solo cap an island each so it just happened to go to him</br>  <br>I am saddened when I see these threads and I have no recollection of reading some of these pages ;_;<br><br>Perhaps it's my due time for a re-read</br></br></br>  <br> 30% of the story left <br><br>w-what?? theres still so many unresovled things, I don't want it to end too soon :(</br></br></br>  <br>You can't remember a page from two weeks ago.</br>  <br>that page was literally 2 weeks ago chapter, are you sure you arent a speed reader with alzheimers?</br>  <br>30% ends at chapter 1100 or so.<br><br>It's as far from now as the start of the series from Luffy fighting Lucci.</br></br></br>  <br> the following morning. <br>I think this information alone allows us to deduce Fuji is letting them go.<br>If he wanted them he'd have the marines pick them off the ground as soon as the doffy fight was done.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda or one of his editors said OP was half way done back during the end of Skypeia. I'd take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>I'm just glad the Yonko are going to play a more active role now.</br></br></br>  <br>He is NOT going to come after Luffy/Law. He's saying he's fine with not coming back to Marine HQ.<br><br><br>Because Oda can't break muh monster trio, he's too strong and there are too many crewmembers wah wah wah.<br><br>Same shit you see in these threads all the time. They don't read the series, though so they couldn't know half the shit they spew.<br><br><br>Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one.<br><br><br>Neat. But to be around 70% of the story? Hmm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come people are acting like Vivi isn't already part of the crew. <br>Jinbe could have joined and then went on a solo mission, instead he said "he, ill join later." which is a deathflag or at minimum "some shit will block him from joining" flag.</br></br>  <br>he's going to have some Big Mom conflict but he'll still join. <br><br>He and Luffy are blood-brothers afterall</br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br>Another proof he won't join/will die</br></br>  <br>How much do you think there's left of Berserk?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shieet I somehow missed last week's WSJ release. Well another example is Kuzan/Aokiji's appearance post-timeskip</br></br></br>  <br> Nearly $25million a year <br><br>Holy crap</br></br></br>  <br>Caribou will tell<br> that man <br>That Shirahoshi is Poseidon.<br>That's where Jinbe, strongest fish man in the world (deathflag), will get blocked from ever joining.</br></br></br></br>  Would I be right in saying his reintroduction was ambiguous?<br><br>Capone working for Mam is a boring to me since we already have the yonkou underling dynamic with Drake/Kaidou.<br>I'd much prefer Capone to be striking out alone.<br><br>Why would he be after Ceasar though?<br>Ceasar probably has wares that can be traded on the black market.<br>I think it would be interesting to see Capone make a play for becoming the top Broker...might also suit his namesake since it's a black market vibe.<br>Does this sound like headcannon or a reasonable theory? I can never tell when it's my own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea, miura does what he wants. I just hope the announcement about monthly releases holds up, and we actually do get monthly chapters.</br>  <br>He was on Big Mom's fucking ship.</br>  <br>Sabo seems to be doing just fine though</br>  <br>law said to survive in the new world you either take out a yonko or join a yonko, and no supernova can take them out alone, so I think its fine if he's working for big mom, just makes him a less important character compared to say captain kid. drake is ambiguous, he might join luffy/law</br>  <br>Sabo has more deathflags than any other character in One Piece.<br><br>He even did and said the exact same things Ace did before he died almost word for word, and Zoro explicitly commented on this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Caribou tells Kizaru?<br>Think about it, Kizaru killed the sun pirates. Kizaru is Proven 100% loyal to tenryubito, and the tenryubito are actively trying to acquire the ancient weapons as Proven at water 7<br>Jinbe vs Kizaru means no Jinbe cremate</br></br></br>  <br> He was on <br>near, He was NEAR Big Mom's ship</br></br>  <br><br>Which translation is this.<br>Seems decent.</br></br></br>  <br>that's assuming they actually parallel 100%<br><br>I doubt they do. It'd make no sense to replace Ace only to kill him off as well</br></br></br>  <br>He was on big mom's ship. You can see the fucking candy canes.</br>  <br>I guess you forgot CP0 was on Dressrosa at the same time as Sabo and the obvious possibility that Koala is an agent.<br>No one guessed Blueno the bartender was a spy either.</br></br>  <br> stripes are candycane <br><br>anon...</br></br></br>  <br>You're in fucking denial of something that was explicitly shown so it fits your fanfiction better, and you're trying to be the bigger person here?</br>  <br>that's some wild speculating you're doing there</br>  <br> obvious possibility that Koala is an agent. <br><br>With such amazing evidence as....</br></br></br>  <br>prove its candy cane then and not just stripes?</br>  <br>It is speculation that Koala is a spy.<br>It is a fact that every reader was surprised when CP9 was unmasked, and will be when CP0 is too.<br>Sorry if that offends you</br></br></br>  <br>these two things arent linked because you type them together, m8<br><br>no idea what you're getting worked up over. If you actually have proof, i'd love to see it and enjoy it with you<br><br>im not down for defending headcanons to the death because ive become attached to them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If this was an MMO, what stats would the straw hat have on it?<br> Luck +5 <br> str +1 <br> hidden skill : will of the D enhancement. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me get this straight, your argument is<br><br>  "It was surprising when CP9 was unmasked",  <br> "It will be surprising when CP0 is unmasked", <br>  "It would be surprising if Koala was CP0" <br>  "QED, Koala is CP0" <br><br>I really hope I don't need to explain why this is insane.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if you dont get the straw hats head, you cant ever return <br> Just what I wanted to hear! <br>It means that he wanted any excuse to cause this big shit fuck and then leave the marines.</br></br></br>  <br>The only surprising member of CP9 was Kaku, because he was tied with Paulie for who people thought would join the crew.</br>  <br><br>Wow you are retarded, I'm not arguing that Koala IS an agent, we don't know.<br>I'm arguing she potentially is, since we have no idea who they are but water 7 taught us we most likely have already seen them.<br><br>I'm not sure how to make it easier to understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo the second in command of the revolutionary army would not be targeted by WG and intelligence agencies wouldn't try and infiltrate it <br>Is this really your argument?<br>I mean since we are going to misrepresent each other and all</br></br></br>  <br>That means literally anybody we have seen before can be CP0</br>  <br>Lol it was pretty obvious they weren't good guys.</br>  <br>By that logic, every single fucking character in the manga is a potential CP0 agent.</br>  <br>what you're arguing is that Koala is secretly a mermaid because no was expecting Kokoro to be a mermaid<br><br>you're an idiot who can argue whatever you want to argue but if you don't even have any solid basing for your claims, you need to expect to be laughed at</br></br></br>  <br>blueno the 1 panel bartender vs koala the ex slave, gvmnt-hating revolutionary agent<br>good comparison there</br></br>  <br>  I'm not arguing that Koala IS an agent,  <br> I'm arguing she potentially is, <br>  since we have no idea who they are <br><br>Make up your mind already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> water 7 taught us we most likely have already seen them <br>What. Why must CP0 be the same as CP9? because CP1-8 also did that, right?</br></br>  <br>tobi was obito</br>  <br>I said nothing like that and you know it<br><br>you're running purely on speculation and getting pissed when people point out how stupid you're being</br></br></br>    <br>The hilarious part about that is that this twist was SO obvious the entire reason people started doubting it was because it was just too fucking obvious so it couldn't be true.</br>  <br>Anybody close to the second in command of the revolutionary army.<br>Not anybody we've seen. All the CP9 agents were close friends with their assassination target.<br><br>you are falsely telling me what I am arguing. I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members of the same organization as Iceberg, not "anyone we've seen."</br></br></br></br>  <br>By your logic, even Fuji might be a CP0 member. muh surprise. Or even the king of the dwarves!<br><br>In simples manner, it's not really possible for Koala because she's too short (and don't try that whole midgets in overcoat shit.</br></br></br>  <br> . I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members <br><br>To put it another way "I'm not saying Koala is a spy, but she totally is". I'm not sure if you legitimately think you're saying something different, but that's what you're fucking typing dude.</br></br></br>  <br> just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did <br><br>you can replace Koala with literally any other name and nothing would change</br></br></br>  <br> an infiltrator in Dragons army wouldn't need a good back story. <br><br> koalatellingsaboitsgoodhedidntsave<wbr>ace.Png </wbr> <br>Anyway my argument is that Sabo has death flags, good derail by focusing on koala who I mentioned as hypothetical example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who I mentioned as hypothetical example. <br><br>that's your own fault though. Your theory holds no water either way</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu Gomu no Autism!</br>  <br>No my logic explicitly excludes them because they are not close with Sabo in any way, having met him less than 24 hours ago in canon, whereas my logic requires they were close to Sabo for years and years like how kaku and friends stayed with iceberg for like a decade.</br>  <br>My god<br><br>Luffy is a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br>Its completely feasible as it mirrors CP9 being long time friends and subordinates of their assassination target.<br>You are arguing that it is unfeasible even though it was the water 7 saga</br></br>  <br>Except we know he is not.<br>You are either just being antagonistic or very dumb.<br>Luffy hasn't talked to Sabo before today in story since he was like 6 years old, so it violates the logic, as well.</br></br></br>  watch this retard be right, and koala turns out to be a cp0 agent.<br><br>post YFW</br></br>  <br> Except we know he is not. <br><br>That's why it's proof, because it was surprising when the CP9 agents were revealed, and it would be surprising if Luffy was revealed as a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br> mirrors <br>prove that it's a mirror or even happening right now?<br><br>you have no clue IF CP0 is after Sabo in particular or someone we havent even seen yet<br><br>you're just assumin because they're in the general area that they must be linked when Dressrosa introduced something like 30 characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why Sabo? The CP0 were said to have been mobilized to take out Doffy. Shouldn't they be close to him then?<br>Plus, why do you think Oda will follow the same approach to CP0 as he did with CP9. Such blatant repetition just isn't his style. There's a better chance CP0 will be handled nothing like the 9 so all conjectures based on it are potentially a waste.</br></br>  <br> That's why it's proof, because it was surprising </br>  <br><br>She won't be she's the girl fisher tiger rescued. She'd never work for the CDs</br></br>  <br> being the is much of a troll <br>I just feel bad for you at this point.<br>The only CP9 agent who wasn't working for iceberg and also his good friend of many years was Spandam.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not proof, it is well reasoned speculation based on the known modes operandi of another in canon branch of the WG.<br>It could easily be wrong, but it is not "wild speculation," which was the initial criticism.</br></br>  <br>And Jyabura. And Fukuro. And Kumadori.<br><br>Does Nero count too, even though nobody remembers him?</br></br></br>  <br> CP0 is Koala and Hack <br> CP0 is all of Dragon's subordinates <br> Dragon is the CP0 boss <br> they're all conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary </br></br></br></br>  <br> Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one. <br><br>Marfineford and Dressrosa were both just giant arcs about a bunch of new characters fighting each other with minimal character development for the Straw Hats. It makes sense they'd like Dressrosa.</br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UK<wbr>8-wh-oLp4</wbr>  [ ] <br> tfw Roci's voice is manlier than Doffy's </br>  <br>So some agents weren't, this doesn't affect the veracity of my speculation though because the means of assassination primarily relied on the members who were friends with Iceberg.<br><br>It is a reasonable speculation I'm not sure why you are so aggressively attacking it with fallacy.</br></br></br>  <br> well reasoned <br><br>You seriously call something with no evidence whatsoever 'well-reasoned'.<br><br>Literally the only support for your argument is that it would resemble what happened in Water7. For fuck's sake, you don't even have any evidence that there's more than the three agents we already saw in CP0, that they've infiltrated the revolutionaries (who nobody knew was on the island), that Koala is one of them, why Koala would have stayed behind if she was one of them when they were explicitly stated in the last chapter to have completely left the island, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it is well reasoned speculation <br> Koala might be CP0 <br> because she works with Sabo <br> who the CP0 were obviously around to apprehend <br> because of COURSE Sabo is being doublecrossed <br> because he's deathflagged <br> because he's Luffy's brother </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I state that ALL of galley la were infiltrators?</br>  <br>Because it's not reasonable, it's insane. You have no proof, nothing other than 'parallels', without even any evidence to suggest that the series is following parallels, that the parallels apply in this instance, why they specifically apply to Koala instead of, say, Hack, or anything at all. There's absolutely nothing supporting a single thing you're saying, and the fact that you don't seem to grasp this. The fact that you repeatedly and consistently are getting details of the story wrong is also not helping.</br>  <br>There is substantial evidence that Oda heavily mirrored Alabasta in Dressrosa, though. And he set up a spy agency involvement for the next saga and also revealed Sabo as the #2 rev, had Sabo say the same shit as ace when he left Alabasta as well</br>  <br>my bad<br><br> CP0 is MOST of Dragon's subordinates(not all because then it wouldn't be a perfect mirror!) <br><br> they're MOSTLY conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary(not all of them. Bunny Joe is cool) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora for next Strawhat</br>  <br> a correlation exists <br> therefore, a trend exists and will continue <br><br>You realize Ace was killed by Blackbeard and the Marine, right? And that CP9 had nothing to do with this? So by the 'muh parallels' logic CP0 should also have nothing to do with Sabo?</br></br></br></br>    <br>You keep putting words in my mouth.<br>I did not clack Dressrosa was a perfect mirror of Alabasta.<br>I did not claim that most of the revolutionary army are spies for WG.<br>I did not claim that "most" of São's underlings will betray him.<br><br>Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You keep putting words in my mouth. <br>YOU asked me to elaborate<br><br> Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim. <br><br>has nothing to do with CP0. Not a thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait holy shit</br>  <br>You are still relying on straw man after straw man. You realize that Laffite was in talks with WG shown on panel at the shichibukai meeting before Ace was killed and that Teach was Ace's crew mate for years and years before he back stabbed his friend Thatch, right?</br>  <br>then fucking talk to me asshole i'm bored</br>  <br>how's the wife?</br>  <br>There's literally a watermark anon.</br>  <br><br>Was Fujitora always blind from birth or did he get blinded in both eyes by the [swordsman?] who gave him that scar?</br></br>  <br>It's likely we'll learn of Fujitoras past in Wano.</br>  <br>Seems stupid for Ceasar to be valuable in the black market.<br><br>All he has is his bounty or whatever Big Mom's willing to pay. Not everyone can give him an island and the chemicals for Cesar to make SMILES for them. Unless Oda really wants Big Mom and Kaido to fight, Ceasar is not that important and I don't believe Capone has any interest in him besides obeying someone else's orders.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that he built a nuke BEFORE he had smiles or any real supplies? Dude is still the second smartest character introduced after vegapunk, even without a lab. Plus Big Mom and Kaido seem like the two people most likely to be able to actually give him the stuff he needs. Which isn't to say that Capone isn't working for Big Mom, he probably is.</br>  Was Doffy Tsuru's boytoy?  <br>Have they ever met or interacted at any point in the story?</br>  <br>I want speedreaders to leave</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot, they met once right after Croc was deposed.<br><br>Still a weird as shit pairing</br></br></br>  <br> animefags </br>    <br>She also pursued his crew during Law's flashback. Do you even read, anon?</br>  <br>Still not entirely correct, stop being a speedreader.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, look at these panel layouts and posing. I completely forgot how awesome these were. What happened? All of New World feels so flat and simple compared to this...</br>  <br>This. That water weakness reveal. Such an epic fight. Such a page turner. AAAAHHH.</br>  <br>I forgot about that too, although in fairness to me they never were actually shown interacting.</br>  <br>I disagree, I'd say his crew treats him way more as a captain this arc. They always asked his permission to do things. Franky with the dwarves, Sanji with Big Mom.<br><br>Stop being a powerlevel fag that thinks character development = fighting skill.<br><br>The only true disappointing fight was Diamante, and maybe Burgess. Even Picas actions were on par with his character because in the chapter we learned about his voice, Doffy told him the battle would decide who would be king, that's why he targeted King Riki and challenged his ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is tsuru his aunt?</br>  Who else should i add to this?  Vizanon is MIA  <br> Kuma <br> Croc <br> abandoned <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>Kuma will never be explained.</br>  Does anyone else feel like Kaido is a good guy? Or at least a fallen good guy like one of those Raoh/Toguro scenarios?<br><br>I think him, Rogers, and Raleigh are like Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy. They've already shown Shanks can look like a devil to other pirates that don't know him.</br></br>  <br> Oda is still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. <br>Oda goddammit, stop it. Wasn't the entire point of his last hiatus so he could get out of that habit?</br></br>  <br> kuma <br> crocodile <br> roger <br>roger is dead and still we get the flashbacks of him from rayleigh <br>croco has been shown a lot throughout the series and he is still a prominent character<br>kuma is the same</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him needs an explanation?</br>  <br>You are kidding, right?</br>  <br>What's the Sanji abandoned plotline? <br><br>And how is Morgan still relevant? <br><br>Also what's abandoned about Kuma and Croc?<br><br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely all high tier pirates are devils to their enemies.</br>  <br>For being the wise man he is it surprises me that he's previously so unable to see the pure goodness in Luffy, despite his being a pirate.</br>  <br>Alvida.</br>  <br>The guy with speed and claws from ussop island</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Is with Buggy</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I get the feeling that all the yonko are chill and only have skirmishes for appearances <br><br>Hell Big Mom is probably really reasonable besides the people eating thing. Kaido may just be a big friendly gorilla who happens to like fisticuffs</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because he's too strong in the water that he's waiting so long to let him join. If he just let someone as strong as Luffy join off the bat it'd break his Luffy fighting the main villian every arc since Jinbe could crush them.<br><br>As for Akainu I agree, him and Kinnemon are probably the only ones who could beat Akainu with their skills, Kinnemon being with firesealing. (Unless they say fuck it and just like Zoro damage him with Haki like they did with Marco)</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy. <br> the first time we see what the grand line is all about is not worth remembering <br> the first time zoro shows his devotion to luffy is not worth remembering  <br> fucking roger is not worth remembering </br></br></br></br>  <br>Morgan not being relevant is the point.<br>Kuma's whole deal with the marines is never explained, along with his entire backstory.<br>I added crocodile as a bonus hilarious joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kumas backstory will come during the revolutionary arc or the Vegapunk arc, be patient anon</br>  <br>To be honest, I kind of feel like Fujitora is going to join. If not now than later.<br><br>I only say that because if Aokij joined blackbeard, it's only fair that the rivaling crews both get an ex marine. <br><br>(I'm still hoping Hajrudin is next strawhat)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What we know:<br>Kuma is a warrior priest for the revolutionary army.<br>Kuma apparently made a trade accepting brain death and use as a WG Weapon as the cost.<br>Dragon allowed this.<br>Anon it just doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haki was an asspull later in the series and you know it. He just kind of said "Okay, the seamonster Shanks intimidated and the listening ability on Sky Island is part of this new system I'm introducing. Everyone accept it because it was there all along"</br>  <br><br>It was obvious that something like haki had to exist. There's no way you can let logias run around unchecked like that and have people like shanks be remarkable without some type of ability.</br></br>  <br>It's ok because Oda is the king of asspulls.<br><br>Eg: This guys was invented to explain how the door higuma kicks off in the 1st chapter is repaired a few pages later. He is a carpenter who cannot let any building go unrepaired.</br></br></br>    Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world. The first is Benn Beckman. Kuro will return.    <br>That's Roger? I never watched the Anime. He looks nothing like he does in the manga.<br><br>Who is the purple haired faggot though? I want to say Don Krieg but I pictured him differently as well. Plus there's no reason for him to be relevant either.</br></br></br>  <br>CP0<br>Big Mom<br>Bartolomeo's BIG SUITCASE <br>Sabo<br>Koal's it'd be dangerous to luffy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't tell Kuma that they'd be replacing his brain, he joined the shichibukai as a spy, agreed to become a weapon for reasons that aren't explicitly stated but easily guessable (get stronger/get more info, etc), and then had the deal altered to destroy his brain when he couldn't disobey</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4983818/<br>Which saga is the best?</br>  <br>What if he's a member of CP 1-8</br>  <br> my master plan <br> pretend to be a butler for years <br> to have a chance at some small town hick girl's money <br> instead of just killing her, forging a few documents and taking the money </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I figured as much. But it still seems lazy to introduce it so much later in the series.<br><br>Maybe he could have done a system where the fruit users had to take eachother out or something where they have to figure out clever ways to hurt the Logia like Luffy did with Crocodile.<br><br>Frankie beams Blackbeard and GG. Jinbei waterlogs Akainu. Kizamuro is beaten by mirrors or something. Fuck if I know. I didn't think it'd just turn to Dragonballz where strongest wins instead of figure out how to beat the opponents.<br><br>Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that intelligence list was created during east blue when there were like 30 characters. Vegapunk is likely the smartest man in the world. And Benn Beckman is more "wise" than "smart."</br>  <br> if they used bullshit made up on the spot and never mentioned again to win fights it would be jjjba <br><br>I'm sure you meant to say that.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they only wear the mask when they can be recognized by their target. They wore masks on Dressrosa, but Doffy talked to the leader after Marineford and he was unmasked, proving this.</br>  <br> Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure. <br><br>You whine about asspulls, yet use Jojo as a comparison?</br></br></br>  <br>kuro Is the name</br>  <br>We don't have any clue if the guy Doffy talked to was related to CP0. They wore similar hats and that's about it.</br>  <br>Oda was an assistant on Kenshin so you'd have to be retarded to believe he didn't plan haki all along and foreshadow and even use it under varying names before he revealed it to the protagonist.</br>  <br>best movie right here</br>  <br> Haki was an asspull </br>  <br><br>Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better.</br></br>  <br> abondened plot <br> One Piece </br></br>  <br>Gears after 2 and Haki weren't introduced on the spot, and the author actually remembers that they exist and how they work, so yes, it's way better than JJBA. Awakening is too early to tell, but if it's never mentioned again then it will be tied with JJBA, which does the same goddamn thing more than once.</br>  <br>the explain the florian triangle monsters</br>  <br>According to a letter send from Miura to SK forums, we are at the 70% of the story.</br>  <br>Dressrosa was more about the plight and danger of the country itself, I feel.</br>  <br>this was a plot? when?</br>  <br>Ok. Please adopt a trip.<br>Doflamingo commanded Pacifista when he attempted to assassinate Moira for someone "higher up" than Sengoku.<br>Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed.<br>Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command.<br> Doffy carrying out assassination of Shichibukai for WG. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening has already been mentioned a few times. Chopper awakened his fruit every time he goes monster mode.</br>  <br>since it was now</br>  <br>just drawn to make the background look eery</br>  <br> don't hear of haki until 500+ chapters in <br> everyone and there dog has it now <br> expects us to believe people like Shanks, Crocodile, Ace, Arlong, Buggy, any of the CP9, Garp, anyone in Alabasta, any of the marines like smoker, anyone on Sky Island despite already having Mantra, or anyone else for that matter used Haki other than possibly Shanks and the listening haki on Sky Island despite alot of them being in legendary groups like Roger's crew, Fisher Tiger's crew, white beard's crew <br><br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing is ever abandoned in OP, even the gaimon and sarfunkel gag took 600 chapters to be revealed</br>  <br>Introducing a huge threat and mystery and then ignoring it is abandoning a potential plot line.</br>  <br>That's nowhere near enough to say that they're the same person, because, again, the only connection between the two is 'similar hat'.</br>  Reminder that this is the reason why Doflamingo is deathly afraid of Tsuru.  <br>it was not an asspull simply because it was already introduced in Skypia</br>  <br> Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better. <br><br>That you're stupidly comparing haki to DBZ is retarded enough, but you're compounding your stupidity by using the 'Jojo card' while assuming that OP and Jojo fanbases are so far removed, that someone wouldn't notice this, it does nothing but make you look like a complete faggot. <br><br>If you just want to man up now and admit that you were spouting bullshit and bating to cover up for the fact you didn't know what the fuck you're talking about, feel free to.<br><br>That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed. <br> Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command. <br><br>If anything, this seems to indicate they're different people, because the first guy wants to know why Doffy didn't follow orders, while the second guy is following Doffy's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>potential means it never was a real plot line</br>  <br>It is if no one has it or knows it by name and now everyone has it and knows it by name including previous characters who didn't even reference or use it. If Shanks knocked out the bandits, then it wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br>Alabasta had a war between its own citizens orchestrated by Baroque Works.<br><br>The civil war occurred before Luffy defeated Crocodile. Don't you remember Vivi almost averted it but infiltrators in her royal army shot Koza?<br><br>It was much more dramatic and realistic than the birdcage and the fighting continued for a little even after Luffy made it rain by KOing Crocodile. Vivi screamed and screamed finally ending it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB referred to haki by name in Jaya. He even said that he was surprised how small Luffy's bounty was when his haki was so powerful.</br>  <br>I was comparing the fact that they made people go from shit like Rubber man, Chopchop man, Slipman, etc as the main fighting style to WHO IS THE STRONGEST to dragonballz. You can't say it isn't. It's no different than when Yuyu hakashu got rid of psychic style fighting to just see who has the strongest powerlevels.</br>  <br>Morgan is done, he showed up in Coby's story and again in Django's. There's no reasonable way for him to be relevant again<br><br>Only character's Oda has ditched are Kuro and his cat underlings, all the Krieg pirates, Chessmarimo and Enel's priests. You could include Foxy but he's exactly the kind of gag villain Oda loves and I'm sure he'll find a way back. Everyone else has gotten some kind of callback or reference.</br></br></br>  <br> That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid. <br><br>This.<br><br>Even Luffy 'solution' to G4's weakness of just pumping Gear 3rd into it screams like some shit Luffy would do, which what makes it fucking hilarious this is what finished Doffy off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, but she's quite old so she's not likely to be a threat other than her fruit.</br>  <br>Is Nen an asspull because Kite didn't use it in chapter 1 to save Gon?</br>  <br>Jokes are boring if retold. Foxy won't come back</br>  <br>You realize that Gear 4 just turns Luffy into a giant rubber ball, right? How is that not rubberman powers?</br>  <br>Yea the thing is you are wrong they are "both" directly tied to Doffy and work in a high up WG position.<br>Which means it is pretty likely the same person in a canon where non navy hats are mostly unique and the main character literally is called by the hat he wears.</br></br>  <br>He used haki as "willpower" there. He was referring to Luffy just taking a beating from Bellamy and still believing in Skypeia.</br>  <br> she's not a threat if you take out what's threatening about her <br>are you okay anon</br></br>  <br>Because Zoro can ships and mountains in half.</br>  <br>Mihawk did that in chapter 40something</br>  <br>It is, but for other reasons.<br>I still somehow like it.</br></br>  <br>Not him but he also referred to it in Impel Down</br>  <br> it's an asspull if you disregard all the things that doesn't make it an asspull !!!!!!! </br>  <br>I figured the second mate of Krieg that Sanji fought would eventually make a name for himself and fight Sanji like they promised ;_;</br>  <br>That's the reason it got lost in translations, but the word "haki" IS used.</br>  <br> You can't say it isn't. <br>It isn't. It is still completely possible that a fruit user can beat a strong haki user. See Law vs Vergo. Luffy vs Doffy also was not decided by who had the strongest haki or anything like that. There are no powerlevels in One Piece, period.</br></br>  <br><br> asspull <br> introduced in the very first chapter <br><br>Yeah... about that....</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said 500 plus chapters</br>  <br>nottothisoshittoagain.jpg</br>  <br>It was first explicitly mentioned and used when Shanks knocked everybody out on WB's crew in 434.</br>  <br><br>Seems pretty obvious to me that they're the same. Doffy "followed" orders, but he also didn't give a shit about the repercussions of not completing them or talking back. They followed his orders on Dressrosa because he's blackmailing them<br><br>Not to jump on you two in particular but I really hate this small subset of fans who refuse to believe anything until its stated literally in the manga. Sabo was alive, Kuzan was with Blackbeard, this guy is CP0, Capone is by all the evidence we have on Big Mom's ship. Why ignore the information given because "it might not be"?</br></br></br></br>  <br> See Law vs Vergo. <br><br>Law used haki to defeat Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's not proven to be true.</br>  <br>I'm sure if they introduce Stands next chapter, then within 50 chapters everyone has them and Oda tries to say he already did stands at one point and it's what makes Sanji's legs hot, you'd try to justify it as not an asspull.</br>  <br><br>We already know what makes Sanji's legs hot, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he get poisoned saving Sanji's life?<br><br>Plus I just don't see Krieg attempting to go through the Grand line after getting his ass kicked by Mihawk twice, then by Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Oda can find a way to make it internally consistent and not contradict anything in the story, then it's not an asspull. Do you think an asspull just means 'a new power is introduced'?</br>  <br>Okay. 434 chapters is when it actually comes into existence which is still a long fucking time and an asspull. My bad. It wasn't really explained until Shabondy though around 500 chapters in.</br>  <br> Lucky Roo fast steps so fast in the panels it is like he fucking teleported when he shoots bandit. <br>For years people speculate Roo as fastest in the world.<br>The first Haki shown was CoO, it is how Shanks found Luffy.<br>The second is CoC, when Shanks glares at a sea monster and it runs away. You should swim in central CA pacific and give a great white shark a "intimidating stare" if you think that was not haki.</br></br></br></br>  The fact Luffy mentioned that Garp could hurt him even though he's rubber multiple times was an indicator of CoA haki early on.  <br><br>No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it.</br></br>  <br>Just because something isn't explicitly introduced in chapter 1 doesn't make it an asspull. All haki does is take a bunch of pre-existing powers that weren't explained and give them one. That's not an asspull, it's not even a retcon,</br>  <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and purposefully hides his frontside <br> 120 chapters later <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and shows his frontside <br> its somehow not the same guy <br>I appreciate a skeptic but c'mon.

Toriyama failed to marry the woman who made Sailor Moon. Score one for Togashi.  <br> Being togashi is easy <br><br>Treats shueisha like shit over YYH which is fine with me but he also treats his fans like shit so I don't think it really is suffering if maybe he actually made a chapter every once and awhile the it could be<br><br>Not saying his manga is bad but what he does is also shitty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes on both accounts</br>  <br><br>By far.</br></br>  <br> Over shadowed by DBZs popularity <br><br>Wait, I remember reading that YYH was popular enough that Kurama was more popular than Goku in character polls.</br></br></br>  He clearly lost interest in being a mangaka over time. <br><br>HxH is more than popular enough to be worth the effort, yet he doesn't bother.</br></br>  This is a shit show  <br>Yes, yusuke is a demon</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wHr<wbr>5O5QLTVc</wbr>  [ ]<br>tfw</br>  <br> Kuwabara <br> beating anyone <br><br>He can barely beat people in his own series.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>not canon</br></br>  <br>asspulls, plot armor, desu ex machina, bullshit all around, Yu Yu Hakusho was the worst kind of battle shounen you fucking retard.</br>  <br>HxH is popular because of DQ, particularly how he turned Shonen ki attacks into a JRPG-like fighting system.</br>  <br> demon who could, at most, destroy mountains <br> Goku is now capable of taking out galaxies <br><br>Anon, pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>YYH doesn't need a remake and there's barely any filler in the series</br>  <br> galaxies <br>source?</br></br>  <br>power of fujoshi</br>  <br>If it was superior then it wouldn't have been overshadowed isn't?</br>  <br>Saint Seiya owns both of these anime</br>  <br>He took out the guy who could destroy galaxies, of course.

That doesn't make him a galaxy buster. And just because Goku beat him, that doesn't make Goku a galaxy buster, even if Buu was a galaxy buster.</br>  <br>Is the manga any good?

It's been a while since I watched BoG</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Buu didn't take out galaxies.

There's only 4 galaxies in the Dragonball universe.</br></br>  Beerus is a Galaxy Buster but Goku didn't beat him.  <br> mfw those 4 galaxies are just the local group <br> mfw there's a ton of other galaxies with fighters all as strong as Goku <br> mfw DB gets retconned again for even higher power levels </br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a map of the Dragonball universe. It's a lot smaller than ours.</br></br>  <br>A map of the known Dragon Ball universe. It would be simple to draw more galaxies just past the edge of the map. Or retcon it, whichever works. It's Toriyama, after all.</br>  <br><br>Still has nothing to do with the discussion, though. There's no galaxy busting in DB.</br></br>  <br>I'm just making a prediction for where DBS might go.

Yusuke x Keiko OTP  <br> &gt;Sexualizes little boys and glorifies a pedophile <br> implying this is bad </br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, okay. Show me the page where Buu is blowing up any planet other than Earth. Oh wait, you can't. Guess you better shut the fuck up then.</br></br>  <br> Was it? It's been a while since I watched BoG <br> debating when you're not even sure <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he also took out a guy that could absorb people, can he do that too?</br>  <br> Necroing a dead debate <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>When Buu blew up the Earth Goku said the blast was strong enough to blow up the earth ten times over.</br>  <br> he also took out a guy that could absorb people <br>Who did?</br></br>  <br> defended by pedos. <br><br>Kill Togashi</br></br></br>  <br>That was english dub never mentioned in the manga.</br>  <br><br>No he didn't.<br><br> using dub dialogue when talking about the manga </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because the more overrated DBZ is the more powerful Goku gets, so basically, By that standard Goku is invincible</br>  <br> glorifies a pedophile <br><br>Hisoka?</br></br></br>  <br> not being able to appreciate shotas <br>I can only pity you anon.</br></br>  <br><br>Duh. It is stated that Buu destroyed Galaxies in only two years. It is obvious that he one-shotted a galaxy because he wouldn't be able to destroy a galaxy in a few years if he went from planet to planet.</br></br>  <br><br> Duh. It is stated that Buu destroyed Galaxies in only two years. <br><br>No it isn't. That's not stated anywhere in the manga.</br></br></br></br>   NOT JOJO   <br> can destroy a planet in seconds <br> is really fucking fast <br> time in DBZ is fucked <br>He could easily destroy a galaxy in two years going from planet to planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was anime kid buu that did that destroying the galaxy over a few years never in the manga while he didn't one shot he practically destroyed planets and stars that was there.</br>  <br> you didn't read the manga! <br> all of his information is from the english dub <br><br>Could you be more retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i guess technically gohan did, but either way it was just to show how stupid it is saying just because someone beat someone that can do something means they can do it too</br>  YYH would have been GOAT if Togashi didn't fuck up the last arc like that.  <br><br>He got tired of Jump's bullshit.</br></br>  <br> YYH would have been GOAT <br>Nah still would have been shit.</br></br>  <br> Raoh and Toki <br>I think there were better fights in the series</br></br>  to be fair one piece is actually really good. dbz a shit  <br>So he's a galaxy destroyer.</br>  <br>Destroying every planet in a galaxy one by one is not the same as being a galaxy buster</br>   &gt;Over shadowed by DBZs popularity <br>No.</br>  <br>You mean the one show where death meant even less than DB?<br><br>After watching lass than half of it, when people "died" in that show, I no longer wondered if they were coming back, but how. All the emotional squeezing over the "death" of whoever's turn it was was extremely lame when you just knew it wasn't going to stick.</br></br></br>  <br>But HnK, Ashita no Joe, and Space Adventure Cobra are all better</br>  <br>Didn't it surpass DBZ in ratings though?<br><br><br>Yusuke couldn't even beat Tien.<br><br><br>Kuwabara is the Krillin of YYH and couldn't even beat Yamcha.<br><br><br>This kind of logic and thought I'd expect from the youtube comments section or deviantart, not /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soul Eater sucked though.</br>  <br>Reminder that Dark Tournament was the peak. Chapter Black could have been good but they introduced demon powerlevels and the whole thing went to shit. <br> Toguro is only a B class shitter <br>Fuck off Togashi.</br></br></br>  <br> Let's discuss why YuYu Hakusho is the best shounen <br><br>But it's not.</br></br></br>  <br> Being Togashi is suffering <br><br>i dont think he gives a fuck, he'd be rolling in bank and drinking your tears either way.</br></br></br>  <br> demons are a totally unique concept to YYH </br>  <br>Both of works were overshadowed due to him being a lazy prick and refusing to work on them.</br>  <br>B-b-but it's from my favorite series I grew up with so it's okay.</br>  <br>Let's discuss how YYH nostalgiafags are insufferable cunts that can't stop pushing their shit down our throats.</br>  <br>And goku is literally a fucking god</br>  <br>God is a meaningless title.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>But Ainz started the game as a skeleton, he doesn't need any items to change.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>He was just a weak skelly in a tattered robe, he could've taken up a curved sword and maybe be one of those spooky pirates.

Despite having a good size kill count, Accelerator never wanted to kill anyone- thug, clone, or even bad guy. But considering his history he probably wouldn't feel he has the right to say anything. I expect Hamazura would be more of the same except dialed down. And yes, I am surprised Misaka isn't weirded out.</br>  <br>It's like that outfit was made for him.</br>  <br><br> They are running from an immortal nigger that she can't kill no matter what she does, she can't blame him for pulling some extreme shit.</br></br>  <br>Im not saying that she should blame him but it is a little weird she wasn't weirded out, especially when he called her out for thinking extreme things</br>    Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128316<wbr>377/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some book that you read in grade/middle school and like. <br>You might have to buy them online though, since they probably won't be scanned.</br></br>  <br><br>what kind of books anon?</br></br>  <br>Because you don't learn to write.<br>Forget about other anons said about skipping writing.
