[  Precure thread   Mana is love.  Fuck Mana.  <br>気になる is referring to us, the fans. We're 気になる about the nickname. Second, ムムムム is the sound of Kirara and Towa staring at each other.</br>  <br>With pleasure.</br>  I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>In your dreams, loser.</br>  <br> 気になる is referring to us, the fans. We're 気になる about the nickname. <br>I don't agree, I think the guy got it right. Towa's concerned about her nickname.</br></br>  <br>No, listen. Towa doesn't understand the concept of a nickname. The joke is her basically calling Kirara an idiot for repeating her name twice.</br>  <br>No shit, that's what I said. SHe's concerned about her nickname, which she doesn't understand. She's concerned about being called TowaTowa.</br>  Some new spoilers:<br><br> Episode 24 <br> no new info <br><br> Episode 25 <br> Once the closing ceremony is over, it's finally summer break at Noble Academy! (...) Minami gently gets close to a quite confused Towa. <br><br> (...) They enter the hot-springs, eat and enjoy nagashisoumen, and Towa has a nightmare while napping. <br><br> Episode 26 <br> Towa collapses due to a cold when there's no one else around in the dormitory. As Pafu and Aroma try their best to nurse her, Shut appears with a Zetsuborg... <br><br> Episode 27 <br> (...) Haruka and the others will wear yukata (...). <br><br>Previous spoilers are       .

Unprecure!</br></br>    <br>It'll cut to Towa's nightmare as they enter.</br>  <br>What kind of towel burka will they wear to avoid alarming the soccermoms?</br>  <br> Minami Towa episode <br>I guess technically Haruharu has already had an episode and a half with Towa.</br></br>  Is there any anime/manga that depicts its characters as less than perfect physical beings? For example, characters:<br><br> With acne <br> Messed up clothes/shirt untucked after running or fighting <br> Bad hair day <br> Facial feature that makes them stick out like a big nose or monkey ears <br> Fat/chubby <br> Clothes that are too baggy/tight <br> Body parts that are embarassing, like a big ass or puffy nipples on a man or no ass and pancake boobs on a girl <br><br>etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You have some pretty messed up fetishes, OP.  Yes  <br>Accel World has this fat MC if you want</br>  <br>Anime has given me unfair expectations for real life, and I judge myself very harshly as a result. I just wanted to watch something that didn't make me feel like a huge loser when it was over.</br>  <br>Everyone was disgusting and terrible in their own way, but it was great because they felt very humanｽﾓ</br>  What's the best way to describe this MC?  BOOOOOOOOORING  With words and accompanying images.  <br>Sounds like a plan.</br>  generic as fuck  <br><br><br>b-but he's kind!</br></br></br>  Why do some anime guys wear hair clips? It makes them look girly.  <br>Dull. What little anything he had, not a typo, he lost it after the one-shot. <br> He is most generic son of yakuza that person could ever write about. It pains me to think about the moment the Editor told the author &gt;Wouldn't it be better if had no skills so that the losers that read this can relate better?<br> Good thing I am not an Otter, I dropped this like a sack of bricks once I was sure nothing new was happening ever.  So roughly at the beginning </br></br></br>  indecisive beta    <br>He does have a skill though, just one. Cooking.</br>  <br><br> That's worst that nothing, that's the ONE skill all Harem main share for some fucking reason. I didn't remember if he did, and I was still sure he had it. Needless to say, knowing that I still said he got nothing.</br></br>  "plot device"  <br><br>So does he ever stop to consider the other girls around him, or is just obsessed with one girl, on top of does he have anything cooking for aside cooking?</br></br>  Ichika 2.0  He's dense <br><br> But he's kind of cute and I like him. I think he's a good guy </br></br>  Literally retarded.  probably a closet homo  <br> FUNGYOAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?</wbr></wbr> </br>  EH NANDATTE  <br>If your referencing Kodaka that guy actually knew what was going on around him with the girls.<br><br>Raku however is showing extreme levels of autism.</br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi has a certified best girl whereas Hanagai didn't so I didn't care for that ending</br>  <br>blind as fuck</br>  <br> Y-yasashii </br>  New chapter has him being forced to think about the girls around him, so it'll become irrelevant again in the next few weeks.  Faggot  <br>stupid</br>  <br>Densest human being ever.</br>  Pretty cool guy but a huge baka.  <br>Good kid with a good heart but dense enough to make a supermassive black hole jealous <br><br> and the hairclip makes him look just a tad bit gay </br></br></br>  <br>a jelly maker<br>anons are the ingredient and they whine about it</br></br>  <br>Real piece of shit. His character is inconsistent as fuck</br>  <br>I haven't watched that, but I do know that harem leads are usually either dull and annoyingly dense or behave like a disgusting perverted pig. There is no inbetween.</br>  <br>a fukn asswipe</br>  Literally cuckolding himself with his own social retardation  <br>"Not quite as bad as Inaho."</br>  <br>audience (of one) surrogate</br>  <br>He's also good at pointless festival games.</br>  <br>A best friend.</br>  This show might be to dark for me, and i'm someone who loves dark an edgy... But seeing this cute little girl in this complete state of insanity is just to sad.  <br>But she's not insane</br>   ...   Okay.  then go play your donte games  <br> edgy <br> pissing his pants by the 2nd episode <br> ... </br></br></br>  I'm someone that does not love dark and edgy and I have no problem with this.  Looks like they're going to ruin it by putting too much time on her perspective and deviate from the manga. Expect it to continue as 95% slice of life dog chasing and 5% segments of Shovel bashing somethings head in then moping.  <br>So just like the early chapters of the manga</br>  <br>If she bashes dogs in the head with a shovel I'm picking this up.</br>  <br>Did you even? They spent almost no time on her, and this is already taking place far into the manga so its all over the place from here on out.</br>  I can't wait for her to come to her senses, This pretend/blocking it all out is nonsense.

Else the Death Knight actually looks bearable despite the CG.</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't think the death knight was supposed to be that fucking big. I thought it was going to be slightly larger than the soldier.</br></br>  <br>Well at least the Deathknight is a big guy.</br>  god damn Enri a cute .A CUTE!  <br>I thought executioner full armored Albedo was cuter.</br>  <br>I hear she takes a level in badass later on. Volume 8? Anyone have her stats from there?</br>  <br>Here you go. Not translated though</br>  <br>Still mad she doesnt have big ass towershield on her.</br>  <br>Ge-General? Shes been leveling like mad commanding those goblins.</br>  <br>Right? Like how the hell did he bulk up so suddenly after death?</br>  <br>I always thought the corpse was little more than a catalyst for the Raise Medium Undead spell, not that corpse itself became a death knight.</br>  <br>So we're getting Death Knight and basic new world infodump next.</br>  <br>Which of his 700+ spells is this?</br>  <br><br><br>Farmer lv 1<br>Sergeant lv 1<br>Commander lv 2<br>General lv 2<br><br>I dunno.. it seems agriculture might not be her true calling.. Just a thought</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The LN says the Death Knight is around 230cm tall, which is tall but not fucking gigantic like the one in the anime looks.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's big. 230cm tall in the translation. And it generated a foll set of equipment it might as well bulk up the base body.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense.</br>  <br>It's not a spell. It's a class special ability.</br>  <br>Well, they got the "It no longer looked human" "It was more like a beast" part right.</br>  <br>X cum y. Basic latin.</br>  <br>From Wiki:<br>  If Death Knight is summoned normally, it will cease to exist after a short time  <br> but if it is summoned in combination with a corpse, the Death Knight seems to become a permanent existence.  <br><br>You're probably right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do we know how many of his spells the author has described yet?</br>  <br>He used a good chunk of them in vol 3.<br>Shark Cyclone a best.</br></br>  <br>And the biggest bonus is that Ainz has that 4/12/20 for his high/mid/low undead summons per day. <br><br>Said limits don't apply if he uses corpses and just mana. Though it's not said anywhere how much his massive mana pool supports per day. 50 low-tiers? 200? 500?<br><br>Thus he needs his corpse supplies and experiments on how strong "base" he can use for low/mid/high tier summons. <br><br>If Sunlight Scriptures fairly experienced mooks allowed the undead to reach ~40 iirc before experiencing, I really doubt human bases in general go higher than low or early mod tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>700 spells from 16 different systems, so I doubt we have seen each of those. He seems to favor certain systems though as he was support in-game.</br>  <br>Was Iguvua one of those tests?</br>  <br>before expiring* thanks brain.</br>  Post the best and your favorite Ainz magic/spell. Use spoiler tags if it's not in the 4 volumes translated so far.<br><br>Personally, I'll go with:<br><br>Best:  [La Shub Niggurath]  I hope he uses it more than once in upcoming volumes even though it's so heinous a spell.<br><br>Favorite: [Falldown].  Shalltear  never saw it coming.<br><br>I like [Grasp Heart] as well. Ainz knows what's up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely, though if I remember right his char sheet, he had a monster base, no? And 41 probably refers to him being 41. test sample.</br>  So do they revive a human later on in the story to serve the tomb? Or are they all so below their level that it wasn't worth it?  <br>He at least used Wail of the Banshee but I was hoping he'd use something more classic like Finger of Death/Power Word: Kill in the early volumes.</br>  <br>Hmm, let's see.<br><br>Best: Are skills included? Because I'd go with  The goal of all life is death <br><br>Favorite: Sharks Cyclone. Sharknado. Hell yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will they make Narberal cute?</br>  <br><br> Forgetting Perfect Warrior <br>Momon would like a word with you.</br></br></br>  <br>The human would have to quite impressive to get his/hers seat in Nazarick.<br><br>Only 2 (up until 9th vol) are there, one has the seat as per Ainz wishes and the one might have to run away from Empire.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, he can't use magic in that so no.</br>  I hear this shit is based on D&amp;D's system.<br> Are there any muscle wizards? </br>  <br>Doesn't look like they'll be censoring much, if at all.</br>  DO NOT OPEN<br><br>IT MAY CAUSE HEART ATTACK</br></br>  <br>Could be the perspective, but yeah, the DK looks taller than the houses in the background in one of the shots. That's beyond 230cm.<br><br>That being said, every character looks taller in the anime than they really are. Ainz is 177, yet looks massive. Sebas too, at 181,</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people pretend to like Narberal?</br>  <br>New world denizens have "Martial Arts" which matches weeaboo fightan magic in D&amp;D.</br>  <br>Muscle wizards don't really exist in D&amp;D anon, unless you count monks.<br><br>And it's not EXACTLY based on D&amp;D, but there are certain similarities you'll notice. It helps that the "spooky-skeleton-summoning necromancer" archetype was basically invented by D&amp;D.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we have their character cards?</br>  <br>None so far, the strongest attacker NPC "humanoid" for Nazarick is Inner/Outer Ki master and such among being dragonic and monk/martial king. Probably the closest match.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's good. This story needs some real gore in certain parts to get across the mood.<br>I was watching GATE the other day and I found the lack of violence when they invaded Tokyo to be a bit off-putting.<br><br><br> smugpapa.jpg </br></br></br></br></br>  Volume 11, chapter 9 TLs are out.<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Now talk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pan-san was in the past, Hikigaya-kun is in the present.<br><br>Cats are eternal.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's a major factor in it.
