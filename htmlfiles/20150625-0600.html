[ Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe  rerelease   Cupoche look disgusting. Like nebdoroids sister with downs.   tfw want to buy kancolle figs but people keep calling me a filthy secondary    Cupoche look disgusting  Opinions     Cupoche look all right. Like Nendoroids with joints.    What the hell kind of rifle is that?     Giving a shit about what others plebs could think about the shit you buy  Step up nigga     It's better than the usual opinion. He gave a valid criticism. He doesn't like the faces.   Most retards come in here and just blurt out random franchise hate, "kek SAO autist"       Cupoche are the pochaco of nendoroids. They look disgusting and they are not ok as op.      Cupoche look disgusting  You misstyped Nanorich, anon     I don't find her that nice for some reason   how the hell do you pronounce cupoche again?   It's the best Tenshi and it was baby's first love tragedy for college aged teens who are too young to realize it's nothing special.    kyu poesh-.    Their faces are ugly. There is something very off about them. Especially the mouth. And they all have the same copypasted open mouth in every character. I like that the got joints but I wish they would learn how to make cute faces. But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.      But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.  You are in luck, there is a Dark Magician Girl in the line     Sadly the only one. I meant more like yugi or any of the other "main characters", I would also give a lot for arc v characters. Or dark magician to go with dark magician girl.   Nippon-Yasan's asking for a picture of my credit card with my name on it, but I only used a debit card that doesn't have my name on it. Payment pushed through, however. Anyone else had this problem before?   I remember someone in this thread being asked for a picture of his passport.    Other characters from YuGi-OH woould be great TBH   How do you guys feel about this?   I like it   How is Pulchra?    Mouth and chin ruin it for me. Shame too, because I really, really like it otherwise.     The ahoge is stupid.    The other version is this. I find the first more appealing. I am thinking about it but the baby face looks off. I still think it looks great.    I actually like it a bit. Just the baby chin is getting to me and I'm not sure if that's enough to stop me.   Is she cast off? If I ever see this one on sale I might get her.   It looks good but I dont see the appeal of busts or other figures where part of the body is missing, like lower legs.    The welded tits are bothersome though. I don't think so though. Semen demon isn't either.    I don't have only figures so it isn't out of place for me. Also the sculptor put a lot of detail in and if he included the rest of it then it would be either, really expensive, or not that great.    APS Underwater Rifle, it shoots big darts.  Step up your obscure gun knowledge anon.       phat will never re-release Mio or Ranko  P-Please.     Yeah the little weld and visible seams aren't great, hence why I would wait for a sale. I think the face looks pretty damn good, and the rest is okay. Not fond of the Maria fig, face is bad. And I just prefer Mio.   Can amiami banned you if you missed payment for once? I already cancel an item last month and I don't want ask them again. This figure quality looks ugly as fuck   They can and might, but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.    I asked for cancellation 5 times didn't pay 3 times used my total cancel then I can't cancel anymore.       Next time use HLJ to save all this trouble. I usually use Amiami, but for items I'm not 100% sure of I go with HLJ.   I live in Canada and I plan on ordering something from AmiAmi.  The buyfag guide mentions something about Pornogaphy and Lolis, does this prevent me from order anything loli-like or only if that specific loli is subjected/related to 18+ stuff?      Fuck it I'll just not pay, rather spend my money on something useful. Plus I'm leaving for vacation this late month. I'll keep that in mind, mainly use amiami as well.      I like loli, but I wouldn't recommend it because it pays with consequences if customs happen to open your parcel. Just get stuff with adult looking woman and you'll be fine.    I've missed payment for 2 months in a row, and I'm not banned.    Why did you even preorder her? Only po where you know it will be good     something useful  Like what? Another prostitute?     but what is classified as loli? I want to pick up a PriPara nendoroid, is that not even safe?    Wow, aside from the giant eyes, she actually looks Japanese.    You're retarded.    Of course that's safe. Just don't purchase any lewd loli products. Actual pornogarphy or statues with nudity etc    Nigger use your brain. How is a nendoroid even sexual? Don't get lewds and you'll be fine.    I almost got her too but &gt;welded tits    What are you planning to do with that nendo that you even think its lewd?    Not sure I just thought it was gonna be decent, but I also browse other daiki kogyo figures and they look like shit too   Food, clothing      Looking worse and worse and getting more expensive.  This is outrageous.     If these were priced like figmas they might actually be okay, but fuck the prices are outrageous for the quality and just in general.   I'm almost tempted just because it's Haruna though.        but I've cancelled many orders and ignored payment twice before and I'm still not banned.  Man, fuck you. I've asked to cancel something once in 4 years of buyfagging (a tentative pre-order with an unknown release date, at that) and they politely told me to fuck off.    So, Yotsuba got licensed in my place. Should I?   Is that Kaiba?    Probably because it was a tentative one, procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all. So cancelling one of those is probably the biggest fuck you that you can give them.     procuring stock for those is more complicated for them after all  Yeah sure except they hadn't secured stock for the order. To this day they still haven't, even though I ordered it last year. They could email me tomorrow and say "lol whoops sorry couldn't get it" and I'd be shit out of luck because it's getting harder and harder to find elsewhere. I've been stuck with this fucking order in limbo for 8 god damn months. That's why I wanted to cancel. They're the ones screwing me over, not the other way around.     every order this month delayed   second month in a row   I'm getting the shakes.      That's completely ridiculous. There's no tentative order that should last more than a month.   Boku girl figure with interchangeable parts when?  Also was really looking forward to new prison school figures, but the more and more I see of the new anime the less and less I think it's going to happen. It looks so shitty.     I know. That's why I'm so mad. I've asked them to confirm whether they can get it and they just sent me a passive-aggressive message explaining what a tentative pre-order is and directing me to their FAQ.     it looks so shitty.  No.     It's the perfect time to hunt for some bargains on released figures!    Did you see the OP and ED song choices? That animation quality is nowhere near Danmachi or Railgun either.  I'd rather be realistic now, than delusional and hopeful based on no evidence.     If I didn't despise Infinite Shitos I'd get bunny french slut, it's a nice figure, especially for that price   Well, that's just retarded. I would have guessed that they would gladly cancel it if they have so much problems with it themselves, but they seem insanely stubborn about this for no apparent reason. What is it even?      harder and harder to find elsewhere  It's an item that was indeed released elsewhere after you preordered? That's strange. I'd expect that behavior from them if it was something that kept being delayed by the maker, as I've seen items get delayed month after month until it just says "available late 201x."   I wouldn't be bothered myself unless it was a real expensive item, and I wish you'd post what it is, but I'd understand not wanting to.      Is Yuki Mori Megahouse's Saber?  What's a good proxy service for yahoo auctions? I have a few that are probably gonna need some last minute sniping.  If she's not at next wonfes I'll give up on her. Shame she looks great.           Is that the Beelzebub manga?     hating fun        got  You're a few years late. It has been licensed for a long time and been released up to vol 12 in Indonesia.    So according to science we're apparently mentally retarded https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JPq<wbr>hiZpp1Sw</wbr>  [ ]    a harem where the girls are shitty bitches isn't fun    In which language? Indon?    We are on 4chan. Of course we fucking are.    Of course. I did say licensed and released in Indonesia.      Ada pelbagai bahasa kat Indon    I prefer the term 'autistic'     being so beta that 2D girls hurt your feelings     Don't you start speaking Malay here.     we gave monkeys yummier food and they got mad when we took it away  Wow, no shit. People don't get paid for these "studies" I hope     Quite a few people from SEA on /a/ around this time    Cute    I want to get paid for shit like that too.    I liked the picture they showed of the two asian ladies sitting on the ground.  I'm thankful everyday that I'm not a hoarder, though.       where is this from      that face quality   but waifu in bunny suit  I'm unsure.      Quantum Leap    thanks   Is this the buyfag thread?   No.    Thanks for reminding me why I am saving a money.    Shoot    no its yugi    You're saving one whole money? Hot damn.    Has anyone here seen the Raiden nendo? Supposedly he comes with a nude body, what are the odds it's going to be GSC store exclusive? Has anyone here ever ordered from GSC directly? I'm wondering if it's worth the cost    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127112054  Kill yourself.   So it looks like she's been delayed to July. How many months more do you think she'll actually be delayed?     Hopefully another month, my July order is going to be 38k...    Oh a centaur  boatshit      All great things are GKs    looks too good to be true, must be a GK. I want to learn how to paint them, but that requires time, effort, and patience, of which I have none.     Is she really a GK? She looks absolutely gorgeous   So any news as to when she'll be released?  I've never wanted a GK so much in my whole life   その精液の鬼はだれですか   who wonfes2015 here?   It's still a month away, calm down.    Why    You're waifu is Kirino?    Yes    I feel sorry for you    I'm used to the insults by now. Doesn't stop me from loving her anyway.    wow it feels like last wonfes was like a week ago. I'm getting too old.  I hope my love will get painted this WF       Good. Don't let them change you    I only own aidorus and boatshit. Doesnt stop me. "Good taste" in this thread is determined by who is on. Just say the necessary "Kill yourself faggot" to whoever says you have shit taste and move on.    What's wrong with boats?    I LOVE YOU TOO SANTA CLAUS     I'm getting too old  I know that feeling. I'm noticing blemishes on my skin and and gradual reduction in time in which I can watch anime.     Pretty much this. The majority of my collection is Sonico, Vocaloid, Idols, and vidya-related, so I either just ignore people with their "superior taste" or tell them to fuck off and move on.    What the fuck is even non shit taste? What kind of figures do those faggots buy that they look down i others?    Pretty sure everyone has shit taste.    That's really shit taste though, for real.    Reaally? Curious what example of superior taste have they used on you    I think so too.    No such licensed manga in Indonesia used any language other than Indonesian.    Except me     meong meong      meong        nyaa     Being Malaysian, I'm surprised at times as to the similarities and the differences between Malay and Indonesian. To me, Indonesian sounds like a VERY formal version of Malay    Fuck off.    Now make the superior horse pussy    It doesn't matter what you get because people will always say it's shit.  Even if they secretly like it.      examples  Are you kidding? At best you get a  franchise  And a smug reaction image.         owning anything from mfc's items on fire   Fuck, I still can't decide. I have watched anime a bit and don't really care about it, but this figure is just too cute.   Translation : あなたは何をしている    You mean to say that you're just buying it because it's cute? Have you even seen the anime?    Can you read?    Can you even read? I watched the beginning, it was shit and for little girls, but figure is cute.     I find Indonesian onomatopoeia quite interesting     Feels like they've been the same for years.     it was shit and for little girls  I find that somewhat offensive       Sorry for saying it that way, but it is for kids. It's okay if you like it though, I didn't.    You're 1 off a Pleb Bingo, mate.    So yup   After far to many delays my Mikasa is here it's nice to own the one not shit thing to come from that show.   4 ordered and 1 wished.  Not too bad.      Too bad that Inori is shit.    They're kind of like a fusion of nendoroids and figmas.    Thank you, I like it a lot and wish subs would come out much more faster. But seriously, thanks for being considerate.    That didn't stop you buying the rest.    Funny how iya means the opposite thing in Japanese.    No problem anon, it's okay to like cute stuff. I might try to keep going a couple more episodes and see if I'll like it more.    Do you have any photos of your collection?    Tomoyo still holding up my order   So I have an order in Amiami with keychain that is in stock and Shinobu that will be released 7th July. Will Amiami separate them into two orders?  Now what in the hell is a Spot Sale Item and why is it charging so much handling.  Do you guys have any way to contact j-list, I can't seem to contact them through their website.   no    Yes   Will there ever be any decent Castlevania figures? I really like the outfits and just the overall look of these characters on my pic. Especially that hunky Richter Belmont! Anyways, dont /v/ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out me to death pls.     Interesting.     Yes, don't.   No.<br/>       maybe    Could you repeat the question?    Shanoa is cute. but     I already made the mistake of ordering through them, now I just want my shit    Here's the pic I posted before. Some figures are in other parts of the house. I'm in the process moving a few things around.     Nice. I regret not getting her earlier despite not being cast off.      not letting you figures out of their cardboard and plastic prisons  how cruel    Welp, the best merch I could get. Gonna enjoy that.   Get the ramen bowl too.    mugs are great    What about it?    casual/10    I'm working on it. Those aren't the only ones unfortunately.    Is it me or are mugs really small?    Are you American?     RAH Miku  I hope you also bought the doll.     GSC charged me for Tomoyo  SOON.     RAH Miku  Please let me know how she looks    Enjoy the twenty-fourth of June.   Thanks.    That size seems pretty reasonable in my opinion. The mugs at my office are so small that I can only put my little finger through the hole halfway.  [ I do have big hands for an asian though      Thanks doc   FINALLY...bought these through amazon.co.jp and had a friend ship them to me...slightly damaged boxes but the books seem to be in order.  Sorry for no resize...I'm on an iPad.     If you mean the DD then yes it's in one of those large boxes.   I'll post some pictures when I open it. From what I see it's not that great and but it was a gift. Like most RAH she dropped in price dramatically after release so still you might be able to find her for a low price.      Would you?   Oh hold on, lemme attach a picture  Now what in the hell is a Spot Sale Item and why is it charging to much for handling?      It just works.   Have any of the rich folks we have here ever had a cleaning lady? Do you entrust your figures to her after teaching her how to clean them, or do you have her clean everything else while you do the figures yourself?   If they made a K-On one.    Cleaning the figures is part of the hobby. Why would you entrust that to anyone else?    I wouldn't, I'm just curious.    I do, and no. Express orders were given not to touch the figs.  Best $85 every two weeks I could ever spend.      Switch around the TT/H to make H/TT and it's perfect.    it looks amazing    I'm guessing Mandarake, in which case you could have easily Googled the answer during that 40 minutes you waited.  As for the handling fee, since you didn't specify an amount no one can tell you if it's a lot.      All I want is that 1:1 Char Aznable helmet, and my search has always been in vain. I might have to fly to Japan to find it.    Just make one yourself.    Ah shit, I'm retarded.   Yeah, it was Manda. Only place I can find that figure. The shipping fee via EMS comes up as 1,860. On the Confirm page it comes up as "Carriage (Tax Included)" and there's also the shipping, so in total I'm paying an extra 2360 for a 4000 fig. I tried placing an order for the same figure at a different store and the only additional cost that came up was the shipping of 500.      Kinda expensive, almost 3kY.    According to myfigurecollection, it is.  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>309703</wbr>      Nothing I'd be able to make would be as good. Ah well, I'll just buy another Jojo figure.    There's a 500 yen fee for orders placed that total less than 5000 yen before shipping. So that "500 yen shipping" at the other store is just the handling fee.  Spot sale items are guaranteed to you if you place an order before someone else. I guess that's why the shipping fee is shown right away instead of having to wait for them to invoice you. So it's probably not a spot sale item at the other store which is why you don't see the actual shipping fee. It'd end up being the same cost at either store.     Yo   Why the fuck did the post just post itself Does anyone think this fig might go cheaper later on after release?     Clean them myself. She bumped my Caster figure off the shelf while dusting and the peg that conect the figure to the base broke. I don't even let her clean the room where most of my figures are anymore. Rather do the cleaning of that room myself.   Yes I'm still mad, I love that Caster.      FunnyKnights   Who?    When I saw the unpainted figure it looked so nice and promising but i really think they fucked it up    Didn't even notice the horse legs until reading comments. This is the first boat girl I actually want...too bad i can't paint     These were the kinds of stories I was hoping to hear. Thanks. I probably wouldn't let mine enter the figure room either, if I had one.    Really? Interesting, thanks anon.    Contact thru twitter, they respond    Those sleeves look so dumb.    You're dumb    Same people who made a few other KanColle figs with some dodgy at best QC.   Will she be expensive after release?     Probably    Probably, since the show is popular.     Well, fuck. She is already too expensive (at least without Amiami's discount) for such a simple figure.     Oh wow. Yeah i need a setup like this! So nice. I like the white displays better than ugly clear detolfs and shit like that.    Of course, the series is really popular and they're milking it for all the money they can get while its still hot.    do you prefer this one than alter's?    Buy it so they make Onodera.    I like MF's more. I'm afraid what Alter will do with the pole, I hate it when they leave them visible.    That was my plan.          11k   Shit, anon. I would want one too, but that's heavy consideration tier dosh right there.       Not sure I want this figure because of tail-butt plug.  ok, I give up. What is the secret to getting her shirt closed?   Do it for second best girl.     I think the nendroid fig would satisfy me when it comes to chitoge. If it were Marika or Haru or Kisaki, I wouldn't even think about it and just buy the full fig.      all heroines have multiple prize figures and some even have figures   Kirito has 2 prize figures, both him as trap  Not that I care about Kirito, but it really shows how rare it is for male protagonists to get figures, even if they're popular as fuck.      That perfect Benten figure. I need it in my life.    buying male figures     it really shows how rare it is for male protagonists to get figures  Kaiki when      He's so beautiful though.     There used to be more but they got bumped off.     not wanting a shota collection  Still waiting for good Killua figure here.     There's no chance of a Kaiki figure until there isone of Araragi.  ;_;      Being insecure     Ararararagi got a figma at least.    About what?     Due to licensing constraints, this product will not be available for shipment to Canada, and United States of America. We appreciate your understanding.     It's Araragi.    Love this gimmick.    I don't know why there isn't a scale of Araragi. I thought he was a likeable MC. People would even buy it if they wanted a complete set of Monogatari's. If Kaiki get's a figma it would be the only one I would buy.   Does anyone have this Yayoi? How dumb does the face look dumb in person?   I don't expect there to be any more expensive merch (nendos would be awesome though). I don't mind paying 3k to remind me of a show I really enjoyed.    Not as dumb. You can see from that picture that the bigger you make it, the more creepy it looks.  I guess the mouth would remain the only issue, if you have a problem with it.       That is brilliant.  But I would be too scared about shipping something so fragile, and I probably would never eat from it.       Not wanting to add fuccbois to your collection    Got home to open my orders from May.   I think it looks fucking hilarious.    It probably comes in a box and amiami usually uses up a tree's worth of packing paper in each box. I'm just trying to figure out if I should get one or two.   When ordering from Cdjapan, do you always have to prepay or is there a way to pay on release like at amiami?   what sound does she make again i hope someone integrates that into a fig     only prepay     I'm just using it as an excuse to not spend ~£12 on a bowl.  But damn I am tempted.  And the show was about the joys of eating together, so you probably need two.  Shame that orders are closed on this.         Can I have a squid?     Bowls are cute, but I don't think there are that many of them around.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127121565#p127121565">Click here</a> to view the full text.

Whats the matter anon, don't like Fate/powerlevels?  Evangelion raked in more money than some third-world countries and every studio in existence hopped on the bandwagon.  The people making it got old, the people watching it got old, and the newcomers are young people who've grown up with no real prospects and want to make escapist fapbait all the fucking time.   Good mahou shoujo is gone, now there is only outstanding mahou shoujo.    Houkago no Pleiades is a fantastic mahou shoujo.    What happened to fantastic mahou shoujo longer than 4 cours?     copy   paste   thread       Kaleid is trash.  It's still surrounded by a sea of shit.     you were born in the wrong generation   Why are you posting bad anime?   UWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE      nothing anime really started with Haruhi   After Cowboy Bebop they decided they already made the best anime ever so they gave up.   Yuri killed mahou shoujo.   Prove me wrong if you can.       There is still good stuff being made, but it gets lost in the endless stream of cheap cash-grab stuff like young-adult LN adaptations, haremshit, moeshit and falvour-of-the-week shonen adaptations. because that's what sells.  As in other fields of artistic expression, the existence of mass-produced shit does not prevent the existence of quality works.        Nanoha   Symphogear   Prisma Illya   Madoka  If you think all of them are shit, you have shit taste        I would say Daiz killed it if we didn't get both SB69 and Etotama in the same season.     Nanoha  decent  Symphogear  shit  Prisma Illya  shit  Madoka  painfully mediocre           Mahou Shoujo was stillborn?    Idolshit happened   Anime has never been better my friend  Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?   Haruhi&gt;Hyouka&gt;Hibike   Nope.   Are you some newfag that did not watch Hyouka?   Free &gt; all   Anon how fucking delusional are you? Full metal Panic is superior to that Yuribaiting shit.   Hyouka &gt; Keion &gt; Haruhi &gt; Clannad &gt; Tomoko &gt; Hibike &gt; Amagi &gt; Free &gt; Chuuni &gt; Who cares  Haruhi was my favourite kyoani show  It's better than Haruhi.    FMP  It's just shit for kids.   Kanon&gt;Clannad        Speaking of animation, Hyouka may be a step ahead of Hibike.  But Hibike is surely among the best things they have made for sure. Haruhi is somewhat good, only the movie is almost a masterpiece. So Euphonium is above It undeniably.       Precure thread    I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.    I want Ranko to piss on me.    I'm going to marry Haruharu!   Very sasuga Haruyama    Her father won't allow to screw up his daughter.    my Kanade folder is lacking, please post more      I've never been able to unsee that leg after someone pointed it out.    I can survive another day.    what, her broken ankle?    I think he means her second knee    When the fuck is she coming back, my impatience is killing me.   What does it sound like?   Well, you ruined that image for me now.      Dypear family is super cute.     Just for the record, I'd kiss Minamin   Cool, you also need the title. You might be able to fit it in the top left instead of the right vertically. Also, if someone could go check the official Twilight T-shirt for her three phrases that would be nice.        I'd still fuck bad end beauty    I really, really like this picture.   Daily Minamin!!  I find it really upsetting that the International Cures didn't get a chance to shine in HapCha. I'd love to see an animated short or manga or something to give them official names and moments to be.  Which Cure is as all around great as Mana?   A little makeup and we get gal Kanade.    Careful anon , my dick might not be able to take that.         Why did the style change so much?   Reika's magic pencil   Because the artist got progressively better skills and taste over time.    Man, the American education system is a joke. I didn't learn that shit until college.    I've learned it in middle school. That was simple.   I want every cure to pee on me at the same time.   I want to pee on every cure in turn.   Oh hey, it's a quiz motw. Tough act to follow after Suite's, though.   Whaaaa. Linear algebra should totally be a high school subject. You know, if the system wasn't shit at teaching math.     Which season took your Precure virginity? Suite for me.  Okay okay, I get it, no one's as smart as Reika. But seriously?

I think I just saw Hosshiwa and Oresky's lovechild as a character in the new Fire Emblem     That's racist.

Not 2 minutes   6 minutes      Nagisa, Rin, and Kanade do not fit the technical requirements to be Pretty Cure as they are not pretty   Cure Ace kakkoi     Nagisa   Not pretty  It's not healthy to eat shit, anon.       Kanade   not pretty  Good one, dweeb      To be fair only a handful of the girls are actually referred to as attractive.    Kanade is one of the prettiest cures around. Hibiki agreed, don't bother her about it.    I will bother her about it.   I'll tell her she's way prettier.       sound goes out     Follow a precure artist on pixiv   They follow me back  Oh god, oh geez, why would they do that?     It's polite.     It's polite.  "Now you not stalker, because now we friends. Harro, friend."    Hey, more comedians I don't know. That'll be fun, watching references fly over my head.   Heh. People make a stink about Nagisa and Kanade being not pretty. But not Rin.     Oh gracious.

Sexual education isn't always a tragedy.     1-hour drawing incoming.  Today's theme is about Haruno Momoka, aka HaruHaru's cute little sister, and Kisaragi Reiko, aka Pafu's number one fan.  http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-23?<wbr>lang=en http://togetter.com/li/838540?lang=<wbr>en</wbr> </wbr></wbr>      To the anon who told me I had to get Aesir subs because the other version was too painful for him to watch: You're on crack. Shit like this is Commie level subbing.  At least Doremi had the decency to keep her name as Majorina.      It's a cameo you're not missing any deep jokes other than your usual Japanese duo comedy crap.     Haruka doesn't look comfortable here.     mfw fansub groups think they're 4kids    God live watch anons are more annoying that the kigposters. You spend more time screencapping and posting than watching the damn show.   Haruka is far too wet to be comfortable.    But she's under an umbrella.    It's fun to see people enjoying a show which I also enjoyed.  Also, it's on topic for the thread. If you don't like it, you should stay away from /pc/ except right after a new episode airs.      Obviously I don't mean her hair is wet.  I mean, she's probably wet somewhere that the umbrella doesn't protect.  Somewhere lower down.  Picture related, it's a wet Kirara with dry hair.           Aesir-Anxious   Aesir  That sounds fami --  Magenta  HA HA HA nope. Magenta takes large liberties with his subs. Just ask /m/. After using a joke/meme name for a characters real name, he got a bug up his ass when people complained how stupid it was to do so.          It's fun to see people enjoying a show which I also enjoyed.  Nah it's been one anon posting screencaps and playing reviewer the entire time.      Ryouma Warring      it's fun   nah   If you're not having fun, you're free to fuck off.       You rang?     Ornac     He's been at this for sometime now. I think most people got use to it and just ignore it just like with kigs.   I have a feeling your the live watch poster.      I want to marry Yuri's mom.  Did someone say kigs?  Been trying to go through the archive to find fight webms but there is so many threads. Anyone got some good fight webms?      I have a feeling your the live watch poster.  1/ Learn English, please. 2/ You're wrong.        Holy shit, the fighting in this show looks good. I need to watch this. It's tie I took off my hiatus for Precure.     Please think of the future of the thread and post responsibly. We don't want to sit through hours of a ded thread before a new thread pops up, do we?      Not even Precure can escape the scourge of Magenta.       Due to no new episode this week the threads have been slower than usual.    relay race episode  Nothing really interesting going on here. I guess character episodes are just kinda like that sometimes. Have a GoPri fight instead.  A little aside, I'm pleasantly surprised how likeable all five cures are in Smile. I suppose none of them are abrasive or controversial for any reason whatsoever, but it's a nice change from the usual. Though I suppose Fresh was a little like this too.   So what happens when we get to a series you hated?   Sounds like a pleasant character. To be fair, most of the subs haven't been horrible so far, I just hate that particular thing.            so you want us to sit though hours of a dead thread so we don't have to sit though hours of a dead thread     ignoring kigs     I think he's talking about the image limit. That dead zone when it's filled but there are another 50+ posts under the bump limit is brutal.    Screencaps and kigs have had the threads to themselves.    Sounds like a plan to me.    Nah, there's plenty of fan art in every thread. Of course most of it is the same 200 or so images getting posted over and over, unless it's from the current season.   What motif would you like to see in Precure? Pirates? Girls like pirates right? Pirate Cures who swashbuckle their way into our hearts.     Animal theme is way overdue.    Throw in some Hurricanes and you've got some Second-Coming-Of-Heartcatch tier material there.    Seasons.   Come the fuck on already, Toei.       Pirate Cures     Spring - Pink Summer - Yellow (Red?) Fall - Red (Yellow?) Winter - Blue  This shit writes itself.         Pro Wrestling Cures. The girls can be joshi wrestlers in training but when they transform they're grappling machines.     Dino-Pirates of Ninja Island Pretty Cure.  Troubled Teens Pretty Cure (Delinquent, Bullied, Eating Disorder, Autistic Student Council President).  Greek Myth Pretty Cure.  Norse Myth Pretty Cure.  Biblical References Pretty Cure.  Seelie / Unseelie Faerie Court Pretty Cure, could also cover the Seasons aspect.  Werewolf Pretty Cure (they'd fight Vampires of course).                 Winter - Blue  Not white?     idols    White would be a nice change from the usual ice-blue.     What motif would you like to see in Precure?   Four Benevolent Animals Precure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_<wbr>Benevolent_Animals  "Cure Dragon!"   Four Horsecures of the Prettypocalypse: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_<wbr>Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse  "Cure Dess!"  </wbr>   </wbr>       Greek Myth Pretty Cure.   Norse Myth Pretty Cure.  Not going to lie Cures being avatars for mythological goddesses would be fucking cool. Cure Athena, Cure Isis, Cure Selene, Cure Freya        Four Benevolent Animals Precure  It sounds cool until you get to Cure Turtle.     As long as they have a ship as their base and their mentor is a sexy pirate bitch who drinks alot.     Cure Isis  ALLAH ACKBAR      Cure Athena   So Mana would be mixed in there somewhere.      That's your shield using Cure right there. I like like to see Tortoise Cure be the tank of the group.      Cure Athena, Cure Isis, Cure Selene, Cure Freya  It might be cool to mix them from different mythologies, but then we'd get fewer myth seasons.  How about:  Cure Athena   Cure Diana   Cure Persephone   Cure Aphrodite     Cure Turtle  She's the token Shield Cure. It's an honorable profession.  Seriously, a green shield Cure. It's got potential.                 Cure Mummies Alive?     Shit group naming themselves after best Egyptian deity  This is why we now have to refer to the actual Isis as Ishizu, I'm sure.    Extremely late Precure one-hour draw:  http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-23  Today's theme is Haru2's little sister, and Pafu's number one fan. Literally who?  </wbr>     They could have a group of heel cures.  They use dirty tactics like throwing salt in their eyes and using tables      I guess I'm not excited to see another Cure Mint, complete with mousy personality and inevitable shield-related limit break. Turtles are kind of nerdy, so I just thought it wouldn't be very fun.   or sexy        Someone already linked it:     Anon, I...        Werewolf Pretty Cure (they'd fight Vampires of course).  Could an occult cure team work? Or maybe even a yokai themed group?      Turtles are kind of nerdy  Nerdy Cures are the best.      Well shit. That's embarrassing.     IIRC there's some tension there because Youkai Watch is eating PreCure market share right now.  But hmm.  What if the Cures were the Youkai? Like, the faeries and "purified" things were actually Youkai? So the Cures would get Youkai powers to fight evil Western imperialist monsters (like werewolves and vampires and all that other shit from D&amp;D).         Turtles are kind of nerdy  Raphael is "cool, but crude" Michelangelo is a "party dude"      Teen~age mut~ant Pret~ty Cure~tles.    Monster girl pretty cure.  I kid, that's a terrible idea.      Don't get me wrong, I love Tsubomi, and Honoka, and I suppose Yayoi in her own way. I'm less convinced about Komachi  and Yui . I just don't think a turtle-like personality would be nearly as cute.    Cure~tles  ow         I want a cute vampire Cure. Like she's literally a vampire but she can turn into a Cure too. Oh, what if she is a MOTW but shows up down the line to be a one shot Cure. Can you imagine the response? One shot characters get a lot of fans going.     I think I'd love a Cure Miia or Cure Papi.    Vampire magical girls are the best.    If one were to write a TMNT crossover with Precure which team would fit best? Hypothetical question of course for a friend.    I suppose it's only a matter of time before there's a one-fanged cure.     I just don't think a turtle-like personality would be nearly as cute.   You've seen shows with turtle-like girls, right?  I ask because so far they seem pretty cute.        I like this idea.    HaCha, because  I don't like them, so I won't mind if you soil their memory with fan-fiction .    Apparently not, maybe that's why I have so much trouble picturing it. Certainly the western cartoon portrayal of turtles hasn't been flattering, and in anime the only thing I've seen come up is kappa. And that joke is usually very, very unflattering to girls.    Kappa have nothing to do with the turtle mystical beast.  Seriously go watch Hyakko.      I think the toroise/turtle character should be portray as an honest character that always work hard despite its set back, just like the tortoise in The tortoise and the rabbit. That could work.     HaCha, because I don't like them     Crazy 70s America and their live action magical girls    Cure Torah Cure Kosher Cure Shofar Cure Mezuzah       You let me down, Hime. You weren't there for me when Megubrain was being painful to watch in the 2nd half.    Cure Torah  You're trying to be funny, but you're missing the obvious:  she's in the current season .         Heavenly bodies/Space.  inb4 Sailor Moon  There's more to space than planets      Cure Saint Seiya?     Heavenly bodies/Space.  Cure Sunshine, Cure Moonraito, and in the end  Tsubomi wants to be an astronaut . It's been done already, and done pretty well.      Hyakko  Ah, okay, that's just using that whole idea straight up, then. I wasn't trying to say that they were the same thing, simply that that was the closest thing to turtle-related characterization I'd seen in anime.   It could. I think I'm just hung up on the idea that turtles are ugly and boring.        I'd like to see the cures based on the various nomadic steppe hordes that spread terror across Eurasia.  Cure Hun Cure Mongol Cure Scythia Cure Xiongnu Cure Timurid          Isn't Mongol basically Xiongnu?    That is way too cute.    Similar location, similar concept, different time period. Not a 100% overlap though.    Saint Seiya was based more on constellations and leaned towards the mythological basis of the constellations names.  That's specific characters I mean an entire team theme being space.  Cure Milkyway or Cure Ganymede  Cure Supernova        Cure Black Hole Sun https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3mb<wbr>BbFH9fAg</wbr>  [ ]     Cure Rosemary   Cure Ginger   Cure Cinnamon   Cure Wasabi   Cure Paprika   Together with their mascots Zest and Garnish, they are Allspice Precure!          Full on desserts theme.     set in Jamaica?    Cure Twinkle is very space-themed.   Sounds hot  and spicy .        Oi Vey! Precure     Wait, weren't their motifs based on flowers? Wasn't that whole season about flowers?     Cure Ganymede  She's a trap, right?     What happened to Itsuki, and who is that wearing her costume?     Wait, weren't their motifs based on flowers?  How do you figure Moonraito is a flower?     Suddenly, Cure Mami     Don't remind me Saban has the rights to Precure in the states.      Moonraito  ...please stop...      Lily Moonbeam in the English dub   The Flower That Blossoms in the Moonlight   Her symbol is a blue rose        English dub  N word what?     I suppose I should've just taken their word for it, but I had no idea that (some) lilies only bloom in moonlight. Heck, I had no idea there were any flowers that did not.  Neat-o.  And you won't be laughing when it actually happens.        ...    English dub  No.  Her costume had a flower on it. Yes.  She's still not a flower, nor are her themes flower-oriented.  Erika at least had a dress that looked like it was made from flower-petals, even if "Marine" had jack shit to do with flowers.              I can't wait for Glitter Force.   Seriously though, Saban shows were my childhood, and the big Jew honestly does love toku. He tried to get kids into Jetman dubbed before giving up and making Power Rangers.     N word  Don't do that here, nigger.          Yuri's dress has a floral theme. It's just not the same kind of flower as the others'.    The entire theme of Heartcatch was flora life aka Flowers. Some of the Cure's motifs and names weren't directly flowers but their powers played into the who making flowers grow deal.    Saban Banzai!   Alright. The name "Yuri" is certainly flower-themed, but I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily, and I don't see any lily on her costume.  Her civilian form is more in-theme than her Cure form, I think.   Itsuki? Cologne?              Saban shows were my childhood   yadda yadda Jetman  It was Bioman and he isn't a "fan" he saw a business opportunity and persuade it. The idea that Haim Saban genuinely cared about the cartoons and shows his companies made is a lie create by people who want to numb the sting that he is a pretty shitty guy. Him making shows you grew up with shouldn't negate that.       I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily  Wisteria    Yuri is a finicky flower which needs lots of fertilizer to grow.  I think the "flower" label to Heartcatch is a mistake when it's theme is more about botany.   For some reason, the Japanese seem to catch the more obscure flower/plant name references that are largely lost in the western world. Erica is one of them, and might be the reason they named her that.    Hmm. At least the colors are kinda half right.    I know, I know. Just let me believe there's a kernel of love somewhere in his fat Jew heart.     Erica is one of them  I did not know that before. Thanks.   We are all cute little jewish girls in here, /a/non, and we have lots of love in our cute little jewish girl hearts.         We are all cute little jewish girls in here  I'm not.      Erica[note 1] /ˈɛrɨkə/,[note 2] is a genus of approximately 860 species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.[4] The English common names "heath" and "heather" are shared by some closely related genera of similar appearance.   Huh, learn something new every day.     I see a disturbing lack of Cure kigs...    DARK FAG     Nobody likes you, Edgy Cure.    Keep telling yourself that, kike.    Wait, Haruka is Jewish? I thought it was Honoka and... well, I didn't think it out any further than that.   The reach of /pol/ knows no limits    but I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily, and I don't see any lily on her costume.  Are you seriously that blind?      Gas the dykes.   Leave /u/ out of this      Diesel Nightmare Fuel     Yeah not seeing how that ruffled, two-layer dress is anything like the smooth, single-petal flower you posted.  That lily you posted isn't even the right color scheme.  Sorry, but you're the blind one.         This one at least has something close to her color scheme, but it also looks nothing like her dress.    It's the form of the dress it's even open at the front like a lily.    And like a slut.    Lots of dresses do that. Picture related, you ought to recognize her dress.    That's funny I saw Mugino shitting pixiv again when Kanata appeared    Over the line.    You do know there are more than one type of lily right?   Where is the restroom    You do know there are more than one type of lily right?  You can see that I posted two different kinds, right?   Tonight, this thread is the bathroom.             Cure FLORA   Princess of FLOWERS  Is this supposed to be a rebuttal of the idea that Moonlight's similar skirt design has floral motif...?        Ah, cool. That does look like her dress. It wasn't in the first three pages of Google, though.  Point conceded.     Has anyone made a mega chart with all or most of the Cure's VA's other popular roles?   Just like Non Non Biyori episode one.    It was a rebuttal of the idea that an open-front dress is specific to a lily.  It's not.  It's pretty common in dress design.  Picture related, she's not a flower princess so you can't even get confused about that.            Might need an update.     Change the sub track to "with honorifics" and her name is back to normal.     Awesome, thanks.     Welcome to the Castle of Despair    Towa...?    There's no mistaking it, that's Towa!   Towa... it's me, Kanata!   Yeah, she looks... looks... alike?    Her voice is exactly the same!   Now I want to show Kanata Jewelpet or Rozen Maiden or something...              /pol/ precure Cure Ayn Rand Cure Stormfront Cure Hitler did nothing Wrong      Will there ever be a Cure who is voiced by  Yu Kobayashi?    I'm sure he would enjoy some ohohoho https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-t<wbr>a3AdSvws</wbr>  [ ]    If Moonlight's motif isn't a flower then what is it? Actual moonlight?     "We have cures with the power of the sun and the moon."   So yeah.      If there can be a Sawashiro Cure, anything is possible.     I've never told you about her, Haruka... My sister... Towa...   I'm sensing a Twilight being his sister development~    But one day, Towa suddenly disappeared...   Yep, here we go~    Towa?!   Knew it~     Towa! It's me, Towa!   Towa...?    I am Twilight    It is I who is the one true princess...    It's not bed head! This is my hairstyle!   I-I beg your pardon   H-However...    You look your most beautiful with that hairstyle, Twilight-sama!    Wha...?!    Towaaaaaa!   Your brother will never accept that guuuuuuy!   Shut it! I just said I have no idea who you are!                                Her powers have nothing to do with the moon so go figure. Everyone of her special attacks has a fucking rose in the background with petals and her basic attacks are purple energy whips and blasts which can count as moonlight if you want to split hairs like the anon who started the whole thing.    Moonlight is as beautiful as 100 lilies!   How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif? Someone argue with me to increase the post count!     My favorite was Electro Woman and Dyna Girl. Could that be worked into a Precure show?     How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?   It's because she's Dutch.      Electro Woman and Dyna Girl were completely tech based. That would be like making Batman a Precure.     How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?  Because someone at Toei doesn't want to call a spade a spade.     In some other languages, Spade and Sword mean the same thing.    Well, yes. The playing card suit of spades is a stylized version of the swords found on tarot cards.    Thanks for ruining the joke    She got the label from daddy.     How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword  Because her dress is a lily.     Big Brother           Stupid sexy Cure Sword, stop making me want to watch Doki         Doki is good.  Just understand that sometimes the studio wanks Mana a bit too hard.  But other than that, it's mostly a good season.        Didn't at one point she go  fucking overdrive and make duplicates of herself to beat the final boss at the end?  That was pretty fucking OP.           Nevermind that shit! Why they call the girl Cure Peace when she spends the entire series kicking monste ass? That's ain't peaceful at all. Beat the shit out of monsters and representing peace. That's like Ghandi getting some street thugs in a head lock. You loose the right to call yourself the symbol of peace. Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit? I'm flatter you want to be Cure Black but it what it's cracked up to be. Look at how the Black Ranger gets treated. Black Panther. Once you go black you get put to the back of the group photos with like you Shin from Kamen Rider.          Cure Black   Shows up an hour late to crossover battles       Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit?  I chuckled.        What's with all the /b/ images in here tonight?       /wooo/ /m/ Chris Rock Not sure what /b/ you see.        There's some weirdness going on with their attacks, which are mostly flower-based but then you have the forte/fortissimo thing going, which is technically Italian but gives it away as purely musical with the f/ff visuals. They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.   Moonlight is mostly the lily motif, though, from her name Yuri, to (some) lilies blooming in moonlight, to the dress, to her heart flower being the (white?) lily. There are a few different readings for flowers in the Japanese interpretation, none of them fit perfectly; In the west, their association with funerals parallels the fact that everything she loves dies, but probably wasn't an intentional thing.  The violet rose thing is confusing, though. They're all over the background of her powers, and it's the backing flower for her solo purifying ritual. That said, Sunshine has a sunflower for hers, despite Itsuki's heart flower being the peony. (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)         There will never be a Precure who brandishes a sledgehammer like Triple H.   How cute! Today we get a little glimpse at these lovely cat's childhoods. Poor Hummy never managed to get the same growth spurt, but I don't think she minds.   What about Cure Rosetta Bitch can only speak Japanese      They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.   Butt Punch  is exactly what comes to mind when I think of flowers.   (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)  I feel like more effort went into Blossom and Marine as a cohesive unit, and that effort paid off. They were great. The added Cures didn't ever really jibe as a team when compared to the initial duet.   Tsubomi needed Triple H to sooth her flare-up after the butt punch.            Kanade  I was waiting for a chance to use this.     She should be Cure Cut    The Easter lily symbolizes purity, which is why it's often displayed at funerals. It's also a lily variety that's native to Japan.  I never really got why her image flower was the blue rose. I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.       I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.   It's a little girl show. They're allowed to use the obvious.  The one who had yet to bloom was TSUBOMI who became BLOSSOM.        So most people will recognize calling that the Peach Bomber as a Smash Bros reference, but it's actually a much (much) older gag than that, being the Japanese name given to fighting game moves where - typically only girl - attackers butt punched their opponents well before Smash existed. Thing is, the "peach" part isn't a reference to the butt, it's actually a reference to the vag (because of its appearance).   I'm actually not certain whether those lilies are used in Japanese funerals, isn't that a wholly western tradition?  Oh, I also forgot to mention that she's wearing a fricking blue rose on her lapel. I have no idea what's happening anymore.         The Japanese are weird about that. Mostly they like to be subtle but sometimes they like to on the nose. I think some creators/character designers want you to work for the reference.      Peach Bomber   Butt Punch  In pro wrestling it's called a hip attack and it is used by both men and women. The peach description has always been attribute to the butt in Japan not the vagina because not all vaginas look like the shape you're thinking of. I've seen instances where men refer to women's buttocks as pink like a peach or firm as a peach. Japanese peaches have a pink hue mind you.            This late already   fuck     Good to see this hasn't changed since I left.     This late already   Someone is imitating me  Fuck      Oh, I'm not professing to be some sort of vagina pro here. Just that that's been a metaphor for ages... like ancient Rome ages, and has butt-tons of examples in English literature.  Huh, I didn't think to question that it'd be different in Japan, but there you go. I appreciate the lesson. Now I wonder whether that's a pan-Asian thing: http://www.boredpanda.com/peaches-w<wbr>ith-lingerie-china/</wbr>       HIP CHECK HIP CHECK HIP CHECK  HIP CHECK   HOPE YOU DON'T LIKE GETTING CLOSE   HIP CHECK           like ancient Rome ages  Huh, I thought they were much more interested in discussing the peach-like nature of asses.  Words like "callipygian", and all that.  Their defining metaphor for the vagina was the sheath for their gladius swords, from which we get the word "cunt".         Oh good, people are using that. Looks like it was worth doing.   I haven't watched Doki but I want to cuddle Makopi.            I want to cuddle Makopi.  Makoπ is a qtπ.     So is Bukki.    Bukki is best girl in the series.

Onne blogger makes a point that lilies are used for 冠婚葬祭, which means 冠=ceremonies for an upgrade in social rank, 婚=marriages, 葬=funerals and 祭=appeasement of the spirits of the ancestors. Basically every kind of important ceremony. Chrysanthemum are also generally used and other white flowers (Callas, carnations, gladioli, etc.). Purple delphiniums are also popular. Of course they often use the flowers that the deceased liked too.  It may also depend on the religion: Buddhists and Shintoists use chrysanthemums, orchids and lilies. In Kansai, they also use the Japanese star anise. Christians use lilies.  Cluster amaryllises (Which name means "underworld/hell/funeral flower" in Japanese) were used in the past, but as far as I can tell by googling they are not used any more. The only half relevant result is a mother asking help to tell her little son that the flower she bought for her mother day is a bad one, and there are no images of funerals using them.           Translate Please!!!    Not sure where you get this idea that peaches represent vaginas when even in the west peaches have been used as a butt symbolism for centuries if not longer.  Even the Japanese use clams as a symbolism for vagina. NSFW but google あかがいエロ and you see what I mean.      Already translated in the previous thread.    That one is  here. Previous ones are  here.      It's a short synopsis of the next episode. "Princess vs Princess" and the other is a Twilight episode after. Literally nothing of importance is told. Wait it out.     Episode 22 actually tells pretty important stuff, like Twilight being fully redeemed already and more brainwashing incoming, crushing many anons' delusions of her remaining evil or "in a gray zone" after becoming Scarlet.    It's not important to those who would rather wait and see.    Those who would rather wait and see are not important either.      Guys stop being mean to each other       I don't think /pc/ could handle joshi wrestling.     Precure and pro wrestling might lead to too much erotica     too much erotica   Not following you.      You must have never seen a joshi match. Nothing erotic about it unless you get off of occasional blood and constant violence.    That sounds pretty erotic to me.     occasional blood and constant violence.  That is exactly like my love-making.    I want to die  Did someone say Pro Wrestling and Precure?   Please become Yuri's boyfriend first.      What's going on there? Video?    German Suplex    I can see that, but why are they doing it?    Why not?

How's Italy doing?   Maybe I just got used to design by now, but I think Scarlet in this pic doesn't look that bad.    So does that mean Balala will be buried by Precure now? Also how the fuck is China and Italy getting a dub but the US has to deal with Saban's 4Kids tier bullshit?    What kind of fighting style will she use? From her outfit it looks like it might be a long-armed Chinese style with wide, circular movements and chops.    Balala is more like a joke in the Chinese circle. Even little girls'd rather watch Madoka.    WHY DO I KEEP TRYING TO READ THE SPOILERS. IN EVERY SINGLE THREAD.     mean to quote     Is Scarlet going to have dealies on her legs to or will she go bare leg like Flora?     How's Italy doing?  Toei rescinded our distribution contracts. Or something. No more Precure for us. Also no more re-runs apparently. We've got up to HC (including the non-crossover movies) and that's it.    Who is the meanest Cure? I want to say Aguri. Majority of her run was her being a jerk to others then being all tsuntsun about it.     There will never be a Balala, Flower Fairy, or AK Magical Girls English subs      Toei rescinded our distribution contracts.   You have reliable source for this? I just kinda like the Italian dub even can't understand a single word. They sound like real professional actors to me.      She was only a jerk because Mana couldn't pull the trigger.

Please scan.    The guys from the Italian fan website emailed the guys at RAI (the ones who held the distribution rights) and inquired about whether or not they bought Suite since HC finished airing. They replied that Toei sold the rights for everything Precure to SABAN (American) and that they finished the number of re-runs they were allowed to show by their contracts.  They have no reason to lie about this so yeah... The article (in Italian) is here http://www.pretty-cure.it/2014/11/p<wbr>retty-cure-e-rai-fine-di-una-storia<wbr>-durata-8-anni/  They sound like real professional actors to me.  That's because we have actual dub schools and/or they take guys from theater and film acting. Not hobos from the streets like in Murrica.  </wbr></wbr>      But the animated version of Balala is pretty much a Precure clone.

Still terrible.    Something that lets her huge detached sleeves stream along behind her arms. So yeah.   Actual onscreen brainwashing.  Neat.    I've also just now learned all of Trio the Minor's names.   It hurts itself in its confusion!     Not hobos from the streets like in Murrica.  America is the land of freedom!

My nigga    harmony power    Are each of the Cures supposed to have a certain Princess theme to them with Scarlet being Eastern/Chinese? I suppose Flora is the fairytale European Princess and Mermaid looks Arabian, what is Twinkle supposed to be?      Actually, Aja Kong is fucking awesome too, she was always the one taking the insane bumps for her, especially all those blind and unprotected suplexes.

Just something nice and cozy would be perfect. Warm, cute, fun.  Reiterating what you already said.  Now lets look at your post at large. You posted this at the tail end of the WWD on Sunday. Double dipping is extremely frowned upon. The requesters that do double dip shoot themselves in the foot and get late or less deliveries.  So my advice is simple.

Draw my waifu in all kinds of adorable and cute situations. Draw my waifu in all kinds of cool and awesome situations. Draw my waifu in all kinds of sexy and lewd situations.

Requesting some more of Blade's Shimikaze in this outfit. Can be lewd or cute.   Beat me to it, amigo.   Are there other requests? I'm not feeling it with any of the ones already on the thread.

Even better if his power involves panties   Could someone draw a kawaii as fuck Avdol giving a thumbs up? I'll paypal you a whopping $6.   Big titty paizuri.    I'm gonna go with a generic answer then, I guess. Jojo related requests grab my attention easily, but I like drawing random girls too.    Not him but you the drawfriend who drew those shirtless guys? Cause I can either request something on those lines or request something related with Part 4    I'm the second shirtless drawfag, I just made a Diego.    Colored that Vert as Blanc thing.

Counter requesting her receiving injection from a syringe in her butt from a girl in a nurse's outfit with a crazed look on the nurse's face.   How about some monster girl requests?   How about monster gijinka girl?   How do you guys draw poses from imagination? Whenever I do it it always ends up like pure garbage, so I'm always looking at pose references.   Well, never mind, I don't want  anymore.  Can I get Akane as a spider girl?      sure, but I'm not to keen on the furry part, so it's probably gonna look like a regular monster girl with the features.  Spiders are scary. I realize I sound like a bitch.      Soon.   Is it Friday yet?       what is a "circle"?    By drawing from a lot of pose references and getting a feel for how the human body works and what poses are possible and attractive.  So you're probably doing it right for now.

Just make stupid sexy Natsuru even more sexy.    Do one of the Tokyo Mew Mew girls as their respective monster girl. Like:   Ichigo as a Nekomata   Minte as a Harpy   Lettuce as a Mermaid   Zakuro as a Werewolf   Purin as a Kakuen   Pick one, I guess.            Wasn't sure how to go about this, but here you go.    Do i have to be able to draw or can I just come talk?    So basically just keep drawing and eventually an instinct will develop. Just like almost every other thing in art.     Yep. No secrets, just the grind.   I think you're probably doing whatever you're trying to do wrong.       As a Echidna? http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Echidna</wbr>    Also, despite what I said here  In which I already had her on my list, I have moved all my efforts to the WWD.

Setting up stream. https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      The circle is more of a group of friends, rather than people who try to milk drawings off each other. If you come in with the thought of waifu trades, chances are you won't be added.  You can just come talk in the stream and make friends with people, it's quite fun.       2.5 days      I think you're probably doing whatever you're trying to do wrong.  Probably. He asked for color. I think I fucked up quoting, too. <br/>     oic. Yeah, you quoted right now. Nice coloring.    My bad. I think I copypasted the wrong link there.  Thanks though!      The sinister, conspiracytard term for when 2 or more drawfags are friends.  whats wrong with drawfags being friends?     Interesting. I'm surprised you went with a member of the Lamia family. Was thinking you would go for golem, dyrad, or another plant mamono.  Either way.  added to the list.       People get frustrated when their requests aren't filled, so when they see drawfags becoming friends and sometimes drawing for each other, they get frustrated and paranoid that the "circle" hates them, or that the circle is too busy drawing for each other to draw for anyone else, and think that's why they're not getting anything.    Can;t go wrong with lamias, though.    Why would a drawfag draw for another drawfag when a drawfag could just draw their own shit. I don't really get it.   As someone whos learning to draw, I'd rather try to draw my request myself than request it, im sure some other drawfags feel similar.       Seeing your waifu/OC/favorite character in someone else's art style is fun, especially if you especially admire that style. It's also a social thing, like buying lunch for the other drawfag.  Also, even really excellent drawfags tend to massively underrate their own work and overrate the work of others in comparison to their own (I can't draw eyes that well, therefore this other guy is better than me), so art trades often feel like a good deal even between equally skilled drawfags.      because I can't draw for shit and I like seeing people who can draw actually draw her. but not having a waifu means I never get to see her drawn. life is suffering.      Thank you very much for coloring the drawing anon it looks even better. Have a good one.     I like seeing people draw the waifu I don't have     Color: http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48121  I'm no good with color, and I don't like leotards, specifically this one, it kind of looks like a onsie.  I tried. Hope you like it.    </wbr>    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray). It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling. Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.     I pretend to have a waifu so people draw something for me.  I just miss having fun drawing stupid shit with friends, now all the people I used to do it with are either "artists" or don't give shits anymore.     Cute. Why didn't you post the color? Looks good.    That line going down her face and neck on the color version is triggering my autism     The irc is dead all the time  What are you even saying?      requesting Tamamo from FateExtra in this also more underboob art    im was bored, so here's a quick doodle. dont count it as a delivery though   Requesting color ref: http://imgur.com/a/gKT2l#0     I just spent the last hour skimming though the MG encyclopedia before I finally cut myself off, and holy crap that is a deep rabbit hole.     It's incredibly cute! Extra points for the dog!  Thanks so much!       Thanks draw friend! The very fact that your tried makes me happy. Theres no way I cant appreciate it!  The Gekota is a nice touch. Ashamed that it never even crossed my mind.   Thanks again!        I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live Both have mind-controlling abilities.    Some are pretty damn lewd.   Girtablilu is the lewdest imo.       You really do have to stop yourself, unless you want to develop a new fetish before it's too late.    monster girls with humanlike feet and claw toenails are the best   Here's a delivery for a request from a couple threads back.  Sorry, OR, I wish I had finished it yesterday like I said I would.  Eyeshield 21 kept sucking me in holy crap  I hope you like it though!      Manticore will never tear Kogasafag to shreds and feast on his flesh  Why live?    Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]    im not kogasafag    They probably wouldn't anyway. The wrt one would do is tease you into making you think they're gonna eat you, and then empty yu out.      Manticore will never tear Tanpopofag to shreds and feast on his flesh  Why live?     OR here, it's ok if you were a little late, but the coloring actually is nice, thank you and have a good night!  I think I'll probably add Eyeshield 21 to my watchlist.     No problem, I hope you have a good night as well!   You should read it instead, everyone's way more beautiful in the manga       Most of them are 2lewd4me   Posting the  delivery. I'm probably doing something else, I'm still streaming. Hope you like it brother.     Personally I like the cute and more innocent ones. The lamia and scylla coil themselves around their husbandos for days at a time which I find super adorable.   Please do a drawing of this  Requesting this, an illustration of her naked on a bed that has a lot of money on with with a few notes on her body.  Good evening and a To Love-ru request! Something lewd with young Mikado Ryouko (brown hair) and Tearju Lunatique (blonde). The pics on the left show their school uniforms  Also continuing with the coloring from yesterday   https://picarto.tv/live/channel.php<wbr>?watch=asocf</wbr>        Real cute.    Even if some descriptions are cute, I'm extremely tame when it comes to monsterizing my waifu. "Add-ons" like ears, tails, or wings are about as far as I'd go. No swapping limbs for non-human versions.    Bruh I have no idea if this is what you wanted. Hope you like it, and that it's what you wanted.      doesn't want a cyborg waifu  literally shit taste.     This is why I'm hesitant to draw unsolicited. A waifu is very special to the requester. I would hate to violate her in the mind of the requester. However like you mentioned. There are plenty that look very human.    Not sure about that neck twist though.    stream link?    Kind of shaft-ish huh, I hear ya, I'll take more care next time.  https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      I'd say as long as you keep it simple (tail, ears, maybe whiskers) most requesters will be fine with it.    Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal.  Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.    I don't even know why I'm doing this. Some dude already did it    Would someone be willing to draw Yukari Akiyama holding the m6 survival rifle?  Alright I can never pick so I'll just draw the next nonlewd waifu post after this.    Requesting Baron Ashura from Mazinger Z meeting Black Claw from Cutie Honey for the first time, both of them examining each other's strange appearance. http://imgur.com/a/Rb23o    Whoa now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Android girls are great. Does anyone have that scale of robot/human appearance? It wouldn't really be fitting for my waifu, but I could appreciate up to about an Aigis level.    asuka high fiving hitler      Jesus christ, I boned up the bottom half so hard I needed to crop it out.   Hello world to the general thread. Hope you won't mind me here.       Are you deliverin' anon? You're cool.     Welcome aboard! Looks really cute.

Maybe I'll grab one eventually           Thank you for drawing my waifu that one time. She looked really cute.   So after getting a delivery. Whats the rule again? Wait 1 week to request to give other people a chance?   Why do you want to rerequest, faggot?    In the general you are done with that particular request until the end of time.      I'm not talking about re-requesting obviously      A promise is a promise.    what if time is like a sphere and loops itself back?    Its good manners to wait til the next thread. As long as its not the same character you can request again. No one can really stop you.    Nice!    Err, why cant it be the same character?     requested high fiving   theyre holding hands  H-hitler-sama...  thanks man i love it!        There's no cooldown on your next request in the general. Several people have many requests up at the same time.    Cause people will know its you. Good to sleep newfag and requester tomorrow. These thread will still be around.   Requesting an apple dressed as your waifu   2015     not giving your waifu the gift of a baby    not turning her into your own personal breeding sow    not tenderly impregnating her   It's like you don't even love her, if you do request her carrying your spawn.        i want to die    Go right ahead    Adorable.

Since I'm the one doing the drawing and all    i love it Stronk thanks again for everything!!  ill try to color it maybe       Oh yeah and Mikoto's my waifu.

Yet again requesting the main couple of The Voynich Hotel posing for a photo; Elena wearing her Fuck Me shirt and Taizou wearing a Chking Hazard shirt.   ?? Anon.

Throw some more ideas around.    Working on it now.    wearing clothes too small for them, like old school uniforms, swimsuits    ayame would look the same though   Requesting Yayoi Kise struggling to draw  your waifu for you.   Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  Requesting ayame dressed like this<br/>   Requesting that, but with pic related.  erection bulge through the skirt thing encouraged    can someone do a version of this but with Ryougi Shiki and Saber?  Apologies to the OR for this color job, I don't feel like working on it anymore so no colored background.   zzz    dem funbags    If you're a boa, shouldn't you be going "sss" instead?

Regain your powers.   Requesting Hard Gay meeting Ninja Slayer. HG on one side introducing himself with a "Hoooo!" at the end, implied hip thrusts and sparkles and bubbles in the background, while on the other side NS introducing himself with the usual explosion in the background.  References just for the hell of it:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=HoOqhxJnMIU#<wbr>t=76</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=eI5UGAyYvss#<wbr>t=230</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  Shit quality for NS but that's all I could find on the tube.            [YouTube] Not Found    [YouTube] Not Found  Get your shit together, man.      I have a coloring question. What's the idea behind choosing the "dark" hair color? Adding black to the base color, or using color picker just doesn't cut it sometimes.  Is it something I just play around with?     Consider me officially jelly of Kirikafag    She's Chifusa     Okay, so monster girl delivery, Snake monster thing counts right? Also, more mature delivery, also also, bakemonogatari delivery. Also also also, wearing clothing not appropriate for their age. I hope someone is happy after alll those lol.     UNF We need more Milf drawings.    Requesting Tomoko in lewd Egyptian outfit.   Sure, but you could also learn a bit about color theory and how to pick colors. Or just copy the colors of your favorite illustrators and develop an intuition. Both are valid.      Requesting Ufo style Rin as a milf.     when you say color theory, you're talking about monochrome, complimentary, analogus, etc. as well as value, saturation, and tints?    If you really want to understand, I'd suggest reading through this at some point http://www.huevaluechroma.com/index<wbr>.php probably skimming past anything regarding paint mixing unless you plan on doing that.  Though if that's too much of a hassle, read this instead http://www.floobynooby.com/ICG/artv<wbr>alues.html no excuse there; read it through and through.  To give you the abridged version, adding black rarely cuts it. Making consistent shifts in tone in a certain lighting condition involves a change in the hue, value, and chroma/saturation, otherwise colors will look out of place and inconsistent. Adding black essentially just changes the value which, tends to kill the hue and saturation, leaving very washed out colors. Basic rule of thumb is that lighter tones will tend to yellow, whiter, and more saturated colors while darker colors will tend to blue, blacker, and more desaturated colors.  The trick to picking the right color is picking consistent colors that don't break how the saturation or hue is read in the picture while still establishing a coherent contrast between dark and light.  If you have sai, you can enable the HSV slider option on Windows tab which will tell you exactly each value for hue, value, and saturation.      </wbr>  </wbr>     S-shit, would just copy/paste my shit from the last thread. Thanks. Surprising though, the HG video was there for ages though for some reason most seem to have just been removed. Great fucking timing for this request I guess. In any case, managed to track one down here:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DiK<wbr>uOSasa7Q&amp;feature=player_detailpage#<wbr>t=77</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  As for NS there really isn't much on the tube so I guess I'll have to pass on this thread and make a webm or something by the next one. Hell, might make webms of both and be done with it. Either way, thanks again for pointing it out.        Why didn't you nerds tell me designing your own - tan was so much fun? 4 hours just disappeared into a worm hole.  TIME OVER I need sleep, it's 1 am  I'll finish this tomorrow   in the meantime  Requesting Erika Kurumi from Heartcatch Precure taking chibi Chaika home!! If you want to include mini Fredericka, go ahead!   ADIOS          What system do you drawfags use for animu esc facial and head measurements? I've been trying the five eye line but it gives to realistic results.   It's something you have to discover yourself, the joy of drawing shit then looking up and it's hours since you started. That happened to me just now too, started drawing a tan succubus flying about in her pajamas and where did the time go?    damn looking good colorfag  mfw Kirikafag is getting lots of deliveries and lots of love   im so god damn happy for him      is this how you drawfags look like when you draw lewd animu pictures?   Less blushing more neutral expression, since I drew it I know all the flaws too well for that kind of expression.    More like this.      you will never watch a drewfag raw ledw pictures while his facial expression slowly changes and he gets wet down there       and he gets wet down there     What do you think we drawfags are, some kind of beast? That we'd fall prey to our basest desires, that we'd stifle moans as we trace over our third primary layer to get the curvature of the breasts just right, erection straining against our pants as we paint shading onto the juicy inner thigh?    so what you're saying is you want to fuck me, and you want it now?and afterwards you want to draw it all?   Requesting Chiri in proper M1930 IJA uniform.   Requesting Yayoi  sexually  struggling to draw.    But that's wrong, anon. You don't sexualize the Precures.     Yayoi should eventually end up stroking herself with the pencil and getting off with it.    It's written right here, nigga.    I can't draw for shit. I did colour it, but it ended up looking terrible.    Requesting Ryona getting her body smashed into a wall please, as in being pushed into it with a great amount of force. something like this:  http://uploads.dragonballencycloped<wbr>ia.com/0/00/Goku_Smashed_Into_Wall.<wbr>jpg</wbr></wbr>     Who's that artist second from the right on the top row?    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=9762416</wbr>   bump  Requesting Haru dressed like Kanata   IT's fine looks pretty good as-is thanks asoc   My birthday is soon so I'm requesting Eila wearing a party hat   Damn this is really good, thanks drawfriend, the expression is cute and the tail looks really fluffy and huggable~ I wish there were more monstergirl  and lewd monstergirl  art of Natsuru, thanks again!    2 days    Do you have somewhere you post your stuff?    OR here.  That's a big sword.     Bump   Stop that fucking shit right now.    i assume you would want her dressed as alice like in the reference you provided    Does anyone here even want a pregnant waifu?    In a tasteful fashion, maybe    I'd actually like one.    Usually this.    I would, but I already have a lovely picture of her with a baby bump from pixiv so there's no need to request it.     2015   being autistic enough to treat your wifu like 3dpd gf replacement       2015   still having a 3dpd girlfriend      I don't, but I also don't think that wifu should be treated like one, it's just wrong and will lead you to nowhere.    I'd want to make her pregant, take responsibility, and raise our child together, if that's what you mean.   Requesting an anime version of "where do you think we are"   I don't know, I figure people can do whatever they want with their concept of waifu as long as it makes them happy.  I'm not delusional, I know she's an anime character, but more than that a psychological construct that fulfills certain emotional needs more efficiently than a 3D with her own emotional demands would. So in that sense, she is a replacement.  With the downside of not being very interactive, but what in life is perfect?  If I could have a wifubot made that spoke and acted and felt like a real being, I'd never look at 3D again. I'm selfish, I don't want the give-and-take of a relationship with another sapient being. Because in the end, what does that benefit you? Won't both I and my potential 3D wife be happier, more productive people if we have wifu/husbandobots and don't have to deal with each other's sometimes literal shit?  Is our love less real because its directed at objects that don't have the capacity to reject it? I say no.  Next 50 years are going to be fun, I'm glad I'm alive.             Pick a slut and draw her getting turned into a  sinless, pious nun    12 best girl   Wha.....what?    NOT AGAIN      streaming      streaming  Fuck off.       Why waste hard drive space on a show that can't even follow simple logic?      Why watch a show that doesn't satisfy you? Are you retarded?     I just wonder why you aren't thinking the following?  why have good visual quality for a show where I don't like the writing   why watch a show where neither visual quality nor writing are good      Logically correct.  Morally/ideologically wrong.  Are you fucking autistic?         Should be a new meme     implying it's hard to find proper 720p streams      resolution = quality  Are you serious?      implying resolution has anything to do with quality     dialogue for teenagers is too much for me     retard        How can I judge a show without watching it first?   No wonder you like, you can't follow common sense either          ideologically  Shirou has no ideology.     But you DID judge it you hypocritical shit.    If you wish to judge a show, why don't you pick a quality version of it?  When you try a new kind of dish, do you wait for it to get cold and empty your bowels on it before eating it?      streaming    <br/>      Please learn to contain your autism. The original critique was that the show doesn't even make sense to begin with, nothing about visual quality.      If you're content with eating shit, you get no right to complain about the show.    OP shitposting with best Nice koi  Fuck off. But yes Shirou's logic is absolutely retarded, and while I liked him when I first played the VN I hate him now.     Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama stated that  Super Saiyan God is in fact stronger than the new transformation Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan    At the end of Battle of Gods Goku released his God transformation but still retained some of its power, that was the basis for the new transformation, SSJGSSJ, so he wouldn't have to do the ritual again to get god ki, but it isn't as strong.   it's only a super saiyan with God ki   Akira also said Ssg is stronger because Red is better than Blue   he's going senile   http://kotaku.com/its-official-goku<wbr>-has-blue-hair-in-dragon-ball-z-169<wbr>6943056</wbr></wbr>            Red is better than Blue   Toriyama confirmed as an asukafag     Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?   Apparently Luffy's D will pierce the heavens?     2 other One Piece threads out there   starts a third!   Do you even know how to use the catalog?       Tomorrow? But chapters don't come out til thursday.    muh Doffyfags  fuck off already   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359  stop posting this unfunny bullshit    Lucci is a good boy   <strong style="color: red;">(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</strong>     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359   cancer       posted a total of once   cancer       It's a ban evader. Just check the ban page or the archive.  Mod already gave the poster a 30 day ban so it is only a matter of time before he gets an IP Range Ban.      Nigga I ain't even been banned before    do you?   What do you think this bastard is up to?   Taking Haki cocks up the ass    Hope the scene switches back to sanji at the end of the chapter.    Only one other OP thread and is reaching bump limit.  Do you even know how to use the catalog?      Sounds good.   I am sure he does not. Clearly that comment in no way showed any ability of using the said function...      reminder that one piece &gt;  two pieces    For a second I thought I read "beginning". That would be fucking cruel!    yfw Doflamingo had another pair of glasses and the arc goes on for another year   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359   The one piece is actually the murder devil fruit and it just lets you murder murder pistol everyone ever and they all die in a giant murder circle they're all dead except you,   AND THEN THERE WAS BLOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND THE BLOOD GOT EVERYWHERE EVEN ON A SMALL CHILD AND LITTLE DOG!!!!   IT WAS DANGEROUS TO GO IN THE WATER WITH A DEVIL FRUIT BEFORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD SINK BUT NOW ITS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BLOOOOOOOOOOOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND ALL THE SHARKS WILL COME SWIMMING AT YOU AND EAT YOU.   SOON EVERYONE GOT TIRED AND SENT YOU TO SPACE SO THAT YOU DONT GET BLOOD ON ANYONE ANYMORE AND THEN YOU EXPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODE   the scariest thing is that you have alreaady eaten the one piece and forgot...   now you are on a new adventure again to find the one piece...   love /x/, got you spooked ey.          Why is belly dance so hot?    we finally get to see his eyes next chapter   doffyfag tears  What, are you retarded ? Sure it's not a btfo thread but retardation wise it might as well be.        &gt;we finally get to see his eyes next chapter  What the fuck are you talking about?     His glasses fell off, silly.     glasses break last chapter   implying Oda won't reveal what his eyes look like next chapter     Doffy doesn't have eyes, he uses observation haki to see    It's not. It's the girl.     That'd be neat but I doubt it. He probably has plain, normal eyes. We know his right one is normal at the very least. Now the left one might be damaged somehow but we can't be sure.    His left eye is  a flamingo!    Doflamingo's glasses were actually a device to suppress his haki.   Calling it, his eyes won't be revealed yet, but Oda will tease us.    banned    Did anyone actually expect a shonen villain to win?    The time of teasing of over, Oda had his fun, now is the time for the reveal.    they do, sometimes    It sometimes happens, but just to allow the MC to come back fuck villain's shit backwards.     Crocodile won twice, Kizaru/Kuma won, Magellan won.     No but somehow retards in this thread make a confusion between being a Doffyfag and expecting him to win. Probably because anyone of average intelligence predicted Doffy wasn't out with just Redhawk.   What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?  They're probably kawaii circles.     It's not the destination, it's the journey       "D" pierces the heavens    Spoiler when?  Duh!   Doffy is Ruffy's father, obviously     I hope the penguinposter gets banned too    Exactly like pic related.    Shut the fuck up, Dentist anon is cool.    left one is missing    I hope shitposters get banned too     Say hello to Monkey  Drill  Luffy, anon.      What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?   photoshop Rocinante's eye onto Dofla   literally Zoro   This is why you're the master Oda        Because he can only draw three different faces?    Hopefully the entire board gets banned    MODS=GODS     (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)     i don't understand. what happened? did i miss something?    Press F5.    yfw Doffy gets up from that    What?    Exactly where luccifags belong     No I just want this shit to be over and stay that way.     HAHAHA SUCK IT LUCCIFAGS, WORST SAGA VILLAIN AFTER HODY    Followed by a sad, one page flashback of him shooting Rosinate, then fell back, unconscious. That would be good.    Quick, guys! Reply  with your best One Piece laughter!   no, like, why was he banned? i didn't see     Chronic shitposting.     This shit of villains being redeemed or feeling regret in some way needs to stop. If he gets up he should laugh and spill the 'secret'    But that hasn't happened in One Piece, has it? Except probably Moria's rant.    Just make the mods aware of the penguin poster and he will get banned as well.  Mods have banned attentionwhores before especially those that forced memes and also blog about their lives on /a/.  Penguin poster is an attentionwhore and also samefags his own replies as well and also tries to circlejerk with his equally attentionwhoring fanclub.          He was banned for constant ban evading.   Instead of waiting until his ban was over, the cancerous Luccifag kept evading his ban so now hopefully he gets a permaban.      Remembering when he used to be a woman and wondering if he will ever become Luffy's nakama    Doffy is such a step up from the older villains in every way, it would be disappointing if he 'fainted' and went to the background/Impel Down quietly following that fight like all the others.    Don't worry, Sugar will turn him into toy.   Reposting from last thread   Sweet sweet justice       Normal eyes with his left gouged out.      Thousand arrows ?! Zygarde is that you ?     aww, really? he'll be back within a day though. I can bet my leg on it.   Why is Usopp worst Strawhat?   Cause of his dick nose     Why the left one?     Why are you such a faggot?    But Sanji and Chopper are the worst.    We've seen his right one      I just wanted some pasta  ;_;       Luffy is worst strawhat. Usopp is best. Everyone else is good.    Shit I don't even remember that. Guess I'm a faggot    Ussop is best, Robin is mai waifu, and  Nami  is the worst    But Luffy is. He's literally the worst pirate of the worst generation.    so he's basically Zoro    Because he is a pathetic simpering coward  The only time he ever fought seriously was against his own captain over a broken ship and only because he knew Luffy wouldn't kill him.  The only fights he ever won were  1. Because he was so pathetic his self esteem actually could not get lower 2. Because he lost so badly that it startled Sugar   But he sniped sugar   Thats all            when do we get spoilers?   He fought seriously in Arabasta.    That wasn't solo    not as pathetic as Rebecca and her brain dead fans.      Oh shit, I didn't notice this.    But Usopp is the best Straw Hat, anon. He's well-written, almost always gets an interesting developing scene each arc, and has really grown a lot on his journey.  Brook is the worst. He has done jack shit since Thriller Bark aside from pointless singing and beating those godawful skulljokes to death.   b-but he beat Jora!  Wow, he sliced up the fat lady whose power is making art. Truly he is the most useful crew member.         I hate to admit it, but you're right. He was so cool in Thriller Bark but he doesn't do much now    While I don't hate Brook, I definitely think he's the "worst" one. Sounds kinda harsh, but Oda needs to go with him somewhere.    m8 he saved Usopp and Zoro on Fishman Island with his new ghost ability   I don't know if I want this arc to finish, because I fear we will get another fisherman island shit arc again afterwards.   Brook is the one who still has to be developed.  Also, he's been totally alone for +50years, he's just not used to interact with people yet. I hope the Wano saga will help him finding his new self (at least his soul was in Ryuma's dead body in thriller bark, i hope it's something)      things like this don't count for fightfags    I'm hoping that Wano being a samurai country will open up for more character development for Brook.    If the New World really is paralleling the first half of the Grand Line, then the next arc will be the "Skypiea".   yfw Oda randomly sends the crew to another sky island for 2 years        he doesn't do much now  he was the most crucial character in this arc     True I realised I was replying to marineford babbies, also I just remembered Brook sometimes drops quite a few knowledge bombs about the world.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110374  GO DIE AGAIN SKULLHEAD!    Haha I have deleted the failed spoiler attempt before I could be massively flamed for it    Neither the opponents.    lolwat    fairy nuff    because of him the fucking toys turned back and without him Luffy and Law would have been turned into toys and everything would have gone to hell    The people who are going to get the most character development in Wano are going to be:   Zoro   Brook   Kinemon   Momonoske   At least I hope they will.            Kyros was actually, the one toy with free will and knowledge of what really happened to convince the Tontattas and Usopp into action    Hello animefag here, how far behind the manga is the anime? While I like Dressrosa I'm starting to get a bit tired of it.     (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)      and he turned the coliseum fighters to the SHs side     &gt;Momonoske   mfw       still watching the anime   about 30 chapters      Brook is the best Strawhat you faggot.     liking Momonoske     Thank you.          You know what? You can just fuck off and die.    Momofag pls go.    Putting that aside so far he's only been shown to be a spoiled whiny kid I think.   anyone got anything else like this?   BASED ODA BEING BASED    So his real grandfather is Chinjao?    triples confirms that Doffy was Zoro's puppet, who used it for training Luffy    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110998  I...I...I h-had no clue this was a thing!    Zoro is Doffy's doppelganger. That's why he knew the bird cage could be stopped.   Sanji is Kamina, thatisall https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qXX<wbr>8Zh8TNdw</wbr>  [ ]     And people were like so underwhelming those last attack, no clues why thoses attacks would have been that great bc first time used etc    Spoiler when?

Oh wait, you mean this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0t_<wbr>dSGlLC94</wbr>  [ ]     They're just gonna be two dots.    There are actual fans?   Is Doffy dead now?   He lost his left eye as a sacrifice for awakening his df    Buried alive.     has a based dream   stood up to Chu   almost wrecking Luffy's shit   rampaging through Enies with giants   sniping from the tower of justice  Usopp is a best  but he hasn't really done anything notable since Enies           took down Sugar twice      he hasn't really done anything notable since Enies   Did you even read Dressrosa?       If he would get his shit together like he did against Luffy he'd be based as fuck.     but he hasn't really done anything notable since Enies  He awakened his haki.    http://www.sentinelandenterprise.co<wbr>m/breakingnews/ci_28362171/don-feat<wbr>herstone-creator-pink-flamingo-lawn<wbr>-ornament-dies   ODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   </wbr></wbr></wbr>    but he hasn't really done anything notable since Enies   Fucking speedreaders. Not just on Dressrosa but he even sniped Buffalo and Baby 5 during Punk Hazard but people always forget that.       Not just on Dressrosa but he even sniped Buffalo and Baby 5 during Punk Hazard but people always forget that.  you mean Cesar?       Sugar was just a rehash of the Chu fight, but considerably more pathetic     It doesn't matter whether the fight was pathetic, what he 'did' was certainly of note.  I mean, most of Dressrosa is calling him God now and he awakened his CoO.       I wish.   So, only like one in a million people is supposed to have conqueror's haki, but the suddenly every other person seems to have it. I find that a bit annoying.    It's more that those one on a million are all gathered in the same place.   That's how the NW is.       But that is silly. Like, does anyone who posesses it just feel like going to the New World?    Those who have Conqueror's haki are bound to be the top dog, and thusly will butt heads more often with other top dogs.     8 People   6 left   Everyone has it        Those with it are stronger leaders - they inevitably end up there.     It was all of them, shooting rocks at Baby 5 and Buffalo while the handcuffs land on Caesar.    chosen one fags in a nutshell.     No, but the ones who make it there are more likely to have said powers. Its basic fucking logic.  Also why do people think doffyfag people are going to be upset? I said from the start that there is no way in fuck that luffy will be able to 1v1 or even really 2v1 doffy. And all of your cuckboys denied it. And guess who was right. Me, a doffyfag. Luffy need law AND all the citizens of dressrosa to buy his ass time just to knock out dofla. He was never going to be strong enough to 1v1 someone as strong as doffy. Get rekt shitters.      Will Zoro have conq haki? I mean, Rayleigh has it.    He hasn't shown it so far, but who knows.   inb4 Ashura haki retcon.       That's like saying that a 140+ iq is 1 in a million and then wondering how everyone in mensa seems to be that 1 in a million.    Assuming OP has 8 billion people like we do that's 8 thousand people with conqueror's haki     Doubt the OP world has 8 billion (probably not even a billion), but there should certainly be a reasonable amount.     How the fuck does six people equate to   every other person has it     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N-U<wbr>TMrbo6vw</wbr>  [ ]  This deserves more views      act like a retard , like every main/villian ever   he needs law and other people hurrr     BTFO T F O     robin eyes confirmed    doffy is blown through the colliseum into the scrap yard, or trash heap, or however it was called   Fucking pottery.       strong enough punch to level the city itself   doesn't even put a scratch on Doflamingo's body even though any busoshoku haki he was using was most likely deactivated the second he was hit and lost consciousness  Either Doflamingo is still alive and kicking or that's just not how bodies and physics work      DEEPEST LORE  ODA = GOD      Looks like the ground collapsed into the scrapyard along with Doffy.     YFW he's still standing although barely and Rebecca finishes him off hailing back to how she told Luffy she'll defeat him at the beginning of the arc.   Please, no.        implying Law won't kill him while everyone is happy   CRAWLING IN MY SKIN        raises again after punch   not a scratch on his body   "looks like I'll have to use THAT"   activates eye power          activates eye power   another Rayleigh flashback   It didn't work huh   What will you do now Luffy?          Today I will defeat Doflamingo!   That would be one of the biggest trolls in manga history if Oda makes her words come true. Thankfully, she's shit so it won't. Would be worth it for the reactions though.        Madara obliterated the entire cast    Being this fucking new.   So does anyone know where I can read updated One Piece Party chapters? There's supposed to be this chapter where Luffy was asking Law if he had a tattoo on his penis, too...   Finally!     that pic   I will cry like a bitch that day     Daily Reminder:  Doffy's real face revealed     For a sec I thought you meant Gorilla.    It's because they're being funneled towards the New World/One Piece, isn't it? Those who take notice of their Conqueror's Haki are people with strong ambition, and it seems that everyone's goal is to either conquer the seas (which means going to the New World to fight the Yonkou, I guess) or getting to One Piece (and thereby becoming Pirate King?).    Nah    literally who?    why did this but not luffyfag/doffyfagfag not get banned?    The 'superficial' Red Hawk left more of a mark on Doffy's stomach than Leo Bazooka.   King Kong hit his face, besides blood that won't leave a mark at all unless Doffy is the new Duval.       Surprising that a hot body has created a legion of fans regardless of skill or talent   Do you even real life?      Holyshit Luffy actually killed him. Doffy is dead, no way he's still alive after taking such a hit.   Where has lucy been this entire arc? He was killing it in the coliseum and then disappeared all of a sudden. He had potential to be a powerful ally for the crew.    haha this meme is really funny just like the really super funny iroquois plisken jokes haha lol haha     Over 15 years of you people.   Goddamn.       speedreaders   He was revealed to be Sabo all along months ago, and hes fighting Xusasu Basasu atm.      that song is fucking magnificent. a rush of memories from those cherry blossoms and dr. hiriluk dying.   So...when is she coming back?   Ceaser killed her you meme loving fuck   Ugh incoming Mansherry healing all the Dressrosa buildings like nothing happened    In almost 20 years only Ace and Whitebeard were killed   I don't believe it, anon. I simply don't.      Shortly.Currently aiding the Sanji side after hiding closeby.    She is dead anon get over yourself    Fucking spoilers you cunt    You know that there is no OP this week right?      The only real argument anyone could provide for her death is if killing Monet and Vergo was supposed to "balance" out the victories between "good and evil" and I don't know if Oda would actually do anything like that. And that's the ONLY argument that has any ground at all.      Everyone in the thread is talking about the latest chapter you retard. Why are you complaining about spoilers now?     The argument is that her heart got stabbed.  She didn't get bombed or anything which everyone in OP seems to be impervious to.       As I said, deaths to equal Ace and Whitebeard's (which they don't) are the only ground. Period.    Shut the fuck up    which page is that?    From tommorow chapter    From the recent chapter    looks like the first page, if you meant that     Getting this mad  your autism is showing  tomorrows chapter        I'm sorry anon     Last page of last week's chapter. They forgot to publish it.    im still mad that megahouse hasnt done a POP yet, they make so many stupid and unnecessary ones, but they didnt do her  mad      epic mene    fuck you for spoiling me dude       Where's the rest?       thats chapter 791 it comes out tomorrow    Can Jinbei please die or fuck off so we can have Koala join instead?      ah, thanks    Haha nice meme reaction but it doesn't exclude what you did.. Single handedly ruined OP for me, i'm on impel down atm. If I got my hands on you...     implying Rebecca isn't the one who is going to join     Hey, guys, remember that one time when Oda blew our minds, like in pic related?    nah, I liked doffy and Im just angry at how his dumbed down his character seemed during this arc. for a master puppeteer, he was pretty straightforward.  and hell this arc was full of stupid shit, not just from mingo. Just the death of trebol is so mindboglling retarded. (huur Ill just put myself in melee range of law, surely nothing bad could happen).  Overall the fights this chapter reek of bad writing (except franky vs señor, that one was godly)       So, only like one in a million people is supposed to be able to run the 100 mt in less than 10 seconds, but the suddenly every other person competing in the 100 mt run at the Olympic Games seems to be able to do it. I find that a bit annoying  your argument basically       hating on Jinbei  Why?     she's fucking dead, Jim      Kill yourself tripfag      then why are you reading a One Piece thread?      goes in One Piece thread   only at ID   doesn't expect spoilers        I'm not the tripfag he just reposted my image, it's not even my original OC some dude on reddit found it.    I know  I'm just quoting him about your post so he will know that he's just another reposting faggot who didn't read the thread       Implying it ain't Kyros.  Luffy still needs to get his bronze statue which is on Dressrosa depicting him. Kyros was the Tin Soldier. Bronze consists also of tin.       Why would Kyros leave Dressrosa?    Can we all agree that Monet has the best voice? It's beautiful.     had   fix'd       I like one piece so i thought you guys could talk about it and you know USE THE SPOILER TAGS MAYBE? christ...     He probably saw the image on the wiki since I posted it there too.     Nah fuck you.      Replying to yourself to pretend you're trolling people  Sad       Don't ask me.Just noting Luffy said he wants a Bronze Statue on his ship and it took until Dressrosa til we got it and the guy depicted on it running around for a while consisting of the major non-copper ingredient of Bronze.  Oda shenanigans perhaps.I mean, considering Viola has an attack referring to iron as well.      You are a dumb nigger for thinking that. Go to Reddit if you don't want shit spoiled.     AHAHAAA &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/ &gt;&gt;&gt;/myanimelist/  You're a fag.          hhhehehehe    you are a idiot, ofc we are going to be talking about the latest chapter in here.  if you want a place without "spoilers" go to some forum and make a thread marked as such.       Where do you think you are you double nigger.     no more Madam Shyarly   barely any fanart   This is suffering.      nah i answerd          You know what guys, as remorseless as you are u really did ruin this for me. At least I found out  itachi died  while reading it and not from this shitty board. You see that's a proper use of spoiler tags.          you are retard. then everything should be between spoiler tags, because what if a guy appears who just started to read chapter 1    He's boring as fuck and Koala inheriting his position as Strawhat while learning Tiger's last words and final wish about her from Jinbei would be far more interesting and meaningful.     spoiling old as shit stuff from shitty series.   so much cancer.        u really did ruin this for me   At least I found out Itachi died    This faggot is the gift that keeps on giving.   P.S. I fucking know.           why are there two Luffys?    you must really hate people with religious signs    jesus dies   for your sins           jesus dies  But he's still fighting against Sabo, m8!     needs a vergo version with properly placed food    hhhhohohohoho    Dude I hope you're not trolling, these threads always have spoilers for the next chapter before it comes out. If you don't want to see spoilers then just come back after the chapter is out like the rest of us who want to avoid it.   You know what excites me the most about the few weeks?  We're getting to post-arc world building and pre-arc build-up time. Always loved the "HEY LUFFY THIS IS HAPPENING WHILE YOU WERE DOING SHIT IN THIS ARC" exposition that adds much to the world and then followed with a montage of what the other people are doing around the world. Potential of bounty increases, new developments, maybe a new  nakama  among others.  That said, we're still going to get the final bits where the locals tie up loose ends with each others drama, followed by the BIG victory party chapter to which where we get to the juicy shit.  Looking forward to that.          Might not even get much of a party this time due to the situation with the other SHs.     People pretending they don't know 790 is out or retards that actually don't know      dude, you just triggered the newfag, again!      Well, Tiger was definitely referring to the Strawhats (from an author standpoint) when he said it's the next generation, the children like Koala who can save the Fishmen.    I have come from the future anon and I'm here to tell you that.   Aokiji dies from Blackbeard and Coby will get his fruit.  Reverse Mountain is Where ONEPIECE is at and Crocus has been defending it the whole time.  A coup d'eat will be led by Coby, Smoker and Garp in the final war and they will team up with the revolutinaries and luffy along with defectors from the World Government.    Zoro dies in chapter 944 faggot             Amen people around me are wondering why I'm so excited but they don't' read One Piece so they don't understand the excitement about all the upcoming heavy exposition scenes we are going to get.      yfw Momo is the actual Wano Shogun and got turned into a kid by Bonney      eh     Doffy's head tilted backwards   FUCK        Enies lobby had the best post-arc.  So much fun, yet a lot of stuff that was revealed that set the stage for a whole lot more.  Let's hope this post-arc does the same, or at least something similar.        The only thing I hate about him is the way he pussied out with the Dwarves. He was legitimately running away after establishing his bravery on the Boyn Islands. Next time he tries some shit like that, I hope the consequences are dire and permanent.  And that's when he finally stops being cowardly. One of the Straw Hats are gonna die because of him.  But otherwise, he redeemed himself tenfold with Sugar and developing Premonition Haki.   Are you admitting Rebecca's likely to be a Straw Hat? That's the first step, friend.           大丈夫でしょうか。    How fucking strong is BB if he was capable to injure Shanks before he got DF power?    probably snuck up on him honestly. Of course this could have been before shanks learned haki        post enies lobby   oh boy, that was some exciting chapters   Garp reveal   Dragon reveal   New World namedrop   Coby and Helmeppo back post-training   Ace vs BB and the foreshadow of the big shit that's coming   Whitebeard and Shanks appearances   new bounties   Franky joining   Usopp's apology and rejoining   All in short span of chapters. I'm looking forward to a nice short arc, goddammit.                    probably snuck up on him honestly  nope, Shanks himself said when he got that scar it wasn't a surprise attack      The only thing I hate about him is the way he pussied out with the Dwarves. He was legitimately running away after establishing his bravery on the Boyn Islands.   Honestly I see his lying and cowardice being a core part of his character, the day he isn't being a coward is when he truly becomes a brave warrior of the sea.   Also there's a great quote from Game of Thrones for Usopps situation:   'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'    'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.”    Without showing at least some cowardice it could be hard for the readers to tell where Usopp is at in terms of accomplishing his dream. Especially for the young kiddies reading the manga.               Shanks himself said when he got that scar it wasn't a surprise attack  pulling shit out of your ass now?     It was really shitty the way he would insist he was the captain for so long. Being an unfunny comedy relief and a worthless sniper did not help. He's become slightly better but is ultimately just a gardener that forgets he got buff.    Yep, that's why Monet and Vergo are still around.     And it's not like I was careless or anything.       that doesn't imply what you're implying     worst strawhat    not Robin  WHAT THE FUCK DOES ROBIN EVER DO       TITS      The argument is that her heart got stabbed.   Snow being stabbed   Doing anything   You really don't understand One Piece or logia at all, do you?         I was going to argue how stupid that pic is but then I realized that it is actually all true.     fuckin lol'd    Not him but it implies that Shanks was actually trying and being serious in their fight     That's why there was blood huh.     Admittedly, I did say he redeemed himself later on. But rereading that chapter, I got angry. But after Dressrosa, he's gonna have his 8000 followers. And he has Haki now. He's got so much power on his belt at this point and I don't want to see that untapped.    Fucking stop please.    Plot things that will come up later. Be among the most amusing interactions with the crew. Use her fruit to do stuff sometimes. Far more useful as a member then brook.    Yeah she's definitely dead just like Wiper, Enel, Connis, Pagaya, Igaram, Pell, T Bone, Paulie, Lucci, Spandam and Bon Clay right?  Oh wait they are all alive when they shouldn't be.      twintails Nami is best Nami     Not saying whether she is or isn't.      they shouldn't be  take your fucking asspulls away from here!    Does nami like Anal from luffys kong dong?    Snow doesn't leak a bit sometimes   Again, it doesn't matter. I bet you won't even apologize when she comes back.       implying she would use condoms     it was just frozen strawberry juice      snow doesn't leak a bit sometimes   Snow isn't blood though.  Also not saying whether she's dead or alive - just that her heart being stabbed is a legit argument.    Oh shit.              or that's just not how bodies and physics work  you are aware you are reading a battle shounen where logic and physics are not really like they are in the real world, are you?     It does.   Does Nami please old men for money?     Yes, (Y)OHOHOHOHOHOHO      nope    just ask the Weatheria scientists    characters do not have "to do" something or have to fight all the time to be good, what makes Robin charming is her personality and her attitude    Doing something to them means they have to fill a role on the ship or they have to have a fight every damn time.  Don't argue with them, they don't read One Piece.     Based GOda   Yes. Go away, you look beaten with your opinion.   Reminder to not reply to hellofag.

Seems rather odd, from Sugar and Van Der Decken we've been shown that active df abilities stop when a user loses consciousness, I suppose Doflamingo could still be awake, but seems unlikely.     It is [netabare] of 791 dress stories (the jump No.31).    Inspection attention of final Bale.     791 dress [netabare] fixation    At the beginning, [dofuramingo] put to large [saruoujuu] of [rufi] (King Kong cancer).    Sunglasses come off, and the earth is deep while having lost consciousness and [heto] drops.     Fuel:    791 dress [netabare] fixation (2)    791 dress [netabare] fixation    The people who watch match keeping their breath.     [Rufi] to run out of breath"[Haa;] … [haa;]"    However, it did not end by this.     [Gogogogogo] etc.    791 dress [netabare] fixation (3)    "Bird basket" has not stopped yet even if [dofuramingo] is knocked down.                             Not really. It still stands Doffy could beat Luffy in a 1v1 fight, and we all know he's not gonna die.   Unless it's confirmed he ded. No doffyfag is BTFO.       Bird basket   Top kak      That's literally just them narrating what happens in the single leaked page, this isn't hot news    That plus  Yonko introduced   Shanks and Buggy revealed to be on Roger's ship   Conqueror's Haki re-introduced     All in short span of chapters. I'm looking forward to a nice short arc, goddammit.  As eager as I am to see characters return and big plot developments to happen, I kind of hope Zou/Wano are isolated from the rest of the world. I fear Oda is pushing all the big events too close together. Luffy's been in the NW for a week and has angered two Yonko, defeated a Shichibukai, befriended another, 5 Supernova have ties to immediate upcoming storylines, a new Admiral was revealed, and Luffy has made a ton of future fleet allies and 2 territories under his future protection.  I want a breather so things don't get rushed. I hope its another Thriller Bark              Doffyfag tears   implying  there's literally nothing to drink, no tears are shed because we all know that oda has to progress the plot somehow - in reality, without plot armor and in a straight 1v1 doffy would bitchslap luffy so hard he'd need another 2 years to be babbied by rayleigh in order to stand anything of a chance.      buttmad doffyfag detected  You cwyin doffyfag?  Mad your shit character is defeated?  Yeah you cryin           bird basket   Also it took the entire city + a bunch of strong pirates to even stop it. Doffy is too strong.  why didnt he just bird cage luffy and law in mini bird cages?      CP zero will finish Doffy, or Burgess    I hope its another Thriller Bark  you mean a boring arc? we already had those in FI and PH      Tons of Doffyfags in denial who think the fight isn't over  His glasses fell off, Jump confirmed that the last chapter was the conclusion  He's done, idiots.         Nope. Like I said, as long as he's alive after this arc I'm good.      This He will be all beaten up and He will get shot many times (since he like to use a gun to finish people it will be poetry). His fruit will appear at some random house and in the party will be eaten by Rebbeca      projecting  nigger I know the fight is over, doffy is done but you have to realize it took a gangbang on top of asspulls just to bring him down enough to a level where luffy could stand a chance  that's the great part about doffy, even oda knows he'd smack luffy's shit in 1v1      Looks like there is a 2nd one out.  キングコングガンで 　ドフラを倒したルフィ  　大地を割り、地面を突き抜けて 　地下へと落ちていくドフラ  　その時、鳥かごの糸が解除される  　ドフラが完全に倒したと歓喜する 　ドレスローザの人々  　空中のルフィのギア４が解ける 　ルフィが落下していく  　サボがそれに気付き 　バージェスとの戦闘を放棄し 　ルフィの元へと走りだしていく  　ルフィが地下へと落下寸前で 　ローがシャンブルズで救出  ・藤虎と話しているゾロ 　 　ハックにおぶさったウソップが 　中心街へ向かう  　喜んでいるトンタッタ達 　その脇で寝転がるフランキー  　ルフィに号泣しているレベッカ 　お礼を言うヴィオラ  ・地下では割れたサングラスの横で 　倒れている白目のドフラ  　ドフラの左目は暗く影が掛かっており 　見えなくなっている                                          gangbang   The only people who actually fought Doffy were Luffy and Law.  The other people just helped Luffy run away and stop the birdcage         In King Kong Cancer Luffy defeated Dofura  Divide the earth, it can penetrate the ground Dofura to go down to the underground  At that time, birdcage of yarn is released  It will delight and Dofura was completely defeated People dress Rosa  It solved the air of Luffy of gear 4 Luffy is going to fall  Sabo is noticed it To abandon the battle with Burgess Go out running into Luffy of the original  In Luffy to the underground falling brink Rescue rows in Shambles  · Fujitora and talking are Zorro  Is Usopp you Obusa~tsu to hack We headed to the city center  Tontatta who willing Frankie plops itself down on its side  Rebecca you are crying to Luffy Viola to say thank you  - In the underground next to the sunglasses cracked Dofura of fallen are pewter  The left eye of Dofura is hanging is dark shadow It has become invisible                                         She is on revolutionary paycheck, dude.    I fucking knew the eye would be a cliffhanger.  What is with Oda taking 2 chapters to deliver on everything lately?     This reads like a postmodern poetry.     It has become invisible  moria confirmed  I bet you anything moria is going to appear in the next 2-3 chapters in setup for kaido       I was down with your suggestion from the start, but after looking at the 'spoilers', I'd like to see this:  Rebecca sees him moving, nearing death   Takes a blade or something else sharp   Walks over to him, ready to kill   The photographer for the wanted posters nears in, witnesses the murder and snaps the shot of her when he gets a nice view   Rebecca's hands are now dirty, like her father's   Next thing you know, bounty, realization and sudden initiation to the Straw Hats.            people dress Rosa   l-lewd      Alternative translator  [Rufi] that knocked down [dofura] due to King Kong cancer   [Dofura] that divides the earth, pierces through ground, and drops underground   At that time, the string of the bird cage is released.    When [dofura] completely knocked it down, it is people of dress Rosa who rejoices.    [Rufi] that can undo gear 4 of [rufi] in the air falls.    Cutting notices it.    The combat with Burgess is abandoned and it begins to run to the origin of [rufi].    It rescues it in Shambles underground and immediately before the fall [rufi].    Me-too drug spoken with [fujitora]   [Usoppu] to ride on Huck heads for the mainstreet.    Pleased [tontatta] Frankie who sleeps [sono] sideward and rolls   Viola that means Rebecca reward to cry bitterly to [rufi]   In the underground, it is [dofura] of the white of the eye that falls on the side of the cracking sunglasses.    The shadow darkly hangs and has disappeared to the left eye of [dofura].                    Implying Dragon would mind a revolutionary to sail the seas with his son.  If anything I'd say he'd welcome that to keep an eye on Luffy.      Wanting Rebecca   No, what the fuck is wrong with you? Honestly, who do you think you are?  She has Vivi syndrome anyway, she can't leave her father and people. End yourself.        No he will appear without warning midarc like Sabo, Law, Jinbe, probably right before shit gets crazy     why didnt he just bird cage luffy and law in mini bird cages?  Right, because Law or Luffy would just be standing there waiting for a small mini-cage to entrap them.   Seriously unless you're a goddamn retard, I doubt anyone would just stand there and let that happen. Birdcage seems like it'd only work on a larger scale when the people he's trapping are oblivious to what's going on.      Just realized   Luffy's father is the first in command  Luffys adoptive brother is second in command        His other was too.     it's not for money, it's for SCIENCE!!!!!!!1     "D" pierces the heavens!!     Viola was the princess, not Rebecca. End yourself for talking about something you know nothing about.     If we go by division numbers, Ace was 3rd in command and Marco was 2nd     True, but he was still the Second Division Commander I guess.     So was Ace  So is Garp ( I think)     Maybe Garp is the mastermind?    what, sit down boy, hes fucking defeated, just saying those guys may kill him.  you gotta control your autism     So, what's the next one ?   Speaking of Autism, does Doffy have it?   Seems to contradict the other one that says the bird cage is still up, I suppose it is early for spoilers so take any of these with a massive grain of salt?    Doffy will be imprisoned or whatever and then later rescued by loyal supporters believed to have already been dealt with. Clearly Vergo and Monet, it all fits.  Obv      Huh...that actually does seem like something that could happen.   Doflamingo's cell...EMPTY!!?   But how...?   Shot of the three of them           He used Land's Wrath in the same chapter.  Is this based on something?       Well it's either that, or it's Moria - seeing the word invisible turned my attention to Absalom.      Children will eventually leave their parents, Rebecca was never treated well by 'her people' her mother relinquished her ties to the family to marry Kyros so I don't think she can take the throne even if she wanted to, especially with Riku still alive and Violet who would make for a better ruler having damned near omniscience on the entire island.   Hey guys, I have a theory that rufi only defeated a clone of doflamingo, what do you think?   Oda isn't Kishimoto    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HOC<wbr>ANR1lmHI</wbr>  [ ]    He literally defeated a fish man 3 times stronger then him in eastblue, defeated the strongest borque works agents, helped disrupt god enels wrath, saved robin from aokiji, saved robin from spadman, defeated perona who could have koed the entire crew, stopped bby 5 and buffalo from taking cc, defeated sugar twice literally screwing doffy over big time     Meant more to do with his 'techniques'.  Ashura is implied to be an evidence of swordsmanship - similar themes shown by Vista, Mihawk and recently Kinemon.  But just wait as Oda turns it into a special kind of haki.         The fat one is the fake one post-TS. He's fatter, he has messier hair and a fake hat.      one piece dying    hot girl dying    not a flash back    oda is the author   Are we reading the same manga       Spoilers here  Luffy out of air   shrinks and fell   Room   Law switches him with a fucking huge rock   rock fells directly onto Doffy   DD rekt, birdgcage disappears   Law won and saved the country   Luffy is lying asleep next to him   no chapter next week             Riveting tale chap.    If Law wins, that means fujos win which means everybody wins   Lucci is a good boy indeed    luffy shrinking after timeskip     it's a fucking poem     fujos win   means everybody wins  I smell something fat behind this post.      shrinking from G4 to his original form    MODS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!    when will Monkey D. Lucci return?    Sorry you got banned for what I started.    It's good to see there's atleast some vague semblance of a part of a good moderator left on 4chan somewhere.     <br/>     remember how law can teleport?   So, I'm slow as shit and didn't realize there was colored one piece. Where's the best place to read it with color? Going to go through the whole series again.   batoto     http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004  there may or may not be some gaps and it only goes up to chapter 700 since not everything is colored yet, but this is the fullest list that I know of.  </wbr>     Oda said a long time ago that ashura was his willpower, long before he introduced haki      willpower   Uh-oh.       Readmanga don't fall for potato spam     but chapter 700 is the last one there     Trebol's a simple guy. Doffy always was a violent psychopath. He thinks his backstory is fucking sad and not something he caused. That's how fucking deluded he is.    still not an excuse to not use clone more often for trickery purposes     Kubo?      Just the death of trebol is so mindboglling retarded. (huur Ill just put myself in melee range of law, surely nothing bad could happen).  All of Mingos Top executives jobbed hard as fuck. How the fuck can Franky not beat Senor Pink when he can fucking kill a Pasifista     using clones requires stamina. even he is badass his stamina isn't unlimited. plus he needed to manage bird cage and parasites too.     when he can fucking kill a Pasifista    Lucci a good boy  Who has best laugh? and why is it Burgess?   Seconded. Where to read chapters 700+?    from Ishibumi's blog  The BD's for S3 will be coming with a 6-part novel called "Highschool DxD EX"  We don't know how it fits into the timeline, but this may be a preview at the sequel to the series.   God from another world   4th user of Durandal   Black haired boy that uses lightning   RED HAIRED BOY WITH DRAGON AURA   Brown haired Angel with Dragon wings   Asia-kaasan   In xx years from now, a big war will occur.   The title:  High School DxD EX -- Crimson-haired Sekiryuutei --   Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?                   Issei dies   Saji becomes MC   How would /a/ feel?      Heads up.  Ishibumi was inspired to do this because of Naruto Gaiden.    Shit series, don't care.  Eh, probably a "what-if" alternate universe plotline   From what I read on the blog, it sounds like some time machine Azazel created.    It's most likely a teaser for a sequel after DxD ends. That's pretty fucking hype.  Info I gathered from the quotes I could understand:   Azazel says this is the telling of the forbidden story.   In xx years from now, a big war will occur. Some of those who have been imprisoned achieved a revival. - Mysterious boy with black hair that uses lightning   Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  One of the quotes is from him, so no.  Hopefully Code-Zero'll get on translating this pretty soon.               Ophis better be in it or else my interest will fade quickly.    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  good isseis hair fucks me off   So, what happened to the side stories being adapted to anime form? Was that a troll?   They're coming in each Dx vol it sounds like. Riser ova coming in December with Dx.2    The OVA "Unresurrected Phoenix" is with Dx2.  This 6-part Novel is with the BD/DVD Volumes.  Each season there is a 6-part Novel included with the CDs.  I don't know what Season 1's is.   Season 2 is about Issei having a date with every member (yes, including Gasper and Kiba) of the ORC in a single day            Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura  Kiba is the father      Kuroka and Koneko also confirmed to have Issei's kids    DX.2 isn't out until December anon, it's not a troll.       It sounds like Issei is having Kiba train the kid.    nah Kiba must have sneaked in the night and took a bite at buchou     Kiba wanting anyone over Issei     The kids came from the future.  He most likely is already dead at that timeline. The title is Crimson-haired SEKIRYUUTEI after all.      MC dead his wives still alive and will still be alive for all eternity sucks to be him. They'd eventually move on and find another man.  Top kek ishibumi       The title is Crimson-haired SEKIRYUUTEI after all.   That's true. But it doesn't seem like these kids are fully grown, and I doubt it would take Issei anywhere near 10,000 years to have a child with any of the girls (and there's no way someone actually managed to kill him). And again, one of the quotes is his.  For all we know Crimson Sekiryuutei hints at the volume 20 preview thing with Rias.        Shiva can probably kill Issei, even years into the future. Remember that this fucker is Dragon Ball levels of OP.    But what kind of a fucking ending would that be?   Promises happy ending for all the girls   Fuck it, let's kill off MC-kun as soon as he gets them all pregnant    Although it would confirm that he gets laid before the story ends          God from another world   Issei stops being the Sekiryuutei   Becomes the Chichigami   Chichigami was him all along from the future      ALTERNATE TIMELINE   wonder the backlash from the nips would be like.    I'd love it if they pulled something like this.   I'd like it just because of how much a little shit Issei was for the longest fucking time.       This would be fun.   Kumiko did end up being a gold mine for reactions didn't she?      And I love every single one of them.   A couple of volumes later for sure! Any time now!   season 3 sucks   gives this as an incentive to buy the BD's  Ishibumi had this planned out from the start.     Issei is dead   All these big shots talking about how much of a perverted badass he was and telling tons of absurd stories to his many, many children  mite b cool    How do u watch it uncensored, FFF is 2 episodes behind?    while his previous wives are still alive and finally moved on with their new man   Ishibumi make it happen       yfw the "new men" are Issei clones     but he's still dead Jim     Shitty season 3   Shitty ending on last volume   Yeah DxD confirmed for shit.        Implying Issei can actually die     The side story where Azazel made 100 clones did happen you know. We all know for a fact that the girls won't move on. Maybe in doujins, but not in this series.   Where do u watch uncensored, FFF is really behind.   There's a new Seikiryuutei anon. He's dead   We all know for a fact that the girls won't move on.  give it 5,000 years and they'll eventually encounter a person who has similarities with Issei. And said person will eventually win them over and make them happy. Why would you want the girls to live miserably without a man in their life, it's Issei's fault he died       I mean, Issei might just fucking transcend being the Sekiryuutei and is just in the Dimensional Gap all day doing stunts with Great Red.    but it was explained that in order to get a new host previous host must die first    That's not for every Sacred Gear actually. Walburga's found a new host without her dying.   Kinda like what Strike The Blood did. There the MC's daughter went to the past and got a chance to meet him when he was young. Sounds cool.   You're looking at this as if Issei wasn't going to share his Sekiryuutei power with a certain crimson-haired girl in the next volume.   give it 5,000 years and they'll eventually encounter a person who has similarities with Issei. And said person will eventually win them over and make them happy.   Maybe in doujins, but you underestimate their love for Issei. Why would they want anyone else? They were ready to give up on life in v12 and their connection has only grown closer now.   Why would you want the girls to live miserably without a man in their life,    Implying you need a man to be happy when you're surrounded by friends from your counter-terrorist team    it's Issei's fault he died   He's the motherfucking child of the two strongest beings in the world, allies with all of the strongest beings not named Shiva, and has the potential to be the strongest being in existence. He's not gonna die anon. Not even Shiva could handle Dulio + Crom + Vali + Issei + Saji + Sun Wukong + Cao Cao + others.                Issei is dead, UNLESS we change the past to change their future!   Come with me if you want to live     kek There's a new Sekiryuutei previous host died stop being delusional.   Maybe in doujins, but you underestimate their love for Issei. Why would they want anyone else?  because they have yet to find someone who will heal them and save them from their loneliness. Just face it anon they'll move on one way or another and they'll meet a person that reminds them of Issei and hooks up with him and they'll live happily with their new family        Not even Shiva could   How do you know? Hindy mythology is fucking broken.      You know damn well he'll be alive somehow.    yes because this is probably just some Strike the blood ex they're from the future BS and they'll warn them or sumshit to prevent Issei from dying    Not everyone moves on. People die from old age without ever having been in a close relationship with anyone and they still die happy. I know for a fact that Akeno would never move past him since she turns into a walking corpse when he "dies" in the novel. I could see it happening with Xenovia, Irina and a few others though    You make it sound like Issei not being the Sekiryuutei instantly makes him dead.    Yeah it is, but I highly doubt anyone could survive a combo like what was listed. We're talking about at least 6 people Ultimate-class to Heavenly Dragon-class tag-teaming the strongest God in existence.    I could see it happening with Xenovia, Irina and a few others though   At the time of v12, maybe. Now that he's established real relationships with them, no way.         Where abouts does Sirzechs come into the crazy powerlevel bullshit?    He's around Heavenly Dragon level.     Asia-kaasan  Wut?     I meant in comparison to other characters I know he'd skullfuck the majority but who exactly can beat someone who can erase shit out of existence?    Of course it's not even confirmed he has a SG the Sekiryuutei may just be a nickname since he looks to be the kid of the Chichiryuutei. Just imagine the damage to Ddraig if he found out he lost his title  Why are you guys thinking that this is a DIRECT SEQUEL?  The kids not only came from the future but FROM A WORLD WHERE THERE IS A DIFFERENT GOD.     Ophis and Shiva definitely. Idk about anyone else.    A world with a different god is definitely a plausible ending for this series though.     Issei confirmed dead   Good riddance.       I highly doubt anyone could survive a combo like what was listed   You do realize the entire point of displaying the powers of an invincible being is to make him defeat a bunch of superpowered warriors, right?       At the time of v12, maybe. Now that he's established real relationships with them, no way.   They are fucking teenagers who just had their first love, bro. Goes to show you know nothing about life. Having said that, DxD is hardly realistic, so I wouldn't be surprised.      Except Shiva's not invincible. He's a monster in terms of offense, but that doesn't have to hold true defensively. If someone can tank or avoid his attacks, could he do the same? "Serious-mode Shiva" is speculated to be him losing control of his power, sort of like JD.    One true love  Irina certainly wouldn't, Xenovia's a fucking enigma.         One true love   Every young kid says this.     Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.      Freshly made OC  Is there one for LOGH?   Make it yourself  Here, I'm even giving you the template           The last one barely died a few hours ago.         I love it     ;_;     Pretty much all I can recall of that movie is:   Don't do the thing I told you to do which would fix everything, Shinji   I'm going to do it anyway   ...I must go now, my people need me          this is what punchline fags actually think       still the greatest ride I ever rode      I don't get it.    I don't see the relationship between those. And I've watched/played both multiple times.    Shit, what's the name of this again?    They're both pretty cuh-razy and they both utilize character songs as an important theme (I'm convinced that Armstrong's fight wouldn't have been half as great without STANDING HERE)    welcome to WEG, the YLYL of /a/      Wolf Children   anyone have a Trigun WEG?   Oh lordy... food shows are torture sometimes.     4 and something around here   see this    Fuck you.         Kill la Kill tried too hard to be the new Gurren Lagann and Prometheus tried too hard to be the new Alien, I know is shitty but I was bored.    That's not really how WEGs work, pal          Prometheus actually had good lore. Klk just shoved everything to the garbage as the show went on.       The fights weren't good in symphogear, and neither was the music, so how did you get Revengeance?   Reposting from last thread     Too true.    Get rekt kiddo          Any more for stuff from this season?          If you had read the source you would have expected what it is. Animeonlyfags are cancer. Kill yourself.    Is this even good? I watch eps 1 when it came out but i thought it looked like crap so i quit.          One of the few shows that continues to make me mad to this day.   something saved from previous threads   The manga was better        I agree. Regardless of the ending though, i have to congratulate them on animating it well while remaining faithful to the manga's strange artstyle.   I don't know why, but it always bugs me when the anime people expect is newer than the show. I know everyone doesn't watch stuff as it airs (hell, I've got a giant backlog) but it still irks me for some dumb reason.   Can you rephrase that? I have no idea what you are trying to say.    So from what I gathered Plastic Memories isn't my long awaited Japanese Blade Runner, but is it worth watching or should I just go rewatch GitS?    Do you like series like AnoHana, SaiKano and Kanon? If not, go rewatch GitS. Plastic Memories is a melodrama with a thin veneer of SF with bullshit like the robots having souls.      Heh, sorry, I've been up way too long. I dislike it when the "what I expected show" is newer than the "what I watched". Like if you watched Haruhi and expected Lucky Star.      Oooh, i concur. On the other hand, i haven't watched nearly enough anime to be able to call anons out on that.          So it's FFIX: The Anime?  Sign me the fuck up.        No fuck you. Seriously fuck you. You fucks kept reposting this to the point that when I started watching it, I assumed I was in for some harrowing experience. When I saw the cute little moe girl doing cute little moe things, I thought she was going to get blown apart by a tank shell by the third episode.   And of fucking course all it is is fucking moeshit.       he didn't watch episode 7   he didn't make it to the end of the series  laughingwotos.gif      That's pretty good     Babylon 5   I'm tempted now.      Don't. The first episode was great, but the rest of it is downhill from there.     The atmosphere created in the first episode gets  shattered  by the end.       Only bad thing is that Meliodas have not even ounce of Zidane's charm    Anime gave me aidschan   my favourite weg   It's completely wrong though.      It's still of haram    Sonydicked    Gainax is dead, Love live TRIGGER    I want more of Nagate and Izana interactions on the ship - as long as progress is made. Those episodes were great.     Degeneracy      I don't even /pol/       I don't get it.    Is this a new troll method? I don't even understand what you're trying to imply.   ITT: shitty tumblr gif's.    Is second raid any better?      not liking Tessa  The fuck?    It was just perfect    liking that unsuited for life white-haired piece of shit             I'll fight you, fag    FMP would not work without the school episodes. They're what makes Sousuke's character development have impact later.  And also speaking as a Chidorifag, Tessa is a miracle, fuck you.        Watched -- YuYuYu Expected -- Cozy SOL Got -- Mahou shoujo suffering I think that's completely reasonable.       Of course, but it's the Taisha/Shinju who're responsible for the suffering.  Gyuuki dindu nuffin      Chidori is also meh for me  Anyways is second raid worth watching?              Shiki was such a great ride. Especially because I didn't know am I getting into, it was pretty much a mystery for the first couple of episodes.      Watching Ergo Proxy right now. Does it ever get good?    Now this is how you put more than one image in a panel.    It basically doesn't even count as more than one image because he essentially made a single entirely new image using snippets of others.      Nope.    Strangely I don't care much about the fanservice in this show because of the damn food. Makes me hungry as fuck.  And then I realise I can't cook.      Jesus, I just got hungry literally right after I stopped eating because I was totally full.    Ergo Proxy is not for kids    This is literally perfect.    Huh? What does Lucky Star have to do with Haruhi other than the protagonist liking the anime?      Sure, sure. But does it ever stop being 2deep4me vaguely relevant philosophical discussions in an excessively gloomy post-apocalyptic landscape? The first two episodes had me hooked but now it's becoming a drag.    The 16th episode (Dead Calm) is excellent. The rest of the series is dull as fuck    See<br/>    It gets good when best girl appears.  Also this, it's basically the only episode I remember.       Okay, I see. Does the ending at least provide some payoff?     It's basically Big Event + Close Call + MC Makes The Right Choice and it's all wrapped in the usual 2deep4me atmosphere     no utah yet?     The whole 15 minute per episode thing is what turned me off   Can someone post a FATE one?    Anyone have the other one?  Mandatory.     nailed it. Now I know why I enjoyed nanatsu despite of being not a fan of fighting shounen.     Guu is the magic mushrooms of anime?       someone didn't make it to ep. 7    I don't get it.     If you had read the source you would have expected what it is.  Not that anon, but that hardly would've made it any less awful. It didn't even pass as my "I'm so bored and need to fill the time with anything" series this season.     Not that anon, but I didn't either. I couldn't sit through 7 episodes of K-ON designs.    That's one bad case of shit taste you have there, friend.    Underrated one    Are you joking?    Barakamon any good?      because it was so bad right?   Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present  /ai/ - Idle Activities .   If you do a special buy (10 at a time) there's a 50% chance of Star brand for SR and PR (Rinne, June, Hiro).    Is there any guaranteed SR thing going on right now?    Thank you so much anon. Ok let's make a draw.   I don't think so.        Fuck it, the Prism's sparkle is with me. I'm making a draw once I get 2 more gems.   I fucked up. Stupid Hiro leave me alone.   You might want to wait on that it seems the Prism Sparkle is taking a piss right now.     Why is she so best?  I'm going to laugh when Yato/Yukine cut her head off.</blockquote>]
