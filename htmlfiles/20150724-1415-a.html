[ When will the latest chapter get translated guys? And for how long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again?  Reminder that Griffith is evil.  <br>Already fanslated by some chaps on /a/<br>And its monthly, for now at least.</br></br>  FEEL NO SHAME ABOUT SHAPE  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  I love Guts' face in that scene when hes like "How can you not feel anything?!"<br>I feel that feel Guts<br>Fucking little bitchboy that abused godmode after he got rekt<br>Griffith did  EVERYTHING  wrong</br></br></br>  <br>anyone going to actually typeset it though?</br>  <br>It was translated by a guy on SkullKnight.net.<br><br>http://f5.s.qip.ru/1a7On1iCK.png<br><br><br>Rakshas pls go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just imagine if this actually happened. Guts would go fucking insane.</br>  <br> fanslated on /a/ <br> implying [Evil_Genius] aren't fans too </br></br>  Did Griffith purposely sell his ass to Gennon so that years later when he attacked Doldrey his obsession with Griffith would affect his battle tactics allowing Griffith to capture the castle?<br><br> just as keiaku </br></br>  <br>Oh shit, is Griffith gonna rain hell down upon Locus and Rakshas for this shit?<br>Griffith is obviously not the one who issued the order to kill Rikert, he dont give a fuck wether he leaves or stays.</br></br>  <br>It was casuality, but how the fuck would Griffith know dude? He was just a regular human back then, he couldnt see the future.</br>  <br>I hope there is some sort of prophecy or contract Rakshas has to fulfill about never letting Griffith be hurt, and Rickert just shit all over it.<br><br>I wonder what the consequences will be.</br></br></br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  Does Gutt´s JRPG party know about his history and he went through? I don´t fucking remember if he ever told anyone  <br>It already happened when Griffith made sweet love Casca during the eclipse.<br> Guts is literally a cuck who got raped by a nigger. </br></br>  someone explain falconia for good, please  <br><br><br>GRIFFITH!!!!</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, besides Schierke who has seen glimpses of the eclipse in his psyche.<br><br>There's one point where Isidro sperges out about how great the commander of the hawks raiders was, he asks Guts "Didn't you used to be with a mercenary group." and he says something like "Doesn't matter."</br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't plan that far ahead. At the time, Griffith was feeling guilt for letting a kid in his army die, and that gave him the initiative to sell his body for supplies.</br></br>  I wonder how Griffith's parents look like.    Where can I read 338 in English?   mfw waited a long time for the new chapter  <br> mfw there are people who have been following Berserk since the 90's  <br> mfw some people died waiting for It  <br> mfw I didn't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  <br>None but Schierke. There have been hints here and there of people knowing about his past but not knowing exactly who he is, like Isidro looking up to Guts without knowing it was Guts ()<br><br>We also see in the Falconia chapters that many of the other side characters remember Guts but none of them share that they know exactly who it is, it's actually a nice bit of dramatic irony to see all of Guts' actions throughout the series come together with many people not knowing it's actually him. I imagine "soon" some of the party members will learn more about Guts' past, if they ever go to elf island.</br></br></br>  I think pick knows what happened to Guts. Hope his party finds out eventually. <br>Will mermaid girl join the party?</br>  <br>Puck*</br>  The JRPG party is going to die in some horrible fucked up way, just letting you all know right now.  <br> If they ever go to elf island </br>  Where's the anon who was translating the chapter at?<br>http://imgur.com/a/SFZqV/layout/blo<wbr>g</wbr></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Everyone in Guts' party dies, and Griffith rules happily every after. The End. </br>  <br>Being Guts is suffering</br>  how come the manga is only 20 pages or so&gt; someone told me the new chapters were supposed to be 100 plus pages each?  <br>the 100 pages thing was just for recap</br>  <br>Its 21 pages of new material, the other 79 were the previous chapter re-released to refresh readers memory. Also its only this month not every month. Read closer anon.</br>  Isn't it mind boggling to you guys just how young Guts, Caska and Griffith are? They're only in their very early 20's.  <br>Puck knows. Not only was he getting images of what happened from Guts' mind for a while, he was also there when Guts told Rickert about the Eclipse. He's also met the five, not that they left much of an impression on him.<br><br>Schierke sort of knows. She understands the process behind the brand of sacrifice and the meaning behind it. And, like Puck, she's seen images of Guts' memory. She hasn't heard the details straight from Guts like Puck did, though.<br><br> No one else is aware.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Griffith way older than Casca though?</br>  <br>Probably 3 or 4 years older at the most.</br>  <br>Griffith is like 30, guts is 24 or so, Caska I suppose is 25-28.</br>  <br>Nah Guts is 25-30, and Griffith and he are the same supposedly the same age. <br> Griffith was quiet a bit older than Casca when he rescued her. Maybe 20? </br></br>  <br>No...</br>  <br>Owen recognized him and even spoke with him about it.</br>  <br>Griffith is 26, Guts 22, Caska 21 or 20.</br>  <br>What is there to explain? It's the ancient city of Gaiseric except bigger.</br>  <br>That is just false dimwit.<br>Guts is like 20 when he fights Griffith and leaves the band. Then he fucks of for a year, making him 21, he rescues Griffith and Eclipse happens, he then runs around for two more years making him 23. Further journeying all over midland BY FOOT, which takes a long ass fucking time mind you, would make him close to 24 or so now.<br><br>Caska is saved by Griffith when she is like 12 or something, and Griffith is already an adult. Following the same timeline Griffith should be above 30 years old by now and Caska is older than Guts or so we can presume, making her atleast 25.<br><br>How the fuck do you reach the conculsion that they are that young?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> How long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again? <br><br>When we get the next boat.</br></br></br>  <br> put your grasses on <br>eberytiem</br></br>  <br>I keep seeing this picture of Locus, is it from the new chapter?</br>  <br>yes<br>he craves griffiths bp</br></br>  <br>Yes, and it makes one hell of a template. You can literally add anything and its fucking gold.</br>  anime is gay and you should feel gay  Great monthly releases of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING    <br> insulting people about an entirely speculative topic <br> thinking you make accurate predictions about characters in medieval era manga, let alone their ages.  <br> Not thinking all the obvious shit you posted didn't occur to the anon you replied to <br> thinking Casca was that young when Griffith saved her.  <br><br>Stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You preferred biannually?</br></br>  WHERE'S MY TRANSLATION  <br> not reading the thread <br>heh</br></br>  <br>It was a shit chapter anyway</br>    <br>TOP KEK</br>  <br>What would you have done, my man?</br>  <br>Not botched my suicide attempt.</br>  <br> Casca gets her mind back <br> chooses Griffith and spirit kid <br> Griffith rejects her because muh kingdom <br> Casca becomes an hero <br>   Guts becomes an apostle and kills everyone </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this, are the raws out at least?</br></br>  <br> translation of a translation <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>    <br>They already have too many party members. Someone's gonna die.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, we've only established that Falconia just randomly contains devices and technology from other great cities like ROMAN FIRE HOSES* and shit and is a perfect place for engineers and other kinds of great thinkers to live in.<br><br>I'm sure that won't be important later on.<br><br>Also: the battle of the prostitute idols for Rickert's D has begun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you had a behelit, there'd be no way you could successfully kill yourself before being presented the choice of initiation into the Godhand or eternal damnation. Guts will also have to make some kind of decision down the road because he has his own. It was inevitable. <br><br>Now choose, faglord.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you tell me how old you think this girl is.<br>She has just developed tits as you can see, and I refuse to believe she is older than 13 at most.<br>Prove to me that she was older than 12-13.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Guts take his behelit from an apostle? Does it actually make it count as *HIS* behelit?</br>  <br>His D belongs to Erica</br>  Puck will use the Behelit.<br><br>Save this.</br></br>  <br>They could have had it all ;-;</br>  <br>He's in possession of it, hasn't lost it, and I'm sure it can activate more than once.</br>  This thread needs more Schierke.  <br>miura pls</br>    <br>Berserk needs more Schierke butt.</br>    <br>Just because he's holding it doesn't make it his, he may very well be holding onto it for someone else.</br>  <br>10.5/10</br>  translations when  <br>Thread needs more<br> Corkus </br></br>  <br>only a few times I was so glad when a character died</br>    <br>Oh you want act rike that? I go pray aidorumasuta for 3 more years</br>  <br>Corkus was nice to have. The band was too perfect.</br>    <br>I can see something like this happening for whoever's on that boat. Something terrible happens, most of the crew are dead, and it rolls into someone's hand as they're coughing up blood via impalement. I'm thinking Casca who's so out of her mind being impaled would cause her to freak out a ton. I think since she was mind broken she hadn't had so much as a scratch until Guts gave her that boob bite.<br><br><br>Judeau was my favorite. <br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey fuck you man</br>  <br>It's  Casca's  </br>  <br>was Corkus jealous of Guts?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Goddamit</br>  <br>No he was just pissed Guts couldn't just settle and enjoy the good life they earned as the Hawks but instead had to go and ruin it for everyone. He felt like Guts was acting 'too cool' or too good for that life and resented him for it among other things.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. But Guts was just trying to be Griffith's equal. To have his own dream, to tread his own path.</br>  Can we get some respect for the Tapasa that not only pasted Raksas with that column, but threw it in anticipation for where he would rebound to.<br><br>I mean, before those guys couldn't even land a punch on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy fuck keep em coming. Ill try to retrieve my sides from orbit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> come into thread late <br> see template <br> make pretty much this exact image <br> scroll down and see your post <br><br>motherfucker</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guts wouldn't have ruined it for everyone though, the band had become nobles and ended the war. They would probably never have to set foot in battle ever again, so Guts wasn't needed in that regard, which is all Corkus ever saw him as useful for. He was just pissed that Guts would even think about leaving what he assumed he had been fighting for all this time. When he found out Guts real goal of matching Griffith he completely tore into him because to him Griffith is completely unbeatable and the very notion sickened him. <br><br>There was also a shit tonne of insecurity.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont get it.</br>  <br>look up Tommy Wiseau</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DxW<wbr>kfJ4uvV0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah and he hated that too. He felt, like a lot of people maybe even including Guts at some point, that to try and stand shoulder to shoulder with Griffith was delusional and nothing if not conceited.<br>I'm sure there's a panel somewhere where he says something like "And who do you think you are? Do you think you're like Griffith? Ridiculous!" <br>Might have been in the tavern the night before he left.</br></br></br>  Who else thinks that in the end, the Band of the Hawk didn't mind that Griffith sacrificed them in order to achieve his dream? I remember Griffith or someone saying that the band of the hawk knew that they would eventually die because of Griffith's dream or whatever  <br>Here's one from yesterday</br>  <br>Did they look like they didn't mind when they were being ripped apart by apostles?</br>  <br>There's a huge difference between fighting for his dream and surviving to continue living. We aren't arguing the fact that they could die, but there is a massive difference between fighting in an army for glory and to attain something, and being shredded by apostles. They didn't sign up for that.</br>  <br>Corkus was a fucking rat, plain and simple. Calling him a human is insulting to humanity, he's that bad. Fucker got his friends killed, tried killing guts, kept trying to add salt to his wounds and was generally a piece of shit all around.</br>    <br>Also the exploitable with no logo</br>  <br>I always saw him as an odd type of tsun tsun. Attacking while there's confusion on the battlefield has shown to be effective, but after Casca told him to stop, he just complained afterwards and nothing else. He never struck me as hostile after that, just petty at times but didn't actually hate Guts.</br>  I literally only come to /a/ for Berserk threads, anyone else?  Let's say casca dies because of something unrelated to griffith. <br><br>Do you think guts will still try to kill griffith?</br></br>  <br>I go for the Tomo-Chan and NTR threads when they pop up but Berserk is the only "real" series I go on /a/ for.</br>  <br>Thats not exploitable, this is.<br>Gotta keep it transparent son.</br></br>  <br>of course you mongoloid. It still wouldn't change the fact that the Band of the Hawk is still dead because of Griffith.</br>  Haven't read berserk in over a year. So is there some new mega torrent link with everything but the newest or am i gonna have to find an old torrent and go from there?  <br>you've missed like, three chapters</br>  <br>Yeah but it's been a year, I'd like to read some old chapters to let it all flood back, you know?</br>  <br> flood <br> flooding. <br> boats flood <br>Triggered</br></br></br></br>  <br> NTR threads <br>Hello, Griffithfag.</br></br>  <br>oh god are they STILL on the boat?</br>  <br><br>Do you still remember isma's tits?</br></br>  <br> Isidro starring at her tits <br> Schierke reads his mind <br> faceful of cleavage <br><br>hell yeah</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>oh miura<br><br>HOLY FUCK THE CAPTCHA WAS BOATS.<br><br>I AM TRIGGERED</br></br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/avaSdC0QOUM  [ ]<br><br>If there is a god someone will edit this video.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br> Implying it isn't Puck's and that Puck wont ascend to be the second to last boss with his new found godhand power. </br></br>  <br>Yep, only reason I'm here</br>  <br>Guts would never become an apostle. Casca doing it is more likely.</br>  <br>the guts mod isn't half bad <br><br>don't know if they ever added a berserker armor mod to it</br></br></br>    <br>http://imgur.com/Se011cO<br>link in description</br></br>  <br> And its monthly, for now at least. <br>im not falling for that again.</br></br>  <br>Official Berserk theme since they got on that boat...</br>    <br> enchanting dragonslayer </br>  damn this thread is dying  <br>I think the mod made it already enchanted?<br><br>it's been a while since I played</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't. And it's already pretty OP with no enchanting.</br>  So... Is she a member of the party now? Or will she stay with her mother?  <br>actually can anybody else download from box?<br>http://pastebin.com/Yxmt4bp5<br>its not downloading when i click the link</br></br></br>  friendly reminder that griffithfagging is a bannable offence  <br> not even a fixed Casca's, but full retard Casca's  she sells all the band of the guts as sacrifice for some cake because she was hungry! <br><br><br><br>Corkus literally became redeemable right at the moment when he was being loaded into the sacrifice wagon. Literally no one else in the series had as tragic a fate as poor corkus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What redeemed him? Refresh my memory.</br>  <br>Getting raped by a hot chick apostle. He was just a lonely guy.</br>  <br> spoiler <br> mfw <br>The rage from fans would probably set Japan on fire.<br><br><br> raped by a hot chick apostle <br> Guts then has sex with it later on </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  someone please explain falconia  I think berserk will end with a paradigm shift people no longer believe in magic so the godhands and shit will no longer have power. <br><br>I just hope schierke survives.</br></br>    I can't help but feel like Guts is the bad guy in this series now.<br><br>I mean Griffith built a utopia, where both apostles and humans can coexist, he drove out those muslim demons from the lands, he did more for the people than Guts has ever or will do.<br><br>At his point Gut's revenge plot to kill Griffith is just petty and childish, if he ever gets on elf island he should just stay there</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't look like he cares about Griffith as much as he cares about fixing Casca.</br>  <br>Yes but once fixed what will he do? We all know he's not just going to call it quits then and there.</br>  <br>He'll just stay with Casca in Elf Island, unless she goes with Griffith as a traitorous bitch or kills herself because she's too traumatized.  And I think that's exactly what is going to happen... </br>  <br>I would hardly call what the apostles and humans are doing right now 'coexistence,' nor would I say I know for sure what the end of Griffith's lust for power entails.<br><br>Unless his motive was purely benevolent, which I doubt it is, I have no cause to crown Griffith a good guy.</br></br></br>  <br> where both apostles and humans can coexist <br>Except not really. See Rickert freaking out over the apostle's stadium. Also Zodd has to smack some of them around when they think about eating people. It's not so much as coexisting as it's just them tolerating each other because Griffith said play nice.</br></br>  <br>do they have to eat people though? what stops them from eating animals?</br>  <br>Seriously though, can anybody else download the Schierke mod or is it just me?</br>  <br>kek'd</br>  <br>Inhuman taste. Humans, in most fantasy settings really, have a distinct taste that makes them the best food for monsters, also humans can scream. Animals can cry out in pain, but it probably doesn't compare to the screams and cries of 100 people. But that's just speculation based off what 2 apostles said when claiming it'd been so long since they tasted human flesh.</br>  So, can Guts even have a decent ending for himself? I feel like he's going to submit to the beast to kill Griffith and ruin everything  <br>He could, but causality won't let him</br>  <br>He's fucked for life anyways with the brand, we all know there is no way in hell he can kill griffith or any Godhand, the manga is going to end with him dying at Griffith's hand</br>    <br>I think Guts is just cursed with living the longest, most horrible life ever. He'll most likely end up immortal some way or another and forever alone. Or the next Skull Knight.</br>  <br> we all know there is no way in hell he can kill griffith or any Godhand <br>hasn't it been implied the armor may one day turn guts into something like skullknight?</br></br>  <br>Can you tell me one thing, who the hell drew that? Was it Miura?</br>  <br>and how many godhands has skullknight killed?</br>  <br>The one Griffith had to replace</br>  <br>Skullknight can't kill any God hand either, he just seems like he can't die but he's not all that powerful he can barely handle zodd</br>  <br>And the Skull Knight was very capable at killing a God Hand, right?</br>  <br> being this pleb <br>It was pixiv user no. 37799736</br></br>  <br>How does that work considering Guts could probably take Zodd with the armor</br>  <br>The NTR threads are the worst thing about this board.</br>  <br>I think he's eventually going to become a God Hand, honestly. Casca is going to end up brain dead forever, so he sacrifices her to achieve godhood and kill the others.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br> considering Guts could probably take Zodd with the armor <br><br>We don't know that for sure, he held his own vs big snake cannon apostle with the armor but didn't kill him I assume out of all of Griffith's new apostles Zodd is the strongest</br></br></br>  <br> tfw Rickert was implied to die in the anime <br>That fucked me up before i read the manga.</br></br>  <br>He's branded so he can never be godhand, That one tits godhand said something about how great it would be if he could join them but then she said something about how much of a shame it was because he was branded</br>  <br> Zodd could take out these guys <br>Not too sure about that.</br></br>  <br>Except they literally said <br> that he's not fated to be one of the God Hand.</br></br>  Why is Luca so incredible? Best girl.  <br><br>I will give those bulgy fuckers respect with you, anon.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but what the fuck does "ordained by the laws of fate" supposed to mean? Just "no god hand for this faggot"?</br>  <br>I re-read the entire arc since I watched the anime first so I can forgive it. Some things, like Puck, were just taken out because it wasn't getting a season 2. The one thing they should have kept in would be Zodd since I was honestly confused when he appeared to give Guts that sword.</br>  <br>He can still be an apostle</br>  <br>It means "God didn't plan it that way". At this point it's very clear that for the Hand of God what "God" wants to happen and what is going to happen are the same thing, if only because they'll make sure of it.</br>  any one here like mount and blade?  <br>Is that vanilla only?</br>  <br><br>I think Zodd could take em, although is size is confusing at time.</br></br>   Can't find decent scans <br><br>god the one i find is such shit quality it physically pains me to look at</br></br>  did he get off the boat  <br> _no </br>  <br>this.</br>  <br><br><br> you can literally put anything and its pure gold <br>keep em coming</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of get the feeling that Guts' actions aren't/won't be bound by fate. <br>It's a manga, he's bound to break the rules.</br></br>  The only way for this manga to end properly is for guts to go back in time in the demon armor as his own version of skull knight And stop himself right before him and griffith fight.      <br>Because blushing tomboys are cute and the vanillafag's reactions are priceless.</br>  <br>fuck anon you're golden</br>  <br> vanillafag's <br>and that is?</br></br>        <br>Best one yet</br>    This Locus shit is literally the best thing to happen so far. Spread it far and wide, anons.      I can't think of anything clever, but that doesn't stop me from making these.  <br>:^)</br>  I'm surprised I haven't seen an Onani Master Kurosawa edit yet.  <br> Band of the Hawk not Band of the flacon ok <br>Heh.</br></br>      <br>Skull Knight is never serious with zodd though. Everytime they fight, he beats zodd down without being scratched and then zodd breaks into laughter and tells skull knight it was a good fight and they go their seperate ways. Theyre basically chums, I bet they go to the same bar.</br>  <br>Where did you get such a good translation of the count arc? I had to read literal shit.</br>  <br>mangasee is good if you don't feel like downloading</br>  guts could probably easily kill zodd with the armor.    <br><br><br>Here you go /a/nons<br>https://bakabt. me/torrent/162057/berserk-scans</br></br></br></br>    <br>this one is the best holy shit</br>  what if guts party gets off boat but then has to get on a flying boat?   spoonfeeding  <br> facebook tier memes <br> endless shitposting  <br>Why haven't Berserk threads been banned yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Making OC is a bannable offense on /a/ these days, huh</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon, i've been a complete shitter and reading it online.</br></br>  <br>What if he gets to elf island only to find out they have moved and has to take a boat back?</br>  <br>people like you are the reason /a/ is shit</br>  <br>what if elf island is a giant boat?</br>  <br>No problem anon, enjoy</br>  <br>not moe enough for you?</br>  <br>Berserk threads are great containment threads for /v/ filth much like dragon ball threads</br>  <br>Isn't what Griffith is doing right now part of the keikaku to bring about the age of darkness or whatever?

Berserk threads have been more than terrible for a very long time now. <br><br>I miss the olden days when we had like a thread every once in blue moon, but they actually had quality to them. Is Deepfag even around anymore?</br></br></br>  <br> Casca Loved Every Second <br>Triggered</br></br>  <br>New chapter is released.<br> stop posting about it </br></br>  <br> download from nyaa <br> manga panda tier labels every other panel <br> Hawk scans in general <br>I just read online. Good quality too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean in general. And in this thread you're not even talking about the chapter. Most of the thread is spam of that shit tier OC.</br>  <br>I see a lot of discussion here indeed.<br><br>You are just too retarded, nitwit.</br></br></br>  Anyone else already missing this awesomely glorious bastard? I wouldn't mind if Guts and co still stayed on the boat for 2 more years as long as we could have chapters with this guy featured in.<br><br>Also, how did he become an apostle? What you think he sacrificed? Why's he blind? Why does he like to stay alone even among other apostles? Why's he so friendly with Sonia? Why didn't he join and swore allegiance with Griffith along with Zodd, Locus, Grunbeld and Rakshas? Why does his bow seem to have a life of its own? Was he on the Eclipse? Is he going to shoot down Dragons with his awesome wolf-head crossbow in Fantasia? Will Sonia get to ride him again? Is he similar to Guts in some aspect? Do you think he will also have a team of archer apostles with reversed centaur-esque forms like himself, akin to Locus and Grunbeld's divisions? Where, how and why did he learn to play the lute?<br>And finally, what was he hunting in the forest for days when he said that he finally became a beast in the story he told to Sonia?</br></br></br>  <br><br>My  headcanon  is that Zodd used to be the Guts to Skullknight's Griffith, except in that version Zodd is the one who used a behelit to sacrifice his comrades and Skullknight ended up having to live in the penumbra or whatever its called while Zodd destroyed his kingdom.<br><br>Which is what role Guts will ultimately have to fulfill in the great IoE's keikkaku  unless the great ultimate battle of ultimate destiny is resolved with griffith and guts hugging it out just to spite the god hand </br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I thought he was just a moomin reference.</br></br>  <br> headcanon <br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  You can't shop Locus into everything.    <br>Damn that aspect Ratio, but I like the Locus over Locus.</br>    <br> Why's he so friendly with Sonia? <br>Might have something to do with her personality. Chances are he sacrificed someone who acted like her and he doesn't mind her being around. Or rather, that's how it usually goes. Also, he's rather handsome looking in his transformed state instead of being an absolute monster so I'm going to assume there was some tragic romance going on in the past. Handsome characters always have a romance.</br></br>  <br>Oddly literal.</br>  I have no idea what Im doing  good meming lads  All this goddamn fawning over the hawk is just making me fucking sick, and now apostles are fighting alongside humans. <br><br>I finally caught up with the latest chapter, and looks like guts have absolutely no hope to settle his past with him now, specially considering that he is just forgetting the whole eclipse thing happened or just straight up accepted his jrpg band is better than the past.<br><br>I can see him joining up with the elf king and whatever other mystical beings are left to take on against Griffith as soon they realize the world is pretty fucked now with monsters swarming everywhere. Griffith got his kingdom, so what happens now? He is going to unleash his pet monsters to feast on the world or will the godhand attempt to resurrect their boss or whatever?</br></br></br></br>    <br>I always imagine him playing the passionate version of blood and guts when hes chilling by himself.</br>  Will she join the crew?  <br>Fucking hell what are you doing to my boner?</br>    <br>Just looked that up and it seems to be some finnish cartoon characters. How are they related?<br><br><br>Interesting thoughts. For some reason, i'm leaning to think his sacrifice might not have been human, much like the egg apostle. He seems differentiated for some reason, whether it be his behaviour, nature and/or mannerism. His strange bow and the fact he seems blind, and how that could correlate with his completely unnatural accuracy on his arrows makes me think that ability ws what he aimed for when he sacrificed something.<br><br>I wonder why he's alone. Was he like that before, or did he become that way after becoming an apostle? I'm also leaning towards the former. He's so mysterious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loli <br><br>She's in</br></br></br>  <br><br> sacrifice might not have been human <br><br>I wonder if that's why some Apostles seem to not suffer from bloodlust or at least be able to keep it tamped very well (like Zodd). Apostles have to sacrifice what is most precious to them, which for most people is probably other human beings. But maybe if the sacrifice is something intangible or value based they don't suffer from the blood lust.</br></br></br></br>    <br>He could have also been one of the magi types and "sees" with od. His mannerisms are reserved which I think would be fitting for someone who understands everything around him because magic learning as a human.</br>  <br>So maybe he sacrificed his sight?</br>  <br> tfw Casca will never be regain her memories <br> tfw another Apostle ceremony will happen <br> tfw Slan will never pin down Guts in front of Casca and rape him in front of her </br></br></br>  <br>Casca would sacrifice Farnese right? Cant sacrifice Guts twice.</br>  <br>Skullknight mentions that time doesn't flow in a circle, but more like a spiral. Hinting that they're moving towards some conclusion</br>  <br>Seems like a useless sacrifice if he developed the perfect skills he has. Unless he has permanent nightmare vision like berserk Guts.<br><br><br> tfw Slan will never pin down Guts in front of Casca and rape him in front of her <br>So I'm not the only one who wants to see Guts get raped again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see real rape this time.</br>  daily reminder that casca is the perfect waifu  <br>Women cant rape.</br>  <br>So that's how they are related heh? I was thinking more along the lines of his canine/fox/wolf form, and Guts has a sort of aspect that often shows in the form of a mad rabid dog too. Also read some interesting parallels on Sonia/Casca and how she aligned with Irvine/Guts when Griffith started giving attention to other important affairs.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, I think most, as in say, 99.99% of sacrifices are human like we would expect, but sometimes we get the odd one where something abstract or maybe even some parts of the self that are immensely valued could make for the sacrifice too. His sight seems suspicious and could well be involved.<br><br><br>Could be it. His demonic bow seems to have a magical lock on targets and the strength of his arrows seems magical sometimes. Maybe its infusing evil power in its arrows in order to make them even stronger and deadlier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No she isn't. She loved Griffith despite having Guts.</br>  <br>It was Flora who mentioned that, and it was regarding causality, not time.</br>  <br>Second reply was meant to .</br>  <br> women <br> implying she doesn't have a futa penis hidden somewhere </br></br>    <br>A female character in the group that doesn't lust after guts...i wouldn't mind it</br>  <br>Her and Guts only got together like the day before they rescued Griffith. She was in the process of changing, and would have been able to free herself from Griffith in time had she not been interrupted by the eclipse. <br><br>Without the eclipse, despite her feeling an obligation to become caretaker, Griffith would have probably an hero'd as he wouldn't be able to bear being a vegetable. She'd eventually set off to find Guts again.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet guts and griffith fucked. I bet guts still thinks about those nights because he hates the fact that the best sex he had was with his enemy.</br>  Are trains superinteresting?  <br>I like boobs and butts</br>  <br>This shit was so awful.</br>  <br>I know the Ln was superior in every way,but I still liked the anime.  made me feel comfy  season 2 when?</br>  I fucking love trains.

Pellet gun granted but yes.</br>  <br> Pellet gun </br>  <br>No escape.</br>  <br>Airsoft whatever.</br>  <br>I'm quite sure it has her service weapon. I don't recall air guns at any moment.</br>  <br>Doesn't she fire it and just miss? I can't remember, you might be right. I thought there was an offhand line about it or something but with this show, anything's possible.</br>  <br>Now I am curious, let me check it.<br> I still have the show on my HDD </br></br>  LN translations when      I want to see Aoi brutally assfucked.  <br>its the pool from shionmeta they blew up</br>  <br>She fires at them by accident, but it isn't told if it's a real gun or not. It makes common sense for it been a BB gun, but I don't remember her carrying anything but her real gun with her.</br>  <br> It isn't told or explained  <br><br>That was basically the MO of this entire show huh. What a wonderful clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  You had one job Passione, one job.<br>http://www.youdubber.com/index.php?<wbr>video=2Jy0ocIF7QU&amp;video_start=0&amp;aud<wbr>io=pl57hN4EaLU&amp;audio_start=158</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> you came to the wrong neighborhood motherfucker </br></br>  I love how at the wiki page the summaries of the episodes suddenly stop at episode 6, it's evident that whatever editor was doing just dropped the show at that point.<br>Also:<br> The An adventure game developed by 5pb. for the PlayStation Vita has been announced. The game was due for a November 27, 2014 release, until it was delayed. </br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2014-10-24/rail-wars-ps-vita-dela<wbr>yed-until-further-notice/.80324<br> that the delay is due to "various circumstances."  <br>Right.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  So which train has  inverted nipples   <br>Inverted nipples are shit-tier because you can't play with them.</br>  <br>I like that it's the cat episode too, just "fuck it, I'm out".</br>  <br>Look at that ass.<br>Look at it.</br></br>  It's such a shame that we live in a society that sexualizes women so much. This anime had the potential to be one of my favorites (since I truly like trains and their mechanics), however, the only thing that I got out of it was boobs and fan service. I just don't get it, if they are going to be going to such extremes why not just make a hentai? That way the audience that is actually looking for a show with trains as its main focus doesnt leave disappointed.  What was the reason pink breast monster was in love with the MC again?<br><br>It was something about their childhood but I don't have the anime on my hard drive anymore.</br></br>  Jesus, this show got nendos, and 2 of them.<br>It even has the fucking bomb defuse accessories.</br>    <br>I would've paid for a scale Nana figure, honestly.</br>  <br>He rescued her after she got trapped inside an office by some boxes. Of course the dense MC won't remember it.</br>  <br>He rescued her when they kids from...getting locked in a closet, at the train museum, I think?</br>  <br>Actually I think a bunch of us picked it up because of the train, or at least because it was gonna be something interesting.<br>It ended up being interesting in many ways I wasn't expecting, sincerely I regret nothing.</br></br>  <br>She also flipped her shit just because MC went to go meet another girl at a church.<br><br>She might be crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>Also echi =! hentai</br>  <br>Yandere love is the purest anon.</br>  <br>You realize they pop out when they harden from arousal don't you anon?<br><br>Of course not, you've never touched a woman in your life.</br></br></br>  <br>He is right, though. If the elevens want to make a show fill with fan service, then make it a hentai. If they want to make a show about a specific hobby/topic, then make it with that idea as its main plot. There is no reason to intermingle those two genres, especially when one of them is Safe for work and the other isn't.</br>    <br> those eyes </br>  Are real trains this comfy?  <br>Then why does anons get mad at me when I say that "plastic nee-san" was shit because it wasn't about scale models?</br>  Which train has the best  feet?   <br> those cars </br>  <br>Sleeper rail is comfy as fuck, if it wasn't expensive I'd do it all the time.</br>  <br>Yes they also rock you to sleep and sing you a lullaby.</br>  <br>I am a Harukafag<br> without doubt Aoi </br></br>  <br>And you have? Yeah okay buddy.</br>  <br>Fun is, I'm still not sure which one is correct.</br>  <br>Just so you know, most women don't have inverted nipples. It's extremely rare.<br>I don't see how not knowing how they work means you haven't been with a woman before.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I have, touched your mom last night.</br>    <br>fucking kek</br>  I want to board this train  The arts were even more delicious  <br>She already got a ticket to Fucking Dense MC's Harem</br>  <br>Why is she wearing riot gear?</br>  <br>Can't even remember.<br>I think it was something about terrorist.</br></br>  <br><br>The LN has an actual plot and antagonists rather than just completely random, nameless dudes wanting to blow up the railway for fuck knows what reason.</br></br>  <br>Terrorists trying to board her caboose.</br>   not adorning yourself in Rail Wars goods to show your superb taste to everyone   <br>250x237<br>let me guess you are still in 199X, right?</br></br>  <br>Is this a t shirt for ants?</br>  <br><br>Only picture on the goods site.</br></br>  <br>Jesus that's a cheesy motto</br>  FUCK THIS SHIT <br>Uno Makoto was put on this Earth to fill it with the beauty of healthy shemale incest and now he's doing this train shit.<br>There is no justice in the world</br></br>  <br> not when there's a rail, there's a way <br>Oh come on.</br></br>  <br>Can't fight those trains</br>  <br>I don't think doing character designs for Rail Wars was exactly so time intensive that he's abandoned all other work or something, not exactly a long running franchise or something. Nigga took a paycheck and went on his way.</br>  <br>I did</br>  <br><br>Those are some of the most generic designs I've ever seen</br></br>  <br>That's true, but our time on the planet is limited so he really should be devoting everything he can to producing more futa doujins<br>I think it's been a couple years by now</br></br>  <br>What is you're country?</br>  <br>Fuck this show. I was sold on cattle cars rolling up next to each other, sliding open, and cops and crims giving each other fucking broadsides. I wanted a god damn war on rails, and I didn't fucking get one.</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot.</br>  <br>I didn't think a fanservice show could be bad, then I started to watch Rail Wars. <br><br>Such a shame, the characters are hot as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>For most of them yeah, but Aoi is 10/10</br>  <br>They had to delay it until they could make a sufficiently advanced ass physics engine</br>  <br>Totally not a biased statement.</br>  <br>But I think it's true. I can't recall another similar character.</br>  <br>They did?</br>  <br>Aoi is thristy as fuck right there.</br>  <br>Entire dev team too busy fapping.</br>  <br>Maybe she should have stopped for a drink before boarding the train</br>      <br><br><br>I can definitely recognize Makoto's style in this, but my heart is crushed when I realize they don't have cocks larger than their thighs</br></br></br>  <br>She's gunna have such saggy fucking tits in about 4 or 5 years.</br>  So is this show worth watching if I just want a show with A&amp;T?<br><br>Does best girl win?</br></br>  What does the scouter say about their OTP-level?  <br>According to somebody claiming to be an LNfag Aoi is the main girl. It's still harem-y but not as much.</br>  <br>Nobody wins with Rail Wars. There are only losers.</br>  <br>I don't usually like these, but this one is pretty great.</br>  <br>Why is her hand so tiny?</br>  <br><br>Rape does not equal scoring.</br></br>  The threads were so fun.      <br>My nigga</br>  It had a surprisingly good OP and ED, credit where it's due.  <br>The girls were great but the show was actually complete shit.</br>  I wasn't exactly expecting Patlabor but this set a new low for police themed anime.<br>At least my penis was happy with it.</br>  <br><br>The only decent things about this show, aside from the cabooses.</br></br>  <br>yes they are</br>      <br>I'll rail her way, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Groningen is such a nice city</br>  <br><br>I have one of the artbooks. The art is gorgeous.<br>The girls are just hot enough to keep my dick standing, but the situations aren't hot enough to make me fap.<br><br>Artist could make some really high quality fap material, but all we'll get is cocktease.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting blueballed by an artbook </br>  This show was pure trash but goddamn, the girls sure were delicious  <br>I'd blow her Euphonium if you know what I mean</br>    <br><br>Now it makes sense</br></br>  <br>Yup, full of whores too<br>You should be here on a friday night once, goddamn</br></br>  <br>OH GOD SHE'S MISSING A QUARTER OF HER BODY</br>  <br> talking about anime which came out before the last season </br>  <br>muh dick</br>  Did they fix any of the QUALITY in the BDs?  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>read the thread, they added nipples</br>    <br>kek</br>  <br> This shit actually made me confused when I was watching. Like why would you hang fucking blank papers. <br><br>The show lacked budget so there were a ton of errors everywhere due to lack of checking. In this example, they needed cars, so someone just added a layer containing cars into the scene.</br></br></br>  http://fapservice.com/rail-wars-fan<wbr>service-compilation/</wbr>  <br>I really love the yellow and white cars on the left, just parked 5meters into the building. <br><br>Also find  extremely amusing.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan entrusts guns to teenagers now? <br>Aoi frequently brandishes her gun without getting reprimanded. Since they are high school youths in training, brandishing should be corrected with a lot more alacrity that if Aoi was not in a course.<br><br>Picture: It's cheaper to draw it this way, but in actual practice, a genuinely large cup of hot coffee that is this large cannot be handed over this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They even included the OP <br>I appreciate the small things.</br></br>  <br>The OP was top tier. Didn't really fit the show at all though. Sounded like a 90s mecha OP.</br>  <br>With all the shit in this show, I think holding a large cup isn't that big of a deal.</br>  <br>A little like Patlabor? There might be a reason for that.</br>  <br>This made me remember how blatant the fanservice was</br>  "Rail Wars was an absolute waste of time and should be watched by absolutely no one", snorted Thomas.  <br> With all the shit in this show, I think holding a large cup isn't that big of a deal. <br><br>These are SAFETY staff in training. There's too much unsafe behaviour in this show by safety staff.</br></br></br>  <br>Thomas tried to use some of the rails and derailed.</br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ZxjkeatUG8    <br><br>I just applied for a train driver job<br>I got a decline so fuck you for reminding</br></br></br>  <br> not owning a tree car </br>  <br>It has nothing on the Patlabor OPs.</br>  <br>good filename, I do the same thing with media files I'm working on.</br>  <br>I want to reinstate her monarchy.</br>  <br>I didn't ask about the nipples, did I?</br>  <br> Staff in training points and accidentally shoots her gun at her other coworkers in the middle of the street.  <br> Fucks given = zero </br></br>  <br>some of this rails are not like the others.</br>  I fucking love trains.  <br>Aoi may take most of the screen, but yeah Noa is effectively best girl.</br>  <br><br> We need to make sure we stand out as security on a beach <br> We'll wear swimsuits <br> to stand out <br> on a beach <br><br>Oh Rail Wars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't believe this thread is still alive.  <br>To be fair they do stand out for anyone with a penis.</br>  Are short dresses really that obstructive.  For the English speakers here, what does "philanderer" means? Does it stands for "dense motherfucker"? Cause I'm watching episode 12 and it would make much sense if it does.  <br>A man who cheats on his significant other with multiple women</br>  <br>This is actually a different series though, right?</br>  Do you like idols?  <br>That terrible anatomy.</br>  <br> you will never be her bodyguard <br> she will never collapse on you and fall asleep after an exhausting concert </br></br>  <br><br><br>For some strange reason, the thing about her that gets my dick the hardest is that headband.</br></br></br>  <br>autistic edge: the post</br>    <br>MC is way too dense for one, let alone say multiple women</br>  <br>whatever makes your train roll</br>  <br>the lewdest part is when it bounces back</br>  <br>Just like every other harem MC, and yet he's still surrounded by six beautiful women who want his P in their V</br>  <br> Are trains superinteresting? <br>No, but the caboose was divine!</br></br>  <br> No bitch nails based Vestbro dick <br>It's unfair.</br></br>  I want to ride this train  Would you let her fondle your gun?  <br>This woman unironically shot bullets at the MC. No I would not let her.</br>  <br>no<br><br>I like trains</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, the train in my pants is moving so hard.</br>  ITS HAPPENING  <br>I'm seriously so fucking tired of watching it, will Sasuke get his rinnegan in the next episode already?</br>  <br>It's not. Next two epizodes are fillers.</br>  <br>In September most likely</br>  <br>you can't be serious</br>  <br>Naruto is retarded with the long ass filler.</br>  <br>Well there's two fillers for Boruto<br><br>This is where the episode ended<br>http://narutobase.net/manga/Naruto/<wbr>671/3/<br><br>Even when it gets back to canon there they still need to get the powers like in the OP, Gai does night moth, and then Naruto goes up to heal him<br><br><br>Like this guy said, the anime is retarded filler and I hardly watch it anymore</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watched Naruto The Last and it was surprisngly good<br>Usually the Anime was just a guilty pleasure to go along the manga except for some good animated fight scenes, but the movie was great<br>Almost had tears in my eyes at the outro</br></br></br>  <br> Naruto The Last and it was surprisngly good <br>It was SHIT</br></br>  <br>It has some good moments, certainly better than the other movies except for Naruto Movie 3</br>  <br>That is like your opinion man.</br>  <br>shut up it was great</br>  <br>Do you have a tier list for the movies? RtN and The Last were the only ones i watched<br><br>oh and land of the snow when i was a kid</br></br></br>  Man I want to see a NTR doujin with Hinata so bad.<br>  No matter how many clones you make, your dick is just too small to satisfy me. <br>  This is your fault you know. If you didn't neglect your family, I wouldn't have had to find another man. <br>  Are you getting hard from watching me cheat on you? How pathetic.  <br>  Come here and clear out this man's semen with your tongue you worthless worm. <br>  I can't believe you're actually doing it. You're such a fucking faggot. <br>  How did a spineless bitch like you become Hokage? You make me sick. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>agreed, i watched it today. It was filled with cliches and was just plain bad</br>  <br>I've been following this show for 10 years now. I never complained, even when it was QUALITY, even when the story went nowhere, but the current state of things makes me boil with rage.<br><br>I've always wanted to know more about the past of Gai-sensei. I'd have loved that as a filler. Just not RIGHT NOW, after an entire season of pointless fillers. Same for other characters's backstories.<br><br>Can't they just end this show already? The story is fucking over, why won't they finish the story. They know they're upsetting everyone.<br><br>I can't even remember what's going on anymore because it takes so long between episodes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MOM I POSTED IT AGAIN</br>  <br>They probably have the last episode around the time the new game comes out which is Nov 30 if i remember correctly</br>  THEY DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING GET TO THE NIGHT MOTH<br>WHAT THE FUCK IS PIERROT DOING<br>THEY CAN'T BE WAITING FOR MORE MANGA TO BE DONE<br>WHY ARE THEY DRAGGING IT SO MUCH</br></br></br>  <br>Milking the cash cow with no remorse. They can't even be bothered to have good animation for the big moments anymore. I see some random shitty new animes that have animation which far surpasses Naruto.</br>  <br>Naruto x Sasuke &gt;&gt;&gt; Naruto x Sakura &gt; Sakura x Sasuke &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Naruto x Hinata</br>  <br>Yeah, i was sad to see that the Gai scene had such bad animation considering other important fight had amazing animations all over the series</br>  <br>I really like how the current OP looks animation wise<br><br>It's a shame the show is now just shit like this</br></br></br>  <br>can you link me to a good torrent for it? every single one I've found has either no subs and korean dialogue<br> or its fucking russian.</br></br>  <br>I pretty much only watched the anime to see how some of the fights would turn out animationwise and most of them were great like Lee vs Gaara, Naruto vs Sasuke, Kakashi vs Hidan, Kakuzu or pretty much most of the Akatsuki fights<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>15035<br>I've watched this one, subs are not bad there's only one sentence missing near the end, but it's pretty much just "I did it"</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>i see it was added today, maybe could have found it if I had checked today.<br><br>Thanks, /a/non</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, they didn't get a special guest animator for Gai vs. Madara like they have for other kickass moments?</br>  <br>Nope, it was slightly better than usuall, but definitely not like the other important fights or the OP/ED animations<br>The fight is not over yet, but it seems like it won't get too much animation time after this episode since next episode is already Naruto Sasuke power time</br></br>  <br>They fucked up the flames around Gai by giving him some shitty red aura<br><br>completely ruins what the manga did, fucking studio can't even pay attention to detail</br></br></br>  <br>Ramen guy in the ending theme IT IS HAPPENING, someone post the image of him controlling Kaguya</br>  <br> eyebrows not on fire <br><br>Trash</br></br></br>  <br>Why is that slutty girl wearing a pajamas?</br>  <br>They just looked like red tape<br>Fucking stupid</br></br>  So, Hagoromo never had a third eye  Naruto is so dense, that he needed a super illusion to tell him she loves him.  Even this far into the series, Naruto still managed to check out another awful trope from shonen shows.<br><br>Supposedly he's now the chosen one.<br><br>He was already "the chosen one" because of the giant frog's prophecy, but they kind of dropped that after not too long. Now he's literally the son of the the Sage of Six paths.<br><br>And how is the Sage of Six Paths not an alien, if his mother is very clearly from somewhere not from this world?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Naruto is still jealous of Sakura and he wants her pink haired pussy instead of Hinata the personality-less talking submissive sex toy.<br><br>Like Naruto literally never shown any sign of attaction until the movie forced it onto everyone. Naruto wanted Sakura #1 and barring that he'd settle for Saskay.</br></br></br>  <br>He's not an alien, his mom is.</br>  <br>Because Hagaromo was born on earth.</br>  fuck off  <br>you are triggering us</br>  <br> There are people that unironically still believe this. </br>  Is The Last BR still on stock?  <br>As the protagonist of a shounen he was always that in one form or another, they are just calling it what it is now.<br>He also isn't chosen for anything, specifically, it's just a way for Kishi to give him and Sauce a power-up and make a strong spiritual connection between the two to explain away all the gay shit he's tried to pull with them, thinking it's basic friendship.<br>Honestly I am surprised that with the idea of transmigrants being what it is and his love of recurring themes we were not told that Obito/Kakashi and Jiraiya/Orochimaru were also previous reincarnations. Clearly needing to actually live is not part of the process (somehow).<br>It's also funny with that in mind how Rin, Tsunade and Sakura become official third wheels in any group with the two transmigrants because he did not have a third daughter.</br></br></br></br>  As a person who doesn't follow any Naruto, I just want to know where the anime is at, and where the movies are at. Is the anime caught up to the manga? If not, how can they do canon movies that take place after the anime?  <br>SP is this slow.<br>Even the video game serie will end before the anime.</br></br>  <br>The manga is finished and the anime is "almost" finished<br>The newest movie takes place after the manga, but there's also a 10 chapter Manga that takes place a few years after the movie</br></br>  <br>It's sad that the videogames do the fights better than the anime<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W14<wbr>7aPqwSm4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>   tfw used to watch this on toonami religiously filler and all  <br>Didn't even know a part 2 existed back then.</br>  <br>Fuck this shit. Just give me Boruto and the other kids already.</br>  I can't believe they are making naruto meet Hagoromo, then all the talking about past lives and wake up to take on madara in one single episode, thats really fast.  The fucking budget difference between this episode and the one before it were so obvious, it was pretty amazing. Just look at Guy before and after the OP.  <br> Even this far into the series <br><br>Naruto was called the Child of Prophecy by Jiraiya a long time ago. Like, prior to the Pain fight. That never changed.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Lom<wbr>cFkH0V9w</wbr>  [ ]<br>And then there's filler</br></br>  <br><br>It's not too surprising that the current episodes look like shit since the show's best animators are busy with the Boruto movie.</br></br>  <br>Still not as bad as the Pain fight.<br><br><br>To be fair there is supposed to be "blood vapor" emitted when the technique is in use, but it would have been hard to depict without making it similar to his normal blue vapor.<br><br>It does ruin the effect, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks great actually<br>And the Pain fight just looks weird, but the animation itself is actually really good<br>But there were way better looking fights, that's for sure<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r81<wbr>8ApIgK5w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto the last suffered from some quality moments, Boruto better have a perfect animation</br>  Guy in the previous thread who kept saying that Hagumoto having a brother is a retcon, and if he existed he would have been mentioned.<br><br>Not hearing shit otherwise.<br><br>Reason he's not remembered as much as the other brother is because Hagumoto stuck around and taught people on Earth after the battle with Ten Tails, while his brother seemingly vanished. He went to the Moon to watch over humanity and Kaguya's seal forever, to make sure this sordid history could not repeat. One of them had to stay behind and make sure she could not resurrect.<br><br>Yet even a near immortal being can apparently die after a few thousand years of nothing.<br><br>He always existed, he was shown multiple times, he was revealed at the same time Hagumoto was revealed onscreen in a character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Last had some bad CGI backgrounds but the 2D animation was sound. The Boruto movie should have even better action animation at the very least given the director though.</br>    <br>The brother is heavily involved in the plot of The Last, anyone who says he was retconned is retarded. He just had nothing to do with any of the events of the story after Kaguya's defeat. He went to space, probably to find out more about his mother, while the Sage of the Six Paths stayed with his sons.<br><br><br> And the Pain fight just looks weird, but the animation itself is actually really good <br><br>No, it looks bad. Smearing of such an absurd degree is indefensible when it lasts for that long. The smoothness isn't so good that it allows you to look past how terrible it looks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  [Screams internally]  <br> Boruto better have a perfect animation <br>It's being directed by the guy who did the Kakashi vs. Obito and Sauce vs. B fights, so I expect it to be top-notch for SP.</br></br>  <br>The Cgi wasn't that bad at least not at the same level of the last dragon ball movie, that cgi really was terrible</br>  <br>That's from the movie? Looks like something a fan put together. A shitty fan.</br>  <br>Who's the guy on the left here?<br>It isn't Sasuke, since he wasn't present at the wedding right?</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Shikamaru's face?? Oh god</br>  <br>The point up until now was that Naruto excelled and became strong out of his own will and hard work.<br><br>Now they have thrown this out the window. Naruto is simply a dunce and a loser because he was fated to be that way, people follow him because it was fated that way, and he chases after Sasuke because he was fated to do it. It has ultimately ruined the entire composition and theme of the serie.<br><br><br><br>If you fucked an alien and she gave birth of earth, your child would still be an alien. Likewise, if you had a child with another human on another planet, it would still be human baby. Hagaromo is an ayyyyylian.<br><br><br>Jiraya called him that because of his own personal beliefs, and because of the vague prophecy by the giant frog guy. It wasn't fact. Up until now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is but what else could you expect from Toei?</br>  <br>Whats wrong with his leg?</br>  <br>Smug</br>  <br>Too much smug for a single generation.</br>  <br> It wasn't fact. Up until now. <br><br>Well if you wanna get really meta all protagonists are technically the Chosen One by default, because they were chosen by the author.<br><br>Regardless, as soon as the idea was passed around that Naruto was the Chosen One, you were meant to believe it, whether there was solid proof of it or not.<br><br>Unless the author is going for the dramatic subversion, when the protagonist gets called the Chosen One, it's probably correct.<br><br>Also, not those people, but an alien is any lifeform that doesn't originate from Earth. If Hagaromo was born on Earth than by definition he isn't an alien, he's just the offspring of an alien.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now they have thrown this out the window. Naruto is simply a dunce and a loser because he was fated to be that way, people follow him because it was fated that way, and he chases after Sasuke because he was fated to do it. It has ultimately ruined the entire composition and theme of the serie <br>Watch Boruto become some part of an even larger, more convoluted prophecy.</br></br>  <br><br>It's so cheesy. It's perfect.<br><br>Naruto in love in that montage in the middle was perfect.<br><br>And goddamn does Hinata look AMAZING.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. So much crap. Made me nostalgic for the Pain fight, since him being so fucking powerful was more of a surprise. In this movie, the guy just had bullshit powers because it meant they could have long, drawn-out, explosion-filled fights.<br><br>This was the moment of pure Kishi poetry, though. People really should look in his freezer to make sure he's not hoarding eyes.</br></br></br>  <br> Pain fight. <br> Bad <br>I think this meme needs to end. This fight was amazing</br></br></br>  <br> The point up until now was that Naruto excelled and became strong out of his own will and hard work. <br>Compared to other characters, sure, it can be argued that he does indeed work hard. But what makes you think that's 'the point'?<br><br>It was the central element of Lee's subplot and Naruto did get involved in that quite a bit, plus arguably the Exam arc was the best of the series with Gaaraa, Lee, Neji and Hinata's main character conflicts and stories having a very strong entry and partial resolution even, and yes, with Naruto's hard work enabling him to fulfill his blood oath, overcome his rival whose genius, sharingan and being favored only got him so far and take out Gaara as the big bad for the arc. That's all good stuff, especially in comparison to what came later, but the hard work v. genius theme is only really present there in substance.<br><br>Naruto is a dunce and loser as a result of fate long before this reveal. His chakra control and subsequent ability to use the very basic techniques needed for his line of work are inhibited due to having the fox bound into him. He is not a book smarts but learn-by-doing kind of person, but as seen before, his ability to actually 'do' is hampered. Socially and emotionally he is very unskilled because he spent the whole of his childhood being feared and shunned, acting out and putting up a facade. All because of the fox, something out of his control, not at all dissimilar from 'fate'.<br><br>All Kishi did was add in another type of fate, this time with a capital F to try and impose some sort of structure upon the mess he wrote.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are Orochimaru and Liquid Dude the only people who can run correctly in Naruto?</br>  <br>In the manga, sure. The anime looks fucking ridiculous.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kXh<wbr>AGO4IE8Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Ridiculous, but amazing. The average Narutard knows jack shit about good animation anyway so that video proves nothing. Shingo Yamashita could've toned down the quash and stretch for some of his shots, but otherwise his work in that episode is amazing.</br>  <br> Amurican humor </br>  <br>What's so amazing about it? It flows well but half the time it looks like something out of a Picasso. From a purely technical standpoint I'm sure it's great, but it looks fucking bonkers.</br>  Gotta finish taking care of some stuff, so I'm gonna have to push this back an hour to 10pm CDT, so hang tight.

Fuck the anime <br>That doesn't make it any better.</br></br>  Why even participate in the Grail War when people can summon unbeatable demi-Gods like Gilgamesh? He only loses to plot-convenience, asspull shield of fairy magic and "Ea is too good for you".  Yadayadayada once in a lifetime opportunity yadayadayada some root yadayadayada mage's pride yadayadayada associated artifacts aren't necessarily easy to find so you might luck out yadayadayada  Because most heroes are more balanced, and the chance of him being summoned is fairly low out of all the other heroes and means of obtaining catalysts.  <br>I'm assuming the same heroes aren't summoned that often unless the summoner has something that ties to them specifically. Saber was only re-summoned because Excalibur's scabbard is inside Shirou and Gil was only around because he never left after Zero</br>   is a copy made by the Grail <br> calls other people fakers <br><br>Fatefags explain this.</br></br></br>  <br> and the chance of him being summoned is fairly low out of all the other heroes and means of obtaining catalysts. <br>Meanwhile he's the single most reoccurring character within the Fate franchise topping even Saber in terms of how many grail wars he's featured in.</br></br>  Because they're so lazy that they can't come up with another antagonist.  <br>And only two of those are proper summonings out of X amount of grail wars. In Apo with hundreds of wars going on, his catalysts are dried up and make him impossible to forcibly summon.</br>  Question. It said that had Lancer had a better master/resorted to other tactics, he couldve won the war. How would Diarmuid even do anything to Gil? Gae Dearg before GOB? Im confused.  <br>Kayneth would have waited for Lancelot or Saber to be the last man standing.</br>  <br>It probably assumes that Gil does something stupid and gets ganked by someone. It's not like Deermud would solo the whole thing by himself.</br>  <br>By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lancer:<br><br>Kayneth must not let his Servant recognize such things as honour on the battle field or knights' pride. He must let Diarmuid realize that the Holy Grail War was merely dirty chores that needed to be done.<br><br>In order to fulfill the previous item, Kayneth must avoid any contact between Diarmuid and Saber with his best effort.<br><br>In combat, Kayneth must prioritize securing an exit. In a battle, missions would be considered accomplished if Diarmuid scored one hit with Gae Buidhe. Repeat this tactic, and exhaust all hostile teams.<br><br>Capitalize on Team Berserker. Team Berserker was a powerful enemy against all other teams, but Lancer had an advantage due to compatibility. It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there any heroes or NP who can defeat Saber with Avalon protection on ?  <br>Hit and run tactics? Would that work?</br>  Why even participate in the Grail War when the grail is useless and you will never reach the root?  <br>Against Gil, probably not. He should have thousands of healing NPs, one of which could certainly reverse the effects of the curse, assuming Deermud could even land a hit on him. Probably more of something like Gil fights Saber, Berserker interrupts, Gil wounds Berserker and goes back to Saber, and then distracted Gil gets his head cut off by Berserker.</br>  <br>Jack.</br>  Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Cybele. Nuff said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them. <br>R U N E S<br>U<br>N<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Iskander <br> Could go either way <br>Yeah, against the guy who literally fought armies for breakfast by himself, has an Anti-Army NP and a one hit kill NP. Not to mention pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Medusa is such a shit character.</br>  <br>Armies of regular soldiers, maybe a hero or two tossed in here or there. These guys are all Servants. It's not going to be repeated one-hit kills or anything like that. They're all a viable threat to him unlike fodder familiars. Think CoB's golems but more dangerous and more numerous. Gae Bolg would be lucky to take out hundreds, not amounting to anything grand in the face of tens of thousands.</br>  <br>Fate/HA makes her better.</br>  <br><br>No, they're not all Heroic Spirits. There are a lot of Heroic Spirits amongst Iskander's army, but most are ordinary soldiers for obvious reasons (like his messenger he sent to meet Waver while he was holding off the big Cthulhu monster).</br></br>  <br> Not to mention pic related. <br><br>That rune only makes it so neither party its cast on can retreat, not that no one else can interfere.<br><br>It would be full retard to cast it in that situation, it would just mean Cu cannot move when the rest of the army attacks him. The other guy can't move either, but others can get involved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all heroes of their own making according to the text. And Mithrenes was some notable commander of his army.</br>  <br><br>Probably not, but at the same time, Saber can't defeat anyone while she's in Avalon due to, you know, being in another dimension. It's an absolute defense, but by the same token, makes offense impossible. That's why she had to drop out of Avalon in order to finish Gil off, and why she couldn't have just turned on godmode at the start of the fight. As Saber pointed out mentally during the battle, the path she was following was the only way for her to win. She needed to bait Gil into using Ea so that she could reflect it back with Avalon. If she had just started off by turtling inside Avalon, Gilgamesh would have just waited for the moment she dropped out and blown her away.</br></br>  <br>I know but her F/SN presence is so bad.</br>  Gill a shit.<br> grab Gil's NPs <br> stick them in the ground everywhere <br> run and jump like a ginger <br> throws the NPs back as needed <br> Unlimited Theft Works <br> Gill get's desperate, and pulls out EA <br> Lancelot uses Arondight to chop Gills arm off before he uses it <br>Like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Gil can literally wreck him, Saber, Rider, Lancer, Caster, and Assassin in a single night all by himself.</br>  <br><br>They're not all heroes by definition. Heroes are those who stand out amongst the rest. While it's true that humanity was simply stronger back during the Age of Gods, it is also true that the heroes of that era were that much superior to the rest or else they would not have become legends. <br><br>The vast majority of Iskander's army has to be 'ordinary', but they can still be relatively powerful. That being said, the same goes for the armies that Cu Chulainn defeated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe<br><br>They have gone out of their way to say there's no such thing as an omnipotent NP in reality. Everything has checks and balances.<br><br>You could hover blades or release some kind of virus in the area so that the second she rematerialized into the world, she dies. There's a reason she didn't just activate it at the beginning of the battle with GIl, and instead kept it secret like a trump card. She wasn't taking chances, she was playing smart, she wasn't letting the chance that it might be countered exist by only showing it when it was too late for Gil to do anything.<br><br>The possibilities might exist that there's a strategy around it, but she used it in a way that didn't allow the opponent to think around it at all. Which was the smartest thing she's ever done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance. <br>Or Cu can just stall out his army until Gaia finally gets off her ass and breaks his RM, then Cu wrecks his shit when he's low on mana.</br></br>  <br><br>He was going to die to the 32 NP burst. Urobuchi agreed, don't bother him about it.</br></br>  <br>Nah, Lancelot literally BTFO Gill in that dog fight. If he didn't have such a Saber Boner he could've won the war.</br>  <br>Gil is the weakest and a shit:<br><br> TMF : Bon, ben la dernière question de l’interview. Si Gilgamesh était sérieux quand il combattait Saber, qui gagnerait ? <br> U : Le problème est qu’un Gilgamesh sérieux, ça n’existe pas. Mais, si jamais ça arrivait et qu’il combattait Saber, aucun ne gagnerait. C’est Nasu qui l’a dit. <br><br> TMF : If Gilgamesh was serious when fighting Saber, who would win? <br> Uro : The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. But, if that were to ever happen and he was fighting Saber. No one would win. Nasu said so. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. <br><br>The moment Iskander comes in close, he's done. He has no defense against Gae Bolg, and if Lancer uses his runes he can prevent Iskander from being able to retreat. If Iskander pops his reality marble, all Cu has to do is play keep away until Iskander runs out of power. Keep in mind that Cu fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours straight. If he goes full defense, he's practically unkillable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He was going to die to the 32 NP burst. Urobuchi agreed, don't bother him about it. <br> He doesn't know that Urobuchi contracted himself when other servants with shitter stats than Lancelot surviving greater numbers volumes later </br></br>  <br>Do you have anymore quotes? That sounds pretty interesting.</br>  <br> Serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist <br><br>We've seen it a few times now<br><br>Its a bit outdated to say that<br><br> Gil: "This woman is a worthy oponent. My chains and sword, let me use them as I please, Master!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh, and Gilgamesh was just playing around with his Gate of Babylon spam too - only a few of his shots went anywhere near Iskander to begin with. It was nothing like when he pinpoint targeted Lancelot with each and every shot.</br></br>  <br> Cu fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours straight <br>That was pure speculation, and even if it was true, it's more likely that was because Gil was toying with Cu instead of simply using Enkidu from the beginning.</br></br>  <br>No, the text literally says they're all heroic spirits of their own accord. Even the horse.</br>  <br> In legend, the dying Cú Chulainn tied himself to a tree, and then took his final breath facing the enemy army. True to his legendary tenacity, he struggles fiercely on the verge of death. Cú Chulainn demonstrated miraculous determination even in a hopeless fight, continuing to stall Gilgamesh for half a day. </br>  <br><br>It's not speculation, I'm pretty sure it's said outright in the VN. You also don't fight against Gilgamesh that long without him becoming bored unless he's not just playing around.</br></br>  <br> That was pure speculation <br><br>It isn't, Its literally stated in CM<br><br> Battle Continuation: A <br> In legend, the dying Cú Chulainn tied himself to a tree, and then took his final breath facing the enemy army. True to his legendary tenacity, he struggles fiercely on the verge of death. Cú Chulainn demonstrated miraculous determination even in a hopeless fight, continuing to stall Gilgamesh for half a day. <br> When facing Emiya, who dexterously fended off spear thrusts with his dual swords, Cú Chulainn unyieldingly stood his ground. <br><br>Dunno why people have to get autistic about that one "No it didn't happen, doesn't count", as though it offends them.<br><br>Says that Battle Continuation was the greatest part of how he was able to keep going.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure Nasu retconned that in an interview somewhere for the exact reasons I just gave.</br></br>  <br> It's not speculation, I'm pretty sure it's said outright in the VN <br>Yes, by Shirou, in speculation.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh got bored after twenty minutes fighting against Lancelot<br><br>You think he was having so fun of a time against Cu that he just never wanted it to end? I can guarantee ten minutes into that he was quite furious.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Yes, by Shirou, in speculation. <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh, and Gilgamesh was just playing around with his Gate of Babylon spam too <br> Iskander clearly avoided them Gilgamesh in that fight went a bit more serious than usual out of respect for Iskander. The only real thing that fucked him up was the chains. <br>  It was nothing like when he pinpoint targeted Lancelot with each and every shot. <br>Lancelot is a small and fast target or smaller hit box and harder to get a lock on him. He would've got out of the line of fire with his A+ agility.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, JETS wouldn't be as easy or fun to banter with as Cu.<br> He probably did get furious after at most an hour, but I like fan canon that Gil was taking the opportunity to sort through his treasury since he doesn't know everything he owns </br></br>  <br>There was mention on BL where he contradicts himself in the same sentence saying they are heroes and aren't heroes. It was never translated.</br>  <br>In Gil's defence, part of the reason for Iskander's extra long charge was Waver's Command Seal to tell him to win the fight.</br>  <br><br> Iskander clearly avoided them Gilgamesh in that fight went a bit more serious than usual out of respect for Iskander. <br><br>There was no way Iskander could avoid 80 noble phantasms even on a horse. He knocked one or two away and took a couple wounds from others, and the rest just rained down all around him. If you ask me, Gilgamesh was just being courteous and making his last charge look cool out of respect. The only 'serious' thing he did was use Ea to destroy Iskander's reality marble, use his chains to stop Iskander in his tracks, and then kill him with Ea personally. <br><br> Lancelot is a small and fast target or smaller hit box and harder to get a lock on him. <br><br>He's not that much smaller than Iskander. He's a big guy. He's fast thanks to his agility, but nowhere near as fast as anyone on a mount, like Iskander. Remember that he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot <br>Oh fuck off, idiot. That was because he was concentrating on Saber and Iskander literally charged in to Lancelot's blind spot. If Lancelot had noticed Iskander coming in, he never would have been hit.</br></br>  <br>Kuzuki would probably still kick her ass</br>  <br><br>Lancelot did notice the charge. He simply failed to get out of the way in time, regardless, because chariots are faster than anyone on foot. That's why Riders are known for their mobility and partially why Achilles, who has a Noble Phantasm that makes him faster than even mounts, is so ridiculously overpowered.</br></br>  <br>Not much about Gil, but here's the whole interview:<br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/<br><br>For the fate stuff, the most interesting parts is that Tokiomi knew the kind of treatment Sakura got, but he didn't give a shit, although he would have refused to give Sakura away if he knew Zouken was just using her as a womb and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. Also the Sakura Vs Rin is the best thing to ever happen to the Tohsaka family.<br>There is no gate of bayblon inside the gate of babylon.<br>Kiri views Taiga as a sister, but she's in love with him.<br>He didn't answer whether Waver will join Ionioi Hetairoi after he dies, it's a question of Waver's immortality he says. <br><br>Not fate related, but Butcher worked as a programmer before trying writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>At that point Iskander' lost his connection with Waver which the command seals made substitute of not having a master. <br><br> There was no way Iskander could avoid 80 noble phantasms<br>He simply did he used all his running speed and used his sword to knock them away while a few pierced him. <br> He's not that much smaller than Iskandar. <br>He is and we are talking about Iskandar on foot. Not with the chariot also that's due the fact Lancelot clearly having such a Saber Boner that he failed to get out of the way in time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://comipress.com/article/2007/1<wbr>0/12/2786<br><br> And it isn't embarrassing to have one of your older works dug up? <br><br>Nasu Kinoko: Of course it is, yes. Kara no Kyoukai was something I wrote when I was at my most inexperienced; now that, after ten years, it's risen from the grave like this -well, it's not exactly "The Monkey's Paw" (*1), but there's still sort of an "I should've stopped it" feeling.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  Question.<br>Is the Grail at this point even still usable?<br>Can it be fixed?</br></br>  <br>Not likely japan's grail will be forever fucked up. This is why Waver and Rin permanently stopped it for good.</br>  <br>Can they just make a new one?</br>  <br>Fuyuki one? Not really<br><br>It'll grant a wish, but only in the sense that it'll kill everyone while doing it.<br><br>There are many grails out there though.<br><br>Grail is anything that can grant a wish, and there are over 700 citings to date. Ironically the actual holy grail cannot be counted as one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wish <br>But the grail is not actually a wish granting device.<br>It's a ritual used to reach root.</br></br></br>  <br>Command Spells /= Master connection. What Waver did was ceremoniously say "I have no possible control over you, so I'm no longer your Master." He was still connected until Rider died.</br>  <br>Thanks for sharing, French friend.</br>  <br>You don't get it<br><br>Even if its not its main function, its still something that can grant a wish. That much is confirmed that it can do this. Even though the families lied about its real purpose, it can still technically do some things.<br><br>In the sense that with near unlimited prana you can do basically anything.<br><br>The Mooncell wasn't created to be a wishing device, its something that observes all of the world and galaxy to collect all information ever. It can however still technically grant a wish, so its considered a holy grail.<br><br>It was not made to do it, it was built to do far bigger things, but if it can do it, then it qualifies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, anything that can grant a wish can be used to reach Root?</br>  <br>Nasu is very insecure about his writing, and tries all the time to get better:<br><br> Takeuchi: Fate prototype existed on looseleaf, handwritten pages. We made photocopies of the original and then carefully stored the original manuscript for safekeeping. A lot has changed since then, but some special lines and other things from it still remain. As an example, in the original the Assassin Servant took on the identity of Sasaki Kojirou.  <br> <br> Interviewer: If we can find the time, I'd love to see the original. <br><br> Nasu: If that text became known to others, I would have to take my own life. I don't like the prose I wrote back when I was in middle school. You wouldn't even need to use a katana to cut me down if that got out.  <br> <br> Urobuchi: No, I'm sure you've forgotten the content as the years went by. If you looked over it now and released it, you'd be absolutely fine. From a critical and objective viewpoint, you can say "Wow, this greenhorn punk is really trying hard."  <br> <br> Nasu: Now that you've seen through me like a pane of glass, I wonder things are really that different even after all these years. It's embarrassing and weak - a double blend that will surely do me in. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   TMF: Do Tokiomi knew what was suffered Sakura after it was adopted by the Mato? <br> U: What is important is not to Tokiomi parentage but magical progress in his family. So it is aware of having literally threw his daughter. One can imagine that Tokiomi says that through his beloved daughter, he will arrive to have higher thaumaturgic powers. <br><br>[Outside interview]<br> Tokiomi knew what was going to undergo Sakura but for him, it would allow it to become a real magician. As long as it increases the potential thaumaturgical of his family, he had no problem with Sakura treatments in Mato. However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused. He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. Unconsciously, even if he would never have said, the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br> By against Aoi knew nothing. <br><br>Google translate does French a lot better than it does Japanese at least</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are those the 2x2=Shinobuden ninjas?</br>   But in this universe, any mage can collect mana thanks to sperm. <br><br>French TM fans are awesome.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Le Jour J <br><br>What does it mean?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>When something is expected to happen on a certain day and you're anticipating it, that day's called the "Jour J". It's a way to describe a special upcoming day during which you expect a certain event to take place.<br>I don't know how to explain it clearly though.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Interesting.<br><br>So 100% EA can't break through it? This thing seems to rip apart everything when maxed out. (world, dimension, RM, ect)<br><br>What about Nero's NP? The one that ignores the opponent's defense.<br><br>Anyway, I mostly agree that Avalon is a trump card. Saber needed to rely on the surprise effect since she's inoffensive when using it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   TMF: One last question Fate / Zero before moving on. How would he have reacted Tokiomi learning his relationship with Rin in Unlimited Blade Works and Sakura in Heaven's Feel? [Laughs] <br> U: It is not impossible that he would have been green with rage because it would penalize her magical power quest. <br><br>People that go "Tokomi would be on his head with joy if he heard about Shirou banging his daughters, I mean a reality marble user, that's top class" BTFO suddenly. No that was never going to be his reaction there.<br><br>No reality marbles are not hereditary, and he would have just seen Shirou as an abysmal waste at best. At worst he'd either dissect Shirou himself or call the magic cops to place a sealing order on him, because Tokiomi is the standard magus and that's what they do. When you find a heretic you report it, as even Rin mentions.<br><br>Reality Marble is ones internal world, it doesn't help to go to someone else and its not something the child gets, or else a lot more people would be running around with the. Its like saying that if Buhhda had a child, that child would automaticall receive Enlightenment.<br><br>Its more about the mind and perception, potential, understanding of the user. All humans can use a reality marble with enough time, but it usually takes hundreds of years to figure it out, which is why DAA tend to have them.<br><br>All Shirou would be is a deterrent to their talent for him<br><br>No he wouldn't be well received.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kara no Kyoukai interview  <br>Pretty much, Tokiomi would have treated Shirou just like Kariya.</br>  <br>And here I am still waiting for Siegfried to be summon...</br>  <br>dot dot dot</br>  <br>Would he? I mean especially if it was the Shirou who beat Gilgamesh. He certainly wouldn't like Shirou, but he might be pretty cautious not to piss him off.</br>  <br> He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. <br><br>Is he stupid? She's eight years old and was never taught a single thing in terms of magecraft, even if she has "potential". Due to the way his craft works, the second he starts working on the target and starts "training them" they cannot go against him at all, or else they will be eaten alive from the inside out since he has things inside of them. Tokiomi knows all of this basically, yet his backup plan is the eight year old child to deal with the centuries old far more advanced and smart magus.<br><br>This is stupid, he's stupid, that's not a plan.<br><br>She was in a position where she couldn't do shit, and he knew it.<br><br>He would have to teach her at least one spell for this to actually be a plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wins via Lancelot killing everyone.</br>  <br>It doesn't, it assumes Lancelot wrecks Gil. Stop making shit up. The quote is clear.<br><br> It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point. </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you actually read the interview in question<br><br> By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lancer: <br><br> Kayneth must not let his Servant recognize such things as honour on the battle field or knights' pride. He must let Diarmuid realize that the Holy Grail War was merely dirty chores that needed to be done. <br> In order to fulfill the previous item, Kayneth must avoid any contact between Diarmuid and Saber with his best effort. <br> In combat, Kayneth must prioritize securing an exit. In a battle, missions would be considered accomplished if Diarmuid scored one hit with Gae Buidhe. Repeat this tactic, and exhaust all hostile teams. <br> Capitalize on Team Berserker. Team Berserker was a powerful enemy against all other teams, but Lancer had an advantage due to compatibility. It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point.  <br><br>If that strategy can be followed to a key, then he can win easily enough<br><br>Notice it says its "Optimal" to use Lancelot, not "necessary" like some people think.<br><br>If he can cripple everyone, run away, keep using hit and run tactics, and let others deal with the cripple, he can win. Just focus on surviving at the utmost.<br><br>No it isn't just as simple as "Let Lancelot do all the work" like some people think, that would only be optimal to use him. However if he keeps up the hit and run tactics and crippling people, he will weaken them enough to be taken down. Just focus on survival.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disproven later volumes by Iskander. He was called Gil Arch Nemesis a volume after the 32 NPs statement. Shirou Saber also survived a number higher than 32.</br>  <br>You're the one interpreting it backwards.<br><br>"Quote is clear, Lancelot does everything" is entirely wrong<br><br>"It would be optimal to use them", is correct.<br><br>No it isn't just Lancelot, and yes you are the one reading it wrong. See here <br><br>No its not "Just Lancelot is all, he beats everyone", it doesn't even say he's necessary, Dair can do it alone, but its optimal to abuse this glitch. Not "Berserker is omnipotent against everyone, while Dair hides in the corner" like you say, Lancelot only has a chance with Dairmund crippling everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just a general stratagem. It doesn't literally mean Lancelot does all the work. It's not Deermud vs the other five and Lancelot vs the other five. It's everybody vs everybody. The other Servants aren't going to sit around doing nothing while all this happens.</br>  <br> If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh <br>No he wasn't, Iskander has no Battle Continuation. He was completely fine. Injured, but none of the hits managed to be fatal.<br><br> only a few of his shots went anywhere near Iskander to begin with. <br>Animefag.<br> With haughty growls, the rain of stars approached. Incessantly, mercilessly, the impacts trampled over their bodies <br><br><br>Literally only a boost in prana supply and nothing else, confirmed by the novel.<br> As long as he aspired toward the action of 'victory', Rider would receive an amplified amount of Prana support compared to normal.  <br><br> Remember that he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot. <br>Lancelot noticed too late to react because he was focused on Saber, stated in the novel.<br> Lancer quickly flipped backwards and avoided the chariot in time. But for Berserker, who kept all his attention of Saber, he didn’t even have time to turn around and register what was going on. <br><br>It really feels like Gilfags never read the novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lance <br>Needs to follow all the steps to win.<br><br> Lancelot only has a chance with Dairmund crippling everyone. <br>Lancelot is crippled too, all hostile teams. Not like Gil loses much by being crippled, his power is still at full force.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> The other Servants aren't going to sit around doing nothing while all this happens. <br>No they won't sit around, they will be getting wrecked by Lancelot.<br> Berserker destroy the other teams </br></br></br>  <br> The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. <br>Gilfags BTFO.</br></br>  <br>Read the words in the entry. "Optimally" Berserker helps their agenda by taking out other Servants. They cannot control Berserker or who he fights. All they can do is just not use Deermud's advantage over him until the end. And again, other Servants are going to be fighting eachother as well. Maybe Rider takes out Saber while Berserker hounds on Gil. Maybe Assassin kills Caster's master. It's all full of variables. The main thing is that in no reasonable way is Berserker going to manage to take out five Servants, wounded or not.</br>  <br>CCC and strange fake.</br>  <br>Because they lose due to plot convenience and LOLmongrel</br>  <br> Implying Strange Fake is serious Gil <br>Look at True Archer. He refused to go serious against someone who could fuck his entire life up.</br></br>  <br> there still not being a great OVA including Jeanne, Nero, Astolfo, and Sieg with Karna and Li Shuwen <br>Why so slow, Type Moon?</br></br>  <br> Not like Gil loses much by being crippled, his power is still at full force. <br><br>Having a gaping wound that never heals would slow you down a lot, mentally even.<br><br>He needs his mind to control his gates, yet each time it throbbed he would be distracted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Against Enkidu at least.</br>  <br>It was noted when he fought Enkidu that he went all out with everything he had, both his GoB and Ea all at the same time at full power. Text says if he gave anything less he would be dead in seconds.</br>  <br>He fought Enkidu seriously though in the desert.</br>  It's funny how Diarmuid can win the 4th HGW by doing massive hit and runs.  <br>Using Berserker is one of the steps, if he doesn't follow the steps, there is no win.<br><br> They cannot control Berserker or who he fights. <br>You require to defeat all the other Masters in order to win the War, so in a way, if they hide, they can make sure Lancelot doesn't go against them.<br><br> And again, other Servants are going to be fighting eachother as well. <br>Yet it's said that Lancelot would fuck up ALL THE OTHER TEAMS. No some of the others, ALL OF THEM.<br><br> in no reasonable way is Berserker going to manage to take out five Servants <br>Who said he was going to do it against everyone at the same time?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing? It only goes to prove even further that Uro is right, getting Gil to go serious is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty amazing that he could do that strategy on maybe 5 to 6 other Servants and get away with it.<br><br>Then again, he could probably defeat Iskander in his RM too.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes you gotta play like a scrub when you have a scrub servant.</br>  <br>CCC, and yes, being serious = being serious even if only for one opponent.</br>  <br>You're the one who can't read, it only says it would help if he used him, not that it was necessary.<br><br>It would make it a lot smoother, but they flat out say its only optimal rather than utmost a piece.</br></br></br>  <br>Diarmuid is a legendary army killer that wiped out thousands of men in a couple of hours iirc. He also has eye of the mind, man.</br>  <br> Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing? <br><br>It was something that occurred, it was confirmed he was serious in that moment, so yes whatever you're trying to say you sound full of it. He was entirely serious there.<br><br>Also CCC has the game goes on he starts getting pushed to his limits and forced to fight things that even his full power realistically cannot match, as he has to go a bit beyond and while admitting he's at his utmost.<br><br>Using Ea without hesitation upon being asked, type serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He still acts like a scrub.</br>  <br>Optimally, best case scenario, ideal outcome, most favorable situation, the most compatible series of events, ect. I.E., if things work out that way, that would best help their situation. What about that do you not comprehend?</br>  Why would anyone summon servants like Alexander the Great or Francis Drake or Nero who we KNOW thanks to the historical record are just ordinary humans and not legendary supermen unlike ancient mythological figures? You're basically summoning from that awful middle era when magic is degraded compared to ancient times but science has yet to advance to the combat potential of the modern day.  <br> Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing?  <br>Are you implying this fight didn't actually happen?</br></br>  <br> You're the one who can't read, it only says it would help if he used him, not that it was necessary. <br>Capitalize on Team Berserker, stop trying to argue something that is clear, it's a waste of time. He needs Lancelot, it's nowhere implied he can win without him. If he does it himself he might actually get killed by Assassin.<br><br> but they flat out say its only optimal rather than utmost a piece. <br>Not at all, they said he needs to follow the steps, step 4 is one of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What about that do you not comprehend? <br>What about following all steps is necessary don't you understand?</br></br>  <br>Francis Drake has an ability that makes it so nothing is impossible for her if she seriously reaches for it. Her NP is one + away from the same rank as Excalibur, its A+ rank, the second highest imaginable in a way. Because her boat is an ultimate sort of legend that made it past the ultimate storm, made it into Avalon, and was piloted by Cain.<br><br>Nero has an ability that gives her any ability she wants, and rewrites the world so she's in charge entirely within a space. Not like a reality marble, but even greater.<br><br>Ishkandar is noted to be a top rank servant who can summon thousands of other servants, not just nameless people but servants. Anyone from any of his summonings that agrees to join him, is in the RM marble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The step is capitalize on Berserker. From that step, the most ideal outcome would be if Berserker soloed all of them. That's not going to happen, but it would be easy street if it did.</br>  <br><br><br>I only go serious when I see a pink Elephant, does that count as valid? Because that's exactly what happened in Strange Fake.<br><br> CCC <br>He started as an idiot too, needed power that he never had in order to do what he did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's not going to happen <br>If it wasn't going to happen then the strategy wouldn't be an absolute victory strategy. All the steps are needed, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but reading the historical record wouldn't tell you that. None of their NPs or abilities are things that they actually had in life.</br>  <br>If you're claiming that you're never once serious, but go serious the one rare time some crazy guy steals and paints an elephant, you're wrong.<br><br>He becomes serious long before that. The second he allows Hakuno to use Ea as they please, he's serious. He just comes up against a hard wall later on.</br></br></br>  <br>Famous people become concepts upon death<br><br>You can say that Shakespeare couldn't break planets when he was alive or anything, but you can realize if you know how servants work at all "This guy is pretty famous, so he's bound to have some strange or interesting ability".<br><br>No matter what servant it is, if they made it into the throne then they have something going for them, some usage. Even if they weren't a warrior in life, in death they are a concept. You just have to realize what kind of concept it is by thinking about it backwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You claimed "Getting Gilgamesh to be serious is impossible!", Enkidu showed up, Gil fought seriously against Enkidu, it's possible.<br>Case closed.</br></br>  <br> If you're claiming that you're never once serious <br>I saw an Elephant painted in pink ink when I was a kid and I went serious that day. Never happened again though. The realistic chances of me being serious are around 0.00000000000000001, so it's safe to say serious me doesn't exist, even if there is still some chance of me being serious.<br><br><br> The second he allows Hakuno to use Ea as they please, he's serious <br>Still started as a retard, he only found another pink Elephant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You claimed <br>I didn't, Uro did, are you claiming you know more than Uro about the Fate Universe?</br></br>   talking about shit like this <br>Why not just have a contest about which Saber enjoys the BBC instead? That's probably more productive and might spur an anon to draw Saber having sex with a lot of them.</br>  Enkidu and Gilgamesh had a serious fight?  <br>You freely admit serious Gil exists. The rate of occurrence does not matter. The three times he has been fully serious out of a billion possible chances still means he has been serious three times. You can freely claim he is very rarely, close to never, serious, but serious Gil exists.</br>  <br> Uro : The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. But, if that were to ever happen and he was fighting Saber. No one would win. Nasu said so. <br>Even Uro accepted it could happen, but realistically speaking, it just wouldn't.</br></br>  <br>I'm not claiming to know more about the Nasuverse than Uro (Hell, he isn't even Nasu so what does it matter) but that quote of his has been completely contradicted by later works such as CCC and Strange fake.</br>    I love it  Will she ever be happy?  <br>Yes, and she probably will die when it happens.</br>  <br>Maybe when shes 18</br>  Would you solicit Tomoko  to take a walk with you?   <br> take a walk with you <br><br>Is that what they're calling it these days?</br></br></br>  <br>Gently?</br>  <br><br>Go check out VICE's piece on JK in Tokyo.

Isn't that something you're supposed to do though?</br>  <br>Yes but drawing from imagination is a lot harder if you want to make natural poses. <br>Having a refrence to go by makes it a lot easier.</br></br>  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  <br>Hey, In the last thread I was told to check in tomorrow which is today so... how's the request with Lum and that Pontiac coming along?</br>  <br>Well, "today" isn't over is it?</br>  <br>OKAY, okay, sorry if I'm being impatient.

I just plan to make sure I have a request in mind by Friday.</br></br>  <br>I have all my requests lined up.</br>  <br>I usually just come up with a request when I wake up on Friday, unless it's a holiday like the 4th which I planned two weeks in advance.</br>  <br>I come up with a request to request for my waifu usually by the end of the previous waifu threads.<br><br>That or by Wednesday, mostly.<br> Then again, I'm always requesting in drawthreads, so coming up with things to request kind of just clicks. </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Ogiue from Genshiken being spanked by a floating hand. <br><br> I love her so much </br></br>  <br>I request for a couple weeks, stop requesting after a few deliveries altogether, take a few weeks at least off from requesting, just post in the thread and appreciate the art, then request again. I've been off from requesting for like 3 weeks now, but I think I'll come back this weekend maybe. I just don't want to be greedy. If I get things I feel like I shouldn't ask for too much more so others will have a better chance too. I just want us all to be a little happier.

Fuck off.</br>  <br>Well also, my waifu has TONS of fanart already in general. A lot of these anons have waifus from more obscure series that don't get to see new images of her just by checking a few pixiv artists' pages. But then, at the same time, I really like the idea of an anon drawing a picture of her specifically for me, so I still do.

Didn't salmon do this?</br>  <br>Didnt you get something of that last weekend?</br>  <br><br>you mean the one of her in her casual wear in like PAris or something?</br></br>  <br>I do it.

The little girl reminds me of when E.T was wearing that sweater.</br>  <br>No, I think it's rude to just give advice when no one is asking for it. Especially if you aren't someone who actually knows a lot regarding the subject.</br>  Requesting something cute with Michiru (from Plastic Memories) with her haircut from the last episode.  <br>This is nice, this is a nice image.</br>  <br>Holy fuck. <br>Thanks for that, ASoC, I needed something to listen to.</br></br>  <br>Ayylliott</br>  <br>That's hot.

I wish my computer crashed instead because at least photoshop would have autosaved a backup for me.</br>  Wifu?  <br>Sad how true this is.<br><br>My first criticism for you would be to stop calling them shitty.</br></br></br>    <br>where i will draw her</br>  <br>In about 10 hours.</br>  I want to try to request Tamamo having sex like http://i.imgur.com/WsUbRBo.jpg with her front flap covering the genitals  <br>Tommorrow.</br>  <br>You really should say something if you can see it looks wrong. <br>Of course it's if you can identify whats wrong. <br>If you just say something vague like "The face looks off" or my personal favorite "It's shit." you might as well say nothing. <br><br>They know it's shit, if they knew why they would fix it. Since they haven't fixed it you need to say why it's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  /r/ing girls in gags, please  <br>I tried. Hope this is fine?</br>  <br>New colorfag here. How do you choose your colors so that they fit with each other when you're shading?</br>  <br>Is 4chin kinda broken to anyone else? some images won't load</br>  <br>Do you really think they fit or are you being sarcastic? (It's too late, I can't tell)<br>Anyway, I can't really explain how, like I don't really have a specific method.I just randomly throw them together until I think it looks ok. <br>I do color on one layer most of the time, if that helps?</br></br></br>  Question for drawfags. Does someone not rerequesting after you said it's okay to rerequest make you feel good? Or do you feel indifferent to it.  <br>It at least makes me feel better than when someone rerequests but it could have several reasons other than OP being satisfied with your drawing so I guess it's nothing to be happy about.</br>  <br>That forest is absolutely beautiful  I really like the addition of the deer . Thanks a ton</br>  <br>I was being serious. I asked because I really like the way you painted the skin for the person and the shark, even though it's got a blue here and a purple there, it all seems to fit together. I was kind of curious as to how that works together, because it looks really good.</br>  <br>It's never happened. Because I'm better than average, for one, and second because anyone who ever actually rerequests gets anally raped by other requesters.<br><br>Because I generally put effort into my deliveries I would be annoyed if it did happen, because the only reason I could imagine for someone to do it is to purposefully offend me.<br><br>If I was terrible I'd be a little sad but not offended.</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting this scene with Mimibro-tan and Mimi.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/K8NW9qT.jpg<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/HfaN4FO.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are some good colors</br>  <br>Thanks a bunch then. <br>It's blue-ish at some parts because I color in the whole artwork with a color like blue and purple first, lock it and then just use a brush that smudges the colors well to color and shade. It's easier to keep it all in the same color spectrum this way, which automatically makes drawings look more harmonic altogether.<br>Link related: http://livepaintinglessons.com/gamu<wbr>tmask.php</wbr></br></br></br>  Give advice and/or tell me that i'm shit<br><br><br>got a tumblr/DA?<br>it's to give you credit <br><br><br> Happy Hanukkah </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that his mom?</br>  <br>Do you feel the same when it's an open request?</br>  <br><br>Delivered.<br>I've been working on this during my breaks, I hope you like it.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's his girlfriend.</br>  <br>Looks pretty good for just flatcolor. Is it going to stay like this or are you gonna add more shadow/lightning?</br>    <br>That is meaty.<br><br>Hope this means we get some chubby lolis later.</br></br></br>  <br>Noice. Not a fan of the fingernails though.</br>  <br>It's absolutely stunning anon, those feathers are just magnificent to look at too.<br><br>Thank you so much</br></br></br>  <br>Noooooooooooo.</br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br><br>The feathers are just a brush with some overlay effects tho... But I'm happy you like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really timid with the lighting. If you're going for rim lighting at least up the contrast. Also make it bigger.</br>  <br>Not sure what you mean by "open".<br><br>Like, "draw your own interpretation of X"?<br><br>Nah, I wouldn't care. More people who do that, the less of a faggot I feel like for trying it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot, anon. I still don't really get it, but I'll look around and see if I can find anything besides that link. <br>I've just been coloring in base colors and then gradually darkening the shade like a gradient.</br></br>  <br>In general, a child's body isn't that different from an adult's, especially in anime. Heads are generally bigger, and they don't have developed shoulders and waists yet, but the other proportions are about the same.<br>In your drawing, her head's not actually connected to her spine. Her arm and leg bones are inconsistent in length, causing her to look lanky also.<br>I hope this helps.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks m8!</br>    There's nothing wrong with girls being big and soft!  <br>I hope you choke and die on a double dipped corndog ycake.</br>  <br>Is there a way to rotate the shape?<br><br><br>It is going to stay like that unfortunately. I just wanted to get something done for the day.<br><br><br>It was not meant to be rim light. But I can see why you thought that.<br> Also make it bigger <br>I was messing around on the size but it felt like I was making it too large and I was not digging it. <br>Also thanks for the advice!<br><br>Anyone know a program, or website, or something that can let me mess with light interacting on random objects?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking health </br></br>  <br>You're just as bad as footfags.</br>  <br>I'm sorry... I'm really bad at explaining stuff, especially since English isn't my mother tongue.<br><br>I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but personally, I don't think shading with only a darker version of the base color doesn't look too good in most cases. If you look at the shadows on your skin in real life, you can see it's more like the base color mixed with nuances of gray, blue and purple (more or less depending on the lightning source)<br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br>  <br>T-thanks?<br><br><br> Hope this means we get some chubby lolis later. <br>Still working on Bunny, im very slow since im multi-tasking.

Otherwise I don't know what you mean. <br><br>It's alright. I like flatcolors, I like the simplicity.<br><br>(I'm both <br>and  by the way, in case I got you confused)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It was not meant to be rim light <br>No that is rim lighting.</br></br>  <br> is something that I've colored before, for an example of what I was talking about. <br><br>In your image, did you achieve the results on the right by using the shading colors on a multiply layer? I just wasn't sure what you meant right at the end of the image. Also, how would you deal with a gradual darkening when shading? Use darker versions of the shading colors and blending, or just another color altogether?</br></br></br>  Requesting the three Gungnir users from Symphogear Hibiki Tachibana, Kanade Amou and Maria Cadenzavna Eve playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with Hibiki using Rock, Kanade using Scissors and Maria using Paper.  <br><br>Can I please request Slaine from Aldnoah Zero (right) trying to pose like his 2000AD namesake (left) but left looking like a hopeless weedy manlet in clothes and gear far too big for him?</br></br>  <br> Still working on Bunny, im very slow since im multi-tasking.

Together, solo/staight, or like /u/ whatever is okay.  <br>The shading in the example pic isn't half bad, though I personally don't like when people shade white skin like that (looks a little like sunburn to me)<br><br>Yeah I did that with multiply. I usually shade on the same layer as the base color (pic related) but before you do that, using multiply and the same shading color for every area of the drawing helps you get a much better feeling for colors.<br><br> Also, how would you deal with a gradual darkening when shading? Use darker versions of the shading colors and blending, or just another color altogether? <br><br>I'd do the former to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting pic related with a healthy patchouli knowledge, she's so fat she can't be loved.  <br>It's a good thing the threads are separate, you think the regular drawthreads are bad? The weekend ones are nothing but cancer.</br>  Requesting ntr  <br>Requesting a trash can with this post sticking out of it.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot. An anon before told me to not be afraid of using dark colors, and the skin, hair, and scales were all in the reddish orangish region, so I thought that the shading might look good if it were a bit orange. I actually also shade on the same layer as the base, since I find it makes blending the shade with the skin look more gradual rather than having defined spots of starting and stopping. <br><br>Anyway, thanks a lot for you help, anon. I'll be sure to try this way out the next time I'm coloring.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that Muse?</br>  <br>Those weekend threads are very angry. Its like 90% shit posting. I like these threads.

If Lerche is going to adapt like 20 chapters of the manga that leaves at least 15 chapters away and if the BD-DVD sales goes well we can think about a second season I guess.  We can all agree Zombie and Fish are worst.  <br>No fish is second best</br>  <br>Considering how well the series is doing I'd say a second season is basically guaranteed.</br>  <br>Murderfish will continue to be worse girl unless something in the newer chapters makes her somehow redeemable.</br>  <br>lets not get cocky</br>  <br>I checked a poll on Nico page and they said Monster Musume is like an Idol franchise.</br>  <br>I love how the print ads for the anime said <br><br>"They said it was a niche! They said it was a minor hit" They said it was only for maniacs! Well, we've sold over a million GNs and now an anime version is confirmed!"<br><br><br>Why? Seriously, Her low-grade insanity aside (they all have it basically), I like her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating on Zombina </br>  <br>Only way she'd redeem herself is if she dies saving the rest of them.</br>  REMINDER<br>8<br>DAYS UNTIL THE FULL MOON.<br>Protect you homes and yourself.

If he studio doesn't make an S2 or explode this on OVA's and stuff to sell is because they are retarded.</br>  <br><br>Well, you say she is the SUUperior Waifu</br></br>  <br>Listen here you little spic.</br>  <br>Suu?</br>  <br>how are the bd sales?</br>  <br> crab man's panic goes into overtime when they ask him for a second season </br>  <br>Not me, I find that kind of attitude childish.</br>  <br>I just want to make love to giant Suu.</br>  <br>Non-existent until September.</br>  I'm the only one who can't stop looking at this image?

It'd just be copy/paste.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>all frames in that part of the OP are a miracle of the universe</br></br>  <br> Lying about reading something <br> Being this retarded secondary <br><br>Stop trying to fit here faggot, if you really read the manga you would know how Darling avoids death every time. <br><br>Now fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except suu has no internal organs or anything and is amorphous</br>  <br> 11 females <br> Miia, Cerea, Papi, Suu, Mero, Rachnee, Smith, Tio, Zombina, Manako, Doppel. <br> no Lala <br>my smile and optimism: gone</br></br></br></br>  <br> do you really think i was being genuine with my question; did the lack of punctuation and non-sequitur writing style not tip you off<br>You have my condolences. </br> </br>  <br>I think he knows that Darling avoids death every time, yeah.<br>I just think maybe we should see that in a chapter.<br>We know he survived having 3 horny girls in his house once. Let's see him do it again with 7.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it's the same retard calling everyone a secondary if something upsets him</br>  <br> not able to make a decent argument <br> I-I was pretending! <br><br>C´mon retard, can you be more pathetic?</br></br></br></br>  Would Rachnera get upset / give you a weird look for squashing a household spider?  <br>No because she's not a spider</br>  <br>Nigger, the answer is simple.<br><br>  He survives thanks to Lala, who was actually stalking him all the time. That was explained long ago but animeonlyfags doesn't know that and instead of reading the manga they just come here and throw retarded questions. </br></br></br>  Daily reminder that you cannot come up with possible scenarios that deviate an inch from the source material, just for the sake of some interesting point/talk/discussion/fun/possibili<wbr>ty/etc without being called secondary, this is serious business.</wbr>  <br><br>Read the OP retards, you're not allowed here.</br></br>  <br>She'd probably kill it first, spiders can be pretty territorial.</br>  <br>Spiders regularly eat other spiders. They have little care for each other even when it could be a potential mate.</br>  <br> Catches a spider in her web. <br> Awkward face. </br></br>  <br>well, she gets kinda touchy about how her looks scare humans, and killing a fucking spider for no good reason might be a little upseting for reminding her of that fact.</br>  Give me your best images of Tio  <br>her limbs are far too skinny</br>  <br>Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her.<br><br>I don't think we've seen a full moon since the first one, but assuming things have been going on long enough for a second to have happened, it's probably safe to go with 'everybody goes to bed early that night'.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask Hound for that, but since he becomes a boring faggot I think he's not able to do that anymore.</br>  <br> Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her. <br><br>It's retarded Lalafag headcanon</br></br></br>  <br>You too have my pity anon for not being able to diffrentiate the genuine from the facetious.</br>  <br>Lala was a little tsun about that, you can notice the reaction and how she blushes when she said that.</br>    <br>I almost feel like you made that yourself.<br>Just chill, man.<br>If a question is easy to answer, it's easy to answer.<br>If it's complicated, yes, you can tell somebody to read the manga to find out, because it'd take too long to explain.<br>I think the main rule to have is to <br> JUST<br> TAKE IT EASY. </br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather get sweaty all over and let Suu do as she pleases.</br>  <br>anon the manga already went over the issue<br>papi has no problem eating poultry, <br>mero has no problem eating fish<br>they simply do not see these things any more similar than a human a rat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or carryover headcanon from the orginal comics</br>  <br>try reading the mang<br>a before posting</br></br>  <br/>  Is Lala purple or that tint is used just to convey she's really pale?  <br>Not the same anon but someone explain that pretty well the last thread.<br><br>The deal with secondaries is how they come to these threads and start asking things they can easily get from reading the manga, even in one day you can rush all the 34 chapters translated but they don't do that, instead of that they go full rampage and start a chain of shitpost every single time or even create new threads talking shit about MonMusume because they get BTFO from here. <br><br>The hate against secondaries is very justified, try to check Jitsu or GATE threads as a good example of what I'm talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Seems pretty clear she's not keeping him alive from where I sit. Or did you think he was saying that her NOT saving him is retarded lalafag headcanon?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Congratulations, you're retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but in those cases you can justify it because they're food. In the other situation you're killing it because you're grossed out. Hence why she would feel weird about it because she shares similar traits. But most likely it's a non issue, but it's fun to speculate I guess</br>  <br>This fucking guy.</br>  <br><br>The original post quoted the passage saying Lala doesn't help him, followed by saying that it's retarded Lalafag headcannon</br></br>    <br>Okay, so you misunderstood him. To me, at least, it seems pretty clear he was saying 'Lala saves his every time' is retarded lalafag headcanon.</br>  <br>I see.<br>So it's not about people willingly curiously coming in, actually trying to learn more about the series.<br>They're just trying to be annoying.<br>Is that right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh wow thats cute mang</br>  <br> retarded lalafag headcanon <br>You say it like there's more than one Lalafag claiming that.</br></br>  <br> best girl hugs trash can.jpg </br>  <br>People who comes here for the adaptation are welcome here but if they act like retards and start all the shitpost they obviously get their asses kicked from here. <br><br>There is some people who ask themselves "oh this comes from a manga? I should read it" doing that those guys can comes here and talk with the old mangafags in these threads normally, but there is always like 3 or 5 retards spreading shit all over the place.</br></br></br>  <br>Do not bully the cry baby.</br>  Let go of the hate. Love monster girls. Thank the almighty Crabman  <br> The hate against secondaries is very justified <br>its not, you're just trying to stir up drama.</br></br>    Ok<br>It seems like the Anime will be two chapters an episode and at 12 episodes it will cover every chapter up till Lala comes into the house hold. The snake shedding chapter is chapter 7 and episode 3 ended at chapter 6 (so don't know why people think it was skipped) should be the first half of the next episode. Also don't see a reason to believe that they will skip Polt yet.</br>  <br>The fish was always worst girl.</br>  <br>polt and shedding will be skipped<br>you can bet your ass on it</br></br>  <br>Darling stronk.</br>  <br>I think he's saying in so much as dealing with only the new people who AREN'T in it just to enjoy the series, but for some other, more annoying reason.</br>  <br>Fuck you crabman, I did this yesterday and no monstergirls appeared</br>  <br>Try again today Padawan</br>  <br>Except the vast majority of the shitposting is coming from the samefag that starts every thread and starts shitting himself about "FAGGOT SECONDARY NORMIE FAGGOTS" whenever someone disagrees with him.</br>  <br>Hail Smith</br>  <br>We know it's skipped already, just look at the preview and the story section on their website. No mention of it</br>  <br>*Sumissu</br>  <br>The snake shedding episode segways into the intro of Suu episode (chapters 7 and 8).<br>Seems like it would be pointless to skip it and it is the next chapter after the full moon chapter. So far it looks like 24 chapters of the manga will be covered.</br></br>  Anime original scene incoming to fill in where the shedding should have been. At least it involves Miia  <br>A rose by any other name.</br>  <br>ARIGATOU CRABMAN!<br> pls, crabman, this would be my first time </br></br>  <br> Darling's face <br><br>She's having a dream.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Mero is just delusional. She can claim insanity.<br><br>Miia is a legitimately shitty character.</br></br></br>  <br>Did the blurred corners tip you off?<br>If it's not a dream, I don't know what the fuck.</br></br>  <br> polt skipped <br>pls no<br>why?</br></br></br>  <br>you damn well know why anon</br>  <br>To be fair, she hasn't had a lot of good experiences dealing with Rachnee.<br>She ties her up all the time.<br>At one point she even tied up her mom, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Hand-holding too lewd for TV.</br>  <br>skimmed the chapter, there wasnt really anything objectionable</br>  <br> lock up Suu <br>In what? Unless it's super sturdy and airtight, she could just ooze out of it.</br></br>  <br> At one point she even tied up her mom, too <br>Rightfully so.</br></br>  The Tio scenes where she's trying to be a girly-girl despite being &gt;7 feet tall are hilarious<br><br>Why isn't there more of this</br></br>  <br>Indeed, rightfully so.<br>But looking at it from Miia's perspective, I can see that she just doesn't enjoy having her as a roommate.<br>Being an extra contestant for Darling might as well be an extra with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I want to climb her.</br>  <br>Miia most likely dreams about getting her pussy slammed by Darling<br><br>Best girl</br></br></br>  <br><br> that top-left screen-shot <br><br>I don't remember that in the Manga. What scene is that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime original</br>  <br>Papi and Suu do, even Cerea got on good terms with her. Miia is just a cunt.</br>  <br>It's actually  the series ending still </br>  <br><br><br>I doubt he meant that seriously.<br>That was a joking statement in reference to the fact that it would end the pressure he's under, not indicative of the actual choice he'd make were it an option.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Papi and Suu <br>Simple-minded. They just like she can make rides.<br><br> Cerea <br><br>Doesn't like her, buries those feelings to better serve Master.<br><br>Miia hates her and isn't afraid to say it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop being such a killjoy</br>  <br> Dullahan <br>I'm curious about the variants.</br></br>  <br>Cerea doesn't like Rachnera either</br>  <br>Hmm...<br>I got nothing, you may have a point there.<br>But dammit, Miia is still my waifu.</br></br></br>  The shedding scene is part of the fake director chapter that leads into Rachnea intro (he wanted Mia's shed skin) still think it will be included. Checked out the chapter 4 episode and it looks like it will cover chapter 8 and 9. So the may just be shuffeling some chapters around. Again they seem to be heading towards covering 24 chapters and not padding any single episode to a full episode (just two chapters an episode).   Rachnera sneezes <br> bukkakes all over Cerea </br>   128499194 <br> Anon </br>  <br> being in denial </br>  There's nothing illegal going on in this thread, right?  <br>i thought Mero's hair was completely pink</br>  <br>The only logical choice</br>  <br>Fuck the police</br>    <br>But what about Lala?</br>  <br>Only if the police is Smith</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Papi and Suu might be simple-minded, but their affection is genuine. Miia hates everyone except Darling because she needs his dick only to herself.<br><br><br>She didn't before Rachnera forced her to be honest to her feelings. Then she said she could count on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't start.</br>  <br><br> Centaur <br><br>Wait, we got one?<br>Haven't watched the episode yet, but I've been in every Monmusu Thread this week since and I haven't seen it posted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wins after Darling dies.</br>  <br>Dolphin has been hugged, chief.</br>  <br>d-does that mean  yandere potential? </br>  <br><br>IT'S GONNA' GET ROCKY</br></br>  <br> tfw no Lala in wedding dress </br>  <br>IN DA RAIN OR IN DA SNOW</br>  <br>N YES. </br>    <br><br>S2 OP<br><br> In 2 years </br></br></br></br>  <br> Miia hates everyone except Darling because she needs his dick only to herself. <br><br>I think she is kind of friends with Centorea</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with <br><br><br>but at the end of the day, it's Darling she wants. Nothing wrong with honesty.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> S2 OP <br> Starts pretty much the same as S1 except now with Lala <br> She's wearing a "what the fuck am I doing here" expression the whole time </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> transparent </br>  Here's something to consider: Mero gets a lot of shit for her fantasies, but Cerea is also guilty of this to a lesser extent. She wants to serve a master in a traditional sense, but she also has warped it into some fiction to rival the likes of ancient lore (and then there was that "running away together" thing when Lala first scared them). Or I could be wrong, I just thought I'd bring that up for debate.  <br><br> believing chuuni delusions </br></br>  <br>S-Shut up.</br>  <br><br>We're not even sure she CAN "mate".<br><br> She sure as Hell can try though. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Post it.</br></br>  <br>"Monster, monster, mon mon mon monster, now with Lala!</br>  <br>Miia seems to find her useful on some occasions, like when Rachnera showed up. I don't see much more beyond that, she's still a rival in her eyes.<br><br><br>They all want him, but she's the only one who's always thinking about the others as enemies. And in that image she was anything but honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Monmusu aren't the animals they resemble. They are women with some physical-parts of their body that happen to resemble animals.<br><br>We've repeatedly seen that no Monmusu has any real emotional connection to any of the animals they resemble.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Starts pretty much the same as S1 <br> not having a whole new OP that includes new monstergirl </br></br>  <br>As was said in the last chapter,  Mero is a princess. She says that “It’s just a small country among many”, but nonetheless, her mother, the queen has ordered her home, saying there are threats against her. Cerea bends a knee and apologies for any and all rudeness to her majesty, saying she always knew she was royalty. Papi and Suu are both wrecked at the idea of her leaving, until Rachnee points out “It’s just a visit, right? She’ll come back soon.” They all decide to go to the hotel her mother is staying at, which looks like a castle. After narrowly avoiding being drowned (it’s a hotel for sea creatures, after all), they all go to the beach (swimsuit issue, even Suu gets a wet suit so she can play in the ocean, although her head soaks up water and makes her tits pop out.) As Mero is told by her mother she must return for good, Miia and Cerea get orgasmic massages from the Eel people, while Rachnee is fishing with her thread, wondering why she’s only getting rays. Suddenly, an army of crabs boil out of the ocean, swarming the kitchen and chewing up all the fish (right as all the customers come for dinner, since the beach is closed). The fish-headed chefs panic, and Darling comes to the rescue, salvaging what he can, and ordering Rachnee to catch all the arys she can (“It’s so rare of you to ask me for a favour…”, she says). Using the remaining fish and vegetables, as well as rays Rachnee catches, he manages to feed an entire hotel’s worth of super upscale customers. When they look for Mero, it’s discovered that she was kidnapped by “0” <br><br><br>She's honest in her desire to get what she wants. Good for her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> also one of the best girls <br> one of <br>I believe you're mistaken.</br></br></br>  <br>Heil Schmidt!</br>  <br>Girls will be girls in this series, I think. They all like their crazy fantasies, Mero just has a taste for tragedies and Cerea has a high regard for tradition, with a touch of a rebellious side.</br>  <br>Please no, we don't need any more girls in his harem. Lala still doesn't really exist</br>  <br>There's a chance she wasn't being a chuuni there. We can't forget she's a dullahan, despite her personality.</br>  <br> zombie <br> worst <br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in MON, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Orc Gangs, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top commando in the entire Monster Ops: Neutralization. You are nothing to me but just another target.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of MON and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> In the other situation you're killing it because you're grossed out. <br><br>You're killing it because it's a invasive species with a bite that is actually considerably hazardous to humans, same as a wasp or a bee in the house.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Something I've been confused about, but when exactly did Suu start speaking? I know she got giant and got smart there, and then ate some poison shrooms and started talking then. Did she just keep talking, because I don't remember there ever being that moment of "oh hey, Suu's talking".</br>  <br><br> It seems like the Anime will be two chapters an episode and at 12 episodes it will cover every chapter up till Lala comes into the house hold. <br><br>Not necessarily. There are likely several chapters that won't be able to be well-compressed into 11 minutes of footage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the chapter Kurusu got sick.</br>  <br>Need a hug?</br>  <br> Good for her <br>Is it? It seems to me that she'll have to learn how to share Darling before harem end happens, so being that "honest" won't help much.</br></br>  <br>At least we know this chapter will get animated</br>  <br><br> Miia's shitty for being glad that the woman who has repeatedly tried to rape the man she loves behind her back may be leaving. <br><br>Yeah, she's a real cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Freeze her.<br><br>Like in The Blob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There would be a fucking riot if they tried to skip it.</br>  <br>She seems to be picking up more and more speech/intelligence as the series continues. in Chapter 34 she was down-right devious.<br><br><br>Or poison everyone else. She is always "trying to learn to cook".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean the girls that's not in his harem, faggot.</br>  <br>She's been contained by a trash bag before.</br>  <br>she and lala need to meet</br>  <br> Report and ignore secondaries shitposters, crossboarders, retards from other threads <br> Keep the thread clean <br>oh the irony</br></br></br>  <br><br> Miia most likely dreams about getting her pussy slammed by Darling <br><br>It's not even "most likely" anymore. It's confirmed.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/LRr43VhQIfg?t=2m18<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't Miia poisoning her rivals like her mom did?  <br><br>They're Kurusu and his dames (and Lala)<br>Yes Kurusu and his dames (and Lala)<br>One's just called Darling, the others have names (the other one's literally who)</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miia at S+ <br> Doppler at E, beneath Mero and Draco <br>I'm a miiafag myself, but this is a pretty biased chart.</br></br></br>  <br> repeatedly tried to rape <br>Considering Miia herself has been doing exactly that for the longest time, you'd expect her to be a little more empathetic.</br></br>  <br> Doppel <br> E <br> not liking eldritch horrors </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that'll work a second time. She learns too quick.</br>  <br><br> Papi and Suu do, even Cerea got on good terms with her. Miia is just a cunt. <br><br>Papi and Suu are too dumb to care.<br>Cera legitimately resents her but keeps that quiet because she wants there to be peace in their household for the sake of her Master.<br><br>Miia doesn't like Rach and is actually willing to be honest about it.<br><br>Nigger did you not read Chapter 16?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder New Girl is coming next month<br><br> SCYLLA JOINS THE HAREM <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SvN<wbr>XPOdBu6c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This should mean she will team up with Lala consider<br>Miia+Mero<br>Cerea+Rachnera<br>Papi+Suu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love Miia and don't give a shit about doppel or the minor characters in general really.

At least make it 2015/07/23 you idiot  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  I'm staying in this thread until it dies  Glorious final form Yukino is inevitable, it will just be a matter of time.  <br>You mean objectively best girl.</br>   nobody would like a copy pasta.   Remember to keep hydrated, brothers.<br><br>いろはす～</br></br>   no one killing that fucking cunt <br>What happened?</br>  <br>Yukino is best girl. BEST GIRL.</br>  <br>Reminder that Yukino Yukinoshita is objectively best girl.</br>  <br>Threads are way too slow.<br>So I'm done with the cuntkilling, now I just post Irohasu and TL Iroha stuff when they show up.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Coca Cola shill</br>  <br>Reminder that you're objectively wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1. Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pan-san girl a best.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit. Yukinofags are literally Cuckinofags.</br></br>  <br> yui <br>  - even 8man called her a slut <br>  - penguins and fish </br></br></br>  <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>This one is backwards, she was cold towards Yui for placing value on losing her virginity early.</br></br>  <br><br><br>nice samefag</br></br></br>  <br>hey cunt killer, I think you're too hard on the cunt. I had a dream where it was revealed the true nature of the hayato and indeed he is a more miserable individual than anyone in the oregairuverse.<br>probably the one that needs the most love and sympathy of anyone, especially of someone that is his mental equal AKA 8man and not some retard like Tobe or idealizer like Yumiko</br></br>  <br>Yes, someone sweet like Iroha would be perfect for him.</br>  <br>You mean moeblob Yukino.</br>  <br>I think you mean Yui, she is the Y girl after all</br>  <br>Indeed, Iroha would have definitely been a great support for Hayama. He should've said "fuck you" to his group and accept her confession ensuring that he would at least live his own life for a bit. Aside from the issue that he would surely get NTR'd by 8man he would've at least been happy. Funny thing though, if he had to balls to really be himself he wouldn't need Iroha, or anyone for that manner.</br>  <br>why yukino has bulge</br>  <br>Too bad moreblob Yukino is dying soon, Hayama was cucked again by 8man</br>  Brothers?<br><br> I have not forgotten you my brethren. Ch. 2 tl when? </br></br>  <br>Extremely puffy vulva.</br>  <br>Too bad she doesn't love him  romantically . And Miura recently is just trying too hard it might be backfired.</br>  <br> she doesn't love him romantically <br>so she likes him platonically as friends? I didn't know their relationship was that sexual already</br></br>  <br>Haven't been in these threads lately, but I drop by every now and then.<br><br> http://imgur.com/a/VuMzL </br></br></br>  <br>What? There's nothing sexual about it. You said it yourself it's platonic.</br>  When will we see cookie man?  <br>It's just a small crush.<br> Like Yui or Yukino toward 8man </br></br>  <br>I actually finally figured out who the cookieman really is. It took a while be here it is.</br>  <br> Yui <br> Least slutty <br>naaaaah</br></br></br>  <br>I'm Hayama?</br>  <br>You are? Well I'm sorry to say this but that means I'm here to kill you.<br><br>Don't resist, I'll try to make it as quick as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe it.<br>I always knew I was Zaimokuza.</br></br>  <br>Me?</br>  <br>I didn't know Yui liked homeless NEETs with drug problems</br>    <br>I remember you brother. Thanks again for sakicolor.</br>  alone-end when?    <br>She should fuck 8man in front of Yukino<br>I'm sure she wouldn't mind, Yukino only likes him platonically after all<br>Haruno should also say how 8man prefers her over Yukino and talk about how 8man fucks her, that will make Yukino glad that her sister found someone genuine</br></br></br>  What would happened to your dick if yukino turned yandere?  <br>Adorable. It's too bad I don't take sluts.</br>  <br>She would rely on Haruno or Yui to help her do something about it.</br>  <br>A yandere? Well it looks like my work isn't done yet. Fear not citizens, this beast's reign of terror ends now! No more innocent lives will be lost, justice will prevail!</br>   Final scene <br> 8man confesses to Yukino <br> "I-I love you too..." <br> Goes in for a kiss <br> Suddenly stops <br> Yui in the backscreen <br> She has a gun pointed at Yukino <br> Yukino has a hole in her chest <br> Dies, a tear goes down her cheek <br> Helpless 8man stares at the scene, astonished <br> "I love you, Hikki..." <br> Scene ends with a BANG and a black screen <br> "15 years later..." <br> Christmas Cake Yui gets out of jail <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck the yandere out of her</br>  <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave <br>DEVILISH</br></br>  <br> Guns <br> Japan <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd watch this</br>  <br>If she forcibly rapes 8man my dick would be 11/10</br>  Context: After Haruno teased 8man about being his girlfriend in front of Orimoto, 8man rejected her description of their relationship and this happened:<br><br> “Aw, you’re no fun.” <br><br> After she said that, Haruno made a pouty, sulky face. I was thinking how I’d like to poke those cheeks of hers, but there was no way I could do that and I shrugged my shoulders instead.  <br><br>How do you think she would have reacted if 8man had poked her cheeks? <br>Would 8man still be a virgin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 15 years for double homicide <br>unrealistic</br></br>  <br>That'd be incredibly autistic of him. Maybe he could pull it off he did it in a playful manner, as in adding a retort along with it. But suddenly poking?<br>extremely autistic.</br></br>  All I want is for 8man and Yukino's cynical banter to escalate into wild sex.<br><br>Is that too much to ask?</br></br>  <br>Would new Yukino even continue to insult him?</br>  Posting best doujin  <br>Not in Japan.</br>  <br> During those 15 years 8man happily lived his life out <br> having survived his near fatal encounter he ends up at an hospital <br> Iroha visits him everyday <br>  due to being in the hospital he couldn't graduate on time <br>  spends his final high school year not as Iroha's senpai but as her equal, though Iroha still calls him Senpai </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but it would be much closer to flirting than before</br>  <br> Is that too much to ask? <br>Yes, because Yukino would just lie there as a dead fish. There would be no "wild "sex".</br></br>  <br>8man has dead fish eyes, and women don't need stamina if the guy is dominant</br>  <br>you're confusing "dominant" for "could have just bought an onahole"</br>  What would happen to your dick if orimoto turns yandere and kills every girl around 8man?  <br>No, THIS is best doujin.</br>  <br> dead fish meme <br>Yukino doesn't have the best stamina but that doesn't mean they can't have wild sex before her stamina runs out. She lasted long enough in the tennis match</br></br>  <br>I don't know what you mean by "wild sex" but she'll definitely leave his back with some scratches.</br>  <br>Best fanart, presented by the 8 himself</br>  Why is Hayama the happiest and the most  genuine  when he interacts with Hikitani-kun?  <br> Yui with fangs <br>Fangs only belong on Komachi, off yourself right now</br></br>  <br> single homicide <br><br>I was reading through some mass-murder serial kill shit from Japan, some of these guys clearly had mental problems and had criminal records with time served.<br>These mother fuckers literally got slapped on the wrist for rape, assault, and attempted murder.<br><br>In Japan Yui would probably get sentenced 2 years, then placed into psychiatry ward and released 6 months after it's deemed she's sane.<br>Then she'd go and kill who ever is on 8man's tip a week after.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the judge had any sense he'd let her off without even that much. Serves those bitches right for touching her Hikki.</br>   8man makes a request to the service club <br> Yui and Yukino watch with hopeful, curious eyes anticipating his request <br> "I...I..." <br> Their eyes widen and become teary at the thought. Could this be the next step to deepening their relationship? Becoming something more genuine? <br> "I want to ask for your help. I need to confess my feelings to Saika." <br> The room becomes cold. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How destroyed would Watari's social media be if he went with that route?</br>  <br>Not too bad, as bullshit endings go it would at least be better than Iroha.</br>  <br>He showed them what he wanted.</br>  <br> Hikitani-kun <br>Triggered. I lost it when Ebina suggested dating and then continued saying Hikitani.<br><br>Hikio is miles better.</br></br></br></br>  who /8-manWizardEnd/ here?  <br><br>The gods have made their will known.</br></br>  <br> 8man <br> WizardEnd <br> implying   Yukino won't screw him once then disappear from his life forever. </br></br></br>  <br>If the judge really wanted to dispense justice he'd sentence 8man to 5yrs in a womans prison for not fucking all these girls throwing themselves at him  or until it has been deemed he is rehabilitated.</br>  MAX Coffee  <br>Yukino already has a monopoly on the MAX COFFEE™.</br>  <br>He's taken.<br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's his main supplier, fueling his addiction.</br>  <br>You can deny it all you want but it's the truth.</br>  <br>She gives him coffee so he can fuck his kouhai with excess energy, huh?<br>Yukino is not that bad after all.</br></br>  <br>The grave of this fucking cunt</br>  <br>3/10 for effort, but the one from the guy who actually bought a can of MAX Coffee and a bottle of I Lohas was actually good.</br>  <br>That's a cute fanfiction.</br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way Yukino would keep buying it.</br>  <br>They need their fanfiction since they know it's the closest thing they'll ever get to tasting victory.</br>    <br>Right?<br>Yukino "The Doll" Yukinoshita actually doing something out over own will.<br>Unbelievable</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno makes my dick so hard</br>  <br>How autistic is she? If she opened it for him with her mouth, 8man would grab and mount her right then and there.</br>  <br>Winning 8man is out of her own will</br>  <br>That was not the time to be cucking Hayama, they needed information from him.</br>  <br>This thread needs more Meguri.</br>  <br> her <br> will </br></br>  <br>Is she a flying mount?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496838 <br>Already confirmed in first episode/volume, anon.</br>  <br>Yukino wants to be genuine with the 8, that's her will<br>I'm not sure you've actually read the LN have you anon</br></br>   these threads are finally dieing <br><br>Good</br></br>  Left or right /a/?  <br>neither</br>  <br>You already know the answer.</br>  <br>This shit again?<br>There is only one answer, as always.</br></br>  <br>The one that's not a slut jumping from one guy to the other.<br> And Cookie Man = 8man so don't meme me </br></br>  <br>who was cookie guy anyway?</br>  Qualidea was pretty bad, I didnt like Psychopath  Iroha  clone at all nor should anyone be trying to defend her character whatsoever.  As a yukinofag myself, I don't know where the rest of the yukinofags are getting their confidence/smugness from. Even spyro, the biggest yukinofag and the "real" primary of the series (since he reads the LNs in their native language), said that a yukino end seems unlikely and that a friendship ends is a lot more plausible after vol. 11.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Her black hair was long and straight, her pale skin seemed to shine, and her delicate limbs were slender and lithe. Her large eyes and alluring lips widened in surprise. <br> The word “godly” fit this girl like a glove. One could also interpret that to mean her beauty could wipe out this earth on a whim. <br><br>Yukiroha is a danger to the universe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Hayama sure is lucky to have a harem even Yukino loves him.</br>  <br>I think they're just having fun.</br>  <br> one guy's opinion means that he's right <br>Yui's own VA said she didn't believe she would win.
