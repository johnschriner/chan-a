Machine.</br>  <br> MP40 <br><br>I knew she was evil.</br></br></br>  <br>Noice.<br><br>This is now a homu thread</br></br></br>  <br><br>You forgot. <br><br>Dunlop Maxfli driver (Red)</br></br></br></br>  homhom  What's your favorite gun in Homura's arsenal?  <br>Her dick.</br>  <br>Her legs</br>  <br><br>Too strong!</br></br>  <br>Better idea can we get a dossier of ideas and concepts she could have learned during the possibly infinite time loops she had to defeat Wal-Mart Nights?<br>I'm sorry but this bitch could have invented the Borg while discovering the Anti-Life Equation while building an Arc Reactor with a Box of Scraps</br></br>  <br>She would have to restart everytime though.</br>  <br> gun <br><br>Anyways, my favorite weapon homu uses is the M249</br></br></br>  <br>She'd still have the knowledge.<br>When you have infinite time you could probably think of a way to make a Black Hole gun with stuff you can buy at an electronics store in a week.</br></br>  <br>to perfect</br>  <br>She was fucking 14.</br>  <br>She didn't have "infinite" time. You can only go through so many loops before you go insane.<br><br>All she would have had to do was lose hope once and it was all over, that is why it was amazing she made it through as many loops as she did.</br></br></br>  <br>Man those cards. Did you kneel to your chosen princess yet?</br>  <br>Wow, I had no idea they did this for anime too. Or is it just for Madoka?</br>  <br>That's the thing. She can turn back time, but she can't change anything. Despite improving her skill to crazy levels, the time lines never really improved, and Madoka's fate only became more heavy. QB explains this in episode 11.</br>  <br> building an Arc Reactor with a Box of Scraps <br>In a CAVE!</br></br>  <br>Of course i kneel to her and post her on every magica thread from start to end! I love her and all her forms. Also that is an impressive super drill</br>  Handsome.  <br>The problem is that Homura is a natural fuckup. Holy shit, does she ever fuck up. In almost every single time line, she manages to do something that requires Madoka to bail her out. At TV series finale, it was Madoka again that cleaned up Homura's mother of all fuck ups. Despite it was her constant time-looping that made Madoka powerful, she was all ready to give up at the very end, almost wasting all of that karmic destiny. It was Madoka (again), that came to learn the truth and made one of the wisest wishes made in that verse and saved the magical girls. In short, no matter what Homura did or how much time she had, she is guaranteed to fuck up because that's her nature. She was just fortunate enough to have dependable Madoka to clean up her mess afterward.</br>  If only she had stolen a fucking nuke to kill that one last witch.<br>Then we could have had a scene where she walks away from the explosion removing her sunglasses, making everything happy forever.</br>  <br>It is a nice super drill.<br><br> that Homu scared of needles <br><br>Also super cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you moron, a nuke wouldn't have worked. That witch was immune to conventional damage. It required magical powers to defeat it. Madoka in the first timeline managed to defeat it and she was at her weakest then.</br>  <br>But a nuke is a magic of science, anon. I'm sure everything would be allright.</br>  <br>all of the other witches could be killed with conventional means, this witch could be as well, it would just require more force.</br>  I want to do science with homu  <br>To be fair it is fairly likely that it took Madoka to go allahu akbar on the witch's ass given how there was no soul gem on sight. If Kyouko's explosion is any indicative it is a suicidal but viable way to get things done.</br>  <br> Then we could have had a scene where she walks away from the explosion removing her sunglasses, making everything happy forever <br><br>Also killing everyone in the process, including herself and Kyouko who would be innocently eating stolen apples a city away. I would rather be dead than being a meguca, so I guess it's still happier.<br><br><br> Madoka in the first timeline managed to defeat it <br><br>We don't know that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nuke <br> not scientific magic </br></br>  <br> do I get my Homu hating license yet <br>The problem is the system of magical girls and how they always end in despair. That's why Madoka had to make a paradox wish that overthrows the whole thing.<br><br><br>There's no proof Walpurgisnacht was ever defeated until the time loop where Madoka one-shots it and turns into Gretchen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Kyouko stole my heart </br>  <br>I know you're joking, but don't you dare say nuclear power is magic again. It's an insult to SCIENCE!</br>  <br>You forgot golf club.</br>  <br><br>Not necessarily defeat, but injure Walpurgis enough for her to turn tail out of the city. Or their fight lasted enough time for the night of the witche's appearance clock away and thus her time there to run out.</br></br>  <br>And bow.</br>  <br>If assuming the bow and arrow power set that Homura got in the tv series is the same as Madoka, then it is more than likely that Madoka simply taunted the witch into using a powerful attack and reflected it back but burnt out her soul gem. The fact that Madoka's corpse was still intact is a testament that she had managed to stop the witch somehow.</br>  <br>Eh, I find the last one to be impossible to happen since the witch would be wrecking the city in the meantime, rendering any attempt to stall for time futile.</br>  Why didn't Homura end the pathetic life of Mami with ultimate fire power? Why all small arms? Because Mami uses toy like muskets?  <br>You say that.<br>But do you know how strong a Black Hole is?<br>I'm pretty sure if Homura learns how to make a black hole gun and then make the black hole vanish she'd change a lot of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to do sexual reproduction with homu</br>  <br>That's some weird roundabout theory you have there. Just accept that you can't win. Witch system a shit, all hail Madoka and Homura for destroying it.</br>  <br>Listed already on the first reply. Impressive<br><br><br> dat Stinger Homu </br></br></br></br>  <br>Angry mini-nuke Homu is funny.</br>  <br>Is Homu a nazi?</br>  Good night everyone.  <br>No, they end in despair because the wish that they made is not what they actually wanted. That's the point, adolescent girls are rarely honest with themselves. They are constantly regretting that they wasted their one wish for something that they didn't actually wanted and now has to spend an eternity of fighting. A depressed magical girl is more likely to make mistakes and cause fuckups. Not to mention upon their death, they are full of regret from it all which causes them to become witches. Madoka did more than cause a paradox, she consoled the girls upon their death, to get them to release all of their pent-up frustration. The universe isn't the one making the magical girls despair, they themselves are.</br>  <br>It listed weapon she used in Rebellion<br>Maybe her usual weapon already busted by then, it's a hundred iteration alright<br><br><br>QB sure know how to make Megucas pissed</br></br></br></br></br>          is homura more american than meridoka?      <br>The weapons she stole in each timeline most likely vanished instead of carrying over, so that she couldn't bring stuff from one timeline to another (other than her consciousness). Otherwise she could just put together a film or something with a previous timeline Madoka to convice her past self in each following timeline to not contract under any circumstances.</br>    <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>Yes, she has big FREEDOM soul</br>  Say it with me /a/<br><br>President Madoka</br></br>  <br>president homu incoming</br>  <br>Or she never thought of that because she's a dumb kid</br>  <br>So, she must break into JSDF arsenal in every timeline?

But you forgot her magic shield that allows her to stop time.</br>    <br>She only does it with Madoka</br>  <br>Yeah, and she also had to set up stuff such as those torpedoes in every single on of them since she had no means to launch them by herself. It then required her to lure Walpurgis into their line of fire, which took the knowledge and experience built over several timelines of where it would first show up and then the weaponry she could use to push it back towards the designated area.

She got rid of Sayaka's memories and her ability to tap her witch powers. It makes sense because what she stole from Madoka was her power as the law of the cycle, so basically magical girls still exist but come time for them to expire they have to answer to Homura now not Madoka anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Homura arranged the world so that soul Gems disintegrate and leave the girls behind alive, so that only she was the eternal devil god and no one joins her in vaginalhala.</br></br>  <br>What if Madoka recovered<br><br>What if Akuma Homura's demon powers were hampered</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on whether she even has a separate magical girl forme now. She technically is no longer a lich since she need not be with her dark orb at all times and can summon it from nowhere when she needs to. Her devil forme was not human sized in the one time we saw it, so it may not be something that she turns into for combat or whatever. And then there's the issue of what use fighting would be now that she is a reality warping devil.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the dark orb is stored in that mark on the back of her hand.<br>We still don't really know what the hell it does though.</br></br>  <br>So where is Homura's soul?</br>  <br>She broke her own soul gem, so who knows. I imagine that like Madokami (who also destroyed her own soul gem after it turned into Super-Gretchen), she's transcended the whole soul gem thing and is just herself now.</br>  Is Homu a Nietzsche?  <br>So wait, can you cock that handgun by simply pushing the thumb part of your palm into the grip?</br>  <br> airsoft </br>  <br>You for got step 8: get disgusted looks at the range</br>  Homu  <br>Kyouko, that's not nice.</br>  <br><br>No. That's a grip safety. It works by preventing the gun from firing if it is not being held.</br></br>  Fluff  I have no MadoHomu fluff. That's not where their relationship goes, generally.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128713033     Best couple best fluff  <br><br> there are people voting for anything other than Mami's mammies </br></br>  <br><br>I think Homu would like putting Kyouko's hair up like Madoka.  Then forcing her homulust on her </br></br>  <br>Who needs fluff anyway?</br>  <br><br> First reply <br><br>Good job, /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what if I want to vote for Kyouko?</br>  <br>Someone has got to vote for her.<br> madoka winning </br></br>  <br>What are the numbers? I can't see them.</br>  <br>15 15 10 4 3 2 1 0 0</br>  <br>I thought Madoka was winning.</br>  <br>Someone voted for mami after I said madoka was winning</br>  <br><br><br>you guys are huge pervs</br></br></br>  <br>Ha!<br><br><br>But I voted just to vote!</br></br></br></br>  <br>N-no<br><br>I'm surprised homu doesn't have more votes.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128716572 <br>But homuhater, that wasn't a stat and it wasn't fun either.</br>  <br> nuke <br> in the middle of a city <br><br>Murrica is at it again, it seems.</br></br></br></br>    <br>lookin a little topheavy there eh applechan?</br>  Mammi's master race.  Check IMFDB.  <br>Huh?</br>      Do people still call her Homerun here? I remember when that used to be a thing instead of Homu  <br>Just barely.</br>  <br>Not for a while</br>        <br> Homerun <br> Not Homurun </br></br>  <br>Kyouko's kyous will out grow everyones and be the best just you watch.

Until then it's prettymuch just a happy reiterating series of a few conversation topics over and over again</br>  <br> true enough </br>  <br>ostensibly we're talking about a series with so much about it to discuss that we'd never run out and yet here we are at the end of the umpteenth conference on the matter of whose chest is most appealing</br>  <br> Fluff. </br>  <br>K-kyouko's</br>  <br> 14 <br>+12 years of experience without aging<br>Effectively making her 26.</br></br></br>  <br>We should be talking about whos Mahou shoujo outfit is best instead</br>  <br>The beautiful Sayaka-chan is number one in my heart.</br>  <br>Obviously Sayaka-chan.</br>  <br>Hers is one of the best. I can't decide between mamis, sayakas or kyokos.</br>  <br>by a mile. She at least got the outfit fit for a hero</br>  <br><br>A bit of pixellation on the image there. Perhaps waifu2x could do a better upscale?<br><br>http://waifu2x.udp.jp/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sayaka a poop</br>  <br>No, Sayaka a best.</br>  <br>Sayaka's cape is the best feature.<br><br><br>This image is ridiculous.Sayaka can just heal herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 sayaka failed because IncrediblesNoCapes.gif</br>  <br>Apparently it references the powerlevel charts released after the movies, where Sayaka's the weakest one. Poor Sayaka-chan.</br>  <br>well she was clearly the weakest even from the series. Mami, despite her early death, was clearly no joke and could have killed Homura</br>  <br>Suddenly feeling nostalgic, I loved that joke.<br><br><br>Sayaka is the speed and power type but the level in her skilll is low but she has a better defense system and faster recovery.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair she was a beginner around veterans.</br>  <br>Sayaka wasn't the power type, that was Kyoko, and she wasn't exactly out speeding Kyoko either.<br><br>Sayaka was the paladin, unfortunately, that is not the role to take in this series.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they're actually both the same (being close-combat types as well) only that Kyouko has better skills and greater power than Sayaka but has a low defense.</br>  is homu the widest magica?  <br>Agreed. I have sympathy for her, but I can't believe how many people swoon over a character like that.</br>  <br>was easilly the most relatable for me</br>    In the movie when Mami swings in upside down to grab Madoka for the Homulilly fight she totally gropes her boobs. No wonder Homura hated her.  <br>was sayaka old homuhater?</br>   implying rebellion is canon     <br>As watching Homu's older loops in TV series, yes. Sayak bullied popr moemura. Sayak's bullying was why she even started to steal guns and use them.</br>  <br>Is Mami's skirt revolting against the gravity?</br>  <br><br>Impressive level of samefagging, OP.</br></br>  <br><br>magical girl skirts do so they can protect the girl's decency.</br></br>  <br>Everyone's skirt seems to magically cover everything. Except Sayaka, because she's a baka with an uneven skirt or something.</br>  I don't understand how people don't get Rebellion. It's like they have no concept of how much suffering Homura went through for her friend, and how much Madoka cared for her. They also fail to understand how much Madoka sacrificed, and how much she didn't want to have to make that sacrifice. They also don't understand that Madoka's wish was fundamentally flawed, and without Homura to fix things, they would have regressed back to the way things were. People also don't understand that Rebellion was ultimately a fulfillment of Homura's original wish.<br><br>Madoka goddess still exists, as does now Madoka human. They are linked, as was shown in the final shots, but Homura has the power to keep them apart for the most part. All she did was split Madoka into two being again. In a way, you could say that she undid the massive amounts of karmic destiny that she gave Madoka in the series by removing Madoka's god-self from her body and mind. So Madoka's wish is completely maintained, nothing changed there. Ask yourself, had she not done what she did, what would have happened? The Incubators, using their new technique, would have started creating witches again, destroying the sacrifice that Madoka made. Homura has stopped the Incubators from interfering, which was a major problem to begin with. And you will recall that girl Madoka said in the movie that she could never bear to be apart from everyone, so Homura was recently reminded of just how great Madoka's sacrifice was, and she could not allow such a sacrifice to possibly go to waste at the hands of the evil Kyubey. Oh, and now she gets to spend eternity with Madoka. So that's a plus for her.<br><br>That should clear some things up for some of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Asymmetry is cool.</br>  <br>Do you think Kyouko would ever sneak a peek up Sayaka's skirt when they were jumping around the city as magical girls?</br>  <br><br>It is the canon ending of the series and I suggest you deal with that.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't even need to peek it up since Sayaka deliberately exhibit it to everyone.</br>  <br>She was moving in a pendulum-like trajectory, so it makes sense for the wind to push her skirt against her legs and defy gravity this way.</br>  The final battle.  <br>I would buy this hoodie for my girlfriend.<br>Except that I don't leave the house any more except to go to work and have stopped talking to women.</br></br>  <br>I would watch this.<br>And buy the bd.</br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>She probably only let's Kyouko into that spot below that has a view up her skirt.<br>I mean, it happens in official art, so it must canon.</br></br>  <br>Trips for true understanding.<br><br>Someone really paid attention.</br></br></br>  now you know why homu is the best. simply the best  <br>Because other best girl loves her.</br>  Homu? more like  Akemi Homura <br> get it? </br>  <br>that is completely correct</br>  <br>Madoka is the best being bland.</br>  <br>Madoka is the magical girl Picasso.</br>  <br>She draws like a 12 year old.<br>Madoka's just not interesting.<br>She should've been a ninja or something.</br></br></br>  <br>So she draws two years below level?</br>  <br>She has nuke arrows and the universe in her dress. She fights for the good of all at her own cost. She has a fantastic character arc beaten only by Homura's. She's frilly.<br><br>She's just great.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't a genius though, and she didn't want to wait a thousand years to figure that shit out, she wanted a quick solution</br>  <br>Draw us a picture anon.

Just open up episode 10 and check if you want to see the exact wording.</br>    <br>Not how it goes at all, Madoka jumps away and then it cuts to her dead and Homura crying over her body.</br>    <br>I'm confusing that part with another timeline then. Look it up for your damn self, holy shit.</br>  <br>Honestly, Madoka beating it or at least driving it away is the only explanation why the surrounding area was destroyed but Madoka's corpse was still intact. If she had failed, then her body would've been torn to shreds by Walpurgis Night afterward.</br>  <br>Walpurgis isn't mentioned as being defeated in timelines 1, 2, or 3.</br>  <br>Perhaps she destroyed her soul gem against it and her body wasn't caught in the explosion?</br>  <br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Timelin<wbr>e#Timeline_1:_Ordinary_Human_Homura<wbr><br><br>posting it again because someone didn't bother to click it. Maybe they take walpurgis' defeat as implied in T1, but in T2 and arguably T3 it happens explicitly</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Walpurgis doesn't seem like the type to focus on one person like that, it's kind of a rampager. It only directly attacked Homura once she had thrown half the explosives in Japan at it.</br>  <br><br>I don't see it ever mentioned that it died. Also, it depends on which subs you're watching...</br></br>  <br>I can see what the wiki says, but I have the episode open right here man, its defeat is not mentioned at all in timelines 1, 2, or 3. The conversations all focus on who's currently dead or dying.</br>  <br>Why do all the Madoka subs fucking suck? Every single one of them I notice errors in translation, and I'm a fucking pleb at Japanese.</br>    <br>It may have been like this with first timeline Mami, too.</br>  <br>And Walpurgis Night would still be rampaging about had she failed. Without the soul gem, her body is just a normal frail school girl body, which would've been ripped to shreds by Walpurgis Night and her familiars afterward. First timeline Madoka might theoretically be the weakest without the karmic destiny, but as she tutored under Mami exclusively, she had the most experience and amassed a sizable collection of Grief Seeds since she didn't have to share it with Homura yet. If assuming she had her damage reflector ability, it would explain why her body was fine despite being in the epicenter of the witch's rampage.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xaW<wbr>x6ZiE6CA</wbr>  [ ]<br> Praise Homu .</br></br>  <br>Is it about to get wide in here?</br>  <br>The wiki is made by fans m8.</br>  <br>But you're making a pretty big assumption that absolutely everything in the area is going to be ripped apart to that small of a level. Walpurgis throws skyscrapers around, it doesn't run them through a blender.</br>  <br><br>Madoka's not dying - she's turning into a witch as a result from using up so much energy, so Homura has to put a cap in her.<br><br>I think it's the final run just before the one the show shows - Madoka makes Homu promise madoka that she'll stop Madoka from becoming a magical girl, and then Homu makes her eat a bullet cake before turning the gun on herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I sure hope so.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>A Miyaka Mami might just be the best Mami.</br>  <br>Look at the area around Madoka's corpse. Everything was devastated. Since her corpse wasn't buried/hidden under any sort of rubble, it had no protection against the witch. Hell, her clothes was barely damaged and she didn't have a soul gem to keep it intact.</br>    <br><br><br>if you'd rather believe that she just inexplicably floated off for no reason then fine by me I guess. The prevailing reason to think she was defeated is simply that she's gone.</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't turn Yuno into cheese.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>City destroyed, magical girls be sucked into it, and it moves on.</br>  <br>It floated off for the same reason it floated in. What was it doing spinning around in the ocean in the first place? It's a insanely laughing carnival witch, it doesn't have to explain shit. There's no reason to assume it's going to stay in Mitakihara forever once it arrives.</br>    <br> just inexplicably floated off for no reason <br>With the enemy defeated, wlbertschight had better things to do.</br></br>  <br><br>alright, nice theory kiddos</br></br>  <br>The juicy apple in this story</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Hey you, welcome back.</br>  <br>Welcome back!</br>  <br>Conglomeration-type witch yo.</br>  If I watch Madoka Magica will I  forever be a filthy entry-level casul or is it ok?   <br>If Kyouko in that picture was wearing ear gauges she'd look pretty cute.</br>    <br> mfw miya-chan and mami have the same va </br>  <br> gauges <br>Fucking disgusting.</br></br>  <br>So do Yuno and Nagisa.</br>  <br> a sizable collection of Grief Seeds <br>Eh, Mami was never shown to have surplus soul gems stocked up like this. Not that it would be impossible to do if she hunted every witch to appear in the city however, given how Kyouko, Homura and Sayaka were able to coexist without them starving due to lack of witches to hunt (and Sayaka having turned down two different soul gems). If there was for three (one of them killing a lot of familiars), then surely it wouldn't be out of reach for two.<br><br><br>To putit bluntly, it makes little sense for them to be talking to one another like this if the witch they fought hadn't been disposed of in some way. Wapurgis is in fact shown to target MGs that tried to harm her -- assuming that has also happened with Mami, which has some basis given the fact that Madoka was in her magical girl outfit from the beggining of the scene in which they mourn Mami's death. Not only would they have the breathing room, one would also expect them to be talking about it still be roaming around, rather than their last words speech when they had done their work, albeit at the cost of them having no way to make it out of there alive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H8X<wbr>WRxN8ZsQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>If you watch Madoka you will  enjoy it, probably </br>  <br><br>Hello.

After grinding them let the powder rest for a few minutes before brewing, and drink before 5 to 15 minutes after.</br>  <br>I shall now make my own coffee.</br>  I finished the series and i'm confused about one thing.<br><br>What's up with Madoka's conversation with Mami and Kyoko at the end? It clealry has to take place in a previous timeline given that Mami was dead before Kyoko showed up, but it wouldn't make sense for Madoka to have come up with her God wish in a previous timeline because then everything would have been solved within that timeline. Furthermore she's discussing Magical Girls eventually becoming witches with Mami in a calm manner, with also makes no sense.<br><br>I'm sure i sound retarded but could anyone clear that up for me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is everywhere and anywhere at everytime.</br>  <br>so the conversation isn't a flashback but a flash foward? This is after she's already assumed God state like when she's talking to Sayaka?<br><br>They really seem like they're talking about a wish she's eventually going to make though, not one she's made. And it doesn't help that this is scene is right before Madoka's transformation scene.</br></br></br>  <br>Sayaka a qt.</br>  <br>Kyouko a qt.</br>  <br>Good luck.</br>  <br><br>Both qt's.</br></br>  <br>She's still a 14 year old girl, and I'll ignore the factor of despair and losing hope acting as their own time limits while explaining this.<br>Even if you made a monkey immortal, it wouldn't be able to ever wrap its head around the concept of something like a Black Hole. <br>But you're saying that as a 14-year-old girl, Homura should be able to invent something like a black hole gun that also can take away the black hole after it fires it? As far as we know something like that isn't even possible at all.</br></br></br>  <br> madoka is in my room right now <br> &gt;madoka is in my bed right now </br></br>  <br>Madoka is inside of you right now.</br>  <br> &gt;in my bed <br><br>Better get her out.<br><br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw <br>Now all I need is to make a wish so I can be inside of her.</br></br>  <br>You are the biggest perv.</br>  <br>Homu a qt.</br>  <br>Why do you say that? I just want to be inside madokas heart. Maybe you're the perv here.</br>    <br>Always.</br>    <br>Oh fuck! Always when I least expect it.</br>  Miss me yet?

I really did. But to be perfect honest, you wouldn't know Isla was an android if the show outright didn't tell you. Her bahaviour and her physiology was exactly that of a human's. Far too perfect, considering the ultimate imperfection of her life span.<br><br>Ignoring the jarring plotholes, this show REALLY should have gone through the effort of showing what Isla was, at least to some degree. Didn't feel like an android at all.<br><br>Just wasted potential and good characters in bad shows with awful characterization. I'd watch a spinoff centered around the genki mechanic blonde girl, for instance. She was fun to watch.<br><br>Another thing that really bothered me was the Tsundere coworker. She obviously had feelings for MC and she lost, yet the show didn't even care enough to show us what her reaction was, or how she was going to deal with that. Once Isla once, she jsut got pushed to the side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay fine, this was your 20th, not your 10th.

Or that you've dedicated so much time to anime that you don't cry anymore? Either way, it's pathetic.</br>  <br>This. Kinda makes me wish they do a sequel just to fix those plotholes and develop the setting. However, I'm pretty certain that the writers already conveyed the message that a person should enjoy life while he/she can so I can't see a sequel or a spinoff being developed.</br>  <br>I don't think a sequel would be fitting to the way plastic memories ended.

It does not occur as a natural result because it's NOT REAL. <br>Good god, if we killed everyone who used this buzzword we would have a much better /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> troll <br>Again, you along with everyone else who liked this shit are total newfags.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully it kills you.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mSn<wbr>QXeHqV0Y</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>at least you're not this loser</br></br>  Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl.  1) Ukyou<br>2) Ranma-chan<br>3) Kodachi</br></br>  <br>Ranma is best girl.<br>Ukyou is best boy.<br>Fuck this story for not going best route.</br></br></br>  <br>onnateki Ranma<br>Yoiko<br>Pigtailed girl</br></br></br>  <br>There was only one best route, and what you named wasn't it.</br>  Doesn't get along well with Ranma, so their interactions are just the stock "I hate you but secretly I love you" with no decent progress over the manga's long lifespan.<br>Not a good fighter compared to others.<br>Can't accept criticism well, like how she's always pushing her terrible cooking, meaning she won't change at all.</br></br>  <br>Ranma x Ryoga is best, everyone agreees</br>  Her personallity is literally worse than shit.   shitty cook <br> short hair <br> worst figure </br></br>  1. Shampoo <br>2. Ukyo<br>3. The fact that she can be a royal pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>1) Unreliable tsundere that prefer the "punch first, ask question later" approach even if she's the weakest of the cast<br><br>2) Her sisters are way hotter and better in their own fields<br><br>3) When your so-called fiancee is (litteraly) a better woman than you, you know you suck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay. <br><br>1. built like a stick<br>2. dumb as a brick<br>3. talks like a hick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked her better in Inuyasha</br>  <br><br>I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings and also did a good job at showing how the characters had leveled up in their skills. I think the series would have ended better if the manga had them get married instead of LOL so random, wedding ruined.</br></br>  <br><br>So right.</br></br>  <br> I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings <br>The final arc of a series that ran for almost 10 years and 38 volumes. Too little, too late.</br></br>  <br>The fishing rod of love chapter was great</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but it's not like Takahashi was writing berserk or something. Ranma 1/2 was build around a status quo that was interrupted for comedic effect. In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills, which was good for a payoff when the time came but the majority of the series isn't about building the arc it was about situational comedy.</br></br>  <br> In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills <br>What did Akane, the heroine and main love interest, get?</br></br>  <br>Even Kodachi is better than Akane</br>  <br>she got more useless</br>  <br><br>Sad and true. She never had to fight anyone and really her whole kempo schtick died off along with Dr. Tofu so there really was no purpose in making her a martial artist. Actually, since some arcs depend on her getting kidnapped it would be counter productive.</br></br>  <br>Plus, with Shampoo, she can be really cute.</br>  <br>there was an even better route than that it's ranma x  ranma </br>  <br><br>She's insultingly dense.</br></br>  <br>You are aware she's more intelligent than she acts sometimes, right? If you want to talk insultingly dense, Azusa Shiratori.</br>  <br>!!!! Ranma no BAKAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>I think she acts like a dumb ditz around Ranma cause she wants to be all perfect wife and stuff, when combat happens she suddenly gets serious</br>  <br>Because nips actually preferred a chinese amazon over her.</br>    <br>damnit why does the best girl have to be a boy?</br>  <br>Hard to argue against that.</br>  <br>Sssssh, it's a girl right now</br>  <br>it's unspoken rule of genderbent MC being the best girl</br>  <br>1.)Because Shampoo is love<br>2.)Shampoo is life<br>3.)Any girl named Akane in any series is always shit</br></br></br>  fapping to Ranma never gets old, a true semen demon  <br>Indeed, she is.</br>  <br>Best part is, no risk of pregnancy. Throw some hot water, all the female internals disappear. Throw some cold water, bam, fresh female at the start of her cycle.</br>  <br>She's lucky that she can boil water right.</br>  <br>1.<br>Its impossible to sleep in the same bed with her</br></br>  Ranma is already best girl.  <br>2.<br>She has a bad temper</br></br>  <br>She looks cute with her hair down</br>  <br>Damn straight</br>  <br>And she can kill a man with her cooking</br>    You can only pick one, short hair is delicious.  Always in style  <br>Long hair easily.</br>  <br>Not a bad choice though I think short hair looks good on ranma.</br>  <br>Oh lord, house wife Ranma Chan...</br>  <br>She's mean and is dishonest about her feelings.</br>  <br>Yeah, not nearly enough for my heart or my dick</br>  Would you a magically amorous ranma  My favorite.  up  <br>tomboy<br>short hair<br>tsundere</br></br></br>    <br>Yes</br>  <br>The idea of a house wife Ranma Chan seems oddly adorable.</br>    <br><br>One of the few pairings that can please fujoshi and otaku at the same time.</br></br>  <br>That, and she would look even more adorable with a Kasumi-like ponytail.</br>   One of the few pairings that can please fujoshi and otaku at the same time <br><br>Nope, just fujoshi, its a terrible pairing that never made any sense.</br></br>  <br>Meant to quote <br/></br>  <br><br>I like her fashion sense, at least. Cute 80s outfits.</br></br>  <br>It's the universally agreed best pairing</br>  <br>It is?</br>  Where can I download the english manga in a high resolution format?  <br> Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl. <br>She can't swim.<br>She's a violent maniac.<br>She's cute only when she smiles.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You can pick ONLY one, <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>1. Violent<br>2. Not cute<br>3. Brute tomboy</br></br></br>  Akane gives a bad name to tomboys everywhere.  <br><br>Eh, I'dunno, I liked her  in Street Fighter. </br></br>  <br><br>Stubborn as a mule<br>A little delusional</br></br></br>  People who like Akane have no imagination and only concern themselves with the most vanilla pairing.  <br>They're just slaves to the author's ghastly self-insertion.</br>  <br>I always laughed when he'd abuse P-chan</br>  <br>I thought Kagome from Inuyasha was the self insert?</br>  If you mean the best Akane then sure.  <br>Kagome, Akane, Shinobu. all her self inserts. I think the grandma from Rin-ne is also one.</br>  <br>Shes not<br><br>-Female Ranma <br>-Shampoo</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can think of worse.</br>  <br>At least Lum is actually likable and attractive. That, and she has the excuse of her cooking being alien in origin.</br>  <br>maybe i like being a slave</br>  <br>To be honest, she has all of the traits that people don't like in Akane. Mainly being violent and short-tempered.<br><br>I don't think her cooking being for aliens is much of an excuse either. There's a point where she tries cooking for Ran but Ran ends up having to correct her on even the simplest of tasks.</br></br></br>  <br>trips confirm.</br>  <br>I want to taste Takahashi's cooking to see what it's like.</br>  <br>Not all of Akane's traits. She never accused anyone of rape for starters, plus that ep regarding Ran was more of a goofball scenario/one off rather being a recurring theme run into the ground. Plus, Lum is actually very sweet in general, and the main reason why she gets mad is because of Ataru's assholish behavior. Akane, and to a much bigger extent Naru Narusegawa, can be rude to people that are nice to them on a regular basis and have few likable character traits.</br>  <br>  She never accused anyone of rape for starters <br><br> Fair enough on that. She has more grounds to do so since there are stories in which she nearly is raped.<br><br>  Ran was more of a goofball scenario/one off rather being a recurring theme run into the ground <br><br>It's more illustrating why she's not a very good cook instead of playing it entirely for laughs.<br><br>  Plus, Lum is actually very sweet in general, and the main reason why she gets mad is because of Ataru's assholish behavior. <br><br>Fair enough on this as well, although I suspect she's probably killed people caught in the crossfire.<br><br>On the topic of Ataru though, she seems to have a thing for making him cry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Came in here to post this</br>  <br>Honestly, I doubt it's terrible just because she's used it as a gag a few times.<br><br>Although given that she's made enough money off her work to last her until death, I wonder if she even has to cook for herself these days.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamako is too based to be a self-insert.</br>   people talking shit about Lum <br><br>Lum is an angel, Ataru deserves every shock he gets.</br></br>  <br>Lum's awesome!</br>  <br> few times <br>It was every time, anon. Maybe except for few.</br></br>  Ranma really is one of those cases where the worst girl won.<br><br>I wouldn't even say it's her fault entirely. Her and Ranma are like oil and water. There's no chemistry there, and they never really develop.</br></br>  <br>She cut her hair.</br>  <br>Lum a shit</br>  <br>Fav episode</br>  <br>1.) tsundere done wrong<br>2.) ugly hairstyle<br>3.) shampoo best girl</br></br></br>  I fapped so much to this anime, specially Shampoo.  <br>I don't think I've seen any terrible cooking gags in Rinne yet.</br>      <br>An angel wouldn't try to manipulate someone's feelings.<br><br>But anyway, regardless of the negative things I say, I don't hate Lum. She does really love her darling and he loves her.</br></br></br>    <br>Why is Ranma such a bad influence?</br>  <br>Shampoo's shower scene in Desperately Seeking Shampoo...</br>  <br>Those breasts and the well done animation...</br>  <br>Oh page, we come to meet again<br>And now I'll fap</br></br>  <br>Ryoko a s exy. Would add her into my harem. </br>  <br>Of course you would say that, Ataru.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>She's cute even when she's mad</br>  <br>- She's a annoying tsundere cunt<br>- Shampoo and Ukyo are even better<br>- She's practically a gorilla, ugly, rude and violent.</br></br></br>    <br>Fuck off Ryoko, you're just a jew bitch.</br>  <br>Ryoko =  Shampoo <br>Ayeka =  Kodachi <br>Sasami =  Ukyo <br>Washu =  No smart girls in Ranma 0.5 </br></br></br></br>  <br>But a female gorilla would have no problem with letting the male dominate.</br>  <br>replace Kodachi for Shampoo and we have a deal</br>   would you make your rival cry?   <br>mah nigga, that's a great douijn</br>  <br>Makes me feel shitty whenever I jack off to it...</br>  <br>I feel that way for just about every Ranma doujin.</br>  <br>Nabiki would probably be the closest to smart but she's more about business than SCIENCE.</br>  <br>And would charge you extra for everything you do.</br>  <br>Mostly because Ataru makes her cry often</br>    <br>Of course, this IS Nabiki we're talking about.<br><br>This has me wondering though. Has Rumiko ever created a scientific genius character?</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's more that he admits to having feelings for her when he's distraught like this.</br>  My favorite episode  <br>Technically, Lum is because she does invent stuff occasionally.</br>  <br>Ah yes, the best of the anime original episodes</br>  <br>Why should he want to do that?</br>  <br>Because</br>  <br>Because she's so crazy that she makes Harley Quinn look sane?</br>  <br>I always figured that much of that technology was roughly the space alien equivalent of ready to assemble furniture.</br>  <br>That's true for some bits of tech, but stuff like the doll transmitter, a translator when she forgot how to speak Japanese, and lipstick that make people kiss each other were stuff she made by hand.</br>  Happosai is the best character in this show. It's objective.  Yukino, Yui, or Saika, which of the three main girls has the sexiest daki?  <br>Probably Yui. <br>Yui is best girl after all.</br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!

What did he think teh situation was about  Its been a month since Yahari ended.....why are there still threads  <br>It's pretty early on in the LN so we will see it soon once spyro comes back to life.</br>  <br>I want Haruno to take the 8inches for herself. Not only that, but I also want her to show the girls their sex tape when they get together one time.<br>Their sex tape would be one of the most genuine with the most amount of sexual frustration and sexual debauchery:<br><br>(1/3)<br><br> Haruno begins by giving 8man the most amazing foreplay of his pathetic life. She starts by roughly pushing 8man to the wall of their room and then proceeds to whisper nothing but dirty talk into his ear while gently stroking his hachi through his pants. She progresses to a long session of deep kissing by sucking on his tongue and uses their saliva as lubricant to further indulge in their passion for each other. <br><br> 8man breaks and he wants to be the more dominant of the two, but Haruno only reacts by pushing him to the bed and mischievously states that she will the dominant one in here. <br><br> They continue to kiss each other, but now that Haruno is on top of him, 8man feels the greater stimulus of her boobs pressing against his chest with all her weight on him. With 8man's genuine rod roaring to be released, Haruno unzips his pants and unleash the 8incher in all its glory. <br><br> She gently teases his dick with an impish smile and then kisses the tip while stroking his shaft with both hands. She moves on to using her tongue all over his shaft in a manner analogous to sealing a mail letter. Finally, Haruno deepthroats the 8incher in one go while looking at him the whole time with a naughty expression. 8man, unable to resist Haruno' playfulness, announces that he is about to cum, however, he is only met with Haruno grabbing him by his balls and saying, "not yet, not before I get to feel good with this 8incher inside of me". </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(2/3)<br><br> Haruno then takes her completely soaked panties off and makes 8man sniff them and lick them while she watches his throbbing cock scream for physical contact. She watches 8man’s expression in awe and realizes that he is completely enveloped in the stimulus brought upon by her panties. She teasingly laughs and gets excited to see his cock jumping from the anticipation of physical contact. <br><br> Shortly after, she straddles his dick with her pussy and uses his precum and her own juices as lubricant to comfortably take the 8incher. After making sure that it's lubricated enough, she rides the 8incher while she whispering how big his dick is and how good it feels. Those whispers then turn to gently bites on his ear and quickly proceed to rough hickeys throughout his neck and upper chest. Haruno and 8man orgasm at the same time and they just deeply stare into each other’s eyes without saying a word; they take a moment to enjoy the pleasure of their drug-like induced orgasm. <br><br> After coming back to reality, 8man falls on Haruno’s chest and she praises 8man by telling him how she loves his thick and warm loads. <br><br> 8man gets hard again and finally finds an opportunity to be the dominant one. 8man switches spots with her and gets on top of her. He forcibly grab her by both of her wrists and Haruno's only reply to this turn of events is: "did I finally break you to the point where I actually feel like being the submissive one?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(3/3)<br><br> 8man’s animalistic instincts materialize and he tongue fucks her again while he penetrates deeply inside of her. Haruno’s answer to this new position does not come through words but by body language and body fluids. Her body convulses like never before and she squirts all over the bed making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets. Haruno comes back to her senses, but is unable to make a single coherent sentence. 8man proceeds to shut her gibberish by caressing her slender throat in one hand while grabbing her wet tongue with the other. <br><br> After she stops having her wild orgasms, 8man starts thrusting his dick with slow, long strokes back into her pussy; Haruno comes again in no time due to her sensitivity. 8man stops for a couple of seconds and is quickly ready for another round. However, Haruno tries to get away from 8man by pushing him off and tries to crawl away from him to rest for a bit. <br><br> 8man's swiftly grabs Haruno’s weak calves and roughly pulls her closer to him. He puts Haruno on a rear naked choke while whispering how good it feels inside of her. Haruno is unable to do anything besides biting the bed sheets mix her and 8man’s fluids. 8man continues to fuck her until the both of them orgasm again. <br><br> After their long session, both of them are stare at the ceiling in a trance-like manner and they enjoy the pleasure of their debauchery while breathing heavy. Haruno then rests her head on his shoulder and whispers how much of a monster he was tonight. She jokingly states that he is no longer a monster of logic, but a monster of sex. <br><br> Both of them fall asleep and try to recharge their energy and restore their body fluids for tomorrow's morning sex. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Did anyone save the Haruno fic someone wrote before, where it included her taking a pic with 8man and posting it on her social media  <br><br><br>It is hard to keep my boner contained. Truly, you are aware of the inevitable ending. Praise to you, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>lol that was weeks back. Some bored anon would probably find it though.</br>  <br><br><br><br>And the screen pans to the YYx2 whom have been watching the whole tape in tears and lust, and then goes and drowns themselves right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hayato is in the same room.<br><br>Watching and waiting for a chance to intervene that never cums.</br></br></br>  <br>Hayato would definitely be into it.</br>  <br> Imouto alliance on the lead <br><br>Nice taste</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1287272299 <br>Who drew this? Reverse search gives me nothing.</br>  <br>Something along those lines. I will finish writing their conclusion later but that's the gist of it.</br>  <br><br>This was the only thing I found:<br><br> The gardens were green and full of flowers. There were stone steps and bamboo walls that resembled the gardens in the old capital like some forgotten temple for blown off course onto Chiba. <br><br> Yukinoshita Haruno led the way. <br><br> It was only now, following her brisk short steps, that I noticed what she was wearing. Elegant and colorful, with a cool blue kimono that appeared a softer shade in the moonlight. Her hair was bound up, and being behind her I was given an exquisite view of her pale nape. <br><br> For a while, we said nothing. Then we turned a corner. <br><br> In an instant, she pulled me close, the distance between our lips were nearly zero. <br><br> I'll admit, for a moment my heart fluttered. <br><br> "You know Hikigaya-kun… when a girl asks a man to be alone with him… there are always other motives." Her breath was sweet. Her skin was smooth, and without pores. It looked ethereal in the pale moonlight. <br><br> I gulped. <br><br> Her hand was pressed against my chest. The scent of her air was causing my mind to wander. <br><br> Flash. <br><br> Huh? What? <br><br> "Oh wow! This is a great picture!" Haruno-san giggled to herself. In her free hand, she held her phone that now possessed a picture of myself and her. If anyone else saw it without the proper context they'd definitely get the wrong idea. <br><br> "H-hey now…" <br><br> "Wow! This is going to go on my Twitter…" <br><br> "That's a bit much… no…" I tried reaching for her phone. I just wanted to hold onto it long enough to delete it. <br><br> "There, there, don't be such a prude," Haruno-san smiled. "Aren't men supposed to be happy they are taking pictures with lovely women? Or perhaps you aren't into women…? Or maybe you think I'm an old onee-chan that's too withered for you, eh? Eh?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The self-deprecating humor suited her as the flower patterns on her bosom blossomed with each jest. It appeared that Haruno-san was a master of masks, able to take any form she so desired or needed. The garden was her natural habitat, full of tall grass and plants, that hides the viper that is her beneath. <br><br> "I just think people might get the wrong idea here…" I said looking around, worried I was getting caught up in her rhythm. If things continued at this pace, I think the situation could become irreversible. <br><br> The woman didn't pay attention to me as she fiddled with her phone. <br><br> "Voila! Uploaded! I'm going to be Twitter famous," Haruno-san giggled to herself. "Aren't you excited Hikigaya-kun? You'll be known as the latest and only in my list of lovers…" <br><br> "Latest… wait, only? Does that mean you've never-?" <br><br> A finger silenced my lips. <br><br> "Feel special now, don't you?" She tucked the phone away into her carry-on bag and walked away to the beat of her own drum. She was happy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>my dick<br><br> making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets <br>best line</br></br></br></br></br></br>  See this<br>What do?</br>  <br> Yo'sup <br>and then I walk back out to go find best girl</br></br>  <br> walk back out to go find best girl <br>But then you'd go outside, immediately turn around and go back inside. That seems rather redundant if you ask me.</br></br>  <br>What if Hayato is actually the protagonist of a NTR series, and 8man has been the villain all of this time? Do we root for evil?</br>  <br>It's not evil if Hayato enjoys getting cucked.</br>  <br><br>Fall to my fucking knees.<br><br>I live to serve you, best Yukinoshita.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>  Years later, Hayato finally asks Iroha for her hand in marriage.  <br><br>  Iroha accepts.  <br><br>  Cue camera to a typical wedding scene. We see people from 2-F, including a Yumiko holding in her tears.  <br><br>  We see Iroha giving birth to a boy in the hospital with Hayato with his dumbass smile. <br><br>  Two years later, we're at the Hayama mansion. <br><br>  "Iroha, you're going out? Don't worry, I'll take care of our son. Say hi to Yukino, Yuigahama, and Hikigaya for me." <br><br>  "Thanks! You're the best husband and father. Will do." <br><br>  Hayato monologue time. Hmm, I'm glad I took time off from work so Iroha has been going out to socialize lately. She's been really down last year, and I don't like that she has been taking all of those depression pills. <br><br>  Minutes later. What's this? Iroha left her phone. Better call Yukino and let her know. <br><br>  "Hey Yukino? It's me, Hayato. Can you let me know when Iroha's done hanging out with you guys? I'll pick her up with my car." <br><br>  "Huh? Iroha-san? I haven't seen her since the baby shower." <br><br> "W--what? But hasn't she been hanging out with the old Service Club gang?

This would be the girls’ conclusion to watching the tape:<br><br>The tape ends, but instead of a black screen they are met with a picture of Haruno’s smug face. The three girls are left speechless. Yui’s and Yukino’s face depict nothing but absolute horror; it’s as if they just witnessed the most horrific live murder ever shown to humankind. Iroha’s face demonstrates admiration and jealously, but she diligently takes notes of 8man’s sexual likes.<br><br>Haruno thanks them for watching something so dear to her and proceeds to tell them that she has to go because she is running late to her date with 8man. She explains how frustrated the both of them have been because they have not been able to see each other due to Haruno’s busy life with her family.<br><br>As she says her goodbyes, Yukino tries to stand up to stop her from her rendezvous with 8man but her knees are too weak (for multiple reasons) and she falls to the floor. Haruno leaves and the girls are left dumbstruck.<br><br>After calming down, Yukino and Yui get their 8man facemask and find the biggest cucumber in their fridge and use it as a strap-on. Meanwhile, Iroha practices the kisses that she saw in the sex tape with double YY and they have the most explosive sex while screaming their respective nicknames for 8man.<br><br> I wish I could edit my posts, I had a lot of stupid grammar mistakes in the fanfic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Glasses Yukino &gt; Twintail Yukino &gt; Shitty Normal Yukino</br></br>  <br> my love comedy is wrong as expected <br><br> False <br><br>Am I the only one who has noticed this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, nobody else in the history of the world noticed it.</br>  <br>It was only wrong in the beginning because he made it go another direction.</br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/5057196 <br><br>Hahahahaha!

For some reason, Yuigahama was the one who took it. <br><br> “I-I’ll do it for you!” She started digging out rice from the wooden container with gusto, humming as if she thought this was all fun and games. “Here you go!” <br><br> Oh wow. She whipped me a mountain of rice that wouldn’t look out of place in a Japanese folklore tale. Well, whatever. I was thinking of eating another serving, so I wasn’t complaining. “Thanks…” <br><br> With great solemnity, I let the bowl fall on my wrists and held it over my head in worship. Only then did I start eating a second time. <br><br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>Just what kind of poison did Yui put in 8man's rice bowl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just fuck already, it's clear to everyone that you're both tsundere for eachother.</br></br>  <br>She tried to slip in some pseudo love potion.<br><br>Real answer: <br>His previous bowl had natto, seaweed flavouring and a raw egg.<br>He didn't like it so plain rice was better.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Oh man, it's been a while since I last went there since I don't need the TLs either.<br>Seems like he changed the layout, huh.

They strike me as the type of people that get triggered by NTR threads and shitpost on them, read vanilla exclusively and behave like insecure cucks that always go for the most beta girl since in their mind such a character is the only one capable of "pure" love.<br>This is merely a hypothesis, mind you.</br></br>  <br>Shiromeguri and Ebina needs more love.</br>  <br>Megurin is too pure for this threads.</br>  <br>She has a decent reason to be a bitch to YY2.<br>She's very insecure and has abandonment issues.<br><br>She hates Yukino because she has a history with Hayama she doesn't know the details of.<br>She's afraid of Hayama being taken away from her.<br><br>She finds out Yui started skipping out on their girl time to go spend time with Yukino.<br>She's afraid of Yui being taken away from her.<br><br>She knew Yui was going to have lunch with Yukino, but couldn't outright state her insecurities.<br>So she decided to stall and play dumb, but came off bitchy.<br><br>She tried to get along with the service club by playing tennis with them, when Yukino wasn't there.<br>They didn't let her join in on their reindeer games, so she had to try to force her way in.<br>She even offered to practice with Saika, if she won.<br>She never said that she wouldn't let them help out too.<br><br>Also putting Haruno at the bottom clearly shows you need their character and intentions spelled out for you to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My problem with Haruno is that she needs to fuck off, or in less edgy terms, stop fucking with high school kids too much. I get it, she's a worried Onee-san that cares about her imouto, and is going 8man style about it. Why the need to treat people like her personal clowns?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128740813 <br>Oh also, about Miura; being a cuntblocker to Iroha without making moves on the cunt and mocking Saki without knowing why she even wanted to make chocolates.</br>  <br>I smell an NTRfag pretending he's better than anybody.</br>  <br>I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man; she used to lightly tease her like during the mall date.<br><br>She sees how much 8man can get shit done by being an asshat, during the Culture Festival. She also knows 8man has gotten closer to Yukino than she has in years, so she tries to emulate him.<br><br>She becomes the villain in 8man's stead because she doesn't want Yukino to lose her friends. She even tries to brace Yui for her eventual jealousy and make her keep in mind to make choices where Yui wouldn't hurt herself or Yukino too badly.<br><br>8man and Shizuka are the only ones who understand what she's doing, but don't really accept her methods either.<br><br>I'm going to go through the LN's again for various other reasons, but I want to confirm her character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man <br>Problem is we've had at least a couple scenes in 9 and 10 that indicate Haruno has always been a terror to Yukino, and probably Hayama to a lesser extent.</br></br>  <br><br> Nice first experiences that totally happened during elementary school. <br><br>They are still first experiences. First crush, first time holding hands with a boy, first time kissing a boy. Age does not change a thing.<br><br> More like didn't bother to stand up for her so she decided to do it herself by becoming better than everyone else. <br><br>More like the rejection fucked with her so much that she developed an inferiority complex and always tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her.<br><br> She was cold towards Yui during this part because Yui was being a slut talking about how embarrassing it is to be a virgin while Yukino says placing importance on losing it is completely stupid. <br><br>Of course Yukino says that it's stupid, she can't relate to it.<br><br> She gave those exact same chocolates to Haruno before starting grade school. <br><br>I'm assuming you are not a retard and that you have heard of double standards before, right? Giving chocolates to your dear older sister and to a boy, who also happens to be your crush, and the same age as you is not the same thing.<br><br>Instead of insulting Yui and making a fool out of yourself, you should probably read what you type before posting. Besides, the fact that she is concerned about being a virgin and how embarrass she gets when she talks about it just further emphasizes her innocence, especially when she is still a virgin albeit the fact that she could literally pick any guy from the school (besides 8man) to lose her virginity with. <br><br>I know that realizing that your waifu is beyond used goods is a hard pill to swallow, but you have to accept it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> giving chocolate when you're 3 makes you beyond used goods <br>This is what Irohafags actually believe</br></br>  <br><br> age doesn't matter <br><br>not even that guy but you know there's reason why you're more held liable for the choices you make as an adult right? same logic here, she isn't even as matured nor has experience anything before.<br><br>as for your other points, they all revolve around baseless assumptions. <br><br> she can't relate to it <br>are you serious? she said it's normal to be a virgin at their age, not that I have anything against Yui but she was literally the only one making a big deal out of it. she calls it stupid because she thinks it's trivial.<br><br><br> double standards <br>calm down pre-edgelord 8man, stop misinterpreting kindness for flirting<br><br> tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her <br><br>are you serious? is that why she has never showed any heed to him throughout the novel?<br><br>obvious bait is obvious but i'll bite anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also pretty ironic since Iroha gave chocolate to Hayama before she gave them to 8man too<br><br>Who knows how many countless guys got chocolate from her before</br></br></br>  <br>She and Yumiko forced Hayama to try their chocolates, so technically neither have given him chocolates on V-day that we know of yet.<br>He'd have turned them down, he said he never accepts chocolates <br> anymore because Yukino put her blood, spit, and pubes in the chocolates she gave to him years ago to make him fall in love with her <br><br>She let 8man try the chocolates first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3-5 year old <br> pubes <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br> pubes  <br> 3 years old <br>Trying too hard?</br></br></br>  <br>We literally saw Hayama eat the chocolate retard, of course he had it<br>Also<br> pubes </br></br></br>  <br>Obligatory <br> pubes </br></br>  <br>Unrelated question, but did you have pubes at 3 years old?

Because if you want to buy a manga in the west it's about 13 dollars per volume. Most series are 10+ volumes  <br>kids grow up reading manga over watching anime in japan, kids grow up watching cartoons over reading (anything) in the west</br>  <br>Isn't that still cheaper than BDs?</br>  Anime is more accessible and just an easier medium to absorb.<br><br>It's the same reason cartoons are more popular than comic books.</br></br>  <br>Nobody buys BDs. Nobody.</br>   americans <br> reading </br>  <br>Because there is no sense of immediacy. That spells death in marketing terms.<br><br>Cartoon network has a community that likes to discuss each episode as it airs.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw you grew up reading choose your own adventure goosebumps books as a 12 year old, along with  Tom Clancy and Terry Pratchett <br>Thanks dad.</br></br>   reading   reading is for fags, cool kids watch anime   reading   you can get the full experience of anime for free on your pc and its pretty main stream<br>manga lacks popular culture value, is harder to enjoy for free on pc</br>  Reading is for gaylords, I'd rather smoke weed.  <br>It depends on the genre and artist. <br><br>Shonen and other action-volumes like One Piece or Naruto are terrible because you can't understand what the hell is happening on the page.</br></br></br>  <br> is harder to enjoy for free on pc <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Heh. Shut up, Miki.</br>  Reading's for fags and yuropoors.  <br>I mean I prefer all sorts of cartoons and manga on physical form rather than on a pc of any sort.<br>For manga to be pop you need lots of ppl collecting physical manga books which is expensive.</br></br>   mfw so many americunts post &gt;reading despite watching subbed anime <br><br>The reason is that manga isn't as hyperstimulating as most anime so ADHD retards (most young American adults and 4chan shitposters) don't care as much</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br> Why is manga so unpopular compared to anime in the West when it's the inverse that applies in Japan? <br>reasons for mangas unpopularity in west is what im talking about</br></br>  <br>Those t shirts are stupid as fuck</br>  <br>How is any of what you said in that post related to the previous posts?<br>Or are you just retarded and felt like replying to an unrelated post?</br></br>  <br><br>MAN IM NOT THAT GUY BUT YOU'RE TALKIN ABOUT PIRACY/STREAMING ANIME WHEN YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR MANGA<br><br>LMAO RETARD</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously you had no Harry Potter as a child. Or Captain Underpants.</br>  <br> her headband made out of artificial flowers </br>  <br>That's part of what makes the picture hilarious.</br>  <br><br> Why is manga so unpopular compared to anime in the West when it's the inverse that applies in Japan? <br><br>How can you not observe how reading (and reading comprehension) declined drastically in the USA? Many bookstores have gone out of business and even used bookstores have died out. People just don't read (much) anymore and the attitudes about reading have changed. Now, you see a lot of "Too Long Didn't Read" or "Why the Blog Post?" in forums from people who hate seeing anything longer than several sentences. <br><br>Downloading of hentai manga and doujinshi doesn't count as reading because....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't read shit</br>  <br>Because Borders went out of business.</br>  <br>can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga?</br>  For me it's about consistency. There are so many manga that are either partially translated, on hiatus, span many volumes with no end in sight, or are just cancelled abruptly. Because of these reasons I've probably dropped more manga than I've actually finished.  <br>Then why don't really read things that are completely translated?</br>  America =! The west.<br>France and Italy read manga more than anyone else outside of Asia. You can buy a tank for 4€.</br>  <br> Obviously you had no Harry Potter as a child. <br><br>Harry Potter was an anomaly that the publishing industry thought could help reverse the drastic decline in reading. It wasn't purely about selling more books. The issue of trying to re-popularize reading with children is why so many bookstores bent over backwards to open at midnite just to make sure that kids got a hold of books. However, it remained just that - an anomaly for the most part.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude I jut masturbated</br>  <br> Harry Potter </br>  <br>Are there more manga translated in French or Italian than English? I'm considering learning either of those languages for that purpose since Japanese is 2hard.</br>  <br>I prefer Anime cuz soundtrack is a big part of an entertainment medium, and with manga which has no soundtrack, it can't build any tension, convey emotion or do anything.<br>My most favourite examples of this are Kaiji and Berserk.<br>Berserk anime was kinda bad in a way, if not for Susumu Hirasawa's soundtracks which made it a masterpiece, Kaiji had Hideki Taniuchi as the compositor and so did Death Note, and this is why both those anime shows are so superior to manga, they could actually convey emotion, while manga is just story, and very often that story is dumb and not interesting, aside from maybe Berserk and Railgun out of what i read, and also some manga-only stories like Uzumaki and Trigun Maximum</br></br></br>  <br>Amazon has been offering some good prices these days too. The first volume of OPM is on pre-order for only 6 bucks.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot I just fapped as well</br>  <br>I have been doing that more, but there are still other interesting series that may be incomplete. I keep reading and hoping to see the end.</br>  <br> manga which has no soundtrack, it can't build any tension, convey emotion or do anything <br>You need to read some better manga, m8.</br></br>  <br> can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga? <br>Hey gramps, 1998 called and said they want you back.</br></br>  <br>nice blog faggot</br>  <br>I, too, have fapped recently. Please stop.</br>  <br>On PC you just get distracted and end up not reading anything, it just doesn't feel right on a screen as it does on a physical copy of the manga</br>  <br>use your imagination</br>  <br>Get that ADHD checked out.</br>  Printed media is dying in the west, whereas Japan, as conservative as it is, seems to have a very dedicated industry that's still holding pretty well mostly due to its accessibility and portability.<br><br>Not only manga, but also LN's have a huge consumer base, you will see people of all ages reading manga and LN's, they also read it everywhere, on the way to work or at home, at school or bookstores.<br><br>Not only do the people consume it as form of entertainment, but also appreciate it for the trade and aspire to become mangakas one day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can hate a children's book all you want for having shoddy writing, but it was a children's book, bro. And it did a good job of entertaining children.</br>  <br>Exactly, you can't.</br>  <br>That is not the fault of the manga or the PC. That is you, that is your problem. I will agree that reading something you can hold in your hands is a better experience.<br><br><br> he doesn't just print out the pages, make the glue by hand and assemble his own manga <br>Fucking casuals.</br></br></br></br></br>  Pretty much all the downsides to manga in the Western fandom like licensing issues, pricing, translation quality, scanlation drama, decline of bookstores/printed media are a non-factor in Japan.<br><br><br>A lot more in French.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't all LNs niche otaku shit?</br>  <br>Try getting a phone app and reading manga on that. That was the only way I could really start reading manga. Phones make it harder to flip through different applications and they're portable.</br>  <br> Because Borders went out of business. <br><br>Dalton Books was a major bookstore chain that used to be in every major mall also disappeared. Waldenbooks was another bookstore chain often in the same mall because books were popular up to the late 1980's. The Tower Books chain (related to Tower Records) was famous for its closures.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but the trees</br>  <br>There are four billion manga running at any given time, few of which get physical or legal English releases. Also, Americans don't read  I have the opposite problem and can't concentrate on a show but can read through manga no problem. </br>  <br>Maybe, i tried reading top MAL recommendations lol and went from there with what i liked more. I read FMA, NGE, Berserk, Railgun, Uzumaki, Steins;Gate, FLCL,Yotsuba&amp;!, Akame ga Kill, Nisekoi, Deadman Wonderland, Tokyo Ghoul and Naruto  and so far none of these really felt that great, they were just bad or insuperior to the anime.<br><br> it's your fault for liking a better experience <br>What are you even trying to say?<br><br>Might try that, but it won't be free will it? Especially on iCuck?<br><br>Don't have none<br><br>I did, and i even put some soundtrack up in my headphones but the pacing just isn't the same it's all too fast or too slow in some moments.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mmm dat book smell</br></br>  <br><br>That depends on the title, but lately is gaining a lot of popularity, considering the many LN adaptations we've seen every so often in the last couple of years.You are probably thinking about Dōjinshi.</br></br>  <br> lol <br> Cuck <br> insuperior <br>Man, I really hope this is bait and you're not actually sixteen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your attention span is shit then.<br>Reading manga instead of reading anime is like reading episode summaries on wikia, you are just getting info, not the whole experience</br></br>  <br> Maybe, i tried reading top MAL recommendations <br><br>Kill yourself any time.</br></br></br>  <br> stop saying words i don't like! </br>  <br>You what? There is no whole experience if it's a manga original.</br>  <br>Well, where else was i supposed to go? Reddit? That's even worse and rec threads on /a/ aren't allowed. Googling "best manga" will just bring up One Piece, Naruto and Bleach</br>  <br>Oh man I'm sorry I'm not a big fan of pages blurred to hell to hide all the noise in bad scans.</br>  <br>Maybe if I could understand nip it would be better, because as it is I've begun to feel more and more recently like most dialogue scenes are just 10% reading the dialogue and 90% me sitting through a picture of some guy saying gibberish emphatically.</br>  <br>What? You do realize that digital distribution is a thing right?<br>Or did you just wake up from a coma?</br></br>  <br> Images can't invoke emotions without sound <br>Man what a faggot, why are you even on an imageboard if you need your precious sound tracks to get into anything?</br></br>  <br>the wiki</br>  <br> not having an extension that reads every 4chan post that's highlighted with the voice of the Kaiji narrator </br>  <br><br>Find a genre you like and learn how to use the tag system in manga sites. And read more stuff targeted at your actual age demographic if you aren't a teenager anymore.</br></br>  <br> Paying full price for a drm scan that you don't even really own. <br>I'll stick to paper books thank you.</br></br>  <br>I'm listening to music right now.<br>Soundtracks are the main attraction about anime for me, i'm sorry if you're some kinda SoL moeshit watcher and your show has nothing but electro-guitar or vocaloid music in but still.<br><br>and when someone posts a bait posts it says "Zawa"<br>that would be rad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's your fault for liking a better experience <br> What are you even trying to say? <br>He was saying it's your fault that you get distracted when on a PC, not the fault of manga as a medium or the PC/internet itself. <br><br>And yes it would be free to read manga on your phone. You aren't very intelligent are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  Guys, the "manga sucks because there's no music" guy is clearly shitposting, just drop it.  <br> you aren't very intelligent are you? <br>Or i just don't use my phone/any manga site which is why i lack the knowledge how do i do that?</br></br>  <br> Soundtracks are the main attraction about anime for me, i'm sorry if you're some kinda SoL moeshit watcher and your show has nothing but electro-guitar or vocaloid music in but still. <br>Nah I'm not that into moeshit, I'm just saying if you don't get anything out of visuals then you might as well just stop watching anime and start listening to concept albums instead. Cause if you're into a visual medium only because of the sound then you're doing a lot of shit wrong.</br></br>  Color. Don't get me wrong, I like the stories, but maybe I'm too spoiled by Based Western Comic Industry and like my comics to not look like a rough draft before getting sent to the colorist.  <br>Read The Ancient Magus Bride which is a far superior series than most of the series you've listed.</br>  <br><br>But he's got a point, also what's up with the terrible animation in manga? All of it is just still frames, what a shitty medium.</br></br>  <br> Based Western Comic Industry <br><br>How are they based if they can't even write decent stories? Even the art isn't that great.<br><br>Comic books have always been shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not only because of sound, but it's a big part of the experience, i like concept albums too, but rarely anything good comes out of it.<br>It's just that a soundtrack is a topping on the iceberg that is an anime show, hell i would still love Evangelion even if it didn't have good soundtrack, i only noticed on like my third rewatch of that show but it just makes the experience this much better.<br><br> wah he's not like me he must be shitposting <br>k then<br><br>Thanks, it looks pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All animation is just still frames. You're supposed to draw the in-betweens for manga yourself and then flip it really quick to get the motion.</br>  <br>I use mangastorm on my iphone. It uses online manga readers and it's free.</br>  <br>Digitally colored comics look like ugly plastic shit just like modern anime.</br>  <br>Comic books are more kinda escapist stuff about fantasy world when there are all sorts of manga there, also black and white looks more detailed imo</br>  <br><br>Am I supposed to color the pictures too? What's next? Do I have to do the voice acting too? Fuck that noise.</br></br>  <br>Western comics have the worst fucking colorists. All the B&amp;W comics are infinitely superior.</br>  <br>You're in charge of censorship, too.</br>  <br> Fucking American  <br><br>Do you some of you guys not have the ability to read?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump American capeshit with based European comics.</br>  <br> can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga? <br><br>The price is free when it comes to piracy. Since pretty much everyone expects all popular manga to have pirated versions, many people simply don't buy anymore and wait for the pirate version to appear. Naturally, to alleviate guilt, many people invent or accept reasons why they pirate media such as "it's not worth paying for" or "I don't like the translation quality but it's still good enough to read if I steal it" or "why pay when a free copy is available online?".<br><br>I think the reading statistics will go up substantially if all the pirate book, magazine, comic, manga, and douinshi were to close down due to being criminalized. Right now, non-profit piracy is essentially a civil court case matter. Do not confuse this with criminal piracy which is the selling of large quantities of duplicated copies into the official distribution chain. The TPP free trade treaty would criminalize the non-profit piracy thus making it a criminal case that even your local police can obtain a search warrant and arrest you for doing. Many things are illegal due to laws, but are not formally criminalized. Criminalization would force a priority issue as well as give incentives to local police to enforce piracy laws because they are allowed to seize (and then auction off) property involved in the piracy. For example, if you sell drugs out of your home, it is possible for the state to seize your property and foreclose it. <br><br>TPP<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>-Pacific_Partnership<br><br>The USA position on TPP includes that ISP's should be held accountable for piracy if current technology can be used to detect it. TPP changes the definition of "commercial" to include any significant quantity even if there was no intent to profit or actual profit obtained.<br><br>TPP Intellectual Property Requirements<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>-Pacific_Partnership_intellectual_p<wbr>roperty_provisions</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not reading Argonautica in fifth grade <br>Granted it was the prose translation.</br></br>  <br>Manga is like $5 or less over here.</br>  It's hard to get and expensive.

Seems like all your eyes saw was sex rather than all the symbolism.</br></br>  <br><br>Not really, it went viral and people started to fuss about it in the social networks, but it died out pretty quick like most virals.<br><br>For the most part the shitstorm stayed between the boundaries of the normie nets. If anything anime has been dying for a long time, there's no way a single animated short could kill it.<br><br>Although the spillage that fell on /a/ was very annoying during that period of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  gee, how often do you fap?</blockquote>]
