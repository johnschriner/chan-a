Woah, Yuyushiki reference    <br> Trash bins </br>  <br>I don't know, at this point I don't think it will happen at all. The mini after FD could have been delayed to promote alongside CC's anime but it was released without fuss or fanfare. Leaf/Aquaplus are putting all their resources into Underwater Ray Romano 2: Electric Boogaloo now too so it's all the more unlikely.<br><br>Feels extremely bad man.</br></br></br>    /ak/ thread hit image limit as I was posting this<br><br>http://girls-und-panzer.jp/img/spec<wbr>ial/manga_shokai.pdf<br>Reposting first two pages without crop lines</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>For my part I just want to see the girls fucked by black cocks.</br>  <br/>  <br> bishoujo figure <br>but its a tank</br></br>  <br>that's_the_point.jpg<br><br><br><br>no, literaly<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Azul, pls</br>  One Piece SBS 78 Official Confirmed - <br><br>The high mortality rate for mothers in the series is because "adventure" is the antonym of "mother."<br><br>Oda confirms that Gimlet and Russia are named after alcohol.<br><br>Dory from Law's flashback is confirmed to be X. Drake. Drake admired his father, Barrels, and dreamed of being a Marine like him. Something happened and Barrels became a pirate and was violent towards Drake. Drake went with him regardless. As we saw in the flashback, 19-year-old Drake escapes with the Marines... yet later on becomes a pirate like his father.<br><br>Buggy can get through Doflamingo's Bird Cage.<br><br>Oda gives Nami and Robin large busts because it's the dream of young boys.<br><br>A 30-year-old Crocodile was in the newpaper that Corazon was reading 16 years ago, covering his heroic deeds as a Warlord in Alabasta.<br><br>Pica's shoulders have spikes because he wore shoulder pads that were in that shape, much like how a watermelon will become square if kept in a square box while it's growing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I, for one, would love it Caesar joined but unfortunately Luffy knows how much a twat he is and he's the kind of guy Luffy hates the most.</br>  <br> the most popular character <br> dying for chopper <br> chopper <br> ever being relevant </br></br></br></br>  <br>law can live after the surgery same way gai lived after opening the 8th gates but he wouldn't have mentioned such a surgery for it not be used.<br><br>It's going to get used by Law the same way every other mentioned thing came to fruition like impel down or fishman island or the strongest fishman swordsman or ace giving luffy his vivre card or anything else that got mentioned in passing only to come up later</br></br></br>  <br>You'r using too much logic.<br>Bounty posters should say DEVIL FRUIT USER in huge letters but they never do. Nobody knows what powers the bad guy has, not even people with connections like Robin.<br>Bounty posters never even mention what crime was comited, so there's no way of knowing wether the high bounty is indicative of being superpowerful or of being dangerous to the WG (like Robin at age 8)</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why not. He's a doctor and his Father was a doctor. Maybe the Doctor's will can live on through a racoon. Why must be question nature ? And it would be arguably better than Luffy getting it.</br>  Go back 10 Chapters. Re-read.
