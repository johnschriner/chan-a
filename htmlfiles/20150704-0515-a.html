[ Looks like she is still a loli after all. <br><br>I guess Gate is saved.</br></br>  <br><br>Left or right?</br></br>  <br>Rori is saved. Thank God for that, I was honestly worried since we didn't have a reference point until now.</br>  <br><br>How does she look like a loli?</br></br>  <br> pink panties <br>slut</br></br>  <br>I don't mind the new design. I'm glad her appearance is at least as she should be, that is, 13 years old. <br><br>Also, Rori is best Gate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's much smaller than the elf.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? She looks like a little girl.</br>  <br>I she now? I'm not really seeing it, but whatever.<br>This is just a magazine illustration, and what we had so far was her official anime character design.<br>I will stop worrying when she will appear small in the naime.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br> 13 <br>You mean 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> LolisRDead doing "that" again <br>Fuck off. I can see your ass form miles away.</br></br></br></br>   elf wearing jeans and a t-shirt <br><br>There's something about that that does things to my dick.</br></br>  <br>from*</br>  <br>If one thing needed saving in this anime adaptation, it definitely has to be that the anime got her loli-ness correct. I am pleased.</br>  Why is she wearing modern panties?  <br>Goth loli sluts are the best, bro.</br>  <br> slutty pink <br> not pure black with lace <br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Fat ass, large breasts. pointy ears. Looks like a loli to me.</br>  <br>Better than the ugly manga design.</br>  <br>Fuck. I liked it better when I thought she was tall and lanky.</br>  <br>Pink is too childish for her. Damn that illustrator.</br>  <br><br>They went full retard. Where is her sexy underwear?</br></br>  <br>Clearly that dude didn't read or care about it at all.<br>He looked at the anime design and drew something for his money.</br></br>  <br>At least it isn't the ugly manga art style.</br>  <br>That elf seems in need of something.</br>  https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-02/crunchyroll-to-stream<wbr>-gate-anime/.90003<br><br> The stream will premiere on July 3 at 1:00 p.m. EDT. </br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>That elf single-handedly nearly destroyed this series for me. She should get dicked to death.</br>  <br>Cheers to that.</br>  <br><br> elf girl in jeans <br><br>Is this Heaven?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Looks like she is still a loli after all. <br>Athough assuming this trailer is her intended voice, they are going for near Ara ara old lady rather than loli squeaks.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/Oju_4ogaXv4  [ ]<br> I like it, she is suppose to be old by demigod standards, 861 years for her is the equivalent of being an 80+ year old woman. She was basically settling down with Itami as her companion for the rest of her natural life as a mortal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>961 years old I mean.</br>  <br><br>Balls deep in dat butt.</br></br>  <br>she voice like a middle age slut<br>not a 961 years old demigod loli</br></br>  <br> she voice like a middle age slut <br>That is what I meant. Ara ara old lady.</br></br>  A better thing to worry about is Why does Lelei look like a sailor scout?<br>Why does she have blue hair too?</br>  <br>Who cares about a loli when you have that elf on the right?</br>  <br> priestess of the god of death <br> pink child panties </br></br>  <br>There had to be at least one girl with an unnatural hair color, Rory was a no-go and the elf already has elf moe going on, so Lelei really was the only candidate.</br>  <br><br>Because she always had. Her family is from a different world and they all have powerful magic.</br></br>  <br>We'll see if she fits in our charts.</br>  <br>MAGIC</br>  <br>don't worry she gets a mid season upgrade to goth loli panties ~</br>  <br> LRDTHK  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>This triggers me.</br>  <br>It shouldn't really.<br>Anyway a loli has really just three common characteristics.<br><br> Must be born to a race that has similar height averages to humans <br> Must be below 148 cm but higher than 100 cm <br> Must have A to AA cups. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  So which subgroup is doing Gate?  <br>In the end  she didn't even kill the dragon <br><br> What a fuckup. </br></br></br>  She looked better in the key art, I hope it's just a fuck up.  <br>Not entirely true:  She used a spell that zapped the dragon and the electric current blew the explosives, killing the dragon as opriginally intended. </br>  <br> Pfz 3 <br>Aw yeah</br></br>  <br> I thought Itami hit the explosives at the last second? </br>  <br> Lelei stabbed the dragon with all the swords in the area using the screw principle<br>Tuka cast a large electric spell that used the swords as conductors<br>Itami's explosives caught fire because of the lightning</br></br> </br>  <br>She looks like a loli to me. At least, she looks pretty close to 13 to me.</br>  <br>nice sao artstyle</br>  <br>Compare to her first appearance <br>she looks completely different</br></br>   elf  <br> blonde <br> low waist jeans  <br>AOTY</br></br></br>  <br>I really dont care at all but 13 isn't loli. loli=prepubescent body.</br>  <br>is this the reason they changed her skirt.<br>for panty shots?</br></br>  Next week baby  <br> Pubescent lolis don't exist </br>  <br>Source?</br>     24 episodes <br> 30 minutes each <br><br>Aw yeaaaaah</br></br></br>  <br>30 minutes means the regular length, you know.</br>  <br><br> 2 cour <br><br>My dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so where the fuck are they planning on ending it then? When they kill the dragon?</br>  <br>Probably to the end of the japan visit.</br>  <br> Next week baby <br>What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours...<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;24  episodes<br>YES! This means we get the Dark Elves and the Dragon hunt!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>24 episodes? No way. Past that.</br>  <br> Probably to the end of the japan visit. <br>The Japan visit was painful. The weakest part of the story. I rather they fast forward it a bit and don't spend more than two episodes.</br></br>  <br> What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours... <br>I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh.</br></br>  <br>Monmusu is on the 7th</br>  <br>I would guess so.<br>There's 5 books (adapted into 10 Light Novels), and Book 2 is the dragon fight.<br>So covering up to two books should be fine.</br></br></br>  <br> 18  <br>you mean 800</br></br>  <br> leaving your mouse on the screen and not hiding it in the corner somewhere <br>Literally the worst fucking people to breathe air that could be getting breathed by someone else.</br></br>  <br> 800 <br><br>She's like 980 or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh. <br>Only on one channel. Western streaming won't be until the latest airing in Japan.</br></br>  <br>It's probably 3 episodes per arc and ending with the dragon. We'll probably see Yao.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about western streaming? Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Is neetball streaming Gate? I just checked and it doesn't seem like it.</br>  <br>I'll rephrase:<br>Who the fuck cares about streaming?</br></br>  <br>i do my computer is broken so until its repaired i'm going to need to stream</br>  <br>That's too bad, but here's the idea: just wait until it gets fixed and watch it in proper quality and manner.</br>  <br>but then i won't be able to shitpost in the threads</br>    <br> Not black lingerie <br><br>They have just one fucking job and they blew it.<br><br>Frankly this upsets me a litte.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _master1200 <br>no</br></br>  <br>You will be.<br> Japanese army propaganda! 2 nukes weren't enough... <br> ELF RAPE RAPE ELF  <br> Rory is no loli, hurr anti lolicon propaganda! <br> generic harem shit <br>Or anything else you can think of.

Some scenes during that get pretty gruesome.</br>  <br>You can speak freely here</br>  <br>eh I suppose that's true. Fair point.</br>  <br>much better tbh</br>  <br> androgynous kuudere <br>to<br> generic blob with oddly colored hair #21,491 <br>This is not okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Rory doesn't have such a strict loli appeal that a non-lolicon can't enjoy her. <br>Now that I heard her voice, I am going to appreciate the gap moe of having an adult woman's voice coming out of the body of a young girl. Is there a fetish name for that?</br></br>  <br> Pink panties <br>And dropped.</br></br>   10h30m until it airs   Not enough appreciation of Tuka's ass up this is bitch. <br><br>Y'all faggots r GAY!</br></br>    <br>Her hair is blue, just a different shade in the anime.<br><br>All characters look much better done, or at least more modern, than in the manga. The manga art is shit, and lazily done. <br><br>Shading is bad, mouth and nose looks like snouth, and just not doing it for me. I coulg go on but again.<br><br>The girls in the manga aren't cute or anything at all. The anime at least looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this.<br><br>In fact, the hair color change makes me wonder if they weren't trying to make her look like Tabitha.</br></br></br>  <br>Old<br><br>Hag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>still, that specific shade of blue should have been avoided. It's too jarring.</br></br></br>  that doesn't look loli at all<br> fuckin blind faggots</br>  <br>How much rape does this have?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nah they're gonna do the entire season 1. <br><br>Episode 1-13 = From start to slaying of the dragon<br>Episode 14-19 = Prince Zorzal's rebellion<br>Episode 19-26 = Defeats of Zorzal and closing of the Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill an Indian bus.</br>  <br>Any proof it's two cours?</br>  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>Left, I really like rori</br>  <br>I think at one point group of bandits raped a girl, killed her, and threw her naked, decapitated used body towards her husband<br><br>I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though</br></br></br>  <br> I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though <br>The body actually flew in the manga?</br></br>  <br><br>CIA in full force. Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty hardcore</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It is certainly possible, especially since they want to promote the upcoming novel sequel and they NEED to finish the main story in the anime for that. Guess it wouldn't be that impossible with 2 cour.</br>  <br>Search by MD5, retard.</br>  <br>Honestly there's a lot of padding in the novel, and in an animated medium it would feel too dragged out if they stick to it. Only reason manga is tolerable at the pace is because it's still a printed medium. <br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br>I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br> I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist. <br>Seriously, 2 cour was far more than I was expecting and as such I can't really complain.</br></br></br>  Yeah, if they can condense 5 volumes of Log Horizon in 2 cours, I can see 5 volumes of GATE in 2 cours.  <br>Unlike others here I'm not really surprised with the 2 cours. <br>GATE is Alphapolis's biggest title, this is their "make or break" moment.

I can put the text in a pastebin  <br>The only way you can improve on it is by deleting it from the internet.

That image will only fuel shitposting and you should know that.</br>  <br>Someone's affected</br>  <br>Yeah, make the damn text readable against the background.</br>  someone mentioned being unable to find gates original webnovel version in one of the previous threads.<br>i managed to find it on my computer today.<br><br>www.mediafire.com/download/zriujpo8<wbr>mqtfn2n/gate.zip</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the biggest thing; "Gate is a work of fiction, so any and all arguments regarding the current state of the real nation of Japan (it's armed forces, relationships with other countries etc) have no relevance to the fictional universe in which Gate takes place."<br>And that comparatively to the majority of American films it hardly qualifies as a 'power fantasy'.<br><br>Also yeah, green text is completely unreadable, and links on images is stupid unless you use a link shortener.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But they are unbeatable! <br><br>Daily reminder that flips has one of the best special forces that could outperform special forces from developed countries even with shit equipment</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm in Japanese locale.</br>  <br>I have the same problem, but notepad seems to work.</br>  <br>Well, that solves it for me as well, thanks.</br>  <br>there are multiple japanese locales.<br>thats what i get when i set webbrowser to western locale.<br><br>$ file Gate.html<br>Gate.html: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except they're like... double the size?</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be too fast?</br>  <br>Step up, senpai.</br>  <br>Haha.<br><br>But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes  like this guy's saying. This isn't your typical LN adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's nearly two hours of screen time per book which is more than what they actually got and I seriously doubt the GATE novel is that long.</br>  <br>Also, it's a fucking web novel so I'm sure there's some form of dumb bullshit they could cut and nobody would give a fuck.</br>  <br>certainly bigger, but not double</br>  <br>Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is protesting against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA overseas <br><br>REMEMBER <br><br>JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION IRL IS HEAVILY AGAINST LIBERALLY REINTERPRETING THE SDF CHARTER WHICH THEIR PM HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people thinking A-1 won't fuck up   <br>Is 2 hours per arc enough? I think that 2:30 hours is the ideal length of a movie for me.</br>  <br>Fuck up is relative. <br>I for one don't think A-1 fucked up SAO. That was shit from the source.</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of mangafags complained about Nanatsu no Taizai. It was also a complete QUALITY fest in the second half, as expected of A-1.</br>  <br>Seven sins was fine. <br>sourcefags will complain no matter what.</br></br>  This is going to be a war strategies/political anime? B-boring.  <br>Let them complain. It's nothing compared to the turd anime One Piece had become.</br>  <br>Neither was Log Horizon.</br>  <br>LH was a light novel. I meant the format in that post. <br>but basing on the anime it seems like they will adapt the light novel?</br></br>  <br> But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes <br><br>Stop and think about what you're saying here. <br><br>They adapted first 5 Harry Potter novels in to 5 movies, 157 minutes each. That's 785 minutes including the long credits. <br><br>24 episodes of anime is 600 minutes, including OP/ED.<br><br>It's not as outrageous a difference as you seem to think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>You see those 9 colorful books on the top shelf? That's Log Horizon. <br>Log Horizon is most definitely NOT small books. <br><br>Now see the shelf below it. <br>The tiny little books on the left side are the GATE light novels, two of those equal one of the GATE books the large books you see to the right of the manga adaptation on the same shelf)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, off by one.. I meant see </br>    <br>What you haven't ever made simple mistakes, Sigmund?</br>  <br> Oops, off by one <br>Yeah, I see that.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's because they streamlined and cut content from the novel version. It doesn't really tell me anything. As for LH are they really that big? It seemed like Haruhi and Spice was longer than those.</br>  <br>My point is that you did not make a mistake.</br>  <br>The adaptation itself being really good? Hasn't really happened.<br>Stuff like Silver Spoon was serviceable, but simply because of the source's story,.<br>So while it won't be visually amazing, with at least the blessing of 2 cour, it'll be passable and cover new material. All we could really ask for.</br></br></br>  <br>Which episodes will be QUALITY?</br>  <br>I'll help out by marking them</br>  <br><br>But SIlver Spoon was really nicely animated throughout. A-1 vary massively. <br>My guess is that they put a lot of money into this so it should look pretty good like SAO, Shigatsu etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I know what's what. <br>I just didn't know those blue books were counted too.<br><br>I'm not confident enough in 5 novels for 24 eps.<br>There was a lot of material skipped for LH as well and it didn't seem long to me when I read it.<br><br>And judging by the art of the anime I think it's the light novels that will get adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading the mushoku manga, but it's hella slow. How the fuck does he manages to marry the 3 girls, the fuck? (childhood friend, royalty brat, and sensei)</br>  <br>Through years of hardships and impotence.</br>  <br>Got separated from the childhood friend by his dad to prevent crippling dependence by childhood friend<br><br>Traveled the world with ojousama and gave each other their virginities then ojousama left to go train in a cave for years (he thought she was dumping him because she's really bad at explanations and just disappeared one morning)<br><br>Decided to pursue higher education, reunited with childhood friend at college and got married. <br><br>Went on a quest to rescue his mom (leaving his pregnant wife behind) but some people died and he ended up depressed, sensei who he rescued "comforted" him and they ended up calling a shotgun wedding<br><br>Much later ojousama finally returns after having achieved maximum powerlevel just in time to rescue him from being killed by the Act 2 final boss, she marries him and basically rapes him on their wedding night</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a timeskip, or is this loli sex?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I haven't read so far but what. How the fuck are the other 2 okay of him having 3 wives.</br>  <br>Obviously a time skip retard.</br>  <br>juve period &gt;youth period&gt; young man period. Like 3 timeskips.</br>  <br>Osananajimi has her own self esteem issues (even though she's like a crack secret service agent and shit)<br><br>Sensei is just happy to share<br><br>Ojousama is confident in the security of their relationship even if he is married three times, (she also tries to get him to fuck the catgirl maid but he just throws the maid out of the room)<br><br>It's not like he just marries everyone he meets, he doesn't fuck his half imouto maid or the catgirl maid for example</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's kinda sad knowing Rudeus should be more mature than Itami since he's lived a longer life, but isn't.  <br>It could be that he settled down to his new world age and stopped thinking like an old man.</br>  <br> mfw eris gives rudeus erectile disfunction </br>  <br><br>Or you know <br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's been married, went through boot camps, commands a squad of trained soldiers, and a trained ranger <br><br>As opposed to<br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's never held a job in his life, parasytes off his parents, and never dated a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elf ass</br>  <br>The point was that pre incarnation Rudeus was a complete manchild who never really grew up, instead running away from reality into eroge and light novels and japanese animes. Hence why in spite of his supposed greater experience a lot of the stuff he says and thinks during Childhood and Juvenile periods exposes his immaturity. And why getting a second life grants him the opportunity to develop in a way that he did not in his previous life. <br><br>By comparison, Itami is a world weary soldier who went through a messy relationship that ended in divorce by mutual consent, animu and mangos is how he finds entertainment not how he evades engaging with society and work.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they divorced? I thought they were just separated.</br>  <br>They're legally divorced. <br>Although the manage to stay friends.</br></br>  <br> brown elf <br><br>are you telling me there's chocolate in this?</br></br></br>  <br>So Rudeus is one of us while Itami is a normalfag</br>  <br>Yes, used and slutty one at that.</br>  <br>even better<br><br>will she be present early?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how far they're gonna go. <br>If they're gonna do the entire First Season you'll see her fairly early on, like ep 10 or so.<br>If they're only gonna do up to the Fire Dragon Arc, you won't see her till well after the first cour.</br></br></br>  <br> pic? </br>  <br> One of those bitches are dead </br>      <br>holy shit fuck yes<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>   Pina doesn't wear extreme boobplate armor <br>I like it.</br>  <br>  pic <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Announcement that Crunchyroll picked it up for simulcast. <br>And it also revealed that this will be 2 cours.</br></br>  <br>tnx</br>  <br>Rudeus is who we are, Itami is who we wish we were.</br>  <br>Can't find this without the text. Help?</br>  <br> that pic <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br></br>  <br>That looks greatly more medieval or renaissance than roman. I am disappoint.</br>  <br>You also have to consider the format, it's not like a pocket light novel. Also, the light novel version, which is 10 volumes, is practically 400 pages each volume.</br>  <br>No it's not. It's under 270 pages. I just opened them to see. <br><br>Log horizon is about 350 pages, so Gate is significantly bigger, but not double.

They want oil, lithium, and other conflict resources that are only useful with modern industry. Also just the arable land. Japan has a very real issue with how much it can import into it's tiny island nation via sea. Routinely there are huge strikes by overworked laborers at the docks.</br>  Crunchyroll doesn't even have their Gate page up yet.  <br>You could probably drive up the value higher by calling them magic otherworld diamonds.

Episode 1 finished. <br><br>They removed a lot of politic talks, it seems the anime is going to play safe and take out as much of that as possible. Sort of like Highschool of the Dead. <br><br>Itami killing that soldier without hesitation was fucking awesome. <br>They upped both his goofiness and badassery from the books.</br></br></br></br></br>  Was the vision of the girls in the books?  <br>no one reads the novels here</br>  <br>There's an anon who does I'm waiting for him</br>  <br>Yes I do?<br><br><br>Nope, nor was his daydreaming.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So anime only story IS confirmed.

Old storytelling technique when you can't get to the good stuff yet.</br></br>  <br>Yes, pretty much all the scenes before the attack was original.<br><br><br>Not really, none of the stuff they added really detracts from the main plot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are JSDF what did you expect?<br>Also, now that I think about it, imagine just how much you could send these people to the deepest parts of despair by blaring various types of music through speakers as you decimate their forces with tech superiority.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ap1<wbr>ea8bvMgw</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dZB<wbr>oiW460nU</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hLf<wbr>dYZoJ-d8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dJM<wbr>qkDnpoys</wbr>  [ ]<br>Just make it grand, make people look up in terror and amazement as they wonder how the fuck can these outsiders produce such ear splitting cacophonies from such a small cubicle while also killing every thing in seconds.<br>Why didn't they just do this anyway?<br>Make music the prelude to a destruction only compared to god's wrath, they would become so conditioned by this shit that they would ban music all together and if they so much as heard a melodic pluck of strings they would shit themselves.<br>There, problem solved, music saves us once again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like elf in casual clothes design<br>Rory on the other hand is meh</br>  <br>Are you mental or did you not understand what you're even replying to.</br>  <br>They have music in their world as well.<br>They don't know Ride of the Valkyries anyway<br>We also don't know the kind of music they'll be frightened by</br></br></br>  <br> We also don't know the kind of music they'll be frightened by <br>Dubstep?</br></br>  <br><br>It's low-level psychological warfare<br><br> WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT MUSIC AND WHERE IS IT COMING FROM...OH SHIT! </br></br></br></br>  <br>They hear dying screams of cut necks regularly<br><br>I don't think dubstep which does nothing will affect them</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of music and war. One of my buds told me a funny story about when we were invading Iraq. Apparently one of Saddam's generals was bunkered down in his base or mansion and wouldn't come out and surrender. But apparently we knew that the guy hated AC/DC. So we grabbed a bunch of speakers and just blasted that stuff at this base for a couple of days before he finally gave up. <br><br>Psychological warfare is neat.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't need to frighten them WITH dubstep. You just need to post a picture of Skrillex and his damned ugly haircut.</br></br>  <br>I understand.<br>Ride of the Valkyries. Vietnam, ect. I just went on a tangent.<br><br>Of course they have music.<br>However they can't play anything anywhere with enough force to rock your entire body.<br>It doesn't matter what you play, or what they might be scared of, are you scared of music anon? <br>You could even play the teletubbies theme song and they would fear it after they witness what 21 century war is all about.<br>That's why I called it conditioning, they would associate any loud music with mass destruction and death.<br><br>This anon understands.<br>This is why I said grand so as to seem otherworldly and awe inspiring</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They can't hear the music over the helos noise anyway. And it alone already frighten them.</br></br>  <br> That's why I called it conditioning, they would associate any loud music with mass destruction and death. <br>You were using it in the context of Italica, the first thing they'd be frightened by would be the choppers<br>They'd be dead before they're conditioned anyway</br></br></br>  <br><br>I heard they did the same thing to Noriega. Blasted Van Halen's Panama at him 24/7 until he surrendered.</br></br>  <br>And they say rock never helped anyone</br>  <br>Eh, I was thinking more in the long run.<br>It wouldn't need to be just from helicopters either.<br>Just spend a month fucking the land up, with music playing.<br>Peasants couldn't even stop watching if they wanted.<br>Grab a few soldiers from a skirmish, force them to record shit into a microphone.<br>Play said shit every night were others can hear.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4d9<wbr>H_1ygEv8</wbr>  [ ]<br>Scare them for life, they will think you so far from humanity that they wouldn't even want to fight anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That works.</br>  Who's subbing it? Does anybody have a link for the first episode?  <br> I understand <br><br>Not sure you do.<br>The scene he's talking about actually DOES play the Ride of the Valkyries in the Battle of Italica arc in GATE books. <br>He's saying the anime better not remove it. <br><br>Hence your response "They are JSDF what did you expect?" doesn't make a lick of sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Some shit extreme-liberal nutcases saying Itami killing the soldier is murder and the anime is shit because of it in 2ch<br><br>As a liberal myself these people make me sick.</br></br>  <br>What else is 2ch saying about the episode? Did they find it good? Shit?</br>  <br>He was threatening a cute girl. If that's not neck breaking worthy I don't know what is.</br>  <br>Fine.<br>I understood the purpose.<br>However I'm talking out of my ass here, I don't read poorly translated LNs, I just watch poorly subbed anime and read poorly scanlated manga I have no idea what happens in this other than the premise.</br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to tell, too many people with political agenda shitting up the thread to really see normal reactions. It's basically like /a/ now, GATE just attracted fuckton of shitposters.</br>  <br>wait, is it me or does she suddenly looks just like the manga's character design with different clothes here.</br>  <br>Looks like crunchy has the first episode, so I'd imagine the usual suspects.</br>  I missed the stream, raw torrent when ?  <br>because the manga artist drew that one</br>  <br>It is. That's drawn by the manga artist, but using the anime design.</br>  <br> Spaniards <br>Fucking /ak/ scans.</br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br> Fuck, this really is really more appealing to me </br></br></br>  <br>oh, the first episode is up. Thanks.</br>  <br>2 hours till subbed then?</br>  I would say a handgun against a wyvern rider is a little outclassed. <br>Poor cop.</br>  <br>That was still a nice shot.</br>  <br>Police Officer A a hero. A HERO!</br>  <br>I guess a .38 Super would be able to penetrate it and it looks like one for me.</br>  It’s weird how his imagination isn’t animated, but completely realistic that a cell phone game isn’t. Cutting corners in the production is the name of the game here. At least when it’s not being insultingly redundant. In the first five minutes of the show, we have someone declare the protagonist to be an otaku, watch him on a train imagining himself playing an MMO and losing at it, and then after running into a pillar, so another person comes up, looks at his phone plastered with girly crap and goes basically “Ooh, you play otaku games too?” That was a third of the episode goddamned well spent. If you saw the animation in the promo, then great! You’ve seen about 50% of the animation in the episode. And then, everything just stopped for the second half. It already was moving at the speed of a dead cow, and somehow, despite a three month time jump, only just barely managed to reach the second sentence of the premise blurb.<br><br>Which isn’t to say that they didn’t manage to be utterly ridiculous with the visual direction while they were busy going absolutely nowhere and making a giant fuss about it. My favorite was how right in the middle of them trying to be all hardcore and bloody by having the protagonist deal a no quarter kill to a guy he already had subdued, an orc unveiled a truly terrifying attack, curling up into a ball like sonic the god damned hedgehog. That little splurge of half-effort quickly drained away again after barely a minute or two, leaving just CGI to fill in the role of “things moving on screen”. Between the stills, the speedlines, the awful picture-in-picture of absolutely nothing happening, this is not what one would call a visually appealing, visually adept show, or engaging episode in any way.</br></br>  But who was sub?

I can only speak from my point of view. <br><br>How long has he been around?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why aren't you following mimifag example and requesting your waifu right now? There's no consequence anyway</br></br>  <br>It looks like Saki's author.</br>  <br>My waifu doesn't have oldfag status yet. Maybe once she joins the over 300 club.</br>  <br>Two years here, he was around before me. I remember the day he made that reference. I told him it was cool. He seemed really excited about it, it was cute.<br><br>He kinda seems like his smile and optimism are gone these days.</br></br></br>  <br>His requests seem almost robotic. More like he is requesting out of habit more than anything. I'm sure he loves his waifu dearly but the honeymoon phase is long over for him.<br><br>Time does that to ya I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>You'd be pissy too if you were stuck with the same ugly skank for over 2 years too, mate.</br>  <br>Not very long compared to most oldfags.</br>  <br><br>Who is the longest running requester in the WWD? Not straight but consistently over the years? and for how long?</br></br>  <br>Mimibro.</br>  <br>Gotta be Akarifag or Mimifag.</br>  <br>Gwen lasted a long time until things got pretty bad, but probably Akari or Mimi, could be wrong.</br>  Looked up the thread of my first delivery just for shits and giggles.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/363805<wbr>78<br>We've changed so much.<br><br>If I had to guess I would say Akaribro and Mimibro.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  Quick!

We really need more lewds pics of her!</br>  <br>So request some!</br>  <br><br><br>oh, now stop</br></br></br>  <br>Got a giggle out of me.</br>  Requesting Akira from Yamato 2199 taking it right up the ass.  <br>I did! A couple of threads ago. Someone even suggested anal, which I'm more than ok with that.</br>  <br>Anal would be amazing for her. Was there not some anon who wanted her hooked up to a milking machine too?</br>  <br>cant get milk from her tits. only saline</br>  <br>Anything is possible in anime/manga land, my friend. You just gotta believe!</br>  <br>Implants do not remove the glands. It might hampen the flow and storage, sure, but it's still fine.</br>  It's the 3rd, at least text spoilers soon.  <br>eren dies on page 10</br>  <br><br>No one would care. <br><br>Maybe Mikasa will finally get some development though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Bert pull a Shinji?</br>  Bort a shit.  <br>Eren has much more Shinji character traits.</br>   It's still shit   <br>Eren will.</br>  Bert is love <br>Bert is live<br>Bert dick so big that it will take all the woman of humanity to lick it<br>Bert may have done wrong but his quietness makes me cum</br></br></br>  <br><br>Bert gets off to dead babies.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  LM WHEN  <br>I hope they have some screen time together this month.</br>  <br>I hope Levi fades into the background again. Mikasa already does that.</br>  <br>Hopefully</br>  <br> As long as they're in the background together I'm happy. </br>  <br>And I'm happy too by them fucking off because they're worst shingekis.</br>  <br><br> worst shingeki <br> not team "we did nothing wrong" </br></br></br>  <br>At least they're interesting and connected to some mysteries.</br>  <br>BRA are far superior to any Ackerman.</br>  <br>Kek. MT could easily answer everything about them.</br>  <br>No need for the butthurt Bertfag.</br>  <br>And LM can't answer anything.</br>  <br><br><br>Found the bertfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>More like found the butthurt ackershitfags.</br></br>  How is wallpaper even interesting? His character is so boring.  <br>It's true though. There is literally nothing interesting about LM.</br>  <br><br>There's no interesting character in this entire series besides troubles.</br></br>  <br>Levi is worse.</br>  <br>Why are you bringing up Levi? They're both the same amount of interesting.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>They're the only humans who can't be mindwiped. That must be relevant to the plot somehow.</br>  <br>Armin is interesting.</br>  <br>No, they're not the only ones.</br>  <br> Who is Bert and Reiner <br> They surpass all other characters.</br></br>  <br>They're the only ones we know of who are still alive.</br>  Is this the Yumikuri thread?  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>Bait.</br>  <br>There is no one who even wants to mind wipe the people inside the walls anymore or even has the ability to do it.</br>  <br> liking LM now is bait </br>  <br>Then why did Isayama waste time bringing it up? Why would he make two main characters immune to memory altering? We're only half way through. A lot could happen. Keep an open mind, anon.</br>  <br>It is because they're shit</br>  <br>Mikasa is wallpaper too.</br>  <br>It will be just as relevant as him making Mikasa react to the name Kenny Ackermann.</br>  <br>This show is terrible.</br>  <br>Kek u gay.</br>  <br><br>Everything is terrible.</br></br>  <br><br> inb4 Armin is a secret Ackerman <br><br> inb4 Ackerclan: the clan of manlets </br></br></br></br>  <br>Armin would be the only likeable Ackerman.</br>  Half the characters are wallpaper  <br>It was only relevant in the past. It's irrelevant for the future.</br>  <br>No actually I'm a 21 year old woman <br>and I like bug ducks like Berts<br>Small ducks like yours don't make me horny</br></br></br>  <br><br> Armin <br> likable <br><br>I'm an Arminfag and I know this can never be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you don;t mean Bert.</br>  Can any Ymirfag in rl confirm.<br>Would Ymir a manlet?</br>  <br>She did react, but she didn't know who the man was and had little information about him from the start. And it's not like she could've asked Levi about Kenny's surname because at he time he just found out himself. What else do you want from her? Mikasa and Kenny weren't closely related. It made more sense for Levi and Kenny to have screen time together because he was his uncle and knew him when he was a child.</br>  <br>Love me.</br>  <br>Whut? (Is it the crybaby tendencies?)</br>  <br><br>It's the &gt;he is inevitably going to become a power crazed dictator<br><br> And I can't wait </br></br></br></br>  <br>Noone likes a betafag. <br><br>Noone.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and the mind wipe thing will be just as relevant.</br>  <br><br>True. Unless his dad is Monkey Trouble, which would be interesting. <br><br>(pls happen)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's too smart to be an Ackermann.</br>  <br><br> Armin's dad <br> monkey troubles <br><br>This is far too amazing to ever happen.<br><br> same with Armin and Annie ever having a superpowered crazy baby </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe what you want, but it makes more sense if their immunity came into play later on. If you want to believe it's a useless development that will never be addressed again than go ahead.</br>  I hate Arminfags.  <br> superpowered <br>That's not how shifting works.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, since it was a just a side detail that was relevant in the past once.</br>  Christ can you even imagine?<br><br> Armin confronts MT <br> MT reveals himself to be Armin's daddy <br> "My son, you must join me, humanity is nothing but troubles" <br> "no dad, you are the troubles" <br> volume ends, Shingeki no Kyojin on 5 year hiatus </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When is season 2?</br>  <br>Was that supposed to be funny?</br>  <br><br> No it's super serious </br></br>  <br>Bertfag here.

The usual.</br>  <br>EH hand holding as the cover Isayama hinted it</br>  Why are these threads so bad holy shit. Where the fuck is my Frodo when I need one?  <br>The only thing thats bad is Frodo.</br>  Translation of Isayama's comment on the live action movie:<br><br> When I was composing the story of Titans eating humans as a 19 years old, I thought “I want to make the story in ways like the professional story-makers would do.”<br> However of course there was no such an opportunity for me. I conveyed what I had in my mind with my unskillfulness and created the manga called “Shingeki no Kyojin”.<br> Many years have passed since then. When I was notified with the news of producing a Snk film, once again it occurred to me that “Isn’t this a great opportunity to have the professionals make a story of Titans eating humans?”<br> Therefore I boldly proposed several ideas that are different from the original story by myself, such as “Please jump out of the frames of the original manga”, “Human beings live in high-rise buildings” and “The protagonist is Jean”, etc.<br><br> They were not accepted as I expected. But I did hope film can be made with a broad vision.<br><br> I was invited to watch the two episodes of film prior to anyone else.<br> The horror and tension of Titans was so amazing. Besides it, the film also expressed the loveliness of Titans. I was super excited!<br> To make a film version of a work, I think it shouldn’t be merely copying the original one but should set the goal as making an interesting work.<br><br> And I think it might have been achieved by this film.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. Good to know he enjoyed the movie.</br>  <br><br>What the hell?<br><br>When did the movie come out.<br>Where the fuck can i watch this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isayama got to watch before anybody else. He says he really liked it.</br>  <br>It's not out.</br>  <br>Annie &gt; Reiner &gt; Mikasa &gt; shit &gt; manlet &gt; Blort</br>  <br>It doesn't come out until August 1st. I think it's also premiering in LA a few days before Japan.</br>  <br>Of course he's going to say he likes the movie no matter what he really thought of it, it would be weird if he just went out and trashed it. That isn't to say he hated it, but you can't expect him to do anything but say he thought it was great.</br>  <br>So I assume Isayama prefers Jean as MC over Eren? kek</br>  <br><br><br>Why is Isayama such a selfish piece of shit.<br><br>If I was the director.<br>I'd just release it right now lmao.<br><br>I'm such a fucking saint holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He probably thinks anyone would be a better MC.</br>  <br>I still wonder how Jean MC would work, though. He's not a special snowflake with super powers after all.</br>  <br>Mikasa why aren't you my girlfriend yet?</br>  <br>Because muh Eren, duh.</br>  <br>She isn't into beastiality.</br>  <br>will mikasa's cuckening ever end?</br>  <br>I don't think so. For snk-kind of story to work out you need an MC who is both completely cluesless of what's going on and have him be a special snowflake with special powers that can form a big threat to the enemy side.</br>  <br><br>Who wouldn't want to be with me?<br><br>I'm so fucking handsome .<br>Just look at my smile lmao.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck those producers and the director. All I wanted was jean to be the protagonist. But like always they ignore Isayama ideas and make their own shit  <br>This is your last warning, horseman. Be quiet.</br>  <br>So Jean wouldn't be a good MC either.</br>  <br>Hehe.<br><br>Did you miss me?</br></br></br>  Why is Eren's characterization so different in the anime compared to the manga?  HEY.<br><br>Where the FUCK is everyone?</br></br>  <br>fuck that was him being nice and polite, the movies must fucking suck</br>  <br>Who knows. Maybe he really liked it.</br>  <br>You scared everyone away because you didn't shut up.</br>  <br>that sounded like grrm praising s3, except isayama didn't explicitly say but hey remember the books and the movies are way different like the books don't suck how many children did scarlet have let me count my money</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1l278xJaOcm</br>  <br>Stannisfags BTFO even harder in the finale</br>  <br>Look mikasafag I know you love Jean so stop acting all tsundare about it</br>  any spoilers yet mates?  <br>Wait for about 4days</br>  <br>Read the fucking thread. If there were spoilers yet, we'd be talking about them.</br>  <br>Yh their were spoilers but they got deleted <br>It showed hanji trying to create tanks</br></br>    <br>Is she holding a baby?</br>  <br>Is there already a trailer for part 2?</br>  <br>That's really creepy. Maybe I'd watch the movie for the titans.</br>  why do you guys think they added pic related in the anime?<br><br>maybe they could be related somehow?</br></br>  <br>foreshadowing erwin vs eren</br>  <br>To make Erwin look badass.</br>  <br>Just to make him look cool when he stood there while everyone else ran away. How would that even imply that they're related?</br>  <br>looks like she's reaching out to Erwin and she was just having flashbacks of her dad</br>  <br>kek so dumb</br>  <br>She wasn't reaching out to him. Eren ripped off her arm.</br>  <br><br>Not saying he's right, but that was some coincidence. There's also some pic with all the Erwin/Annie paralels in the manga lost in the archives.</br></br>  <br>It's because Erwin is stealing Annie's dad's advice from Annie</br>  <br>Why would I read the whole shitposting thread when I can simply ask? Shitposters are all around this thread so no point of reading...</br>  <br>Is that movie supposed to be horror?</br>  <br> these are the people that go on here </br>  <br>I want to kiss his nose.</br>  To all the faggots who say Erwin has no emotions, here you have Ono Daisuke who explains it for you deadbrain fags.<br>  After that, Ono’s thinking changed. Rather than a mysterious and cool person without any passion, he believes Erwin has so much emotion that it’s difficult for people to see it. “The amplitude of his emotions is so great that to those around him it looks as if the needle isn’t moving at all.” </br>  <br>So they're as delusional as us in the end.</br>  <br>A seiyuu's fanfiction to justify how emotionless he is isn't proof of anything,</br>  <br>Bert drawfag?<br><br><br>Milf-chan?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was talking about the recap movie, which is before the political arc in the manga where Erwin really showcases more emotion. He says it's Armin's words that helped him better understand and play Erwin.</br>  <br>Also, ErwL confirmed canon.<br>  The interviewer then asks Ono if his understanding of Erwin changed at all after portraying him in the Choice With No Regrets OAD. He suggests that understanding Levi is understanding about Erwin, too. “[ACWNR] is the story of why Levi joins the Survey Corps, so we don’t know yet about Erwin. Nonetheless, Levi is a person who becomes a significant part of Erwin’s flesh and blood, so learning about him became very rewarding [for me].” </br></br>  <br>I missed you Jean-kun. Take care.</br>  <br>The parallels are interesting but it doesn't mean they're related. They're just showcasing some of snk's themes.<br><br><br>Manlet pls. It just means Levi's a good gauge because his actions are an extension of Erwin's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still not more valid than anything you read here, it's his interpretation of Erwin's character.</br>  <br> Then why did Isayama waste time bringing it up? <br>Because it explains a lot of backstory. Theirs, the world's, etc. <br><br>I won't mind if it comes up later but if it doesn't there wasn't much wasted, it already served a purpose.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Soon. Mikasa will run to her oniichan to help her keep Eren from talking to Keith. In exchange he asks her to do some lewd things  like teeth brushing  </br>  <br>Long shot but I'm hoping for Historia's crowning ceremony, or Erengelion screaming as Erwin fires the signal flare.</br>  <br> The protagonist is Jean <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br>Aren't the seiyuus given more information? I remember Marina Inoue saying something about Armin.</br>  <br>Not really, unless they're friends with the author or the director, which doesn't apply to Ono's case.</br>  <br>Two of these are just rehashes of VNs. Is there a summary out for the third story?</br>  <br>Apparently Annie lost her ring during hand to hand combat and Mikasa is giving it back to her. They talk a lot afterwards, but I don't know any details about that.</br>  Anyone monitoring 2ch now that kansou is kill?  <br>Me.<br> <br><br> Implying <br>Post the raws if you're so sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. Anything interesting? Dreamfag arrive yet?</br>  <br>Even if the raws are the same, Ono and Kamiyan always cross-promote each other in every series because they're buddies. It's still not proof of anything.</br>  <br>Just riri talk on the fujos thread. And the spoiler thread is pretty slow. <br>Also a question, do dreamfag show up on the fujos or in the spoiler one? <br>I've never seen a post from him.</br></br></br>  <br>It still feels like a waste if two prominent characters have that ability and never use it. We could've learned about the memory altering and history without Levi and Mikasa being directly involved; that's why I believe it will become relevant later on.</br>  <br>That's good enough, anon. Thanks. It's too bad they cut Annie's scenes in the anime. Inserting them into the movie doesn't cut it, the anime will still be much more widely watched.</br>  <br>I'm watching.<br><br><br>Dreamanon is on a separate thread but the spoilers thread always discusses what he says right after.</br></br></br></br>  <br>See http://darlingpoppet.tumblr.com/pos<wbr>t/123024343374/highlights-from-snk-<wbr>seiyuu-interviews-ono-daisuke</wbr></wbr> <br>They give all their links.</br></br>  <br>Good, thanks.  Have a Bert </br>  <br>T-thanks.</br>  I can't decide if I want the people to start suffering from radiation poisoning from those glowing rocks or not. On one hand it'll be funny, on the other hand I'm not interested in the drama it'll bring, I'd rather focus on MT and BRA conflicts.<br><br><br>These ain't raws. I'm not doubt the translation though. No new information either.</br></br></br>  <br>Saw the twitter links and aside from some blurry kanjis the pics show nothing of the interviews. And since it's a tumblrfag who translated, I won't put much credit to it.</br>      <br><br>Believe what you want. I'm pretty sure she translated some chapters of chuugakkou and haven't heard anyone say her translations were biased.</br></br>  <br>I like this WWII style.</br>  <br>I can only see it being a plot point after a timeskip, or at least after they get back from the basement. I've always had the feeling that the scouting legion will fall hard. And besides the radiation they're already throwing people in concentration camps, taxing the aristocracy into poverty, controlling the press with an iron fist and put the walls into a constant state of Marshall law. There's going to be a rude awakening ahead.</br>    <br>Bert a cutest</br>  <br>I said I didn't doubt the translations. Or that's what I wanted to say at least, fucking typo. But anon was asking for raws. Those ain't raws.</br>  http://imgur.com/a/x61fU  <br>Why post this in every thread?</br>  <br>They've all been different ones.</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/x61fU <br><br> Like that three eyed rat creature from Futurama <br><br>Is that real or did the translator add that?<br><br>Also, where can I find the complete collection? I tried looking online but only the first three chapters of this manga are translated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks man.<br><br><br>You would know if you bothered to open the links.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I've always had the feeling that the scouting legion will fall hard <br>It's true that their position in now better than it ever was, which gives the feeling that it's going to be ripped from them soon. But<br><br>  they're already throwing people in concentration camps, taxing the aristocracy into poverty, controlling the press with an iron fist and put the walls into a constant state of Marshall law <br>This bait? They simply put people into prison who more than deserved it for murdering people and acting like shits. Those people abused the masses for god knows how long and can't be trusted to stay in positions of power. They're imposing heavy fines on aristocracy but they're fucking aristocracy, they can handle it, and they lighten the burden for the cooperative ones. They don't control the press, they encourage the press to report without handing them scripts. As for martial law, a 15-year old can't be expected to run the government by herself. The military being in charge is fine as long as they keep Zackly in check.<br><br>The walls are under much much better governance than we've ever seen. In fact it's fucking absurd how they managed to end the old regime with such minimal damage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They make some jokes more western-friendly.</br>  <br>I think the anon that shares the chapters bought the volumes. They're not translated anywhere so far.</br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br>Anyone got a compilation of all the imgur chapters?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I opened the first one.It was meh.</br>  <br>Erwin's only fault is not dealing with pic related, but does he even know?</br>  Is Frieda supposed to be based on the norse goddess Freyja?  <br>I like this spinoff but some chapters are indeed meh. The festival chapter was the only one I really liked.</br>  <br>Pixis knew.</br>  <br>Erwin knows now, perhaps not the specifics but he knows Scatley a shit. <br><br>Speaking of Erwin, he's not in charge of everything even if he did start all this shit. Pixis needs to take responsibility too. I don't like them just letting Zackley run wild with his art pieces. It's better to get rid of him soon, but so far he hasn't done anything drastic.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe his "art piece" will be drastic enough.  What could be worse than poop machine? </br>  <br>I think you should read this page again.<br><br> Political families and those related to them had their titles revoked and were sent to detention facilities  <br><br>This means that not only were the royalty and those who associated with them were out into these camps, but their FAMILIES and those LIGHTLY affiliated with them as well. This is no different from the internment of Japanese Americans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon its not like she's claiming the seiyuu said Erwin and Levi are totally into each other. Ewin has feelings and cares about others and Levi is an integral part of his life. nothing new.</br></br>  <br>See</br>  <br> Levi is a person who becomes a significant part of Erwin’s flesh and blood <br><br>So Levi Ackerman Jaeger Smith fucking confirmed?</br></br></br>  <br>that's how it should be  oh wait it's shonen <br><br><br>can you explain how it's different? I'm too dense</br></br></br></br>  <br>Levi is  Erwin's brother. </br>  <br><br> relying on CR translations for nuanced wording <br>Only raws can settle this.</br></br></br>  <br>I would like it for the Michael/Lucifer parallels</br>  <br>That anon is a retarded fujo who takes the translations too far. The interview itself gives nothing we didn't already know.</br>  <br>CR is the official tranlation though. It will not differ much from the raws.</br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br>Yeah, the same translations which have fucked up really simple shit and misplace word bubbles all the time.</br>  <br> 2 poop machines <br><br><br>fucking triple confirmed <br><br><br>It does seem like that, hopefully the camps aren't too bad, but who knows I bet Zachley's in charge</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> CR is the official tranlation <br>Kodansha is.

It just sucks ass.</br></br>  <br>Kind of refreshing to see someone who's this new amidst all these shitposters.</br>  <br>Yep.<br>Known for a while now.<br>I find more interesting that Historia is supposed to be a valkyrie.Chooser of the slain who choose who die in battle bringing them to Valhalla.<br><br>Pretty much the only thing missing is that they can be lovers of heroes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will happen sooner or later, friend.</br>  <br>Ymir better not die within 5 minutes of them meeting again.</br>  <br>I don't want either of them to die ;_;</br>  <br>Neither do I but they don't have Levi's cash cow immunity, you have to be prepared.</br>  <br>Sounds just like something Ymir would do.</br>  <br>Historia is based on valkyrie?</br>  <br>That's just a theory since Valkyries tend to have names that portray their roles.

But I think she doesn't have much else in common with them.</br>  I think Historia is also Freyja.  <br> Dat Eh? face <br>I think she is.</br></br>  <br>Thay his arm is going to go missing</br>  <br>Disgusting</br>   anime team removing most of his distinctive features to prettify Reiner <br>Sasuga.

She looks like a mouse and has freakishly huge eyes. I just don't understand.  <br>Also, she's a dwarf. 145 cm, are you fucking kidding me?</br>  <br>Some people like that.</br>  <br>Because Isayama said so.</br>  <br>I thought that was Zackley?</br>  I can't wait until Pigner is finally killed off. Just seeing his face makes me want to puke.  <br>Because she looks like your typical moeblob (huge eyes, innocent look) that nips like.</br>  <br>Maybe the facial expressions in that painting got mixed up.</br>  <br>Why do you hate Reiner?</br>  <br>Yeah, she's on the best way to be an official dwarf rather than being petite.<br> Dwarfism (UK: /ˈdwɔːfɪsəm/; US: /ˈdwɔrfɪzəm/) occurs when an individual person or animal is short in stature resulting from a medical condition caused by slow growth. In humans, dwarfism is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than 4 feet 10 inches (58 in; 147 cm) </br></br>  <br> Historia <br> Innocent </br></br>  <br>He's ugly, edgy and we're supposed to pity him for being retarded and a murderer and his fans are the worst.</br>  <br>She would be one if she was an adult but she's not. She's a teenager still growing.</br>  <br>I said that that's how she looks and that's considered attractive in nipland.</br>  <br>She's still 15 and could grow a few centimeters in the next years, also dwarfism isn't only about height but also things like malformed limbs, which Historia doesn't have. She's just very petite.</br>  <br>Then I suppose you also hate Annie and Bert since they're basically the same thing.</br>  <br> Innocent look. <br>At least read it properly.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, she needs to grow 2cm before adulthood.Even then, she'd still be borderline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a girl for ants.</br>  <br><br>Historia isn't going to grow much more, she only has a few months left before she reaches the maximum age of where women stop growing.</br></br>  <br> “The protagonist is Jean” <br> They were not accepted as I expected. <br><br>Thank god!</br></br></br></br>  <br>No she has 3 years. She could still grow by 18.</br>  <br>I do but Reiner is uglier than both combined and his psychological problems are too edgy and annoying. Bort and Annie are meh.</br>  <br>Eren pls.</br>  <br>I'm sorry you cannot comprehend true love.</br>  <br>i still can't believe shit like this exists<br> this space for rent </br></br>  <br> 18 <br>16 you mean, women don't grow when they're past that age.</br></br>  <br>You're a retard. I'm a girl and I kept growing till 20.</br>  <br>what the fuck are they eating Eren's intestines?</br>  <br>Reiner is better looking that Bort and Annie combined.</br>  <br>Not true. I grew an inch or so more by 18.</br>  <br>If you're half blind or retarded.</br>  <br> I'm a girl <br> implying there are girls on the internet </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>it's a range of course, the median/mean whatever is probably around 16 but a few years around 18? Definitely possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>American education, women can grow till they reach 18</br>  <br>It's the truth. Reiner is muscular. He has a manlier face than Bort which is why he attracts all the girls, especially Historia who had an obvious crush on him and even asked to touch his abs.</br>  <br>Well I kind of doubt Historia is going to come close to even average height since she probably got her dad's midget stature.</br>  <br> le meme wher girls dun exist <br>lel <br><br><br>he's not ugly but I wouldn't call him attractive either, he has this big bony face</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did I mention that his fans are retarded and delusional?</br>  <br>Fujo pls</br>  <br>I bet you're a manletwhale.</br>  <br>I find Reiner way more attractive than Bert.</br>  <br>Historia's father was a dwarf too. I don't think she'll grow much more.</br>  <br>They're both ugly but Reiner is ugly beyond imagination.</br>  <br>I'm a fan of a good character. Reiner is objectively better written than Bort and Annie combined. He has way more personality and is way more realistic than those two combined.</br>  <br>Ymirfag pls.</br>  <br>Frieda on the other hand looked average to tall.</br>  <br>Delusional and retarded. No wonder you like Reiner.</br>  <br>Reiner has a great personality, he would probably treat his girl like a princess and he's muscular and handsome.</br>  <br>Handsome.</br>    <br>Reiner isn't more realistic than anyone, he's one of the most unrealistic characters in SnK. It's one thing being guilty and another creating another personality because you killed people. It never happens in real life and if it ever does it's because of underlying brain deficiency.<br>How that's realistic to you I don't know. Le Reiner is a good character maymay should stop, it's pretentious and inaccurate.</br></br>  <br>You can't even prove me wrong. Mention one character that's better written than Reiner. <br><br> inb4 Jean, Armin, Historia <br>Jean is shit.<br><br>Historia is a cliche Mary Sue<br><br>Armin is an annoying plot device</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because of his anime appearance describtion in the guidebook that nips call him a gorilla.</br>  <br> It never happens in real life and if it ever does it's because of underlying brain deficiency. <br> It never happens in real life <br>Thanks for confirming that you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> Mention one character that's better written than Reiner. <br>Every single one. <br/></br></br>  <br>Why are you dissing Reiner's waifus Armin and Historia. What kind of Reinerfag are you? Probably a retard who pairs him with Blort I bet.</br>  <br>I was talking about your post in general, not if he was well written or not.</br>  <br>So you can't read, as expected from a Reinerfag.</br>  <br>I'm not fat and average height  ;_; <br><br><br>totally agree<br><br><br>Bort*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You proved nothing with that, Bortfag.<br><br><br>Reiner's waifu was Christa. Not the Hisubong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the one who can't even do some research, Bortfag.</br>  <br>Typical Pigfucker, can't wait until Reiner dies protecting Bort.</br>  <br>Oh please, Bort is the apex of boring. Reiner on the other hand is plain shit, and I proved that he's unrealistic. If you're that analblasted you can give me some reasons that show how realistic he is. I can't stand your pretentiousness.</br>  ITT: guess who the best girl is in a show you've never seen<br><br>I'm gonna go with second-to-the-right here</br></br>  Going to be watching this pretty soon. Gonna call that the blonde is best, because blondes are always best.  <br>Haven't seen it either, I assume Saemonza is best girl.</br>  <br> Thigh highs <br><br>She's the slutty one isn't she?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Both wrong<br>Correct answers: 1- far left, 2- hard to say as all girls are pretty great, not the blonde though</br></br></br>  <br>Acceptable answer but 3/5 girls are good. <br><br>Haha no.</br></br></br>    My  doujinshi  sources tell me that right is the best SAO girl.  Going by how hard she makes my dick, pic related  <br>She complains about not having a boyfriend.</br>    My 1/4th Brit blood compels me  <br>Tanned girl.<br>Every time.</br></br>  Never watched SW, but always loved her and her doujins anyway.<br><br><br>This, except best SZS is obviously Kafuka.</br></br></br>  Short haired girl next to the blonde loli ?<br>But I know that she can transform into a cat or something</br>  <br>Correct<br><br><br>Haven't seen it either, but I agree.<br><br><br>Actually is far left<br><br><br>Yep</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ, no</br>  <br>You're right, but her hair is only short in the later series.<br>Her long hair look was much better.<br><br>Changing hair styles is kind of a thing through out though, for every character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>It's pretty much a tie for kafuka and chiri for me. I didn't like chiri at first but she grew on me.</br>  <br>Actually it's second row.<br>Actually canon in-show.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>nope</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Catfags <br>Literally worse than  Nadeko .</br></br>  There's no best girl in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei<br>Kafuka ruined everything.</br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Nothing is worse than nadeko. Not even anticatfags</br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally the two worst.</br></br>  <br>At least nadeko is good for hatefucking.</br>  <br> Tanned <br>She's a spic. By which I mean probably an Indonesian or something.</br></br>  <br>The panzer IV is clearly the best girl, you mong. <br><br>You don't even need to watch the show to understand such a simple truth.</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, it's left.<br><br>The fluffiest one.<br><br><br>My god, why can no-one get over the GRC ending? It's obviously tacked on, with the same long-term consequence of the episodes where Chiri murders someone. SZS is full of generic foreshadowing, just so that they can do whatever they like, and people will go through it, see a pattern in the clouds, and say OMG 2DEEP.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Blue haired girl on the right?  <br> It's obviously tacked on <br>  SZS is full of generic foreshadowing <br>It's way too late to be searching all the hints up, but it was clearly planned, and anyone who says otherwise is in denial.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>That's a dude.</br>  <br>I'm gonna go with orange.</br>    <br>i'm gay now</br>  I guess the best girl is the long-haired blondie at the bottom?  Bottom middle.  It has to be ZR slut. I'll never watch it though because I got bored so quickly trying to read F/SN  <br><br>The only correct answer</br></br>  <br>Best girl is Reimu (red/white). But you shouldn't be deciding who the best girl is from an image with 6 characters when the series has over 100.<br><br><br>I've only watched the deen anime and that was so long ago that I've mostly forgotten it, but best girl is clearly Sakura. Unless you include prism ilya in which case it's ilya/kuro.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Not including prisma illya because I've seen both seasons and that's actually good</br>  <br>YES</br>  <br>I honestly think both her and Eriri are valid choices. Utahafags must have something wrong in the head.</br>  <br>Middle.<br><br><br>Girl to the right of Blonde.<br><br><br>Orange.<br><br><br>Back right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The girl with short brownish silver hair.  <br>You're spot on for Girls und Panzer. Yukari is good, but overrated.</br>  <br>Anything except green is acceptable.</br>  <br>What's wrong with green?</br>    <br>Yes, but shovel would also be acceptable.</br>  <br>Megane is never the best girl and always has the best chance of being worst girl.</br>  <br>Hairclip for sure. Willing to bet the blanket one in the front is /a/'s favourite though. Everyone loves a Tomoko clone.</br>  <br>I'll take the three on the left.</br>  <br>Not wrong. But be prepared to read through mountains of doujins to achieve something you can pretend is like having a real route.</br>  Never watched LL, but even I know Nico is clearly the best.  <br>Correct, although most people will tell you otherwise, Don't be fooled!</br>  <br>Maki has the best doujins so she's clearly the best.</br>  <br>Bullshit. I never watched LL either, but I know for a fact Maki is the best.</br>  <br>Ive never seen Love Live either but I like the gif of the girl shaking the maracas so yeah her</br>  <br>Are you me? I was in Japan recently and bought shitty noodles that featured the maracas-girl on the cover</br>  <br>Am I the only one who hates the anatomy of the girls in this show? They all look so bony and weird.</br>  There is one wrong answer.  <br>No, I also hate that design and can't fap to its fanservice.</br>  Probably second shortest girl with the dark hair?  <br>Far right was my favorite from the moment I saw the gif of her clicking her futuristic floating touchscreens with her butt cheeks.</br>  <br>No, she's shit.</br>  <br>Fuck.<br>Who's best girl then? Is it the tallest one?</br></br>  <br>I think entire world thought the same thing</br>  <br>She's pretty good. It's either her or the shortest.</br>  <br>Far right maybe?</br>  Okay people who still haven't watched Angel Beats<br><br>Pick</br></br>  <br>Two stick out for me.<br>Ponytail brunette up near the top, and white haired girl on the bottom.<br><br>Red head in top right is nice too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a bit too  normal </br>  <br>That's a normal choice.</br>    <br>holy fuck MC's hands are enormous</br>  <br>Literally a normalfag.</br>    <br>Deadpan blonde twintails.</br>  <br>All those webms of pink's determination to fist make me think she's the best.<br><br>I also like blue's outfit a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely the Red Ranger.</br>  <br>No, no, I bet red is genki girl and genki girls are always best.</br>  <br>But anon, there is no wrong answer.  Even though the right answer is Karin. </br>  I did read the manga, so for the three new girls... far left.  I love jacking off to this little slut so I just assume she's the best.  <br>But that's wrong.</br>  <br>1. Genki Girl<br>2. MC self-insert<br>3. Shrinking violent<br>4. Ara ara <br>5. Misato clone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pink  is the genki though, red is  tsundere </br>  <br>Oreimo's porn is fantastic.</br>  <br>Here it comes</br>  <br> red is   tsundere <br>I take back everything I said.</br></br>  <br>The girl hiding behind the guy in the middle, perhaps?</br>    going by this picture ... Mio v2.0.  <br>Shit taste anon. Oreimo's character designs are so awful, you might aswell be jacking it to the little sister from Arthur</br>  <br>You really shouldn't because she truly is the best. I don't even normally like tsudere but she just is.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't say normal!</br></br></br>  <br>Never forget their sacrifice /a/</br>  <br>She isn't in the picture.</br>  <br><br>In order,<br><br>Background girl, main girl, and the first character to  ;-; oh god sadness </br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a Suzuki fangirl.</br>  <br>Wrong, though she is best  boy .</br>  <br>Best girl, but every zetsubou girl is great; even Nietzsche</br>  <br>Meganekko is always best. I can't be wrong. Also best hair, cutest and best body.<br><br><br>I'm going for far left. Long black hair + hime cut FTW. Is she a delicious yandere like Ume?<br><br><br>Genki pinky, naturally.<br><br><br>Green. Nice and flat.<br><br><br>Spicy red for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> even Nietzsche </br>  Do you actually keep screencaps about shows you haven't seen?  <br>Only a few, and usually I don't save cast images like some people seem to.</br>  Who's it gonna be?  <br>The one on the right<br>I like sluts</br></br>  It's the short one in front, right?  <br>Impossible to tell without colour.</br>  <br>Spot on</br>  <br>Pink haired energetic girl is best. Middle row second person from the right.</br>  <br>Blonde one, because /a/ tells me so.</br>  <br>Tomboy is best girl <br><br> draws a girl <br> says it's a guy <br> somehow has the biggest breasts out of all 4 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Top right</br>  <br> &gt;draws a girl <br>That never happened.</br></br>  <br>Blue</br>  Which one /a/?  <br>Far right is lewd.</br>  What would S2 be about?  The imoutos spinoff.  <br>Did someone say FAT ASS?</br>  I didn't find GJ-bu very interesting or entertaining. There were a few amusing moments, but I wasn't really into it. I'm usually really into Slice of Life, but I don't understand what attracts people to this anime.  <br>Just more cute girls doing cute things to get the attention of a guy and therefore the audience. Yeah nothing special.</br>  <br>So it's Seinfeld except with teenage girls?</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Another thread? Damn.<br><br>Good Irohasu, my brother.<br><br> </br></br></br></br> </br></br>  I love Iroha  <br>I always thought that every Yahari thread was just Op posting this.</br>  It's not even saturday.  <br>When I'm the OP, I let people know.<br>I'm just autistic, sorry.</br></br>  <br>does anyone have photos of yahari novels on top of each other....??</br>  <br><br>This?</br></br>  <br>P2<br> Bought new clothes for the date, but didn´t take the labels off, so she can return it.after. <br> Her knee socks had hole, took out her sewing kit to fix it <br> Put a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Went to the library to return romance manga(s) she borrowed, saves money. <br> Came to the meeting spot early, take a extra look at her notepad, "things I want to know about senpai today". </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> opening up a second shitari thread </br></br>  That ending did not justify the 25 hour generals at all. Not by a long shot.  <br>At least there are only around 2-3 yahari threads in the catalogs currently. <br>It could be worse.</br></br>  So, why do they say Iroha is a contender? In the anime, Yukino and the other one are about to decide who wins.  <br> Yukino and the other one are about to decide who wins <br>8man is the one who decides it, not the girls.</br></br>  <br>Someone is mad that nobody cares about Fate´s third adaptation with generic MC anymore?</br>  <br>Not that...<br>Somthing like &lt;--------this <br>physical books on top of each other....</br></br></br>  I need more Haruno in my life  <br>Because she's made to look like a contender to keep her fans buying the books.</br>  <br>that guy was an animefag autist</br>  <br>Sucks to be him then.</br>  <br> Filename <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>yea this pls</br>  Guess we'll let this one die out. Iroha threads will still happen every saturday so it's fine.<br>See you guys on the other thread.</br>  <br><br> all genuine moments </br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  what is dead may never die  Can we get a compilation of all the copypastas this general created? Put it into a pastebin or something?  <br>My favorite one was the Does Yukino like 8man?<br>I would paste it if I had it</br></br>  <br>That's a very long compilation, nobody has the time to do it.</br>  What's the meaning of "Iroha or death"?  <br>"I am proud to be autistic"</br>  <br><br>same fag but still kek'd</br></br>   Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha!

She is unnecessary and irrelevant and should just die. <br>Why? Iroha is a side character. Complaining against her is like complaining against that Finn fujoshi or Saki.</br></br>    <br>i wish she would show expressions like that....</br>  <br>Side characters should stay out of the club room when they don't have problems. Iroha hangs around like she belongs there.</br>    <br>well mayb she did want to join but couldn't cuz she was already manager at football club and a seitou fucking kaichou!!!!</br>    <br>I think one of the reasons I like Iroha is because she inspires so much anger from faggots. It's hilarious. I think I'm German at heart.</br>  <br>Even if she wants to join, this is haremshit and she is interested in the bishounen character and not the main character. People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense like reading NTR manga/doujins.</br>      <br>It's not Iroha who inspires anger, it's Irohafags.<br><br>Most people don't mind her one bit, but the retards who constantly screech about her have driven the rest of the fanbase, including a significant portion of her own fags, up a wall.</br></br></br>      <br>You should be dumping in the other thread.

There's no way a volume can solve so many unresolved conflicts</br></br>  So I have these theories about Iroha an Yukino. <br><br>Iroha likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.<br><br>I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.<br><br>Does anyone have any theories on Yui?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ie why there won't be time to develop the romance if it does end. at best yukino and hikki's problems end up coinciding.<br><br>Hopeful for more though since vol 11 afterword suggests vol 12 is the climax, not the finale.</br></br></br>  <br> Watari won't follow Yomi's path and make Hachiman fal in love with Totsuka <br> "Ah, um, okay." <br> The end <br>Moreover, this is a light novel, even if it does conclude at twelve, expect asspulls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui is secretly a lesbian and only using 8man as a pretext to get closer to Yukino.</br>  <br>This is not a Fate thread.</br>  <br>Excuse me, Yui doesn't have any problem with a harem. Yukino will be her wife and 8man her mistress.</br>  Why are you Oregairufags still around? Your poor man's Haganai is over. <br><br>Totsuka will win, like Yukimura.</br></br>  <br>so its bisexual instead of lesbian. Sasuga Yuigahara-san.</br>  <br><br> 122,607 copies Vol.11  <br> 12k BD volume 1 <br> Ending at Vol. 12 <br><br>It's like you guys don't know how this industry works</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man her mistress </br>  <br>Abnormally shit taste.</br>  <br>No, I don't think you know. At best, the 13th novel is the final volume but purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes.</br>  Only way irohafags can stay relevant is spamming a thread everyday after the show ends. Pathetic.  <br>I don't know why there are so many people obsessed with their ship's more popular than others, it's a fucking taiwanese cartoon character's romance for fuck's sake; the fact that it came from Facebook isn't helping it either</br>  <br>Did they realize they are not /u/ enough to ship? Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right?</br>   have a 11/10 gorgeous long, black haired girl that loves you <br> have a very cute and very sweet girl who has a 10/10 body that loves you <br> they accept who you are <br> they are friends so no drama if you choose on over the other <br> people keep acting like this is a bad thing <br>8man has it made. There is no way this can go wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right? <br>As if people care<br><br>/u/fags secured their foothold in /a/, even more than /v/ did.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people like Yui? I'm honestly asking. Is it that she sympathizes with 8man? Her tits?  <br>Why would you dislike Yui?<br>No autism, no pretense, only lack of spine at worst.</br></br>  <br> Her tits? <br><br>you just answer it yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>dumb and easier to put the penis in  theoretically  if you were self-inserting</br>  <br>If there's someone who can fuck it up, it's 8man.</br>  <br>It's not that I dislike her. I just don't see much appeal in her aside from her ti- character design. But I see so many people praising her as best girl. Which confuses me despite me being aware of this board's shit taste.</br>  <br><br><br>i'm normally one for dfc i just like how genki she is</br></br></br>  <br> purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes. <br>You don't even know the exact terms of their agreement or the possibility of its extension. Saying that this ends at volume 12 is just dumb</br></br>  <br>That's why i asked the reason why their rank keep down though. Oh well i filtered most /u/ related thread anyway, it's amazing to see my catalog page looks so empty these days.</br>  <br><br>This is exactly how I feel except about Yukino.<br><br>She's just such a boring, derivative, generic character. It is utterly baffling to me that someone could  genuinely  prefer her to a more interesting girl like Iroha or even one of the side girls. And yet apparently she has multiple people who think she's the best girl. So fucking confusing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Yui is not a shit taste<br><br>Liking Whoruno on the other hand, is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel the same. Which is why I prefer Iroha and Sensei.</br>  <br>She is a good girl. She is more loving and accepting than most of the heroines I have seen in chinese cartoons. <br><br><br>The only way he can screw it up is by not making a decision or rejecting both in a hurtful manner.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is a side girl </br>  <br> le meme bait </br>    Well? No Yuiposting?<br>Are the YuiBros dead?</br>  <br>Don't know about the others but I became a Yuikinofag before S1 aired because of Yukino &amp; 8man's 'Hachiman points' banter in volume 4</br>  <br>Yes, I am alive. I might be the only one.</br>  <br>I have a feeling you were baiting, but I will bite.<br><br>Normally the strong, smart, independent girl like Yukino is my type of heroine (okay, the "strong" and "independent" parts are in question for now, but that was how she was in first half). Yui only has her genki character to go with - that was my impression on the first volume.<br><br>Eventually, though, seeing her continuously chase after 8man even with all the suffering she got just kind of moved me. Effort should be rewarded - that kind of feeling. Add in the revelations how she is kind to everyone, put a lot of effort into stabilizing the club, always gently &amp; lovingly support 8man and even willing to sacrifice her chance to help her friend and I jumped on her ship. How could anyone want such a sweet girl to suffer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm still here.</br></br></br>  <br>They were killed in the last thread</br>  <br>Sure thing m8, you keep believing that.</br>  <br>Still here.<br>Not going to fall for the low quality bait.</br></br>  <br>Speak and I shall heed the call.</br>  <br> all this normie bait <br><br>well at least Iroha is good for something</br></br></br>  Irohasu~   Yuifags <br><br> mature grown-up looking for a stable and peaceful relationship <br> sympathetic <br> pacifist - hence the least amount of shit posting <br> passive <br> attracted to a character for her personality rather than looks <br> in touch with their inner feeling - hence many Yuifags use art as a medium to express themselves.

Yet, as Hiratsuka told Hachiman<br> It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well. <br><br>Their friendship is debatable. If you want to firmly believe the themes of Oregairu, then their friendship will remain intact. If you want to opt for something realistic, then no.

When she uneasily removed her boots with her hands, I could tell the fineness of her calves through her tights. <br> I ended up directing my gaze towards her seemingly immature gestures. When our eyes met, she bended her head to side with a “What is it?” But there’s no way I could tell her that I was taken in her by the unbalanced qualities between her alluring charm and her childish behavior, so I shook my head and quietly handed her a racket. <br><br>While this is probably just a bait post, as expected of Satan, it's always nice getting a chance to quote this part. One of my personal favorites.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But where's the translation</br>  <br><br>Is it something I can only found by reading between the line?</br></br>  <br>He's still cynical, just understand there are real people underneath every façade</br>  <br>I'm an Irohafag and this is sadly kind of true.</br>  <br>It's been so long since I've read volume 10,5 that I almost forget that he pays an awful lot of attention to her.</br>  Daily reminder that if current Yukino doesn't win she'll probably enter full depression shutdown mode  <br>Blame Watari and his kouhai. 8man uses the same words on Iroha that Watari used to describe his kouhai's lips.<br>I really don't understand the point of all this red herring.</br></br>  <br> Red Herring <br>Gotta keep sales up</br></br>  <br>Padding.<br><br>Shit, I don't have anything else to write about, but I've gotta reach those 12 volumes somehow, here I'll introduce this random girl and make her appear to be a serious contender.</br></br></br>   それある！   <br>more like pic related</br>  <br>Ditto for me, I mostly just lurk around for the fanart and translations most of the time. Or quote specific parts of the novel that contradict whatever people say that's pretty blatantly wrong.<br><br><br>Not really, if that were the case then she would have had much more appearances in volume 10 and 11. Not to mention the fact that he didn't randomly introduce her, she was in the series since volume 6.5. <br><br>The bulk of her content was in Volume 9 and 10.5, and those don't exactly do much towards "padding" the series in all honesty.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  She returns          delicious meiko bullying<br>could have lasted more than a single chapter, but oh well</br>          Thanks for dump, OP!                  <br>Fin. Hopefully glorious koreanbro is lurking.</br>  <br>It's happening! The bullying is always a solution to everything!</br>  <br>OUR QUEEN IS BACK</br>   It's a Moeko/Meiko chapter <br>about goddamn time</br>  <br>ALL HAIL THE QUEEN <br><br>I NEVER BETRAYED YOU</br></br></br>  <br>now I want to see her kick Risa's ugly face.</br>  <br>the question is, what is she now?<br>old meiko and moeko will appear now and then, but mostly old meiko?<br>old meiko, moeko dead?<br>a new hybrid?</br></br></br></br>  ok, ok, as always, first things first.<br>last page of the chapter.<br>does it say anything about break next week or no?</br></br>  <br>It's because he pushed Mari isn't it?</br>  <br>I want to see how this turns out. Andre might straight up leave the other team unless risa lobotomized the motherfucker.</br>  <br>I'm fearing the answer is yes, but then she'd have hit shingo, not gakuto.<br><br><br>andre will definitely get confused, but I doubt he'll dump risa after their development</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping a hybrid where she's has more mild moments like her old loli self.</br>  <br>YES <br><br>SHE IS BACK.</br></br></br>  <br>Its been a running gag since the start that gakuto takes the abuse for someone elses wrong doing.</br>  <br>One more page.</br>  <br>I just hope she has some sort of gratefulness to the boys for awakening her</br>  <br>Meiko's presence is enough to snap andre back into his default self. Imagine what an actual hateful kick from Meiko would actually do. I like the Risa x Andre x Meiko subplots of this manga so much I want more  drama  on it</br>  <br>Chiyo is still the best girl. Prove me wrong. Oh you can't.</br>   wasting your talent drawing ecchi cocktease for teens instead porn <br><br>fucking terribe the manga</br></br>  <br>I think ideally andre should end with both.<br>it's obvious meiko would affect him now, but I hope it'll be more "he'll turn into a meek and weak drooling mess under her heel" and risa will withdraw/retire him from the battle and afterwards she'll try to work more with him, than andre just straight up abandoning risa.<br>the cuddling was too cute.<br>please don't kill it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her entire character proves you wrong. She essentially a bro/comic relief mascot character at this point.</br>  <br>FUCK YESSSSSSSSSSs</br>  <br> wasting <br> porn <br>The point of the manga has passed over your head, hasn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>still better than being a cunt</br>  <br>Manga is something like Blame! or Vinland Saga, this is just some SFW haremshit.</br>  <br> haremshit <br>You havent even read it and it shows. Don't you have new anime threads to be trolling?</br></br>  <br>If Andrenomics can be saved then there really is hope for Greece.</br>  <br>I don't want andre leaving anyone, I want it to keep being a background love triangle until Risa finds another fat guy with weird interests or something.</br>  <br>Hey if you want porn that looks like the Prison School guys art then you can just go to pandaland and find that one /ss/ doujin with notMeiko and notKiyoshi.</br>  <br> hope <br> greece </br></br>  <br>Please go away.</br>  <br> replying to butthurt Me and the Devil Blues fan </br>  <br>nah, andre adding more ladies to his domme harem is where it's at</br>  <br>Its really not even a triangle. Meiko hasnt shown affection to no one other than mari. Andre just loves her punishment more than anything and has had a rather good connection with risa.</br>  <br>OUR EMPRESS ACTUALLY RETURNED</br>  <br>Finally.<br>I hated Meiko at first but Moeko turned out to be the greater of two evils.</br></br>  <br>well, yeah, but unrequited love is applicable to Risa towards Andre, and Andre's to Meiko. It's still a triangle</br>  koreanbro where are you ;_;  <br>SHE'S BACK</br>  <br> 'tis lacking depth!! <br><br> 'tis lacking speed!! <br><br> Spread your leg properly!! <br><br> Is that all!! <br><br> Do it more seriously! *cough* <br><br> Sorry, I don't mean to blog, but I'm a bit fucked up tonight boys.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh yeah, this is kinda late but I don't think there have been any Prison School threads up since. Here's the cleaned up Hana pic. I had to have an anon from /w/ clean up the stuff on the right arm since i'm not good with mixing <br><br>Also thank god Meiko is back.</br></br>  <br>please, please, before everything else, does the last page say anything about a break next week?</br>  <br>Nope, all is good.</br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P3A<wbr>LwKeSEYs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>danke, koranbro-kun</br>  So did she react because Shingo pushed Mari?  <br>yeah<br> callbacks </br></br>  <br>nice<br>from which chapter is this?</br></br>  <br> Hweh~! Doing squats with such skimpy sports gear is too much~! <br><br> You've tried your best Meiko... If it's too much, let's stop for now! It's because the school festival of light is making you wear these clothes <br><br> No... No way, it hath not passed even one minute since we have begun <br><br> Even though you guys say you want to revert Meiko... you're too harsh <br><br> On top of that... Fix the way you address Meiko who is your upperclassman! <br><br> Nay, 'tis deliberate <br><br> At any rate! That's the end of it!! <br><br> Mmm.... Presdient! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So mean to bully that one girl ;_;  <br>It's from a magazine cover or something</br>  <br> Now that Andrei who has overcome his sole weakness that is the vice-president's photos, and has now has the overlooker that is Risa... <br><br> Is a being who repels every attack.. and is a being who has combined both sadism and masochism! <br><br> The one who can resist Andrei is... but the original vice-president of olden days...!! <br><br> The likelihood of the victory of the school festival of dark lies on the vice-president... in other words, on the the success of "Project F"! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mfw SHE'S BACK </br>  Thanks koreanbro.  <br>It's the battle of the dommes!</br>  <br> It's hot! <br><br> What are you doing? It's dangerous <br><br> As you can see.... It's fried chicken! (Karaage for you weebs) <br><br> Meiko has this much exposed skin! Do it at a greater distance away!! To begin with, fried chicken/karaage in such hot weather! <br><br> No! I must fry it a little bit closer... No, rather! Vice-president must fry it herself <br><br> I have heard from Shingo! That without listening to his advice, she fried chicken in such an exposed attire <br><br> So, by making fried chicken in such way... I was wondering whether she would not return to her past-self!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I WANT TO FUCK MEIKO IN THE ASS  <br> So, vice president, please eat this hot oden!* <br><br> Hweh~ <br><br> That's dangerous; she'll get burnt! Oden whilst frying chicken - it's too dangerous! <br><br> I heard it from Shingo! If we were to do this... <br><br> Hehehe... If we're on the topic of the vice president, it's the whip! *cough* <br><br> Now fling it around as much as you want, just like before *cough*-!! <br><br><br>*TN: Oden means fishcakes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiyoshi, I thought you were an assman all the way?</br>  <br> *TN </br>  <br><br>Ah. These two pages have made me realize why I liked the meek Meiko better. Her hair fringe was down.</br></br>  <br> Here! Vice president, take it without hesidation <br><br> Hweh hweh~ <br><br> Please giveth us thou whip! <br><br> So- Why is this!? I can see your chest <br><br> Kuku... <br><br> Kick away that kind of guy!! <br><br> Seeth this! Thou attention hath been fixated on the only the front! <br><br> *cough*... Her ass is also certainly under the influence of time?!  <br><br> Hurry up and hit glasses-shitter's ass with that whip!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Apologies, I've always strived to be a dank memestar. <br><br><br> Do it in moderation, you bastards! <br><br> Kuuuk!? <br><br> Stop it, your shameless acts! <br><br> Kuk!! <br><br> ... Aren't there any other methods? <br><br> There's no effect at all... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doing Doujinshi earns you less money though and what ever you create, you have to sell out of pocket for. Not to mention, that you don't earn any publicity for your work. <br><br>Look at long time Doujinshi authors like Kisaragi Gunma or NAPTA or Jin. At most it's a side thing you do in between your other real projects you can market for. Sure, living on pennies doing what you love might seem like a dream, but when you have no home of your own and kids to provide for, things change and you have to grow the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  I like Moeka better than Meiko on the fact that I want a woman to protect and care for.  <br>*tips* fedora</br>    <br>Mm~... Because we're currently at the stage where we're finding what's effective...<br><br> We have no choice but to try this and that... <br><br> So much for "this and that"; what you're doing is no more than sexual harassment! <br><br> Meiko... If it's tough you can stop...  <br><br> Yes... that is fine <br><br> The men are trying their best for the victory of the school festival of darkness...  <br><br> I must do my best as vice-president... <br><br> Vice-president is strong! <br><br> Right! We're proud of Meiko </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;wasting your talent drawing the thing you like the most drawing <br>The quility wouldn't be the same if he drew something else</br></br>  What the fuck  Thanks based Koreanbro  <br> Hey-! I've bought it- <br><br> Shingo... <br><br> Where have you been... We've tried all your plans <br><br> In front of the station... <br><br> For this! <br><br> What this... <br><br> It's root beer, a soft drink that Meiko likes <br><br> That's correct! While in prison, I had often run errands to go buy this <br><br> So! Vice-president, please drink this <br><br><br> Thank you~ You went all the way to the station for me... <br><br><br>Napata and Jin confirmed for god-tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this chapter maannnn</br>  <br> Hwe~~~~h!! <br><br> You idiot!! Did you come here shaking it!? <br><br> I am no idiot! I had anticipated for this! <br><br> If we bring to her mind that root-beer bukkake of that time... <br><br> Vice-president will surely scold me like that time!! <br><br> I'm really getting sick of Meiko's shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, oh, since you said that,who's koreanbro's best boy, best girl and wost boy, worst girl?</br>  I stopped following Prison School a while ago - can someone explain why The Vice Prez become moe?  <br> Project F <br>Why F?<br>I get that it's a parody about Revival of F but Meiko starts with M and I just don't see anything related to the letter F anywhere.</br></br></br>  <br> ... she's not coming back!! <br><br> Hweh~... <br><br> Huh...?  <br><br> It could've been that the quantity was too low... <br><br> Pwuaaah~!! <br><br> Stop it now!
