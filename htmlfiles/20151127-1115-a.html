I'm pretty sure he's still alive.</br>  <br>Those things do a suicide attack where they catapult the black bug from their eye to infect new hosts, her parents died in the crash and the bugs entered through their ears to take control of the corpses.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. I think that they couldn't touch her because of the white flowers that she have with her. I wonder if Kuro is going to defend her against them in the next chapter. Maybe my theory that Kuro killed her family wasn't wrong after all. I'm glad~</br>  Everyone is so soft.

Ichigo's powers have nothing to do with fire.

The first one was DBZ, and then they released some other manga which I've never even heard of which is only on its 9th chapter.</br>  Why are releases on friday now  <br>Something about raw providers getting rekt by police being the main issue.<br>This week also had Thanksgiving for Americans, which causes delays.</br></br>  Urahara/Yoruichi/Hirako/Love Bankais fucking when?  <br> Something about raw providers getting rekt by police being the main issue. <br>That was just WatermarkPanda.</br></br>  I read this shit since 2007 and still don't know when is the official release date in Japan.<br><br>When is it, anons? Friday?</br></br>  Is Vinland Saga good?  <br>Mondays apparently. We've been getting the actual chapter the week prior to it being for sale.</br>  <br>This week's chapter was released like a day ago now. MangaStream are late as fuck this week. It usually goes up some time in the afternoon (UTC).</br>  <br> It usually goes up some time in the afternoon (UTC). <br>On a Thursday, that is.</br></br>  <br><br>That paranormal magic fireman manga by the soul eater dude is 10/10.<br><br>Just saiyan</br></br></br></br>  I wonder what Askin and Gerard will turn into when they use their final form.  <br>What are you talking about.<br>This issue comes out Monday.</br></br>  <br><br>Askin will turn into a snake, M into a woman.</br></br>  <br>It is.<br>If you like something that advances on a kinda Berserk ~ HxH pace.</br></br>  <br>Gerard might turn into a Lion, and Askin into a Bull.<br>Would be a good reference to Cherubim.</br></br>  Mangastream have really fucking dropped the ball. In their bid to pick up all the semi-popular series that are being dropped left and right due to the raw provider busts they've forgotten to prioritize their two most popular series, Bleach and One Piece.<br><br>The flames are blue, so it's a consequence of his quincy power. Engetsu has minimal impact on the ability set of zangetsu.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think there was a color spread with the blue flames</br>  <br>It was from the official colored volumes. Also it's not the flame used to forge zangetsu either, that one was orange.</br>  Still no chapter?  <br><br>One Piece just came out on Mangastream. Bleach shouldn't be too far behind.</br></br>  <br>Most likely they'll hold on until its officially released in Japan (Monday) to avoid further issues with arrests (its easier to pin out a leaker in the production process before it hits shelves).<br><br>We usually got the leaks straight from the printing or packaging or shipping (people involved in those processes), thats why we got them on Wednesday or Thursday, we were actually ahead of Japan themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit it did.</br>  <br>It's can't wait for next chapter/10</br>  <br>Praise the gooks!<br><br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>561044</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>damn it kubo does it really take an entire chapter to do one attack?</br>  <br>HAAAAAAAA<br>FUCKING FINALLY<br>tip top kek a mirror was enough<br>at least it didn't involve her going Bankai or anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>goddam, most of the chapter for a flashback.</br>  <br>Mangareader just piggybacked on Mangastream One Piece release.<br><br>The motherfuckers know no shame, eh?</br></br></br>  <br> tip top kek a mirror was enough <br>http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w<wbr>iki/Mirror_Coat_%28move%29<br>Don't underestimate the power of Mirrors.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Are they gonna get together?</br>  <br> friday morning <br> still no chapter <br><br>The fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Nanao his niece or something?</br>  Did anyone think of Ganju when seeing Shunsui's brother? With the latest chapter he looks more and more to me like they share some genes.  <br>Based kubo for making the entire chapter a shitty flashback, though Lille got BTFOd.</br>  <br>He's still not dead.</br>  <br>I don't see him coming back after being scattered by the holy sword.</br>  <br>Apparently they are... but they don't seem to be having a problem with it</br>    <br>Hopefully it's just sameface.</br>  So did lille die the most cruel death in bleach? Firing your strongest attack and just having shit backfired on you and dying instantly.  <br>I don't think any death can top cruelty more than Szyael's,</br>  <br>What if it isn't? Noble families marry between each other.<br>Although that wouldn't really change anything in the story, except open possibility for even more nepotism.</br></br>  <br>Szayel isn't dead, he even appeared in the mayuri chapters earlier to taunt mayuri.</br>  <br>that was a hallucination</br>  <br>.......<br>you know that was his imagination, right/?</br></br>  http://readms.com/r/bleach/653/3080<wbr>/1<br><br>finally</br></br></wbr>  I don't know if this has been pointed out yet, but more nazi imagery in Bleach.  <br><br>How do you know? It's fucking mayuri. He could have removed szayel's poison and turned him in one of his arrancar. Or maybe he stole his soul or some shit and it leaked during the fight.</br></br>  <br>There's some Nazi imagery in the SR (such as uniforms and the army), but in this case I think its mostly germanic imagery (from around the time Yhwach was born), Nazis borrowed from that stuff because muh mysticism <br><br>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.co<wbr>m/originals/1b/e5/3b/1be53b1241b422<wbr>69691c27565abc581a.gif</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's also the Chi-Ro monogram of Christ</br>  This fight is fucking terrible. Even for a bleach standard  <br>Yup. Kyouraku must be the weakest captain ever with that useless Bankai of his. Shinji could probably beat him.</br>  <br> Ichigo's power is the power to grant others power <br> his symbol is an X <br>It has to be on purpose. Just how much planning has gone into this arc? Kubo doesn't joke around when he says that he's taking time off to do research.</br></br></br>  <br>Why couldn't Kubo decide on one symbol for the Quincy instead of using three?</br>  So, how will they prevent plot sword from being used in all other battles, Yhwach included?  <br><br>Kyorakus bankai one shots you but I guess it can't be helped if you have a spare head.</br></br>    <br>it took joint effort from Kyoraku and Nanao to take out Lille, and even that was a gamble. Yhwach is way stronger than that.</br>  <br>I troled you m8</br>  IT'S OUT  Do you think this super convenient god slaying paddle will ever be used again? Or will it be forgotten about.  <br>At last I truly see</br>  <br>It only works as pure reflector. It has no other use.<br><br>It won because the Trumpet was such a large scale attack. More likely YHVH won't be using anything of the sort because  Sharingan </br></br></br>  <br>It's evolving- 3, 5, 6-pointed star.</br>  nice watermark you got there  <br>Or also because he doesn't want to fucking destroy his kingdom</br>  <br>Ginjo and X-cution. <br>Ginjo is also part quincy who can give and take powers<br><br>KUUUBOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mangapanda has no shame in kinging like kong</br>  it does make sense that is the most effective against people who can not protect themselfs from their own powers.  <br>He has to be, or else the hollow powers would killed him long ago. But I doubt he's the power distro quincy, those are only born once every 200 years which means that Ginjo must be a lot older than he appears to be.</br>  How does Lille fire his trumpet power?<br><br>Blowing into his fingers like a kid? hahaha</br></br>  <br>Holy shit kubo is a fucking mastermind<br><br>Why did everyone doubt him and get trolled so hard? Did people actually believe nanao would beat lille on her own?</br></br></br>  <br>uwot<br>I don't understand this sentence</br></br>  <br>Why not? Haschvalth is more than 1000yo</br>  This chapter was pretty much garbage, more than ten years and Kubo still can't into pacing at all.<br>At least we got a good Kyoraku reaction image outta this.</br>  <br>Haschwalth is also dead and controls the other half of Yhwach's power.</br>  <br>Lille was fucking it around and he obviously did not care.<br><br>He also changed the landscape at will once he got on the throne, that's hardly a problem.</br></br></br>   theatre suicide scene 7 <br> trumpet attack from an angel <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seve<wbr>n_trumpets</wbr> <br><br>the madman did it again</br></br></br></br>  This was retarded. 100% typical kubo shite.  <br> Haschwalth is dead <br>Source on that?</br></br>  Well, whatever. Let's just get back to one of the other fights going on and hope they're more interesting.  <br>Inferred, but exaggerated to bring home the point.<br>Also extended lifespan and youth might be a consequence of having a high reiatsu. Urahara walks around in a gigai, yet he hasn't aged in the lst 110 years, unlike Isshin who just recently regained his powers.</br></br>  So lillie dies next chapter cause que the "villian has reached or is reaching final level mode and has to die now" trope  <br>Could be Engetsu. Isshin could do Getsuga as well, plus his sword was fire-based.</br>  <br>The seven-headed Beast from Revelations was Monster!Aizen. Kubo did it again</br>  <br>I think next chapter will switch immediately to Miracle<br><br>We have got 7 'The Theatre Suicide' chapters (just like 7 'Baby Hold Your Hand') and some extra 2~3 chapters before the long numbered ones which make each fitting for a volume, and I think that with this one the volume is complete.</br></br></br>  SHUNSUI'S BROTHER IS GINJO??  <br>Kubo is unsealing the Seven Seals<br><br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sev<wbr>en_seals</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>MY FUCKING SIDES<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</br></br></br></br></br>  i thought shunsui and ukitake were supposed to be the first graduates of yama's shinigami academy and first captains of the gotei 13<br>so how come shunsui's older brother is already a regular shinigami and there's no mention at all of the old "gang of thugs" days</br>  <br>How come ginjo is so weak? must have had shit genetics</br>  <br>He's saying that it's Barragan's fight all over again, when the power of the enemy is so great that even he can't protect himself from it.</br>  <br>Remember when Ginjo manifested wings of light?</br>  <br><br>That is almost completely wrong. Shunsui and Ukitake were the first Captains of the Gotei 13 that graduated through his academy. In other words, the previous Captains and Shinigami didn't go through his academy, since it didn't exist yet.</br></br>  <br> retcon <br> retcon <br> this is retcon <br> Kubo will give it to you, when you need to read along </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does kubo make hax villains and then have them beat them self? barragan, gremmy, and now lille.</br>  <br>I quite dont get it either, someone explain pls</br>  <br>And has an X-shaped medallion. <br>And manifests a zweihandler(like Haschwalt) from it. <br>Like a quincy</br></br></br>  <br>What makes you imply that its a regular shinigami? They already had black clothes when Yama was young.<br><br>And there's the implication of the tenderness of the wife making him better 'I've grown calm and content' 'mellowed into the old age' 'her kindness is finally beginning to show through me' that implies a lot that his personality used to be more aggressive.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it stated somewhere that the Gotei 13 existed prior to the academy? I thought they formed together after Yama, Unohana, and Kirinji decided to stop murdering everything.</br>  <br>OH MY FUCKING KUBO</br>  <br>I thought it was a christian cross</br>  <br><br>Well they were just "gotei" not "gotei 13". We know Unohana had subordinates from her flashback when fighting Zaraki, so it wasn't just captains.</br></br>  Wait, is he dead? Given what he said he seems to claim nothing can reflect his attack but then he seemingly dissolves. Dissolves because he is dead or dissolves because he is launching a new attack?  <br>Also there was the Genji School and they had already been using the black robes attire.</br>  <br>He's dead, he even said he's being "erased", and not killed. This is the 7th part of the fight too.</br>  <br>Because fuck you, shut up and eat Kubo's shit. You could spend hours analyzing timeline in Bleach and come up with 100 solutions but it still won't make sense. It's just like trying to figure out Harry Potter's currency, you just can't because author didn't bother to plan this shit earlier and it ended up being disorganized mess that contradicts itself.</br>  <br>They were the first captains that graduated from the academy. Shinigami existed before old man genocide created the academy, he and unohana were evidence of that. It's like the shinigami were a militia and establishing the academy was a means of making it professional</br>   enemy is defeated by a new ability that just happens to counter him entirely <br><br>yawn</br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  Can someone explain just exactly what Nanao's sword does? So seemingly it works on 'gods'? Just what exactly defines a god? And somehow this super op swords Shikai manages to completely destroy Lille? Seems like such as asspull.  Slow, but at least it's over.  What do you guys think Gilgamesh' bankai will be?  <br>It reflects god's power, so Lille basically killed himself with his own attack.<br>God in shinto is any spirit being worshiped, or I guess in Lille's case one that feels that way.</br></br>  <br><br><br> No mention of the "gang of thugs days" <br>Do they always have to mention it? And as  said, he himself says that 'I've grown calm and content' 'mellowed into the old age' 'her kindness is finally beginning to show through me' that implies a lot that his personality used to be more aggressive.<br><br> Brother is already a regular shinigami <br>There you go again making baseless assumptions. Is it because he was wearing black robes? As  shows, Yama was wearing them even 2000 years ago. And in the 'murderous thugs' times, even Unohana had underlings with black robes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>It's pretty simple, i don't know why you people have trouble understanding this.<br><br>Shinigami have existed for a long time.<br>At one point there was the "Gotei" which was a gang of murderous scumbags led by Yama, these are the guys that defeated Yhwach. <br>The Gotei had captains and normal Shinigami in it.<br>At one point after that Yama founded the Shinigami academy to train future Shinigami.<br>Shunsui and Ukitake were the first Captains that graduated from the academy.<br><br>The previous captains, in other words, the member of the original gotei, did not graduate from the academy, because it did not exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Just what exactly defines a god? <br>divine being with supa hax<br> Seems like such as asspull <br>it's bleach</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is that <br>is assuming using who knows what evidence that brother is 'a regular shinigami' and also that not mentioning the 'gang of thugs days' immediately implies they never happened.</br></br>  <br>Why? I have mixed feelings on this, no more of mutant chicken is a relief, but that means next chapter is propably about jobber squad.</br>  <br>lol<br><br>idiot</br></br></br>  <br> And somehow this super op swords Shikai <br>Shikai? Where?<br>That sword probably isn't even a zanpakuto.</br></br></br>  That was anticlimactic.  <br>At least that was a good fight.</br>  <br>Well she mentioned it was a sword, and i don't know there is a sword with special abilities other than a zanpakuto; and she never said bankai so it can't be bankai.</br>  <br><br> and i don't know there is a sword with special abilities other than a zanpakuto </br></br>   Trompete <br>Wait a second...god has a trumpet? Does he play?</br>  <br>A shikai is the manifestation of someone's powers on a zanpakuto, without a user the zanpakuto returns to the asauchi state.<br>That can't be a shikai, unless Kubo eventually pull some bullshit to justify it.</br></br>  <br>yes, he even has a band<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven<wbr>_trumpets</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I would love to hear them pla-<br> Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Christ Jesus, by John of Patmos <br>Never mind.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Given that its a zanpakuto if its not bankai then the only other logical conclusion would be shikai.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> We read that the wooden spanky paddle thingy redirects the power of a god to eight or five or six or four or how much ever points. Problem was chicken little is composed of Reishi so by dispelling that Reishi, chicken little simply gobbles it back up and viola, he's whole again. <br>The old incestuous Captain Commander who you know is gonna put the one two on Nanao's pooper and yuck guts at the first opportunity, stepped in and aided her, probably by rubbing her butt with his rod of inspiration, thereby aiding the younger lass to instead of directing the god power to the many points that I referred to previously, sent all that juice right back at the bird man.<br><br>seeing as how nothing can escape the divine trumpet blast of god, he, being more than something ultimately perished much like the Grim Reaper hollow dude did, and was also subject to the actuality of his very own power.<br><br>So all in all the story was more about Creepy uncle who is gonna stick it to the Niece, that is if he hadn't done so already, and his connections to her family and the probable romantic interludes, if there wasn't one initiated already, and other sexual hijinks the two of them will get up to now that chicken little got himself tuned into nuggets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyoukotsu was hiding the sword.</br>  <br><br>It's nothing to worry about anons, when the trumpet plays the dead in Christ will rise, however, the wicked (see: those of us who are unrepentent freaks), will most likely be long dead---gobbled up by birds.<br>and rightly so for if you're not for God, then you're for the devil and as you well know, it's better to fight for the light than to waddle in the dark, for the dark is full of terrors and eventualities you want nothing to do with, namely, oblivion and the abyss and eventually, forever destruction in fiery gehenna (see:Oblivion and complete obliteration of all presence, forever!)<br>We don't want that though we wanna live, we want to stand on the side of righteousness and beg and scream and plead for loving kindness strong enough so that we could break free of our own stupidity and make it in the door of light, just in time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I get you anon, it's just that long ago I abandoned any expectations I had for Bleach. I transcended beyond dissapointment, anger and disgust, just absorbing shit Kubo gives me every week, free of any negative feelings.</br>  <br>Well, Chicken Little hates sinful things.<br><br>I guess that Uncle having a butt-rub from the Niece was sinful enough for him heh.</br></br></br>  <br>And that sword is refered to as a zanpakutou</br>  <br>Kubo's telling the story of the Characters and by doing so he tends to add non consequential B.S. as a way to justify why the characters are the way they are.<br>That whole thing with bazz-b and pretty boy floyd was boring as crap though. would have preferred zombie girl and her love of molesting her zombies. or how Mayuri molest Nemu to get her regeneration going...would have loved to see how that process works.</br></br>  <br>That was poetic</br>  <br>Oh my was it ever! Captain Commander's gonna give her the old innie and outtie at the end of all this, mark my words.</br>  <br>That means one of them will die. That's the rule in Bleach</br>  So the Agnus is Yhwach?<br>And the four Horsemen/angels are the Elites?<br>The dead will rize after the Last Seventh Trumpet? Zanka no Tachi?</br></br>  <br>You can't say he tells the story of characters if he's not even consistent with it. Kurotsuchi being sadistic freak got swept under the rug and replaced with muh dedicated scientist. Kubo's main purpose is to make characters act cool and look cool, doesn't matter if that makes sense or not. If you think about it, Bleach is the most shounen out of all current shounen shit.</br>  <br><br> 7 trumpets <br> 4 elites <br> 1 Toofsy <br> 1 Ishida <br> 1 ????? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1 Ichigo<br><br>And the dead rising will be the RG<br>Also Monk is not dead, where the fuck is he?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1 Aizen to rule them all </br>  <br> 1 ichigo </br>  <br><br>poor lad<br>can't catch a breath<br>always part of somebody elses plan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It just feels wrong though, like it's filled with grammatical errors and the like. Can't remember half of the English Lessons I took in High school all those decades ago (see: 2 and change), but for the life of me that post, though intentionally off centre, just feels off grammatically.<br><br>It's like that time some years ago when I, the proper porn addict, had gotten into by this point gay porn because the regular porn bored the shit out of me. can't say exactly how i allowed myself to fall into said abysmal trap but one day i was in its thrall and for the briefest of moments (see: 1 year), I feared I was turning into a Falcon studio fluffer nutter. <br>So to test out and to see if I truly was on my way to the dark side of filth and abominations, I tried to bust a nut into my mouth....So there I was fapping away like a possessed sickened demon and then it happened, my seed was away and falling towards my face and in that very moment, I felt a clarity that can only be described as what people who has done dumb shit and is a moment away from oblivion (see: thrill seekers and dare devils and their moments of absolute perfect clarity before they died---and almost always in horrible ways on account that they were out of their bloody minds) feels. my stomach lurched and my mouth suddenly, as if it were possessed, closed tightly and just in the nick of time too. i was so sickened, i got up and vomited. i felt ashamed and sad for a very long time and then I realized. faggotry is not for me, and in fact, i only pitied those who were themselves trapped in that debased life style. but that entire affair though fascinating, was kinda off centre, as was my post just now.<br>of course i fap to fag, trap, straight, animal and all of the above, and when i'm done comming, i feel regret, and sadness and depression that last for a few hours. i'm depressed longer when i fap to gay, or loli or animal or real life rape though, so--- off centre, yeah?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying Ichigo will turn coat and join the quincy <br>The only way I'd see something like this happening is if someone had some bullshit mind control powers.</br></br></br>  <br>That feel when we will see a Ichigo vs Byakuya rematch.</br>  <br> Kubo has actually been doing his homework </br>  <br>No, not joining the quincy<br>Just being an unwitting trigger of the apocalypse (as one of the 7 trumpets)<br><br>In fact he already advanced the Quincy goals a lot by killing the Soul King, or the way I see it, breaking the crystal so Yhwhach could eat it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they should be able to break the rules and reconstitute the other, can't they? their Reishi gets recycled i know, but i think there should be a way to bring that consolidated parts there of which composes of whomever back from the void and use the very same reishi they were composed of as their receptacle.<br><br><br>i don't think it's impossible as it is forbidden to even try.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is ripping off Old Testament considered decication now? Not to mention he only referenced the most popular parts, 10 minutes on wikipedia and you have all the knowledge to create biblical villains Bleach style.</br>  <br> All those eyes <br>fuuuck trypophobia</br></br>  <br>I'm fucking blind, do you mean those on goat or there are other ones? Also wasn't goat a symbol of devil or is it a recent thing?</br>  <br>It's not a goat. It's a lamb</br>  <br>those on the goat<br>IDK there's some devil imagery with goats but according to  the multi-eye thing is the Agnus (a Lamb) as in Agnus Dei (Lamb of God).</br></br>  <br>whats with the horns?<br>Is that lamb good or evil?<br><br>horns are more like rams/goats</br></br></br></br>  Bleach is way better drunk&amp;/stoned<br>For some reason it flows really smooth and the art tasty minimalist dunno like a real punch and purpose to each frame<br>When you sober up and reread you get slightly annoyed by the pacing and lack of detail here and there its a stark contrast kind of feel</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with banging your niece anon?</br>  <br>Its taboo anon<br>but since its Japan, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</br></br>  <br><br>It's  sinful. </br></br>  If I see that bird one more time  <br> Fifth trumpet <br><br>The fifth trumpet sound is the "first Woe" of three. Before this trumpet sounds, an angel (translated eagle in some versions) appears, flying in mid-heaven, and warns, "Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"[10]<br><br>The fifth trumpet prompts a personified star to fall from heaven. The star is given the key to the bottomless pit. After opening it, the smoke that rises out, darkens the air and blocks the sunlight. Then from out of the smoke, the Locusts were unleashed. They were scorpion tailed warhorses, having a man's face with lion's teeth. Their hair was long like that of a woman's and flew with locust-like wings. They were crowned with golden crowns and protected with iron-like breastplates. They were commanded by their king, Abaddon, to torment any man who does not have the seal of God on their forehead, by using their scorpion-like tails. It was also made clear to them that they must not kill anyone during their five-month mission of torment.<br>Religion of Peace</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's gonna be cooked next chapter. I hope you brought your bib.</br>  <br>Hopefull we won't, unless Kubo wants us to feel bad fo McNuggetsa and gives us sobby backstory next chapter.</br>  <br>don't hate burd<br>burd is cool</br></br>  <br> Fifth <br> fifth division captain Aizen Sousuke  <br> was released from the bottomless pit <br><br>K-Kubo?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont know, he dont have an scorpion tail</br>  <br>Monster!Aizen<br>He was also the seven-headed Beast</br></br>  <br>Askin and Gerrard are left. Who will be the bull an who the griffin?</br>  <br>I'd say Gerard is more fitting for a bull.</br>  <br> Hitler called Himmler's mystical and pseudoreligious interests "nonsense".[210] Himmler was not a member of Hitler's inner circle; the two men were not very close, and rarely saw each other socially.[211][201] Himmler socialised almost exclusively with other members of the SS.[212] <br>It's debatable whether or not you could really call that Nazi imagery when Hitler rejected it as nonsense.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. This was such an anti-climactic end to the fight.<br><br> Oh, you reflected my attack. Guess I'll just crumble away now or something... <br><br>This was probably the worst fight in the series to date.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He could have removed szayel's poison and turned him in one of his arrancar <br>Igoring that it was really bloody obviously an imagination:<br>Mayuri despised Szayel utterly. No way he would have brought him back.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than all the fire and brimstone priests.</br>  <br>I think it was more than a hallucination too. I reckon he's taking in brains or something and sticking them onto his own to expand his intellect. So Szayel is like a slave processor<br><br>I think more will be revealed with Nemu's brain later.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Seven Seals too</br></br>  so I was thinking about Aizen's bankai and this image came to mind. He said he would eat Ichigo, right? Can we assume that his bankai consists of absorbing enemies?<br><br>It would explain his monstrous aura, as commented by many shinigami and hollows. If he "ate" many strong enemies until then he would have their combined strength.<br><br>Yumichika has a similar shikai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was going to do the same thing Yhwach did to the SK-absorb him. <br><br>Or he had a hard on for Strawberry boy.<br><br>Who knows</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if it's seeing into the future? That's how come he can keikaku so well</br>  <br>that means aizen had quincy powers after being transformed by the magic stone.<br>which may be the reason his sword dissolved. seems plausible, I like it</br></br>  <br>He was made part quincy by the dragon ball. He even had Vollständig-like transformation. <br>The ball healed him from Ichigo's point blank GT in a very Blut-esque manner</br></br>  Update version?  <br>There 2as one on Lab's site</br>  <br>is it bad that i kind of like the bottom version? <br>Not defending kubo's laziness but in that panel specifically the empty background gives the feeling that nothing else matters to them at that moment except their fight</br></br>  <br>kubo pls</br>  <br> JeeEEeeeEEEeeeeEEEEsus christ <br>always gets me</br></br>  <br>Tater Tots was really<br>fucking<br>creepy</br></br></br>  <br>when i see it i was like "marilyn manson?"</br>    <br>I'm honestly expecting either mind control, future sight, or a reset button for his Bankai.<br><br><br>But nothing happened this chapter.<br><br><br>Didn't the site go down? Haven't been on it in a year or so though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chart went rather shit ever since at least Grimmjow. But that's more Kubos fault</br>  <br>except we found out her sword is basically Wobbafett</br>  <br>It's totally overshadowed by Kubos bad writing though.</br>  <br>We knew this last chapter. The only thing that happened was that we saw the sword do the thing that it was said to do.</br>  Wait so since ninja loli doesn't have to hide the sword anymore, does that mean she disappears?  <br>Do you have the version which isn't for ants?</br>   Trompete   <br>presumably not, she probably had other functions beside hiding the sword.<br><br>Like, where would Shunsui hide his sake bottles if she is gone?</br></br></br>  <br>different one <br>http://i.imgur.com/jZ3qzlO.jpg</br></br>  <br> post for ants <br><br>gtfo</br></br></br>  BIRD NO.

It's still the same size, anon.</br>  <br>idiot you still can barely read it even if you do that. you fucking autistic retarded piece of fuck</br>  <br>It's hidden inside the chair. That's why he so vehemently refuse to give Yhwach his chair.</br>  <br> check the filename idiots <br><br>wow how much of an autistic faggot are you? it's the same size you mongoloid.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean he did take like a 7 month vacation last year to do research before the arc started</br>  <br>It was his honeymoon</br>  <br>Did someone say reset button?</br>  <br>Owl is ded</br>  <br>Lille should've been the bull. Just imagine Yhwach prepping the black bull.</br>  <br>/pol/ pls</br>  This was the worst fight in a long time but I'm glad it's finally fucking over and we'll move along. God, Kubo really fucked up Shunsui by giving him such a boring ridiculous fight like this.  <br>All of the sternritters are elites you turd, and incredibly overpowered. So except more of them to be beaten by asspulls.</br>  <br>But Lille was allegedly the strongest.</br>  <br>Only until we get another "I've been holding back my true power/form" moment</br>  <br>No that's haschwalt.</br>  <br>I meant from Yhwach's bodyguards.

JESUS CHRIST, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAACE?"</br></br>  <br>First guess would be a sort of murder suicide, but that's just my mind, I'm sure Horikoshi isn't that morbid.</br>  <br><br>Sick blog, where do I subscribe?</br></br>  <br><br>She kind of looks like a kid version of Midnight, doesn't she?</br></br>  <br>Man, she's a psychopath.</br>  <br>Kill him and take his place, duh.<br>Not like she really could, she's retarded and Stain is at least intelligent.</br></br>  <br> Midnight used to be unpopular <br> on every date she ever got, the guys fell asleep </br></br>  <br><br>Give me 3000 reddit karma upboats and I will email you the subscription link.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134030192 <br><br>Have you even seen the rest of /a/?</br></br>  God, I hope they don't fuck up the VA for Endeavour. We need someone who can nail this scene.  <br>Was he voiced in the vomic? I never actually listened to those.</br>  <br>Nah. The vomic covered only the first chapter.</br>  <br> She became super-lewd as a consequence of living like a NEET, still has the same poor social skills despite being a sex icon  <br> This is why she's still single at 30+ despite having the body of a goddess. </br></br>  <br><br>How about you McFucking kill yourself instead? :^)</br></br>  <br><br>I want Ikeda Narushi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134030250 <br><br>That's not the end of the first chapter...</br></br>  <br>Shame, I didn't realize that. Oh well, I've heard good things about the up and coming voice actors so far. They got the guy that voiced Accelerator in Index to voice Bakugo.</br>  <br>It all makes sense. Do you think she was always voluptuous though, or if she got some enhancements after becoming a heroine?</br>  <br><br>Nah dude. Best part that always replays in my mind is the first time Midoriya punched anything. His first Smash.</br></br>  <br>She had her nipples removed to appeal to the PG audience.</br>  <br><br>Are you upset?</br></br>  <br>For me, the whole Deku vs. Todoroki fight. Shit was hype.</br>  <br>Jouji Nakata would nail this,</br>  <br><br>It's a result of her NEET diet. Her corset covers the fact that she has a bit of a belly too.<br><br><br><br>This was actually addressed, she wears a thin skintight leotard under the leather parts of her outfit and it's flesh-colored.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a bit of a belly too <br>She wears the corset at home?</br></br>  <br>It being an ultra thin body suit actually hides her bulging nipples?</br>  <br>Ahh, right. I remember that was a big theory for awhile, and finally got showed off during the fight with Mineta.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134030250 <br><br><br><br>For me, it's the moment when Midoriya judo-flips Kacchan and the entirety of their fight after that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That part was pretty good, but that whole scene posted earlier with Endeavor made me feel absolutely nothing, quite honestly. His design is good, but his character just feels like a tired cliché. I have zero interest or hype for him.</br></br>  <br>Pasties</br>  <br><br><br> Implying she has nipples </br></br></br>  Now Bleach is out in gooks. BnHA when?  <br> Bleach still getting early scans </br>  <br><br>Here's proof on the leotard thing earlier than the Mineta fight.<br><br><br><br>That's a pretty baggy sweater, enough to hide a little bit of pudge.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are some powers you guys would like to see come up next? Personally, I'd love to see some sort of flesh control/shaping power, Alex Mercer style. <br>Also, have some fun with this.<br>http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Special:Random</wbr></br></br></br>  How do you see the schedule in ishuhui? I'm in mobile. OP is out.  <br>Woops, didn't mean to quote!</br>  <br><br>A different sort of superspeed+lightning power, where the user can turn into a bolt of lightning and move in a straight line at the normal speed of lightning, but only when they're in motion.</br></br>  Well, Manga Umaru started uploading Jump scans, but MHA is one of the last series that they do.<br>Ishuhui uploaded One Piece, but that was in response to MangaStream, because as they said, they don't want to lose views to English scans. They probably won't be uploading anything else for a while.</br>  <br>No, you dont.</br>  assuming Toga and Stain have similar powers,<br>when they bite each other at the same time what would happen?<br>  Toga is such a weird name; it's a piece of cloth you wear over a tunic  <br>  why would you call your girl like that?  </br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the moment Bakugou realizes he can't just fuck with Deku anymore and his resultant rage attack is fantastic, but I also thought it had the best of Iida we've seen so far.</br></br>  <br>Her first name is Himiko.</br>  <br>I remember that /tg/ request. It was a good request.<br><br>As for the question, I'd like something really wacky and out-there again. Something like Tape's tape elbows. A quirk that seems ridiculous at first, but actually quite versatile when applied correctly.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming, giving the emphasis on bloodletting when describing her crimes, she has some sort of blood control/vampiric power. You'll notice, she's always got a bit of a focus on her mouth whenever she's shown off.</br>  <br>yes, I accept this as my headcanon<br>Kayama used to be exactly like Tomoko growing up<br><br>what eyecolor does midnight have anyways?</br></br></br></br>  Midnight/Mineta doujins when?  <br>Midnight and Mount Lady domming Mineta, please.</br>  <br>I DON'T want a literal spider-man joke. It's been done too many times.<br><br>I would like to see a top-tier telepath or psychic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone who can spawn lots of tiny little buggers that work as a swarm and then zerg-rush people. Like a swarm of locust type of deal.</br>  I think Toga Himiko's quirk is controlling blood inside the victim, like Katara's blood magic and maybe she is able to move it out of the body through cuts.  <br>So menagerie from the elite with a dash of the darkness, from, well, the darkness?</br>  <br>I have no idea what any of those are. I'm just thinking of a swarm of locust that would attack people and eat them up like regular locust do to plants.</br>  <br><br> They bite each other <br> Togo can't move <br> neither can Stain <br> it's a draw <br>most boring fight in the history of boring fights</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget how Ash and that Samurai dude used two Megapods that just kept hardening?</br>  <br>Menagerie summons little things to do that (see her arm) can fly and modify herself (better hearing, seeing etc...).<br><br>The darkness is basically spawning monster, plus tentacles. But only in the dark. You also die if you impregnate a women and you get it once you're 18. It's the edgelord power.</br></br></br>  http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>561062</wbr>    <br>No Mina, I won't lick the dog shit off your shoes.</br>  <br>Thank you Ochako for appearing at the right moment</br>  <br>At last.

I just read Ryuguden yesterday.</br>  <br>Well...how is that any different from Tsuyu?</br>  The chinks released Gintama.

Their main weakness is probably looking delicious, in Japan.</br></br>  <br>  four legs, two vaginas  <br><br><br>I didn't think he meant it like that<br>crazy villain shows up and talks about his edge, <br>I thought he was just bluffing or something<br><br><br>the commercialization of Che.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why are korean scans so ugly  TLfag?

He wasn't planning on going on a date.<br><br>The only thing he had on his pocket was his father.</br></br></br>  <br> use his father's hand to keep Deku's neck squeezed <br> meanwhile, buy two cans of tea in a vending machine <br>There, was that too hard?<br>Just because you're a villain doesn't mean you have to be a dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like fucking pottery</br>  <br>Did you even notice the Invisible Girl in the right?</br>  <br>Shit, now I can see her.</br>  <br>That would defeat the purpose of her Quirk, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>qt</br>  <br> shark teeth <br> dem ears <br>It's like she's an agent sent by the government to tease my cock</br></br></br>  <br> He can see now, brothers!! He's cured!! </br>  <br><br>How does he draw them just as thick enough? Does Horikoshi have a degree in artistic dick pleasuring pedagogics?</br></br>  <br> Does Horikoshi have a degree in artistic dick pleasuring pedagogics? <br><br>More like a doctorate.</br></br></br>  <br>He likes them healthy chicks.</br>  Anyone else got the feeling that this chapter could probably be more fiting in a seinen rather than in a shonen?  <br>thick high test</br>  If I didn't know anything about the series before looking at the Korean scans, I'd think the chapter was about Deku being tricked by a pedophile.  <br>That's it! Horikoshi made a deal with God or the Devil. If he can even make side characters into such Best Girl material something has to be off!</br>  <br> implying it isnt </br>  <br>You make deals with the Devil. Gods don't give you anything unless you're their bastard.</br>  <br>Horikoshi is trying to re-enact the history of American comics by progressing from Golden Age through Silver Age to the Dark Age. <br><br>Coming soon in Boku no Hero Academia: government conspiracies, dead hookers, someone gets shot in the spine and become paraplegic, and one of the boys gets retconned as gay.</br></br></br>  <br>It's his quirk.<br><br><br>That was basically it.<br><br><br>He will be moved to Jump Square in no time, don't worry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NOW I really really want to see him free again!</br>  <br> Stain is on the loose <br> Hey dude, cool Hero-Killer costume! Can I take a picture with you? <br>He didn't ask for this.</br></br></br>  <br>same as kubo right?</br>  <br>More like he just doesn't give a single fuck anymore.</br>  <br>What happened to Kubo? I never read Bleach.</br>  <br>Also the people who buys the weekly issues.</br>  Chinks released HQ. WT is next and hopefully BnHA after that.    <br> and one of the boys gets retconned as gay. <br>"Bobby, you're gay" has got to be one of the worst pages in history</br></br>  <br> Gods don't give you anything unless you're their bastard. <br>And even then, you'll usually get the short end of the stick somehow.</br></br>  So can we expect great things from Handyman? Like, the cavalcade of crooks he carouses with will change, but he'll remain Deku's arch nemesis?  <br>Dat healty invisible tighs</br>  <br>He will kill All Might in the future. Is there something bigger he could achieve?</br>  <br>I don't even read cape comics and I think it's ridiculous on just about every level.</br>  <br>Not really. Shounen does''t have to be dumb and childish, just because most of it is.</br>  <br>Bigger than killing a dying man? Yes. Killing Deku too, so the OfA is no longer passed on.</br>  <br> I have to deal with Bendis bullshit even on /a/ </br>  <br>No one except for a handful of people know that All Might is a dying man, even Deku doesn't know that he will be gone one day. <br>And Shigaraki probably doesn't know that Deku is the next OFA successor.</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're on /a/. Everyone is gay here.</br>  <br>her jugs used to be bigger :(</br>  <br>But All for One user might know.</br>  <br>It's clearly implied he knows in the viz translation of the previous chapter though</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Already on this, but how much people, do you think, on this thread also read DC and Marvel superheroes comics?<br><br>Do you guys think that the average BnHA 4chan reader know something about cape comics?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to read Spiderman as a kid, that's Marvel.

He touched Eraserhead's elbow we know that.

IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!</br>  <br>i think this guy will drive even faster this week. God I can't wait to see his reaction and read all his rap friends dis him in the comments</br>   caesar will join guys hur dur <br><br>he fucked up a country and maybe he escaped<br><br>hur dur</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit it's real</br>  <br> he fucked up a country <br>No he didn't, it was just his weapon that Jack used. He should have been on Punk Hazard during this time.</br></br>  <br>that doesnt make sense since ninokuni was used live on den den mushi for showcase to the world, so kaido nor jack could have got their hands on that weapon by the time, i will asume the country was fucked up when the swirllhats arrived with caesar</br>  That has to be Absalam  If Kanjuro isnt a secret agent who lead Kaido's men to Zou<br><br>I'll eat my fucking hat</br></br>  <br> ni no kuni  <br><br>kek desu senpai</br></br></br>  ayy yo duke looks fly as fuck  <br> mad scientist gas-man Caesar Clown has only made one gas-based weapon in his life <br>The country was fucked up over 2 weeks ago, it happened well before the Curlyhats got there.</br></br>  <br> ninokuni </br>   Sicilian <br> shishirion <br><br>not nakama material, too much of a Vista clone but cool anyway</br></br></br>  Heh, so was Absalom a Mink?  <br> shishi lion <br>ODAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br>  <br> Jack the Drought <br> anything he touches dries up <br><br>Is Oda powering up Zoans by giving them elemental abilities? I guess Marco was ahead of the curve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's definitely cool but I don't like how skinny he looks</br>  <br>No, we saw a picture of Absalom as a kid. He worked at a circus. Also, his muzzle has stitch marks from where it's sewed on and he even says his body was modified by Hogback.</br>  <br>That or maybe his special move is to suck up water with his trunk and shoot out a high pressure blast of water?</br>  <br>it's just an epithet, man</br>  <br>No, he just has a Leopards Face attached on him</br>  <br>He looks like a furry Auron.  And I love it. </br>  <br>The spoiler provider earlier indicated that "drought" was more metaphorical as any area Jack passes through gets destroyed. Niggerstream could just be niggering.</br>  <br>My guess is he's supposed to be Aramis. Could be Athos though</br>  <br>wanda a cute</br>  <br>Lion swordsman looks 1000 times more badass than this old dog.</br>  Jack has Horns and a fur (hair?) on his mammoth back that looks similar to Kaido  <br>You prefer fat amorphous blobs with tiny legs which are most of Oda's characters?</br>  <br>If he causes mass death because he's a violent asshole, "drought" wouldn't be the best natural disaster to label him as.</br>  I found the design of the mammoth to be not very intimidating but the ruthlessness Oda gave him in this chapter blew away my doubts as to his cruelty  <br>well considering he's based off a lion he's pretty skinny</br>  <br> "drought" wouldn't be the best natural disaster to label him as. <br>Kanjuro's epithet makes no sense either, don't get hung up on this shit</br></br>  <br> fur (hair?) <br>It's a black feather coat. Notice how Sheepshead wears one too. Kaido himself does too. <br> How was Rocinante linked with Kaido? </br></br></br>  <br>nah duke's a pimp</br>    Guys I don't think it was Ceasar who rekt the country. May just be a weapon he created. Remember that he worked with Doflamingo to make weapons to sell.<br><br>Like that Axoloth poison shit was an experiment for a weapon so there's no doubt that he could make other strong one.<br><br>This is why everybody wants the Ceasar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is luffy doing with his arms</br>  Jack can probably go to the hybrid form and maybe an awakened one.<br><br>People concerned about his looks are retarded.<br><br>Cp9 would be even worse if always in beast mode.</br></br></br></br>  Top kek   can't even beat some furries <br><br>Kek. Jake is a fucking fodder.</br></br>  <br> I'm more concerned about his shitty fucking hair than his mammoth form.</br>  <br>True, it looks like the stuff Doflamingo and Brorazon wore.</br>  <br>When's usopps girl gonna get preggers?</br>  <br>yah it's the bowl cut that throws me off</br>  <br>When he comes back.</br>  So the cat-looking girl is named Gin Rummy then? There goes my hoping of Gin's return.  <br><br>I bet he looks like shit in humanform kek<br>And btw: Where is his fucking steel jaw?</br></br></br>  <br>dude his dick skin canonically shifted to his nose in the womb, he doesn't have the stopping power for penetration.<br><br>The shotas are gonna run a train on that puss while he's out there ridin rubber</br></br></br>  <br>I love her Eyes</br>  <br>He put it when   Sanji broke his jaw  </br>  Who is Sanji?  Goda's foreshadowing in action yet again.  <br>Shit.</br>  <br>even sheepheads belt on luffy, and has the little monkey on it too</br>  Why is luffy's bounty so low? He had all those achievements like "the first to attack/penetrate/whatever" and made the marines look like total baffoons at every turn yet Ace still had way more  <br><br>Time to go through every single color picture he's ever made and figure out the entire story</br></br>  <br> the translator's note is still there on panda </br>  Where tbe fuck is Sanji?  <br> Strawhats as cavemen running away from a mammoth <br><br> I suppose all the other colorspreads with the strawhats as knights and samurai are also foreshadowing future arc. It's depressing considering how many idiots from apforums or reddit post in this thread you can't even tell if this is bait.</br></br></br>  I just reached  I wanna live!  for the first time in the anime.  <br>kek</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't get it. Panda and stream? What's the joke?</br>  <br><br>holy shit this is fucking comedy gold. How have I never seen this guy's videos before?</br></br>    How long until we see the Catviper and the nocturnal minks? Last chapter it said it was getting dark didn't it?<br><br><br> I suppose all the other colorspreads with the strawhats as knights and samurai are also foreshadowing future arc <br>Well this one is potentially foreshadowing the final crewmates. Luffy is wearing the kimono with a blue shark on it with water (Jinbei), Zoro is wearing one with an orange fox on fire (Foxfire Kinemon) and Sanji's one has a green bird flying on it (Monet perhaps).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga be flippin his shit this week family</br>  <br> What's the joke? <br>Banter from Mangastream about being first.</br></br>  <br>what's with niggers obsessing over Japanese comics</br>  <br>i thought he kinda looked like this guy</br>  <br> She got slippers on and its cold <br> Big MAHMAH </br></br>  So Pleasures are the fodder human army and Gifters are the ones with imperfect zoans or something?  <br>jack is weeble's alternate personality confirmed</br>  <br>Jack's hair seriously distracting.</br>  Yo where's my nigga Raizou<br><br>I assume he's gotta be hiding somewhere on the island so Kinemon can get his peace of mind unless Oda wants to drag this Wano mystery on for 3 more years</br></br>  <br>Probably hiding in a similar manner to how Kanjuro was.</br>  <br> Raizou gets to Zou just as the crew is about to set sail </br>  I wonder how is Oda is going to distribute the fights with the Calamities, one for Sanji, Zoro and Law maybe?  <br>Zoro confirmed to be the one to fight Jack</br>  <br>Well Zoro usually always fights the right hand man, so I guess so.</br>  <br>law is still there?</br>  <br>yeah he does, but since Law is around, it could also be him.</br>  <br><br>Plot twist:  Sanji has already taken out Jack </br></br>  <br> Kaido <br>Luffy, Moriah and maybe Law<br> Jack and other 2 calamities <br>Probably Zoro for Jack, Sanji and Jinbei for the other 2.<br> Drake <br>I'm really not sure about Drake, unless he himself is one of them which I'm hoping. He's probably Zoro/Luffy level so I wont match him yet.<br><br><br>But that was Fujitora.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like how Jack doesn't give a shit and just fuck everything. Marines, Minks, whatever but I hope he isn't really the right hand because if he struggled against the Minks then meh.  So Caesar actually saved them right?<br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>But he didnt struggle against the minks, he just had to leave to get doffy. Sheepshead and his useless bunch of fodder and half zoan freaks struggled against the minks.</br>  I see the chapter is up on MS. Any idea when the .zip will be up on sekrit club?  I don't even think it's a secret anymore; I've seen it posted on fucking reddit of all places.   <br>He didn't struggle against the minks though.</br>  <br><br>Except he did as the minks had the upper-hand</br></br>  <br>Probably meant they had the home-ground advantage, but still lost anyway.</br>  Jack(mammoth) looks much bigger than Drake(t-rex)  <br> Aren't all three calamities on the same position though? I'd take that "right hand man" with a grain of salt considering niggerstream have previously fucked up translations.</br>  I wonder if there will be a Typhoon.  <br>the fuck when did the minks have an upper hand, beside that one panel they're wrecking them in every page</br>  What if Drake is one of the calamities? It would make sense for all 3 to be ancient zoans.  <br>how about that panel when Wanda says: we he had the upper hand?</br>  <br><br>Read the fucking chapter.</br></br>  <br>Last panel if not for Caesar's poison gas weapon the Minks would have won. <br>Jack looks to be a fodder unless he can go truly Mammoth and be of Pica's size.</br></br>  <br>Drake's T-rex form is over 24ft tall. Probably around the same size.<br><br><br>I'd say it's like the Monster trio under Kaido, like with the SHs, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily 100% equal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean by go truly mammoth? Jack was in his full-mammoth form this chapter.</br>  <br><br><br>oh shit there was another page. well fuck me, i'm a faggot speedreader</br></br></br>  <br> Drake/Jack/??? <br> Kaido's top 3 fighters are all ancient zoan users <br><br>I love this sort of theme.<br><br> Inb4 Ancient Zoan Human: Model Neanderthal with retard strength </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Zou is quite a large mammoth so maybe Jack's awakened fruit would make him comparable</br>   minks <br>  ancient zoans <br>  mythical zoans <br>  SMILEs <br><br> These future arcs are gonna be a furry holocaust tbqh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah fuck it I just made it myself.  How do I upload </br>  <br>Again, Jack left and had to bust Doffy out. They didnt have the upper hand against Jack, they had the upper hand against his underlings. Probably due to the homeland advantage, thick forests, and all the stuff unique to Zou.<br>Jack couldve probably razed the entire country to the ground if he had the time, but instead he had to let fodder do the job and the fodder just are jobbers.</br></br>  <br>  Probably due to the homeland advantage, thick forests <br> couldve probably razed the entire country to the ground if he had the time <br><br><br> American logic </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Again, Jack left and had to bust Doffy out. They didnt have the upper hand against Jack, they had the upper hand against his underlings <br>where do you get this from? <br>Jack attacked Zou 6 days before doffy was defeated.</br></br></br>  <br>Zou is an elephant<br><br><br> tfw I said like 2 years ago when we found out Drake was under Kaido that the top subordinates might be ancient zoans and have their own factions. </br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;(Monet perhaps) <br><br>STOP</br></br></br>  <br>It's logic like that they used to win in Vietnam, boy.</br>  <br> while Raizou was hiding he got hit with the poison gas and now he's dying in a bush somewhere <br><br>RIP</br></br></br>  <br>She was a good candidate before all the shitposting began.</br>  <br>Jack might have not wanted to waste time and so he used Caesar's weapon or was forced to given the strength of the enemy along with Doffy being captured. There's definitely more to the Mammoth.</br>  <br> So are you saying that it only took Drake 2 years to become one of Kaido's strongest and most trusted men? That seems a bit ridiculous really,Kaido has been a Yonko for quite a while i doubt he would entrust someone with such a high position unless they have been with him since the start.</br>  <br>No she fucking wasn't, she was complicit in giving narcotics to children<br><br>AND she's fucking dead</br></br></br>  <br>he's keeping them folded behind his head</br>  <br>Monet was a faggot</br>  I don't think it's fair to say that Jack is weak for losing to the Minks in combat and having to use the gas weapon to win. What other crew we have seen before could have wiped the Mink country? I can only think about Whitebeard's main crew and this only a fraction of Kaido's men.  <br>So, this chapter basically confirms that Sanji is keeping Caesar somewhere, right?</br>  <br> Jack is weak for losing to the Minks <br><br>Where do you people get this from? He completely wrecked them in the chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing says Jack was losing to the minks. He beat the shit out of the Duke.</br>  <br>Drake was a Supernova, and two years is a long time. The Strawhats were only together for like six months before the timeskip.</br>  <br>A country where even the kids are warriors sure is not that easy to beat yo unut</br>  <br>Oh hey, I remember those mountains.<br><br>I suppose Drake will be showing up soon and we'll eventually find out what happened with Caribou and what relevance his knowledge of Shirahoshi will have.</br></br></br>  <br>Ace was offered the position of second fleet commander from WB in less than 2 years.</br>  <br> mountains <br>Buildings.</br></br>  I still dont get why no one seems to give a rats ass about Sanji. I mean, I am not complaining but still. Seems kinda weird.  <br>Maybe it's not about trust with Kaidou and instead it's about strength. If he turns out to be a traitor then that will only interest Kaidou more and it gives him something to do since he can't kill himself.</br>  <br>his forearms are folded in, hands netted together, giving a little headrest. It's to show he's at ease<br><br>Can't read it but I'm pretty certain he's saying he's going to hunt down Jack to kick his ass. No scared reaction from Franky Robin or Zoro.</br></br></br>  <br>he left a note</br>    Am I the only who's kinda turned off by all the minks<br>Like shit there's a fuckton of weird animals now and it's frustrating desu I don't wanna drop the series at all but these animals are disgusting</br>  Not once in the summary did it say jack was Kaido's right hand man.<br><br>niggerstream gonna nigger.</br></br>  <br> green bird <br> not blue pheasant <br>you chose the wrong bird, senpai</br></br></br>  <br> (Monet perhaps) <br>Hooray</br></br>  <br>Stop right there.</br>  <br>  What other crew we have seen before could have wiped the Mink country? <br> I can only think about Whitebeard's <br><br> Where the fuck are you even pulling this from, we know literally nothing about the average mink's strength nor about their strongest fighters.<br><br> The random Mink could probably be fodder to Usopp while Inuarashi could be monster trio at best, right now we have no fucking idea. We also have no idea wether or not Jack really lost to the minks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't wait to see how Nekomamushi looks like, Inuarashi looks pretty badass   tfw Mammoth Mann uses his trunk to smash the navy ships and free Doffy <br>Thanks you based Mammoth Mann</br>  <br> No catgirl princess <br><br>Why live.</br></br></br>  <br> Just because the position was available at that time and because he was Roger's son and Whitebeard realised he had huge potential.</br>  I want to fuck Ginrummy  <br>It's out man. No need to guess.</br>  <br>i think you're on to something</br>  <br>kind of agree but duke and lion are dope tho</br>  <br><br>I thought it was pretty clear Lola was related to Big Mom, no?</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HQo<wbr>RXhS7vlU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No.</br>  How will they find the ninja, if even Kaido's right man bugchasers couldn't find him? And what will happen to samurais when they reach the top of Zoo? Will they get executed?  <br>why you got slippers on it's cold<br><br>NIGGA GON' BE WILDIN'</br></br></br>  <br>i still think so.</br>  The Minks are really unlucky and don't really fit into the story. They just got rekt because of Kaido and Wano whereabouts.<br><br>Indirect victims.</br></br>  <br>His commentary on passing women is better than his commentary on the chapter.</br>  not gonna lie<br>that chapter was bad, first bad one of Zou <br>Mainly because I'm not interested in being introduced to so many minks.</br></br>  <br>He's from Queens.</br>  <br>It was very good.</br>  <br>That's in New Amsterdam, yes?</br>  <br> Am I the only who's kinda turned off by all the minks <br>yes, now drop it</br></br>    <br>Yeah not a ton happened after the flashback was over<br>The duke does seem pretty badass though</br></br>  <br> something is bad because it doesn't cater to your interests <br>I see.</br></br>  <br>Nah, this style is just a fashion trend in New World for retards - like the mullet in the 90's</br>  <br>that's how art tends to work yeah</br>  <br>here come the "waaah I don't care about sidecharacters" faggots again</br>  <br>But there's a difference between "it's bad" and "I don't like it". People can like bad things and dislike good things.</br>  <br><br> Jack only shown clearly in Mammoth form <br> human form still not fully shown <br><br>Jack is definitely someone we already know.</br></br></br></br></br>  wait wasn't the poison gas Ceasar made were all destroyed? Or did Donflamingo sell some poison gas to Kaidou as well?  <br>Let's post when we've seen him so far and make guesses.</br>  <br>Morgan?</br>  <br><br>I would argue that in this case it's bad if you take into consideration the bigger picture, i.e. the fact that we still have no idea what's going on in this arc, that we were introduced to too many new characters in the previous one, and that we are dealing with events that have already been resolved in the past.<br><br>Jack has a cool design, but we already know he was defeated. We already know about Ceasar's abilities, and it comes to no surprise that they were used as a weapon by a guy that's been buying weapons from him. Etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks a little like Morgan, but I have high doubts.</br>  <br>You don't make a very compelling argument. By your logic we should only read the first couple of chapters of every arc and then declare them shit because they don't clearly explain everything.</br>  <br>Drake brought Caribou to Jack.<br><br>Caribou was mistaken for a rebel that gave Kaido's factory a lot of trouble so I can see Drake getting a promotion.<br><br>If Drake can awaken his fruit he's probably insane.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still can't get over 'war for hegemony' fucking niggastreams</br>  <br>Drake brought Caribou to Kaido you mean.</br>  <br>It could be but we'll have to see Jack's human design first to know if he's the father</br>  <br><br>I didn't say it was shit, just bad in comparison to other recent Zou/Dressrosa chapters. We still don't know what the Strawhats plan on doing, they still haven't been reunited, and we still don't know what the consequences of Jack's actions are. All of this will be explained in due time, but this arc really ought to be sweet and short to contrast with the bloated mess that was Dressrosa.</br></br>  <br> Not everyimportant new world player needs to be a known character you retard, plus he looks nothing like any previous known characters fuck off back to reddit with your shitty fucking headcannon speculations you piece of shit.</br>  <br> bloated mess <br>I just got and read volume 76 today. I can't take opinions like that seriously.</br></br>  <br>fucking forneverworld stfu, your fucking logic is completely retarded<br><br>Action is in the chapter -&gt; chapter is good<br>Exposition chapter -&gt; bad chapter<br><br>you fucking retards should think before you write your shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he looks nothing like <br>But that's the thing, apart from his mammoth form, we've only seen an obscured view of a face that resembled Morgan's. I don't think a guy like him could have made it this far, but going by looks alone, there is a point to be made.</br></br>  <br>yes sorry</br>  <br><br>Why indeed</br></br>  <br><br>Chill out nigger, I was just thinking that it was suspicious how the human form has been shrouded in shadow so far but the Mammoth form is shown clearly, which suggests there may be something to hide regarding his identity.</br></br>  It's out on niggastream  <br>  swirly eyebrows<br><br>Jack is Sanji's father </br></br> </br>  <br>Has been for several hours now anon.</br>  USOPPS BOUNTY IS 500 FUCKING MILLION.<br><br>500 FUCKING MILLION.<br><br>500.

Minks are strong, but not Zoro levels of strong.</br></br>  <br> mink infants literally knocked out underlings of Jack <br>This should tell you at least a bit -if you are not a retard what I doubt tbqh- about the strength of the more experienced adult Minks and Inuarashi their strongest fighter</br></br>  So Jack is the Sanji of Kaido's crew, always jobbing against everyone.  I'm still confident enough Jack will pose a significative threat to Luffy and co sooner or later. It was a bit disappointing to know the minks were winning until he pulled out the weapon but nevertheless, the guy is batshit insane. He attacked 4 marine ships that were helding Doflamingo with Tsuru, Fuji and fucking Sengoku on it. I still believe in him.<br><br> it's part of my hope that most of the other crews stop being depicted as 'weak' aside from their captains. If that happens with Kaidou and Big Mom as well I'm gonna be very mad. </br></br>  <br> implying Zoro was serious <br>He was just going to shoo the animal with blunt side of his blade.</br></br>  <br>guys guys listen<br>listen to me guys what if<br>guys what if<br>guys<br>what if the mask that jack is wearing is only a gas mask because of caesar's weapon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Where do all these retards come from?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Didn't he use Ceasar gas? <br>Yes, so what? If the Minks are hiding in the forest and their secret hideouts you gas them out, valid strategy.<br><br> Did he get Doffy back? <br>We dont know, Wanda wasnt mentioning Doffy. That together with the fact that he most likely didnt die makes me think he actually accomplished the mission.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>release day anon.<br><br> just kidding. That's the usual people who hang out in OP threads. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Jack is just a fucking barbarian who doesn't give a fuck.<br><br>Reminder that even his subordinate knew Jack had no chance of saving Doflamingo. That was a warning from one of his underlings who obviously does know the extent of his strength.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Go back to AP forums</br></br>  <br>or the three admirals<br><br>or the 4 yonkous<br><br>having the same title means shit. Of course there will be strongest and weakest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You are the one who should go back, in fatc allt he people that usually post in this thread never only come to /a/ for this genera so that anon is right.<br><br> These threads are cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what Kaidou did to get someone like that to submit to his will<br><br>Jack doesn't seem like the type to take orders or admit someone is stronger than him.</br></br></br>  <br>y-you too<br><br><br>Kaidou is either that scary or Jack thinks that's the only yonkou under which he can cause a shit ton of ruckus with no remorse or troubles. Basically, he may think that being the underling of someone as strong and ferocious as Kaido gives him a 'do whatever the fuck you want' pass</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've been here since the days when One Piece threads didn't last longer than an hour because of wiki spam while you were still roleplaying in gaia online back then.

Since people pull the Skypiea-Zou analogy all the time, will the final battle on Zou be fought to prevent the final boss from killing Zou, the same way Enel was defeated to prevent the destruction of Skypiea?  <br> Yes we expected him to do at least that considering that he's hyped as one of the strongest fighters in a Yonko's crew while in the grand scheme of things Zou is a completely irrelevant island in the grand scheme of things.</br>  <br>I think one guy from bleach.</br>  <br>I am guessing bepo was born off island right? if he was born on Zou shouldn't he have been stronger than law pretimeskip with all the mink sheningan powers</br>  <br> No you stupid motherfucker it was stated that Zou is his home island and it's not like all the minks sre supernova level jesus christ how stupid are you?</br>  strange, panda===stream  <br><br>I don't know<br><br>I thought Mythological would be more appropriate seeing as they come with special abilities beyond just transforming. <br><br>We haven't seen anything from drake other than turning into a T-rex<br><br>But we know that Buddha had shockwaves and marco had the regeneration of the phoenix.<br><br> no gojira zoan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not as dumb as to have stupid as my only pejorative. <br><br>The supernovas pre-timeskip were shit.

Jack is/was strong but still not Yonko-level.

It's been a fun ride everyone.<br><br><br>I'm still trying to find a sense to the birdcage.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Which gives more credence to Doflamingo's ability with birdcage.

He had 3 decades to train his powers and hone them to perfection and even awakened his fruit. <br><br><br>I know but a lot of people were dismissing his power after Luffy beat him then right after we are seeing how useful and rare having a skill that can ravage an entire city-state is.<br><br>Doflamingo has no need for weapons like Caesar's gas with his bird cage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still trying to find a sense to the birdcage. <br>Why?</br></br>  Apparently, Usopp is the least fuckable strawhat.<br><br>Why is that?</br></br>  Fuck I'm so hyped about Kaidou. I fucking love his type of crew.<br><br>Fucking lunatics with amazing stregth that are lead by an even crazier and stronger captain.<br><br>Can't wait to see more of the 4 Yonkou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is not hot because he has a long nose and weird lips</br>  <br>If inuarashi is stronger than doffy, the birdcage isn't that much of a problem.</br>  <br>But he has ass waiting for him as soon as he gets back home.</br>  <br>It's a strange thing to say, but right now I'm hyped as fuck for Big Mom. She seems so unrealistically silly in her motives that it somehow makes her scary as fuck. I just hope she doesn't have a crew of jobbers</br>  <br>Plus, Doffy kinda makes good use of a low tier DF.</br>  <br>I'm waiting to see how someone of her size fights. Until now the only comparable fighters have been giants who just kind of swing their weapons and grunt. I'm hoping she actually jumps around and engages in close combat with her stature instead of just sitting back spitting acid on everyone.</br>  <br>We have Oars though. He engaged in plenty of combat despite being much larger that mom.</br>  guys, can someone give me a link to watch One Piece: strong world? can't find anything, how come?  <br>watchopnow dawt com<br><br>Took me literally 10 seconds.</br></br></br>  <br>What fetish can you get from him? <br><br>Nose? nah</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you could do something with a nose that big.<br><br> He's probably hung like a horse too. </br></br></br>  <br> watchopnow dawt com <br>i totally forgot about that website, thanks bruh</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah these fucking Yonkous are really well done.<br>I love how they're all different but it's totally logic that they're on top.<br><br>Kaidou: The one whor rules by stregth and fear<br>Big Mom: I don't fucking know who she became a Yonkou but she looks credible<br>Shanks: He seems to be the smart one<br>Whitebeard: Kind one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I love how much jimmies have gotten rustled over Monet.

There was nothing else said about it, they probably didn't even fight.</br></br>  <br><br>Shanks stopped the whole war, does that mean he's confirmed stronger than Blackbeard, Sengoku, Sakazuki and everyone else as well?<br>For all we know he didn't fight Kaido any more than he fought the people at Marineford.</br></br></br>  People still havent realize that Kaido is one of Doffys string clones? Jesus Christ...  <br> does that mean he's confirmed stronger than Blackbeard, Sengoku, Sakazuki and everyone else as well? <br><br>Probably. BB didn't have time to really master his second DF.</br></br></br>  <br>So Shanks was the strongest character in the series all along?</br>  <br> For all we know he didn't fight Kaido any more than he fought the people at Marineford. <br><br>Maybe they had a tea party and came to terms. In any case, Kaido got BTFO and Shanks inserted his dominance.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Gorosei, then BB. Luffy will be strongest eventually.</br>  <br> inserted his dominance <br>Or he was reasonable?</br></br>  <br>Reminder that literally nobody cares about what you think.</br>  <br>I don't think Luffy will ever be the strongest one in terms of one-man capabilities. My guess is, as Mihawk said, he'll simply become 'the strongest' because of his innate power to befriend people and shit. Just my guess though.</br>  <br>The additional powers related to Sengoku and Marco's fruits seem to be related to the mythology, thus meaning only the mythical zoans get those abilities. This is why I also think that Kinemon's fruit is the Kitsune mythical zoan, and his clothes making is the additional power (directly related to the folklore of the kitsune).</br>  <br>Like how Big Boss doesn't have any S ranks but he's still the best?</br>  <br> Just my guess though. <br>Pretty clear that this will be the case by now. Its basically what Dressrosa and Marineford have been about.</br></br>   that chopper teamup <br>Divine Soldier No. 36 for Nakama.</br>  <br>there are a shitton of people who seem to think Luffy will become, by the end of the series, a one man army with enough strenght to 1vs1 everything and anything that comes up to him no matter who or what. You never know with them, better say loud and clear that this is just my opinion to avoid retarded discussions</br>  <br> Kaido is the strongest living thing <br> Shanks is alive <br><br> Yeah, fuck off retard Shanks and Kaido never fought if anything Shanks probably made a compromise in order to have Kaido leave.<br><br> The Yonko are in a state of stalemate because they are so extremely close to eachoter in strength that if two yonko crews fight the one who wins will also suffer huge casualties thus making themselves prey for other crews,thre's no way Shanks fought Kaido and then went to Marineford virtually unscathed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1jwvORc5I8f</br>  <br> those horn and ears <br>Is him half-mink?</br></br>  <br> For all we know he didn't fight Kaido any more than he fought the people at Marineford. <br><br>Based on what we have seem from Kaido and his crew and also his reputation as being unreasonable, and merciless it isn't hard to assume that Shanks did fight Kaido and his crew in order to dissuade them from attacking Whitebeard</br></br></br>  <br> without a single scratch <br>Thats why I always said that there was something fishy about it. According to everyone Kaido is a fucking nut job. Yet there is no way that Shanks fought him prior to MF simply because that would imply that Shanks literally outguns him by at least twice the amount.<br><br>So either people have a wrong impression of Kaido or he is  a string clone and Doffy decided to let Shanks pass because 'it would be more fun'. </br></br></br></br>  <br> it isn't hard to assume that Shanks did fight Kaido <br>Yes it is. Shanks' group showed no signs of having fought. If they had, they'd gotten away completely unscathed. That's just unreasonable to expect.</br></br>  <br>you make a good point about Kaidou being unreasonable, but I find it hard to believe that Shanks fought with Kaidou and the rest of his crew and then arrived to Marineford completely clean of any possible scar and injuries, moreso that he supposedly battled with some batshit insane guys. Shanks is either a living cataclysm and there's an enormous disparity between him and Kaidou (which I don't think it's the case) or something else must have happened</br>   Jack-fags will defend this   <br>Defend what?</br>  <br>People like you are the fucking worst. No, he's not a "joke" now just because he can't stomp an entire village with 10/10 fighters with nothing but fodder on his side. All you wannabe fans want is getting hyped and edgy shit, you want Oda do completely fuck up his world building and depth just so a certain character looks extraordinary tough. It's like you're asking for world building and power levels as fucking terrible as Dragon Ball's.<br><br>Keep in mind that even characters like Zeff still have to fit in somewhere as actually somewhat strong characters. Where do they fit in when there are characters like the duke and then characters that could easily stomp up to 40 of those at the same time. Right, nowhere. that would be Dragon Ball. <br><br>Stop reading One Piece as the only manga not disgustingly edgy or catering to child fuckers, the only non-degenerate manga, stop shitting up respective threads and fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not funny, sorry</br>   Kaido has two more people like Jack under him <br> we still know next to nothing about Big Mom's underlings <br> Weevil is a beast <br> we haven't seen a single next generation paficista in action <br>I'm starting to feel a strange sense of awe right about now.</br></br></br></br>  Kaido arc<br>Reverie arc<br>Blackbeard arc (ends on Raftel)<br>War agaist the tenryuubito<br>Ending</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wanda literally said "We had the upper hand..."</br>  <br>Where do Wano, Elbaf and Vegapunk fit on that list?</br>  <br><br><br><br>true. them being unscathed really is highly unlikely. But we didn't see all of shanks' crew, only his top guys (so he may have had some injured crewmates but we didn't see them). Also it may be possible that is was purely a naval conflict as opposed to direct physical combat and that Shanks' crew might have the upper hand there.

If there is a chance someone will go unpunished if he doesn't take drastic measures he wouldn't risk it.<br><br>You may not agree with him and think it's right, but you can't say he's evil, if no one broke the law he wouldn't do anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The citizens of Ohara didn't break the law though.</br>  <br>I could see that he might say something like<br><br> i'm gonna kick straw hats ass, but after i dealt with that, i'm coming for you gorosei. # <br><br>But obviously he'll lose, so that will never happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No they did, they were researching into things that were potentially going to undermine/ruin the World Government.</br></br>  <br>No, the scholars were. The general population knew nothing about that. They were complete outsiders. The marines were evacuating them so they wouldn't be caught in the Buster Call.

If another one got away he might have ended up with Doflamingo, big mom, Kaido or Blackbeard. <br><br>So, while the motives of the WG are more suspicious (they don't want the secret behind the void century to be uncovered), for the civil world, in consideration of the ancient weapons, it might have been for the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Please go reread the flashback.

This allows a relatively consistent base for analysis. <br>Except the "issue" isn't that they can't use superweapons. The "issue" is that senshado is dangerous and can kil people. And by that argument the entire universe collapses. This is the equivalent of saying "magic doesn't exist" in a fantasy universe.</br></br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Everywhere</br>  <br>let me watch</br>   If the guys in charge of the rules said they can use the   Karl-Gerat , what's stopping them from not using it?<br><br>Moral issues aside, there is the very real problem of whether this excuse will be accepted by the courts.<br><br>A head's powers and domain are in interaction with other forces. For example, he suddenly declares that katanas are OK in matches. That is a de facto permission for countless kendo practitioners to hold real blades and is a direct attack on the 銃刀法 (Gun and Knive control law). The government won't accept this; should anybody start using blades in matches, they'll be arrested and tried. He will try to use Article 35 in his defence, but since it is not a law (法令) justifying his action, he'd have to justify it as 正当な業務 (proper business), which is dependent on cultural mores and norms, which of course the kendo head can't change on a whim. The chances of it being accepted is low because otherwise the court is de facto saying that a kendo head (one man) can change national law itself on his whim, which is clearly unacceptable.<br><br>The position with a Karl-Gerat is similar. Tanks, of course, have guns and thus again rub right into the 銃刀法. The 1945 thing is not just a safety consideration. That Senshado is allowed is in essence a partial weakening of the 銃刀法 and thus exactly what is allowed is also a balance between government (by extension the People, at least in principle) and the needs of Senshado. There are also other interests and norms involved (likey more than kendo) so again, the head is again not actually free to just change things massively on a whim.<br><br>Also  no sign the rules have actually changed &amp; Karl  ain't even close to the boundaries already set. In short, even the rules essentially say that weapon is impermissible, which only further weakens the case for Art35. The scenario is exactly as I propose here .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  RIN  <br>Her chest size is same as my belly size, does that count?</br>  <br>That either makes Rin flat or you fat.
