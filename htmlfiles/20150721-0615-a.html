They're naturally proud and hateful of humans and therefore need to be taken down a notch. This doesn't mean just humans and an orc can be used instead to show her that she isn't so high and mighty as she imagined. <br><br>Half-elf: Meant for tender loving. Half elves receive little acceptance in human society since they're frequently mistaken for full elves and in most elf societies they're instantly killed or expelled for tainting the bloodline. All of these factors lead to the creation of a submissive but extremely cute girl who becomes loyal and loving the instant somebody shows her a shred of kindness after a lifetime of pain and suffering.<br><br>Dark-elf: It's a mixed bag. In some setting Dark elves are seen as domineering and even more xenophobic than white elves which means that instead of being raped, they're the ones to do the raping and frequently raid human travelers in order to secure husbands and rape victims. In other settings dark elves lie at the other end of the spectrum and are discriminated against even more than white elves for being brown-skinned as well as their long ears. In these cases their designated role should be housemaid that falls in love with her master and happily gives herself to him for being so kind where her previous masters abused her.<br><br>Dark-Half-Elf:Spunky tomboys who wear spats and fuck their childhood friends until their dicks start whistling. Lots of precociousness and smugness mixed with genuine love and affection.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anyone?</br></br>  <br> Having a waifu that will outlive you and will probably fuck an orc after your death <br><br>Eh, Elf are for sex and forced procreation, Half-elf on the other hand could make nice waifu</br></br></br>  <br> find it <br> duplicate here <br>Damn it anon, stop being so helpful.</br></br></br>  <br> when i found out she has long hair <br>Bye boner.</br></br>   Somewhere, there's a planet full of elves <br><br>Sick, now I can disregard human women over the sole fact that their ears aren't long enough.</br></br>  <br>Well at least you are not disregarding them because they are 3d</br>  <br>You couldn't possibly rape them all before you die.</br>  <br> midget <br> superior <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>If there were an orc bent on such a task, he would die on a rock like the green ape he is.

High elves are the typical arrogant elf, like the one you describe. There's also wood elves, who are on the whole much friendlier to humans and the ones responsible for 90% of the half-elves.<br><br>Both have some overlapping features, but they are on the whole unique; most anime just combine the two. For example, the pure blooded elves in Zero no Tsukaima act a lot like high elves, with their incredibly arrogant attitude and condescending view of humanity. Wood elves are much friendlier to humans, but they are still arrogant: just about one thing. Probably their shooting skills. <br><br>Wood elves are nearly always archers, though they might have a bit of magic skill as well. Very skilled hunters and adept at roaming about the forest. High elves are far more likely to rely on spells to do the heavy lifting, but they sometimes uses bows as well if they can't spam spells.<br><br>Wood elves congregate in large forests so contact with humans is inevitable, the high elves use them as a buffer for their own cities far, far away from humans and even more isolated.<br><br>There's a shit ton of other elf types, Drows and Snow/Cave/Sea/Etc but those two I discussed often get mixed up and are the most common variety encountered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't do it anon<br><br>it's NTR</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;An elf 165 years old, though is considered to be in her teens by her race's standards. </br>  <br>I am okay with this</br>    <br> Implying Dwarves aren't better <br>Can Elves hammer?

So yes, laws that apply to humans at large would apply to them.<br><br>For the most part anyways. It would probably spawn another civil rights debate, about how many rights they REALLY have.<br><br>Besides, even animal rights would make raping them illegal, seeing how they would be in clear distress. Killing them is fine, as long as they don't feel it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> with  <br>I meant wish</br></br>  <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</br>  <br> as long as they don't feel it. <br>So, what if we rape them, and they don't feel it?</br></br>  <br>fug</br>   come to an elf thread  <br> no one posted best elf </br>  <br>The moment an elf were to be found I can assure there would be no less than 100 well-funded organizations lobbying for their rights and the media making gross overestimations on elf rape and why it's deplorable and sick.<br><br>How many politicians would kill for the chance to have their name on the bill that effectively makes them from slaves into people.

They're just humans with pointy ears. Wow, great character design.  <br>That's pretty much all alien species unless someone gets "creative" with insects and sea creatures.</br>  <br>Leave creativity for mechanical design and xenofurries. Humanoids with slight, exotic cosmetic quirks are best.</br>  <br>agreed</br>  Are there any decent horror anniemays that aren't the same old "a girl died 20 years ago and now comes back as a spooki ghost and kills everyone" shit?  Not really tbh.  <br>Kakurenbo?</br>  Paranoia Agent.  Boogiepop, nigga. Easy.  <br>I was watching Paranoia Agent as newfag but I don't know if it has any sense. Maybe it's too deep. Also no horror.</br>  <br>Lel, Boogiepop is literally "a girl died 20 years ago and now comes back as a spooki ghost and kills everyone"</br>  thinly veiled recommendation thread  I want to protect that blush.  <br><br>Who is this cute boy?</br></br>  Is Riu just stupid or a literal retard?  <br>Once he's a literal  corpse  next episode, that won't matter anymore.</br>  <br>But he did the right thing.</br>  <br>No. He was just super optimistic and naive.</br>  <br>Well, it was either that or giving VAPE the pretext to actually start killing people.</br>  <br>And now he has shown them that they can basically demand everything. Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes?</br>  <br>When you think about it, it reinforced people's disdain and hate for VAPE, making the red-haired guy's plan less likely to succeed.</br>  <br>No? He was portrayed as the good guy. Even if he dies (and he won't die), he'll go as a well beloved martyr and vape will be the bad guy.<br><br>Didn't you see the obvious OPINION-SHIFT on the people which were all turned against Vape? Rui's nobility touched them.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Whatever Rizumu does now, he'll lose. Rui put him in a no win situation.<br><br>People will no longer support him and he comes across as weak willed psycho who breaks his ideals while Rui comes across as too pure for this sinful world who is strong in his ideals. <br><br>He's just cornered and made himself everyone's hateful enemy not to mention he assaulted someone LIVE. He can be arrested with evidence now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Too bad he is about to be burnt to a crisp by Tsubasa  <br><br>I just finished the first season of this and it was very good, how is the second fairing up so far?</br></br>  This anime is why you should kill anyone that vapes.  <br>It hasn't really gone anywhere yet, Hajime gets some unusual focus cuts to imply that maybe something is wrong with her and the new Gatchaman is a qt hothead.<br><br>It's fun though, new OP is great.</br></br></br>  <br>This. There's a reason hostage negotiations include having snipers ready to take out the hostage taker.</br>  Do you think Joe was 100% right?  <br>Joe is always right</br>  <br>Why didn't Joe die in the first season?</br>  <br>He got his note tore off, but Katze didn't stab it.</br>  <br>Will he die this season at least?</br>  <br> joe <br> The guy who is always proved wrong <br><br>Anon... when the antagonist and joe make a point, expect it be the opposite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is about RuiRui suffering, not Joe. Joe gets the happy ending.</br>  <br>Because female audience would drop it.</br>  <br>Joe is my least favorite character and the show would improve for me if he died  I'm a grill btw </br>  <br>Joe needs more Bird Missiles for a happy ending.</br>  <br>OP has amazing visuals.<br>ED is not as good as the previous one but passable.<br>First episode was a good first episode. <br>Second was more exposition heavy.<br>And now we got to the Rui suffering in half the time of the previous season!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Joe is always right. If Joe saids the sky is green then the sky is green.</br>  <br>i hope he die</br>  <br>This, Rui is pretty much series' messianic figure, of course he'll be proven right in the end, Joe is just some capefag wannabe.</br>  <br>If he does die it would probably be near the end because he is one of the more popular characters (according to pixiv anyways). Maybe he is still depressed deep down but not enough to be suicidal. Joe is the only male eye candy so the female audience might go down. Carrot doesn't count because he is a cunt and Rui is eye candy for both genders.</br>  So who sponsored all the tablets they were giving for free to everyone?  <br>Except he's not entirely right.</br>  <br>That reminds me of some experiments in social psychology.</br>  <br>As much as I hate carrot, he does have a point. There are good people and there are shit people. Something Rui doesn't seem to understand. Joe doesn't really want to be a messiah. He just wants to protect people. He doesn't seem to like much attention. Out of all the gatchas he is the one that appears less in public. Joe understands that there is evil people out there. I don't know how the show is going to prove Rui right.</br>  <br>Well you have to use the public funds for SOMETHING</br>  <br>It's the power of being attractive</br>  <br>Rui is naive in his idealism but carrot does not have a point. Crowds are a tool just like any other. A bad person can take a knife and go stabbing spree, a bad person can take a car and drive it into a crowd, that's not a reason to ban knives or cars. <br>There is always a risk, it's simply a matter of pros outweighing the cons.</br></br>  <br>Me too. I hate cross dressers like him.</br>  <br>You won't be able to anon. We all know what route Tsubasa will go.</br>  <br> his accuracy with the darts matches how accurate his words are <br>DEEP</br></br>  <br>The show already proved Rui right last season, when him giving out the crowds to everyone didn't turn into a massive bloody clusterfuck. You can either love or hate how optimist the show's worldview is, but it's part of the suspension of disbelief. Hajime has that worldview too (the boys who won't give up their seat on the bus are probably tired, the wife of the man who was speeding with his car had just gone into labour) and she is always shown to be in the right.<br><br>Anyway, Rui has clearly looked up Rizumu and deduced he couldn't have been that bad (in fact, if he really were evil he would have gone along with Katze's plan as soon as he had his chance), so it's not even about Rui naively believing that there are no evil people.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm not sure. What other motivation could they have?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Senran Kagura is the best Gatchaman.  So did Rizumu not have the balls to use his Crowds right away, or was he just not interested until Rui's idealism rubbed him the wrong way?  <br>Maybe he was busy studying. <br>I'm pretty sure he is a decent person who snapped, possibly after losing someone to the incident in Tachikawa. (How long have the red crowds been active, anyway?)</br></br>  <br>I don't get it that's what I said. I mean Rui believes everyone is good deep down in their hearts which is not true.</br>  <br><br><br>Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you. That's the basis of their concept. <br><br>Rizumu destroyed his credibility to have a point when Katze cheered up for him and became a knife-wielding psycho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity. That's why villains are always attacking him or try to corrupt him. His resolution and his pain are important for the outcome of all. First season, it was about Katze and Hajime tug-fight for Rui, this one Rizumu and maybe Tsubasa join the fold for it.<br><br>He's like the mecha pacifist princess, only male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe can do no wrong.</br>  <br>Alcoholizing Sugane was pretty wrong. Remmeber when Sugane was an earnest diligent boy. Now he's a drunkard.</br>  <br> mecha pacifist princess <br>All he is missing is a song, but I think the White Ash lead singer's got that covered.</br></br>    <br>Why is Utsu-tsu the most underrated girl on the show?</br>  <br>Hajime is way more of a senran.</br>  <br>Word<br><br><br>It's good because Sugane enjoyed it. Joe can't do no wrong. Sugane knows Joe is best boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsubasa will fuck Rui. <br><br>Hotblooded hero mc gets peace princess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, but<br> Crowds <br> romantic development <br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have enough dick to please Rui.</br>  <br>She's more manly than anyone in the cast. Even Paiman is girlier.</br>  <br>Because if they tried that shit again, then it's no longer the Gatchaman's fault for any other deaths that occurred. No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. Now it's up to Vape to prove they can honor any other agreements from that point on. And until then, it would be no quarters from everyone else.</br>  <br>Hotblooded hero mc who fucks up the peace princess Honorable Sacrifice doesn't deserve shit. <br><br>Anyway Sugane and Joe saved Rui first, Tsubasa needs to respect seniority.</br></br></br>  <br>No, not really. The moment Tsubasa intervene, he won. Now he can say he meant every word he said, but because the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations, they are the ones that broken the agreement. They are the ones that can no longer be trusted. Any further deaths will be on their heads now.</br>  <br>Hajime needs a tragic backstory to be a Senran</br>  <br> No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. <br><br>But Gelsadra absorbed everyone insight and they were against Vape.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugane and Joe have each others.</br></br>  <br><br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br> Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity <br>Where was this said?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugane feels the need to apologize for everything he does <br> Joe turned him into an alcoholic <br><br>Nice and healthy.</br></br></br></br>   mfw Rizumin and Tsubasa have reversed eye/hair colors   <br>That's because no one has died yet and they haven't learn what the full details of the discussion. If someone had died and Rui could have prevented it, it will cause massive backlash. They all saw Rui willingly give away his Note, that means he accepted whatever deal VAPE has proposed. Now that the agreement has been ruined by Gel and Tsubasa's intervention, they now share part of the responsibility for any other deaths.</br>    <br>Fuck, it's true.</br>    <br> the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations <br><br>I doubt stabbing somebody to death is "negotiating"</br></br></br>  <br>You should have found the back of Sugane's head for good measure.</br>    <br>Being manly != having a dick</br>  How would you spend a day with Tomoko?  24 hours of non-stop bullying  <br>Be more specific.</br>  ignore her, because i don't talk to losers  Bathe her then fuck like there's no tomorrow<br><br>Obviously</br></br>  <br>Alcohol.</br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>I will bully every single inch of Tomoko.</br>  <br>Talking shit about people.</br>  <br>Tomoko is shit-tier imho.</br>  <br>This, until her mind breaks.</br>  Spend a day? no.<br>A night?

I figured I'd just play on Tomoko's insecurities and her love of yandere boys CDs.</br>  We'll be getting a new PV tomorrow, right? What are you hoping for?  <br> Yukiho <br> 28 <br>Did Yurishii make an appearance at all? All I want is to know that fans got to see a Yukiho duet.</br></br></br>  <br>She stops time around her. I think there was a theatre that showed this.</br>  <br>FINALLY</br>  <br>That bridge has been burned, mate. No hope for anything of the sort.</br>  <br> Was waiting for Mio <br>You what.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  Because she's L.E.S.B.I.A.N.  <br>i could answer it if you tell me who she is</br>  <br>No</br>  http://i.imgur.com/fvP8E3Y.webm  <br>Kumiko pls</br>  <br>As expected.</br>  Reminder that Natsuki is the best girl.  <br>She can be bisexual, you know.</br>  She wants to be perfect and special for the one she loves.   nightly fantasizes about being the gooey filling in the middle of a KumiTaki sandwich   <br>I haven't seen this Reina before.</br>  <br>That was one of the earliest promo pics that appeared online.</br>  <br>This I can agree with.</br>  <br>It's the trumpet. Trumpet only chooses best girls.  Ribbon is playing a coronet because she's too worst girl to tell the difference. No one tells her because it's funny that she's wrong. </br>  She plays trumpet  So why is this manga still popular?  i drew a doujin of that glasses kid and kanye west wanna see it  <br>I do</br>  <br>ok here you go</br>  New chapter when?  It's a nice comfy read if you like short mystery cases.  Because it's literally the same thing over and over again. It's one of the most consistent long running manga ever. <br><br>The only change is that Conan's deductions get more and more ridiculous as the manga continues, but once you're like 50 volumes into it you don't really care that much.</br></br>  There's nothing else like it  <br>This.<br><br>I mean for fuck's sake, there's only ever a small handful of cases that have any effect on continuity. The rest are just filler.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not filler when that's really what the whole point of the manga is. It's like saying Doraemon is just filler if the chapters don't directly deal with Nobuta's future or some plot-element that remains relevant for future chapters. Aoyama doesn't care about doing some crime thriller that revolves solely around the Black Organization. He just wants to do short mystery cases in the vein of golden age of detective fiction, in the same old format of 3 chapter per case story with 3 suspects, where the characterization is light and the motives are also de-emphasized.</br>  K-On on motorcicles.

Would easily top madoka.</br>  <br>I think Pleiades is better understood as part of a campaign to get girls into STEM than as a car commercial.<br><br>All the magic is physics. The show could have been a segment in the reboot of Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.<br><br>I'm not saying Subaru wouldn't mind selling some cars.

It just proves again that /a/ has shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br>Well maybe it wasn't for you then, I thought the space stuff was amazing. Seeing them go further and further every episode was great and the final with the last fragment in a black hole was great.</br></br>  <br>Everybody has shit taste but me.</br>  Who Rin here?  <br> 京アニが作れば <br> 京アニ待ってるぞ <br> 京アニだと信じている <br>Thanks anon but I hadn't read the comments, and I can at least understand that much without the need for translation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So just changing the place where a series takes place is enough for it to be original? So if K-On was to be remade in outer space while maintaining the same plot you would appreciate it? What a shitty opinion anon.</br>  Also, the main reason nobody gives a shit about pleiades is because it's het.  <br> The Bakuon storyboards are fake <br> Kyoani is going to make the VEG anime <br>What I'm supposed to believe?</br></br></br>  How many chapter are translated?<br>I couldn't found up to 16.</br>  Protip: kyoanus ain't going to animate bakuon, the manga actually has some action.  <br>most will go for sex hair</br>  <br><br>You really should relax anon. I liked HnP, but trying to force it on people who probably won't like it, on top of shitting on a show that isn't even out yet is completely retarded. <br>HnP is just a straight magical girls show and it's good at what it does, but not everyone like that genre.</br></br></br>   One person posts b8 <br> Entire thread is thrown off track <br> No one talking about cute girls or motorcycles <br>As expected of a Kyoani thread. Also, the article doesn't even confirm that they're making this, people in the comments are just speculating that they'll be behind the adaptation.<br><br><br>Sex hair is best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying KyoAni can't animate whatever they want. <br>And honestly if you think Baku-On had hard action scenes outside of the racing chapter then you're a shitposter who hasn't read the manga.</br></br>  <br><br>Onsa is fine too.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The comparison with Madoka is apt inasmuch as Pleiades is a show which uses a mahou shoujo settai to tell a story which is unfamiliar to the genre. Madoka is about young girl's grief. Pleiades is about a young girl's casual encounters with science.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sex hair <br> :&gt; <br>  some /ss/ action <br>Best girl confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>TTGL wasn't different at the start, it had nothing that made me want to keep going past episode 2. And I'll never watch it knowing how stupidly over the top it goes without a good enough explanation. At least Pleiades will explain the laws of physics, before they breaks those laws with magic.<br><br>It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is.</br></br></br>  Will this be like a good version of Rolling Girls?  <br>I'd prefer an anime about the Top Gear crew roadtripping Japan, meeting all kinds of strange anime shit along the way.</br>  <br>But people shit on HnP because it is uninspiring. It's a rehash of an old formula that /a/ doesn't really like outside of few notable exceptions. On the other hand /a/ loves SoLs and guess what KyoAni is great at? Many people really wanted a Gainax revival with HnP but they are still dead and they should be for their uninspiring rehashes.</br>  <br> It just bothers me that people shit on Pleaides for being a 'car commercial' without trying it, but will love any Kyoani show, no matter how recycled it is. <br><br>And you're doing the same thing with a show that isn't even out and might not even be done by Kyoani.<br><br>Just fuck off, nobody likes a hypocrite</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>was riding motorcycles actually relevant in Rolling Girls?</br>  <br>We've already established that this is the standard mode of discourse. Maybe you're the one who should bow out.</br>  <br>I have watched plenty of Kyoani shows to know what he makes is generally shit. I already stated that I was specifically not talking about this show, but Kyoani in general.</br>  <br>It's still shit</br>  <br>Sexhair is sex, but Rin is the cutest.</br>  <br>I heard that the Kyoani storyboard image for this was fake, but where was that confirmed?</br>  <br>Please don't shitpost using HnP.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, that was what HnP inspired me: boredom. It was the moeblob girls doing magical things while not defending against a big bad guys who somehow outsmarts them everytime. <br>I won't tell you TTGL is a super great anime, because it clearly went off tracks after the stupid as fuck timeskip, but it was a very fun ride from episode 1 to Genome's defeat. And they did some explanation in TTGL too. Just a little late tho.<br><br><br>Madoka is about young girls trapped by the cruelty of a world that is beyond them, and their desperate struggle against fate itself. It used magic in a very unique way: the "once you go black, you can never go back" way. Every element of PMMM served to maintain a carefully thought-out vicious circle with no laws whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This thread isn't even about KyoAni shitposter-kun. KyoAni aren't going to animate this. Chances are it's either Satelight or Dogakobo.<br>And on the topic of KyoAni they didn't do a single bad show and they have sold more BD copies than your favorite studio ever will (Unless you're a Sunrise and Gainax fag at the same and then you're just pure cancer).</br></br>  When will get an anime about cute girls starting a kart racing team and working their way to F1 like Capeta but all girls?  <br> K-on on motorcycles <br>Rolling girls S2?</br></br>  <br>well they used them to get from A to B</br>  <br> KyoAni aren't going to animate this. <br>What makes you think that?<br>There have been rumors going on for a while now that Kyoani is going to anime this, before the anime adaptation was even announced.<br><br>Aren't they the most likely studio to anime this based on the information we have?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My problem is with /a/ who hops on the kyoanus bus <br><br>God, kill yourself faggot. <br>You're talking as if you have the right to tell other people what they have to like or talk about.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   inb4 a bunch of weebs crash and die on their ninja 300s <br><br>Educate yourself on motorcycle safety before making the decision to buy a bike. MSF courses are fun and cheap!<br><br>-love /o/</br></br></br></br>  <br>The 'rumors' were largely jokes because of the tank covers resembling K-on's.</br>  Have some delicious fake storyboards.<br> Reminder that the key to kyoani magic is scheduling and not budget. </br>  <br>Because something like Bakuon doesn't require a full staff to not do anything but work on it for more than 5 months in a row. And their next anime required that from the guys and gals in AnimeDo. So yeah I'm ruling KyoAni out of it because they really can't do multiple projects at the same time.</br>  KyoAni found a way yet again  <br>Kyoani can't animate something this lewd.</br>  <br>Obviously the stakes in PMMM are higher than they are in HnP. Once you get past that, they are really very similar shows. They each have a similarly unified design and thorough execution.</br>  Last shitpost, sorry for the derail.<br><br>Pleaides was an extremely fun ride from the start, but I supposed you have to be into the genre first to be able to really get into it. Mecha has never been my thing and any 'explanation' of various parts in Gurran Laggan just sound ridiculous and make me not want to watch it.<br><br>OP started with Kyoani, I'll shitpost about Kyoani if I want, but I did assume they would make it.  I hope Godakobo doesn't pick this up. <br>And are you implying that sales means everything? The popularity just means that it's target audience is big and that it hits it's target audience. Kyoani doesn't take chances and instead just remakes the same show with cute girls doing _blank_ things because they know it will sell time and time again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've already animated the lewdest thing ever.<br>They can do that for sure.</br></br>  <br>God I hope you actually rot in hell for using a cite show like HnP for shitposting.<br><br>What's full nudity in Amagi Brilliant Park?</br></br></br>  If the first season covers the first 3 volumes then we won't get to see Azusa 2.0  <br> There will be people who will complain about K-On sameface when Bakuon airs if it is done by KyoAni. </br>  Lewdest show since Amagi tbh  <br><br>Jesus Christ, look at that Faggot.</br></br>    <br>Blame kyoani for using key looking faces since then.</br>    <br>What the fuck disgusting.</br>  <br>They really don't use Key eyes and faces though. The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike.</br>  <br> moeshit <br/></br>  <br>sex hair thinks its her own drool, suzuki's fanboyism infects her, hence </br>  Favorite girl?  <br> The face started with K-On and spread to Haruhi and then the rest of their shows until Hyouka/Hibike. <br>This just shows how much of a newfag you are.<br>K-On aired years after Haruhi.<br>I'm a kyoani fag myself, so I'm not trying to shit on them, but they did start with "moe" faces with Key adaptations. They have been making them less retarded as the years go by though, and thankfully, since the old style didn't age well in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it started with Kannagi.</br>  <br>cager detected</br>  <br>The slutty one.</br>  <br>Jeremy Clarkson</br>  <br>The fucking K-On face started with K-On. Their Key adaptations were a 1:1 clones of the VNs. And I'm talking about the late Haruhi not the 06 Haruhi.</br>  <br> Azusa 2.0 <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Azusa returns <br><br>Thank you Based KyoAni</br></br></br>  Oh fuck, my  wife  is a suzuki fangirl. Pretty much grins like a fucking loon every time she sees a Jimny.<br><br>She's going to go fucking mental for this series, isn't she?</br></br>  <br>Number of people who care about it:</br>  So this is just a K-On parody about motorcycles right?  <br>I want to buy a Suzuki just for Rin!</br>  <br><br>She's pretty much Azusa except she's not very skilled with driving and is afraid of motorcycles but she wants to get better. She's also a bit more awkward.</br></br>  <br>It's like a mixture of K-on and Top Gear with bikes.</br>  DAMN  Does anyone know if it will have my bikefu, the Kawasaki EX250?  <br>So she's not Azusa?</br>  <br>She's still Azusa in the sense that she's an annoying little tryhard.</br>  <br>Female Stig rides a Kawasaki.</br>  <br> except she's not very skilled <br><br>Faker.</br></br></br>    Is Azusa 2.0 bicurious?   Motocycle fun for Fall <br> Hibike S2 for Spring 2016? <br>One can only hope<br><br>Still, lewd motorcycles by Koyani is going to be fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the fact that there is yuri baiting between her and Yui2.0</br>  I hope they hire someone to work on animating Ritsu 2.0's sex hair specifically, like they did with Free's water.  <br> Hibike S2 <br>HAHAHAHA no</br></br>    <br>Isn't this series too lewd for Kyoani?</br>  <br>KyoAni wants to. Lantis want to it too. They only need Yamaha to give them the confirmation and the project is a go.</br>  <br> a show that's not out yet is overpraised garbage <br>Nice time travel.</br></br>  <br> &gt;cg bikes <br>Just like they used cg instruments for Hibike, right?</br></br>    are they really confirmed? if so fuck everything no more good threads (ever since the rumor threads have been shit anyway and will get even worse with more kyoanifags and animeonlyfags)  this will probably be the last episode of the first season  <br>But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. So yeah shit threads are better than no threads and no scalnation at all.</br>    <br>look at this thread, is already a kyoani thread</br>   there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon  <br>jesus fucking christ why cant we ever have nice things</br>  <br> there are really people in this thread comparing k-on to bakuon <br>There's a reason for that you retard.</br></br>  <br> People comparing a manga to its parody <br>How dare they. Fucking cunts the bunch of em.</br></br>  There is no mention of KyoAni. I don't see why they would be jumping on this either. They're clearly trying to work with their model. <br><br>KyoAni isn't desperate for money either. The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On. That has nothing to do with KyoAni and I don't think they're interested.</br></br>  <br> But there are no Bakuon threads since Christmas. And the scalnation staled since that time. <br><br>not sure if serious</br></br></br>  <br> The only reason why people are linking them with this is because Bakuon is apparently similar to K-On.  <br><br>Its the same stupidity that makes anons say Soranowoto was similar to K-On.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really serious. I didn't see any Bakuon thread since the Christmas gift that anons gave us. And the scalnations are stalled for a while now on Vol 2 and isn't even localized in France. So yeah any anime traction this gets is a chance for the scalnations to move forward.</br>  <br>I want to believe.<br><br> Reunite the roller girls </br></br></br>  Please no. KyoAni don't animate this shit.  <br> KyoAni <br> loli anime <br>Confirmed for never already.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni wants to <br>Bullshit. They want to do something with male staff already, and that's why they're saving their marketing and enthusiasm with these low profile projects.<br>Brace yourself for Free's shota prequel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why haven't we gotten a girls' rhythmic gymnastic TV series recently?<br><br>It's like easy fanservice just like Free!</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this is a stupid series about a horrible topic, with generic shit girls.<br>I hope they won't get better than DEEN or A-1 for it.</br></br>  <br>Their AniDo project is nearly done though. And no it's not the Free movie either because that one is alredy over. So yeah the main company is doing nothing until next year.</br>  <br>There is L I T E R A L L Y N O T H I N G in this article that confirms it being made by KyoAni. Fuck off.</br>  <br>you too</br>  <br> Not wanting to watch glorious Yamahas and Suzukis in anime <br>Confirmed for a faggot.</br></br>  <br>The stig.</br>  <br>Have fun polluting earth needlessly and causing many accidents, retard.</br>  <br>You wot.<br>Yeah we've been slow recently due to reasons, but we released the rest of volume 2 after the hitches in January and February.<br>We're gonna get 2 chapters out soon-ish, before the third week of August for sure since the TS is moving, after that I don't know. To be frank, I don't have all that much interest or motivation left for this shit, I haven't translated anything related to it since the first few months of 2015 and all I've been doing is cleaning/redrawing/typesetting which are things I 100% do not enjoy. I'll keep going, sure, but I'm still hoping for it to get an official translation so I can move on to other things. Or if someone else wants to pick it up I will gladly throw staff and scans at you, hell maybe some hosting too while we're at it.</br></br></br>  I'm still excited for it, regardless of who's making it. However I'll feel like a traitor unless I at least pretend Honda-chan is best girl.  <br>I love the magical girl genre and I don't think HnP is that good.</br>  <br><br>HnP turned to shit because the shota fetishization crap episode.</br></br>  <br><br>At a glance I thought this was Futachuat first.</br></br>  <br>LEWD</br>  OP YOU LYING FUCK  <br>You mean this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/374<wbr>23 and this http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/857<wbr>285 ?<br>Latter is better</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>a post this shit actually got over 10 replies</br>  <br>this girl is quite clearly the best</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I might actually have to pick up a kyoani show for once.</br>  NO FUCK YOU KYOANI FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT ITS BEEN 5 YEARS AND THE FUCKING SPIN OFF BY SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA YOU FUCKING FUCK UPS GOONS  <br>Don't they have a short girl or something?</br>  <br>What does Satelight's latest series have to do with KyoAni at all?<br>KyoAni never made a call.</br></br>  <br> SATELIGHT WAS MORE BORING THAN HYOUKA <br><br>How is this relevant?</br></br></br>  <br>Please, leave Pleiades out of your shitposting.</br>  <br> VEG anime <br>I wish</br></br>  <br>too bad she's horrible at riding a motorcycle</br>  <br>but that's every one of them</br>  <br>Hopefully this will be better and more memorable than The Rolling Girls.</br>  <br> KyoAni <br><br>I died with Amagi and now this?<br>R.I.P</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shouldn't be hard</br>  <br>She's probably staring at the suzuki logo on her ass</br>  <br> The next stop on our road trip is the historic city of Tokyo <br> But isn't that the place we just left? <br> No, that Tokyo had a bunch of ghouls in it. This is a different Tokyo. <br> Well what's so different about this place? <br> I'm not sure, but apparently there are a number of Extra Special Power users there. <br> ... <br> Skip? <br> Skip. <br> Maybe we can get the producers to include a Tokyo with Ravens sometime. <br> Ravens and miniskirts <br><br> But I liked Tokyo ESP... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing points to KyoAni <br> not even mentioned <br> just a rumor based on the fact that it's similar to K-On <br> can't even read the thread <br><br>KyoAni isn't dead you stupid faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   you never get a K-ON on motorcycles where they fight villains with their instruments <br><br>KyoAni, if you're out there listening, please make this happen.</br></br>  <br>Died because the anime was great.<br><br>Back to you, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you even saying?

Feels more like "inspired by" rather than "parody of" (besides the covers and like 5 characters which are blatant ripoffs).</br>  <br> already <br>The manga has been around for a while</br></br>  helmets too  <br>Keion manga is trashed though.<br>Does the Baku-on manga capture the essence of what make kyoani keion actually good?</br></br>  <br>what made keion good?</br>  <br>God, that show was amusingly boring. I dropped it, is it worth finishing?</br>  <br>Not really. It would probably be better if it tried to be less K-on and more Top gear.

Time to search the panda.</br>  <br>That bulge doesn't look very healthy.</br>  <br>He can always get work as a NASCAR pace car driver, or write a book.</br>      <br>To be fair, I wasn't talking about Sexhair or Suzuki</br>  I wonder if they will have actual brands. can't see ducati letting them use their name with how much the manga shits on ducati.  <br>well the japanese brands are a no brainer $$$<br><br>i guess they could always spell ducati wrong</br></br></br>  I don't understand why did the author went with no nipples, no pantsu.<br>It's not like it's being published in a shounen magazine.</br>    Which same face will KyoAni choose this time /a/? Choose wisely.  <br>At least use the updated one with the Amagi and Hibike faces.</br>    <br>It is updated.</br>  <br> Is Azusa 2.0 bicurious? <br><br>Bikecurious</br></br></br>  From now on I will call her NTR-chan.    <br>why do you think her hair is shaggy?</br>  <br>uh, why?</br>  <br>The Stig was secretly John Humphrys all along so he's still got a job.</br>  <br>The last season is a good example</br>   K-On parody being animated by K-On people <br><br>wut</br></br>  wait, do people in this thread legitimately think kyoani is doing this?<br>that's hilarious.</br>  <br>People are hoping for KyoAni because they won't do CG bikes. I'm hoping for either KyoAni, White Fox, Dogakobo or SilverLink. A-1 or JC staff would fuck this so hard.</br>  <br> they won't do CG bikes <br>What makes you think that?</br></br>  <br>Oh shit, so it was true? Am I really going to get sex hair with all that glorious KyoAni animation?<br>Good morning, penis. We're going to die</br></br>  <br>A manga inspired by K-on being animated by the people that animated K-on. I mean this isn't hard, besides Yamaha already sponsored an anime made by Kyoani last season.</br>  <br>They didn't use CG for the instruments in Hibikek did they?</br>  <br> A manga inspired by K-on being animated <br><br>the lies are taking on a life of their own</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128337392 <br> Amagi <br> harem </br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128337392 <br> no male MC <br> You can pretend that Bike-kun is a male </br></br>  Where is the confirmation?  <br> no nichijou <br>fuckoff</br></br>  <br>Sento, princess and that school girl want Kayne's D tho?<br><br>It's just not right</br></br></br>  <br>tybka</br>  <br>But they deserve some love too. It's not like you can't self-insert as a bike right? Imagine those girls riding on you all day everyday.</br>  Oh god yes.  <br>They are really autistic when it comes to handdrawn vs CG. For example the director of Hibike in an interview said that he demanded that either everything is done by hand or scrap the whole thing and redo it from scratch in 3DCG. They ended up using CG for the small background instruments but everything else is handdrawn.<br>When you compare that to any other studio who will most likely be happy with CG like Sunrise in Love Live which looked jarring or Ufotable in God Eater.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128337392 <br>You rewatch CLANNAD the superior KyoAni harem.</br>  <br> Ufotable in God Eater. <br>Oh jesus that show.<br>I ended up checking the raw of the first episode for like 2 minutes, deleted it and never looked back.</br></br></br>  <br>confirmation for what?</br>  <br>KyoAni animating it. Which there is none.</br>  <br>Most of it is still 2D animation and better than kyoanus too. Plus is not another CGDCT shitshow</br>  <br>My  bike </br>  <br>It's not like KyoAni don't use CG at all though, and when they do it's not pretty.</br>  <br> There are anons out there that belive the animation in GE is tolarable let alone good. <br>Please go and stay go.</br></br>  <br>That's why they shy away from it. I mean their last prominent CG was in Clannad. The whole fight scenes in KnK and the water scenes in Free were hand drawn and were great. They had an animator working only on the blood sword in KnK and on the water in Free. Of that's not autistic I don't know what is.</br>   this show airs <br> weebs start buying super fours, katanas, serows, and ZX-12Rs and wreck them on the touge <br>calling it now</br></br>  <br><br>i mean when the subject matter revolves around an object (hand drawn instruments in k-on/euph, the amazing water detail in Free), kyoani seems to be fairly rooted in the hand drawn camp.<br><br>I just hope they decide to do the same with it here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They will. And threads will have anon crying about how the fall from a bike isn't as easy as they showed it in the anime.</br>  <br>Well, that Subaru show aired and I didn't see many people buying cars.<br>Except for one guy. I think.</br></br>  <br> PA works <br> good <br>When will this meme die ? They did nothing good except Shirobako and Nagi no asukara.</br></br></br>  <br>cars are significantly more expensive than music instruments or bikes though.</br>  ships and now motos? this shit did stop being funny long ago  <br>They aren't motorcycles, anon, they just ride them.</br>  <br>Pledais isn't actually good.<br>The pig disgusting 3DCG didn't help either.</br></br>  <br>Please refer to chart that got posted somewhere in this thread, it got pretty nice after some point. And space is cool.</br>  lol the logo makes it look like it's about wheelchairs  I'm surprised the companies support this. Considering his h mangoo with girls literally fucking their bikes.  <br>Is that on sadpanda? I don't remember one like that.</br>  <br> lol the logo makes it look like it's about wheelchairs <br><br>That's where many bike riders end up so it's fitting.</br></br></br>  <br>Sex hair is pretty hot</br>  <br>But that's a good thing, it proves that we aren't as close to the Shimoneta world as we think.<br>I'm curious about how lewd the show will end up being if it's really KyoAni that ends up animating it, though. They're way too pure, even after AmaBuri corrupted them a bit.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/48756/c0f5148<wbr>6b8/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/80779/e8507d2<wbr>d48/</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Thanks, found it too in the meantime.<br>Why was the onsen chapter so tame then? no nipples at all.</br></br>   implying they aren't going to announce Haruhi S3 for next year   <br>Check your eyes nigga.

Ideally that is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think the author has no idea with which girl to go and is just going with the flow<br><br>The big no-no for Mari is the fact we saw her tits, we also saw Chiyo's tits (with tit sucking) during the grope or not grope part, vice prez every panel.<br><br>We've barely seen Hana's ass now</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Him getting over his lock on Chiyo. <br>What does he even see in her? She's so retarded.<br>Everything that he did for her to warm up to him is based on the LIE that he's into sumo wrestling.</br></br></br>  <br>dat body, friday can't come soon enough</br>  <br>She is a cute.</br>  <br><br>It's love at first sight shit, she was the first girl to talk to him because she thought he liked sumo. <br><br>It's kinda shitty and she interrupts alot of lewd scenes plus locks him out of Mari but that's how it is, it's like the author wants us to hate her. <br><br>Hope she goes full ntr and just watches Kiyoshi fuck whoever wins the Kiyoshibowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so, who's gonna get to fondle mari's breast? my bet is on kiyoshi</br>  <br> I am a hana fag but this might be the most intimate scene in the manga <br> implying </br></br>  <br>She's a girl and she's nice to him. <br><br>Basically, Chiyo represents an idealized, pure relationship with a nice girl which is what Kiyoshi thinks he wants. This is juxtaposed with the increasingly sexualized situations in which Kiyoshi finds himself in. Idealized romance vs Awakening sex drive and different understanding of relationship.<br><br>Basically, it's about puberty. In appropriately over the top fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari is way sexier, with the perfect body. Perfect height at like 5'9" if we're going by looks. And if we're going by personality then Hana is the best. So Chiyo pretty much has nothing going for her...</br>  <br>I keep seeing this here, but I don't think I agree chiyo is the non-pervert oure part of him and hana the perversion.<br>Things are much more simple.<br>Kiyoshi didn't know any girls.<br>Girls in school didn't talk to him.<br>Then she did and she was nice.<br>Then the usc happened and all the other girls who interacted with him treated him horribly.<br>Chiyo still treated him nicely and went on a date with him even though he was locked in prison as a pervert.<br>It's not like chiyo symbolises his struggle to remain pure and not give into lewdness while hana is his true pervert self analog.<br>Chiyo is just the only girl in the series that consistently and intentionally treats him in a way that makes him happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know thats a group affair yes?</br>    <br>Thats shingo talking, hes been wanting to go at it and got into an argument with kiyoshi about it because kiyoshi was more serious about waking meiko.</br>  <br>Of course.<br>Chiyo should be there as well.</br></br>  <br>I don't agree with her, but I understand her point. It's the only right conclusion from the experiences she's made.</br>  <br>both shingo and jo wants to do it that's why I think mari won't let them</br>  <br>Generalisation is never a right conclusion, anon.</br>  <br> mari won't let them <br><br>She was pretty damn friendly with shingo...</br></br></br>  <br>because he wasn't trying to assault her</br>  <br>She would let them for the right price.</br>  <br>mari confirmed for whore, sucks clit for presidency anyway</br>  <br>I hope she won't sink that low</br>  <br>Actually thats exactly what they were trying to awaken meiko but they got all nervous and flirty about it which is why kiyoshi got pissed off since they were fucking around and not taking it seriously.</br>  <br>it turns out that chiyo was right all along</br>  <br>She tries so hard for Andre. I really appreciate that.<br><br>However my lust for Hana knows no end therefore she is best girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>yes but mari was going along with it because there was no sexual harassment (towards her) involved. I don't think she will just let the boys fondle her breasts, especially if they keep those lewd faces one</br>  <br>Basically, she would even suck cock just to get with kate.</br>  <br>ok let's look at if from a different perspective, shingo and joe have already had their share of sexual harassment with anzu and cake a few chapters ago. <br>surely the author is not going to give them another piece of heaven so soon</br></br>  <br><br>I hope she sinks this low.<br>It seems all the build up of her being this man hating mega bitch in the anime so far most likely will lead to some delicious humiliation</br></br></br>  <br>My flawed goddess won't be touched like that.</br>  <br>where the fuck can i read chapter 183 in english? what the fuck is yomanga???</br>  <br> that cameltoe </br>  <br> he will never be your father-in-law </br>  <br>it's ok some people can't see beyond the surface.</br>  <br>It'd be terrifying for Kiyoshi though, he's a breast man and he'd always have to pretend to be an assman around him.</br>  <br>if the surface is a kick in the face, they shouldn't try to</br>  thanks for the chapter 184  Reminder that yen press is releasing the mangas in 2 days.<br><br>is anyone going to buy this piece of  art </br></br>  <br> yen press </br>  <br>The volumes seem pretty expensive but I gues they are chunky.</br>  <br>It's already out here and I got my two volumes already.</br>  literally Mari  <br><br>How are they anything alike?</br></br>    <br>the only difference between them is the genre. Both are uptight no fun allowed model students.</br>  <br>man, she look scary, what is this from?</br>  <br>In this shot, it really looks like she's going commando. To get the pants that discreet would be extremely difficult. Especially if you look at the third panel.<br><br><br>But with the fidgeting and rearrangement here it does seem like she's actually wearing them.<br><br>Well either way, it's probably going to chafe.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Both possibilities make me rock hard. Whatever happens, we win in the end.</br></br>  <br>Kiyoshi just needs to find his way. Once he realizes obvious superiority of asses, he will have to embrace his new life as assman</br>  <br>She's also a sad cunt with emotional baggage who will treat you like crap and tell you to fuck off when she's trowing her tantrums.</br>  Another question for you:<br><br>Cheekbones?<br><br>or <br><br>JAWLINE?!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheekbones</br>  <br>She got better though. We'll also get flashbacks explaining her hatred towards men, followed by her resolving her daddy issues, which means huge development in future</br>  <br>jawline slightly edges out cheekbones. I can live with not-very-defined cheeks but I cannot live with a manjaw.</br>  <br><br>3D or 2D? Because 2D girls for the most part have the same triangular face without a pronounced jawline.</br></br>  <br>I think Hana is going to be on top in the cavalry battle since she's the smallest.<br><br>And we all know what that means if she's nopan.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's pretty much a given at this point.</br>  <br>We saw flashbacks explaining she liked her father.<br>We don't have a clue why she hates men yet.<br>And she barely got better, she still thought kyoshi did something bad when she saw him beaten by risa and called him ungrateful when he ran away from chiyo.</br></br></br>  <br>Called him trash to be exact..at least shes consistent with that and the boys</br>  <br><br>I think the evidence goes heavily in the favor of the idea that she just has them squeezed tight between her cheeks.<br><br>Anyways, Hana only had lewd scenes with Kiyoshi present, so I doubt anything scandalous will happen during the battle with many people present.<br><br>Chiyo will probably catch a glimpse of whatever is underneath Hana's/Kiyoshi's shorts, but that's about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if that was true, she wouldn't have a problem taking her old panties back. but she said she won't wear underwear kiyoshi wore. ergo, commando.</br>  <br>good stuff chairman.<br><br>probably cheekbones.</br></br></br>  I really hope hana wins<br><br> still going after chiyo <br> later finds out she only wanted to be friends with him <br> begins to question why he even worked so hard to get with her, concludes he never even liked her that much <br> throughout the manga hana keeps popping in his mind <br> eventually realizes he loves her <br><br>Also hope andre stays with risa</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She won't take them back because she wants Kiyoshi to wear something of hers. She changed her mind once she saw how happy he was over receiving the headband. Also, she is probably looking to pick a fight with Chiyo because she knows she would freak out if she saw him wearing the panties back from the dorm.</br></br>  <br>She was saying that because they were going to swap it right there.</br>  Post your best Hana's  <br><br>Without knowing the context, his behavior does not make sense to other people.</br></br>  <br>if she's still willingl to jump to negative conclusions about him, even when it comes to being beaten by risa who's her enemy, then her improvement is too small to be acknowledged.</br>  <br>But we all know chiyo will come up with her own context for it and completely miss whats really fucking happening. She'll think of it as another stupid reason like hes hiding something for her birthday despite him not knowing anything at all about when it is.</br>    <br> helping out this man-hating dyke </br>    <br>Man I really wish there was a good one where she is doing her Karate or in her Gi or something</br>    Why is Hana so popular  <br><br>Hot, cute, innocent, perverted and has the best scenes.</br></br>  <br>She looks familiar.<br>I think I have seen her face somewhere else before.</br></br>   meiko is still some shy faggot <br><br>When will this end, its pretty boring. Also will the manga end anytime soon? Hope not.</br></br>  <br>Cause she's best girl.</br>  <br>getting it tuesday for sure, it's going for 10 at amazon btw</br>  <br>Wrong</br>  Who is best boy?<br><br> and why is it gakuto </br></br>  <br>He has more faith in PBR-sama than anyone else.</br>  <br>Andre &gt; Gakuto &gt;Joe &gt;=Kiyoshi &gt;Shingo</br>  <br>Because she has some of the best scenes. <br><br>Seriously, her scenes with Kiyoshi are gold.</br></br></br>  What the fuck is yomanga? googled it and it just lead me to some non related links  <br>Some shitty mangafox clone like the billion others on the internet</br>  <br> putting joe and Andre above glasses and MC  <br>You're crazy Andre is traitor and joe is lowkey for letting glasses girl think they both are gay. Plus it's always glasses and MC who make up the plans</br></br>  <br>Is PBR-sama a boy or a girl? In an earlier chapter the translation said "Lord PBR" but in another one they where calling it a goddess.</br>  <br>Andre is top.<br>He's the only one who got a girl to treat him like he wants. Upfront and demanding perverts are rare, he gets first place for this. gakuto is obvious second and above mc and the rest, easily. Between joe and kiyoshi , they'd be in a tie, but a)kiyoshi decided to help mari and b) joe's -almost naked in ropes-moment was perfect</br></br>  <br>non binary genderfluid pansexual :^)</br>  I find it interesting that there have been nonstop threads about Prison School since the anime aired. Did everybody scramble to read the manga? Are there any anime only peeps who have managed not to be spoiled?  <br><br>I marathoned everything in a day after the first ep. The threads are actually pretty slow though, so I'm not convinced that a lot of people picked it up.<br><br>I recall there being regular threads in the past year, so I'm not sure whether we're having more recently.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The last time we had threads like this was when they both got into the futon. Threads have been nonstop as of late. Multiple threads popped up today.</br>  <br>IKR!<br>these people are so obsessed about Prison School that they make Threads every saging one, Even tho their discussion is always the same<br> Hana a best girl <br> Winning Kiyoshi's bowl  <br> Speculations, Theories and giving definition to every dialogue  <br>  Who's the best girl/boy <br> ASS or TITS <br>I'm also a huge PS fan but these threads are getting...Tiresome. Fruitless debates</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then ignore the shit! there isn't anything you can do about it, that's like me saying "man on every thread some anon comes and complains about the thread stating the same arguments every time just in different words" but I'm sure that won't stop anons like you from voicing there opinions about the thread</br>  <br>Just because Andre got a girl to treat him how he wants makes him the best? How in exchange he traded in his sanity and his friends only person worst then him now is shin. See I could understand if Andre before the VP went all shy was the the top or so (because he was the only one who tried to save joe ) but now he's just another guy who has be traded his friends for a female .</br>  <br>This is how discussion about literally every form of media goes.<br>What on earth do you expect?<br><br>Also type like you're a fucking human being for christ's sake. Keep the stupid acronyms and ellipses to your social networking sites.</br></br></br></br>  step aside, chumps<br>superior Mari coming through</br>    NEXT?  <br>Why does he have to change the way he types? What the fuck are you his English teacher? As long as he doesn't do that shit when it matters then he's in the right</br>  Excuse me, <br><br>Best Girl coming through</br></br>  <br>Because idiocy isn't something that I tend to encourage, you mouth breathing idiot.</br>  <br>You mean Gakuto comes up with all the plans and Kiyoshit carries them.<br><br>Gakuto is the true mc of this manga</br></br></br>  <br>pretty sure that's a basic bitch</br>  <br>Kate a shit. A god damn shit.<br><br>Hana used to be a shit when I thought she was just another generic bitch like Meiko, but she's turned into best girl. <br><br>dat body.</br></br></br></br></br>  I think I've been converted to utter submission by Hana. <br><br> she pulls kiyoshi's hair as she kisses him <br> kisses him after she pisses on him <br> psychotic </br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari put this manipulative whore in her place</br>  <br>Ok you call it idiocy and others call it just getting to the point. what you should do is, get offline, get your panties out of a bunch and go enroll to be a English teacher since you feel as if you need to help people with with their spelling and grammar. At least at a school what you're teacher would actually matter</br>  <br><br>S H I T TA S T E<br><br>H<br><br>I<br><br>T<br><br>T<br><br>A<br><br>S<br><br>T<br><br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No I meant both of them. Yeah glasses usually do come up with most of the plans but when actually acting them out the MC is usually the one to come up with other ideas when glasses idea first back fires or some like that</br>  is Hana's thing golden showers or does she have a fetish for revenge?<br><br> I don't fucking get piss or shit fags </br></br>  <br>I feel like this is Delinquent Erina.</br>  <br> calling a non factor "best girl" <br><br>Hell all of her council members are better then her. Only person she beats out is hana</br></br></br>  <br>Tjat time when he flashed was great. Can we make a chart for Chiyo &amp; Kiyoshi moments for...comparison?</br>  <br> spoiler <br>You are not alone.</br></br>  <br>Neither, she just really wanted her revenge and fell in love and now she finds reason to talk and get at the MC</br>  <br>No chiyo is too shit to get her own time line board!!!!!!!</br>  <br>It's revenge at first, and an excuse to get close to Kiyoshi later. She shows her true colors when they first get to Kiyoshi's room and they start doing cute couple things. If she had really been looking forward to the pissing thing, she wouldn't have forgotten about it entirely.</br>  <br><br>cool, I'm still  pissed  about the author going for the piss thing, complete turn off</br></br>  <br><br>How? Even tho yeah that shit is nasty, It has moved the story and their relationship along. I don't see how the author could of did it any other way with the piss and Ill take piss over scat any day</br></br>  <br>But next time someone argues in Chiyo's defense we can pull out the 3-4 time something happened between them.</br>  <br> why didnt the author cater directly to me </br>  <br>I'm not exactly into piss either but I've grown to like Hana so much it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>Why are they up on Yomanga and not Madokami?</br>  <br><br>By also being a manipulative whore.<br><br>Seriously, Kate and Mari are perfect for each other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chemistry? Things are slowly setting up for Kiyoshi to be one of the main ways for Mari to normalize her relations with men.</br>  <br>That's true but the anon may get confused because all of the scenes would look almost the same, just chiyo smiling and the MC thinking about her</br>  <br>Jealousy is a beautiful thing. But I worry about what'll happen when Mari/Kiyoshi becomes a real thing.</br>  <br><br>You're implying it ever will be a real thing.</br></br>  <br>Hana is way better than Kiss x Sis piss girlfriend.</br>  <br>How else is he going to keep Prison School going after we hit summer break? There's nothing else for the boys to aim for or get sent to prison for.</br>  <br>Which is excacy why they need to be reminded, just in case they forget.<br><br>Marifags really need one. They seem to forget the 2 interactions they have had...three if you count the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Ain't that the truth? I hate piss-chan, fuck her.</br>  <br>Only girl to openly express her love to Kiyoshi. <br><br>Totally naive about sex and bodily functions, which makes for hilarious scenes. Unlike Chiyo who's a muscle-bound idiot through and through with faceless fat guys on the brain all the time. <br><br>Made ahegao faces in almost every chapter focused on her. <br><br>Was the first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What, so the potential Hana x Chiyo bitchfight isn't enough to keep PS going?</br></br>  <br> S.E.X </br>  <br>Not really. We need something that draws in the rest of the USC into the conflict, and creates avenues for Mari, Meiko, and Mayumi's character development as well. Though I'm sure the author will come up with something, maybe a winter event to look forward to. <br><br> I'm sure the wet T-Shirt contest will be the boys put on display for the girls, maybe getting them wet with firehoses and other abuses. </br></br></br>  <br><br>because /a/ is full of retards who think that good things come from dating a crazy bitch</br></br>  Status.<br> Muh </br>  <br><br>kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>That's what I told him but he wanted to argue</br>  <br> Not sticking your dick in the crazy </br>  <br>Part of it is the idea/feeling that Kiyoshi owes Hana something for getting her into all those situations and taking her virginity in all sorts of ways.</br>  <br> Take me out to eat delicious yakiniku. <br><br>She's looking for someone to save her.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah you're right definitely for the marifags (and I don't count the beginning) all they would get is the ass sucking and the one where she told him to take her out to eat afterwards(I think I can't remember) but besides those marifags just added her in just from their own personal choice</br>  <br>Thats some serious mental gymnastics to reach that conclusion. Are you chiyo?</br>  <br>I'm a Marifag and I don't care about her winning the Kiyoshi-bowl. Even better if she doesn't win so I can have her all to myself :^)</br>  <br>Out of all the girls she's got the biggest conflict. Her being naive &amp; innocent conflicts with the fact that she's a huge pervert. That conflict fuels her scenes, making them some of the best that Prison School has to offer.</br>  I have gone back through and couldn't find the reason they started calling the rocket/boat PBR. Was it a Japanese acronym?  <br>It means Pet Bottle Rocket</br>   Watch the first episode <br> It's literally tumblr wish fulfillment <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>How is it tumblr wish fulfillment?</br>  <br>Been there<br>It's not so bad if you're not a beta fag and don't fall for her bullshit.</br></br>  <br>yandere greentext or stfu faggot</br>  <br>What a loser lol</br>  <br><br> Sadistic imprisonment and abuse of men under the pretense that they're disgusting and sexually immoral <br><br>Guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I fully expect not to see Hana nude until the time she and Kiyoshi end up fucking.</br></br>  <br>Well how many girls have we seen naked now allready?</br>  <br>Only coz The Medusa was in the way</br>  <br><br>Here...<br><br>  Ya I'm also a Hanafag, but this pic of her gives me the creeps </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pushing uncanny valley maybe?</br>  <br>K x Chiyo &gt; K x Mari &gt; K x Hana</br>  <br><br>I've seen that the author's art and drawing style changes sometimes. This changes are more noticeable with Hana and Kate.</br></br>  <br>Shut your faggot mouth about our goddess blasphemer.<br><br>All pics of Hana are perfect without exception.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to Utopia?</br>  <br><br>hana is loev</br></br>  <br><br>Dont get me wrong. I really think Hana is best girl in the series. I just feel a lil uncomfortable watching that pic in particular. Prob is because shes king of smiling evilly.</br></br>  <br><br> you will never oroboros with Hana <br> Hana will never pee on your face <br> Hana will never see your mushroom <br><br>why even live</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good, she's a fucking creep.</br>    <br> Closeup of her Medusa <br> Piss on her   marking her as yours <br> Deep kissing <br> Princess carry <br> Double-ended drink <br>   Holding hands <br> Ourobourous <br>The only place this can go is  touching Hana's breasts or wanking off Kiyoshi's dick.   And then the fucking. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn did he rustled your jimmies. First week on 4chan?</br>  <br><br><br>Environment is not friendly to boys. Boys are treated like shit because one woman has daddy issues. They are the protagonists, while council are antagonists.<br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, Queen Mari deserves better than a pleb who does not know what he really wants.</br>  Hana shippers are just losers who are so desperate that they'll settle for getting pissed on.  <br>Pretty sure he only wants Chiyo-chan.<br><br> inb4 butthurt hananiggers </br></br></br>  <br><br>She deserves the only one to equal her in behavior. The only one who can match her at manipulation, bitchiness and overall evil.<br><br> Meiko </br></br></br></br>  <br> only wants Chiyo </br>  <br> inb4 butthurt hananiggers </br>  what do you think about kiyoshi x hana?  <br>Red herring.</br>  <br> it is all for nothing </br>  <br>Set-up for the inevitable heartbreak arc</br>  <br><br>don't say such things, anons</br></br>  <br><br>Why must you hurt me this way?</br></br>  Im a bit worried, since this arc is going to end, what do you think will come next? How Kiyoshi is going to come back in jail for exemple? Will the Wet-Shirt Contest still be the MacGuffin?  <br>Something will happen in his date with the two sisters.<br> I hope in more true Meiko for the next chapters. </br></br>  <br>he sacrificed himself to the utmost for his goals</br>  <br><br>Because the scans are not exactly high quality.</br></br>  <br> date </br>  <br>I'm sure the manga is going to end soon and the last arc will be who Kiyoshi gets with at the end.</br>  <br><br>Wet T-Shirt event</br></br>  <br>every time I see this thumbnail I mistake it for claymore for a second or two</br>  <br>How else should i call it? Btw, is this Gakuto from the anime or just a fan-color?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>That's a weird way to write  Kate__ </br>  <br><br>see<br/></br></br>  <br>you might have had a point if at the end of the first arc the boys grew in power and put dem bitches in their place.<br>but, nope, they're still losers and now they're trying to put queen bitch back in power.</br></br>  <br>Both ouroboros get revealed, maybe piss ouroboros too. Next arc is kate, mari, kiyoshi and maybe hana in jail. council will be a mixed -let's all get along council- with chiyo as prez, meiko, risa and maybe one boy too.</br>  <br> kate, mari, kiyoshi and maybe hana in jail <br><br>Kiyoshi would not be able to keep his beast in-check<br><br> chiyo as prez <br><br>How horrible.<br>The council would not last a year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the council would not last a year <br>it's not supposed to. it'll be the "chiyo reveals she's just as crazy as the rest of her family" arc and this council will collapse too. final council will be boy council.</br></br>  <br> "chiyo reveals she's just as crazy as the rest of her family" arc <br>Looking forward to that anon, She just needs some 1v1 time with Kiyoshi</br></br>   They started school in April <br> Japanese school sports festivals are usually around May or June <br> This whole manga took place in a span of less than 3 months <br>I wish my highschool life would've been this eventful.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, duh. I imagine it'll be like :<br>Both councils fuck up the battle or mari wins<br>Kate, not having something to lose in either case, reveals both ouroboros <br>Neither mari nor Kate can be prez now, we move to chiyo council and kate , mari kiyoshi in prison, but chiyo promises it's just for appearances, things will be better, everyone get along, yada , yada<br>Hana, not wanting to be without kiyoshi and out of being dumb an honest goes "oh, I did ouroboros with kiyoshi too, I should be in prison as well"<br>Chiyo goes ok, calm, then final panel has her eyes turning all psycho.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chiyo goes ok, calm, <br>Potentially ok with a 3way? Anon..  My boner .. Please</br></br>  <br>Read the next phrase. the "Ok, calm" was just a facade, as her genes awaken</br>  <br>Psycho with lust for the idea.<br>Remember she only had a problem with her sister being a slut, not with Kiyoshi being with another girl while close with her</br></br>  <br> final council will be boy council <br><br>The era of Gakuto is close.</br></br></br>  <br>even if chiyo's major issue was with mari, I have trouble believing she was 100% not jealous about mari x kiyoshi</br>  <br> even if chiyo's major issue was with mari, I have trouble believing she was 100% not jealous about mari x kiyoshi <br>Even if it means she's less jelous then normal it could work in his favour. Let me dream anon</br></br>  So the Anime is going to adapt up to the end of the guys in prison arc and end with them being free again, right?    <br>Only place i can imagine them ending it<br> For S1 anyway </br></br>    <br><br>Indeed Gakuto-dono is the best among the boys</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that'd probably be the end frame.</br>  <br>Prez is not different from a feminazi, just another alienated in denial.</br>  <br>buzz cut &gt; metal head</br>  Why did Kiyoshi Warned Hana about kissing her?  <br>Its a point where you know if you cross it you'll kinda just loose your shit and dive into it. like a mini mind break</br>  <br> tumblr wish fulfillment <br> every mans fantasy <br><br>If the wardens were fat lumberjack women with dyke haircuts then I'd agree with you. This show is just fetish fuel if nothing else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They went to prison less than a week in.</br>  <br>not him, but even fat lumberjack womyn with dyke haircuts don't fantasise about being fat lumberjack womyn with dyke haircuts. their fantasy is to look like the usc ,pretty much</br>  Can anyone explain to me what made Andre to recover for that brief period in cafeteria?<br><br>It seems Gakuto knows what was that.</br></br>  <br>It was explained. He saw VPs picture in the underground student council pamphlet.</br>  <br>a picture of the vice president</br>  <br>Either way they wouldn't enjoy Prison School, they'd just explode in anger at the characters being more attractive then they are and how much shameless fanservice there is.</br>  Don't tell me this is going to end with the boys winning, isn't it?<br>That fucking piece of plastic is gonna win like Patrick's rock.</br>  <br>I can kinda imagine that happening and I'm still going to laugh my ass off when it actually happens.</br>  I want the next arc to have new set of boy enrollees, and the current boy's struggle against new guy   underground council wins <br> wet T-shirt still canceled <br> boys will want a revenge and become the ruling body of the school </br></br>  <br>And they try to frame each other so one group gets all the girls to themselves while the other gets stuck in prison.</br>  <br>That would require a time skip.</br>   mfw author makes Kiyoshi get with Chiyo just to piss off all the raging autismals here   So, is the anime good? I marathoned all 183 chapters to prepare myself for the anime.<br><br><br>How do you think they're gonna win?</br></br></br>  <br> How do you think they're gonna win? <br> something happening <br> PBR goes actually airborn <br> somehow tears the opponents headband off </br></br></br></br>  <br> anime <br>It's shit.</br></br>  Is the manga readable or are half the chapters from google translate still?  <br>Too rushed and Ass-man voice is meh but for the rest it's pretty good.</br>  <br>It's readable of course. try on mangapark</br>  <br><br>About what chapter is the anime on now? I imaging 1 chapter could take like 3-5 minutes.</br></br>  <br>they cover 12 chapters so 2 episodes.</br>  <br>They set on 6 chapters per episode which was especially bad in the first episode since the first 3 chapters are 30 pages long.</br>  I want Hiramoto to introduce an recurring outsider character, to add another POV to the characters like a teacher for example. I want to see how that teacher sees the students (established characters), like how he/she actually sees Meiko or Risa.  <br>Those look a lot like JoJo faces.</br>  <br> NTR arc <br>No thanks.</br></br>  <br>I'll try and watch it then, but it's kind of sad it's only gonna get 12 episodes.<br><br><br>I agree. The next arc should be about them making their own respective harms grow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're gonna need another manga for that, bro</br>  <br><br> harem <br><br>There's that word again. A love triangle is not a harem. Literally only Kiyoshi has more than one person vying for his attention, and even that's debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hana and...?</br></br>  So we all agree that the anime is better than the manga right?  <br> author forgets that Prez is a crow whisperer or Joe an ant wanker. </br>  <br>Kiyoshi x Chiyo is canon pairing and Hana tries to steal another woman's man.</br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>There is no canon pairing dipshit. Nobody has acknowledged any feelings and entered an actual relationship.</br>  <br><br>Chiyo, although that aspect is only starting to get prominent. <br><br>For the most part it's been Hana &gt; Kiyoshi &gt; Chiyo.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But Chiyo never showed love for Kiyoshi?</br></br>  <br><br>Remember when the boys were sent to prison for peeping, and later Andre dressed in bondage gear slided into a changing room without consequences?</br></br>  <br> author forgets Prez is a cunt and she gets off easily after kate arc ends </br>  <br>Yea, kate is in power here and doesnt hate men to the extent mari does to put him in prison for that.</br>  <br> every mangina's fantasy <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br><br>Makes you wonder what the SC was doing at the start of the manga.</br></br>  <br>probably fixing leaks on their shitty office</br>  <br> harem arc <br>No thanks.</br></br>  <br><br> no feelings <br>She dressed up as a slut for him when she was jealous of him showing attention to Mari. Hananiggers either in this much of denial or read only parts with their pissing princess.</br></br></br>  <br>That's right...it's only Hana &amp; Kiyoshi, no one else.</br>  <br><br> She dressed up as a slut for him when she was jealous of him showing attention to Mari. <br><br>Go read the thing again, you're completely off mark, it was for her sister.<br><br>It's confirmed when Mari and Kiyoshi try to cheer her up and Kiyoshi goes in the I know you're jealous because of me tirade and she completely misunderstands</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chiyo, possibly prez<br>Hopefully</br></br>  <br>It wasnt for him dumbass, hence why she didnt like any of it and started crying. It was to try what she thought mari was doing. Your asspain is showing.</br>  <br>Why are you having such a hard time comprehending the story?</br>  <br>Shitposters post for shock effect and to derail.</br>  What's going to happen when Hana &amp; Kiyoshi meet again after the festival? Will she finally confess or are there going to some underwear exchanging shannenigans? Are they going to change in front of each other?  <br> will she eventually confess <br>Nah, she had the perfect chance for that and she didn't. She's not going to. Especially after kiyoshi hugs chiyo after the victory.</br></br>  <br><br>Doubt it. He will end pissing (no pun intended) her off somehow, thus planting the seeds for future "revenge" situations. We are heading for a glorious new epoch of borderline h fanservice.</br></br>  <br><br> being this much in denial </br></br>  I don't get ANN. I read their review of the first 2 episodes. Why does it seem like people who review it Prison School negatively have such a stick up their ass? There was another reviewer who complained about the violence &amp; the art didn't match the tone of the comic. The recent ANN reviewer called it trash &amp; 'so bad it's good' as if there's no story to this? <br><br>It's like those who dislike PS can't get past the S&amp;M antics, sorta realistic art, &amp; sex jokes? Is that the case? Is it hypocritical then to watch, read, and enjoy things like porn &amp; action series if you complain about those same elements in this story?</br></br>  <br>I don't believe you read the story. You just gathered whatever info from reading the thread and new what to say in order to incite posters.</br>  <br> reading reviews <br>'sup cancer?</br></br>  <br> Shitposting this hard </br>  <br>This saddens me, but it seems likely. Then again...who knows? She might be able to get one in.</br>  <br>Hana is a third wheel, anon. Let it go.</br>  <br> prison school is shameless fanservice but game of thrones is best tv series ever!! </br>  <br>I don't think she's gonna want to do that? She's come to terms with her feelings now. Though, she does need a reason to see him now. It's either confess or make up something else.<br><br>Just seems as if it's ending soon.</br></br></br>  <br>The problem with hana is that everything is in her hands and she refuses to take a step forward and claim what she wants. I'm pretty confident that if she confessed to kiyoshi after the 69 pee when he was asking her to stay, things would have moved forward. But she had to be cheeky about it.</br>  <br>Yeah, shit like that I don't get. Why is one better than the other? Is it b/c GOT isn't a comedy? That's silly.</br>  <br>She did not "punish" him because he was not a threat to her.</br>  <br>Kate really doesn't give a shit about lewd stuff or peeking in girl's changing room. She probably does it herself.</br>  Am I the only one who's sick of Andre? fatass piece of shit was amusing most of the time and especially in Andreconomics, but afterwards he became the most annoying character in the cast.  <br>She didnt punish him because theres no stupid rule where NO MALE CONTACT WHATSOEVER is enforced when kate is in power.</br>  <br><br>He's completely one dimensional unfortunately, the masochist thing is his only trait.</br></br>  <br>He's best boy.</br>  <br>He did something worse, though.<br>Jo expected to be sent to prison for the same thing.<br><br><br>Of course, she is corrupt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Andre's &amp; Risa's situation meant to mirror Kiyoshi &amp; Hana. Same thing with Chairman's plight.</br>  <br>Wrong</br>  <br>Second best, but still not top-material until he manages to get some ecchi stuff on his terms.<br><br><br> jo expected <br>because he thought the old usc mentality still applied. because his brain was a mess, if you recall those chapters.<br><br> corrupt <br>the phrase you're looking for is "non mentally defective pseudo-prudish, hypocritical cunt"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Andre a shit when compared to Kiyoshi or Gakuto.</br></br>  <br> non mentally defective <br> Dresses up as someone else </br></br>  <br>Yeah, Andre got the fugliest, most unattractive bitch in school, that has to count for a lot.</br>  <br>Andre gets what he deserves.</br>  <br>She just has a crush she admires, that hardly reaches the levels of insanity mari has.<br><br><br>compared to a bottle and everyone thinking you're mr shitpants or trying to ship you with your friends?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>Mari is not insane.</br>  <br>Marihaters will never understand it.</br>  <br> thinks locking up and brutalising people for peeking is an ok thing to do <br> not insane </br></br>  <br>but that's judah shingo</br>  <br>At least Shingo manages to have significantly less screen time. Andre is always doing stupid unfunny shit now.</br>  <br>There are rules.</br>  <br> thinks visual rape is okay </br>  <br>Rules that she agrees with and enforces gladly. Besides, the rules are only in effect because of her, with kate that was over. So, no, still insane.</br>  <br>That doesn't make her insane, you retard.</br>  <br>The rest of the school did not mind looking them up either.<br><br>Kate is just a corrupt cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>*locking</br>  <br>It makes her a psychopath, I'll file that under insanity.<br><br><br>The rest of the school is under her command, she easily convinced them not to talk to the boys either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe's mental stability does not depend on punishment. Kate probably saw the USC's notes on the boys.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but you have to think of the context. The school has been all-girls since its founding, and most of the girls have little to no context with men. They're assuming situation might elevate from something as harmless as peeping to sexual assault. Of course from the information we're given we know it wouldn't happen and the guys wouldn't hurt a fly, but the girls' perception are clearly different from ours.<br><br>I strongly agree that Mari is a bitch who went too far, but there's was a reason for it. It's not like she just decided to lock up the guys and have Meiko beat on them just because.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious , I understand why kate would be a cunt, or even an obsessive stalker, but why "corrupt"? In what way is she corrupt?</br>  <br>Look up the the definition of insanity, dipshit.</br>  <br>That's irrelevant.<br>Her being enough with her assumptions and acting on them to that extent is psychopathy.</br></br>  <br>Worst.</br>  <br>If the word bothers you that much, change it with mental defectiveness, that's the word I originally used anyway.</br>  Like honestly speaking<br> chiyo needs to get BTFO  <br> the MC needs to stop being a pussy and just fuck Hana the best girl already  <br> Andre is a fat shit who's a traitor, I hope he gets stuck with the fugly bitch(lowkey tho she had a cute moment when she was buying the queen gear) <br> shin is a traitor and the worst boy, I think the author should treat him like a pussy whip nigga and give him that one bitch and have him with her all the time and never give them screen time. Just have their names mentioned occasionally. <br> joe is just there I neither like him or hate him. At first I liked him but once he did that gay shit he lost points  <br>  glasses deserves his own harem for how great of a bro he is, but clumsy bitch is good enough  <br>  Kate is lesbian shit tier who should die off after this <br> VP is in the running for best girl, but is out until she turns back to normal  <br> Mari is just there </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you be wrong about everything?</br>  <br>Should've known that you were baiting all along.</br>  <br>Still wrong, psycho.</br>  <br/>  <br>Shingo is sleazy and a shit that I agree.<br><br>Andre was a bro until he lost his mind and MC from start to finish wants Chiyo which is nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what annoys me about hanafags. It's ok to prefer a girl, but usually we have clueless mcs who don't like anyone and have zero romantic interest in the cast, or just like anyone the same and can't choose, this poor fellow from start to till now likes one girl, throwing shit at him because it's not the one you, as a reader prefers is moronic.</br>  <br>It was to expected.<br>That's how shippers think.</br></br>  <br>He's a very likeable mc, how can this mongrels not root for him to achieve his goals is beyond me.</br>  <br><br>The quality of the editing and the translation is really great. Do you plan on doing 183 too? Now that Utopia is gone, we really need someone to pick up the slack and to keep doing HQ scanlations.</br></br>  <br>And Chiyo is pretty awesome too as she shown.<br><br>She is pure,loyal and dedicated.</br></br></br>  <br>They care more for Hana.</br>  Kiyoshi x Mari is the only way.  <br>I'm a Hanafag and I still think Chiyo is a good girl. She needs to be fleshed out but she's not by any means shit.<br>She's not a slut or a bitch and like you said she's pure and loyal, and has actual interests outside of MC.</br></br>  This manga uas fucked up time progress and visualization.<br><br>It feels like years have passed and they are all in early 20s.</br></br>  <br>Next Arc is gonna be where Kiyoshi melt her ice.</br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  Manga became shit as soon as they were released and this thread is a testament.  <br><br>People besides shitposters don't call her a slut and a bitch. People that dislike her, myself included, do so because they find her plain/boring.<br><br>She is not a "bad" choice on her own, but she gets overshadowed by other girls by a large margin. It's not even that they are better developed than her, just that her defining feature is being a nice girl. The manga is built upon outrageous characters and situations, and she provides neither.</br></br></br></br>  <br> outrageous situations <br><br>She created some.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok as long as you didn't disagree with the shin thing<br><br>And yeah he was a true bro I can admit that he was the only trying to save joe, but now he's terrible right now and betrayed his friends for a female.<br><br> I wouldn't mind if chiyo was the best girl or at least was a great character but, <br>  Chiyo is a boring plain person,  <br> makes her own assumptions all the time, <br>  the overly typical deredere type,  <br> and people likes her because anon seems to get attached to the first girl for some reason, proof is look at Sakurafags </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Andre never intended to betray his friends. Risa kept him locked in her room and brainwashed him.</br>  <br> thinking that shin is actually good  <br>  liking chiyo  <br>  thinking Kate is s good character </br></br></br>  <br>I just can't see KiyoshiXChiyo working out for very long. At some point she's probably going to find out about Kiyoshi's lies, and Hana's unlikely to give up just because Kiyoshi is in a relationship.<br> My money's on KiyoshiXChiyo happening only to blow up in his face and turn her into Mari 2.0 </br></br>  <br> The path of the man in search for lewdness is long and full of hardships </br>  <br>Aye that maybe true but until he turns back normal and redeem his self he's the second worst bro (nobody is and can be worst then shin)</br>  <br>I want to sexually mess up Mari. Her crazy expressions are wonderful, especially when she always has haughty expression.</br>  <br><br><br> being hananigger unironically </br></br></br>  Ayy  <br>I don't excuse him, he did unforgivable things. But his motivation is much better than Cassim's(my life sucked except when it didn't and my friend is a better human being than me! Wah-wah!) and the one a part of Al-Thamen had(Oh no! King Solomon made us weaker than we were before! Let's destroy the world!).</br>  <br> tumblr <br> low res </br></br>  <br>Cassim's little sister died because of a negligent government, and that same government was planning to sell its citizens as slaves. He was justified in what he was trying to do (until Alibaba already fixed the situation, and Cassim decided to fuck that up - THAT was full retard on Cassim's part).</br>  Is morgianna still the cutest?  <br>who?</br>  ITT The most badass moments of manga          <br> posting Band-of-the-Hawk scanlations from mangareader <br><br>absolutely fucking disgusting</br></br></br>  New page    Author-made doujin when?      <br>My point it' that K-on used to be a 4koma that got it's adaptation<br>And despite of the love i have for it, the 4koma <br>was horrible, they did a miracle with the adaptation</br></br></br>  Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br><br>EoH to have no paid DLC/Microtransactions.
