Here you go Symphags, I took the pic from &gt;127659218 and made a cleaner version.  <br>It's a weird pose without the logo hiding most of it</br>  Predictions for episode 2?<br> Elfnein saves Hibiki from 2hu beams <br> Tsubasa gets her power sucked out by Phara and she and Maria have to be bailed out by Ogawa <br> Chris fights Leiur alone until Hibiki arrives </br></br></br>  <br><br>That protrusion is starting to not look like a berserk leg to me anymore.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, if you compare it to her boot in the op it's pretty similar just with all of the points exaggerated outward and sharpened.</br>  <br>Pretty sure her other leg is supposed to be there somewhere<br><br>Lewd</br></br></br>  <br><br>You can see her other leg better with this image.</br></br>  <br>Something crazy going on with her scarf. Looks almost like twintails.</br>  <br><br><br>What if it's a Berserk left arm? You know, the very same arm that was bitten off by Nephilim.</br></br></br>  <br>The arm would be very weirdly positioned if that was the case, I'd say.</br>  Don't think it's an arm  <br>It's not that bad positioned. It's shape sure is weird, but not the position, I think.</br>  <br>What a mysterious scarf</br>  <br>Ahh and sure enough you can see her right leg more clearly</br>  <br>I got this shot from the PV, right before the GX explodes over the image. Looks like a leg to me.</br>    I LOVE YOU    <br>I FEEL YOU</br>  Why is senpai so cool?    On a scale of 1 to Nanoha how befriending is this anime?  <br>2 Nanohas</br>   managed to watch ep1 of rokka no yuusha <br> thought I can get free at least for a couple hours <br> suddenly I'm watching the scene from G when Hibiki takes Maria's Gungnir <br> Seiten Galaxy Cross is on repeat </br></br></br>  <br>SYMPHOGEAR/Nanoha</br>  <br>  rokka no yuusha <br>Action heavy or not?</br></br>  I  didn't like Galaxy Cross that much. <br>The trio song in the beginning though, that was the shit.</br>  <br>She has to compensate for Maria's uselessness.</br>  <br> Maria's uselessness <br>Fight me in the parking lot, I'll be there in 20 minutes.</br></br>  <br>At least you tried Maria</br>  <br>I want Maria to lock me in with her strong thighs</br>  <br><br>She'll make a comeback eventually!</br></br>  <br>What expression is that face trying to convey?</br>  <br>Despair</br>  <br><br>It's the "I'm still learning how to draw faces" face.</br></br>  <br> *combines katanas* <br> *moonlights behind you* <br> Pshh nothing personell... doll </br></br></br>  <br>I'll miss her tornado cape. Hopefully Airgetlam will have something equally cool.</br>  <br>It has blue Feito with ass.</br>  <br>She fucking suplexed a plane<br><br>Eat shit Sabin</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say Nanoha. Probably less in terms of quantity, but just as much in terms of quality.<br>Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies, befriending all 4 and giving them all the lesbian syndrome. Add to this 2 big bads (including 1 who went somewhat into the befriended category) and an unknown (very high) number of Noise monsters.<br>Nanoha in two seasons befriended 2 magic users, also infecting both with the gay, 1 big bad, 4 knights and 1 book.<br><br>Between a S2 Hibiki punch and a S2 Starlight Breaker, the raw befriending amount is mostly equivalent, despite having opposite classes (Hibiki is very-very-very-close quarters, Nanoha is mid-to-long-ranged friendship Raising Heart fuck yeah).<br>Both would probably end up befriending themselves. That said, Fate and Tsubasa would probably feel awkward together in the same scene. Hibiki also has the advantage of starting up already in a gay relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies <br>5, if you count  Hibiki's girlfriend. Turns out fighting her didn't cure the gay, either. It made it stronger. </br>  <br>Hibike will fist 2 girls at minimum.</br>  <br> neckbreaking kick that would kill any mortal <br> complains that Tsubasa went overboard </br></br>  <br><br>http://pastebin.com/LZ98npuX<br>3rd one.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the 2nd one?<br>The ED, I'm assuming?</br></br>  <br>The ED is Glorious Break, I have no idea what the middle one is.</br>  I want to eat Tsubasa's shitty cooking.  <br><br>Re-Birth Day is the ED (Ayahi, as usual).<br>Glorious Break was just for ep. 1.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it was just a knockout kick? Watching those streetfight videos made me doubt some of those guys are still alive based on how their head moved yet some were confirmed to be okay at the end.</br>  <br>Wouldn't be the first time she snapped someone's neck with a kick.</br>  <br>She just knocked them out</br>  <br>Is she? I mean, by the standards of the show, she hardly seems to stand out.</br>  <br> That pose <br> I-I'm usefull too! </br></br>   that ED <br>Holy fuck.</br>  Hibiki will fist the two magicians. And the dolls won't survive this season.  Do we know when Glorious Break will be released? It might be my favourite song out of the bunch.

Glorious Break is probably the song Kaneko was saying would be representative of GX's tone.  <br>Yes.<br><br>By Commie: No.</br></br></br>  <br>There's that Chinese one that for some reason has Commie's English subs as an option. You should be able to find it on Nyaa.</br>  <br>Take your Yuropoor shitposting to the GATE threads.</br>  Currently rewatching S1 episodes here and there.<br>I want another peek inside Tsubasa's room.</br>  <br>It was more a joke about Symphogear's apparent disdain for America, but I guess that won't stop people from taking it personally.</br>  I need the OST.

Random OST drop: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qux<wbr>OaclPOSU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Some of the Symphogear creators are big WA fans, though.</br></br></br>  the lossless torrents of S1's music are all kill, and the only direct downloads I can find are executables, which for something that's supposed to be music files are sketch as fuck.<br><br>Any kind anons who can put it on mega or anything?  Or at least the FLAC of Kimi To Iu Oto Kanade Tsukirumade </br></br>  <br>We should make a music pastebin at one point or another.</br>  <br>It should be on BT. I could upload it, but it's 80 MB.</br>  <br>anon just  buy  them. surely you want to support symphogear right? You're not one of those dirty pirates out to ruin nana's lively hood are you?</br>  <br> Some of the Symphogear creators are big WA fans, though. <br><br>There's also shared staff. Like the writer of everything sympho</br></br></br>  <br>I am sure Nana really needs the extra money.</br>  <br>Oh, well I'll be damned, I somehow always manage to forget BT exists. Gonna take a while to download, but that's sure as hell better than nothing. Thanks anon!<br><br><br>Because Kanade's is sold out everywhere</br></br></br></br>  Where are the red and blue dolls?  <br><br>In episode 2, fighting Chris.</br></br>  <br> chris soloing two dolls <br> tsubasa struggling against one WITH Maria's (granted minimal) help <br><br>Sasuga Chris-chan</br></br></br></br>  Did you order the magician?  <br>Chris seems to be fighting Leiur though. Micha and Garie probably won't appear until later.</br>  <br>to be fair maria is probably more of a detriment.</br>  <br> Chino is the final boss of Symphoger GX <br>I see we are destined to not take any other Symphogear antagonist seriously after Fine.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeahlchemists have been known to manipulate the four elements.</br>  <br><br>Both their designs are shit so no.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd order her if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't like hat loli <br>You は shit</br></br>  <br>While I love the "Maria is useless" meme as much as the next guy  except I don't, she's my favorite  living  character , she was shown to be fast enough and skilled enough to fight it, just not strong enough to actually damage/disable it without her GEAH. That said, you could probably sell the argument that the autoscorer was holding back, knowing it didn't need to use it's full strength against an essentially unarmed human.</br>  <br>as much as I love the maria is useless meme as well, I was actually being serious here.<br>2 on 1 doesn't help much when 1 member clearly outclasses the second, and tsubasa doing blade flips all over the place means maria needs to stay the fuck back. maria being there means tsubasa has to keep track of her as well as the doll to make sure no harm comes to maria by accident or if the doll wants to use her as a distraction.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it yellow vs Chris? Red and Blue would probably go for the 2 kids.</br></br>  <br>Knocked out.</br>  <br>I more meant that Maria was show to be fast/agile enough to dodge, meaning Tsubasa wouldn't have to worry about defending her, rather than Maria being of any actual help. Just that she wouldn't necessarily be a detriment.</br>  <br>What if Phara actually has an AoE though? She's wind and those types usually have an area wide attack. She only used it as a barrier against bullets but it's easy to see her also using it all around her forcing Tsubasa to defend Maria.</br>  <br>just because she might be fast enough doesn't mean tsubasa wants to be doing crazy shit near her. and the doll isn't really an enemy you can let your focus stray from. the simple fact that maria is nearby is enough to fuck with tsubasa even if its just a little, and unlike chris or hibiki she can't rely on maria to do anything because she doesn't have a gear.</br>  Maria will be useful. Just awit for it.  <br>I began to watch this<br>just got the ZENBU part and I'm loving it</br></br>  <br>Remember, no survivors.</br>  <br><br>useful for breeding once ver comes out of jail</br></br>  <br>she grows outside being the villain of the week, right</br>  <br>Chris was such a great partially-insane antagonist back then.</br>  <br> once ver comes out of jail <br>I wonder if they ever visited Ver. Whether for reconciliation or the drugs.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear picked up during Bikki's "ご飯＆ご飯" speech for me.</br>  <br>She becomes a protagonist towards the end of S1 and remains as such in S2 and S3</br>  <br>Things were much simpler back then.<br><br>Nehustan+Ichaival Chris was probably the best antagonist of the series. Will Carol beat the record?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She is too moefied though. Like, she's the best when she's fighting. I understand the appeal of gap moe, but I do want more of that side of her.</br></br>   Wanted to post Chris's transformation sequence from Symphogear G <br> It's down due to authors' right <br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>Well, you know.</br>  <br>She becomes  best girl </br>  Tsundere moe blob Chris is best Chris.  <br>She does hold the record for  the most stupid betrayal ever  thanks to S2.<br><br>Watching S1 fully unspoiled makes for a lot of great moments, including pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's the only thing you need,</br>  <br>It's in the official channel anon.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CWD<wbr>zq63AvuM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>The ZENBU part where she switches to Ichaival was incredibly hype. Not sure if Carol can pull it off because she's not as active, but maybe one of the dolls can.</br>  <br>It's important to note that the befriending is slow and painful, making it more compelling than the average.</br>  <br>   the most stupid betrayal ever <br> But it's obvious that that was just so she could get close to Ver and get the cane. <br>Or do you mean that's the stupid thing?</br></br></br>  <br>The hero always escapes from jail eventually, right?</br>  <br>She's shooting death rays at Hibiki in the first episode, how much more active do you want?</br>  <br>I really want her to go sword&amp;board or twohander with Airgetlam for the full paladin mode but knowing Symphogear it will probably be something crazy like giant hands.</br>  <br>I'm hoping the plot point about the FIS girls still needing linker means he has a shot to make an appearance.</br>  <br>She's already carrying Tsubasa's baby.</br>  <br>you guys know they have their own version of linker. ver's wasn't anything that special.</br>  <br>They had linker without him though, it's been in since the first episode.</br>  <br>It was though. His LiNKER was a lot safer.</br>  <br><br> In the Playstation game Wild Arms 2 which was created by the same producer of Symphogear, Airgetlam is a main plot item that basically drove the entire story of that game. In game, Airgetlam is a legendary holy silver sword that grants people immense power and make them heroes to defeat evil, but will drain the wielder's soul to fuel its power. Anyone completely drained of their soul dies and their soul wanders in the lost void forever. </br></br>  Since they accented the Bikkibutt in Bikkies transformation and will accent the ZENBUS in Chris', what will be the focus of Tsubasa's transformation?  <br>kanade's linker wasn't dangerous she was just retarded about it and started fighting without having any in her system.<br>that and she ODed on it like a retard.</br></br>  <br>Ver's LiNKER was much, much better than anything the 2nd Division had in G, and if Chris's words are anything to go by, they still don't have anything matching that.</br>  <br>The flatness of her blade.</br>  <br>Her  sword .</br>  <br>Jamface.</br>  <br>Her  uselessness .<br><br>You knew this was coming anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br>The gothlolis were going to be badly harmed when singing their superb songs but Hibiki absorbed the energy instead.</br></br>  <br>Vagina bones window.</br>  <br><br>His was better wasn't it? Unless I'm remembering it wrongly. If they do go back to the old one, I guess that's interesting too since there's more danger to actually choosing to go into battle and making it more heroic.</br></br>  <br>they just didn't have any linker on hand. I'm assuming the gears don't get called into action that often so they don't carry it around everywhere.<br><br>I don't recall seeing anywhere it said it was better, the linker they used on kanade wasn't bad, she was fighting without it so it fucked her over.</br></br></br>  <br> everything <br><br><br>That's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about S1 though. Even Zoid made the same mistake.<br><br><br>They sure weren't harmed when they hit each other with them near the end of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the most likely. She didn't really have a 'charm point' before, but the vagina bones are a possibility.</br>  <br> that's one of the biggest misconceptions <br>what was it then? I'm pretty sure the keywords explicitly say that it was because of the lack of linker that she died.</br></br>  <br>Her new motorcycle.</br>  <br>It's not related - the lack of LiNKER was because Fine's plan involved both taking the Nehushtan and killing Kanade. She intentionally deprived her of it for some time.</br>  <br> not having linker is not related to her not having linker while fighting <br>anon what the fuck is wrong with you?</br></br>  <br>If Linker deprivation makes you puke blood too like she did in the manga it sure doesn't sound like it's a safe drug.</br>  New episode soon. Let's see how bad is it.<br><br>PV:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<wbr>BDonHeTke1w</wbr></br></br>    Why so negative op? I'm a sucker to a character speaking kansai ben, so I'm gonna watch this for dumpire  <br>on a 12 inch record one of them could have been posted as a full-length 'life size' cover</br>  <br>Just look at Dumon's face.</br>  <br>Jokes on you, I'm looking forward to it.</br>  <br>Who is that qt pure looking girl?</br>  Well looks like they FIXED the eyes...  but I'm still expecting this to be as disappointing as Yamada-kun   How many hours left?  <br>Best part about an Alium figure is that it will be life sized.</br>  <br>2hours and 30 minute</br>  <br>what do you mean? they are the same</br>  i hope at least they get the rape face done right  <br>They released one already. But it was a limited edition or a giveaway from the magazine.</br>  <br/>  <br>as bad as gate</br>  The anime's style reminds me too much of mirai nikki. Hope it turns out good otherwise, been reading the manga since January after an anon posted a thread about it and have loved it since then. Thanks anon   The stream's on neetball, right??   <br>That DownyPire is pefect and that Shiho is good enough, but, Jesus, that chubby sensei is repellent.</br>  I should stop trying to convince myself that it'll be fun.  I really hope that the reason Akane looks so tame in the art so far is so they can catch anime only fags off guard with the batshit insane faces later.    <br>You know, rewatching the PV, I am excited. It does look fun.</br>  Which groups are going to sub it?  <br>CR.</br>  <br><br>Compare and Contrast</br></br>    <br>My brain is too LEWD.</br>  <br>Anime design is much more mature, and less endearing.

Don't try to pull the 'b-but it's unique' card on me. Yes it's a fun series but the art is just bad. The anime doesn't look too good either though</br></br></br>  So is JWWW the Federation Force of /a/?  <br>Why</br>  <br>where you at?</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wx4hq</wbr>  <br>It's pretty good. Most definitely won't be OPOTS, but it'll be pretty high in the rankings.</br>  <br>So this is what it feels like to have your expectations dashed before your eyes.</br>  <br>flipland</br>  I like it. It didn't look bad, the voices are better than I expect, except Dumpire, and the OST is really good.<br><br>Too bad the threads are going to suck because a few people will bitch every second because it doesn't look the exact same as the manga. I hope it doesn't affect the manga threads.</br></br>  <br>I kind of like it.<br><br>For some reason, my first thought was that it feels a bit weird to have a male singer do the opening of a romcom series like this one.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to her right hand</br>  <br> I hope it doesn't affect the manga threads <br>It's been affecting the manga threads for months already, how can you possibly expect them to stop now?</br></br>  <br>The whole point of the "ugly" art is to emphasize the facial features for comedic and emotional effect. This adapation completely ruins that, which is why it's shit.</br>  So, when are we making the petition to cancel this anime?<br>Metroid fans on /v/ made a petition to stop the spin-off which isn't a game they wanted, and it has 50k signatures so far. We can do it too!</br>  Everyone's eyes are just... dead.<br><br>Lifeless.<br><br>This is fucking horrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ONLYANIMEFAGS AND SECONDARIES DETECTED </br></br>  <br>I mean more.

Couldn't even make it through the whole episode.  <br><br>I think all existing fansub groups except Commie have already announced their plan for this season.</br></br>  <br>Other way around. Bottom is old, top is new.</br>  <br>Jokes on you, Christmas was ruined ever since the Panty and Stocking ending.</br>   "just drop it" <br>Thank you, /a/. You've helped me scratch another anime off of my list.</br>  <br>I wish the manga didn't change the MCs design. He had a unique look to him at the beginning.</br>  <br>This is why I'm holding out. <br><br>The artstyle right now looks too stiff when it should be rubbery and loose. Which makes me think that their plan is to slowly transition to rubbery just like the manga did.</br></br></br>  <br>Commie usually picks up a quite a few shows, hopefully this is one of them.  inb4 memes. </br>  <br>I wonder if he changed his art on his own or if his editor suggested it.</br>  <br>You're saying the manga did it on purpose?</br>  Who are those sluts?<br><br><br>He wouldn't fit surroundings</br></br></br>   You'll never get to see her heart violently break animated.   Man this looks bad, why did the author thought this was good?<br>I like moeshit, but this time is no good</br>  <br>Even the pages themselves have monster secrets.<br>This is actually a horror/comedy, not a romance/comedy.</br></br>  <br> Who are those sluts? <br>you made my day</br></br>  What's up with the torrent? It keeps going from 1 mb to 50.0 kbs.  20 seconds in and i can already tell that this is going to ruin the manga.  It's certainly not as bad as this thread makes it out to be, but it could be a lot better. Main gripe besides not following the manga designs, even the most recent ones, was them going too light on the exaggerated reactions. It did get a decent chuckle out of me when Dumpire calls out Asahi on him pretending he didn't see anything, and the quiz thing at the end was pretty good.<br>I'll wait three episodes before deciding on whether or not the anime's worth following, with most of my verdict stemming from how cute anime Alium gets.</br>  <br> was them going too light on the exaggerated reactions <br>Again, the first chapter barely has those. Hell, the anime has more.</br></br>  that was fine <br>what are you autists arguing about?</br>  I'm not entirely satisfied with the first episode, but overall it wasn't as bad as the posts in this thread had me believe. Sure, it's not a 1:1 adaptation of the manga, but in a sense that's good, as if they alter the earlier content and introduce more characters early on, they can get to the better stuff later on. That's a good thing, since even if this is going to be 2 cour (which I doubt), if they did a 1:1 adaptation we wouldn't see Akane (best girl, and her introduction marks the point where the comedy gets good) for several episodes. My only concern in that respect is that I hope they don't try to put an emphasis on the story chapters and skip out on a lot of the comedy.<br><br>I definitely get the criticisms of the choice of VAs above - Shimada was the only one I thought was good at first, but some of the others are starting to grow on me so I'll just accept that it differs from my view of what I wanted and enjoy it as much as I can anyway.<br><br>The anime character designs seem to be fine for the male characters, but pretty bad for female characters. I'll accept them if they manage to capture the expressiveness of the manga's artstyle from later chapters, though, but I'll hold out judgement on that one. Once I got used to it, Shiragami's anime face was fine in the end, but I don't see me ever prefering this to the manga.<br><br>The music was decent as well, nothing special, but better than I'd expected.<br><br>Overall, I'm expecting this series to turn out fine, but not to be an acceptable substitute for the manga. I'll keep up with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just one cour, 13 episodes.</br>  I liked it, The MC having a flaw instead of being a beta is pretty nice.<br><br>Vampire chick seems okay, I really like the ED.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I read the manga too and I thought it was alright, I had a bit of fun with the episode. Not entirely sure about Aizawa's voice and appearance, but it might turn out ok.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself you retarded tripfag.</br>  <br>Oh, didn't realise that had been confirmed, but it was what I expected. Good thing the adaptation isn't a 1:1 kind of adaptation then, else we wouldn't see Akane until about half way through.</br>  <br>Flaw was forgotten in manga as fast as original artstyle</br>  <br> I-I read the maga guys I SWEAR  <br><br>SECONDARIES GTFO.</br></br></br>  <br>But the first episode of Gate was far better than the manga.<br> This however, is not ;_; </br></br>  Decent episode. It's not a masterpiece but it's good enough.<br><br><br>While this is true, the author remembers it from time to time.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone, really did tap this. Probably sedused her with candy, though.</br>  <br><br>Maybe you'll believe me if I voice this complaint. They kind of ruined Mikan, she's best girl and deserved a better seiyuu than what she got.</br></br>  <br> Maybe you'll believe me if I voice this complaint. <br>Don't worry, you don't need to try to convince a shitposter making irrelevant assumption-based ad hominem attacks to fairly unprovocative posts on an anonymous imageboard of anything. Just ignore him.</br></br>  Well that was a fucking entertaining episode, really good. Good job IMS.<br><br> mangafags hating on it non-stop <br>Ease up a little, the episode was good. It made me want to read the manga, so it's fulfilling its purpose.<br>The VA choice was fucking great, the vampire girl's voice was cute as fuck. MC's gimmick was fresh and interesting too. The bro's were bro's and not male side characters for the sake of it.<br><br> muh art style and voices <br>Pseudo-primary mangafags really are autistic, from the looks of manga pages in this thread, it was faithful. The voices are also subjective. because mangafags already have voices for the characters in their heads. They won't be content with any voices that aren't those.<br>10/10 adaptation so far. Will watch more and visit the threads often!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mangafags <br>More like mangafag because it's just one guy shitposting.</br></br>  <br><br>I really just wanted to vent a complaint about Mikan. I actually re-winded to the part where she shows up thinking I might be able to get used to the voice. It's impossible though, she's terrible. The voice doesn't fit at all and the seiyuu is mediocre.</br></br>  <br>This actually bothered me. As far as I can remember, there weren't really many exaggerated faces in the first couple chapters. The fact that they got thrown in because they're more prevalent later kind of irked me. Just a minor nitpick. Overall I liked it, even if it bastardized the art style completely,</br>  <br>She's fine when she's doing the evil queen act but yes, the rest of the time she's bad.</br>  <br>This, this was the only good thing about the first episode. That one short part of the whole scene. The rest was garbage.</br>  <br> More like mangafag because it's just one guy shitposting. <br>Nah, probably between a half and two-thirds of the people in the thread have read the manga, and most of those are expressing dissatisfaction with at least some elements of it. There's only one guy who thinks it's ABSOLUTELY AWFUL WORST THING EVER and is butthurt enough to shitpost in response to anything said, though.</br></br>  It was boring as fuck, thanks for nothing /a/  Welp, first episode done with and I've got to say; neither the fucked up faces, nor Dumpire's missing cleavage, not even Alium's extra girlish voice made me as mad as Sakura and Mikan's voices. Mother of fuck, I heard Sakura had a gay voice but this is bloody ridiculous. Wasn't he a former badass? What the shit? Also Mikan. Oh god, I don't even know what's wrong with it but she has by far the most misfit voice in the entire cast, holy shit.  Just finished watching, and god fucking damn it, they  did a good job with the score, and I was laughing the whole way. Having read the manga I think it's a pretty good adaption and can't wait to see more.   <br>Yeah, they sound like a completely different character from what I had in mind.</br>  <br> and most of those are expressing dissatisfaction with at least some elements of it. <br><br>And this is not a bad thing. I'm a mangafag and I liked the episode but I still have some complaints, but this is normal. No adaptation is perfect.</br></br></br>  <br> 59 Posters when it was streamed  <br> 109 posters now <br><br>Probably more than three<br><br>Probably more than three</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No adaptation is perfect. <br>Yep you're right but this one is more than terrible, even worse than Triage X.</br></br>  <br> And this is not a bad thing. <br>I'm not saying it is, I'm one of them. Sorry if my post sounded a little misleading.</br></br>  Why am I getting vague TRUST ME TRUST ME TRUST ME TRUST ME vibes from the ED?  <br>Shit looked nothing like the manga and some voices sounded weird to me, especially Sakurada. But I enjoyed it, guess I had fun. I know the manga by heart but it cracked me up every single second of it.</br>  I didn't even make it 10 minutes  I suppose it was too much to expect Gintama-tier reactions from the cast but the next episode preview segment was decent in that regard.  At least Dumon was in the OP.  It was ok  <br> But the first episode of Gate was far better than the manga. <br><br/></br></br>  Everyone is so off-model all the time I can't even tell when they're on-model.  OP sucked until this.<br><br>Laughs 1/0 Groans<br><br>Off to a good start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And looked  awful ;_; <br><br> That mouth. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that one single shot gives me some hope for future episodes. The first few chapters were pretty lame, too.</br>  <br> IMS <br>TMS</br></br>  It wasn't that bad  <br><br>Not that guy but I kind of enjoyed how they didn't rush through the invasion really. Not to mention more cheap gore isn't necessary a good thing. I also didn't mind the loli either. It gave a bit more depth to the slaughter of the invasion after the gore was removed.</br></br>   Densei's voice <br>Who do I have to kill to fix this?</br>  Correct me if i retarded. But didnt MC like the robot alien first, even confessed, but after getting rejected by her, after some time fell for Vampire?  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br><br>Seriously. I know there's a VA I had pictured for her already, but I can't find an example.</br></br>  <br> even confessed <br>Got shot down before he even confessed, but yes.</br></br>  There is hope?  This has got to be the most cancerous thread on /a/ right now. I can already tell that these will be the threads to avoid during this season. <br><br>Anime was fine, quit crying you fucking faggots.</br></br>  How long until someone find-replaces all instances of this to My Monster Secret?  <br>But at least the manga gets better, this is an adaptation and that means the same thing as episode 1 is going to happen over and over until the end,</br>  <br>It was just one guy shitposting after the livewatch. The thread got better after HS released the episode and people watched that it wasn't bad.</br>  <br>You obviously haven't been to the NNB thread then.</br>  <br><br>And again, why are you only anime fags so obvious? every single person who's actually part of the oldfags in these threads say this shit is fucking awful.</br></br>  <br> Being this newfag <br> Not knowing about Saekano/Fate/Yahari threads <br><br>Go back to </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuu Kobayashi?</br>  <br>I hope Shima rapes you.</br>  <br> reading comprehension  <br><br>I said they'll be the most cancerous threads THIS season you fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Being new has nothing to do with this, you fucking faggot.

As someone who typically always prefers to read manga regardless of what the source material is, I've never really seen what would be so great about watching the anime adaptation subsequently if it's just going to be exactly the same, chapter for chapter, scene for scene.</br></br>  <br> OFFICIAL SHITPOST THREAD ON /a/  <br><br>We need to post some pepe and spiderman stuff here.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, well meme'd friend.</br>  This was cute as fuck. Glad I'm not autistic enough to read romcom harem shit in manga form, it's always about 20 times better when animated.  <br>I expect a lot of shitposting the first weeks in the Gakkou Gurashi threads with people shouting "The Madoka of this generation" and shit like that.<br><br><br>Yeah, not even Shima deserves that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Rectify" is the word I was looking for.</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot<br><br><br>It's bad, really something just felt off<br><br>Why Animeonlyfag keep saying there is only one guy who was shitposting?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Low quality bait.</br>  <br>You're the one guy shitposting, faggot. <br><br>Do as all a favor and kill yourself.</br></br></br>    <br>this and pretty much anything with the teacher, magical drunkard middle aged woman, the 100 romance failure stories, everything</br>  <br>I like it, her angry voice was fine. But we'll have to see if she can do the drunken voice and Akalyn.</br>  <br/>  <br>Thanks, I didn't have the image handy.</br>  Wasn't this supposed to be a comedy? Where was the funny? That was boring and generic. I'll hold out though in hopes the other characters can save face.  <br> Do as all a favor and kill yourself <br> Doing a favor to an onlyanimefag </br></br>  <br><br>Not the fag you are replying to, I know about Fate and Yahari threads but didn't watched Saekano when it aired.<br>Where Saekano thread cancerous? and how?</br></br></br>  <br>Akalyn isn't going to appear in the anime.</br>  <br><br>You guys really read this shit? Why? It never has a satisfying conclusion, Love Hina taught me this shit years ago.<br><br>Better to wait for the decent ones to get separated out and made to fit an anime time table.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i was one of the guy but i wasn't alone. the disappointement is real.</br></br>  <br><br> onlyanimefag <br><br>Newfag piece of shit get it right you cancer.<br>See </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ebin, simply ebin</br>  <br>True, I forgot it's only one cour.</br>  <br>5 or 7 threads per day full of waifuwars and delusional fags self-inserting into the otaku MC.</br>  <br> I've never really seen what would be so great about watching the anime adaptation subsequently if it's just going to be exactly the same, chapter for chapter, scene for scene. <br>I get your point, though as anime is a different medium to manga, there are things that each can do that the other can't, and the reason why a lot of people want a 1:1 adaptation is so that they can see scenes presented in a different way, in the case of anime vs manga, with sound and actual motion. But I do feel the same way as you in most cases - I'd often rather watch something at least somewhat different from the manga than something exactly the same.</br></br>  <br>It'd need to be three cour for any hope of getting to Akalyn.</br>  <br>The manga starts out generic and boring, it gets better and better as it goes on.<br><br>I wouldn't get your hopes up for the anime though.</br></br></br>  Being disappointed by the show is fine but getting buttblasted it about it is pure distilled cancer. <br>Do we need to employ an Orwelian style language just to keep discussion civil.<br> good plus one </br></br>  <br>What do you expect? mangafags ruin everything</br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br> three cour of this abomination <br><br>Please no.</br></br></br>  <br>a-at least the show was ok</br>  <br> Wasn't this supposed to be a comedy? Where was the funny? <br>The manga starts off fairly weak as a comedy, but it gradually gets better and better until the comedy is consistently very good. I'm not sure how much the anime will live up to the manga in terms of humor, but just wait and see. Oh, and read the manga while you wait.</br></br>  I am fan of manga, was always critical of promo art and how anime adapted design, but now finally watched the episode and can safely tell i dont care anymore.<br><br>AOTS, along with Akagami</br></br>  <br>You don't read it for romance, you read it for comedy.</br>  <br>Anon pls.

The anime designs are 1000x better than the manga.  <br>Fear.</br>  Look into my eyes! Do these seem like they eyes of a liar to you!?<br><br>WEEEN~</br></br>   Mikan's voice <br>You know, they actually handled the scene right before this with Asahi seeing Youko's wings really well, but they had to go and do this right after, didn't they?</br>  <br>Manga's better<br>You're in for a treat</br></br>  <br> We'll never have to see such lewdness animated <br>Thank god, my heart couldn't take it</br></br>  <br>this.<br><br>looking through this thread. the art in the manga looks awful</br></br></br>  <br>Why the hell does this show look like a 2004 digipaint rom-com anime?</br>  Disliked MC's voice<br>Don't fit at all</br>  Yea I thought this episode sucked but then I re-read the 1st chapter, which also sucked. The 1 thing I'm worried about are the reaction faces. I guess since it's anime, they won't do it like the manga but fuck, I hope they do it justice.<br>I also hope the anime keeps adding little scenes like this </br>    Dumbshire's voice makes my penis a 10 on the Mohs hardness scale.  <br> instead of being a beta <br><br>MC is as beta as it gets.</br></br></br>  <br> SECONDARY <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  Anyone got the "exact number" of sales for various volumes as reported by the elevens?  <br>There will never be another Jitsu thread without a ton of shitposters and animeonlyfags</br>  I liked the vampire's voice<br> that Kansaiben </br>  <br>Just wait until the next one, it'll no doubt run out by then.</br>  <br>Make card game webm</br>  I like the episode, though I guess I'll have to avoid the talkback threads for this show.<br><br>People are pretty hyped for Monster Musume tomorrow, right? The PV looked good and I love the OP song.</br></br>  <br>you don't understand<br>people go into threads for the sole purpose of shitposting<br>Do you remember Akame ga Kill?<br>Every time a thread is made about it <br>90% of the posts are "this is shit" the other 10% is waifufagging</br></br></br></br></br>  Dear lord that was pretty bad. I also imagined Dumpire's voice would deeper. But that's forgiveable. However, the characters' expressions make up like 75% of this series' humor, but they fucking butchered it.<br><br>Also what the fuck did they do to Lewdwolf. They completely got rid of her smug.</br></br>  <br> However, the characters' expressions make up like 75% of this series' humor, but they fucking butchered it. <br>Reread the first couple chapters and count how many there are.<br><br>Hell, the anime inserted several that weren't in the manga, but those felt forced.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waifufagging <br>To be fair, AgK was always waifu-fagging the majority of the time.</br></br>  <br>Let's hope anime shitters don't do it to Jitsu wa</br>  <br>I guess I should've clarified. When I meant 75% of the humor, I meant more like the expressions and artwork are a large part of what makes this series so good and what makes people want to follow the series. Not as in the manga itself is just facial expression panels 3/4 of the time..</br>  <br>But first chapters with old artstyle didn't have so many reaction faces</br>  Is /a/ - iddle activities ready for the comeback of Yona?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=srP<wbr>ER56IQjY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime in less than 10 hours </br></br></br></br>  no hype for shoujos  I'm hyped, m8. Red-haired Cinderella sounds interesting  isn't the manga quite good?  <br>i'm hyped, from the PV the animation looks so beautiful and Bones is doing this</br>  Okay, which one of you are responsible for this garbage?  <br>Wrong thread?</br>  <br>PV 2 looks better<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XzX<wbr>LibJm6GE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> comeback of Yona <br>Fuck off and kill yourself.<br><br>Dont compare the gem that is Akagami to shit like Yona. Its like saying Legend of Galactic Heroes is comeback of Legend of Legendary Heroes (not that the Bones will not fuck up the adaptation)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yona&gt;Akagami.<br>By a mile.</br></br>  <br>Its great. One of best political shoujo period - in line of 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Fushigi Yuugi. But its Bones.</br>  Fuck, they should fire that seiyu, her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard.<br><br><br>And I loved the song, you know the song name anon?</br></br></br>  <br>If its on the same level as 12 kindowms then i'm reading this right the fuck now<br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> look! i am newfag for whome yona was babies first "historical fantasy" shoujo <br>Yona is infinitely inferior subpar clone of Saiunkoku Monogatari. Not ever worth mentioning unless you are complete newfag that did not watch anything else.</br></br>  A show that actually looks kind of all around good, yeah fat chance getting anyone here to pay any attention.  <br>I would say that Akagami is bereft of the political intrigue in these manga and is hence fundamentally different. There is little lingering conflict and things are a bit more sedate. Still a fun read.</br>  <br> political <br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>It is OP theme of the anime "Yashashii Kibou" by Saori Hayami <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3so<wbr>7XzFbmD0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>There is plenty of political intrigue. Its just the MC does not suddenly become minister of state or something like that having all centuring around her. She is support for Zen, who in turn is pawn of his brother. They get involved in lots of political stuff, just not always on first roles.</br>  Aw man, I was expecting some heavy feels with this, but MC girl basically falls in love with the guy after the first chapter.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Why is that bad?</br>  <br>She is not really anon, they are just friends.</br>  <br>Well, things are clearly not as sinister, complex or heavy in Akagami. It is nevertheless a very comfy manga, but clearly departs from the themes explored by 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku and even Yona.</br>  <br>There is no struggle with romance - they love each other and its a fact. The problem is that she`s a simple medic and he`s a prince - there are all kind of problems approaching her to him without causing trouble.<br><br><br>i`d say its very near to Saiunkoku in premise. As far sinister goes - there are assassination plots, plague, war, pirates kidnapping, court intrigues etc. Though indeed, it did not result in anything truly tragic and drastic yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. They become best friends before any actual romance happens. I kinda like how low-key their relationship is, they just realize they want to be together and it all happens without any misunderstandings or other typical shoujo bullshit. It's refreshing.</br>  <br>They declare their love in a forest and kiss anon. Come on, I've read this, don't pull shit out of your ass.</br>  <br>this is the best kind of romance</br>  <br>Because of Ore Monogatari.</br>  <br>WHAT the fuck does this have to do with Idle Activities?</br>  The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki.<br><br>I get it, she`s cute, nice and has unique hair - but there are two prince ready to marry her, people easily influenced by her right after meeting her etc.<br><br>Though manga does good by showing other side too: some people clearly think little of her, some just consider concubine approached so Zen could play with her, some trow hard checks if she`s worthy and can survive the environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. The author even takes a situation that is usually milked for MISUNDERSTANDINGS and drama, and has the female MC just go "Oh, I thought there was probably an explanation for it."</br>  <br>Akagami thankfully does not limit itself to two lovebirds staring each others for dozen chapters. There plenty of stuff happening.<br><br>Hell, the manga even took the most risky turn for shoujo at all - separated them for years.</br></br></br>  <br> litterally EVERYONE <br>Why can't Ameriburgers figure out how to use "literally" correctly?</br></br>  I was reading the first Volume ages ago in a local bookstore, honestly it was pretty fucking neat. Looking forward to the Anime, hoping for some comfy medieval adventure time maybe like a road trip.  <br>I wouldn't say everyone falls for her. Just Zen, Raji, and Obi. And Obi wants Zen's dick, too, so whatever.</br>  Is this 12 ep long or 24?  <br>Why do i get this feeling i've seen this on sadpanda<br>God i hate when this happens</br></br>  It's one of the shoujo manga I'm reading (bc I'm very picky with shoujo and I don't read many) so I'm very hyped about this adaption even though I'm not a big fan of the character design.  <br>Nothing really happens in this version, though. She didn't jump to any conclusions and readily accepts the explanation given.</br>  <br><br> local bookstore <br>You japanese?</br></br></br>  <br> literally <br> 1. in the literal or strict sense <br> 2. in a literal manner; word for word <br> 3. actually; without exaggeration or inaccuracy <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually <br>http://dictionary.reference.com/bro<wbr>wse/literally</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, german. There've been Manga departments for I don't know, 10-15 years in the stores for now ? Sadly most of it is Yaoi or BL stuff since this shit sells to the female teenage crowd like crazy.</br>  <br> her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard. <br>At first I was like you but then it grew on me, now I like the VA for Kiki.</br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-06/snow-white-with-the-re<wbr>d-hair-anime-to-have-2-split-season<wbr>s/.90118</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Nice. I still dont trust Bones until i see it.</br>  <br>Exactly, you're using the word wrong. Saying literally everyone is in love with her would mean characters such as Kiki is in love with her as well, which is blatantly untrue.</br>  Why do I always turn into such a fag when I read stuff like this?  Its a manga where all characters chatter "when will they finally fuq?" behind MCs back.<br><br>In before Zen`s brother actually set`s a demand that if Zen wants to marry Shiroyuki, he needs to make an offspring.</br></br>  People will pick it up for Shiroyuki and stay for Kiki.  Obi reminds me of Hak, forever a cuck.  I can't believe a Shirayuki-hime thread actually took off for once.<br><br> in b4 only 18 posters <br>Still better than usual.</br></br></br>  <br>is shirayuki hime the new argevollen</br>  <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually </br>  <br>I don't know what that is, so probably.</br>  <br>Because you are a fag</br>  <br> idle activties </br>  <br><br><br>Akagami has been translated up to the latest volume in chink. Pity my local Kinokuniya wraps them in plastic. At least each volume costs about 5 bucks. Might buy once completed.</br></br></br>  <br>They did great with Ouran</br>  <br> If its on the same level as 12 kindowms <br><br>it's not, it's boring. 12 kingdoms &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this shit and yona</br></br></br>  <br>Nah that is because she is close with Zen, people wants to know what kind of person she is. And Raji already falls for her since the beginning</br>  <br>Still untrue in context with the story. It was a big exaggaration, no matter how you try to defend it.</br>  <br>I just realize that Zen's brother is voiced by Akira Ishida</br>  <br>No, because argevollen was genuine boring trash.</br>  <br>You are the one who pull shit out of your ass. There is no declaration of love or kiss in first chapter.</br>  <br>I was not talking about the first chapter, but the ones that follow.</br>  <br><br>What is it with red haired heroines that tugs at the sense of fantasy, romance, and adventure?</br></br>  <br> The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki. <br><br>If she's going to be a character like Snow White, a Disney-tier "princess", it hedges closer to the material that everyone falls for her.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> political </br></br>  <br>Snow White/Cinderella are shit character types. Those are plain and dumb persons that through miracle gets everyoen loving them and attention.<br><br>Shiroyuki is the opposite type - the hard working one, the capable: the one that has to prove all the time she deserves the place she is at.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> not political </br></br>  Please cover the entire manga, please cover the entire manga. I'm resisting the urge to read this so I can get the best possible experience.  <br>Its two cour, but i doubt it`ll cover entire manga (its still ongoing).<br><br>Saiunkoku Monogatari was 75 episodes long, and it still did not cover the whole novels, stopping at most interesting stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga will be inevitably better than anime. So it is worth reading before/during/or after anime regardless.</br>  <br> Its two cour <br>Thank you based BONES</br></br>  <br>That makes me really excited for the show, please let it be a good adaption.<br><br><br>Although I really liked the drawing style of the few pages I've seen so I might read the manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Hopefully they'll get to adapt the kidnapping arc. Threads about it gonna be hype.  Sexual intercourse confirmed.  Delayed with days thanks to Funi.  <br>You're kidding me, it says 4h 53m in anichart.</br>  <br>I see, you are new as shit.</br>  <br>Sasuga Funi. Raws it is.</br>  <br>Mondays will never have good anime.</br>  <br> nnb <br> not good </br></br>  <br>It is really not.</br>  <br>anichart is the time it airs in Japan, the subs are delayed by Funi</br>  Maybe someone will sub it instead of waiting for Funi. Maybe.  <br> looks so beautiful  <br> and Bones is doing this </br></br>  <br>They just kiss anon, you never kiss like that, didn't you?</br>  <br>Yes. Get hype.</br>  <br>Have faith in Ando</br>  <br>How delayed? If it's just a two or three days I guess waiting is fine.</br>  <br>Let's hope for the best, anon.</br>  <br>Fuck you Funi</br>  <br>Good</br>  <br>Fine. It's political but without actual politics.</br>  <br>But it's not. It's generic sure as far its premise goes, but its execution is overall decent. One of the better mecha series last year and I liked it far more than the rest.</br>  <br>I'm okay with raw, since we have the translated manga so can at least understand the scenes.</br>  <br>How many days? Where are you seeing this</br>  <br> summer is only a meme </br>  <br>Funi has barely subbed new shows so far, Chaos Dragon, Dandellion and Logos's subs still aren't out yet.<br><br>Anyone who wants to catch the live streaming of episode 1<br>It is in 3 hours 22 minutes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda wish I'd understand Moon now.</br>  <br> not being able to watch stuff just fine <br>Having seen almost no anime must feel bad.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you Funi. They always do this every season.<br><br><br>I will try and watch it, unless I have stuff to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet they released Game of Laplace on time and they did it by announcing it the very day it aired. In fact, every time they announced a simulcast release they did it on the same they it was released. So I wouldn't count out Akagami from being released today just yet.</br>  <br>I try to avoid stuff that only consists of the usual boring phrases that are repeated endlessly in 90% of the shows. I usually don't even watch stuff that's still airing but this show has picked my interest.</br>  <br>Thanks for your normalfag anime blog. Where do I subscribe?</br>  <br>Do you do anything besides shitposting ?</br>  <br> s-shitposting <br>  ? <br>You should go back to reddit, friend.</br></br></br>  <br>So you don't.</br>  <br>Maybe it depends on distributor, i hope we gets Shirayuki-hime fast too because it is Warner Bro.</br>  <br>huh. since when was shirayukihime any good? i only read it when it first came out. it didn't make that much of an impression.</br>  This is nothing like Yona; this is laidback, slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression.  What's the point comparing Yona and Akagami?<br>Both of those are  fun   in a different way.  At the very least it's not the usual shoujoshit. Still a snore-fest sometimes though. </br>  <br> slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression. <br>I have to disagree with you, they just don't make drama out of that and the manga is actually pretty funny too</br></br>  Which is better, this or Yona?  <br>I like this better</br>  While I get why people are comparing this to Yona, it's more like Horimiya romance and pace-wise than Yona, in my opinion. <br><br>The fantasy and political background is of the same vein as Yona but the way the story is told is more slice-of-lifey, non-dramatic like Horimiya. <br><br>Yona's a tad more dramatic than Akagami. It's both good and bad. People might say it's boring because there's really no drama when it comes to Shirayuki and Zen's relationship. There's no third party trying to interfere (Obi's in love with both Shirayuki and Zen and has no intentions of ever breaking them up), Izana's on the Zen x Shirayuki wagon after quibbling a bit and that's only because he wanted Zen to be absolutely sure Shirayuki's who he wanted, Kiki and Mitsuhide have a lovely side romance going on.<br><br>Honestly, it's just a really comfy slice-of-life of royalty with a splash of political and medical/pharmaceutical issues. <br><br>Plus, I'm a sucker for big brothers who dote on their little brothers. Izana and Zen are good siblings to each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the low-key drama makes dramatic moments stand out that much more - the MC isn't constantly having to deal with attacks on her life, so the one time she gets a warning crossbow shot (with helpful description attached), it's more of a big deal.</br>  <br>Got any proof?</br>  First episode in 1 hour<br><br>neetball will stream it</br></br>  <br>What about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, could it be compared to that?</br>    <br>I guess it's just an assumption that Funi simulcast will be delayed like some of their series and Funi still hasn't announced the schedule for this.</br>  <br> Mentioning Fushigi Yuugi at all </br>  <br><br>Fuck is the main guy the "I always fight with my sword's scabbard on cuz I'm that good hurr" guy?</br></br>  <br>Definitely. Probably even more than Horimiya, considering the setting. The MCs in Akagami are probably just a little less dramatic than Soredemo. Really, Zen and Shirayuki are probably one of the most drama-free couples I've come across. I don't know about the future but up to the most current chapter, they've never even had a disagreement that's threatened to break them up. I tend to like my romance drama free so it's probably why I rate them high (along with Horimiya's MCs).<br><br>Story-wise, both Soredemo and Akagami deal with royalty. Soredemo's probably more political, what with the main lead the actual king of a country while Zen's just the king's younger brother.<br><br><br>Shirayuki deals with the attempts on her life nmuch better than I would. But then, she's a lot calmer than me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like  that midget. </br>  <br>When Zen fights for real, there's no scabbard. It's not that kind of series where he shows off his sword skills. He's a prince. Everyone expects him to be that good. He HAS to be that good or his brother would confine him to the castle at all costs.</br>  <br>I think it's more "I only draw my sword against equals, not commoners like you". Snobbery based on status, not skills.</br>  <br>they are not tsunderes</br>  <br>Not really. He kills random pirates, presumably. It's not like he fights people all that often, though.</br>  In honor of the first episode, who are your five favorite characters?<br><br>1. Izana<br>2. Zen<br>3. Shirayuki<br>4. Kiki/Mitsuhide<br>5. Obi/ Ryuu (the pharmacy guy)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure about that? It's still offline.</br>  <br>It's tough, since I ended up surprisingly charmed by all of them in the end. But let's see.<br><br>1. Kiki<br>2. Obi<br>3. Zen<br>4. Shirayuki<br>5. Ryuu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 5 <br> Forever slavezoned. ;_; </br></br>  <br> In a perfect world, he could finagle a threesome. </br>  <br>No love for Mitsuhide? But the bromance.</br>  <br>scroll down there are two links there choose one as you like<br><br>It will start in 25 minutes</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice lists, MAL brothers.</br></br>   only Funi <br>Who will save us?</br>  <br>I like Mitsuhide just fine, but he doesn't quite make my top 5.<br><br><br>Fuck off, people make rankings in threads all the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You. </br>  https://twitter.com/atarime738/stat<wbr>us/617660881711665153<br><br>Akagami main animators: Shigeru Fujita, Tsunenori Saito and Takahiro Komori. <br><br>I guess this show gonna have good animation, at least for 1st ep.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>And every single time they are cancerous brats like you.</br>  <br> cancerous brats <br>I'm just talking about a show in a thread about that show. Calm down.</br></br>  <br>Do it without acting like a landwhale tumblrite on her blog.</br>  <br>Oh the irony.</br>  <br>I'm utterly bemused as to why you're so mad.</br>  <br>Ignore the retards who seem insecure in their ability to talk about the characters of a show in the thread of that show. The paranoia is real.<br><br>Anyway, I still can't believe Ryuu makes it to your top 5 over Mitsuhide.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you make a top 10 shoujo series recommendation list for the good children on /a/ next? Even better, you can make a super cool youtube video for everyone else too!<br><br><br>You can do that without making retarded fangirl lists.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You seriously have issues, anon.</br>  <br>Should have used greater than signs. He wouldn't even have noticed you were making a ranking list that way. Hell, he's probably done it before himself.</br>  Both Yona and Akagami are boring. Pic related IS the shit.  neetball still offline?<br><br>It starts soon in 4 minutes</br></br>  <br>I really like the Yona manga. It's not quite 12 Kingdoms Level, but it definitely shocked me when I expected it to be some fantasy shoujo and next thing I know people are getting decapitated and shit.</br>  <br>I think you're right but it's pretty amazing how retarded a numerical list makes people stupid.</br>  <br>Basara was really good but the dumb Red King's identity stuff was drawn out pointlessly.</br>  <br>Oh hey, thanks for the rec.</br>  <br>Well shit, thanks for reminding me that I still have to remove that one from my backlog.</br>  <br>I like all the fantasy shoujo mentioned in this thread. Now what?</br>  Any good list of readable fantasy shoujo stuff?  <br>U se brute force called google. </br>  It is on douyu  <br>All these years later and I still prefer From Far Away or even Red River/Anatolia Story to Basara.</br>  <br>Oh look, it's that one idiot prince.</br>  <br> link? </br>  Basara: very good<br>Red River: decent, the final arc is fucking awful<br>Meteor Methuselah: decent, fairly shounen-ish<br>Kanata Kara: Inu-Yasha done right, good art</br></br></br>  <br>Just search the archive. Starts with m.</br>  <br>Is it laggy as fuck just for me?</br>  Futakuro thread: <br><br>http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>725300.htm</wbr></br></br>  <br> http://staticlive.douyutv.com/commo<wbr>n/share/play.swf?room_id=5275</wbr> </br>  <br>Red River would climb a lot in my list if it wasn't for that fucking boring, pointlessly drawn out final arc in which neither the main girl nor the prince guy love interest do fucking anything. The manga peaked in the big battle against Ramses in which MC leads the army against Egypt.</br>  <br>Mine works just fine</br>  Oh shit cutting hair  <br>Kanata Kara<br>Red River<br><br>Two best shoujo ever</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do very selective rereading for that very reason.</br>  Is it me or was the way in which MC was drawn in Red River lewd as fuck? The manga had some decently hot smut for a shoujo.  <br>Izark a best, Noriko a cute.</br>   no one has announced they are fansubbing it   The animation looks weird.  <br>He has a point, his only mistake is still visiting this shithole after it got infested.</br>  <br>I think it looks nice</br>  So this is the OP, huh? Pretty nice, feels comfy  Gross, 3DPD in my anime  Damn, Bones sure didn't skimp on production values. Looks promising so far.<br><br><br>I've been here since 2007, my brother.</br></br></br>  Damn, I'd forgotten how much of an idiot the idiot prince was at the beginning. At least he got better. That's character development for you.  I totally forgot this aired today. Looks like I'm better off waiting for subs.  <br>There is precisely 0 hentai of this series, except maybe one yaoi pic.</br>  <br>Aside Funi, no fansub group said they are going to sub this.</br>  <br>I'm not surprised. There's literally zero fanservice in the manga. Not even a random character with big tits.</br>  <br> waiting Funi </br>  <br> Aside Funi <br>Fuck. Looks like I'm better off just downloading the raw then.<br><br>I don't really keep up with who does what.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's a manga for girls.</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wwny0</wbr>  <br>This confused me so much at the end of the episode. At first I thought there was suddenly a huge flash forward.</br>  <br>Decent enough. The song sounds like it's more suited for the ending rather than the opening though.</br>  So who is the king? Not that dark guy, right?  <br>Wait why split cour for this of all things, like it even looks really low budget</br>  <br>that is just the manga CM</br>  <br>The king's dead.</br>  If anyone cares, episode 1 is out on Funi site.<br><br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/sno<wbr>w-white-with-the-red-hair/videos/of<wbr>ficial/encounter-changing-the-color<wbr>-of-fate</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I know, doesn't make it less disgusting</br>  <br>Did you watch it? It didn't seem low budget at all.</br>  <br>Maybe they couldn't handle doing it all at once? BONES has a shitton of shows coming up, including the ever delayed Kekkai Sensen ending.</br>  <br>Oh so they did get it out on time</br>  <br> The song sounds like it's more suited for the ending rather than the opening though. <br>There will never be a "wait why is this the OP and that the ED" case as big as Sora no Woto's</br></br>  <br>Except it very clearly is, movement is so freaking slow, choppy, and generally not fluid. it doesnt even look like a bones show especially compared to the stuff they were doing in kekkai. Granted to be fair this is Bone's C-studio making this, same people who made chaika so you cant expect much</br>  <br> hurrdurr can't expect much from Bones studio C <br><br>Except they did Darker Than Black and StarDriver</br></br></br>  <br>Just you wait<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wub<wbr>VtyKQ1is</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Waiting for someone to rip it</br>  <br>The king is alive, they just use the title of 'king' regardless of gender.</br>  <br>How long do these usually take to rip?</br>  <br>yes, it is fast.<br><br>but it seems HS doesn't know it is out yet</br></br></br>  <br>He's not, though. That's why Izana gets the crown later, wasn't it?</br>  <br> compared to the stuff they were doing in kekkai <br>Kekkai Sensen looks ugly as fuck and the animation wasn't anywhere near great, first episode withstanding.</br></br>  <br>Notice how he says gender withstanding. There's a queen, but she gets referred to as the king here.</br>  <br>It's supposed to be automatic but for this first episode we're at the mercy of HorribleSubs realizing it's out, unfortunately.</br>  Here I thought Ushio to Tora would be my AOTS, but this is just gorgeous looking.  Someone please go tell HS to rip this already  Anyone knows HS staff please tell them the subs are out  <br><br> wanting terrible Funi release </br></br>  <br>No other choice anon</br>  <br>Quit talking like you can provide other alternatives. If you can, do. If you can't shut the hell up.</br>  is this garbage anything like an atelier game  <br>There's an alternative.<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08645</wbr></br></br>  HS staff just posted an update<br> Akagami no Shirayukihime will be released in like an hour or so </br>  <br> Tokyo MX raw <br>I will only use them as last resort because raws from that channel are mostly even more eyecancer than Funi video now</br></br>  <br><br>Totally not retarded babies that came here yesterday.</br></br>  Holy fuck, prince Raj is funny as fuck.  Raj best boy.  <br>"no"</br>  Mitsuhide sure got the short end of the stick when it came to character design adaptions. <br><br><br>"Press esc to exit full screen mode".</br></br></br>  <br> Bone's C-studio <br>Isn't it B Studio?</br></br>  <br>C Studio animated Star Driver, Darker than Black, FMA.</br>  Bones studios all produce good and bad shit.  HS is out  <br>Here's your reply<br><br> it looks great </br></br></br>  <br>It looks good. Especially compared to that other shoujo that started this season.</br>  <br>Which Bones studio did kekei sensen? Because that was full dogshit from start to finish.</br>  <br>Which one? Aoharu?</br>  <br>Yeah, Aoharu.</br>  <br>That's shounen.</br>  <br>Studio D.</br>  <br>Oh it is? Thought it was shoujo based on all the antics that went on in the first episode. My bad.</br>  How are the subs? Funi's shit varies too much.  Just watched it.<br><br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>Profound.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Manga is the greatest love story ever told, can't wait for this to be shit.  <br>I love 12 kingdoms and Yona. Saiunkoku was a snorefest. I tried hard to like it.</br>  So, did Bones fuck it up?  <br>No, it's great.</br>  <br>Thats what people were telling about Chaika at first..</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uwJ<wbr>9QWtKB7o</wbr>  [ ]  <br>It might surprise you but I can't see the future so it's possible Bones could screw up again. Right now, they haven't.</br>  <br>It was pretty good actually. A very straightforward adaptation with some minor tweaks here and there, mostly to give Shirayuki a bit more screen time and to set the mood. The animation was pretty standard fare with a few really nice moments like Zen bursting into Raji's room.<br><br>Not mind-blowing or anything but better than expected, and definitely worth watching if you're into the manga.</br></br></br>  I hope we get a lot of fanart about the MC preparing medicines.  https://d.maxfile.ro/gdweumbikw.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  It was alright, Felt like I was watching a Disney film though.<br><br>The visuals seem really high quality with the classical music.<br><br>Will watch for Saori.</br></br></br></br>   Already read the mango 2 times <br>Damn, I lost all the motivation to watch this</br>  The episode + ED would have been an amazing single episode OVA.  <br>Wasn't this is pretty much intended as a one-shot until the publisher decided to extend it?</br>  <br>Literally what is the point of these webms</br>  <br>I read it on /a/ but I don't know if it's true.</br>  Shirayuki's VA is perfect. It's exactly how I imagined she would sound like holy shit.  Characters dont look quite in manga, so no sense of instant familiarity appears that one would`ve like.<br><br>But i have to admit, it barely matters, since Bones surprisingly did great job and the show looks great and good on itself, way over the meager expectations i had (hopefully the quality continues past episode one).<br><br>I have to say its not Shirayuki, Zen etc. i know - but i am glad to learn them anew and sure will enjoy the show and continue to enjoy manga. <br><br>Anime is entirely own product, even if it cant transmit some thing of the manga beuty - it adds a lot of its own.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep on hearing Shinoa from Owari, I'll have to get used to the lack of smug.</br>  Normally don't care for shoujo or romance but this thread has convinced me to try it, how political and dramatic does this get, I can't really tell from reading the thread.  <br>The Disney like setting helped get over the smug image quickly</br>  <br>What? The characters are just like their manga counterparts.</br>  <br>I felt like sawashiro would've been a good fit, but this isn't too bad either.</br>  <br> How political <br>Not too political since the main problem is that the dude is a prince and the girl is just a doctor. <br><br> How dramatic <br>Thankfully not that much since the prince has common sense to clear up and misunderstanding same goes for the girl who also has common sense<br><br>All in all it's a comfy love story</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All in all it's a comfy love story <br>Did you even read past first chapters?<br><br>What you posted is nonsense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sawashiro should have voiced Kiki.</br>  <br>I read up to the latest. It's pretty fucking comfy despite the kidnapping and other shit that happened.</br>   shameless fanservice <br>dropped</br>  I cant wait for the  early as fuck kiss  to be animated  <br>And to add to that, Zen was pretty fucking based when he saved Shirayuki from the pirates</br>   character development in the first 5 minutes <br><br>DROPPED<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, kiki's as deadpan as it gets, to the point I couldn't even think of a suitable seiyuu for her.</br>  <br>What? I don't remember the kiss being early as fuck. More like wait till the second half if you want to see them kiss.</br>  Well that felt a lot like an OVA  <br>Considering shoujo manga (atleast the ones I read) it's pretty early.</br>  Raj is best girl. I hope anime only fags will not hate him and wait for him to get good.  This heroine is ridiculously proactive.<br> prince's concubine? <br> nah fuck that shit, let me pack up my things and skedaddle out of here <br> this guy doesn't believe that I want to patch him up? <br> here faggot I hit and healed myself, am I trustworthy enough yet <br> slaps the prince <br>This girl has more balls than most male leads.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mitsuhide looks weird for some reason  Do you think we'll get an anime original ending? <br><br>This manga feels like it's going to go on forever, and it's monthly too which is killing me.<br><br><br><br>That's how a lot of manga get serialized so it could easily be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy you're in for a ride, she is pretty freaking badass in her own right.</br>  <br>Think on the upside, it's monthly. It used to be bi-monthly.</br>  <br>That's her character She's hardworking and proves all those that doubt her position wrong. She's really cool, this archetype is always the best. <br><br><br>I dropped the manga because I couldn't stand the wait. It's why I want a really nice conclusive ending they can retcon if they need to make new seasons  which is unlikely </br></br></br></br>  By the way, is this normal medieval or will there be fantasy elements? Are there non-human races or magic or is this a simple, no-bullshit setting?  This woman knows her place.  <br> if they need to make new seasons <br> Yona had the yellow dragon in the OP/ED from the very beginning <br> he only joins in the very last episode <br>I felt cheated.</br></br></br></br>  That orchestral OST makes it feel like an old Disney movie.  <br>Normal medieval with Alchemy (and other scientific magic scholars study)</br>  Are we getting anything aside from Funishit?  <br>There'll be  glowing flower related incident. <br>Is it count as normal?</br></br>  Shirayuki a cute  <br> Alchemy <br>Don't you mean PHARMACY?</br></br>  <br> Same shit. At the very least let me think that way, I want my atelier related anime. </br>  Are they getting American money from Disney or is this just ridiculously high Budget  <br>But it already exists.  Arland anime when? </br>   palace illuminated at night with magic light <br>fuck you, Bones! Dropped!<br><br>Shirayuki and co are still in process of inventing the lights. And even if were inventeed, surely the spare stock they have woudnt be used for Disneyland illumination until they have industrial production of it.<br><br>There is no "magic electric light" in Shiroyuki world, thats kind one of important plot points since they are trying to create one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alchemy was them trying to turn shit into fucking gold but ended up creating science. <br>Pharmacy was not the official name back then but Herbalism was.</br></br>  <br>Not enough.  I want Iris adaptation. I think I have shit taste. </br>   Character development in the first episode <br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br>  Blue haired boy is best boy   /a/ watching shoujo <br>I want tumblr to leave.</br>  <br> inb4 anime original ending <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ;_; </br></br>  <br> There is no "magic electric light" in Shiroyuki world, thats kind one of important plot points since they are trying to create one. <br>Anime original confirmed?</br></br>  <br>Aside Commie, I think all existing fansub groups have already announced their plan for this season so I don't know if they are going to add this series to their plan.<br><br> mfw almost all series which are simulcasted by Funimation this season aren't picked up by any sub groups. </br></br></br>  <br>Weak bait.</br>  <br>But /a/ wants you to leave<br><br><br>Atleast we'll get to see the kiss animated</br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely Bones not paying attention/research while making this ED. Persons drawing it probably did not even read the manga.<br><br>Or you can pretend this shot is from future, where they successfully perfected light stones and now they are used everywhere like light bulbs.</br></br></br>  <br>ebin</br>  <br>Yeah it happens relatively early. <br><br>Do you think the second cour might by completely anime original?<br><br> I don't actually remember anything that happens after the kiss. </br></br></br></br></br>  That works too but I feel it's rather unpopular to get it's own adaption.  <br>Technically the official name for herbalism today is pharmacognosy more than pharmacy in general.</br>  <br>meant for <br/></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Huh? Isn't that just fire, they're not cavemen</br>  For attelier fans, the only interesting ark is Royal Pharmacist exams - since it`ll have lots of alchemy and "herbalism".<br><br>She`ll gather stuff and produce and research medicaments in most other arks as well, but only this ark looks like straight from Attelier game.</br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly it's the trip back to her home town and then she gets kidnapped. It's a pretty long arc so i'll doubt it will be animated. How many episodes for this one again?</br>  <br>This whole episode felt like a shameless fanfiction written by El Elf.</br>  First episode was pretty great. I was afraid that I might not like the animation bc I am so used to the manga's art but surprisingly it was easy in the eyes.<br><br>The seiyuu cast is spot on though when I first heard Shirayuki's voice I was thinking of Shinoa.<br><br>Also,<br> that adorable ryuu studying <br>my heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The current ark of the manga is about Shiroyuki and co researching a light source by using a rare plant they encountered before and the crystals. <br><br>They dont have effective means of long illumination in their world - no gas lamps, no electricity. Most illumination is torches and candles.<br><br>On screen you obviously see artifical spectrum light from crystal like things (pretty much what they try to do). Especially the small round lights on the walls between windows cant be torches or anything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's pretty much impossible, but hey, man can dream, right?</br></br>   Why do I find Zen so attractive   <br> /a/ watching magical girl show <br> /a/ watching childrens card game <br> /a/ watching idol show <br> /a/ watching boku no pico <br><br>welcome to /a/. if we were tumbler we would be arguing over something stupid like how there isn't enough transgender black people in Naruto</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show looks great. Now i really want to see pic related adapted.  <br>Because he is handsome. No homo</br>  <br>Split 2 cour, so 26. <br><br><br>Make me some medicine Shirayuki</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well she is voiced by Hayami Saori so I kind of figured.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I want to see that adapted. I like that manga design, and I'm not sure which studio can do that justice.  And I don't want to see that thing get shitposted with &gt;hurr durr so edgy bullshit. </br>  Trying to decide if I want to pick this up, never read the manga. Is it anything like soredemo sekai?  Not gonna bother with this, I don't really read shoujo stuff and the anime is probably worse than the manga  <br>Thank you for your insightful opinion no one cares about.</br>  <br/>  <br> I don't like shoujo so I'll post in this thread to let fellow anon knows. <br>That anon probably just tsundere.<br> And well, you care enough to reply. </br></br></br>  <br>Animes like this are obvious and you can understand what is happening while watching it 10 times faster, I suppose.</br>  I want to impregnate Kiki.  Just finished watching the ep, havnt read the manga at all and went in pretty blind, seems interesting enough to keep me entertained for 20 minutes a week. What should I expect from the upcoming eps??  Holy shit this scene. Made me crack up just like the manga.<br>Also why the fuck does this first episode look so good, it looked really bad from the key visuals, but it actually looks fine now.<br><br><br> animes </br></br></br></br>  <br>But she wants to be impregnated by Mitsuhide</br>  <br>But you are not Mitsuhide anon.</br>  <br>Honestly I really don't know any Studio that could adapt The Ancient Magus Bride. They would have to get the setting and atmosphere right. Maybe Bones or Mappa?</br>  <br> mangareader </br>  I hope this feels the emptiness I am left with after Tender Rain ended.  What the fuck was up with Funi's audio? The BGM sounded way off, like it was overlapping the voices.<br><br>Good episode though, excellent VA choices.<br>Felt like I was watching Yamada-kun from his VA, Sayamin and Fukujun being in the main cast. <br>Same VA as Yamada, Shiraishi and the antagonist (stuco pres), with nearly identical typecasted roles as before.<br><br><br>Me too anon. I also hope it fills the emptiness Yona left.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so mad</br>  <br>More of the same, pretty much.<br><br>What you'll find: Episodic storytelling, low-key adventure, deadpan tsukkomi, fantasy slice-of-life, slow-burn romance.<br><br>What you won't find: The Hero's Journey, blood and gore, tears, love triangles, overt drama.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty calm though.</br>  <br> What you'll find: Episodic storytelling, low-key adventure, deadpan tsukkomi, fantasy slice-of-life, slow-burn romance. <br> What you won't find: The Hero's Journey, blood and gore, tears, love triangles, overt drama. <br><br><br>I am completely ok with all of this! thanks mate!</br></br></br></br></br>  A lot better than Yona.  Top tier first episode, really enjoyed it. Lives up to what I remember of the manga  <br>Fukujin gets a relatively minor role, comparatively.</br>  <br>I don't why people keep comparing this to Yona. They're honestly very different stories. Pacing is a mess in Yona's anime though.</br>  I enjoyed the first episode. I hope that the story develops into some kind of political intrigue and such other than just being a long winded love story.  <br>Redhead MC</br>  Goddamnit, for a sec I thought we were second season of Yona.<br>I'll give this a go nonetheless. Watching shoujo with /a/ is really fun.  Even the threads of that shit rain animu was fun </br>   an herbalist <br>Subs make this literally unwatchable, thanks Funi.</br>  Meh it kind of fells like I've watched the show after one episode, don't really see a reason to continue. Also the focus seems to be very heavy on romance  Just reminder, that Pierrot`s "The World is Still Beutiful" had Godtier first episode too. And then they decided thats enougth spent budget..<br><br>Lets see if episode 2 of this can hold up.</br></br>  Just watched the episode - it warmed my heart. <br><br>Sadly I don't see how this is going to translate into a full series without becoming repetitive, and the spoilers in this thread seem to confirm that this really should have been an OVA or movie, not a TV adaptation.</br></br>  <br>I didn't watch Yona when it aired, but I won't let it die in my backlog either.</br>  <br>It doesn't really from what I remember of the manga. It's very light politically and all the issues ( which are usually political or pharmaceutical ) are tied into the romantic aspect of it. <br><br><br>It does vary quite a lot though. I think it'll last at least 1 cour at the very least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirayuki and Noya are not the only female protagonists with red hair. People should check Reimei no Arcana.</br>  <br>The show is 2 cour.</br>  <br>Because both are recent shoujo series with a historical/fantasy setting and an MC with red hair.</br>  That RPG perspective  <br> Reimei no Arcana <br>Not too bad but it has terrible pace especially near the end.</br></br>  <br>Is this even shoujo?</br>  <br> Also the focus seems to be very heavy on romance <br>The romance is almost non-existant after this. There's like one kiss and a couple of cute moments in like a dozen of chapters.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I have no idea how they're going to pace the arcs. I was saying you probably won't find it repetitive for at least the first cour. <br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was rushed during the end but overall is great for me at least. Its one of the few shoujo manga I gave a chance bc Im very picky about shoujo. I don't regret reading it.</br>  <br><br>She's the new HanaKana</br></br>   Kiki's VA <br> not Sawashiro <br>Damn, not enough budget?<br>Not too bad for the 1st eps. Hope the rest are not abomination.</br></br></br>  <br>This is like her only show this season<br>HanaKana is in like 6</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is /a/ - iddle activities?</br>  <br> iddle activities ready for the comeback of Yona? <br><br><br>Man you got me exited for a Dragon no Bassline s2</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd argue the whole manga still has the romance always in it's background but it's not what the drama revolves around.<br><br><br>Yeah I think Sawashiro would've suited her well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't VAs get paid in peanuts or something? Must've just been a casting decision, she can't be that expensive.</br>  <br>Depends on the VA. Mostly yes but there are a few superstars making the big bucks.</br>  <br> Red-haired Cinderella sounds interesting <br><br>you mean normal. Cinderella was always ginger. Have you never heard anyone say Im gonna beat you like a red headed stepchild?</br></br></br>  <br><br>When did this Yona show become the apparent bare none gold standard and comparison point for which all fantasy anime must be gauged by is what I'm wondering more about?</br></br>  <br>When everybody in the thread wanted to be raped by Yona.</br>  The mangaka drew this in order to celebrate the anime airing, which reminds me that they decided to draw Shirayuki's hair the way it is right now. <br><br>It was actually shorter in the manga when she first cut it.</br></br>  The animation here was just amazing, what are you guys talking about it being unimpressive?    I want Zen to look me in the eyes.  <br>Mitsuhide, stop posting, you drunk.</br>  <br>Some people on /a/ don't know what good animation is when they see it. These are probably the same faggots who think KyoAni shows are high budget and have amazing animation.<br><br>People don't give Bones lots of credit but they have some of the best animation in the business. And this show is showing why they are still great.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me to an arc in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.</br>  <br>How dare you deny my love for Zen.</br>  <br> These are probably the same faggots who think KyoAni shows are high budget and have amazing animation. <br>Is that really necessary?</br></br>  I can't wait until  Kiki CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.   <br>You misspelled Obi.</br>  <br>Nigga it was one person who judged it based on the PV too.<br><br>It looks great.</br></br></br>  Christ, Funi's colors of this series hurt my eyes. Too fucking bright.  We need more furries.  <br>You what now?</br>  I like anime Rori.   Japanese nationalistic bullshit <br>Dropped</br>  <br>Haha   No  </br>   my face when this anime BTFOs all the amerishit posters   6 months of 24/7 gate threads.<br>sounds fun.</br>  <br>Speaking for the manga, America has only been involved in like 3 plot points.</br>   new SAO produced by the A-1 masters themselves <br><br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>The fun never stops.<br> That means the funposting as well. ;_; </br></br>  <br> infantry rifle melts under normal conditions of fire <br> half the vehicles are derelict (includes armor, planes and logistics) <br> budget issues <br> HAVING TO USE BROOMSTICKS INSTEAD OF RIFLE DURING EXERCISES <br><br>I wasn't exaggerating.

Fictional work <br> Fantasy setting <br> Dragons Elves Magic etc. <br> Nip has good military <br> Out of all these only the Nip military is the one people hate <br><br>Get over yourselves, this isn't a valid complaint.<br>It's not real world, it doesn't fucking matter if they get potrayed as god military.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying anything about that other shit (I've heard plenty of horror stories of Bundeswehr under conscription) but L2's are pretty solid tanks.</br>  <br>The trope for the whole jsdf against fantasy shit is<br>'A big fish (JSDF) in a small pond (Gate world).</br></br>  <br>There already is I just forgot the title. <br><br>It's by Alphapolis and the illustrations are made by the same person who draws Gate novel.</br></br></br>  <br> aohige had confirmed LAST YEAR that there will be a part II of the series from the author's words in the Bunkobon version of book 5, so this wouldn't be news, also, the insertion of a JMSDF officers in a military without a ship is so obvious that of course we will be dealing with ocean exploration later on, remember the official map of the world has a caption (the known land), so basically there will be new continents beyond the ocean for them to discover, since JSDF had not yet to launch a satellite to map the world so this story plot is possible. <br>copied it off animesuki</br></br>  <br>Why does anime Pina Colada look about five years younger and have a 5head?</br>  <br>So are is the Abrams/Leclerc/Merkava/T-90MS, etc<br><br>though my tankfus are the T-72-120 and T-84-120<br> soviet tanks <br> upgraded to modern standards <br> NATO specs <br> Leclerc-style autoloader instead of the original carousel autoloader <br><br>fucking Ukrainians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   friend can't stop wanking over this Gate manga <br> constantly tells me how awesome it is <br> some medieval fucks being blown the fuck out by tanks and shit <br> finally decided to give it a go <br> expecting good old America kicking some elf ass <br>You can imagine my disappointment and disgust when I found out that proud and noble Americans are actually bad guys and this shit manga is centered on filthy japs instead. <br>Fucking race traitor shits fucks. Saged this shit for America.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KRAKEN VS SUBMARINES CONFIRMED</br>  <br> QUALITY out the ass. You can clearly see them juggling their budget already and the season just started. <br> Censoring a Seinen and focusing more on the harem. <br> Character design overhauls. <br>The anime won't "BTFO" of anything, friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MURICA<br><br>FUCK<br><br>YEAH</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's still shitposting even if you're being ironic.</br></br>    needing more furries ever <br>Fuck this.

Perhaps there even were some nips fighting with us.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> Replying to bait </br></br></br></br></br>  The Americans portrayed are greedy and underhanded, ready and willing to blackmail the Japanese government to satisfy their interests, and use military force if that doesn't work. Of course the Japanese are shown to do the same thing, but what makes it somewhat irksome, is that it indicates that it's okay for Japan to use force if they don't get their way.<br> From TVtropes </br>  How long is the anime gonna be? I wanna see what's her face beat the shit out of the prince get animated.  if you go to monster girl land, MC is not the only one who gets a waifu. Look at this shit. Most of them are better than nearly all of MCs harem, if you want to call it that.  <br>Who is the third male?</br>  <br> One chance for Earth humanity to fuck shit up with the power of unity and show these shitters how we do it without magic. <br> Instead it's just one small island country playing keep away with the rest of the world while their shitty military get to shoot monsters and notRomans by themselves. <br>Sasuga Nippon</br></br></br>  <br>He's the cook.</br>  <br> Ojou <br> Catgirl <br> Bunnygirl (RIP) <br> Bunnygirl <br> Tomboy knight <br> Loli ojou <br>They're all top tier waifus.

And apparently protagonist is hanging with 3 magical underage-looking waifu instead of his real woman. Very offensive!</br>  <br>Honestly that's pretty disgusting<br>No wonder Japs have such a low birthrate when they're constantly lusting after foreign women</br></br>  <br>Nice post, no matter how irrelevant it really is to the topic.</br>  <br>When the hell did the cook catch the eye of the bunny princess?</br>  <br> Honestly that's pretty disgusting </br>  <br>With his cooking skills, naturally.</br>  Is /ak/ not going to pick this up?

You can have an off-duty soldier, a former Green Beret, getting caught up with the Gate invasion in NY while heading to a comic book or Star Wars convention. <br><br>The whole establishing base at Alnus and reaching out to locals can be done the same. <br><br>But then you skip all the baggage in between since once the USAF have mapped the region and pinpointed the capital, they'll just bomb the shit out of it and the story will end rather quickly.</br></br></br></br>   Dragon girl is blue <br>B-But I was expecting delicious brown</br>  <br>If there's one thing I would like turned into an anime, its Band of Brothers.

What makes you think that?</br></br>  <br>Laff</br>  <br>She lives in an area that is full of white people and has a capital city that is literally the Roman Empire</br>  <br>Oh you mean like that. You think she looks japanese? She looks pretty white to me. But I dunno.</br>  <br>And is also 962 years old. <br><br>A lot of countries can fall in this time anon, also a lot distance can be traveled.</br></br></br>  <br> Rome <br> White </br></br>  <br> 3 plot points <br>That's two more than Russia and China.</br></br>  <br>So he only has 32 years to bang her before she disappear? That is to little, considering he wasted 4 already.</br>  <br>That's a lot more than regular girls, 32 years usually puts one of the other of the mates past expiration date.</br>  <br>Considering Hardy wants to marry her i'd say it's possible for them to have sex after becoming gods. That or she wants to marry Rory for love, but i still believe that she want to have some godly sex with her.</br>  <br>I don't know if it is explained on the novels, but I thought god can still have sex. Didn't another god tried to claim her as wife?</br>  <br>Huh? But I thought the events in GATE take place between a few months, not a few years?</br>  <br><br>nah, when they ascend, they lose their physical form. Rori mentions it during the hot spring chapter.</br></br>  <br>Hardy wants to wed Rory, but her idea of sex is "melding the two existence into one, mixing in each other"</br>  <br>So you're saying they can't have sex just because they don't have bodies? You have a serious lack of imagination<br><br>She does seem to be trying too hard and that can be due to the little time she have.</br></br></br>  Yeah, she lose the "pleasures/pain" of the flash after that. Who know how their sex life will be after that.<br><br><br>they get stuck without the portal for 4 years later. No sex, no cuddling with the harem in that time.</br></br></br>  <br>She also says they loose all wants and needs when they ascend. So the chances of it happening is very low. I suppose she could poses someone, but not entirely sure how that works at this point.</br>   First episode <br> Military finally comes in <br> Oh boy time to see these roman faggots get smashed <br> Literally just a few frames of guns firing and all the orcs and shit dancing around while they apparently die <br> Also a short glimpse of their shields being shot up <br> Everything's fine now, go home <br><br>Disappointment of the decade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for spoiling that for me, shitlord</br>  <br>Rory said it herself Johnny. When she ascends physical attributes like pleasure and pain will go away.</br>  <br>That may be wrong, seeing as Hardy want to marry her so badly that Rory gets scared. They do seem to retain some human thinking.</br>  <br> they get stuck without the portal for 4 years later <br>Isn't that a prime opportunity for the Empire to get rid of them? No source of water or food on the hill, limited supplies of ammunition, fuel, and spare parts.</br></br>  <br>Pina has the empire<br><br>JSDF all make it out<br><br>Itami has an apostle, 2 fucking elves, and a space bending magician.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a secondary <br><br>No problem, shitlord</br></br></br>  <br>Well at least there is some  character development on each main girl, and Rory is still ahead of the others. <br><br><br>The Empire is fucked by them, those left behind struggle a bit but still manage to get by.

The more slender figure?  I can't really notice a significant difference to understand all the hate. </br>   They know.   <br>It's not Goth loli He skirt is shorter and no black lace.</br>  Anime Rory is cute af.  Why do people hate the Evangelion Rebuild?  <br><br>because if something isn't the best then it is the worst in these autistic man childrens minds. it was okay, it wasn't the original NGE but it wasn't trying to be.</br></br>  <br>Looks like it's still there, but it glows spooky blue when she's really mad.</br>  <br> audience attention halved for the next few weeks <br>Actually no. It was going strong for months because people were seeing it again and again, sometimes 5 times so they could understand it. That's why it sold so much more than 2.0 in cinemas. Also it sold more in DVDs than 2.0 but less in BDs, but only by a little bit.</br></br>  <br>Something has gone wrong if Rei isn't scary.</br>  remember when EVA Re-Take was better than EoE?

Really his age rests on how old exactly Gramps was in that flashback.  <br>the incest part is what makes it hot. imagine mikasa dicking her aniki.</br>  <br>Worst shingekis.</br>  <br>How old was Kenny too. He could be between 25-35 when he talked with Grandpa Ackerman.</br>  <br>this shity link does not work...</br>  <br>No one deserves that fate not even Mikasa.</br>  <br>I still don't understand why Isayama implied that his age is relevant. He's ambiguous when people ask about it, or he'll agree with a guessed number halfheartedly.</br>  <br>Isayama also said that Hangaerd's gender would become relevant later on. He's just spouting bullshit.</br>  <br>Kenny's age is irrelevant. Gramps said he was born after people migrated to the walls, and we know for a fact that the walls are 107 years old. So if he was born 106 years ago, and he was about 80 in that flashback, that would make Levi 26 since we know from that flashback that was when he was conceived.</br>  levi could be 15 like Mikasa.  <br>107 years ago the titan appear.

Based on that they do have an age gap.</br>  <br>That's because Nanaba was actually questionable for genuinely looking like a guy.</br>  <br>That's because banana is actually ambiguous.

 <br>Like the others.<br>Keith manipulated the belt cause he didn't want that the son of his good friend Grisha be exposed to such danger.<br>Keith was present when Grisha injected Eren.He was guarding the area from trespassers.<br>Keith is Eren's godfather and was also present when he was born.<br>He was also a good friend of Hannes.He,Hannes and Grisha used to always hang out together when they were younger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So nothing happens.</br>  <br>good one, I like you anon</br>  <br> Because Keith and GURISHA were a best friend for a reason. <br> Ellen who is a child of GURISHA where she's the child. <br> I didn't want to make them participate in a dangerous previous battle. <br>So Keith fucked Eren's gear because he didn't want Eren hurt?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That all that happens <br>so everyone waited 3 days for a crap chapter</br></br>  <br> Keith being set up as another father figure for Eren <br><br>KEITH IS KILL</br></br></br>  <br>No, we waited a month for it.</br>  <br> Keith was present when Grisha injected Eren.He was guarding the area from trespassers. <br>He can't possibly have missed the titan transformations if this were the case.</br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> Keith liked Carla too </br></br>  <br>RIP KEITH.</br>  <br>It the begining of the volume/arc, i doubt we will reach the basement until next year.</br>  <br>chingfag is old and wise here.</br>  <br>So Monkey Troubles gonna kill Keith, huh</br>  <br>So did Isayama lie about featuring Erwin, or was that a translation error and he didn't say anything about it?<br><br>I don't mint a Keith-only chapter but the content is too thin if this is all it is.<br><br> There are no born records of Ellen. <br> It doesn't seem to be [in wall]. <br>Most interesting part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isayama pretty much said he was bi or doesn't really care about somebody's sex. Something along those lines.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127682704 <br>There was,he paints on his hair</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127682704 <br>Maybe he appears in some panels and does nothing?</br>  But do we at least get to see shota Mike this chapter? Where does Erwin fit in this flashback?  But Keith was the one who noticed that Eren's Belt was rusted and asked to change the equipment. Shit makes no sense.  <br>Wait how would Keith witness Eren's birth if he wasn't born in the walls?</br>  <br> what is pretending <br><br><br>Keith and Grisha are both wall foreigners</br></br></br></br>  <br>A younger Mike has a chance of appearing, but I doubt it'll be shota Mike.</br>  <br>My bad I meant JB mike not shota</br>  <br>ymir village? monkey village? rba homeland?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127682704 <br>Maybe he's just in the background. That's fine, but can anyone confirm if he said he'd draw Erwin's process to be a leader thing? Which means it will come, only not this chapter.<br><br><br>It just says no birth records. And I thought spoilers just said he saw Eren as a baby, not being born.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;what is pretending <br>He was pretending to fool himself?</br></br>  <br> There are no born records of Ellen <br><br>The fuck is this? Naruto Gaiden.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127682704 <br>40 pages, usually we got three situations happening in one chapter. So Keith story, Erwin story, and other characters in between would be enough.</br>  <br><br>Didn't Keith comment how that staying upright with a broken belt is an exceptional feat? Maybe that's what changed his mind.</br></br>  <br>Q&amp;A, not drawing.<br><br><br>Eren getting sharigan soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>damn so who eren father?</br>  <br>I just can't accept that Keith of all characters would be a wall foreigner. Especially given how messed up he was after witnessing so many deaths by titan.</br>  <br>Sounds like bullshit. But we're talking about SnK here, so it's just the usual bad writing.</br>  <br>Keith.</br>  <br>I saw a spoiler that they were both from Ymir's hometown</br>  <br>Let hope these spoiler aren't true.</br>  <br>Reminder that they could have pitied the walled people and they ended up changing sides.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127682880 <br> there is a bit about the Survey Corps members in their younger days <br>Could be referring to Keith. He doesn't necessarily say he'd draw Erwin's backstory. <br><br>But there's this https://twitter.com/sofia_blue_moon<wbr>/status/617220512347885568<br>Which I need an offical sauce for.</br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but it makes no sense, if he's really from the outside and therefore knows titan shit, why did uselessly lead the SL without giving them any valuable info?</br>  <br>Like BRAY and the Reiss family he could have had his reasons not to say anything.</br>  <br>They are</br>  <br>Not Shota since Mike is older than Erwin</br>  <br>Might as well ask why Grisha was keeping the basement a secret if it's so important.</br>  Chinkfag here, do you want pic spoilers? I might get 1 or 2 photos  So this chapter is confirmed for being boring and having forced love triangle. Isayama a shit writer.  <br>So i guess it mean eren doesn't have any special grisha blood line</br>  <br>yes please</br>  <br>Just wait until the Hanji/Ymir/Nanaba love triangle happens</br>  <br>Nah, we don't need them.<br><br> Please share. I will resort to begging if I have to. </br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't really sound like 45 pages, unless there will be a lot of stairing.</br>  <br>A good begining to a new arc</br>  Chinkfag here. Camera is on fire.  <br>Two of those are kill.</br>  <br>Yeah but if he didn't intend to help, why join the SL in the first place and make himself suffer for no reason?<br><br><br>Simple, he didn't anticipate the breach to happen and he thought he still had time to finish whatever he had planned. Grisha, the Reiss, and BRA's behaviors are easily explained.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nanaba <br>Son, I have some news for you.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there were many wall foreigners, Some survivors who showed up without any grandiose story but just people with a home destroyed asking to be allowed to live in the Walls?</br>  <br> Nanaba <br>Looks like somebody already lost.</br></br>  <br>So does that matter?<br>He's a fucking Titan he's special enough to become Humanities ultimate weapon</br></br>  <br>Sakura</br>  WAKE UP  <br>He won't be special anymore when manlet injects himself.</br>  <br>He could have been delusional</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>people were theory crafting that the yeager blood line had controling power. IF the spoiler are true than the theory is dead, and their won't be anymore blood line powers.</br>  Carla is a golddigger.  WAKE UP FAGGOTS  <br>This can't be the whole chapter, can it? It can fit into 20 pages.</br>  <br>Keith pls</br>  <br>don't bring that lady here she not even a real mom</br>  <br>Nope.  He has a special Carla bloodline. </br>  So according to nips Carla could be a Reiss.  <br>Carla's a slut she should learn how to be a pure woman like Anka</br>  <br>There could be a lot of talking. It's the beginning of the new arc and a new volume. Nothing too exciting is going to happen.</br>  <br> 20 pages of reaction faces </br>  <br>Erwin pls</br>  <br>According to everyone else in the world too. That's why Isayama had to post the differences between EH's eyes in his blogs some time ago.</br>  <br>Does she look like a Reiss</br>  <br>One face per page.</br>   四月4-2016 <br>Season 2's release date is April 2016</br>  Keith to go along to Shiganshina where he dies, triggering all the rookies he trained.<br>I guess.</br>  <br>Remember when everyone thought Frieda was cross dressing Eren?</br>  <br>Well alot of people can be distantly related with each other. Since Humanity population decrease the more lilkely people related have children</br>  <br> 四 <br>Death</br></br>  <br>source anon?</br>  <br>Are you dumb or something? That's the character for the number 4.</br>  <br>Bravo.

He can't keep it out of his shitty manga.</br>  <br>He's 28 and a virgin. Take your guess.</br>  <br>Imagine the three of them rubbing their futa dicks together</br>  <br>viet/quarter chink add in a little cambodian/cham</br>  <br>can we get rid of Araki why is this dude a faggot <br>I heard he did some changes because he didn't like what isayama did in the manga</br></br>  <br>The indonesian anon is the biggest shitposter in here, don't start multiplying now.</br>  <br>I remember there was an image like that. Well, it was only Ymir and Nanaba, but they were simply pressing their tits against each other's.</br>  Chinkfag here once again, scanner and camera are dead, sorry anons, you have to wait 1 month more.  <br>how so? Are they not making ti?</br>  <br>damn your scanner.Anyway I'm sure it will be fixed by next spoiler week.</br>  <br>Post pic</br>  <br>Not really, Cristiano Ronaldo is out in 2 days.</br>  <br>welp Im waiting for CR scans now</br>  <br>I would if I could find it, anon.</br>  This chapter sounds shitty  <br>Like all of them.</br>  <br>What manga do you think you're reading?</br>    <br>Thanks satan, made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.</br>  <br>So their dicks are probably touching.</br>  <br> It's like Satan gave me his porno collection </br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  So no Erwin this chapter after Isayama teased about his backstory? Kek.<br><br>Whole chapter better not be the fucking flashback though.</br></br>  <br>Erwin is in the chapter.

So love triangle confirmed, eh? And Eren's the one without birth records?<br><br>I don't see Erwin mentioned though.</br></br></br>  Welcome to the club, Grisha!  <br>Dreamfag probably didn't bother mentioning him since Isayama already confirmed it.<br><br>The love triangle might be referencing Nile &gt; Marie &lt; Erwin.

It was obviously a joke. </br></br>  <br>kek</br>  Did dreamfag post anything new yet?  <br>That  was it. I doubt he'll post anything more.</br>  Did dreamfag talk about MT last month?  <br>yes</br>  <br>There won't be any MT this month, anon.</br>  So LME love triangle fucking when?   6th <br> still no spoiler pics </br>  <br>Why have a love triangle when you can have a threesome?</br>  <br> Connie's mother gets turned into a titan <br> still welcomes him home <br> a bad mother <br><br> Carla dies protecting Eren and Mikasa <br> It's somehow her fault Eren rages through his grief <br><br> implying Jean is actually a bad person <br><br>Mikasa's mother is only shitty because she tattooed her own child and permanently marked her as a member of a clan the Reiss family wanted dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gross. EL hate each other.</br>  <br> EL hate each other. <br>Not really.</br></br>  <br>LME dying when?</br>  <br>The Jews did it, too.</br>  Who killed the world?  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Wasn't it recently confirmed that Eren used to look up to him but doesn't anymore? <br>Also it's obvious manlet doesn't care for him.</br></br>  <br> Not muscular <br> Huge tits <br>That's not Mikasa.</br></br></br>  <br> Also it's obvious manlet doesn't care for him. <br>How is that obvious?</br></br>  <br> it's obvious manlet doesn't care for him <br>He obviously cares about the kid.</br></br>  <br>See</br>  <br>That info was from an outdated relationship chart from the first season of the anime that came with the first monthly figure magazine. It said something like Eren used to admire him which probably means that he doesn't idolize him anymore and sees him as an actual person.</br>  <br>Jotaro</br>  <br>Bertholdt please leave</br>   people who want two imaginary characters to be in love <br>there is always a lower form of human</br>  What is this love triangle bullshit?  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br>There's too many to keep track of anymore.</br>  <br>troll spoilers, but the landwhales believe it because they think it's a romance manga</br>  <br>Isayama is a cuck and must project his feelings in his shitty manga in every way possible</br>  <br>Kek this.</br>  <br> snk <br> post arslan </br></br>  <br>Not really, he's just suddenly acting like a good person now.</br>  <br>There's absolutely no indication that Levi hates Eren.</br>  <br>I didn't say he hated him but manlet is retarded by default.<br>Learn reading comprehension.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? The main snk pairing is right there in the top right corner.</br>  <br><br>Bumrustled EHfag now that his ship got sunk.</br></br>  <br> I didn't say he hated him <br/></br>  <br>That isn't me.</br>  <br>No, shippingcancer needs to fuck off.</br>  <br>I assumed you were  <br><br>Still, saying Levi doesn't care about Eren to some degree means you're the one with shitty reading comprehension.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't hesitate to let Eren get eaten.</br>  <br>Levi volunteered to watch over him so he could prevent him from dying. That's the entire essence of their canon relationship, so to say he did not care if Eren came into harms way is completely untrue. Keeping Eren safe was always his top priority. It's his duty to protect humanity's last hope. Levi never put Eren in harms way because he doesn't care about him. Whenever he couldn't save him it was due to a plan going wrong, not from personal contempt.<br><br>Seriously, I'm not trying to say they have some deep relationship because they certainly don't, but if you honestly think Levi doesn't gives a shit what happens to Eren than you desperately need to reread the manga because you're missing a crucial plot point.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, but that doesn't make him any less of an incompetent idiot.</br>  <br>But we're not discussing Levi's incompetence. His unintentional fuck ups have nothing to do with his relationship with Eren. Claiming that Levi doesn't give a shit about Eren is total bullshit because it goes against everything established about them in canon.</br>  <br>He gives a shit about him to some extent, ok?</br>  <br>sorry, i'm not a fat teenage girl who goes to tumblr. i come to these threads for the story.</br>  Manlet obviously cares about Eren, as he would any of his subordinates. Doesn't mean he's special to him in a personal way, just that he isn't completely heartless either. He feels bad that Eren is im this position but it's not like he'd lose his soulmate if Eren died.  Spoilers when?  <br>Manlet is shit.</br>  <br>This. Of course he needs to protect their most valuable asset.</br>  <br>Okay. Like I said, I'm not trying to make their relationship seem deep because it isn't, but I just don't like when people make claims without any proof.<br><br><br>Again, never said their relationship was special or deep in any way. It's just moronic to believe that Levi doesn't care about him at all and purposely puts him in harms way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>never</br>  <br>Bert a shit.</br>  <br>And water is wet.</br>  <br>Then we agree. That person is just retarded to say that they hate each other.</br>  <br>Thanks for being here, Anniebot.</br>  <br>This.</br>  http://imgur.com/a/zSbml  Post summer shingekis.  <br>Yes. Manlet held a dying soldier's bloody hand. He cares for people, and he is not a fag who would yell "gross"or would refuse to give a handkerchief to someone who needs it.</br>  <br>You too, anon.</br>  <br>Thanks as always.</br>  So, Erwin uses Gorilla Snot for his hair?  <br>That's why I don't see how people call him heartless. Holding his soldier's hand, his apology to Eren and an understanding that Eren has a lot of shit on his plate, how he saved Mikasa, his encouragement to Armin, his praise of Connie, and so on. I admit that some of the things he did to Historia and Eren was pretty shitty, but he has developed on that count.</br>  <br>Yes, he hires Reiner to sneeze in his hair every morning.</br>  <br>What he did to Historia, at least to me it was pretty in character. Historia wasn't being Miss sympathy the previous weeks, so yelling at her under those circumstances were pretty manletrish. Not even saying it was good or justified, just IC.</br>  <br>I like when they bring side characters in Chuugakkou, like they did with Nile, Kenny and Frieda.  MT when? </br>  <br>If he shows up, it will be in the next one or so. I'll dump the chapter if it's interesting.</br>  Will Mikasa ever stop being the cuck?  <br>I'm not saying that it's out of character or anything, considering his past and the fact that he has been aggressive like that with Eren before (though it never escalated to anything physical), just that he's not always like that to his subordinates.</br>  <br>I don't personally get it either. People call him heartless, but his actions prove otherwise. Whenever he does fuck up a plan or lets his emotions get the better of him (like the Historia scene) I don't see that as him being heartless. I think it proves that despite him being overpowered and sullen he is still an imperfect human that cares. I'm not saying he flawless, there's plenty of unlikable qualities about him, but I don't see how that makes him a bad character. I think it makes him realistic because no human is completely heartless, nor are they a flawless saint. <br><br> inb4 manlet a shit </br></br></br>  <br>That's what I like about his character. He made many mistakes and then he learns from them or has his own awkward mode of say sorry. Also, other characters usually pinpoints when they think he is being an idiot, is not like they pretend all he does is amazing or perfect. <br>  But, watch out, anon. We are on a field where "manlet a shit" is a trend.  </br></br>  <br>Some people just like to hate on him for no reason. I could understand the fatigue with his popularity, but the shitposting against him gets tiring. Even Erwinfags hate on him, even though he's helped boosted Erwin's popularity and is ride-or-die for Erwin in the manga throws a lot of hate his way.</br>  I want manletwhales out.  <br> other characters usually pinpoints when they think he is being an idiot, is not like they pretend all he does is amazing or perfect <br>Yeah it's not like they mindlessly think his word is law. They do doubt him at times and realize he's not perfect. Characters like Mikasa even call him out when he's being insensitive. Like that campfire scene, at first he seemed cold toward Armin, but he elaborated and thanked him for getting his hands dirty for everyone else's sake. He acknowledges the fact that he's abnormal due to his past and that's why he does and says questionable things sometimes, but at least he's not blind to his flaws and he's not blind to others achievements either; he's always sure to thank people and cheer them up in his own odd way. <br><br><br>I personally don't mind if people dislike him. You don't always need a reason to hate a character, sometimes certain qualities don't appeal to certain people and that's enough reason to not like something. But I do think the abundant amount of hate is pointless. I certainly don't like talking about characters I dislike, so I would never waste time bringing them up. I rather talk about characters I do like, but I guess a lot of people come on here just to argue.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no reason <br>Fuck off deluded fatty fujo.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off you retarded landwhales. Manlet has been hated here for ages until you idiots from Tumblr popped up and started whining about people understandably being tired of him or disliking his character. Don't pretend that manletfags aren't the worst of the fanbase either because from my experience they shit on the most characters and even complain when he isn't in things despite the fact that his fanbase gets the most pandering.<br><br>Also as it looks, manlet is more welcome here than lesser popular characters like Bertolt so even /a/ has become like the rest of the entire SnK fanbase where everyone must tolerate the manlet or put him on a pedestal. Like him if you want but don't get mad when anons here hate him either.</br></br></br>  God tier:<br>Akagami no Shirayukihime <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br><br>Great tier:<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Durarara <br>Gate<br>Ranpo Kitan<br>Ushio no Tora<br><br>Good tier:<br>Charlotte <br>Gatchaman Insight<br>Rockka no Yuusha<br>Shimoneta<br>Wakaba Girl<br>Non Non Biyori<br><br>Meh tier:<br>Classroom Crsis<br>Miss Monochrome<br>Working<br><br>Why even tier:<br>Chaos Dragon <br> <br>Shit tier:<br>Gangsta</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   high tier <br>Gangsta<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br> mid tier <br>Gatchaman Insight<br>Charlotte<br><br> garbage tier <br>Gate<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Ranpo Kitan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Great <br>Charlotte<br>Durarara<br><br>Good<br>Shimoneta<br><br>Meh<br>Gate<br><br>Shit<br>Chaos Dragon<br>Gangsta<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127692907 <br>You are making Jojo haters look worse than the fans</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Good tier <br>Charlotte<br>Wakaba Girl<br>NNB Repeat<br><br> decent tier <br>Shimoneta<br><br> meh tier <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Okusama<br><br> Dropped tier <br>Gate<br>Akagami</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   high tier <br>DBS<br>Jitsu wa, watashi<br><br> shit tier <br>GATE</br></br></br></br></br>   God Tier: <br>Nothing so far.<br><br> Great tier: <br>Ushio to Tora<br>Ace of Diamonds<br>Gatchaman <br><br> Good tier: <br>Miss Monochrome <br>Gangsta<br>Charlotte<br>Akagami<br>NonNonBiyori<br>Wakaba Girl<br><br> Okay tier: <br>Okusama ga Seitokaichou!<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>GATE<br>Rokka Yusha<br><br> Not very good tier: <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Shimoneta<br><br> I want to drop this already: <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Game of Laplace</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it that so far I'm having the most fun with shoujo/otomoe shows this season than with shows aimed at otaku?<br>Wakaba Girl was also good I guess.</br></br>   High <br>Ushio to Tora<br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br> Mid <br>Charlotte<br>Gatchaman Crowds<br><br> Low <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Ranpo Kitan<br>Classroom Crisis<br><br> Lower than low <br>Chaos Dragon<br>Gangsta<br>Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aquarion subs fucking where/10  <br><br><br><br> All this Gangsta hate <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   everyone hating on Gangsta <br><br>When will moeshiteaters die?</br></br>  <br>I put Gangsta in high tier dumbass.<br><br><br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>muh sword versus guns you don't bring a knife to a gunfight</br>  <br>I don't know why you quoted me, I din't even watch Gangsta</br>   Good <br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime<br>Ushio to Tora<br>Charlotte<br>Gangsta<br>Ranpo Kitan <br>Working!!!<br><br> Alright <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br>Wakako-zake<br>Durarara<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br><br> Not good <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Gate<br>Shimoneta<br><br> Dropped already <br>Chaos Dragon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Black Lagoon for girls/10.</br>  <br>Akagami is hardly just a "shoujo".

I watch at least 30 shows each season which means that I actually eat shit. Well, I dropped Shimoneta after the first episode. If someone with shit taste doesn't want to watch shimoneta then what does that tell you? It tells you that it's even worse than shit.</br>  <br>As much i hate the right wing political stuff in Gate and many things that make me rage - there are just too many awesome moments to not watch this show. So yeah - its shit and its genuinely great. The flight of valkyrie chopter scene or meidos alone make it worth it.</br>  <br>I´m probably here before you were born.</br>  Everything looks and sounds like shit. When is the last time a great anime aired?  <br>it tells me that people have different taste in anime?</br>  Why are threads talking about anime/manga lolis so banned?  <br> Me Wizard </br>  <br>Gotta make more room for cancerous DBZ threads.</br>  This board is about anime &amp; manga.<br>The last thread didn't even pretend to refer to either of these mediums.</br>  because dumb loli posters can't keep to one thread at a time  Bard life is the only life.  They're glorified imagedumps where all anyone talks about is how much they wanna fuck lolis, with the occasional shitposter that everyone falls for. Pretty much all other fetish threads get deleted too, and these are way more insistent.  <br>Because loliphobic people shitpost until the threads become bad enough to make mods want to delete it.</br>  Why are there fewer and fewer anime girls with bread with jam nudged in their mouths while dashing off somewhere?

No wonder, anime girls avoid it.</br>  <br>Because it's fucking stupid, look at her, she clearly has a free hand. JUST HOLD YOUR FUCKING TOAST LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.</br>  <br>Because it's a overused clichè only worth to be mocked and parodied.<br>Playing it straight shows only how few ideas the writer has, or how lazy he is.</br></br>  <br> JUST HOLD YOUR FUCKING TOAST LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. <br>Go away normie</br></br>  <br>They just keep it in their pockets. Easier that way.</br>  /r/ing the Slice of Life pic.  why are there no pictures of best girl mio in this thread?    Do any girls running with bread in their mouth ever get hit bad the runaway japanese truck?  Because there's a decline in anime quality. Ever since K-ON, it's all just been going downhill.  <br> Oh goddammit, did I just hit one of those moe anime girls again? Someone should really tie a bell to those things. </br>  Shh, Hakase is sleeping  For Nano's sake, I hope she never wwakes up.

Still, is good enough for you to look past that. <br><br>Ending will be good if you like Mushashi and dislike Koshiro.<br><br>Must give the mangaka a pat on his back for not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga, jesus was the shit pretentious as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an adaptation of a novel that was pretty good, and the art is great, so yes, it is worth a read.</br>  <br> pretentious <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>That word gets misused time and time again.</br>  <br>That pic is so small, we can hardly see what a handsome bastard Musashi is.</br>  <br> pretentious as fuck <br><br>Jesus christ, how stupid do you have to be to find it pretentious? Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake. But of course, it was directed for the mainstream Naruto audience, so majority buys it.<br><br>Well, now I´m sounding pretentious as hell for even explaining it.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>The answer for stopping the bloodshed is dumb, and I´m not buying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction <br>Yes, and some fools even believe than one day man will fly! Pish-posh!</br></br>  Wouldn't it be nice to have a worthy opponent?  <br>If you start, just remember when it stops that's it.. don't get your hopes up or dwell when it will finish.. it wont</br>  <br>There's always the book.</br>  <br> not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga <br>I disagree. In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that. The best part begins once Musashi can't fight as good as he used too anymore.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>to*</br>  I pray and hope everyday for ricefarmingsaga to continue  <br>naruto fangirl here, and i do like vinland because thorfinn reminds me of naruto. so dont shit on us narutofags.</br>  <br>You having a giggle there?</br>    <br> Musashi refusing the other Samurai's proposal of glory so that he can help a bunch of peasants <br> Despite the fact he's growing weaker every day, he's improving as a person and learning to understand other people and his surroundings. <br> That amount of despair when despite his efforts everything just goes wrong over and over again. <br> Old man becomming a total bro in the end and helping everybody out <br> Mushashi, who is now a walking hungry skeleton begging on his knees to the other samurai and making a deal with them so that they help that infertile land and help his friends/comrades <br><br>Pinnacle of the manga right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want REAL to genre shift into wrasslin' instead of cripple basketball.</br>  <br> refusing <br>casca is disgusting used goods. i rather read hitman reborn.</br></br>  <br>The artist probably would die before he can finish his remaining works.</br>  <br>Pro wrestling in manga? Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.  <br>Most sympathetic character.</br>  <br>I think most people understood that its korean drama or so i would suspect, but who the fuck watches that shit to know what you mean by it.<br>Christ nigger.</br></br>  <br>Unless Inoue decides to continue into Musashi's later years, it will end like the movie and the book do: he gets on board the boat leaving Ganryu Island, gets vaguely sad, the boat sails off to the sunset, THE END.<br><br><br> too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. <br>It's pretty realistic actually. The samurai who don't give a shit about fighting are not a part of the story in the first place, and for the rest it was pretty much like what is shown in the manga, a wide spectrum of characters ranging from old masters who have awakened to petty murderers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do go autistic on me know. If you already know what Korean drama is, you know what was implied.</br>  <br>I have no idea what was implied, I've never seen a single Korean drama and don't know how it relates to Vinland Saga.</br>  <br>I really dont, but whatever.<br>If this is your idea of "no spoonfeeding" keep at it.</br></br>  <br>Canute's change was sudden, but Thorfinn's change was not. There was a whole year when he went mindbroken and just did hard labour so he didn't need to think about anything, and then we got Einar's arrival, budding of friendship, and then after another year (or was it 2?) of working on the farm, Thorfinn realizes his new goal in life (vinland) only through the subplot of that slave woman and her husband. I'm hardly seeing any dramatic change in Thorfinn's character throughout. It was not a case of him being depressed one day, and the next day being motivated about not using violence for no reason.</br>  <br>Nah, it panders way too much to glorious nippongo. Reading it make you want to live in that era. Shigarui would be a better representation of the sword era, dishonorable, shitty, and inglorious.</br>  <br>Reading Vagabond didn't make me want to live in that era. People get killed left and right with hardly any consequences to the killers. It's a scary time.</br>  <br><br>Tetsuya Sariwatari, writer of Tough, has started writing a wrasslin' manga if I'm not mistaken.</br></br>  <br> Tough <br>I've been meaning to pick that up, but it's so long and I don't know if I can stick to a fighting series for that long. How good is it?</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>there's that buzzword again.<br><br>"edginess" aside the relationship and rivalry between Gennosuke and Seigen was far more interesting to me than anything in vagabond.<br><br>I also liked how the creator didn't have a romantic view of that era or the samurai class. these where violent cunts looking out for their best interest in order to rise in their shit heap of a society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The supposed edginess of Shigurui comes from the fact that the series is unnecessarily brutal, just like the time period it depicts.</br>  <br>Do not take that literally and go full retard. It is more in the line of: Damn, this is beautiful, such a romantic age, sword, manliness, and rice growing. I would like to experience that, of course with plot armor and not getting hunted down by forest bandits for a day. And then you realize how comfy you are on that room of yours with PC and Internet.</br>  <br> It is more in the line of <br>Dude, don't go taking your personal experience and pretending everyone else shares it.</br></br>  <br>I could see yaoi doujins of them if they wasnt drawn by somebody that couldnt draw.</br>  <br>HA! no</br>  <br>Then what is worth reading? Don't be shy anon.</br>  <br>When will you learn that people do not have to put IMO after every sentence to get that across. Is the Internet lad.</br>  <br>bleach is quite good, lol, only shonen manga i like, or read gantz, that is very bloody and good.</br>  <br>Shigurui goes to extreme of complete anti-glorification and does it on purpose. It has partly true elements but its whole cannot be taken as being realistic or accurate by anyone.<br>I agree with . The time frame presented in Vagabond isn't appealing.<br><br>Compared to Shigurui, the movie Sword of Doom (partial adaptation of the novel 大菩薩峠, "Great Bodhisattva Pass") is a more accurate representation of the times (just before the Meiji era) from the point of view of a sociopath samurai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I've only read part of Tough myself, I've been meaning to continue but other backlog priorities arose. It's pretty bizarre and not a very conventional fighting series, I remember: Bloodsport+Mortal Kombat-esque underground tournaments, mafia everywhere, borderline supernatural powers, some guys building up power and energy via sexual deprivation, strong and righteous MC who uses a super secret assassination art but doesn't kill people, some guy linked to his past because of his father, or something.<br>As for the author's other works, Dog Soldier is like dog shit, the Tough spinoff-prequel OTON is pretty good, and Igyoujin Oniwakamaru is great.<br><br>So yeah maybe give it a go and you'll see pretty quickly whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of youre wrong. Both Vag and Shi are unrealistic. One head to the extreme of showing the brutalization and ugliness of being a samurai. And the other one indulge in your desire of a romantic era. Men with dreams and ideals. <br><br>However, both should be read. As theres much enjoyment and learning to be had. Everyone should just put down their fucking fan flags.</br></br></br>  <br>After your description, I think I'll pass. I prefer martial arts stuff to be like Holyland.</br>  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>is okay at first, then turns very very very bad with evil uncle and the fights become a super power fights.</br>  <br>Compare, though: Shigurui doesn't show a single good thing about samurai life and the samurai, while Vagabond showed many bad aspects of them even if it doesn't focus on that.</br>  So how useful is dual wielding for real?  <br>Not very unless you can actually overpower someone with one hand.</br>  <br>Did the real Musashi ever actually dual wield? I know for a fact that he would utilize his short sword if he lost his primary weapon but I don't know if he ever used them at the same time as he's commonly depicted doing.</br>  <br> not useful until you got what it takes to utilize it. like every thing ever. <br>geez, do you moonlight as sherlock?</br></br>  <br>It's more than just skill or practice. That's like herculean strength.</br>  <br>Niten Ichi-ryu, he used his second sword as a parry tool. So yes.</br>  <br>never go full retard. you are assuming he is wielding a bastard sword on both hands or what? have you ever wielded a short sword? they are quite light and can be used to swing with one hand. dualwielding can be useful. throwing your other sword or use it to block.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being scrawny.</br>  <br>Absolutely. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Thank God there was 300+ chapters when I started.</br>  <br>Another thing is, Musashi did not take a vow to not kill or pick up the sword again like Thorfinn did. He just simply doesn't want to murder everyone who goes against him, like when his leg was injured and drew the circles when he was recognized as was challenged, yet all small fries stepped in.</br>  I want it to finish so I could reread or own it. I mean fuck I read it years ago and it was fantastic, but now can barely remember the events.  <br>yup yup. vagabond is the better one.</br>  Fuck yeah it's worth a read and when you're done with that read Vinland Saga.  <br>The Book of Five Rings states that it's superior but only after years of dedication. You should be able to wield the long sword with one hand as if you were wielding it with two.</br>  <br>Like I said, you don't have to like Thorfinn's extreme stance, which is obviously in its early stage and is obviously going to be developed throughout the story since there ARE going to be people who want to kill him. It doesn't make it pretentious though.</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't like it, or that I find it pretentious. I just pointed a major difference out.</br>  <br>Then why on earth are you quoting me? My original post was entirely about disputing the claim that vinland saga is pretentious. I never said one thing about Vagabond.</br>  <br>Excuse me, I didn't think getting quoted on an anonymous image board would actually offend somebody.</br>  <br>Not that guy quoting you. But I have to say it. A tad pretentious, is what the Thor moment was. Would make sense if the king guy got touched by it but would not admit it. And maybe cut of one his fingers or something. They instead become buddy buddy. And now that is how they will solve conflicts from now on. Suspension of disbelief works no longer after that.</br>  <br>Again, I'm going to have to say people really need to learn what pretentious means before they use it. What you describe is the problem of realism or believablity, hence your lack of suspense of disbelief after that.<br><br>A pretentious story has nothing to do with whether or not it's believable. It means that the story's theme is pretending to be much deeper or important than it is. A good example would be if a character namedrops famous philosophers, but those philosophers nor their ideas have any relation to the story nor its themes.</br></br></br>  <br>To continue, another example of pretentiousness is to use overly convoluted metaphors, symbols, or allusions so that the author can confuse the reader into thinking that there is lots of depth in his story when there is not.<br><br>When Thor states that a warrior needs no sword, he is stating directly. He's not hiding it in fancy words, nor is Yukimura drawing confusing symbols or whatnot. It's communicated to the audience in a very direct way. That's the opposite of being pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br>But it is pretending to be deep.<br>"Killing is not the answer, violence will never solve anything". The writer is trying to shove some idealistic bs down the readers throat. Now if it turned out that something like that would not work, then okay. But the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple. That is pretentious bs.<br><br>Why are you so triggered? There are people that actually stopped liking for that crap. And not for "hurr durr no more blood and gore".</br></br></br></br>  <br> if it turned out that something like that would not work <br>And I'm 100% sure it will not work.</br></br>  <br>I'm only triggered because people like you literally have no idea what pretentious is, yet continue to use it. Perhaps excusable if english is your 2nd or 3rd language, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br><br>Again, the message is not pretending to be deep in any way. Pretentiousness is concerned with the delivery of a message, not the content of its message. Its simply what it is. A stance advocating pacificsm. Its no more or no less pretentious than saying something like "violence is appropriate in certain circumstances."<br><br> the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple <br><br>Except we see directly IN THE STORY, that the solution is NOT that simple. Thorfinn's belief in pacifism is being continually challenged. And even if he himself doesn't pick up a sword, he can't make other people stop fighting either. He couldn't prevent Arneis's death nor her from utterly losing hope in the world. He can't do anything about the baby's family because he knows that blood feuds are an integral part of viking culture. It's like you completely missed every plot development in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> vinland <br> pretensious </br></br>  Viking mead&gt;sake  <br>Now that is pretentious.<br><br>I would understand if you all argued about a good manga instead of this below average shounen stuff (Shuukan Shounen Magazine). And Vagabond is okay I guess. Read Blade of Immortal instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Guiness&gt;Apple Cider&gt;Rice Sake&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beer&gt;Viking Mead<br><br>Objective fact, Scandinavian true blood.</br></br></br>  <br> not a single piece of argument offered <br><br>Right, go on and keep misusing the word pretentious like a retard. As they say, ignorance is bliss, or is even that phrase too "pretentious" for you?</br></br></br>  So what have YOU been doing with your life?  <br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br>  <br>Blade of the Immortal is pretty cool guy, eh?</br>  Sorry drinker-kun, got the wrong post<br><br><br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's truly and utterly worthless arguing with idiots. I don't know why I bothered to begin with.</br>  <br>Indeed. So glad is not trying to be like Vagabond, Shigurui and Vinland Saga.</br>  <br> this fucking guy </br>  <br>Not useful. I can confirm, I'm a master swordsman.</br>  <br>Whittling your own bones to use as a weapon was way edgier than anything that ever happened in any of the three you mentioned though.</br>  <br>What's your name, kid?</br>  <br> I've no name to give... a man of your skill... <br>SO HARDBOILED!</br></br>  <br>I am now afraid to read it, because of you.<br><br>Is it his shit taste or is it also good?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not bad at all. It's just silly. I mean it's about a guy who can't be killed because he's full of worms that fix him up, like Fry in that one episode.</br>  <br>Masturbating.</br>  <br>How many times a day do you do it?</br>  <br> Sasaki Kojiro </br>  <br>Too many Kojiros.</br>  <br>I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness!</br>  <br>8</br>  <br>Waiting for more chapters of Vagabond.</br>  <br>I wish had the appropriate cap from Starless handy for this one.</br>  <br> Everyday until we like it </br>  <br> I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness! <br><br>as long as the message is interesting/original/new/ or done well is all good. after that one idiotic one chapter where thofin get punched without getting crippled i dropped it hard.</br></br></br>  <br> dropping a manga because of the manliest thing since forever <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>All creatures are made to compete, pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak.</br>    <br>Competing does not equal murdering everybody and chasing some vague concept of honor.</br>  <br>B-but muh culturally mandated honor killings!</br>  <br>So many spooks in one post that it became terrifying.</br>  <br><br>I was going to give it a read. nvm, looks like the mc is a beta faggot.</br></br>  <br> pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak. <br><br>You have no fucking idea what you are talking about if you actually believe this. Competition and pacifism are both necessary for the continued existence of the human species.</br></br></br>  <br>All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place.<br>Thorfinn is very good at fighting and he is an idiot for not taking advantage of that.<br><br><br>He doesn't become the main character until a fair while in. It's very good up until that point, would recommend reading it then dropping it like Thorfinn clearly was a child repeatedly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> risking your life for others and being a martyr is a way of a beta faggot. </br>  <br>I think you might have stumbled upon the best definition of a beta there is, well done.</br>  <br> every feeling and thought stems from this place <br>This is a blatant reductionism. Even some apes are not that simple.</br></br>  <br>now I know why people mention naruto in this thread. even more reason to not touch it with a billion mile long stick.</br>  <br>Every creature is that simple</br>  <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate <br>No. But humans have the will to realize this simple fact and go against their instincts.</br></br>  <br>Even in viking society there was a balance to be maintained, a culture with a hierarchy too strongly defined by individual martial strength will underdevelop in many other ways. Thus it benefits all of humans in a society with a certain degree of pacifism so both strong and weak can enjoy comforts.<br><br><br>This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive. Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly.<br><br>Come on, really? Altruism==nardo?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it the time to post hat pictures?</br></br>  This is no longer about vagabond. Everything have turned into layman-tier sophistry. Unsightly seeing a bunch of teens acting like something more.  <br>One fucking post was enough to derail the thread completely. It's marvelous.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how this "X is naruto, t. edgelord" troll is still successful, shit's been around forever.</br>  <br>That is not what I'm talking about. I meant the "thank god it's not as pretentious as Vinland"-post.</br>  <br>That is essentially on the same axis of retardation at a lesser degree. Anything that deals with "morals" in a less than objectivist fedoralevel way is reduced to either pretentious, somehow religious or for children.</br>  <br>Will and reason are slaves to emotion. The root of everything you do in your conscious mind is going to be "because i felt like it" and the root of every feeling is the desire to garner resources and reproduce.<br><br><br> This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive <br>Show me anything not rooted in that.<br><br> Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly. <br>I'm not at all saying it's in every persons best interest to go on psychotic killing sprees. Humans cooperate because we gain from it. On a personal level we also do it because we believe we gain from it.<br>Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Readers here need to seek constant validation that they got taste that agrees with the majority. So when one of their mainstream so-so manga(s) get called it for what it actually is, they get triggered. I doubt the posters original intention was actually that though.</br>  <br>Since you acknowledge empathy and say humans are ruled by emotions, perhaps you can understand how some people are more ruled by the emotion of empathy and some less? It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal.</br>  I love how suddenly everyone has become super ostentatious with their words.  <br> trying to shame me into agreeing to the hivemind when I'm anonymous <br>Don't bother. Enlightened by my intellect as I am, I understand that there will be no lasting consequences for me no matter what I say.<br>Do you understand that? There is literally nothing you can do to hurt me in any way, your opinion is completely and utterly worthless.</br></br></br>  <br>because the easiest evasion/derailment there is is to point out "hurr cant english gtfo underageb&amp;"<br><br><br>who the fuck talked about hurting? people just think what you're saying is ridiculous and that's for you to care or not care about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he already got you to reply, your inferiority complex have already subconsciously gone on full display for everyones pleasure to mock.</br>  <br> It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal. <br>I don't directly feel like that, but I am convinced it is the essence of every living creature.</br></br>  <br> A kiddo trying to call out another poster while failing basic capitalization rules learned in elementary school. <br><br>How did you even manage to be worse than the guy you´re calling out?</br></br></br>  <br> ostentatious <br>Nigga, I don't even know what is the meaning of the word.<br><br> Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that. <br>You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded.</br></br></br></br></br>  I award the fedora-thread of the year to this!  <br> spooks <br><br>Stirner is that you? On my /a/?</br></br></br>  This thread sure went into a strange place.  <br>Gutts is a beta cuck.</br>  <br>You're a funny guy and your dick is huge. Now that you got that, will you leave?</br>  <br>No, I'm dead.</br>  So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about seinen MCs growing up as humans?  <br> You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded. <br><br>Thing is Thorfinn is a dumb guy. The guy lacks both smarts, balls and a goal in life. Let us say that his deus ex machina trick failed (as it should, but didnt because muh morale message). Everyone in the farm would get slaughtered, well, everyone that is left. What good writing would instead do, is have him apply all his years of warring around with Askeladd to counter back Cans army. Traps, guerrilla warfare and leadership. But hey, fuck good writing and let us all go the path of Naruto, path of NARUTO DATTEBAYO.<br><br>Waste of potential is what this manga is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Contrary to what you might believe, it is possible to resolve issues through talking, and this has been done in real life many times.</br>  <br>then we would not be talking about vinland, since that is a shonen shit.</br>  <br>So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about MCs growing up as humans?</br>  <br>Fuck that. All MCs should be ubermensches embracing their instincts, imposing their unstoppable will on others and inflicting as much pwnage as possible. All in all it's what humanity is about.</br>  <br>thread is about being pretentious. get with the program.</br>  What you still need to realize is the extent of implications of being herd animals. Surely humanity's first and foremost incentive and source of emotion is that of survival instinct, but for herd animals this is also applied on the group level. It follows that it's anything but against nature in extreme cases for individuals to even give their lives for the continued survival of their group. The degree differs greatly from person to person and modern society structures and groups has made it a giant clusterfuck but take family as an example. Do you care about your family, or only about making kids and money? Do you honestly just see them as another resource?  <br>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</br>  <br> The guy lacks both smarts, balls and a goal in life <br>Him lacking smarts is the only agreeable point in your sentence. The goal in life was literally spoken out loud by him.</br></br>  <br>no one said that, you have to stop putting your words into the other posts. ya tits, calm them.</br>  <br>At that point it was best not to fight, but to go the path of a pacifist when you're really good at fighting and have spent your whole life up to that point training to fight is completely retarded.<br><br><br>He only got through that because plot, he's not a smooth enough talker to rely on that.<br><br><br>You mean getting delusional to protect their ego.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hold on, let me open up my thesaurus. Have to check what words that havent been used yet.</br>  <br> because plot <br>Everything happens because of the plot.<br><br>How about calling Thorfinn a conscientious objector?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's either that, or a complete lack of idealistic traits of characters and acknowledgment that we're only animals and altruism is completely pointless.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> At that point it was best not to fight, but to go the path of a pacifist when you're really good at fighting and have spent your whole life up to that point training to fight is completely retarded <br>Why is it retarded again? Because it doesn't always work?</br></br>  <br>Jesus, you have to break your tendency of saying obvious things. No shit mate. It just was not the time nor place for it. But, hey, my plot armor can resolve anything. Guy do not have the knack for negotiations, he barely talked under all them years of killing. Again, my plot armor.</br>  Let's all calm down for a bit and take moment to appreciate the vastness of nature and how we are all insignificant.  I just finished the arc where Musashi fights the 70 dudes from Yoshioka. Holy shit man, that was such an intense fight.  <br>It's hard to do that from the indoors and particularly the basement.</br>  <br>Pal. I read the whole thread and was to spell out my mind on the subject while trying to avoid the p word. But Odin spare my soul. Dude. That was pretentious.</br>  <br>Then appreciate your inner universe.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EIV<wbr>gSuuUTwQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> I just finished the arc where Musashi fights the 70 dudes from Yoshioka. Holy shit man, that was such an intense fight. <br><br>avoid vinland if you like that.</br></br></br>  <br>And his emotions change m8, it's called CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. He decides there's nothing good about killing and that it will only bring more killing. Empathy is a valid, basic human emotion that you can develop or suppress like any other both in individuals and in groups.</br>  <br>I'm bad at constructing coherent speech and maybe am stupid, but I'm certainly not pretentious.</br>  <br>And everyone would love that if it was handled with good writing. Too bad, it went Naruto on our asses. Everything got solved conveniently and unrealistically. Thorfinn never got challenged on his belief. If Canute would have tested his convictions by offing Einar, and see if Thorfinn would stand by his new found ideals. Then bravo. But no, is magically resolved everything. <br><br>That is bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the last time he saw the guy he tried to kill him then got sold into slavery by him. Yes he was merciful by letting him live but still completely content having him be a slave for the rest of his life. All he knew about the guy now was that he was a ruthless conqueror and really wanted this farm.<br><br>He had no reason to believe this would work and when he saw it did he was actually surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you humans are the most significant creation on earth</br>  <br> I'm bad at constructing coherent speech and maybe am stupid, but I'm certainly not pretentious. <br><br>I would say is more like you do not know how to choose your words. <br><br>Wheredoyouthinkweare-scrubs.jpeg.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is called asspull</br>  <br>There is nothing inherently good about character development, if he lost his mind and started eating shit it would be character development. And frankly that would be better than this which might be the most tired trope in all of literature.</br>  <br> He had no reason to believe this would work and when he saw it did he was actually surprised. <br><br>As mentioned, is bad writing. Just let the pretentious-fag be.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't follow. I thought we agreed that not to fight was the best choice in that situation.<br><br>I asked why do you think pacifism is retarded in general.</br></br></br>  <br>Pacifism is not retarded in general. And it might not even be retarded under the viking age. But how it was handled in Vinland was retarded.</br>  <br>Trying to fight in that specific situation would be a bad idea but going guerrilla or just running away would be much better than going to talk with a guy you have no reason to believe will listen to you.<br><br>I don't dislike pacifism really, but it usually comes from a delusion trying to protect the ego</br></br></br>  <br> read 1 sentence, stop <br> compare pacifism with eating shit <br>I even agree that it's a generally boring development since first reading crime and punishment but please. I'm not going to debate against it being an asspull that he survived.</br></br></br>  Went into this expecting Vagabond discussion. Instead, we have pretend to be autistic-Oxford-dropsouts.<br><br>Can we all agree on the following and move on?<br><br>- Vagabond is awesome so let us discuss it<br>- Shigarui is too edgy<br>- Naruto was good untill Chunnin exam<br>- Vinland was good untill farm arc<br>- Mountain MC is awesome<br>- We stop being pretentious now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>English is not my native language if that helps.<br><br><br> Everything got solved conveniently and unrealistically <br>I thought that is the same manga where there's horse punching, single-handedly fucking up squads of enemies unarmed and talking heads of dead fathers. But I understand your complaints. Asspulls can be infuriating, for sure. Especially if the story pretends to be somewhat down to earth.<br><br>Though what I don't understand is your particular claim that for it to be realistic everything should end as dark as possible and that Thorfinn never got challenged on his belief. He was challenged. He willfully endured the beating. Why do you think his convictions should've been tested at that time by offing Einar?<br><br>I think you're mixing your doubt of his ideals and bad writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>niggger</br>  <br>No, you're a fucking retard and all your posts in this thread have equally been retarded. And you still have no idea what pretentious means.</br>  <br> Naruto was good untill Chunnin exam <br>Compared to what? Vagabond? It has always been shit then.<br><br> Vinland was good untill farm arc <br>Yes. During the farm arc it became great.<br><br> Mountain MC is awesome <br>He's okay. But I must say that the ending is a perfect example of an asspull.  Ironically enough I'd even say that some imagery in the manga were pretentious. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i admit. first time seeing a live meltdown. stop being triggered. your reactions only breeds more bait.</br>  <br>1.<br>Compared to manga in general. It taught children world wide about friendship, about the horrors of child soldiers, the consequences of playing ninja and it had a good variety of characters. So even if you disliked the MC, there´s always the edge guy, or the smart guy or whatever floats your boat. It just drove it´s great concept to the ground by beating it´s morale like a dead horse until the horse have turned into soil. Don´t be a hipster, it was a good manga before Chunnin exam.<br><br>2. <br>Nope, it turned a chance to become great and descended into mediocrity. No, it became even worse the mediocre. Since the potential it had was matched very rarely. Is tragic, but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original. <br><br>3.<br>Well written character development. Is rare, so whenever I see it, I need to commend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original <br>Mainstream audience always wanted it to be vikings doing viking things.</br></br>  <br>As in pillaging cities.</br>  <br>Berserk is very philosophical, it just can be lost amongst all the blood because it isn't as obvious.</br>  <br>It got to be blatant and IN YOUR FACE to count.</br>  <br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL <br>Mate, he's working on REAL consistently for more than ten years - chapter every other month, volume every year. Vagabond is the series hindered by many hiatuses.</br></br>  <br>God, remembering when Naruto was about struggling within a fucked up system of child soldiers and even had themes like the powerful getting away with slavery (hyuugas) and all kinds of cool shit.<br>Then it got stupider and stupider because Kishi overfocused on friendship to the point where it was like a creepy guy chasing his ex.<br><br>Then at the end they all submit to the system of shinobi wherein children are exploited and turned into soldiers for the sake of the village's economy. 10/10 absolutely fucked it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How boring were your childhood? Did you never play Viking with your friends? Did you never read history books of the viking era as a kid? Did you watch the Viking series that started some year ago?<br><br>Can you not relate to simple escapism? You now have both my pity and sympathy. Poor sod.</br></br></br>  <br>The romantization of Musashi and his actions in the early part of the manga are torn down by the later part's message and his character growth.</br>  You know what's pretentious? This thread.  <br>What has this all to do with me? The poster I replied to said that it pandered to mainstream, which is not true.</br>  <br>Bitch, please. People do not want the same thing over and over again. Maybe at most, they could take another viking raid with Ask viking party. People wanted Thor to grow up. And he did, just in a mainstream way, for the mainstream readers. I mean the author basically went all SJ on us. Not being mainstream was if he would become a new kind of Viking leader. One that is against the king. But it went all unoriginal on us.</br>  <br>Mein nigger. The worst thing is that people have forgotten when it was good. All they remember is the trainwreck it is today.</br>  <br>You said it brother.</br>  <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place. <br>Well, there was that one guy who 2500 years ago based the world's most complete system of thought and action on the fact that not only this is true but that it is also the cause of all distress and therefore should not be embraced...</br></br>  <br>Appeal to authority is a fallacy, also<br> the world's most complete system of thought <br> 2500 years ago <br>heh..</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not appeal to authority. The implication is that saying that kind of thing as a final note is stupid because people a billion times smarter than you have thoroughly analyzed it and argued for something completely different.<br><br>I hope that you at least got who I was talking about, and why the 2500 year gap means absolutely nothing.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm 22 <br> haven't learned anything at all </br></br></br>  <br>Are you dying?</br>  <br>Shigurui is not edgy, Vinland is still good.</br>  <br> Shigurui is not edgy <br>It is. It's on purpose, but it is very edgy.</br></br>  <br>I really didn't feel that way though. Like, the brutality is there for an actual reason, rather than shock value, like in most other stuff that's called edgy.</br>  I know Matahachi was supposed to be the mostrealistic character, but he keeps on regressing back to his old self. Like, no actual development. At least grow up and be yourself, no matter what others think.<br><br>Meanwhile, Takezo, who was just a run of the mill savage, became refined and learnt to control his savagery and only show it in fights, improved greatly.<br><br>Reread after reread, I try and feel sympathetic towards Matahachi, but he just infuriates me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I should have said "it does it for a purpose" instead of on purpose.<br><br><br>Well, Matahachi is weak especially in spirit. He has to get strong in order to stop being a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Matahachi never grew up, that's the point. He was always a manchild who couldn't look out for himself on the long term.</br>  <br>But if it is done with purpose other than "to be edgy", isn't it not-edgy then? I mean, it's like, meaningful and stuff. I dunno, maybe I'm using this word wrong.</br>  <br>No wonder. He'll never change, and in the end he never rekindled his friendship with Takezo. <br><br>Unrelated, but I like how much growth Takezo went through in just 4 years. By the end of the 1 v 70 fight, he looks like he was 40, even though he was still 22-28.</br></br></br>  <br>Maturity of the spirit and harsh life in the wilderness does make for some premature aging.</br>  <br>The nipple eating wasn´t edgy? The guy making human mashed potatoes wasn´t edgy?</br>  <br>It's edgy, but the edge has a non-edgy purpose which is to show how terrible people with power, physical or otherwise, could become.<br>It's just a buzzword anyway, don't think too much about it.</br></br>  <br>I really don't think it was. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the word "edgy" is not synonymous with gruesome or brutal, is it?</br>  <br> The implication is that saying that kind of thing as a final note is stupid because people a billion times smarter than you have thoroughly analyzed it and argued for something completely different <br> It's not an appeal to authority <br><br> the 2500 year gap means absolutely nothing <br> human knowledge has gotten nowhere in 2500 years </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That occurs irl as well, strangely.</br>  <br>That's what I was referring to.</br>  <br> world's most complete system of thought and action <br>Sounds kinda biased.

Is that it?<br>Again, it was just to highlight that the position you claimed was stupid and invalid by was seen as the exact opposite by some others through history.<br>As for the years, again refer to the previous post.<br><br><br>Correct. Yeah I'm biased and sure it's not free from criticism, but it would be bad if it was free from it anyway. The vast range of commentaries, explanations, methods and reformulations and diverse forms of practice would probably not have happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*At least for me</br>  <br> there has been progress on knowledge of thyself </br>  <br>Tell me the limit of your understanding, and I will show you where to go from there.</br>  i liked the farming arc  <br>Is there a self?</br>  <br>This is good.</br>  <br>Yes. There is also an "I" and a "me".</br>  <br> So if a person is an authority, his arguments become invalid when people who are not authorities make an argument? Is that it? <br>No, to say someone's argument is invalid because they're an authority is a fallacy. Likewise, to say someone's argument is invalid because they are stupid or because someone in authority says it is, is also a fallacy.<br>You didn't actually make argument.</br></br></br>  <br>How to be good?</br>  <br>vagi farm or vini farm?</br>  <br>Read Better Angels of Our Nature, it seems we've been doing fine, just fine.</br>  <br>Matahachi and Takezo are foils of each other.<br><br>Both face troubles and hardships. Takezo looks inwards and improves himself, and thus overcomes them. He is strong is spirit, but he is also honest to himself and that is the most important thing.<br><br>Matahachi does realize he has faults, but instead of truly trying to fix them he tries to cover them up and put up a facade, saying that it will be alright because the lies he says now won't be lies when he is stronger.<br><br>Matahachi is a lot of people's most sympathetic character because he represents human failure and our sometimes perceived inability to change and improve ourselves, no matter what we do. Takezo is an ideal, someone who can truly fulfill their potential, but Matahachi is far more realistic, even if he is somewhat extreme in the other way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but  I like both. </br>  <br>vagabond</br>  <br>I didn't make an argument and never said I did. Others have done so in this thread and outside of it, including very intelligent people, and I just pointed that out. <br>Pointing out that intelligent people have done so isn't to imply that they must necessarily be right and the non-authority must be wrong, it's to imply that the position must be a tiny bit deeper than something that can be rekt by a 2-line post on 4chin.</br></br>  <br>Both are great in their own way.</br>  <br>the anime series is actually pretty good and captured the atmosphere brilliantly.<br><br>Yeah Shigurui is my favorite manga ever, its social criticsm aspect is also brilliant in a way.</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit you have no argument against me?</br>  In memoriam.  <br>I haven't read it, so I don't really have much to say. Though it seems like the author is very optimistic about human nature and thinks that we're getting milder and live practically in peace. My opinion differs.<br>I see yesterdays brothers and sisters kill each other for nothing and not in some forgotten-by-god place. I see radicalism uprising. I see people forgetting what is really important and sell their lives to consumerism. I see lonely souls begging for affection, while discussing chinese cartoons every day.<br>Yes, we live in a relatively safe period of time. But was this a result of a human progress or just a fad, just a reaction on two world wars and a cold one? And can you really call this peace "progress"? We are safe and we rarely feel hunger. Our lowly instincts can be satisfied. But it's not a progress of the mind. It's merely scientific one. People still suffer from the same old question "what is the meaning of all this".<br><br> And yes, this is pretentious. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> opinion differs <br>And the statistics disagree with your opinions.

I thought it all stems from gathering and procreation. How can the desire not to gather and not to procreate stem from the desire to be different? Difference as in having coloured feathers can help to attract a female, but how can the desire not to have coloured feathers and have them as plain as possible or not to have them at all can be of any help for attraction? If it's our primal desire then it kinda defeats it's own purpose.<br><br> use your will to put yourself back on track <br>Wait a minute.

He was a sword saint, yes, but in all his battles, his actual age isn't known.</br>  <br><br>...We go against our instincts of gathering and resources and procreate?<br><br>No, we don't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fairly sure outsourcing is a bigger nowadays.</br>  <br> outsourcing <br>Is it a metaphor for NTR?</br></br>  <br> Do you care about your family, or only about making kids and money? Do you honestly just see them as another resource? <br><br>You have no idea how much you are ruled by your emotions.<br><br>Yes, you care for your family. That's just a coping mechanism in your brain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Humans are slaves to their emotions as children. It is up to you as an adult to see above this and decide your own purpose in life, and what you really want to do. People who saw this in history were often prophets, holy leaders, etc.</br>  <br><br>...Outsourcing, is simply a modern refined way of gathering more resources. What is your point?<br><br>You think that just because we created a system where we don't need to DIRECTLY get what we need, we don't get what we need? Because you know, that's just a shortcut.</br></br></br></br>  <br>... You are a faggot </br>  <br> his actual age isn't known. <br><br>Because we don't know his exact age. It is around his 20s though, i'm not sure knowing the exact age would much different.<br><br>To be fair I don't remember the manga very well, i'm sure it was romanticezed enough and I remember there was some divergences with the book.<br><br>But the book had a really great history research on the subject, although, like any other literature, it can be romantized sometimes. Even though, Musashi is a fucking legend for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Humans are slaves to their emotions as children <br><br>And as adults too. All their lives.<br><br> It is up to you as an adult to see above this and decide your own purpose in life, and what you really want to do <br><br>I'm not sure what you're trying to convey, some higher purpose or meaning or some shit like that? That's fine, but really, all people do is get stuff to live confortably and then die.<br><br>Prophets and holy leaders were just people that exploited other people's emotions/faith for their own purposes, again, I don't think I'm getting what you mean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Prophets and holy leaders were just people that exploited other people's emotions/faith for their own purposes <br><br>That is your opinion. <br><br>But sorry, I kinda lost myself and forgot where I was. I'm religious, so I don't belive at all that were are slaves to our emotions. We have freewill to control our emotions or be controlled by them. It is possible to NOT be a slave of your own primal emotions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do some guys do the whole "nice guy" thing and orbit girls and act like huge faggots? Because they think it will help them get laid. Does it work? Fuck no.<br> Wait a minute. If all this is biological and all stems from our simple desires then how can I use my will, if free will doesn't exist? <br>You're not arguing with me anymore</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you want to control your emotions? Is it because you  feel like it? </br>  <br>No. It's because I'm a human. I'm not an animal who lives on desires and primal instinct. I can control these desires and let one floruish, and the other to be suppressed. That is to be human, and have sentience and a higher intelligence.</br>  <br>You DESIRE to control your other desires you say?</br>  <br> Why do some guys do the whole "nice guy" thing <br>They do it on purpose - to get laid. The desire to break away from getting laid completely trumps the instinct. It doesn't work for it anymore, it works directly against it.<br><br> You're not arguing with me anymore <br>Yeah. I made quite a leap. I meant that if we assume that everything we do and think is according to our instincts, then it means that the need (if the need is real and it is) to break away is an instinct too and you can't choose to stop thinking about it. You have no choice. No free will.<br><br>Thus you become an absolute slave. Your life becomes a paradox. I asked how to be good, you answered: to live according the knowledge that no matter what we think we do everything for the lowest of our instincts. Not only is it impossible to be good when your whole existance denies itself, it's quite hard to even live that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't try and twist words to fit your point of view. This is far beyond language. If you're the same anon as before, then I know that you're an atheist, and you will therefore never agree with my opinion.<br><br>This life is transient. The urge to gather resources and procreate is embedded in all organisms. That is a must for most who  desire  peace of mind in this world. However, you must also realise that you can live without these, and can live happily because we have free will, something animals and organisms don't have.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a desire. No one denies that. It's not primal though.</br>  <br>the need to have offspring is primal.</br>  <br>It is. What's your point?</br>  <br>This anon here  said that need isn't primal.</br>  <br> Second only to Berserk in its genre <br>You mean boat trip?</br></br>  <br>He wasn't talking about procreation, he was talking about the want to control your own emotions. This is not a primal want.</br>  <br>It's the same person. I didn't state that procreation is NOT a primal desire. The desire to stop desiring procreation is not primal, that's what I'm saying.</br>  <br><br> The desire to stop desiring procreation is not primal <br><br>It's something only a human could do, since we have free will.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is as close and big to Vagabond as our sun is to VY Canis majoris.</br></br>  <br>Acting like you don't want to get laid can also be traced back to wanting to get laid. Actually not desiring to get laid can be a defense mechanism to protect the ego. Or it can be a result of other things. Living creatures desire to live to gain and to breed, and these sometimes conflict.<br><br>When you say free will what do you mean?<br>When you say good, what do you mean?<br><br><br>I'm Agnostic.<br>Why do the things that make you happy make you happy? Because your unconscious thinks it will help you live, gain and breed. Do you want to live for misguided stimulation of your pleasure centers or for your essence as a living creature?<br><br><br>It's not, but it's rooted in primal ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes you happy or not doesn't matter. I believe in one God, who put us on this Earth to revere him for the God that he is. This world is only transient, since we will go to heaven if we are good people, regardless of what religion you are. That is what I believe.<br><br>What you are describing is all animalistic. What makes you happy or not can all be conditioned. <br><br>We have free will to do whatever we want. Absolutely anything. You can even go against your creator, or have a lifestyle that is filled with too many worldy attachments.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OK, I'll bite. The argument is that your claim of "this is the basic desire of life, the point of life, therefore we must follow it" is flawed if not wrong. That's what the others challenged you with, saying that humans aren't that simple and can't be reduced to that. I basically say the same thing as them, and remind that this was challenged even all that time ago and comprehensively argued against ("appeal to authority").<br><br>Now that we've cleared this up, what was your point going to be? Why did you ask me about your argument?<br><br><br> Prophets and holy leaders were just people that exploited other people's emotions/faith for their own purposes, <br>Depends on the person, really. The Buddha didn't do it. Confucius didn't do it. Jesus didn't do it. <br>These are factual and not a question of point of view.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> therefore we must follow it <br>Never claimed such a thing. And it's also not what the others have challenged me with</br></br>  <br>Why does god have desires?<br>What could he possibly gain from our existence?</br></br>  <br> Or it can be a result of other things <br>I subscribe to this. I don't believe it's as simple as you describe it.<br><br> When you say good, what do you mean? <br>That should've been the first answer to my initial question. We were talking about the progress of thyself and I stated that we haven't made much progress in that area, you (I don't really know if it was you or not) asked to provide some "limit". I formulated a question "how to be good". By asking this I'm really asking two questions:<br>1. Does good exist? (question about objectivity or relativity of morality)<br>2. If it does then what moral code should I subscribe to.<br><br>This is the limit. Biology doesn't answer this question. It's a philosophical question that was asked from the dawn of men. And we still don't have a final answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't something we can comprehend. How can we understand the points of view of a person who's in a higher plane of existence than us?</br>  <br> Never claimed such a thing. And it's also not what the others have challenged me with <br><br> All creatures are made to compete, pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak. <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place. <br> Thorfinn is very good at fighting and he is an idiot for not taking advantage of that. <br><br>ie,<br> competition is the way of the strong, pacifism is bullshit, therefore competition is the desirable one <br> all creatures have this primal desire to hoard resources and procreate, and competition exists because of this <br> Thorfinn, shying away from competition and by extension from what pushes you to gather resources and/or procreate despite having the skills to be successful in competition, is an idiot. Because instead of embracing his "essence of living", he goes against it, which makes him weak <br><br>People then went up against this.<br>But if you insist on not having claimed this, then what was your argument then? What did the others counter it with?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   this fucking thread   <br>It's a good thread. No longer bound by petty things like moeshit and shounenshit.</br>  <br>It is sad to think that the only reason a thread on /a/ that has Vagabond in its OP has reached several hundred replies is because of a bunch of college kids arguing over entry level philosophy.</br>  <br>Better than arguing about sniffing a loli waifu's feet, right?</br>  <br>"we already discussed vagabond to death, just like we did with all of your favorite series"<br><br>t. /a/</br></br></br>  <br>I guess that's what we get for discussing what has been discussed to death and new chapters never.</br>  <br>What else are they going to do with their philosophy education?</br>  <br>When i say it can be the result of other things i still mean things that stem from the basic desires.<br>How can i tell you how to be good if you can't tell me what you mean by good?<br><br><br>No, pacifism is as legit a strategy as violence. Making people do what you want through inflicting pain or pleasure is not that different. But Thorfinn is not skilled at competing in the social battlefield and is much better suited for the classic battlefield.<br><br><br>heh... whats the matter kid? 2deep4you? go back to your moeshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it is. Peace only works when there's stability. And to this day there isn't a single example in history where a nation can exist without the force to back it up. No hiding out in the wilderness and pitching up a flag doesn't count as a country even if no one attacks you.<br><br>Even a guy like Ghandi can't claim to be an example of perfect pacifism, since he's basically using reputation to win the hearts of others, others who have force. If Ghandi existed in a world where it was basically him vs one nation and only that nation, and anyone who followed under him wouldn't ever take up arms even if they were to get slaughtered, then the opposing nation would shit on them and enslave them within 5 minutes.<br><br>However that doesn't mean Vinland handled it poorly per se, since Thorfinn really doesn't achieve anything long lasting in history anyways. He's just this dude who went to North America, settled for awhile, and got driven off. <br><br>From a historical stand point, he's practically a nobody who just happened to be put in the books. There's nothing significant about him that would make him a mile stone let alone unique. So he was destined to be a loser casual that ends up knocking up what's her face a few times and dies in a shitty place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread sure is something.<br><br> When will Otsu and Takezo fuck? </br></br>  <br>When Takezo realises the onthological incompleteness of the point when the end of something comes to reflect that which has yet to be</br>  <br>nah, vagabond is garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, I always thought that would be the best time for him to pump Otsu full of his cum.</br>  <br>Profligate</br>  <br> How can i tell you how to be good if you can't tell me what you mean by good? <br>Do people's actions have a value?

Like an instrument to achieve something. But it can be a thing in itself. It can be an end, it can be an aim. It also can be a mere instrument.<br>You're talking about Thorfinn like he is mean. His actions should be of purpose. He is well suited for battlefield but it doesn't mean that it would be good for him to engage in violence.<br><br> Actually it is.

Not everyone thinks like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*You're talking about Thorfinn like he is A mean</br>  <br>I would be more inclined to believe that if new chapter threads didn't only receive ~20-30 replies. <br><br>I'm not expecting discussion of any of the symbolism in the work and I'm definitely not expecting a fast moving thread like a weekly release thread on Thursday like for One Piece or something, but that threads die in only a couple dozen replies for a new chapter is a bit odd. It's the same way for REAL (back when we still got chapters of that).</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, this whole sentence is a disaster.<br>"You're talking about Thorfinn like he is a mean (to an end) and his actions should always be of purpose either to himself or to somebody else."</br></br>  <br>I don't know how anyone could LIKE Kojiro.</br>  <br>None of this is really deep. Just asking questions we as humans have naturally asked for millennia does not mean you are breaking new grounds or creating convincing arguments. <br><br>Though the idea of life's greatest questions being answered on an anime image board is pretty humorous to think about.</br></br></br>  <br>  Making people do what you want through inflicting pain or pleasure is not that different. <br>You don't necessarily make people do things with pacifism though. It's not necessarily a way of forcing compliance. It can be a tool like violence (just another way or continuing political objectives, like Clausewitz put it for war if I'm not mistaken) but it doesn't have to be.<br><br><br> And to this day there isn't a single example in history where a nation can exist without the force to back it up <br>The concept of "nation" is a very recent one. Before that it was just people who didn't really care about whether they were ruled by X or Y, they had more pressing concerns. The political powers and structures of X and Y, of course, required military force to protect themselves. But what if one of those structures said forget it and submitted to the other from the get go? Is that necessarily bad? It all depends on the circumstances. It might end in slavery for the submitting group, or it might just end with their integration, since they're not and never were enemies in the first place. <br>Tons of things factor into this and the issue is much more complicated than "but if you don't fite you will be rekt". History isn't really short on examples of groups which, while mighty on paper, ended up being decimated because all factors were simply against them.<br>And there's the question of individual vs collective pacifism as well as "true" and "wrong" pacifism.<br><br><br>Never. Just like the real Musashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> herd animals <br>Primates aren't herd animals, faggot</br></br>  <br> vinland saga <br> shonen <br>Not for years</br></br></br>  <br> Do people's actions have a value?

Not everyone thinks like that. <br>That comment isn't actually me but I think he's right for the reason state above.<br><br><br>I don't know how much more obvious i can make bait</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All desires ultimately stem from the desires to live, to gain, to breed. <br>And when you end those desires?<br>Even before that, when those desires are there by default, but your actions don't bring any gains and partners regardless of the fact that they stem from those desires?</br></br></br>  <br> You don't necessarily make people do things with pacifism though. It's not necessarily a way of forcing compliance. It can be a tool like violence (just another way or continuing political objectives, like Clausewitz put it for war if I'm not mistaken) but it doesn't have to be. <br>But you do it because you hope it will be. Consciously or unconsciously.<br><br> The concept of "nation" is a very recent one. Before that it was just people who didn't really care about whether they were ruled by X or Y <br>If you want to talk about history you should start studying it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And when you end those desires? <br>What do you mean by end those desires?<br><br> Even before that, when those desires are there by default, but your actions don't bring any gains and partners regardless of the fact that they stem from those desires? <br>Why do betas orbit around women? They think it will get them laid. Will it? No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The concept already existed in the story of Vinland, so I don't see your point. And what you are arguing isn't actually pacifism. That's just common sense and playing it smart. Pacifism is actually refusing to fight like Ghandi no matter what, and at most is what Thorfinn is doing.<br><br>It would never work, far too many people would exploit you unless you could be holstered up as a poster boy like Ghandi and thereby act as a means of defaming others through righteousness and morality, which is just political warfare.<br><br>Being reserved and merciful isn't pacifism. At least not the way it is with Thors and Thorfinn, which is the root of all discussion. If you wanna argue about what defines pacifism and it's borders, feel free to with someone else I'm just pointing out nothing done in this manga pertaining pacifism works, and in fact the historical account of Vinland Saga will prove this. <br><br>Don't bring Canute into this either, he's just finally learned to become an able minister and not just an anti-hero.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But you do it because you hope it will be. Consciously or unconsciously. <br>says you<br><br> If you want to talk about history you should start studying it. <br>k, kid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not that I can see no <br>You don't see it. Others do. We are in disagreement. That's it. We both make a leap of faith. There was little to no progress in this question in history (especially if you consider yourself a moral objectivist). The only thing that progressed about it is the framework of the question by the hands of Kant for example. <br><br> The desire to be nice <br>What the hell is nice? To be nice (or to be good) in his culture means to kill and conquer. He goes against it, because he feels that it's not a good way to live. he believes that being a "true warrior" is a value above honour.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And what you are arguing isn't actually pacifism.  <br>It is though. Pacifism isn't necessarily refusing to fight no matter what, but it can be. This in itself is a point of contention, hence why I mentioned "true" and "wrong" pacifism, which people define in various ways. This isn't an issue that appeared yesterday, it's been a dividing point since quite some time.<br>Gandhi's own pacifist stance was something that was especially brought in by the circumstances, it was a means to an end. His life reveals that he didn't actually subscribe to absolute pacifism. Also when we talk about Gandhi and pacifism, of course, we don't actually mean just Gandhi the man but also his group. That is one dynamic. I've actually haven't read Vinland yet and so didn't say anything specific to it, but from what I gather Thorfinn is an individual who has made his choice due to personal reasons. That is another dynamic. Hence why "And there's the question of individual vs collective pacifism".</br></br></br>  Episode 1 soon, are you turbofags prepared for the AOTY?<br><br>Can't wait to see Mia's boobs or a huge white screen.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if she is human or not.
