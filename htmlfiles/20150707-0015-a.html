[ Do people just pretend to like Tomoko?<br><br>She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude.</br></br>  She thinks shit about people occasionally in her own mind. Does that make her a terrible person? I don't think that makes anyone a terrible person, and I think everyone does it. <br><br>Also, she suffers from severe social anxiety to the point of throwing up. The fact that she still keeps trying to overcome that and puts herself out there is admirable.</br></br>   Sounds like a 4channer.   <br>I like her more then the usual Mary Sue.</br>  beaners from /v/ have latched onto her, just report any avatarfagging you see  I'm a shitty person, why would I not enjoy another shitty person? If anything, a non-shitty-person waifu would be hard to deal with if you're a shitty person.  <br>My type of girl</br>  <br> She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. <br>That's what abandonment does to you, she needs a healing hug.</br></br>  <br>I don't hate myself so why would I hate her?</br>  <br>Do people just pretend to like Asuka?<br><br>She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude.</br></br></br>  Because Tomoko would be closer to life if she was a 300 lbs neckbearded basement dweller with her vast collection of yaoi/disney movies  <br>What has she done that's shitty? <br><br>Her family are the ones that are terrible people.</br></br></br>  <br>There are tomoko avatarfags on /a/? I don't think there are people who even like her</br>  Just like me!  <br>Nice butt in shiny latex bodysuit.</br>  <br>It's your fault that she isn't popular.</br>  <br>what "bad" thing has she actually done? Sure she thinks some bad things of people from time to time because she doesn't know them, but who doesn't? Our conscious thoughts don't reflect our true opinion, otherwise we would do terrible things all day long.<br>Actually considering how much she loathes other people and still tries her best to make them like her, i would say she is one admirable person</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  She's just like me a girl with SA<br><br>now don't hit on me silly boyz!</br></br>  <br>She's lazy, spiteful and she blames everyone else for her problems (just like one of us).</br>  <br>While I also think Tomoko is an admirable character for her honesty, determination, and worldview, it is fact that she is inconveniencing people around her more than anything, and it is something she is sadly not aware of too much.<br><br>She is very rude to the mother and brother who are trying to help her, is a bad influence on Kii-chan she had now become a first-hand witness of, and nearly sabotaged her friendship with Komiyama for unbased and paranoid reasons. If Tomoko realises just how badly she treated those people and does something to make up for it, she's well on the road to become somebody magnificent and complete.</br></br></br>  Most people here would fuck themselves if they could, that's what Tomoko is for.  Speaking of Tomoko what happened to the tomoko drawings?  <br>OP died and never published them, rip</br>  <br>Because /a/ love themselves, and she is the /a/ incarnate</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with loving yourself.</br>  <br>What a faggot, I'll do it myself then.</br>  <br>I never said it's wrong</br>  <br> Do people just pretend to like Tomoko? <br>No</br></br>  <br> She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. <br>Fuck you too bitch</br></br>  That describes most posters on this board.  I am physically unable to finish watching episode 8. Help.  <br>You have autism.</br>  <br>I mean. that's a given.</br>  <br>Why is she a shitty person?<br><br>90% of what is shown of her are her thoughts. She doesn't say almost anything that she thinks. <br>Are you saying that people on /a/ don't think like Tomoko?</br></br></br></br>  Tomoko is literally /r9k/: the character  <br>Generally I think most people are garbage but don't say it to their face, so yes.</br>  <br>She's not the nicest person, but people typically like a person they can relate to.<br>A lot of people can emphatize with her social anxiety, sperginess and lonliness.<br><br>She's also cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Supreme autism.</br>  <br><br>Exactly. For example, I think you two are retards trying to show off how smart you are for understanding a shallow anime character, but I usually never say such things and I don't think it makes me a shit person.</br></br>   Implying Great Saiyaman isn't the best arc   I agree. The SoL element was comfy as fuck when I read it as a child.  It also has best girl in her best form.  <br> implying you're not an idiot </br>  <br>Even though I'm apparently the only one who actually likes Videl's new hairstyle, I do agree.</br>  <br>I liked Videl with short tomboy hair personally.<br>Also, Great Saiyaman is the hero the town needs, but also the hero the town wants.</br></br>   Gohan having lived a sheltered life with no actual human interaction thinks he's the absolute fucking coolest  <br> In reality he's a giant goober  <br> Both criminals and citizens alike make fun of him for it <br> He always gets super buttmad and causes unintentional property damage in his temper tantrums  <br><br>I love it so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's weird that Chichi never considered social interaction with other kids as essential to Gohan's upbringing.</br></br>  Possible spoilers for ch.71<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Also, the question about Erwin.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>進撃舞台挨拶in池袋④<br><br>先生「エルヴィンは見た目ありき」<br>　　「『パリスヒルトンを大統領に』のバックのいかにもUSA、スーパーマ<wbr>ンができそうな男性<br>　　落書きして、描いてるうちに（人物像が出来上がっていった）」<br><br>「今月号に過去のエルヴィン」<br>「団長になる過程みたいなのを」<br><br>source;https://mangahelpers.com/for<wbr>um/showthread.php/3000633-Shingeki-<wbr>no-Kyojin-Chapter-71-Spoiler-Pics-S<wbr>ummaries</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127674291 <br>Annibot why?<br><br>Why are you doing this?</br></br></br>  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>Because I love her and I will not allow her name to fade into oblivion.</br>  <br>GO to the link. It's a tweet.</br>  <br>So now that we're finally closing off Erwin's character arc, I think that his death is inevitable at this point.</br>  <br>Nothing new. It's about young Erwin in this chapter.</br>  <br>Annibot stop.<br><br>You're literally killing yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>What we already knew: <br>  the newest chapter (71) to be released in a few days (July 9th) will feature Erwin’s backstory - his “process to becoming a leader.” <br><br>So Keith flashback will definitely happen since Erwin was shown as already being in the SL in the first chapter when Keith was still commander.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her name already faded into oblivion</br>  So this is going to be a filler chapter with no infos?  <br>Yes, exactly my friend.</br>  <br>And yet I have never felt more alive.</br>  いくらなんでもジェルを兵士にしないために <br>教官が立体機動に細工してたら嫌やは <br><br><br>これありそう <br>ジェル… <br><br>More implications that Keith broke Eren's belt I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  昔も今も壁の外には壁の中の情報が知られてないんだな<br>グリシャ食いの間ミカサは蚊帳の外だったっぽい<br>という夢<br><br>ミカちゃん無実！<br><br>It sounds like Mikasa was out of the loop when Eren ate Grisha.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  No mention of MT at all?  <br>If you really expected MT then you're an idiot.</br>  <br>He's to busy fucking reiner</br>  キース「エレン……最近のお前はますますカルラに似てきたな……」<br>エレン「キース教官……！」<br>キージェル！！</br></br>  <br>Annibot read this I literally want to go through your monitor.<br><br>And punch your jew nose.</br></br></br>  <br> ;_; </br>  I'm seeing a lot of talk about there being a Keith-Carla-Grisha love triangle. Hopefully the nips are bored like us and are just trolling.  <br>Why does Isayama have such a hard on for cuckoldry?</br>  <br>He's not the most imaginative writer.</br>  <br> inb4 Eren's real father is Keith </br>  Why are there no black people? snk needs diversity.  <br>I'm suspicious of it, it sounds a bit too much like the whole thing with Erwin/Nile/Marie. <br>Also Keith apparently only met Grisha on the day he stole the coordinate.</br></br>  <br>They were wiped out along with all the other races except whites.</br>  <br>They probably have that from over here.<br>Someone was joking around with that possibility yesterday.Now it pops up a spoiler?<br>Either a high class prophet or what I said above.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga. They were wiped out.</br>  <br>Ymir is Swedish, so they're basically Somalian.<br><br>Hanji is maybe black too, it's harder to tell.</br></br></br>  キースたんはあれや ジェル見てカルラマッマは中出しセックスしたんやなーてしみじみ思うんやな<wbr>い<br><br>Keith and Carla had sex, Eren was the result which is why Eren resembles young Keith more than Grisha</br></br></wbr>  <br>It looks google translated.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I think they're just fucking around. Keith does sound like a real creep from the spoilers so far. Tampering with Eren's belts, lusting after Eren's mom. Yeah, someone's trolling.</br></br>  <br>I got it from the fujo thread.</br>  Also Marie was a whore.  This chapter sounds fucking boring so far if any of these spoilers are true.  <br>Fucking prophet.</br>  <br> So now that we're finally closing off Erwin's character arc, <br>Are we? Seems more like the chapter is about Grisha and Keith too, so there's more Erwin developments to come.<br><br> I think that his death is inevitable at this point <br>That was inevitable from the start. Only question is when.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying it isn't the samefag that's spamming that shit over 2ch </br>  <br> being this jelly because you weren't the prophet </br>  In the chapter it becomes evident that the Grisha-Keith-Carla love triangle is something similar to Eren-Jean-Mikasa. Carla/Mikasa were in love with Grisha/Eren for the longest of times, then there was Keith/Jean on the sidelines watching on.  <br><br>Please stop saying this. Those are not real Prophets.</br></br>  <br>I drew you an Annie.</br>  <br>Great.

She told him not to cum inside her but Jean did it anyway, proving that Jean is alpha.</br>  <br>They just see each other as siblings.</br>   ヒスちゃん壁マリア行きたいです <br>Historia wants to go Wall Maria</br>  <br>There's no use denying it, anon. Isayama is going to go with boring and predictable EM, especially now that it's apparently a parallel to Grisha/Carla.</br>  <br>Took her long enough.</br>  <br>Nope, he's a beta cuck.</br>  <br>You mean Armin?</br>  <br>Well of course she would abandon her loved one and her future husband -  YMIR__ </br>  <br>Jean deserves to die alone like a cuck.</br>  <br>Reunion soon.<br>Unless Ymir really did head for the walls while Historia went out.</br></br>  <br>Meh that was obvious</br>  <br>20 chapters</br>  <br>Curious: what would you have preferred as the main pairing?</br>  <br> inb4 she hears Ymir is kill </br>  <br>YH</br>  <br>This. It's not like he's going to have a working lower half by the end of this anyway.</br>  <br>Mate Jean the top shingeki that Isayama wanted him to be the main protagonist of the live action movie</br>  <br>I personally view it as the other main SNK pairing.</br>  <br>Isayama has shit taste though and he said he only likes characters because they're simple and honest.</br>  <br>I love to see her face when King Kong smashes Ymir face and then eats her in front of historia</br>  <br>Is this from dreamfag or random speculation?</br>  <br>Isayama probably cucks Jean because he likes him. Plenty of authors love to make their faves suffer.</br>  <br>You probably won't believe me, but I don't prefer any main pairing actually. I think Eren should die or go insane or face some sort of irreversible consequence at the end of the manga. Like Isayama said, romance creates unnecessary noise in the narrative.</br>    <br>Jean didn't deserve to be saved by Armin.</br>  <br>That explains a lot of MCs.</br>  <br>Wait, how come potato boy can still walk without a foot?Or is it just a case of same face?</br>  <br>Called it.</br>  <br>It's a future scenario. It hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>Nah, I do believe you. I personally don't mind it as long as it is well-written but I see your point.</br>  <br>That's just Jean's imagination when he decides to join the SL</br>  <br>Because she already said it in ch51.</br>  <br>No isayama hates Eren the only reason Eren even exist is because he needed to fit the requirement of the dense and Idiotic MC <br>Jean was originally meant to be the MC</br></br>  <br>People still doubted it.</br>  <br>I don't think Isayama is even capable of writing well-written romance. Most of them are either end up tragically or kept one-sided.</br>  <br>Source?<br>My impression was that Isayama made Eren MC because he couldn't think of anyone else and only came to like Jean while he was writing him.</br></br>  <br>Explains why Jean is such a huge cuck then.</br>  <br>I like YH and the way it is written, but to each their own.</br>  <br>Well i can't find the source but Isayama said that he wanted a Levi personality main character.<br>But the Editors didn't because you know typical shonen MC was what the editor want so Isayama had to change that</br></br>  <br>They're okay but I don't know if I'd call them a "well written romance"</br>  <br>Not really, it's quite typical, even for a lesbian "romance".</br>  Isn't Ymir his actual favorite? is that the reason why her also made her a cuck?  <br>That's the first time I heard about that. If you ever find a source, please post it.</br>  <br>Yes and most likely yes.<br>His top favorites are AT, FT, MT, Ymir, and Jean in that order.</br></br>  <br>Actually it isn't that typical. Most lesbian romance is sexualized and their orientation is emphasized whereas with YH none of that matters. It just is what it is.</br>  <br>Well not talking of the romance aspect <br>to me YH<br> EH, <br> Armin and Jean,  <br> Sasha and Connie  <br>  Levi, Hanji and Erwin  <br> Berthold and Reiner. <br>Relationship was well written.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't that typical.</br>  <br>Yeah it might take time this was along time <br>I think he said this during the end of SNK anime</br></br>  <br>Nope, most of it is angsty and pretty much identical to YH. The uglier, usually darker in colors girl is more manly and usually overshadows the cute blonde girl, angst ensues, cute blonde girl understands their love, lesbian love ensues.</br>  <br>I haven't really seen that many lesbian romances in non-yuri manga, but YH always reminded me of those het romances were male broody, selfish outcast (Ymir) falls for the cute pure girl. He mocks her and her ideals but he also wants to nail her until he finally becomes selfless to save her. YH seems more like het romance with the gender of one participant changed.</br>  <br>Get in line.I love her too and am going to legally marry her.</br>  <br>It's extremely typical.<br><br><br>I'm not only talking about manga, I mean in fiction in general. It's also really common in het romances, but it's a common trope in lesbian ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to beat me in a fight first</br>  <br>I agree. I like the YB friendship, too, and EAr is also well done.</br>  <br>Bert, please.CT a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>So you're calling it typical because appearance-wise that's what it seems like.</br></br></br>  <br>Anniebot was bert all along?</br>  <br>Personality wise too. Ymir is basically a guy.</br>  <br>Possible that I have read just different stuff than you, then. A lot of yuri manga seem to be cute best friends lesbians from what I saw. Lesbians outside of yuri seem a bit more diverse than that, though I agree that often, one is much more feminine than the other e.g. Haruka/Michiru, Antsy/Utena etc.</br>  <br>CT is best titan.</br>  YH may be typical but it is well written.  <br>Don't talk about my Husband like that<br>You wanna get squashed</br></br>  <br>Naah.</br>  <br>Not even close. You would know that if you knew how to read.<br><br><br> A lot of yuri manga seem to be cute best friends lesbians from what I saw. <br>That's the minority, not a lot. There are really few series with just cute lesbian romance, since even Madoka fall within the YH trope if you ignore the artstyle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is</br>  <br>Thanks, anon, and sure thing.<br><br><br>But do you respect her feelings on this matter?</br></br></br></br>    <br> YH is well-written <br> Anon1: No! <br> Anon2: Yes it is! <br> Anon3: No it isn't! <br><br>Repeat ad nauseum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay.</br>  Reminder that Annie and Eren already lost their Virginity to each other  <br> typical <br> well written <br>It doesn't work like that. It's meh at best. I think it's horrible but I can understand if some think it's slightly above average.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the typical for hetero romances or even for yaoi since one of the guys is always the asshole, but in yuri this is barely the case and especially not in yuri within a shounen manga.</br></br>    <br> Hanji's nose </br>  <br> Armoured Titan watching Brazzer <br>TOP KEK</br></br>  <br>She always had a hook nose.</br>  <br>You can take a concept that it typical and make something well written out of it.</br>  <br>Don't know why I kek'd so hard.</br>  <br>Not really. For hetero it's most of the time one sided and revolves around senpai noticing them, and for yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs. Yuri is usually manly girl being obsessed with girly girl.</br>  <br><br>Wow meant to quote this.<br><br><br>But seeing the Reiner tier delusion why the fuck not?</br></br></br></br></br>  No new spoilers?  <br>Sure you can, but not in YH's case.</br>  <br>  yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs <br><br>No, yaoi is manly alpha man raping a girly weak boy.</br></br></br>  <br>That too.</br>  Sorry guys I just won't fucking believe Isayama made Keith have feelings for Carla. I mean he already did this shit with JEM and Erwin/Marie/Nile and possibly BAE. He just can't reuse the same fucking plot device over and over can he?  <br>Nah.Still only at Grisha having ntr'd Keith who is actually a male Yandere and tried to kill Eren by manipulating his belt.</br>  <br> and for yaoi it's usually friends that are really close and bring bentos to each other and admire each other's abs <br>Most yaois are just plain ol' rape and the slow transformation from 'no homo' to maximum cockslut. Can't even find a goddamn homoge without rape in it.</br></br>  <br> Eren gets kidnapped <br> New team comes in only to get killed.Levi's, Mike's and Hanji's <br> Titan fight at the end of arc <br> We're just like Ouroboros! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Missed a spot.<br><br> How about doing some push-ups to help (me) hold up my weapon...? </br></br></br>  But Ushio kai ni was like months ago!

Seriously, he isn't that great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Defective Conan</br>  It doesn't focus nearly enough on the romance/romcom/harem hijinks/whatever to be called a harem manga, are you retarded?  Ai best girl  Sonoko doesn't.  <br>at most there's three, one of which he picked</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>He should fuck his mom.</br>  <br>So the Harem epidemic finally struck DC it was inevitable</br>  <br>Ai is love<br>Ai is sex<br>Ai is best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>He has chosen one since the beginning of the series. Even with his girlfriend they have almost no romantic scenes. I don't even remember the last time in a manga he's even shown any romantic interest, it is always him trying not to give himself a way and he always gets in this situation you think he would have a protocol for this already. I think maybe when they were overseas watching a tennis match.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12767054 <br>what female detective? Need more details</br>  <br>I thought that was a okish romantic thing, aside from the tower proposal.</br>  i re-started watching/reading conan back in 2012 and dropped it again in 2013 its just to much filler and kiddo episodes.<br><br>sure there are some good episodes but 9 out of 10 episodes are filler with nothing happening in them.<br><br>i still wish for some Ai hentai</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought Detective Conan is a mystery manga, not a harem. <br>Conan will not end and picks up genre as it goes. Just wait until we reach Fantasy.</br></br>  <br>Which will end first Conan or Berserk?</br>  <br>just watch the series without any fillers. Thats how I watch this series and it was great</br>  <br>He means Sera. <br><br><br>Filler as in non-organization related or anime-original?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i watched like 60 episodes when anime used to be on youtube easily. once they took it down, i didnt know what to do at the time. never picked it back up, never wanted to. i watched a few of the new movies last week, one with lupin, and they were terrible so i doubt ill pick it up<br><br>they are never going to end it anyway</br></br></br>  I just watch the movies now, doe some of dem arent great now.  <br>Shocking big news, Shinichi is a gary stu</br>  Ran is Ayumi tier  I miss pre-345 Haibara.  <br> That latest episode. <br><br>Keikaku Doori.<br><br>He can outsmart anyone. I'm guessing his mom is playing the role of Okiya Subaru and the voice thing is in the mask. That or Kaito Kid. Although I'm sure there is some trick with the Macademy Awards otherwise I see no point in leaving the T.V. on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you sure you didn't mean his dad<br>because his dad has interpol connections, a trophy wife, is a world renowned mystery writer, and apparently is even more of an encyclopedia than his son</br></br>  I can't even remember what chapter I last read. I only remember it heavily involved FBI and they went to the hospital for the final stretch.  Did anything top the moonlight sonata and the kogoro highschool(?) reunion arc yet?  <br>The reunion case was mediocre though.</br>  <br> Conan choosing Ran <br> not Haibara <br>He's going to regret it.</br></br></br>   Detective Conan <br><br>more like the never ending story.</br></br>  It's a neverending episodic shounen-harem of the worst kind.  <br> Seriously, he isn't that great. <br>You shut your dirty whore mouth. Conan is perfect. He's perfect. I wish I was a woman, so I could marry him.<br><br>I'm not being facetious, either. He's this scrawny Japanese kid, but he has the heart of a man's man. He's like this wizard out of a fairy tale that comes to help people when they're in their darkest moment. He's a real hero.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rena Mizunashi arc is bretty good</br>  <br>It's not a harem. Ran is his waifu and every other girl just gets to lick his leftovers between her thighs when he's done.</br>  <br>I hated that arc and this effeminate faggot. It annoyed me that he got to learn Conan's secret.</br>  <br>How about you read the thing before shitposting?</br>  <br>Detective conan is not a harem. But its best japanese romance manga.<br><br>It probably has like 20 pairings. Police Love Story is best romance every season too.<br><br> They all want to be Shinichi's waifu. <br>Yeah, no. You are clueless retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am at episode 780 atm, and dont regret a bit. Still best show airing every season.<br><br> filler <br>ahh... you are one of "those" fags.</br></br></br></br>   wanted sci-fi or /m/ <br> knights of sidonia season 1 was okay <br> mfw this shit <br>Convince me not to drop season 2 right now</br></br></br>  CG shit, drop it like it's hot.  Because that's cute as fuck dude.   tfw no alien dick monster to cuddle   I can give you two reasons  <br> Izanafags <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  there's a beam emitter in the same episode that makes up for it  <br>If you can't handle a bit of SoL then maybe you should stop watching anime altogether</br>  <br> Convince me not to drop season 2 right now <br>There are actually episodes with some pretty damn awesome fights and action scenes coming up at the end of S2.</br></br>  <br>Because Benisuzume's there  to fuck that stupid tentacle monster shit up later on. </br>  <br>Not liking sidonia no nichijou<br>also rubber tentacle chan best girl</br></br>  <br>It became haremshit</br>  <br>Just read the manga, you Tumblrite, Redditor piece of shit.</br>  <br>The manga is in many ways actually fucking worse.<br><br>Especially about the harem bullshit.<br>Fucking Nihei.</br></br></br></br>  i find amusing that despite living for at least 5 years on sidonia's "surface",Nagte only had females friends..... fucking faggot, that's why he loves that penis monster so much  <br>Does BeniJiro count as a Milf?</br>  <br>why would you consider her as a milf?</br>  <br>Best girl came back and won.</br>  <br>just fucking drop it already and go read muv luv alternative<br>its tentimes more fun than KoS</br></br>  <br>Smoogy.<br>I'm just not sure if the clones are hivemind or not.</br></br>  <br>There's no reason to believe they are.</br>  What I expected: /m/<br>What I got: /d/</br>  <br>Harem shit is worse but the pacing, tech, style, art and so on are far better.</br>    <br> Harem shit is worse <br> <br>It is not. Why are claiming this?</br></br></br>  so should we start sidonia threads on weekends?<br><br>or should we wait until next chapter of manga?</br></br>  <br>Because Teruru.</br>  <br>Whenever you think about Yuhata.</br>  <br>Are you kidding m8. The party house keeps on expanding. They get the tsunbot, best girl polls and the like. The manga is way better but come the fuck on.</br>  <br>i bet Yuhata have mustache but she shave it</br>  <br>I can give you two reasons as well:<br> C <br> G </br></br></br>  <br> Yuhata <br>So close anon.</br></br>  <br>Needs a sombrero.</br>  <br>It's a bit odd to say the manga is worse and then use scenes that haven't even happened in the anime because it didn't get that far into the story.<br><br>So far the anime hasn't really made an effort to avoid or to push the haremshit that was in the currently covered manga chapters into the background.</br></br></br>    I like the setting and general technology (It's basically R-Type The Anime) but it's bogged down by a bunch of harem bullshit with the most generic protag thrown in there.  <br>No. It has exacerbated them. Like as not if they ever got that far (while still sticking to the story, which they don't look like they will be as much now) there would be worse harem shit as OC filler type nonsense as we saw with the date. <br>As the two stand as separate objective works the Manga is better in general but worse for harem shit.</br></br>  <br>The final ep is garbage. It also sold just half of S1. Penis worm has killed Nihei.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out, fag.</br>  <br> Penis worm has killed Nihei <br>Popularity killed Nihei.</br></br>  <br> not liking best girl <br>she's too good for you</br></br>  <br>that shit ain't even human</br>  <br>She's half human.</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>   ever watching this garbage in the first place <br>The only reason I even support the mediocre manga is the hope that Nihei will get enough shekels to go back to working on something that isn't moefag pandering swill.</br>  <br>Cuter than human.</br>  <br>Mushrooms.</br>  <br>The only sexual relationship he'll have will be with the captain.

Enajiro 1 can't really communicate or behave like normal human being.</br></br>  <br> How do I draw better, /a/ ? <br>Actually learn how anatomy works.</br></br>  <br> The final ep is garbage. <br>Is this opposite day or something?</br></br>  <br> having sex with an extra terrestrial parasitoid <br>pass</br></br>  <br>Didn't what's her face say that her biology aside from the tentacles was completely identical to a human's?</br>  Hey /a/, I tried watching the first series last year, but the CG choppines was unbearable. <br>Does it get better with SVP?</br>  <br>Pretty nice Cherubimon fanart.</br>  It gets worse OP, there's a whole episode dedicated to harem antics.  In case the anon who wanted more pics of my Lego garde is here: Here you are. Made a few small changes and, aside from the stand, it can all be made with set 31034.  <br>Nicely done /a/non.</br>  <br> Implying this isn't cute as fuck <br> Implying alien tentacle monster isn't best girl </br></br>  <br>Forgot to add: It's not a very sturdy build, so making a stand for it is a good idea. But with a bit of patience, it can stand up on its own.<br><br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, just noticed that there is a single part in there, the one the stand connects to, which isn't in the set. Isn't necessary for the figure itself, though.</br>  <br>You should fuck off forever with you cg crap</br>  <br>No, you're just from reddit</br>  <br>It's so bad, it's good in its own way.</br>  <br> fights <br>They were turned into shit with anime original resolves</br></br>  <br> Implying you ain't part of the cancer that is violently killing Sidonia. </br>  <br> but worse for harem shit. <br>Ah, so you mean that in the sense that it's worse if that's what you're looking for, true. I thought you meant that harem is more distracting in the manga than in the anime.</br></br>  <br> those manly arms and shoulders <br><br>it looks like a trannie</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing important actually changed in the end fight, they just added more flash to it for the finale. Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai the story could move back to the manga line quite easily.</br>  <br> Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai <br>Did that happen? It got packed into Toha crate and taken away. <br>Nagate probably asked Kunato about the first one during the party.</br></br></br>  <br>Well memed anonymous. Your taste is shit though.</br>  Does anyone have the webm of the bombardment?  <br>Kunato said like he had Benijiro when the crate is clearly THI's.</br>  <br>The crate was just made by THI.</br>  <br>In the manga,  Kunatochiai is denied access to it soon after. </br>  <br> Is the captain going to give it to Tanikaze for their anniversary? </br>  HOLDING YOU TOO IT ANON  <br>Nagate asked him what was going to happen to "Hoshijiro" IIRC, Kunatochiai said something along the lines of always needing a spare. That means he got BeniJiro as well.</br>  <br><br>I didn't look through the thread before I posted that, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>At least until the Capitan revokes his mad science privileges.</br>  They clearly fucked.  <br>we know anon</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>No problem.</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>He could mean  Kanata  as well.</br>  I felt the same OP, But the last 3-4 episodes were fucking great.<br><br>That's what Sidonia should be about Gauze fighting/Benesuzume type shit not the romance garbage, What annoys me more is the amazing setting it is in and hurr we'll just turn it into some sort of space shitty love story.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/ywmvxoujac.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>RIP pomf</br>  <br>But the romance garbage is the integral part of Sidonia story.</br>  is there enough content for a season 3 ?  <br>yes there is anon</br>  <br>EP 5 was the best episode</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>I was hooked to this show because of this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Great taste. For me it's tied with S2 episode 11, though.</br>  <br><br>Although I liked Hoshijiro, it was just about the sustainability of the Tsugumori, and that's not something we see in many other mecha shows</br></br>  <br>It also served to develop their relationship, so her death would affect Nagate more.</br>  <br>Thats also another reason I like that episode, relationship development. Its also why I liked Hoshijiro x Nagate more then Nagate x Izana, more development</br>  <br> 2-3 episodes long relationship <br> still better than all series long one <br>Not funny at all.</br></br></br>  <br>don't get me wrong, I like them both</br>  <br>Their relationship (not in the romantic sense) started in the first episode, so it's 6 episodes.</br>  <br>Honestly, I like them both too.<br>But really, I'm for whatever results in more SPESS battles.</br></br>  <br>This is all I could think of when I hear her.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x47<wbr>NYUbtYb0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That was romance done well for Sidonia IMHO. The pure harem SoL shit not so much.</br>  <br>they essentially just mimicked Rick and Minmei being stuck outside the ship</br>  <br>Be that as it may, it fits the themes and motifs of Sidonia very well while the excessive SoL sticks out and dilutes the story and to make it worse all the haremshit doesn't even develop relationships all that much.</br>  <br>i agree and maybe if i hadn't watched Macross when i was a kid it would have been more special, the harem stuff is getting old but really this show is just a mishmash of Macross/Tenchi etc. still really enjoying it.<br>Second season was more filler sadly.<br>what does Sol mean?</br></br></br>  <br> what does Sol mean? <br>Slice of life</br></br>  <br>It's not even about being special, it's just that it fits very well with the themes and doesn't feel tacked on or excessive. The 908497862 scenes of moe Tsumugi making squeaky balloon sounds don't really bring anything.</br>  <br>  3D <br>  Anime <br>Choose one</br></br></br>  <br>it was awful at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and tbh space scenes are gr8</br>  <br>Nah, I don't think so. Why would he answer Nagate's question with something completely unrelated, especially since Nagate has no idea Kanata even exists in the first place at this point?</br>  what is the significance of the the Captains Mask?   not recognizing that smoogi is the best girl on sidonia <br><br>captain is runner-up</br></br>  <br>because she has cleft lip</br>  <br>She's immortal and has been Captain for a fuck-long time, it's so people don't see her face and notice.</br>   yfw you realise the Placenta   hardens in response to physical trauma   <br>She was cuter without the tits tbh</br>  Okay I just marathoned this and I'm a little disappointed. I actually didn't mind when it turned into a full on SoL/romance in S2. But they didn't even fucking deliver on that? He gets the perfect setup by wing-grandma and he fucking jobs hard. The most we get is him telling best girl that she's important to him. Why can't he pilot his goddamned dick as well as he pilots the Tsugumori?<br><br>The ending was pretty meh and gave off a "yeah there's no S3" kind of vibe. God damnit.</br></br>  <br>Does it really matter as long as the face remains?</br>  <br>Because he was raised underground by a single old dude who only taught him how to kill Gauna and in Izana's case it's compounded by other things:<br> she wasn't a she at all when they met <br> she puts up an image of being tough and not needing help </br></br></br>  <br>How is it even possible to deny that pic related is best Izana?</br>  <br> Used original OP in final episode battle <br>11/10 just for that choice alone.</br></br>  <br><br>this is best Izana</br></br>  <br>That was cool, but it also reminded me how absolutely garbage the 2nd ED was compared to the first.</br>  <br>There are several others that are close, but not that one.</br>  Anyone know where I can download the 100 sites of sidonia that they used in the anime? I can only find the manga versions. Am I gonna have to screencap them myself?    <br>I'm rather partial to this one.</br>  <br>It's more interesting now that  she has thrown the mask away helping injured staffs herself after an MUS ate 1/8 of the ship .</br>  <br>I wonder if Nagate and Izana ended up skinny dipping together.</br>  why hasn't she kissed Tanikaze yet?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised either way.</br>  <br>because she's not dead, immortal or had a penis</br>  <br>Do the BeniJiro count as both dead and immortal?</br>  <br>Nagate is dense and she seems to be either unable or unwilling to act drastically enough.</br>  <br>yes, and she's not human, she's an aberration to nature and should be killed with fire alongside with Tsumugi</br>  <br>Izana, pls.</br>  <br> Izana <br> wishing to harm Tsumugi <br>When she got BTFO by Tsumugi all she could say was that she's happy for her</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she doesn't consider the balloon sausage actual competition?</br>  <br>it's kinda weird the relationship between Izana, Nagate and Tsumugi, for moments they look like a family with Tsumugi as a child and there are some parts in the manga were it seems that there is something about to happen between Izana and Nagate but it just stays there</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's not true.<br> we were rejected </br></br>  <br>I saw that too, the curse of haremshit.<br><br>Well, they still have the "not an alien tentacle that's technically the daughter of his first love interest" thing going for them.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw nothing to cuddle at all </br>  this scene remind me this <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=45b<wbr>UOIK2cAo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Is there any ep12 director's cut not on Netflix out there?  <br>what would be different?</br>  So, what's the consensus on the fates of the other seed ships?  <br><br>we all know who really wins</br></br>  <br>The aliums?</br>  <br>She never really wins since the Bowl she was in had been done and she wasn't the winner and never will be.</br>  so what attacked norio and his assistant in the first episode of season 2?  <br>Borg implants made of aliens.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Toxine was cactus?</br>  <br>i swear i saw a 6" person with a sword</br>  <br>She cut off Mozuku's fingers because Mozuku was trying to touch Ochiai's cactus.<br><br>She's very fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, I thought the cacti just had hyperdimensional razor spines or something.</br>  <br>little dude</br>  <br> rubber tentacle chan best girl <br><br>I know, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Um, where is Tsumugi's base attached there?</br>  Where the fuck can I download 12 ep director's cut?  <br>Most became gauna food, very few might be successful like Sidonia. Depends on whether they found their own space cheese or other ways to deal with gauna.</br>  Monstergirl fag here. You faggots are all weird.  Picked up btw   <br> You faggots are all weird <br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br> cancer <br>It's not cancer, it's just placenta.</br></br>  <br> placenta <br>It's not placenta, it's your waifu.</br></br>  <br> MANY DAYS <br> A <br> N <br> Y <br> . <br> D <br> A <br> Y <br> S </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's to say that gauna were even present in any direction other than the one Sidonia was/is travelling? <br><br>It's entirely possible that all of the other ships landed somewhere a long time ago and have established massive civilizations.</br></br></br>  <br> retarded accelerator <br> a bunch of Hayakaze saving the day out of ass <br>Yeah, right.</br></br></br>  <br>Your guess is as good as any but it's unlikely gauna didn't expand. They found Earh after all and they are attracted to hyggs which is primary power source of human civilization.</br>  <br>Shit eater</br>  <br> Convince me not to drop season 2 right now <br><br>season 2, and the rest of the manga, is better than the first season's material becuase it's more focused on the characters and less focused on space explosions<br><br>...but that's a pattern that's present in even the most hard core /m/ shit. 08th MS team, the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot, STILL HAS ONE. Every macross show is 80% romantic subplot, 10% space lasers, and 10% nyan. <br><br>the entire mecha genre is an excuse to give faggots who like mushy subplots an excuse to watch them. and there's nothing wrong with that. as a self proclaimed giant faggot, I watch mecha shows for that exact reason. hell i watch mushy shit like yahari as well. also pic related. eva is like 80% mushy subplot and whining, 10% mecha battles, and 10% blatant fanservice.<br><br>stop lying to yourself, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> season 2, and the rest of the manga, is better than the first season's material becuase it's more focused on the characters <br>But what if the characters are shit?</br></br>  <br> worse. <br> harem bullshit <br><br>surely you meant, "way better thanks to the harem bullshit", right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But S1 was your generic /m/ anime.<br> Boy gets immediately thrown into mecha <br> Rival who hates MC for extremely petty reasons <br> Someone important to him dies <br><br>Meanwhile in S2:<br> New bad guy is a pretty decent guy overall <br> Fun with tsumugi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You either get better taste or find something you like instead of whining about something you don't like.</br>  <br> Boy gets immediately thrown into mecha <br> clone of BEST PILOT EVER trained from birth to pilot said mecha by BEST PILOT EVER <br>Guess that doesn't sound as negative as you'd hope for without leaving the important stuff out.<br><br> New bad guy is a pretty decent guy overall <br> generic mad scientist hell bent on screwing over everyone and becoming godlike being <br><br>I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 08th MS team, the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot <br><br>opinion discarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yahari is not mushy.</br>  <br>But Nihei sucks at characterization. He is only good at creating an atmosphere, the settings and the battles. So saying that S2 is focused on the characters is not a good thing in this case.</br>  <br>Same as usual.</br>  <br> 08th MS team <br> the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot </br></br>  <br>Izana was pretty great in that arc.</br>  <br>Don't tell the Tsumugifags, they start shitposting when confronted.</br>  <br>When will manlets learn</br>  what was he looking at?  <br>What breakdown would you give Patlabor?</br>  <br>Somewhat covered plumbing.</br>  <br>not that guy, but patlabor is a story about how in the future,  even autistic people can become law enforcement </br>  <br>Punchline.</br>  <br>Come on, Ota isn't that bad. I assume you are meaning Ota.</br>  <br>Izana is always great, but Tsumugifags and Hoshifags at the same time is a formidable foe</br>  <br>I wonder if she was disappointed he didn't move on that. He's literally the son goku of macross gundam, completely oblivious to his dick.</br>  <br>izumi.<br><br><br>also</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally </br>  <br>I do not see the relevance of Noa's surname in this discussion about autism.</br>  <br> I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't. <br>Top achiever from a wealthy family which runs research and manufacturing of high tech goods. Captain probably didn't give a fuck as long as she got results because she needed power against LMUS.<br>Anime also made it easier to swallow because they changed events like Numi keeping pet gauna secret just because.</br></br></br>  <br> I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't <br>A caveman became their savior out of nowhere. They stopped asking questions at this point as long as shit was getting done.</br></br>  <br>did izana even have genitals at that point?</br>   i suddenly feel like synthesizing <br> he falls asleep <br><br>THAT'S TWO GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES MISSED, THIS FUCKING GUY.</br></br></br>  Animeonlyfags are truly the worst cancer.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TBf<wbr>WKmRFTjM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> synthesizing <br>Heh.<br>Also it's Nagate we're talking about. Even if Samari managed to drag him into photosynthesis chamber you can be sure as hell he'd get bruised and kicked K.O. by no less than 3 various Honokas.</br></br></br>    Did the Nihei mention anything about how long this manga is going to be?  <br>While it's popular. Now it's not, so he is finishing it.</br>  <br><br> blamefags defends this bullshit </br></br>  <br/>  <br>Mangafags has their fair amount of retards as well, the ones that doesn't even read and comes up with their own shitty headcanon with pictures they take out of context.</br>  <br> the ones that doesn't even read <br> Mangafags <br>That's some funny definition.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was her sister placenta clone thing that had the kid. She's a christmas cake.</br></br>  <br>I guess that explains why the endings to his mangas are completely wtf.</br>  <br>Those were just flash for the season (or anime for that matter) finale. They don't actually change anything. Nagate and Tsumugi still get back to Sidonia just fine in the manga without the flashy end battle.</br>  <br> the ones that doesn't even read <br> and comes up with their own shitty headcanon with pictures they take out of context <br>That's a tetriary, dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on if the other ships use Higgs bosons and the magic cheese rice probably.<br>The Sidonia might be baiting them away from the others for all we know.</br></br>  <br> Higgs bosons <br>It's Heigus particles</br></br>  <br>Everything is possible since we have no idea in the end, but I doubt they'd be very different. Kobayashi (?) I believe mentions that even a stationary colony would have trouble surviving long-term without Higgs-powered things. There's also the fact that Gauna started attacking when humanity started using Higgs and at that time fucking nobody knew that it was actually drawing them in, there would be little reason to not equip seed ships with the top-tier tech at the time.</br>  <br>That works on the assumption all the nations had the same tech level, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every theoretical sub light speed interstellar travel technology was used.</br>  Is it strange that I can totally get off to just this one image?  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Izana has been great since she took the pilot role; fighting 1-on-1 with Benisuzume only with a shield and survive in manga, and carrying unconscious Nagate's Tsugumori and herself out of a certain fatal crash in anime.</br>  <br>I find it somewhat implausible that at least the major nations/powers didn't cooperate and share tech when the very survival of the human race was at stake. There are quite a few examples in history of various civilizations that were more or less divided internally band together to fight large external threats, this should have applied to giant space tentacle monsters coming to consume humanity itself.<br><br>I'm not saying everyone turned into altruists to help the poorest of African states build seed ships, but it would have been stupid as fuck not to cooperate with other nations building their own seedships.</br></br></br>  <br>I kind of forgot, were they near a star or something when this happened? If not where was enough light for photosynthesis coming from?<br> Or did she "photosynthesize" to give Nagate a hint before what seemed like certain death? </br></br>  <br>Just saying, the Norks' strategically painted trashcan ship powered by nuclear explosions may get farther than the others. If it can leave the atmosphere.</br>  <br>When the Captain orgasmed (SUBARASHII) after watching the Graviton Beam Emitter blow a hole through a planet, it became obvious she was no longer (and perhaps never was) thinking rationally.<br>Examples:<br> we gun kill gauna hive MANY DA... i mean many times the size of sidonia <br> make me another electro-rave-laser-penis, but don't fuck it up like last time <br> bridge bunny: "captain, we should save izana, nagate and smoogy's best friend." <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whatever, the particle is called, its made up. They're not higgs bossons. Whether they should translate it as Hyggs or Heigus is semantics.</br></br>  <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." <br>That's pretty rational thought.<br><br>Jokes aside, what's the deal with the captain? Especially in the mango where he rapes dense pilots. Is she projecting Nagate's grandfather onto him or what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean there are people who don't think the Capitan is an Ork Warboss trapped in a practically immortal Nip body?</br>  <br> Ork Warboss <br> Electro-ray of doom <br> gauna-killer rifle spawn <br> ALL THE DAKKA <br>...it somehow makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love me some Stoner-chan.</br></br>  <br>I'd put some gravity vectoring in her, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Not to mention how she wants to get da Boys in a good tussle with the Gauna cluster.</br>  <br>The Immortal Council mentioned something about "gravity dementia". They probably weren't just making things up.</br>  <br> rapes <br>Yeah, Nagate was totally traumatized after using the captain's entrance for MANY DAYS.<br><br>On a more serious note, I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia, namely to be able to live in peace without constant Gauna threat. Since so far the only contact with Gauna has been conflict, the only logical way to pursue this is to:<br> 1. Eliminate the current, immediate threat <br> 2. Have the capability to adequately defend Sidonia and any colonies against future LMUS attack </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chill man, it was consensual rape.</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit, this is why no aliens has come to this fucking earth</br>  <br>The Immortal Council also mentioned that it would have been easy to avoid Gauna space, but the Captain went there on purpose.</br>  <br>What are you implying, that they are shy and have height issues?<br><br> Because that's my fetish. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, fuck the metric system.</br>  slutty kobayashi is best kobayashi  <br>Foxy grandma best girl.</br>   dad walks in <br> looks at the big pink penis on the screen <br> looks at me <br> -I-it's ok anon, I respect gays.  <br> -It's not like that, dad... it actually is a cute girl.... </br></br></br></br>  <br>aliens are just too proud of thier size, and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them</br>  Everyone has the same face in the manga.  <br>That's what you get for being a Tsumugifag.</br>  <br>If your dad still has any faith in you, you're doing something wrong.</br>  <br>is this a new facepalm</br>  <br>why are the last 2 letters backwards?</br>  <br>Yure is a good but Izana is the best</br>  <br>mean to</br>  <br>Running forever without a weapon that can dispatch Gauna while keeping Sidonia and its inhabitants safe isn't really the best long-term option. What Kobayashi did is risky as fuck for sure, but if it works it will mean that for the first time in over 1000 years (?) humanity, as far as we know, humanity will have less to fear from the Gauna and may have a chance to establish a proper presence on a nice world.</br>  I fucking hate the manga for this. It was really good for the first half, but now it's just turned into haremshit.<br><br>FUCK YOU NIHEI</br></br>  <br>Because an alien clone with only a basic understanding of Japanese is trying to write in English?<br><br>Speak for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>yea, S2 sucked compared to S1.</br>  How do sweaty Izana's armpits smell like?  <br>Like sweaty Izana.</br>    <br> and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them <br>They are wrong.</br></br>   yfw Sidonia S3 in 2018   <br>Well, I want to watch The Fifth Element now.</br>  <br> I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia <br>No one is questioning that, even Ochiai wanted that before he clashed with the captain.<br>However it's the ways and paths they want to take that is the problem. They are both doing horrible stuff and refuses to give up control because of the risk of them not ending out on top.<br><br>So far I have seen four camps.<br><br>Ochiai wants to evolve humanity, with him in lead.<br>Kobayashi wants to humans to be safe and keep tradition, with her in the lead.<br>Saitou wanted to trust the next generation.<br>Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager. <br>She's dead/an alien now.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, she got her wish.</br>  <br>I read the manga for a long time but eventually it just got too out there, like there was no actual goal in mind for the plot and they were just winging it.<br><br>If you don't like at this point you aren't going to like it going further in.</br></br></br>  <br>So what? She's trying to take Tanikaze with her?</br>  <br>At the time the Captain made the decision to cruise through Gauna space instead of going around, she had untested combatants and the only effective weapons were spears.<br>Perhaps she anticipated the development of the artificial Kabi-core bullets, but they were force to fight several Gauna before that, one of which was so close to catching them that she had to fuck up the ship in a high-g turn.</br></br>  <br>More of: She wanted understanding so much she ended up getting eaten.</br>  <br>It's getting really hard not to think of this show as AoT in space.</br>  <br>I never read the manga before watching the first season. My heart was genuinely shattered when they killed her.</br>  <br>There may be less opportunity for haremshit with the recent developments in the manga.<br><br><br>I don't think comparing any of the other 3 to Ochiai is fair. Ochiai started out by wanting to evolve humanity, but in the end his goal changed to simply evolving by himself by any means necessary and now is looking to actively destroy Sidonia. From what was a questionable course of action in the first place he went only downhill.<br><br>Kobayashi takes risks but the fundamental fact that she cares about Sidonia and its people doesn't change. She is very well aware she did some fucked up shit and her recent character development suggests she's trying to change and improve (coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is, ditching the mask, hands-on helping people and Lala's statement about her being gentler).<br><br>Hiroki and Hoshijiro don't even belong in the same category with Kobayashi in terms of what they're willing to do, much less so with Ochiai.<br><br><br>She's definitely willing to take risks and is well aware that people will die, but there's no way it wouldn't have happened eventually, what with Gauna being more powerful and faster anyway.<br><br>Escaping may have been potentially viable if they found another power source and ditched everything Kabi, but nobody knew that back then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hasn't Sidonia been a thing before AoT though?</br>  <br>Fuck if I remember, it all sort of blurs together.</br>  <br>Please don't associate AoT with Sidonia. It's sickening enough to hear this all the time in youtube comments or other places.<br><br><br>Same year, I believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to associate the two, but it's hard not to.</br>  <br><br>Well I looked it up, Sidonia started in April and AoT in September 2009. So I guess AoT is Sidonia in the middle-ish ages  and worse. </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Isayama Hajime stated that he was inspired by Knights of Sidonia to make Attack on Titan. That's why this tweet is so funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>AoT really took off after the anime adaption. I guess Nihei's art is just far more unappealing, even if compared to Isayama's earliest stuff. <br><br>I guess AoT is just more engaging to read, but I appreciate Nihei's art more.</br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager <br>I wouldn't call her naive for that. Not like she strongly believed or convinced that the gauna wanted to be friends. If anything, I'd call it a sign that she was more of a free thinker than most residents of Sidonia, as she wasn't as held back by the dogmatic hatred for Gauna that most have. Gauna don't seem to have any inherent intelligence, so hating them is like hating nature for natural disasters: Pointless.<br><br><br>Same here. Probably the main reason I immediately read through the manga was because I wanted to know what would happen with the placenta clones. The topic being untouched for over 30 chapters made me very sad.  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Responding to an admitted Yukinoshitter </br>  <br>It is fair.<br><br>Both Kobayashi and Ochia wanted was was best for humanity, they didn't see eye to eye on how they would achieve it and this is what made them clash.<br><br>Kobayashi wants to be in charge of Sidonia, she does not want anyone else to take over because she doesn't trust the next generation. Saitou wants to put faith in next generation, Kobayashi doesn't. This is where her and Saitou clashed.<br><br> coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is <br>She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off gauna apologist, they hunt and hurt humans for centuries even destroyed their home planet and expect them to not hate you?</br>  <br>I dunno, they seemed to figure out psyops pretty fast. None of the people who got eaten really screamed "I am a master of psychology"</br>  I'm having trouble convincing myself to finish S1. The characters are all bad, the action and mecha aren't very impressive, and the storytelling is kinda weird. <br><br>Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br><br>Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find.<br><br>Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br><br>A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br><br>MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br><br>Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC.<br><br>The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for. <br><br>There are other things that bothered me too that I can't recall off the top of my head. I guess none of them are completely story breaking, but overall the plot feels somewhat sloppily constructed and without the support of any interesting characters or relationships I feel like there's not much point in continuing. The best parts are the OP, Sidonia's design, and the cool portraits/sketches that are shown halfway through each episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Many people have had their homes destroyed by tsunamis, but there's still no point in "hating nature". I don't sympathize with the gauna, but I see no reason to hate them, either.<br><br><br>That's likely just them using the brain they've absorbed. That's why I said "inherent intelligence". They probably just use what works, supported by information gained from things they've absorbed.<br><br>Of course, when it comes to Benisuzume, for instance, we can begin to talk about intent, at least to some degree.<br><br>But who knows, they're still mostly a mystery, after all.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a shitty excuse, Nature is nature. Gauna is extraterrestrial life.</br>  <br>Brings up the question why they keep using BeniJiros when it's clear they've lost a lot of their impact.</br>  <br>at least there is a chance for S3 anon... we can only wait</br>  <br>Life is a part of nature. I wouldn't hate a lion for eating a person. Sure, it sucks, but it's not like the lion did it out of malevolent intent.<br><br><br>Why the gauna still use BeniJiro? Probably because she seems to be an efficient fighter. Sure, the scare-tactic doesn't work anymore (whether it was intentional or not), but she's still far more effective than the average gauna. I imagine it's a lot like natural selection. What works is used and what doesn't work is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're leaving out the little part where Ochiai is attacking Sidonia and/or its fleet with a GBE and him leaving that objective behind a long time ago and instead adopting the goal for himself alone.<br><br> She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth. <br>Maybe, but that's pure speculation at this point as there isn't anything in those few pages to actually suggest it. I'd go as far as to say that lying at that point doesn't fit with her behavior afterwards or with Lala's perception of her in the latest chapter. She could have lied, of course, but the fact is that we don't know at this point.<br><br>I don't see why she would though. Nagate wasn't rebelling before, he's loyal to her and to Sidonia. What's the purpose of going through the whole thing and lying?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's new?</br>  <br> keep using <br>They don't really. There were 3 of them, right? 2 got killed off quickly while Benisuzume survived. Then Benisuzume got nearly killed, regenerated and then attacked again and got killed for good.<br><br>The Gauna only made Hoshijiro clones at one point, one of them was just hard to kill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if we get a third season i'd like to see the part when gaunas replicate one of the Honokas</br>  <br>Yeah that would definitely be interesting</br>  <br> Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br>Their part in that mission was secondary. Kunato believed he could make Tanikaze look bad while not severely endangering the primary mission, which he was correct. Tanikaze drops it because he's an altruist, which he demonstrates time and time again.<br><br> Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find. <br>The Kunato family is in charge of keeping Ochiai's sealed lab and his secondary brain. Being a rich family, they have an extensive library with historical information, including that of Ochiai and his research.<br><br> Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br>When Tanikaze is allowed to view the dead chimera with Yure and the Captain, they explain the body produces an artificial Kabi. When they later introduce the man-made Kabi-core bullets, it's obvious to the viewer where they obtained the material.<br><br> A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br>Repeatedly explained that the Gauna core is impervious to all damage, except for the Kabi. There's not scientific reasoning to it, but it's established as being part of the physics of this universe.<br><br> MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br>There are a few more males, but this is a typical harem setup. It's not as bad as some other anime.<br><br> Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC. <br>My wife thinks this is a legitimate complaint. Izana, though technically genderless at the beginning of the story, acts in most every way like a female. Her attraction to Nagate is immediate and apparent. Her transition to female later in the story is mostly to create tension between her and Nagate.<br><br> pic <br>What the fuck. Seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for.  <br>People believe stupid shit for no reason, or for very arbitrary reasons not backed up by evidence.<br><br>My suggestion: if you think the characters are bad, the action and mecha aren't impressive, and the storytelling is weird then you should stop watching it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's you again.<br><br>First off I'm not leaving out anything their first clash started way earlier than him attacking them with a GBE, read the bonus manga that came with the BD.<br><br>Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? It's not a lie, you are just withholding information in your favor, which she is clearly doing.<br><br>It's more in favor that she never told him about why Saitou got fed up in the first place and just simply left that out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You try to spout the rule of nature and you do not understand them either.</br>  <br> you again. <br>What?<br><br> Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? <br>Where exactly are you getting this from? Please, tell me the chapter and the page where I can see Kobayashi omit essential details. All we got were like 3 pages, it basically skipped over all the discussion that happened.<br><br>You can interpret it however you wish, but there's still 0 actual evidence either one way or the other in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean the guard copies, the Clones.</br>  <br> Rules of nature ?</br>  Yes hello does the girl have sex with the penis monster?<br><br>Is it shown in the anime?<br><br>If both answers are yes, I am picking this up.<br>Thank you very much /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit, or the Gauna is simply regenerating everything that was part of its original placenta as a matter of course.</br>  <br>That game actually explained the rules of nature.</br>  <br>Could be, just a sort of large flight risk when they don't disintegrate with the cores. Smoogy's mom really boosted Sidonia's ability to effectively counter attack.</br>  <br>I'm simply pointing out that it's pointless to hate something that doesn't act with any intent, or at least any malevolent intent, which seems to be the case with the gauna until they actually begin using the brains of absorbed people. Until then, they simply followed the kabi or hyggs particles.<br><br><br><br> Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit <br>I thought this was obvious. They get the ability of tactical thinking. The gauna itself probably don't use it with that intent, but it's effective, and thus it keeps getting used.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where exactly are you getting this from?  <br>From the whole part where Lala committed "treason" Saitou stole a clonebaby and cut down some guards<br><br>Even Lala have not told Nagate about this. No one has.</br></br></br></br>  <br> when they don't disintegrate with the cores <br>They do though, it's just that placenta doesn't foam if it's been physically cut from the true body.</br></br>  <br>It does act with intent if it's way of "communicating" with you is harming you Captain Hindsight.</br>  <br>Wasn't the BeniJiro that was invading Tanikaze's cockpit still attached to the core though?</br>  <br>That not enough? How about the part where she weaseled out of giving him information about Saitou.</br>  <br>Again, there is no point in the manga where we can actually see if Kobayashi told him about that or kept it hidden. We know they had a conversation where Kobayashi told him some shit about the past, but we don't know what she told him exactly. Maybe she lied, maybe she kept things hidden, maybe she told the truth, but we don't KNOW and those 3 pages don't really suggest anything one way or the other.<br><br><br>No, Izana separated it just before Nagate foamed Benisuzume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2/2<br><br>Oh look at that, she is lying to him.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, don't remember that bit.<br>Wonder if they'll invent a weapon that's essentially a Gauna peeler.</br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br><br>How exactly is shit from chapter 8 relevant to a discussion that happens in 60-something? Yeah no fucking shit she didn't tell him anything at the beginning of the manga.<br><br><br>They can peel placenta off just fine with Higgs cannons in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, because vaporized Placenta is so useful for weapons development and easy to collect.</br>  <br> moving goalposts this hard. <br>It matters a lot because it shows us how she has been manipulating him into working from him from the start. What the fuck did you think the "I need to treat this situation different" meant? Did you start reading after 63 thinking that was a good place to start?</br></br>  <br>You clearly have no idea what I'm talking about or you forgot how our discussion started, so I'm going to bow out now.</br>   [CBM] Knights of Sidonia 1-12 (Dual Audio) [BDRip 720p 8bit] <br><br>is this the one to get?</br></br>  <br>And you have no idea how much established character backgrounds does for situations. Are you really so naive that a 700 year old woman magically changes because of Nagate? No she is playing him like a fool as she has been since the start and does everything she can to avoid doing the same mistakes she made with Saitou.<br><br>She never told him about Saitou because Nagate trusts him more than her. She denies him information because she wants to be in control of the situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, she doesn't exactly seem like the most mentally stable person.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out, normie. Rrreeeeerrre</br>  <br>Most of us ITT probably watched it as it was airing.</br>  <br>Absolute power corrupts, this is the same person that ordered the previous immortal council to be assassinated so she could keep staying in power.</br>  <br>Dem gitz was threatenin' the Waarg!<br>Seriously though, the council was just as if not more questionable in their actions.</br></br>  <br>They all are, the idea of an immortal council only works on short terms due to the need of preserving knowledge, problem is it should just be that and you could do that in other ways then to resort to immortality. Long terms it's leads to stagnation and only ends up in a power struggle in who should be in charge.<br><br>Great men knows when to step down.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, makes me wonder in the Capitan will ignite her own mutiny before the wild ride ends.</br>  <br>A virus doesn't act with intent. It just does was it does, which might result in the death of other organisms. There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. It's just acting out its biological programming.</br>  <br> implying you can't be long-lived while doing what's best in the very long-term </br>  <br>How is that gay? Are you in elementary school?</br>  <br> There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. <br><br>Then give up your life whenever you happened to come across hardship. <br>Rules of nature does not mean that you should bend over to the aggressor because it is stronger or in it's nature. It means anything goes, even defending yourself, grit your teeth. There is a reason why lions attack the weak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the Gauna are actually attempting to communicate then you can't compare them to a virus. You can't even apply the concept of communication to a virus.</br>  <br>It will probably be Tsumugi that does it just because.<br><br>Thing is, Kobayashi is currently a great wartime leader. She is making good calls actually leading Sidonia.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying virus-chan doesn't try to communicate by hugging </br></br>  <br>my URL</br>  Blame! needs an anime  <br>Well, Smoogy did go full RIP AND TEAR before.</br>  <br><br>It needs a dungeon crawler game.</br></br>  <br>Only against Gauna though</br>    <br>NaissanceE's environments looked very similar to Blame!</br>  <br>Just wait, they'll try some kind of combat drug on her to increase performance. Or something equally stupid.</br>  <br>That would be retarded as fuck, but then again nobody noticed Ochiai being up and about and making himself a chimera body to rek Sidonia with, so who fucking knows.</br>  <br>All it would take is Smoogy needing to fight injured or something.</br>  <br>Yeah but that this point with all the new Guardian models and ships and GBEs and shit Smoogy isn't even that big of a deal anymore, would still be plenty retarded. Not to say that it's impossible, Kobayashi like to roll the dice every once in a while and hope she comes out on top.</br>  <br>So, her eventually rolling a one is basically a certainty.</br>  <br>Getting Gauna to suck on Sidonia has to count as that happening</br>  <br>You mean the giant laser penis?<br>That was definitely a two, could have easily completely destroyed Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>I am not saying not to resist. I don't mind the gauna being killed. Nothing wrong with killing a lion in self-defense or trying to get rid of a virus entirely. But I'd say it's better to look objectively at what they are and considering different possibilities instead of dogmatically hating them.<br><br><br>Yeah, but they probably aren't trying to communicate, which is why I'm comparing them to a virus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean from the anime? No, I mean pic related.</br>  <br>the part when Gaunas replicate what earth would look like and parts of sidonia using Shou's memories and even replicating Shou itself , shows some interest of interest of understand humanity.<br>i don't think that gaunas copy everything without a reason, that would be pointless.</br></br>  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br> that would be pointless <br>In the end, life is pointless. Cells self-replicate, but there is no inherent reason to this. It's just it's inherent programming. If that programming helps them survive, they'll keep it. But who knows, the gauna might have evolved some form of intelligence.</br></br>  <br> You mean the giant laser penis? <br>you anime only?</br></br>  <br>Whether it show interest in understanding humanity or not I don't know, but what's very interesting about that scene is that the Gauna have replicated something that they didn't physically consume. Replicate Guardians, replicate humans, sure. But they actually consumed those. This time though they replicated memories of a place that no longer exists, so it means at the very least that they were able to interpret human memories to a degree. That's pretty damn fascinating and not something we've seen Gauna do before IIRC.</br>  <br>Ah.<br><br>Yeah, the style of the space stuff reminded me of R-Type. The manga is much less pleasing to my eyeballs.</br></br></br>  How much do I need to pay Nihei for him to revive Hoshijiro?  <br>I'd wait and see what happens to all the BeniJiros before I started throwing money.</br>  <br>But you are giving them an excuse to continue trample over you, and that frankly is a sign of weakness. They are the aggressors and still are to this day, it's not a complicated philosophical thing. It's kill or literary cease to exist.<br><br>Also you are hind sighting a lot witch serves to muddle your perception of the whole ordeal.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly was she trying to do? Does she get killed off later or turned into some kind of weapon?</br>  <br>I would use the Captain's entrance.</br>  <br> What exactly was she trying to do? <br>Strangle Nagate while connected to Benisuzume, after that it fell unconscious. BeniJiro is then put in a box at Toha (in the manga) and absolutely nothing else happens.</br></br>  <br>I've got no fucking clue, I think someone said strangle him? But that was a very disappointed look she gave when she got cut off. I'd guess she was trying to eat him.</br>  <br>Sexual assimilation.</br>  <br>Hot mecha on alien action.</br>  <br>My main complaints with the show are the comedy and harem elements. The comedy usually has bad timing and is often too over the top for a show with such a solemn atmosphere. The harem aspects are also awkward and clumsy in the way they are implemented. Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them.</br>  <br>I am also pissed at how much this season fucked up Kunato. First season had a great arc for his character and I was eagerly anticipating this season to be his redemption arc and Tanikaze to finally gain a male friend (or at least a friendly rival). Instead his character is assassinated for a mind control plot that seems to stall out half way through.</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br>Yeah I think maybe she was trying to turn him into a guardian</br>  <br> Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them. <br>This is the main problem I think as well. Nihei just rams the haremshit in there and it doesn't really fit most of the time. For instance I think  was very much in tone and if the romance were always done like that it wouldn't bother me.</br></br>  <br>the manga has some moments when harem shit and comedy could be natural and spontaneous but when those times comes, nothing happens</br>  <br>I could see that, it would be beneficial to the Gauna and the Hoshijiro part of BeniJiro I guess.</br>  <br>Beneficial? He could probably solo sidonia entire forces if he got transformed into a guardian.</br>  <br>Chance? The director fucking said it himself that they were going to be animating more Sidonia.</br>  <br>You realize this shit is absolutely impossible to make right?</br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Twitter post. Check the archives for pic, I don't have it on me.</br>  Ok, I've seen these threads going around for a while but all the screenshots I've seen of the show look like fucking shit. Is it actually worth it? I mean, should I watch this garbage looking piece of shit?  <br>The space shit is fucking top tier.<br>Closest we'll ever get to an R-Type animu.<br>The rest is meh, and I only say that because I've seen worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll try nevertheless. :^)</br>  <br>I'm not saying anything about resisting less. The only point I'm making is that it's better to be critical of dogma than to just say "gauna are evil".</br>  <br>KoS mod for Homeworld 2 when?</br>  <br>Huh. I take that back, there might be a way to make a Killy walking simulator. Would need some sort of randomness integrated into the game so buildings would be generated naturally. There is a game called No Man's Sky coming out soon that implements this function in its game. Maybe you should check it out.</br>  <br>That's actually a neat idea, shame the modding scene for it is so dead despite neat tools and samples provided by Gearbox.<br><br><br>I have procedural elements in it, yes. Going fully procedural is hard and usually ends up ugly, so I'm going for a mix where handcrafted pieces are assembled into infinite structures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a developer blog so I can follow your progress?</br>    <br> 08th MS team <br> LEAST romantic subplot </br></br>  <br>Damn.<br> You will never bring Sidonia to bear </br></br>  <br>bac9.tumblr.com<br><br>Mostly it's posts from 2014, I just got back to working on it recently (haven't touched that stuff for half a year, lots of crunch time at my main job left no free time). Right now the work is mostly about creating systems that will help me work on the world, figuring out the fastest workflows possible, writing shaders and editor tools and so on, not about gameplay or fancy visual polish, though, - so there are very few fancy gifs or presentable screenshots.<br><br>One with the towers is a quick test of the modular system I've described in the last post on that blog, not an environment I really labored on for more than few minutes or actually want to keep, for example. I'm capable of creating a very nice and detailed environments with traditional environment art techniques, but that would be wasted work. Specifically, I don't want to create one nice room per month, - I want to create a system that will generate thousands of nice rooms out of thousands of nice pieces which can still be authored within a month.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll need some of that immortality committee juice to manage both that and a Blame! game in my lifetime :^)</br>  <br>think for yourself</br>  Anyway, gotta go. Please ping me on tumblr if a Blame thread pops up again and someone will want to ask something - I try to keep up, but I usually see them two days late and archived.  <br>You're a motherfucking genius.</br>  <br>But that dogma didn't magically come from nothing. It came from Gauna killing and pursuing humans through space and literary destroying earth. The gauna established themselves as being evil by being the aggressors.<br><br>You can be critical all want to make yourself feel smart for "daring" to questioning the dogma, but you are a dumb-ass if you can't take the step forward and put 1+1 together to figure out gaunas are no good with the overwhelming evidence that supports it.<br><br>The road o hell is paved with good intentions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We clearly think very differently about this topic, so I'll just leave it here.</br>  <br>Let me put it as simple as possible so you can understand me more.<br><br>Sidonia is presumably the last bastion of humanity. Gauna want you and not only your family but even the whole human race dead for reasons you don't know.<br>Questioning if they happen to be evil at this point is the same as not doing anything at all which essentially is the same as not defending yourself.<br><br>When two forces fight all concepts of "everything is a shade of gray" vanishes. It's kill or be kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's the mindset you want to adopt, fine with me. I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. I can understand why most people would still hate them, and I can understand why Kobayashi makes use of it. <br><br>I originally really only wanted to say that I wouldn't call Hoshijiro naive for entertaining the idea that the gauna might be trying to communicate.</br></br></br>  <br>It's naive because she is seeing upfront how the gaunas form of communication is viciously murdering your comrades.<br><br> I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. <br>How many times do I have to say this, It's not the perceived intelligence that made Gauna evil. It was their actions against humanity that earned them right of being called evil.<br><br>Actions anon, the very thing that sets everything in motions. Not ideas or thoughts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The scale of the Gauna's destruction is beyond biblical. They have literally destroyed humanity's homeworld, cast them amongst the stars, and continue to relentlessly pursue them. After thousands of years, they pretty much are a sort of hellish religious entity to the people of Sidonia. Of course, we have seen that not everyone on Sidonia sees this way as there were quite a few chapters dedicated to the pacifists.</br>  <br>And they got BTFO</br>  <br>If you want to call it evil, fine. It's a matter of perspective and opinion, I suppose. Besides I'm too tired to keep this discussion going, so I'm going to excuse myself.</br>  When did we go from arguing who's best space tentacle to philosophy and shit?  <br>Fuck off newfag, this is how the threads where before chapter 63.</br>  <br>Arguments over subjective topics that won't go anywhere? Oh right, 4chan. /co/ has really brought my tolerance for this shit way down.</br>  <br>Slow manga with weird "recent" developments that incite waifufag bickering.

I thought the project was dead when you didn't update the blog for like a year.</br>  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>Please, point to the impurity.</br>   5.6k <br>Welp. Tsumugi has officially killed Sidonia.</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>http://dvdbd.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/シドニア<wbr>の騎士</wbr></br>  <br>doesnt matter if it sells badly, Netflix wont let it die since the show is actually successful there.</br>  <br> streaming <br> making money <br>Polygon will enjoy those 5 cents.</br></br></br>  <br>no one?<br><br>And director's cut fuking when???</br></br></br>  <br>They will pay them to produce it. It would be spare money for Netflix, considering is 3Dshit.</br>  So there wont be more anime? The S2 finale was clearly set up as a series finale.  I'm late to the thread but Nihei is a fucking hack who is only good at drawing background porn<br><br>He's a shit mangaka, all of his manga are complete fucking garbage. Blame! is only liked by 12 year olds who still read JoJo and Berserk because they are in their pre-teen angst phase</br></br>  <br>They are not producing it.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>No S3.</br>  <br>My point was mostly about all the insecure and degenerate comments that pop up as soon as she is mentioned in good light.</br>  <br>I am willing to agree with you depending how Sidonia ends.</br>  Should I get the Tsugumori fig or the model kit?<br>There's a prepainted model kit I can find.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I just want to point out that something doesn't have to be "evil" in order for it to require killing &amp; purging such as the Gauna.<br><br>I don't think you can call Gauna evil if they lack the capacity to understand what it is they are doing to humanity and how great the harm they caused and are continuing to cause is. That is however, beside the point. The Gauna need to die, they absolutely do. Whether they are "evil" or not does not matter, they need to die for humanity to live. Whether they have a motivation at all, or what that motivation may be does not matter as long as the only thing they do is murder and destroy. As long as that doesn't change, Gauna need to die.</br></br></br>  <br>Just look inside your pants</br>  <br> Tsugumori  <br><br>Not Tsumugi.</br></br></br>  <br>How are the Manga sales doing though?</br>  So anon, is this worth a read?<br>Apparently its not done, is it nearing completion?</br>  its good, don't expect it to finish or have a good ending  <br>It's hiatus time</br>  USE FUCKING GOOGLE.  <br>Is very good, too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. Still, is good enough for you to look past that. <br><br>Ending will be good if you like Mushashi and dislike Koshiro.<br><br>Must give the mangaka a pat on his back for not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga, jesus was the shit pretentious as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an adaptation of a novel that was pretty good, and the art is great, so yes, it is worth a read.</br>  <br> pretentious <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>That word gets misused time and time again.</br>  <br>That pic is so small, we can hardly see what a handsome bastard Musashi is.</br>  <br> pretentious as fuck <br><br>Jesus christ, how stupid do you have to be to find it pretentious? Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake. But of course, it was directed for the mainstream Naruto audience, so majority buys it.<br><br>Well, now I´m sounding pretentious as hell for even explaining it.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>The answer for stopping the bloodshed is dumb, and I´m not buying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction <br>Yes, and some fools even believe than one day man will fly! Pish-posh!</br></br>  Wouldn't it be nice to have a worthy opponent?  <br>If you start, just remember when it stops that's it.. don't get your hopes up or dwell when it will finish.. it wont</br>  <br>There's always the book.</br>  <br> not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga <br>I disagree. In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that. The best part begins once Musashi can't fight as good as he used too anymore.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>to*</br>  I pray and hope everyday for ricefarmingsaga to continue  <br>naruto fangirl here, and i do like vinland because thorfinn reminds me of naruto. so dont shit on us narutofags.</br>  <br>You having a giggle there?</br>    <br> Musashi refusing the other Samurai's proposal of glory so that he can help a bunch of peasants <br> Despite the fact he's growing weaker every day, he's improving as a person and learning to understand other people and his surroundings. <br> That amount of despair when despite his efforts everything just goes wrong over and over again. <br> Old man becomming a total bro in the end and helping everybody out <br> Mushashi, who is now a walking hungry skeleton begging on his knees to the other samurai and making a deal with them so that they help that infertile land and help his friends/comrades <br><br>Pinnacle of the manga right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want REAL to genre shift into wrasslin' instead of cripple basketball.</br>  <br> refusing <br>casca is disgusting used goods. i rather read hitman reborn.</br></br>  <br>The artist probably would die before he can finish his remaining works.</br>  <br>Pro wrestling in manga? Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.  <br>Most sympathetic character.</br>  <br>I think most people understood that its korean drama or so i would suspect, but who the fuck watches that shit to know what you mean by it.<br>Christ nigger.</br></br>  <br>Unless Inoue decides to continue into Musashi's later years, it will end like the movie and the book do: he gets on board the boat leaving Ganryu Island, gets vaguely sad, the boat sails off to the sunset, THE END.<br><br><br> too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. <br>It's pretty realistic actually. The samurai who don't give a shit about fighting are not a part of the story in the first place, and for the rest it was pretty much like what is shown in the manga, a wide spectrum of characters ranging from old masters who have awakened to petty murderers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do go autistic on me know. If you already know what Korean drama is, you know what was implied.</br>  <br>I have no idea what was implied, I've never seen a single Korean drama and don't know how it relates to Vinland Saga.</br>  <br>I really dont, but whatever.<br>If this is your idea of "no spoonfeeding" keep at it.</br></br>  <br>Canute's change was sudden, but Thorfinn's change was not. There was a whole year when he went mindbroken and just did hard labour so he didn't need to think about anything, and then we got Einar's arrival, budding of friendship, and then after another year (or was it 2?) of working on the farm, Thorfinn realizes his new goal in life (vinland) only through the subplot of that slave woman and her husband. I'm hardly seeing any dramatic change in Thorfinn's character throughout. It was not a case of him being depressed one day, and the next day being motivated about not using violence for no reason.</br>  <br>Nah, it panders way too much to glorious nippongo. Reading it make you want to live in that era. Shigarui would be a better representation of the sword era, dishonorable, shitty, and inglorious.</br>  <br>Reading Vagabond didn't make me want to live in that era. People get killed left and right with hardly any consequences to the killers. It's a scary time.</br>  <br><br>Tetsuya Sariwatari, writer of Tough, has started writing a wrasslin' manga if I'm not mistaken.</br></br>  <br> Tough <br>I've been meaning to pick that up, but it's so long and I don't know if I can stick to a fighting series for that long. How good is it?</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>there's that buzzword again.<br><br>"edginess" aside the relationship and rivalry between Gennosuke and Seigen was far more interesting to me than anything in vagabond.<br><br>I also liked how the creator didn't have a romantic view of that era or the samurai class. these where violent cunts looking out for their best interest in order to rise in their shit heap of a society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The supposed edginess of Shigurui comes from the fact that the series is unnecessarily brutal, just like the time period it depicts.</br>  <br>Do not take that literally and go full retard. It is more in the line of: Damn, this is beautiful, such a romantic age, sword, manliness, and rice growing. I would like to experience that, of course with plot armor and not getting hunted down by forest bandits for a day. And then you realize how comfy you are on that room of yours with PC and Internet.</br>  <br> It is more in the line of <br>Dude, don't go taking your personal experience and pretending everyone else shares it.</br></br>  <br>I could see yaoi doujins of them if they wasnt drawn by somebody that couldnt draw.</br>  <br>HA! no</br>  <br>Then what is worth reading? Don't be shy anon.</br>  <br>When will you learn that people do not have to put IMO after every sentence to get that across. Is the Internet lad.</br>  <br>bleach is quite good, lol, only shonen manga i like, or read gantz, that is very bloody and good.</br>  <br>Shigurui goes to extreme of complete anti-glorification and does it on purpose. It has partly true elements but its whole cannot be taken as being realistic or accurate by anyone.<br>I agree with . The time frame presented in Vagabond isn't appealing.<br><br>Compared to Shigurui, the movie Sword of Doom (partial adaptation of the novel 大菩薩峠, "Great Bodhisattva Pass") is a more accurate representation of the times (just before the Meiji era) from the point of view of a sociopath samurai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I've only read part of Tough myself, I've been meaning to continue but other backlog priorities arose. It's pretty bizarre and not a very conventional fighting series, I remember: Bloodsport+Mortal Kombat-esque underground tournaments, mafia everywhere, borderline supernatural powers, some guys building up power and energy via sexual deprivation, strong and righteous MC who uses a super secret assassination art but doesn't kill people, some guy linked to his past because of his father, or something.<br>As for the author's other works, Dog Soldier is like dog shit, the Tough spinoff-prequel OTON is pretty good, and Igyoujin Oniwakamaru is great.<br><br>So yeah maybe give it a go and you'll see pretty quickly whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of youre wrong. Both Vag and Shi are unrealistic. One head to the extreme of showing the brutalization and ugliness of being a samurai. And the other one indulge in your desire of a romantic era. Men with dreams and ideals. <br><br>However, both should be read. As theres much enjoyment and learning to be had. Everyone should just put down their fucking fan flags.</br></br></br>  <br>After your description, I think I'll pass. I prefer martial arts stuff to be like Holyland.</br>  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>is okay at first, then turns very very very bad with evil uncle and the fights become a super power fights.</br>  <br>Compare, though: Shigurui doesn't show a single good thing about samurai life and the samurai, while Vagabond showed many bad aspects of them even if it doesn't focus on that.</br>  So how useful is dual wielding for real?  <br>Not very unless you can actually overpower someone with one hand.</br>  <br>Did the real Musashi ever actually dual wield? I know for a fact that he would utilize his short sword if he lost his primary weapon but I don't know if he ever used them at the same time as he's commonly depicted doing.</br>  <br> not useful until you got what it takes to utilize it. like every thing ever. <br>geez, do you moonlight as sherlock?</br></br>  <br>It's more than just skill or practice. That's like herculean strength.</br>  <br>Niten Ichi-ryu, he used his second sword as a parry tool. So yes.</br>  <br>never go full retard. you are assuming he is wielding a bastard sword on both hands or what? have you ever wielded a short sword? they are quite light and can be used to swing with one hand. dualwielding can be useful. throwing your other sword or use it to block.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being scrawny.</br>  <br>Absolutely. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Thank God there was 300+ chapters when I started.</br>  <br>Another thing is, Musashi did not take a vow to not kill or pick up the sword again like Thorfinn did. He just simply doesn't want to murder everyone who goes against him, like when his leg was injured and drew the circles when he was recognized as was challenged, yet all small fries stepped in.</br>  The hell you mean my pre-order was cancelled?  <br>We are running through these threads and it's just the first episode.</br>  <br><br>First episode that badly received?</br></br>  <br>Yes. They didn't show the siege of the imperial castle.</br>  <br>Not enough gore<br>Too much censorship</br></br>    <br>It's CA all over again, except it's not original.</br>  That entire fucking conversation.  <br>"That" conversation?</br>  <br>You know, "that"</br>  <br>Please stop, we don't need anymore combined forces of /k/,/pol/,/int/ shitposting on /a/</br>  So this is like Stargate combined with elves and mahou tsukai? Sweet.  <br>I'm glad, it's a good show and the threads are fun</br>  <br> middle of a conflict <br> budget cuts </br></br>  <br>around elves watch yourself</br>  <br>Why would /k/ shitpost?</br>  <br>Censored like hell</br>  <br>I didn't even get what the fuck was going on here until I read the manga</br>  <br> the time when they fill threads with incomprehensible discussion about something something weapon/vehicle </br>  <br>So what the fuck happened?</br>  Cobra kun, kawaii. <br><br>That slim fuselage I tell you.</br></br>  <br> So this is like Stargate <br><br>Except Stargate was very much better than this.<br><br>Daniel so moe. Jack so tsun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That</br>  <br>Not every country can afford being bad ass.</br>  <br>That.</br>  <br>Outbreak Company was better.<br><br>Japan got fantasy people to give them precious minerals and metals in exchange for useless otaku shit.<br><br>Also, instead of the nobles' children learning how to be nobles, Japan make them waste time by reading manga and watching anime, effectively destroying the ability of the next generation to lead.<br><br>In Gate, Japan acts way more retarded and loses money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanted to see Type-10 chan but Type-74 is fine too</br>  <br>That's only because in Outbreak Company, they didn't send an army of orcs and monsters and wyvern riders to fuck Tokyo up. <br><br>If they didn't do that, then surely Japan could have traded useless shit and the like for ore and oil drilling rights.</br></br></br>  <br>GATE nip goverment is way more friendly and willingfull to help people on the otherside of the gate and want to achieve economic cooperation through diplomacy.<br>Outbreak nip gov realized the people in the other world were easy exploitable and went full cultural genocide mode for the sole purpose to rape their countries.<br>Neither of them are retards.</br></br></br>  <br>Gate Japanese government fucked up by killing a shit ton of important young male heirs from important families.<br><br>Japs already fucked up the next generation of those Roman leaders.<br><br>Also, how can you say the Jap government in Gate is more friendly when they already killed thousands of people while the Jap government in Outbreak killed no one?<br><br>The Jap government already caused a shit ton of political chaos and instability in the fantasy world in Gate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So can someone spoil the future chapters/episodes?<br><br>Is the LN done?  How did it end? <br>I know the manga is still ongoing or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, how can you say the Jap government in Gate is more friendly when they already killed thousands of people <br>So the nips should have let the imperial army raze to the ground Tokyo and kill all their soldiers in Alnus?<br>In Outbreak no one died only because the tsundere loli queen didn't sent the army agaist nips.</br></br></br>  I am at manga chapter 47.  Did the rabbit successfully kill Japanese senators?   <br> japanese government caused <br> implying the japanese were the aggressors </br></br>  <br> How did it end? <br><br>the gate is closed</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to the guy and the girls?</br>  <br>Most JSDF evacuates.<br>Itami stays behind and becomes badass knight.<br>Leilei manages to open the gate after 4 years.<br>First thing Itami does is visit Comiket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He fucked them all into pregnancy, had a bunch of kids in another world, then everyone died of super aids.</br>  I can wait until he ends up boning that knight.  <br>He didn't choose anyway as well if I remember it correctly. Don't know why he didn't though.</br>  <br>He's definitely gay.</br>  <br>All of the couples in this are adorable.</br>  <br>What happen to the Empire? I may suppose the old emperor is forced to abdication in favor of her daughter after what happened with the nips</br>  <br>and what you mean by "that", exactly?</br>  <br>I do like the whole "MC gets a Harem, but pretty much every other dude also scores" approach.</br>  <br>JSDF lead full-on invasion into imperial capital. The emperor gets killed but Zorzal escapes and start running guerrila war against JSDF.<br>Not sure what happens afterwards.</br></br>  I haven't downloaded/watched the first episode yet but can someone please explain to me what the fuck they did to Rory?  <br>They made her better.</br>  <br>No more Goth loli</br>  <br>They made her more appealing to the masses.</br>  <br>The girls? Harem?</br>  <br>diplomacy failed than, unless Pina Colada go agaist the JSDF too it should her job to rebuild a more moderate country but the old empire is good as dead.</br>  <br> better <br>literal shit</br></br>  <br>Covered in the Gaiden each girl gets their own volume</br>  <br>Any links on that?<br><br>If not at least some summary on it if you would be so kind.</br></br></br>  <br> gaiden 1: Pina officially joins the harem after Itami saves her while showing off his ranger survival skills.<br>gaiden 2: back history explaining how Rory became demigod 900 years ago intertwined with the grand wedding (repeat of the vows) party of Tomita.<br>gaiden 3: Itami went ALONE with Tuka to chase down the rumor of her missing father, and got involved in a war of the northern countries.<br>gaiden 4: the reopening of the gate, and the revenge of Lady Randall.</br></br></br> <br>No idea with 5</br></br>  <br>There are Gaiden stories that chronicle the years inbetween the gate closing and reopening.

She's also somewhat bloodthirsty, and several characters have pointed out how she's not afraid to get her hands dirty.</br>  <br>We mean... THAT</br>  <br>It's not over you retarded fuckface why the fuck are you lying to people?</br>  I am just waiting till Empire to realize how fucked they are once they learn of Japan's history.  <br>Yeah, looks like the designs are already an indication that they will censor a lot. I mean she really  kinda really almost kinda punched that fucking prince to death right? </br>  <br> Don't tell me they will censor the shit out of this. <br>Have you been following the threads? It's like the studio is afraid of offending anyone or not appealing to the greatest population. Not only is most of the violence WAY toned down, the localized versions seem to cut out some extra, just to avoid hurting China's and Korea's feelings.</br></br>  <br>3rd Recon unit knows that their commander is an otaku and his preference for not working. <br><br>New gear meant that they were going to be part of the recon mission which meant work.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, looks like the designs are already an indication that they will censor a lot. <br><br>The first episode was an indication they will censor it a lot, you don't need the designs to realize that.<br><br>In the anime I think 10 nips got killed in the beginning, in the manga there's a mountain of corpses. <br>As for the designs.. they all look like generic SAO characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>No, he just fell down some stairs during the Earthquake.</br></br>  <br> implying that the japanese are the aggressors in GATE <br>"Hurr, muh innocent romans dindu nuffin', dey good conqueror boys killing civilians in Tokyo"<br>You're either a cuck or just an american. (Although, both of them are pretty much the same thing)</br></br></br>  <br>Why they replaced Japan flag with France flag?</br>  <br> If he hadn't spilled some info and passed out, she very well might've killed him. <br><br>She's already been shown several times absolutely slaughtering rank-and-file troops and mercenaries, and apparently has a reputation for fighting so hard that she breaks her equipment.<br><br>I have a hard time reconciling that with her anime persona.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> China's and Korea's feelings. <br>It's murica.</br></br>    <br><br>To add onto this, there's a chapter named after her beating the shit out of people.</br></br>  <br>Retard anon, can't you clearly see he fell off the stairs?<br>She just stood there laughing and that was all!</br></br>  You will never distribute Belgian waffles to a force several epochs below you. <br><br>Why even prosper?</br></br>  <br>Shut up faggot, your joke isnt funny</br>  <br>Probably all 3 of them.

These are the sorts of individuals that need to be purged.</br></br>    <br> japanese woman are strong as a deity <br><br>I-I dont even..</br></br></br>  <br>I know there was a contingent of Chinese shitposters in here a while back after the first episode aired. That was ugly.</br>  <br>The sun flag is traditional flag to attach to the fishing boat.</br>  <br> Does the elf girl still call him "Father"? From the current chapter in the manga she said that she will still call him that.<br><br>So that means Itami 5 girls? Dark Elf, Elf, Pina, Rory, and Leilei?<br><br>Can't believe he boned none of them<br/></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>So when is the remake going to happen?</br>  I for one would like to see the anime designs for the rose knights.<br><br><br>Also mfw i realized that those are not crinkles in her uniform after looking at the full image instead of the thumbnail.

He hasn't boned any of them yet but deepened his relationship with each of them. There are many more girls outside the harem looking in like Giselle and Mabel, both apostles like Rory. </br>  <br> And yes until now Tuka calls Itami dad even though dad's found alive. </br>  <br>ex wife killed his sex drive</br>  This might not be the place for it, but Japan accepted the Giant robot 1 on 1 against America.  <br>Well rori's crazy battlelust expressions are still decent, so have faith?</br>  <br> I-I dont even.. <br>To be fair the women who made it to the top all had to be tough as nails to have gotten that far.</br></br>  <br>Eh, we'll see.<br><br>There hasn't really been any "real" combat scenes yet, so who knows, maybe they'll do a good job.</br></br></br>  <br> her combat scenes <br>Seeing how they're censoring this show, I doubt we'll have any.</br></br>  <br>That as a backward country militarily impotent to the West, they modernized to become a world power by 1905 but had their entire empire gone after the Asia-Pacific War?</br>  <br> Ehhhh that's kinda corny then. Don't wanna bone someone like that even if her design is great.<br><br>Not a fan of lolis but it looks like Rori is the closest to him.</br></br> </br>  Dakka .50s.  I will never be able to get over this<br> suffered surprise attack from the not Romans <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens and figuring out that they were kidnapped <br> oh no, the citizens were turned into slaves DURAMA <br> Diet being THAT retarded <br> no mention of Japan being USA's buttbudy <br> not a single world leader stopped and thought about learning the power of traveling to other worlds, or magic or any implications of this other than MUH RESOURCES <br>I dropped it at the shitty slave reveal so I don't know if any of this is answered later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> turned her into an idol <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens <br><br>They're missing you dense fuck, if they knew where they are then they aren't missing.</br></br></br>  I don't understand why A-1 got this. The material is outside of their, how do you say it, scope?  <br>A-1 always gets popular franchises that already have an established fanbase. They don't care if they butcher it since fans are buying it anyways.</br>  <br> go missing right around the time they get attacked <br> GEE, I WONDER WHERE DID THEY GO? <br>How fucking retarded are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be pretty obvious where they went? The choices are fantasyland and best corea.</br>  <br>They deserve it too.<br>Good squad.</br></br>  <br>The thing is even though they know they might be on the other side. They don't know where exactly. There is no indication that they are slaves of royality.</br>  <br> fake battles <br>As expected from america</br></br>  <br>There was a bit in the manga IIRC where the emperor warns the Japanese diiplomats something like "there was an empire that prided itself on its military might but it crumbled and was destroyed by outsiders".<br><br>Thus misunderstanding two key points: firstly, that Japan's military isn't all that powerful, and secondly, that Japan's military empire has already collapsed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't cross off people with no confirmed bodies.  The missing Japanese people were taken on previous scouting missions even before the Gate went up. It's in the manga when Noriko was hospitalized. Her family was near the gate distributing flyers of her and her husband, her husband died in the mines, and their house is burned down after a long time of no one in there. </br></br>  <br>And NONE of the JSDF reports on this foreign culture mentioned "they take prisoners as slaves from the people they attack, we should ask them if they took any of ours"?</br>  <br>Maybe ask one of those senators they were buddying up with? Maybe actually bother to investigate, or maybe use their peanut brains to figure out that a culture that obviously practices slavery could have put their citizens in chains and thought nothing of it?<br>Slavery is obviously completely normal to them and they don't have any human rights codes.<br>That forced drama scene really pissed me off.</br></br></br>  <br> we should ask them if they took any of ours <br>They would have probably told them the truth, too.<br>We were shown that they were all surprised that the Nips got so butthurt about slavery.<br> yeah we took your people, so what? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Man i love .50</br>  <br>Those missing people were taken before the Gate went up in Ginza.

And it would not be profitable if they paid miners enough.</br></br>  <br>It's still retarded that they didn't think that some of their own people could have been turned into slaves. Then they acted all surprised and horrified that the savages were savages.<br>It's shitty writing, get fucked</br></br>  <br>And we won't be alive when it happens. I wish I could be an apostle like Rory only so I could witness the creation of the first Gundam</br>  <br> miners getting paid <br> anyone willingly going into the mines <br>You go there to suffer and die</br></br></br>  <br>It's retarded that you think a defeated medieval army would take prisoners and slaves back to their kingdom.<br>Japan didn't know scouts were around a few months before the invasion.

If the Empire is Imperial Japan then shouldn't the nationalistic author make them look good instead of over the top, mustache twirling, baby eating, bunny raping villains.</br>  <br>But bunnies are made for rape.<br>Raping bunnies doesn't make you a villain.</br></br>  <br>Can't speak for the rest of it, but the Prince's words in chapter 47 are pretty much word for word the mindset of the Japanese towards the end of the war. <br>By 1945 they knew by they could not win, but Japan had never been defeated in a war and their pride would not let them surrender unconditionally. <br>Hence the approach they took was to try and inflict as many casualties on the Americans as possible in suicide missions to try and make them lose the will to continue the war and come to a negotiated peace settlement, rather than a onesided surrender.<br>Had the Allies gone through with the invasion of the home islands rather than dropping the atomic bombs, they would basically have had to wade through a sea of bodies of Japanese who fanatically refuse to surrender rather than die. Doesn't help that their initial plan was to invade Kyushu using Okinawa as a staging ground, but the Japanese plan was to throw everything they had in a do or die defense of Kyushu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is afghanistan <br><br>step it up m8</br></br></br>  <br>+1</br>  <br/>  <br> we want the Idolm@ster audience <br><br>l'm scared to see the monster girls, l bet they were all devolved into cosplay tier now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's such a dumb cunt it hurts.</br></br>  <br><br>This would be great if it wasn't shown that the bunny queen is just manipulating him to fuck up the kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Yep they even installed a pretender on the throne of another kingdom.<br>I felt that the way the jap government is acting is similar to the way they did things on the imperial era.<br>Forcing inequal treaties on everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair comparison, considering that she fought alongside Rory.</br>  <br>We get the same here in Australia over whales. I get it, I don't like their government pulling that shit either, but the millions of fucking people affected had nothing to do with it.</br>  <br>oh boy ,this is going to be harem shit + idolshit+ /k/</br>  <br>Actually, she went missing BEFORE the attack.<br>Her parents were killed during the attack while passing out fliers of the fact she was missing.</br></br>  <br>the joke is that no matter how hard she tries to get them to, Japan will not realistically destroy the empire for one citizen, and even if they tried the Americans would stop them.</br>  god that elf with normal sized tits looked nice for once. and it ends that she is fucking stupid. FUCK.   People knew months ago that it would be censored because of all the right-wing stuff <br> Even brought up how it would focus more on the harem <br> Get mad now when it's exactly how it turned out </br></br>  <br> Forcing inequal treaties on everyone. <br><br>To be fair they were attacked unprovoked and they're asking for land, mining rights and no taxes.<br><br>They could have just assassinated the leaders with drones within the first week.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> murrican </br>  Tell me about Itami, what does he fight for?  <br>This post has made my day.</br>  <br>For his Hobby</br>  <br>N-Naru?!</br>  <br>He fights against anime censorship.</br>  <br>She's not calling her captain junon boy so no</br>  <br>For his ex-wife.</br>  <br>He fights for /a/!</br>  Reminder that only America has black people in their military and Japan has never committed a warcrime  <br>Because Captain and Junon boy are the same person, yeah...<br><br>also, she grown up</br></br></br>  <br> China <br> Black troops <br> Russia <br> Black troops outside of the Africans there for training <br><br>Also JSDF =/= Imperial Army</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does anyone know if that was because of Crunchyroll asking them to, or self-censoring on their end?</br>  <br> ... <br/></br>  <br> Japan has never committed a warcrime <br>This is true, when you consider the fact that warcrimes didn't exist at the time that they committed an action that could be called as such.</br></br>  <br>Quads of truth</br>  <br>Maybe the Japanese studio read about all the issues over the Confederate flag.</br>  <br>Outdoors?</br>  <br>Definitely self-censoring, considering raws are not censored.</br>  <br>That has nothing to do with it.

You watch too much UFC height doesn't matter when blades and bullets are attached.</br>  The fantasy world would win against Japan but they would likely need to sacrifice an entire city's population for a dark ritual to appease a major god of war/death, etc and request him to destroy Japan's army but it seems that humans in this fantasy world don't depend on the gods as much as other races.<br><br>Also, does the Empire not have any necromancers?<br><br>That way, an army of corpses would still have their uses since I don't think skeletons would care that much about bullets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic and gods doesn't work like that in Gate.</br>  <br>Magic isn't that developed and is limited to simple actions like throw stones or make people sleepy.</br>  <br><br> They would win if they did all these hypotheticals I'm not even sure exist </br></br>      <br>The Gate Gods interfere in the mortal realm just as much as the Greek gods did and are equally immature.</br>  Is he the guy who goes <br><br> Shit, I'm hard. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, they're whimsical, but they're not aligned with the empire, and there's no indication that they exchange sacrifices for favors.</br>  <br>That's an interesting way of having sex.</br>    <br>He's the cat-girl guy.</br>  <br>Hardy does not seem to even notice the deaths of all her followers.<br>Maybe Emroy the god of death could be appeased by sacrifices.</br></br>  <br> rice grain near mouth <br>I didn't ask for homoerotic subtext.</br></br>  <br>I loved how notPutin reacted</br>  There are Japanese people that actually think America cant just show up and do whatever the fuck they want  <br> Shit, I'm hard. <br>It might be one of the three low rank stooges pushing a wheelbarrow in the OP.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The gods can kill the Japanese however they want if they so wish?</br></br></br>    <br><br>Wait what?

Shirou then imitates Archer and gets his powers, so Shirou imitates himself who is his future self from an alternate dimension's past.</br>  <br>That's it you win.</br>  <br>Sakura a shit anyway, so Rin is still the best girl.</br>  <br>I would punch that faggot in the face and take Rin home.</br>  <br>Back to your shotacon class Negi.</br>  <br>Eat the entire city for mana, summon grail with mana, birth the real angry manjew, kill everyone.</br>  <br>Says the faggot who didn't end up with anyone even though he had a Harem. Stay being Gay</br>  “Hmm, it is rather regrettable. Heroes have a time limit too, and it’s hard to fulfill once you become an adult. It would have been better if I realized that earlier.” <br><br>Had he realized it earlier – then he wouldn’t have been tricked by the sweet lie of miracles that flew the banner called dreams. <br><br>Kiritsugu had once released a demon powerful enough to destroy the world because of his aspirations. It was too late when he finally realized his mistake. Countless people had died because of it, including Shirō’s own father and mother. <br><br>And that harbinger of Hell was still lurking beneath Mount Enzō even now. After that battle, Kiritsugu had repeatedly visited that place with dynamite, and spent years to map out the situation of a few leylines. He had meticulously created a ‘bump’ at a location leading towards Mount Enzō. That might be the last time for him to use magecraft in his life. <br><br>The prana produced from the junction of numerous leylines will collect upon that ‘bump’ with time. When its limit is reached, a localized earthquake will be triggered deep within Mount Enzō. It would take a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of about 40 years for the ‘bump’ to break. If all his calculations were correct, then the cavern within Mount Enzō would collapse and seal away the “Greater Grail” forever. Though he would not be able to live to see that day, Kiritsugu had done the best he could to prevent the fifth Heaven’s Feel 60 years later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer these two.</br>  <br> Summon a large amount of mama <br> Literally targeting herself with a big red dot <br> Implying Gil wouldn't kill her for being a mongrel <br> Implying Saber wouldn't Excalibur her </br></br></br></br>  <br>At least he tried.</br>  <br>I'm getting passed around like a Guinea coin here.</br>  <br>When did this nigga get so fucking ripped?</br>  <br>The only lover you have is Fate and even now your separated</br>  <br>Gotta look good for his waifu.</br>  Rin, Lancer and Taiga are the only likable characters in Fate.  <br> Ayako <br> Issei </br></br>  <br>You forgot Shinji.</br>  I like doujinshi with Rin/Gil or Rin/lancer better.
