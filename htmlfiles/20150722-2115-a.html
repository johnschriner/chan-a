[ Boruto new trailer is out. <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=puQ3<wbr>2k5HFGU</wbr>  [ ] [Embed]<br>Apparently he can use Gentle fist but obviously he can't strike the chakra points, still based I guess.<br><br>Also reminder that tommorow there's Madara vs fucking 8 gates Gai</br></br></br></br>  New Gerry thead?  Go away.   all this cancer in one post <br>Damn, impressive</br>    New material has already been discussed here:<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128412<wbr>785<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></wbr></br></br>            <br>Hello friend.</br>  <br>Is fuck off babbys only word?</br>  <br>Hi</br>  So, how 'bout them lakers?            Why are Bleach/Fairy Tail/One Piece thread allowed but not Nardo threads? They're all shounenshit.  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12841<wbr>2785</wbr> <br>How was that discussed?<br>All I see is the same shitposting here</br></br></br>  <br>because /a/ doesn't want to be associated with THAT kind of fanbase xDD</br>  <br>Cancer pls go.</br>  <br>It is an epic meme to shitpost in Naruto threads, and a way for people to prove to themselves they totally belong.</br>  <br>Nar tards are the worst kind of fanbase, half of /v/ flocks here to discuss it, we can't allow that.</br>  <br>Bleach and Fairy Tails threads are dead and slow.<br><br>One Piece while having a pretty bad fanbase were never as bad as Narutards.</br></br></br>  Can I get some recognition for spamming shit threads?  <br>Scroll down.</br>  <br>Keep posting lewd and stop trying to give dumb arguments that nobody actually believes.<br><br>I want to fap, not read your blabbering</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto is the line in the sand. The day /a/ accepts Naruto as part of /a/ is the day we know that /a/ we knew is dead.</br>    <br>With /v/ nowadays, I'm honestly not surprised<br>They prefer Kill la Kill over Berserk.</br></br>  <br>Im sorry you're too retarded to hit a booru or sad panda if you want to fap.</br>  <br>here's an [upvote] my fellow 4channer :^)</br>    I was kinda hoping boruto would be a true failure. No fox chakra and no byukagen eyes. But looks like he's on his was to doing some lighting rasengan stuff  <br>Because those threads aren't as cancerous as nardo threads.</br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br>    <br>/v/ has also had shit taste, they use weebao wrong ironically. That board is a lost cause</br>  <br>You are the best. I'm actually really grateful.</br>        This thread is hilarious, there are actually no people trying to discuss Naruto or even replying to the baits, yet you people keep samefagging the same loli and garry pics.<br><br>It's like you're retarded</br></br>      <br>In my opinion all shounen shit shouldn't be allowed except for One Piece, it's the only decent shounen that is readable.</br>  <br> garry <br>For shame</br></br>  <br> yet you people keep samefagging the same loli and garry pics <br>You're acting like there is a problem with this.</br></br>  <br>Im helping the people that want to build a wonderful loli folder.</br>  <br>Its a nice loli thread.</br>  <br> It's like you're retarded <br>well we're on /a/</br></br>  <br> They prefer Kill la Kill over Berserk <br>You can shit on /v/ all you want, but that's just plain not true</br></br>        <br>/v/ still have decent taste, they hate SAO.</br>  <br>No it's not, One Piece is fucking shit and has shit pacing.<br><br>HxH, FMA and Magi are the only battle shonens that should be allowed. World Trigger is also a great new series.<br> Of course that's battle shonen, manga like BECK shouldn't be put in the same category as OP Bleach or Naruto</br></br></br></br>    <br>Everyone hates SAO<br>Even fucking Tumblr hates SAO</br></br>      <br>/v/ has better taste than /a/.<br><br>Shingeki no Kyojin and SAO threads get shitposted and pruned by MODS. Berserk threads are allowed and probably anything that's not shit.</br></br></br>  <br>i like sao</br>    <br>Sure, anon.<br>And I actually enjoy the porn i'm posting right now.</br></br>  <br> Wan Piss <br> Good </br></br>  <br>Everyone but airhead females hate SAO. /v/ constantly shits on games that look anime related as weeabo shit then the same people jack off to nintendo and sony, /v/ was fine until it lost it roots and just because another retard gamer board that flings console related buzzwords at each other all day. <br><br>I am sorry but fuck /v/, it is unredeemable.</br></br></br>  This thread would just fall off the board without you guys, but you are making it the fastest bumping thread for some reason        <br>I wonder why.</br>  <br> Berserk threads <br>Oh my let me bask in your great fucking taste, I bet leet legends like you guys watch the anime only, its a shame /a/ doesn't have 24/7 beserk threads.</br></br>         this shit will never end   <br>Fuck off pirateshit<br><br><br><br><br><br>This. I honestly couldn't agree more</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great isn't it.</br>    <br> hating on pirates <br>but Wan Piss is indeed trash.</br></br>  <br>Why would we want this thread to end? Its great.</br>    <br> implying anyone has ever only watched the Berserk anime <br>It's fiendishly designed to make you seek out the manga for closure. Then it traps you on the boat with everyone else</br></br>  I'm curious about gentle fist without byakugan. Maybe he will just use it in combination with more traditional taijutsu and have a very good combo going.      <br>That ass is way to big for a loli</br>  More like bore-uto.  <br>Not really, i'm not from /v/ just saying what I saw a couple days ago checking their shit.<br><br>People get called out by liking SAO SnK and similar shit, Berserk manga gets talked about and how a good game could come from that. Good anime/manga is talked about too. <br><br>Fate threads get shitposted and sent to /a/ because they say shit belongs on /a/</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thats cool and all but whats your opinion on this lady?</br>  <br>Literally the first topic related post</br>  And I want Salad to show some old sharingan tactics. Like before all the wizards thing.  <br> i'm not from /v/ </br>    <br>I don't hate pirates, I hate one piece "pirates"<br><br><br>That is what pedos say to justify themselves for liking loli, seriously.<br><br> They have women bodies but small chest and height </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what's wrong with her hair</br>  <br>Until /v/ has a good K-On thread leave me out of it.</br>  <br>I'm going to kiss Akatsukis anus !</br>    <br>Pretty much. It looks like they will be able to pull a decent set of moves for him.</br>  <br>I'm not, really. Just saying what I saw. <br><br>I also have no sort of love for /a/, i'm here since 2010 because I like talking about seasonal anime and /a/ is one of the few places that bothers with shit like that.</br></br></br>  <br> They have women bodies but small chest and height <br><br>Thats a problem though, look at this creature. This is an 18 year old.</br></br></br>    <br>How can /v/ pull that off when /a/ hasn't</br>  <br>Nothing. Its just cute.</br>    And I don't know what the fuck is Hanabi doing. She must have something to show also, right?  <br><br>K On needs to be good to have decent threads.<br><br>Also moeshit is still a big no there, and I said moeshit because moe gets talked about, moeshit(k on, lucky star and similar Kyoanus) is nono</br></br></br></br>    <br> when /a/ hasn't <br>There has been literally 3 K-On threads, we even sent out an anon to Toyosato.</br></br>  Mooo~  Just ban all threads related to anime on pic related, Japan agrees that they are the most popular anime  <br>eww, cowtits are gross</br>    <br>Conan threads are rare. The others should get banned indeed but mods have a boner only for Nardo.<br>Also Add FT and Bleach there</br></br>  <br> K-On needs to be good <br> hating Kyoani <br>Fuck you faggot.</br></br></br>      <br> I'm not from /v/ <br>Thats exactly what someone from /v/ would say but ill humor you, here is what is wrong with /v/ when it comes to anime. <br>Most faggots on /v/ are in that intial anime stage where they are thinking<br> I will only watch dubbed because screw reading and screw Japanese  <br> I will only watch Mature anime for mature people like myself fuck moe shit <br> I won't jack off to weird shit <br> Rather than use google I will ask /a/ for recommendations because no one asks recommendations there and I am an entitled child.  <br><br>Some stay like this and some are normies are obvlious to the other 95% of anime. But if you watch anime full time you will run out of the listed stuff above VERY quickly. Soon you will start watching subs, then you will start watching seasonal slice of life, why? because there is nothing else, literally nothing else. <br><br>Face it, you either give up watching new stuff and wallow in a false self confidence or you are with the rest of us jacking off to odd or cute shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the ban time for that img ? <br><br>2 days ?</br></br></br>  What the fuck is Kabuto doing with onions babies.      <br>I don't hate KyoAni, I hate SHIT shows from KyoAni. FMP was fucking great, Hyouka too. Amaburi was really fun. I could go on<br>Haven't checked Euphonium because /a/ fanbase is really cancerous about it but i'll check it later.<br><br>I don't care about studio wars, I just call out that shit shows are shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>at least crop u fag</br>      <br>No, people there hate dubs because of the same reason they hate dubs on their japanese games.<br><br>The only ones making a fuss are some normies that get ignored when they start saying weeaboo</br></br></br>  <br>OP has been spamming this thread for a while now and he only got a slap on the wrist.<br><br>I think i'm okay.<br><br><br> /a/ fanbase is really cancerous about it <br>/u/ crossboarding</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      Am I a Kool kid yet ? <br><br>a Loli and from berserk too</br></br>  <br>Glad she died, shit manga. Worse writing than FT</br>    <br>I remember this campaign<br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2014/10/16/japanese-governments-<wbr>manga-anime-guardians-project-launc<wbr>hes-join-us-friends-campaign<br> luffy on anti piracy <br>Always make me laugh</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  This a pretty weak loli dump, anons. This is why you're failures that'll never achieve anything in life, you're always half-assing everything      <br>Mate I use to browse /v/ donkeys years ago and left around the time console shitposting became a frequint thing. People who like subs have always been a minority, people just hate subs when they first hear it but once you get an ear for it your fine, just look at any super thread there is nothing but shitposting about subs.</br>  <br> you're failures <br>yes</br></br>    <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> /u/ crossboarding <br><br>No, /a/ is just really cancerous about it. It's not euphonium fanbase tho, it's KyoAni fanbase that pretty much everyone that's not one of them agrees is cancerous, like SHAFT faggots</br></br></br>    <br> donkeys years <br>donkeys is fine no need to put years next to it.<br><br>also brit fuck off</br></br></br></br>     tries to filter out 'cancer' with more cancer <br> mods don't even care <br>This is why /a/ is the worst board on 4chan</br></br>      <br> I think i'm okay. <br>see you in 3 days</br></br>  <br>Console shitposting is awful, seen that too. /vg/ seems better than /v/ to be honest, there's no shitposting and nobody goes around shitposting threads there.<br><br> People who like subs have always been a minority <br>Not really, unless you mean people who like subs on DBZ and stuff like that.<br>Also /a/ gets a daily Dubs are best xDDD thread, and no most of them are not ironic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're not trying to filter anything, fuck off back to /v/</br>    Mods ? MODS ?!  <br> loli <br> cancer <br><br>You crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/vg/ is full of tripfags and your last sentence is a lie.</br>  <br>Are you still in your "Japanese voice acting can't be shit" phase?</br>  <br><br>Cry harder, you know you enjoy this.</br></br>  <br> I'm going to report your thread. <br><br>I could go and SS the rule that says that's against the rules but I'm guessing you're just pretending to be retarded</br></br></br>  <br>way to be an hero</br>    Fuck off, narutards.    So who's your hentaifu?<br><br>I can't decide between these two beautiful ladies.</br></br>  The grill on the right is a straight-up freak, yo  <br>That's why she's the best</br>  I will fap to Meat all day.    <br>I know the girl on the left. What is the girl on the right from?</br>  This meme needs to die, I though /a/ knew better than using waifu like the underage memesters do  <br>Iori from EROGE! Sex and Games Make Sexy Games</br>  Time to fap /a/  Perfect for a good raping  <br> not fapping only once a day, before you go to bed </br>    <br><br> will never breed and marry </br></br>   Resort Boin <br><br>welp time to watch it again</br></br>  <br>Where can I find more hentai like these? Mostly vanilla where the girl wants it/initiates? It's pretty hard to find those things + good animation...</br>  <br> piss <br> feces <br> cum on food </br></br></br>    The short hair tomboy from Discipline.  <br>piss and feces is pretty damn gross I agree<br><br> but that whole scent thing and dirty sex just makes me wild </br></br></br>  <br>it's mafuyu, now quit asking</br>  <br>Always and forever.<br>Thanks for introducing me to monster rape.</br></br>  <br>I was ok with blonde girl antics then I got to diaper with black hair fancy girl. That was fucked, fastest I've ever gone from full to nil.</br>  <br>That series was very dull and ruined by the guy.</br>  <br>Vanilla sex is amazing though</br>  <br>mind breaking her is best</br>  <br>I know the girl on the right. What is the girl on the left from?</br>  <br>I also loved when the camera constantly cut to the guys face</br>  <br>Resort Boin.</br>  <br><br><br>Also twintails + glasses combination.

I would cafe her junkie  <br>When will we get something with her instead of that whore Yukikaze getting fucked by a fat guy for 20 minutes?</br>  <br>So both of them it is.</br>    <br>Wait what?<br><br>DId I miss a new chapter?</br></br></br>    Does Manga count  <br> Dick Cheese </br>  <br>There's 16 chapters right?</br>    <br>Yes</br>  Dumbpire, always been always will be.  <br>Mein negger</br>  <br> Grows hips and tits and rubs against him <br> Reverses all that and turns into hypergeneric catgirl for sex <br>It's bad and I hate it</br></br></br>  <br>All shit compared to a Dullahan</br>  The one and only.  <br>Simply awful</br>  I actually love both sisters, but I just barely love Chiyo a little more.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128366192 <br>I've had the same waifu since 2011, yep almost 5 years.<br>I mostly fap to solo pics of her, ecchi mainly. <br>But sometimes, ocassionaly I like wanking to some good doujins of other girls on sadpanda. Boys have libido anon.<br><br>But yeah I don't have a hentaifu.

Also the 1st girl he fucked was the best.</br></br></br>    <br>Oh fuck yes.</br>  <br> Literally the holy trinity of cuckolding </br>      <br/>  <br><br>Why Hitler?</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>     You will never marry a cute futa     <br>You mean episode 2?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Distance really is the best<br><br>I love the proto-Lacross series where the guy fucks his lactating pregnant aunt</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Distance is like the Michael Bay of creampies. It feels like there's a $2,000,000 budget behind every cumshot.</br>  <br>He's one of the few artist who spends more than one panel on it<br><br>Hell last Distance thing I read he spent three pages on it</br></br></br>    She's a cute and so is her imouto.    <br>CONTINUATION NEVER<br>I just want to see the trap take the futacock...</br></br>  <br>Good fucking taste oh my god.

I just wipe it off and be on my way.</br></br>  need more loving fox moms  As usual, no mention of her, when most other boards would have posted her right away. I'd be disappointed, if I wasn't used to it.  <br>Could it be leftover precum from not ejaculating semen after edging?It's not retrograde ejaculation is it?</br>  <br><br>i dunno but better out than in.</br></br>     how hard  would you?  <br> Her begging for her sister to forgive her while her sister's boyfriend rapes her <br>That is the only scene I jerked off to in the Asagi anime but I must've done it at least four or five times that night</br></br>  <br><br> gently at first <br><br> then once her brain learns to accept the pleasure the body was receiving, dick her hard and long throughout the night <br><br> with lots of kissing and  lewd hand holding complete with fingerlocking </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pissed again,no grayish matter.

LL is like the prime example and reasoning behind why normals shit on anime. Typical "Oh, its so fucking weird and girly lol why you like watching a bunch of higschool girls dance you pedophile." also misogynistic/sexist/objectifying bullshit etc. I am actually too scared to even ask my half normalfag friend about what he thinks of the show if I were to show him a clip because I know what the response would be. Girls may like it, but any normalfag guy would shit all over it.</br></br>  <br>Kotori is bigger than that. I might just be thinking that because all doujins portray her as cowtitted though.</br>   almost no love for Nico <br><br>best and cutest girl with best personality</br></br>  <br> &gt;almost no love for Nico <br>You know that's not true.

It's fucking weird. They don't like it. Walk up during airing day and ask for a LL ticket and tell me you couldn't feel the stares.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to a screening? Then you will realize I was right. Its going to be full of normalfags/girls. <br><br>Why would I even lie about this?</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Of my love to best live</br>  <br> Its going to be full of girls and landwhales <br>FTFY.<br><br>You're not lying, you're just ignorant. Of all anime, you believe LL is the one that's going to be more accepted. Can you imagine a jockfag/club rat or whatever else walking into a screening? Probably not. I can see him walking into a DBZ/Naruto/SnK screening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this any worse?</br>  So /a/ meets up and goes to love live desu?  <br>Well, believe whatever you want. I hope you have the balls to apologize in a thread after you went to a screening.</br>  <br>Why are they posing in a parking garage of all places?</br>  <br>ikr? Its the worst place for a cosplay picture. Especially for an idol cosplay.</br>  <br>Well, admittedly, I was more aloof about the fact that anime had a pretty big stigma, but highschool girls dancing is indeed worse than highschool girls fighting, even if it is in frilly dresses and with magic.<br><br><br>I would but I'm not going to the screening. Too big a pussy. We wouldn't be in the same thread anyway . Different country = different air time and different thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of the Madoka movies went well, why would this?</br>  <br> None of the Madoka movies went well, <br>What do you mean?</br></br>  <br> Kotori's line <br>Unforgivable.</br></br>  <br>Have you seen the pictures?<br><br>Think it was the NY one but they went for dinner sometime before/after the movie. They looked fucking disgusting, especially what looked like some balding guy in his 30s wearing a wifebeater.</br></br></br>  <br>Love Live is very big in Asia because school girl dancing is more acceptable. It is a mainstream anime there.<br>Lower your headphone volume for this one.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OCb<wbr>NGeGnuM4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>How is that not going well? They got along, right? Trashy scum, yes, but what is going well if not getting along?</br>  <br>Some of the people who are going will report back anyway. So whatever. It doesn't even air in my country.</br>  <br>I don't I would ever want to meet anyone from 4chan in real life lmao.</br>  <br>It's okay, no one wants to meet you either.</br>  <br>I realize this.

Rin has a nice body at least.</br>  <br>Her cat voice is annoying but whenever she breaks out of it it's sexy as hell. See most Lily White songs.</br>  Little souvenir I got from the Love Live Movie. The front and back look like an international letter. Most of it is just the love lives expressing their gratitude for supporting them.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-4U<wbr>MNX81fBE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>im jelous anon-san</br>  <br>Was the movie good?</br>  <br>I thought it was pretty good. Each girl gets a decent amount of screen time. They end up traveling to New York for a bit, my hometown, so I was incredibly excited (still sour about not getting the Keions). I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though.</br>  <br>Which Raibu besides Honoka got a lot of screentime?</br>  <br> I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though. <br>How long have you been here on 4chan? We literally had a thread full of spoilers(two in fact) on release day.</br></br>  <br>It was mostly even if you ask me. Hanayo obviously gets a lot of time to whine or shout out that there's a problem. Nico got a lot of time. Rin, too. Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time. They know how much people love their favorite characters so they try to give every love live a chance.</br>  <br>I'm just not an asshole. Doesn't mean I'm exactly new. It's also possible that some people have managed to avoid them.</br>  <br> You failed to answer my question. <br>Dude, in the two threads I mentioned practically everyone was *asking* for spoilers. I'll even link to them if you want. And besides, from the way you posted, it appeared you were unaware of the release day threads.</br></br>  <br>I hope Umi got alot of screentime too.</br>  Just got this today. Way bigger than I expected.  <br>No, I haven't been on /a/ since I've been in Japan. I actually saw the movie on release, it's just that I haven't been home until today.<br><br> 4 years </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also, you're on 4chan. People generally don't care about being spoiled here unless they're new or frequent sites like ANN or Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Not him but you can search for spoiler on the internet.</br>  <br> Way bigger than I expected. </br>  <br> Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time <br>Good thing I'm not going to bother seeing the movie then. Worst girl has already ruined it.</br></br>  <br> Rin Hanayo Honoka and Rin <br>Jeez, all my least favorites too.</br></br>  <br>Honoka is the catalyst of LL's story so no wonder she gets the most screen time.</br>  I wanted to fucking punch Honoka like 90% of the show.    <br>So about that  Akiba Dome,  I hope things turn out like the movie for the 6th Live.</br>  This place needs better bird  Postin' more bird     "Hey anon you should check out Love Live. Cute girls being cute, dancing and music, its a lot of fun"     Fuck you Wumbo    I come back after a couple hours and there's no Symphogear thread? For shame.  It needs to get some sleep  Бефстроганов  <br> Dude... <br> What? </br></br>  Why is Kirika so best?  <br> Translator's note: Бефстроганов means beef stroganoff. </br>  Just in time, I was looking for a Symphogear thread.<br><br>I spent the passed 2 weeks marathoning Symphogear from beginning up till where its at now.<br><br>I have never seen such a medicore anime original screenplay in my life. Nothing was really bad about it but nothing was good. It was predictable as shit from beginning to end.<br><br>Asspulls everywhere<br><br> remember when swan songs were suppose to kill the user <br> characters dying in the final fight of the first series to be brought back to life by the power of friendship. <br><br>2nd series<br><br> not fucking up that scientist in any of the 10000 chances they had. <br> using the same asspull to beat the final boss monster twice. <br> most conflicts CAN actually be avoided by just TALKING it out. <br><br>I can go on with this shit. Symphogear was the most bland anime i've ever watched. What do people see in it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The 2nd song title is Classroom Keyholder( keychain)  <br>Read keywords.</br>  Zerker Hibiki when?  <br>Fun.</br>  <br>Friday.</br>  <br>It's fun</br>  <br>Symphogear isn't about the plot. It's about the songs and playing classic magical girl and mecha tropes completely straight for fun.</br>  <br>If you find it bland, stop watching. You are only punishing yourself by watching it.</br>  <br> Cute <br> Chunni <br> DESS DESS DESS </br></br></br>  <br>It's boring DESS!</br>  <br><br>Believe me I want to, but I'm so deep in already. I just fucking wish they would take some risks. We know these new magic bitches are going to join them eventually so why not just cut the bullshit and do it.<br><br>I'm thinking characters are going to die soon because there are starting to be too many.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>brown when</br></br></br>  <br>And that's just from one episode. Can't forget all her other moments.</br>  <br>Kirika has been a best for a while. I'm just glad the most recent episode made more people see the light of DESS.</br>  <br>I wonder if the 2nd song will be CD only. If Chris'll sing it in the show at some point then we're still gonna get more SoL.</br>  <br>I want to like her, I really, really do. She's adorable and I have a weakness for scythe-wielders and witch hats and ridiculous shoulder things<br><br>But her singing voice is so goddamn grating, I can't stand it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Preferable image?</br></br>  <br> 392x341 <br>step it up</br></br>  Not even Haruto wavered as much as Hibiki does.<br> Not to say I don't like Hibiki <br> I just like Haruto. </br></br>  <br><br>This <br>Google Genjuuro's Angels, you'll find them there.</br></br></br>  <br> swan songs were suppose to kill the user </br>  <br><br>To be fair, the show could do a better job to explain this point, why it killed Kanade, why it almost killed Tsubasa, why it did not kill them in the final episode, etc.<br>Reading additional material should not be mandatory to understand key points of the show, they should solely serve as supplementary material, the show should explain all important points itself clearly.</br></br></br>  <br>It killed Kanade because Fine is a fucking whore who deserves to bleed out slowly in a ditch, unloved and forgotten<br><br> I'm not bitter </br></br></br>  <br>The lolibasa flashback was enough to understand.</br>  <br><br>FIne withheld Linker from her, right, but Kanade knew that, didn't she?</br></br>  <br><br>What episode was that again?</br></br>  <br>Four, I think.</br>  I just watched episode 3 of GX today, Three of the gears are broken, Hibiki has lost her determination to fist and they're only 3 episodes in. How damn bad are things going to get for the gears before the end?  <br>I'd think it would be pretty hard to not know a drug you have to inject into your fucking neck was being withheld, but Fine still withheld it knowing it would lead to Kanade's eventual death.<br><br>I do, admittedly, need to rewatch S1, but unless I'm failing to remember Ryoko/Fine explicitly stating otherwise, I cannot believe Fine withheld the LiNKER from Kanade with any goal other than it eventually killing her.</br></br></br>  <br>DMJii are bound to get injured, unfortunately.</br>  <br>Theoretically all six Gear users are out of commission at the moment. Three are broken, Gungnir is mysteriously refusing to activate, and Shul Shagana and Igalima are killing their users. Shit's pretty whack right now.<br><br> And it'll only get worse in episode 7 </br></br></br>  <br>Just let Genjuuro get his hands on a complete relic and all problems will be instantly trivialized.</br>  Everything will be Fine. Carol just need to be bullied a bit.  <br>Things are only going to get worse for them. I understand now why Nana was bedridden for a week after reading the script and trying to come up with the lyrics for Exterminate</br>  <br><br>The one that told Kanade's story?<br>Because that's pretty useless for understanding how the swan song works.</br></br></br>  As a European and with the recent crisis this actually worries me.  <br>But she wasn't, it just took her a week to finish it. Kaneko was bedridden for three weeks after finishing the script.</br>  <br>If you're talking about the superlolibasa appearance that was midway through ep 11</br>  <br>I'm still punching myself for not realizing how great she and Shirabe were until now. Going to go order their CDs from G now. I'm definitely getting their new ones once they come out.<br><br>Kirika's transformation is still my favorite from GX so far.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Unless it's so short that I jumped over it it's not.</br></br>  <br> Kanade needs to pump herself full of linker to work <br> Tsubasa is a natural symphogenius <br>Combine that with the fact that "swan song" is a retarded mistranslation, and it's pretty clear what happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Blame Greece.</br>  <br>It is super short, like maybe 5 seconds? I just checked and its at 13 minutes in.</br>  <br>I know your feeling.</br>  <br>Fucking Greece.</br>  <br><br>This? All it talks about is the Aufwachen form that awakened Fine, nothing about the Supreme Song there.</br></br>  <br>They're mediocre individually, especially Shirabe back in G, but they're pretty damn great as a pair.</br>  After watching the beef stroganoff scene and the other school scenes, I kind of wish there was SoL spinoff.  <br>I just want a full episode dedicated to a training arc while cantonese songs play in the background.</br>  <br>I want to kidnap five year old loli Tsubasa and buy her sweets and watch disney movies with her, and then tuck her into bed.</br>  <br>She claimed LiNKER would interfere with the Nehushtan experiment but that could easily have been bullshit. Who's gonna question Sakurai Ryouko when she starts throwing technobabble around?</br>    <br>The Persians had the right idea.<br>Burn Greece down.</br></br>  <br>What would be her favourite Disney film? My money is on either Lion King or Mulan</br>  Why does everyone have abandonment issues?  <br> I kind of wish there was SoL spinoff. <br><br>Well, it'd have to be a prequel because  those 3 girls are going to die in episode 7 </br></br></br>   IT'S FINALLY TIME <br> Non-H for now </br>  <br>Not okay anon<br><br>not okay</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, with the A.Noise in play it's dubious if even a complete relic would be able to save them. Remember, they're capable of decomposing any matter, not just Symphogears, and that means full relics are fair game. Nehushtan's regenerative properties might have been able to resist it, but it's dust now.<br><br>Until they have a countermeasure developed with Dansleif, they're fucked no matter what else they scrounge up.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's true because in season 2 FIS tried to activate Nephilim by collecting main trio's Phonic Gain through fighting, but failed due to they were using LiNKER.</br>  <br>  Elaborate </br>  <br> Non-H <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br><br> http://www.toranoana.jp/mailorder/c<wbr>ot/m_pagekit/reserve/cm88/genre/384<wbr>7.html</wbr></wbr> <br> I'm watching everywhere I can for Symphogear doujins, 2 non H went up since I checked last <br> I'm the guy who keeps talking about scanning things/scanned a few things, so I'll be buying two copies of everything I get. </br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm thinking characters are going to die soon because there are starting to be too many. <br>You don't know about Nanoha and Dog Days. do you?<br>Symphogear's cast isn't that bloated compared to those shows</br></br></br>  <br>I think the dolls are definitely going to die. Not sure about Carol and Elfnein though.</br>  <br> graced by Nana dubs <br>Based anon's scanning efforts approved even by Nana.<br><br> That website is atrocious, why can't the japs into web design? </br></br></br></br>  <br> HER NAME WAS YUMI ITABA<br>SHE LIKED BEEF STROGANOFF</br> </br>  <br> Based anon's scanning efforts approved even by Nana. <br>Fuck yeah.<br><br> &gt;That website is atrocious <br> It took me forever to get used to it, and I'm still having difficulties like 2 years later. At least it's reliable. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read that as "Yummy Itaba", and in case you didn't know, "Itaba" means "kitchen" or "chef".</br>  Bad guys are better than good guys this season.   H&amp;D is out   <br> attack cards aren't translated <br> one line of dialogue is skipped too </br></br>   Reading the manga <br>I see that these two were already a thing even before all the shit with noise happened.</br>  <br>Attack cards are just cool. The translations don't ever make sense anyways, so it's not a huge loss. Did they put the pronunciation there at least?</br>  <br>Wait really? I haven't watched it yet, just checked if they're out.<br><br>Come the fuck on it's almost a week after comeme.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, nothing.<br><br>Apparently there was some miscommunication and a proofread file was misplaced or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Sorry folks, had a bit of a delay because I had to go to the doctors/rest up a bit because I may have a hernia in my lower right abdomen, which hopefully isn’t the case. <br><br> Unfortunately I’m stuck in bed typing this using a ps1 controller and an on screen keyboard so I wasn’t able to typeset the attack cards this week, which were the only signs in the episode. </br></br></br>  The AutoScorers and Carol need the Symphogear's song for power or something, don't they?<br><br>They're always commenting on the strength of the song and goading Hibiki to fight</br></br>  <br>As demonstrated in Ep2, they need the Geahs active before they can break them.</br>  <br><br>What's the point in breaking the geahs anyway?<br>Is it some extreme case of bullying?</br></br></br>  <br> before they can break them <br>Oh, fucking duh.<br>I still wonder if there's any relevance to them commenting on the strength of the songs or not</br></br></br>  <br> Comeme <br>Implying Commie subs aren't just as viable for this show as H&amp;D if not more.<br>No, I don't expect a response. I know full well that we have H&amp;D staff in the thread. Just don't shitpost other releases when there is no basis for it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Carol's endgame involves a song that will destroy the world, so there's probably more to it than we know of.<br><br><br>How else is she going to make them resort to Dansleif?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They mistyped the second song title. It's "After School Keyholder".</br>  <br>Childhood friends since elementary school.</br>  <br>That's an awfully early time to get a girlfriend.</br>  Reason why they made a lot of beef stroganoff.  If they made a Symphogear  live-action  movie, featuring  all the seiyuu as their roles , would you watch it?  <br>Gonna require lots of camera angles to get Y.Aoi in the picture.</br>  <br> they give her extra high heels so she can be seen <br>   I can't fight in these! <br>   stomp <br>   Aoi drops off the screen </br></br></br></br>  <br>Flashback when.</br>  <br>10/10 fund it.</br>  <br>No, unless I want to kill myself.  I won't be able to stop myself from puking and laughing at the same time. </br>  Is it swan song, superb song or something else?<br>What the hell is a zesshou?</br>  <br>Superb Song.</br>  <br><br> Fucking hell yes I would </br></br>  <br><br>I just hope there is some logic this time.<br><br>S2 was fun and all, but plot completely fell apart in the second half.</br></br></br></br>  Wannabe Sakimori Maria.  Can't kirika and shirabe just give their relics to tsubase and chris?  Does it worth it /a/?  <br>They're not compatible with Shul Shagana or Igalima, so that'd just leave everyone worse off.</br>  <br>No, because geah users only sync with specific geahs. Maria being able to use two is  a miracle .</br>  <br>So long as it's Blue, yes.</br>  <br>Phonic Gain.</br>  <br> I can't remember the chant </br>  <br><br>Just imagine what her tongue is doing inside his throat right now.</br></br>  <br>It's SPARB SONGU.<br><br><br>If she had an album that was just making fun of the listener in her sexy old lady voice, I would buy 10 copies.</br></br></br></br>   there are people who don't watch each release of each episode   Did you know that Ogawa-san is the MC?  <br>Ogawa-san will save Hibiki.<br>Genjuro will save everybody else.<br> Carol will not be saved. </br></br></br>  When does this happen? Just finished G and didn't find it.  <br>It didn't, it's a BD bonus.</br>  <br>He's actually in every scene?<br>Sasuga.</br></br>  No more singing, talking or understanding now.<br>Berserker Hibiki soon.</br>  <br> Berserker Hibiki soon. <br>CORRUPT<br>GUNGNIR</br></br></br>  <br>No understanding, only murder</br>  <br>Nah, it's gonna go like this:<br>2nd verse of G-beat → family drama → Berserker Hibiki → Love and friendship → Little Miracle.</br></br>  So she has the face of a MILF but the body of a loli?<br><br>Sometimes I just don't get Japan's smelly stinky shit taste in aesthetics.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you she is great. Best girl of the season.</br>  <br>THAT'S the thing you have a problem with?<br><br><br> body of a loli <br>She has literally supermodel long legs, and slender body with adult proportions. That's no body of a loli, or even an average mid teen.</br></br></br></br></br>   face of a milf <br>all I see is Typical Anime Girl Look</br>  <br><br>Why do you think people are hating on anime design since it first appeared?</br></br>  <br> A-1 removes even her pantyshot because DON'T SEXUALIZE THE LOLI bullshit <br>Once again, they did what they always do.</br></br>  So the morale of this story is that if you want a cute girl who will follow you around and willingly make you food, all you have to do it kidnap one, right? Oh, and evil space octopussies are evil.  <br>But before that, and more importantly, you must be attractive.<br><br>Remember, never be not attractive.</br></br></br>  Clearly you have to have a mech suit.  <br>And an energy weapon.</br>  There's no reason to be weaponizing tropes against this show. Relative to the industry standard, this was an inspired gem in several ways.   on episode 8 <br> literally do not care about any of these characters <br> story is fucking Tarzan <br><br>I can't believe this was going to get a second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was off to a good start, but it started going downhill around episode 3 and didn't stop.</br>  <br>I think the more Ledo became your typical average awkward MC the more everything went to shit.<br>Oh and the "no dont kill them even though they may kill us all cause thats inhuman" bullshit</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he was too much of a moralfag for someone who was supposed to be indoctrinated by a eugenics war-orientated society. And I couldn't make it to the end, but don't they basically end up resettling on earth giving up all their technology in the process and dooming humanity to a meager existence as roaming scavengers until the sun dies?</br>  <br><br>so sad it didnt get 2nd season<br>was such a good Sci-Fi and really interesting world building</br></br></br>  <br>It was fine if you aren't from /pol/.</br>  <br>How would you have done it better?<br><br>I thought the "peaceful, primitive" life angle was played up a teeny little bit too sappy. There were at least a couple large plotholes that had to be glazed over towards the end, primarily the irrelevance of MC and feMC. And I felt that Chamber's development was rushed.<br><br>Those things aside... how can you complain? This blows Chaika and the like to Avalon and back. This was on part with SnW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For one I would have made Ledo more hostile. Not necessarily violent, but not nearly as passive. When you've been bred for war and lived your life doing nothing but combat, why would you bow so easily to a bunch of primitives when you have a giant war machine that could kill them just by blinking? Plus the pirate leaders doing the team rocket blastoff really set the tone for the rest of the series as something that would be lighthearted when I was looking for something a bit gritter. Not grimdark, but something different than the typical anime "let's all be friends and forgive each other" bullshit.</br>  <br>I'm not from /pol/ and it wasnt fine.</br>  <br> I'm not from /pol/ <br>Homofaggot detected</br></br>  <br>Literally what is wrong with you.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much this. <br><br>By the time I finally got to the second OVA, I had to keep pausing and coming back later because it was so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you not know what a fucking question mark is.</br>  <br>It's a joke, also known as a meme.</br>  I'd take language samples from her all day long if you know what I mean  No, is just a reminder that brown girls are the best.  <br> evil space octopussies are people <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>No, evil space octopuses are humans too</br>  <br>But when the MC vaporized all those pirates was the best scene in the entire series.</br>  <br>And I don't disagree with that</br>  REMOVE HIDEAUZE  The main morale of the show is to hire H-artists for character design over the normal ones.  <br>Truly a lesson all studios should take to heart</br>  <br>The fleet really coddled those fucking pirates beyond all reason.</br>  <br>Maybe they were the descendants of Sweden</br>    <br><br>It saddens me that more anime shows or even manga don't take up oceanic sci-fi settings like Gargantia. It was the reason why I was drawn to the show in the first place. It reminded me of Chrono Cross, which has my favorite setting in any video game ever (futuristic archipelagos).</br></br>  <br> Oh, and evil space octopussies are evil. <br>So I take it you didn't finish?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Why don't anime studios hire people like Hisashi and Hanaharu Naruko more often?<br><br>Their designs are god-tier. <br><br>What I would give for an anime with character designs by Tohzai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How hard would you fuck Melty?  <br>Would over-populate gargantia.</br>    For people saying that ledo should be more hostile, I'm pretty sure the target audience was younger groups. Also it wouldn't match the theme of the show.  <br>Just imagine an anime with Napata designs. Just imagine it.</br>  <br>Such a boner-inducing display of overwhelming firepower. I could only call it god-like.</br>  <br>Pelvis Destruction</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure the target audience was younger groups. <br>I can see that now, but when I started watching this, I went in expecting a reimaged Battlestar Galactica vibe sorta, so you can imagine my surprise and disappointment when I got a Galactica 1980 vibe instead.</br></br>  <br>Enough to make a new fleet</br>        <br>Says the mass produced squid fodder</br>  <br>I really think that they went with him because someone said "We want the audience to have an erection the entire time they're watching the show."</br>  <br>It stands to reason that h-artists are some of the best around at drawing people, since everything they do depends on their ability to draw them well.</br>  <br> since everything they do depends on their ability to draw them well. <br>Well, not necessarily. What you said obviously doesn't apply to people like Raita or Asanagi. <br><br>I think it would be more accurate to say that everything they do depends on their ability to draw people as attractive and appealing as possible. <br><br>H-artists, of course, go about doing this in different ways. Some are more niche and draw people in ways that appeal to certain fetishists, the the way Raita does. <br><br>On the other hand, people like Tohzai and Napata appeal to a more generalized crowd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> morale </br></br>  <br>Sorry, had too much Total War.</br>  <br>Oh nice, somebody adapted the old Avatar copypasta to Gargantia.</br>  <br><br>You forgot to give her butt a nice tap.</br></br>  <br> this guy is going to be genos in opm <br>That should be fun.</br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  Gargantia was garbage and a disappointment, Im glad the S2 got canned<br><br> b-but butcher was involved! <br>Still garbage. See also: Aldnoah</br></br></br>  <br>I thought they were good because they don't really have strict deadlines the way regular mangaka have. Also they seem to focus mostly on the cover, I can't count how many times I have seen an awesome cover only for it to have cheaply drawn content where it's hard to make out the details.</br>  <br>Evidently she suffers fron Stockholm syndrom</br>  Evidently there was not enough senmetsu in the entire series, that and the character designs too, however I feel that those contributing fan artist got shafted a bit  <br>Well it worked.<br><br>They senmetsu'd my dick.</br></br></br>    <br>If pinon wasnt so stupid he could have taped that ass.</br>   draw a pokemon <br> call it a girl </br>  Why is Chiyo so cute?  <br>I wanna  hagu  this semen demon</br>  What happens when she evolves?  <br>Her ribbons turn blue</br>  <br>Chiyo isn't sexual, though.</br>   yfw all of her VA's role this season   <br>That's her shiny form. <br><br>Something much worse happens when she evolves</br></br></br>  <br><br> Blue ribbons <br>STOP</br></br></br>  Chiyo is best girl all around, while also having best VA   You will never give your food to Chiyo   <br>It can't be stopped.<br><br>No more than man can stop the march of time</br></br></br>    <br><br>I said STOP</br></br>    Is it just one nitwit forcing the blue-ribbons Chiyo nonsense?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>you got us anon<br>ops, me*</br></br>  <br>She's going to gain weight again.</br>  This is Ermyer.

It reached the peak with Yama no Susume. Maybe it'll happen again if they make another mountain climbing anime.  <br><br>The bible is a gateway light novel of the worst kind</br></br>  The golden year of 2022, that year we got Kizumonogatari, Haruhi season 3, Tsukihime by ufotable, Umineko by Madhouse, Muv Luv Alternative, Madoka Magica: Revival and Berserk X Idolm@ster.<br>Contrarians might say 23' but Spice &amp; Wolf 3 and Rebuild of Eva 5 are just drops in the bucket.<br>I'm so glad those crazy Otaku had that coup back in 21' after the dark age of the "sexy anime ban".</br></br>  <br>Mid-80s to mid-00s. Might just be me, though. I feel like I grew out of anime a few years back, and am trying to force myself to stay in it.</br>  <br><br>T H I S<br><br>before having lolis was obligatory<br><br>not that lolis are a bad thing, but nothing should be overused.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>4Head</br>  Before Evangelion was released and the entire medium became otaku pandering trash.  After Haruhi invented moe.  Before Speed Racer was released and the entire medium became otaku pandering trash.  <br>Anime is by necessity an otaku pandering genre, and has been for decades before K-On. To watch anime past childhood is to be an otaku, and so obviously anime is going to be targeted to either children or otaku. <br><br>I guess you're using "otaku-pandering" as a synonym for moe, but anime has been connected to otaku subculture for most of its existence, and the fact that a lot of the industry has shifted to pandering to a different subset of otaku doesn't change that.</br></br></br>  <br>ITT: "Back in my day..."</br>  <br>It's funny because the 80s were all about the rise of otaku subculture and anime aimed for them.</br>  <br>trips don't lie</br>  <br> &gt;Anime is by necessity an otaku pandering genre, and has been for decades  <br><br>THIS. It's always been "otaku pandering" and despite what some people believe "moe" is not a new thing.</br></br></br>  <br>When Keit-Ai aired.</br>  Mid 80's to late 90's. That is when anime came to murrica and started to become popular. If you were lucky in the 80's you could find it on TV. In the 90's we only had Saturday anime on sci fi or if you went to suncoast to buy a VHS tape.  <br>he's probably Best Coast.</br>  <br> you went to suncoast to buy a VHS tape <br><br>I'm amazed by the number of people who's pre-Toonami anime experience in the 90s was getting their parents to drive them to a Suncoast. The closest one to me was 2 hours away, and it's how I kept up with Tenchi, Eva, and DBZ in those days. That shit was like finding a treasure. <br><br>Something about how readily available anime is online sort of makes it less special. Finding it was half the experience for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does Augustus have to do with the bible?</br>  <br>Lucky Star invented moe though</br>  1945, before the white devil corrupted the Yamato spirit.  <br><br> implying we're not living in the golden age of anime <br><br>Naruto is the DBZ of this generation<br>One Piece is the Legend of Galactic Heroes of this generation<br>Jojo is the Hokuto no Ken of this generation<br>Sword Art Online is the Rurouni Kenshin of this generation<br>Kiwaguro no Brynhildr is the Akira of this generation<br>Madoka is the Evangelion of this generation<br>Attack on Titan is the Berserk of this generation<br>and Kill La Kill is the Cowboy Bebop of this generation.<br> <br> <br>They're the same tiers, anyone that disagrees is just nostalgia-fagging</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just went there and read the covers, and hoped i didn't get a shit anime. I found alot of good ones, and a shitload of terrible ones. I did buy all the tenchi because i loved it. This one guy at the counter said i should buy master of mosquiton and i did, and i loved it. I miss the old days of going to that place. Having it all over the internet kind of ruins the experience of finding something new.</br>  2007 when DMC aka Dante's Peak aired.  <br><br>you guys are hilarious.</br></br>  Bullshit though the whole "the industry was always better five years before the current date" thing is, I think there actually is a slump at the moment on the animation side of things. I mean, perhaps I'm just not paying enough attention, but I don't really see younger animators putting out the sort of stuff that today's more established/respected animators were putting out twenty years ago.  <br>JoJo is the Hokuto no Ken of five years after Hokuto no Ken</br>  <br> &gt;They're the same tiers, anyone that disagrees is just nostalgia-fagging <br><br>But..I like nostalgia-fagging</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd blame moeshit but the larger issue is that companies will straight up outsource shit to koreans or use 3d models instead of drawn stuff. This isn't always bad (see Initial D) but it's happeing more than it needs to. Same for moeshit, I love muh lolis and muh waifus but we're at a point where there's so much of it and most of it is shit/noise.</br></br>  <br> 1995-1998 <br><br>This. Mid to late nineties were when most of "cultural phenomenon" level hits came out.</br></br></br>  <br>How the hell is Kill La Kill the Cowboy Bebop of this generation?</br>  <br><br><br>Except K-On! invented moe you fucking retards</br></br></br>  <br><br>sure buddy</br></br>  <br>school days was the last good anime, last thing i watched was master of martial hearts hoping that it will be as good, but it wasnt, just mediocore</br>  When Walt Disney created Astro Shota  Whenever the industry stopped using hand drawn animation  Anime peaked with Steins Gate.  It peaks a lot. Every now and then it reaches the true high end and then drops a bit. Maybe a lot. And then comes back to the peak.<br><br>Last time it peaked was March 11th, 2011. It is hard to predict when the next peak is. This and last season have been pretty good so far but most of the best shows recently have been adaptions. We need some strong original to really push it up to greatness.</br></br>  <br>you're a fucking idiot. k-on came out in 09 , everyone knows moe was invented this year.</br>  Anime (as well as magna and all of Japanese culture) peaked with Boku No Pico.<br><br> inb4 stale gag </br></br>  <br>What if Darude-Sandstorm was in the OST of Boku no Pico</br>  <br><br>then it would be 200% better<br><br>not as good as 009 soundsystem's "dreamscape" though<br><br>just playing in the background, quiet enough where you can hear the dialogue but loud enough to remind you that it's there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Rick Astley dubbed Pico<br>It would be a 420/69 anime</br></br></br>  When my favourite anime aired.  <br><br>Overrated schlock. That's about it though.</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying anime as a whole's gone down, but I'm not seeing anyone really stepping up to become the star animator of the next decade or anything. I mean, the most talked-about young animator is an imported loudmouth who still can't quite fill the previous generation's shoes.</br>  <br> school days <br> good <br><br>As expected of Evafags. <br>Shining example of shit taste for 20 years.</br></br></br></br></br>  The most recent peak was in 2011. If you mean the medium as a whole, which is a rather silly exercise, I would venture to say around the mid to late 90s.  1988 before western pandering of shows like Eva took over and have forced the current anime industry down our throats.  <br> hating on school days <br>how new can you be? back to mal forums with you, you summerfag</br></br>  Madoka.  The first half of the 2000s.  2014  <br> Rurouni Kenshin - SAO <br> KLK - Bebop </br></br>  <br> Sword Art Online is the Rurouni Kenshin of this generation </br>  <br>What the fuck drugs are you on and where the fuck do I get them?</br>  <br><br><br>No, I'm pretty sure Moe showed up in Simpsons first.</br></br></br>  <br> summerfag <br><br>I'm here all year long, shittaster. <br>And probably been watching anime for as long as twice your life time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Berserk=SnK <br><br>This is objectively incorrect. SnK=Battlestar Galatica. Everyone is a cylon/titan.</br></br></br>  <br>1985-1998</br>  <br><br>Debatable. The examples of moe came well before that. The term seems to have come up at the same relative time as The Simpsons.</br></br>  <br><br>100% Right</br></br>  The time when it made Penises peek  <br>i bet your first anime was naruto</br>  <br>It was Disney back in the 30's</br>  <br>My first TV anime was Lupin 3rd and Jarinko Chie, both notorious for rebroadcasting in Osaka.<br>My first theatrical anime was Dr Slump movie in 81.<br><br>Try harder, kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf how'd you know???</br>  <br><br>The term was invented by Moe Howard in 1897</br></br>  <br>We're all prophets here anon</br>  /a/ peaked with Code Geass  <br>It hasn't yet.</br>  <br>no one asked about your CV, make your own site where you can write your blogs</br>  <br>nice blog. subscribed</br>  <br>He's right you know</br>  <br>how the fuck old are you anon?</br>  <br><br> Non-capitalized  <br> No periods <br><br>So, you figured you've been told and resorted to samefagging?<br>And you call someone else summerfag?<br><br>Wow.<br><br>Remember, I didn't call you a newfag.

And I don't hate Anno, I don't even hate Eva. <br>In fact I think Anno is one of the best animators in the field.<br><br>I just find Evafags annoying and their taste in anime complete shit.

R2 was a load of bullshit that ruined the entire series, but I can't say some of my best online memories were watching it with /a/<br><br>Which also confirms my view in my opinion that 2005-2007 were 4chans peak years with R2 being the last hurrah before this community went to complete shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i am proven wrong? <br><br> Proven wrong assuming you were talking to a newfag  <br> Proven wrong assuming listed anime were moeshit <br><br>You haven't gotten a SINGLE fact right, and you keep shitposting like a fucking retard. <br>Go kill yourself, I'll help you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>9/10</br>  <br>2007/8 really was the tipping point for /a/. Ever since then, 4chan got way too popular, resulting in /a/ becoming more and more fragmented.</br>  <br>You should probably watch the shit before you open your mouth, or you just come off completely ignorant.</br>  <br>these animes are shit and youre a newfag for liking them, you didnt prove anything</br>  <br>cant tell if b8 or shit taste</br>  <br>Uchouten Kazoku is based on a novel (not light novel) that mixes youkai and mystery, and it's more or less scenery porn of Kyoto.<br>Sunred doesn't even have a single cute female, it's all monsters, villains, and super heroes in semi-retirement.

Old Touma and Egypt arc when</br>  <br> And came back riding a meteor </br>  <br>High Priest &gt; Kars</br>   “It isn’t like you. It isn’t like you at all. Kamijou Touma, did all of this logical fighting come from that girl’s knowledge? Are you being dragged along by her way of thinking? If so, I can understand why this has been so uninteresting.”  <br> “You ran away as soon as you saw me? Boring. You fled all throughout Academy City? Oh, how boring. Just when it seems I’ve caught up, you use compressed gas cylinders to create magma? Oh! How! Boring!! All of this has been a complete waste of time!! Think how I have to feel going along with it all! I’ve been waiting this whole time for you to use Imagine Breaker against me just once!! To be honest, the one thing that was most like you was the courageous dive from the rooftop at the very beginning! Everything has been so boring ever since that girl showed up!! You’ve shrunk down and curled up! You’ve only been using petty tricks to reduce the amount of damage!!!!!”  <br> “You are letting that boring girl drag you around and it is just sad. You are not so small a ‘human’ that you should be contained here.”  <br> “If that girl is keeping you from using your right hand, that is a distinct negative.”  <br> “If that girl is keeping you from saying you will destroy my illusions, then she is already tripping you up.”  <br> “I simply cannot understand it myself, but is it that hard to push someone aside? I would think it is plain as day that girl is nothing but a burden to you. I can’t think of any reason to have kept her with you all this time.” <br> “I can understand fleeing the school with her and I can understand keeping her with you until I lost sight of you. But why after that? If you had thrown her out and had her slip into the crowds, you would have been freed from that annoyance, so why did you keep her with you?” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  part 3  <br><br> “Take that grimoire library for example. The knowledge of those 103,000 grimoires might have been helpful. And Othinus might have been able to give you some accurate advice from the viewpoint of a Magic God. Then you would have been able to clench your right fist and challenge me to a battle focused on Imagine Breaker. That would be the proper way of doing this, but it all fell apart thanks to that girl. What do you think about this situation?”  <br> &gt;“Heh heh. Argue from a position of emotion or willpower all you want. It does not change the fact that she was, in fact, a burden. What does that girl understand of magic? Not to mention of the territory known as a Magic God. What use is someone who has fallen so hopelessly behind? Enough pretending, Kamijou Touma. You were honestly growing sick of having to lower the conversation to her level, weren’t you?”  <br><br>Hot damn. Mikoto was literally destroyed. Annihilated. BTFO is short to describe it.<br><br>Based High Priest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oho hoi~</br></br></br>  <br>Uho hoi</br>  <br>More like she'll now be aware of what she's facing and improve to help the Touman.</br>  Uho hoi~  All the shit mikoto has done this volume and only reasons for why it is good that she is there is because her ignorance allows him to pretend the situation isn't as hopeless as it really is plus protecting girls gives him strength. I guess that clarifies that he really is still scared shitless of magic gods and used mikoto tough it out.<br><br> all high priest wanted was for touma to give him a moralfag speech and punch him in the face OT style </br></br>   “You are letting that boring girl drag you around and it is just sad. You are not so small a ‘human’ that you should be contained here.”  <br><br>AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHA</br></br>  <br> so why did you keep her with you?” <br><br>I found this strange as well.<br>Why would Touma keep Mikoto with him? Wouldn't it be better to leave her somewhere else and continue away from High Priest? Touma didn't really answer that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not getting stronger than she currently is no matter what, so too bad for her.</br>  <br>Honestly, this volume is just proving that the "Kamijou Touma Magic God Fan Club" jokes were actually completely correct.</br>  <br>Is she going to learn magic because if not she isn't going to be aware of shit and even if there were gods left she wouldn't be able to get to their or even god's right seat level without help.</br>   If she had fallen behind, then she had to gather her strength and move forward more than anyone else. The greater her debt, the more she had to build up speed and catch up as soon as possible. Wasn’t that all this was?  <br>Well, that confirms it.</br>  <br> Is she going to learn magic <br><br>She can't.<br>That would kill her. She might still learn how it works, but using it would be lethal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, isn't he just evading the question?</br>  <br>Confirms what</br>  Does the imaginary number district work on magic gods?  <br>Yeah it didn't hit me until I already posted, but magic knowledge could help her counter some things.</br>  Is any other Level 5 a match for them?  <br>That she's getting a power-up in the next few novels.</br>   It was no different from seeing a plastic bag on the side of the road and wanting to remove it. <br>Oh, hey, a callback to the Volume 1 Prologue.</br>  <br>That honestly would be so cheap and stupid.</br>  <br>Even a full powered, white wings Accelerator would only do a tiny bit better than Mikoto. And even he would probably get called a burden, too. But maybe not as hard as Mikoto did</br>  <br>N U I T<br>U<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Accelerator, Kakine, and Gunha would all sure as hell be more useful than her.</br>  <br>I doubt even Accelerator with his White Wings would be any threat.<br>Also, Gunha was BTFO by Ollerus when he had impure Magic God powers. <br>Level 5s can't really compare to Magic Gods.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it would, if he really was protecting her that should be the first thing he does. No other escort mission has stopped touma from fighting NT10 is a prime example of that and he never really tested his fist on a MG.</br>  <br>She'll be useless at this point, even with a cheap power up.</br>  <br>It was already hinted in Railgun.<br><br>Connecting her to the Network would grant her a truly ludicrous powerup.</br></br></br>  <br>oh hell no, Not even all of them at once with their most powerful incarnations could stop Fiamma let alone a magic god.</br>  <br>Exterior doesn't exist anymore, and Aleister has plenty of better cards to play than her.</br>   "NT13 HAS MISAKA BEING BTFO BTFO BTFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO"</wbr> <br><br> Mummy-man says some shit but Touma says how it actually is <br><br>Why are shitposters so damn lazy nowadays?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exterior was only needed to hack the Network and force Mikoto to connect to it.<br><br>The only thing Misaka would really need to be able to connect to the Network would be a Testament machine.<br><br>A  "New Testament"  designed specifically for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he rectified it by saying he wouldn't mind having his hand melted just to shut him up. Doesn't mean it didn't happen, retard.</br>  So, guys, where is Mikoto getting BTFO?<br>I'm not seeing it.<br> gets called a burden <br> Touma defends her <br> HP gets literally BTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the "she's going to get a power up soon" crowd is stupid, but it honestly has been foreshadowed, which means it might happen. I agree with your "better cards to play" statement, however, I think his better card is not a single person but a group of people, of which she is part</br>  <br>And High-Priest was saying that just to make him mad?<br>Are you stupid?<br>Brain-damaged?<br>A baka?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aleister is just a silly human who couldn't see Kamisato Kakeru.<br>His keikaku will fall apart soon enough.</br></br>   “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called a burden <br> toumas defense is her being useless gives him strength <br> even misaka doesn't like that answer </br></br></br>  <br>HP was right about almost everything though. You're just a whiteknight faggot like Touma.</br>  <br>If he was just saying to to make him mad he wouldn't have carried on with it after Touma started running again and had left the room, he truly believes Misaka is holding him back</br>  <br>Except all the shitposters were claiming that Touma was the one telling Mikoto to go away, when it's literally the opposite, he wants her to stay.</br>  <br> being useless <br> she literally saved his life <br> if he went full IB on HP he'd probably die, as that was what HP was expecting <br><br>Come the fuck on.<br>Hell, Touma even explained that punching him would be stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Noukan alone and the Kiharas are more important cards than all the level 5s together.<br>Besides, at this point I doubt Aleister can't just produce more Level 5s if he needs.</br></br>  <br>That's why she's holdings him back, trueTouma would've punched him regardless the consequences.</br>  <br>What are the kanji for his name?</br>  <br>Yeah, he wanted her to stay so a magic god could rip her to pieces.</br>   (I’m only a burden to him!!)  <br>okay, no more misaka</br>  <br>And then this happened.<br><br> (I’ll do it.) <br><br> In that case, this was no time to be sitting around worrying. <br><br> (I swear I’ll do it.) <br><br> If she had any complaints and if she had things she wanted to correct… <br><br> (I’ll catch up to him!!) <br><br> She had to start by telling him!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And died horribly.</br>  <br> Just checked the Japanese wiki and it seems that the name of the new character that appears at the end with World Rejector is not Kamisato Takeru but Kamisato Kakeru.  <br>Kanj: 上里翔流(かみさとかける)</br></br>  <br> believing that bullshit when it was misaka who kept trying to confront PH directly  <br>He already hoped on the bike and was running when mikoto appeared.</br></br>  You guys do realize that even if Touma completely agreed with the High Priest he'd never come out and say that, right?  <br><br>This really should've happened way back in the first series.</br></br>  <br>To quote Touma<br> You’re a complete stranger, so quit acting like you know who I am!! </br></br>  If Imagine Breaker is so important to the gods, why did Othinus try to destroy it?  <br>I think it actually did. I know for a fact it happened back in NT 3, she just never had the chance to act on it.</br>  <br>Heh? Even thought they know EVERYTHING about him.</br>  <br>She didn't?<br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Saved him by being a burden. The desire to protect her is what saved him but that isn't what she wants thus she was btfo. She thought she was being helpful but she wasn't and she can't except that she was being helpful by being unhelpful.</br>  <br><br>So Laura is a step before Crowley in the main keikaku. <br><br>This can't end well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread NT9 because clearly you missed major points like Othinus straight up saying she wanted to use it for herself</br>  So what now? A Mikoto training arc?   “Grit your teeth, High Priest. This might ruin my right hand and I might really have to get it amputated at the hospital, but I’ll trade that arm for your face!! Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”  <br><br>ITS HEREEEEE</br></br>  <br>I want to build on this question. I don't quite understand Othinus. Why did she need to put Touma through those million hells to make him commit suicide? I vaguely recall something like "If I kill you, IB will find a new host and it'll be a pain in the ass to hunt it down again" or something, but that doesn't make sense because if Touma killed himself via building jumping, wouldn't that happen anyway?<br><br>Basically why did Othinus keep fucking reviving Touma, what good would it do to keep him alive? Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Two boring filler volumes.</br></br>   Touma trying to rationalize why it is better for misaka to be there instead of index and othi <br> even though he tried to call them as soon as he could </br>  <br>He would've denied himself if he said it out loud, even if it's true.</br>  <br>Man, you guys are really reaching. For the past few weeks it's all been "Touma's going to tell her off, she's going to run off and avoid him forever!"<br><br>When the actual scene is Touma saying he wants her around and Biri deciding to try and be more useful to him and find out more about him. You want to move those goalposts any further or...?</br></br></br>  <br> Kamisato <br><br>"Understands God"? "Admonishes God"?</br></br></br>  <br>AAAAAnd he didn't do it.</br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br>Yes, consciously at least that was the idea that he'd be easiest to use in that manner. Unconsciously she was also putting him through that to have him experience the hell that her life had been and achieve her other goal of having someone who understood her, which is why in the end having got it she brought back Touma's world to how it was</br></br>  <br> everyone on the internet is the same guy </br>  <br> Raildex <br> training <br><br>She'll get tossed aside while the England arc is up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's explained that she put him through what she herself went through as she wandered through endless worlds. She wanted someone to understand what she went through, since it's simply impossible for any living human to comprehend her history.<br><br>I think the last scene before she turned everything back had her admitting she was lying to herself about her motive.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, he's only an flawed, imperfect highschool boy isn't he?</br>  So ultimate 'being like him' turns him into the One who Purifies Gods and Slay Demons ?<br>and misaka's role is the stopper of that ?</br>  <br> England <br>Please more Kanzaki.</br></br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br><br>Maybe Othinus is into femdom. Wouldn't put it past her.<br>I found it pretty hot how she would torture him with the infinite worlds and make him smell her scent from time to time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The One Who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons <br> The One Who Admonishes Gods and Something Something? </br></br>  <br>Please stop injecting your shit fetishes into Index</br>  <br>damn</br>  Man, I have to agree with High Priest, Touma the utterly insane punchaholic is more exciting than Touma the Keikaku Science Man  <br>Well yeah.<br><br>It'd be really dumb.</br></br></br>   “Boring, boring, boring, boring!!!!!! At last, at long last, it looked like the winds were changing, but that girl!! Are you going to run away after all this? How many times have I told you it is only a matter of sooner or later? How long are you going to delay the inevitable!? What happened to Imagine Breaker!? What happened to your right hand!? What happened to the One who Purifies Gods and Slays Demooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn<wbr>nnnsssssssssssssssssssssssssss!?</wbr>   do you feel Touma in this volume is boring ?  <br>It's also because they already planned to ship HP into space. Into that comet to be more precise.</br>  <br>I'm not into scat, though.</br>  <br><br>Kamachi already did it.</br></br>  <br>I disagree honestly. The scene in the WW3 arc where Touma does freaking math to figure out the flight path of a bomber to fake a bombing run on some magicians was really awesome.<br><br>Or the scene where Touma uses heat expansion to disable a terrorist's gun.</br></br></br>  <br> implying punching the magma mummy wouldn't burn off his hand and release the dragons </br>    <br>I find Touma in general boring. But this volume wasn't as bad as usual.</br>  <br><br>I feel Touma is boring for the last 20 volumes. With few good moments here and there.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, yes, PTSD Touma is boring as fuck but you can see more of his flaws in his current self.</br>  <br>Touma always keikaku science man. but in his previous battle he never keep running away like this.</br>   Touma with Kakine <br>The entire city slowly gets destroyed and replaced with dark matter as they fight High Priest.<br> Touma with Accelerator <br>Increasingly ridiculous amounts of fire power until they eventually just chuck High Priest into space, like they did here.<br> Touma with Gunha <br>Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching.</br></br></br></br></br>  What if the entire series is really Touma's keikaku?  <br>That would be awesome. Damn Misaka</br>  <br>What was the most heated danger he faced off against? Innocentius was only 3k degrees C, compared to the possible 6k degrees C of the magma HP ate.</br>  <br>While they were cool Touma's best kind of moments for me will always be stuff like him just running straight at Gabe to run punch her back to Heaven even if it means drowning in the Arctic(or was it Antarctic?) ocean, along with riding a fucking sword thrown by a Saint to punch out a princess of England that has been empowered by the UK, and Archangel Michael</br>  <br>Innocentius is also magic so his hand would negate it.</br>  <br>Probably Fiamma's flame sword.</br>  <br><br>Did he write it in a certain magical index?</br></br>  <br>He's so-so, High Priest was the real selling point of this novel, fucker was even more glorious than Bullshit Master St. Germain</br>  Railgun 78<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!rwxVhajY!TG9wQ<wbr>-HI4QzOy6DtHzZZ8ZhjQrX-Qu842_HD_EuC<wbr>VB8</wbr></wbr></br>   people saying touma running away is good because fist fighting a god is stupid <br>as if any of this was fucking smart.</br>  <br><br>Finally. The only part of the franchise where Mikoto is a good and likeable character.</br></br>  <br>Word.<br>I love High Priest's antics.</br></br>  <br>When will the new chapter come out?</br>  <br>THANKS.<br>Finally Saiai using LN outfit</br></br>  <br>This is before amnesia in Volume 14 and muh feelings in Volume 16, mind you.</br>  <br>Both in the new volume and now the new Railgun, Hanzou's really getting around</br>  <br><br> Did THK forced his existence into the Raildexverse?</br></br>  <br>Wow I hadn't thought of that. God fucking damn it Misaka</br>  <br> Saiai actually have flat chest complex </br>  <br>The High Priest's rant does match up perfectly with /a/ rants about her</br>  So this is your concept of "BTFO"?<br> High Priest shittalked her, Touma told him to shut the fuck up and she realized High Priest was kind of right and decided to improve (which of course won't happen like all the other times Mikoto decided shit).<br> I don't see how this is her getting BTFO.</br></br>  <br>HP had a more viable and logical reason to say Misaka was very unnecessary in this volume.</br>  <br>I disagree, he just told him the obvious, I didn't saw any shittalk in his words.</br>  <br> could've gotten more info on the Dragons <br>Fucking Misaka, High Priest was completely right about you</br></br>  <br>I don't see any blatant over exaggerated shit talk but he was being antagonizing</br>   Naruto reference in my Railgun manga <br>I don't know what think about it.</br>  <br>She's still somewhat rekt since Touma said she was useful because of how useless she was and he had someone to protect, he didn't mention anything about her helping him or the like, it realistically could have been him saving any girl, and Mikoto realized that and was upset by it</br>  <br>Pointing out the obvious about the massive difference in level, knowledge, powers and importance in such a blunt manner is precisely blowing the fuck out of her.<br><br>The truth hurts, doesn't it? It's the same shit.</br></br></br>  <br> fremea massages frenda's boobs <br> those shadow clones <br>7/10 good chapter</br></br></br>  <br>What is BTFO?</br>  <br>it the truth though</br>  What are the chances of High Priest actually being right about imagine breaker? Hasn't everyone else who tried to say what it is ended up being terribly wrong?  <br> Biribiri and Touma Forced Operation</br>  <br>Blow the fuck out</br>  top fucking kek  <br>You realising that you're not a hero, just a trash.</br>  <br>Index is the Naruto of the LNs after all.</br>  Saiai best ITEM  <br><br>You mean the only part of the franchise that is still good.</br></br>  <br> Not liking the LNs </br>  i want in this room  <br>Haters blown the fuck out by Touma.</br>  <br>Is that a hotel rented by Mikoto or a safehouse of Saiai's?</br>  <br>The haters telling everyone to wait for the translation were just retarded, don't worry about it. Mikoto got the farthest thing from BTFO this volume.</br>  <br>some internet cafe</br>  <br> beds in an internet cafe <br>For what purpose</br></br>  <br>For the NEET on the go?</br>  <br>Too bad Mikoto indeed got rekted by HP.</br>  <br>For the nearly homeless and poor tourists<br><br>Source: A cheap tour of Tokyo lodging in net/manga cafes</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine, because HP got rekt right afterwards in more than one way.</br>  Based High Priest telling characters what we all really think about them all along.  <br> we </br>  <br>This. Just because Touma bullshitted a defense that was basically "she helped by being useless" doesn't mean High Priest wasn't right. Nothing's changed. It's still over.</br>  <br>Only by Noukan. Touma getting angry and replying back was exactly what HP wanted to begin with.</br>  <br>And tries to come back by crashing a comet, but gets BTFO by Noukan afterwards. Wow...This volume has a lot of BTFOs.</br>  <br>a lot of Japanese live in internet cafe since their wage not even enough for cheap apartment</br>   calls Othinus a failure of a Magic God even though she became one by becoming a real god, unlike him who became one by failing to rise to the position of Buddah <br> The only failure here is you, High Faggot.</br>  <br>People didn't want him to become Buddha though because politics.</br>  <br> Doesn't change the fact that he failed.</br>  <br>He is a real god though, just because politics tried to bullshit his righteousness and godliness away, doesn't mean he didn't do it</br>  <br>This<br><br>Humans are morons, HP only wanted to save people.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is failure for HP thought</br>  <br> It's still over. <br><br>What's over? I'm not even sure why HP's opinion matters. They're discussing the difference in power in Touma and Misaka's relationship. If Touma is fine with it and Misaka wants to become better and also still wants Touma in her life...why is HP relevant? He has no say in what they do (especially since he's about to get fisted by the new guy).</br></br></br>  <br> He wanted to become a Buddah. Did he become a Buddah? No. He failed.</br>  <br>Still became a wandering "Buddha" nonetheless</br>  <br>He perfectly ok with results so it isn't fail.</br>  <br>But did he become a God? Yes he succeed.</br>  <br>The procedure was correct. The judges were corrupt.</br>   dat Muginos     You would probably be in for quite a shock if you looked into the origins of Othinus who you keep by your side. <br>What does it means?</br>  <br>I prefer Fre myself.</br>  <br> That's not how it works.<br> He accepted that he couldn't become a Buddah and instead choose to become what humans desired him to be. Accepting failure and moving on isn't the same as not failing.<br><br><br> He didn't want to be a "God", he was trying to become a Buddah.<br><br><br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure.<br><br><br> Yeah, something close to a Buddah but not a true Buddah, which is pretty much the same thing Othinus was before the end of NT8, and he mocked her because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's referring to the how Othinus killed herself to become a Magic God by hanging herself</br>  <br>I think he means the stuff like gouging out her eye hanging herself from the tree and shit like that, I'm not familiar with Norse mythology though so there might be more to it but that's the basic idea</br>  <br>She's a viking she probably did some hardcore shit back in her day</br>  <br>Did Othinus ever tell Touma about how she became a Magic God to begin with?</br>  <br>Can you please spell Buddha correctly?</br>  <br>Well since they went for her eye he knows some of it at least, don't think she mentioned hanging herself though</br>  <br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure. <br>You're mixing the physical procedure to become a Buddha/Magic God with the subjective scoring to acquire the title of Buddha.</br></br>  <br>Thor did back in NT 5.</br>  <br><br>She's a man originally, baby!</br></br>  <br> Yeah, sorry. Should have checked how it was spelled.<br><br><br> But being given the title of Buddha is required to become Buddha. It was even mentioned in that chapter that the reason he became a Magic God instead of just becoming a Buddha was because of those shitty judges.<br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HP is a Buddha thought, the corrupt priests didn't give him a title/name so he's a wandering Buddha referred as "High Priest".</br>  <br>Can you point out where to me? Scanning for her name in it didn't give me much</br>  <br>Guys do make the best girls after all</br>  <br> But he isn't a true/complete Buddha, just like Othinus wasn't a true/complete Magic God.<br> I found it weird that he shitted on her for that.</br></br>  <br>someone need to massage Kinuhata chest</br>  <br>Wasn't he calling her a shit for caring too much about her own world or finding someone who understood her rather than giving no fucks like they did?</br>  <br>She and Mikoto can rub each other's chests</br>  <br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble. <br>Those other "Buddhas" either did the procedure incorrectly or gained their status thanks to politics.</br></br>   “If that girl is keeping you from saying you will destroy my illusions, then she is already tripping you up.” <br>So that's why he didn't say it at all this whole volume.</br>  <br>I think the only time he's said it in all of NT is in NT10.</br>  <br>And what a glorious moment that felt like.</br>  Did Kihara doge appear yet?   However, he did not clench his right fist and try to smash the mummy’s face in. The High Priest had already asked if he honestly thought he could save them all with only Imagine Breaker. <br>HP put Touma on those cautious rails to begin with. It's just more of him trying to break Touma through shifting logic.</br>  <br>She's a failure because she didn't realize what it really meant to be a Magic God and instead "wasted" her power on petty things like destroying world. The exact reasoning went:<br> &gt;Othinus was remarkable yet went a bit too far </br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>Raildex has had ninjas since forever.</br>  <br>Sorry I remembered it wrong. In NT 9 There was an exposition by Kamachi, specifically Ch. 8 Pt.4 to which it was said that Kamijou doesn't know anything about Odin's History. Also in NT10, Othinus only mentioned about her eye in the prologue as a part of her ritual to become a Magic God.</br>    Akasaki Chinatsu's angry voice <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>You haven't read Naruto I take it</br>  <br>Tomorrow</br>  so which Seiyu would be perfekt for High Priest  <br>He mainly meant the summons of frogs and shadow clones thing but...<br><br><br>You do know that it did not originate from Naruto right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah right, yeah I was sure he knew about the eye since they went to go fetch it but wasn't sure where it was said she hung herself from a tree and if he knew, thanks</br>  <br>Ninjas? Yeah, but the summoning of a gigantic frog being a ninja power I'm relatively sure isn't a normal association to make with ninjas</br>  <br>High Priest doesn't strike me as someone capable of being deliberately antagonizing. He has never lied and he always speaks what he truly feels, never wearing any masks, or having any hidden motives.<br><br><br>Thor did say this to a dizzy Touma in NT5 after their one-on-one:<br> &gt;“To befit the original meaning of the name, I headed down a certain path. If that girl hadn’t taken such ridiculous measures to gain knowledge even if she had to pull out one of her eyes and hang herself, I could have stood at the top of Gremlin.” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as how he was, appearance-wise, based on Fate's Matou Zouken, I'd say the guy who voiced him.</br>  <br>Houchu Ohtsuka. He'd do the OHO HOIs perfectly.</br>  <br>lol so I was remembering it right? Dang what's wrong with my brain?</br>  <br>He's already Terra's voice.</br>  <br>Jiraiya is an actual historical ninja. Hell, all three of the old guard come from the same Japanese folktale. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>   Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”   So weren't Kamikotofags supposed to be on suicide watch or something? I don't see it.  <br>Sorry, I was mistaken. NT6, not NT5.</br>  <br>Ninjas actually are associated with summoning things thanks to the legend of Jiraiya. Look it up in Kabuki theater and Japanese mythology.</br>  <br>Shit, I forgot about that. Wakamoto's already taken too, so I guess it's Zouken after all.</br>  <br>Kamikotofags aren't even a thing anymore. If there are some who still seriously ship them, I feel sorry for them.</br>  <br>Why? Touma literally just told everyone he likes having her around</br>  <br>What happen if my way is correct and right and yours is not Kamijou-chan?</br>  <br> everybody talking about magic gods <br> lets bring up that shipping wars shit posting </br></br>  <br>Kamijou's path is always right.</br>  <br>Kamikoto is still very much a thing.</br>  <br>It's alright. But Kamijou still didn't know about Odin's history though, so at the time that was said to him, he had no idea what that meant.</br>  <br><br><br>Well shit you showed me I guess, shows what I know</br></br></br>  <br>Would be awesome to see a Human othinius.She was probable quite awesome.<br>The Magic Gods have one Great problem they don´t take anything seriosly enough.<br>Othinius was different thats way i am expecting that next Volume the Magic Gods are freed and Magic god Othinius as their Leader will finally beginn the MG keikaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Touma check a book out from the library if he knew he was facing One Eyed Othinus eventually</br>  <br> I'd rather talk about Naruto than shipping </br>  <br> Magic Gods <br>You do know that only one is left right</br></br>  <br> MG keikaku <br><br>But True Gremlin is just a glorified and ridiculously powerful Touma Fanclub. They only want TouMAN-senpai to notice them.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still the most popular pairing despite what a very vocal minority thinks.</br>  <br>Magic Gods are great because of how little shits they give though</br>  <br>You do know there were a bunch of Magic Gods in that phase Aleister destroyed right?</br>  <br>Yeah no, after seeing how flawed he is, I will reconsider 2 times if he's right or not.</br>  <br>Why check a book out from the library when your roommate IS a library?<br><br><br>Kamisato killed them all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't count if they're not showing up on earth</br>  <br>That I don't know so I can't help you answer that really good question. In fact, why is Touma not doing any research in the occult at all? He could just ask Index, who started to become irrelevant to thanks to this plot hole(is it?)</br>  <br>It's important to remember that Naruto had extremely few original ideas, a good chunk of the abilities and naming came from Japanese Mythology.</br>  <br/>  I know it's just a quibble, but the height scale seems a bit off.<br>Shouldn't Mugino tower over the others?</br>  <br>Either or really, the point is you'd think the guy who's analyzing his enemies on his feet trying to find a weakness, how their power works or the like, if he has prep time would do at least minimal research into them</br>  <br> The ones mentioned were High Priest, Nephythys. Niang Niang, Zombie and Chimera.<br> So far Zombie is kill and we don't know what happened to Chimera. By the end of this volume only Nep will be left.</br></br>  So AccelxMikoto is Endgame OTP?  <br>Poor HP, that Touma died with NT9.</br>  <br>They're all highschool girls, except for Saiai who should be shorter since she was retconned into being 12, so not really</br>  <br><br> that sisterhood by fellow flat chests <br><br>Brings a tear to my eye.</br></br></br></br>  <br>10032xAccel<br>KakinexMikoto</br></br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>So basically Touma is shitting himself inside but because misaka is there he have a reason not to go despair.<br><br>Basically if. misaka wasnt there he would have given up already.</br></br></br>  <br>The only height we got from her was in OT15, and she was wearing heels + leaning forward. I would estimate her to be a few cm shorter than Accelerator (which is 168).</br>  <br>they are not dead just very far away.<br>I kinof see Kamisato as someone importent but also a reason for Othnius to act.</br></br>  <br> HP sees the events of NT9  <br> sees touma fight a god and refuses to give up despite many deaths <br> and he even comes close to punching her <br> HP hopped that could be him one day <br> finally gets his shot and touma lames it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> given up alread <br>He is Touma.<br>silly anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep apparently index and othinus giving magic side advice would only make it seem more hopeless. Misaka seems to think that means anybody ignorant to magic and easy to talk to could take her place. I don't really like his explanation but at least it filled the plot hole of why he is so cool with magic gods now when he was practically pissing himself with fear last volume.</br>  <br>Basically. Mikoto being there allowed him to be more lighthearted and keep him from despair. She doesn't know shit about magic(and obviously doesn't really care too much), so it put him in a good mood.</br>  <br>I mean, NT12 didn't seem like Othinus was making the situation worse but whatever works for Touma I guess</br>  why Touma did not just accept their offer but refuse their reward?  <br>Because they're being little shits and living their lives incorrectly.</br>  <br>Isn't that sort of torture?</br>  Mikoto BTFO.  <br> He was going full-despair till he found out St Germain was fake, though.</br>  <br> why Touma did not just accept their offer <br>HP would've killed him on the spot.<br><br> If that boy were to give in to him, the High Priest was sure to immediately behead him without a second thought. </br></br></br></br>  <br>In NT it wasn't a god so her telling touma that fixed him right up. right now he is certain HP is a god and othinus would probably tell HP is unbeatable or at least that is why he thinks. Even HP said the only threat to full powered magic god was other magic gods.</br>  <br> Because he wanted nothing to do with a bunch of shits who would give absolute power over the world to a normal highschool boy.</br>  <br>He's ptsd Touma after all, I don't think he knows where the moral line is anymore.</br>  <br>He almost got an even better show with dragons, too.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about the scene just before that, where he lost to Hamazura and he was assuming he was about to go challenge a magic god, Othinus only said "wait did you say Germain" after that. I'm saying during that he didn't act like she was making the situation worse and told her to help him out again in the future if he lost his way</br></br>  <br>I have the biggest boner now. Make it happen Fuyukawa.</br>  <br>If Thor has taught me anything it's that HP just needs to shoot himself to make Touma serious</br>  <br> She wasn't making it worse but she wasn't improving it either.<br> He was going full "GOTTA STOP THIS FAGS FROM CAUSING THE END OF THE WORLD AGAIN" before she told him to calm down and explained him shit.</br></br>  <br>I was counting calming him down from going full despair as helping but maybe that's just me</br>  <br>And Mikoto doesn't seem much taller than Saiai either even though she should be.</br>  <br> Yeah, but the point is that she wouldn't be of help in this situation because this is a legit Magic God.<br> She could only tell him " Yeah, he is genuine, you are fucked" and that's it.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't exactly the kind of calming down that was needed. It was just relief that St. Germain wasn't a real Magic God and he was all "Oh, ok, this isn't as bad as I thought" where if St. Germain actually was, he'd be all "SON OF A BITCH IT'S EXACTLY AS BAD AS I THOUGHT"</br>  <br>Yes, yes we hear hear you</br>  <br>flat</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128421960 <br>That was in response to him losing to Hamazura</br>  <br><br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? <br> So feeling ashamed that you lack strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows <br> itself once you accept what you lack and <br>think about what to do without that strength.”<br>I'll remind you this was before he or Othinus knew Germain wasn't a magic god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine &gt;superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? So feeling ashamed &gt;that you lack <br> strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows itself once you accept what &gt;you lack and <br> think about what to do without that strength.” <br> When he heard that, Kamijou’s eyes finally narrowed softly. <br> He reached a hand toward Othinus and rubbed her small head with his &gt;fingertips. <br> “You are being too friendly, human.” <br> “Sorry. But make sure to remind me.” <br> Kamijou spoke without shame. <br>Sure?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Deliciously so. Fre a best. Though Nda is good too.</br>  didn't know misaka met the ninjas in railgun.<br><br>around what date of the timeline is the current arc?</br></br>  <br>She's talking about Magic Gods though, he wasn't so worried about losing to Hamazura as he was the fallout he was going to create fighting a magic god</br>  <br>Meeting them in a dream doesn't really count, you can't even see his face</br>  <br>No, he said he was weak and she said that he can't be as strong as a Magic God and to accept that he can't do everything.</br>  <br>Frenda a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>She didn't meet them, it just happened to be one of the cards she got.<br><br>Its after Vento's invasion but before Battle Royale.</br></br></br>  <br>~October 4. 5 days before Battle Royale.</br>  <br><br><br>I see.</br></br></br>  <br>yep because index and othinus wouldngive him the cold harsh truth<br><br>Not knowing how fucked up the situation is a bliss afterall.</br></br></br>  <br>You have to be trying to miss the point this hard</br>   saiai will never call Accel sempai   <br>Nice job ignoring the first part<br><br>------------<br>“…”<br><br>Kamijou Touma let out a weak breath while lying sprawled out on the floor.<br><br>He had been punched all over and a groaning pain reached him whenever he moved a joint.<br><br>Hamazura and the Power Lifter were gone. Only the jacket he had used for defense remained. After the system recovered from the errors, Hamazura had likely climbed back on and gone off to save his friends.<br><br>(Ahh…)<br><br>Unable to even cover his swollen face with his hands, Kamijou spoke blankly into the air.<br><br>“I really am weak.”<br><br>---<br><br>“Make no mistake. If all you were was strong, I would never have been saved in Denmark.”<br><br><br>for the rest<br><br>She was talking about his inability to stop Hamazura. She was comparing him to herself. They weren't talking about Magic Gods at all except in relation to how he saved her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ok guys so did anti touma happen or not?  July 21. After Stiyl tastes Imagine Breaker for the very first time, Touma brings Index to Komoe's place, after which Index is healed and Komoe gives them refuge for the next three days.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kuroko arrests Trick after destroying a building, and Saten gets herself and her friends juiced on the Level Upper.</br></br>  <br>What did this have to do with anything?</br>  <br>Is that<br>Accelerator</br></br>  <br>She was still giving him reasons to not worry about what the magic god might do and why his worth was found differently, he also right after that scene had resolved to figure out a way to try and fight germain despite him being a magic god (supposedly) so it still stands, even if you want to argue that's not what Othinus was going for, that she managed to make him not despair over it and find the courage to face a magic god again</br>  <br>Not yet. He only shows up at the end.</br>  <br>I'm just pointing out tidbits of the assumed timeline as it correlates with real-world dates.</br>  i'm glad kamachi came to write more feels and emotions than before othinus arc.<br>too bad new charactor syndrome is incurable though.</br>  <br>Thanks anon. The suspense is killing me.</br>  <br>It was a genearl statement it calmed him down.<br>that´s enough.</br></br>  <br>No it's Yuriko</br>  <br>The new characters were the best part of this volume though, I'd understand if you had made this complaint last volume.</br>  <br> yfw Kamachi makes her real. </br>  <br>Whats so bad an New charakter?<br><br>when you do differnt things you will meet different people.</br></br></br>  <br>It was enough to calm him down in the face of what he thought was a magic god, and no different than what mikoto is doing unintentionally. Really I don't know why touma is acting like silly shenanigans wouldn't happen with index and othinus, both have had those situations in dire situations.</br>  <br>She just gave him the resolve to not want Hamazura to be the reason the world blew up. Not specifically about the Magic God at all. This was just him wanting to protect Hamazura, not the actual courage to face a Magic God.</br>  <br>Which brings me back to </br>  <br>High Priest was realy good.<br>I kind dont like Kamachi for killing him.<br>Niang-niang was interesting powerwise <br>so i hope she will be ,,freed,,next volume.<br>about nephty we havent seen much she sounds like a nee-san to me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm really bothered about Touma not using his right hand on the priest too, it probably wouldnt work, but he is tecnically a dead body alive by magic. Would be worth the try.</br>  Imoto a Archetype?<br>was A Certain Academy Index basically Aleister Archtype controller going wrong?</br>  <br> he'd probably die <br>HP said he doesnt plan on killing Touma though. It would not even make sense.</br></br>  <br>My god, you didn't even understand the entire point of this did you? This was not Othinus alone calming him down to face a Magic God, this was Othinus using Hamazura to calm Touma down. The entire point of all this was that Index or Othinus would not work to help Touma not fear Magic Gods without help from others. This is why Touma said that if he had just them alone, all he'd get in information telling him how fucked her would be and to know the full extent of power of a Magic God while people like Hamazura or Mikoto who don't know jack about it would just let him think about their protection and what he can do to prevent it. It's similar to knowing you have a 100% chance of failure of an unknown chance of failure. Obviously, you wouldn't want to know you have 100%.</br>  <br> If that boy were to give in to him, the High Priest was sure to immediately behead him without a second thought. <br> He doesn't even realize he would probably kill Touma if he gave in.</br></br>  <br>Why are all Magig Gods so fickle?<br>only expection is Ollerus.</br></br>  <br>But only if is Accel's twin imouto. <br><br>Otherwise i won't agree, i need the edgy albino to bang some lolis and clones.</br></br></br>   Mikoto's novel <br> Touma still pretty much has all the best scenes and spotlight <br><br>This is the Sisters arc all over again, isn't it?</br></br></br>    <br> Ollerus <br> Magic God </br></br>  <br> Mikoto's novel </br>  <br> Ollerus <br> Magic God <br> Turn off the computer, Silvia.</br></br></br>  <br>That part explicitly mentioned how fickle High Priest is. I don't think Nephthys or Niang-Niang would have killed him on the spot, but Touma still didn't want the easy way out of fighting one Magic God with another.</br>  <br> &gt;Touma with Gunha <br> Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching. <br>I need this in my life</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a failure due to saving a cat.</br></br>  <br> Misaka seems to think that means anybody ignorant to magic and easy to talk to could take her place <br>I don't quite get why that seems to hurt her so much. I mean, whomever you are, anyone else who also had x, y, and z qualities could take your place, right? It seems sort of meaningless to stress over something like that.</br></br>  <br>Well, it was supposed to be her novel like how Misaki had her own novel.</br>  <br>NT12 Afterword<br><br> It’s about time for Mikoto to have her turn in the spotlight, isn’t it? </br></br></br>  <br>She wants to be important to the guy she likes so knowing she can just easily be replaced by someone else is a pretty harsh blow</br>  <br> She learns to visit the Beta world to learn how someone taking your place doesn't shit on what you have done.<br> FUCK, didn't she tell Touma that it didn't matter if someone else could have taken his place and saved the Sisters because in the end the one who did it was him?<br> I think it's about her being useless as anything but a damsel in distress than about the posibility of someone else taking her place.</br></br></br>  <br>When x quality is as broad as being ignorant of magic it pretty much means your crush thinks of you as the same as literally any other girl, that's going to hit home</br>  <br>yea but Othinius is the same.<br> great power. No firm direction could be felt in it. Or perhaps, it was not needed to be felt. <br> It was the ultimate form of power wielded as an individual. <br> No thought was given to what effect it would have on the future. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, it's all her fault. This brings me back to things she has said in the past, like in NT2 where she tells him that he isn't alone. Like, seriously? Anyone who even has the most basic idea about Touma's character knows that he's always backed up by a lot of people.<br><br>Instead of getting closer to him she kept her self-entitled stance and went on incorrect assumptions about his character. This is the only correct way to shattter her illusions and the only way she can actually learn from her mistakes and the situation she's in.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Got you fooled hey.</br></br>  <br>I forgot to add that Nephthys/Niang-Niang warned Touma that they'd destroy the entire archipelago if they helped, and Touma didn't want to agree to the deal even if he could reverse that damage.</br>  Where the fuck do I start with this?<br><br>Manga? Light Novel? Which Manga?</br></br>  <br>The not alone part refers to how Touma before NT9 would never ask for those people's help and would attempt to resolve issues without involving others at all if he could help it. This was a real part of Touma's character and made sense at the time. Why do you think it's such a big deal to everyone when he actually starts asking for assistance and everything?</br>  <br>why do you want to start?</br>  <br>I think rejecting Neph had more to do with her outright telling him that they would end up wrecking the city than it being the easy way out.<br><br>If it didn't have any drawbacks he might've been willing to accept their help. He never had a problem with Othinus zapping them to Denmark.</br></br></br>  <br>I have nothing better to do with my life.</br>  <br>Index LN, Railgun manga.</br>  <br>Light Novel, then Railgun Manga. Accel Manga if you really want.</br>  High Priest makes a good point. Touma has been unlike himself. More than the usual PTSD break down.  <br>LNs are the source material, "Index" LNs are the main series. Everything else is an adaptation and/or spin-off. Do with that what you will.</br>  <br> Light Novel.<br> You have like 35 volumes plus all the side stories so it will keep you entertained for a while.</br></br>  <br>I would just like to remember that Touma admitted in NT10 that he doesnt actually believe what he says, he just bullshits everything to make his opponent get his guard lowered.</br>  <br>"Easy way out" also included relying on the MGs to reverse their damage later on, and he never wanted to wield that kind of power. What happens the first time is what truly happens: that was part of Will's argument, and that was what stopped Touma from saying yes to High Priest in the first place.</br>   “I could have chosen a different path if I was with Index? I could have taken the best possible path if I was with Othinus? That’s not what this is about.” <br><br>I am very interested in how it would go if Othinus was with him. Never thought about it before, wonder what crazy shit he would do.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense.<br> When the opinions of all the many gods were gathered, it &gt;created a single flexible system. <br> As long as that system ultimately led them down the right path, &gt;everything was fine. <br> Those existences were known as gods, but they still had &gt;doubts and failures like anyone else </br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean Mikoto was using the correct approach. And it's not like he hadn't asked for help before. This is true after getting ditched afterwards and realizing in NT5/6 that no matter what she did, she could not force herself onto Touma and think that would be enough to stop him from doing what he always does.</br>  <br>It seems like that's taking it unnecessarily hard, though. I mean, if this were a romance in a mundane setting, and the MC told a girl that she was easy to talk to and he appreciated having someone not from his workplace/university/social-circle to talk to to take a breather, no character would say "Oh, no, that means I'm inconsequential and could be replaced by anyone!" but for some reason, this is a recurring issue with Raildex girls.</br>  <br> Did you missed the point? She would tell him " You are fucked up" and he would go full despair mode.</br>  It's scenes like this where you can tell the difference between nimrods who can't read between the lines and have a very superficial understanding of what's going on versus people who make sense of the latest development with what they knew beforehand and come to a balanced conclusion. Too many of the former on /a/ tbh  <br><br>Yeah I would like to see more of that and beyond.</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>FUCK OFF</br></br>  <br> tbh <br> vague generalized insults <br/></br></br>  <br>That doesn't sound like the "best possible path" to me</br>  <br>She wouldn`t do you know why?<br>because it´s obvious.</br></br>  I still say Kamikoto isn't happening and that she will re-evaluate her feelings, especially if she actually has realized she's not a huge asset to him. Hell, she doesn't even have a completely accurate picture of the Sisters project which is why she "loves" him. Why would she have an accurate picture of anything else? I don't hate her and am even glad Touma defended her but it doesn't change my opinion of the chances of their ship happening  <br> You read it wrong he said in a "What the fuck are you talking about, nigger?" kind of way.</br>  <br>Everyone knows Kamikoto isn't happening though.<br><br>I swear, people who get defensive and are in denial over that fact have to be trolling or just are retarded and underage kids from MAL or AS.</br></br></br>  <br>He literally said "that's not what this is about" keep reaching though</br>  <br> No, you don't get it.<br> He didn't mean that choosing Index or Othinus was the "best possible path", he was getting mad at HP for thinking so.</br></br>  <br>She wants to be his equal, but Magic Gods create that significant disparity between them.</br>  So much for #3 level 5. <br>Why academy city espers are so elitist again?</br>  <br><br><br>I always interpreted that "you're not alone" part as "no matter what happens, in whatever circumstance, I will be there for you". Because yes, Touma is backed up by a lot of people, but sometimes they're off doing their own thing or can't help him under certain conditions. Biri was playing the "faithful waifu" card where she unconditionally has his back. Not that it ever came through, and Touma didn't care, but at the time I thought it was a sweet thing to hear from a capricious middle school girl like her.<br><br><br> I still say Kamikoto isn't happening <br>No shit, Sherlock. In terms of waifufaggotry there's going to be nothing on the plates unless Kamachi pulls a fast one on us. I just want my dream team, Imagine Breaker and Railgun. Probably won't come to fruition until the climax though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is Mikoto finally going to learn about magic? will she also get a lesson from Birdway or Othinus?  <br>The best person to learn magic from is probably Tsuchimikado</br>  <br>Why? Even Accelerator and Hamazura didn't get much more than a crash course. Why on Earth would Birdway bother giving Mikoto more than maybe an hour's worth of lesson? If it's the quick abridged version, Touma just as good.</br>  <br>Maybe. I mean, are they even aware that she doesn't even have all the facts on the Sisters Project which is the whole reason she loves him? She doesn't know the first thing about it other than it happened. She also doesn't have the first clue about who Index is and her relation to Touma, which would only scratch the surface of Touma's life. She truly is clueless. I want her to to learn more about the Sisters and just what the hell was going on there more than I want her to learn about magic</br>  <br>It's not happening, but I don't see her re-evaluating her feelings before we really get to the home stretch.<br><br>I also don't think her realizing she's not that useful is a big deal-breaker - unless Nephthys joins the harem, there aren't any options that are particularly useful at this point.</br></br></br>  <br> Touma didn't care <br>More like he's still keeping his promise to Etzali to "protect her world".<br><br>And that world of hers shouldn't include magic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Etzali <br>I feel for the guy, I hope he marries one of the clones at the end</br></br>  <br>He's got double dose of delicious brown.</br>  <br>Kamachi forced to write Mikoto novel. isn't it?</br>  <br>Why so hyperventilated, bro?</br>  <br>At least she got a taste of her own medicine.</br>  <br><br>C'mon mane we had enough of that shit this thread, don't bump wit that</br></br>  so do you think its basically over with the Magic Gods?<br>I don´t</br>  <br>See, that's the main issue with her. She should at least try to spend some casual time with Touma, getting to know him on a personal level, his history, his interpersonal relationships, the world he's living in and the problems he gets involved in all the time, without blowing a fuse and accepting that he's a chick magnet that is always into ridiculous hit, which is the cause that their casual meetings are short lived most of the times. It makes her feel just superficial; her words have barely any weight. It also makes hard to take her reasoning and motivation seriouly. Why would she repeatedly go that far for someone with no special connection or tie with her? Her position in the story sadly doesn't allow her to be heavily involved with the central plot, which hurts her potential a lot. She was putting a lot of thought about all this at the start of NT13, but it was again shafted in favor of comedy and flanderization.<br><br><br>Yeah. A good start would be simply going to his dorm and know what Othinus and Index mean to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't even have a clue about her own backyard (the Sisters) why should she worry about Touma's?</br>  <br>She's not even relevant to the Sisters plots anymore.<br><br>I'm only saying that because her entire character in Index revolves around Touma and it would help to make her motivations and feelings for him actually solid.</br></br></br>  <br>She's had a crush on the guy for thirty volumes and doesn't know anything about him.</br>  <br><br>I'm saying she doesn't even have a complete understanding of the situation that brought about her crush. If she did, would her feelings change? If the Sisters are so important to her she crushes on the guy for saving them shouldn't she start by having an understanding of that</br></br>  <br> She should at least try to spend some casual time with Touma, getting to know him on a personal level, his history, his interpersonal relationships <br> casual time with Touma <br>lol<br><br>She's tried a couple times but Touma has a busy schedule, world-saving and girl-punching and the like. On the off chance she catches up to him, he's having a fruit cola moment and doing something so stupid that she tries to fry him. I'm beginning to think this is all planned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The issue with her is that when she did try to at least get some info about his problems and shit Touma never lets her dig deeper and she never tries to dig deeper, that's why she's been trying to force him to accept help, so she can actually try to help him.</br>  <br>Maybe not her feelings, but it could very much serve as catalyst for development. It could lead to her keeping her emotions in check when she sees him surrounded by girls or in ridiculous situations. She really needs to stop being fucking ignorant about everything though.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/334189/toaru-<wbr>kagaku-no-railgun_ch78_by_anonymous<wbr></wbr></wbr>  I don't know about HP, but Touma running around and doing stuff to try and slow him down wasn't boring in my opinion.   Fremea massaged Frenda's breasts <br> Based on her comments, Frenda has little interest in having a larger rack <br><br>So. Why did Fremea massage Frenda's chest?</br></br></br>  <br>HP is just upset he didn't get into a fisticuffs match.</br>  <br>Mikoto shouldn't go anywhere near Touma's dorm until she can control herself. As is, she'd just get pissed about him living with girls and burn all his shit.</br>  <br><br>In short, they're just not on the same wavelength, they lack any chemistry whatsoever. It just shows how unrequited and hopeless her crush is.</br></br>  <br> She was showing favoritism to Fre.</br>  <br>Not really, seeing how well they're getting along in this volume+ the fact that Touma doesn't think she's truly a burden then that means something is improving, there's definitely some chemistry either way though.</br>  <br>Based Hamazura appeared</br>  Hmm looks like retarded Mikotohaters BTFO. Thank you based Kamachi.  <br> Mikotofag starting shit again </br>  <br>I respectfully disagree the chemistry is romantic. They would be awesome as bros, though. This volume shows they make a decent enough fighting team. And he does have some respect for her. I'd rather them become close that way</br>  <br>I never said it was romantic anon.</br>  <br> they're just not on the same wavelength <br>My point is that they're not even on the same radio network most of the time. On the rare occasions they are (and sticking together, as opposed to Touma running off somewhere and leaving her behind) they do all right.<br><br><br><br>I fucking hate you cunts. So tired of seeing "BTFO" in muh Raildex threads</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm more interested how something that is a major thing said on /sp/ somehow transited to here.</br></br>   57 poster <br>I see the quality hasn't changed</br>  The romance shit is what brings Mikoto and Touma's interactions down.<br><br>They were at their best as rivals in the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, they are better as pals.</br>  <br><br>What romance stuff? You mean one sided crush?</br></br>  <br>I started seeing it a lot more on /a/ right after Kill la Kill aired.<br> IRC BTFO <br>and so forth<br><br><br> What bad luck <br>Is that supposed to be fukou da? How did YP translate Fukou da anyway?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Mikoto growing in a different direction (or never having had the romantic subplot at all but that's too late) would be awesome. Imagine if this volume had happened without the romantic subplot and she was just a spunky science sidekick wondering why her bro was acting weird. She'd be goddamn amazing.</br>  <br>/sp/ memes always find their way here somehow. I think tbh is theirs, right? And da burrs basically got refashioned in /a/'s image.</br>  <br>I don't really need to imagine anything since this volume is amazing enough for me.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>A lot of /a/nons browse /sp/. <br><br>You should see important game threads. There is always a "who /a/ here" post with a lot of replies.</br></br></br>  <br>"tbh" is frowned upon though.</br>  Why are there two threads in the catalog<br>One is at 333+ posts<br>And it's burning</br></br>  <br>Either one is valid.<br><br><br>The first Railgun scanlation wasn't of the best quality.</br></br></br></br>  High Priest was truly the spotlight of this volume.  <br>I don't see why you make a big deal out of it, tbh.</br>  <br> University City <br>Hahaha</br></br>  <br><br>tbh I thought was a /brit/ thing that is major on /int/ along with lad<br><br><br><br>Most aren't /a/nons as do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? Hell most probably just do that to annoy people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the other thread isn't about the discussion of NT13 and the new Railgun chapter?</br>  <br> do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? <br> I do that.   Only in world cup threads though <br><br><br> isn't about the discussion of NT13 <br>They're arguing about Mikoto's exploits in this novel again</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did YP translate Fukou da anyway? <br>Rotten luck.</br></br>  <br><br> do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? <br><br>Most of the times they even have reaction images from currently airing shows, so some of them are /a/nons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't too bad, actually. Better than "such misfortune".</br>  <br>Even Index wasn't safe.<br><br> yfw da Indekkusu wins da Toumab owl </br></br></br>  <br>Did the bears actually win in the end?</br>  <br> tfw German and first time in my life cross boarded to just laugh at Argentinians <br><br>It was a strange feeling.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Fuck you.</br>  <br>Are you a negro?</br>  http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>472642</wbr>  where is the chapter supposed to come out first translated?  <br>oh god, I totally forgot about that.  ;_; </br>    <br>I want to fuck puck.</br>  <br>love that volume</br>  Let's talk about Gahamama.  <br>This isn't at all a fair holiday. Women have time to prepare and know exactly what will happen. Men on the other hand have no idea what's going to happen and have 1 day to find a gift 3 times as meaningful as the one they received.<br><br>I hope 8man just buys the service club 6 packs of MAX COFFEE™. That'll show 'em.</br></br></br>  <br>I can. She must forget about her feelings for Hikki - they can't be together for long, she is not smart enough. Sex friends at max.</br>  <br>Sex leads to baby, baby leads to together for a long time.<br><br>Also she isn't completely stupid she just doesn't get big words  or know what penguins are. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure at the very least Yui isn't stupid enough to try for a teen pregnancy.</br>  <br>It isn't as if Yui would leglock 8man, forget to take her pill, or forget what day is a safe day. <br><br><br>I hope 8man shows up with nothing not realizing he had to get something.</br></br></br></br>  If she is the product of father/daughter incest, why doesn't she have any birth defects?  <br>everyone has defective genes you retard. They're just normally masked by non-defective versions of the same genes. Inbreeding greatly increases the odds of the defective gene being the only version of the gene.</br>  <br> basing everything you know about incest on a painting from the 1600s </br>  <br>So should I read the manga or is the Anime comprehensive enough? I want to get on the wild ride.</br>  <br>Both are comprehensive enough and it's a very nice story too.</br>  <br>This is one of the cases where you're better off watching the anime. The anime only covers the first half of the story, but you really don't need to read the second half.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128354<wbr>357/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone starts somewhere.</br>  <br> frogposting <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Don't be such a bully, please.</br>  <br> No one will remember your voice <br> voice <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  今、私はよつばの第三話まで読んだ。嬉しいです</blockquote>]
