[  It's time.   <br>Prison School full of worst boys.</br>  No  So how about  It really isn't time. This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  <br>Tell them not to use words they don't understand.</br>  <br>Leave them to their delusions and then go back to feeding your husbando.</br>  <br>It's perfectly fine.</br>  <br><br>Slut</br></br>  <br><br>You cum guzzling whores.</br></br>  I didn't like this that much but the new cover is so nice I'm tempted to buyfag it.  <br><br>I love cumming in my pure husbandos.</br></br>  <br> husbandos <br>Don't use words you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>I thought I was the only one who didn't like the story. Art's nice though.</br>  <br>Tell them having more than one husbando will ruin their laifusbando.</br>  <br>I love all my husbandos.</br>  <br>Or more than one husbando is a bad endo.</br>  <br>I would've liked it better if Shun hadn't been such a shit. <br>Mio getting character development out of nowhere didn't help either. He lost a lot of charm.</br></br>  The staff really, really likes these guys. This episode had a bunch of anime-original touchy-feely shenanigans. <br>I'm dying to know what they're doing in the pot in the ED since they're facing away from the viewer.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>The on-topic one.<br><br> Fuck that's lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>Lewd swords are best swords.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>The one that belongs in /vg--<br>oh wait your swordshit general is dead because your game fucking sucks.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br>Kill those abominations.</br>  I didn't expect to like this guy as much as I do now. I can't wait for his suffering to begin.  <br>I didn't expect to like any character, or even the show itself, as much as I do. Truly glad I picked it up.</br>  It was  okay.   <br>Same here. Even  imouto  is growing on me.</br>  <br>I like him too, the sol scenes with the teleportation guy and him are great. The whole cast is really nice to watch.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll bite.</br>  <br><br>What's the target audience for this show? I was expecting the two guys to get paired up with the girls but it feels more like the two guys and the two girls are getting paired up among themselves.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833992/2c2c79<wbr>6cd7/</wbr>  <br>Megane's autism is so endearing.</br>  <br>Might be omnipandering.  I know this isn't the thread for this, and I'm usually no yurifag, but I have to say that the two girls seem cute together. Kind of wish it were real rather than just ED fanservice. <br><br><br> I can't figure out which one is more dominant. <br>I think it's pretty clear, since Kaito barely acts his age and Nagisa pretty much curbstomps his enthusiasm given the slightest chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped CG but moeducer was really a gem boy there. Glad he got noticed.</br>  <br>I hope we have time for his backstory.<br><br>By the way, are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones?</br></br></br>  <br>I am, but first I need to learn how.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, if fujoshi jump on this, Kaito will be the one on top.</br>  <br>I never saw HS for this one so I don't how they compare, but subs for every other HS show have been pretty shitty, so I'm sure these are better.</br>  i waited 3 months to see this moe face again, and i was not disappointed  <br>Is this shit still being translated?</br>  <br> are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones? <br>I haven't seen CR's script aside from the pastebin with the mistranslations from episode 1, but judging from that I'd call the other option better.</br></br>  <br>That one's the sequel, so no. <br>Someone's typesetting the old one right now, don't know if it's completed yet.</br></br>  <br>Going to buyfag it for the art. I'm probably going to buyfag all her works.</br>  <br> To be honest the suffering was the only reason I picked up the manga.</br>  Please tell me this semen demon shows up again at some point.  <br> Everyone in this story returns at some point. <br>Also Obi is best girl.</br></br>    <br>Here I thought I wouldn't feel the need to watch this show after reading the manga, but I'm almost changing my mind just because of their increased screentime.</br>  I'll post some Kyoani boys from specials who still hot no screen time but was mentioned    Why did I wait so long to start watching this?  <br>If you like the manga enough to stay current, you'll like everything JC Staff is doing with the anime. You have Shouji and Daigo's cheerleading scenes in the election, which I'm sure are going to be embellished, to look forward to as well.</br>  <br>Are any new films or pretty much anything coming out anytime soon?</br>  <br>Is he autistic? I felt really sorry for him. He'll forever exist only in this short, lacking personality, blowing at cats on his window sill. It's almost as if the viewer is a figment of his imagination.</br>  <br><br>I like KnK's designs for boys better.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128277298 <br> Nakigitsune <br><br>Thanks for the update anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked how Kyoani colored the hair in KnK, but my favorite were Hyouka's designs.</br>  <br>You are still on time to sweat together over precious Shokugeki boys.</br>  <br>Kind of wish the series had a couple more guys in it, I still haven't gotten around to watching it because it seems like a lot of yuribait drama.<br><br><br> I think of him as being like a stoner NEET.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bodies in Shokugeki are deliciously drawn. I had originally dropped it due to lack of time, but I've picked it back the fuck up after seeing all these screencaps.</br>  <br>So I assume you don't know about the new ending</br>  <br> fagotto </br>  <br>I still want Isshiki and Souma to fuck.</br>  <br>It's probably a toss up between the two for me when it comes to character designs. For actual character personalities, though, Hyouka wins for me.  S2 never. ;_; <br><br> "select all ice cream" <br> only gives me pictures of sorbet <br>Goddammit, Google.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best instrument</br>  <br>I liked how Soma's dad was utterly unfazed by how Isshiki walks around in nothing but an apron. I get the impression Polar Star is like a breeding ground for weirdoes.</br>  <br><br>I want to molest all Kyoani boys.</br></br>  <br>The yuribait is  great  and isolated into a couple scenes. The rest is just regular friendship. <br>The series is plot heavy and drama is always related to the brass band club, save for one episode.</br></br>  <br>Well, despite what Hibike threads said while watching this I hadn't got the feeling there is yuri there or my yuri googles wasn't strong enough to see romance between fem characters, but indeed there was friendship, idolizing and appreciating. <br>Also it is really rare for Kyoani shows but the drama was surprisingly fine and didn't felt like overreacting about stupid things.<br>It was about  having leading solo in competition's performance everybody trained really hard for. </br></br></br>  What's the homoest non homo show you've ever seen? Any Gundam does not count, or any mecha for that matter.  <br> image <br>What is this anon?</br></br>  <br>  No Gundam or any mecha <br><br>Fine then.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Evangelion technically isn't a mecha</br>  <br>I guess Texhnolyze or Shigurui. <br>The amount of genuine gay both had was pretty surprising.</br></br>    <br>Hunter x Hunter</br>  <br>I need to go watch some more shows with bromance.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>1509618<br> They're from this artist but I'm not sure if they're musician OCs or some kind of instrument gijinka.</br></wbr></br>  <br>he said non homo</br>  <br>HxH is non-homo. Togashi intended it as a pure friendship.</br>  <br> dat bari sax <br>I'd empty that guy's spit valve, if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br>You should have exclude sports series too.</br>  <br>Wanted to post it </br>    <br>Nice rec request.</br>  <br>Don't be so slut, Kise.</br>  <br>Dio the moest</br>  <br>I wonder why Araki made him look like a lesbian after drained Joseph. Regular Banana DIO looks better.</br>  What's going on here?  <br>A not-so-secret discussion over whether or not to rape Marui once he's unconscious.</br>  <br>Discussion of country grown vegetables.</br>  <br>I want to  hug_  Ceylan tenderly</br>  <br><br>Those are rather different.</br></br>  Will everything be okay in the end?  <br>With those two, their conversations can range far and wide.</br>  <br>No, because bitches will ruin anything and the omnipandering roach who created this series won't kill them off.</br>  <br>Getbackers is really fucking gay without actually being gay.</br>  <br>Someone's mad.</br>  <br>Never 4get.</br>  <br>Mika was Yuu's family first. That has to count for something, right? If Shinoa canonly won the Yuu it'd be like she slipped into Mika's yard and stole the fruit from the tree he's put all his effort into growing for all these years. It'd be too cruel.</br>  Nagisa's thighs  <br>It's not cheating if they have the same VA</br>  <br> It'd be too cruel. <br>Sounds just like Kagami. But more importantly this is a shounen magazine. If there is any actual romance it will be with the main girl.</br></br>  <br> serious homo end <br>Remind yourself how many times that has happened.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember Shinoa/Yuu being implied as hard in the manga as it was in the anime. Do I just have selective memory or did WIT up the hetero.</br>  <br>I'm not asking for a homo end, just one where Shinoa doesn't undeniably win. Something nice and open-ended and easy on the imagination is all I need.</br>  <br>Indeed, hence my nomination of it in 's post.</br>  <br>I keep putting off finishing the manga, it's a shame where the anime left off and best boy couldn't be animated.</br>  <br>I am. I'm weary of being tormented by cowardly writers and studios. After the Aldnoah Zero not-ending, I'm after full-on homo ends now. Being teased is no longer enough.</br>  <br>That hair looks so bad. Who finds that attractive?</br>  <br>But anon, best boy was animated.</br>  <br>The early '00s were a time of strange things.</br>  <br>Those are still common choices in video game hair selection, so clearly people who like them haven't been properly exterminated yet.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I'd love a legitimately homo end, but I know it'll never happen. More than anything I just want Kagami to stop relentlessly shitting on every aspect of Mika's life and let him be cared for the most by the person he cares for the most in turn. That's the absolute least he deserves for all he's been through.</br>  <br>I think they gave her a few more scenes. And the fanbase is extremely vocal so it makes it look even more serious.</br>  <br>The official art for this show always got me.<br><br>I'm still mad with what happened with Kagami and I can't hate that 'two seconds' guy.<br><br> You will never share a body with six of your brothers. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because it's fujobait. Blatant, 90s fujobait.</br>  <br>Either way, I can't stand her and I want some vampire to suck her dry and then piss in her skull.</br>  <br>where's the raw for this? I want to translate it.</br>  <br>Slightly bigger.</br>  <br>The official art was great. It went from casual like pic related to almost shameless sluttiness.</br>  <br><br>I remember watching this anime because of the gay art and in the end I thought it wasn't even that gay<br>Same thing with Trinity Blood, damn this artist and my dumb young self</br></br></br>  <br>The art trolled a lot of people, but it wasn't like it was a boring series. Sure, the ending was ambiguous as usual but it didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out Ban and Ginji were basically a married couple.</br>  <br>Karma's ass</br>  <br>A poor married couple.<br><br> taking showers in sprinklers  <br> sleeping in a car <br> sleeping on benches  <br> begging for food <br><br>It was a lot of fun, now I want to rewatch it.<br><br>The third ed, where they moved a little closer and the fourth ed I had no idea what the hell was going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice! I wish Hamatora had been this good.</br>  <br>Mika gets only suffering from his families. This time is not exception.</br>  <br>Shared adversity is all part of the package deal. After the reams of shit they went through across the scope of the series, nothing's breaking those two up.</br>  <br>Shinoa is letting him borrow Yuu currently but we all know  he will die in the end for being an expat of the human race </br>   decide to read Reborn <br> like Yamato and Enma <br> Chrom is cute <br> don't see what people see in Hibari, prince or those other fags <br> still reading more, quality going down hill and everywhere <br> for some reason start liking Hibari and don't know why <br><br>On a different note, I have no idea what the hell is going on anymore in DGM, it's nice that Hoshino has come back but I am quite confused still after trying to re-read things here and there. <br><br>I don't get why people say it's fujo now, maybe aside the fact that Kanada's waifu was given a penis but I don't see it. Those outfits were lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I had read a little of the manga beforehand and recall it being a pretty heavy on the female fanservice, so I was a bit surprised when I eventually saw the anime's official art.</br>  <br>Titmonster Hevn was a bit of a smokescreen, but it became pretty apparent early on that she was basically just static noise and every freak and weirdo in town was trying to pry Ban and Ginji apart for their own little agendas and that was going to be the crux of the series: those two vs the world.</br>  <br>I just want to see Ceylan and Guren   hug  </br>  Soon  <br> a microman in a power suit <br>Somehow this triggered my fetish sensors. I hate you anon.</br></br>  <br>I need the DVD-box rips</br>  <br>This will have one of the shittiest fanbase of all time.</br>  <br>Don't be silly, it's not a Type-Moon work.</br>  The story is kinda shitty, but the art is so nice.  <br><br>The threads will be cancerous shit probably flooded with underage and /co/, but we can always discuss it here</br></br>   horrible personality but kind onii-chan <br>That's my fetish.</br>  <br>Can't be worse than SnK.</br>  <br> MC is actually homo <br>Wow, it's managed something 85% of BL can't</br></br>  <br> Kanada's waifu was given a penis <br>I stopped watching this during the fillers around episode 25.

The <br> I'm only gay for you <br>thing gets tired very very quickly if you ask me, it's just lazy writing so the boys can conveniently fall in love whilst still being "available" to the straight women reading.<br><br><br>Yes, it's only good for shit like the corn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monochrome Factor <br><br><br>Unfortunately.<br><br>The OP was pretty good though.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SLH<wbr>nxM0lE3Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I remember thinking how weird it was that they didn't have noses. How times have changed since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br>No I mean how next to every poster here decides to be more vague than necessarily and use homo which says especially little as an adjective. Historically it could as well mean Code Geass level. If a character is "actually homo" as in "actually loves men in general and only men" it's better to call it what it is.</br>  <br>Homo sounds more amusing than gay, and usually the characters in question aren't officially gay regardless of what they end up doing.</br>  Did we ever get any mob Oikawa doujins?  <br>I want to get mauled by this taiga</br>  <br>Fuck off sjw.</br>  <br>U gay</br>  <br> you will never abuse shota Mika <br><br>How terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to maul his boypussy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128300779 <br>Hello newfag, welcome to the homothread and enjoy your stay.</br>  <br><br>Did it ended for good?

And it might start later in Japan again.</br>  <br>"Gay" is just as meaningless, since people use it seriously and jokingly to mean 'any thing I don't like'. (see: faggot).<br><br>Nips will actually use the borrow word "homo," so it's only natural it becomes a habit to use it around here.<br><br>Nobody is going to type "homosexual" when they can just casually shorten it to homo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait to see Genos animated, but I have a feeling the threads will pull a 'no homos allowed'.</br>  <br>Who is translating this?<br>I can't find anything past chapter 3.</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>Please do better next time.</br></br>  <br>I don't think that's going to stop anybody.</br>  How come best boy doesn't get any friends?  <br>Only two chapters anon?<br>Damn<br><br><br>Haha, in recent memory so did Aldnoah Zero threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least we got ending with a good plot for porn and healing</br>  <br>?<br>Aldnoah threads were gay as fuck<br><br>The best threads are probably Shokugeki ones, where straightfags and homofags get along and everyone wants to fuck everyone.</br></br></br></br>   used to not like shota <br> read some paranormal manga <br> all shota are best boys <br> police officer is best girl <br><br>I don't understand but now I want potato candy.<br><br>Pic unrelated but want to rewatch.<br><br> Liquid will never be your bitch. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except for those faggots who hate when the boys are sexualized and the ones calling out boy lust.

Not in a good way though.</br>  Happy birthday Nagisa.  <br> Yamete Kudasai Mabushii Desu </br>  <br>Me too. He pisses me off. Well the show pisses me off with it constantly making him the crush of every girl he walks by. Combined with his personality and actually good looks, it's making me want to abuse him.</br>  <br>I got it at least.</br>  <br>How are you celebrating anon?</br>  <br>Happy Birthday semen demon!</br>  <br>By doing nothing.</br>  I might have found out why. <br>When I right click the picture in chrome and use "Search google for this image" i get  result.<br><br>However if I save the picture, go "search by image" in google and upload it I get  result<br><br>Atleast this was the case for me, other anons are free to try it out</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hair down Nagisa <br>This is wrong.</br></br>  <br> I still want Takumi and Souma to fuck. <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br> using botnet </br>  What's a good manga/anime that has canon (or 99% confirmed/implied) homo?<br>It's fine (could be even better actually) if the story is about something completely different, just with a side/sub-story about two main characters going homo.<br>However, a story about a cute fujoshit relationship could work as well, as long as it's not "yaoi: the stereotype".<br><br>I just want warm feelings, joy of seeing two characters be in love with each other (cute boys are highly preferred) and just in general a decent anime/manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe they cut that line from the anime. It added a lot to both his character and his relationship to Yuu. It was just one fucking line, why take it out?</br>  <br>You're wrong.</br>  <br>I usually use firefox actually, but switch to chrome to whenever I need to reverse google images because i don't have to save the image and manually upload it again.</br>  <br>There are so many, at least in manga.

Are you not using 4chanx?</br>  <br>The addon only searches the thumbnail. If you expand the image, right-click -&gt; copy image location, and then put that into google you get better results as well.</br>  <br>I agree. Also because it was said MC stopped acting like edgy master at orphanage since he understood that everyone there had a hard life before too.</br>  <br>But it's cute.<br><br>Usually long hair a shit, but on Nagisa it works.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the damn thread. Tons of shows with heavy homobait and implication were mentioned before. <br>If you want confirmed homo there is Nakamurashit and shitty old OVAs. <br>If you wasn't a newfag you would already switch to BL manga for proper sex and romance stuff just like everyone here did.</br></br></br>  <br>He just needs a normal haircut with hair long enough to cover ears.</br>  <br>Most BL manga has shit designs or art though. It's pretty rare to find a good one. Not that it doesn't exist, just rare.</br>  <br>Not at all. <br>Seriously it's not hard in the least. <br>And I'm not even including all the mountains of untranslated stuff. <br>When will this meme die?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was rare and hard to find 8 years ago. <br>Nowdays there is enough, just search. The only often issue is with writing.</br></br>  <br>You could try Ame Nochi Hare and  lurk moar.   Because these threads are pretty fun. </br>  This was cute as fuck but I wish they fucked too  <br>Actually, it's pretty common to have one character that's homo and another that's straight.</br>  <br> straight <br>closeted bi</br></br>  <br>Somebody arrest Shinomiya.</br>  <br>There is no bi in Japan. Bisexuals don't exist.</br>  <br>This looks so stupid, especially when they gave them those stupid fangs when they were fighting, this looks like some shit you'd see on DA a few years back.</br>  Remember to love your sluts on their birthdays.  <br>It's the other way. Homosexuals don't exist. All homos are bi.</br>  <br> All homos are bi. <br>Sadly, this is the truth for Japan.</br></br>  <br> Sadly </br>  <br><br>Who cares?</br></br>   The mystical orient has no homosexuals <br>Oh wow this is /jp/ experts at best.</br>  <br>Better than<br> all bis are homo or straight, but confused <br>from the west</br></br></br>  I think this might be the cringiest anime I've every watched.  <br>I feel dirty and I love it.</br>  <br>I've watched 20 animes, of course I already know everything about grorious nihon's culture</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  <br> wanting happy times <br> not suffering </br></br>  <br>The world needs more bottom Kaworu art.</br>  <br>Suffering with surprise happy times is the absolute best combination.</br>  <br>It doesn't even have to be Shinji fucking him, I'd be fine with faceless men too.</br>  <br>Someone fix his eyes.</br>  <br>What about suffering with surprise suffering?</br>  <br>Yu Yu Hakusho</br>  <br>You're saying you can watch that thing without cringing at all?</br>  <br>As in, the "no homo allowed" shit doesn't stop anyone anon.<br>Aldnoah Zero threads being an example where homo continued despite the hate.</br></br>  <br>It's still annoying.</br>  <br>Lock the door, headphones, bed, imagine it's your husbando and enjoy without cringing.<br><br>It would be pretty cool if someone took the audio from these things made a custom animation thing (or even just a slideshow) with pictures of a character played by the same voice actor.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah this, only way I'll ever be able to appreciate this show</br>  <br>what is going on in this picture posted here</br>  <br>Why is his face so punchable?</br>  <br>And?<br>Just deal with it.</br></br>  <br>You say that as if the manga threads aren't already bad thanks to the circlejerking drawfags and the constant vocal fubukifags.</br>  <br>It is tomorrow.<br>The homo thread was early.</br></br>  <br>Fubuki isn't even qt. I don't get it.</br>  <br> Saitama doesn't care Genos is gone <br> he probably never cared from the beginning </br></br>  <br>They're ass men.</br>  <br> Not a single VA or character I care enough for to do this </br>  <br>How about  a faceless man lulling you to sleep? </br>  <br> tfw your husbando's VA actively refuses to voice these kinds of series </br>  <br> tfw husbando is voiced by a girl </br>  <br>Not even as blatant a Masayoshi ripoff as this could convince me to play one of those games.</br>  <br> rip off <br>Masayoshi is just bland.</br></br>  <br> ripping off a shit show that bombed like 1944 Dresden <br> implying </br></br>  <br>Nah, not interested in that at all. Takumi's not even Polar Star.</br>  <br>That haircut is pretty common used in characters designs. I don't think he has the same pure personality as Masayoshi's one.<br><br><br>You are shit and need some fists of justice to beat up your ass.</br></br></br></br>    Miss Rhito's old style, her art looks wonky now.<br><br>You lot have any favorite artist?

Even Rhythm-kun could be worse.</br></br>  <br>I remember when threads had some Saitama and Genos lust, actual discussion, and minimal "Sonic is a grill" shitposters and sister waifu wars. Good times.</br>  <br>Who is the background boy? The one with blue hair.</br>  <br>I could be wrong, but I think that it's the government worker who shows up periodically in the background.

"Cute".</br>  What's wrong with her thighs, though?  <br>My guess is that they are part of a bigger group where they are on the lowest rank (bed warmer), so they are giving the Gakkous to the leaders as a meal ticket to ensure their survival.</br>  Alright /a/, which  Guracho  would you  take out to mexican food and tequila?     <br><br>Miki a slut anon</br></br>  <br><br>Bromance not Yuri, ok.<br><br>This is what I agree with.</br></br></br></br>  Through the power of Christ and a plowshares turned into swords, Megu-nee will protect all the waifus from the zombies even if they bully her.  <br><br>Megu-nee is the real hero<br>Honoraburu sacrifisu</br></br></br>  so cute and pure.

I'd love to see more of him wearing the fabulous rings and other accessories that were featured in last month's issue of Animage Magazine (included in ref), something like these pictures http://i.imgur.com/6Run00f.jpg with him sitting on a throne while showing them off would be fantastic. You can even add a crown, since he's a Leo and it might fit with the whole picture. But anything of him as long as he looks happy or cool is perfectly fine. Thank you if you consider drawing him and good luck everyone.  Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps dressed in Medieval/fantasy attire (prince, knight, whatever).<br><br>Have a good weekended, everyone.</br></br>  Requesting Mazaki Anzu as your favourite fighting game character or playing on a fight stick.<br><br>Any other works are appreciated.</br></br>  Louise, please. Something with her wearing open toed heels would be nice.  <br>My love has gone strong for nearly a decade. Not getting a drawing is the least of my worries, I have other ways of showing her my love <br> Like rehauling her entire series wiki </br></br>  Requesting Hakodate Omiko trying to deal with the summer heat, having a hearty laugh, or just a cute drawing of her. Whichever you prefer. Thanks!  <br> Q <br> not Mysu <br>what a shit taste</br></br></br>  Requesting Latifa hugging an anonplushie similiarly to the bottom-right image.

I'd draw her right now.</br>    <br>I feel you anon<br> I try to calm everyone down but then I realize I don't want to post and add to the fire and I end up just watching everyone tear each other apart. It's saddening </br></br>  <br>I second that.<br>I'd put her at the top of my whitelist</br></br>  Have to go to bed now, I'll check back in the morning and never lose hope.  <br>that's not rori bait you fag, needs more nekomimis, futa or circle involved to be rori bait</br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br> Only hint I'll give is that I am a developing drawfag. </br>  Requesting Amakusa Shino, please and thankyou.<br>Optionally engrossed in a book of ghost stories late at night, but anything else is fine too.</br>  <br>Then you are one of the silent, non-autistic majority. <br><br>You're the reason these threads exist, keep it up. <br> I hope I draw your waifu next </br></br></br></br>  <br> I've got none of those three in my favor </br>  Small request<br>Requesting an Ikamusume version of that image</br>  <br>Hmmm. <br><br>HMMM.</br></br></br>  I'm requesting anything cute of Yukiho. <br>Thanks in advance!</br>  I wonder if things would work out better if these threads were throughout a full week, with more time to have stuff picked up, more time to try to get everyones waifu drawn. Though that would change the whole idea of these threads probably.  <br>There's more than one of us, chucklefuck</br>  <br>But she was drawn, twice. I'm quite happy today, in light of everything.</br>  Requesting Sakuya enjoying playing fighting games on an arcade cabinet.  <br>This would just be the drawthread.

It was made to sell and it did sell. It was even decent on top of that. I've got nothing against it, but people that think that it's deep or 10/10 masterpiece irritate me.</br>  <br>I think it's a 10/10 masterpiece. Go back to your Eva thread.</br>  <br>Perfect sense tends to sound incoherent to morons. Any dickhead with a pencil and paper can subvert a popular genre, writing a 'dark' magical girl series is literally as creative a premise as the Scary Movie franchise. It defines itself in how it carries out this idea, in which Madoka did a half-decent job. But that's not good enough for the autistic faggots that permeate this fandom, they honestly believe this is the apex of Japanese animation because they don't know any better. I remember back when I thought Elfen Lied was "deep". Basically the same thing, except that show didn't leave a stain on /a/ that continues to haunt us to this day.</br>  <br>You mean you would have done better? Tell us everything anon, we want to hear your master plan.</br>  <br>4/10 made me reply.</br>  <br>The "Let's see you do better" fallacy. The only times this is ever said is when a desperate moron runs out of counterarguments. Get it together autismo, whether or not I can pen a superior story has no bearing on the quality of this work and I honestly have no idea why you would think that.</br>  Madoka  <br>Nice fallacy, anon.</br>  <br> Any dickhead with a pencil and paper can subvert a popular genre <br>You are a dickhead, you most likely have a pencil and a paper. So I'd like to see you prove what you're saying. "Seeing is believing", remember?</br></br>  <br>Not being able to understand metaphors/hyperboles is a sign of autism. It meant that any author could subvert a popular genre. Anyway, you can cut out "Any dickhead with a pencil and paper can subvert a popular genre" from his comment and it still makes sense. Fuck off.</br>  <br> nothing new <br><br>seeing inherent value in novelty is the leading symptom of shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't change the fact that /a/ isn't well placed to judge the artistic merit of a work, especially considering the horrible works that came out of it (recently the album of anime covers, which was horrendous). But anyway, I'm not gonna keep arguing with people wearing blinkers.</br>  <br>This. Thank you based Homu for sending Madoka to America.</br>  <br>madoka's true strengths don't lie in its story telling, though the story is serviceable and even pretty good. Its presentation and aesthetics are far above average and anyone who says different obviously hasn't watched much anime.</br>  <br> baby's first  <br>The implications of this phrase are amusing, and it'll be funny to see it play out.</br></br>  <br>More likely he would have shifted plot significance from Homura to pretty much any other character. The Homura fanbase is the source of 90% of the obnoxious behavior. For example the Sayaka/Madoka friendship could have been developed further.</br>  <br> aesthetics <br>&lt;== Is this good "art"?</br></br>  <br><br>As in she barges in with way too much firepower, ruins everything then refuses to even acknowledge she did anything wrong?</br></br>  <br> For example the Sayaka/Madoka friendship could have been developed further. <br>And the Sayaka/Kyouko yuri relationship.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>    <br>It's meant to look awry and out of this world: it gives the witch the actual appearance of something ugly and illogical, as witches are born from human emotions, which are illnesses from the Incubator's point of view.</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada</br></br>  <br>Yes that would work quite well.</br>  <br>It has several reasons to look like that and it accomplishes its purpose, so yes.</br>  Homu does nothing right and is actually the evil incarnate.<br><br>Sounds very American to me.</br></br>  If your favorite anime character can't pass this test then it is shit. Try to guess each others.  <br><br>He's kind of a loner, but for some reason quite popular with women. He's got kind of a shitty personality in some ways. He's crass, shameless, and not particularly smart. Relationship with his family isn't straightforward.<br><br>He does like wordplay, and it feels like he spends like 90% of his time just hanging out and having ridiculous conversations with his friends. He can be pretty funny.<br><br>People forgive him for a lot of his bullshit because he's genuinely good hearted and selfless.<br><br>His taste in cars is pure shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  "kill em dead!"  <br>rararagi?</br>  he fucked youre mum and he's sitting in my chair in front of my computer right at this instant  Sword autism  <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Looks like RRRG passes.</br></br></br></br>  Tomato  <br>arararrararararra-gi<br><br>he has a catchphrase <br>he can seem ignorant and disinterested of his family and people around him, but he actually deeply cares about them<br>he's a silent person<br>he travels with his gang in rather exotic countries<br> EXTRA <br>a fat, ,dirty,ugly and old cunt with a broken VHS player<br>also does reviews sometimes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he has a silver soul</br>  A gardening tool is her weapon of choice.  <br>He's completely chunni, having a taste for norse mythology, secret organizations and conspiracies. He often makes up things and phrases that mean absolutely nothing, creating in-jokes that only he understands.<br><br>He talks to himself often, mostly to make himself feel cool. He pretends to be an ass sometimes, but is actually pretty kind-hearted and empathetic.</br></br></br>  He's an arrogant jackass who was raised by an arrogant, thieving, drunkard jackass. He has no real friends, only potential romantic interests, rivals, and potential death threats. This includes his own mother. He sucks at school, but is a world-class genius in his one narrow area of specialty. He has an ability to stick his foot so far in his mouth he can taste his kneecap, which manifests at the worst of times. He's willing to kill to save people he cares about.<br><br>Oh, and he turns into a girl when you splash cold water on him.</br></br>  He legitimately cares about other's problems, and will go to extreme lengths to solve them -- even if his solutions come at a cost to his job, image or personal well-being. Doesn't care what anyone thinks and will do what he wants to do and say what he wants to say, even when what he wants to say is vulgar. The truth hurts and he knows it, but says it anyway.<br><br>Really smart but doesn't seem like it to others, exceeds when he tries hard enough.</br></br>  <br>He's manly, he kicks logic out, a rebel to the anyone who stands in his way.</br>  <br><br>Toshino Kyoko.</br></br>  <br> Oh, and he turns into a girl when you splash cold water on him. <br> breaking one of the only OP rules </br></br>  <br>Jotaro.</br>  A chainsmoker with a mysterious past who likes to travel and has impeccable fashion sense.  <br> wrong </br>  <br>Also speaks authoritatively from a wide and deep knowledge base, but often the people he meets are unwilling to take his advice.</br>    <br>Too easy</br>  <br><br>Ginko?</br></br>  Shit.  <br>Currently running show?</br>  He wants to save everyone and that at the end of the day people go home smiling without having lost anything  He lives for thrill and is the best at what he does, is mysterious and demon like. He find no value in material good and money. He values staying himself above everything, even his own life.  <br>yes<br><br>8man<br><br>4 one of main four people gakkou gurashi<br><br>you're waifu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Next review when?</br>  <br>Episode VII is my guess</br>  <br>Hououin Kyouma.<br><br>Sounds like a huge faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>No, what I said applies to him pretty much as well though.<br><br>I'll add something to narrow it down. He smokes, often.</br></br></br>    <br>RLM is shit.</br>  He's the demons.    <br>She's the kindest most pure girl there is. She always does her best for her friends. She carries a heavy burden. Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker</br>  <br>Elsie.<br><br>I sure hope you're not describing Biribiri.</br></br></br>  <br>Elsie</br>  Being more intelligent than his peers make him bored of school, he has a strong and controversial sense of what's right and wrong and is not afraid to say what's on his mind.<br><br>He often comes up with plans that are convoluted and trick anyone trying to defeat him.</br></br>  <br>Biriri carries a heavy burden?<br>No</br></br>  <br>He's a human. Definitely a human.</br>  <br> Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker <br>again, breaking the rules</br></br>    She often comes off as the clown of the group.<br>A glutton with a lighthearted facade, but shoulders great responsibilities.<br>She might not look like it, but she excels at almost anything she does, perhaps not out of choice but because circumstances forced her to.<br>Also ghosts scare her shitless.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou</br>  <br>Correct<br><br>How?</br></br></br>  <br><br> She's the kindest most pure girl there is <br><br>Generic as shit<br><br> She always does her best for her friends <br><br>This like 99% of anime characters <br><br> She carries a heavy burden <br><br>Lots of characters do, or there would be no dramatic conflict <br><br> Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker <br><br>This isn't even about her<br><br>OP was correct, based on this thread most anime characters have absolutely no personality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's too obvious and defeats the purpose. It's like me describing Hei from DtB as "his sister died in an accident". It gives too much away, so just stick to describing the traits of the character.</br>  She's cute.<br>Fuck.</br>  <br> His taste in cars is pure shit. </br>  <br>He's extremely weak and helpless to a point where he hates himself for it.<br>He can still admit these faults to himself and others who are close to him.<br>He actively tries to better himself and do his best to not be a burden.<br>He's incredibly nice, yet almost seems of unaware of just how nice he is.<br><br>Well I did a lot better than I thought I would.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guts?</br></br>  <br> Summerfags don't know this <br><br>Male, teen, socially retarded, honest, brave, protective, not perverted, conservative, skilled, takes extreme measures even if it is not appropriate, slightly masochistic<br><br>Female, teen, pure maiden, violent, tsundere, superficial tendencies, enjoys bossing people around and maintaining social order, wears her heart on her sleeve, has feelings for above male,<br><br>hint:  only summerfags need spoonfeeding </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She's a proud childish goddess forgotten by the people that used to praise her. She's also extremely intelligent and is scared of being alone forever because of her immortality.  <br>Onii-sama?</br>  <br>She seems sort of laidback and nonchalant, if a little cold, and gives no fucks about trivial stuff. In reality, she's actually batshit crazy, probably more afraid of human connection than the fucking NGEs, and only seems casual because she's made a conscious effort to divorce herself from normal concerns in order to not allow herself to be overwhelmed by petty bullshit. Because of this, she doesn't know how to deal with anything except by ignoring it, and if she can no longer ignore it, she can't cope at all and flies off the deep end. Manga, not anime.</br>  <br>Wrong. The female is also easily scared by supernatural things, the male does not believe in such things.</br>  <br> goddess <br>That's a role/profession</br></br>  <br>Or maybe people are shit at describing personalities.</br>  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br>She's a proud childish immortal forgotten by the people that used to praise her. She's also extremely intelligent and is scared of being alone forever because of her immortality.<br>Happy?</br></br>  <br>that girl who is almost deaf mute?</br>  Manga: he is obsessed with social standing and snell. most perceive him as the lowest of the low, and he acknowledges it himself  <br>The one girl with the glasses from Haruhi?</br>  <br>Kyon and Haruhi?</br>  <br>Intelligent, nihilistic with a wicked sense of humor.</br>  She's very talented at what she does, but she's a bit of a slacker. <br><br>She's extremely affectionate with her friends even to the point of making some of them uncomfortable.<br><br>She loves to relax and take it easy to the point that she can be a bit of a slob.<br><br>People think she's stupid, but that's mostly because she just says the first thing that comes to mind without caring. She can be competent if she tries.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody praises her.<br>ex mode: she really likes apples.</br></br>  <br> shirou and rin? </br>  <br>He who crawls in skin.</br>  <br>Yui</br>  Why do most of these vaguely sound like descriptions of otaku in general?  <br>nope. He is physically fit, excellent fortitude and constitution. He is very goal driven, and will never abandon a task, even if it means death. If you gave him the choice of a bow or a sword, he would always choose the ranged option.</br>  <br>Anon-kun</br>  While he seems aloof, he never turns down those who need help, a true altruist who doesn't cares about himself. Has an extremely strong sense of justice, but that justice is his own, never tries to preach or change people's minds about their own beliefs. Has shown that talents are not things you are born with, but are things you earn with hard work and determination. Has a group of close friends that share his ideals and sense of justice.<br><br>Enjoys cleaning parks.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>This is what I was gonna write, so Yui Hirasawa.</br>  He steals the show, figuratively and literally.  <br><br>Because lots of anime characters are designed to be relatable to inadequates.</br></br>  <br>Aquarion Logos or Kuusen Madoushi though neither strike me as msochistic.</br>  He's a whiny kid who thinks he's more mature than he is.  <br>What, Shouko? No. She wasn't cold at all. Hell, Ueno'd probably be closer.</br>  <br>Kiririto for the male and Asuna for the female?</br>  <br>nope. He was born in 1984, has at least three aliases.</br>  He never wins. Ever. No matter how effortlessly he beats down his opponents, in the end he still loses  <br> While he seems aloof, he never turns down those who need help, a true altruist who doesn't cares about himself. Has an extremely strong sense of justice, but that justice is his own, <br>Why does this sound like every other description in this thread</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Scumbag Loser MC</br>  He gets left behind by people leaving to do amazing secret stuff, nobody wants anything out of him, until years later they do, and he's so starved for validation that he ends up happily obeying the people who threw him away like trash.  <br>Kumagawa</br>  He strives to lose neither to rain, wind, snow nor the heat of summer. To have a strong body, unfettered by desire nor moved by anger. Never praised and always ignored.  <br> summerfags don't know this currently airing show <br>I'm not even him, but that's definitely not it.</br></br>  <br>His nationality is not entirely japanese, i.e. mixed race.

Despite her traumas and emotional baggage she usually puts on a strong face and smiles through the suffering. She can be very possessive at times and can be quick to jealousy.  <br>Horo.</br>  <br>Gintoki<br><br>Loud; full of energy; has lofty ambitions that she doesn't really put a lot of effort into pursuing, though she's happy to force her friends into doing things along with her; gets jealous and petty rather easily and doesn't like it when other people spend more time with her friends than she does; loves sweets, being lazy, and pushing responsibilities onto others; huge prankster, loves cracking jokes at the expense of her friends; fairly talented, though with some obvious flaws in her performance that everyone picks up on; sometimes childish and directionless, but slowly learning to be more of an adult because of the influence of her friends.</br></br></br>  <br>elfen lied</br>  He has the  Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu   <br><br><br><br><br><br>All these summerfags.

These traits lead her to befriend some interesting people who will likely become heavily involved in her future career path.<br><br><br>Accelerator</br></br></br>  She's in a perpetual state of being happy and carefree. She's also capable of closing her eyes when being cyber bullied.  <br>Well, you're definitely not talking about edo tensei uchiha madara</br>  <br>Yes. This thread makes me sad.</br>  <br>The fact that it's taking so many tries for people to guess this tells me that these characters are very generic.</br>  <br>what the fuck????</br>  <br> or what their profession/role was <br><br>Why is this so hard?</br></br></br>  <br>Cirno and Kurosawa don't have anime.<br><br><br>They were, up until he started giving a bunch of hints.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rito and Yui?</br>  <br>Paranoid, easily influenced, easily manipulated, can be a bit of sadist, is actually intelligent to the point of being a potential good member for the society, but minor traumas have led to heavy anxiety which resulted in crippled social interactions.

No<br><br> it's an autistic guy who probably touch himself thinking about waterfalls </br></br></br>  <br>Lelouch?</br>  He is a pacifist who will always try to resolve any situation without bloodshed except in the most extreme of cases. He is generally carefree and childish and just wants to coast through life with as little trouble as possible. He is also a hopeless romantic and a sucker for beautiful women. His bad reputation causes him lots of problems even though it's largely undeserved and as a result he's usually on the move so that word of his presence doesn't cause trouble. Despite his carefree attitude and pacifistic beliefs he never allows innocents to be preyed upon but he'll usually vocalize his complaints about being caught up in the situation.  Good guy who tries to be a white knight but ultimately understands that he can only make decisions that he won't regret later. He's pretty weak among his peers and gets constant shit for it, but tries to make up for it by being smart and creative. Sweats in almost every situation.

She fears loneliness and wants her love to be reciprocated, but isn't bitter about it.

I keep hearing either volume 5 or volume 6; is this where it ends or where the manga continues on afterwards? Would I start on 5 or 6? I understand the series skips volume 4 and that the light novel is better but I'll pick both up at a later time.</br></br>  she got raped by a giant wolf xd  <br><br>Since when did Spice and Wolf attract le ironic shitposting?

If you were going to the books then the anime ends after volume 5 (but you should start from the beginning if you're reading the novels at all). Couldn't tell you where the manga gets to "new" material, but I'd assume volume 10 or so.  <br><br>Thanks a ton mate. Just the answer I was looking for. I definitely plan on revisiting the books and light novels when I catch up on the manga. <br><br><br><br>Hype in between releases is painful.
