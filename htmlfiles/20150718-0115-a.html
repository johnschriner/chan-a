[ So, Kawakami posted a link on his twitter to the Sunrise Festival which will screen Horizon. There will be a special event (8/12) before the actual s1 screening (8/26).<br><br>This special event will have a screening of 4 episodes from either s1, s2, or possibly both. These episodes will be decided through votes in 4 specific categories.<br><br>サンライズでよかった部門（一番燃えた部門）<br>(Google is bad but I'm guessing overall best episode?)<br><br>俺の嫁頑張った部門（一番可愛い部門）<br>(Cutest episode?)<br><br>馬鹿がここにおるわ部門（一番笑える部門）<br>(Funniest episode?)<br><br>俺私はこの回好きだ部門（一番泣いた部門）<br>(Saddest episode?)<br><br>The poll is open from July 17 - August 2.<br>The results will be announced by Director Manabu Ono at the event on August 12.<br><br>Thought it might be fun to do.<br><br>Link:https://bvc.bandaivisual.co.jp<wbr>/enquete/105/1/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They even made new promo art? Is this real?</br>  <br>Of course it's real. It's on the official Horizon website if you go there.</br>  Is this the 4th or 5th time we got our hopes up?  <br>I never got my hopes up until now. The other times were generic Dengeki Fes without nothing even pointing to Horizon being on them at all.</br>  <br> 俺私はこの回好きだ部門（一番泣いた部門） <br>(Saddest episode?)<br>I don't think anyone has any doubt what this one will be.<br> Tadakatsu. ;_; </br></br></br></br>  Would you?   MC is 1-3 years older than his sister <br> during the baby episode 'Oh, I remember exactly how to take care of this because of taking care of my sister' </br>   show is complete shit <br> main girl is super cute <br><br>I don't know if I can withstand this trash show just for her</br></br></br>  <br>Do it for her, Anon.</br>  <br>Do it for king and cumtry</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br>Eh, sometimes it is worth it<br><br>I got through KnK just for Mirai and it was something I don't regret. She was stupidly cute.</br></br></br>  <br> super cute <br>What? She's below average in cuteness.<br>Anyways the faggot shotas ruined it.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br> tfw I realize how often I do this <br><br>Watched R+V for Mizore. No regrets<br><br> Okay, maybe some regret. </br></br></br></br></br>   confession in the 2nd episode    the kingdom gets to democratically vote for their king (how the fucks does that even work?) <br> the first prince is a hard-working, stable man well respected by all with ideas for the future <br> "NO LETS ALL VOTE FOR THE SHY, USELESS PRINCESS BECAUSE WE GOT A PANTSU FLASH ^____^" <br><br>this is whats wrong with democracy.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br> he watches Shitmoneta <br>you're not one to talk</br></br>  I hear nothing but complaints about this show. Do I have shit taste for actually liking it? I know it's nothing special, but it's fun.  <br>The anime makes it pretty clear that they don't give a shit about making the setting even mildly realistic. <br><br>Just enjoy the pantsu and incent jokes</br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br>Nigga pls, Owari no Seraph was totally worth it.</br>  <br> Do I have shit taste for actually liking it? <br> wanting to fit in <br>Grow a spine niggah</br></br></br>  <br> show is shit <br> main girl is super cute <br> main girl gets majority of the screentime <br> tfw the show is, then, actually not shit </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm ashamed to say that some elections actually turn out that way.</br>  <br> just for Mirai <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>  <br>I admit, I came THIS close to watching that trash vampire show for her.<br>But then Idid some timing and realized that wasting half an hour on a shit show just for a couple of minutes, if not seconds, of her is not worth it. That's what other people's webms are for.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br> implying you dislike the anime if there is a girl best enough to keep you watching  <br> implying i have anything better to do or watch </br></br>  <br>The important thing is that they're a child of the king. I don't think it's actually a completely terrible idea to have an election of royal blood, and if you're including females, their husband would just have to forfeit his surname to continue the royal name.<br><br>The most important thing in a monarchy is for the potential heir to be groomed as a ruler, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> not watching for the real best girl </br>    <br>I want Akane to be gang raped by every camera</br>  <br>She looks like every long black haired anime girl ever, though</br>  <br>The concept of the show too deep for you?<br>Shit is meant to be fun and lighthearted.</br></br>  <br>Not to mention<br> confession was pretty much accepted <br> they just have to wait a year to start dating <br><br>I have genuinely not been this surprised at an anime for years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143641 <br>Exactly. If I like a show, but the rest of /a/ doesn't, it won't let it ruin my experience. That's just stupid</br>  <br> implying this isn't true for 3D japs <br><br>This is why personality matters. Because there's nothing else to go on.</br></br></br>  <br>You make that sound like a bad thing.</br>  <br> Some <br>The whole process of election is a glorified popularity contest where the parties just go all over the country doing everything they can to gain the people's favor regardless of actually being good or not.<br>A lot of them might not even write their own speeches.<br>Anyone with enough charisma could win and become leader by just telling the people what they want to hear while backing it up with bullshit even the lowest denominator could understand or at least empathize.<br>The problem with democracy is that no one can undo the clusterfuck of shit left behind by the previous leader in four years, which in itself was past down by the previous previous leader, WHICH in turn was passed down by the previous previous PREVIOUS leader.<br>Every election is well meaningful promises, then when your ass gets elected you spend the next four years trying to unto the decades old messes and have no time or way to actually punch in those promises.<br>Rinse and repeat for the next dumb schmuck that wants a turn.<br>The fall of monarchy was a terrible mistake.<br>Sure there was that asshole king that would pop up in some generation down the line, but I'd be more at ease having a dude literally born and bred for politics be a leader than a college drop out that thought "gee why not?" <br><br>Also every girl is best girl in this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she's cute as fuck tbh</br>  <br>3D Japs are also shit, though. Personality is shit tier too.</br>  <br> I have genuinely not been this surprised at an anime for years. <br>Anon, is this sarcasm? I just have to ask because I kinda expected him to turn her down in that way. As an example the whole baseball player focusing on training and turning down cute girls had me see this coming a mile away.</br></br>  I watched both seasons of Free just for Gou.<br><br>I think you can handle it.</br></br>  <br> Also every girl is best girl in this show. <br>That's what a communist would say.</br></br>  <br>Do you have a mental illness? Is this supposed to be b8?</br>  <br>I was watching some jap porn the other day and I couldn't take my eyes of the girl's black hair.</br>  <br>Is there something wrong with not liking 3D women?</br>  <br>He didn't turn her down though. He didn't say he would answer after the election, he said he would accept her feelings then.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but the idea that you could even put a blanket statement so wide onto an entire race of people that has nothing to do with cultural standards or genetic tendencies is a little strange.</br>  <br>Why not, we put a blanket statement on an entire dimension around here. Casual racism be small time.</br>  <br> not voting for the one that can see the future meaning he could literally always make the best possible decision </br>  <br>Whoa there, it isn't a race thing. I don't like any 3D women. Hell, you can even add males and all animals to the list, too.</br>  <br>Why everyone doesn't vote for the loli, I'd never understand. If all of our world leaders were lolis then we'd already have world peace.</br>  <br>Right anon. You just don't like real women. You could totally get one if you wanted but just choose to stay a single virgin forever</br>  <br>Exactly<br><br>Now can we go back to talking about how cute Mirai is?</br></br></br>  <br>Is harem for gud of cuntry to gud for you, comrade?<br>Akane iz bashful and endearing, da?

Genuinely curious, I've never heard of a woman referred to as king before.

The emem cartel is trying to keep weeb-style subs off of Nyaa if they can get away with it, starting with minor series like Dandelion.</br>  <br>The only question I have during this show:<br><br>Why doesn't she just wear pants? Or, if she wants to keep her skirt on, spats?</br></br></br>  <br>Spasibo comrade! Did not find appropriate size when internets searching!</br>  <br>Lol nice conspiracy, /pol/ is that way you know. <br>I'll take meme subs over weebsubs, at least memsubs are in english.</br></br>    <br> Implying that actually stops it </br>  I wonder if there are anti-monarchists in this show.<br><br>Are they like this?<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fxGq<wbr>cCeV3qk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Onii-sama does it on purpose doesn't he? </br>  <br> not reading it <br> inb4 some fag whines that it was better as a monster of the week comedy even though it retained the comedy element to the end </br></br>  <br>Too bad commie dropped the show since they were too lazy to typeset all the signs in the first episode.</br>  <br>There is probably nothing worse than being an anime snob</br>  <br>Was she only introduced second episode?</br>  <br>You could be a LN snob</br>  <br><br>It would certainly help, I think Onii-chan would be less inclined to steal an entire pair of pants over just a skirt.<br><br>Plus, I'm assuming he doesn't track her down while she's flying just to steal her clothes. Then again, I've not read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has to wear the skirt. Its part of the school uniform and she must adhere to the strict dress code six days a week.<br>The times where she can actually change it around and wear something like spats or hose she is at the risk of Onii-sama teleport shenanigans. <br>My guess at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Is black hair appealing to westerners?</br>  <br>If you live in a country where its uncommon, then yeah it might.<br>Why do you think anime has such diverse hair colors? All they see is black every day.<br>Though, black hair is great it matches with everything. You know what they say "You can have it in any color you want, as long as its black"</br></br></br>  What the fuck just happened the last episode? Why was her brother switching names? He was, right? That was her brother, right? He was fucking teleporting. Am i just a retard.  <br> I'm a Chinese immigrant in Canada, and I really like blonde hair.  </br>  <br>I can't even understand what you're asking because of your retarded hysterics. Calm down and try again.</br>  <br>Who was that fucker? Who am I? Who was shoe?</br>  <br>I don't know why everyone praises the manga when it was shit too. Sure, it was better than the anime but that's a really low standard.<br><br>And the comedy aspect was for the most part significantly lowered as it went on. It was a completely different manga by the end.</br></br></br>   KAIMONO     + I like the artstyle a lot<br>+ It's not seasonal generic haremshit #7456812<br>+ It has not one, not two, but NINE best girls  and boys <br>+ The stupid semen joke made me legit spit out my drink out of sheer surprise<br><br><br>It's an A in my book.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you hide this shit from me, I know you know.</br>    <br> having all-access to Akane even when she's out for kaimono <br>My dick can't handle this</br></br>  It took me a long time before I watched the first episode, and I liked it when I watched it, but as soon as I finished it, I didn't want to watch more. <br><br>What's wrong with me?</br></br>  <br>Who was he? Who was that fucker with the limp and the dumb look on his face?</br>  <br> show is complete shit <br>fight me you little fag.</br></br>  <br> NINE best girls and boys <br> Implying. <br> I see you forgot to count the all the Misaki clones </br></br></br>  You will never get to tell Akane there's a  camera  in her closet  I think I'd rather listen to 20 minutes of Akane's VA saying Camera than watch this every week  I do that all the time whenever there is a super cute girl. Whenever the cute girl shows up, it motivates me to keep watching no matter what. That's what got me through Tari Tari.  I think this is the first anime I've seen where the truck driver got out of his vehicle.

So Shuu actually joins Kana just because it's Kana?</br>  <br>They're usually a bit more reliable subs-wise compared to Commie but it was noticeably off this week. <br><br><br>Not at home. Maybe I'll go through it again to see what stuck out tonight.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They're usually a bit more reliable subs-wise compared to Commie <br>Please kill yourself<br><br>At least you wear a trip so everyone can filter your retardation</br></br></br></br>  <br> Doki <br>2/10 you got me to reply</br></br>  <br> Funi <br>0/10<br>Enjoy eating shit</br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br> reliable <br>You must be high or just outright retarded.<br><br>I'll any time take a meme or two in my subs over the utter translation nightmare garbage that Funi or Daisuki subs are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;the kingdom gets to democratically vote for their king (how the fucks does that even work?) <br>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_mona<wbr>rchy</wbr></br></br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br> &gt;show is complete shit <br><br>Your taste is complete shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Based on my own experiences Funisubs trigger my translator senses much less frequently than Commie's do. Both are just as likely to misinterpret lines but Commie's the only one of the two that offends with their overly liberal translations with no regard for characterization and context.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  I can't believe that small mom is everyone's mom.<br><br>Immersion ruined.</br></br>  wow the second episode felt really comfy, much better than the clusterfuck of episode 1, I'm glad I didn't drop it.  <br>Thank you sir.</br>  <br>That exposition game in ep 1 is the most annoying shit ever.</br>  <br>These pages don't match up with any of the raws I found.

In my experience, it's easiest to insert as the girl, imagining you're being held in Shu's strong arms and welcomed into a big fun home by a loving future mother-in-law. The pain can go away entirely until the next episode preview is over.</br>  <br>I can't control who I self insert as so I tend to get really depressed</br>  <br>I want to film a porno with Akane.</br>  <br>This tbh<br><br>I'm pretty sure "afraid of cameras" is my new fetish of the month</br></br></br>  <br>Does she know about it from the start or is it better to have hidden cameras be revealed mid dicking so they can capture a new level of moembarrassment?</br>  <br>Fuck you. Cameras have only pure and innocent surveillance purposes.</br>  <br>*cuntry</br>  <br>Damn, I've never seen a girl with simple yet straightforward personality who had guts to confess in her debut. I'm impressed, but I still slightly prefer Kanade though.</br>  <br>I want to see her get desperate for his attention.</br>  <br>Not even the best sister, you fucking pleb.</br>  <br>Don't worry, Anon. I feel the same way. Also, for Shiori, as She's just too cute.</br>  <br>fuck im the same. They are super beautiful, they have nice clothes, their worries are totally different than the commonfolk, they have money<br><br>I hate them</br></br></br>  <br>Good. Twincest is even better than incest.</br>  I've heard things going both ways. Is there yuri in this or not. I saw a manga page where one girl kisses another girl on the cheek when she was sleeping. But I don't know if that actually leads to anything.<br><br>So, my question is, is there actual requited yuri in the series? Maybe a side couple or something. Because I see it tagged as "Shoujo Ai" and manga updates. And leaving side how wrong the term "shoujo ai" is they are notoriously wrong on that site.</br></br>  <br>Sasuga, yurifag.</br>  <br>Was there really even a point for you to reply with such meaningless post?</br>  <br>Shiori kisses Akane when she's sick and it makes her feel better.<br>Akane kisses Akane when she's sick and it makes her feel worse.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't even self insert into games with custom creation, let alone a character with an established personality and backstory.</br></br>  <br>not reading manga or Ln it is way faster and less painful</br>  <br>The point is that you should fuck off back to /u/, you fucking cancer.</br>  <br>this if you can't do it for her you might as well give up</br>  <br> the first prince is a hard-working, stable man well respected by all with ideas for the future <br>Shu has zero interest in becoming King, doesn't work towards that goal at all and only motivation is to sabotage Kanade so she doesn't become king.</br></br>  Who else is enjoying the show? Probably one of my favourites this season with how relaxed it is. I want to see more of their powers though. Having another game would be fun, hopefully with less exposition dumping though.<br><br><br> replying to an 11 hour old posts of some idiot taking this shit way too seriously <br>Anon please</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Queen would be 女王(jo-ou), although it might have king's wife connotation.</br></br>  <br>Doing God's work anon.<br><br>Shuu best shoe and boy confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>I miss this MC.</br>  <br>I hope that tomboy appears more</br>  New episode in a few hours.  <br>Is this your fetish</br>  <br>subs Monday ;_;</br>  <br> For cum and country! <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Side question, wasn't the super powers proof of being royalty?<br><br>If so why does some random jackoff have a teleport power?</br></br>  Okay, about Hikari's power, God Hand.<br>Isn't it dangerous?<br>Think about it, she has complete control of life with her touch.<br>What if she decided to age you 1000 years, making you turn into skeleton dust? Or what if she made you so young you'd go passed fetus to non conception and cease to exist?<br>Would you stay dead/nonexistent after 24 hours or would turn back/pop back into existence again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br><br>Life is full of dangerous things. Even if she can kill you, it's not that hard for people to die.</br></br>  <br>That would be pretty neat. Ask her to age you do death so you can experience death and then pop back into existence and talk about what it was like.</br>  <br>I think you pop back into existance again because it works more like a reset than a shed enhancements.Like the tree must've just shrank out of nowhere instead of all the excess bark and leaves coming off.</br>  <br>Yeah but the tree was still "alive"<br>If its dead can it really turn back after the 24 hour mark?<br>Could she temporarily bring people back from the dead?</br></br></br>  <br>Torn's doing it. All the typesetting is {\an8} though.</br>  <br>I guess that if she puts you on the brink of death via her powers and you die of japanese cold, then you stay dead because it wasn't her powers that killed you.</br>  Akane in proper twintails made my dick perpetually hard  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Which chapter is this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tom <br>Who?</br></br>  wasnt there a movie with a big family  <br>tomboys are best fetish</br>  <br>Ron.<br><br>Avoid.</br></br></br>    <br>Actually, it seemed the royalty's superpowers is a well-known fact in this universe, right?</br>  15 mins  <br>The shitty "wannabe based Onii-sama's gf" girl is pretty much the only thing ruining the enjoyment of this series for me. <br>Why can't we just have the family shenanigans happen and leave out the common pleb?</br></br>  <br>It does not sound way more dangerous than having a gun. It can kill people as well and from distance, nonetheless.</br>  Seraph no Owari<br><br>Only reason to pick it up is Shinoa</br></br>  5 mins<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu just ending, decent show</br>  <br>I feel like by the time I watch the latest episode of this show and new one is released 1-2 days later because of how slow the subs are.

It needs a change of author.

Personally i'd watch the show if it was just about based onii-sama.</br>  <br><br>Well, or an onee-chan that can Geass. But this doesn't change the fact that most of the voting population are old geezers?</br></br>   constantly surrounded by all these semen demons   Can someone with such sever agoraphobia be described as shy?    I think Hikari accidentally used her magic on me and made part of me larger. Strangely it didn't last 24 hours.  <br>I highly doubt it.</br>  <br> the king is tall, broad, and handsome <br><br>My goodness, no wonder the queen was fine with having 9 kids despite being half his size.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't want Kanade to be the next King. How would he do that? It doesn't seem like he want's to be king, so not by becoming king himself. Rather, he would raise the popularity of the the person behind her in polarity to king.</br></br>  <br>  the person behind her in popularity to king. <br>Either Aoi (#1) or Akane (#2).  At the end of Volume 1, Akane rises to #1. </br></br>  <br>Ahh, I got Aoi and Kanade mixed up.</br>  <br> Shuu and Aoi both support Akane. </br>  <br>sauce</br>  <br>What a faggot, he should have assumed the throne just like a proper first crown prince instead of running from his responsibility and burdening his autistic imouto even further .</br>  <br> implying those are all his kids </br>  <br> just like a proper first crown prince <br>Many monarchies already practices absolute primogeniture, which means the first child succeeds the throne regardless of sex.<br><br>So in that case, Aoi gets to be the King.</br></br></br></br>   ** 2,778 place / ** 2,575 place (***, 107 pt) [*, ** 0 Reserved] 2015/09/30 Castle town of Dandelion vol.1   <br><br>In that case he will try to make it a 2 man race and increase the distance between second and third place.</br></br>  I really don't like this government. They live in a japanese town, yet live in a european chateau, the queen is used like a breeding sow, the ruling family are mutants who are also reality TV stars, and nothing is ever mentioned of the country's ability to defend itself from foreign interests, or what the royal family's role in government is. <br><br>Pretty much, this is all disgustingly bourgeois. I'll pick this back up if mutant Lenin comes into the picture.</br></br>  <br> the royal family's role in government <br>It's an absolute monarchy.</br></br>  <br>Pig Disgusting. Burn it down.</br>  <br> the queen is used like a breeding sow <br>I would let that king use me like a breeding sow.</br></br>  <br>That line of thinking is so stupid that even the characters in your picture that are supposed to argue it are being called stupid.</br>  <br>It is foolishness, to the unenlightened.

Aoi's in college, too. I think Hikari's going to be entering middle school while Misaki and Haruka will be entering high school by the end of volume 3.</br>  <br>Ah, in fairness, this does take place in volume one, so the guy that said he was six is still right.</br>  <br> Shuu's eyes <br>Looks like he just changed his mind from diving in the ocean to diving deep into Akane.</br></br>  <br>Think Hikari's slightly bigger than Akane even though she's 10/11<br><br>Perfect flatness</br></br></br>  <br>not quite perfect flatness</br>  <br>Yep, she'll outgrow Akane by the time she's 12 or 13.</br>  <br>This anime is truly deep in regards to facial expressions. Take this for example, at first glance it looks like it's just an uncaring face. But then you think deeper and you realise the dad knows Hikari's plan is fucking stupid and won't work.<br><br><br>She just looks slightly bigger in that bit for some reason, she's flat everywhere else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine.</br>  <br> Hikari almost as big as Hana, if not bigger <br>This girl's going to be the titty monster of the family.</br></br>  <br>Sad to hear that.</br>  God bless this artist.  <br>I don't like the sweat.</br>  <br> that chest size <br>Is she Aika 2.0?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Why is Shuu such a giant in this pic</br>  <br>Accurate scaling.</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>More second daughter.</br>  <br>I assume he's talking about Shuu and Kanade being twins too since they are in the same year/class.<br><br>Are they?

The mangaka hit home with the cute character designs and  Kanade and Akane being best </br></br></br>  Reminder that against all odds, Lelouch died (yes, *died*; deal with it) a virgin. He died a virgin despite the facts that:<br><br>- Sex is not some taboo in this series. Fucking Ohgi got pussy (then betrayed him and became Prime Minister of Japan).<br><br>- He was surrounded by tons of beautiful, sexy women that wanted his dick, including CC, a succubus who has been giving out the ass for centuries.<br><br>- He has the power to make anyone do whatever he wants. But as we all know, rape is far worse than murder.<br><br>Even the most wimpy, dense, retarded, and gynophobic of protagonists get laid or eventually will. Lelouch is revolutionary in this regard, as he is none of these and still didn't get any. A protagonist for the ages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   died <br><br>Bullshit.</br></br>  he got fucked by murphy's law all the time, though.  <br>Maybe he just wasn't interested?</br>  <br>Seemed it. Didn't mean he me couldn't have taken a quick dip anyway.</br>  <br>He only wanted his little sister.</br>  <br>Nigger, Lelouch didn't die. <br>First of all it is necessary to explain how the "code" is obtained by using Charles Vi Britannia, Lelouch's dad, and C.C. as an example. Charles' geass had already evolved into the advanced version, i.e. where it shows up on both his eyes, by the time the viewer get to know him. In addition, C.C. did also evolve her eyes before she received the code. In both cases Charles and C.C. killed their predecessors by using the power of their advanced versions of geass. C.C.'s predecessor also states this condition herself. <br>There is also another condition set before the code activates - one has to die. In the scene where C.C.'s predecessor tricks C.C., C.C. is wounded around her chest area with blood fussing out. Furthermore, Charles' code activates at the moment Lelouch orders him to die. <br>As in these two cases, Lelouch receives the code in a similar way, thus obtaining true immortality. When Charles grabbed onto his throat he was technically killed by Lelouch - he dissipated in this case - thereby passing on the code from parent to child. It also gives a lot sense that Lelouch receives the geass from Charles who is his father, and thus is the successor of both his ability, the code, and the throne. <br>However, it's important to point out that he didn't activate the code until the last episode where the last condition, involving the bearer's dead, was fulfilled at the moment Suzaku killed him. This realization alone is a very strong argument in that Lelouch is actually alive and immortal at that. There is further evidence supporting this point.<br>One should remark that C.C. also have the mark of the code on her forehead, while Charles has it on his hand. So Lelouch most likely has it on another part of his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not so sure about that.</br>  <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br>2015 and still believing he died.</br>  <br>Was this from that ntr doujin where CC and Kallen randomly get stolen by Britanians, and Diethard set that up to happen to deliberately make Zero no longer interested in women since the two closest to him betray him?</br>  <br> died </br>  <br>“An intellectual is someone who has found something more interesting than sex.” <br>― Edgar Wallace</br></br>  <br>Reminder that it's real.</br>  Kallen is a cuck.  Doesn't Akito the Exiled confirm he's alive though or am I fucking up timelines?  <br> I don't need pussy even if nobody wants to give it to me and I'll prove it by posting a pretentious quote by literally who! </br>  <br> died </br>  <br><br>He's alive.<br><br> Pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone fucking asks the same shit.<br><br> wat guise y is lelouch alive y is the world bad again guise idk how to google lol <br><br>It's an interquel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akito is between season 1 and season 2.<br><br>So it's 1.5</br></br></br>  <br>cry more :^)<br><br>I see, that makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly. I don't like NTR so I wouldn't know.</br>  <br>Why is Lelouch by himself, even withstanding suzaku, so much more interesting than all the rest of the cast of Akito? What is it about him?</br>  <br><br>Only good doujins are doujins with pizzabutt</br></br>  <br>He was boning CC in between battles all the fucking time, it just wasn't an important part of the story or characters so the show didn't waste time on it.</br>  <br>It's not that he's terribly interesting, the rest of Akito is boring as fuck</br>  <br>Present proof.</br>  <br>Interesting due to complexity, no, but interesting due to the entertainment value he provides is definitely a characteristic of his. Akito the exiled has such a bland cast so far. If the mech fights weren't great eyecandy I might've dropped it. Also Leila's body.</br>  <br>I had pussy and my world did not change. Except that dealing with cunts is not worth my time. I'd now rather tap my Ona Hole. I just want to state that lelouch might just had his priorities set on something more worthwhile than fucking.<br><br>Although its rather unrealistic he just never had an opportunity to fuck. Blame it on the writers not to incorporate every shit, why didn't they also show him taking a shit. I don't remember Lelouch having to take a shit once.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Someone's gotta go rewatch  <br><br>It's pretty well implied. See the scene at the end of the anime, like episode 24, where Kallen interrupts C.C. and Lelouch's romantic moment. Possibly the only romantic scene Lelouch ever had in terms of sexual implications the entire show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't he into dudes?</br>  <br>It is a super power to Geass. Were any Geass users shown taking a shit? I think I am seeing a pattern here.</br>  <br>Erinnerung, dass gegen alle Widrigkeiten, starb Lelouch (ja, * * starb; deal with it) einer Jungfrau. Er starb als Jungfrau trotz der Tatsachen, dass:<br>- Sex ist nicht irgendein Tabu in dieser Serie. Ficken Ohgi bekam Muschi (dann verriet ihn und wurde Premierminister von Japan).<br>- Er wurde von Tonnen schön, sexy Frauen, die seinen Schwanz wollte, einschließlich CC, ein Sukkubus, denen geben hat den Arsch Jahrhunderten umgeben.<br>- Er hat die Macht, die jeder machen, was er will. Aber wie wir alle wissen, ist Vergewaltigung weit schlimmer als Mord.<br>Selbst die wimpy, dichte, verzögert, und gynophobia der Protagonisten bekommen gelegt oder schließlich wird. Lelouch ist revolutionär in diesem Zusammenhang, wie er ist keiner von diesen und noch keine bekommen. Ein Protagonist für die Ewigkeit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a psychopath, or schizoid. Enough said.</br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br><br>Please, plebian. <br><br> literally who <br>Please leave. Your kind aren't welcome here. You're both a virgin AND have never done anything significant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a wise man once said, and Lelouche clearly embodies the philosophy "I don't need your pussy, bitch. I'm on my own dick."</br>  <br>There was a point where he did say Euphemia may have been the only woman he ever truly loved.</br>  <br><br>I don't think you understand sexual romance vs love</br></br>  <br>Like you said there was a point where he stated this, however you can see that he loved Shirley as well by the time she died and of course if you pay attention Lelouch promised to make C.C. happy as she didn't manage to die. To maintain this promise he has to live.</br>  <br><br>C.C. also promised to be the only one to be by his side after he lost everyone/everyone hated him<br><br>Not even Suzaku was really by his side. Those last two months were probably a lot of fun. Nothing but fucking in Emporer Charle's bed</br></br></br></br>  posting best girl  <br>You can't prove he didn't get any off screen.<br>Just like you can't prove he did. It's pretty much like God tbh.</br></br>  <br><br>CUCK</br></br>  <br><br>Lelouch died a virgin as a mortal, that is correct, but then he woke up and thus eventually became non-virgin with C.C. <br><br>It's all old Code Geass talk though so whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br> It's either/or! <br>Typical rationalizing loser.</br></br></br>  <br>calm down, you're all losers</br>  <br> Lelouch  <br> dead <br>I'll bet you he is in the shadows that will come out once suzaku fucks up.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people can't accept it, like accepting Lelouch being a dead virgin.</br>  <br><br>Honestly his plan makes no sense anyway. The world will just turn into a new cycle 50 years later. The plan is so unLelouch that he has to be alive for it to make any sense at all. His entire plan was to become immortal. That is the Zero Requiem.</br></br>  <br>Too bad he won't be deflowering her. Then again, he seemed like the crazy overprotective type that wouldn't let guys near her.</br>  <br><br>This post is bad and you should feel bad. Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen anyway.<br><br>Then again the only intelligent girl in the entire show is C.C.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Every 50 years Zero comes back and topples the order </br>  <br><br> Lelouch along with his waifu C.C. return every 50 years to restore peace <br><br>I would watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit. Now I get it he became immortal, so he can become Zero every time humility fucks up again and resumes the title. Like Jesus.</br>  <br> Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen <br> either worst girl when garbage like Nina and Anya exists <br>Calm down, CCfag.</br></br></br>  <br>You seem to be missing the point that he won't do shit until Nunally actually dies. Why? because he fooled Suzaku by telling that he is influenced by the geass called "people's dreams" in order to make Suzaku also accept that Geass, therefore accepting his own inability to die at will. At the same time he assures a guardian for his sister Nunnally.</br>  <br><br> Implying those are even girl characters <br><br>Nina has a penis, and Anya is a otherkin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is how you turn Code Geass into a milkable franchise like Gundam while never losing out on the entertainment Lelouch provides.</br></br>  <br><br>One, Lelouch knows all about cycles. Pay attention. <br><br>The cycle will take place in a better status quo. That's the point of the plan. <br><br>Not eternal peace or forcing people into submission forever.<br><br>Lelouch isn't against future conflict as a form of evolution/progress. <br><br>Even if he were alive, the guy isn't going to micromanage the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have to be Lelouch, but they certainly will make more Code Geass both with and without him.</br>  <br><br>C.C. and Lelouch are the two main selling points of Code Geass.<br><br>Having both of them in the next series would boost sales/profits 200x</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if he had sex wouldn't he lose his wizard powers?</br>  <br>They are the two main selling points of THIS Code Geass yet there is nothing stopping them from making a different, equal or better one with others. Except for the mental inflexibility of some (thankfully not all) fans.<br><br>It's not like I dislike either of them, mind you.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Being stupid enough to think he died <br><br>Faking your death is far easier than the bullshit he was doing all series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would certainly be better with Lelouch.<br><br>It will also boost the plot twists and entertainment value. If only they had a way to include Suzaku into later entries</br></br></br>  <br>Akito fucking blows though, it's like looking at Shinn from SEED Destiny. So I hope they abandon that shit soon.</br>  <br>That part in the episode was fantastic.<br><br> You will never have C.C comfort your worst moments of dread and despair </br></br></br>  <br> faceless cart man <br> CC calls out to Lelouch from the back as she looks up <br> "HURR LELOUCH DIED DEAL WITH IT" </br></br></br>  <br><br> Hearing C.C. speak a couple lines in Akito 3 gave me the only reason to buy it <br><br>I'm truly a pleb.<br><br><br><br>Of course it was. Wish there was more moments like that on screen. Kallen always interrupted them. Hopefully Kallen cuck gets gone in R3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, he doesn't do things the easy way and so he's a dead virgin.</br>  Kuuderes are underwhelming.  <br>Explain this then if Lelouch died why is the paper crane atop the carrier, behind C.C. C.C. wouldn't bring such a thing and it most certainly is a symbol of Nunnally's and Lelouch's relationship. It is even a pink paper crane, a paper crane which was given by Nunnally to Lelouch in one of the early episodes.</br>  <br>I am this anon<br><br>And I agree that they could make a better one. They just need to have better fleshed out cast than they have with Akito so far. From episode 1 Lelouch and C.C. were intriguing and Akito hasn't managed that in three hours of movie, other than mild curiosity.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder they will be there for each other, making each other happy, until the end of days  <br>Re-read my post.</br>   2015 <br> Still caring about Code Gayass and Ledouche </br>  <br> tfw no Kuudere Neesan <br><br>I would slaughter so much for this to be a reality</br></br></br>  <br><br>C.C. folded that pink paper crane. Not that I believe Lelouch is dead anyway. The paper crane symbolizes her relationship with Lelouch. Her wish to be happy, with him.</br></br>   you'll never have a space-based future version of the geass world where lelouch returns as a centuries-old version of CC and gives geass to someone   <br> 2015 <br> NGE posts every day <br><br>It's like people enjoy these shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I just realized that. My bad.</br>  <br>Lelouche was an incestuous siscon that was also a purefag. He only had one opportunity to fuck and that was at his lowest point. He just wanted to fuck his sisters but couldn't bring himself to.</br>  <br><br> Implying they would ever show C.C. and Lelouch fucking on screen <br> Implying they would ever go beyond implicating it to keep the balance of sales </br></br></br>  <br>You're talking nonsense. <br><br>Akito is fine. It's also not the only possibility there is to make something different. Just one of them.<br><br>I don't think you know what was the problem with SEED Destiny or even remember who Shinn was</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Akito is certainly not fine with only 3 minutes of C.C screentime mate. <br><br> 3 minutes of C.C. screentime to last me from 2008 to 2015 <br><br>I should just off myself now. I'm going back to r9k</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget what he wanted all along.</br>  When do you think another will come out?  <br> I'm truly a pleb. <br><br>Yes you are. I did like seeing C.C. in Akito but it wasn't the only reason I imported it.<br><br> R3 <br><br>Well, that confirms it. Dude, get real.<br><br>That's never going to happen. Also, celebrate C.C. without being so irrationally against Kallen for once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lelouch didn't die a virgin. He was fucking Suzaku.</br>  <br><br> No Kallen means more screentime for C.C. <br><br>Never anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not CC. It's that little chinese girl.<br><br>Kallen gets raped and loves it. Then uypon seeing how great it is, the little girl packs herself into a suitcase.<br><br>Diethard sends Lelouch videos of slave CC and chinese girl doing sex slave stuff to keep him motivated.<br><br>Pretty good. Also the originator of that giant fucking penis image with all the women worshipping it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on each person. I think the issue is Kazuki Akane had some very particular interests about what he wanted to do with Akito. It's pretty nuanced, characters included, just in a less overt way. <br><br>Perhaps it would potentially work better on TV, not necessarily as an OVA. <br><br>Thus some people are open to his interests, like me, and others aren't, both for understandable reasons and just due to knee-jerk reactions or impatience.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sauce. I gotta read dis</br></br>    The Geassbowl was the first time I ever came to 4chan and happened to my first real I really actively watched anime  <br><br> There is a small smile on my face whenever I see a code geass thread because of that </br></br>  <br>It's on Doujin moe. I forget the name. There aren't that many so just search Code Geass and look for Kallen and the chinese girl.</br>  <br> &gt;No Kallen means more screentime for C.C. <br><br>But that's false. And quite petty.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to your own anime Deidara.</br>  <br><br>No it's not. Also don't push your plebian values onto me. Kallen and every selfish nip character in the show were awful. They cared for nothing but themselves and their own selfish values. Kallen is even worse than Brohgi.<br><br>Does anyone happen to have the Brohgi copy pasta?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That doujin is overrated. Your description is also wrong but fuck that.</br>  <br>why would you call that fucking trash Brohgi. Are you trying to make me mad, you son of a bitch?</br>  <br>CC had no attachment to cranes, that was purely Lelouch`s thing, as an attachment to Nunnally. There is no reason for CC to fold it, as it would not have even meant anything to Lelouch as far as his relationship with CC is concerned. Likewise, CC had no real attachment to Nunnally except insofar as she accommodated Lelouch`s attachment.</br>  <br>I agree, but he asked for it.<br><br>Was my description wrong? That's about how I remembered it.</br></br></br>  <br>True patricians aren't so insecure that they need to put others down, anon. <br><br>Your hostility towards every girl who isn't C.C. has been noted before. It's also pointless of you to accuse Kallen of being selfish when C.C., Lelouch and literally everyone else was also the same. Just for different reasons. This isn't a show about selfless angels at all. <br><br>And thus now you're just talking crap for no real purpose. C.C. is awesome, indeed, but unfortunatelyyou aren't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Literally the first scene of episode 2 with Lelouch, C.C, and Nunally <br><br>I suggest you got rewatch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just haven't found Leila and Akito to be as entertaining as Lelouch and C.C. Which was a factor for me. I think Akito has a lot of potential to blow me out of the water still and I hope it does. Leila's Geass is interesting and if they expanded on that a fair amount, my opinion of Akito as a whole would improve. Akito has been interesting, while R1 and R2 were entertaining.</br>   Mfw Brohgi cucks Lelouch and all of Britannia   <br>I wouldn't disagree, in terms of them not being incredibly entertaining, since they're not even the same type of characters either. I understand what you mean, but just like I watch a lot of anime that doesn't have anyone like C.C. or Lelouch, I have no major issues watching Akito except for the delays being so long. That's the structural issue. I am sure the next Code Geass will be something else entirely, in any case, so we'll see what happens.</br>  <br> Deidara </br>  <br>If you ignore Lelouch pretty much won even in "death" that is</br>  <br>You say this as if CC, and Lelouch for that matter, aren't two of the most selfish characters in the series. She used Lelouch and was deal with Chales so she could die, and he shouldn't be explained.</br>  <br><br>C.C. is rightfully selfish. She has lived for almost a thousand years<br><br>Lelouch is a right cunt though but I respect him anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>found you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. The characters are different and that is fine. It has other good factors such as great fights, some light-hearted fanservice, and interesting mech design. Plus, at this point, there is a lot of intrigue as to the scale and some of the motivations of the characters. My biggest complaint is how long the gypsy part felt in comparison to everything else. Some of the gypsy stuff was good, Leila backstory and Akito bonding with Leila, but other parts of it felt like it dragged too much such as the chores and too much focus on molesting the one guy.</br>  Real talk though how much money do you think Lelouch stole from the government or whoever before he and CC took off? Enough to live just ok for a couple a centuries I think.  <br> he got fucked by murphy's law all the time, though. <br>seriously. he was the walking living proof of murphy's law. imagine if everything went according to plan, just once. The show would have ended 40 episodes earlier.</br></br>  <br> Still thinking Lelouch is dead <br> Actually believing that dying a virgin has any bearing on what makes him the   best  protagonist<br><br>Just because we didn't see him shagging anyone does not mean it did not happen. He tried to get a little sensual comfort from Kallen that one time, so it's not like he wasn't interested in sex. C.C. spent months hiding in his bedroom for fucks sake, not to mention all the rest of the time they were nearly inseparable and clearly into each other. There's no reason to suspect they didn't have a long, passionate  threesome with Suzaku  the night before Zero's Requiem. Lelouch's sex life has nothing to do with the story, so nothing needed to be shown. That honor goes to the doujin artists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still believing Lelouch wasn't boning Suzaku <br><br>holy shit /a/, i knew there were some dense motherfuckers around here, but i didn't realize you were all this dense?<br><br>that motherfucker is to fabulous to be straight. and his unnatural affinity for suzaku, and suzaku's unnatural over reactions around lelouch cinch the deal. he was plowing suzaku's ass for years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So many people still in stage one.  <br> implying the stages of grief are a real thing <br>apply yourself</br></br>  <br>On your way to stage two.</br>  <br>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/g<wbr>rief-loss/coping-with-grief-and-los<wbr>s.htm#stages</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> posting cucks </br>  <br> cucks <br>I hate you for being such a transparent crossboarder.</br></br>  <br><br>cuck pls go</br></br>  <br> - He has the power to make anyone do whatever he wants. But as we all know, rape is far worse than murder. <br>It's not like he was murdering random people, anyway. I don't see how raping someone would have contributed to his plans, although with his bullshit, I guess he might have come up with it somehow.</br></br>  <br>There you go again. Naked as a baby.</br>  Why did Lelouch even give singular orders? He can use his geass to make all crazy sorts of commands. If he doesn't want to just make everyone his slave all the time, why not make the order something like<br> Every time I say "I, Zero, command you... etc." you will obey <br><br>Then he'd have a "safe word" to make sure nobody's in slave mode, and he can completely control anyone whenever he wants.<br><br>Lulu was shit with his geass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear he did that actually, to have people's orders only activate in response to a phrase.</br>  <br> Lulu was shit with his geass. <br>And Gandalf was shit with his eagle.</br></br>  <br>Only version of that I can recall is when he ordered Gilford to see him as Cornelia whenever he pulls on his collar.<br><br>Which was pretty fucking stupid. Appearing as Cornelia isn't as effective as "obey and protect me" for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Lelouch just turn around and give them the order to die?</br>  <br>Schnizel is a hell of a lot more useful as a living puppet than a corpse.</br>  <br> Why did Lelouch even give singular orders? He can use his geass to make all crazy sorts of commands. If he doesn't want to just make everyone his slave all the time, why not make the order something like <br>BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO. Simple as that. Lelouch strongly, strongly believed in free will and the sanctity of choice, part of the paradox he had to deal with was that his power denied that and there were other things he strong, strongly believed in that were in direct opposition. That dilemma was one of the key parts of the entire series, and it shows how clearly he's gone into total despair mode when he finally just does what he COULD have done from the start and simply commands "become my slave." But he wants to save humanity in general even then, not turn everyone into puppets. And he prides himself on his intelligence and tactical &amp; strategic reasoning making Geass unnecessary in as many cases as possible, just serving to sometimes tip the balance the way he wants to help with "impossible" scenarios.<br><br>At the start though, for all his massively high IQ and thirst for revenge and early royal education, he's still a fucking high school student. He does have ideals and emotions. He's not just a purely calculating Machiavelli. It's only towards the end of the whole deal when he runs out of options and has gone through a lot of bitter experience, including betrayal by the forces he worked so hard for because they were utter fucking retards, that he truly starts pushing his geass hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He literally does this at the end of the series once he leaves the Black Knights.</br>  <br>See above replies, but also are you a fucking retard anon?<br> Why didn't he obviously reveal his super power on live worldwide television in an obviously extremely villainous way that would terrify the shit out of all his allies <br>Gee I wonder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just be cause he died doesn't mean he's dead.</br></br>  <br>People die when they're killed anon.</br>  <br><br>No one's disputing that Lelouch died, only that he's dead!</br></br>  <br>Literal Japan-tier German</br>  I hate Lelouch for the same reason I hate Walter White: selfish, lying, murdering, manipulative piece of shit that got away with it.  <br> didn't_actually_bother_to_watch_th<wbr>e_series/10</wbr> <br>Euphoric.</br></br>  <br> i was too busy masturbating to pay attention to the series! <br>ebin</br></br>  I've been rewatching the show. I forgot how fucking sad it was.<br><br>Is an R3 even in the works, or is the Akito thing the latest and last?</br></br>  Is Code Geass worth watching or are these threads just a bunch of nerds who liked it when they were kids?  <br> 2007+8 <br> haven't seen Code Geass <br>Why the fuck are you browsing /a/, you little shit? Go watch it right now before you post again.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends, what sort of anime do you like. If you like racism and oppression interspersed with multiple personalities and mechs, you'd probably like it.</br>  <br>Legend of the Galactic Heroes-lite</br>  <br>I have watched it. Several years ago, when I didn't even know /a/ existed. I don't remember anything of it at all except for basic plot details, and I'm wondering if it's worth a rewatch.<br><br>Call me a faggot but I don't like mechs.</br></br></br>  <br>Then read the manga - the anime added in Knightmare frames completely, which is weird because it's a pretty major plot point.</br>  <br>It's by fatalpulse</br>  <br>Faggot.</br>  Reminder Miraculous Birthday is canon and Lelouch was a ghost in it.  <br> pretty good <br>Actually sounds like shit.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what the fuss is about sex. Have had sex a couple of times and it didn't feel good. In fact I can't feel much of anything. My dick is average sized, so it can't be because I'm small and she was a virgin, so it can't be because she's too lose.<br><br>I'm disappointed, society lied to me. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, Lelouch didn't miss out on much,</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he died a virgin because someone cockblocked the planned sex scene with Kallen.</br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Kallen cockblocked herself by attempting to snap Lelouch out of it. He was using lust as a way to get over his depression at that time.</br>  <br>Just sounds like you didn't have an attachment to the 3DPD, really.</br>  He's driving the cart  <br>No!<br><br><br>Yes!<br><br><br>No!<br><br><br>No!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  in the akito the exiled you can see him with dual geasses </br>  <br> the only intelligent girl in the entire show is C.C. <br>Do idiots really believe this?</br></br>  <br>thinking this wrongly</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> liking cucks </br>  <br/>  <br>Get out!</br>  <br><br> still ironically liking cucks </br></br>  Ohgi did nothing wrong.

Is it even possible?  <br>Lelouch. Jon Snow will be properly revived.</br>  <br>qt</br>  <br>Lelouche. Jon Snow will warg into Ghost or revive somehow but we'll never know for sure because George will never release the next book and the show is shit so why would you watch it?</br>  <br> died <br>Stopped reading right there.</br></br>  <br>So I can shitpost about it. :(</br>  <br>if you must</br>  What Lelouch is still alive and CC and Lelouch had plenty of moments where they fucked off screen<br><br>How can Lelouch make CC happy if he's dead and not sexing her? Why would CC cry when Lelouch was going to sacrifice himself when she knows the pain of being immortal? Fucking "y-you just have denial" fags</br></br>  <br><br>died and rose again yes</br></br>  <br>Yes because CC is obviously dead too.</br>  <br>Feels good knowing that Suzaku probably ended up boning Nunally in the end.</br>  <br> all this fanfiction because you can't face harsh reality <br>It's getting pathetic.</br></br>  <br>Even Narutards aren't this bad.</br>  <br>Madoka tried but it just wasn't the same</br>  <br>Madoka didn't have a MC layered for every part of the anime audience.</br>  Lelouch never fucked C.C. Their relationship was confirmed platonic by the show creators.  <br>I always wondered if the way their relationship was protrayed in the show was the execs telling the staff to increase the shipping bait.  Since Lelouch wouldn't not have sex with any girl but Nunnally. </br>  <br> pretty well implied <br>Dude, that wasn't even romantic.<br>All official guidebooks and interviews described their relationship as that of equals, not lovers, not even mother and son. Just equals.<br><br>That scene you even posted doesn't even imply anything romantic. It's something you do with your buddies even. <br><br>What you call that? Having someone's back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting from a calendar of "What-Ifs" </br>  <br> I always wondered if the way their relationship was protrayed in the show was the execs telling the staff to increase the shipping bait. <br>Of course it was. The fujos also got so much bait with Lelouch and Suzaku AND Rollo.</br></br>  Lelouch was too pure to be thinking about things like sex.  <br>What's kissing C.C. feel like?</br>  Is saying that Lelouche is dead the oldest CG meme?  <br> C.C. <br> selfish <br><br>She could have pushed her immortality curse onto Lelouch but she olev'd him too much. Literally best girl.<br><br>C.C. is also the only person who was 100% on Lulu's side throughout the entire series. Everyone else betrayed him or was an enemy at one point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually, it's the other way around. The manga removed the KMFs and it wasn't better off for it. The opposite.</br></br>  <br><br>They never put it like that, so don't be a jerk.</br></br>  <br>You're full of crap. Since there is only one source that literally says such a thing and it isn't even an interview at all.</br>  <br> C.C. <br> not selfish <br><br>She didn't care at all about Lelouch other than as a mechanism for her death at least for half of the whole show. <br><br>This included not telling him anything about his mother, which would be a big deal for him, and even being initially willing to leave him and let Charles take her Code instead. She was also willing to go back with Mao at one point. It's rather twisty to see that as "being on his side" the entire show.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lelouch is a guy who despite his success as a tactician always manages to get everyone around him hurt or killed, he doesn't do himself any favors by also being a pathological liar. It's because of that C.C ends up being "perfect" for him as she's the only person who can get close to Lelouch without ending up 6 feet under and the only one who he can't lie to. <br><br><br>That is how I have always seen their relationship, it's a sorta special one that is exclusive to a person like Lelouch but I don't know if I would exactly call it romance. I would say a lot of the ambiguity between the two is a result of Sunrise NEEDING to push some sort of romantic interest because Sunrise.</br></br></br>  <br> pathological liar <br><br>Go read the actual definition.</br></br></br>  <br> (yes, *died*; deal with it) </br>  You know the drill /a/<br>Hard mode:  No little girls, high schoolers, or Japan involved </br>   In the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, there is only war <br> MC is an Imperial guardsman from a hive world who hasn't seen much action <br> Application into the Adeptus Astartes is accepted <br> His training begins <br> Feels pain from the organ implant surgeries, drug treatments, harsh training regimes, and watching his comrades die and mutate around him <br> Makes it through training and becomes a scout just as the Hive World is invaded by orks <br> Experiences the horrors of war, fresh out of training <br> Confides in an old   female  Guardsman comrade, and she confides in him<br> This sets up a   star-crossed  romance between the two before the end of the first season<br> Second season    is cancelled due to either poor BD sales in Japan or GW revoking the 40k license.<br><br>Also:<br> Something something something inter-dimensional phone call. </br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A man falls in love with a woman.<br><br>Unable to confess, he is gifted with by a deus ex machina with the woman's phone number.

His method is requesting to visit a person’s virtual world for documentary purposes or hacking into their virtual systems by force. <br><br>He begins to understand that people who create their own virtual worlds are not as selfish as they seem. Meeting an orphan who creates a world where she is loved by her parents she does not know in real life, a widower who lives a simulated life with an idealistic perception of his wife and a crippled teenager who dreams of being an Olympic world athlete. <br><br>The Luddite comes to grips with his own fate and admits he has no easy solution to these peoples’ problems but truly desires a world where people must face reality instead of clinging to their past and hopeless dreams. He posts his results online through video in hopes of resonating people with the desire to let go, move on and live in a world just waiting to be explored - full of real people eager to be cherished and remembered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Threadly reminder that you should stop posting that because it's a thing. <br><br> https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3206<wbr>139/1/</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>Threadly reminder that you are a dumbass.</br>  <br>SoL (or Harem).

The gas mask I got no idea, but the rest is standard issue for ground force. The other branches don't use the huey  <br>There's a theory about menstruation occurring because of an evolutionary arms race between the fetus (that wants to hog all the mother's resources to itself and has practically weaponized the placenta to do so) and the mother (that wants to share her resources between all her potential children and has turned the endometrium into a testing ground). So as a solution, humans have evolved to go fuck it and just slough off the endometrium. It's not as pants on head silly in a tribal context. Between delayed menarche, pregnancy, and lactational amenorrhea, a woman would only experience menses a dozen or so times.<br><br>For elves to not menstruate, all they need to have is the ability to completely reabsorb the endometrium and to lack a hemochorial placenta.

Not to mention how hard it would be to acquire another one when it's Hell on Earth. There's something fishy.</br>  <br>Dem thighs.</br>  <br>Every single panel featuring the pilot suggest that he is on a solo mission. This makes little sense for a multitude of reasons if they were on a retrieval mission and had non-fucked amounts of manpower. Helicopters aren't really disposable either, nor are people that can fly them.<br><br>Was it clear that they actually developed the disease? The levels of preparation might also suggest a more Fallout-ish scenario - somebody is aware of the possible threat and is building shelters and handing out survival manuals. An evil corporation wouldn't just hand out confidential, sealed documents to a freaking teacher. The chance of them getting leaked would be too high.<br><br>I think I'll just stop speculating and enjoy the ride. There's barely any info given to us regarded the whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a good chance they developed it. There's a lot of cryptic background notes about chemicals in the water, and a past incident where half the population just disappeared. However, it doesn't mean they're totally evil. Corporations are made of people. The ideologies of the company itself might be evil, but there's often a good conscious keeping it from going full tilt. Like with Google.</br>    <br>The costs are nothing compared to a more valuable, healthy person. Healthy manpower can build shit like those, damn the expense as we are in an emergency situation.<br>Also, transport choppers are cheaper compared to attack choppers which would have been escorting the chopper if it was a rescue mission. Plus more guys on it loaded for bear. But judging from the suitcase of the pilot, it really looked like it is just a routine collection</br></br>  <br>It does make sense to send an infected pilot alone if you send them at all, though. Infection symptoms and bitefights in the cockpit don't sound particularly good no matter how many guys you brought.<br><br>Ideally you'd want non-infected, healthy pilots, but maybe they don't have enough of them to spare. Or risking them for this mission is too much of a liability.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I think too. It seems weird for a truly malicious corporation to take so many measures to ensure the well-being of the people they supposedly intend to use as test subjects.<br><br>They still likely developed the virus but they also clearly didn't want things to get too bad in case of an outbreak. They knew things could go horribly wrong and took measures to attempt and minimize the damage in case it did.</br></br></br>   tfw the biker bros were just trying to warn the group the dangers of the people in the Uni, but are too jaded by the apocalypse to approach them in a friendly way   <br> skindentation <br><br>This mangaka needs to do porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they just heard the racket and came running with baseball bats, not knowing what to expect. The girls pretty much just ran away at first glance on them.</br>  <br>I would love to see a bunch of random army grunts with no education in engineering build a chopper from scraps. It's not about money, it's about helicopters being limited as fuck.<br><br>The other thing that is expensive and rare are pilots. Everybody can be trained to be a soldier in an emergency. WW2 is a good example of that. Give a man a gun, train him in using it and let him run at the enemy. Cheap and disposable. A pilot on the other hand requires years of expensive training and not everybody is suited for the job, especially if it is a combat pilot. Expensive, limited, and have to be responsible for not getting everybody around and under them killed.<br><br>Now, in a zombie apocalypse manpower obviously becomes MUCH more valuable and even a grunt isn't something you could just toss away, but the same thing applies to pilots. If they were limited and expensive before now they are worth their weight in solid gold.<br><br>The odd thing about this is him being infected tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one word they said here translates to stop, but literally means "stand still". However, this isn't the original, so it could've been a loose translation from Japanese as well.</br>  <br>Why is a boy wearing garters.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to Miki.</br>  <br>You have manual labor though. Better to have healthy persons build shit than infected ones that can cause delays.<br>And that is the point. He was infected and it would be more prudent to send him than a healthy pilot. He is good as lost if there was no cure and sending an infected on a potentially high risk area is acceptable. Besides, it is just basic flying not ACM which requires time. Even a civvie can land a plane with instructions from control tower alone. I do not think it would take that time to train someone just to fly around and look for things. Combat pilots are the ones that take time.</br></br>  <br>You are a faggot for making me post in the wrong thread.<br><br>Phone posting so no images. The pilot was most likely Ground JSDF because of the helicopter and gear: UH-1 Huey, Sig P220 pistol and that type 88 helmet. The gas mask I got no idea, but the rest is standard issue for ground force. The other branches don't use the huey.</br></br></br>  <br> boy </br>  <br>If it is JSDF, does that mean Japan is fucked?</br>  <br>Sending him by helicopter seems a bit weird though. Let's assume he's as good as done for, but gets selected / volunteers for a rescue / sample collection mission. Would you really give him a helicopter that he could potentially crash and kill everybody around him? This would be especially true if he was sent to exterminate the girls and bring the samples back (if it was a case where they needed survivors dead at any cost they would send a squad of healthy men).<br><br>Why not just send him by car or let another guy fly him in. The car would take time, but he'd eventually get there with a much lower risk of losing something valuable or getting people killed. Unless all comms are dead he could call in a chopper after he makes sure they are fine if he was there to rescue the girls.<br><br><br>If the JSDF sends a single infected man with just a single handgun in a single chopper for 3 girls it dun look too good to me. At the very least it is wide-spread. Otherwise there would be search choppers all over the place. Japan isn't exactly poor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boy <br>I love this meme.</br></br>  <br>Probably because it will take time? Let us also assume while he is planning to take samples, it might also include getting the girls out of there ASAP. You do not want the subjects to turn before you can get the samples while they are still human aftet all.</br>  Any /tg/ drawfags here? Somebody needs to draw Kurumi in Nurgle Chaos Space Marine armor wielding a Chain-Shovel. It needs to happen  <br> chain-shovel <br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>Also no point of having another pilot fly him, moreso if pilot is healthy. If one man can do the job then that is enough.<br>Let us also assume that while he may seem expendable, they do not want to lose him or the chopper as much as possible because he would be still useful flying more missions. Now probably due to the nature of the mission, he was considered an acceptable loss if things do not proceed as planned.</br></br>  <br>Somebody post a high-res pic of Kurumi with her Shovel, I'll try it.</br>  <br>Then why use a corpse-candidate as a pilot if speed and reliability are important? Either everybody involved is disposable or not. <br><br>It makes sense sending an infected if it is a low-priority mission, but you wouldn't give him a chopper unless everybody else that can use it is already dead or there's way too many lying around for the amount of people that can use them. You don't half-ass in an apocalypse.<br><br>I'm starting to think that Japan is simply fucked and this was some desperate mercy mission or something. Get them out or at least give them a clean death, but there was nobody else to send so they went with the infected pilot. I mean, the letter was hella cute.<br><br>Since the syringes weren't clearly visible they may have been with a little bit of serum in them or empty. Markers on the map may have been known safe-zones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose it could make sense. This also means that Japan is fucked tho.</br>  <br>Chopper is probably written off as an acceptable loss.

Miki is kinda mean hearted, but not wrong about Yuki's personality yet kinda going the wrong way about it.  </br>  <br>I can attest. She sure maintains my wood. Hard.</br>  <br> wake up <br>Miki never believed her to be insane. I think she believed Yuki is making it up as an excuse to stay "useless".

Yuki, Yuuri and Megu-nee arrived running later.<br><br>The anime also skipped this part. I thought it was nice it showed non-delusional Yuki even for a brief moment, and at least put some context about how the main group came together after the outbreak.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm talking about a later flashback. That's after they already got through the door and Rii and Yuki started holding it down.</br>  <br>That was a dream.

While Kurumi was recovering, did Miki move the body? I take it they actually buried her on the rooftop this time? Also the guy who hanged himself in the basement was the principal? </br></br>  <br>Where have you been lately?</br>  <br> "Worth it" </br>  <br>I want to get infected and vaccinated, just so my body can be as cold as Shovel's.</br>  <br>Shovel in the next 10+ chapters</br>  <br>Watching HS because fansub is dead.</br>  <br>That's kinda kawaii</br>  <br> <br>Shovel does get to see the body in a room iirc<br><br>The guy was the principal, he was bitten (the blood trail before the door)</br></br></br> </br>  <br>What they do with the bodies is not really touched upon.

After getting infected she has always been wearing a hoodie. When did she notice that something still isn't quite right? I don't think she's just hiding some scars or something, but is actually feeling cold or trying to hide the fact that she has a low body temperature.</br>  Wait a minute. Megu-nee is real? Here I thought she was literally just a delusion thought up by Yuki as some sort of coping mechanism and even a tool to shut herself up when she meets a zombie like in this episode.<br><br> Yes I'm a filthy fucking secondary. </br></br>  <br> senpie </br>  <br>Well the anime showed Kurumi's kill tucked in a nearby classroom.<br>As for decomposing bodies, they're zombies, they're essentially already decomposing.

It's because they're using the useless/no presence adviser shtick along with the fact that they're all playing along with Yuki's delusions so I genuinely don't know if she's real or they're just pulling an Akari with how little presence Megu-nee has.<br><br>Ah fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop.

The author knows his exact intentions and we can't get off this ride, only prepare for the worst.</br></br>  <br> Meguri~n </br>  <br>Nobody ever had a conversation with Megu-nee besides Yuki. Rii-san even cuts into her monologue, which can be discarded as something funny of her having no presence, but actually she doesn't even have that much presence to ignore.</br>  So Megu-nee is basically Yukis survival instinct right?

The best site I found has it hardsubbed in laggy 480p with a chatbox of people *actiontexting* next to it. The fact that there are people who actually consume their anime this was in their regular life honestly sickens me, I never knew casuals were this plebeian in how they consume their Naruto. Sometimes I think people take the level of non-casual entry-level retardation on /a/ for granted.  <br>KissAnime is a decent solution in case stream is a must. 1080p and all other qualities are there, but there's a small watermark in the corner of the anime.</br>  Why couldn't the mangaka make him even slightly useful and not amnesiac 24/7? Isn't he supposed to be attractive to ladies?  The legs in this show hnnnnnnnnnng  Darien is always useful. Nigga always showed up to save the scouts by tossing a Distraction Rose. And then he learned how to ASTRALLY PROJECT so that even when he was just sitting on the toilet taking a dump he could appear in Astral Form as the Moonlight Knight and throw a scimitar to behead those who insult the Moon, or something like that. Same technique he used later to astrally project himself as Endymion of the future.<br><br>Well, actually I guess he's been shit-useless in Crystal, but no one in Crystal is important except for Usagi because she's an attention-hungry meatball mary sue.</br></br>  <br>The show was incredibly - pardon the word - progressive for its time, in the idea that the girls were in charge and pretty much handled everything by themselves - There were a few minor occasions in which Tuxedo Mask was useful (His fight against Rubeus in the brawl episode of R comes to mind. While Ai no Senshi plays) but it was clear that he was just eye candy. I guess progressive's not exactly the word, since it would've been cool for him to do more. I think in the manga he actually is the user of the Gold crystal in the "Super S" part but we had to suffer Chibi Moon instead.</br>  I'd just like to take a moment and say the few minutes I watched of the English dub were excruciatingly painful. <br><br>Original<br> Zoisite fabulous gay villain <br> has beautiful romance with Kunzite  <br> Mamoru and Usagi's romance actually written well <br> dat episode where they find out their secret identities filled with such emotion  <br><br>English Dub<br> Zoisite a "tough" girl <br> doesn't even seem to be interested in Kunzite (Malachite)  <br> Usagi (Serena) is a complete OMGTEEHEE tween <br> Mamoru (Darien) unappealing nasally prepubescent boy <br> nothing romantic when they find out their secret identities  <br><br>Like, I get wanting to change things a bit to appeal to a different audience but it felt like a completely different show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This face still hurts to look at. Who in their right mind would turn their back on someone like her?</br>  <br>On the plus side, Darien's first VA was one of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Men.</br>  <br>I pisses me off even more that no version of SM ever follows up on this plotline or even has Jupiter involved in anything interesting beyond random episodic stuff.</br>  <br> Girl Zoicite <br> bad <br><br>Please nigga, she was the one villain the dub did right. Don't be dissin her memory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not realising how big an influence English Sailor Moon was on the Mexican dub and how much this contributed to it being the best version of SM overall </br>    Posting best sera  <br>My fellow african american.<br>SM Latin dub is just excellent, specially later on the series, when Venus starts acting silly and with villains like Mimette.<br>I just can't get enough of it...</br></br></br>  <br> I just can't get enough of it... <br>Well, so far it's the closest thing to an 'ideal' Sailor moon that paves over all the flaws of the series. The Latin dub really benefits from the direction partially taking after the early episodes of the English dub and giving Serena a soft, sweet sounding voice.<br><br>I'm still massively buthurt over Crystal not being the 'uber' adaptation of SM that I desperately hoped it would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And hurt me even more that they portraid them as lesbians. Im looking at you Korra.</br>  Is chibiusa a representative for America? Her casual clothes says otherwise  <br>I liked Latin american SM, i dont know about americans, but here if you watched that shit you where considered a fag. It was before Anime was a thing. I remember that we had secret meetings in recess to talk about the show. I even remember some guy whos parents didnt let him watch the show, so he always asked for everything. <br>I dont know if anyone of them turned fags tho.</br></br>  <br>tfw you're the one fag that likes usagi</br>  <br> but here if you watched that shit you where considered a fag <br>I assume that would have been true in most places. I'm an upsidedownfag and the guys who watched it here would always deny it, while DBZ was the thing to watch. I don't know of any place where it would be acceptable to admit to enjoying it to a general audience of your peers as a dude.</br></br>  <br>I kinda understand. I only watched like 2 episodes of SM as a kid and stopped right there, because I was afraid of other kids calling me a fag or shit like that. <br>It wasn't until a few years ago that I decieded to give it a try and oh boy I regret not doing it before...</br></br>  <br>Anime Usagi is lovely, I bet you're not alone anon.</br>  <br> Who here has read and enjoyed the W.I.T.C.H. comics? Best straight up rip off of SM by far. </br>  <br>This so fucking much.</br>  <br>I like her in every form Anon.<br>But I like ever Sailor Senshi so I'm a bit biased.<br><br> &gt;New mario SM CGset never </br></br></br></br>    Minako-chan is just Usagi if she were written by an American author.<br><br>And that's really fucking rad.</br></br>                    http://a.uguu.se/oqreti.webm  <br>As  said, you're not alone. I think Usagi is kawaii. I think people don't like her because she's the main senshi and therefore gets all the attention.</br>    <br>my waifu</br>      <br>ALWAYS GETTING IN A GANG FIGHT<br>SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR COON</br></br>  I need to get on this train. I've been putting it off for too long.      <br>best usagi</br>  Anyone have the gif of the girls spinning around the waitress trying to hide from Mars?  <br>Get on the train anon! I finally did this summer and am genuinely loving it. I am no longer just a nostalgic fangirl who watched a few episodes of the English sub as a kid.</br>  What is the appeal of this show?<br>I tried watching it but the main character is a whiny crybaby with an annoying voice.</br>  <br>Teenage girls in short skirts that do provocative transformation sequences.</br>  <br> Wasting a slot on a samefag </br>  <br>Nostalgia<br>It's funny sometimes<br>Color scheme and 90's feel is nice</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, Venus should just have stayed the protagonist</br>  <br>I think I liked Mercury the most and Venus second.<br><br><br>But when I daydreamed about the series I always imagined myself as Usagi's siamese twin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It preceded Utena, hence has historical relevance.</br>    <br>the hypocritical MC is funny<br><br> Ah, I'm the embodiment of love <br><br> Even if god forgives you, I will never forgive you </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not hypocrisy.</br>  <br>okay, but at least a little contradictory.</br>  <br>No, not that either. Love and forgiveness don't always go hand in hand.</br>  <br>Love is subjective.<br>To me forgiveness is part of it.</br></br>    Crystal is fucking prude shit.  <br>it was a webm, dunno if there was gif too</br>  <br>How does any of this work?</br>  <br>Are mexicans the new americans? Mexicans always think their shit tier dubs are the best versions. Even superior to the originals.</br>  <br>Mexican dub is top quality, sometimes surpassing the originals. I recommend you to check out some of the original DBZ anime episodes from the Frieza saga. While Frieza felt nothing like in the japanese version it really sounded both evil and unforgiving. The same happens with Usagi in SM, the VA adds a lot to the character.<br><br>Also pic unrelated, I just ran out of SM on my phone</br></br></br>  <br> I recommend you to check out some of the original DBZ anime episodes from the Frieza saga <br><br>Pass. DBZ is garbage.<br>Mexican dubs may be better than American dubs since all american dubs are pure garbage but mexican dubs are no where near better than the originals.</br></br></br></br>    Entry level  <br>I've been watching it through for the first time and I've been really liking it. Yes, it's silly, it's cheesy and often downright corny and dumb. But it has a lot of heart and the girls all feel like teenage girls with teenage girl issues in addition to their whole "save the world" shtick.<br>It's not the greatest show in the world, but I'm sure having fun.</br></br>  <br>MOON OF INCOMPETENCE</br>  I want to be Rei's friend  <br>She doesn't want any.</br>  <br>Id make her want one</br>  <br>That sounds like rape</br>  <br>I dont mean it like that</br>      <br>All versions of Zoisite are goat. <br><br>Also, I had no idea there was a card game.</br></br></br>  <br> Rats! <br>We all know who's responsible, right?</br></br>  <br>Watch it in Spanish instead  or alternately watch the first few episodes in English . It fixes that problem.<br><br> What is the appeal of this show? <br>It's basically the most epic anime series ever made. It gets pretty insane and has the largest variety of great characters you will see.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a reason Stars is so hard to find?<br><br>Its not on nyaa, and any other torrent found has like 1 seeder at most.</br></br>  <br> Watch it in Spanish instead <br><br>Fucking mexicans. Your dub isn't any better than any other dub. They all suck.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, but it IS better. We can speak both english and spanish, and english fall pretty far behind.<br><br>Not to mention the necessity America had to completely change the Opening of most animes of the time, often by horrendous 'music' (see Dragon Ball Z &amp; Digimon), instead in spanish the original song is translated to spanish and used as the Opening.<br><br>If anything, America has made most of the worst dubs in history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not Mexican, don't even speak any form of Spanish and admit that the Latin dub isn't specifically as strong as some other dubs in many ways. But overall, there's no denying that out of all the ways to watch Sailor Moon, it's the least flawed and has the fewest annoying characters and that specifically is why it makes sense to recommend it. It succeeds in combining the positive qualities of dubs prior to it while removing the negative, so it's only natural that it would likely appeal to a new viewer more.</br>  <br><br>By we, I meant "I".

There's another torrent available for the movies but I haven't watched any yet so I can't vouch for quality. If you (or anyone else) ends up watching the first season I highly recommend downloading a different torrent for the episodes where Mako is introduced (26 I think) to episode 40. The video quality is garbage and the translations were too literal e.g. "I will destroy you" translated to "Me destroy you."</br>  <br>japanese voice acting isn't the untouchable holy grail you weebs think it is</br>  <br>I used [SMC] for everything else, including the movies.<br>Soft subs, and ripped straight from the DVDs.

Sadly, those were just raws.<br>Someone did mux in some subs, but I don't remember what name it was under.</br></br>  <br>There has got to be a weird and convoluted reason as to why the Italian release was better than the native jap one.</br>  <br>Poor compression and encoding when the Japs pressed the discs is all I can think.

Is she really supposed to be 8? She looks barely old enough to be in 1st grade.</br></br></br></br>  <br> out of all the ways to watch Sailor Moon, it's the least flawed <br><br>Uh no? The least flawed way is the original Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br> weebs <br> saying this on /a/ </br></br>  <br> Is she really supposed to be 8? <br><br>Isn't Chibiusa like 1,008? Since she was born when Usagi was in her 20s and she goes back in time from the 30th century.</br></br></br>  <br>But then gets worse again in SuperS</br>  <br><br>They give her way too much screen time, but she was pretty good by the tume SuperS came about. She ended up being slightly more mature than Usagi was during season 1.</br></br>  <br>What's the story with Pluto, anyhow?</br>  <br>She used to be a Sailor Guardian, but then they took away her powers and status.</br>  <br><br>In general?<br><br>She's the guardian of the door of space-time, which is located in a void known as the underworld. She is as old as time itself, and nobody is supposed to know of her existence. As the guardian of time, there were three "taboos" that she should never commit: never to leave her post, never to let someone use the door to travel through time, and to never stop time using her powers. If she did the last one, it would kill her in the process.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didnt die in the original anime though did she?<br>The helicopter blows up, but dont we see her later?</br></br>  <br>I hope you aren't saying that Kotono Mitsuishi has an annoying voice.</br>  <br>Nat 20 stealth rolls and nat 1 perception</br>  <br><br>She died in the third season of the original anime, yeah. She showed up in the non-canon SuperS movie, but she didn't actually return until Stars. In the manga, she comes back halfway through the third arc.<br><br>Speaking of which, her helicopter death was pretty memorable too. It wasn't extremely sad like the one in the manga/crystal/musicals, but it was really haunting and shocking. I felt like it have Haruka and Michiru all the more reason to try and stop Mistress 9, like they wanted to make sure her sacrifice wouldn't be in vain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its implied that she dies because she invokes time stop. The Setsuna that shows up in Stars is probably reborn somewhere in the timeline and goes to where she is needed.<br><br>It works a lot better with the Time Stop as it occurs in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>So she's only in one episode, then?<br><br>And I'm presuming because she never leaves her post, she doesn't fight alongside the other scouts often, or at all?</br></br></br>  <br> scouts </br>  <br>The Japanese has some retardedly annoying shit in it. It is better than the other adaptations in a fuck ton of ways, but I'd hardly say its the least flawed.</br>  <br> It is better than the other adaptations <br><br>We're not talking different adaptations. We're talking the 90s anime and what language its in.<br>The original Japanese 90s sailor moon is the least flawed way of watching the 90s sailor moon anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The original Japanese 90s sailor moon is the best way to watch Sailor Moon in general, but the Latin dub is the least flawed and generally succeeds in making the more annoying characters more palatable. I don't really see what's so controversial about this.</br>    <br>The only time I remember angry at animu at a young age was Makoto getting snubbed in SuperS and Gohan jobbing to Super Buu</br>  Are their any good screen caps of the lesbian couple?<br><br>I really want, like, a depressing shot of Sailor Jupiter in the bathtub or something.</br></br>  <br> I don't really see what's so controversial about this. <br><br>Because it's a retarded, wrong opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Its on Hulu, that;s tolerable.</br>  <br>Im not really sure what you're asking for</br>  <br>Bro you've never suffered through German official anime dubs<br><br>Holler if you remember Vegeta's original German voice. It was so bad they replaced it after 2 episodes.</br></br></br>    <br>idk, i haven't really watched the series at all, and have only a basic familiarity with the characters, but i downloded a shit ton of episodes of the original series, and watched the first 5 or so episodes of Sailor Moon Crystal.<br><br>I guess I just want some decent footage of Jupiter I can use in an artizie-esque music video, hahaha</br></br></br>    <br>idk how to respond anon @_@</br>    <br>Good old time when moeshit didin't killed the anime yet.</br>  <br> What if Sailor Moon was drawn by an American video game package artist in the 80s? </br>    <br>Is the first Sailor Moon anime better than the manga and Crystal?</br>  <br>She likes the smell of her own brand.</br>  <br>Yes. <br>The expanded, anime-only episodes do far more than act as filler; they flesh out the characters and the world and let you actually connect with the characters rather than watch thin facsimiles hastily blunder through the story because the plot demands it.<br>Also, Crystal has fucking abysmal artwork and animation.</br></br></br>  <br>My cousin wants me to get into to anime. So, I showed her the new sailor moon. She fucking loved it.</br>    <br>She wants you to get into anime... so you showed her anime.<br><br>wat</br></br></br>  I know it's common in nippon animu that scientists are pure evil, but this is just retarded. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  That whole story she told was a lie. There are no scientists.    <br>Yeah it isn't very realistic that doctors at a particular institution would be evil<br><br>Everyone knows all doctors are 100% pure of corruption</br></br></br>   dropping something based on a plot arc that hasn't even come close to being fully revealed <br><br>If you were an anime I'd drop you</br></br>  <br> If you were an anime I'd drop you <br><br>He was obviously already dropped by his parents, so what's the point doing it now?</br></br></br>  B.. but you wouldn't know who is Charlotte if you dropped the show  It's common in all fiction about super powers. I don't know how you aren't used to it by now.  <br>Evil Scientist/Doctor has always been a thing in fiction.<br><br>How do you not know this?<br><br>Seriously?</br></br></br></br></br>  science is for nerds and nerds are all mad about being picked on in school<br><br>it's basic psychology</br></br>  <br>What is so strange about this? Some scientists are really corrupted.</br>  <br> just because everyone does it we should tolerate it </br>  <br>If you want to start complaining about shitty tropes, there are literally thousands of worse ones in anime</br>  <br> I'm an assmad saiyans nerd </br>  <br> it COULD be worse so it's okay </br>  <br>At least Mekakucity Actors didn't do it.</br>  <br>The frequency of it makes it pretty easy to swallow, yeah. It's just one of the two most common "reasons we don't reveal our super powers to people" explanations. And it makes enough sense, people really would want to study someone with super powers, it's not so farfetched that a scientist would do so using illegal means.</br>   Dropping one of the most popular shows this season <br><br>Literally no one will notice or miss you, hipster</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's okay, just that you should shut up about it</br>  <br> popular = good <br>am I really on /a/?</br></br>  <br> don't talk about a stupid plot point even if it's a fact <br>So you want a hugbox board?</br></br>  Can we change the topic to Nao's thighs?  I really don't know what to think. My common sense tells me most scientists wouldn't just up and kidnap and torture a person to study supernatural powers. But I do know there have been examples of horrible doctors experimenting on live humans (plenty of stories from WW2 regarding that), but there's really no precedent to go off of in real life to how they'd react to people with super powers.  <br>nigger its popular for a reason, looks whos making it. some shows dont deserve their popularity but this isnt one of them</br>  <br>No, I just want less shitty threads</br>  <br>Nobody has been kidnapped.
