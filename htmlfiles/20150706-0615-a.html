Best thighs.   <br> Previous Thread <br>Stop that.</br></br>  <br>You're kind of making me regret selling her</br>  <br>Nope, these are</br>  <br>Ritsu in August.</br>  I'm going to a shitty local con to see what can I buy, I'll take pictures of scalping faggots selling bootlegs and shit.<br><br><br> Today is my birthday, by the way. </br></br></br>  Hopefully we see LWA get a figure/nendoroid now.<br><br>They helped support LWA 2</br></br>  <br>I wish they'd show at least two at Wonfes, but I guess that won't happen.</br>  <br><br>I still don't see why anyone would want these over the Alter set</br></br>  <br>people don't sell genuine figures at cons because they just get stolen</br>  <br>I know, I want plushies, keychains and such.</br>  <br>Happy birthday, anon!</br>  <br>Except that you can get them cheaper at AmiAmi.<br><br>There's NEVER a good reason why anyone would buyfag at cons, unless you're into buying overpriced limited edition rewards from prize machines.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll just go and see, if it's too expensive I'll just order online, it's been a while since I've seen sunlight, so I'll just go an see.</br>  Enjoy the fourth of July.  <br>h-happy birthday</br>  <br><br>Thanks anons.</br></br>  <br>Nice shirt.</br>  <br>The outfits are cute.</br>  <br> And they have some nerve charging the prices they do for their shit. <br><br>It's resin, those prices are completely standard. I still don't know why they thought now was a good time to be releasing oreimo figs but the pricing isn't absurd.</br></br></br>  <br> not both </br>  <br>I haven't seen anyone say they'd want them over the alter set, though. I figure people buying these up would already have figures of them, are excited for something new that isn't a prize fig, or are looking forward to displaying a themed set of all five. It seems it'll be a case of a set looking better as a whole than as individuals, unfortunately.</br>  cant wait  <br>The one Kuroneko figure I want ;_;<br><br>I want to do things to those gorgeous legs</br></br></br>  <br>I meant the prices of their figures in general.</br>  <br>I hope they release an entire set for the movie outfits too so I can spend over 1000 usd on just love live nendos.</br>  <br>I thought Mugi looked pretty bad in the art, but her figure is great. I'm happy to get something that isn't seifuku for once.</br>  I need this.  I shouldn't be tempted by this.  <br>I prefer the Max Factory set over both.</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br>That's cute</br>  <br>yeah you are</br>  <br>Do you think you could get away with carrying that in public?</br>  <br>I want a good figure of komari already.</br>  <br>Sure, it will go great with my shirt.</br>  <br>I don't like the boring school uniforms. I wish there were scales of the punk outfits they wear at Sawa's friend's marriage.</br>  <br>The only thing that would go good with that shirt is a fire.</br>  <br> You will never have a thick tsun imouto </br>  <br>^</br>  <br><br>Cute.</br></br>  <br>I remember when previous thread was always added in the past. It's even better now with the archive. <br><br>Good job adding to the post count too. Get over it.</br></br></br>  <br>For that price, they put out some shitty figures. So no thanks.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Thanks anon.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7R5<wbr>A0pg4oN8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>we don't need it. anyone who isn't new should be able to find it within seconds if he needs it</br>  <br>That might be the case but it doesn't hurt adding it. Saves a few seconds for whoever needs it I guess.</br>  <br>no need to make it easy for stupid people</br>  <br> I remember when previous thread was always added in the past <br><br><br>Not really, never happened frequently for buyfag threads since most threads start from scratch anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Waiting patiently.  <br>It did happen often from what I remember. Same goes with the vector thread. Anyways, I agree it's not needed but it's not a waste of time either. <br><br>Now, who does that ass belong to. Please tell.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, didn't happen.<br><br>Only general threads did that (Strike Witches, Im@s , SnW, and the like) did that, and that's hat made buyfag thread different, discussion was kept within a thread and following threads were not linked to each other besides the ones during wonfes.</br></br></br>  <br>James are you going to collect all variants of the seven deadly sins? Considering that they're going to make a figure of all the pics in the gallery on their site.<br><br><br> Vector thread <br>Anon this isn't /w/, even generals on /a/ doesn't do that shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well. One thing we can both agree is that buyfag threads don't last as long as they used to. <br><br>Thanks for that pic.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt they are making every single pic but even then, no I'm not getting all of them, I'm not interested on recolors nor in a couple of future figures (Cowboy Mammon and Belial)<br><br><br>You mean exactly how every other thread with decent activity doesn't last nearly as long as it did years ago? No way, master of obvious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course I'm stating the obvious. But why has these threads attracted so much attention as of late. What changed.</br>  <br>Anon, threads don't last as long as they used to, that's is in general.</br>  <br>Obvious as well, as the userbase grows the number of buyfags grows proportionally.<br><br><br>Plus, it's easier than ever to buy shit from overseas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The season?</br>  <br> implying summer ever ended <br>Sure, the kids come and go but the normals have been in here for years.</br></br>  <br> no tail <br>such a shame</br></br>  Euphonium merch when?  <br> Kyanus releasing their cash cows this soon <br><br><br>Hah, prepare for subpar figures by themselves, then some months/years later some better manufacturers might pick the franchise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for a good Mirai figure. But I do hope some good manufacturer picks up H!E soon.</br>  <br>It's not that better manufacturers won't pick the franchise, read. Kyoani are the ones who won't let it go this soon until they have gotten enough gold out of it.</br>   previous thread   What the fuck is wrong with her face?  <br> tfw cancelled my order on HLJ a week ago  <br>Never looked back.<br>Holding out for a good Satsuki scale but I don't think we're ever gonna get it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't have bought it anyway but its a shame that she has a great body but a fucked up face.</br>  <br><br>Sculptors are struggling transforming her handsome face to 3D<br><br>And I was excited for this one, too.</br></br></br></br>  I am not sure whether I will pre-order Kaitendoh's Xenovia.

I might cancel her right now.</br></br>  <br>so im reading the guide and I found a website with a figure  plamoya japan  and why is their EMS cheaper then the SAL? I looked at the chart and it says that EMS should be cheaper. so what do I do for shipping? never actually bought something overseas before.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127590026   <br>It might be just shitty picture.

Such a cute design.  <br> not liking huge ass nipples <br><br>Are you gay? You probably dislike dicks, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Excuse you, I LOVE dicks. But on such a bad figure those huge nipples don't look right. Big nipples belong on big tits. And those are medium at best.</br>  <br>I didn't even notice the nipples, holy hell that's some horrifying shit</br>  <br>Should I gamble on this or hope for bin pricing?</br>  <br>I'd say for me that's the minimum size on which I find huge nipples to be good.</br>  <br>Absolutely wait for it to bin.</br>  <br>You'd love that Panty and Stocking doujin where they fuck each other's nipples then.</br>  <br>I liked her maid design better. The bunny ears are seriously retarded.</br>  <br>This doesn't look good.</br>  There was an anon yesterday saying he took a video of GSC's panel from AX. Did he post a link?  <br>Is that Chirico there.</br>  So I just changed my mailing address with BiJ, but the order still has my old address on it. Should I contact BiJ or will it change automatically? The order ships in November/December.  <br>Email them, placed orders don't auto update.</br>  <br>Don't pay until they change it.</br>  <br>her face and hair both look like they were dipped in grease</br>  <br> moving out this month <br> starts packing my shit <br> unearth countless ost CDs, wall scrolls, mangos, doujins, and figs <br> not into 80% of these things anymore <br><br>welp. Aside from deciding whether to bring them with me or leave some behind  at my parents', they promised they wouldn't throw my shit out  as I sell them, anyone has tips about flat out organizing/making lists to better sell?<br><br>Or give me your local sales stories to inspire me, buyf/a/gs. I've started giving the local kijiji page a shot, may try to paw some off at the upcoming local con in August too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just throw it on ebay. Ebay alone has made me a grand from selling like 6 items. Does not include another 500+ I sold to anons on these sites last week. Give us first pick and the left over throw on ebay for those idiots.</br>  i want this figure now im waiting for it to drop half its price like griffon's previous 1/2.5 figure did   Subtotal: 7,480 JPY <br> Shipping: 6,520 JPY <br><br>wtf amiami/ems</br></br></br>  <br> Ebay is good to make extra money on because most people who buy anime stuff on it either don't know how to buyfag or have too much money to care. The only downfall is getting charged with fees but it's worth it.<br><br> buy six anime dvds for a certain series at FYE on clearance years ago <br> sell them for almost $200 on Ebay last month </br></br></br></br>  <br>shipping won't drop though</br>  <br>Books?</br>  <br>No a single figure.<br><br>Though I guess it is 40cm tall.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I know this is offtopic, but how much ebay charges you for selling stuff? I've been reading their guide and all and it only says ""we will charge a fee" or something along the lines, but not an exact % or whatever.</br></br>  <br>Wow, congrats for making back so much. My shit is far from as valuable as yours, I'm sure, I mainly have a lot of small items so using ebay doesn't feel worth it, especially with shipping/conversion fees and etc. I've also had SOME success with the local kijiji, if my arranged sale for 2 mystery box trading figs work out (selling them 30$ a pop, bought them for ~8 a few years back)<br><br>That said I do believe pic related is something no one in my vicinity can appreciate/would have enough interest in. The figma is untouched (never opened), box is a little banged up but that's about it. I'll try making a list  they're mostly Fate/and Tales of , it's just daunting work.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe do a lot sale?</br>  <br>I want that, sell it to me</br>  <br>That shouldn't matter.... they are taking you are a ride or you picked the wrong shipping.</br>  <br>I only have one option though</br>  <br> Never ever. </br>  <br>Now see that I would slap down money for</br>  <br>I saw the painted version on twitter in the wonfes tag about a week ago. It looks bad.</br>  Is there anywhere decent to get the Patchouli nendo anymore? It slipped under my radar but I'd really like to get my hands on it.  <br>but are you a secondary, i'm not sure I can do business with secondaries<br><br>Shitposting aside, are you serious?</br></br></br>  <br> There are some small fees for bonus options that you probably won't use.<br> subtitled listing <br> listing in multiple categories <br> uploading more than 6 photos <br> making over twenty listings in one month <br> fixed-price listings instead of auctions (these are like those month-long listings) <br><br>At the end of the month you get charged with a final fee that's a percentage of the amount you made from selling stuff, I think it's something like 10%. This is the shit part of using Ebay but if you manage to sell your items over what their value is you're not really losing much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you still have it?</br>  <br>Sounds like they are jewing you then.</br>  <br>Fatefags are inherently secondaries because it's babbies first VN</br>  <br>Depends on how much you want for it, but yes I'm interested.<br><br><br>Wow rude.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No I didn't save it, sorry.</br>  <br>The fee is usually 10% of the final value. There are also small insertion fees that can add up if you sell a ton of items, but watch your special deals. Ebay usually offers a number of free insertions and such every month or sometimes even better deals like 1000 free fixed price inserts or something. Just do whatever it seems will cost you the least and maybe wait for a better deal to show up if you can. Also upcharge on the item and the shipping a bit if you can to cover the fees a little.</br>  <br>amiami plz</br>  <br> 533x800 <br><br>Have the high resolution</br></br></br>   tfw figure gets released you really want and extras are available but won't have enough to pay for it until next week, only to have it suddenly get sold out. <br> tfw scalpers are already charging double the price online </br>  <br>what figure anon?</br>  <br/>  <br>K</br>  <br><br><br>Here's the pic. <br><br><br><br>Thanks for the info and tips, anons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you guys ever worry about your figurines getting all dusty or breaking? Or that you might lose them if you move out from your current place? I don't really buy decorations or unnecessary stuff because of this. My room is quite literally a just bed, desk and computer, but I really want to get some Nichijou figurines. How do you overcome this fear?  <br>fanbook Nozomi</br>  <br>No.</br>  post your preorders  <br>Well if you put a mini paper bag over the head...</br>  <br>only thing I can say is to buy some wall shelves anon.</br>  <br>Alter set is boring and old. I never wanted them. The colors are better here.<br><br>Let me guess, you own the Alter set.</br></br></br>  <br>Your figures aren't going to just spontaneously break. If you're worried about your desk collapsing or something I'd be more worried about your computer.</br>  <br> email me at friedkun@gmail.com once you have a list or whatever.. </br>  <br>back off I called dibs</br>  do I dare buy the vivid butt?  <br>do you have a mother fucking rita mortio figure?</br>  <br>This is true, but as time passes and the quality of the fanbase diminishes  &gt;implying it was ever quality in the first place , the definition of secondaries has also grown lax for me. i.e. only got into the series because of the ufotable anime.<br><br><br>I'd like around 150 I think? But that's without taking in account of shipping, bwuh. 40$+ would suck.<br><br><br><br>O-oh...<br>Someone pls either spoonfeed me shipping recs or teach me secrets to lowering them while ensuring delivery security. Wanting to sell a small thing for 10$ and having to pay the same amount to ship it out is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I should have just ordered her off NY as soon as she went up. <br><br>If I forward from Animaru she'll end up costing as much as BIJ's price anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Only the One Coin Grande Kotobukiya collection  which I own the whole set, minus Judith and Yuri I'll probably manage to jew off locally thanks to kijiji . I was at my buyfag high in 2010~2011, I calmed down when they started releasing the Alter ones.</br>  <br><br>Almost everything is a bit off and worse than the illustration. Shame, it surely wasn't simple to design this one...</br></br>  <br>Damn. Would of paid top $ for the alter one.</br>    <br><br>Amazon.jp would have only been like 3200 yen shipping, but it's now 1.6x more expensive. Still considerably cheaper than EMS would be.</br></br>   Sell a nendo on ebay, get fucked over by the buyer, forced to refund  <br> Buyer contacts me today saying they received the item and are willing to pay me back  <br>Guess now I'll be able to get my doujins.</br></br>  <br> Nendofags are retarded <br>Nothing new</br></br>  Hmmm, another Link nendo.  <br>I live in australia and its like the shipping is about 2x more than america even though we're basicly the same distance away. fucking jew cunts asbfduyebgswgfb.<br><br><br>wow thats nice to hear<br>i bought a beelzebub bonus from someone on mfc and havent got it yet im going to dispute that nigger soon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First sexy loli I've ordered in a while, thanks for posting her. Might have missed her otherwise.</br>  <br>Shit happens with postal shipping - wouldn't be too sure it's the buyer that was wrong.<br><br><br>Good to hear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he tell you it shipped?</br>  <br> Hi there! I had this sent out on the 16th. If it's not there yet, it will be soon! (sent 7 days ago) <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>They are stunning to look at, I watched every single one of them get announced/released and struggled with temptation each time, coming out with my wallet unscathed  for better or worse, I seriously cannot tell . Good luck on your search, anon.</br>  <br>Well it might be caught up in customs who knows?<br>I don't know how long you have until you aren't allowed to make a dispute anymore but I'd wait until monday or tuesday if you can before doing so.</br></br>  <br>Why would you dispute it then? After the seller ships it it's not his responsibility anymore. I'm guessing you choose a method without tracking/insurance, too?</br>  <br>Yeah i have bought something from china before that took 5 weeks to get here. I disputed him and got a refund then 2 weeks later got the item lmao. To be fair the item description advertised "30 day shipping guaranteed" or something so i didn't feel that bad</br>  <br>then fuck it, get it for free nigga.</br>  <br>it's a private sale if he wanted to cover his arse he should've added tracking himself</br>  <br>It'd be perfect if she was bigger.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You need to email them and ask if that is right. A 14 inch pvc figure should not cost that much with EMS. Unless you are in South America or Asia accoding to their shipping rates. http://www.amiami.com/top/page/t/fa<wbr>q2.html#2<br><br>According to most sites, that megaman figure is 1.3kg or so not including packaging weight. You are getting jewed.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, it's on you to choose tracking. You had the option and you declined, now you shouldn't be able to come back crying for a refund.<br>Try taking responsibility for your actions for once. Chances are you'll get it anyway.</br></br>  <br>It happens, USPS offers flat rate shipping which is what I solely use.</br>  <br><br><br>If you ask for tracking and the seller doesnt give you tracking, then it's his fault, but if YOU don't want tracking then its all on you</br></br></br>  <br> I'm still getting it for dat belly <br>Bit ashamed of myself but who the fuck cares</br></br>  <br>2-3 day priority is best. If you print your own label online it costs the same as if you were to pay for standard shipping at the post office, but you get free tracking and $50 insurance with it.<br><br><br>Flat rate is shit unless you're selling books or bricks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's 1/8, a pretty good size for the space I have available. So personally, I don't mind.</br>  <br>I ship a shit tone of figures and gundams for around 6 bucks 20 max for stupidly large kits.</br>    <br>I'd probably be v&amp; for trying to get this</br>  <br>I don't think you understand the word "secondary."</br>  <br>normie detected</br>  <br>oppai loli is shit</br>  <br>It's disgusting because they added huge tits to a loli figure.</br>  <br>Well if you're too stupid to do a bit of simple math then having fun wasting money.</br>  <br>I got the WW one because he looked exactly like he did in game.</br>  <br> condoning cancer </br>  <br>Selling figmas that fit in one of the smallest boxes for about 4 bucks is fine when you make almost double profit off of them. Oddly enough I do a lot of shipping overseas especially to Spider land so it matters not when they pay for the item and at least 50 in shipping.</br>  <br>Flat rate is fucking godlike if you live in Hawaii or Alaska.</br>  So, futaba is having a thread about their favorite/best figure released during the first half of 2015, what is yours?<br><br>http://dat.2chan.net/46/res/797465.<wbr>htm<br><br>Pic related is my personal favorite, pink still being the better one.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>That doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br> USPS <br>That's US only, isn't it?<br> Candiafag here, is there any hope </br></br></br>  <br>USPS can ship anywhere. Now from Canada I'm sure the Royal Mail can as well.</br>  <br>Depends on how far you are from the border.</br>  <br><br>Where the fuck do you guys get high res pics of figures?<br>Fotofigue does some but they also always avoid pantyshots, which is lame.</br></br></br>   got fucking tired of my Asmodeus bunny style cast off chest piece fall because lack of factory adhesive <br> got some scotch tape and used it in place <br>Fuck it all</br></br>  <br>OP of futaba already covered it - it's Aludra for me.<br><br><br>MFC has half of them, there are also a bunch of blogs people use... and a few buyfags of course also simply take their own photographs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you got one without adhesive? Because she does come with adhesive pads.</br>  <br>I took the paper strips off the inside of her chest pieces and stuck them on her breasts. The left breast piece stays on, the right doesn't have enough and falls off constantly. I wrapped a tiny piece of scotch tape around itself and put it in where the adhesive is.<br><br>Shit sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>The pads they used just aren't great. Mine fell off 4-5 times the first day but has somehow managed to stay on since.<br><br>On a side note, Mammon's basket has been the opposite experience. It was fine getting her basket to stay in her hand when she came out but the other day I wanted to move some figs around in my display case and trying to get the basket to stay in her hand again has been a complete nightmare. I'm afraid to even sneeze in my room because it might make the basket fall out of her hand.</br></br></br>   Want like 3 figures/ preorders really badly <br> hours got cut at work <br>Life is suffering</br></br>  <br>I found them to do their job great , compared to the ones in Lucifer and OS' Ignis they have better area and higher tack.<br><br>Actually I didn't notice the adhesive the first day and the same and her fingers keep the cup in place just like that, are you sure you re placing them correctly?</br></br></br>  Do you ever wonder what your proxy/forwarder thinks when you buy doujinshi?  <br>no</br>  <br>"This guy has good taste."</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>I use forwarders to buy onaholes and lube, I am so far beyond you</br>  <br>I wonder what he'll have under his tunic.</br>  <br>Stop fucking posting that image, every time you do I get triggered over Yokatta stealing the money I gave them for it and never seeing it in the mail.

Love Live completely won this year, followed by Free and Dragon Ball Z. <br><br>I picked up Ema's official daki for 40 dollars, was a bit surprised to see it, and that it was so cheap. Wanted to pick up a Shimakaze daki too but most of them sold out already, with the ones left being too expensive. Also bought a 20 dollar art book for 35, but I'm too pleased with it to care.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mother of god...</br></br>  <br>Wait until it pops up on Mandarake.</br>   going to cons <br>fucking casuals</br>  <br>Probably just different bodies with one magnetic hand and some accessories.</br>  does semen stick to resin harder than pvc?

Not only you but your friend was also a lazy shit and made his mom do it. Fucking hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lmao</br>  <br>Sounds like you owe someone $1000 for being a dumbshit.</br>  <br>His friend did me a favor so I felt obligated to.

Just kill yourself.</br>  <br>Well jeez, I can't fix the situation except by paying him money that I don't have.

He said he'd try to see her as more than his sister but makes no guarantee. In his head, no matter how much they've been altered genetically so that even their kids won't have defects, he says the fact that we are brother and sister from the same parents doesn't change. He can't reconcile this fact and he isn't capable of romantic love thus far.</br>  <br>Yet he doesn't because he only sees her as a sister.

It’s him!”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Tatsuya extended his ‘eye’ towards the direction of Masaki’s sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is that psychopass... just kidding  <br>That's because he knows that he already belongs to the Miyuki.</br>  <br>Not in the way she wants. Tatsuya isn't her doormat, he clearly runs the show and Maya knows it.</br>  <br> Adopted grandson.  </br>  <br>Wait he undressed her? So he got her down to her underwear or nude and just said "no thanks" and left her there thinking they were going to bang?</br>  <br><br> Not in the way she wants. <br>He hasn't realized that yet. It's only a matter of time.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, got her down to her underwear and roughly threw her in bed then left. The next day she complained that he undressed her too roughly.</br>  <br>That's how hard she lost, huh? Not even surprised. That explains why Mayumifags are so mad.</br>  <br>If he hasn't realized it in 16 volumes, he isn't going to realize it any more than he has. He's got limited emotions and he already said he'd be by her side and never abandon her. As far as he's concerned, he's complying with her wishes and doing what he wants at the same time. He's happy seeing her as his cute little sister, he doesn't need anything else. And she's fine as long as he never abandons her or thinks she'd abnormal. Really, their relationship hasn't changed one bit since the beginning. Read the translations for volume 16, despite their engagement, they have remained the same. It's others who are perceiving it differently. <br><br>What I don't get is why Maya announced him as her son to the TMC. Isn't her ex going to know that's a load of bullshit?</br></br></br>  Cut inside  <br>Wow Tatsuya is a gives no fucks dick and Mayumi is absolutely pathetic</br>  President ends up with him right? Not that Jumanji scum  <br>Jumanji is based as fuck</br>  <br>"I can't hold my liquor much, but I'm the type who remembers everything" <br><br>Tatsuya wanted to flee that place in that very moment. Unfortunately for him, he understood that he couldn't do that in such situation as a man . <br><br>"…though I feel that you don't have to be that rough" <br><br>Certainly, he did shove Mayumi to the bed roughly. However, could he be blamed because of that? He questioned himself when he recalled. Yet, to say 'you're the one who want to strip to your underwear' be a king cobra grade boomerang. <br><br>Mayumi was still looking at Tatsuya shyly. <br><br>In this very awkward atmosphere, it was a mental hard work to send Mayumi back to the nearest station to go home, while Tatsuya waited at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We aren't sure who ends up with who at this point, though wouldn't surprise me if her father makes her engagement to Juumonji official next volume.</br>  He can't stop being a fag long enough to fuck his sister that's for sure  How can such an old man make such a great LN?  <br>Ok so she was coming on to him while wasted and wanted to ride his baloney pony and he didn't want to take advantage of a drunk chick who wasn't his immuto</br>  <br>He's a 58 year old chuuni. Some just never grow up.</br>  <br> tfw his new editor made him drop the public transport system of the future </br>  <br>I don't think he would have slept with her even if she was sober. And he doesn't want to fuck his sister either. He was in Kyoto on a specific mission, he has no time for silly grills and their whims.</br>  <br>Not a chance, it's still going strong as of the latest volume. Public transport end is one we can safely say will happen.</br>  <br>He got a new editor?</br>  <br>that's what i heard from 2ch</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Updated to reflect the loss then.</br>  <br>I think his old editor was the Oreimo one so we have no clue about this new one.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was the man who helped our lord and savior with the Oreo. Pretty much confirms to me that Miyuki won't be winning.</br>  <br>Mahouka will turn into a wholesome family values LN about what it means to be a true patriot.</br>   Kirito smacks tats a little <br> He straight up breaks the game code <br>Calm down nigga</br></br>  <br>Is that what happens in the crossover?</br>  <br>Yeah, Tatsuya was pretty upset he lost and wanted a rematch with the Blackswordsman.</br>  <br>Doushio~</br>  <br>What did Tatsuya think would happen? He can't beat somebody in a video game, he's a total scrub, that's one of his only weaknesses.</br>  <br>Don't forget Kirito's VR reflexes are the best in the world save for Aids-chan. Kirito can reflect whatever magic bullshit Oniisama can throw his way right back at him, at speeds that would make Accelerator and the Flash jealous.</br>  <br>I guess Tatsuya really doesn't like to lose either. He admits right before that he sucks at fighting with weapons.</br>  <br>Transform into a magical girl</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>Magical Lyrical Moon Prism BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL ACTIVATE and make it double!<br>Now you can't get it out of your head.</br></br></br>  <br>Be an actually interesting and likeable character</br>  he cannot beat demonbane  <br>Onii-sama is the greatest.<br>He is made out of pure thoughts and righteous anger.<br><br>Now lets listen to some quality music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sEb<wbr>4yh1tObM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>     finally get around to watching pic related <br> download the dual audio version because /a/ always goes on about how good the dubbed version is <br> the dubbed version is fucking awful <br>You lied to me /a/</br></br></br>  That is what you get for listening dubfags.   how to spot a redditor  <br><br>Even the nips know the english dub was better</br></br>  <br> You lied to me /a/ <br>No, you just have shit taste.</br></br>  The guys didn't lie to you.

You can like things that aren't very good, I don't know why this isn't getting through to you.</br>  <br>That's how I got into anime back in the late nineties. Objectively good story has always been fairly rare, but good characterization was more common 12 years ago. If anything has really taken a dip in the past decade, it's the characters.

If something entertains you it has succeeded at it and you find it good. If someone enjoys LoGH and Glasslip a lot and on the same level then they find it good. <br><br>If something is objectively good in terms of sales, then it has sold a lot.

Your opinion on storytelling tools affects your reaction to it.<br>The classic Nabokov vs Dostoevsky dilemma. <br>Do you watch anime for the thematic and philisophical themes being explored? Or is the behavior of the setting and characters more important? Does it have to be aesthetically unique to be good? If it's aesthetically unique, does that excuse a lack of thematic depth? Can a dry narrative be excused if the theme is unique? How does one set a priority? <br>Your answer to all of these are all subjective. Therefore the building of a criteria is subjective.

Toriyama's one of the last classic mangakas who knew how to properly pace stuff.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oK2<wbr>SE7LKmS4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Did this track ever play in the Boo Saga Kai?</br>  <br>Let's hope it will have more of the comedic tone of DB/BoF and less of the angst on DBZ</br>  broly should have shown up in the first episode so i could see everyone's reaction  <br>So like Boo Saga then?<br>Honestly I'd rather have it be less serious than Freeza/Cell Sagas but more serious than Boo. <br>AND LESS FUCKING GOTEN AND TRUNKS</br></br></br>  It was Dragon Ball, exactly what people wanted and got. It boggles my fucking mind they're going to make a retelling of the movies first, tho.  Yeah how fucking stupid starting with light-hearted antics to introduce the main characters whilst simultaneously foreshadowing the arrival of the first villain.  I'm really fucking excited. I can't help but love Dragonball. I want to wait and see the whole season at once though, I don't like waiting a week at a time. I'll keep myself busy with other things until it's done. <br><br>I do actually like the English VA though but I don't think I can wait THAT long. Subs should be fine.</br></br>  <br>Disagreed. More Goten and Trunks. Would like to see them older though. More Gohan as well. I like Goku but we need someone else to do something for once. Vegeta would be acceptable.</br>  <br> super saiyan god super saiyan </br>  <br>This. Man, how impatient are some of you?</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't want more Gohan, Piccolo, Tenshinhan, Krillin, Vegeta and  Yamcha .<br>I said I don't want Goten and Trunks since they were the worst fucking thing in Boo Saga. They're obnoxious little shits that are completely unlikeable. Goku and Gohan were such pieces of shit.</br></br>  only thing i want out of this series is sss bra (super saiyan slut)<br><br>toei pls</br></br>  Anons, what i am watching ? 5ep in, it makes me feel uncomfortable.  <br> it makes me feel uncomfortable. <br>Wait until episode 9, human.</br></br>  Whats so uncomfortable about it?   makes me feel uncomfortable. <br>Good.</br>  i want to dress like this and build a navi in my room  <br><br> tfw you can never bust a nut inside of her while she builds her computer like that on the floor </br></br>  It makes me feel uncomfortable in my pants.  <br><br><br>Please do not sexualise the Lain.</br></br></br>      <br>I know what you mean, OP. I've never had a show make me feel as uncomfortable as Lain did; although I've heard that Texhnolyze is similar.</br>  <br>I don't know how Lain would make somebody uncomfortable. Texhnolyze on the other hand...</br>  Can anyone explain the appeal of texhnolyze?<br>I love lain but hate that show</br>  <br>I think for me it's the overwhelming atmosphere of loneliness/disconnectedness, at least in the first half of the show. It really messed with me when I first watched it.</br>  <br>Why do you hate it? I enjoyed the action, the atmosphere, and the characters, though they could have been developed more.</br>    OP here, the marathon is still going, 11Ep. My brain is warm and i feel more depressed, i think i missed some thinks.  <br>*things</br>  <br>Feel free to ask away about certain things when you're done.</br>   it's a "Madoka teaches the girls about American culture" episode <br><br>Seriously, why is Gen such a hack? I mean the Thanksgiving episode was pretty good due to the Sayaka-Homura truce shenanigans but the July 4th, MLK day, and handegg episodes were utter shit. UTTER SHIIIIIIIIIIIIT</br></br>  <br> implying Shinbo didn't write those episodes </br>  <br> Shinbo <br> Doing anything anymore </br></br>  I got excited for a split second. Fuck you OP.

She does her best.</br>   not liking the MLK day <br>How do you not like Madoka skipping school to pay her respects to a great American and getting Kyouko addicted to black culture when she meets her in the city, making Sayaka and Mami have to deprogram her because she's thinking about starting a gang</br>  <br>Hahahaha... no. Kill yourself OP.</br>    <br>Aren't they ashamed of milking this series for all it's worth? I've dropped it long ago, couldn't stomach all the shitty fillers.</br>  <br> not liking the GOAT episode where Madoka and Mami took Kyouko out shopping <br>Shit like that are the real gems of the series</br></br>  <br>Take off your nostalgia googles. If it wasn't a 1st season episode you would see it for the shit it is. Try watching it in the middle of season 9 or 11, you will see it's just as crappy as the rest of the fillers</br>  i just finished rebellion, i don't understand why homura is evil all she did was bring everyone back, law of cycle is still in effect.   what happened to QB at the end?    So when are they gonna realize those are all fantasies they be having in the postlife following their tragic deaths and that their souls will soon be recycled as per the new Law of Recycles so that they can be (re)born in the real world with other identities. Face it, the foreshadowing that began cropping up since the Butcher came back to the helm in this season is getting rather heavy.    Rape scene when?  <br><br>Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.</br></br>  <br>how so?</br>  <br>She forgot to return Madoka's Valentine chocolates on White Day and deserves to have her feet tickled.</br>      <br><br>I liked the two-parter where Mami-san got a driver's license and then got lured into the Mitakaihara extreme drifting death race.</br></br>  <br> deserves to have her feet cut off and being left to bleed out on the street <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>The best episode is final season's final episode.

Madoka is already perfect. There's no way you can make her better.</br></br>    <br>Yes, I had that coming.<br><br><br>Now why would I do that?<br><br><br>I know that. Have you seen Kyouko?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>          <br> American culture <br>Is that a joke?</br></br>  <br>Yeah I've seen her around. What about her?</br>  <br>There's no non-lewd interpretation for what you said.</br>  I thought Madoka was just one season?  <br>I meant have you taken a look at her. Such perfection.  But damn her clones must wander far off in search of the best food. <br><br><br>I realized that after submitting the post and reading it.</br></br></br>  </br>  <br>My spoilering ability has been subpar lately.</br>  <br>It is. It got a movie called rebellion which is a continuation of the series.</br>  <br><br> they haven't seen the SoL Second season </br></br>  <br>Post more fat magical girls please, Apple.</br>  <br>I personally like the episode where they harvest their tomatoes and make several tomato-based dishes.</br>  <br><br><br>Not as good as the arcade episode were Sayaka finally tried DDR and fell flat on her face.</br></br></br>  It'd just watch it just to here madoka's seiyuu trying to speak English.<br>It's like Ika Musume all over.</br>  <br>Or how about the episode where Madoka flushed her keys to her apartment down the toilet and had to crash at everyone's place?</br>  <br>Or the one where Mami make's cheese cake for everyone only for the whole thing to be eaten by Nagisa.</br>  <br>That was the one were she met Yunocchi, right?<br><br><br>Damn Nagisa. It looked so tasty too.</br></br></br></br>    <br> i don't understand why homura is evil <br>So they can milk more chapters.</br></br>    <br>Yes, and that's also when Mami made dinner with Hiro.</br>  <br>That episode was the most comfiest one ever made.</br>          <br> that PSA episode where Nagisa became a delinquent and organized a gang <br> that fight where Kyouko lets herself get beaten by Nagi's gang just to show them how bad violence and delinquency are <br><br>I went in expecting comedy but I received feels instead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't talk about that episode, but man, Kyouko is a tough girl.</br>    <br>Good end.</br>  <br>i stopped posting in madoka thread about 8 months ago. this is only the second one i've been in since. once tripshits overran the threads and the natural tedium kicked it, everyone left.</br>        <br>That's weak anon</br>  <br>reporting from indiana<br>a fuckton</br></br>      what a snoozefest    Praise Yuno  <br>Yep. Time for sleep</br>  <br>What should we do, !HOMU?<br><br><br>I don't have anymore.</br></br></br></br>  This thread just makes me depressed. I wish there was SoL Madoka.  <br>Impromptu Kyouko night.</br>    <br> :( </br>  <br>But it's not Friday.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br><br>So?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have another pictures like that but couldn't find it.</br>  I love Madoka. Why don't more people like Madoka? It's all Homura this Homura that.  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Kyouko night is Saturday. It's still Saturday here.<br><br><br><br>good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Madoka received the least amount of character development and Homura the most.</br>  <br>A lot of Madokas fans have been taken by the Law of Cycles. !GMeguca managed to avoid that.</br>  <br>For like an hour or two, right?</br>  <br>I love madoka, she is my waifu<br><br>She doesn't need character development because she is already perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>20 minutes. To be fair, though, we didn't get a proper Kyouko night earlier.</br>  <br>Because creepy weirdoes with stalker tendencies identify with a creepy weirdo with stalker tendencies.</br>  <br>Found it, so fuck you.</br>  <br>your faggotry is subpar</br>  <br>No u</br>  <br>Homura loves Madoka enough for everyone.</br>  <br>So Kyubey? Imagine getting annoyed to make contracts<br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you know what, I take that back. I just realized it's not derogatory. fucking mexicans</br>  Summer bum-Kyouko.  <br> haven't seen SoL season 2 of Madoka written by Ume <br> 2043-28 </br></br>  <br>kek.<br><br><br>Perfect time for popsicles.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your popsicle or mine?</br>  <br>Madoka is pretty 'normal', everyone likes her. Not much to discuss or speculate about.  I see way more Madoka posts in this thread. </br>  <br>my popsicle in your mom you fucking nigger</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she gets my popsicles. Without my permission either.</br>  <br> tfw Kyouko raids your fridge </br>  We are talking about popsicles, right?  This thread has reduced.  <br>What else could we be talking about, Applecchi?</br>  <br>I don't know why anon would put his popsicle in other anons mom then insult him. Also you added an extra c.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's just his Tourette's acting up.<br><br> Also you added an extra c <br>My nickname for you is perfectly fine the way it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, poor guy.<br><br>Okay then. Still sounds like Apple chi.</br></br></br>  <br>I did not know tourettes made people shove popsicles around</br>  <br>I didn't either, but that's the only explanation for his outburst.</br>  <br>Your post reminded me of this.</br>  <br>It's supposed to be the same sort of nickname as Yunocchi.</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br>I'm not really seeing the connection.</br>  <br>God that messy yet beautiful hair.</br>  Long day. Was a good 4th of July. So sleepy. Goodnight meguca friends  <br>it's kind of a mutual thing</br>  <br>It's good that you know.</br>  <br>Good night</br>  <br>Night.</br>  <br>???</br>  <br>Good night</br>  <br>Good night.<br><br/></br></br>      Good night everyone.  If you were Sayaka before episode 7, would you know that Kamijo might ended up with Hitomi if you cured him?  <br>I was thinking about Hitomi and Kamijou reasoning : Kamijou wants a better girl, Hitomi, being a perfect girl she is want a non-crippled Kamijou.<br>Sayaka was the only girl available to Kamijou but by curing him, now other better girls are available to her. Where did she went wrong?</br></br>  toasting homu  <br>have you not seen rebellion?</br>  <br>Bitch gave no indication of liking him, but middle school is a confusing time of hormones and emotions, and I've seen crazier love happen on a whim.</br>  <br>hitomi is the best, and she gets what she wants. She also makes sure to keep filthy lesbians like sayaka in check.</br>  <br>Hitomi vs kvn on Sayaka's sexuality when.</br>  <br>kevin willl get btfo by the green</br>  Does anybody else want to cum inside Madoka's vagina over and over again until her womb is flooded and then shove Homura's face in it?  <br>No i dont have shit taste.<br><br>The proper way is to fill the pumpkin with seeds and make mado watch and wish she cluld be a apart of it.</br></br></br>  Madoka loves you all.  <br><br>Madoinka? Not Mammies?</br></br>  <br>She didn't think that she is not a top female on bigger scene. Sure, she was the best in Kamijou's reach before making her wish but after that, it is a different story.<br><br><br>Were you get banned from /u/ or what?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> bitter waifufags and their retarded entitled delusions <br>Pls, the only thing you rats would get is the steamroller.</br></br></br>  This thread went alow.  <br>*slow</br>   she just shoots them and gets fat on hamburgers, then marries Homura           <br>Shoots who?</br>  <br>Them</br>  <br>Them who??</br>    <br>Them. She shoot them with that gun.</br>  <br>Damn</br>  <br>You don't mean THAT gun? That's crazy!</br>    <br>My heart skipped way to many beats. Anyway, Kyouko needs to eat more in that image unless she wants look as boney has Homura.</br>  <br>Whose gonna buy food for her? You?</br>    <br>What the fuck are you even on about?</br>  <br>Yes. I can buy food for her and make food for her.<br><br><br>Now you're just fucking with me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Right, how can they interpret that chapter as anything but a jab at americans is beyond me. Clearly Madoka doesn't intend to return any time soon.</br>    <br> Please! ;_; I don't want another dream like that! </br>    <br>I don't suppose you're that same anon, are you?</br>  Hmm, nothing happening: the thread  <br>what a lazy bum</br>  <br>Hopefully that apple cheers Sayaka up. I know it did Kyouko.</br>      <br>K-Kyouko doesn't have to hand me to a naked Sayaka!</br>  <br>We know Kyouko and Sayaka are both your girls.</br>  <br>Can you not.</br>  <br>Only Kyouko! Sayaka is my friend.</br>      I just bought a bar of chocolate that had me and Kyouko sweating as we ate it. Holy hell.  Oh my goodness, Sayaka-chan!  <br>Yes anon, Sayaka-chan.</br>  Are we still talking about popsicles?  <br>I think that finished.</br>  <br>Awh. Well if you have any leftover, I'll gladly take your popsicle. I'm parched.</br>  <br>Assuming Kyouko didn't take them all.</br>  <br>Nonsense, I'm sure there's gotta be at least one left! Can I take a look?</br>  How would Homura react if Madoka in her fake world started dating someone (boy or a girl, doesn't matter, don't bring that shit up)?<br><br>Would she say she's fine with it because she just wants Madoka to be happy while crying herself to sleep every night? Would she sperg out and delete that person from existence?<br><br>She's crazily in love with Madoka but also wants Madoka to be happy, even if it's at her own expense, and she really hates herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's impossible. You ate the chocolate bar alone.</br>  <br>I think she'd say "as long as my beloved is happy" and then obsessively stalk the person in question waiting for any sign that they might hurt Madoka so she can kill them.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure there isn't anymore. You know how Kyouko is. Always gotta eat all of her food.</br>  <br>This guy knows what's up.</br>  <br>Well, I didn't come all this way for nothing! There must be something you can give me..</br>  <br>What do you want?</br>  <br>man, you are clumsy as shit. I swear, 1 out of 2 of your posts have typos and missing letters.</br>  <br>Um, something refreshing.. and that'll make my mouth water..</br>  <br>I know, but that one was the biggest fuck up.<br><br><br>Like?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Um, idk... It's kind of embarrassing. I'll just open up my mouth and surprise me with something okay?</br>  <br>I don't know how to surprise with food unless the person is Kyouko.</br>  <br>Homu is a cuck so she'd probably watch them from a distance and masturbate when they fuck. Then she'll go home and have her familiars pelt her with tomatoes and call her names.</br>  <br>I'm sure I'll be fine with anything you pick! just make sure I eat it all.</br>  <br>s-source?</br>  Sayaka is one of the worst written characters in anything ever.  <br>How about grapes?</br>  <br>can I interest you in some krokodil</br>  <br>Good work Clapistan: your mere presence manages to fuck up anime. Can Russia and China start dropping the nukes and be done with it already?</br>  New episode soon.  It's a recap.  Reminder that Hermes is a filthy opportunist and not the rightful king  truely a religion of peace  <br>Aw Shit, that would be fucking disappointing, these studios who make a filler out of recaps are just disrespecting their audience, in this age fans fucking know exactly what's going on. Crikey, I hope it isn't true</br>  I want to fuck Elam.    <br>Did you not see the preview last week?</br>  <br>Nope sorry, did I miss something?</br>  <br>they announced the recap, they probably need some time to catch up with production, the last episode was full of quality</br>  <br><br>Huh, kinda reminds me of Lust from FMA.</br></br>  So have to wait one more week to see the Indian guy?<br><br>I hope the dub version would give him an accent.</br></br>  <br>Fucking hell</br>   recap <br>Oh well.</br>    <br> clothes <br>Picked.</br></br>  So is this show any good?  <br><br>OH MY LORD JESUS</br></br>  <br>That softness with the faint trace of muscles...

But to be honest I haven't been paying much attention visually to this. Sort of had to mentally phase out the quality so that I could continue watching it without my blood pressure rising.</br>  <br>What are the fights too exciting and thrilling for you if you don't?</br>  <br>No, the quality makes my autism flare and I am unable to enjoy the show. Arguably I am only watching it to see the manga in motion, which I only started reading because I have no hope the novels will be translated anytime soon.</br>  <br><br>This makes up for today's recap.</br></br>  If Pars=Persia then does Sindhura=Sindh? i.e. a province of modern day Pakistan.  <br>It's a fucking fantasy.

It's flat like a pancake.</br>  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty fun<br><br> When should we see the girl in pic related? </br></br></br>  <br>Next episode for sure</br>  After watched the OP&amp;ED, i know why this show have 2 OP and 3 ED  <br>Next episode.</br>  <br>How many episodes is going to have this show? because the LN is actually on volume 5 so they can go and rush until that volume (cuz cliffhanger at the end) or they can just stay with 12 episodes and 3 volumes adapted.</br>  <br> Rabbit girl isn't actually a Rabbit girl <br><br><br>Lame</br></br></br></br>   art and animation looks beautiful as fuck <br> music sounds mellifluous <br> compelling story <br> yet nobody cares about it <br>This must be Pleiades of this season.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is quite nice.  Shit anime, how can there be conflict when the MC is the strongest man in the world?  So everyone's going to die right? The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. I hope he abandons his comrades and watches them all get slaughtered as he flees.  <br>I think full 3 vols would be a nice stop.<br><br><br>Really? I think they gonna change after some character left and join.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HAVE YOU EVER READ ONEPUNCH?!</br>  <br>12 episodes. Some say that they will adapt only 2 volumes would be pretty cool if that's true.<br><br>Volume 2 would be better.</br></br></br>   THIS  <br> IS  <br> SPARTA!!! </br></br>  <br>He says strongest but he's a trickster. It grinds my autism.</br>  AOTS  it's set on 1400ish México  <br>Had the stupid LN thing where two characters that both have the same knowledge exposit to each other for no reason other than the audience doesn't have information, but other than that, it was good. A very nice pilot. Hope the quality keeps up.</br>  <br>You know what, if you follow Passione's twitter account right now, you're even in first 20 to follow them.<br><br>https://twitter.com/office_passione<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>How would a mediocre shounen be AOTS?</br>  <br>I love the Aztec setting. It's pretty rare to see fantasy anime having a non-european world. Definitely the setting itself is a breath of fresh air, we will have to see rest of the show to see if it ends up being good. Had a good start though</br>  I had a lot of fun watching this ep. I like the MC. The combination of cocksure and complete dick dirty fighter is enjoyable. I like the setting, the art and music were OK.<br><br>This is the sort of show could go horribly, horribly wrong, but I'll keep watching for now.</br></br>  <br>The strongest is a trickster, simple as that.</br>  Question for those who read the LN, does the story get serious/dark in the future? I don't like suffering or edgy stuff.  <br>They are expanding very slowly.</br>  <br>Look for the previous thread if you want big ass spoilers.</br>  <br>I know the feeling. There's a ton of terrible LN adaptations out there that start off promising with great pilots, and then the budget just goes to shit. Not to mention I think the longer an LN goes on, the worse it gets. The medium as a whole seems to have a problem of being needlessly drawn out. The planning ends after like one volume, then they start to wear the premise thin with bullshit.<br><br>Fingers crossed. I think I'll like the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Shhhhhhhhut up, Anon. It's too early to say that.</br>  Cant wait for Black Rabbit.   reading vol. 1 <br> finally find out   who the fake is <br> "Ok, now the plot can finally continue!" <br> read the epilogue <br> mfw <br><br>Are they fucking serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How the fuck did Passione go from Rail Wars to this? Holy shit what an improvement.  <br>Better director</br>  <br>those rabbit hips are so unf</br>  <br> The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. <br>Have you seen the episode? That's when he was young and went to his master.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The second episode ends a little bit after goldov shows up. 80% chance it'll just be two volumes or at the very most 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Black guy looks like an asshole.<br><br>Let me guess, is he MC's rival in getting some rabbit's pussy?</br></br></br>  <br> but he's a trickster <br>Hisoka wants to have a word with you.</br></br>  <br>He's not an asshole.<br> rival in getting some rabbit's pussy <br>Adlet isn't interested.</br></br></br>  <br>He's her knight.</br>  LNfag here. Chamo is best girl post.  <br> token loli <br> not even fanservice <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>yeah he's more intrested in Remy than Nash</br>  <br> Adlet isn't interested. <br>B-but those hips goddamn. <br>It's asking to be destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to put my penis inside the rabbit girl.</br>  <br>Only thing that irked me, is that his little fire to the face trick in the fight didn't blind the old guy or burned his face.</br>  <br>LNfag here, Chamo is an annoying cunt.</br>  <br>  muh kill <br>  muh pet <br>  muh angry <br>worse charecter ever</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/xgdqswbuva.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  So is the LN to this actually good or is it just generic shitty LN tier shit?  <br>Depends on your tastes. It's not harem for starters, more like mystery.</br>  <br> fagboy protag fighting and edgy bullshit <br>What do you think?</br></br>  The designs and animation aren't that great but I liked the setting.  <br>Wow, you serious?</br>  <br><br>The only thing that grinds my autism is that the story is supposedly in an Aztec/Maya setting, yet there are no human sacrifices.</br></br>  <br>It's fantasy/mystery. I'm personally not one who likes mystery but hey, if it's your cup of tea. Had to drop it because I couldn't stomach the characters.</br>  <br>Now, I am not a fag, but the MC's gradient hair tingles my dick.<br>Honestly, gradient hair in general does. We need more of it.</br></br>  <br>It's like people don't even think Chamo is adorable as fuck.</br>  <br>You mean to tell me there's no romance between the two?</br>  <br>Not really. Next thing you know and she's trying to stab Adlet.</br>  <br>None at all.</br>  <br>I am incredibly inclined to agree 100%<br><br>Mora a cunt<br>Nash a literal beastiality slut<br>Molonia a shit<br>Fremy is love though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She loves dogs.</br>  <br>What's the point of a token loli? She's never going to be anything more than that</br>  <br><br>Dropped like it's hot.</br></br>  <br>She's the required team-fight specialist in terms of combat.<br>She's the naiive yet OP character to be turned against the rest as necessary when it comes to spotting the 7th.<br>She can the strong point or the weak link of the party as the plot requires, as in vol 3 or 4.</br></br></br>  <br>None.</br>  <br>Rabbit only has tits. I always associated her with light blue rather than yellow for some reason.</br>  <br>So, a token loli.</br>    <br>Brute strength gets you fucking nowhere here, the kyouma bosses are all clever bastards that will fuck you up if you're dumb.</br>  <br>Well I mean after Rail Wars, expectations of the studio must not be great.</br>  <br>The wild ride never ends.</br>  <br>Truly we never would have guessed by the iconic Aztec-like architecture and apparel.</br>  <br>Shame. she has the best design out of the girls. <br>I almost thought I finally found a main girl who's also the best girl.</br></br>  <br>On the subject of Rail Wars, how well did the show do sales wise?</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Yeah, look at what happened to Chamo</br>  <br> Caring about romance </br>  <br> Rail Wars <br> Sales <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  <br>No Quetzalcoatl/Kukulcan.</br>  <br>You poor fool.</br>  I wanted him not to be chosen but still be wrecking shit.  <br>I expect them to be the next Gonzo.</br>  <br>Indeed.<br>Looking forward to it.</br></br>  <br>But that's not Fremy.</br>  <br>It's possible that she is interested in him but the romance is between Adlet and Fremy.</br>  Is the LN finished?  <br>no</br>  I am the bone of my sword <br> Steel is my body and fire is my blood <br> I have created over a thousand blades <br> Unknown to Death, Nor known to Life <br> Have withstood pain to create many weapons <br> Yet, those hands will never hold anything <br> So as I pray, unlimited blade works.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   generic oriental epic music à la Disney Alladin <br> disgusting art and animation, full of CGI, pale aztecs, otaku baits, and more <br> all the budget (probably that of next episode too) spent on the tournament battle, the rest of the show filled to the brim with QUALITY <br> the most mediocre ``play it safe'' OP and ED <br> story is some mix of everything the MAL and tumblr fanbases would love -- super strong arrogant charming MC with a tragic past, a beautiful mysterious traitorous princess, pretend-fantasy, ANCIENT EVIL HAS AWAKENED AND YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE, jungle shenanigans, edgy, grandiose, magic, betrayal, psychopath <br><br>Perhaps this whole post could have been summarised simply with <br> LN adaptation <br>Moreover, the threads and the fanbase are pure cancer. Spoilers everywhere, delusional circlejerk, /v/, pleb culture, pretending their little shitty book wannabe is good and /a/ likes it, etc. Truly this will be one of the worst shows this season. Maybe even the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bait</br>  <br>gb2 your LWA thread</br>  <br>Sod off, Anon.<br>Just because Fate threads are done doesn't mean you can shitpost anywhere else.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Nice rebuttal, faglords.<br> he is not part of the circlejerk so he is troll <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS. previous thread cancerous as fuck. they dont even hide the spoilers</br>  <br>C-can i pick none?</br>  <br>Why does one has to refute when your opinion is subjective to yourself?<br>Although I agree that there were a lot of flying spoilers in the last thread.</br></br>  <br>You actually see that he's missing a brow and half his beard.</br>  I do not like Adlet.<br><br>Im glad to see a more assertive MC but he's just a cunt. He starts trouble and is rewarded for it while he just repeats how strong he is over and over. That's not engaging and certainly not endearing.<br><br>the princess is a right boring shit too. I know it's only episode one but I don't think it's so much to ask to at least pretend to have likable characters</br></br></br></br>  AOTS with charlotte  <br><br><br>Nice samefag.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of power does a Salt Saint have, anyway?!</br>   Mesoamerica setting and artstyle <br>Well this is a surprise.</br>  Holy crap, the battle animations where fucking good. I just hope they don't drop the quality.  <br>A hit turn you into clump of salt, very OP.</br>  <br>Stop samefagging, idiot.</br>  <br>Producing salt</br>  <br> Ctrl+f Chamo and best girl <br> One result <br>I came to make sure a best girl post for Chamo was made. Anon didn't disappoint me today. <br><br>Chamo is the strongest and greatest.</br></br></br></br></br>  This anime gave me some Yona of the Dawn vibes. Anyone else?  His eyes clearly say "look at this shit outfit I gotta wear".  <br>You sound angry. Why are you so angry, anon?</br>   Watch first episode <br> Seems interesting, let's check it out <br> Start reading LN <br> First paragraph, bitch princess is trying to impale fagMC <br>We're in for a wild ride, I see. At least I'll be suitably entertained.</br></br></br></br>  How will adlet beat fucking demons? He only uses traps to fight, unlike the blade princess who seems OP as fuck.  <br>His the world's strongest man. That's how.</br>  <br>literaly Cirno</br>  <br>He hold them off with his petty tricks, bunny is the one finishing them off.</br>  <br>Poison mainly, also stuff like flash and smoke bombs, he actually brews up all the shit he uses himself. Against the actual monsters, it's pretty effective, but then again all the other heroes are even moreso.<br><br>He does get his shit pushed in relatively quickly to the point he realizes he's not so hot shit though. The hot shit thing point of view he maintains for himself has relevance to his motives and character though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's actually pretty respectable all round, even without his gadgets. That said, brains is his biggest weapon.</br>  <br>Poisons and bombs work on them, they're more aberrations of nature than demons.</br>  <br>Why do you think he trained so hard? And what tells you his weapons are not effective? He doesn't only fight with hidden weapons, he trained his body and is smart as well, he's the Batman of the group.</br>  <br><br><br><br>These is the most retarded thing I've ever read. <br>It's as bad as saying that guns can kill servants from fate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to enjoy this anime but I know it's not going to end resolved. Is it too much to ask for a high fantasy anime that actually fucking has an ending?</br>  <br>are* Fuck.</br>  Looks pretty good. I think that its more because direction was decent and it was written pretty well than because of how it looks. lets just hope they don't shat themselves  <br>What the flying fuck made you think that these were anything like servants from Fate? Most of them are barely any better than animals.</br>  <br>Guns &gt; Magics<br>Don't you have Gate thread to shitpost into?</br></br>  Just finished and I gotta say that Adlet is like the Yona of this series, probably the weakeast fuck.  <br>Goldof fights with a spear and heavy armor, Hans dual wields swords, they are among the strongest heroes, faggot.</br>  <br>How are the two related? To be honest, if humans had NBC protection and even WWII level tech, this would have been over so much faster.</br>  <br>He's the strongest anon, THE STRONGEST.</br>  <br>His only the STRONGEST MAN. Chamo is still the strongest person aside from the OP time saint.</br>  <br>Chamo is retarded and a jobber, he can easily outwit her.</br>  At the end Edlet and the Sword princess will fuck and marry. <br>Remember these words.</br>  <br>If by fuck and marry, you mean battle to the death in a climatic battle then sure.</br>  <br><br> smartest/batman of the group <br>There's someone smarter than him in the group.<br>Hans Humpty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither won't die and she'll regain her senses.<br>Come on anon, it's like you never watched anime before.</br></br>  <br>Amen, brother.</br>  <br>No, Hans is the second smartest.</br>  She sure looked damn nice throughout that opening episode.  <br>I think Hans is more experienced, but Adlet sees the bigger picture and is generally regarded as less likely to be the 7th, which is why he gets the leadership position.</br>  <br> Edlet <br>Sure, that can happen. <br>Adlet will fuck and marry Fremy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, if the shit posters can do it so can he.</br>  <br>And what happens to Fremy?</br>  <br>She's the best girl, don't believe the fake spoilers.</br>  <br>Everyone like to shit on her but honestly the flowers' plan isn't great either<br> You have 30 days to seal the demon king  <br> If you had to fail the world is be fucked. <br> Repeat this every 100 years. <br>If one team fail they are doomed. They should find a way to get rid of the Maijin for good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tender loving by Aldet. Seriously, she is by far the most likely if you really read the LNs.</br>  <br>Adlet is the one who solved the mystery, he relies on Hans a lot because he knows how smart he is too and Hans fears Adlet the most. Though Hans is perceptive he has never been ahead of Adlet when it comes to strategy.</br>  So Adlet is a punk who is just smart but is way over his head. So lame. I guess he ain't even a Saint.  <br> It's as bad as saying that guns can kill servants from fate. <br>How so? Servants are the incarnations of the strongest heroes of mankind, easily capable of moving at supersonic speeds and slaughtering armies on their own. The fiends are just scrub monsters, so there's no reason why bombs, poisons and other stuff can't work on them.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why I am asked him this. She's the love interest.</br>  <br> They should find a way to get rid of the Maijin for good. <br>Thing respawns so good luck with that.</br></br>  <br>Only females can be Saint, retard. You should read the source material instead of posting shit relying on spoilers.</br>  <br> Only females can be Saints <br>That's so retarded.</br></br>  <br> fiends <br> just scrub monsters <br>Animefag just create a Fate thread and discuss about your Servant nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br>Hans doesn't have the information. He also said that he feared Adlet the most because he's in the leadership position, clearly stating his chief consideration is how much damage a betrayal would bring, and Adlet was the one guiding the group. Hans was the first one to suspect Mora as well.</br>  <br>I thought it was supposed to be 6th petals, what is this.</br>  <br>They pretty much are really. They are conventional firepower, relying mostly on numbers, and lacking in genuine hax that some servants are known for.</br>  <br>I think it got me to pay attention more than a Medieval European setting would.</br>  <br>6 chosen ones were promised. 7 showed up with the mark. Then another showed up after the first traitor was discovered and ran off. It's not exactly going according to plan.</br>  <br>You are brainwashed by shitty fantasy anime, there's nothing wrong with fiends being killed by normal means.<br><br>I think it's nice to see a more trickster, roguish MC. But I bet most people just want the usual overpowered magic swordsman.</br></br></br>  The more I read the LN the more I hate it.  <br> traitor <br>I bet it's the sketchy looking guy in the cover picture with the blue hair covering his eyes.</br></br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>   it's been 700 years since the first round of heroes  <br>So what the fuck have they been doing all this time that they still need heroes to deal with scrub fiends and the regular army won't do? It's been 700 years, in that time we went from our own Medieval period to fucking WW2.</br>  <br>Kyouma are bottom of the barrel trash most of the time outside of stuff like the bug queen that figman uses, the fig itself and the like.</br>  <br>All this drama about the  seventh  and shit up in a fantasy setting, when characters should be getting shit done.</br>  Fucking spoilers man, now my autism nerve exploded. I'm now angsty and want to see who the traitor is.<br><br>Also do the mark give them power ups or na?</br></br>  <br>Actually, that's really fast for a high fantasy setting. <br><br>Most fantasy campaign settings in pnp rpg, thousands of years pass and absolutely nothing happens.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's 2 traitors!</br>  <br>The majin corrupts everything around it, just being in the area would kill you, you need one of those crests just to get close to it, the average kyouma still needs a squad of people to take down and their tech level isn't all that high. The kyouma spawn endlessly so throwing bodies at them won't work either.</br>  <br>What about the loli? Is she a  cute? </br>  <br> just being in the area would kill you, you need one of those crests just to get close to it <br>over the horizon bombardment with cannons</br></br>  <br> when characters should be getting shit done. <br>That's not the point of the novel, never was, you want your generic heroic fantasy you can get it elsewhere.</br></br>  <br>Gunpowder is not widespread enough currently. Only people like Adlet and his master know how to make it/use it. The Saint of Gunpowder has only recently appeared in this point in time.</br>  <br>Hans has never been ahead of him in that department, he is not smarter, as long as they are in this department, Hans is n.2. What information?</br>  <br>A cute brat that grows up over time.<br><br>Won't do shit since leomon built the goddamned wall of china around the Majin, you'd have to drag those cannons through a monster and zombie infested forest where its impossible for people without crests to even survive. Not that the fig would let that kind of plan even get off the drawing board.</br></br></br>  <br>There are 7! what is this shit?</br>  Chamo and Hans are the traitors, and Chamo wants to kill the one with the eye patch.  What is the title of MC?  <br>That's because the heroes are the strongest warriors. You want them to job against underlings?</br>  <br>One of the traitor is a girl but it isn't Chamo.</br>  <br>So it's Sin?</br>  <br>Well, thanks for that. I liked the tackling the mystery of the seventh but when it drags out after the first volume and refuse to settle it and move the fuck on, yeah no.</br>  <br>Thanks for the spoiler faggot,<br>I guess that I can drop the show now.</br></br>  <br>It's a mindless mass that spawns monsters and then immediately eats them so far, at least when its not busy moaning and calling out the names of the current flower power team.</br>  <br>I thought the traitor was the blades princess, I don't remember thought haven't read this in a while.</br>   1 week of torture until next episode <br>FUCK, I just want to see Adlet x Fremy and Hans x Chamo, yeah Hans is a lolicon.</br>  <br>Everyone's a traitor.</br>  <br>He's trolling.</br>  <br> Your generic Heroic Fantasy <br> Acting like this LN is good litterature </br></br>  Setting started around 500 A.C and around 1200 A.C now, they only starting to develop firearms and cannons. Despite being fairly weak against normal Kyoma, Adlet have strongest anti-Majin weapon of entire group, it's probably their only hope to defeat Majin or strongest Kyoma general. Was kinda disappointed what saint of Mountains is only monk and can't do some fancy geomancy.  <br>Yeah, it's the blade princess. Didn't want to say it, but you spoiled everything for everyone lol.</br>  Main girl look so much better in this dress than her stupid rabbit outfit.  <br> Acting as if it was that simple <br>She is not the one they are looking for.</br></br>  <br> Implying she is main girl </br>  <br>Bro, I understand not wanting to spoil it, but you don't need to lie. It was the blades princess.<br><br>Please don't make me pull the novel.</br></br></br>  What I don't understand is why no one looked at her breasts when she wanted them to look  <br>Maybe he's talking about the  second traitor? <br><br>Yeah this seventh bullshit is tiring after a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on where you start counting from our Medieval period. You could count starting from the 5th century in which case 700 years later would put you in the 12th century, or from around the middle in the 10th-11th centuries in which case 700 years later would be the age of the British Empire and the Napoleonic wars, or you could start counting at the end, around the 15th century, which 700 years later would send you to the future.</br>  <br>Think a little, is the problem solved after the first volume? It's not, right?</br>  <br>This. Nashetania was just a bait.</br>  <br>Stones do poorly against saturation bombing with HE. Also, remember that nukes came ~40 years after flight, ~160 years after Watt patented his steam engine. Cruise missiles and space flight came soon after. They had 700 years.<br><br>Just accept it a flaw ans paper it over with your willing suspension of disbelief.</br></br></br>  <br>The mark only gives them divine blessing against miasma in the demon's territory which could kill any mere humans in a day.</br>  Nips are saying the mom solider is the one but they are all delusional like half this board. It fairly obvious that it's the spear princess and that she will die and MC and the half kyoma eye patch girl will end up together.<br><br>The sword princess and MC will finally have their 'fight' and she'll die for being a bitch.</br></br>  <br> spear princess <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Typo, I obviously meant sword.</br>  <br> tech progresses at the same rate throughout human history <br>There were 1000 years between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance.</br></br>  <br>The power to be salty<br><br>Is a good example</br></br></br>  Man this is why I hate watching mysteries right on release, I get pretty angsty throughout the week.<br><br>I'll wait until it's done to watch it, I guess I'll have to miss the shit posting during the climax episode.</br></br>  <br>Why is everyone calling rabbit a bitch?<br>She looks pretty chill from the first episode.</br></br>  <br>Tech doesn't, and there are strong periods of regression. The space in between was marked by barbarian incursion, fracturing of the old empire, wars, black death, and generally a lot of suffering and shit. I don't see it in the setting though. If they had the economic and social infrastructure as well as cultural background to produce the kind of royalty as described, then by all rights development should have been rapid.</br>  <br>Read the prologue to the 1st volume.</br>  <br>See, this is the issue. Any discussion would necessitate spoilers.</br>  <br>me on the left</br>  <br>I didn't know anything about this before starting watching. I cannot believe how good this first episode was, specially the direction and the score, plus really well animated, and the characters for the moment seem great.<br><br>I never jump to this AOTS, but if this continue this way is probably going to be the case.</br></br></br>  Sword princess is as bad as Malty, the princess that decided to join the Shield hero in Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari.<br>The difference is that they slowly show you everyone's true nature, so yeah.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS A LIE..<br>Fuck no, please no.</br></br>  <br>It's kind of obvious that something like that is going to happen when the state that always ONLY 6 heroes are choosen.</br>  <br>Quite fun.</br>  <br> Shame. she has the best design out of the girls. <br>Her outfit is the worst, why couldn't she just wear the thing she had on when she visited him in jail?</br></br>  <br>That's a shame.<br>I like her design and her character doesn't really look that bad in episode 1.</br></br>  <br>Dude are you even reading the thread.<br><br>There's supposed to be six fuckers but there's seven,  sword bunny  is the fake, after she fucked off a meganeko showed up and there's seven again, first the  MILF  is the fake but then she's not, now nobody knows jack shit and everybody suspects everybody and wants to kill everybody. This shit gets too tiring to elicit emotional impact after a while.</br></br></br>  The imposter is  already revealed in the OP of this thread   <br>She's a good character.</br>  <br>Which is as it should be. The characters have decided to move on, watching everyone but somehow accepting each other as part of the landscape while the uncertainty slow grates on them on a more subconscious level. Life goes on but shit's about to go down.</br>  Marvelous first episode with nice (looking) characters and decent premise. Sadly, being based on a LN, this means the threads will be shit, thanks to various anons spoiling the shit out of it, accompanied by discussions over minutiae between anons of varying knowledge of the source material. And it's probably another advertanime for the LN series, which is going to cover only a part of the story with a "buy the books lol" open end. Still A nice decent surprise and I'm glad for another actual fantasy tale, without any MMO/RPG setting shenanigans. Fuck, she looked lovely.  WHO CARES WHO THE FUCKING TRAITOR IS, WHY THE FUCK SHOULD THEY CARE? THEIR ONLY FUCKING NEED IS TOO KILL ALL THE DEMON, WHO CARES IF THERES AN EXTRA ONE? IF THERES AN EXTRA ONE GOOD, IT MEANS YOU GET MORE MAN POWER, THE FUCKING GOD WHO PUTS THE SEAL WOULDNT FUCKING PUT A MANIAC ON YOUR FUCKING TEAM<br><br>My god, now that my rage is all over I feel better now. This traitor premise is the worst kind of forced drama I've ever read in my entire life.</br></br>  <br>The LNs were pleasant surprise that set itself apart from most of the other nonsense around. I feel that its worth adapting seriously, and if they make enough, season 2 is still possible. After all, it's not like Bakemonogatari only got 1 season.</br>  <br> letting someone backstab you <br> letting someone undermine everything you do <br> not being able to trust anyone </br></br></br>  <br>I thought that at first too but the first traitor  traps the group on a mountain so they can't proceed with the quest. <br><br>The  second traitor though, why they give a fuck about that is beyond me. </br></br></br>  <br>A traitor could easily get them killed. Even losing 2/6 would make the task all but impossible. Also, Flower fucked up, so you are wrong on both accounts.</br>  <br>SPOILER LIST:<br>There is more than 1 traitor<br>There are 8 people with the seal<br>They will be stuck in the middle of some random fog which they can't leave<br>The traitor(s) are all girls<br>One of the above spoilers is a lie but everything else is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  MC is literally Luke.  LN fags once again ruined everything  <br><br> coming to threads in a mystery anime based on a LN where everything has already been revealed <br> not expecting to get spoiled <br>are you new to /a/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can just not read the thread. It's the nature of this particular series that any discussion at all involves spoilers.</br>  <br>Now there's 8 seals, nice b8 m8.</br>  <br>There are. Another person shows up after the first fake leaves.</br>  <br>Just tell me how they are fake, do they paint their crest, eh? (it's fucking impossible, they would die if they were fake)<br><br>This shit makes no sense.</br></br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags think he's lying <br>ayy lmao, theres more than one volume</br></br>  <br>The provenance of the seals are explained. Also at least one of the fakes is working for the other side so immunity to the poison is not out of the question. Please try thinking of an answer yourself instead of raging pointlessly.</br>  Man, this guy made it obvious. Whoever think Chamo and Hans are traitors is the wrong post.<br><br>The guy who compared this to Shield Hero is on the money.</br></br>  <br>Because the 7th is helping for the Kyoma retard. He will try to kill the genuine Flowers at the right occasion.<br><br><br>Looks like someone posting dumb things to get spoilers, it's better not to answer him. You are playing his game.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thought Chamo and Hans were traitors is wrong. <br><br>Fucked up my post, fixed typo.</br></br></br>  Really guys, even you wanna spoiler, at least use spoiler tag  <br>Can someone explain the melty comparison?<br>I gave up on shieldbro after it started to meander aimlessly but is  melty really a evil bitch? I mean there seems to have been no hints to this. At least rokka gave some subtle hints that it was the bunny grill </br></br>   mystery anime <br> get taunted by soft spoilers by the lnfags <br> thread turned into a mystery itself <br> everyone trying to figure out who's the traitor now <br><br>A mystery anime has turned this thread into a mystery itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck did I say melty? FUCK.<br>I meant the other one that's always with the spearman, my bad bro sorry.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that sort of the point though? That said, there's very little to go on in EP 1, and not even all the main characters are introduced, so the material has to come from the LNs.</br>  <br>all good, scared me for a second <br><br>literally stop visiting these threads unless you want to be spoiled every second such as for example  dumbledore dies :^) </br></br></br>  <br>GODDAMNIT<br>That's almost as bad as  the Titanic sinks </br></br>   watched episode 1 <br> didn't even know that this is a mystery anime <br> wait how come there are 7 heroes in the OP <br> go into thread <br> Spoilers fucking everywhere <br><br>Fuck this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since this isn't a Shieldbro thread I'll outright spoil you fully since the whole thing has been translated for a bit now.<br><br>Malty is a conniving bitch who seeks to undermine the success of the heroes.<br><br>Not because she is a bitch, but because she is a fragment of an evil Goddess who seeks to collide worlds to the point she can suck out all their life and magic.<br><br>Malty is killed, but the Malty of the other world colliding with the one Naofumi is in succeeded.<br><br>Naofumi realized that Malty's whole angle was strange since it seemed she was purposely mucking up heroes just to muck them up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoilers are fun. <br><br>I'll give you three fake spoilers and 3 real ones.<br><br>Adlet, the MC, is a fake hero.<br>Chamo, the loli, is evil.<br>Nora, the milf, betrays them.<br>Hans, the assassin, is a total bro.<br>Goldof, the guy I can't really think of a nickname for, is a total bro.<br>Fremy, the gun girl, is the killer.<br>Nashetania, the bunny, isn't the traitor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are we RPing as the fig now?</br>  What's the MC's special power? Is he batman?  <br>Basically.</br>  <br>Real spoiler: <br>Hans is a bro.<br>Goldof a bro.<br>Fremy is the killer (if by killer you mean the one who killed Chamo's parents)<br><br>Shitty spoilers anon.<br><br>And the shield bro and bunny girl comparison is just genius, I was thinking the same thing but couldn't choose a manga to compare it with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I felt something was off with bunny after the scene when she's in the balcony, it just felt something was wrong with her. That and her clearly sketchy behavior.  <br>Malty is a bitch? WHAT THE FUCK. Is like the entire royal family rotten? It's like they don't deserve to be saved by the heroes.<br><br>And there are two maltys? Man that fucking sucks, parrallel universe is a shit way to add more plot.</br></br></br>  Is this what Tales should have done?  So, what's the deal with the ears. Real or a decoration?  so there was this in the shueisha website.<br>http://dash.shueisha.co.jp/rokka/<br><br>Can someone translate?</br></br></br>  <br>Wait wait wait<br>you mean the loli is evil?<br>what the actual fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Decoration.</br>  <br><br>Malty is the red head bitch who gets renamed to witch.<br><br>Melty is the loli.<br><br>At least remember who is who.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damm I wish they were real so I could pull on them while fucking her from behind.</br>   Best girl is voiced by best seiyuu <br>Good, good.</br>  Any sexual content happened in the LN?  Is white the only one with feelings towards MC?  <br>No. Too busy not dying.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her silly accessories reminded me ot Drakengard. Perhaps that's why I'm kinda expecting the same level of mindfuckery from the series</br>  <br> WHY THE FUCK SHOULD THEY CARE? <br>What if the traitor is working for the demon god? What if the traitor is trying to kill you? These are 2 very valid reason to give a fuck anon.</br></br>  <br>This is why anime original shows get the best discussions on /a/, those or one where the source material is untranslated and no one knows about it.</br>  <br>I thought it was incan.</br>  Just checking out the LN<br> that closed room in barrier incident <br>Never thought this would turn into Umineko tier mystery</br></br>  So, as I can see in this thread, the LN seems to be good?  <br>It's pretty good. It's self-consistent and feels different from most of the other fare out there.</br>  <br>Very good.</br>  Should I read the LN or wait for the anime and get myself spoiled by anon?<br><br>I already knew the identity of the traitor.</br></br>  <br><br>Going to read it tonight then, thanks.</br></br>  <br>That is about heroes going off to defeat a demon lord and the genre is mystery should tell you that it isn't the average LN.</br>  <br>  I already knew the identity of the traitor. <br>heh</br></br>  <br>It's better to read it.<br> I already knew the identity of the traitor. <br>You don't.</br></br></br>  <br> i already know the identity  <br>Keep lying to yourself.</br></br>  <br> Those hips </br>  WHO IS THE TRAITOR?<br> mystery anime should be realized twice a week, waiting a week per mystery episode is fucking hell </br>  <br> &gt;generic oriental epic music à la Disney Alladin <br>are you talking shit about Michiru Oshima?</br></br>  Hope you guys are ready for this to get really fucking slow.  <br>damn remy<br>stop being so sexy</br></br>  <br>It's 12 episode, it's not going to be as slow as the novel, and they are going to solve the mystery and kill the demon lord all in 12 episodes.</br>  <br> Anime original ending. <br>Pls no.</br></br>  <br>We're barely through 1/4 of the 1st novel right now and the director likes to take it slow.</br>  Does anyone have an epub/awz version of the LN  in japanese ?  Really fun episode, enjoyable MC, nice fight, cool designs for the setting.<br>The only thing that I didn't like was the stupid outfit princess has now.</br>  <br>When she's going to appear?<br>so cute.</br></br>  <br>That's some traditional outfit, therefore the bunny ears. I'm not particularly disliking it.</br>  <br> That's some traditional outfit <br>Author can come up with an excuse for anything he wants, this doesn't change anything.<br><br>It's all a matter of taste in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl on the left. You'll see.</br>  This is like reading Shield bro all over again. Every girl I like seems to be a bitch afterwards.  <br> liking perfect and boring characters </br>  <br>How the fuck you put the best girl alongside the biggest whore of the LN.</br>  Why aren't they wearing comfy pajamas when they go off to war?  <br>Calm your autism</br>  <br>Ask the author and illustrator.</br>  <br>Those are some cool looking weapons.</br>  Well it's so obvious bunny is a two-faced bitch anons. Just give it two more episodes, you'll notice she acts different depending with who she's with. She goes from manipulative bitch to waifu cute tier depending on the person she's with.<br><br>This is going to be gold, I wish they made shield bro an anime as well so I can just see the threads here.</br></br>  <br> yfw best boy have feelings for that slut <br> yfw she's just using bolof's feelings for protection <br><br>suffering at its finest, haven't read far so i don't know if he notices/does something about it</br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw best boy have feelings for that slut <br><br>No that's not going to happen, the best team is MC + snipergirl</br></br></br>  <br> you'll notice she acts different depending with who she's with. <br>That's retarded. Everyone is like that, you can say that it's obvious because you read it already but back then it was not certain.</br></br>  <br>It's interesting that instead of swords they used bats with sharpened rocks. Supposedly one warrior actually decapitated a Spaniards horse with one.</br>  <br>I can't remember which one, but an early South American civilization had the four earthly pleasures pinned as good food, good alcohol, good sex, and salt. I imagine the Salt Saint would be kind of like a Bacchus/Dionysus sort of dude.</br>  <br>best boy is goldof though</br>  <br>Just letting you now that when he finds out he's gonna go on a rampage since she's the only who can calm him down. <br><br>I feel bad for the anon that said that she's going to marry MC, lol. She's a pretty rotten, I feel bad for MC though, he trusts others too easily.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a heaven to Earth difference bro. It's not like someone who acts different just because it's royalty, but she acts all nice and shit with MC but with other people she uses them as pawns for her plans and gets pissed if nothing goes as she planned.</br>  <br>Salt is used as a purifier here.</br>  <br>Nope, is cat-san.</br>  <br>Ah, the old trick of throwing salt on demons to chase them away. Japan is fond of that one.</br>  <br> they used bats with sharpened rocks. <br> Supposedly one warrior actually decapitated a Spaniards horse with one. <br>I thought they were just blades, now they're even neater.</br></br></br>  shit guys why you do this to me, and i thought the sword princess was a pure maiden  <br>She was the same thorughout the whole volume though it was hinted that she was interested in Adlet, she was closer to Goldof. She even thrown her blades at Adlet "for fun". Nothing was obvious, Chamo was a bitch to everyone but Mora, Fremy was afraid of Chamo, hated the others and became deredere for Adlet near the end, they are people.</br>  <br>She's a slut who loves dogs dicks</br>  <br>Nope, it's Tgurneu.</br>  First episode was alright. MC sure can be annoying with his I am the strongest in the world.  How many volumes are there supposed to be in total?  <br><br>Hans, Tgurneu and Adlet are all best boys.</br></br>   hooga booga   <br>Considering the months he stayed in there, he must've reeked by the time Nashetania came to pick him up.<br><br>And I wonder where he peed and pooped in his prison cell. He seemed to have a dedicated grave corner for the previous occupant.</br></br></br>  <br>He wouldn't stop any sooner. It's literally a third of all his lines.</br>  So I've been seeing a lot of shit happens with fremy in vol.5, anyone mind spoiling as to what?  <br>What, I didn't ever notice any hints of her liking him, and depending on who translated your novel, the thrown blades thing can be interpreted as something that was a mistake or something that was clearly intentional. <br><br>I know japanese so I don't knwo what to tell you, but the author made it obvious she had two faces in the earlier volumes. (imo)</br></br></br>  <br>where did you find volume 4 fully translated?<br>pls tell me anon ;_:</br></br>  <br>The series is generally well-accepted in Japan and I enjoyed it so far. <br><br>Boss characters on demons' side are fantastic.</br></br></br>   "strongest man in the world" <br> interrupts a 1v1 duel of honor with no bullshit gimmicks allowed <br> uses an arsenal of tricks and bombs <br><br>That's not how you become "strongest man in the world" of fucking course you would win with the amount of bullshit he pulled over.<br><br>On a true 1v1 he would get rekt, i cannot believe you guys can bear this fucking obnoxious faggot of a MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Two face yes, but she has always been like that. She had always a somewhat creepy side. None of the heroes are knight in shining armors anyway.</br>  <br>1v1 fite me fagit doesn't work in this setting, honor is for chumps.</br>  <br>Just because I say Im your dad, I could become your dad. Same, he knows well he is not the strongest but he can say whatever he wants.<br><br>Also, what is the "true" fight? Fist fight? I would rather have my guns and tricks to fight demons and staying alive rather than muh honor.</br></br></br>  Does the MILF ever apologize for stabbing Hans in the back?  <br>kek no. That's how he fights, with his secret weapons, he won fair and square with his fighting style, you think he easily dodged their attacks because of tricks too?</br>  <br>The World's Strongest has his own brand of logic.</br>  I know Hans like Chamo, but Chamo is like a fucking kid. How old is Hans, I don't recall reading his age in the novel.  <br>As long as he keeps winning fights, I don't see how his statement is necessarily untrue.</br>   0 posts about this novel in /a/ before <br> anime spanws <br> suddenly an influx on people read this <br><br>Hey guys, when did you started reading this, two weeks ago?</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh honor <br>They were two plus a bunch of soldiers he beat them all, not everyone can use weapons like that. He trained for years with a legendary master to reach that level, the heroes chosen are the best in the world.</br></br>  <br>It's been brought up in LN threads every now and then.</br>  <br> obnoxious faggot of a MC. <br>He's miles better than the trash we get from other LNs.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> fair and square <br>The two warriors bringed at most a sword and a shield, MC fag brings bombs, poisoned needles and gasoline and piss jugs sure is fair m8.<br><br>And what happens if he is out of tricks? He gets rekt because he himself is worth nothing withouth them.<br><br>Just saying it's the most gay way of fighting and he's a piece of worthless cocky shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the novel, his teammates consider him the shittiest.</br>  <br>Trained with master of gayness epic<br><br><br>What is it like to be 12? Still liking cocky underages faggots</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that Chamo is 14 and Hans is over 20.</br>  <br>KEK.<br> The two warriors bringed at most a sword and a shield <br><br>And the winner one got rekted by princess's magic, so much for fair and square.<br><br>  he himself is worth nothing withouth them. <br><br>He studies about demon, weak points, behaviours...., he is a specialist about demon, would take him over any warrior with shield and sword.<br><br>  gay way of fighting <br><br>Yeah, its not like he need to fight human anyway. His goal is demon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rabbit-hime is the fake, isn't she? </br>  <br>Read the fucking thread, faggot.</br>  <br>Thats quite a weak bait, try harder pls.</br>  <br> He gets rekt because he himself is worth nothing withouth them. <br>He has good physical abilities, everyone has his fighting style. Do you think these two would have beaten him with the same weapons? Not a chance.They are not normal fags, they are warriors. Adlet trianed to fight with multiple weapons, bombs, swordsmanship, darts etc he studied Kyoma, science, trained his body, you need to be very strong just to carry all these weapons and he does it effortlessly. What happens if the others are without their weapons? It's basically the same.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you also get pissed at Captain Basch fon Ronsenburg of Dalmasca?</br>  <br>Like her as in romantic? These two get along very well but Hans is a pervert who likes women in general, maybe they'd be a couple if she was two years older.</br>  <br>Damn you, I was watching a bunch of FF12 videos ealier today, hoping for the damn remake HD soon.</br>   Spitting fire from his mouth. <br>I know this was done in another manga, anyone remember? Some guy had a giant tank of fuel in his stomach and his teeth were flint.</br>  <br>That one dude from Rurouni Kenshin?</br>  <br>Oh shit, you're right. Thanks.</br>  <br> hoping for the damn remake HD soon. <br>I'm cautious about it. They might change a bunch of things like they did in FFX. I'm still hoping for it to happen some day, on the off-chance that it will make people remember Hiroyuki Ito and Yasumi Masuno.</br></br>  <br><br>god, /a/'s autism is amazing. <br><br>hurr durr mc didnt win 1v1 with nothing but physical prowess, therefore, he didnt really win<br><br>listen, winning a fight is winning a fight. guile and ruthlessness are as much a part of fighting as physical skill and conditioning. <br><br>anyone who says otherwise is a basement dweller who plays too many vidya games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do not believe Ondore's lies.</br>  <br>Useless bunny, only good for sex appeal.</br>  <br>He's only set on saying he's the strongest in the world because he's the strongest in the world. If you were strongest in the world it's not like you could deny being the strongest in the world if someone asked if you were the strongest in the world, or even if no one asked if you were the strongest in the world it wouldn't hurt to mention that you're the strongest in the world a couple times just so people don't forget that you're the strongest in the world.</br>  <br>Why did you quoted me again? <br><br><br> They are too busy with FF7R, KH3 and FF15 so I dont think gonna remake it anytime soon, but they will, someday anon. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like saying:<br> 2 guys  <br> 1 tells the other to fist fight to prove who is stronger <br> other guy accepts <br> they fight but the other guy had a gun hidden under his clothes and shoots him dead <br><br>You're basically saying it's ok he brought a gun to a fist fight just because he won, sir autismo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, unless he loses in a fight I'm not seeing how his claim is invalidated</br>  <br>if they didnt specify fists only, then yes, that would be acceptable. you're under the impression there are arbitrary rules imposed when there are not. the only way a win would be invalid is if it were in a competitive, tournament setting with specific rules set up before hand, which we see no evidence of. <br><br>plus your strawman argument is just silly, because if guns existed and two people were to fight to the death, whoever didnt bring a gun would be an idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no fucking rules in the first place, they can use their weapons of choice, rabbit uses the damn blade saint magic to fight with the winner.<br><br>They didnt question his weapons he used either, they are just piss because he broke the ceremony in front of king and godness status.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's not like that. <br>It was not a fist fight, they all had their weapons, you are not worthy of being a hero of the six flowers if a simple gun is enough to beat you. Fremy at least is the Saint of Gunpowder and she's one of the weakest hero, but she's still top tiers. <br>They were two against him, he had not any advantages. You are upset because he doesn't use conventional weapons.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn shirou looks good with long hair</br>   first episode <br> first big fight <br> better than everything in the entirety of UBW <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually, he wanted to participate officially because the organizers didn't like his fighting style. With no rules he's clearly the strongest and he proved that by beating them.</br></br>  MC in a nutshell:<br> i spent all my life training for this and learn DEMON SLAYING skills <br> his DEMON SLAYING skills only consists on playing dirty and using traps <br><br>What a shitty master, let's see you kill Satan with fucking toxic spikes on the floor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's see you kill Satan by walking up to him with a sword and shield and challenging him.</br>  <br> OH GEE ANON, YOU MUST FIGHT DEMON WITH HONORS, THERE IS NO POINT SAVING HUMAN IF YOU DONT FIGHT WITH HONORS. </br>  <br> big fight <br>No it wasn't one. It was rather long in the anime even, he beat them in 10 seconds in the LN, the big fights are against other heroes or strong Kyoumas.</br></br>  <br>You've never killed a demon before, have you? Yes, you do need every one of those flasks of oil (even if it's immune to fire), caltrops, and trained attack dogs which are conveniently 25 GP each.</br>  <br> Only demon slaying skills <br>And yet he won against two humans? They were not even able to touch him. His fighting style is not only limited to Kyoma retard.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's not strong or anything, he only traps. What if a demon overpowers his traps? Guess what, he's dead.</br>  <br>Why would he fight a demon that can overpower his traps?</br>  <br> implying the demon can't spawn randomly or sense his presence and hunt him down </br>  This thread is just like trying to prove to /co/ that Batman is a shitty hero. Fucking fucktards won't buldge no matter what.  <br> Only traps <br>That's not the case.</br></br>  If it can bleed, that means it can be poisoned.<br><br>And if it can be poisoned, that means it can be fucking poisoned.<br><br>You fags should realize poison is pretty damn universal in killing and the only real protection is larger body mass and more blood to thin out the effect of the poison.<br><br>Also, there are a shitton of ways particular poisons can kill. Anticoagulants that make it so your blood veins rupture irreparably at a moment's notice. Neurotoxins that cause your nervous system to fail and probably spasm horribly until death. Acids that when ingested soak into your bones and dissolve them specifically.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>X fights with Y.Y is overpowered by Z, he loses.<br><br>Conclusion: You are retarded. Would Chamo be as strong without her Jyuma? Hans without his weapons? The Saints without their powers? Don't you get that everyone fights differently?</br></br></br>  Can't wait for my autistic husbando.  <br>Yeah,it's nice to get something other than Kriro clone every once in a while.</br>  <br>Adlet would just pull out his nail of the saints and one shot Satan with that anti-demon weapon of his. Also he doesn't pack traps but rather poison, explosives and gadgets like how his sword can fire out it's blade and he has a chain with a nail for restraining Kyoumas</br>  <br>Did you not watch the opening?</br>  <br>Shes got some farsight shit going for her too and also voice manipulation but yea, shes basically a white monk</br>  If he's only strong point is setting traps, can a novel-fag tell me how can fare vs. Tgurneu, which has the same qualities as him?  <br>Nah, shes basically middle of the road when it comes to best girl. At least she aint Nashtania<br><br><br>If it makes it to the third volume, you're in for a laugh</br></br></br></br>  I don't see Rolonia listed in the list of characters, don't tell me she's not getting adapted.  <br>she's not even in the character designs lel</br>  <br>Cast seems interesting, but I don't really care for the plot and setting so far and that exposition dump in the first ep bored me to fucking tears. Of the stuff I'm watching, this and Classroom Crisis seem the most likely for me to drop</br>  <br> If he's only strong point is setting traps <br>He is not, he fights wit his gadgets and needs good physical abilities and guile to accomplish all that. None of the heroes can beat Tgurneu 1vs1They fight him in volume 2 and fail, but Adlet as a special nail who can one shot Kyoma of his caliber, they failed because they didn't know the truth about his body.</br></br>  <br>She's a spoiler, they will put her in once they get pass the fog barrier</br>  <br>Anyone with common sense would understand why she's not there.</br>  <br>There's no 1v1 battles here anon, it's all team fights. That's why there are 6 chosen heroes</br>  <br>There are some 1vs1 battles.</br>  Spoiler: Hans dies, and then they revive him.  <br>Winning against figman 1v1 is impossible, worst part is the fucker is clever too.</br>  18+ Only Heroine Midnight at the lewdest she's ever been!  <br>But she is. All she's done so far is be a titty monster and the typical fanservice girl.</br>  <br>That's all she needs to be, she's part of the comedy trio between her, grapes, and zap boy.</br>  <br> that's all she needs to be <br>Which is why she's worst girl. Nearly every other girl has had funny moments too and still have a bit more to their character.</br></br>  <br>I wasn't the person arguing against you. I just wanted to point out she's fine as she is right now.<br><br>But if I would, I'd argue Kendou is just as lame, all she has going for is a better face and having best hair. Her personality is barely different than Momo, and her body isn't anything noteworthy either. To top it off, her costume clashes hard and looks like the shit the people in the audience wear.</br></br></br>  <br>It's cute to see her interactions with Kaminari, that's why she's not worst girl.</br>  Is it a fact that the strongest Nasu protagonist is Shirou Emiya? He becomes a  servant  later in life and even takes down a Servant on his own.  <br>He doesn't get them from UBW, the swords he traces appear in UBW though. <br><br>He doesn't need to access his reality marble to project a sword.</br></br></br>  <br>Prisma Ilya shows Bazett can at least neutralize Gate of Babylon using Fragarach. Whether that's just blowing through with Gouging Dagger of the War God or if it was a full activation is hard to tell because Gil in that condition could survive his 'heart' getting ripped out, but it would definitely throw a wrench in the works. In fact, you can debate how much weaker the card-generated servants are in it, but she took out that version of Archer easily.</br>  <br>Carnival Phantasm is pure fan service and has no story at all.
