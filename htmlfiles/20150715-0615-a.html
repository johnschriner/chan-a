Threads usually were more common when new chapters would come out and after tlfag would do live translations and then the threads would calm down for a while. But once the anime was announced there started being one almost continuously.<br><br>Also cause you're an annoying fuck I cant help but tell you to go fuck yourself and die, I've been following crabman since he first made the monstergirl fanart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the shape they make.<br><br>They resemble Snake eyes if she was a giant snake.

People just discuss things, get some Omake, fanart, and other things coming from Crabman and FwPA. <br><br>Now fuck off you retard, shitposters animeonlyfags like you are not welcome in these threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So normies like you have something to ogle.</br>  <br><br>They literally can wait a few months for BDs instead of going RIGHT NOW and reading the manga.</br></br>   land animal <br>Ostrich?</br>  <br>JRHNBR<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=17r<wbr>ZTpoXVzw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> She'll never shove those appendages down your throat or bum </br>  <br>Yes anon, like an ostrich.</br>  <br>is this the beginning of an epic new meme?</br>   There are people on /a/ who still haven't watched this masterpiece   Just seems like edgy shit to me.  <br>And I never will, either.</br>   dat ending <br> masterpiece </br>  I'm glad that Megumi made it to the city in the end, she deserved her happy ending.  Shikis did nothing wrong.  <br> being a communist </br>  <br> 1st episode <br> those god awful character designs <br> That generic tsundere bitch that the episode focuses on <br> Shes killed off and it expects me to care <br> Masterpiece <br>Nah m8</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun show, nice music and art design. Probably one of the few anime that does horror pretty decent, as it is really difficult to pull off.</br>  I need to rewatch it, it was really good indeed.   I will never watch Shiki for the first time again   <br>its not a masterpiece<br>i watched it a while back 6/10 imo</br></br>  Started out good but I wanted to drown myself after that shitty ending<br> faggot monk takes stupid loli to city and that's it <br> yuuki nukes himself <br> everyone dies <br> the doctor escapes in a truck </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck fuck fuck fuck I wanted that shitty werewolf to suffer so much, and he gets blown up offscreen with the main character while acting smug<br><br>Fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you know what tsundere means.</br>  I never really got it. Wasn't the MC some 2edgy4u faggot who the tsundere bitch loved and ended up becoming a super werewolf or some shit?  Capitalist pigs got what they deserved, too bad some of them escaped though.  <br>He was an edgy people hater who hated the countryside and only understood the value of relationships AFTER his fucking friend got killed<br><br>He went kamikaze because he's a fucking loser</br></br></br>  <br>Not much anime out there as good at storytelling as Shiki.</br>    Nice bait, almost thought for a second that someone actually liked this ugly piece of shit, with shit characters, shit plot, and shit everything  <br> It's shit. <br>FTFY<br>If you don't have anything worthwhile to say at least make it short.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't be proud to have shit taste</br>  I fucking hated the main character.<br>And I wasn't really feeling the second part, except for the two one off side stories.<br>And the ending felt super lack-luster.<br><br>But otherwise I really loved the first part's mystery and development.<br>And the doctor and priest interacting was great.<br>And it had some great horror elements in certain places<br><br><br>Yes, but the MC is easy enough to ignore, you can just treat the doctor as the main character, he practically is a lot of the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bad ending <br> bad <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, it was a prime example of how to fuck up a bittersweet ending. I haven't checked but if the manga also ends in that point then it's definitely one of the shittiest open anime endings in history.</br>   all these people with shit taste ITT claiming that Shiki is not great <br> check the calendar <br>It's summer all right.  This summer has already lasted a few years, when is it going to end? </br></br>  More TLRD spoilers.<br>http://toloverulove.blog121.fc2.com<wbr>/blog-entry-3343.html</wbr></br>  <br>ah, nice, the new spin-off magazine<br>Busy month for yabuki.</br></br>  <br>mikan sucking on a dick as usual</br>  <br> That zoom in on the nipple <br><br>Nips have their priorities straight.</br></br></br>  <br> spoilers  <br> for an ecchi <br>That would imply there's a plot</br></br></br>  By the amount of spoilers, this special is just some pages, right?<br>Not a full chapter.</br>    Sketch booklet? Do want<br><br>4 pages</br></br>  <br> Sucking dick this early in the day <br>Is it Thursday already /a/non-kun?</br></br>    Am I the only one who doesn't like Mikan? Shes just really gross to me, no idea why.  <br>Fuck your shit taste.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon. You'd look really gross to her as well.</br>  <br>Nah, I don't really get her role in the story besides to cockblock rito in that household. I mean I don't hate her and i'm turned on by her. But her presence is a hindrance to all Momo could be doing to Rito's dick and body as a whole.</br>  Needs more Yui? It always needs more Yui.  <br>This is literally happen with me and my imoutos well expect i scold her after to not wearing lewds outfit</br>  Threadly reminder if you don't have Mea (Nemesis Fused) as your waifu. You're a shit tasting loser.<br><br>The Smell Fetish, kinky, sexually-charged lick lusting Mea along with Nemesis's femdom, and "training"/teasing sex techniques. <br><br>Along with body shapeshifting to make breast bigger or any part of her body and phyco-dive!<br><br>Oh god, 10/10 Make you cum till you're senseless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats the lewdest sentence i've heard all day! Yeah, so I haven't been on here for long.</br>  <br>I prefer pure Mea, no scheming behind the scenes. simply a bold and honest slutty girl.</br>  momo is probably the worst girl of them all. She's a beta slut and I didn't know that was possible  <br> peeking at imoutits </br>  <br>If you don't like momo then you have shit taste and aren't worthy of any of the girls.</br>  <br>So, what I gather from the spoiler pics, Mikan keeps her guard up in school, so there's not even an accidental panty peek, but when at home, she doesn't mind if Rito gets to see all her stuff?</br>  http://<span>youtu.be/MELWk4oMT5k  [ ]  <br>One is supposed to feel relaxed at home, so its not like it doesn't make sense that she drops her guard.  Unless she is showing him intentionally. </br>  So I'm a bit behind but anyone want to finish the Lucky Star stream from last week tonight?  If it can get organized.  The MCs from the last two anime you discussed have just fused to take on a common enemy What is the fusion's name and what is the fusion's power?  Fusions are not real.  <br> Yamada-kun and Rinne <br><br>His name is Yimade-kun. He has the power to copy powers but he somehow ends up poor because of his playboy father.<br><br>He also gets to switch bodies with the girl with twin pigtails who's like, whatever about it.<br><br>I did my best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Goku <br> Luffy <br><br>Oh, shit, nigga. Guffy in da hawse, yo.</br></br></br>   Jerry Seinfeld and Duckman <br>So it's essentially the same series with a more sardonic feel and Jerry lives his days as a failed comedian.</br>     Hibiki <br> Nanoha <br>Dear God</br></br>   Goku <br> Lain <br><br>I can't think a good name but a god two times sounds pretty powerful.</br></br></br>  <br>Gains, anon.

Chinasue did nothing wrong  <br>Akari begs to differ.<br> pic related </br></br>  H-horror...?   People unironically hate China   <br>She's better when it's just her and Akari. When Yui's around she becomes too much of a one-note character for me.</br>  <br>she has to make up for yui being boring</br>    Which yuru would you worship?<br><br> What kind of offerings would you make anon? </br></br>  <br>I wonder why they don't joke about Yui being boring, similar to Akari's lack of presence.</br>  <br>In nipland, tsukkomi is the funniest shit in the show to them.</br>  <br>Plebs don't know that you can have boke without tsukkomi.</br>  <br>This. Yui on her own isn't much, but RamRaisan wouldn't be shit without her there to balance the team.</br>  <br>These two.<br><br> More semen than you know what to do with. </br></br></br>  I want to hug Yui!  <br>Excellent taste.</br>  pls post akari laughing at donuts    <br>Only the best for the very best.</br>  <br><br>How did you get such fucking  excellent  taste?</br></br>  <br><br>Is she really laughing at the donuts or just happy she has donuts to share?</br></br>  Time skip when?  <br>Chitose, goddess of yuri.</br>  <br>Hopefully never. <br><br><br>Reminder that Chitose only goes to not-comiket to buy masturbation material for her fantasies</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is that any different from why anyone else goes to comiket?</br>  <br>W-well Yui only goes because she's dragged by Kyouko and Ayano only went because Kyouko invited her</br>  <br>Ayano will use the experience to masturbate, and Chitose will use the fact that Ayano masturbates to it to masturbate.</br>  <br>Pls stop. The yurus are pure and don't even poop. Except for Chinatsu.</br>  <br> she hasn't read secret flowers </br>  <br><br>In other news: Hitler wasn't responsible for millions of deaths, Stalin never starved his own people, and Saddam Hussein didn't institute mass genocide against multiple ethnicities.<br><br>N-Never.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, really? Then why does Akari go "トイレ、トイレ" so much?</br>  <br>Akari pees syrup.</br>  <br>Because she goes to the toilet to masturbate, not to poop.</br>  <br>Yeah well if I had 2 yurus fucking in front of me I'd probably do the same</br>  This is such a vital topic, you guys.  <br>She might not poop, but it's still impure.</br>  <br>Good goy.</br>  <br>She's still a virgin, so she must be pure. Like us.</br>  <br>She bullied Pixiv. I'd call that wrong on some level.</br>  <br><br> not re-naming this GIF "Kyoukek.gif" <br><br>T-Thanks for replying anyway, Anon-chan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i want to hug hagu-chan!</br>  <br>Welcome back!<br><br> Just woke up, sorry for the wait. </br></br></br>  Goodnight anons.  <br> Chinasue did nothing right <br><br>Fixed for you</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good night, Anon. Remember not to give in to the evil oppai, even if they're soft and fun to play with.</br></br>  <br>oppai did nothing wrong<br>do not believe sakurako's lies</br></br>  what would you do if you saw this  <br>turn the fan on</br>  <br><br>Install anti-Chinatsu security measures, thus protecting Yui's innocence.</br></br>  <br>Slut.<br><br>Too bad I don't have the picture right now.</br></br></br>  <br> anti-Chinatsu security measures <br>please elaborate</br></br>  <br>She's not much more Yui obsesse dthan Kyouko Chinatsu obsessed in some scenes.</br>  <br><br>1. Tell Chinatsu that Yui has gone home early because she isn't feeling well.<br>2. Convince her to join the Cooking Club or the Art Club.<br><br>If case she still goes to the Club....<br>3. Change the locks to the Club's doors and only give keys to Yui, Akari and Kyouko. <br>4. "Accidentally" spill my drink on the crotch area of her school uniform, making it appear as though she has peed herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't we fix Chinatsu instead of removing her? She is evil, sure, but she could be a valuable asset if under our control.</br>  <br>Sadly for you, she is no evil. She's just curious.</br>  Chinatsu is love and Akari loves her.  <br>The concepts of good and evil are relative anyway. But these words make the discussion easier.</br>    <br><br>"You should believe everything you read on the internet." - Albert Einstein</br></br>  <br> Being a MC was a mistake </br>  <br>S3 nevah ;_;</br>  <br><br>Baby's first internet meme.</br></br>  <br>Stop this meme.</br>     page 9     Chinatsu is a Satan   you will never find love like these two have   <br> you will never find love </br>   your reaction faces will never be as smug as Lord Sakurako's faces     <br/>      Akari and China never really interact that much.  <br>Despite how shit the world turned out to be when the light illuminated the dark corners of the earth, I never gave up on love.

You might as well say Deadwood and The Shield are anything but shit. <br>The Wire and Mad Men were closest television came to artistry.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you think this badly animated episodic show, is the best anime you are fucking retarded.</br></br>  <br>The Wire is trash compared to Sopranos. It could never be considered more artistic or subtle.</br>  <br>Everyone's posting their 10/10s, but to me Mellowlink is worth watching, and really captures the what an OVA should be, fun to watch, well done, and wrapped up by the end of it.</br>  <br>  I doubt <br>If you weren't such a fucking newfag you wouldn't be making dumbfuck assumptions. Go onto any weg thread, 3x3 thread or any other bullshit thread and you'll see it mentioned once or twice. Tex is fucking well known here we just don't really fucking talk about it because it was fucking depressing as fuck. Also because its old as shit</br></br>  <br> Sopranos <br> artistic <br> subtle <br>Sopranos is General Hospital for men.

Darker Than Black  <br>"underrated" not "mediocre Japanese capeshit"</br>  <br>Sopranos is a subtle satire of millennium-era capitalism. It explores the contemporary American zeitgeist while providing an insightful modernist character study set against the existentialist climate.

"servicing" men in cosplay cafe, being filthy lesbian emotionaly scarring her female friends with her sexual harrassment and probably after school will become fat slob stuck in her house while her father still willing to feed her. Watches KyoAni shit and voiced by slut. Pirates stuff on internet. Likes Pepsi.<br><br>Umaru is perfect lady with bright future. Unlike Konata, absolutely pure and not corrupted.
