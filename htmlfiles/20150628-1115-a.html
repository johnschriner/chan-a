[  wake up <br> check /a/ <br> still no news about Hunter x Hunter <br>send help</br></br></br>  Next time I see HxH news on /a/ I'll probably have a heart attack from shock. I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful.   last update: september 2014   <br>Try and distract yourself by reading some other manga series. I reccomend Berserk.</br>   favorite main 4 <br> top 3 coolest hatsu from each category </br>   tfw following HxH from 2002   <br> tfw most of my favorite manga are on hiatus </br>  <br> hiatuses are really painful. <br>Clamp will finish X some day, too.</br></br>  <br>Please stop.</br>   Only on episode 34. <br> Watching it for the first time while /a/ begs for Togashi to take it off Hiatus. <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br> watching </br>  <br> not reading the manga </br>  <br> all the series I once read that ended years ago on a permanent hiatus.  <br>If they will ever be continued, I'd have to reread them, I guess. At least HxH manages to bring out enough chapter in a decade to keep it's story in mind.<br><br><br>It's a pity they didn't animate it like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish Togashi would just draw like this all the time so we could have more frequent updates. No one reads HxH for the art.</br>  <br>You need help if you reed Hiatus X Hiatus.</br>  <br> I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful <br>Well you kind of get used to it, to be honest at this point I've completely forgot about HxH because I'm not expecting it to come back, it's too bad since they manga got really interesting but what can you do.</br></br>  <br>I do the same thing anon. It's pretty painful at this point.<br><br>The only day to really be looking though is SJ Thursdays, when HxH comes back it will be announced on the cover of the issue.</br></br></br>   gay yaoi shota shounen <br><br>I will never be interested in this waste of time.</br></br>  <br><br> New Shonen Jump <br> HE IS BACK (again, for real this time) <br> HxH fans around the world collectively cream themselves. <br> Togashi releases 3 chapters and announces a "few weeks off" due to health reasons <br><br>post yfw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad for you<br><br>Dumb frogposter</br></br></br>  With all those hiatus, why no one is trying to get the HxH audience?<br>Some argue that My Hero Academia and even Black Clover is managing to stay alive by filling the hole left by Naruto, did Jump ever had a manga similar to HxH?</br>  <br> get the HxH audience <br><br>You act like HxH fans only read this series. I imagine some of us read your mentioned manga.</br></br></br>  <br> did Jump ever had a manga similar to HxH? <br>The original HiatusxHiatus is on permanent hiatus since 2006.</br></br>  /a/, what did Chrollo say to Neon?  <br>I still don't get why he was wearing that bandage.</br>  <br>You know, I finally understood why Kurapika wanted to be an Enhancer. I think that Enhancement and Trasmutation are the best categories if what you'll do the most is fight. <br><br>I thought Conjurers would function like mages or something like that, where they could use really powerful hatsus but they would run out of aura really fast. <br><br><br>I can only imagine. I'm going on a year now.<br><br><br>Wasn't he easily recognizable because of his Peter's Cross? I imagine that's why wore it. Goddamn, his design for this part was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurapika wanted to be an enhancer because it's the most balanced category for combat. If he didn't have emperor's time, Uvo's punches would have broken his spine.<br>I thought his hatsu was pretty funny, because it's pretty special snowflakeish but all it does is make him better at the most basic things like defense.</br></br>  <br> chicken <br>That's clearly a turkey.</br></br>  <br>stop reading shounen garbage</br>  <br>we facebook now <br> <br><br>as expected from this cancerous thread</br></br></br></br>  Do you think Togashi plans out the series plot during hiatus or after he's told he has a week to release a chapter or you'll get fired you useless piece of shit cunt?  <br>Yeah, I know why he wanted to be one. And yes, it is pretty funny. But I'll be sad if that's the only thing he uses ET for. I'm hoping he'll develop a hatsu for each category. Kurapika's smart, he can do it.<br><br><br>You really needed some quotation marks, dude. <br>And I honestly don't know. I imagine he has a rough draft in his head of where he wants to take things to, but will deviate if necessary. Something like "let the story write itself.'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else did you expect from a shitty shounen thread? It caters to the lowest of the low.</br>  I can't understand why HxH is considered good tier when its creator keeps fucking everyone over.<br><br>Even Japan is sick of it</br></br>  <br>When you look at what happened with YYH and the fact that he has some pretty serious health issues, you can't really blame Togashi. I'd love more chapters, but all we can do is hope he recovers and starts drawing again.</br>  <br><br>Come on guys, we can wait 6 more months.<br><br>https://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/</br></br></br></br>  Reminder  <br>Gon &gt; Kurapika &gt; Leorio &gt; Killua<br><br>Specialist: Pika, Chrollo, Pitou<br>Enhancer: Palm, Youpi, Netero<br>Manipulator: Illumi, Shoot, Morel<br>Emitter: Leorio, Franklin, Knuckle<br>Conjurer: Jesus fuck this is hard. Pika, Kite, Shizuku?<br>Transmuter: Hisoka, Machi, Feitan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw HxH is making me gay as fuck <br>I hope the hiatus never ends.</br></br>  <br>Damn anon, that's some good taste. I would have put Knov instead of Shizuku though.</br>  <br>Why did Pokkle and Ponzu have to die?</br>  <br>Because Pokkle is a weak faggot who took a qt to a dangerous mission<br>He probably also indirectly caused a lot more deaths because of his lobotomy</br></br>  <br>Togashi got tired of people shipping them because of filler in '99</br>  <br>Worst boyfriend ever. And he strengthened the enemy, what a cunt.</br>  <br>Reminder that he got beat by ants that didn't even know nen. That's pretty pathetic.</br>  <br>What is this, a hiatus chart for ants?</br>  Does Togashi just not want to do it anymore?  <br>If that was the case, he'd have done the same thing he did with YYH, not start a new promising arc. He seemed pretty inspired for that one, too.</br>  <br>Just read better manga.</br>  <br> HxH is making me gay </br>  <br><br>What, you disagree that this show is gay?<br><br>What the hell are you even doing in here then? We sexually lust over little boys in 9/10 threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4chan "made" a lot of people gay, anon. Just embrace it.</br>  <br>Suicide watch going strong.</br>  <br> Dude! No! Shota and gay porn are two different things! </br>  <br>Since when does how much you like an author affect how much you like a work? Berserk is also not good by your logic.<br><br>Hiatuses probably increase the overall quality when you think about it. Churning out weekly chapters leads to running out of ideas, poor long term planning, and generally just dragging on too long. HxH has probably benefited from all the time Togashi has to think about the story.</br></br></br>  <br> running out of ideas, poor long term planning, and generally just dragging on too long <br>chimera ant in a nutshell</br></br>  <br>Of the things you listed, only dragging on too long applies to CA. I don't like the length either but you're an idiot.</br>  <br>Did CA have too much character development for you?</br>  <br>Delete this</br>  <br>Trips of truth.</br>  <br>Except CA arc is the best example of taking your time and coming up with good ideas. It might have been a bit meandering at the start when the setting was being established, but the palace invasion onward was obviously thoroughly planned. Couldn't wrap up so many character arcs otherwise.</br>  Try being a NANA fan......sorry but I don't give a fuck about your 2 year hiatus when NANA has been on hiatus for 6.  <br>How many threads have you posted this in?</br>  <br><br>Just this one afaik, possibly 2 though that other one must've been months ago. Nana is a very popular manga and has a well known very long hiatus.<br><br>Sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all hiatuses are created equal. I loved Nana but I don't feel any serious urge to see the end, there wasn't as much half resolved plot as there is in HxH.</br>  <br>I was thinking of picking it up but i don't want to follow a 4th manga that is on permanent hiatus.<br> Is it worth it? </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is not a girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is pure you sick fuck.</br>  <br>Please don't.</br>  <br>Pure girls don't kill.</br>  <br><br>I think so but only if you can handle an unbroken haitus.<br><br><br><br>Disagree, I cannot even remember wtf was going on in Hunter x Hunter. Nana drops off at a crucial and life shattering point of Nana's disappearance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>If Togashi had planned it through, it could have been a solid arc and completed in much less time. Though I appreciate its ambition. Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Nana has one big unresolved plot point, HxH has a bunch. You not being able to remember things doesn't mean they don't exist. <br><br>Battle shounen naturally has more going on than a story based on romance and friendship alone.</br></br></br>  <br>How does killing make Pitou a slut?<br><br>Togashi obviously had planned it. Shit, some things that were in the first 15 chapters were mentionned in the last few ones, and the character development of most important characters was gradual through the arc.<br>I know people like to shit on this arc but at least try not to be wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he </br>  <br> completed in much less time. <br>Considering your complaint is about the length, you probably take issue with the most well planned aspect of the arc, which is all the different plot points. Multiple storylines happening at once drag out the pace by necessity, but it also takes a lot of planning ahead to ensure each character plays an important role and all the loose ends are resolved.</br></br>  <br> scanlation </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br> implying <br>she's literally saint mary</br></br>  <br>in all version they use a male word , sorry</br>  <br> Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time. <br>Optimistic, aren't you? Enjoy your new cast of plot devices.</br></br>  I've never read much except the first chapter or something, is the art just like that in the weekly one?  <br> Enjoy your new cast of plot devices. <br>What<br><br>Yes, bakabt has the redrawn scans though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The japanese doesn't.</br>  <br>I have my fingers crossed that they won't be vessels for the narrative</br>  <br> that picture </br>  <br>I want to fuck Pitou.</br>  <br>I want to sexually pet Pitou.</br>  <br>I want to sexually molest Pitou.</br>  Who are you're favorite girls?  <br>Bisky<br>Palm<br> Pitou </br></br></br>  <br> wake up <br> check /a/ <br> Still no news of an Outlaw Star continuation.  <br><br>No really, this would have made a bigger impact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kite, Paku, Canary, Senritsu, Mito</br>  Would you give therapy to Gon?  <br>Pika</br>  <br>Why would you want to make a girl out of such a perfect boy?</br>  <br> boy <br>He's a man.</br></br>  Guys OP asked for help long timr ago did someone send him help?, are you ok OP?  <br>You don't understand, he's my favourite boy and favourite girl.</br>  <br>Posting Pika always helps.</br>  <br>Got a problem?</br>  <br> youtube thumbnail <br> forneverworld <br>Meruem wouldn't have wanted this</br></br></br>  <br>Bisky, Pitou and Paprika</br>  <br> Pitou <br><br> Pika <br><br> Pitou and Paprika <br>I know there's not that many girls but that doesn't mean you should post boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pitou <br> boy </br></br>  <br>Kurapika is a pure maiden. I have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  <br>Komugi, maybe Palm and Pitou too</br>  <br> that innocent look on Gon's face just before he threatens to kill Komugi <br>Damn</br></br>  <br>Gon was pretty intense during the invasion, but part of what made him so intense is how he seemed so calm about it.</br>  <br>Pika's bestness transcends gender.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Being so best shouldn't be allowed.</br>  <br>We cannot blame him for it. He never asked to be the best, he just is.</br>  <br>Gon</br>  <br>gross</br>    Am I the only one who likes HxH's art?  <br>It changes a lot, so it's hard to tell. I really like when Togashi actually tries though.</br>  <br>it's relatively simple, but it's great sometimes</br>  <br>I love it.</br>  <br>I love HxH's art, but it's secondary to the story.</br>  <br>Gon was so muscular before, what happened? Did the wish return the babyfat?</br>  <br>It's cool</br>  <br>That's not Togashi's art, it's some shitty redraw.</br>  <br/>  Best ant.  <br>It's okay, OP. You'll make it through as long as you love best boy.</br>  <br> posting worst boy </br>  <br>You being silly or something, anon? He's so sweet!</br>  <br>worst boy is illumi</br>  <br>Worst character in the damn series.</br>  <br>You're being pretty silly, too. He's so endearing that it hurts!</br>  <br>Illumi is best boy. Killua doesn't appreciate his perfect, kind older brother enough.</br>  Why are these threads so gay?  <br>is there a reason why togashi made him so unlikeable?</br>  <br> Killua best boy <br> Illumi worst boy <br>Holy shit anon, that is awful taste.</br></br></br>  <br>ENDEARING<br>NDEARING<br>DEARING<br>EARING<br>ARING<br>RING<br>ING<br>NG<br>G</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SHIT<br>HIT<br>IT<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said Killua is best boy. Killua is second best boy after Gon</br>  <br>To set him apart from Gon, I guess.</br>  if the zoldyck's wanted killua to be the new heir of the household, why didn't they immediately start training him nen?  <br>so he wouldn't use it to become independent too early. they wanted to control him. it didn't matter though because Gon claimed him anyway.</br>  Hisoka is obviously best boy.<br><br><br>It would have been harder to keep him under control. Remember how batshit insane and obsessive his mom and Illumi are?</br></br></br>  <br>They never said Killua was best boy; that was me. You really shouldn't assume things, anon. We didn't even type alike.<br><br>Maybe you think he's unlikeable because you have different taste, yeah?</br></br></br>  didn't HxH get axed by the publisher?  <br> filename </br>  <br>Will Hisoka ever win the Machi?</br>  <br> Remember how batshit insane and obsessive his mom and Illumi are? <br>That's offensive. It's personally reasonable for Illumi to want to keep his little brother out of harm's way. Look at all the trouble he's gotten himself into without Illumi's guiding hand there to protect and nurture him.</br></br>  <br>Fucking love this scene. It pretty much defines what Gon goes through during the Chimera Ants arc and the rest of the series too, but to a lesser extent. There are things that he is not able to tame in this world.</br>  <br> There are things that he is not able to tame in this world. <br>Like Killua's shit personality.</br></br>  <br> kil needs an isolated child to correct his behavior and train him like a puppy </br>  <br>His personality is endearing and cute.<br>Killua is very tameable.</br></br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. <br>That joke isn't funny anymore.</br></br>  <br>Gon tamed Killua very well. notice how as soon as he was no longer the center of Gon's attention is when Killua went to shit. Killua's personality disorder is medicated by boy love</br>  <br>His personality went to shit when he left home.</br>  <br>Illumi pls</br>  <br>Go to bed Illumi</br>  <br>his personality was always shit<br><br>he even acknowledged it</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why but this picture gives me butterflies in my stomach each time i see it.</br>  <br>It's because it's Gon and Killua being carefree as they'll never be again</br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. </br>  Man why does Togashi just doesn't get someone else to do the drawing and just do the story  <br>Because without Togashi's art it wouldn't be the same.</br>  <br>It's so ugly any other artist can imitate it.</br>  <br>I vote Murata</br>  <br> Togashi's art <br> ugly <br>Other than the scribble chapters can you post one page that you would consider ugly?</br></br></br>  <br>Every single one.</br>  <br>You didn't post a page, anon. Post one.<br> select the food <br> it's all food <br>I'm not sure how to feel about this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to post one when I said it's all ugly.</br>  <br>If it's all ugly you shouldn't have a problem finding an image that proves your point.</br>  <br>0/10</br>    <br>Murata is fucking great, but i still preffer the paneling and art of Togashi</br>  <br>Yeah, Murata's panelling feels a bit unnatural imo. If Togashi can hand him the storyboard then it's perfect though</br>  <br>Shit, I would just take the storyboard at this point.</br>  <br>Ho many can you name /a/?<br> Yugi <br> Yusuke <br> Ken <br> Bobobo </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously not able to name all of those?</br>  <br>I haven't read much shounen.</br>  <br>You should read more. Most of it is worth reading.</br>  <br>But anon, I'm not joking. His personality cute and I love him!<br>You just have different tastes than I do, and that's okay.</br></br>  <br> because a person who emotionally abandons his supposed best friend and can't show him any affection what so ever, yet still expects it out of said best friend is cute. <br> becaues a person who isn't there for their best friend when they go through an emotional breakdown and yet still guilt trips them afterwards is cute. <br><br>anon plz.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon always had a very small build.</br>  <br> girl </br>  <br>Mistakes don't define a person.<br>But, both of the things you've said have been pointed out within the series, so since it's been brought to attention that obviously means Killua will grow past being like that, reflect, and (maybe) apologize to Gon for it.<br>However, I don't wish to get into an argument over this. If you see him as a bad person, there isn't much I can say to change your mind, and as someone who's had this same argument several times I think it'd be best if we dropped this, and maybe you accept others have different tastes than you. I'm not sure why people saying they like Killua seems to set off so many people in these threads, but again, I suppose it's all up to taste.</br></br></br>  <br> h-he's not shit, he'll grow out of it! <br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>Fuck me, meant for </br>  <br>Anon I think you've been reading too much fanfic. No one ever called out Killua for being shit to Gon during the CA arc. And no one has ever called out Killua for being unable to show Gon any affection yet expecting Gon to show him it. Killua himself hasn't realize that he was shit to Gon and that he abandoned him, when Gon needed him the most. Instead Killua expected Gon to give him an apology for crap that mostly went on in his own head.<br><br>Is Killua a bad person no, Killua does this things without realizing that he's being hurtful. Does Killua have a shit personality that is in no way shape or form cute? Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Pituo doesn't have a gender, the only ant that reproduces is the Queen which means all the other ones don't really have a gender or are male.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure Alluka chastised him for his behavior.<br>Like I said, I do not wish to go through these motions again, just look into virtually any HxH thread and you'll find these same arguments.<br>I think Killua is a good person, and I personally like his personality. <br>Again, if you don't like his personality, that's your personal taste and I won't argue about it. There are plenty of people that do like it.<br><br>That's your interpretation/opinion. I don't really care how you see him. I like him, and your opinion won't change that.<br><br>Sorry if any of this came off as rude. I don't mean to offend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Comparing MHA to Naruto <br><br><br>They aren't even that similar I don't know why everyone is comparing them, if anything it takes more from one piece with all of the colorful and interesting characters and their interesting powers. We even know that Kohei is a OP fan as he sent in fan art when he was 15. Pic related to that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka only chastised him for the guilt trip, however she never chastised him for the other crap I mentioned, and no Alluka chastising him for guilt tripping Gon doesn't make the fact that Killua was guilt tripping Gon any better. It doesn't make Killua's personality any less shitty. All it means is that Alluka doesn't have a shitty personality and is able to recognize that there are somethings you just don't do.<br><br>All you can say to counter it is maybe Killua will grow out of it, but that's not changing the fact that he's shit in the present. Its not just the fact that Killua made mistakes that makes his personality shit. His personality is shit that's why he makes those mistakes.<br><br>Maybe it would be easier if you could say what about him you found cute, but its really hard to accept your opinion when the story shows that the things you find cute are in fact not cute at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm surprised /a/ likes HxH so much.<br>After watching the first few episodes I felt like it was gonna be lackluster as fuck but episode 3 or I think two turned around after seeing how based Gon was.</br>  <br>Well, I find a lot of things about him cute (outside of physical aspects). <br>He seems to dress how he wants and doesn't care about how it looks, he's mischievous, cheeky, can be a bit snarky, and confident. He has a huge sweet tooth and a horrible tendency to take poor care of money he earns. He gambles, he's messy, he gets embarrassed easily, and he's logical, loyal, and kind.<br>I think Killua's really swell.</br></br></br>  <br>I basically came to love him starting at pic related. It's cheesy that he just wants to be a normal boy and follow Gon around, and that Gon just happens to be the only person who could ever like him outside of his family, because they all, like you, think he's shit. Even Leorio never really got used to him. I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared. I think deep down he's really a good person, he's painfully oblivious to how other people feel, and he can invent entire conflicts in his own head. I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute.</br>  Why didn't he just tell Gon that Kite was fucked?  <br>he wanted to protect his smile, but he only managed to do it in the short term</br>  <br>He didn't want to rain on his parade, he was overcome by Gon's hopefulness.<br><br>That bitch with the bubble gum should have told him that Kaito probably wasn't coming back, at least as his old self.</br></br></br>  <br>I admire your will power. If I took half the posts I see here seriously I would have killed myself long ago.</br>  <br>Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic, or at least confuse Killua's thoughts for actual narration.<br><br>Killua has never once shown Gon that he cared, in every time that Gon has ever been affectionate with Killua, Killua has always rebuffed him, I think you're mistaking one of Killua's conversations with Palm or Ikalgo with ones that he's had with Gon. It's also a lie to say that others don't really get used to him, since its really Killua whose holding Leorio at arm's length, not the other way around. On top of that we do get to see Killua open up to others, as the CA arc shows us later on its not others that's the problem its Killua.<br><br>I don't know what's adorable about a obsession driven by selfishness, Killua notices what Gon is going through but doesn't care because he wants Gon to pay attention to him. His overreaction is what causes him to physically and emotionally abandon his friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selfishness.<br><br><br><br>Only Killua was there and could say that Kite was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still not interesting in arguing, but <br> Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic <br>That person is not the one you've been talking/said the original fanfic line to, I am. I was <br>I don't mean to disregard your post, apologies if it comes off that way. I just thought you'd like to know who you are replying to.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I feel for you, Killuafags, I admire those of you who don't shitpost.</br></br></br>  <br> Killua holding Gon's rod </br>  <br>correction- don't shitpost too much and argue, since everybody shitposts some<br><br><br>I am still conflicted about this. Killua sees how powerful Pitou is and that Kite is screwed so he knocks Gon out and runs away with him. He didn't directly see Kite die, but he saw Pitou's power. After that they see broken Kite.<br><br>He never directly saw Kite's head chopped off, right? So maybe there was a possibility, however small, that Kite is still alive but broken. At least that's how I got it. If he told Gon that he should let go, Gon would never accept it because he saw Kite "alive".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pika Pika  Can Chrollo beat Netero?  <br>Can pigs fly?</br>  <br>In the HxH world, probably.</br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>He says "i let Kite to die" in the page just before. Killua is much more experienced about that sort of things than Gon. He knew Kite was dead.</br>  <br> I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared <br> I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute. <br>what the fuck is wrong with killuafags</br></br></br>  <br>Deluded beings who are driven by their cock.</br>  <br>This is a reallly interesting point of view to me. I don't frequent HxH threads on here often, and I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. Huh.</br>  <br> I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. <br>This is what happens when you take a character's thoughts for actual narration.<br>Same thing happened at the end of the arc, with people believing Ikalgo's thoughts were the moral of the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon's behavior in contrast to Killua's in the Election arc gives it more context. Gon learned from his mistakes and tries to make things right with Ging, Kite, and Killua. Killua blames Gon for his mistakes and guilt trips him for them.</br>  <br>But then I suppose you could say from Killua's POV it really was Gon who was pushing him away?<br><br>I wish there'd be some arc of HxH with more of Gon's thoughts, because I'd honestly like to get inside his head.<br><br>But you know.<br><br> hiatus x hiatus </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you apologize for fucking up THIS badly?</br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>Of course, but when you look at it objectively, Killua fucked up more than Gon.</br>  <br>that's not ugly</br>   All this talk about kil abandoning gon in CA. <br>What the fuck was he supposed to do in that scenario? Gon was WAY beyond helping. I always saw that part as gon isolating himself and kil just accepting it while knowing that he couldn't do anything to help gon.</br>  <br>Tell Gon Kite was dead and stop letting him delude himself into believing he could save Kite. He only was beyond saving because Killua did absolutely nothing for him.</br>  <br> Gon was WAY beyond helping. <br>Because of Killua. We'll never know if Gon could have been saved because Killua deliberately lied to him.</br></br>  <br>yes he can , chrollo can fight silva and zeno in same times , and he can use some nen with his book , netero can't beat him .</br>  <br>Chrollo would probably die after a couple of hits.</br>  <br><br>You guys act like he was trying to hurt gon by telling him a man he cared about was still alive. <br>You have to remember Kil's just a kid too, in that moment he just wanted to agree with his friend and not put out gon's light which he adored so much. If that's not caring (despite the unforeseen resulting pain) then I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br>It did him more wrong than good.<br>You also have to take into account his behavior during the election arc.</br></br>  <br>He was so caring when he emotionally and physically abandoned Gon, shouted at his decaying body, and guilted him after he recovered from his suicide attempt!</br>  <br> It did him more wrong than good <br>Kil had no way of knowing that though, he did what he believed would be best in that situation.<br>My memory's a bit hazy so I can't really remember, what happened in the election ark?</br></br></br>  <br> Kil had no way of knowing that though <br>He did once he realized that Gon was losing it. Off the top of my head, there was the time where they found Kite's puppet corpse thing, Morel was testing Gon, the moment just before the invasion and his confrontation with Pitou where Killua noticed it. Although it probably was too late for the last 2.<br> My memory's a bit hazy so I can't really remember, what happened in the election ark? <br>Go read it again. If you look at it objectively, you'll see how wrong Killua is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He did once he realized that Gon was losing it <br>That's not really something that could be helped. Once Gon started to lose it he was out of kil's reach. That's not his fault.<br> you'll see how wrong kil is <br>I think I'm going to reread the whole thing sometime soon. I miss this series too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> killua's a major reason why gon got to that point <br> it's not his fault </br></br>  <br> Once Gon started to lose it he was out of kil's reach. <br>He managed to calm him down when he was with Morel, and somewhat let him regain his composure when he was facing Pitou. Gon would have been horribly traumatized either way, but if Killua was the one who told him that Kite was dead instead of Pitou, things wouldn't have gotten out of hand as much as they did.</br></br>  <br>That's fair enough, I just think your trying too hard to blame kil when his intentions where clearly good.</br>  <br>Of course, no one is saying that Killua did it to harm Gon. But the thing is that he never realized he was at fault and instead blamed Gon.</br>  <br> show has 4 fags as the main characters <br> asks why threads are gay <br><br>Do you even smile again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Leorio is straight.</br>  <br> leorio <br> kurapika <br> killua <br> gay </br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Killua is gay.</br>  <br>Yeah maybe, but I think Gon still would have wanted revenge for Kite's death. And I don't think Kil (or a lot of people) could have told their best friend that the person they admire is most likely dead when you can't say you know for sure and they're trying their best to be positive about an obviously grim scenario.<br><br>I think that failing to prevent something you could have doesn't mean you're at fault. And Gon did go completely insane there at the end (to the point where he regretted his actions) I think Kil is right to scold Gon for that(not blame, scold)<br>There was a lot of wrong doing and a lot that could have been done differently but to blame a child for not doing something that seemed hard and wrong at the time and hate him for it is taking it a bit overboard don't you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>At this point you're only speculating.<br>The facts are here, Killua fucked up because he was upset he wasn't Gon's center of attention and blamed his own mistakes on him. <br>Gon was experiencing severe trauma and didn't have anyone to help him though it, so he can hardly be blamed either.</br></br></br>  <br>was*</br>  <br>I think I'm speculating about as much as you are. We're both just trying to get inside the characters heads to understand their actions.<br>Gon did have someone to help him through it, he just wouldn't listen because he was so lost.<br>He knew what he wanted and didn't let anything get in the way of that.</br></br></br>  <br> Gon did have someone to help him through it, he just wouldn't listen because he was so lost. <br>Why was he lost? Because it was too late at that point. Killua reacted when it was much too late and got pushed away as a result, and still cried about it.</br></br>  <br>reminder that killua knew gon was losing himself and chose not to do anything about it</br>  <br> Why was he lost <br>Again you just putting blame on kil unfairly<br>These are the facts as you put it so well in your earlier post. Kil tried to keep gon cheerful after they escaped pitou. Gon found out about kite's death in a worse way as a result. Kil let his friend have some space. Gon went on a rampage and blocked everyone out.<br>Stop trying to point the finger at kil for something he didn't do when he thought it was right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to recall the events of the arc properly. When Gon got reunited with Kite's corpse puppet thing, he deluded himself into believing he was still alive and possible to save. However, Killua knew that Kite was dead since they left him behind. Then comes the scene where he has to stop Gon because he's starting to lose it in front of Morel.<br>So at this point, Killua is LETTING Gon delude himself, even knowing it's harmful for him and that it will only make things worse once Gon accepts the fact that Kite is dead.<br>You're not looking at things objectively anon. Killua did abandon Gon emotionally, and still blamed all of it on him.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't see that at all. When Gon saw Kite's corpse puppet thing I took it as Gon realizing that Kite had died back then and him just not wanting to accept it (something common in grieving) This also explains why he actually did lose it in front of Morel, because he knew that Kite was dead and Kil knew that he knew and accepted his grieving by stopping him when he started to lose it and just being by his side as they went on. <br>I guess it's all just speculation though.</br></br>  And Gonfags ruin yet another thread with their ridiculous hyperbole and melodrama.  <br>I don't think Killua knew for sure that Kite was dead either, bro. Both Killua and Palm were shocked when Pitou didn't heal Kite and instead turned on Gon. They weren't expecting it.</br>  <br>Killua didn't expect Pitou to turn on Gon because they had Komugi hostage.</br>  <br> I took it as Gon realizing that Kite had died back then and him just not wanting to accept it <br>Doubtful, see pic related. He only lost it against Morel because he told him "attack me as if i were the one responsible for Kite".<br><br>Killua was only surprised because he didn't know Pouf tricked Pitou.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wah wah why do people realize Killua is shit <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Do you think Gon "always look at the bright side of things" would be that mad at what happened to kite if he didn't know there was no bringing him back?<br>Come on, be real here.</br></br>  <br><br>He also told Gon to calm down and not kill Pitou because they couldn't get Kite back that way. There was no reason to negotiate with Pitou and let Gon go alone with it if it couldn't give them what they wanted, so his actions make no sense if he didn't think there was any chance of Kite being revived.</br></br>  <br>Gon was mad because he felt responsible for what happened to Kite.<br><br>At that point, Gon was about to kill both Pitou and Komugi. Killua realized Komugi was an important person and that Gon would regret killing an innocent.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't self anger, that was grief.</br>  <br>That still doesn't explain why the hell he would let Gon go off with Pitou to get Kite healed when that's just putting him in unnecessary danger.</br>  <br>You have to put things into context here. Gon was too weak to help Kite after indirectly causing him to lose his arm (and possibly his fight against Pitou) and too weak to beat Knuckle to be able to go to NGL and "save" Kite. Gon was extremely angry at himself, which is the reason why he let Kite's corpse beat the shit out of him.<br><br> unnecessary danger <br>Killua knew Pitou wouldn't try anything as long as they had Komugi hostage. He didn't even care about Gon being in danger that much, he even wanted to die with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He didn't even care about Gon being in danger that much, he even wanted to die with him. <br>You're interpreting things in an absolutely retarded way. Of course Killua wanted Gon to live, but the situation was dangerous enough that he assumed they were going to get killed by Pitou, in which case he wanted to go out together with Gon. He was not actually wishing death on him.</br></br>  <br>I never said Killua wished death on Gon, what are you talking about? I'm only saying he wasn't set on avoiding "unnecessary danger".</br>  <br>Well again this is all speculation, but the fact that we'd seen gon be mad at himself for being weak can give us an idea that something this extreme is more than that. If you just read into it a little more, the vibe is putting off grief more than anything. But I'm done arguing with you.<br>In the end, this is all speculation.</br></br>  <br>My bad, I assumed that's what you were trying to say since I've seen that same argument thrown around in these threads. <br><br>But even if Pitou wouldn't do anything, there was no point of having Gon go with it if they couldn't get Kite back. They might as well have used Komugi as a bargaining chip for Pitou's own life instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Well when you think about it, it was the ideal situation for Killua. Pitou would have to tell Gon Kite was dead, and if Gon wanted to take his anger out on her then she could do nothing against him because of their hostage.</br>  <br>I love her deep-olution</br>  <br>Can pigs learn nen?</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>I really, highly doubt Killua would've taken all the steps he did and reacted the way he did if he didn't think Kite could come back. Even if Pitou hadn't turned on him, Gon still would have flipped out when Pitou revealed Kite was dead. I doubt Killua thought things through that little.</br>  <br>Pig arc when?</br>  <br>Buhara is a hunter so yes.</br>  <br>Come on anon, Killua explicitely says he let Kite to die and that Gon's optimism was only light hiding the truth. Killua probably only didn't want to be the one to deal with telling Gon Kite was dead, like he didn't want to deal with Nanika.</br>  <br>I understand all of that perfectly well. Didn't I explain that I found him cute despite him not expressing any affection towards Gon? Why are you telling me a bunch of stuff I already know</br>  <br>He said Gon's optimism was light and that it was hard for him to look at directly, meaning he considered himself, the "darkness," unworthy of Gon. I think you're referring to a mistranslation in the scanlations.<br><br>If Killua really was that reluctant to tell Gon that Kite was dead, he wouldn't want it coming from Pitou of all people. It would be much more Killua-like to arrange things so Gon never finds out the truth at all.</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't give a damn about him if his looks matched his hideous personality.</br>  <br>Different Killuanon here, and jokes on you, anon, it's his personality that I find cute.</br>  <br>I explained that I think his personality is cute though</br>  <br>What's cute about an unhealthy mindset?</br>  <br>It's executed well, makes sense that he ended up that way given his upbringing, and flawed characters are more interesting to watch. Gon isn't exactly flawless either, you know. Most of the cast isn't, and that's why it's so good.</br>  <br>nothing, they just pretend to like his personality 'cause they want to rape him<br><br>same as pitoufags</br></br></br>  <br>So Buhara is a cannibal</br>  <br> tfw no new pika chapters <br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>Killua was clearly trying to delay it as much as he could, but there was a point where Gon had to learn it.<br>You didn't really adress any of my points either. Again, it was the perfect situation for Killua.</br></br>  <br>Nice try. There's only one HxH character I want to fuck, and that's  Palm. </br>  <br>The difference is that Gon realizes his flaws while Killua doesn't, and instead blames him for his own mistakes.<br>Killua's personality is objectively shit.</br></br>  <br> makes sense that he ended up that way given his upbringing <br>Killua can easily reach out to other people, as shown with Palm and Ikalgo. His upbringing is no excuse for what he did to Gon. Shit personality.<br> Gon isn't exactly flawless either, you know. <br>Except Gon acknowledged his flaws and Killua blamed Gon for his. And Gon doesn't have an awful personality paired with his flaws like Killua does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you not find Gon's hopeless, childish optimism cute, even though it ends up causing him horrible grief in the end? Even Killua loved it knowing it was bad</br>  <br>But I did address your point. If the idea is that Killua doesn't want Gon hurt, why would he let their worst enemy be the one to crush his spirit? It doesn't make sense. At least have Morel or whoever the fuck break the news.</br>  <br> the only ant that reproduces is the Queen <br><br>Every ant that isn't the Royal Guard can reproduce. Soldiers are supposed to go off and breed with other species while kings are supposed to produce more queens.</br></br></br>  <br>Killua's thoughts do not match up to the reality, in fact had Killua not been in his head so much he could have helped Gon.<br><br>Killua's thoughts are not the narration for the events.</br></br></br>  <br> If the idea is that Killua doesn't want Gon hurt <br>That wasn't my point, i said he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like with Nanika. Again, if Pitou was the one breaking the news, Killua might have believed Gon could have taken revenge without any risks thanks to their hostage.</br></br>  <br>Why are you bringing Gon into this? Nobody is talking about not liking Gon, only that they like Killua.<br><br><br><br>What did he do to Gon that was so terrible? Ask for an apology? He was the one who brought Gon back in the end and thanked him for everything he did for him. While he certainly didn't deal with plenty of things well himself, I don't know how you could expect him to not be upset after what happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An apology for what? Being suicidal because he was dealing with something highly traumatizing, and had no one to help him through it? I don't think you realize Killua did absolutely nothing for Gon through the CA arc.</br>  <br> he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like with Nanika. <br>Uh, what? He didn't avoid breaking any news to Nanika. He told Nanika to go away forever as a roundabout way of protecting her.<br><br>You can speculate that, but there's really no evidence that anybody involved thought it was completely impossible to bring Kite back. If not Killua, someone else would've stopped that shit at the door.</br></br></br></br>  <br>was meant for</br>  <br>Sorry, i think i fucked up my sentence.<br> he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like he didn't want to deal Nanika. <br>Running away was a huge theme for Killua.<br><br>There are more elements suggesting that Killua knew Kite was dead than the opposite.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, an apology for rushing ahead and doing his own thing without stopping to think of Killua as a partner.<br><br>Saying Killua did nothing for Gon is an exaggeration. He stayed with him, worked with him so they could get Kite back, cried with him, and stopped him when he was getting out of control with Morel. You don't just do things for people with words. Of course it wasn't enough, but acting like Killua willfully abandoned Gon is ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br> Running away was a huge theme for Killua. <br>Oh, yes, I agree with that completely. I just don't think that him knowing Kite was permadead makes any sense, but I suppose we've come to an impasse there.</br></br>  <br>He outright admits to it. Don't take Killua's thoughts as narration, his thoughts don't match up to reality and frequently contradict.</br>  <br> Do you not find Gon's hopeless, childish optimism cute, even though it ends up causing him horrible grief in the end? <br>No, I don't. Why would I?</br></br>  Killua keeping Gon in check was the one thing that kept the friendship equal. The moment Killua allowed Gon to believe his own “Kite is alive” bullshit, their friendship turned unequal with Killua at the bottom of it.<br><br>By letting Gon go unchecked, Killua isn’t doing either of them any favours. Gon starts to slowly but surely lose it, and Killua finds that he disappears under Gon’s shadow, and he can’t handle that emotionally. That leads to a vicious cycle of not voicing his reservations about Kite in fear that Gon would overwhelm him even further, which leads to Gon finding new and creative ways of destroying himself as thoroughly as possible.<br><br>I’ve been having a lot of trouble putting my finger on where Killua failed Gon and putting it into words. On the outside, supporting your friend seems okay. But that’s not Killua supporting Gon, that’s Killua enabling Gon instead of pulling the brakes and telling Gon that there’s no chance in hell Kite is alive.<br><br>In the end, the CA arc was just a terrible turn of events for everyone involved.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that shit wad all in Killua's head. Also Gon didn't run on ahead, Killua left him. Killua did willfully abandon Gon, don't mistake his thoughts as narration.</br>  <br>When does he admit it? I don't recall that at all.</br>  <br>It really comes down to Gon being unable to face failure and the death of a loved one, and Killua needing to be the center of Gon's attention</br>  <br>You what, mate? You're now just denying events that happened on screen.</br>  <br>I'm not it's who is mistaking events and mistaking Killua's thoughts as narration, when they don't even match the events.</br>  <br>The moment Gon wakes up.</br>  <br>Are you referring to when Gon jumped to the building where Pitou was and Killua stayed behind for a few seconds because he was too preoccupied with his thoughts?</br>  <br>You keep repeating "Killua's thoughts aren't narration" without explaining what the hell you mean. The events on screen were as I described, I barely even touched on Killua's personal interpretation of them.</br>    <br>No, I was thinking more of Gon telling Killua to fuck off when he told him not to murder Pitou, telling Killua to shut up and let him do the talking, and overall not consulting Killua in a single decision he made since they started the invasion.</br>  <br>That was right before Gon insisted Kite was alive. Killua then got caught up in Gon's optimism and desperately wanted to believe he was right.</br>  <br> wanted to believe <br>Then you're admitting he knew Kite was dead.</br></br>  <br>Does it need explanation? Killua's thoughts aren't narration, he's over thinking shit and being a drama queen. Hell Killua even knows that's it's not about him, but he wants it to be.</br>  <br>Which was the result of Killua abandoning Gon.</br>  <br>Deep down, he probably had I clue, but I think he ended up in denial just as much as Gon was.<br><br><br>It does need an explanation, because I mentioned events that really happened and all you can is "thoughts aren't narration!" What part of what I mentioned are you claiming didn't happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he didn't do that. Not giving Gon an emotional pep talk is not the same as abandoning him.</br>  I want Killuafags and anti-Killuafags to leave.  <br>In my defense, they started it.</br>  What did he mean?  <br>I think he was talking about Kite's attack pattern.</br>  <br>Except it wasn't, Killua outright admits that he doesn't give a shit about Kite and that he wanted to be Gon's center of attention. Ergo his thoughts which is really just him over thinking and being selfish aren't reliable. Hell we even have a third person narrator so that you can tell the difference.</br>  <br>They talking about how Kite's movements are mechanical like a doll's, and Gon could read the patterns of his attacks. Yet he was actively choosing not to dodge.</br>  <br>I honestly have no clue which of my points you're even referring to now.</br>  <br>It was after Killua had failed to<br> tell Gon Kite was dead <br> enabled his delusion  <br> wanted every thing to be about him <br> abandoned Gon physically </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Togashi ended YYH because of asshole editor.</br></br>  <br> Chrollo would have died very easily in the Yorkshin fight if the godfathers hadn't <br> He wouldn't even be able to react to Netero <br>Are all Ryodanfags this delusional?</br></br></br>  <br> tell Gon Kite was dead <br> enabled his delusion  <br>He fucked up in going along with Gon's delusion, but that's not abandonment. That's poor judgement.<br><br> wanted every thing to be about him <br>He hadn't even said anything to Gon about it at that point. As an anon here likes to point out so often, Killua's thoughts aren't spoken aloud.<br><br> abandoned Gon physically <br>When?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Killua outright admits that all he cares about is being the center of Gon's attention even while knowing what Gon was going through.</br>  <br>Killua ignoring Gon's emotional state to focus on his desire to be the center of Gon's world is emotional abandonment.<br><br>Doesn't change the fact that his motivation is selfish.<br><br>When he got to caught up in his thoughts and left Gon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't say it was all he cares about it. He said he was upset that Gon didn't rely on him as a friend during all of it. That's not being the center of attention, that's just wanting attention.<br><br>He also then admits that he's throwing a bit of a tantrum. But Killua is needy, so of course he feels bad when he's treated like he isn't needed.</br></br></br>  <br>Killua going along with Gon's delusion wasn't related to him wanting to be the center of Gon's world. It was related to him putting Gon on a pedestal and going along with whatever Gon says. Which is still bad, but the kid has problems.<br><br>I don't care about his motivation. It doesn't justify Gon shutting him down like you were trying to claim.<br><br>On the roof? He was one second behind him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> was <br>please, how do you think he's paying for him and Alluka's vacation? <br>he's slutting it up with older men.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes he did, read the fucking manga.<br><br>Killua never once admits that he's throwing a tantrum, you've been reading too much fanfic.</br></br></br>  So are discussions about the CA arc just a contest to see who fucked up the most?  <br>He does. "Tada no dada da." Your translations are bad, broski.</br>  <br>Yep. I think it's kind of a testament to how good Togashi's writing was, honestly.</br>  <br>Yes it was, he even fucking admits to it. He didn't care about Kite being dead, he didn't care about Gon's emotional state what he wanted was to be Gon's center of attention, and then still expects everything to be okay.<br><br>And that was enough for things to go south.<br><br>Gon shut him down because he was traumatized, and at his breaking point. Killua waited until the very last minute to say something to Gon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet you won't post the manga image of him admitting to throwing said tantrum.</br>  <br>I'm on my phone. It's the panel focused on his clenched fists during the hospital monologue.</br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br>Yeah, that one. "I was just a burden" is a mistranslation.</br>  <br>Which was really Killua talking about himself, not him admitting to his failure.<br><br>And if you want to say that that's a mistranslation do you have a better translation?</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, yes? "This is just a tantrum."</br>  <br><br>Kil is not a slut.</br></br>  <br>Considering the scene that happens right after that? yes, it is just a tantrum.</br>  <br>I don't speak moon so i'll have to take your word on that. <br>I don't know if you're the same anon, but someone also pointed out a mistranslation here  , what would be the correct translation?</br></br>  <br>...That was a translation of his thoughts.</br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night,  Illumi </br>  <br>Same anon, but correct translation is "Sometimes you shine so brightly I can't look at you directly."</br>  <br>Anon the scene you're talking about was followed up by him yelling about how he was going to make Gon apologize to him, yeah its another one of Killua's over reacting drama filled thoughts.</br>  <br>Does anyone have Viz's volume 30? It should have a better translation.</br>  <br>Were you even following the thread of conversation? An anon asked when he said he was throwing a tantrum, so I explained.</br>  <br>I am there's another anon who tried to say that the scene was Killua admitting to his faults instead of throwing a tantrum.</br>    <br>Literally nobody said that.</br>  Can't believe this fucking Chapter Black ripoff is liked on this board.  <br> stop discussing the manga guise <br><br> come and shitpost with me </br></br></br>  <br>Chimera Ant had great character development.</br>  <br>It's hardly similar to chapter black considering the moral of the story wasn't "humans are bad, and so is war, don't do war"<br>I liked chapter black but it was a bit too preachy</br></br>    <br>I would be embarrassed too if my crush said that to me.</br>  <br>but would you yell at him to stop?</br>  <br>No, but considering this is a manga it's hard to tell what tone he was using.<br>Don't know if the raws make it more clear.</br></br>  <br>No, it really didn't.

Plus I only keep what I know I will rewatch.</br>  <br> No its not. <br><br>They'll never catch me. The same multiaccount methods that succeed for private sites works against sadpanda too. To wit:<br>1. Don't use the same IP address<br>2. The safest way in case you are forgetful is to use separate PC to access. That prevents you from forgetting to clear cookies or forgetting that you have some non-closed browser process that hung in process manager which ended up revealing your other account's existence.<br>3. sadpanda works upon "suspected" guilt too. If you are suspected but not quite proven, you don't get banned, but you also don't collect any additional freebies at christmas time. My multiple accounts are gold as they get all freebies.<br>4. Don't vote galleries, gallery posts, or trade items between your accounts. Tenboro uses that to help flag which ones look suspicious. If you need more upvotes or visits to boost your statistics and GP, spam those gallery URL in 4chan panda threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Downloading porn, next you're going to tell us to go buy porn.</br>  <br>Enjoy having your favorite galleries DMCAd</br>  <br> Really stupid question I'm sure, but what's the difference between g.e-hentai and exhentai? <br><br>Exhentai was originally a "secret" place. There are 3 gallery systems. The old one on e-hentai. The new user-sponsored galleries on g.e-hentai.org. And sadpanda/exhentai. Sadpanda has several things not available on e-hentai and g.e-hentai galleries.<br><br>1. No ads.<br>2. More complete search results than on g.e-hentai<br>3. Topics not allowed for general public to openly access such as loli, shota, bestiality, guro, snuff, etc.<br>4. Controversial galleries get moved to exhentai.<br>5. Etcetera in the past such as sekret club and sekret sekret club and tiered privilege access experiments.<br>6. Users with enough privileges can make private galleries tagged in certain ways that can only be viewed with an exhentai account.<br>7. Etc. Sadpanda is the land of secrets so there are "plausible denial" things that general public is not to know about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So why does anyone even give a shit about g.e-hentai? Sorry, this is my first I actually bothered to look at one of these threads. <br><br>Huh? How could you not realize the public relations problem viewpoints? If you have to hand out a sitename, you give out g.e-hentai.org (if that gallery is on it). That way, anyone that hates loli, snuff, guro, or high controversial stuff won't get to t see it and thus complain about it.<br><br>g.e-hentai.org is also the lightning rod for anti-porn groups and crusading conservatives to look at. That way they don't get traction on loli or other topics such as guro and snuff which actually have laws against them. This is also why a lot of people in the past have NOT wanted sadpanda threads to bring unwanted publicity and scrutiny. But the "who cares i don't care" people won out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you even dumber than him?<br> inb4 bait </br></br>  Have some freshly translated Kloah.

It's all so graphic and messy my weak constitution can't take it.  <br>You sound like you need some more vanilla.</br>  <br> It's all so graphic and messy <br><br>So go enjoy </br></br></br>  <br> Love the shit out of fatalpulse art <br> Can't admire it in 90% of his work because tits and shit are being obscured by other things <br>Fuck I don't mind all that guro and fucked up shit but let me get a clear look at the girls body damn it.</br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/827911/9e34c9<wbr>4c3d/<br><br> oneshota  <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br><br>I honestly think Fatalpulse peaked at Victim Girls 1 through 5. His art has improved since then but the actual content of his stories has gotten just plain boring. He spends more time discussing how much inferior women are than focusing on the actual sex. I wish he got back to manga, Girls in The Frame was freaking amazing.<br><br>Algolagnia kinda has the same problem where reading his works feels more like a studying a manual on torture methods than porn you'd enjoy and fap to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have 14 tabs open. After I fap, I leave them open for when I'm ready to go at it again. Although sometimes I fap to the same doujin I fapped to previously.</br>  <br>Ive done that before but after a week or so I have 500+ tabs and firefox crashes</br>  <br> I thought for a second I was bordering CGRascal/Laruffi or something. <br>Bordering on Laruffi tier is more of a feat than anything. People would have to translate things horribly on purpose to match him.</br></br>  <br> Find 60 odd doujins that took a while to find ready to fap to for later <br> Go out somewhere for a few hours so I put PC into sleep mode <br> PC blue screens when I hit sleep mode </br></br></br>  <br>I have a certain time limit on those tabs. If X amount of days have passed without me having any sort of interest in that doujin, I close it. If the computer starts lagging, I must choose the least interesting doujins to close, which sometimes is a difficult choice.</br>  <br>Just restore your tabs unless you're in Incognito mode for some reason.</br>  <br>I just go left to right. I read until I fap or become disinterested (close tab). I always open new tabs all the way to the right if I see something interesting.</br>  Post your fav folder names.<br><br>I don't know why loli has its own category, I just never bothered to organize it</br></br>  <br> I'm always in Incognito because I don't like search bars adding every single piece of history to the autocorrect thing e.g. pressing Y should show youtube cos I favourited it but instead I would get some fucking random google search or accidental popup that just happened to have "Y" in the url <br> Also helps getting in sadpanda because no shit to deal with ever </br></br>  <br>Tier 3<br>Tier 2<br>Tier 1<br>Needs to be put in a tier<br>Ongoing<br>Needs translation<br>Backlog<br>Flavor of the month<br><br>They're not in English so I'll just post them like this, 920 galleries.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  what's a good lubricant to buy for fapping? I don't usually need it because I have foreskin but when I have like 5 hour edging sessions sometimes the skin on my dick gets a bit exhausted  <br> running out of favorite spaces <br>this is truly suffering</br></br>  <br> tfw still remember the joy from when you went to your favourites and had 1k slots instead of 500 <br>Soon it's time to start sorting out the "ok tier" stuff again.</br></br>  <br>I use a bar of dove soap and my spit.</br>  <br>the one with "'sup Mugi"</br>  <br>I have a lot of shit to sort.</br>  <br>Jesus fuck.</br>  <br>I had to take the plunge.</br>  How often do you fap?  <br>About 5-6 hours every day.</br>  <br>excuse me kind sir, i am what is refered to as a newfag, may I please have some insght on why these links dont work for me</br>    <br><br>It's pretty much just Hitomi these days, or maybe Nadina and Velba.</br></br>  <br>Ryuuta</br>  <br>At least once every 2 days, 3~4 hours each day on weekends,</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/827149/45ecb7<wbr>a7b3/</wbr>  <br> Those breasts look good. <br><br><br>I'm not sure but it was recent, it was a emotionless sex JAV with mostly breast groping.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is relevant to my fetishes. Why all that butthurt on the comments though?</br>  <br>Enjoy your anguish over losing your favorites when the galleries are purged for some reason or another.</br>  <br>That already happened, but then I still can see the thumbnail and name.</br>  I prefer nhentai over exhentai now. Ex hasn't been the same since the crack down and hardly have shit anymore, nhentai aslo has mega links instead of the torrent links that get taken down by exhentai and get lost forever.  <br>That fucker doesn't care anymore, this translator drama is ridiculous.</br>  <br> resized leeched content. </br>  <br>Drama is the lifeblood of fan work.</br>  <br>This reads like one of those shitty testimonials you hear on commercials for those "as-seen-on-TV" products.</br>  <br>I guess you prefer bloated file sizes in general, don't you?</br>  <br>better than no content</br>  <br>Thank you anon. <br>It simply isn't a proper sadpanda thread until there are accusations of shilling.</br></br>  <br>You could go elsewhere and get the full res files.<br>Did you know that sites exist outside of aggregators?<br>It's true!<br>Simply admit that quality isn't a concern at all to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you prefer Deadfish in general, don't you?</br>  <br>What other sites? I go to the scanlators sites to DL the files anyways. I wouldn't even know whose doing the translations, because they are even up on shitty exhentai.</br>  <br> hardly have shit anymore <br>They have almost literally everything aside from wani stuff. Do you only read wani manga?</br></br>  <br>yeah, because they have the best art and I love big tits. My other fetishes don't get as frequent of translations.</br>  <br><br><br>Get session manager. Never leave the house again.</br></br></br>  <br>I have it, but I rarely use it for saving ExHentai tabs.</br>  So something that's pretty hard to search for. Story focused adult. Stuff that's more to read than fap to. Anyone got anything?<br><br>I'd have to link to webcomics (often dead ones) like Sexylosers.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> doing this many contortions simply only do streaming </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and when you go back to look at them later, they've been expunged.</br>  <br>Just get the addon that auto redirects expunged galleries to nh.</br>  Anyone recognize this? My efforts to source it have thus far been in vain.  <br>'You'll be able to upload and edit galleries soon.'<br>When this feature will be available on nhentai, it could be better than exhentai.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/642168/1771e3<wbr>ccb3/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/771885/7aa593<wbr>ed96/</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Looks like Iona, but it's probably not her.</br>  Does anybody else have issues with exlinks crashing java and making firefox lag?  <br>Never, because that isn't the purpose of nhentai.</br>  If you were Yamcha what would you do today?  die  <br>Go home and get a real fucking job. Little faggot still tries to play chuuni with his friends like it's Dragon Ball, even though his bitch was already stolen by the same guy that tried to blow up the earth. Damn, it sucks being Yamcha. I'd just go back to being a bandit.</br>  <br>get blown</br>  <br>I would not be Anthony Burch.</br>  <br>What he did when he stopped training.Become a famous athlete,get money,pussy and cocaine</br>  Get NTRd as always.  <br>Start to profit my surhuman power to gain money, of course. Become famous sportsman, and swim in pussy</br>  <br>The sad part about him going out and using his skills to get rich is that he still gets lumped in with the other poor guys because his group of friends are made up of people that don't care about money and live tax free outside civilization or are so unbelievably rich that all the money he makes is less than pocket change.</br>  <br>Take some pride in knowing that i'm stronger than majoirty of the human race. Yet they feel the need to incult me cause I don't use my power on opponent's stronger than me in the hopes of seeing me beat up and mad cause I have common sense not to fight people who'd slaughter me in a heartbeat.</br>  <br>Get those Namekian to wish me to some paradise world. Nothing good comes from hanging around Earth and Goku too long.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qTg<wbr>z_jcddxs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Become someone's underling.</br>  <br>Masturbate.</br>  <br>play baseball, once im famous for playing pro-ball i can get any girl i want.<br><br>really the only thing that keeps yamucha from happiness is trying to be a Z-fighter</br></br></br>      <br>Answer a thread asking what would i do if I were myself today.</br>  Considering i'm the 5th or 4th strongest human on the planet (or single strongest human if we're talking about suddenly becoming Yamcha on our real planet) and can fly anywhere I want. I'd fuck bitches.<br><br>Bitches from anywhere I want and any age I want. Who the fuck could stop me?<br><br>I'd continue my baseball career and simultaneously be the single greatest batter and pitcher of all time. I'd make millions from my job and undoubtedly billions from my products. I'd enter record books, become a celeb and continue to fuck bitches.<br><br>When I'm done with baseball i'd become a runner and boxer and enter the Olympics. I'd be the single top runner and fighter for 20 years straight.<br><br>When I'm done and start turning grey, i'd retire from the world of sport and just fuck bitches for the remainder of my life.  NTRing many couples just to fill the hole in my heart left by Bulma </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Professional athlete. Maybe a winter sport cause I like them better.  Try to get into the movie industry  <br>Suck my own dick</br>  now now , i see some retards in here so i wanna make something clear . yamcha is the 4th strongest person in the earth. He can fly , He can focus his ki where ever he wants and he is even capable to use kamehameha so actually he can basically do everything in the earth get your facts right  <br>he couldn't even do that<br><br>in FnF when they sense freezer's energy bulma and krillin decide to call everyone because goku and vegeta are too far training with beerus <br><br>and they call everyone to battle, everyone except yamcha</br></br></br></br></br>  Throw Yamcha into the mix and I would not be so sure who the strongest of these five characters is (if we take Goku as Goku from the very beginning of the series).  <br>Play some Baseball.</br>  <br>DBZ Yamcha (during the fight with Nappa) was easily the strongest out of those characters, since he had a powerlevel of around 1500, I think.<br>Other than that, It is probably<br><br>Kid Goku &gt; Videl (post training) &gt; DB Yamcha &gt;= Mr. Satan &gt; Videl (pre training) &gt; young adult Chichi<br><br>Gohan said during his training that Videl had surpassed her father, which implies she was weaker than him beforehand.<br>We don't have much data on Chichi snce she did not really fight anyone seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Be an asshole. <br><br>For all intents and purposes I'm the strongest human alive. <br>I can just Ki blast my way through life and fly wherever I want. <br><br>None of this pussy "I'll get a nice paying job" shit. That takes up all my free time when I can just do whatever the fuck I want without the need for routine and money. <br><br>If I'm that desperate for money, I can rob a bank or mess around in UFC. <br><br>I am effectively superhuman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you not learn anything from all the stories were some strong person is being a dick?</br>  <br>Yeah, their hubris always comes back to bite them in the ass. <br><br>However, this isn't a fable with a moral. This is theoretically supposed to be real life. <br><br>Unless there are other superhumans around to stop me. I should be alright.</br></br></br></br></br>  Start destroying my political enemies, because I'd be the strongest being on this planet.  <br>Humans adapt incredibly quickly is what I'm saying. And you would not be indestructable.</br>  <br>Oh well. Even if they somehow manage to take me out, I'm alright with that. <br><br>I lived life how I wanted to. I'd be happy with whatever outcome happens.</br></br></br>  <br>Gohan said the second he met Videl that she was stronger than Mr. Satan when he saw her take out those criminals. She just didn't know because she never sparred with him because he's the champ.</br>  <br>Ah, okay, my bad then.</br>  <br> play baseball <br> get rich <br> fuck bitches <br> spent rest of my days playing video games and watch anime. </br></br></br></br>  <br>NTR is unforgivable. A Tienshinhan would arise to stop you.</br>  <br>Nothing important</br>  See if Launch is still single. If Tenshinhan ain't gonna hit it, Yamcha might as well try to scoop her up on the rebound.  i would take the capsule corp ship and fly out to space then proceed to make an energy ball so big that it destroys earth and kills everyone. no one will make fun of me on new namek because i will be the strongest one  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127266809 <br>WTF</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127266916 <br> Horse Ball Super <br>What does that even mean?</br></br>  I'd do the usual and get my ass kicked.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127266809 <br>wat</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127266809   <br>Be a cuck</br>  <br>I don't think Videl can be stronger than DB Yamcha. She's better than Mr. Satan and any other "normal" human in the world, but she's not at the superhuman level where they're immune to bullets and able to pick up cars and boulders (like Goku and Yamcha early in DB)</br>  <br>Was Yamcha able to lift cars and resist bullets? Been a while since I read Dragonball. I mean, he was just a normal human.</br>  <br>Get killed by the weakest villan of the arc.</br>  <br>I think he was unharmed by Mai's bullets at some point but I can't remember for sure. <br><br>He was able to put up a fight against Goku, and even though Goku was tired and hungry at the time, I don't think Yamcha could be that much weaker.</br></br></br>  <br>Hungry Goku is pretty weak, he got beaten pretty badly by one of King Pickle's children, but steamrolled him after eating something.<br><br>Maybe that was just a boost from being close to death though.</br></br></br>  <br>Mutenroshi can tank bullets just fine. He can snatch them from mid-air. Also they get hit by ki projections all the time, and we must suppose they hit harder than bullets. And I don't think strength is a problem either, because Krilin at age 14 was already able to push that giant-ass boulder.<br><br>Nah the power up from death shit wasn't thought up yet, I think.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah the power up from death shit wasn't thought up yet, I think. <br>It was though. Goku often gets a powerup after fights in Dragonball long before it is explained, which is then retroactively explained when the ability is brought up by Vegeta on Namek.</br></br>  Rape the ever loving shit out of Bulma and take her to my basement to be my sex slave for the rest of her life  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127266809 <br>And it's still up, folks.</br>  <br>it all depends on what time frame you're talking about<br>if you're talking Buu Saga Satan, he's actually pretty weak, as he's past his prime. Cell Saga Satan vs Pre-ki videl vs first tournament Goku vs post DB chichi would be a pretty close match, but honestly, Chichi and Videl would both be able to win against Goku or Satan. But Chichi isn't able to take a punch of that level.<br>So yeah, Videl probably</br></br></br>  <br>Watch vegeta fuck my wife and die again to a saibaman</br>  <br>Forget baseball, this is what I'd do<br> Fight Mr Satan <br> Win <br> Become hero and champion to the whole world <br> Be rich and famous forever because none of the Z-Warrior will bother challenging you </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> none of the Z-Warrior will bother challenging you <br>Android 18 would probably threaten to take your title and get a cut of your money like she did with Mr Satan, but you'd be so rich and famous and have so many women that you wouldn't care</br></br>  Daily reminder that you'll never get your boipussy violated by the Vice Prez ominous futadick.<br><br>Why live /a/ ?<br><br>Also, 181 when ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're too weak to get violated, anon.</br>  <br>181 here http://yomanga.net/series/Prison-Sc<wbr>hool/chapters/181/1.php</wbr></br>  <br>I love you anon</br>  <br>what the fug, 181? where was 180?</br>  <br>http://mangatopia.net/main/<br>Here anon.

To win the cavalry battle against the USC, and at this moment she is absolutely sure that she will.<br>And here comes Andres hidden investment, if he were to lose on purpose during the battle Emo girl will feel only pure genuine hate against him and punish him, genuine hate is exactly what will satisfie his masochist needs.<br><br>Now I am going to tell you how the next chapters are going to be, everyone tries to get the old Meiko back but no matter how hard they try they can't do it.<br>All will seem to be lost and the boys and the USC accept their defeat just when Andre decides to get his profit.<br>USC win the battle that way and remain, Andre will egt exactly what he wants, almost everyone wins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want her so punish me so bad.</br>  <br>You can hire 3D domme, they're all sweaty and cowtits PD like Meiko.</br>    <br>I understand Anon. I want it so bad too</br>  <br>Is this reference to new Dbz movie?</br>  <br>Feels bad mang.</br>  <br>How shitty is this going to be?</br>  what is good about this manga?  Is spinning around the right answer? Was Pauli's theory right?  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Yeah, it was a pretty weird disconnect. It seems like Watari didn't know where he wanted to take Yukino after making it so she could finally accept help and act independently, so he just had her regressed to pad out the story.</br>  <br>She must live a pretty lonely life to want to hang out and scare the shit out of teenagers all day.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qhq<wbr>nvaq6BwA</wbr>  [ ]<br>play this song while watching this gif<br>someone make this 1 hour long</br></br>  Can someone explain what the fuck this is?  So where the fuck was she?  <br><br>auditioning for sao, she got sick of beta kirito</br></br>  <br>Bell is op enough to one shot goliat. She mostlt is not needed.</br>  Out of the dungeon.  <br>oh shit, she left like 2 days before didn't she? I can't believe I forgot that</br>  <br>Freyja also not present i'm dissapointed. It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean. Ryuu cannot even scratch goliat let alone killed it. So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards. She is completely dependent.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material.</br>  <br>Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag.</br>  <br>Scrap this i missed the ending scenes.</br>  <br> literally 4 to 5 better looking girls in the same show <br> ''hurr everyone should like Hestia'' </br></br>  <br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a single better better than Bestia Hestia.<br><br>That's right, you can't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They killed Goliath at the 17th floor and went up.</br>  <br>Bell is shit compared to her, she dealt most of the damages with her magic, Bell could charge Argonaut because he was protected, and his allies had done most of the work.</br>  <br>No, have you even seen the anime bell completely obliterated goliath with itd full powered regen still intact. Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull. The flesh is its shield.</br>  Smelling her armpits in the corner  The sexual tension between these two is unbearable. Can anyone spoil me when will they fuck in the novels?  <br>One brings the toys, the other brings the beer</br>  <br> sexual tension <br><br>They're both straight, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Straights is nonexistent species in the anime world.</br>  <br><br>And one of them is elf, so it doesn't count as straight or homo.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/hegame/status/6<wbr>14474394509799424<br><br>Anime producer, editor, and LN twitter account making bait post about animating Oratoria.</br></br></wbr>  Does anyone have a quoted version of the incantation they were saying in full?  <br>Adhd avatar. ...nice</br>  this shit is so bad it's not even funny<br><br>i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people</br></br>  <br> i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people <br>You haven't read Zhan Long where the chinese MC university student takes on roughly 20 elite usa special forces and wins by killing most of them and taking the others prisoner for interrogation. The MC even does better in the game. Unlike a lot of other stories, this MC also has a lot of patriotic power leveling activity outside the game.</br></br>  <br> implying you know what the author hasn't explicitly explained </br>  <br>Just like every anime ever right? Fuck off.</br>  Surprised they didn't show Freya either, I still liked the ending but it really needs a sequel.  So how exactly does Argonaut work? Assuming it isn't a chargeable "I win" button  <br>Not really an "I win" attack, but it is basically a charge based on desire to win/time that significantly boosts his attack power, balanced by an extremely long cooldown.<br><br>In terms of adventurer abilities, it's not hugely impressive, but it definitely has utility.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a charge, but not I win.<br><br>The one he used against Argonaut took 3 minutes of charge up time, which for all intents and purposes are too long to be worthwhile in most fights. When he went against the Goliath in volume 8 again, without Ryu and Asufi, they can't do shit against the boss (which is only Level 4 compared to this one) and was actually on the losing side. Argonaut has an insane drawback that is supposed to drain all your stamina, so he is a sitting duck for a while after using it (depending on the charge time).<br><br>It wasn't until Tsubaki (Level 5) came that they could win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one he used against Argonaut <br>The one he used against Goliath***</br></br>  <br> not hugely impressive <br> let him one shot a level 5 area boss just after turning level 2 </br></br>  <br>I thought the point was his first shot did jack shit? <br>And even after the rest of the group did their shit his second shot wasn't enough to finish it. <br><br>Didn't Aiz actually solo a level 5 boss by herself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>His first shot obliterated everything it hit. He just stupidly aimed at the head that quickly regenerated.<br><br>Isn't Aiz level 6 though?</br></br></br>  <br>Ryuu looks like she can solo a normal Goliath herself</br>  <br>Welf did more damage than Bell that fight.<br><br>Ryuu and Asfi were undisputed MVPs there though. <br><br>All Bell did was get the final hit, which in turn let him hog all the glory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. It didn't one shot the boss. The boss did not die after the hit, and was in the process of regenerating. If Bell wasn't quick thinking while everyone was retardedly going "oh no", it would've just come back.<br><br>2. If it was just Bell v. Goliath, or Bell with Welf and Lili v. Goliath, they all would've died. He only had the time to cast due to 2 Level 4's, another Level 2, and a strong magic item (along with every other adventurer on that floor) distracting the Goliath.<br><br>3. Compared to the other, higher level adventurers, it's a very unimpressive power, it's just an attack power boost, and those are a dime a dozen. Lefiya at Level 3 gets to break one of the rules of adventurers and can cast any number of magic spells, albeit with some restrictions. Most other adventurers are hard-capped at 3 spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever played Monster Hunter? Do you know how Great Swords work?<br><br>A full charged greatsword will outdamage weapons a bit above them and can do more damage in one swing. That's the Argonaut ability in a nutshell.<br><br>And Bell still didn't kill Goliath with it, just exposed the magic stone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. In a fight he'd be destroyed by any lvl 3+ adventurer, they have better stats and abilities. His nuke won't do shit since he wouldn't have time to charge it and even if he would, he'd probably never be able to hit them with it.</br>  <br><br>Is DanMachi an accurate depiction of Monster Hunter?</br></br>  <br>It's been already explained in the previous threads.<br><br>The boss has a regeneration ability that's based on its mana. So to kill it, first you have to drain the mana.<br><br>Even though it looked like it was regenerating all the time, at the same time its mana reserves were being depleted.<br><br>At the end when everyone used their strongest skill was when it took the largest hits to its mana pool, Welfs OP sword being the last straw.<br><br>All Bell did was the final blow at a point where the boss couldn't regenerate.<br><br>The crystal scene is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't when she did it, it's how she got to level 6.</br>  <br> fairlyoddparents.webm </br>  <br>Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom.</br>  <br>hestia.dance</br>  I just learned a Light Novel, is actually a Nirmal novel with a picture inserted every couple of pages. It's for writers that never found a Manga artist to team up with them  <br>I can barely imagine Bell defeating a Velocidrome.</br>  I love how these LNs with Gary Stu protagonists always have faggots coming out of the woodworks to defend the Gary Stu in detail, saying that the Gary Stu isn't asspulling, he's taking advantage of established mechanics.<br><br>Meanwhile it's clear to anyone that the Gary Stu is asspulling and the writer makes shit up as he goes.<br><br>Touma, Kirito, ONII-SAMA, Bell-kun, same shit different face</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck is it offline?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d5I<wbr>hpNYy5Dg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Please no. They already ruined one season. If they animate Oratoria too they'll probably find a way to give Hestia more screentime than Ais, on top of ruining all of Ais's scenes and design. Hasn't the author seen the BD sales?</br>  <br> Shoehorn more Hestia into Oratoria <br><br>I don't dislike Hestia, but that would be so completely retarded dear god please no,</br></br></br>  Finished the anime, does the light novel worth reading?<br>Does the anime skip a lot of thing?</br>  <br>They already did it to the main series. What makes you think they won't do it in Oratoria?<br><br>Not to mention they've flat out said that "we don't know how to animate/draw Ais". Why then would they think it would be a good idea for them to animate Oratoria, a series that is entirely focused on Ais? Fucking greedy incompetent cunts.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean someone should "shop" a cumshot on his teeth and add the brazzers logo.</br>  So glad I wasn't turned off by the series title.<br><br>Mmm...Vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Too poor.</br>  <br>No, it's weak only able to destroy the ripped head that has been attacked numerous time. It's uncomparable to bellmore than half body attack.</br>  <br>It did one shot the boss. He already obliterated it but Regen help him survive with few hp because the attack is not focused to the real core because it's hidden.</br>  <br>No, this the longest charge because the limit off and aimed attack. In reality argonout charge is very short even bell never like he charge anything when use it.</br>  <br> implying he is </br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Plot Armor is one hell of a defense.<br><br>Get real dumbass, "Beru-kun" is a piece of pure shit who gets powerups out the ass when his shitty friends lives are on the line. It's like he's pussy mode 24/7 until a big monster comes threatening MUH FRIEZENS</br></br></br>  <br> It did one shot the boss <br> Regen help him survive <br> He survived the attack, therefore he got one shot <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So where the fuck was she? <br>You missed TWO separate anime episodes where it was stated the Loki party was heading up and out from the dungeon. The analogy from elementary school is that your reading comprehension skills need improvement. Reading comprehension used to be taught in elementary school, but with the republican party "no child left behind" act, lots of courses were made much easier by teachers and school administrators in order for their schools to look good with high GPA and high graduation rates. The higher the GP and graduation rate, the bigger your salary is how the NCLB act sums up. <br><br>Due to the NCLB, it's no wonder your comprehension skills are lacking. Such skill training was moved out of elementary school into the high school realm as optional courses for AP students. I grew up in my area, had kids, and saw how those classes were moved in our school system thru the years since NCLB. NCLB was good for the good schools as they made even more money. But almost all other schools became worse because they watered down courses in order to keep their current level of federal funding or gain more funds.<br><br>I apologize to OP if "comprehension" training in school was not the cause of your problem. But I've seen so much comprehension problem between average students of my time period and today's average students and your question fit neatly into those symptoms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> son of mutherfucking Zeus <br>Yeah why the fuck is he so garystu?</br></br>  <br>This os not argonaut but limit off. Argonout charge is very shirt he one shot baby dragon without charging he also one kill 3 minos without passive move. His charging is as shory as he is chanting firebolt.</br>  <br>I'm getting real fucking sick of gay people.<br>Every fucking thread it's "I'm gay and everybody has to know lol"<br>Fucking faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu would slice him up before he could react.<br>Remember how Aiz was destroying him with just a scabbard without even trying?</br></br>  <br> Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag. <br><br>Ice cream has been made from human milk. With Hestia's breasts you can make a lot more ice cream than from Aiz. Furthermore, I bet Hestia's milky motherly flavour is a lot better than Aiz's lean flavour. <br><br>As to what ice cream names Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream company would give to ice creams made from Aiz or Hestia's goodness, I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best outfit</br>  <br>Well in anime the regen is still fully intact and full powered. So bell did one shot goliath to the half his body with its regen ability still strong.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>   Zeus is his grandfather <br> I'm so special <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>No, bell is stronger. This charge was not argonout. It's far stronger. Argonout not even need Him stand still and doing passive move. No bell is never charging anything have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br>If only it was just a meme.</br>  I really hope cute MCs become the next big thing.  <br> Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom. <br><br>It probably has been professionally done in japanese TV ads. Marketing may even insist on Bell having different types of big toothy smiles in various episodes to help the toothpaste marketing. Remember, Attack on Titan had such giant marketing that even bread shaped like titan footprints was marketed. Certainly, cleaning products were marketed due to Levi's cleaning habits.<br><br>It would be unbelievable to not have DanMachi toothpaste. I've already seen lots of toothpaste for everything from Sailor Moon to Totoro to My Little Pony. Franky Cola pepsi is allowed to have 1% alcohol in it to give it that Franky kick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell is still level 1 without argonaut and limit off and bell is not good fighting non monster because of his soft spot furthermore she is woman.</br>  <br> cute MCs <br><br>Oh please.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Bell-kun wasn't even that cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell and Aiz both drink alcohol (ale?) at Mama's tavern style restaurant, so Bell must be old enough to drink.</br>  <br><br> bell is not good fighting non monster <br><br>The arc that would have taken place after the anime ended is Bell fighting other adventurers. As is the arc after that, he's fairly capable in both though that's after getting even more Aiz training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He missed the core the real body because he doesn't know but when he knew it he one stab it. It's very large area attack but it's un aimed because the core is hidden.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>No, he is fighting it without any intention to kill. Like when he fought the hades head fighter. He doesn't use firebolt because he cannot control the damage and have big casualties</br>  <br> Attack eradicates the entire upper body down to the hips and exposes the gem, including the flesh on the opposite side of the gem from Bell. <br> A significant amount of the gem would've been in the path of Bell's attack <br> "Oh he didn't hit the gem with it" <br><br>Sure thing bro.<br><br>As retarded as that thought is, it's still more proof that Bell didn't one shot the Goliath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's un aimed attack at very large area. It would have been different or one shot f it's more focused or consentrated attack at spesific area or target.</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>He seemed not be pulling any punches during the Apollo duel, same with his big fight with Ishtar. He didn't want civilian casualties/damage, when he was running from Soma's group, but he'd still choose to use it in a pinch even though it cause property damage, and might have killed someone who couldn't flee from the now burning building.</br>  <br> Bell can aim and focus that attack <br> If it was more concentrated it would be more powerful <br> Flat-out making shit up to support your argument <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu.</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Of course he can control it. It's giant swing the core only got the damage from the far left corner attack not in the middke which is more powerful attack. Have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>He has soft spot like it's shown also in the latest episode</br>  If someone is interested.<br>Lossless creditless OP - https://mega.nz/#!7E0HTB7D!YC2yufSp<wbr>gylNmf3GrgAhZ7RsETDqoaKih2sJ6TQlBLk<wbr><br>Lossless creditless ED - https://mega.nz/#!KZUEBYZJ!DzahHwgu<wbr>2tq5nncbeFq53xlbWjiWI-QmzBnVmL-QK9E<wbr><br><br>I'm also uploading the first 2 episodes, single file, but it will take at last another 8 hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Find me one scene that shows the Goliath "only got the damage from the far left corner attack.<br><br>Find me one line that says "the middke which is more powerful attack".<br><br>Find me anything that says or shows Bell could've focused that attack to do more damage.<br><br>You have the episode, so go get some pictures and quotes that support your argument and come back.<br><br>Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up with your retarded assumptions and broken english.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone make a stitch of this shot yet?

He has not yet turned his back on me. But after this I'm starting to fear we're next.</br></br>  <br>It really won't. Turns out gay marriage doesn't really affect you unless you're gay yourself.<br>Religious elements might grow restless, but from what I understand American Christians already<br>have a bit of a persecution complex, so who knows if you'll even notice the difference.<br><br> Source: I've lived in a country that has allowed gay marriage/gay-marriage-in-all-but-na<wbr>me for decades. This has not affected my own life in the slightest.</wbr> <br><br><br>Christ, we really are /pol/ now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what about their children? did you think of the children anon?</br>    <br> Turns out gay marriage doesn't really affect you unless you're gay yourself <br> Turns out X doesn't really affect you unless you're Y <br>One of the worst ways to look at things.</br></br></br>  <br> 3% <br>which will do nothing<br><br>most of the world "problems" solve itself at 50% of the current population if the reduction is uniform, the trick is to do it non-violently and gradually</br></br></br></br>  I knew yuri would draw more /pol/ then ever now. <br>I don't care about this shit. I just want to enjoy cute things.</br>  <br>I still have my faith as well, but shit is getting dire by the bloody second<br>Heck, almost all of my country's higher education have fallen to the progressive shitters.</br></br>  I'm curious if a Hibike thread on /pol/ would work out better than this one.   Cacti   <br>What are they gonna do on the bed?</br>  <br>For instant thread derailment just add crunchy tweet</br>  <br>new pol sucks</br>  <br>I guess they're meant to be sitting on Kumiko's bed?</br>  <br>This is too gay</br>  <br> TFW is a recording of Taki's voice saying "Kousaka-san" over and over again </br>  <br>Oh, that's why Kumiko looks so anxious.</br>  <br>Is there actually any other couple in anime history which was so much baited in yuri direction in it's adaptation when their novel source counterparts were quite straight in comparison?<br><br>It's insane.<br><br>Kumiko just want to fuck Reina or be fucked by her right there in most of the pics, just look at her eyes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not of Taki breathing and snoring in his sleep </br>  <br>Then how should you look at things?</br>  <br> I have never watched any magical girl shows </br>  <br>And that will trigger Reina special mode into sexy time?</br>  <br> Implying magical girls aren't gay by default </br>  <br>If you don't like something that doesn't affect you, just pretend it affects you anyway, I guess.</br>      <br>when Reina gets dumped by Sensei will Kumiko share Shuichi with her?</br>  <br>But it does affect non-gay people in various ways. For one thing, it's not allowed anymore (e.g. it can get you fired) to voice contempt for gay people embracing their perversion and it's even become frowned upon if you extend a helping hand and try to cure them. It's unacceptable.</br>  <br>Why did KyoAni made them so blatantly gay?<br>What's the point?</br></br>  <br>are you new to anime or something? Illustrations like that have always been made even for shows with no yuribaiting at all</br>  <br>People like it.</br>  <br>Its usually more suggestive. Some of these promo art just seems too intimate for my taste.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the show.</br>  <br>literally free level pandering. It won't take them anywhere though,</br>  <br>Because </br>  <br>Free stuff is usually more colorful and less realistic.</br>  <br>Please keep them incoming</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  So Euphonium won't get a second season because of its average sales like Amagi.<br><br>Like every KyoAni show that isn't Haruhi, Euphonium will be forgotten like Amagi in a few months.</br></br>  /a/ - Bible Studies  <br>oops, meant to quote </br>  <br> average </br>  <br>I don't understand Japan. How does Euph do almost exactly as well as Amagi? Amagi was weird as fuck and honestly not very good. Euphonium blows it out of the water as far as writing and plot goes, but somehow it still hits the same level of success. I don't get it.</br>  <br><br>America gets dumber by the second</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's a good way to put. Neither the promo art nor their interactions in the show are necessarily that suggestive,<br>but a lot of it feels almost uncomfortably intimate. The small things Kumiko does - like the soft way she says Reina's name<br>or the way she looks at her - almost makes you feel like a voyeur when you watch it. Kyoani is really fucking good at baiting.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Barely breaking 5K not average. <br><br>You're joking right?</br></br></br>  <br>Amagi was great.</br>  <br>Every time Kumiko softly says "Reina" my dick twitches a tiny bit.</br>  <br>there's a difference though. Hibike! was turned into an anime because the staff liked it and they bought rights to make it into anime. Unlike Amagi and other LN adaptations who came to KyoAni to have it animated.<br><br>So if the staff wants to animate a second season, nothing is stopping them</br></br></br>  <br> It's real <br>what the fuck</br></br>  <br>Its 2015, cute high schoolers doing cute things doesn't sell like it used to. <br>They have to be boats and shit.</br></br>  <br>My anon can't be this retarded.</br>  <br>Not really. There are covers of them going to the onsen, sleeping together, bathing naked  although this is based on the ED ,so yeah less realistic   and going on "dates"</br>  <br>I don't like feeling like that. Its there moment, I don't want to interfere. Usually I like suggestive promo art but this is just something I don't want to stare at.</br>  <br> writing <br><br>Maybe if the show stopped Yuribaiting I would take the writing seriously.<br><br> plot <br><br>It had a plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe if the show stopped Yuribaiting <br>I guess yuribaiting has the reversed effect in the west.</br></br>  <br>Nah its different. These promo arts are too intimate and realistic compare to the free arts.</br>  <br> nothing is stopping them <br><br>Profit.</br></br></br>  <br> nothing is stopping them <br>Except for the fact they're still running a business and have to produce shows that sell.</br></br>  <br><br>Euphonium made a profit. It wasn't a huge success, but it wasn't a flop, either.</br></br>  <br> it's not allowed anymore (e.g. it can get you fired) to voice contempt for gay people embracing their perversion <br>Right. And the same thing would happen if you were to voice your contempt against e.g. blacks or women. Tough shit.<br> it's even become frowned upon if you extend a helping hand and try to cure them. <br>They clearly don't want your help. though.  Besides, doesn't that shit often result in mental trauma? <br><br>Why not just let them sin in peace? It's their damnation, not yours. I'll be the first to admit that I can't relate to any of this:<br>I've lived my entire life in a heavily secularised country. I just don't see why the inhabitants of "the Land of the Free" are so<br>obsessed with others' private lives.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I just want normal, non-transportation based cute girls doing cute things.</br>  <br>One of the rare times I thank God I don't live in USA</br>  <br>Perhaps I could interest you in some tanks?</br>  <br>When you base your life on pleasing an imaginary man in the sky, logic and reason tend to go out the window.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a strange kind of feeling. Makes you wonder what Kyoani could do if they tried their hands at a serious romance series.</br>  <br>Dude, really now?<br>Don't take the bait.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You're a bunch of pussies.<br>I want to barge in on them and make them give me a footjob together.<br>And I'm not even a footfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not gonna lie though I am tantalized by the idea of Bakuon.</br>  <br>I honestly wished they toned down the yuribait. Seriously make them act like they are with Hazuki and Midori or how they are in episode 12.</br>  <br>Free portrays an ideal world where you are both platonic best friends and soulmate lovers, that's why it's so colorful and dream-like in official arts.</br>  <br>I laughed at that honestly. I can't take it seriously. Also how can they hold their breath that long?</br>  why do pro gay people always strawman opposition as white conservative religious folk?<br><br>There are atheists, non-white, even homosexuals who oppose gay marriage on a legal/philosophical basis. And even religious types would rather use legal and philosophy over the bible</br></br>  <br>So they are one big orgy?</br>  <br>Now this is embarrassing. Please end your pathetic life.</br>  <br> sin <br> damnation <br> believing in a jewish zombie </br></br></br>  <br> And the same thing would happen if you were to voice your contempt against e.g. blacks or women. Tough shit. <br>But on the other hand nothing would happen if you were to demand that all straight white men should be killed. Progressives are a bunch of the worst fucking hypocrites one can ever meet. And for added irony, they like to call other people "bigots." It would be hilariously if it wasn't so damn sad.<br><br> Why not just let them sin in peace?  <br>They don't "sin in peace," they like marching parades through the cities, shove their perversion down everyone's throats, force it on impressionable young minds and then demanded marital benefits for it all. They're horrible people and should be treated like horrible people, and not like oppressed martyrs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I don't actually mind when a show manages to depict intimacy well (it's so rare), but it has gotten to the point where it's<br>affecting the quality of the story: It has completely overshadowed Kumiko's attraction to Shuichi, even though it's supposed to be <br>obvious enough that Kumiko's friends realise it. I genuinely wonder if they might just cut that sub-plot and leave them as friends.</br></br></br>  When did this become about politics?   waiting for FFF   <br> why do pro gay people always strawman opposition as white conservative religious folk? <br><br>Because fear-mongering is way more effective for getting what you want than appealing to reason. Especially if reason isn't even on your side.</br></br></br>  <br>/a/utism<br><br>A bunch of losers who never have stepped outside talking about shit they have no clue about</br></br></br>  <br>When the Supreme Court announced their OTP.</br>  <br>Sorry I triggered you.</br>  <br><br> shove their perversion down everyone's throats <br>What's your address anon? I've got some extra perversion to go around.</br></br></br>  <br>Define "that long". I can easily hold my breath underwater for over a minute.</br>  <br>They are high as fuck. I told you it's a beautiful gay dream world.</br>  <br>It really does overshadow the poor guy. He's really not that bad of a character, but the direction KyoAni went is questionable. Quite annoying in fact. In the novel the Kumiko and Reina relationship isn't even that important since Kumiko moves to the next girl who is going through stuff. Reina is pretty much only there when it concerns Taki and that's it. The anime on the other hand actually made both of them change and develop(Reina never apologize to Kaori or even cared of being the villian in the novel if I recall). <br><br>If there is another season you can bet they'll start promoting Oboe-chan with Kumiko.</br></br></br>   this fucking thread   <br> only one minute <br>3 minutes masterrace here</br></br>  <br>and Hibike is realistic?</br>  <br>After going so far with Reina, I doubt they'd just leave it at that and move on. She'll probably continue to be important to Kumiko's character development, and Mizore will get promoted with Nozomi.</br>  <br>Weekend threads are awful full of cancer and now fujo as usual.<br><br>Only Sunday late night threads are good</br></br></br>  <br>But it's Sunday already</br>  <br> good threads on /a/ <br> ever </br></br>  <br>Maybe? But whats the point Reina is only relevant with the Taki plot. Most of Kumiko's interactions are with Nozomi and Mizure right? It would be a bad move.</br>  <br> But on the other hand nothing would happen if you were to demand that all straight white men should be killed. <br>Well yeah, because that would be fucking absurd and no one would take you seriously.<br> They don't "sin in peace," they like marching parades through the cities, shove their perversion down everyone's throats <br>That's a counter-reaction to being marginalised, though. That shit doesn't happen much in countries where no one cares.<br> force it on impressionable young minds <br>I highly doubt being told that "being gay is okay" will make kids gay themselves, but admittedly I don't think anyone has actually done the research on that.<br> then demanded marital benefits for it all <br>Why shouldn't they? You can say that marriage benefits exist for the purpose of raising children, but that's clearly not the case as even the infertile can marry.<br>The other argument would be for religious reasons, but last time I checked, the American state is supposed to be secular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a sjw scum <br>people like you will be the first to get gassed</br></br>    <br> Most of Kumiko's interactions are with Nozomi and Mizure right <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  I want /pol/ to leave.  <br>Mizore.</br>  <br>Different is not the same thing as bad.</br>  <br><br>It'd be interesting to see what they'd do in a second season. I hope Hibike doesn't end its life in mediocre-sales-limbo. I don't know if a hypothetical sequel<br>would be a good idea, but I want to see how they deal with all of this.</br></br></br>  <br>This. They are obnoxious.</br>  <br>But SCOTUS personally invited us.</br>  <br>It's fairly realistic, yes. Definitely the most realistic of the season.</br>  <br>Its use of colors in those two arts is much more subdued than the vibrant, flamboyant colors in Free. Comparatively, I'd say yes and it fits Yamada's style.</br>  <br> I highly doubt being told that "being gay is okay" will make kids gay themselves, but admittedly I don't think anyone has actually done the research on that. <br>The idea is pretty absurd. Over here in the West, we've frowned on homosexuality for the last 1700 years, give or take a few decades. Yet homosexuals still exist. In Saudi Arabia and Iran, where they execute homosexuals, homosexuals still exist.<br><br>So if you can't make homosexuals heterosexual in such strict regimes and such anti-gay cultures, what makes you think you can do it the other way around? I'm pretty sure I'd still be straight if 97% of the world population was gay and gay relationships were the norm.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  I'm sorry. I'll stop responding to them. They're kinda funny, though. </br></br>  <br>We need more Natsuki fanart. I drew some of her napping at her desk but it was bad.</br>  <br>Post it anyways. Thread can't get any shittier, no matter how bad it is.</br>  <br>Maybe they'll promo Natsuki and Ribbon.</br>  <br>M-Maybe it's not that bad anon, you are just not this skilled yet</br>  <br>Since Americans ruin everything.</br>  america isn't white lmao  <br>That would be one way to fill the yuri quota. They wouldn't even have to do any baiting, since the second season is where they  "have a sit-up competition"  at camp.</br>  <br>UMAKU NARITAI</br>  <br>No it was real bad. I would've definitely posted it otherwise. I fucked up the angle of her head because I was trying to show her cute sleepy eyes and it got totally fucked.  I'll try again tonight though </br>  <br>Godspeed, drawfag. There is never enough Natsuki.</br>  <br>like any disease you need to keep gays continually in check or soon you'll have an epidemic<br><br>can't do nothing against isolated cases popping up time and again, but you can save the majority of your population if your dilligent<br><br>the proof is that saudia arabia and iran and the like still have morals where the united states only have continually spreading nihilism and perversions of all kinds</br></br></br></br></br>     all this filthy /pol/shit ITT     <br> if people say something I don't like it's muh /pol/ boogeyman </br>  Why do people think Euphonium will get a second season when it barley broke 5K in BD sales? I mean it didn't even sell more than Amagi and that series hasn't gotten a second season. And I doubt a second season would sell more than the first for Euphonium, would probably sell even less.  <br>Tamako and KnK sold significantly worse and they have MOVIES. There is no reason to think that sales would effect Hibike if it sold more.</br>  <br>The soviet subversion still going strong on the USA is proof that the west is done for.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T4Y<wbr>tgA2jnu4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It's not related to Hibike, let alone anime.</br>  <br>Maybe because being gay isn't a fetish but a sexual orientation.</br>  <br>Crunchyroll thinks different</br>  <br>Are you unironically this retarded?</br>  <br>No. When people say "Ribbons did nothing wrong", or "Asuka is worst girl", I don't blame /pol/.</br>  <br> Someone looked at Taki and thought "Yeah he's cute and all but I want to draw a picture of him taking a photograph of him showing his magnificent abs." <br><br>Artistic talent.</br></br></br>  <br>And gay shit is?</br>  <br>Fuck them and their cancer they brought here.</br>  <br>Deko/Nibu kind of sleep shot with Ribbons clinging to Natsuki when?</br>  <br>Then why didn't Amagi get a second season or a movie when it sold better than Euphonium?</br>  <br>Is this supposed to mean something or are you just shitting the thread for fun?</br>  <br> Not being able to distinguish opinions from /pol/shit <br/></br>  <br> Iran <br> the country with the most transgender surgeries per capita in the world </br></br>  <br>Unfortunately, it is tangentially related because of Kyoani's shitty baiting.</br>  <br>I like to fuck cats, is that an orientation too?</br>  <br>How am I retarded when I told you why would Euphonium get a second season if it sold less than Amagi.</br>  <br>We are doomed, aren't we? This will always happen since they will always pick up Kyoani shows.</br>  <br>KyoAni doesn't have any control over doing any further Amagi material, since Kadokawa holds the rights</br>  <br>Mizore/Kumiko promos when?</br>  why are they best girls?
