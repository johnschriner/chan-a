Haute couture is fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Couture translates literally from French as "dressmaking", but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit. Haute translates literally to "high". A haute couture garment is often made for a client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill that is allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> BOOYAH <br>it's not 2003 anymore grandpa</br></br>  <br>Dont make hit those showers.</br>  <br> raccoon <br><br> racoon <br>Raccoon Dog<br>Tanuki are a canid, related to foxes, wolves and anon's pet poodle.<br>The only thing they have in common with raccoons, is a dark mask around the eyes, and the fact that basic taxonomy isn't popular with subbers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> grandpa <br>He was pretty obviously 13.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> moeshit <br>Back to your Junjo Romantica containment thread</br></br>  <br>I seriously hope this is pasta or I'll label you a faggot right here and now.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute<wbr>_couture</wbr></br>  <br>Not enough buckets to catch the rainwater.

Don't sully NNB threads with your faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot Renge was in school in the first season so I was lost for the first few minutes.</br>  <br>I thought maybe she was in kindergarten in S1. I didn't understand it was a prequel until anons pointed it out.</br>    <br>Hotaru moving should have clued you in.</br>  <br> until anons pointed it out <br>Until Hotaru appeared, I might understand, but you had to have it pointed out to you?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I'm a little slow on the uptake.</br></br>  <br><br> Try F5 as well. </br></br>  <br>2nded<br><br>until the end</br></br></br>  Why does the NNB universe always shits on Hikage? She just wanted to be cool god dammit.  <br>Maybe she should stop trying so hard and being a braggart.</br>  <br>You want her to be cool? Fuck her. That way she can go home and brag about losing her virginity to all the innocent little country girls who will look up to her like a mature adult.</br>  <br> bragging about losing your virginity <br><br>no, that'd be komari</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be both. <br><br>Man, I wish I lived there.</br></br></br>  Why does she wear the mask?  <br>I've been reading alot of comments about this. Is this show subtlety meant to be dark? Or are people just trying to nit pick on everything which can support it being dark?</br>  <br>It is kind of dark at times.</br>  <br>it's not dark at all. posting edgy theories about NNB has become a meme at this point</br>  It's like show is trying to tell me that living in a rural area is great.  <br>Just like how other school anime tell you that you will have a harem when going into highschool.</br>    <br>It actually happens in Japanese highschools. The girls there all want to fuck antisocial nerds.</br>  <br>me neither, i forgot the entire season 1</br>  <br>Why does this happen?</br>  <br><br>Anon why don't you check it out and see for yourself? Also, it's spelled subtly. <br><br> and it's not dark at all, it's peaceful and beautiful and often genuinely funny. </br></br></br></br>  <br>My mind went blank when Hotaru talked about making friends</br>  <br>Natsumi pls</br>  <br><br>It doesn't, baka.</br></br>     OP by nano.RIPE <br><br>So funky</br></br>  <br>Good one.</br>  <br> mfw I didn't realize until the end </br>  <br>The story of my life.</br>  <br>Then where did the harem genre come from? It must have been influence by something.</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is way more subtle about it. <br><br>The girls don't repeat that they love that place and would never want to live anywhere else etc. like it happenes quite often in anime - Lagrange, Oorai. <br><br>It's just the place where they live their youth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you slow, anon? It was influenced by something alright. The universal fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds everywhere, (and specifically in Japan).</br></br>  <br>and where did the fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds came from? They must have been influenced by something as well.</br>  <br><br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean nope?</br>  <br><br>I mean I'll not be gently trolled any further. I clearly need to sleep.</br></br>  <br>I too won't be tricked any further, I'll just take  as fact and move on.</br>  Why are they so autistic?  <br>artistic?</br>  <br/>  <br>That's what happens when you grow up in an isolated rural area sorely lacking in other people your age to interact with.  I should know. </br>  Since when does CR put honorifics in their subs? Kind of an improvement.  <br>When the joke requires it.</br>  <br>I think it varies between shows, probably depends on the individual doing the translating, but I think I've been noticing them more.<br><br>except this whole episode used honorifics.</br></br></br>  <br>well it could have been "Ms. Renge," "Lady Renge," "Renge Your Majesty" or some bullshit. I can think of a few fansub groups who have done that kind of thing.</br>  <br>It varies hugely by show. They tend to keep them for shows set in Japan and drop them in fantasy/foreign settings or something.</br>  <br>Varies by audience. They know NNB is patrician shit so their viewers will understand basic stuff like honorifics and don't need to be spoonfed.</br>  <br>Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. You can't translate it.  Unless the -san is not standard in these ceremonies. </br>  <br>An actual patrician wouldn't need somebody else to tell him what people in his cartoon are saying.</br>    <br>plz no bully</br>  The marching in the OP is one of the cutest scenes I've ever seen  <br>Did Koma-chan go on a diet?</br>  Is this anime original? <br>When's Okinawa?</br>  <br>More importantly, did Hotaru put on weight? She looks even more deliciously plump than usual</br>  What is haute couture?  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>you almost got me there</br></br>    <br>She's such a spaz.</br>  <br>I didn't realize it until after I watched it, went on /a/ and someone mentioned it.</br>  <br>It took me till I saw Hotaru to realize. <br> tfw I made forum posts about it <br> tfw I didn't know if s2 would just be a repeat of s1 </br></br></br>  <br>It's a cute show with some dark commentary on the depopulation of Japanese countryside under the surface.</br>  <br> not going full pregnant </br>  <br>Official art is always so shitty.</br>  Why doesn't the sensei just take Ren-chan to school? Ren always wakes up earlier anyway.  <br>What would she do while she waited several hours for school to start?</br>  <br>Play around near the school. The same kind of things she always does when she's home.</br>  <br> play <br>What is this "play" you speak of ?</br></br>  Speaking like that is bad manners you rude little kid.  Watching this anime I can't help but raise a simple fundamental question<br><br>Why do they even live there in the first place?<br>No job opportunity<br>No entertainment<br>No civilization<br>No anything new whatever<br>And hell even no education opportunity for children. Just imagine how much will this kids have to miss in their youth for the sake of living in this nowhere shithole<br><br>Seriously, why do they do it? Is it a medieval age where they can't move to other place without the lord's permission?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>their parents are farmers</br>  On my tenth rewatch now.<br><br>This shit is addicting.</br></br>  <br><br>Dude in not even 10 minutes they can to other town/cities.<br><br>It's the same where I live.<br><br>In 5 minutes I can to other towns and in 10 to cities (and in 30 to the biggest city in the region)<br><br> Seriously, why do they do it? <br><br>Try to use your brain a little more, that's all I can recommend to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can go to tokyo if they want I guess, but the education and the jobs that they can get are OK.<br>The lack of males is a problem though.</br></br>  <br><br>Your world is so small m8.</br></br>  <br> The lack of males is a problem though. <br>There are many males in the village, they just aren't shown.</br></br>  <br> a rural Japanese town <br> single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br> can get to other town in 10 minues <br><br>I don't think so. The rural-ness of the town of NNB is simply beyond imagination. Can't even use a mobile phone? Holy shit<br><br><br>Not at all. What kind of facilities have you see in NNB beside that almost ran-down school and bloody farms beyond farms. Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level, /a/non, even worse than such place in  Wales </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ARE my methods... "unsound"? <br> I don't see any method at all, sir. </br></br>  <br><br> &gt;single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br><br>So? We don't even have that shit here.<br><br>What are cars, bikes etc.<br><br> I don't think so <br><br>Read the manga or keep watching the anime and see for yourself.<br><br> Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level <br><br>See pic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're right, all the farmers should live in cities and farm crops on thier lawn.</br></br>   expecting cute slice of life <br> this happens https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=44b<wbr>4Zxw6agg</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>fucking anime im done</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. <br>No one would use sama or dono either.</br></br>  Who is she talking to?  <br>Me.</br>  That little gasp, she's too adorable.  <br>This guy </br>  <br>I want to motorboat Komari's belly.</br>    <br>What will the kids miss out on? They have friends to play with, a school that will give them some education and they will probably learn what they need from their parents about farming.</br>  Anyone have fanart of grown up Renge-chon?   1st episode was a prequel <br> and it was Renchon's episode <br><br>Insta AOTS.</br></br></br>  <br>3/10 slightly funny</br>  <br>2spooky4me.</br>  <br>It's a private school. They don't have access to government money.</br>  <br>You worry somewhat about Hotarun, though. Her family is obviously educated and well-to-do, and I can't see them intending for her to be a farmer or to operate a tiny local shop. What's she going to do on her middle school and high school exams? She'd probably get sent back to the city before long.</br>  <br>Why worry about the worst girl?</br>  <br>Maybe her family has debts and ran away so they don't have to sell Hotarun to the Yakuza.</br>  <br>Ever heard of a housewife?</br>  I thought she was saying horticulture.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127776720 <br>Renge's not a crack baby though.</br>  <br>Where did she even learn that term?</br>  <br>Variety shows on TV or a stray magazine?</br>   Can say haute coture <br> Can't say Fancy </br>  <br>Look at this fag.<br><br><br>I can see her getting her MRS degree at college, but being a housewife to a bumpkin farmer in the middle of nowhere is a social dead-end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mispelled Komari</br>  <br>Someone's got to repopulate their countryside.</br>  What's Hotaru's Dad's job that they ended up in the sticks anyway? And they have a nice house so it probably pays well.  <br>She couldn't remember what the word was, dickhead.</br>  <br>He pimps out his wife and daughter to ugly fat farmers.</br>  <br>My case still stands.<br> Can remember haute coture <br> Can't remember fancy </br></br></br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>He's a yuppie and he moved out to the sticks to build a dungeon to imprison little girls.</br>  <br>Forgive her, she's autistic.</br>  <br>She's six.</br>  <br>That's called purity, anon.<br><br>Getto?</br></br></br>  <br>Ghetto?</br>  You will literally never ever have a happy, cozy childhood like hers, or live anywhere as comfy<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q3_<wbr>0YmqrkIA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>He watched too much NNB on TV.</br>  <br>He's in charge of closing down their village.</br>  <br>Probably an engineer or manager for one of the public utilities like the phones, transit or power.<br>And the transfer is a white lie for Hotaru's sake. He asked to be transferred in order to get Hotaru out of the city before she was raped or propositioned to be a gravure idol.</br></br>  <br>hika-nee, denwa</br>  My biggest question is why the school is so big if only 4 people assist to it, actually, why are only 4 people assisting to school to begin with? the town doesnt seem that small, and people fuck more in the woods, it should be at least a dozen or two  <br>doesn't japan have real low crime rates?</br>  <br>There used to be more people but they all moved out.</br>  <br>More like they all got old and didn't have enough kids.</br>  <br>That's an inevitable end.</br>  <br>Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Schools are shutting down all over the country because no one has any children</br>  <br>Never</br>  <br> in this nowhere shithole <br>You sure aren't from Russia. You know nothing about shitholes.</br></br>  <br> 21st Century <br> housewife <br><br>kek.gif<br><br>But that being said, I know there is a wide variety of economic condition among countries</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there's plenty of worse places to live like India, Syria, or Somalia. those places make Russia look like a heaven.</br>  <br>Not THAT low anon. Especially involving sex crimes. And Hotaru is a walking target.<br>And the thing is, Hotaru's parents could have cashed in and made a good bit of money, like the parents of the girl Hotaru is modeled after did when they signed her up to be a swimsuit model at 11.</br></br>  <br>Why is she always so sad?</br>  <br>She watched Kill la Kill.</br>  <br>Because her father does things to her</br>  <br> Especially involving sex crimes <br><br>Simply nope. Japan has one of the lowest crime rates ESPECIALLY involving sex crimes and is certainly the safest place for children, far safer than those countries condemning Japan for m-muh child porn, ironically</br></br></br>  <br><br>Japanese society has low REPORTED crime rates, due to ingrained social pressures and values. <br>You have to use your brain to examine the truth behind the numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>preteen and teenage idol videos are my antidrug<br><br><br>I bet you think black people don't deserve to be profiled and that you need to look behind the numbers to find out the truth</br></br></br></br>  <br> Japanese society has low REPORTED crime rates, due to ingrained social pressures and values. <br><br> Hrrdrr I somehow know all about UNREPORTED crimes! Don't ask me how I'm supposed to know something unreported though <br> Oh and yes every other countries on the Earth have 100% crime report rate so it's only Japan's problem! <br><br>What kind of stupidity is this?<br><br> You have to use your brain to examine the truth behind the numbers. <br><br>More like your fucking fantasy, yeah<br><br><br>Oh wait, am I replying to a bait?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   no cell phone service <br><br>what kind of backwoods town do they live in?</br></br>    <br>And to get her away from the people who make and buy those videos are why Hotaru's parents moved to the country. Whether the police consider it a threat or not, Hotaru's parents clearly did.</br>  <br>I remember you in a previous thread. The word you're looking for is "attend," not "assist to," ESL-kun.</br>  <br>Being a housewife/mother is still the main ambition of most azn women.</br>  <br>It was true until the late nineties but not nowadays.</br>  <br>She doesn't have any friends her age.</br>  For anyone interested I scanned some of the setting materials I got from S1 of NNB earlier<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/LMimQ#0</br></br>  <br>Less to do with backwards and more to do with the mountains all those families own.<br>They block cell phone signals and require a larger number of towers to provide service for the same surface area. And there are not enough people in that area to pay for the extra towers. If japan.gov doesn't pay for it, it won't get done.<br>Also, people like Renge's granddad who own mountains, want money from the telecom companies to put those towers on their land and build service roads to them. They consider the phone company to be a cash cow and demand astronomical sums for a lease.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Happens pretty often in regions with hills and mountains, you get little local dead spots everywhere. The cell sizes in rural areas are pretty large too, which makes things worse.</br></br>  <br>I'd do things to her too</br>  <br> women start to assert themselves more in the workforce <br> economy crashes and goes into a perpetual recession as a result </br></br>  <br>If Japan.gov was really concerned about their rural communities, that is the first thing that they should fix. Extend modern telecom services to the declining rural areas and subsidize them until the user base catches up. Because even if a business was eager to move into the countryside, it is not able to with cell phone holes and no 4G support for smartphones. No one anymore is going to move a office or plant out to a town that suffers from those conditions.</br>  <br>Japan has a low reported crime rate.</br>  <br> women start to assert themselves more in the workforce <br> economy crashes and goes into a perpetual recession as a result <br><br>What kind of weed are you smoking?</br></br></br></br>    <br>What kind of things?</br>  <br>Yet has to have women only carriages on inter city rail lines...</br>  <br>It goes hand-in-hand so yeah, crime rate is low in Japan. Just look at all these videos on Youtube about daily life in Japan.</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>how fucking retarded are you?</br>  <br><br> Trying to lure "Healing anime" viewers to watching a "loli gets mutilated the animee" <br>What kind of monster are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually most of Japanese women still have kids, they just rarely have more than one.</br>  <br><br> what is a joke </br></br>  <br>Why would it matter?

If they'd stop offing their babies, the population would stabilize in around a decade.</br>  <br>This is cool, thank you.</br>  <br>You mean like  letting her stay up past her bedtime ?</br>    <br>The darkness is only in your head.</br>  <br>its a typical example of what happens when a society embraces the modern western ideal of women following education and careers early in life and to settle down with a family later in life, only without the additional promiscuity and social decline, largely because of still endemic cultural conservatism and a lack of third world immigration</br>  <br>You're thinking of China. Japan's abortion rate is probably high but not so different than Northern Europe.</br>  <br>its just a meme but there are some sort of dark scenes in the show but its just what kids talk about every now and then<br><br>like the scene where Natsumi wonders that since ghosts arent real what happens after you die</br></br></br>  Why is Renge so genuinely sexy?  <br> tfw I have no cellphone </br>  <br> has to have <br>You don't know that.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, but I want to marry her.</br>  <br> What kind of stupidity is this? <br>Pretty simple, it's the kind of "another country can't do something better than the place I'm living in" stupidity.</br></br>  Did Nii-chan sing the school song?  <br>409568540 hours in GIMP</br>  <br>He played the piano.</br>  <br>Google chikan.

Manga endings that made you glad you read the whole thing.      <br>Ah so we're posting the opposite of satisfying endings.</br>  <br>Naruto</br>     Mx0 <br> axed <br> satisfying ending </br></br>  Needless 2 fucking when, Kami?        Houshin Engi left me pretty damn satisfied.        Manga &gt; Anime &gt; Movie.     Too bad everything written after was complete horseshit.    <br>Best one in this thread.</br>        <br>And from the epilogue.</br>  Umi no Misaki gets bonus points for having a great ending that was also a harem end.  This thread made me cry because I realized I've never once read a manga ending I was completely satisfied with.  <br>That was good, but I think that if it had ended a chapter before it would have been better.</br>  <br> equal screentime for three main girls <br> bonus loli reincarnation <br> obvious main girl who the manga is named after doesn't win (on her own) <br>Actually amazing.</br></br></br></br>    Berserk      <br>Totally agreed with you anon.</br>  <br>agree, i love the ending<br><br><br>The first three volumes Umi no Misaki are some of my favorite stuff, ever. Good ending.</br></br></br></br>  i know they screwed that ending in Last Order    oh my balls had a good ending.    <br>Fuuuuuck youuuuuuuu. I managed to finally forget how shafted Mx0 was. Meanwhile, shitty moe nonsense thrives. There is no loving mango god.</br>  <br>10/10<br><br>Right there son.</br></br></br>  Now, I might totally be alone in this, but I really liked the ending to Shigurui. I really enjoyed how the final attack between the two swordsmen was the same attack as the first time they clashed. It was really neat to see and hype as all shit. I guess otherwise, I was pretty satisfied with the ending of Change123 for what ever that means.  Gash Bell was flawless<br><br>A shame the anime never went all the way</br></br>    <br>Fucking seconded</br>    <br>And then that shitty sequel happened and ruined the entire sentiment of the original.</br>  <br>Didn't even know there was a sequel. Thanks for the warning, I'll pretend it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>The Akagi animu<br><br>Manga on the otherhand is completely insane.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura is dead. (not really he is just dead to me)</br>  In my opinion, it's quite satisfying.    <br>is he dead?</br>  <br>Nah, the sequel is good. You just have shit taste.<br>Granted it would have been better to have it feature an original character instead of Kurosawa, but the existence of the sequel literally doesn't take anything away from the message of the original.<br>This scene isn't even the ending anyway.</br></br></br>      <br>full metal panic?</br>  <br>Is that full metal panic? That guy looks exactly like sosuke</br>  <br>Damn right.<br>Pic related also had a pretty satisfying conclusion, all things considered.</br></br>    I love endings where the character walk away like pic related.  <br><br>If you haven't gotten around to it, read the Sigma manga. It's definitely worth it since, unless you can read Japanese, it's the only way to finish the series after The Second Raid.</br></br>  <br><br>Steel Ball Mind.</br></br>  <br><br> he later died of a cold </br></br>  <br><br>I just finished that about 30 minutes ago, I thought I'd be crying or depressed, but all I have is a melancholic smile on my face.</br></br>  based best girl  <br>Well it implies that life goes on instead of simply cease to move forward<br><br><br>Mah nigga</br></br></br></br>  I was extremly satisfied with the ending of Gantz.  onanie master kurosawa    <br>the ending was good but the last game was absolute garbage.<br><br><br>Never been so moved by such a short and over the top manga.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Bittersweet ending's are really good when the next best option is a tragedy.</br>  <br>A very satisfying and well thought-out conclusion</br>  I still wanted more but I was alright with it ending.<br><br><br><br>I usually avoid sports-manga like the plague but damn I'm so glad I read this one. The art is amazing.</br></br></br></br>        <br>Sports manga is such a loose term, its ridiculous to call KKNH a sports manga.</br>  <br>Does someone have the Bakuman edit where the Editor says "Mx0 and Double Arts were less interesting than Naruto so we had to cancel them"?</br>  <br>I feel like I recognise this.<br><br>what series?</br></br></br>    <br>That one about an interoverted mountain climber. Think it was base on a real story</br>    <br>Nevermind I found it</br>  <br> he actually died <br>This was such a shitty manga (dropped it I don't remember when) but apparently it concluded with a 10/10 ending.</br></br>  Really? Nobody?<br><br>It was a perfect ending. They brought every plot thread to a close and managed to make the epilogue concise but not feel rushed, so you get closure for everyone.</br></br>  <br>I know, it's usually the competitve ball-sports manga I dislike. Which is why I gave that manga a chance.</br>  <br> You will never be a member of a retired superhero team, now content to relax with your waifu and other hero bros with the knowledge that you saved Earth </br>  <br> Really? Nobody? </br>    <br>I read a few chapters, I thought he was going to end up with the redhead bitch</br>    <br>I rally liked it, There was times when everything was too cute for me, but I accidentally the whole manga.</br>  I really wanted more but I guess the ending was satisfying. It didn't feel rushed either since it was just a SoL  <br>Oi oi, don't joke like that...</br>  Jokes aside, my favorites endings were Shin Angyo Onshi, GTO, PunPun , The world only knows and the more I read I realize that a good manga doesn't necessarily need over one thousand chapters.    <br>Huh? The readhead girl isn't even in the first few volumes.</br>  <br>No wait, ignore that, I suck dicks. You are of course referring to the OTP.</br>    I had to recheck my files this had good endings:<br>Apollos Song<br>The Voynich Hotel<br>Fraken Fran <br>A girl by the Sea <br>Ping Pong<br>Parasite<br>Planetes<br>YKK<br>Sundome, but this one took a while to digest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Franken Fran <br>I don't remember that having much of an ending. Not that it needed one, really.</br></br>    <br>gotta have that trap booty</br>  <br>You finally did it. But still in line with the thread, i mean, no loose ends.</br>    One cant ever expect a good ending nowadays, most of the time one will keep reading even shitty manga and the reason is very simple.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>just found it you fucking fuck<br>don't be a shit</br></br>      <br>he comes back and they get together.<br><br><br><br>I saw only people being upset at that ending and it made me glad I dropped it.<br><br>Here's another satisfying one.<br><br>Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a good story.  It was sad to see it end the way it did, but I really, really, really enjoyed Binbougami Ga!'s ending.    <br> Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever. <br>Honestly, even if they end up separated it's still quite a nice story.<br><br>He grew from his worthless otaku scum self to be a better person, the romance is just a part of that progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in the end, nothing actually mattered and she got away with it. <br><br>Just awful.</br></br></br>  <br/>   <br>I got to say even though the final arc was shitty (part from kanchome and the golden book) I cried like a bitch when this happened</br>  <br>*apart</br>  <br>Ending, along with the entire last arc, was fucking shit<br><br><br><br><br>You best be trolling</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RIS doesn't work for me.</br>  <br> Fraken Fran <br> Good ending </br></br>  <br> Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a same story <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  The ending of the manga was even happier and more fulfilling than the animu  <br>Both endings were garbage</br>   tfw your waifu will never be your right hand   <br> everyone becomes a god in the final battle <br><br>This annoyed me because of the sheer amount of shonen-y it was.</br></br></br>  <br> The Voynich Hotel <br>Sayman can pump out some satisfying endings. Nickelodeon had some good shit at the end too.</br></br>  <br>Came here to post this. An old man with a puppet shouldn't be able to teach so many life lessons and make you feel so much.</br>  literally 10/10 perfect as a flower  <br>I'm still fucking puzzled as to how he was allowed to do that, but it was fucking great.</br>  The best love story ever told.  Just finished Homunculus and I'm glad I read it.  <br>I liked it better than ichi the killer</br>  <br>I'll give that one a try if it's by the same author.</br>  <br>less metaphors more gore porn coincidentally it also had a stratifying ending</br>    I think this one had a nice pacing and handled out the "drama" nicely enough, AKA in a way that does not make one go nuts.        <br>what is the moral?</br>  <br>Having a "big realization" moment wont suddenly fix everything.</br>  <br>looks familiar, is this from the mayo chicken?</br>    <br>We now bring you Miura's new work: Loli and Gorilla</br>  <br>but there's no way her piss heals right</br>  <br>this</br>      <br>The secret is that she tricked him into thinking her piss is a cure-all, and since he's an idiot, every time he gets hurt he wrings her like a lemon into his mouth. Shes just a fetish pervert.</br>  <br> Meanwhile, shitty moe nonsense thrives <br><br>Mx0 made a lot of use of moe too. Moe isn't your enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>The only chapter I remember the most is the sidekick magnet guy's dream test where he's in a harem.</br>  <br><br>Fullmetal Alchemist has one of the most satisfying Manga endings of all time.</br></br>  <br>Shamo's ending was thematically perfect i loved it.</br>  <br><br>This manga and Holyland were both fantastic.</br></br>  <br>Just finished that 2 weeks ago. Really great read. The last climb was especially exciting because of the larger consequences. I'm just glad towards the end he found his happiness in both family and mountains.</br>  <br>It sure does, Kanye-san</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I've been keeping with the series monthy since chapter 26, literally years of build up to the finale and it was all spectacular.</br></br>  <br>When the lyrics to Amazing Grace appeared I knew it was solidly in my top 10 manga list.</br>  Depressing manga but good ending. 10/10 Revenge  <br>I liked the ending to this. Pic related wasn't the ending but I just like looking at this scene. <br><br><br>my favorite jojo ending</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the brother of the Mc and the goddess saved this manga.  <br>and of course I forgot the pic <br><br>I also really like the ending to onani master kurosawa, slam dunk, and the original dragon ball. Goku outperforming "god" the creator of the dragon balls, finally winning the tournament and to be married soon. Much better the shitty Z ending.</br></br></br>  <br>I appreciated how the manga showed his loneliness. It was much better then say naruto. 8000 flashbacks of him on that stupid swing, and then he suddenly becomes friends with everyone. And even then with other flashbacks it clearly showed he had friends.  sorry to go on a tangent I just really dislike naruto. But I do think the ending was sort of satisfying. With him finally becoming hokage after a long read and all </br>  <br><br>That's because shonen is meant for little boys to read while seinen is targeted to young adults.</br></br>    Endings where all of the enemies and allies of the series come together are fantastic for me  <br><br><br>Ya'll missed out on reading this manga without this perfection in the background. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9<wbr>qvauLlmo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Shit gives me chills and now every time I listen to that song I remember lonely ass Buntarou struggling on a cold mountain and not Interstellar. A good intrumental really enhances the experience its incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No luck for me.<br> Sauce? </br></br>  So do we all agree that Kokuo no Hito is one of the best manga of all time?  <br>Isn't the scanlation still not caught up?<br>Talk about spoilers. /a/ was all over this months ago.</br></br>  Couldn't have ended better imo  Suzuka had a pretty good ending!<br><br>well untill, you know. trucks.</br></br>    <br>I can't find the source and I don't wanna be a saucefag, is this a Kiyohiko manga? Looks similar to Yotsuba</br>  <br>A cautionary tale of the dangers of unlicensed hypnotism.</br>  <br>*Kiyohiko Azuma</br>  part V will always be my favorite.  <br><br>that belongs in a series ruined by their sequels thread, like eureka 7</br></br>  <br> Those eyes <br>Greatest running joke.</br></br>    <br>Man, I don't even want to finish that manga after cellphone girl  became god . That multiverse shit was exhausting.</br>  <br>This is mayo chicken.</br>  <br>I still can't believe he dropped Sumire-17, though. The love triangle was kinda fun.<br><br>Not to mention those girls are from 17, which kinda implies 16 is a prequel.</br></br></br>  <br>Soon, Gintama will end.<br>What a beautiful ending it will be</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to make me cry</br>  The whole final chapter was just perfect.  The manga's ending was better than the anime's by an order of magnitude.  <br>Im literally hold off reading/watching so my old friend Gin doesnt break my heart.</br>  <br>Prunus Girl <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>    Underrated ending.  <br>i wasn't satisified, we never got to see some trap dick</br>  <br>only thing mashima did that was moderately ok and maybe the first few arcs of fairy shit</br>  <br>There are no beginnings or ends young one. The author needs rest after finishing a manga, but will eventually wake from his slumber and begin the next one. Like an eternal Phoenix dying and rising from the ashes, as long as there's spirit in the hand that hold the pen the flames of passion will never die.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br> we will never get a redo of the anime <br> Viz will never finish publishing the manga <br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The final beat down is my favorite in the series. </br>  <br>Finally some posted this one</br>  Has this been posted yet?<br><br>Greatest Magic Girlfriend series ever.</br></br>  <br>what are you talking about, someone already posted it before</br>  The ending fitted it very well  <br> this ending <br> this entire manga <br>I wish there was a short sequel</br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Akumetsu's ending way more.</br></br>    <br>At this point I would accept a new chapter of Gigantomakhia as a (lesser) substitute to Berserk. Just let us know you're still alive, Miura!</br>  <br>now that's a blast from the past. I remember reading that 8 years ago</br>  <br>Statist please. You fuckers would have me paying for a breathing license.</br>  <br>What a disgusting double entendre.</br>  Fuck you guys for not saying this master piece. Love inuyasha  <br>Fucking this. The ending was the perfect mixture of him finally getting a happy normal life and also getting slightly fucked up go almost abandoning it. I knew he would choose to climb, but I was still mad about it which split me on wanting to see him make it back or to die on the mountain.</br>  <br> magic <br><br>It's a gost uncultured shit</br></br></br>  Still my favorite after 8 years.  <br>The only manga where I was satisfied with the ending was record of a fallen vampire.</br>  Ended just like it started.  <br>Hated this. What a copout.</br>  I know it's not over, but if this had been the ending I wouldn't have been mad.  <br>I almost forgot this existed.</br>  <br>Too Calvin and Hobbes. The whole childhood soldiers on into the big wide world thing has already been done perfectly.</br>  <br>You would have the transgendered planting inappropriate ideas into young minds.</br>  10/10 manga with 10/10 ending  <br>I liked the ending of the novelization better.</br>  It may not have been very long, but Koisome Momiji was fantastic for it's entire run, and the ending was no exception.  <br> mangafox <br>Why do you do this to yourself?</br></br>  Inb4 some faggot says they broke up in real life again.  <br><br>I think I'm the only person in the entire planet who didn't like this manga.</br></br>  <br>Magic girlfriend is a genre. They don't have to be literal maho shoujos.</br>  <br>Fucking this</br>    <br>I know /a/ wont admit this but its naruto</br>  I honestly cried at the end.<br><br><br>My nigger.<br>Truly a great ending.<br><br>They're happy together but you know it won't last.<br>I love how it's not a 'now they'll be happy together forever' like most romances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the ending for Shigurui was very good.<br>It ended perfectly, without any glamour or excitement, the fight being shit, no one watching understanding the history between those two samurai and it ends with the victor losing everything he had.<br><br>The ending simply reinforced the theme even more.</br></br></br></br>  The only way it could have ended  <br>oh so it's that kind of thread</br>  And the sweetest ending  <br>Everyone was glad that pile of shit finally ended.</br>  <br>that was pretty depressing, though<br> despite the relentless spirit of man, entropy is inevitable </br></br>  <br>no, its by the guy who did silver nina<br>It was translated and dumped on /a/.</br></br>  <br>this<br>epilogues weren't even necessary<br>those color pages would've been the absolute perfect ending to a ghost story</br></br></br>  Its kind sad to go through all the images and realize you were so addicted on going through so many manga out there that you recognize all of them.<br><br>Now I have to wait or search for more obscure ones</br></br>  <br><br>Don't give us that shit. Gorilla is incapable of thinking up an ending, so this will go on forever</br></br>   muh feels   <br>Thank fuck someone else posted this, was the perfect way to end his reign of justice.</br>  <br>I somewhat felt like the ending could have been even darker but the author felt it might have gone too far.<br>Rather than it taking place on an alternate earth, imagine if the whole thing took place on the earth of the main protagonists. <br> Killing millions of his own people, killing most of the planet just so that it can survive. </br></br></br>    <br>I have 668 series to read, plus rec. charts and I am doing a re-read.<br>Scythe.</br></br>  <br>wat</br>    <br>super underrated post right here</br>    <br> yakumo all alone <br>it isn't right anon<br>it isn't right</br></br></br>  <br>I am on the far opposite of the spectrum, too much to read.</br>  <br>well fuck you then.<br>Hope you someday run out like me and wait just like rest of us</br></br>    Nothing tops this ending though.  <br>It was decent.<br>I remember someone here getting really upset that Yusuke ended up as some noodle shack guy, which is retarded because he was never an academic type in the first place.</br></br>  Best girl always win  <br>What happens? I really need to check it out.</br>  <br>Wonder if shin lone wolf and cub is any good?</br>  <br>I originally wanted to see the old guy get fucked up, but after seeing the movie I think that would have been the worse way to end it.</br>    <br><br>they can't break up if they don't exist in the first place</br></br>  <br>My nigga<br><br>Personally, only pic related beats it<br><br>Honestly surprised no one has posted it.</br></br></br></br></br>  It was a pretty mediocre manga, but holy fuck the ending was perfect.  <br>triggered</br>  <br>They were pretty necessary. The ending without the epilogue didn't let us see them interact or explain in any way how their life was going to be. It just ended on her coming back and even subtly implied that she "spirited him away".<br><br>The epilogue makes it clear that she's going to remain on earth as a ghost, but that she's going to live with him, takes back with him, and sleep in his bed every night until he dies.</br></br></br>  <br>The "spirited away" ending was more fitting of a true ghost story, in my opinion.</br>  I wouldn't have minded some more ship fuel tho  <br>I didnt cry at the end. The ending was surprisingly upbeat. <br>I cried when it happened, and it showed Ikuru afterwards, dead to the world</br></br>  <br>You read Mars?<br/></br>  <br>Because it's not good at all. There has been tons of threads about this ending, if you check the archive I'm pretty sure you can realize it's not a good ending.</br>  <br>It is good</br>    Pretty rushed final chapter but good ending  Tezuka always knew how to wrap up a story.  <br>that did not have a satisfying ending, what about best girl akane</br>  <br>Nar, he usually just died before wrapping most things up.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're only familiar with a handful of his 150+ series.</br>  mx0 got axed, and had a shit ending. If that's a good ending, man ...  <br>I wait too, I made the mistake of choosing some series that were not done yet and for sure I wont ever pick up One Piece.<br><br>I thought she was going to disappear and that he in time he would have dealt with it and get together with the...nephew? the parent what's her name.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke, he's one of my faves. I'm just salty he never finished phoenix and Dororo.</br>  <br> tfw cant fap because of the feels </br>  <br> pluto <br> mediocre <br><br>it was better than Monster.</br></br></br></br>  <br> better than Monster <br>Please, Monster had a great ending.<br><br>And how do you think love roma had a good ending?<br>It was cute but their relationship was boring as fuck. The story and romance honestly somewhat got stale near the middle and towards the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a Quzilax story, this was downright happy. At least the loli wasn't viciously raped</br>  Ending made me go out and buy all the available volumes.  <br>Any help with this, I tried looking but the closest was Ohno Satoshi but he's a drama actor. A list of completed harem manga isn't that helpful either. I thought I had a close match with ichiban ushiro no daimaou but I'm not sure.</br>  <br><br>Monster is a masterpiece though.</br></br>  <br> good ending <br><br>I'm still fucking pissed that samidare won when snake was best girl.<br><br>what the fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was actually really mad when he decided not to climb at first, like fuck no Mori, don't leave it at that you're finally there. It was an understandable decision but fuck, guess that goes to show tough of a choice it was, the dream he had been holding up to for over a decade or his new found happiness at home.</br>    Happy, cozy ending with a big Gyoza feast, soon.  <br> manga named after main girl <br> worst girl of all <br> dropped it <br><br><br> she didn't win <br><br><br>HOLY SHIT I HAVE TO PICK THIS UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Artwork looks familiar<br><br><br>Is this the same guy who did High Score Girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zamurai's final fight was great but it didn't end the way it should've ended. Probably editor pressure because thematically it didn't add up.</br>  <br>How, it was an asspull of astronomic proportions.<br><br> &gt;Build up for a brain anevrism <br> &gt;I'm a doc and I say he's medically dead <br> &gt;FUCK REALITY <br><br>Also Fujisawa is an hack</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When is it ending anyway? I postponed reading it after the boss turned into a devil tube monster.</br>  <br>After chapters of rape suffering, anything was satisfactory</br>  <br>Fuck you, that wasn't satisfying at all<br> he sacrificed himself to save us... <br> timeskip <br> "hey guys, I'm alive, now it's over!" <br>It would have been far more impactful had he just stayed dead<br>Kongou banchou was going downhill before then anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love School Rumble, but I hate how inconsistent the art is.<br><br>Sometimes it's ubercharged, sometimes, he barely draws BGs.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br><br>It still hurts they continue Legal Drug and Gate7 over this</br></br></br>    <br>Everything by him has a pleasant ending</br>  <br>How should it have ended according to you?</br>    <br>Shame All of his series are so mediocre to downright bad tho.</br>  <br><br>Last time Gantz was brought up here, I was under the impression that many people were disappointed with it, guess I visited at the wrong time.<br><br>I was also satisfied with the ending, even if a lot of the arcs were weird, with characters that only seemed important  only to die and be revived only to die permanently for sure <br><br>what sealed the deal for me was the entire Muscle Rider scenario, and his personal ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No unexplained survival. That rainy forest had a good atmosphere to just end it right there. A few pages of epilogue showing what happened afterwards were unnecessary. The cat shouldn't have gone on a trip too.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, good stuff.</br>    <br>Nakaba hates to kill his character, like it or not.<br>Coward Banchou's last big battle was completely fucking awesome and Kongou vs his brother is hilariously over the top and fun.</br></br>  <br><br>I've read the first three volumes, and art-wise, it's very good. Similar to Kojima's, but Mori also leaves his own mark on it (and IMO is a better artist overall, and this comes from someone who loves Kojima). Action scenes are also good, and like with the original LWAC, there's just enough esoteric samurai bullshit in it for it to be interesting instead of overwhelming. <br><br>The plot is okay, the biggest problem so far is the characters. The new Wolf is a badass, but he's no Ogami Itto (at least so far), and "dude from Satsuma who speaks local dialect gets dragged into a plot" is simply not as interesting as "ex-Kogi Kaishakunin now works as an assassin to get revenge". Likewise, the new villain(s) don't have shit on the Yagyu. Still, I want to see where it goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  The only ending that would be fitting for this manga.      <br>lmao</br>    Well, I had a good emotional battery from that ending.  <br>yea but the suffering after that scene made me feel bad</br>  <br>My god. How long has it been.</br>  I'm probably the only one but i like ambiguous &amp; tragic endings. Also i hate :re so i'm biased.  <br><br>Wanted to post that.<br>It was so sad yet so good, all the last 3 volumes were 10/10</br></br></br>      <br>I just funished this. Fuck you, man. Fuck. You.<br><br>I cried.</br></br></br>  I don't have the page but Mushishi had a perfect ending for the story.<br><br><br>Seconding</br></br></br>  <br>I should reread this sometime. I remember the ending almost making me cry.</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  <br>Yeah, last confession and ending were too good.</br>  <br>o i get it, when a story is turning sour, kill everyone and discuss the philosophical nature of life.</br>  It may not be the last page, but it is part of the last chapter and closes the circle in tears  <br>It ends in a cliffhanger.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Sakaki Mirei</br>  <br> They fucked <br>I should have expected it but didn't, it was good.</br></br>  <br><br>I still can't believe Yotsuba is still going when Azumanga was a nice and compact 4 volumes.</br></br>  top kek  <br>I have no idea what this is but I can tell it'll piss me off.</br>  Sorry I had to get this from a website but this is one of the best ending I ever experienced<br><br><br> implying we don't need more of Calvin and Hobbes-tier endings </br></br></br>    <br>The best girl won and that guy's just butthurt about it.</br>  <br>Cage of Eden</br>  <br>I've just recently read it. Fucking A-mazing. <br>Never learned how to pronounce the freaking names.</br></br>  It was good, but I blame the piece of shit daughter for all the shit that happened.  I still feel a little sad.<br><br>Watching a character evolve so greatly is the best.</br></br>  <br>Why are so few authors brave enough to ship some characters together before the very end?<br>Hell why are there even fewer who even dares to imply they fucked?<br><br>I've been on an anime and manga hiatus because I became bored of all the stereotypes like the tsundere girl, the slut who is all talk and actually a prude, dumb fucking main characters who is either too dumb to notice a girl like him or is too fucking scared to try, and worst of all the slapstick humor where the girl beat up the guy for accidents he has no control over.<br><br>I just saw Cross Ange who sadly still have most of these stereotypes intact, at least had them fuck and the main guy bragging about it to the villain to provoke him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is butthurt that he didn't get have his waifu or anhero. They think the artist grill is only keeping him alive for her own well-being.</br>  <br> we never found out what happened to his best friend <br> shoddily resolved <br><br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because pairing to work need development over long periods.<br><br>Most manga's these days either steer clear of shipwreaks or just tease bland one dimentional relationships then either wuss out at the ending or rarely continue with the bad ship regardless and usually throw in something extra sappy at the last second.</br></br></br>  <br>It might have had a good ending if it ended several years earlier instead of flogging the horse untill its bones were dust.</br>    <br>Ah found it, thanks bro</br>  I liked it  <br>Man DtB had such a DtB-ending. Was kinda clear from the beginning that it would be without any explaination though.</br>  <br>Came here to post this.</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br><br>Gunnm Mars Chronicle. Look it up.</br></br>  <br>Same here</br>  <br>Niece, you Freudian slip faggot.</br>  <br>Ran was so perfect, I need more fun and whimsical magical stories.</br>  <br>this is a good suggestion.</br>  <br> MxO <br> Satisfying <br>also fuck you make me remember</br></br></br>  God bless  <br> fucks all three girls <br> makes out with loli <br> has orgy with all the girls <br> doesn't actually pick a girl <br><br>So I'll just assume it remained a true harem end but seriously the last bit was boring and they obviously just dragged things out after the ceremony.<br><br>Here's hoping he starts banging the loli when she gets older  or doesn't wait. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a terrible ending. I'm still mad it got axed</br>    <br> hot <br> misunderstood <br> totally devoted <br> tfw best girl won <br><br>Came to post this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aoba was fuckin great. Tsundere done right.</br>  <br> ending </br>  <br>post the last page</br>  <br><br>Underrated manga.</br></br>    <br>Its not underrated but definitely better than Liar Game.</br>  <br> wanting her to be in a loveless marriage <br>Yuu was always gonna love Samidare before her, better she gets with someone who can appreciate her than will always think of her as second best. Also Catman was cool as fuck</br></br>  <br> want to finish <br> know perfect prostitute is gonna get killed due to faggot mc flexing his muscles <br> refuse to read anymore <br>why must he be such a fucking faggot</br></br></br></br>  Not my favorite manga of all time, but for sure my favorite ending of all time.  <br> 2013 <br>why does it feel like this ended in like 2010<br>2 years seems too short</br></br></br>  <br>Monster did have a great ending<br>but it also had an awful middle filled with unnecessary padding, characters, and plotlines. I love Urasawa's stories but he cant stay on track at fucking all, Pluto is the only one that i'm aware of that doesn't do this shit and that's because he didnt write it.</br></br>  <br>compared to the ending that Asano almost did where punpun falls in front of a train saving sachi's baby this was a great ending.</br>  <br>I'm like halfway through this and love it but stopped a couple months back once i realized it was on its final volume. Did the final chapter come out? I saw one came out last week or so but it wasn't labeled [END] so i figured it wasn't</br>  <br>Its not done, I suggest you keep waiting.</br>  I crei.. 10/10 ending for a short manga..  <br>I enjoyed it more than i expected. Picked up that hardcover localization they did over here and its real nice.<br>Missed alot of stuff my first read too, nice reread</br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br> strongest and most inteligent alchemist <br> gives away his power <br>POTTERY</br></br></br>  <br>I never finished the manga (I should pick it up again)but I did finish the movies. Do you know how faithful the last movie is to the manga? It had all this 'black magic' shit in it that didn't seem very lone wolf and cub.</br>  <br>I thought it ended with him literally saying 'You're already dead'</br>  <br>I remember reading an interview between the guys who made those 'even a monkey can draw manga' books and the guy who made Scott Pilgrim. They said they were really impressed how Scott regularly had casual sex and how that would never happen in most manga.</br>  <br>Ditto<br> I do like the whole "we become our own universe" thing from the movie more than Tetsuo and the kids simply dying though. </br></br>  <br>so much effort but i like you</br>  <br>Casual sex is quite common in seinen/josei manga though. It's really only in shounen manga and anime where you get this blueballing and an aversion for actually showing or implying sex.</br>  <br>Sauce, search came up with nothing.</br>  <br>Fuck you, I've been in most Punpun threads, and I know that there are just as many people who liked the ending as there are who disliked it, since it depends a lot on how you think Punpun ended up and this often involves a lot of projection from the reader.</br>  I completely forgot about this until i saw this thread.  <br>Maybe you should stop reading shit.</br>  <br>mate you need to spend more time on mangafox, this is tier 2 entry level stuff</br>  <br>I rarely do that but i went and read it after i saw your post...

There's also a letter at the end that Marii wrote to Gaku in the event of her death, written in broken English, it may make you cry.</br>  <br> implying this, trainman, nurse-kun, oral hygiene brother, or that guy who told stories about the little girl who hated pizza have any basis in reality whatsoever </br>  <br>But MM is based on 2chan posts right?

I love the MC.</br>  <br>The one where she dumps him, and he has that comically shocked expression, even when it cuts to the next scene (implying that he looked like that for several hours).<br><br>It's not a new gag, but it was well executed.</br></br></br>  <br>To be he was turned into a cuck after getting beat up by that rude girl.</br>  <br>Shame that he's probably going to turn into a huge faggot</br>  <br><br>I mean, that's inevitable but he was resisting every step of the way. I'm confident he'll stay the way he is for most of the series.</br></br>  So cute  <br>God I hope so, it's so refreshing to see an MC that isn't a fucking betamax dick licker.</br>  <br>If there's something Maeda is good at it's comedy.</br>  What special power does imouto have?  <br>Performing anal.</br>  <br> suffering </br>  but which charchar would you impreg with your little pepes /a/nons  <br>charlotte</br>  <br>Now is that receiving or providing? Because I'd let imouto peg me any day.</br>  <br>omega-level mutant, mark my words.</br>  <br>ＫＡＷＡＩＩ！！！</br>  So, any speculation on where the drama will come from this time?  <br>Slut.</br>  <br>Getting KeyAIDS</br>  <br>Charlotte is going to die.</br>  <br>Imouto's KeyAIDS</br>  <br>She seems more like a deepthroat kind of girl to me. Smug main girl is totally build for anal though.</br>  Nao a best.  <br>Let's explore these possibilities further.</br>  <br> not shutting smug the fuck up via irumatio </br>  <br>Please do not sexualize the Charlottes.</br>  <br> not getting that smug off her face through painal <br>Now that I think about it, she's probably made for spitroasting.</br></br>  <br>Stop. Tomori is only for tender loving,</br>  <br><br> gets dumped already in ep1 <br> gets destroyed by a slut and a glasses nerd <br> not betamax </br></br></br></br>  is this what happen whn you let Japan in charge of making the X men?  <br>No, that's Zettai Karen Children</br>  So does her camera turn invisible too along with her clothes?  <br>Presumably. She's been filming the MC all this time, I think.</br>  <br>you have shit taste as well<br>lel-ouch</br></br>  <br>So that begs the question what are the limits to the things she can turn invisible to people?</br>  <br>Best MC, AOTYAY 10/10, can't be self inserted since he's not beta faggot, said /a/. Definitely not pandering, they know what the viewers want.<br><br>Literally me, all the same personality and looks. The girl will fall for him. Best MC. Definitely not self inserting.</br></br></br>  <br>Every time.</br>  <br>They did it before.</br>  <br>Why is Eggman/Robotnik recently frequently posted on /a/?</br>  <br>I'd guess it's like a "whatever's convenient to the plot" thing. Maybe whatever she's touching?</br>  <br>In the butt. <br><br>Tenderly in the butt, no pain like that other fag suggested.</br></br></br>  Would you?    <br>Go away moot.</br>   tfw you want to put your shiny rotthu inside sucy    they pronounced it "sushi" instead of "sucy" like in the first episode <br>fucking ruined the whole thing</br>  Reminder that Lotte actually has really pretty eyes.  <br><br>please do not sexualize witches.</br></br>  the whole ordeal was incredibly cringeworthy and almost hard to watch imo but the girls are cute  The dancing was pretty good.<br>Would appreciate if anyone had the webm.</br>  Continued from <br><br>Real subs when?<br>LN update for V7 was set for tuesday, and today is wednesday<br>FUNI a shit<br>Albedo gets the ED, but Narberal will be every secondary's waifu by the end of season 1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>that is the joke anon...</br></br></br>  So Funi is the only thing we got? No proper group subbing?  <br>a group of the guild helped with the programming of the maids, Meromero was included with that IIRC.</br>  Where the fuck are the good raws?  <br>there's a lot of stuff i wish we were told about Albedo. How did she perceive the "love" for Momonga as the sexual kind, after all there's different kinds of love. Also she seem to imply in at the start of vol 2 to have always loved him, and forgot completely about her other personality. If only we had a chance to only read a peak of the entire epic Tabula wrote into her.</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>There is a lot of GER power scale arguments, but outside of Giorno's plot armor stand, is there any stand that could possibly defeat the green baby realistically?<br><br>Anyone or anything that gets close just stays the same distance as they approach it getting smaller until they are erased at the zero point. <br><br>C-moon seems light a complete downgrade from Green Grass of home.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the effect work in stopped time?</br>   tfw there will never be a Kyou After   <br> Lol <br>Kyoufags, everyone.</br></br>  <br>;_;</br>  Is Clannad worth watching? I generally like KyoAni shows but did not watch any of Keyshit except LB, which was shit.  <br>Good riddance</br>  <br>You have to force yourself through the first season (clannad). Like, really force yourself in every sense of the word. It's still chill to watch, but there simply is no point in it. It's just an introduction to the characters and oh my fucking god that whole fucking star fish arc jesus fucking hell. Fuck m8. Bu yes, you have to watch clannad in order to watch after story.<br>Basically, i don't want to spoil anything but, clannad is a 2/10 and after story is a solid 9/10.<br>It's the only anime that made me actually shed a tear. Not getting watery eyes, literally shed a tear. Why not a 10 then? Well, like i said, i don't want to spoil anything, but the ending is shit. It couldve ended 1-2 episodes before.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
