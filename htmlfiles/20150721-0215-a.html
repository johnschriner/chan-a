I take a break from University. I go to the sea and to the pool. Even if i dont have any friends to do fun stuff with, i enjoy swimming and the summer breeze. Sure its hot and i sweat, 39 degrees everyday on average, but all seasons have their drawbacks. Summer feels like freedom even though if it wasnt for free Uni i would be a NEET and a shut in. The summer breeze feels like a "good " wind.<br><br>Anime summer season usually hold some 3-4 hidden gems</br></br></br>  <br>Why aren't we allowed to have the most simplest things in life?</br>  <br>An overpriced gimmick fan?</br>  <br>Yeah you're really gonna enjoy working in a cublicle while the AC is blasting you and you go outside to take a break and it's 39°c <br><br>The only reason you like summer is no university.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually worse than a regular fan.

First order of business is that everyone must praise Nii-sama.  https://twitter.com/yugioh_anime/st<wbr>atus/622968650887118851</wbr>  <br>Synchro is the shittiest I have to agree but Xyz is probably the strongest</br>  <br><br> Anons who don't go fast </br></br>  <br><br> there are people who think Synchro isn't the master race. </br></br>  <br><br>Xyz are definitely the best in the game right now due to how ridiculous some of the effects on the cards have gotten and how easy they are to get out. Fusion and Synchro feel almost useless at times because of the difference in power and they only have a handful of cards that are actually decent. Synchro is a tad better off though since they're a little easier to get out in most archetypes, but they're starting to quickly fall behind. <br><br>Making most of the Rank 4 Xyz Rank 5 or making them require 3 Tributes would fix a lot of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If the effects aren't good enough, or the costs aren't high enough, people won't buy Xyz and just keep using Synchros. <br> If the effects are TOO good, though, then it guarantees sales at the sealed level! We can always hit the shit in the banlist if it gets too out of control. <br>What Konami didn't realize is that this path of logic only works if you have a handful of overly-useful generic cards. By the time the phrase "Rank 4 Toolbox" had been coined, Konami had already lost the war.</br></br></br>  <br>Why'd Konami decide to abandon Synchro and kept on shilling Xyz? What happened?</br>  <br>Sadly I'd have to agree, I honestly imagine that either the game is going to get so ridiculous that it tanks on itself after another summoning method from the next YGO or they're going to have to do a hard or complete reboot on the whole scene, even if they try to adopt both the OCG and TCG.<br><br>Because they gotta sell those new cards and instead of balancing the cards around existing cards, they just give them stupid power creeped effects so they are for sure to sell and call it a day.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not entire sure, but I imagine that Xyz snowballed, and if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.<br><br>Xyz were doing well, so there was no reason to do anything with Synchro.  Although they did print Phonon Pulse Dragon in Primal Origins, which in my opinion is one of the better Synchro Tuners. </br></br></br>  <br>Any summon method can be great, only need good support cards/archetypes.<br><br>I'm a Synchro scum because I love permanent effects and all that awesome plays from the Infernity Era.</br></br></br>  <br>Just the new cards that sell, they're starting to abandon that and go to Pendulum now, though they're still trying to create a few here and there. <br><br>YGO really needs multiple formats or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I have yet to actually find any real application of Clear Wing beyond cockblocking Superheavies and Nekroz of Trish, which are both easily dealt with because YOU HAVE TO FUCKING PUT CLEAR WING ON THE BOARD FIRST, TELEGRAPHING WHAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO.</br>  <br> if you can't beat then join them <br>I can see it happening to pendulums soon. The pendulum magicians engine is insanely cohesive, even when they can't OTK you they can stall like mad and non-destruction removal are limited.</br></br>  <br>That's a problem with a lot of the Arc-V decks and aces actually. They're too telegraphed.</br>  <br>Qlis and IgKnights are like that too, if you can't set shit up super quick you can stall like crazy.</br>  Normal Summon, Gemini Summon, Flip Summon, Special Summon, Tribute Summon, Syncrho Summon, XYZ Summon, XYZ Chaos Change, <br><br>How many summons can summons</br></br>  <br>Clear Wing is good if your opponent is stupid and thinks they can Castel you.</br>  <br>Alchemy Summon, Rank Up Summon, Graveyard Summon, Banish Summon, Summon Summon</br>  Why was this ever made? It's a counter to literally everything in the game.  <br>Kisses everywhere should calm him down<br>I'd approach it that way even if it doesn't</br></br>  <br>Because it can actually be dealt with pretty easily honest, at least in my experience. I use the deck and I love it and it definitely works wonders, but Dark Law can be dealt with, and HERO decks start getting iffy the more you cycle through your low amount of monsters and they get sacked quite fast if you aren't drawing what you specifically need at the right time.</br>  <br> Everything <br>What are Ritual Beasts?</br></br>  <br>  Macro Cosmos on legs for your opponent. <br>  Any dark deck can SS it <br>  Screws up people's hands after searching <br>Nah man its fair as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>An archetype that durdles but doesn't get anywhere?</br>  <br> Any dark deck can summon it <br><br>As long as you have a HERO sure.</br></br></br>  <br> https://twitter.com/yugioh_anime/s<wbr>tatus/622968650887118851</wbr> <br>I need the Yugi one.</br></br>    Zuzu isn't that bad of a name imo.  <br>  Although I'm legitimately terrified about what they'll do to the Ruri and Yuya clones' names.  </br>  <br> what is mask change II </br>  <br>People give Performapals shit, but 3 Friendonkey, Pinch Helper, and Revival make cards like Performapal Swordfish pretty silly, and that's before you take into account shit like Pendulum Summoning proc'ing Fish's effect. Then you combine it with OEPD and the Gazers and you easily get tons of damage.<br><br><br> Superheavies can't do much without Big Benkei or Susano-O on the field, and without Shutendoji, they have no real outs to S/Ts that might slow down or stop them. <br> Melodious suffer from having too much good shit to run and not enough search power to guarantee any plays. A good hand may as well have been pendulum summoned, but a bad hand can't even Set 1 and Pray. <br> RaidRaptors are actually good, but with the current TCG cardpool, they suffer from massive consistency issues despite their inherent search power being pretty decent. Also all of their good monsters are 3-material Xyz, which means "play 2+ Vanishing Lanius a turn or fall back on your R4 Toolbox". <br> Performapals have solid battle phase plays and good BP utility, but are absolutely trash if your opponent doesn't battle, or has ways to get around your battle. Also suffers from bricking fairly routinely. <br> Fluffals lack the search power they need, and don't have Scissor Tiger in TCG, making them entirely useless most of the time, with one of the best plays still being Scissor Wolf + Fusion Weapon. <br> Phantom Knights aren't printed and likely won't ever be. <br> Sybils and Aqua Actresses feel more like support archetypes than standalone archetypes, even with both having boss monsters. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>u jist mad cuz u r bad</br>  <br> durdles <br>Cute word</br></br>  <br>I don't know why you would be running Dark Law without having Shadow Mist and just running Mask Change instead of Mask Change II, but yeah you're right, that does work.<br><br>RR suffer extreme mass consistency issues even with their OCG cards, they're a little better off, but they can stuffed unless you resort to Rank 4, because some of the decks just get Xyz out so fast that it just quickly trumps Strix and then you have to rely on hoping to get Rank Ups and other things quickly and sometimes you need to blow spells just to keep your small guys alive in the meantime.</br></br></br>  <br>  SHS have no real outs to S/Ts that might slow down or stop them. <br>Nusu-10 is a thing too.<br><br>also, relying on the big bosses is what you're supposed to. It's how they want you to play it.</br></br></br></br>  When did this become /dng/?  <br>There's a bit of a difference between relying on a boss monster and "if you don't have a boss or one of his offshoots on the board you are doing incredibly poorly and need to get on that".</br>  <br>About the same time I fell in love with you</br>  <br>This convo is actually logical and extremely tame compared to /dng/. Besides it usually happens in spurts when we've got nothing to talk about or when half the characters aren't posting any arguing at each other.</br>  Ok I have a really shitty question about Pendulum.<br>In Ygopro/Devpro I can't place a pendulum card in the Red Zone before having one in the blue one. However this rule doesn't seem to be written on the rulebook.<br><br>What I want to know is: can I place only one Pendulum card on the RED zone pr do I have to place it on the BLUE one like in Ygopro/depro ?</br></br></br>  <br>  tits or gtfo  </br>  <br>YGOPro doesn't give the option because cards don't have different scales yet.</br>  <br>You should be able to place them on either one, but I don't think it really matters if you're only placing one at a time. I've noticed it doesn't really matter which one you place them in, but maybe I'm just blind.</br>  <br>Auto card placing</br>  <br>Wait... Does that mean I can Pendulum summon by setting one 8 scale and THEN a 1 scale ?!<br>If it's the case I played like shit for a while.</br></br>  <br> anime about a card game <br> expect people to not talk about the card game <br>you stupid or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you can set them in any order, I do it all the time with IgKnights.</br>  <br>I feel so fucking dumb.

Thankfully we have Arc-V for that.</br>  <br>Spanish I think</br>  <br><br>Chinese</br></br>  <br> shipfags constantly bringing everything back to shipping <br><br>Seriously, you guys are getting worse than the fujos.</br></br></br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>I ship YumaXAlito, what are you going to do about it motherfucker?</br>    <br> mangareader.net </br>  <br>gotta love have those faggots put their watermark on other peoples work.</br>  <br> Damn it Melissa, stop going off-script, Yuya needs to suffer so his dueling power will increase. Why do you think I told the council to keep Yuya and that pink haired-Serena away from each other? </br>  <br>i want to hug Melissia, she's a cutie.</br>  <br>p-pls be gental....</br>  Reminder the girls will be fan girling Yugo in his match  <br>That's fine, Yugo deserves it in his last moments.</br>  <br><br>GX was way worse. Aliens, forces of nature, and monsters from other dimensions played a card game made by an American, but everyone uses cards with Japanese text.</br></br>  <br>Nah, they'll be fangirling over Kurosaki and Crow.<br> BUY WINGED-BEASTS </br></br>  <br>DM had dimensions/realms too.</br>  <br>This reminds me. How come almost everybody in the Synchro Dimension has a western name? Rin, Yugo, Shinji and Chojiro are the only exception, everyone else both tops and commons are western. <br>In 5Ds it was a weird mix of some Japanese names and some western names, but Arc-V makes it even weirder, especially since we don't even know what part of the world the City is in (we don't even know if there's anything else in the world, why didn't Reiji go to the UN?)</br></br>  <br>It's Japan, The City is just Domino City revamped.</br>  <br>So it's a Japanese City where everyone is western. <br>Makes perfect sense, the Japanese are known for their open borders and acceptance of other cultures and ethnicities after all</br></br>  <br>No Anon, I'm not sick or anything, I do in fact miss Zexal. Though it was the worst Yu-Gi-Oh to date, it still had its charm and fun characters. I think the aspect of Zexal I miss are the Archlights and Barians.</br>  REIJI DUELING WHEN  <br>He's found a new NEET-cave and found a replacement for Nakajima in Ninjabro. Why would he want to leave?</br>  <br><br><br>Its in a dimension where Japan won WW2 everyone speaks jap but they have westerner names.</br></br></br>  <br>Or a world where after WWII the allies decided that the best way to fix Japan's xenophobia was to send a bunch of westerners there and force the Japanese to coexist with gaijin. Generations later it worked, wealth is now more important than ethnicity</br>  <br><br>/pol/ pls</br></br>  <br>I hope something happens that ends up with him dueling jack, since he's portrayed as the best of standard.</br>  <br>:^) u gonna get carded common scum.</br>  <br>Do we have a Yuzu one yet?<br>Also, poor Honda</br></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>14040</wbr>  <br>They spell Yugo as Hugo though and Shinji's last name is Webber.<br><br>The only one who's pure Japanese is Chojiro.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Security plays Goyos, a really Japanese theme</br>  <br>It's pretty cool actually. Maybe the writers are telling a message about Japanese society or something? <br><br> Inb4 the writers just find combining Western and Japanese a cool thing. </br></br></br>  <br>I guess its inspired by futuristic cities. The buildings are all painted white and have a lot of glass. Roads pop up everywhere and it seems high class. Could be a nod to current and/or future western metropolis. <br>Satellite is clearly a reference to a neo noir city where technology didnt actually benefit that much</br></br>  <br>Pretty much your inb4</br>  <br>What is GX?</br>  <br>an in-joke that was taken too seriously</br>  <br>That's a distant sequel I think he meant a sequel involving the DM characters.</br>  <br>A miserable pile of POT OF GREEDS</br>  Time is a valuable thing<br>Watch it fly by as the  pendulum  swings</br>  <br>A miserable Pot of Greed!</br>  <br>Melissa Claire seems to not be an elitist snob like the rest of the TOPS</br>  Is there going to be a Ritual Dimension?  <br>To be honest, it doesn't seem like Melissa is from Tops though. Or if she was, she's probably not that rich like most of the Tops.</br>  Why is secret police always so /fa/?  <br>There seem to be two kinds of tops. Those high class rich guys like the ones in the park Yugo and Yuzu ended up and the ones in the high class bar and boxes in the stadium. Then there are the tops which seem like middle class, the ones in the shopping district and the cafe Yugo and Yuzu went and the ones in the park where Dennis and Gon performed</br>  <br>Agreed, it needs a format without Synchro or XYZ to play the game as it was originally intended.<br><br><br>Also, for the regular format, I wish they made a serious effort to make old-school style decks playable, the game needs better cards to limit extra deck summoning badly. Tribute summoning has been rendered obsolete by new mechanics and that's a shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Monarchs already do that.</br>  <br>Monarchs are what you're looking for, they aren't that good though. I've tried mix-matching Pendulums into them like IgKnight, but it's still inconsistent.</br>  <br> Igknights </br>  <br>I can't argue that, I love the aesthetics of them and I tried them out solely because of their ability to destroy themselves and resummon them. I was hoping that it might lead to easier tribute summoning for Monachs, but that isn't the case really.</br>  <br>Use the pendulum magicians. Pendulum call is a gud card.</br>  <br>I'll give it a try, but honestly I'm not hoping for much anymore with any of the decks. Current meta is just too capable of shutting down and searching. Hell I've tried running Dark Heroes and Dark Law and Acid are fantastic cards, but the deck has consistency issues out the ass and the meta can run right over them if you don't instantly get Dark Law out (even then spell/traps can deal with Dark Law) and the lack of good offensive/defensive weapons in Dark Heroes.</br>  <br>I've been told that they're the most consistent Exodia draw engine, though. Granted, Exodia in general is a suboptimal strategy, but hey, it's something.</br>  So:<br> a rumor that Synchro Dimension it is REALLY is Neo Domino City, Red Demon has that form after his duel with Yusei's Junk Warrior, Friendship Cup will be interrupted by Academia's invasion, Jack got a lot bitter than before and betray everyone <br>It's a rumor.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't doubt it honestly based on how they work.<br><br>Well it technically is Neo Domino City. But there are a lot of inconsistency issues with it regardless. A major one is the fact that the Commons created D-Wheels and no KaibaCorp to be found.</br></br></br>  <br>I believed that Synchro would be Neo Domino when Jack and Crow ere announced, but let's face it, it's an AU, don't be a denialfag for your pet theories. I still think that technically sort of it's Neo Domino, and indeed all the dimensions are part of the original timeline but something went screwy and the universe split into multiple dimensions with an alternate history in each of them.</br>  <br>It's amazing how literally you make that sentence a half-truth.</br>  <br> implying it REALLY is Neo Domino City <br>Its Neo New Domino City</br></br>  <br>Sawatari vs Neo New Sawatari when?</br>  <br><br>I like that Yuya is analyzing Jack's dueling style</br></br>  <br>When Sawatari meets him dimensional counterparts. <br><br>Sawatari<br>New Sawatari<br>Neo New Sawatari <br>Nuevo Neo New Sawatari</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Glad this hasn't happened in Arc-V yet</br></br>  <br><br>I want Rua and Ruka to show up so we know when exactly we need to put Arc-V in the timeline</br></br>  <br>Plot twist: Arc V isn't in the timeline.</br>  <br>Explain what part if half</br>  Yuya vs Yugo soon?  <br><br>In 5D's the world was much more international. <br>I think there was a team from Norway in 5D's and also Aki went to germany to study medicine</br></br></br>  xth for equality  <br><br>Turn of auto card placing in the options<br>You can place them in either zone</br></br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of Team Ragnarok, one of the Friendship cup participants looks extremely nordic, too</br></br>  <br>It was actually because 5Ds was originally intended to be international. All the characters would be from different parts of the world, Aki was gonna be Russian for instance. Presumably at some point they changed their minds, but all the names and concepts remained the same</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br><br>The one that stands next to Yugo</br></br>   i'm just waiting to see yuya pull a synchro out of his ass with the card that the weird little boy gave him (it's a tuner, i bet it is). <br> jack will totally justify giving the card to the boy by saying that no card is useless. yusei feelings. <br> they totally merged jack and yusei into one character, or jack will say something like " a friend of mine taught me that a long time ago " or some shit </br></br>  <br> between Dennis and Shinji <br>OH SHIT IT'S DUEL CHASER 227</br></br>  <br> it's a tuner, i bet it is <br> The card literally says Tuning Magician </br></br>  <br>Who's he gonna lose to? Yuzu? It's her fault he got fired</br>  How Jack vs Yuya should have been:<br><br><br>http://www.nicozon.net/watch/sm2669<wbr>3420</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Do i look like i can read japananese?</br>  Remember when Sawatari was the main villain, Whip Viper was the ace monster and Yuzu was within arms reach?<br><br>Good times. Shibireru.</br></br>   "The ruler's heartbeats will now file through here! Take witness to its creation-shaking power! Synchro Summon!

Nor does the idea of tearing off her panties, bending her over said table, and slamming dick into her cunt, piercing her hymen and crashing through her cervix, appeal to you? How about piercing her uterus so ferociously that it kills her tiny womb, leaving her infertile? Ditto the idea that, through all the pain, her cunt eventually moistens to the erotic touch, no matter how violent, and the stimulation eventually causes her to have a forcible and shuddering orgasm? And what if this was all recorded and used for blackmail? Don't you want to see her in the aftermath, laying there with deadened eyes, completely still, trying to cast her mind anywhere else, but always cycling back to the thought, "I wish I was dead," but not having remotely the personal strength to do it?<br><br>I don't know, that sounds pretty hot to me.</br></br></br></br>    <br>it should be the other way around anon.</br>  <br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437258540690.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437258540690<wbr>.webm</wbr></a></br>  This girl has such a bad attitude.    <br>Real tankobon edit never.</br>  <br>She shouldn't be this cute if she's got a bad attitude then.</br>    <br>I hope multiple personality disorder gets good porn too.</br>  <br>99% of the doujins will be imouto and you know it</br>  <br>keep doing what you're doing, anon</br>  <br>Imouto is not popular, Nao will get most of the doujin material.</br>  Nao is pretty cute.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128322400 <br>Take your pasta back to /b/ retard.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128322746 <br>So what?

MC is for once not a betafaggot, he deserves all the girls.</br>  Why he keeps saying his ability is teleportation when it's really just hyper-speed?  <br>I'd suck a dog off regardless of gender. Still want to try anal from a Dobie or GSD or fuck one.</br>  <br>Because it sounds cooler</br>  So this this show supposed to be super depressing?  <br>You need to do some huge sacrifice to deserves all the girls. If by not being betafaggot which you means all the things he does in episode 1, then he doesn't deserves any of the girls.</br>  <br>Not yet, Maeda will have his dying girl in the snow though</br>  <br> You need to do some huge sacrifice to deserves all the girls. <br>That's not how it seems to work in most anime.<br><br>It's not like there are any good girls in this in the first place. The girl he went out with in the first episode is a boring shit, and Nao a shitty bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Definitely not self-inserting, with the MC good looks, sinister way of thinking, and wicked sense of humor. <br>It will be interesting to see all those girls falls in love with MC for no reason though, just like all those haremshow you watch.</br></br>  <br> you <br> Needing to self-insert into every anime <br><br>It's possible to like characters without self-inserting and just want them all to have good ends.</br></br></br></br>  Pixiv better deliver good porn, like with Nibutani.  <br>Still obsessed with clanAIDS, huh? That shit was years ago and no one important died in Angel Beats or Little Busters, which are more recent works. You can stop pretending Maeda is an edgemaster like butcher or okada.</br>  <br> Nibutani <br> good porn <br>I must be blind, I only saw like 3 good pieces.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Yusa one of the main characters? She didn't do shit this episode.</br>  <br> That's not how it seems to work in most anime <br>Sure, because of that, let's just follow the same logic as those all NON-shitty haremshow you watched. <br><br>Is that what you really expecting from this show? really?<br><br>I know kids in this thread is edgy and self inserting as MC, but blatantly accepting that? Holy shit, man. You must've been a chore to hanging out with.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no one important died in Angel Beats or Little Busters <br>Maeda literally came in and wrote the Saya route, where she dies in the snow, for EX. He's not an edgemaster he just likes dying girls in the snow</br></br>  <br>but everyone died in angel beats</br>  <br>Saya is not important or canon, EX in general is not canon either.</br>  <br>EX has the best route</br>  <br><br>I don't self-insert, I just really enjoy seeing characters like Light and Lelouch. I wish there were more of them in anime and fewer ugly betafaggot harem masters.<br><br>I accept a harem when someone like Light or Lelouch is at the helm</br></br></br></br>  who the fuck is charlotte?  <br>Us</br>  <br>The dog</br>  <br>Why would you personally feel cucked if someone who isn't the MC gets a girl then?</br>  <br>The big sister was better. Why must good girls die?</br>  <br>Because he's MC and the other guy is a betafaggot. How could I self insert into a Lelouch archetype? I've got more in common with the betafaggot</br>  <br>It's KEY, someone has to die</br>  <br>So based on what you said, you enjoy being cucked?</br>  <br>Did somebody mention a dog?</br>  He's gonna feel like a dick when his sister dies.  <br>What if each ED is different. Sung by various members of the cast and LIA.<br><br>Maeda doesn't actually care about writing VNs or anime anymore. He really makes them to market his albums.</br></br></br>  <br> You'll never be a little girl who gets to do lewd things with a big manly dog </br>  <br>It's not like the ED animations are going to eat up any budget, so might as well funnel that into songs instead.</br>  That dog is really  cute .  <br>Someone with some actual since... on /a/?!</br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck?</br></br></br>  <br>Like a dick who is free from her omelet rice.</br>  <br>What if she doesn't die? What if absolutely nothing bad happens to imouto?</br>  This show will have the scientist are going to mind rape imouto, which will probably have some OP ability that is found in 1 out a million users, or is a aberration of the super power gene or whatever. Imouto will be killed and MC will relate to the main girl's suffering and ends Imouto's life.<br><br>Hint: I work for Urobutcher.</br></br>  <br>Retards thinking they can predict a Maeda show are hilarious, especially when they couldnt predict the Angel Beats twist that was even in the title itself.</br>  <br>I finished the first season of clannad yesterday and it made me feel so sorry for Sunohara. He's a good guy but nobody give a fuck about him, he could disapear and it would take weeks before someone notice. Not even his little sister care about him.

You sure were traumatized by that business with Othinus, Kamijou-chan!!” <br>Also the symbolism with the "put this in your mouth misaka!"<br>Goddamn this novel is great.</br></br>  <br>They should break him even more, I want to see the result.</br>  <br>He's already become massively inventive about ways to kill someone, you want him to start applying that to normal people now?</br>  <br>Yes so there's an excuse to kill him</br>  <br>  symbolism <br>I don't think that was the intent given Misaka's rejection regarded her ability to safely charge the battery in that manner.</br></br>  <br>Mikotofags no but Misaka did get BTFO hard</br>  <br>Yeah I was just joking. Looks like Mikoto got herself 2 more rivals though.<br> But only if we receive that prayer from our cute little Kamijou-chan. </br></br>  <br>  2 <br> Not for long </br></br>  <br>Does she physically hurt at all? <br><br>That's what's so bullshit and infuriating about her.</br></br></br>  How long before Nephshippers show up  <br> Implying she's not going to plop back into this world, nude, with her crotch straight onto touma's face. </br>  <br>of course not, but she gets her feelings hurt. nyang attack her but the spears or whatever had a delayed and unknown effect that touma stopped before it started.</br>  <br>Fairy spell lets them continue doing all their bullshit at full power with the 100% failure trick and only becomes a problem when its on the verge of killing them. Nerf spell actually weakens them.</br>  <br> implying she would even care about Touma after she pretty much orgasmed as Kamisato fingered her. </br>  <br>Yeah, so we can see him reflect his own actions and whispers "what have I done?".</br>  <br>I mean the original intent of the fairy spell. Olly didn't think that shit would kill othinus, he thought it would weaken her to the point of being harmless. That is sorta what this spell does but they are far from harmless. However like the actual result of the fairy spell the gods like othinus can't regain their lost power even with ib.</br>   “Her… That girl with the short brown hair and the headband… Come to think of it, who is she!? I feel like she’s been nonchalantly showing up everywhere I go!!”  <br><br>Kamachi is having too much fun with this.</br></br>  Can't wait for Mikoto's tears.  <br>I really want this to get animated just to see her retroactively added to various scenes, even if it's just for index-tan.</br>   “Misaaaka, can you try putting this plug in your mouth?”  <br><br>I'm getting turned on.</br></br>  <br> That is sorta what this spell does but they are far from harmless. <br>They're harmless to Aleister and Noukan, aside from some relatively minor property damage.</br></br>   “Ksssshhhhh!! …The signal in your area is too crowded, so the number you have called cannot be-…” <br><br> “What the hell? There’s an interfering signal? Wait, don’t tell me… Misakaaaaaa!!” <br>I'm enjoying this shit too much.</br></br></br>  <br>What a sad life you must have</br>  Ooh, so Touma's taking advantage of "that".<br><br>Even if Magic Gods are omnipotent, they're not omniscient. Even if he could destroy the entire universe on a whim, even he would have a hard time finding a single 0.05m bit of gold in in a beach.</br></br>  <br>What a frustrated life you must have. Can't wait to lick your tears too.</br>  <br>My tears? You're assuming I'll cry if Mikoto cries? You've got that wrong. I'd love to see her move away from Touma and do something actually meaningful</br>  <br>I think they can know if they have their power and are looking. The gods kept track of all the shit on earth despite being in another dimension with no sense of time or distance. Othinus knew what happened during the fight with touma and ollerus despite not being their and not having her full power.</br>  <br> touma and ollerus <br>I mean touma and fiamma</br></br>  <br>Think again.<br><br>If she charges it Touma might make a call to a girl!!!</br></br></br>  I feel so bad for Misaka that I don't even feel like shitposting or complaining about her anymore this volume. Being Misaka is pure suffering. To think it only gets worse from here on out.  <br>Still much less suffering than Misaki.</br>  <br>I really wonder what would happen if Misaki tried to read Touma's memories and caught a glimpse of the infinite hells.</br>  <br> Mikoto  <br> doing something meaningful <br>How many more volumes are you willing to wait for it?</br></br></br>  Anyone who thinks Mikoto will shake this off and get stronger is delusional. She'll either do her own thing and accept its over with Touma or just be irrelevant and stop appearing, with the first option being the most likely  <br>No, Misaka has it worse this time and its through her whole volume. Misaki just had one bad scene at the end and thats it.</br>  <br>She might end jumping on him to give him a lot of feel hugs.</br>  <br>It can happen once the shitty crush is over which is this volume</br>  <br>Mentally stronger. Somewhat likely.<br>Power wise. Never.</br></br>  <br>Only because the narrative didn't show it, but not being acknowledged by Touma in any way is infinitely worse suffering than whatever Mikoto goes through in this volume.</br>  <br>Speaking of delusions.</br>   “The stars can be plucked from the sky so easily, but you humans feel such passion for such unimportant things.” <br><br>Nuit ? Nuit.</br></br>  <br>What delusions</br>  <br> implying Dengeki Bunko/Miki will allow this to happen. </br>  <br> She had felt he would truly leave for some place she would never be able to reach. <br><br> So she did not care how pathetic it was. She did not care if everyone treated her like a weed or stone on the side of the road, if her pride as Tokiwadai Middle School’s Ace was torn to shreds, or if Academy City’s #3 was entirely useless in the face of a “true conflict”. <br><br> Magic? Magic God? <br><br> She did not understand the words everyone else was using. She could not share in their meaning, she could not imagine what they were talking about, and she could not keep up. That fact was a powerful blow. <br><br> But she could put all of that off until later. <br><br> She could go through it all bit by bit based on what she did understand. <br>This volume is really opening up plot for Mikoto to become stronger in the future. What else is there besides Mikoto getting her awakened wings? Perhaps being Aleister's favorite toy will amount to something.<br><br> Niang-Niang <br>Best new Magic God that should be the one to live with Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your projections of your desires of course.</br>  <br>It's already happened unless the spoilers are wrong</br>  <br> Nuitfag is back </br>  <br>Misaki was still given hope that Touma would remember and one day have a sweet talk, Misaka character is just being destroyed and probably remade in future volumes. Anything she understood is all shattering before her eyes.</br>  <br> Misaka has it worse <br>To this point the only thing that has happened is she realized how she weak is compared to touma's current threats and how little she knows about anything. Misaki has the love of her life will never remember her, and this has been going for over a year. She doesn't even have option of trying harder like mikoto.</br></br>  <br> Best new Magic God that should be the one to live with Touma. <br>She dies like a bitch and it serves her right.</br></br>  <br>Theres evidence of what I suggested happening</br>  <br>js06 has already said the spoilers were wrong on many things</br>  <br>If they are, fine. But if they are not my point stands</br>  <br> Misaki was still given hope <br>When? She wasn't given any indication that it would change, she just hopes it might.</br></br>  <br> there is evidence for what I am saying if you misinterpret things in the manner I laid out </br>  <br> Misaka makes starts  <br> Magic gods pluck them out like nothing  <br><br>Seriously, it seems more like referencing Misaka can be thrown out at any time because she is irrelevant and humans which is us feel passion for such an unimportant character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is the beauty of an anon board, you can pretend you never said anything.</br>  <br>Niang Niang shat all over Mikoto and she died. Neph was nice to her and she lived.<br><br>It's a no-brainer who is the one that deserves to live and should be with Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>Based Jsbro.</br>  <br>Granted, we have to admit that Misaki's the most tragic heroine in the Toumabowl, something that she never have a part of in the first place.</br>  <br>Mikoto knows her chances with Touma are over. Get over it. She'll move on to better things</br>  <br> She'll move on to better things <br>Like Kuroko?</br></br>  <br>Misaki can try harder its just she is too irrelevant to be put in the story.</br>  <br>Fuck no. Like being an actual part of the story.</br>  <br>Just like Misaki.</br>  <br> that pic again <br>You need a life</br></br>  <br>But Kuroko's already moved on.</br>  Uho hoiii  <br> MIsaki <br> Seria <br> Mikoto <br> Index <br> Tsukuyomi <br> Agnese <br> Ursula <br><br>Well, there's only Kanzaki, Itsuwa, and a few others left.<br>So who else are withdrawing from Toumabowl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Misaka being aware of Misaki feelings for Touma, is she even aware that she's not the only girls who love him?</br>  <br> Misaki <br> Not Index <br>Anon, just one volume was enough to make you think this but given the testimonies from Index's former friends I think she still tops all of them haremettes so far.<br><br>When Touma mentioned her hair fragance. Misaki was startled, perhaps she saw hope or baseless Hope that however is open too the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Othinus survives this arc and returns to her normal size then the Toumabowl is over.</br>  <br>Go away.<br><br><br>Don't exaggerate, anon. Besides, Nephthys also paid Mikoto no heed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but Index's feeling for Touma is more of a filial, platonic friendship not differing from the one she had for Styl, Kaori, or even that alchemist.</br>  <br>Othinus is shit deserves to die. Toums along with her.</br>  <br>She knows 10032 and the clones crush on him, at least. Maybe Index too.</br>  <br>You're shit.</br>  <br>I love reading anons who are so deep in their mantra they have to no choice but to dig the hole deeper.</br>  <br>Oh wow you totally showed me</br>  <br>Can't wait to read some Magic goddesses interactions if there's any in the next volume.</br>  <br>So far she thinks Misaki wants to mess with Touma because he is acquaintance of Mikoto.<br>Mikoto is as clueless about Misaki's past with Touma as much as she is with magic.<br><br><br>Let's not start with that BS shrug off from the typical nay sayer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing she probably suspects Seria at this point.</br>  <br>That would be such a beautiful scene where Touma and Othinus die together while in love taking their last breaths as they move on to a better place.</br>  <br>Quality reply for a quality post alright.</br>  Horrible things happen to people who were on the verge of winning the T.<br><br>One got prison-zoned, one got amnesia-zoned, and the last got fairy-zoned.</br></br>  What do we know about Anti-Touma so far?  <br>No girl will be any different</br>  <br> One got prison-zoned, one got amnesia-zoned, and the last got fairy-zoned. <br><br>Not sure if I remember the former two.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no exaggeration though. Mikoto would have been killed if Touma wasn't there to stop the attack. It's also better to ignore than shit on someone. That's why Niang Niang dies.</br>  <br>  last got fairy-zoned <br>Still going strong winning the Toumabowl where none of the other girls can compare.</br></br>  <br>She did show up in Index II during the class hotpot party, iirc.</br>  <br>He's got straight hair.</br>  Where is Thor?  <br>Itsuwa and Misaki obviously. I guess index may also count as amnesia-zoned.<br><br> And itsuwa isn't really in jail. </br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi better deliver.</br>  <br>I'm guessing prison-zoned is Itsuwa and amnesia-zoned is Misaki.<br><br><br>It's time to stop posting, Mugino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Killed a loli</br>  <br> delusional <br><br>No girl is winning or will win the Toumabowl.</br></br></br>   She shook her head and forced down the phrase that was rising from her throat. <br>I'm a little confused by this phrase. Is she basically on the verge of confessing?</br>  <br>The only one of those three that were "close to winning the T" is living in his house now.</br>  <br><br><br> Itsuwa <br><br>Must've been that SS then.<br><br>Also<br><br><br>I thought Mugino hates male characters to care about anyone winning the T-bowl and would rather see Kuroko winning her Onee-sama. Or  Kamachi reviving Frenda and getting it on with Mugino </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kamachi killing off lolis but putting shotas in the spotlight?</br>  When will Chimera come back?  Being a haremette is true suffering.  <br> being this new </br>   faggots still thinking any girl was close to winning Touma or will ever be close to winning Touma   <br> Must've been that SS then. <br><br>Its a forced meme that she killed Tatemiya while doing sword catching.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems you forgot about Othinus</br>  <br><br>Might as well say I don't know there's a thing called the T-bowl.  And that there was such as thing as Raildex generals. <br><br><br>Shit, I remember now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems you're one of the faggots I was talking about</br>  <br>Fuck off with the false flagging<br> posting the same pics </br></br>  Can't wait for this iteration of Touma to die so we can get Touma 4.0.  So was nyang going to kill mikoto? i don't know anything about her religion to know what the special swords do.  <br>Not even a shipper but Othinus was pretty close in NT10. I mean, if Kamachi decided to go full romance with her it would have made sense.</br>  <br>I can't feel bad for her, its her own fault if she can't get closer to him after this. All she has to do is say "By the way, where can I learn about this 'magic' stuff you kept talking about?" and he'd hook her up with Index/Othinus. Hell, he can give a decent explanation himself. She could even use it as an excuse to take him out for lunch or something.<br><br>Accel and Mugino are better at interacting like normal human beings than she is at this point.</br></br></br>  <br> Shit, I remember now <br>I'm sure you do.</br></br>  <br> I'm not a shipperfag but I ship this thing!!! </br>  <br> deflection </br>  <br>Magic Gods don't even see humans as anything but a pebble on the road. Niang Niang's reacting out wasn't done out of contempt or for any other purpose than swatting a bug out of the way. That's how Magic Gods roll.</br>  <br> Accel and Mugino are better at interacting like normal human beings than she is at this point. <br> Mugino <br>Until Hamazura enters the scene, that is.<br><br><br>Is that seriously what you got out of that post?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not that bad.</br></br>  <br> being a filthy shipperfag </br>  <br>And that's why she died. Karma is a bitch. You don't touch the most plot armored girl in the series.</br>  <br>Yes, if Touma didn't destroy the weapons she would be kill.</br>  <br> being a broken recorder </br>  <br>This. Mikoto brings on her own suffering. She doesn't deserve to win. <br><br>In fact, she deserves to lose hard like this other tsundere.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a nice subtle way of telling her to shut the fuck up</br>  <br>THK pls go.</br>  I cannot wait for all shipperfags to eat their own diarrhea when all the ships sink and its revealed shippingshit was only in this novel to help it sell more  One does not simply kill a Misaka.  <br>Accelerator would like a word or 10031 with you</br>  <br> Best girl losing as usual.jpg </br>  <br>I can't wait to see your face when Index wins.</br>  <br>I meant it in meta. Fans would riot.</br>  <br>She fired her railgun at Touma's ass and school because he was wearing a stupid outfit during a stupid event. She is that bad.<br><br>Accel wouldn't endanger people like that and Mugino at least waits for smartass remarks or threats before she lasers shit now.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd laugh tbh</br>  <br>I would actually be pretty happy</br>  <br> Any girl being close to wining. </br>  <br>Misaka's inner thoughts and her interactions with Touma have been great so far. As I said before, Kamachi hasn't lost the touch yet.</br>  <br> wining </br>  <br>I'd be totally ok with this</br>  <br>It's obvious she'll be the winner if there's any chance of romantic conclusion at all which is pretty much zero as it stands</br>  What if everyone gets a bowl? Would anyone be happy about that?  Shippers ever simply have fun with reading ?<br>this is great volume.</br>  <br> mouths off to a god <br>gets upset when she almost gets killed<br> tries to fight a person who touma told her they had no shot against <br>gets upset when she loses<br><br>Mikoto started it both times. Honestly after what they have been through today she should be weary of anyone dressed weird.<br> been chased by a mummy all day <br> see two more mummies <br> better yell at them </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's comedy so it's okay <br>I'm getting very tired to this shit already</br></br>  <br><br>Nice horrible taste and opinion.</br></br>  <br> two more mummies <br>One was mostly unwrapped and the other is a jiangshi thingy.</br></br>  <br>Mikoto is pretty stupid in general. It serves her right to be punished for her bitchiness and immaturity.</br>  <br>Not that guy but more or less all the destruction PH has caused and what lives he may have ended was in a comedy scene.<br> Kamachi is a sick robot </br></br>  <br>At least they're better than your taste.</br>  <br><br>It's okay if other girls do it, but not okay for Misaka. Right, we get it.</br></br>  <br>I literally despise most of (if not all) of Touma and Mikoto's interactions. I love Mikoto as a character but she has god awful chemistry with Touma. I don't understand how their ship got so popular.</br>  <br><br>Mikoto x Kuroko<br>Touma x Index x Othinus<br>Tatemiya x Itsuwa<br>Knight Leader x Kanzaki<br>Aogami x Himegami<br><br>Perfect ends. Everyone is happy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, we know it's you. Leave now so we can be spared from your samefagging and that retard who spams "THK" all over the thread.</br>  <br>It does make it ok.</br>  <br> they </br>  <br> you <br>Is your tinfoil hat tight enough?</br></br>  <br>No, but it's vibrating like mad after this pic  was posted.</br>  <br>I think she's smarter, chararcters like misaki who aren't good at sports and manipulative are worse.</br>  <br>Stop baiting. She knows full well the kind of monster High Priest was after the first time. It's not a matter of intelligence, but pride for her. But most important, is not losing Touma to them hence her small outburst to stop Touma.</br>  <br> if other girls do it <br>Like who? How many times they did?</br></br>  Best Mummy won't appear.  <br> She knows full well the kind of monster High Priest was after the first time. <br>kek</br></br>  <br>I think she was implying that the battery being used to do tricks at the same time as her charging it would cause it to overheat.</br>  <br>Other girls haven't fired artillery at his fucking school. I was fine with the lightning but that pushed her into pre-hug Mugino tier insanity.</br>  <br>Didn't she suggest he take their advice in the first place?</br>  <br>Will misaka look like that in the future?</br>  <br> Index, Othinus, Kaori, Fukiyose, etc <br>Don't play dumb.</br></br>  <br>Misaki is much smarter than Mikoto. You just have to read her fight with Gensei to realize that.</br>  <br> taking gag comedy scenes literally <br><br>anon, you might have issues</br></br></br>  <br>Othinus literally killed Touma millions of times.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>rcL-FqGhEpV5p0OQWwA5Ww/<br>Haha oh wow.</br></wbr></br>  <br> comparing a six inch girl, a little girl, and fukiyose to the railgun <br>Don't try to bring in NT9, Othinus was his enemy at the time. Misaka has now reason to attack touma.</br></br>  <br>It's okay. She said she was sorry.</br>  <br>As his enemy, not a goddamn love interest.</br>  <br>Every girl in his harem has comedyhurt him. except itsuwa, she made him lunch.</br>  <br> now reason <br>damn it<br>No reason</br></br></br>  <br>When did she say that?</br>  <br>If she hasn't, then she's a fucking bitch.</br>  <br>Railguns are comedymurder.</br>  <br>Even if it's Touma's responsibility that she lives? Okay.</br>  <br>  With all the chaos in Denmark finally over, Kamijou took a deep breath and talked with Othinus, who was still trying to avoid Sphinx's wild hunt <br> " I must say, you were quite a bitch for putting me through so much shit for such a retarded reason" <br> Without even looking at him, the former Magic God replied <br> " Yeah, sorry" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Let it go, dude, it was just shit writing. Her using multiple railguns on toumas butt goes her entire character.</br>   People defend the Othinus cop out at the end of NT10 because "Touma will need someone to give him advice on magic gods" <br> Fairy Othinus is only present when St. Germain appears, then fucks off with the headcrab. <br> When actual magic gods appear, they themselves are the ones giving advice to Touma. <br><br>God fucking dammit, she could have gone out with a bang.</br></br></br></br>  <br> except itsuwa, she made him lunch. <br>Objectively best girl for Touma.<br><br>She is the only one that can give Touma some relief from all the violent whores surrounding him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Othinus is shit and will always be shit until she dies at which point she will be a dead shit.</br>  <br>A Railgun is slower than her usual lightning spears, you know. And it's slapstick comedy. You're not supposed to take it seriously when the whole mood and lighthearted tone is being shoved in your face.<br><br><br>Are you retarded? That wasn't comedy at all. It was serious and plot related. Comparison is invalid.<br><br><br>Slapstick violence is always harmless in comedy. Bites that should kill a person, punches that sends people flying away, and lighting blasts that are lethal, they're harmless when it matters in comedy. Mikoto's Railgun is no different. Stop grasping at straws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Romance <br> In TAMNI </br>  <br><br> "Yeah, sorry" <br><br>Oh. Alright then.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this mad Mikotofag <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Itsuwa is boring shit.</br>  <br>I agree with most of you said but you're trying too hard, also consider this is /a/. If they get mad at a girl for smacking a dense MC, a missed Railgun is Holocaust</br>  THK gets his ball rolling and the thread is taking a turn for the worst. Looks like it's time to bail for awhile.  <br>I'm not even a mikotofag you funking retard. I hate shipping especially with Touma and hope he dies (for real) horribly as a kissless virgin</br>  <br>See you next thread</br>  <br> the thread is taking a turn for the worst <br>It was already shit by the 40th post</br></br>  <br> still mad </br>  <br> Objectively best girl for Touma. <br>I'm a mikotofag and this is just true. Pure maiden deserve to win.</br></br>  <br>Hamazura and Takitsubo are a couple tho</br>  <br> THK <br>dank</br></br>  <br>Itsuwa reminds me of best gril from Nardo.<br>And she won for that reason alone.</br></br>  <br>I'm not mad about Mikoto if that's what you're implying faggot. I hope the ship sinks and burns along with all the ones surrounding Touma</br>  <br> still super mad <br><br>Go take chill pill bro. You know the ships aren't going anywhere until the last volume.</br></br></br>  <br> He should be asleep after 5 hours. Come back then, bro. </br>  <br>Best girl never wins ;_;</br>  Too bad that ship they landed on didn't sink.  What a fantastic thread.<br>And while we're at it, what an utterly useless power.</br>  <br>Nope, they're all going to sink one by one. Some of them will get sunk twice.</br>  You know, my biggest gripe with the novels right now is that there doesn't seem like a "last novel" to look forward to, or if there is, it's too distant. What's the endgame here?  <br>Oh wow, this is some next level paronia shit.</br>  <br>The way she looks here reminds me of that bitch from mekakucity actors.</br>  <br> paranoia* </br>  <br>Aleister getting rid of all these magic faggots.</br>  <br>The very reason why I finally dropped One Piece and Bleach. I still read NT because  muh waifu  but frankly, the excitement I used to get from the series is gone. Nothing will ever surpass WW3.</br>  Itsuwa is objectively best wife material  <br> they're all going to sink one by one <br>Not the ones that matter.</br></br>  <br> that image quality <br> SAMPLE <br>You don't deserve her.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they will. And I'll enjoy the shipperfag tears and the cries of "B-but muh waifu!!!"</br>  <br>How long is that gonna take? It's been a long time.</br>  <br>You sound upset. Did the loss of a favorite girl in another series or the impossibility of your favorite winning in this one turn you into a bitter fag towards shipping?</br>  <br>Not at all. Raildex shipperfags ruin every goddamn thing so naturally the are to be hated</br>  <br><br><br>Nice girls with boring and dull personalities are always inferior or worst girl.</br></br></br>  As a AccelxMikoto shipper, I apologize.  As a Misakafag, I want to see her get physically injured for once. It doesn't have to be life-threatening but brutal enough for her to awaken/whip up a new trump card, like in those battle shonen manga. Or maybe she'd be critically wounded and Touma comes to her rescue. C'mon Kamachi, there's so much you can do with this.<br><br>Another thing. Level 5s tend to power up after they get rekt.<br> Accelerator was shot in the head <br> Kakine was fridge'd <br> Mugino was cyborg'd <br> Misaki was fucked up by Gensei and Co. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a bitchfag with shit taste </br>  <br>For what</br>  <br> introduce Magic Gods <br> Powerups are miniscule <br><br>No one from the science side stands a chance. It's not even a fight. Aleister really needs to get his shit together, because whatever he's doing isn't working.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Forget it. Mikoto is muh super speshal snowflake who can never do wrong or get hurt or lose something meaningful to her.<br><br>You'll see how this "development" about her realizing the distance between her and Touma in NT3 will be glossed over in the next novel and the status quo will remain untouched.</br></br></br>  Chapter is completed  So if Touma grabs Neph's hand he would have gain power? And misaka stop him?<br>oh well</br>  <br> implying the Level 5s won't get rekt again and power up again <br>Remember how Accelerator said espers get stronger after they battle an equally strong/stronger opponent? Like he came up with the plasma storm in his first fight with Touma right after he was knocked flat. I'm thinking we can see further innovation from them.</br></br>  <br><br>At this point ToumaxMikoto is so far off the rails we might as well get her with Accelerator so we can have the entire collection in one place.</br></br>  <br>Too bad Touma says otherwise. And leaving your bad and subjective opinion aside, Itsuwa would be objectively the perfect match for Touma to soothe his broken soul and give him the peaceful life he wants. Plus she is physically attractive to him.</br>  <br> implying Accelerator/Mikoto happening wouldn't improve the series </br>  <br>That wasn't the proxy magic god offer, it was the "Neph n' Niang kill HP themselves but blow up the city" offer.</br>   Talking shit about Othinus <br><br>But she's kind, probably the kindest girl in Index</br></br>  <br>What would Accelerator have done?</br>  Kamikotofags BTFO.  <br>Is that so?</br>  <br><br>Please get your narutofag shit out of here. Don't need to degrade this place.</br></br>  <br>As I see it, any innovation would only bring an esper up to Fiamma levels, and clearly that isn't enough. Magic gods are on another plane.</br>  <br> implying Index isn't just the Naruto of the LNs </br>  “What do you mean, Nephthys? I’m trying Imagine Breaker on myself just like you.”<br><br>“Then why are you using his left hand? It’s only in his right.”<br><br>“Oh, I thought any body part worked as long as you touched your breasts with it.”<br><br>“Niang-Niang, that’s completely backwards.”<br><br>Something burst from Mikoto’s temple.<br><br>If she had to say what irritated her the most, it was how the pointy-haired boy did nothing to stop the sudden situation.<br><br>“What. Do. You. Think. You’re-…!!!???”<br><br>She never finished her furious shout.<br><br>Before she could, Niang-Niang (who was still meaninglessly pressing Kamijou Touma’s left hand to her flat chest) pointed her baggy sleeve toward Mikoto in annoyance.<br><br>That was all she did.<br><br>A thick blade shot from her sleeve and mercilessly stabbed into the center of Mikoto’s chest.<br><br>“Wha-?”<br><br>She had no idea what this meant.<br><br>She was filled with confusion.<br><br>“Ah?”<br><br>The first thing to pierce into the girl’s chest looked like a crescent-shaped blade on the end of a spear.<br><br>But that was not the only one. Now that Mikoto was pinned in place, a great number of weapons shot out to tear, pierce, and slice through every part of her body.<br><br>A frenzied rush of dull sounds continued for some time.<br><br>She felt no pain and she shed no blood, but she felt dizzy at the definite fact that she had been “stabbed”. This was not a mental manipulation like the #5 used. This was physically happening. Dark unease oozed out from the depths of her mind and quickly spread to every corner of her brain.<br><br>The result had already arrived, but it was such an extreme situation that the physical phenomena could not keep up.<br><br>It was just like a shockwave reaching the surroundings only after an object had moved at supersonic speeds. It was like the rumble of thunder arriving only a few seconds after the flash of lightning.<br><br><br>What a weakling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Th-then…” <br><br> Hesitantly, Mikoto finally spoke up from behind Kamijou. <br><br> “Why can’t you deal with him? You know that weird old man, right? Then you go capture him and leave!” <br><br> Nephthys and Niang-Niang’s response was incredibly simple. <br><br> They acted like Academy City’s #3 was not even there. <br><br> “We want you to stop the High Priest, so we’ll give you the information you need. But don’t expect us to do anything directly.” <br><br> “Wait…” <br><br> Kamijou cut in without thinking. <br><br> Mikoto was still so shocked she did not have it in her to speak again. <br><br> But the two Magic Gods did not seem to mind very much. <br><br> “Well, if you tell us to do it, we will. But only if we receive that prayer from our cute little Kamijou-chan. Of course, that would end up with at least Academy City…no, this entire archipelago at the bottom of the sea. You know why, don’t you? A fight between us and the High Priest would be a battle between Magic Gods.” <br><br> “Wait.” <br><br> The two Magic Gods were entirely cheerful. <br><br> They sounded just like someone speaking to a friend in class. <br><br> But that was exactly why each and every word caused Mikoto to shrink down. <br><br> They felt like physical blows to the girl who was left all alone. <br><br> The two Magic Gods were cruelly erasing her presence from their mind and acting like she was not there.  <br><br>This entire volume man, isn't Kamachi being a bit too rough slapping her like this all at once? He had all of New Testament to do this at a slower pace. Now the NT10 scene looks kinda out of place because it made it look like things were going in a whole different direction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Next enemies are from the Pure World </br>  <br> implying this place isn't degraded already </br>  <br><br>Trust me kid, there are much more worse shit out than Index LN.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad Mikoto is receiving a taste of her own medicine now. It's just too sweet.<br><br>Take that, bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't kid yourself. She's shit.</br>  What would Hamazura do?  <br>None are as popular and long as Index, which is why the Naruto comparison sticks.</br>  <br> Index <br> Popular <br><br>I know you're talking about the title, but this makes me laugh and feel sad.</br></br></br></br>  I really don't see how anyone, longtime shipper or not, can still think kamikoto is happening  <br>It's popular enough for new volumes to be fully translated within 1-2 weeks after release.</br>  <br><br>Talking about the titular character.</br></br>  <br>I don't see how anyone, longtime shipper or not, can still think a Kamachi protagonist is actually going to get into a relationship.<br><br>The closest protagonist is Jack from Waltraute, it that was less a serious relationship as it was Jack the pure and innocent shota thought having a valkyrie wife was the manly and cool thing to do.<br><br>And Hamazura isn't a major protagonist, just a side one. The major protagonists in Kamachi works never get near touching the word 'commitment'.</br></br></br></br></br>   there are those who think Mikoto is slowly going through what Touma did at NT 9   <br><br> They acted like Academy City’s #3 was not even there. <br><br> misaka thought she was monster. <br>This was funny, now misaki and aihama are the only level fives who haven't gotten blown the fuck out by the magic side.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He can freely manipulate the intersection of the Six Paths <br>Are you sure he is dead?<br>He could be simply reborn himself later.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sometimes, I forget what the point of Academy City is.</br></br>  <br>Probably either tried and failed to kill HP or grabbed LO and flown straight out of the city</br>  <br> Being a tool for Aleister's keikaku, like most thing in this series,<br> Seriously, I need more of best girl Aleister.</br></br>  <br>Nah he fell at first sight for Waltraute, rather than because having a Valkyrie wife would be awesome<br><br>Though it's still not really serious a relationship yet since he's still a pretty innocent young boy, and Waltraute is a kind of a meathead with how obsessed she is with competitions, and how unknowing she is of basic romantic relationship having details</br></br></br>  <br><br>To contain TouMANS right arm.</br></br>  <br>Aleister. Espers are just part of his keikakku.</br>  <br>She will be NT's Accelerator   and hopefully somehow end up connected to him </br>  <br>The Pure World has no magic, the fuck'd be the point?</br>  <br>At least she has more chances than misaki.</br>  <br>If Nephthys is really an Egyptian mummy, why isn't she all dried out like High Priest?</br>  <br> It feels like he can do anything. Is it a waste of time to even give it serious thought!? <br>No shit, sherlock.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>js06 already confirmed that spoiler was bull</br>  <br>Her internal organs were removed. That's about it.</br>  <br>She probably achieved godhood immediately after death.</br>   Touma mans up <br> Gets thrown out the moment those two show up <br><br>At least he tried.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Well, his keikakku isn't looking too hot right now.</br></br></br></br>  So, does peoples who doesn't like Misaka still called THK?  <br><br>But that just makes her a corpse with no internal organs, you aren't a proper mummy until you've been preserved.</br></br>  <br>I admit I had serious hopes that it could happen back when I was a naive newfag getting into the franchise thanks to the first season of Railgun. I even thought things would go smooth with NT2 and NT3 pushing Mikoto into a more important role. Oh boy how wrong I was. I'm well aware her chances are 0 and this book only confirms that, but I'd like to see at least a resolution before the last volume, even if ends with her getting turned down.</br>  I find it hard to believe Alister would turn right side up over Fiamma but not be doing anything here.  <br> Niggah, he just killed the Magic Gods and so far the keikaku only had some small troubles, like Hamazaura.<br> Though I want to see how will he deal with the unexpected element that is Kamisato Takeru.</br></br>  <br>It's magic gods, I don't have to explain shit.</br>  <br>Touma will save him</br>  <br><br>Via  scarf? </br></br>  <br>Right, and you don't become a Buddha in one lifetime or survive starving yourself to death.<br>What are you getting at, Anon?</br></br>  <br> He already fight them at full power and fucked them up, now he just needs to let Kihara doge do his job.</br>  <br>How can Touma save him when he can't even save himself? ;_;</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br> Maybe she failed at mummification just like High Priest failed at becoming a Buddah.</br>  <br>  or survive starving yourself to death. <br>High Priest didn't, though. He legitimately died. It's just that the death didn't take.</br></br>   “When you think about it, he’s been controlling dirt this entire time. In that case, we should have assumed he was searching for us using the same thing he uses to attack.” <br>Well, that's actually pretty smart. And I here I thought High Priest could do anything because he's a magic god and not just limited to using dirt.</br>  <br>Why bother? He just extremely weakened them, killed Zombie who is apparently one of their kin, and all they did was laugh and go about business as normal.<br><br>What's the point of worrying over a punch of idiots who can't even realize they're getting fucked over pretty hard? Especially High Priest. He gives even less fucks than the other two, and that's a goddamn achievement.</br></br></br>  <br>The keikaku doesn't involve the current espers having a big slapfight with magicians. He's going to cripple them with the AIM field, raise a few espers or at least Accel to crazy powerlevels at the last minute, and nuke them all at once.</br>  <br>That's a different matter, though. Being turned into a mummy is just what people in Egypt did after death (though only the wealthy ones got the really nice mummy stuff, the poor ones just got wrapped up in cheap cloth and stuck in a hole or something. Been a while since I studied my mummology).</br>  <br>It's not like each magic god is a copy paste of each other, they each have their own sets of beliefs and abilities cranked up way past the maximum it was supposed to be.<br><br>Othinus specialized in fighting and war, for example. The only things the gods have in common is they all seem to have excessive knowledge (except none of them seem to fully understand IB) and a stupid amount of raw power.</br></br></br>  <br> He could do everything back when he was a full power Magic God, but due to Aleister fucking him up now he has to use regular god-tier magic.</br>  <br>He never said espers get stronger after they battle an equally strong opponent. You make it sound like its a rule.<br><br>Accel said fightning a strong opponent is the best way to evolve because it forces him to go out of his confort zone to win. He came up with the plasma storm because Touma forced he to do something else than just reflect and walk up to people so they die.<br>And fightning strong people and evolving goes for everyone, you wont improve if you keep stomping ants, its not esper only or something like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, but they had this whole deal about the kind of things you needed to actually reach eternal life, so failing at that wasn't that difficult.<br> Not to mention that pharaohs were considered living gods already.</br></br>  <br> mummology <br>There are classes on mummys?<br> Do you know how to mummify people? </br></br></br>  <br>I find it hilarious how little they care about losing their powers.<br><br>They can't do anything right now, nyang said they could destroy the world right now but not put back together. That seems like it their phase fuckery and reality warping is gone. Also each god was different like how othinus could only create things or crowley needed info on all the gods.</br></br></br>  <br>Did they ever stage a massive tournament of slightly mutated Kakine clones to make him evolve through natural selection?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334420 <br> Styil <br> winning a fight <br> Bullshit</br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't know how to mummify people </br>  <br> I find it hilarious how little they care about losing their powers. <br>Magic Gods are arrogant out the ass or just stupid.<br> Aleister claims he's going to kill them and shows them Zombie completely fucked up and probably dead, and then weakens them <br> Lolk let's go sightseeing in Aleister's back yard <br><br>At this point it has to just be stupidity, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Nyang-Nyang doesnt use underwear <br>Goddamit Kamachi, you make a qt3.14 use a chinese dress without underwear and kills her in the same chapter.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334331 <br><br>Please don't</br></br>  <br>The same novel maybe but not the same chapter, chapter 3 is over</br>  <br>Remember: if they live past the volume they're introduced in, they're likely not getting killed. Just how Kamachi works.</br>  <br>She was a shitty loli and deserved to die.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334477 <br> Acqua sprains his ankle while running away from Birdway <br> kek<br><br> Frog Doctor injuring Shiage and leaving him to die <br> Niggah, that's out of character as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that High Priest was introduced last volume</br>  <br>Cliffhanger introductions don't count.</br>   “Ah ha ha! Sorry, sorry. You sure were traumatized by that business with Othinus, Kamijou-chan!!” <br> Niang-Niang held her small belly with her baggy sleeves and burst out laughing with tears in her eyes. Nephthys could only sigh in exasperation. </br>  <br>Their motivation is literally they don't want to do any harm. If crowley's spell made them weak enough that they would fuck up the world just by existing they would probably be grateful.</br>  <br> He was actually introduced at the end of NT10.</br>  <br>Nyang Nyang is the first one then.</br>  <br>Fair enough, I suppose I didn't count it then because we didn't even know what they looked like</br>  <br>He should do things that will specifically illicit an emotional response from them.<br><br>What could be done to piss off High Priest though?<br><br>Wait a minute, if he's obsessed with destruction, then something that can't be destroyed should bother him. What if he attempts to attack the windowless building?</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone gets a bad end.  <br> Windowless building gets attacked <br> It shoots up into space <br> Aleister's plan continues. He doesn't give a fuck about Academy City. </br></br></br>   HP at the crane game   <br>That actually made me thing.<br>Nephthys said that all magic gods' base motivation is saving everyone, but that salvation becomes an absolute dictatorship.<br>And since there's multiple magic gods, it's better if they just don't do anything to avoid causing universe-ending conflicts. Which works toward saving people.<br>But existing itself as a magic god influences people whether they do anything or not.<br><br>But since they haven't killed themselves to save the most people or at least affect people the least, that means they at least have some desire to live, right? So they're like Touma and his NT10 'it bothers me' rant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334477 <br> Touma receives an explosive from an unknow sponsor <br>Oh god, we know what he can do with this novel.</br></br>  <br>Mein nigger.<br><br>Itsuwa or death.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking crane games just have too much lure</br></br>  <br>You retarded?</br>   they’re the weapons used by the sages in an ancient Chinese novel, but there are plenty of similar things lying around <br>What novel would that be?</br>  <br>Probably Journey to the West.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334697 <br> Kanzaki kills Acqua <br> She got her rematch</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334697 <br> Headcrab overhears Suzushina Yuriko and Touma talking in the distance. <br>bites were given that day.</br></br>  <br> UHH MUH WAIFU HAVE A CRUSH </br>  That would not be a problem for anyone, but…<br><br>“No!!!!!!”<br><br>A sharp yell cut through the gentle downward-sloping atmosphere.<br><br>It came from Misaka Mikoto.<br><br><br>Just had to ruin the fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   They acted like Academy City’s #3 was not even there. <br>This volume is becoming self aware about the power creep.</br>   “Why did he…?” <br><br> “?” <br><br> “Why did he go that far?” <br><br> This had nothing to do with strategizing. <br><br> It was an honest question. <br><br> Nephthys replied as if it was nothing. <br><br> “Isn’t that obvious? The only reason any priest aims to rid himself of his worldly desires is to save the people. In other words, he wanted to save the entire world.” <br><br> “Wha-…?” <br><br> “Ah ha ha! Pretty much all of the Magic Gods are the same, y’know? But the salvation our overwhelming power brought was twisted. Or I guess you could say salvation from an individual is no different from an absolute dictatorship. Then again, the High Priest’s story may be one of the worst.”  <br><br>It all makes sense now.<br>Touma will become a Magic God. And with all Magic Goddesses wanting his T, he will be the supreme Harem King of Magic Gods, ultimate being that creates and destroys worlds with his divine dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Magic? Magic God? <br><br> She did not understand the words everyone else was using. She could not share in their meaning, she could not imagine what they were talking about, and she could not keep up. That fact was a powerful blow. <br><br>IT'S FUCKING MAGIC. WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND?</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128334805 <br> Headcrab not going to the Feast <br> Touma and Kanzaki are the only ones that went </br></br>  <br>Mikoto a shit.

Don't even need magic gods when his own mind is breaking him down.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if this is true and if they are irrelevant otherwise</br>   Well, despite what I said, if you really you don’t have enough strength, call our names. If you give an appropriate sacrifice, we can restrain the High Priest in a direct confrontation between Magic Gods <br> If you give an appropriate sacrifice <br>W-What would that be?</br></br>  <br>His virginity, probably.<br>What else could it be? He has nothing of value with him or around him.</br></br>  <br>His first time.</br>   She had felt he would truly leave for some place she would never be able to reach. <br>I'm afraid, Mikoto, that Touma is already heading to a place where not can reach.</br>  <br><br><br>Seems like a good deal.</br></br></br>  <br> that Touma is already heading to a place where not can reach. <br>What do you mean already? She missed that fucking bus ages ago. Ages ago to Touma, anyway.</br></br>   The stars can be plucked from the sky so easily, so why are you so desperate to reach them? It’s not even remotely logical, but humans are creatures filled with that sort of passion, aren’t they? <br><br>It would seem like Nephthys is saying that Touma is like an unreachable star to Misaka.</br></br>  <br> infinite stamina <br><br>It would be heaven up until his balls shrivel and his dick goes numb.</br></br></br>  <br> It’s not even remotely logical <br>How can these magic gods speak of logic when they act like total retards?</br></br>  <br>They are so powerful they don't give a fuck.</br>  <br> even Hamazura's getting roughed up <br>Damn, I thought that dozy bitch was a gentle sort.</br></br>  <br>Don't take them too seriously, half the time they're spouting shit that doesn't make sense. And it's not like they know everything either.<br><br>Neph wouldn't have tried to use IB to fix Aleister's spell if she understood IB couldn't, and Niang-Niang didn't even understand IB aside from 'Touma breaks magic and stuff' without knowing about it even being in one hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto a cute.</br>  <br>Power clearly isn't the whole story since Alister is stronger than him but he gives lots of fucks.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I also think Nephthys is warning Mikoto that love is fleeting.</br>  <br>Takitsubo is most of the time spaced out, sleepy, slow, and gentle.<br>But whatever Hamazura even remotely starts getting close to a girl aside from Saiai or Mugino (as in getting close to Fremea the loli or a fucking AI program) she goes yan mode.<br><br>She's an AIM Stalker and a decent normal stalker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From a perspective of an immortal magic god, it would seem so. Heck, to the High Priest, everything is fleeting.</br>  <br> he gives lots of fucks <br> lets them wander, wreck his city and harass his Touma </br></br>  <br>I think Niang-Niang knew exactly what she was doing.</br>  <br> aside from Saiai or Mugino <br>wait, does that mean she'd be up for a 3-way/4-way with them?</br></br>  <br>science side weak as fuck</br>  <br>Science has killed two magic gods and fucked two more over. That's far more than the magic side has done.</br>  <br> I think Aleister and Noukan need their own category, since they are the only people in the Science Side who actually get shit done.</br>  <br>i mean esper</br>   Hesitantly, Mikoto finally spoke up from behind Kamijou. <br><br> “Why can’t you deal with him? You know that weird old man, right? Then you go capture him and leave!” <br><br> Nephthys and Niang-Niang’s response was incredibly simple. <br><br> They acted like Academy City’s #3 was not even there.  <br><br>AHAHAHAHA. Misaka total BTFO in this volume</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and they used magic to do it</br>  <br>So was nt9 actually a hidden training arc because i dont remember touma doing all this before...</br>  <br> people <br>But one's a dog.</br></br>  <br> He probably experienced a world where he was the best bike stunt guy ever, only to have a terrible accident and spend the rest of his life in a comma while he was conscious of his surroundings.</br>     The Magic Gods had not been counting her as part of the conversation, so she spoke to Kamijou.   Just imagine. If Touma played the village role and got his hands on Acrobike safely. Who the fuck could catch this motherfucker?<br><br>He's been doing even the most difficult tricks on his first try and has some damn good leg strength and stamina. And he's an expert at using his surroundings to shake off (and seemingly potentially be lethal) his pursuers.</br></br>  <br> village <br>I meant villain but need to put down the fucking rpgs.</br></br>  <br>Well, who better to practice on than some of the slipperiest motherfuckers in the city? Why else would they have the delta force be the villains.</br>  <br>You're silly.</br>  <br><br>It's possible.</br></br>  Could someone point me to the part where Mikoto was BTFOd? I'm at work and have no time to weed through the thread.  <br><br>Not our problem.</br></br>   “After all, he’s rotted so much, but he’s perfectly satisfied with where he is ‘now’. If the emperor of the Emperor’s New Clothes was proud of being naked, then there would be no stopping him with words, right?” <br><br> “Ah ha ha!! Neeephthyyys ! That doesn’t sound very convincing coming from someone who’s naked except for some bandages!” <br><br> “You aren’t any better since you don’t wear any underwear.”  <br><br>Based Kamachi</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>I'll bite. How exactly is that considered "BTFO" when it isn't about shipping or anything of the sort? Magic Gods ignoring lowly humans who aren't even on their radar as far as they're concerned since everyone is weaker or not important to them seems normal to me. The Magic Gods only care about Touma, and no one can even challenge them, not even Fiamma against a Magic God who was depowered and nerf to insane levels to barely fit into the world.<br><br>Also  said in the previous thread.

Would it help with kanji recognition? Because that's my main issue.

Those people usually learn about 20-30 new cards a day (because they're learning without context), whereas if you know the Kanji beforehard, you could do as much as 70 on a normal day and 120 or more if you're motivated.<br>DJT is okay for asking light questions but usually shit for serious ones.<br><br> has posted some links, I could link you some other shows if you want. Just name the anime, I'll see if I managed to obtain a copy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, not really. What i do for kanji is i just look up the stroke order, and use my finger to scratch it in my skin like 20 times, helps recognition a lot. spend time to learn each kanji</br>  <br>We're never going to make it, are we?</br>  I feel like I'm not getting the feel for the language...<br><br>I don't know many words and I know most of the grammer, although I still can't understand many texts by just going through the explanations and the dictionary alongside them.<br><br>What am I doing wrong? should I maybe try to learn from something like a VN? Manga maybe?</br></br></br></br>  Is this a second foreign language for anyone? I don't have much oral practice but I try to make sentences in my head whenever I'm thinking about something. Problem is, I'm running into a "second-language" hard-wiring I apparently have. Things start happening like 私 habe 食べ物 gern. And other shit like that.  <br>I've no idea why you're suggesting memrise given that Anki and memrise are both SRS programs and Anki is far superior to any flashcard program I have tried or encountered. <br>What specifically in memrise solved your problem?<br>I've used anki till now with 93% retention for both Young and Mature cards and I think the CSS and HTML and notes-&gt;cards flexibility of Anki helped me a lot with that, correct me if I'm wrong but based on what I've seen with memrise, it doesn't have the capability to that..<br><br> I can usually remember what the words mean if I were to see them in hiragana <br>I wonder why it's the opposite for me, i.e., i usually have lower retention rates for vocab written in pure hiragana<br>e.g.<br>左様なら vs さようなら<br>いる、要る、居る<br>ある、有る<br>i think it has to do with me being able to associate the meanings of the Kanji with the vocab, the same might work for you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not other guy, but I can remember what words mean if it's in Kanji but can never remember how the fuck to pronounce it, especially those ones with 3-4 readings.</br>  <br>It takes time. I learned grammar early on but it still took a long time before I got to the point where I could understand most of what I read, and I had to do a lot of reading practice to get there.<br><br>I think when first starting to read it's best to find something that's already translated and open both the raw and the translation. Try reading first and then compare what you thought (or didn't) it said</br></br></br>  <br>Those are the hardest for me i always forget them if they dont contain a kanji.<br><br>じゃぶじゃぶ じゃんじゃん すべすべ かんかん きょろきょろ くしゃみ ぐずぐず くすぐったい がやがや せっかち すらすら うきうき<br>and so on and so forth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Z4FQLNWcpN</br>  <br>Thats so stupid i had to chuckle a bit.</br>  <br>I've been learning English since I was around 6 years old (thanks Cartoon Network). I also "studied" German in high school with like nothing but two sentences I ever used remaining ("Ich weiss es nicht." "Es interessiert mich nicht.") after all these years. I sometimes insert German words when trying to formulate a Japanese one, though it also happened that I said すみません instead of sorry cause of the 's' interfering. The more proficient you become in the languages the less it will happen. Just put up with it, it's natural, your brain is just trying to help you.</br>  <br>Don't try too hard memorizing too many facts at once. Stick to the minimum information principle (http://www.supermemo.com/articles/<wbr>20rules.htm).<br>You could study those other pronunciations (most of them are kunyomi I'm sure) in your vocab deck.<br>For example<br>生<br><br>生まれる<br>生む<br>生える<br>生かす<br>生ずる<br>生じる<br>etc... the list goes on<br><br>Some people make the terrible mistake of trying to memorize all of those AT ONCE. You'll eventually get stumped and demotivated, even if you manage to memorize the info in that one card I'm sure you won't for other cards because it's too much information. It essentially breaks rule #10 (Avoid enumerations).<br><br>I've made this mistake in the past and it resulted in too many relearn cards piling on top of new cards and review cards. I was aware of the 20 rules but being the pretentious asshole I am I tried to subvert it to no avail.<br><br>The only things you'll have to memorize are the meaning/s, the onyomi and a few kunyomi readings (up to 2 will do). Study the other kunyomis as separate cards in you vocab deck.<br><br>What deck are you using btw? You might find the mnemonics from the KanjiDamage to be qutie useful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> What specifically in memrise solved your problem? <br>having it give me tests when i learn a new word that get greater in difficulty helps me remember the new word much better then being told. here's a new word, try and remember it</br></br>  <br>Sounds interesting..<br>Is it something filtered decks can't solve?</br></br>  So 運動場 appears twice in a row in the core 2k/6k.  <br>don't know what a filtered deck is so i can't answer this question<br><br>it gives a bunch of community mnemonics, so you can pick the best one. it starts off with multiple choice, gets harder then asks you to remember the word. my retention rate is insane, compared to me forgetting a new word in anki probably 10 times before remembering it</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which, has anyone else had a look at the kanji deck cor くん posted? Um, the post was  I've been thinking about going and doing core6k to touch up on vocab but a lot of it I already know and last time I tried going through core I gave up out of boredom. I gave this kanji and vocab deck/s a quick look over and they are set up to be done in tandem, like 4 vocab cards using the next due kanji in the kanji deck. <br><br>Trying to learn kanji out of context never worked for me and to an extent it hasn't been all that helpful and picking up readings and being able to produce the correct kanji from memory from recognition hasn't been working very well. Going to give this deck a trial for a few months and post feedback. It is the first time I've seen this sort of arrangement with kanji and vocab in anki before. Might be more than just a novelty.</br></br></br>  <br>I see, it's somewhat similar to koohii's SRS where you also get to pick from community mnemonics. It has it limits though, especially when it comes to studying more obscure decks such as vocabulary decks, but yeah I can see its advantages because it's a feature I've also wanted.</br>   tfw listening to your favourite music <br> tfw getting everything right in todays anki cards <br><br>やった!</br></br></br>  <br>it gets better the further along you go and the more japanese gets carved into your head</br>  Not that I'm going for a few months yet, but for when I am in Japan, I have a query for you DJT clever people.<br><br>How would I ask for a Grade 0 haircut all over?

It is the way this deck has a production side based on the vocab which perked my interest. I've only reviewed 40 vocab cards/10 kanji cards but it is more enjoyable and difficult/rewarding than learning a bunch of words using the same kanji in an optimized order. It could just be a novelty so I'm going to give it a month or two and see how it goes.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's your mother tongue, Anon?</br>  <br>iphones can do it by default from the settings, you just have to set the keyboard. Clicking the globe in the bottom left switches from Japanese to English to Portuguese.</br>  tfw active vocabulary is shit so you need to use google every time you want to write something in Japanese to someone  <br>I grew up with both English and German. I know French because we had to learn it in school, though my production is way behind my ability to understand it.<br><br>I just noticed that sometimes Japanese words instead of French words came to mind when I was looking for a word in French. Though that seems to have stopped happening some time ago.</br></br></br>  <br>lel, why would anyone use that shitty kana keyboard instead of qwerty</br>  <br>people seem to dislike turning their phones sideways to get the bigger keyboard. I have no idea why. I turn mine sideways every chance I get</br>  <br>Probably to emulate flip-phones. You get used to it pretty fast. I don't think there is a way to change the japanese keyboard to qwerty format on iphone.<br><br><br>I don't know about that but I do think of the meaning of the word in English instead of Portuguese. Obviously I'm learning with an English deck but I find this caveat humorous.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In Japan (also Korea if anyone cares) you spend a lot of time using your phone with one hand (eg. on the train). This might be a more Korean than Japanese thing, but it also makes it really easy to type without looking too (eg. in class writing with one hand and texting with the other). There's also the fact that people are just used to the way they typed on their flip phones, and since compared to the Latin alphabet, 1 character holds a lot more value in a syllabary, the relative efficiency is a lot higher compared to our understanding of "tap 3 times for a letter".</br></br>  <br>there is for iPhone</br>  <br>That's true. At least for japanese I did find the flick was a lot more intuitive than it would be for english</br>  <br>same here, I can sometimes do it with classical (even then, leaning towards baroque), but it just lowers my efficiency and I retain a lot better if I can completely focus on anki, but everyone's different I guess</br>  <br>I see, having two decks in tandem should be a good feature, but, mnemonics + radical breakdown is invaluable to me.</br>  <br>It was a little "tsu." So the "k" in "ka" is doubled.</br>  <br>As long as I'm listening to a song that is mostly instrumental it's fine. I don't know if it lowers my efficiency or retention rate but it helps with long anki grinds.</br>  <br>At least there are already some great resources and anki decks for that like RTK and Kanjidamage.</br>  How many words are enough?<br>When does it stop?</br>  Any good anki deck for business/technical vocabulary?  <br> words <br>no that's not how it works<br>study kanji<br>and grind grammar, there's like quadruple the material of any vocab deck you might know</br></br></br></br>  がんばれ！<br><br>彼女は待っている！</br></br>  <br> and grind grammar, there's like quadruple the material of any vocab deck you might know <br>Confirmed for not knowing japanese, don't take this person's advice. The proportion of grammar to vocabulary is much higher than "quadruple".</br></br>  <br><br><br>Just fucking start reading easy level material with a grammar guide and dictionary. It will get better. The common kanji will stick better in my opinion.</br></br></br>  Has anyone worked through Tobira?

Let's say a highschooler, those seem to know around 2000 Kanji, let's say one of them pick up a novel that contains around 2500 different Kanji, will he have to pick up his dictionnary to even be able to read all the words?<br><br>Isn't that stupid? Surely he's heard some of these words plenty of times IRL when watching TV or hearing adults talking among them... but because Kanji are stupid he's still forced to check a dictionnary. In the west a 8y old child can read any novels he wish to without having to stop once. Sure he might not be able to pick up the meaning of everything he's reading (though he might via context) but he won't have to stop every 5 minutes.</br></br>  <br> Are you insinuating anything before 1960 is "middle English"? <br>What is "gradual dissipation of archaic words"<br> Read more or maybe stop reading internet forums and read real books. <br>Did you even read my post?

Points 2 &amp; 3 still involve using a dictionary or other technology to even /be able/ to read something. This language is flawed, overcomplicated for absolutely no reason.</br>  <br>Don't know about novels but in VNs they usually have furigana for not so common to obscure kanji or readings.</br>  <br> Caveat: anything you don't enjoy is pretentious. <br>that's not how you use caveat, mate.</br></br>  <br> Implying the novel doesn't have furigana then (novels for adult don't). <br>They generally do for non-joyo kanji, unless they're academic material or something.

She was a completely manipulative slut who used Jesus Yamato's feelings for her to get revenge. Arguably her actions did actually help move the plot along. Still, a total whore.  This little cuntmuffin.  <br>Kishimoto actually likes her, he just can't write women so they don't come out as dumb cunts. All good females in Naruto are good because he didn't pay attention to them.</br>  <br>Flay is so fucking terrible i had actually purged her from my memory until just now.</br>  <br/>  <br>Would you not cum on her forehead?</br>  <br>No. I would shoot it with a gun.</br>  <br>Kishi reached a point where even he himself had realized that he had fucked up with Sakura's character and publicly admitted that she's "a horrible person", at which point he began upgrading Hinata to become more of the lead heroine in the series.</br>  <br> saying no to this <br><br>You're probably as much of a faggot as Sasuke.</br></br></br>   anyone shittier than pinkshit <br><br>nobodies more terrible than sakura. she fails more on parenting than sasuke</br></br>  <br>I'd rather say yes to this titfucking Hinata.<br><br>Also, calling Sasuke a faggot is an insult to people who really are gay.<br><br>Sasuke is just asexual and not to mention a complete autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh yeah we mention worse girl all the time, you're Just new</br>  <br>What I mean is that we don't shame worst girls as often as we should.</br>  Too easy    <br>Karin is not the mother</br>  <br>Sure you would but I didn't give you a choice.<br><br>If you wouldn't fuck Sakura, you're probably a faggot.

No harm done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>onee sans are always used goods though</br>     you will never discover your imouto touching herself while softly squeaking your name <br>Why even live</br>  <br>And yet they're still the best</br>  <br> Haru masturbating to Sora masturbating to him <br>We must go DEEPER.</br></br>  <br>He definately had the opportunity, but instead he fagged out and almost threw up.</br>  <br><br><br>Is the anime version worth the time or is this one of those VN or nothing type scenarios?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime is pretty solid. The final arc is fairly rushed, but overall it's a good watch. And pay attention to the music, it's fucking amazing.</br>  <br><br>God created only 2 people<br>We are the product of incest<br>Incest is bad <br>Let's kill God</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both worth watching as the scenario is different enough to warrant seeing both.</br>  <br>The anime is omnibus like Amagami so if you just want to watch Sora's route it's only like 4 episodes.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks, I'll start with the anime then jump into the VN after Grisaia</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Sorry man." <br> "No worries." <br>Except we're talking about women, and that's not how it went down at all.</br></br></br>  <br>That was such a bittersweet VN. I hated that I loved every heartwrenching moment of it.</br>  <br>But they would only have X chromosomes...<br>So there would only be gir-<br>Well. Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless the friend is catching you in the midst of delivering the fuck to your sister. And if the friend is in love with you, and, unlike the other friend who came with her, has no idea of what you two are doing.<br>I like how Nao was just "ehh. Guess i lose. Good luck"</br></br>  <br> ring-pop </br>  <br>Bad genes, don't try blaming it on incest.</br>    <br>best girl</br>  <br>That's not true at all and you don't have a single fact to support it.</br>  <br>  reading OHB story with  music link </br>  <br><br>Read the manga too, all three mediums are different enough to warrant seeing.<br><br>Akira is practically psychic yo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  You can actually get your girlfriend to call you onii-chan <br>that's a big pro</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously, this scene was great in the VN and manga, sad it was cut from the anime.</br></br>    <br><br>The one major problem with the manga is that the TL needed a bit of editing because typos are fairly frequent.</br></br>      <br><br>Psychic shrine maidens with a psychic cat, that shrine is magic.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320450 <br>Can second this experience. Niggas with no lil' sis will never understand.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I have a little sister and I would if I didn't already belong to Sora, go fuck yourself and all you other blanket stating faggots.</br></br></br></br></br>          <br>Do it, faggot. Fucking do her.</br>      <br>Your a year too late for spoiler courtesy.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Sorry but he turns her down in the manga.<br><br>Honest.<br><br> I'm lying. <br><br>Awww I wanted to post this with 112, fuckin fucked up abort.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> frommypointofviewthejediareevil.jp<wbr>g</wbr> </br>  <br>I want that ceiling fan.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I would like to point out that while it is a bad line it is a legit point of view.<br><br>It is a stupid point of view of course but no one ever said people can't have wrong opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br><br>And then Haru kind of ruins his high by thinking something that is pretty fucking horrible which shocks himself.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Seriously, too soon Haru.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320450 <br> Be me <br><br>Why the fuck do some people say this. <br><br>Who in the FUCK else would you possible be? Fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, Haru. You are so god damn stupid</br>  <br><br><br><br>Sometimes at least, he's pretty good at ruining the mood. At least he didn't say it out loud where Sora can hear it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So god damn stupid.</br>   be me <br> don't fuck my sister <br> cook </br></br>  not enough Disco milf in here.    <br>why is ryusats the most based ship? <br> two best grills <br> and they fuk </br></br></br>  <br>Senketsu dies too</br>  Sisters are for loving not sexing  <br>Shits deep. Harem done right.</br>  <br>aww yeah one of the better laffs</br>  Incest should be legal just like weed is, we have condoms and abortions now.  <br> just like weed is <br>Yeah, about that...</br></br>  <br> They have shared hardships, Battle thongs, and bodily fluids in canon. <br><br>Got to take that responsibility for Imouto.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did he do that to her?</br>  <br>Justice.</br>  But slutty sisters are the best...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333524 <br> :((( <br><br>Time to kill more chinese midgets.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333436 <br>Completely off topic, go to /gif/ or /b/ with that. In case anyone is wondering, the child actually lived.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333524 <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>   Dug through the archive for like an hour before I got frustrated, couldn't find anything about car accident anon saying he ran off with his Imouto.   <br>I remember Car-accident anon, hopefully he found a happy ending.<br><br><br>Yeah, shit like this always depresses me. Got a job, got games, got animu, content in being alone, but then these fucks come in and remind me of shit Im missing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Westermark <br><br>Westermark effect wouldn't even apply in Yosuga no Sora as they were separated in childhood.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333728 <br> This is /a/. You can't post anything that's not anime. <br>Yeah. That's literally the point. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Westermarck effect doesn't ever apply because it's bull.</br>    <br>Even gay incest?</br>  <br>Man and woman, siblings only.  Disgusting homo shit </br>  <br> Mutant Babies <br><br>This only happens if your family have the recessive genes that cause things like down syndrome or other disabilities.<br><br>Obviously you and your sister have a very high chance of sharing these genes, being blood related and all, so you have a high chance of ending up with a fucked up kid.<br><br>However if you don't have those genes everything is completely fine barring random mutation which takes many millions of births to even occur.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't even understand what the fuck happened in he latter portion of this series...</br>  <br><br>Stealth yandere is what happened and proof that the Megane is shit unless she is Nao.</br></br>  <br> if this imouto don't calm down I swear to God I'm gonna purify the fuck outta her </br>  <br> b-but Megane isn't shit <br> Megane attempts to destroy a Modulus which aren't even in production anymore <br><br>Fuck Megane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No need to be so rude, straightfag</br>  <br>Your faggot shit reminds me that my Imouto was a fujoshit too.</br>  <br><br>These anti-piracy ads are getting pretty serious yo</br></br>  <br>Imoutos are serious business.</br>  <br><br>Go smoke some more weeds Kozue.</br></br>  <br>NOKIA</br>  is incest punished with death sentence in some countries?  <br><br>Name of the band is giving a big hint.</br></br>  <br>I believe so.</br>  <br>I certainly hope so!</br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br>That's not a very nice thing to say.</br>    <br>In Germany, at least, it only counts as "real" incest (and thus prison time) if you have penis-in-vagina sex. As long as you and your sister stick to oral sex and anal, you're OK. In the same vein, homosex incest does not count as real incest and is not punishable by law.</br>  <br>I don't feel like taking a screenshot just to prove you're wrong.  Trying to find car accident anon saying he fled with his sister in the archive has drained me  Have a Kirino.</br>  <br>Isn't she his cousin?</br>  <br> states <br> countries <br>Pick one retard</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm American and I think you're a douchebag for thinking America is the only place on Earth.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but 2D.</br>  <br> Parents get no potential grandchildren/continuation of legacy <br> Flips the bird to human history and all the men whom helped build it. <br><br>2D or Not, yuri incest is scumtime as FUCK.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought you guys recently decriminalised sibling incest.</br>    <br>No, the government's ethics committee recommended that. Doesn't mean the govt has to listen to them.</br>  <br><br> Pick one retard <br><br>I picked one already you illiterate shittard.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Posting that flag is now considered a terrorist act anon, we are taking a cue from the Germans and are now pretending that the less savory parts of our past never occurred and we are blaming all bad things on a flag.</br></br>  <br>What if science babies are an option?</br>  <br>I'm really growing tired of this world and what it has done to my Imouto.</br>  <br><br>What did the world do to Kirino? Her series is over and barring whatshisface going back to it there's nothing anyone can do to ruin it.</br></br>  <br>I worry about this sometimes, I worry that the author will go back and ruin their ending.</br>  <br>If anything he'll make it even better.</br>  <br>Sequels have a tendency to spoil everything.</br>  <br>And most cases those who are incestfags doesn't even have siblings.</br>  <br>But I have an onee-san and  she knows I'm a siscon </br>  It is getting a little old to be honest. Kind of loses its taboo appeal when it seemingly gets shoved into everything.  <br>I disagree, that's like saying maids and miko are getting old and tired.</br>  <br> 3D sister not dead last <br>Looks like you don't have one, do you?</br></br>   Hearing Haru walks by her room. <br> Turn on the lights. <br> Do it loud. <br> Calling out his name. <br><br>Sora is pretty crafty in her own arc, Isn't she?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pick one retard <br><br>Okay. I pick you.</br></br></br>  <br>Is everyone with a mother/father complex also an orphan?</br>  sweeeet i like incest vns and doujin, but not any anime, so im not a degenerate  <br> Yosuga no Sora <br>wait this isn't /e/</br></br>  <br><br>Shhhh...anon. Not too loud.</br></br>  <br> mfw still having more webms </br>  <br>Well, I'm sold.</br>  <br>How'd she take it?<br><br>So that's the last from Ring-pop? I hope he made it and started living the good life.</br></br></br>    <br>  you are degenerate. <br><br>/pol/ on everything.<br>The day /pol/tards are removed from /a/ will be a great day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I say we remove a politics board all together and add a religion board to contain christfags</br>  <br><br>I somehow feel that the lesbian side of it is more degenerate than the incest part.</br></br>  <br> made it clear in subtle and indirect ways that she knows and does not feel the same, but she doesn't if I wrap my arms around her and rest my head on her shoulder</br>  <br>Anyone have a screencap of that one /a/non who impregnated his older sister?</br>  <br> Haven't watched a show <br> Lurk more <br>I don't think you know what that means</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's probably the best outcome if you got rejected. At least you can still act like bro and sis.</br>  <br>What. I have a visceral need for this now.</br>  <br>Sorry anon I lost my screencap when my hard drive got fried but I hope someone else has it</br>   incest is bad <br>Because we should have the right to tell consenting adults what they can and cannot do<br>Being human is suffering</br></br>  It's so fucking stupid that people try to police who I can and can't fuck. If I want to fuck my sister, and she wants to fuck me, then why should you care? My motto is, if you aren't killing, destroying peoples shit, stealing or raping, do what the fuck you want.  <br>No, you're the one that doesn't know what it means faggot. Saying &gt;hur dur just because I didn't know who Lelouch was because I haven't seen Code Geass doesn't mean I'm a newfag, is bullshit. It's common knowledge, you'd have to be new as fuck to not know who Lelouch is, and in the same capacity you'd have to be new as fuck to not know Satsuki and Ryuko are sisters. It's common knowledge because it's absolutely everywhere<br><br>Fuck off and lurk moar fag.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fundamentally right attitude, but you might fall prey to viewing things in way too simplistic ways.<br><br>Some things can be very indirectly harmful. (I'm not implying that incest is one of these.)<br><br>Sometimes so indirect that the only link is the fact that you contribute to a culture-wide mentality which harms some people you never knew existed, or harms them in such a way that even they themselves think is normal and acceptable (because they're also living in the same culture) so even they don't speak up themselves. For example this is the case with cultures that see sex as something inherently aggressive and such, calling it "fucking" etc., thinking that penetration defines sex. Women enjoy clitoral stimulation most, not sex. A very large number of women can't regularly orgasm from sex, because they and their partner both have no fucking idea what they're doing and think the woman should reach orgasm from being ruthlessly penetrated.<br><br>A less indirect example is /a/'s constant half-joking glorification of rapist attitudes, especially towards little girls. Recently some idiot in a loli thread suddenly started talking about how he'd like to fuck his 9 year-old sister. No matter how many people yell "2D only!" it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill <br> Common knowledge <br>When did shit series become common knowledge, anon?</br></br></br>  <br> it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished. <br><br>Fucking this. The "darkest corner of the internet" that is the 4chinz laughed and ridiculed other peoples' closet homosexuality, pedophilia, and autism. You used to expose your own retardation for other people to laugh at. And you would do the same for others. Now, it's become a hugbox and anyone who has a disagreeable attitude toward their "muhwaifu" and "muhloli" circlejerking is branded as a "normie". <br><br>Ironically, the loli fetish is becoming one of the most casual fetishes out there with an astounding number of tags in most boorus. And your average kid on LoL talks about having Janna as his "waifu". The average /a/utist is the true normie with an elitist facade. Fucking disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe when it aired and there were five threads for it at any given time?</br>  <br>The motto is for most situations, I don't have a particular ideology so I take social issues one at a time to form an opinion about. I can't put every single thing I have an opinion on in one motto, anon, that would be silly.</br>  <br>So you visit shit threads?</br>  <br>The only things that get spoilers are new events in the source materials, and info in the shows on simulcast. Spoilers aren't used that much because if you really don't want something spoiled you will watch said anime and not be on /a/. If you want to avoid spoilers don't go on /a/</br>  <br>mom x daughter incest is the purest form of love</br>  <br>I visit /a/, that's my point. You'd have to be deaf, dumb (and I don't mean mute either), and blind to not know these things.<br>lurk<br>moar</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like Kill la Kill and never visited threads. It's not like OP has always unavoidable spoilers. The fact you think shit series is so impactful everyone on /a/ should know it makes clear you have shit taste, and makes me very sad.</br>  Did you ever confess to your sister, /a/?  <br>I wish I could anon, but if I did and she said no I would probably kill myself, not even joking.</br>  <br>are you actually in love with your sister</br>  <br>I don't have a sister ;__;</br>  <br>No sister. I like incest as a fetish and have no compunctions against it in real life but I'm not feeling anything towards any of my relatives.</br>  <br>I wish I knew how to help.</br>  it's fine if it isn't vaginal<br>or atleast in germany it is.</br>   love my nee-san <br> confess to her <br> calmly states "Not with me." and leaves <br> pretends it never happened the next day <br>I guess that's the second best outcome you can hope for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I don't really know, I've never really loved anyone that I've dated, they've all been shallow and I think I only go out with most girls I do out of my desperate fear of being lonely. I know that I love my sister in a brotherly way and I care about her a lot, so maybe I'm mistaking regular brotherly love with romantic feelings.<br><br><br>It's okay, I'm beyond the point where I can be helped now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Ririko isn't canon </br>  <br> dated <br>get out normie</br></br>  <br> Brotherzoned <br>Sorry to here that anon.</br></br>  <br>It's the purest form of giving me a boner</br>  <br>If you don't like koikishi purely kiss episode 2, then you are confirmed homosexual. Regardless of stance on incest.</br>  <br>No, you.</br>  <br>I can't believe I read the entire pastebin<br>Was kind of nice story, somewhat wrecking to read as a neckbeard in a world where love is reserved for objectively better people.</br></br>  <br>Should've done it 7 years ago as it is far too late now.</br>  I watched pic related with my younger sister once neither of us realizing what it was. We only got thru episode 1.  <br>you blew your chance faggot</br>  <br>Better than that poor anon who got kicked out of his onee-san's house who he was living with and eventually she forgave him.  I wonder if he raped her afterwards. </br>  This is a cruel, murderous, 500 year old blood lusting vampire.  <br>The haughty 10yo with the short hair does things to my blood vessels.</br>  <br>Does the loli in a basket come free with the bike?</br>  <br>So she can reach breeding stock age?<br>Also I have a retarded question, but what is the proper order to watch the monogatari series? I know you start with bakemonogatari, but I am not sure where to go from there and is the source translated and printed somewhere or only available translated on the web?</br></br>  How is this not translated yet? It's Bloody Okojo's first monogatari doujin  <br> what is the proper order to watch the monogatari series? <br>Right now I can't really say there is one. If we could definitely say there won't be any more monogatari produced, then we might be able to come up with canon chronological episodes to watch. But as it is now, there are still wholes in the anime's continuity, so just watch it in the order it aired (Bake -&gt; Nise -&gt; Neko -&gt; Second Season -&gt; Hana -&gt; Tsuki)<br><br>I heard the source material got licensed to be translated, but as of now the only full translations you can find are on Baka-tsuki and I think the only book that's 100% is Kizu</br></br></br></br>  Is lolicon really a sickness ?  <br>Japan is free-er than America.<br>Well, "was" anyway. USA and moralfags have to "curb pedophilia" while shooting with a blindfold.<br><br>Vigilant mangakas like Ken Akamatsu are our only hope.</br></br></br></br>  you cant fuck drawings  <br>Nah<br><br>Aisha is much better. How can you not like black lolis?<br><br><br>Looks fine to me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It sucks that there are only a handful of artists that do toddlercon</br></br>  <br>I might be a hardcore lolicon, but even i think toddlercon is going too far. <br><br>but then, How can i judge when I'm judged just the same.</br></br></br>  Do you agree with the Prez?<br><br>Chapters 183 and 184 are up on yomanga for all of you slowpokes. <br><br>Japanese RAWs are out as well for 184, for those inclined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can kinda imagine that happening and I'm still going to laugh my ass off when it actually happens.</br>  I want the next arc to have new set of boy enrollees, and the current boy's struggle against new guy   underground council wins <br> wet T-shirt still canceled <br> boys will want a revenge and become the ruling body of the school </br></br>  <br>And they try to frame each other so one group gets all the girls to themselves while the other gets stuck in prison.</br>  <br>That would require a time skip.</br>  Why does this manga get special treatment compared to other popular shounen manga? I see people shit all over One Piece, etc. yet FMA is always held up on some kind of pedestal. What does it do differently?  <br> planned from the beginning and worked back <br> as should be <br>No. Fucking kill yourself and go home.</br></br></br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br>But he's right. The author knew where she was going with the story, and it shows. It clearly works in its favour, as oposed to a long-time running shounen with no real story to tell (read: Bleach).</br>  <br>He's saying that working back from a predetermined ending is bad practice and he's wrong.</br>   Precure Thread <br> Muh Twilight-sama </br>  <br>Livewatch a season you've already seen and pretend to be someone new to the franchise.
