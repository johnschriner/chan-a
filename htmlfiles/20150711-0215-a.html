[ Evafags drool over Asuka, Rei, Misato and Kaworu.<br>Why don't we give some love to Ricchan?</br>    She's just awful.  <br>Wow. This might be good. Depending on how good this does, i might do a Misato thread (She gets no love)</br>  <br>You have good taste</br>    heres some appreciation for you.  <br>Thanks anon, you too.</br>  A high school girl will never pursue, like, four doctorates to get close to you.  <br>Poor Ritsuko. <br>She's as broken as the rest of the cast, but probably also the only one that can't possibly save herself.</br></br>  I'd give her a go.  <br>Easily the most sylish of the bunch</br>  <br>The worst of it might be that she really didn't know. That felt like love to her.</br>  OLD AND BUSTED. OLD. AND BUSTED.<br><br>THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE HER.</br></br>  <br>To me it seems like her conscious self didn't know, but her subconscious definetly knew, but she tried to reject it until the very end</br>  <br> OLD <br>She's only 40.</br></br>    <br>Absolutely. <br>Misato, which people drool over, is younger by just one year, which is nothing, really.</br></br>  How the fuck did Gendo manage to tap that?  <br>Evangelion is just a harem anime for Gendo.</br>  anno is the master of making attractive anime girls, every single girl in EVA is top tier    <br><br><br>I want to understand this as well, what the fuck was so attractive about Gendo? Didn't Shinji's mom barely tolerate him?</br></br></br>  <br>In at least one continuity it looks like pity, but somehow she was just always attracted to him for some reason.</br>  <br>gendo has (or more likely had) a different side to him that yui saw<br><br>gendo is basically shinji that made all the wrong choices so he ended up the douchebag he is</br></br></br>  <br>There was no reason. Evangelion is secretly a deconstruction of the harem anime genre.</br>  <br>Seems like a pretty spot on explanation.<br>Also, if we think about it Gendo x Yui/Naoko (later Ristuko) vaguely resambles Shinji x Rei/Asuka.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qWd<wbr>60cQPoRw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Who here thinks Ritsuko would be crazier in bed than Misato?  <br>Unquestionably. Misato would demand an apology if you peed on her.</br>  <br>Without a doubt</br>  <br>I abhor fake blondes</br>  <br>Since she has greenish eyes, blonde hair suits her way better than a darker color</br>  <br>Her hair in general sucks</br>  <br>Best woman. <br>Nobody really got a good end but somehow I've always felt that what happened to her was undeserved and out of nowhere.</br></br>  <br>To each their own I guess.<br>I think her short hair works well with her scientist nature. Also, if she had long hair it wouldn't contrast as much with Misato.<br>If you are talking about style however, those were the 90s. <br>Nadia (secret of Blue Water) has a similiar hairstyle</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad for everyone's spines.</br>  <br>It's kinda cute on her if naive and tragic is a kind of cute. She very specifically made herself over after visiting her mom and mom's boyfriend at Gehirn.</br>  <br>I may have done structural damage to my dick because of Denkichi.<br>He has a very bad case of sameface/body but goddamn!</br></br>  <br>When she puts the effort, she can easily compete with Misato (imho)</br>    <br>That landing gear looks like a man with an afro and moustache.</br>  <br>What the hell, you are right, never noticed that</br>  Evangelion is the fucking reason why every silver haired anime character is gay as fuck  <br>She is always putting in the work, mouth pussy like that doesn't just happen. She had that game locked down so hard they had to engineer Kitakami to defeat her.</br>  <br>Yui was all over that Gendo dick<br> I've been dating Gendo Rokubungi. A lot! <br>Even Fuyutsuki questions her shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Maya and her non reciprocated love.</br>    <br>Well, that's fanmande. <br>Altough knowing Anno, he may have tought of some even crazier relationship.</br></br>  Absolutely the hottest Eva girl, and one of my favourite characters. Not enough fanart, but I'm eternally thankful for the Lilium doujin existing.  <br>Such as?</br>  I've got Rule 34, but not sure if this is THAT kind of thread.  <br>Anon, please refrain. <br>This is more of a comfy thread. Very mildly nsfw is ok, hentai should be avoided.<br>Thanks for asking :3<br><br>Image search gives no result. I hate to ask, but what is this from? The manga or one of the spin-offs? It has been a while since I read them</br></br></br></br></br>  So does she have Electra complex? Or is that Misato I'm confusing about?  Misato and Ritsuko were both beautiful honestly. Misato was not only sexy, but she was energetic and wild, but also had a sensitive side. Risato is a two sided coin with both intelligence and beauty and most notably I didn't recall her showing any emotional weakness. Wow, let me end this love letter here.  <br>Thank you for clearing that up for me. Just thought it'd be better to ask than haphazardly post.</br>  <br>It looks like the Shinji Ikari Raising Project. Ritsuko is an old pervert</br>  <br>To go with you "love letter"</br>  <br>Ritsuko is for sexual</br>  I could have sworn seeing some official looking pictures of Ritsuko with short hair? What's that all about?  <br>I wouldn't be so sure about that</br>  <br>That's the design for Evangelion 3.0, anon</br>  <br>3.0. Pretty much all of the adults' looks got updated.</br>  She would be best girl if her shit taste didn't ruin her.  <br>Was it this?</br>  <br> sleeping with the same men as your mother <br>Disgusting!</br></br>  <br>Boom. Yeah, that's it. I wonder why they had a mind to change her...</br>  <br>She probably smells like an ashtray and cat piss</br>  <br><br>Just (Not) Fuck My Shit Up</br></br>  <br>That's mean!</br>  <br>To represent that time had passed without aging her at all. That's her at 44 years old.</br>  <br>Probably to signify the "break-up" with NERV and a fresh start. I do like that she wasn't banging Gendo this time around, I just wish there was a better sense of when Wille split off on its own</br>  <br>She looks great for 44.</br>  <br>I really hate how she looks in the third movie.</br>  <br>It takes place in the future, even Misato's hair was changed. It's most likely to show that they're leaving the past behind.</br>  <br>Misato looks like she straightened her hair or something. It was wavier before</br>  <br>I think I get it. I'm still on the original series and haven't watched the Rebuild(s) yet so it caught me off guard initially.</br>  Best Eva girl? Best Eva girl.  <br>Wow, Misato! She looks much more professional now.</br>  <br>I think it's fitting because it looks more modern, with the side swept bangs and all.</br>  <br><br>You've made a world where cake never goes stale, Shinji. Omedetou.</br></br>  <br>She passed 14 without being recruited as an Eva pilot. That's amazing</br>  <br>Older Misato looks so much better with that "mom haircut".</br>  <br>because she's a loser who was mad Gendo didn't fuck her enough</br>  <br>I thought she looked a lot better with a ponytail</br>  These two decide to tag together. Is there any pair that can beat them?  <br>Yami/Kaiba or Yusei/Jack if they get access to the new summoning methods and appropriate support</br>  <br>Make them fight Ruri and Leo, then sit back and enjoy the tears.</br>  <br>Yusei&amp;Jack<br>Leo&amp;Yusho<br>Yuya&amp;Yuzu</br></br></br>  <br>Neo Sawatari &amp; Neo New Sawatari</br>  <br>Yusei/Jack would probably already have enough stuff in their decks to beat them, if everything (including Quasar) is allowed.</br>  YUGIOH SUCKS DICK<br><br>CARDFIGHT VANGUARD FOREVER</br></br>  <br>Somebody get this hothead outta here!</br>  <br>I dont even know what that is lmao</br>  <br>is that a new meme?</br>     tfw can't shout summons together with the characters because flatmates     <br>Of course he will use scar-right, how else will he entertain his audience without WAGA TAMASHII and ABSOLUTE POWER FORCE</br>  <br>If you guys wants to do some fun with friends you should try duels with these rules:<br><br> Use a Random number generator between 1 and 107 and roll 6 random numbers. <br><br> search for Yugioh number cars having these numbers and add 3 of each to your extra deck. (reroll the numbers that don't exist) <br><br> make a deck based on these. <br><br> You have to summon one of each through the duel before winning or else you can't reduce your opponent's life point to 0. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and I forgot:<br> numbers can only be destroyed by other numbers. </br></br>  SUDDENLY  Isn't this cute she finally sees her tomato again. Too bad isn't gonna get short lived.  <br>Are those tears in her eyes? Also Yugo looks unimpressed</br>  <br>Dude's thinking in his mind terms of: "Yep, he doesn't stand a chance better not tell her that."</br>  <br>Yeah she's shedding tears that Yuya okay and Yugo's impression's likely: "So I guy that looks just like me facing my all time hero, let's see how this plays out."</br>  <br>I want to lick Yuzu's tears.</br>  Is Yugo's Clear Wing the only one who can stand up to Jacks Scar-right?    <br>Haha Yugo is mad because Yuya fights Jack and he's been waiting 14 years to do it himself</br>  <br>Nah it will probably be a new Pendulum Synchro Yuya will develop after his duel with Yugo</br>  <br> Opp is not bennis <br><br><br>Those guys</br></br></br></br>  Literally JoJo Pt.3 Stardust Crusaders reference.  <br>Or the DRAGONS are at it again.</br>  <br>If Yugo can be in the stands without being ported away it a Yuya/Yugo duel seems possible in the Friendship Cup.</br>  <br>Yuzu won't be around to teleport them to begin with.</br>  <br>What? You're gonna have to spell this one out for me.</br>  <br>HOLY SWEET JESUS! Why would you do that?</br>  <br>So it took 22 episodes for them to see each other again, by far they beat the yugioh record</br>  <br>Why is Marik so fucking hot? <br>Shit's no fair.</br></br>  <br>What monster is in the chrome blue?</br>  <br> Security takes Yuzu away for absolutely no reason, making Bracelet-kun useless <br><br>The writers are gettiing smarter by the day</br></br></br>  <br>The Psychic or Ohajikid?</br>  <br>Probably a new Warrior monster</br>  <br>Are the rest of the bracelets useless? They must have different functions, since Rin's bracelet didn't do anything when Yuri and Yugo were in the same place.</br>  <br>There was a time I tried by pure autism to name each part of YGO series like "JJBA" parts.<br><br>DM - Phantom Blood/Pharaoh Blood<br>GX - Battle Tendency/Duel Tendency<br>5D's - Stardust Crusaders/Stardust Riders<br><br>but High-Speed Riders sounds better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a Psychic-type monster</br>  <br> Cover card  <br>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Belial <br>Hi-Speedroid Chanbarider <br>Speedroid Ohajikid <br>Unknown Monster</br></br></br></br></br>   DOCS coming to the TCG in November <br><br>Damn the dub hasn't even started yet and Clash of Rebellion is out next month</br></br>  <br>I will eat my hat if Security actually arrests Yuzu. That's kind of silly after going to the trouble of giving her a riding suit and everything.</br>  <br>It's so she'll look good in chains.</br>  <br>This is probably the only way that I can see Yuya and Yugo going DRAGON on each other</br>  <br>If they can be in the stands watching Yuya vs Jack, it's apparently far enough away that Yuya vs Yugo will work too.</br>  <br>Their release schedule is so fucked up with Arc-V.</br>  <br>Let's be honest, since Arc-V's first episode and the threads in 4chan, Yu-Gi-Oh! got fucked up... in a very good way.</br>  <br> Rin's bracelet didn't do anything when Yuri and Yugo were in the same place. <br>I forgot that this confirmed that the bracelets don't have the same function. I'm looking forward to the MISUNDERSTANDINGS that Serena's bracelet will cause.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>  <br>He does look pretty jealous. Like he's eyeing Yuya as a rival.<br><br>Come to think of it, Yugo doesn't seem to have a Kaiba to be his rival. Yuri doesn't either, and he was also pretty touchy about other versions of him existing.</br></br></br>  <br>Did Yuto have a rival??</br>    <br>Damn you</br>  <br><br>Oh shit I'm sorry, wrong pic. No wonder you two replied like that.</br></br>  <br>Delete this</br>  <br>I'm triggered</br>  <br>Why is her belly button showing through her shirt?</br>  Why is this series so much more sexual than past series?  <br>It's pretty thin material. I even had to shopped the tits since it's too lewd.</br>  Which is the best?<br><br> This is a shit taste detector, so you better watch yourself. </br></br>  <br>47 or 50<br> YUZU ;_; </br></br>  <br>You are a complete faggot if you don't pick 38 or 50</br>  <br>29</br>  Oh, man, how slow am I to not notice til now that Scarred Right Red Dragon Archefiend's arm is the same arm it used to try and fend off Junk Warriors final Scrap Fist attack at the end of 5D's ? I remember the arm being obliterated but I don't remember the horn snapping off.  <br>Welcome to the 7th threads ago.</br>  <br>It's kinda amazing to look at,anon. I mean, it's a dragon that's obviously past it's prime yet it seems to of gotten stronger.</br>  Remember everyone, XYZ monsters do not have levels, they have ranks.<br><br>Know the difference, it could save your life points!</br></br>  <br> Yuzu/Yuuya romance reminds me of what could have been <br> Yuugo/Yuzu fan art reminds me of what probably happened </br></br>  <br>More than that, His right chest plate is also broken, he also seems to have new markings</br>  <br><br>I forgot the horns also seem longer as well</br></br>  <br>It's from all those fierce battles Jack went through to become King again Post-5D's</br>  <br>BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE LEVELS, ISN'T THEIR LEVEL 0?!</br>  <br>Yet, he will never defeat Yusei.Yusei cameo to remind Yuuya of kizunas and nakamas when</br>  What are the chances that the guy who shows the card to Yuuya is Yusei?  <br><br><br><br>Red Demons's now has 8 or 9 forms to combat Stardust's 10.

They've been apart for like, years now.</br>  <br>There is a very high chance Ruri is going to be brainwashed</br>  <br>A hug from her precious onii-chan should break any brainwashing done to her.</br>  <br>Yes, she thinks her name is Selena now.</br>  <br> I'm going to fap to it when Yuya inevitably BTFOs Yuri. </br>    <br>When exactly did Ruri got kidnapped?<br>and When did Reiji meet Serena?</br></br>   /a/rc-v threads are always Shun and Sawatari posting about who has the rights to Serena <br> meanwhile Yugo trolls Yuya about Yuzu <br> Yuya is constantly screaming <br> The Kingu is just busy chilling the fuck out <br><br>I can never tell if /a/rc-v is an rp thread or I've crossed dimensions and this is just /lancer/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Reiji met Serena before the Xyz attack took place, it can't be here and we clearly know that Reiji has studied her movements very carefully.</br>  <br>And then it turns out Ruri is the evil Yuzu and sold out her dimension.</br>  <br>And Yuto helped her and that's why he doesn't want to hurt people anymore, he had a change of heart and couldn't go with her to Fusion, so he lied and said she was kidnapped.</br>  <br>Duel disks have wifi dude. All the characters post here on their free time because they heard this is where the cool kids hang.</br>  Sorry if this has already been asked, but, is there any chance Ruri is, either the ninja, or Sora?  <br> Ruri is actually Ninjabro </br>  <br>How did you ever know?</br>  <br>Ruri is actually Dennis, it's why Shun was confused and asked if Dennis was really from Standard.</br>  <br>But anon, the original YGO is more like Part 4 up to Duelist Kingdom, Part 3 after Duelist Kingdom.</br>  <br>Reiji told me.</br>  <br>That can't be right, When a female character plays a male one, you can tell. See: Blair. Some traits can be seen. I dont see any of these of Dennis, and I can seriously see him as a Fusion-Born.</br>  How hard will Reiji orgasm when he sees Pendulum Synchro  <br>That's what you think. Remember all those Ruri is actually just a flat chested girl? Dennis. Remember all those Ruri is braindwashed? Fusion. Remember all that Heartland is to make people smile and for entertainment? Dennis. <br><br>Dennis is Ruri.</br></br></br>  Raidraptor – Skull Eagle<br>Dark Winged-Beast / Effect<br>LV3 1000/500<br>You can only use the (1) effect of Raidraptor – Sky Eagle once per turn.<br>(1) If you activate the effect of an Xyz monster by detatching this card as an Xyz material: Banish this card from your Graveyard, then target 1 “Raidraptor” card in your Graveyard; Add that target to your hand.<br>(2) An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card as Xyz Material gains this effect:<br>● When it is Xyz Summoned: it gains 300 ATK.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Okay, but what is Devil Eagle?</br>  <br>So, this is the one that makes the new RR.<br>It's not good.</br></br>  <br>2 Level 3 "Raidraptor" monsters<br>You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up Special Summoned monster your opponent controls; inflict damage to your opponent equal to its original ATK. You can only use this effect of "Raidraptor - Devil Eagle" once per turn.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty damn strong, considering it lays on 2000 dmg a turn on average. I guess it has to be, since it's an odd R3 in an R4 deck.</br>  Has anybody here ever made up fake cards? Any you wished were real?  <br>It actually is pretty good considering you can constantly recycle Impale and Fuzzy on top of the new Rank 3 RR Xyz.</br>  <br>We need a level 3 RR that can at least special summon itself or another level 3 RR for this to be usable right now.<br><br>Raidraptor - Call getting printed would be nice too.</br></br></br>  Imdb:<br> Yugioh DM: 66% <br> Yugioh GX: 65% <br> Yugioh 5ds: 68% <br> Yugioh ZeXal: 55% <br> Yugioh ZeXal II: 68% <br> Yugioh Arc V: 78% <br>All is as it should be.<br><br> Yugioh   The Abridged Series : 87%<br>The fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so fucking based</br>  <br>It's getting a second Rank 3, and they're mostly used for detaching Xyz material quick to do damage (with Skull Eagle) on top of Rank Ups. <br><br>It might not be the best in an actual situation, but I can assure you it's not entirely useless. Not like Singing Lanius at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Abridged was pretty decent honestly. It at least led to Black Judai, which is the best part about any of it. Only problem with Abridged is it turned into meme city thanks to the fans.</br>  <br>I fucking love you, please have my babies Yuya.</br>  <br>Singing is not that bad at 1. Easily searchable and you can use it if you need that extra material for Ptolemaios.</br>  <br>Eh, I only do pure decks because capital cardgame autism.</br>  This, this, this, is so horrible. This is way too lewd.<br>I don't think I've ever wanted to mount and fuck someone so badly.</br>  <br> DM above GX <br> Zexal II tied with fucking 5ds <br> Arc V reigns supreme <br>Wow, Imdb is actually accurate for once.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Are you turned on by girls tired out from hours of ultra-crude fist fights with each other?</br>  <br> not playing Hope Raptors <br><br>It's like you don't want to stop your opponent from playing the game.</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer decks that only operate under what their own archetype can produce. Forget all those stupid staple cards, I just find it's more fair when two decks go at it with only the support they've been given.<br>But if you have fun by doing un-fun things, then go for it.</br></br>  <br> fun being objective <br>lol no</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah this. If I wanted to be a Hope and Infinity shitter I'd just play Clownblade and not RR</br></br>  <br>Restricting your opponents options to surrender is not what anybody would define as fun.</br>  <br> not playing clownblade raptors </br>  <br><br>I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH YUYA</br></br>  <br>A shame, nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks, as it was intended. A mono-archetype deck option would be interesting.</br>  <br> being competitive is not fun <br>lol</br></br>  <br> nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks <br><br>Are you kidding me? I've seen people bring out 3 Infinity with Cydra decks.</br></br></br>  <br>Competitive and uncompetitive are different things you realise. I bet you were that kid that hid the football up his shirt.</br>  <br>Reason nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks is because nobody uses Cyber decks. At least they would, if Infinity could only be summoned by using Cyber Dragons, and not literally any deck that can produce some Level 4's.</br>  <br>the fuck does that even mean<br>and yes while I will often play shit like the ds game to get away from the current meta, I find it much more fulfilling to actually make a deck that can see local or tourney play. Cause I like tourneys and locals. <br><br>And in the original post this wasn't about competitive vs casual it was about using lockdown and stun vs powerplaying each other with atk and shit. And I find both fun, one is just much more viable and thus fun cause it wins you the game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen people lean more towards a fusion based deck for Cydras</br>  <br>thats cause the new fusion is insane stronk.<br>but I think it would be fun if we got a defusion based cydra card to support both fusions and xyz's by going from one into the other and back.</br></br>  <br> I equally use bullshit and proper tactics because fun <br> I just prefer the bullshit because ensuring I win is more fun </br></br>  <br>look man don't get me wrong.<br>nothing is cooler then winning with my galaxy/blue eyes hybrid deck. but its not as fun as having a well build consistent deck that is viable for me to play irl at locals.</br></br>  <br>This is what I'm running with right now, I need to fix a few things in it, but otherwise it does it's job more than adequately enough. As for Hope, I can't justify actually using it, the card is too broken, and I used to use Spellbooks/Dragon Rules/TeleDAD to fuck around with.</br>  <br>Fair enough, but still, I can't respect a playstyle that no matter how effective, consists of<br> You can't summon any monsters <br> You can't play any spells <br> You can't activate any traps <br> Anything you do manage to do is immediately removed and/or negated <br> "Good game" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody uses Cyber Dragon decks anymore (sad one of my favorites) thanks to Nutellas, which can get Infinity out far more easily and get more shit out and be more consistent.</br>  <br>I'd shout stuff like REMOVE FUSION and REMOVE BLACKWINGS, but so long as you keep Rise Falcon and its subordinates in there you're already far better than anyone on /dng/.</br>  <br>generally, I will never fully lockdown. <br>I don't run vanity, I side it for when some asshole runs Nekroz or BA the worst stunlock I will do is vortex and infinity at the same time.<br><br>hell my magicians passively deny spells and traps in the battle phase so that kinda locks out a bunch of cards in its own way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Girls bare-knuckle punching each other is my best kept secret fetish </br>  <br>I've been meaning to get Blackwing out honestly, I rarely draw it and it barely helps the majority of the time. The fusion I don't even run anymore honestly, I think I switched out out consistently for 106 from the side deck. To be honest, I'm not even sure why that Fusion is still in there.</br>   That's a mighty fine R4 engine you have there <br> It'd be a shame if something... got mischievous with it </br>  <br>Yeah it'd be a real shame if every deck didn't have some way to negate traps, spells, special summons, draws, etc. while still being able to search through half their deck for the perfect hand on turn 0 just to be able to deal with anything afterwards for the rest of the game.</br>  <br>Yes, such a utopic world would be nice.</br>  <br>so is this like xyz encore but worse?</br>  <br>No silly, this is a Trap.</br>  <br>It can fuck with any decks that rely on monsters with specific levels, not just ones that use XYZ/have an XYZ monster on the field.</br>  <br> Singing  <br> Useless <br><br>This is news to me. I really like singing. My first turns are usually something like Vanishing &gt; Tribute &gt; Force Stryx &gt; Fuzzy &gt; Singing &gt; Force Stryx <br><br>It's been treating me well at 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only way Yugi/Kaiba can win is through plot armor</br>  <br>The "warrior" looks a lot like Viser Des. I hope it's related to it.</br>  <br>That's really the only use for it is searching it out with Strix. Mostly the problem is that it doesn't have any outstanding effect when it's summoned compared to the rest of the cards so it's poor support outside of being for Strix and overlaying it into something else, which isn't always going to work unless you have absolutely have a Fuzzy and sometimes it's just better to go ahead and use Fuzzy if you are lacking on Van, Trib, or Imp. It's just extending plays for longer than need be I find. <br><br>It's not entirely useless, just the most useless of the RR cards, except maybe Strix, since it's attack gain for RRs on the field is pathetic I feel, but at least Strix can Rank Up with ease.</br></br></br>  <br>The most useless RR is Readiness. Literally a shitty substitute for Mirror Force.</br>  <br>Take those trips and shove them up your ass /dng/.</br>  <br>Readiness isn't useless it's just bad to run them at 3, 2 at max.</br>  <br>oh yeah, this super fucks synchro decks too. That's pretty good, and it helps monarchs.</br>  <br>Also it can be used twice, and works even if it's MST'd. <br>Might have to try if with a deck that doesn't rely on specific leveled monsters, like Igknights or even... oh shit, Qliphorts.</br></br>  <br>inb4 Qli's rule again</br>  <br> Literally a shitty substitute for Mirror Force. <br><br>In no way are they similar or have the same use.</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't understand the rule of what MST works and doesn't work against honestly.</br>  <br>MST destroys, but doesn't negate.<br>That trap however can be activated from the Graveyard, so it doesn't matter if it's destroyed beforehand.</br></br>  <br>I made a RR deck to embrace the Revolution but I just can't win with it. Any strategies I need to know ?</br>  <br>Have a sister, and have her get kidnapped. <br>You will OTK every motherfucker that gets in your way.</br></br>  <br> can't win with a R4 deck <br><br>Other than getting better at the game in general and looking up plays on youtube, I don't know what to tell you.</br></br></br>  <br>Combos are hard. Back in my day you were winning if you had a strong monster on the field, not five.</br>  the field of study in the place where I am not a problem with this one of my life and I have nobody is the best way for me to be the same time it's a little bit of a shit  <br>So you're an old player getting back into the game? You could try playing a Gadget deck to familiarize yourself with card advantage and using Xyz monsters efficiently, there are builds over at /dng/ that you can copy and playtest.</br>  It's perfect ly shitty   <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Depends on exactly what RR deck you're running. Some rely a lot of Rank 4 Xyzs and stuff like Ptolemy. Others rely on similar to how it works in the show, with Vanishing/Fuzzy-&gt;Stix-&gt;Rank Up-Blaze-Rank Up-etc. <br><br>It just really depends, RR is a swarm heavy deck whether you're doing it to get shit like Castel or Hope out quickly or using it to get your RR Xyzs or whatever out. If anything use it against the AI or have the AI use it on YGOPRO, you'll figure it out if you work with it similar to the anime with added Xyzs, and the AI does know how to use the deck sometimes, so when it does you can figure it out from what it's doing.</br></br></br>    <br>I'd be fine if there was a Ruri who was built like Fumina</br>  <br>The Ygopro AI eats cocks unless it's told how to use a deck. It can't figure out combos for decks it doesn't know.<br><br><br>These are actually pretty good. Much more realistically written than most custom cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad, they're all huge and crude and brutal.</br>  <br>I have the following theory:<br><br> Ruri will turn out to have a personality similar to Sora (pre-reveal). <br><br> Serena will be revealed to be Sora's big sis. <br><br> Then Serena and Shun are paired and so are Sora and Ruri. <br><br> And then Shun and Sora will be brothers-in-law. <br><br> Big happy family accomplished. <br><br>I know it's nonsense but I really love to see a scenario like this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I find it's hit or miss really. I will agree for the most part it's shit for decks it has no idea on. But I've found that sometimes, as rare as it is, it can pull out some decent combos with RRs and to a lesser degree IgKnights.<br><br>Well if the Cool Kids are Try Fighters, then that makes Ruri Sekai's sister, which means Ruri is the exact opposite of what we all believe, not DFC at all.</br></br></br>  <br> Serena and Sora are related <br> Japan loves drawing Serena as a sweet loving spoiled princess <br><br>Oh boy...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun would legitimately and actually rip his throat out before that can happen.</br>   Yuya will tell Yuzu to smile before she has to kill him   <br>More legimate reason for Sora to try to score with Ruri.</br>  <br>One time I had the AI use a Jurrac deck to see if it could make them work, but it just kept setting monsters over and over as usual. Then it suddenly activated Rekindling and suddenly steamrolled me with two copies of the L7 Synchro.</br>  <br> Yu  sho  will tell Yuzu to smile before he kills her</br>  <br>Some people see Yugo as the Kaito to his Shark or whatever.</br>  <br>Speaking of yusho, where the fuck is he? Is he ever gonna appear?</br>  <br> The ponytails <br><br>  The kinda similar colors of Serena's bangs compared to Sora's entire hair <br><br> The Dennis' DEEPEST LORE.dek with the Serena card and the Sora card revealed to be FIRE. <br><br> The sweet tooth <br><br>Seriously, I would be more surprised if they weren't siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll appear to shill Pendulum Magicians, but since they're topping in the OCG meta he doesn't need to appear as soon as Kamishiro thought.</br>  <br>I think Yuya has at least eight people he could consider his rival.</br>  <br>Well Serena was one of the few people Sora didn't seem to show upright complete animosity towards, granted it could be just because she was from Fusion, but it does seem odd for him to have taught Yuzu fusion and even the little Fusion Dimension chuuni hand clap.</br>  <br>I only see Sawatari, Reiji, and Yuri honestly speaking. But I'm open to hearing who else you have in mind.</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br> Sawatari <br> Reiji <br> Yuri <br> Gon <br> Sora <br> Yusho </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot one detail:<br><br> same eye colors <br><br>Though I'm waiting to see if my theory is complete bullshit.<br><br>Fom the show, not from some random fag's comment -not talking about you-.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither of them even recognized each the other.</br>  <br>I couldn't see Gon.<br>I can maybe sort of see Sora, but I still don't really agree.</br></br>  <br>I recall Sora personally requested Yuya be his rival.</br>  <br>I don't remember that. Was it during their second Duel?</br>  <br>Oh god no<br><br>No not tears already<br><br>This isn't going to end well</br></br></br></br></br>  Are you watching the cutest SoL of the season?

It wasn't until Yuki told her they were "in class" that she quieted down and apologized. </br>  <br>Yes.<br>It's also why Miki barges into their classes and yuki has to tell her "MIKI WE'RE IN CLASS WHAT THE FUCK CLOSE THE DOOR"<br><br> mfw I thought they were just autistic <br> mfw I read the entire manga afterwards <br><br>Anime-only friends are in for a trip</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the four of them are the only ones who aren't zombies?  <br>Think of it as Haruhi :  even more  Delusional edition.<br> They need to entertain her so she doesn't realize what's happening and go berserk. </br></br>  <br>You didn't notice her giving 0 shits in the first two classrooms until CatHat told her?<br><br> &gt;teacher had no presence </br></br></br>  We were right<br>These threads went to shit real quick</br>  <br>So fare we've seen 5 other people who are still alive.

So if you need to use a wheelchair your life would be hell. And this explains why the larger monstergirls have problem going to places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a cripple is literally worse than death in Japan, they might as well kill themselves</br>  <br>Japan cannot unto accessibility. <br>Nope, can't have common sense ruin shits and giggles. Large and deep pool is a-ok, but reinforced roofs with proper escalator? Forget about it.</br></br>  Suu?<br>Suu</br>  <br>How fucking cute is she?</br>  <br>It was pretty ok. The animation was distracting because of how static it was. I found that little video game styled bit quiet charming, I'd like to see more of it.</br>  <br>They don't want smelly cripples stinking up their country, so they force them to flee by making everything require stairs.</br>  <br><br>Best girls</br></br>  <br>Rachnee is ultimately responsible for the house collapsing, due to dragging Honey to her rape attic without first disabling everyone else.</br>  <br>This round about deflection of blame from horse pussy</br>  How would Rachnera act during the full moon? She's already the most unambiguous rapist member  Snakes are the cutest.  <br>She'd turn her legs into penises.</br>  <br>Whose fault is it that all the girls in the house went to the attic to protect his virginity?</br>  Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling?<br><br>It's so easy.</br></br>  <br>Because no one will save her from Suu.</br>  <br>not with that pig voice</br>  <br>That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck.</br>  P O L T<br>O<br>L<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>Chuuni ass-fuck doujin when?</br>  <br> Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling? <br>Unlike the other girls, it seems she needs to be in the mood to feel like it. So she doesn't really plan to rape Darling unless the situation presents itself. And in general we know she can't actually fight off ALL the girls in the house.<br><br> Because no one will save her from Suu. <br>Especially Suu, who is essentially her nemesis. Suu is not affected by silk.<br><br><br> That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck. <br>The Lala bio is written by a sceptic who assumes that magic doesn't exist. Note the section that talked about unexplained connections between Dullahan sightings and deaths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Scene cracks me up every time.</br>  <br>Lala already told darling that she'll be there for him once he's dead for good.</br>  Do you think the VAs are thinking about how weird this shit is to them?    <br>She doesn't have to fight them.<br><br>She simply has to tie them up in her web</br></br></br>  <br>Dat body</br>  <br> that Smith <br>unf</br></br>  <br> She simply has to tie them up in her web <br>Tie up Suu? With spider silk? She is good, but she isn't THAT good.</br></br>  <br>This is the result of that.</br>  <br>Slime best girl.<br>Imagine her covering your dick and churning her slime.</br></br>  <br>Waitafuckingsecond. The anime's airing?<br><br>Fuck, where did the time go!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think  means this, but still the same thing in the end. Everyone else are the only things standing between her and Goo victory.</br></br>  <br>That's like saying Bond was responsible for the firing of Goldeneye because he didn't go back to make sure Alec was dead.</br>  <br>That is why she is not in the anime.</br>  <br>He is. He's a government-sponsored assassin. Failure to kill=poor job performance.</br>  <br>This confuses me to no end. Episode one covered the first two chapters of the manga. However, at that pace, the anime would go straight through to Lala's introduction, yet she doesn't appear in the opening theme. Plus, minor characters like Port and Kii don't show up in any of the themes either, so I have no idea what to think.</br>  <br>They'll be there. Lala's not showing up until the second half of the season at any rate.</br>  <br>Because the entire D arc is a huge spoiler if you're anime-only.</br>  Can somebody explain what are the D's all snakes wear on their heads? <br> inb4 hur durr D worship </br>  <br>I think it's just supposed to be cute hairclips, part of their  D sign.</br>  <br>They're hair clips that resemble snake eyes I think</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he can protect it himself, faggot</br>  <br>It makes them look like snake eyes anon.</br>    Okiku-Mushi when  <br> protect it himself <br>You clearly don't love this decent, earnest and long-suffering fellow. He's been constantly abused, yet his head hang high and his spirit undiminished. <br><br>Scums like you just want to see the flame of hope being snuffed out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to have a daughter and bring her to school with Cerea.</br>  Best girl, can't wait to see that long tongue in anime form  <br>OPPAI LOLI<br><br>HESTIA LIVES IN CENTAUR FORM</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the Cerea bath scene and the full moon episode.</br>   ANN actually liked the first ep <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>  <br>Yes he suffers his small dick(fact) is diamonds all the time, Kimihito can walk off those horse kicks to the head</br>  <br>Every time</br>  Why is Rachnee so cute with all her fangs?  <br>The first episode was good, though?</br>    <br>She makes a great wife.</br>  <br>ive just realised that if cereas ''human'' bely carries the child like in the pic it means her womb is in her human half.... meaning her vag goes through aalllllll her horse body.... poor darling has no chance to impregnate her thats a long ass horse pussy</br>  <br>Those ingrates eat his food, all of it (oh wait, you don't understand this as you are a sole anon in a basement)<br>They are children that he babysits at the behest of the government at that.</br></br>  <br>He can because humans can mate with Centaurs.</br>  <br>Imagine Suu putting a small amount of slime inside your dick making you cum with herself.</br>  <br><br>I want to have babies with Rachnee</br></br>    <br>What if Cerea's dad is hung like a horse?</br>  <br>Yeah whatever.</br>  <br>Meanwhile in Australia...</br>  <br>Too bad<br><br>I've already pried her away from Darling and now she'll have 500 beautiful Arachne children with me<br><br>Why even live after I've stolen your waifu?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it still ticks me off the child is carried in the human half. Bieng the uterus in the horse half would be much more reasonable. <br>It would be imposible for a centaur child to go through such a slim waist as Cereas</br></br>  If only everyone didn't have disgusting cow tits in this series.  <br>Miia is acceptable in this regard, making her top pick once again.</br>  <br>That's why we have best girl!</br>  <br>People like this</br>  <br>Cerea's Dominant Dandy Darling is way better than Miia's Puckish Punk.</br>  <br>This manga got me into giant tits. Miia's are my favorite</br>  <br>The only ones with cowiest are Cerea and Rachnera.<br>Lala's and Miia's are big, but realistically big.<br><br>Mero has average sized breasts, and Papi is an a cup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best tits</br>  <br>Implying Master's sperm would give up halfway. They'll pull themselves all the way through sheer willpower.</br>  <br> Mero has average sized breasts <br><br>Nigga where the fuck do you live?</br></br></br>  <br>Leave</br>  <br>United States</br>  <br>That part made me think.<br>How does she have that big pregnant belly if she has that horse body?</br></br>    <br>During ful moons, Rachnera holes up in her attic lair, furiously knitting silken skull-caps and booties for the local hospital's neo-natal intensive care ward.</br>  <br>I'm Russian, why? She has normal breasts, not small but not too large either.</br>  <br> Mero has average sized breasts <br><br>Do you even read this manga</br></br></br>  <br> Why even live after I've stolen your waifu? <br>Videogames</br></br>  <br>Its like the thought that counts or something</br>    <br> it still ticks me off the child is carried in the human half. <br>It is just horse being dumb about her own biology.</br></br>  <br>Its a series about monster girls you people take this stuff way to seriously.</br>  <br> Russians like anime <br>Yeah right, from what I hear is that they're too busy getting shitfaced and freezing to death. <br>Yuri was right.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5gn<wbr>pCqsXE8g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for making me grin like a psycho on the train home from work, guys.</br></br>  <br>Maybe centaurs reproduce by the bellybutton opening and offspring exiting from that hole.</br>  <br>Still!

Unfortunately, you free rum raisin has reportedly been stolen. Witnesses slaim that they saw a "young girl, age 13 or 14, with blond hair and a hair ribbon" fleeing the scene with the ice cream.</br></br>  <br>I'm kinda worried that the production company is changing... Doga is so good. But I have high hopes. The OVA was quality. Different, but quality.</br>  <br><br>Me and my fucking typos. Ugh.</br></br>  <br>But no one would steal rum raisin ice cream except for Kyouko.<br>I'm starting to realize that Kyouko probably acquired a taste for run raisin ice cream just so that no body would want to steal her snacks.

A more accurate TL would've been<br> "Look who's talking" <br> "Oh, that's rich" <br>but it's hard to say taken out of context.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Thank you, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone who says Souma is dumb or asexual or whatever isn't paying attention. He just has a goal and is really focused on it. He acts airheaded but there are always panels  that show that he's thinking about things he doesn't want to discuss out loud.  <br>They do need to advertise their spot if they want to attract people.</br>  <br>How does that prove he isn't asexual though?</br>  <br>So its listed on the map/newspaper/flyers? <br><br>It definitely seemed that with going with a cart his entire thing was moving around.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsukuda is finally putting Erina into more scenes with the main cast than ever before this past month or so.</br>  <br>If he's smart enough to read social cues then he's clearly aware of sexuality. Plus he remembered his dad's quote.</br>  <br>Until he shows some sexual attraction he doesn't have any sexual attraction</br>  <br>Because we're basically moving into E10 territory, Captain Obvious.</br>  <br>Nah. He's like the med student who studies all the time and doesn't go out with his friends.<br><br>Do you expect him to be some drooling doofus like Issei? The other boys could be called asexual too if we're going by that standard.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some retarded logic you got there.</br>  Soma is impressive in the way that he get almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock, but he never shows them anything other than friendship. I believe if he asked any girl in this manga for a date, they would probably accept.<br><br>Except Erina, but she'll come later.</br></br>  <br> almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock <br> almost every single </br></br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>As far as I remember the only one who has feeling for him is Nikumi, Mehgoo is starting to realize and Erina falling for him in the future is just the logical outcome.<br>So you have three girls out of what? 10?</br></br></br>  <br>The only girls interested in souma are nikumi and childhood friend.</br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>Just 2 girls, Erina and Megumi havent fall yet,</br></br>  <br>Megumi, Meat, Childhood friend. Slobbering on his dick might have been a little exaggerated, but I stand by the date comment.</br>  <br>You forget childhood friend.</br>  <br>Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet.<br> Childhood friend <br>Shit I didn't even remember she existed.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO FUCK ALICE  <br>She'll probably end up not being important again.</br>  <br>Seems like he'll use the smell and curiosity as his trump card. After everyone has seen and eaten just about everything, they'll be dying to know what that "mysterious" thing is.</br>  i want to cum in erina  <br> Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet. <br>After her and Soma finished teaching that one loli with Isshiki, I think she might have fallen a little bit. Or maybe I need to reread the manga.</br></br>  <br> Erina unknowingly opening up to Souma <br>I love this. I LOVE THIS.</br></br>  <br>You sure you will get past Mad Dog?</br>  <br>she had a doki moment, then forgot about it. Tsukuda confirmed not yet, so I imagine we'll know it when we see it. Megumi and Erina aren't going to fall the way Meat did, so we have to wait.</br>  <br> Actually happening <br> ACTUALLY HAPPENING <br> ACTUALLY HAPPENING </br></br></br>  <br>There's a difference between simply stating you find a girl hot or showing any interest whatsoever in the opposite sex and tripping over yourself with drool. And Soma has done none of them.</br>  <br> Erina: ...anyway, this is hardly the time to be worried about the other areas. // You have to concentrate on beating Kuga-san in the Central Area– <br>I like how she subtly shifted into wanting him to stay.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it just because she's annoyed Yugi disrespected the first years like the rest of them?</br>  <br>awww she actually wants him to stay. <br><br>I must say that I really like this arc right now because of the Souma and Erina conversations</br></br></br>  <br>Do any of the guys show interest?</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>IIRC she didn't really care, her and Megumi were the only ones that weren't fired up after the tea party</br>  <br>Megumi was a little peeved.</br>  <br>yeah she didn't. Unlike the rest of them, she must be used to him anyway. Although I guess Hisako has had some exposure to him before too, given that flashback we saw recently.<br><br><br>Honestly, this caught me by surprise though. I knew Erina was past wanting him to get kicked out, but I thought at most she'd lecture him to give up on trying to beat Kuga and just focus on getting a profit so he doesn't get expelled. Instead she's basically telling him get his shit together and beat Kuga.</br></br></br></br>   Megumi: W-We're... <br> Megumi: We're so sorry...! <br> Erina: I-I wasn't addressing you, Tadokoro-san... <br><br> Never mind the Soumabowl, these two should just win each other's bowl. </br></br></br></br>  <br> 111 push ups with a single arm <br>What is he, Thor?</br></br>  <br>I want them to become friends already.</br>  <br> Hisako has a soft spot for Souma <br> Erina has a soft spot for Megumi <br><br>This is nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They should eat each other's bowls. <br><br>Fuckin' parallels, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> 111 push-ups with a single arm <br> 15 years old <br><br>is that even possible irl even with injections and shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you fatty.</br>  <br>he probably doesn't even go all the way down</br>  <br>It's because we've finally met the Elite Ten, and Erina is part of the new generation of first years looking to break into the Elite Ten. The idea of taking down Kuga appeals to her.</br>  <br>I really want to see them mix things up again for another arc or two.</br>  <br>She's already inside, you knucklehead.</br>  <br> people actually think Ryou is attractive </br>  <br>They should trade sidekicks, Souma and Erina.</br>  <br>they should</br>  <br>Nobody mentioned he's attractive though.</br>  <br>Ryou is cute.</br>  <br>It was more of a general statement.<br><br>Zombies are not cute.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah he's ugly as hell</br>  <br>I don't remember this page exist.</br>  <br>Alice's introduction chapter.<br><br><br>The Jewels Generation absolutely sucks. Seriously. They have no sense of economics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sep</br>  <br>It's from the Alice vs Souma part of the Election.</br>  <br>But the Aldinis and their fanclub are dominating the Main Street.</br>  <br>Yeah, but the 3 leaders are still in the red.</br>  I want a doujin of Isshiki fucking all the MILFs. Alert Japan.  <br>What do you expect from one richfag and two poorfags?</br>  <br><br>The Jewels can be as carefree as they are because they know very well that they can turn things around with their skill. In short, they're extremely confident with their skills.<br><br>You don't get this confidence without being extremely good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Someone will make really good food.   The girls will be hot. </br>  <br><br>I would train my body to its utmost limit just to get a chance to smell Alice's chef whites.</br></br>  <br><br>Screw you guys.  knows what's good.</br></br>  Will they be able to fit in all the content in the manga in season 1 or will there be a season 2?  <br> Will they be able to fit in all the content in the manga in season 1 <br>obviously not.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Ryou isn't ugly and he looks very attractive especially without his bandanna. He is actually a bishie just like most of the male characters excluding subaru.</br></br></br>  <br>Ryou looks like an emo fag and ugly too, that undereye circle doesnt help much at all, both version of him suck balls.</br>  <br> greasy looking disheveled hair <br> eyebags <br>Bishie my ass.</br></br></br>  <br>Great to see your hate for ryou.</br>  <br>I've always hated this type of character, its so cliche and overplayed, a poor atempt to make a cool character. Plus he is ugly too.<br><br>Subaru might be uglier, but at least he is more intresting and entertaining as a character than Ryou is.</br></br></br>  <br>All characters are cliche and overplayed</br>  Why people like souma?<br>He is generic as fuck</br>  <br>Because "muh self-insertion"</br>  <br><br>There are some character in this manga that i thought would act like its trope at first impression, but after some chapters it turned out to be a whole different character.<br><br>This always surprises me</br></br></br></br>  Reposting this question, but does anyone know why there isn't a color version of the English translations?  <br>Because Casanova doesn't bother.</br>  <br>Name them</br>  <br> Kurokiba bashing out of nowhere <br>First it's about his appearance and now it's his character</br></br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote sorry</br>  Is Tsutaya good? I want to order some bd's from them, but I've never done it before.  <br>So basically if someone were to go through the effort of cleaning and pasting the TL from the B/W versions onto the color ones we could have nice translated color chapters?</br>  <br>This arc is amazing if only for these small scenes.</br>  <br>Well yeah, I don't know why'd you want that though. The colour chapters are nice enough but no superior to the black and white.</br>  <br>No one wants to redraw color pages.</br>  <br><br>COOKING MANGA</br></br>  Chapter in 5 minutes, guys.  <br>There are, fyi.

Can Don-senpai and Isami not handle the booth?   Uptown area 20 stand <br> Central area 40 stand <br> Main entrance area 60 stand <br> Total stand in the academy is 120 stand  <br> Souma-megumi and the famous trio ranked last in their respective area. <br> by the end of second day, souma ranked up to 35th place. Kuga never see him in the front of his store all day.  <br> souma is in sadatsuka area (same area as aldini and ikumi?) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Looks like Souma went up 5 places in the 2nd day.  <br><br>I hope Aldinis doing well in the first day doesn't mean they will job in the following ones. You know how it work in shonens.</br></br>  Looks like Souma added something to the menu and moved up from 40th place to 35th. Looks like some noodle dish? My chinese is pretty poor.  <br> That Alice eating Souma's bun <br>Nice</br></br>  <br>Isami is calling Takumi for tomorrow's plan<br><br>Don-senpai is crying because their tent broke,</br></br></br>  <br>I think the power trio will get to the top eventually, and on the last day will have a massive lead.</br>   Meat is female Takumi.   <br>Sasuga Don-senpai.</br>  <br><br>Wait, where? I don't find the chapter in their website.</br></br>  <br>I ship them.<br> I think it's fun to imagine them fucking while still obsessing over Soma in their minds. </br></br>  <br>In case you're wondering what they said <br><br>Previous page:<br> Hey Kurokiba, what's wrong with your master <br> Up to a day before she was constantly switching menus, that's why we made this huge blunder!! <br> What are you talking about <br>Next Page:<br> Tomorrow will probably be like this too <br> Hayamareaction.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>come on son<br>dont you know how this is done by now</br></br>  <br>I hope so too. Takumi deserves a win after the Election  and maybe people will finally stop calling him a jobber. </br>  She has the best reactions, so cute.  <br>Even if the shop loses its first place in the last couple of days, they should have a good lead over everyone else, so I'm betting on them winning the overall 1st place.<br><br>Kuga is visibly worried though.</br></br></br>  <br>Did people really call him a jobber after one lose?</br>  <br>The Italian Jobber.</br>  <br>Are you new to these threads?</br>  I kinda get what happened.<br><br>That Souma we saw in last page and Nao saw too isn't Souma, but the mysterious person whom Souma gave the key, and is doing the sellings for night while Souma prepares more of that chinese dishes (same way, when Souma was selling and failing in day, that person was cooking more dishes).<br><br>I dunno who that person could be. Wild guess will be Elite Ten #2 slut. But that's a very wild guess of mine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nao is so cute.</br>   Tsukasa 5th <br>So is he spilling his spaghetti all over the place?<br> Momo 1st and beating Erina in the high class area <br>Now I'm really curious about what Momo is doing.</br></br></br>  WHO IS THE HAND?  <br>if it isn't a new character, it will be Subaru, shota reporter or a guy in PSD (Smoke, Glasses, Buttbros).<br><br>All of them are unlikely though, Subaru is too big to dress up like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Houjou?<br>It's a pretty great plan that lets her beat Yugi while bearing no risk because it's not her booth.</br></br>  <br>What if it's one of Kuga's baldies.</br>  <br>It's really a male. Might be the one who is selling at night.</br>  <br>  Subaru, shota reporter <br>My first thoughts, but hand is too small for Giganigga and too big for the shota.</br></br>  <br>Isshiki?</br>  <br>Gonna bet reporter-kun or a new character.</br>  <br>actually Souma doesn't need to meet any guy in PSD in the main door.</br>  After analyzing the pic for second time, yes, it could perfectly be Hojou. Still, she told Megumi she was going to help other booth (never said what booth it was).<br><br>Still, I'm 100% sure last page Souma isn't Souma but a mysterious helper.</br></br>  is nao shippable with anyone?  <br>Hisoko-oneesama</br>    <br>Rindou.<br>Here me out. If Souma wanted someone's help, he'd go to them and not ask them to come to him.<br>Here it seems like someone got out of their way to see Souma and propose some sort of agreement.</br></br></br>  <br>Donguy always wanted to fuck some meat</br>  <br>Wouldn't it sooner be Eizan or Nene then? Since they also seem to hate Yugi it's plausible.</br>  I think is Rindou or Hojou. Still, why to hide that from Megumi?  <br>Makes sense, she'd probably want to sabotage whatever agreement Yugi has with the autist.</br>  We finally gonna get the new ED today, fucking HYPE!   Souma <br> manga, "black" hair and eyes <br> anime, red hair, yellow eyes <br>It's like I kind of have to readjust for each.</br></br></br>  I'm watching the anime and I'm curious, did the girls make any moves on Souma or vice versa?  <br>nope - no moves</br>  <br>Souma and  Tak umi slept together. Truly best girl.</br>  Why does everyone think there's going to be a new character?  <br>Rindou is weird because she's not showing anywhere on the ranks</br>  <br>She (and Eizan) are involved in managing the event (and hence not participating).</br>  <br>How do you know?</br>  <br>Erina says so.</br>  <br>Houjou is basically the only person who has reasons to help Souma that way.<br>Shota journo doesn't really fit the bill.</br></br>  <br>Page/Panel?</br>  <br>It was in the spoilers when the first pages leaked.</br>  <br>fuck you anon. I read it like that,too.</br>  <br>She says so anon, he isn't lying.</br>  <br>Sure, but Nene hasn't shown any curiosity about Souma, while Eizan hates Souma.<br>Rindou however is hinted to be interested in the interaction between Souma and Kuga.<br>It's admittedly flimsy, but I standby the possibility that the other person sought Souma out.<br>That, or Souma talked to someone in the PSD earlier and is now just seeing them off. The only thing wrong with this is his expression when the other person leaves. If it was someone he trusted, wouldn't he be less wary?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just to let you know, nowhere in the chapter did it mention they were part of management.</br>  <br>He's wary because he doesn't want anyone else to notice about it.<br>And the person doesn't look like Rindo anyway.</br></br>  <br>Page/Panel?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Also.<br><br>2nd page, top middle panel, Souma is asking about 2nd seat.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm not gonna care about inaccurate translations.<br><br>I just read the actual chapter, &amp; I want to know where did it mention they were part of management.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you even understand Chink?</br>  <br><br>Well if you just read the actual chapter, then you would know where 2nd seat is actually mentioned.<br>I just pointed to you a panel where 2nd seat is referenced (just compare the character for seat between that page and the ranking). <br>How about you read that page in your actual chapter and find out for yourself whether it says 2nd seat is helping to run the thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that anon was sprouting out of his ass, nowhere in the chapter did they say Eizan was part of the management. Souma asked why aren't they on the list, didn't they participate? And Megumi replied that she saw him preparing something during the tea party.</br>  <br>Ditto.<br><br>These faggots actually fell for the inaccurate translations, &amp; actually had the cheek to verify that fake info when they don't even know a lick of Chink.</br></br></br>  <br> that anon was sprouting out of his ass <br> sprouting <br> out of his ass </br></br></br>  <br>His tail bone became functional and grew</br>  So is the festival on day 3 now?  <br>day 2 anon.</br>  <br>If new tanks are out at the end of the chapter it means a day passed, no?</br>  I really loved it how the top 8 hang out together now. But why the fuck meat has to be there? Goddammit.  <br>She's Souma's friend and one of the top competitors for one of the areas.</br>   Erina's slow defrosting <br><br>So perfect. I hope Tsukuda doesn't fuck this up somewhere along the line, because so far this is the best example of this kind of classic tsundere progression I've ever seen.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with this shit. These threads have been getting unbearable with this pointless Meat hate. Why do you guys insist on keeping this stupid shit up?</br>  <br>Yeah, I really hope he doesn't try to speed up the process unnecessarily. The only factor that should play into this is Soma's talents, not his relationship with his dad.</br>  Tsukuda a shit, this chapter looks boring as hell.  <br><br>Watch it end in this.</br></br>  <br>How is he even fucking this up? He already pointed out Souma's performance in the Elections changed Erina's opinion on him, quite considerably, as we've observed so far. And just to let you know, he'd be visiting Erina's booth, so that will be another thing for the Megumifags to dread about.</br>  <br>Fuck off, summer.<br><br><br>Fuck off with your overused meme.<br><br>Seriously, just fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best thing about this two arcs is that she is finally hanging out with the kids in her year. Guess all those complains about Erina being neglectable in the past arcs came through</br>  <br><br><br><br>Tsukuda said in one of his tweets last year that one of his favorite methods of preparing food is slow cooking it in a slow fire. Slow cooking tends to result to a very tender and flavorable dish that no other method can replicate.<br><br>We're not witnessing Erina's defrosting, anon, we're seeing her simmering for hours on end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like how she lusts over Soma's dick for some reason<br><br>Dunno, she would be a better character if there are some development between her and the don guy</br></br></br>  <br><br> overused meme <br><br>the pic was only made last thread, anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its still 'defrosting', no matter how you look at it.</br>  <br>For some reason?

Are you having a bad day?<br><br>We're all having a good time in this thread, there's no need to be telling everyone to fuck off over such small, insignificant things</br></br></br>  <br>lmao xd</br>  <br>hell during the election it self there were hints of Erina changing her mind about him, always showing up for his matches, also showing interest or at least intrigue in his "loosing is winning" ideals when ishiki pointed out to her that even when he looses he manages to learn and grow and never sees it as just loosing.<br><br>that will probably play a big part for her when she eventually loses to him or to some one else, and its souma who helps her understand that its not the end of the world, etc.<br><br><br>so yeah, slow cooked roasts are the best and we are starting to see the results.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like he doesn't realise it's obvious he's samefagging by saying fuck off in every post and being standoffish<br><br>Probably a mehgoomyfag feeling vulnerable after the chapter</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rindoufags due to their delusion. Erinafags can get annoying bringing up Megumi every damn time but hey, they have a leg to stand on compared to Rindoufags who, since her introduction, are already hyping up to be the winner of the Somabowl because they think she was interested in him in that one panel that doesn't even look like she's looking directly at him. She could be seeing at Kuga for all we know. That and they start cooking up greentext fanfiction of a heartfelt Shokugeki between her and Soma where Soma trades his entire victory for her or some shit. <br><br>It has died down though so thank god for that. Erinafags are now climbing out now that she's getting more screentime so they have to gloat. I ponder what the threads will be like when Rindou comes into play.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish there was an alumna or teacher who focuses on dairy, and of course she would have cowtits.</br>  <br>Yeah but that doesn't necessarily translate to what we're seeing with Erina right now. What we're witnessing now is more of 'defrosting', rather than 'simmering'.<br><br>Who knows? We'd just have to wait &amp; see what happens after this festival, &amp; before the school year comes to a close.</br></br></br>  <br>Where is this smile from?</br>  <br> Rindou never comes into play </br>  <br> people are talking about characters with big involvement in the current arc <br> <br>no shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that was just one guy, most Rindoufags think she's Souma's cousin or something.</br>  <br> that will probably play a big part for her when she eventually loses to him or to some one else, and its souma who helps her understand that its not the end of the world, etc. <br><br>I doubt Soma will be the one who will beat her. It has to be someone despicable that readers can't get behind. Eizan does have that going for him and I can imagine him stomping her so much that it'll break her leading to her losing everything eventually going into a healing/inspirational character arc (maybe her getting involved with the PSD crew.) Then going back to beating him but with a different flair about her.<br><br>I dunno, anything can go really but Soma vs Erina feels like an endgame thing and I feel when we get to that point that's when the two have finally revitalized their craft as cooks when they go in that fateful shokugeki. What they'll throw down in the line, that's up to Tsukuda.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thoughr those people were joking</br>  <br>No idea anon, just got them from another thread.<br>not sure if they are random sketches from the cooking book, or the side novels things.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck do people jump to rindou winning the soumabowl? At best she's going to be a small flirtatious ally that turns out to have more sinister alter motives to help soma based on what her character archetype looks like.</br>  <br>Not one guy, but quite a substantial number of anons. You can't look past the color of her hair &amp; eyes, &amp; the apparent interest she showed in Souma. Tsukuda's definitely cock-teasing the readers with her. <br><br>And voila! She doesn't appear in the rankings. Tsukuda has some big plans for her, the way things are going.</br></br></br>  <br>I want Isshiki to rape her in a shokugeki, then force her to live in the dorm. Hisako follows.<br>Alice, seeing this, decides to follow Erina to the dorm, with Kurokiba.<br>Then Jun, seen all of Akira's friends are in the dorm, forces him to go there.<br>Takumi, feeling left out since all of Souma's rivals are there, decides to move too.<br><br>Perfect domino effect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's pretty <br> They like her <br> They self insert into Souma <br><br>Gee, I don't know why they'd want her to win the soumabowl either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep posting them anon. I need more Erina's smiles.</br>  <br> every garbage harem anime ever </br>  <br>I want to protect that smile</br>  <br>Delusional aren't a reason they're an excuse.</br>  <br>Do people actually think that she's going to win? Has she even ever said anything?</br>  <br>Happy Aldinis are a miracle of the universe.</br>  How would a redemption arc for Takumi go at this point? It seems rather lame that it seems to boil down to a predictable Soma vs Takumi fight that we know Takumi will win in. Then again, I suppose in shounen manga we can always expect something like that. I'm just a little bothered that it would feel like Soma will make Takumi win or some shit for his Mezza-Luna.<br><br>Taking it away from Giganigga would be a more satisfying redemption for Takumi and not let that be the backdrop of his inevitable shokugeki with Soma.</br></br>  Don't forget to praise Aldini bros with their first place.    <br>I expect him to beat a formidable opponent and have Souma give him back his mezzluna and tell him he earned it, and he doesn't want to face him when he doesn't have signature knife or something like that.</br>  <br>I mean there's just one guy I've seen seriously pushing for Soumabowl as a "first love" kind of thing, while the cousin theory is more popular.</br>  <br><br>No, anon, you see, this panel clearly shows she's interested in him. Just look closer. Don't be blind, bro she's totally into him.</br></br>  <br> she's totally into him <br> she can't be looking at him because of the retardations he says </br></br>  So what can we expect out of Zouken Matou clone?<br><br>also Index NT13 thread</br></br>  <br>hes gonna get exploded.<br>still legitimately think the biggest hype of this volume is anti-touma.<br>because god damn touma needs a legitimate nemesis.</br></br></br>  <br>doesn't the new volume come out today?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yep, came out this morning. Just came home and picked it up.<br><br>I assume some other /a/non posted the illustrations?</br></br></br>  <br>2 threads ago some guy spoiled the illustrations early and it seems to fit the spoilers that we know.</br>  Who's the unexpected help?  <br>Do you have a book?</br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>Fiamma.</br>  <br>forgive me for being a lazy faggot for not looking up the thread but i gotta know now,<br>does Misaka get btfo?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Maybe you can take a some photos for translation purposes?</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127807<wbr>352/#q127819153</wbr></br>  <br>Touma teams up with <br/></br>  <br>I can try but I have a shitty camera.</br>  <br>sort of.<br>she flips her shit on realizing exactly how shit it is to be touma at the end of the book.<br>it leaves it ambiguous as to what the actual crap shes gonna do in the future though, she could very well be convinced to go full lv 6.</br></br></br>  <br>You always can try to take one or two photos.</br>  <br>Looks good enough r-right?<br><br>This is the 2 pages after the preview that came out a week ago.</br></br></br>  How the **** could Aleister realize the existence of Kamisato?  <br> next volume <br> touma proceeds to beat the everliving shit out of kamisato for doing shit to his 15 cm waifu <br> aleister proceeds to highjack his arm and ability </br></br></br>  <br>What's good, nigga?</br>  <br>one more for reassurance</br>  <br>Well, looks good.</br>  <br>then post pics</br>  <br>most of the illustrations are leaked here it seems<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127807<wbr>352/#q127821539</wbr></br></br>  <br>Who's that? I stopped reading after the first series ended.</br>  <br>so the giant hand people think is fiamma, because he got his ass kicked so hard in WWIII he ends up bailing toumas dumb ass out once in a while.<br><br>the skelly looking mother fucker is the head of top tier reality bending fucks called the magic gods.<br>current volume is touma GTFOing with mikoto away from the super overpowered fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean he is even stronger than Aiwass?</br>  <br>That hand doesn't look like Fiamma's</br>  <br>So why are the nip misakafags shittng on touma? Did something happenbon this volume that made them buttblasted?</br>  <br>probably because he didn't simply get off his shitty acrobike and proceed to defend misaka from the magic god that scares the shit out of her.<br>basically its another case of lol touma didn't fix every problem, fuck touma.<br><br>nip fans disgust me,</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because Touma called misaka a burden and she gets all sad and shit</br>  Anyway to summon Js06 and get those scans translated?  <br>Easy<br>/summon Js06</br></br>  <br>They are misakafags, they are always buttblasted</br>  <br>Because  we don't read it yet </br>  To the anon who has NT13, Who's the character in the table of contents page?  <br>Touma shitted on misaka for being a burden according to spoilers.</br>  <br><br>Can we get more photos?</br></br>  <br>to be fair, misaka has been completely fucking useless since NT started and the only contribution shes committed since then is seriously trying to kill him in NT10</br>  <br> completely fucking useless <br>Gr8 b8</br></br>  <br>tell me what good things has she done since NT.<br>go on, enlighten me anon.</br></br>  New episode in 3 hours and still no thread yet?  SHAME   I hope we'll get the subs faster this time.  <br>I swear I read this manga like 20 years ago, it is just getting an anime now?</br>  gonna go out on a limb and say this is MAPPAs best work so far, shame about it being a run of the mill shounen  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>There is some old Ushio to Tora anime that no one cares about.</br>  <br>it's a great shounen</br>  <br><br>Why is it so much fun? it's like if Togashi took Inuyasha and instead of making a dreary romance with a girl and a half-demon, it's about a goofy kid who looks like Ippo, meets an asshole lion thing, and can turn into the samurai who killed it.</br></br>  <br>hilariously this actually isn't anywhere near as shitty of an adaptation as i feared.</br>   How fucking cool he looks with long hair <br><br>It looks like kite+gon fused, I love the style. I thought it'd be madhouse for sure but it's not.</br></br>  <br> I thought it'd be madhouse for sure but it's not. <br>It's is actually almost all Madhouse staff.</br></br>   Tora has thunder powers and can fly <br>Ok, pretty good<br> By the middle end of the manga he pulled fire and wind breathing from his ass <br> gets an useless    power-up armor  at the final arc<br><br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beat me to it<br><br>Anyone ready for nude Mayuko and Asako?</br></br></br>  <br>I hope they have the balls to do it correctly.</br>  <br>He's a shapeshifter who could easily take being cut in half.<br><br>Also, the Azfuse did do shit. Unlike Ushio's armor. Shit was useless yo.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind a powerup armor, but it is so ugly.</br>  <br>This as well, but maybe that was the point. Still, it doesn't look cool at all.</br>  <br>Forgot that. And also the long neck attack and hax regenerative powers.</br>  <br><br>Tora's powers are really inconsistent. He had this thing where if you pull his hair he'd come to a person (Tatari Breaker arc)<br><br>Also, this shit looks dope as fuck. It even looks like they'll adapt more than the anime itself.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fgW<wbr>TndASH5Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it great?</br>  <br>Note: I'm not trying to argue, I'm genuinely curious what people's reasons for liking it are.</br>  <br>Great art and story</br>  <br> 2:30 <br> mfw that Underwater HnM <br><br>Some of the improvised costumes (and the spear) look actually pretty good. But that stage looks a bit crowded, they should really use some extra space.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being a run of the mill shounen <br><br>It's actually always been one of the most highly regarded shonen ever. Which doesn't mean the most popular, but that it's one of the shonen with the highest favourable opinions / negative opinions ratio.</br></br></br>  MAZEN NA<br>KIKEN NA</br>  <br>what exactly does it do to set itself apart.<br>what groundbreaking writing device did they introduce to make it something special</br></br>  <br><br>The main character has a sense of justice and self sacrifice for others that makes you really want to cheer for him. The bonds forged in this manga (just like in Karakuri Circus and Zatch Bell) are just too damn strong and well intended.<br><br>It*s not just FUCK YEAH BADASS MANLY HOTBLOOD GAR, but seeing how this pip-squeak cries, fights and cares for each and every soul he meets, no matter how little their problems matter. When he fails to stand for others, he is sorry and really, REALLY means it. And these moments don't feel like written by a generic hollywood script with wooden cliched dialogues, but really human-like.<br><br>Lastly, you got japanese mythological monsters wrecking shit and some nice waifus. What else do you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> groundbreaking writing device <br>I'm the guy who initially asked "why do people particularly like this" and I think you're a fucking retard</br></br>  <br>I'm writing a wall of text about that for new people.<br> I hope that trying to make these people understand what kind of expectations they can have and can't have will limit the amount of shitposting.<br><br>For the time being, let's just saying that searching something groundbreaking from it it's like wanting something groundbreaking from Seinfeld.<br>You are already watching it with a totally wrong mindset.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but seinfeld revolutionized the topical humor over modern comedy.<br>It moved from skits , to everyday occurrences that would be funny no matter who you told it to</br></br>  <br>It gets REALLY crowded at times from what I see but I think that comes from how small the venue is.<br><br>I really do want to see it live if not just to see how they do the story.<br><br>They also seem to do this thing where they specifically have random dance numbers so each viewing is a bit different from the next.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gpm<wbr>Sm9HDdEE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://<span>youtu.be/GlCYcb-Zcj8?t=851  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw JewWario commented on that second video <br>Damn...<br>Also wow this series must be pretty iconic in Japan, considering that stage play was way before the new anime was even announced.</br></br></br>  <br>How about instead of comparing a fighting shonen manga to Seinfeld and opening the most pointless can of worms in the world you simply call him out for thinking that a manga needs to have a "revolutionary writing technique" to be particularly good</br>  I'll just repost this:<br>Episode 2 Ishikui<br><br>Storyboard: Nishimura Satoshi <br>Episode DIrector: Fujise Jun'ichi<br>Animation Director: Abiru Takahiro<br><br>Ep 3 E ni Sumu Oni<br><br>S/EP: Koujina Hiroshi<br>AD: Ishii Mai<br><br>Ep 4 Tora Machi e Yuku<br><br>S: Nishimura Satoshi<br>EP/AD: studio DANGUN<br><br>Ep 5 Fujushi<br><br>S/EP: Yoshida Daisuke<br>AD: DR MOVIE<br><br>Ep 6 Ayakashi no Umi<br><br>S: Yano Hiroyuki<br>ED: Matsumura Masateru<br>AD: Takahashi Mika<br><br>No cuts so far. Also it really is exactly the same staff as HxH, except Koujina and Nishimura switched places and Mori Tomoko is chief AD now so she's probably not going to be on rotation. No sign of MAPPA animating anything themselves. I imagine they're going to step in on the last cour for the Hakumen fight, because if they're going to do it with the regular rotation there's no point to the split cour.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point, they both influenced most series of their own genre, but in 2015 they can't be groundbreaking when their heirs already used and reused everything that these series had.</br>  <br>A lot of series get little criticism on 4chan simply because they're old and not popular enough to get criticism. The only people who discuss them are those who already watched them eons ago or are the kind of people that will particularly like that particular sub-set of anime/manga enough to dig for lesser-known titles (in this case hot-blooded old action shonen)<br><br>Don't get me wrong from what little I skimmed of this it does look good for a variety of reasons; I just find it interesting to see others explain why something is good without vague stock-comments like "it's actually enjoyable" like "the art and story are good". It's like, okay, but WHY are the art and story good? Why did you personally enjoy them?</br></br></br>  <br>How was the HxH remake in terms of production by the way?</br>  <br>Jesus, form your own opinions you clown.</br>  <br> call him out for thinking that a manga needs to have a "revolutionary writing technique" to be particularly good <br><br>Because I don't care about his priorities and taste. If He thinks that it's the most important thing ever, he can suit himself.<br>What I want him to understand is that it's simply wrong searching something like that in U&amp;T.<br>And the Seinfeld thing is a very fitting and easy to get comparison.<br><br> A lot of series get little criticism on 4chan  <br><br>I wasn't talking only about 4chan. Here in Europe is even more highly regarded in basically every place.<br><br><br>Oi Hox, did you like the VAs?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do, anon. Some anime considered "legendarily bad" is 8/10 or 9/10 to me and some that are considered classics I consider garbage. I just find it interesting to read other people's perspectives.</br>  <br> I do, anon. Some anime considered "legendarily bad" is 8/10 or 9/10 to me  <br><br>Now I'm curious. Post some  mine is Apocalypse Zero. God bless those OVA </br></br></br>  <br>Not quite, to be perfectly honest. I think the girls are fine, but Ushio and Tora both sound a bit too deep and Ushio's dad doesn't sound very old. Might need more time for me to get used to it.</br>  <br>I dunno, you tell me.</br>  <br>Why does Hisoka have claws in the anime?</br>  <br>Apocalypse Zero (manga is arguably better but I honestly think the anime is a good adaptation given that the manga style would be impossible to get right in motion without an Akira-level animation budget), Birth, Monkey Punch no Sekai: Alice<br><br>Manga-wise Violence Jack is an unironically good manga even if the OVAs are pretty bland.<br><br>Black Lion is a 7 but that's still "good" in my mind, the manga seems better for that one too though.<br><br>I haven't seen Baoh yet but the anime looks fun and the manga seems even better and has some great Go Nagai-inspired early Araki art.<br><br>"Legendarily bad" old anime is literally just an arbitrary, small list that that a cliquey minority of "old school anime fans" chose to show that they're against "silly, mindless fun" series and that anime is high art. Sadly most of the normal viewers without their heads stuck up their asses about "mainstream approval" don't hang out in anime communities anymore so you're stuck with 30something ANN types.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't have really a lot of standout sequences but it was well above the average quality of late night anime.... for 30 or so episodes. I remember the Ponzu episode looking really good (18 I think, AD was the character designer of UtT)<br>Then it dropped, and by the time it reached Greed Island only Mori Tomoko and Ishii Mai episodes looked pretty good (so like 2 out 8).</br></br>  <br>I dunno, you tell me.</br>  <br>ps. I don't use Mangareader, that page was linked by a friend and I literally copypasted it from a Skype conversation.<br><br>HxH 2011 has some great action animation (more great action animation than the 90s anime from what I gather) but the modern digital anime colors and art direction are a total downgrade.<br><br>To be fair though, the old show also had ugly blurry after-effects.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> more great action animation than the 90s anime from what I gather </br></br>  <br>Jesus.</br>  <br>The exception that proves the rule.</br>  <br><br>Anyone have a webm of Hisoka vs Togari? That was the highest point of animation in terms of action animation.</br></br>  <br>Haha that "QUALITTEY XD" gif  was so fucking disingenuous. More people should do this in response to these posts.<br><br>I want to get into HxH and see at least some of it animated, but I'm not sure how because both adaptations AND the manga seem to have their bad parts and good parts.<br><br>2011 anime seems to have more proper action animation but has worse art direction<br><br>1999 one if unfinished and seems to have less stand-out moments but it has better adt direction<br><br>Completely ignoring the issue of scribbly weekly releases because I'll be reading it from the volumes, the manga has simple-but-solid, stylish art when Togashi tries, but sometimes it looks like he uses "simple style" as an excuse to not try. For example, sometimes you have appealingly drawn and lively stuff like this...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I"ll give you my opinion on it.First time I read it, I wasn't too hot on it but further rereadings and dumping all of it made me appreciate it more for what it does well which is tell the trials of a hero. <br><br>Ushio's adventures feel like the sort of bedtime stories you could tell your kid, of a knight and his quests. Very self-contained, each with their own lesson, but still all wonderfully heroic.<br><br>That's not to say it's perfect though. I dislike how, while the world is explored to the utmost, the characters aren't'. They give us just enough depth to be invested in the characters but not really enough to make me call them my favorites. For example Tora's backstory, while great, didn't really do anything for Tora.<br><br><br>I hafta agree with this. Took me a while to get a feel for Tora's voice HnM's voice is never going to be perfect for me though I hope they don't make it too high.<br><br>This coming from a guy who never watched the OVAs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all dat animation </br>  <br>First half is generally bad looking i.e. your atypical shounen anime once it moves along and stops relying on Korea it gets much better since by then they've hired better animators and learned to properly spread a budget. It's "above average" in that regard since Madhouse learned how to hid low quality shots or keep them to a minimum and didn't try to save their best animators to special episodes but they were scattered about.</br>  <br>...or this...<br><br>I said "more". I've even talked to a "2011 sucks, 90s for life" guy who admitted the 90s one has LESS good animation.<br><br>There's a difference between quality and amount. The "epic money shot animation" clips I've seen from the 90s one seem better than anything in the 2011 show but there seem to be significantly fewer of them.<br><br>Of course, the people who told me this might be wrong? Feel free to correct me if I've been misinformed and the 90s one is full of stuff like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> those stills everywhere </br>  <br>...but then you have other chapters with art like this, which just feels lazy as opposed to appealingly simple.<br><br>I'm staring to think my best bet is to read the manga but also watch stand-out episodes of both anime shows. It shouldn't be hard since simply screwing around with the seek bar lets you quickly realize if it's a cheap episode or a good one most of the time.</br></br></br>  Someone could share the link for the livestream plx?  <br>I've never seen someone so conflicted over something as shitty as HxH</br>  <br>ebin</br>  <br>It's really easy for people trying to look like 'cynical critics' to complain about *lack* of animation. That scene looks like perfectly good use of a low budget, it's well-storyboarded and the bits that are animated look good. The suited guy blocking the gunshots is quite appealingly animated.<br><br>The after-effects and colors suck, but the use of visuals is good.</br></br></br>  <br>Every fucking day. Every single fucking day this big Youkai faggot just sits there haunting me and gives me this stupid look on his face</br>  <br>So moe.</br>  <br>It's the good Madhouse staff.</br>  <br> the characters aren't'. <br><br>I totally agree about the flashback (as good as it was, Tora's background, backstory, and circumstances really seem meant for a totally different charcter), but this is just nonsense.<br><br>In the last arcs we have even got the most great and natural friendship scenes of every shonen ever, and their relationship was developed during the whole series. As for the minor characters, Togashi is a genius at characterizing them with simple little gestures and acts. In the extra volume Shigeru and Satsuki even got a fantastic chapter about them. And so on.<br><br>What more could you want?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>From last live watch thread. Dunnow if they work<br>http://www.douyutv.com/5275<br>http://www.douyutv.com/meizhi</br></br></br>  <br>You like krabby patties, don't you squidward?</br>  <br>And there is also motherfucking Nagare, and even Hakumen got an interesting characterization with a single great page.</br>  <br>when the episode will be aired? 40 minutes?</br>  <br> haunting <br><br>That's one of the details that I would have liked Fujita to explain or use further. It would have been nice to see more "haunted" people, like humans who interact with Yokai un/willingly.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunnow. Maybe it's just that I wanted more that I feel that it feels lacking. They don't really change as characters nor really develop that drastically enough that they are different from beginning to end. although the friendship does.<br><br>They have character but I wanted somewhat of a change.<br><br>Interestingly, I recently had a lesson on how the characters in Indian epics don't actually change over the course of the story as compared to Western epics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God dammit I normally hate "internet culture references" but I laughed really hard at this post.<br><br>HxH seems to have some pretentious fans who overhype how "mature and deep" it is "for a shonen" (as if that should matter) but based purely on my own research of it, it seems like a fun series.</br></br></br>  Best girl when?  <br>More or less<br><br><br>But I really wish it was explored more instead of just being brought up.<br><br>However, it at least makes for pretty interesting rereads which I believe helps.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yorkshin deserved better than this.</br>  <br> best girl <br> not mayuko <br><br>pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, do I ever love girls that wear long skirts.</br>  <br> best girl <br> being a furry <br>Yeah no.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorta speaking of that, but anyone else found it off how they made it sort of a deal with of Tora not being seen by normal people but in the end suddenly yokai can be seen even on camera, the military, and everyone else?<br><br><br>This cour at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon that picture is disgusting</br>  <br>I like how they used to cut open their long skirts when they had to fight. <br><br>You don't see that any more with short skirts which is a shame.</br></br></br>  <br>You're probably referring to "EEEW GROSS MONSTER" but it would actually be great if it was drawn better.</br>  <br> how they made it sort of a deal with of Tora not being seen by normal people <br>I hope they keep the [Tora cannot be seen by normal people] running joke in the anime.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty much what happened though</br>  <br> gore in my fanservice <br>No, nothing would make that better. Not even improving the art.</br></br>  <br>He's the hero who tolerates the little diarrhea shrimp's whims.</br>  <br>the stream dont work i got a fes seconds of images and then a black screen</br>   IT LOOKS SO 90S!!!!!!!!!! <br>Why do people say this about something that looks and moves unmistakably like a 2010s anime?</br>  <br>The first one isn't working for me but the second one is...well it's playing Psychopass<br><br>Try connectcast playstation2<br>Although it never worked for me it may work for others.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ushio has the runs: 3-part filler by MAPPA with 40% of the budget spent </br>  Is it okay to sexualize Ushio?  <br>totally</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Both working for me, it's playing a lot of OP one after another</br>  <br>Stop</br>  <br><br>Gross</br></br>  <br>If you think that's bad, you haven't seen Tora with muscles yet. Looks so Bara it makes me sick.</br>  IT BEGINS!  oh tora, you silly  wow neet is a faggot<br>he started streaming it and then switched to Miss Monochrome</br>  Well that was great.  That was the epitome of meh.<br>An extreme step down from last week's episode in quality. <br>Guess I expected more from Mappa.</br></br>  Fuck, they screwed up the most important scene!  <br>Here's your reply</br>  Subs when.  <br>To be fair, Ushio to Tora has only very few true action arcs if you were expecting it.<br><br>It was alright for me.<br><br>Although I'm thankful for that french anon, i hope we don't have to go through that kind of situation again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't super impressed but it wasn't terrible. We'll probably settle into a pattern of these kinds of episodes with occasional higher quality for important scenes.</br>  It doesn't seem to be doing much interesting with the direction. At this level it's still gonna be good enough when the content itself is more interesting.  <br>Comparison.<br><br>I guess it's sort of nice that they just handwave over it instead of give it a long lengthy zoomed in super interesting shot ala TLR<br> <br>Hopefully they won't downplay Hinowa's stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was afraid of that. So it's like HxH's new adaptation?</br>  <br>Wasn't meh at all, you're delusional.<br>It was above average for a 2nd episode.</br></br>  <br><br>Interesting things with the direction? What?<br>Are we still talking about a 90's shonen adaptation? Not some Nisio adaptation by Shaft where you have to fill the empty space behind the mountain of pointless dialogue.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How is it screwed up? I don't see it.</br></br>  <br>Probably. When I think of UtT, it's not really how they beat the enemies but the arc itself and the characters is what I remember and the Stone Eater isn't really that intersting.<br><br> I also get PTSD just remembering it's boss battle in the game. </br></br></br>  <br>Why are Ushio's reactions so cute?</br>  <br>QT on the right with the fluffy hair was replaced.</br>  Useless females, hotblooded shonen protag with bushy eyebrows, youkai...<br>Man this really is a 90s shonen manga daptation</br>  Tomorrow's the episode that may make or break it for me.<br><br>They're definitely cutting stuff from the Oni in the Painting to make it fit so I'm a bit cautious on how they'll be doing it.<br><br>Also<br> No Bloomers </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Asako and Mayuko little pinky nipples, this series is ruined.</br>  <br>Nobody cares</br>  <br><br>Go away.</br></br>  Perfection  <br>Kagas</br>    <br>Kagass</br>  <br>I would be the first to rough her up.</br>  <br> top right panel <br>Is the M in Murasame capitalized? It's a bit hard to tell.</br></br>  So will the suffering finally end?  The suffering is only just beginning.  <br>For Sacchin yes, Sion will need to wait longer though.  Roast beef route never </br>  Why do so many people on /a/ dislike Heaven's Feel? <br><br>I personally think that while Heaven's Feel is my personal favorite route, that each route is great in their own way. Just because I prefer one route doesn't stop me from enjoying Fate and UBW.<br><br>What is it that you guys don't like about Heaven's Feel? And be real with me. No "LOL COOKING LOL WORMSLUT" shitposting. But more importantly, why must we all be so tsundere for each other?</br></br></br></br>  <br> being this blind and retarded <br>ok anon.<br>enjoy your batshit victim complex of a waifu anon, go white knight the shit out of her, see how it did for shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>She's only a damsel in distress in the scenes with Shinji, of which there's only a grand total of 3 scenes.<br><br>Oh Jesus Christ... are all Anti-Sakurafags THIS fucking stupid?<br><br>DING DING DING!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> legitimate argument was made <br> hurf durf anti-sakurafags are fucking retarded, fuck off from my waifu <br>enjoy tipping your fedora.</br></br></br>  <br> She's only a damsel in distress in the scenes with Shinji <br><br>Dude, the entire story focuses around trying to save her from like, everything. Shinji, Zouken, the worms, the war, herself. She is pretty fucking helpless in the story until the end where suddenly she's a bad guy now.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a damsel in distress for 3 specific scenes, rest of the time she's either cooking or going around killing people while pretending it's not her own will and gets outraged when confronted with the truth. She doesn't fucking deserve to be saved because she's literally the most detestable being in the entirety of Fate/stay night. Not to mention that in HA we got to see her being constantly jealous at Rin and smug whenever she could somehow make her feel bad.</br>  So what do you guys think of it? It's not bad.  <br> senketsu is doing softsubs for this, so we don't have to resign ourselves to the faggotry of Funi hardsubs <br>Thank god</br></br>  <br> Two different shows with two different characters with red hair.  <br><br>Yeah, let's compare them. Throw Magic Knight Rayearth in there too because MC has red hair.</br></br></br>    <br>Not bad but I prefer watching my Shoujo in a batch rather than weekly.<br><br>Can't wait though.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Well it's Bones... <br>Apart from this I haven't seen any other issues.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
