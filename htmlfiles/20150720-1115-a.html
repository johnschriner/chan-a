[ What do you guys think of DBS so far? Three episodes thus far and it has a slice-of-life feel, episode two with Vegeta's family vacation was enjoyable to me. I know this is just setup but I almost wish we could get past the BoG stuff and start progressing with new material. So far episodes follow a pattern of focusing on SoL stuff and Beerus wrecking things.  North kai voice actor doesnt even try  <br>Same shit different year. Honestly I wish I could go back to 2003 and tell everyone on /a/ that anime never gets better. Just rehashes of the same shit every fucking year with people eating it up. <br><br>DBS is garbage in my opinion with some retarded slice of life elements because Akira want's to be young again but sadly the fucker should have never come out of retirement.</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama never retired</br>  <br>He is 84 years old<br><br>He gets a free pass</br></br></br>  <br>Masako Nozawa is 79 and she's still energetic<br><br>isn't King Kai's seiyuu dying or something and that's why he sounds like shit?</br></br></br>  where the episode @  <br>As someone watching dragon ball japanese voices for the first time, I fucking love north kai.<br><br>It is such a stark comparison, the way the kai is animated and the way he speaks. I just love it.</br></br></br>  <br>I really love how they've been handling Super. I thought it would have hideous pacing, but they are just having a few episodes of SoL before getting into BoG, and I feel that they are a good thing. BoG shouldn't have major changes, but RoF should be rewritten completely to fit the setting, if they are even doing it.</br>  I agree with you, I wish they would hurry up and get through BoG.  So could the Super Seiya God defeat the Super Saiyan God?    <br>Everyone in the Saint Seiya verse is broken as fuck. Goku would stand no chance.</br>  <br>Nigger, a Golden Saint can already move at the speed of light and resist temperatures of 0K, and they were easily defeated by Hypnos/Thanathos, who were then easily defeated by God Cloths. It's not even a competition.</br>  <br> Only Half a Galaxy while boosted <br>He wouldn't even be able to beat Broly before LSSJ.</br></br>    <br>I think the main issue is how North Kai is animated as if he's using a completely different tone, not the voice itself.</br>  <br>I agree, I actually like the voice but it really doesn't fit the way he's acting on screen.</br>  <br><br>The problem is that they animate everything before recording lines, so the actor couldn't do a voice that fit his acting on screen, and they couldn't reanimate the scene or give it a different animation, as it would be out of character. I'd say they should change him, but I like his voice too much for that.</br></br>  Robot Girls Z Plus is Toei's best ongoing anime so far.  <br> The best Toei can do is 10 minutes per month </br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>Any longer and their anime becomes a QUALITY shitfest.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What am I looking at? Is that a dick?</br></br>  DBSuper or Sensui?  where can I download this? <br>I've never watched an anime as it came out before</br>  <br>It's actually pretty neat whern it's making fun of itself or the characters. Whis and Beers are consistently the best thing about it. The generic SOL parts are uninspired and uninteresting though.</br>  I only watch it with the Himawari comments, but it seems like the Japanese viewers don't even care about the show anymore, so it's boring to watch now.  <br><br>Why does it seem that they don't care about it anymore?</br></br>  <br>Big drop in viewers and comments</br>  <br><br>Source?</br></br>    <br><br>What site is that?</br></br>  <br><br>It also happened that everything except Sazae-san dropped rating that week.<br><br>What's your point?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really love his voice. Its just the animation is bit odd for his voice. If they redid the animation scene a bit, I think it would fit in a lot better.</br>  I've liked the episodes, they're very fanservicy which I like. Now that we've started the BoG arc I'm looking forward to the fighting. I was kinda disapointed we didn't see all the cameos at the party that we saw in the movie. Where was Launch? I think she had a cameo in the movie.<br><br> I look forward to seeing Pilaf and the gang as well.</br></br>  <br>The problem is that the character doesn't have to fit the VA, it's the other way around. The actors voice the scenes after they've been animated, and the VA did a shitty job with them.</br>  <br>My point is that it's boring to watch without the comments</br>  <br>Oh, so that's his new trick to make new enemies possible."Oh yes, Goku is the strongest in THIS universe, but there are other universes where everyone else is much stronger than him!".<br>That's how he started Z as well. Except it was just the transition from planet earth -&gt; the universe.<br><br>Toriyama confirmed uncreative.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's always been pretty shitty, even during Z all those years back.</br>  Which group is the better Subber?  <br> after they've been animated <br>That's no true, though.<br>It's barely some sketch one after a another.</br></br></br>  <br>None; they're all shit.<br>See it raw or leave, filthy plebshit</br></br>  <br>It's only been 1 day since the episode aired, what are you expecting?</br>  <br>He voices the narrator and Babidi too, so, no. Kaio's just a soft spoken guy.</br>  <br>Is that Hayato?</br>  The only good thing that come out of DB Super<br><br> Family SoL Comedy involve Krillin, 18, Marron w/ Roshi, Oolong and Turtle never </br></br>  <br>80% of the comments and viewers come in within that 1 day</br>  <br>Not DBsuper. they're shit</br>  How did King Kai get his planet back?  <br>does it matter?</br>  why does toriyama LOVE remake the same fucking story over and over now<br> at a party <br> someone comes to fight the saiyan boys <br> everyone watches the fight <br> villian becomes good in the end </br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all shit for some reason.</br>  <br>how does the earth moon keep coming back? they've destroyed it many times</br>  <br>He remade it with his Kaio powers probably</br>  <br>It's been destroyed twice.<br><br>Kami recreated it in after Roshi destroyed it in Dragon Ball.<br><br>It never came back after Piccolo destroyed it in Z</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>give me one other example of this</br>  <br>Or one at all, considering Beerus isn't really any more or less evil than he was.</br>  <br>Not everyone ages the same you inconsiderate prick<br><br>Also 5 years at that ages is a huge gap</br></br></br>  <br>They really phoned that fight in after hyping it up. I knew Supes was gonna win but the fight was shit. The first one was way better</br>  The real question is could he beat this guy  <br>This doesn't matter. TV ratings and game sales are the real indicators.</br>  <br>depends on which version. Goku reks New 52 Supes but loses to pretty much everything else</br>  <br>Honestly it feels like a lot of VAs suck in Super. Like Goku and Buu</br>  <br>Maybe because of the fact that it's retelling a story they already know, retard. <br><br>When new stuff comes up they'll check it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why bother with the retelling?</br>  Still no background animal people. I thought Torriyama rewatched/read Dragonball?  <br>just one? <br>Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!</br></br>  <br> Goku punch-Instant transmission combo Superman near a red giant. <br> the end </br></br>  <br>Kids are going to watch it anyway and Toei is too lazy to put any effort in it.</br>  So why are people comparing DB to Super at all?<br><br>DB was gag humor, but it was not SoL<br><br>They were comedy episodes, DB used ridiculous situations for comedy, not the everyday aspects of life.<br><br>Take this episode for example: It's all about finding a concubine for Roshi.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=z7i<wbr>cPXBRC3w</wbr>  [ ] [Embed]<br><br>The characters are having silly adventures, but they certainly aren't just sitting around.<br><br><br>Early Buu Saga and the Saiyaman episodes in the were closer to SoL than DB was.<br><br>Super needs more Mr.Satan as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Haven't watched it because I'm a huge fan of the original series and I know Super is butchering it.  <br>DBS's humor is shit tier compared to DB's. It pisses me off when people it's just like Dragonball.</br>  <br>They changed the story even changed the original freeza motive.</br>  <br><br>With the namek dragon balls<br><br>They released a special manga chapter on that recently, so it's canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Furry pls go.</br>  <br> Implying Goku just doesn't focus a kahmehaha through Superman's eyes and destroys his brain <br> Implying Goku doesn't just IT and shove his hand through Superman's chest </br></br>  <br> Denying over 10 years worth of Dragonball material because muh furries <br><br>Someones fetish is not an excuse for Toriyama to be senile.</br></br></br>   don't mind the SoL stuff so much because it fleshes out some characters and scenarios that really desperately needed to be touched on <br><br> but all the promised future arcs/fights are all based on the movies <br><br>Is it so wrong to want a original arc of something we haven't seen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio + The world could rek most of the Seiya Verse by himself. His stand and Jojo's move at the speed of light, are way stronger, and he has timestop. Add his vampire immortality and gg saints.</br>  I don't like nitpicking at things but this is literally commie tier  Did Toriyama just totally forget about Yajirobe? I don't remember him being in KtK, and I haven't heard anything about him in FnF<br><br>He was definitely about as strong as Gokuu when he was introduced. He should be the strongest non-Saiyan Z Fighter.</br></br>  <br>Shit voice acting, shitty retelling of the Battle of the Gods story. I'm only watching it for the nostalgia.<br><br>Reboots, retellings, sequels, new superpowers that make no sense. Dragon Ball is bridging the gap between manga/anime and the downright atrocious capeshit Americans call comics. Now the only thing we need is a convoluted crossover between Dragonball and Naruto that is declared canon, only to be declared non-canon five years later.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Universe 6 Arc will not be.</br></br>  Whis saw Beeruses dick.  <br><br>That's also after retelling BoG+more SoL+RoF+more SoL</br></br>  <br><br>Champa already appeared in the manga. Episode 5 on the anime.</br></br>  <br>This, although I would blame today's standards for writing this lazy.</br>  <br>This is retarded.An episode that's out for 3 weeks has more views than an episode out for one day. It's had a pretty steady viewcount for these three episodes</br>  <br>Pretty much. We'll get Champa soon enough.<br><br>More importantly, Fem Whis.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. I think it's pretty clear that Toei is phoning this in really hard.</br>  <br> Champa soon <br>In the anime? Because the anime is moving at a pretty glacial pace</br></br>  <br><br> He should be the strongest non-Saiyan Z Fighter. <br><br>Debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only time Yajirobe ever trained was when Karin and Kami forced him to before the Saiyans arrived. He hasn't trained since, and he still can't even use his ki. He's weaker than Yamcha.</br>   dem DBS rating drops <br><br>Ayy lmao<br><br>Not even chinks like moe shit in mah Dragon ball</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga's chillin at Karin's place.</br>  <br> Toei is phoning this in really hard. <br>I don't understand why they're doing this. Why aren't they treating the return of fucking Dragonball like it's a bigger deal? Isn't Dragonball one of their biggest cash cows?</br></br>  <br>"non-Saiyan Z Fighter" includes Buu, Piccolo and 18. It is not even remotely debatable, it's a retarded claim.</br>  guys post yfw gohan lost his shit and this shit starts playing while he fights <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KDm<wbr>qDipQn9A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>You're right. I guess I meant human Z fighter.</br>  <br>That's because underage don't buy BD?</br>  <br>We're getting Universe 6 arc later.</br>  <br>In the manga Champa is hanging out in space during the first fight between Beers and Goku at Kai's place.</br>  <br>so where are abo and cado? if they are friends with the z warriors why werent they around in the epilogue or in super?</br>  <br>inert is jokesubs, I warned you fags.</br>  <br>Just watch it raw, dude. You've presumably already watched the movie, so you should be able to understand it.</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br> finally getting the SOL slow and low key DBZ we've always wanted <br><br> fucking spics just want ssj5 brolly vs ssj9 Uubpan </br></br></br>  <br>Goku is great. Buu is weird, because it sounds like a baby with an adult's voice., which it should, but it's still awkward.</br>  <br>It's like Dragonball! Only without the funny jokes! Or interesting fights! Or sense of purpose! Or any of Dragonball/Z's good qualities!</br>  do you guys think brolly is going to happen?  <br>The original DBZ didn't have funny jokes. That TFS<br><br> interesting fights <br>Thats the point of SOL.</br></br></br></br>  <br> basing an entire series on 3 episodes <br>Go watch the first 3 episodes of Dragon Ball and tell me that they have funny jokes, interesting fights or a sense of purpose.</br></br>  <br> ¡No Entiendo!</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's PreCure. PreCure definitely seems to be where the money goes. I would assume Sentai and Rider are decent sources of income for Toei, too, but I don't know the numbers on that.</br>  <br>it cant be dragon ball again you fuckwad, since you know everyone is old. Unless you want them to focus solely on Goten and Trunks which would be stupid because they are literally 1000x times stronger than goku was at their age. plus there have been some interesting fights already with beerus.</br>  <br> liking slice of life anime <br> implying anyone watches DB for the plot and not the fights <br> being this delusional </br></br></br>  <br>What the heck that you're even talking about.<br>Not him btw.</br></br>  <br> it cant be dragon ball again you fuckwad <br>So then what is it? It sure as hell isn't DBZ and it sure isn't DB. If it's trying to be it's own thing it sure as hell is sucking at it because we got three episodes of nostalgia bait</br></br>  <br>They had the excuse of setting everything up. In DBS we get the mundane shit of the Z cast's life because????</br>  <br>  implying sol have plot <br>Action genre has more plot than SOL plot folded 1000 times.</br></br>  <br>Bulma pissing herself was kind of funny.</br>  <br>Because it's setting up the events of Battle of Gods. The problem is that you've seen Battle of Gods so you don't give a shit about Beerus, if this wasn't a retooling of that movie then you wouldn't be complaining.</br>  <br>SOL DBZ is a fantastic fucking ideas.<br><br>its hilarious within its own right.<br>Vegeta goes to work.<br>Piccolo buys baby's clothes.<br>Goten and Trunks learn to drive.<br><br>But no, gotta FIGHTFIGHTFIGHTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEESUPERSAIYAINJINGODDUSAIYAIJIN<wbr>SUPER</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  retooling <br>It's more of retconned BoG than retelling.</br></br>  <br>Did we honestly need a entire new series to retell the movies but worse?</br>  <br>It could be interesting like Vegeta's vacation but instead we got a slideshow of all the actual interesting funny parts. I wanted to watch Vegeta ride the train.</br>  <br>its beginning of Buu saga dbz <br><br>the best part of DBZ aka the great saiyaman saga.</br></br></br>  <br>I just hope that Gohan still gets drunk at Bulma's party.</br>   they are retelling the movies <br> but everything is different and much better <br> people hate it </br></br>  <br>its not just the movies though</br>  <br>It's not retell if it's different. It's retconning.</br>  <br> its beginning of Buu saga dbz <br>Haha no. Gohan isn't a character that matters anymore</br></br>  Dragon Ball Super is what I have been waiting for. Sure, YOU may not like it, but that's okay because I still get to watch it ever weekend.<br><br>For many fucking years I had to put up with cringey fan ficton and cringey fans making up such hardcore 2edgy4me crawwwwling in my skin debates about the series that it has literally left me in a state of such apathy I simply laugh at people that even mentions non-canon dragon ball garbage.<br><br>There is a reason why GT is non-canon and it isn't even because Toriyama was not involved, even though that is literally the major reason why it isn't canon. But GT disappointed Toriyama to the point where he publicly expressed his distaste for it, and the reason why is because Toriyama went full retard on what it meant to experience the Dragon Ball journey. You can see this shit in all of their old movies, how Broly is essentially a mentally handicapped autistic and sadistic saiyan who is somehow a special snowflake because his buffed transformation is dubbed "Legendary Super Saiyan." Following the logical pattern of super saiyans, Broly "Legendary Super Saiyan" is basically a sub-par Super Saiyan 2 similar to Trunks and Vegeta when they fought Cell.<br><br>Not questioning people's tastes, but at least get it right. Dragonball has and always will be about the good things in life. Of course there will be some serious evil bad guys if only because the tone demands for it, but once the conflict is over it's back up to care-free light hearted go luckiness.<br><br>Fuck all of the faggots who try to make Dragonball out to be a try hard 2edgy4me series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What has changed besides the fact that they're on a boat?</br>  <br>im not talking literally. Im talking about the tone of the show jesus christ</br>  <br> toriyama <br><br>what a horrible typo. I meant to say Toei. damn my dyslexia</br></br></br>  <br>The tone was different too in the fact that Gohan actually mattered.</br>  <br>The whole series from now on will be set on that boat.</br>  <br>  source my ass and i'm a literal faggot </br>   yfw you won't be a kid and listen to Chala Head Chala for the first time again <br><br>Is this the most Iconic Opening of an Anime series?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GHn<wbr>fX1RmZX8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Dragonball has and always will be about the good things in life. <br>Then why is it been about how Goku and Vegeta think that everything is gay except training?<br>Dragonball also had the element of going to new places seeing new people and watching Goku learn new shit. Pretty sure DBS will have barely any of that. At least not for 2 arcs. DBS is pretty shit compared to Dragonball</br></br></br>  <br>yes it is.</br>  <br>Who's the best sub group for this show?</br>  <br>its literally been 3 episodes. <br><br>get over yourself</br></br></br>  <br>he never was</br>  <br> Dragonball: Berserk edition </br>   Pilaf Gang episode next week <br>Nice.</br>  <br>I just want to listen to Kid Goku's theme as he overcomes the fearsome opponent once more.

Don't listen to the misguided casuals.</br>  <br> He's weaker than Yamcha. <br>Nah, he killed one of Picollo's sons so that makes him pretty much top tier pre kami training. Yamacha killed a saibaiman so that puts him around Raditz level, but there's no point if he can't land a hit which Yaji could against Vegeta.</br></br>  <br>He looks like Yamcha so...</br>  Sailor Moon Crystal levels of failure.  <br><br>Not him btw but you both missing the point.</br></br>  <br> not posting the cool parts before that where he destroys everyone  <br><br>i cant deny that frieza killing gohan instantly is fucking awful but no one can deny gohans badassery before that scene</br></br></br>  <br>So you has been watching SS crystal? For what purpose?</br>  <br>the person we are replying to said that toriyama has been writing the same scenario over and over again. then he specified that scenario being that everyone is at a party and a bad guy comes which everyone then watches someone else fight and then the bad guy becomes good. <br><br>no where in the canon of dragon ball does this happen</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, we loved the SoL episodes and unlike murricans we actually watched DB and Arale before DBZ:</br>  <br> Spics <br>Please stop including spics in your criticisms of the fanbase. This is Americans who want what you are saying<br><br>Spics and probably people who have read all the manga love what is happening so far</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br> Not him btw but you both missing the point. <br>What point are we missing? There is absolutely no other point in the canonical story where this  sort of scenario happens. The only time it happened was in BoG itself</br></br>  <br>Those mooks were Roshi tier anon.

Good going projector-kun.</br>  So the Supreme Kai muses that Beerus is a sort of yang to the others yin, that he takes life whereas they create it. But then Old Kai cuts him off and tells him Beerus serves no purpose at all and he just destroys everything aimlessly for no reason.<br><br>If he doesn't do it because it is his job of sorts, that makes him rather shallow. At least Frieza had his reasons why he'd suddenly destroy a planet or exterminate life on them. Even Cell had a reason for wanting to wipe out the universe, since he was a living weapon and his programming evolved to that point.</br></br>  <br>It is his job. He just does it aimlessly</br>  <br> Beerus defense force </br>  <br>Freeza boss is beerus. Beerus command his weak hencmen freeza to destroy planet</br>  Beerus sealed Elder Kai in Z sword.  <br>So it mean beerus is weaker or not majin boo level.</br>  <br><br>He wasn't back then.<br><br>And<br><br> boo </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're are wrong beerus is defiantly powerer.</br>  <br>Basically this. <br><br>Beerus doesn't give a damn about what he destroys. He just blasts whatever he wants on a whim. <br><br>He makes no distinction between planets that matter and planets which no one would mind if they were gone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And <br> &gt;boo <br>What's wrong with boo</br></br></br>  <br>  defiantly powerer <br>Can you repeat that in english?</br></br>  Why is eating such a comical thing in Dragon Ball?<br><br> Goku is funny because he eats huge amounts of food <br> Vegeta is funny because he eats huge amounts of food <br> Buu is funny because he eats huge amounts of food and kills people over it <br> Beerus is funny because he eats huge amounts of food and kills people and whole planets and whole universes over it <br><br>It is funny watching Goku stack up plate after plate of food, but holy shit Akira, can't you think up anything else for a comical perk for your characters? Fucks sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Was the last girl Roshi was checking out Mai?  <br> He wasn't back then. <br>Have you read the DB source's?</br></br>  Anyone else bothered by the voices in the show? Goku sounds the a 10-year old and Gohan sounds like an insecure homo, even more feminine than the females in the show.   Beerus makes a joke about killing all the dinosaurs on earth <br> Even though they still exist in DB universe <br>I'm starting to think Akira isn't the only senile person on the Super staff.</br></br>  <br>Yeah it was hilarious when goten and trunks flew at the jewelry store, and then when krillin did while in traffic, WASN'T EXPECTING THAT!</br>  <br>Came to the thread just for this daily reminder.</br>  <br>It's been officially romanized as Buu by every Shueisha/TOEI source. Only Kanzenshuu fags are obsessed with "muh reference".</br>  <br>How is it better? pacing is now shit.</br>  <br><br>Beerus probably wasn't as powerful as Buu in Elder Kai's time.</br></br>  <br>Japanese culture is all about being proper. <br><br>Thus, improper, outrageous eating is funny.</br></br></br>  <br>Old Kai is just a bitter loser.</br>  <br>Yeah, and Krillin is actually Kulilin, no one complaining about that.</br>  <br> Two episodes of introducing characters for those who missed the movies <br> bad pacing </br></br>  <br>Have you watched BoG that's in it.</br>  <br>I guarantee you that they will not show up at all in Super.</br>  <br>Not at all, the pacing is much better now<br><br><br>Copying a joke line from redlettermedia doesn't make you sound smart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Movie introduced characters and then got to the point, so far is 3 episodes of nothing.</br>  <br>He did, you just have poor reading comprehension</br>  <br>so would you like no one to react to it at all?</br>  <br>They didn't have Beerus do his little dance before Whis and him go off to Goku.<br><br>Its Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, they even added more action from Bills to please ADHD ridden idiots like you.</br>  <br>That's because they had a whopping 90 minutes to introduce and resolve a conflict. Now they have time to flesh out skipped over ideas.</br>  <br> Copying a joke line from redlettermedia doesn't make you sound smart. <br><br>What? I don't even know what you're talking about, the jokes are just bad, not nearly as funny as DB or even BoG or RoF, so far is as funny as DBZ filler, which was awful, everybody remembers the Piccolo and goku learn to drive episode but forget about the rest.</br></br></br>  <br>If you were sealed into a sword for millions of years you would be salty too.</br>  <br> &gt;implying anyone watches DB for the plot and not the fights <br>The fights in DBZ are kind of shitty though.</br></br>  <br>I was just telling him he's delusional if he thinks the majority of us wants mindless fighting and we don't know the last pubic hair about DB's story development and characters' personality. All he did was throw a self-bloating pancake argument around.</br>  I hope Universe 6 has Gohan who didn't stop training.  <br>Maybe thats why fat cat is in the main universe. Fleeing an unstoppable Gohan.</br>  <br>Siayan, Namek, Android and Cell sagas all start with conflict right away, guess which one is the only one with slice of life "funny" shit? the worst one of all.</br>  <br> Isn't Dragonball one of their biggest cash cows? <br>No? Look at how they're treating Saint Seiya.<br><br>Protip: Toei doesn't give a shit about nostalgiafags. They know they can sell garbage to them and they will still eat it up. That's why Toei spends very little time on the animation. They know people don't really care as long as it has a big name on it.<br><br>Toei really has bigger sources of income, namely Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and Precure. New kids are born everyday. That means they can repeat those shows forever because they'll always get a new audience who'll be open to bug men and guys in spandex.<br><br>Be glad that Toei is even bothering to make DBZ material every now and then. Soon the studio will only produce CG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love it and you faggots cannot convince me other wise. <br><br><br>SoL complainers seems never saw the original series, we always had "happy days" episide in-between arcs. Action will start soon, but I don't mind all this nostalgic episodes we're having so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the fact that they are from an adjacent universe means they are more similar than say the main one and Universe 2 or something. So more subtle differences.</br>  <br>Can anyone explain to me why Whis is servant to Beerus when Whis is the prime being in gven universe?<br><br>Is it like Whis is "owner" of Beerus and just looks after him?</br></br></br>  <br>unstoppable gohans you mean</br>  <br><br> Universe 6 <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SyR<wbr>oF689VRE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>You didn't even know the plot of DBS?</br></br>  <br> good idea <br><br>Kek. Your even worse than the spics. SoL is terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, it would be between Yajirobe and Tien, had Yajirobe kept training. <br><br>Yajirobe was equal to Goku (or close to it) when they first met, and that was after Goku had narrowly lost to Tien.</br></br></br>  <br>plot of DBS?</br>  <br>DB will always be superior to any DB secondary no matter what</br>  <br><br>Retelling of the movies and then going to Universe 6 too look for Super Dragon Balls.</br></br>  <br> Super needs more Mr.Satan as well. </br>   tfw people talking about canon and non-canon as if it's a real thing in Dragonball <br>Toriyama doesn't give a shit. Nips in general aren't anal about it the way amerifats are.<br><br>That special? Yeah it had Vegeta's little brother, but at this point, Toriyama probably forgot about him. Just enjoy the ride as long as it's going on, but hop off and forget about it as soon as the ride ends, because Toriyama will most likely forget Super in the future too.<br><br>You faggots are overthinking this stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>Toriyama is the artist who remembers the least about his own series.</br>  <br>I hope the other universes aren't alternate realities of the one we already know.</br>  <br>Dragon Ball is set in reality where 12 different universes exist based on same origin.<br><br>The one DB series follow is universe 7.<br><br>Fat Beerus and Female Whis are from Universe 6.<br><br>Each Universe has it's own God of Destruction and Beerus is the weakest one.<br><br>Dragon Ball Super main concept is universes colliding.<br><br>For example in one Goku never came back so Gohan never stopped training or Vegeta was in fact the strongest Saiyan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They probably aren't, they are probably just 12 different areas with different jurisdiction, otherwise the Kais would have too much job.<br><br><br> Dragon Ball is set in reality where 12 different universes exist based on same origin. <br>At least say that's your theory, don't push your headcanon into others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Beerus is the weakest one <br><br>Source?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering they still have Beerus and Whis just fat and female, I doubt it.<br><br>It's going to be the same cast but wth different circumstances.</br></br></br>  I watch the new Dragon Ball every Sunday like a good boy and I am having so much fun. You can't do anything about it.<br><br>Whiz and Beerus are the best thing that has happened to DB ever since Vegeta was introduced. I also really like hearing the VA of the old gang: Mayumi Tanaka, Toshio Furukawa, Muten Roshi's VA, and my favourite -- Toru Furuya. Next time we will get our God and Saviour Shigeru Chiba too. Can't wait.</br></br>  <br>He was the first to appear.</br>  <br>Good logic as expected as DB fanbase.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit the Beerus and Whiskey porn is going to be massive.<br><br><br><br>Beerus seemed pretty smug when meeting Champa in the trailer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Spics <br><br>Burger, pls.<br><br>No matter how hard you try to force this meme, you will always come out as the ones bitching.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   All this /v/ and normalfag anger.  <br>I have wanted Sol like this since Dragon Ball ended!</br>  Which subs are the least shit?  SOL DB has given us some fantastic moments, like pic related. I look forward to when the action kicks in (this is DB after all), but I hope they have more of these great moments between arcs.  <br><br>Why couldn't we have had a female Beerus instead of a fat male one? We just had a fat-ass male villain with Majin Buu, did we really need another? The only prominent evil female the series had was 18.</br></br>  <br>Spics are more of a meme on /m/ than on /a/.</br>  <br>Being the strongest while being true neutral can be lonely. He does it to feel responsibility or probably something greater then this.</br>  <br>Are you triggered?</br>  <br>Is this fat villain some fat people hate?</br>  <br>Was actually kind of dissapointed that the wedding was offscreened.</br>   dragon ball is getting into multiverse comic shit <br><br>This is seriously openng DB to be going on FOREVER.</br></br>  <br>This picture really angers me. Gohan has become a fucking normie scum. Just look at him. What a fucking disgusting nerd. Ruined character. Literally the worst thing to ever happen to the whole franchise.</br>  So I just finish BoG, did Gohan really almost kill Videl and their baby and nobody seem to care??? I can't stop laughing right now.  <br>In Latin America, the first series of Dr.Slump was named "Arale".<br><br>I wasn't until the '99 (or so) version of Dr Slump (which we also got) that they changed the name back to "Dr.Slump.</br></br></br>  <br> Nips in general aren't anal about it the way amerifats are. <br>This is a real understatement. Westerns are so fucking autistic it pisses me off.</br></br>  <br>Goku didn't even actually lose to Ten. It was a really a draw, but Ten came out on top because of a car.</br>  <br>Is this english? Why i cannot understand it.</br>  <br>Goku looks so fresh in that suit</br>  <br>Because you are an idiot.</br>  <br>If I remember correctly, it has always been like that.</br>  <br>BoG was a mess, more at 11.</br>  <br>After 5 year why the baby has not been born?</br>  <br>So, Gohan's mom is indeed Piccolo?</br>  <br>Who fucking cares about Gohan? Goku has always been the top hotness.</br>  <br><br> Literally the worst thing to ever happen to the whole franchise <br><br>I'd argue the Senzu beans are the most cancerous reset button shit in the franchise that should not exist. The new return of Frieza movie should have just been named Senzu Bean Picnic: The Movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is not even english you idiot.</br>  <br>BoG and RoF are retconned. None of the movies are canon again.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128316103 <br>Did you mislink there buddy?</br>  <br> Gohan has become a fucking normie scum. Just look at him. What a fucking disgusting nerd. <br><br>As opposed to...?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you actually autistic? It really seems like you are.</br>  <br>100% agreed, but at least we got something. I totally expected for them to gloss over it completely.</br>  <br>He probably wants an edge mcqueen like what we saw at the end of the the Cell saga, except that was him at the cringiest moment of a teen's life. It's no surprise he grew out of it and became a normie.</br>   DBGT had more action than this <br><br>Fucking Toei.</br></br>  <br>But this is made by Toriyama faggot. If anything it was Toei that had more action.<br><br>Which was fucking retarded by the way.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Saying "retconned" means that they will be on the same level as the previous movies and that has nothing to do with the series when in reality we are getting a retelling of them in said series.</br></br>  <br>How often do we have to say that....<br>Anyway...again....Gohan does not love to fight like Goku and Vegeta...</br></br>  <br><br>The corpse known as Future Gohan.</br></br>  <br>He was only that because of circumstances, he didn't want that kind of life.</br>  <br>So that is. That explains how contradiction betwen them is scary.</br>  I hope we at least get breakdancing Beerus in the series.  So did the series retcon when the Beerus comes to Earth as being only a few months after Buu Saga? Or are we to assume that between the first 3 episodes, a lot of time has passed?  <br> implying <br>It's in his blood, he is a Saiyajin.</br></br>  <br>Future Gohan was traumatized, trained and had morale to keep going.<br>He had his potential.<br><br>How the FUCK he didn't achieve SSJ2?Was Super 16 that fucking important to Gohan?<br><br>Fuck Toriyama, fucking hack shitpisser.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No the timeline has been changed.</br>  <br><br>Am I the only fag that liked SSJ4? It was pretty nifty how the last transformation made the Saiyan more feral looking, combining their default look and the great ape. These new God transformations suck so bad visually and in concept.</br></br>  <br> tfw everyone bullies you for saying that you killed the androidlets and Cell when it's common knowledge that Satan kills them <br> no face cuz Gohan is humble </br></br>  <br>So Goku lite with a much worse track record? No, nerdy Gohan, who his own unique character, is much better.....with that said, now that he is a married man with a child on the way soon, he should still be training. He can't be that stupid. He was supposed to have learned this lesson in the buu arc. Come on Toriyama! Keep Gohan relevant!</br>  <br> is made by Toriyama <br><br>And this is the problem.<br><br>DB was made by Toriyama and was a borefest.<br><br>DBZ (late DB manga) was basically entirely rewritten by Jump editors, thus why it's actually good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No retconned mean it's more of demoted to be inferior or irrelevant. I hardly think that BoG try hard ever consider the movie is canon before.</br>  <br>Future Trunk and Future Gohan are the best characters in this whole Z series.<br><br>Not including original DB as it was less serious.</br></br></br>  <br><br>SSJ4 was really amazing. I agree that it's better than SSGSSJGSS.</br></br>  if Gohan has a lot of potential, why Future Gohan wasn't strong as Cell Gohan?  <br>It's retconned,</br>  <br>Both SSJ4 and SSJ5 are super cool.</br>  "Hi God, came to chill in the party?"  <br>Why am I so attracted to him?</br>  <br>You can only waste a trauma on SSJ transformation. You either get a bigger trauma or train like a motherfucker and find the right state of mind to get into further forms, like Goku did.</br>  <br>Is the special even canon? Was he even a part of its writing? It just seems like the the anime just wanted an excuse to make a new special.</br>  <br>Maybe the anime padded it out a bunch, but the first fight in DB was Yamcha, I guess, but after that there wasn't a real fight until the tournament.</br>  <br>"Dark" Super Saiyan is my favorite.</br>  <br>and then grand tour</br>  <br> superman wins cause he has no limits! <br> meanwhile in dc comics he and wonder woman get btfo by an aquaman villain <br>sure screwattack sure</br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree with you, the design is perfect.</br></br>  <br>It's canon but the anime special differs slightly from the manga, where Trunks already achieved SSJ through training and not by seeing Gohan die.<br><br>Trunks also mentions Gohan dying 4 years earlier than his time travel.</br></br></br>   no sexy Chi-Chi in a bikini <br> no sexy Bulma in a bikini <br> no sexy 18 in a bikini <br><br>They had one job, and they blew it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the ape touches were great and should've been mandatory.<br><br>SSJ = Golden hair.<br>SSJ 2 = Golden hair, sparks and golden tail grows forcefully.<br>SSJ 3 = Golden hair, slight golden fur, tail.<br>SSJ 4 = As it was.<br><br>I am really fucking tired of Toriyama just notgiving a fuck about canon established things like the ape origin of Saiyans.<br><br>Wasn't Oozaru the TRUE FORM of every Saiyan?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it took Goku a lot of time in the afterlife to achieve it, and Vegeta attained through magic bullshit. Gohan's transformation was basically just a full on rage mode that we only saw glimpses of throughout the series up to that point.</br>  <br> DB was made by Toriyama and was a borefest <br>Get a load of this faggot</br></br>  <br> not Broly Saiyan God </br>  <br>The true majinga Robotto fans love RGZ, that shitty maymay didn't even use a scan as an example.</br>  <br>Future Gohan isn't canon.<br><br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Broly <br> Pure of heart <br> Would manage to find five other pure hearted Saiyans </br></br></br>  Which subs should i download?  <br>The Dark Super Saiyan was first used by Broly. This technique takes you to a new crazy level of a Super Saiyan! A Dark Super Saiyan has powers way past regular Super Saiyan, but unlike the regular there are some side effects. To begin to achieve this mode your heart must be black, soulless, unforgiving, and ruthless. The only thing you would ever want to achieve this form is death and destruction! This attack also may alter your personality for good! Dark Super Saiyan is one of the most strongest Super Saiyan forms ever!</br>  <br>Do you love him as you love God?</br>  <br>Download the raws.</br>  <br>How many gods do they know anyways<br><br> Little green god <br> Big Red horny god <br> Blue cricket god <br> Mohawk god <br> Sexual pervert god <br> super saiyan god <br> qt cat god </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's in the manga.</br>  <br>Why does SSJ Gohan, with his one ridiculous bang, look so bad ass? As much as I like the whole concept of his Ultimate firm, I miss Gohan going SSJ</br>  <br> find five loving wives <br> impregnate them <br> wait a couple of years <br> ??? <br> profit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>N-No, that would be blasfemous.</br>  <br><br>SSJ4 and all the following deviantarts fanarts are horrendous. The new minimalistic god forms are a breath of fresh air and really drive the point that they are on a whole different plane.</br></br>  <br>The autism is bleeding through the keyboard onto your posts. It's a fucking cartoon anon holy fucking shit, you're acting like a capefag.</br>  <br><br>You got sexy Beerus in bath instead. Be grateful.</br></br>  <br>Called it, I said it once, this was going to flop worse than GT if they kept the Slice of Life shit, yet autists here were like NO BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE FANS WANTED HURR.<br><br>There you have it.</br></br></br>  <br> Future Gohan isn't canon <br><br>In a way it really isn't, but he's part of the first timeline.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I have to admit. It's not that bad and as it touches their Saiyan roots.<br><br>That's what I want with all this new shit going on. For the Saiyans to look like Saiyans, to them bringing the tails back. Without them they look like any regular human.<br><br>So far Tarble is the only one that managed to keep his tail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he goes SSJ in BoG for some reason, despite still having Mystic according to the DBS OP. Will they retcon that as well, or just ignore the fact that Mystic doesn't require SSJ?</br>  <br>Does Broly have a god form in any of the games yet? He pretty much gets every form in those games.</br>  <br>  differentpalne <br>Yes the shipwreck plane.</br></br>  <br> DB was made by Toriyama and was a borefest. <br>You have the worst taste imaginable.</br></br>  <br><br>How can you understand anything with just the raw? I think you guys take your weabooism a bit too far.</br></br>  <br> Hair changes colour from gold to pinkish red; it doesn't even change shape or anything <br> BREATH OF FRESH AIR </br></br>  <br>Beerus is best qt</br>  <br><br> Goku reks New 52 Supes <br><br>Superman in the New 52, has been ridiculously overpowered.<br>For example, he can temporarily power up to his "Superdoom" form (adds the power of Doomsday) and also do an additional power up where he gains the powers of Brainiac. Superman could literally just will Goku out of existence if he wanted to at that point.<br>Or he could use his recently acquired "Super Flair" power (unleashes all of his power at once, but loses his powers for 24 hours afterwards) once he's in his Doomsday/Brainiac form. That would be equivalent of like a trillion of Goku's maximum powered spirit bombs.<br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's similar to Frieza's final form/bishonen line, instead of having them getting bigger and even more hairy, they go the other way around, like some divine deity, why can't people get this?</br></br>  <br>Damn and I thought this shit was dumb <br><br>Cape comics confirmed for autism.</br></br></br>  why didnet goku and vagina have god transformations in GT?  <br><br>Just when I think Dragon Ball has gone too far with the broken powerups, I just look at some recent capeshit and DB doesn't even come close.</br></br>  <br>People actually get paid to write this shit. Goddamn.</br>  <br>His body is slimmer as well. He actually looks more like he did when he fought Piccolo at the World Tournament. It actually is a breath of fresh air, when all the previous forms focused on increased muscle mass and just being huge in general.</br>  All I want are new doujins with Videl and 18.<br>Female Whis is fine too.</br>  <br>  bishounen forms <br>  God or goddess has to be a bishounen <br>Are you a faggot?</br></br></br>  No, no the pudin!   tfw never gonna get to suck Trunks boy penis   <br>Are you even thinking when you were typing this.</br>  <br>I don't think it's what the fans didn't want, but wow was it executed in the blandest way possible. Most of the episodes are stillshots galore and you can predict a large sum of the dialogue. Even I could do better directing and storyboarding while keeping the same script.<br><br>All Super needs is dynamism, gag cliches (like that King Kai flying upwards) and keep a decent pace.</br></br></br>  <br>Where does that reasoning even come from? Look at any mythology, be it Ancient Indian, Greek, Japanese, whatever, and you will notice all deities become BIGGER when they power up. Or alternatively, the size corresponds to power 99% of the time. It's simple science, really. Becoming effeminate is the exact opposite of becoming stronger.<br><br><br>So basically rehashing the looks from the beginning of Z is a breath of fresh air now? Fuck off, you dumb cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br> really drive the point that they are on a whole different plane. <br>The plane of lazyness.</br></br>  <br><br>Frieza's final form was drastically different than his first. Goku doesn't look different at all except different hair color and slightly thinner. It's just shit, fuck you.</br></br>  <br>This bitch can't even beat Broly. Petty half Galaxy Buster WHILE BUFFED. He stops at Cell and can't beat anything above that.</br>  <br> tfw for every well written bit of Superman material there is always shit like that to counter it <br><br>Poor Superman can't catch a break.</br></br></br>  Anyone else happy to see SS3 go? SS3 is ugly as shit. SSGSS doesn't look great, either, but it's an improvement. SS2 and SSG are the best.  <br>It's not going to be pudding this time.</br>  <br>So the new transformations are based on Goku being a vanilla midget.<br><br>Okay, right, I'll stay with the previous transformations.</br></br></br>  <br>Forget it anon, best Videl is dead, the actual soulless Videl won't get any special attention, all my hopes are in female Whis getting raped by fat faceless cats.</br>  <br>I want you to know, anon. That I like your opinions very much.</br>  <br>I'm glad to see it leave but I'm kinda wondering why it was introduced in the first place if this is the end of it. It literally accomplished nothing. SSJ2 will be missed though, even if Toei is too lazy to animate the lightning.</br>  <br>Anyone can make their muscles bigger but real power makes you beautiful. <br><br>Like best girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Take a rage dump, fellas.</br></br>  <br>SSG is trash. Enjoy your glorified Kaioken.</br>  <br>Flashy shit for the kids. Goku was said to have achieved it in otherworld due to a lack of mortal life and therefore limitless exertion.<br><br>Think of it as a novelty, it's not like Goku can ever use it practically.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying doujin artists could be assed to pull away from drawing Precure waifus to draw frumpy Dragon Ball girls <br><br>I'd like some Lunch and Miss Piza doujins but that's not going to happen either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  real power <br>  the weakest main villain <br>  even weaker than frieza <br>NO!</br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically it was only attained by breaking the rules of physics, similar to how Gotenks can use it because fusion is also breaking the rules. In other words, SSJ3 is something that can't happen naturally.</br>  <br>It's not even a glorified Kaioken, sadly.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I'm not basing myself on mythology or anything, frieza's final form is just an example. Is it really that hard to understand that the god forms look different to drive the point that they are on an entirely different level? They are gods, they aren't concerned with how they look. Just look at beerus.<br><br>It all comes downs to you guys not liking it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it wrong if I like DBS Videl just as much as original Videl?</br>  <br> SSJ3 Bardock, Vegeta and Trunks <br> SSJ3 and SSJ4 Broly <br> no SSJ Nappa with a golden mustache </br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, SSJ3 is a true black sheep that no Saiyan should reach. Which is why Toei's idea of an SSJ4 is inherently pointless. <br><br>God Energy spices things up though. It means that Goku and whoever else now has the ability to transcend race and become completely limitless. Its potential is far superior.</br></br></br>  <br><br> It literally accomplished nothing <br><br>Neither did ascended Saiyan and we saw it even less than the hideously ugly SSJ3. A shame too, Trunks made it look really cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, cause we know this is bait.</br>  <br>It isn't  ;_; </br>  <br> Overly roided bulk shitbag <br> Cool <br>No. Smaller is always better.</br></br></br>  so how strong is this guy?  <br>Nappa is just irrelevant</br>  <br><br>Low test faggot detected.</br></br>  <br>he</br>  So is DBSuper just gonna reanimate the Beerus and Freiza fight with inferior animation? Seems pretty silly.  <br> I love cocks <br>Go away, DB has always been about buff men, ever since the beginning.</br></br>  <br>  You would not understand ME!ME!ME! <br>Not dis shit again. STOP RIGHT THERE!!</br></br>  <br>The only man who can stand up to Whis.</br>  For once, I think the dub is better than the sub. The voices of Gohan and Goku are still way too high pitched for my liking, but I'm enjoying it nevertheless.  <br>Are you implying the animation of the last two movies was any good?</br>  <br>It's been about gags from the beginning, buff men were just present at times.</br>  <br>Not at all but I am thinking they will be at least better than the godawful animation super will display.</br>  <br><br>Don't you have a dealer to pay?</br></br>  I knew Beerus and Whis were assholes from the movie, but holy shit!  <br>Nice taste, dick sucker.</br>  <br>Course not, Freiza will be defeated in a karaoke contest first.</br>  <br>Did he even appear in the manga?</br>  just watch<br><br>SSG will be a form only pure blooded saiyans can posess<br>leaving it off limits for gohan, goten, trunks, and pan<br><br> Then SSG Broly will show up <br><br>calling it now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him but it was really good. I mean you can't say its bad.<br><br><br>But it's true, you guys are just as stubborn as Vegeta.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but they are going to flesh it out a bit more. The shoe on head retarded requirements for Supa Saya pepol God will likely get totally changed because it isn't practical.</br></br>  <br> Although Grand Kai does not appear in the Dragon Ball manga, he is mentioned there. In fact, his characterization in the anime was suggested to the production staff by the manga's author Akira Toriyama himself. </br>  it wouldve held peoples interest if they had continued from the original DBZ epilogue point. beerus is a good villain and feels like a threat. but back home youve got buu saga 1.5 and they cant get any shit about the timeline right, they're jumping all over the place trying to insert pointless events that battle of the gods already more or less covered.<br><br>we couldve got a non-sucky pan, and non-slutty bulla as she was originally envisioned by toriyama (child genius with hidden power), but instead its trunks being his usual bart simpson ripoff. fuck this.</br></br>  <br>No but he was designed by Toriyama (along with the whole otherworld tournament) so he may as well have.</br>  <br>You're fucking retarded</br>  <br> was really good <br> disgusting CG </br></br>  <br>You sound like a fag, m8.</br>  Who did the subs for Boo Kai, and are they doing them for Super?<br>Boo Kai's were more or less perfect.</br>  <br><br>I always wondered if Toei just asks Toriyama for permission and do whatever the fuck they want.</br></br>  <br><br>Little kids like Bart Simpson characters with Goten playing second banana, so unfortunately we're stuck with it.</br></br>  <br>FILLER</br>  <br> tfw we will never get super saiyan grill </br>  <br>Give it some time. Nozawa is definitely the best Goku. Gohan is a problem, but I don't really like the current dub Gohan much, either. I miss Swaile.</br>  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/productio<wbr>n/toriyama/</wbr></br>  <br>Let's just say the world would be a much simpler place if the western fanbase wasn't so autistically anal about the Dragon Ball "canon".</br>  <br>Show us one then.</br>  <br><br>No getting past the CG, at this point. It's easier to make than whipping Koreans in a slave cave, wasting ink and paper.</br></br>  <br> Anti CGI faggots being stupid as hell <br>Nothing new here.</br></br>  <br>Why the heck toei ask toriyama permission it is reversewise. Toriyama is one of TOEI's servant.</br>  At least we get some loli Mai.  <br>THat shit is THICK</br>  This better be a PV mistake  <br>If it was developed like Dragon Quest.</br>    <br>If only the whole DBS looked like that. Slim lines look lazy.</br>  <br>Now this is nice.<br><br>I don't like that Trunks is pretty much getting her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This, For crying out loud.<br><br>Here's hoping Super gets popular enough to make an actual post-epilogue arc after Universe 6 ends with Teen Goten/Trunks/Marron and loli Pan/Bra and shota Uub get to do something.<br><br>Even shit like Naruto has a movie (supposedly) centered on the new generation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn you're gay</br>  <br><br>Frieza's new design looks so awful. He was far more sinister looking in his previous form. The new one doesn't look remotely unsettling or intimidating.</br></br>  <br>Good opinion.</br>  <br><br>What's with the thick lines now?<br><br>Not that I'm complaining, of course.<br><br><br><br>What do you mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It gives us some nice underage romance, and it balances out the gayness that is Trunks and Goten.</br>  <br>Good opinion.</br>  <br> Krillin <br> Gohan <br>What went so wrong...</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she'll be a good influence on him and make him less of a shit.</br>  <br><br>I feel the opposite way.</br></br>   Universe 6  <br> Saiyans aren't extinct <br> Dude that doesn't look like goku is called Prince kakarot <br> New villain. </br></br></br>  <br>Dragon Ball is officially ruined. Who do we blame? Toriyama? The 11s? Toei? I feel like some Brazilian team should have continued the story. We would have been to SSJ7 (and beyond) by now.</br>  <br>Even his voice is annoying in Japanese and all the dubs I've watched, holy shit.<br><br><br>Tori-bot focused on the art/character design now that he's old and Horii being the writer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is depressing. I get Toriyama is getting old and doesn't have the stamina to keep drawing like he used to, but doesn't stop me for just wishing they didn't push DB further than it needed to go.</br>  <br> We would have been to SSJ7 (and beyond) by now </br>  Why is Broly such a dumb fucking useless character?  <br>I feel like Dragon Ball should have just fucking ended in 1995, with some cool stuff like Neko Majin Z appearing every now and then, you know?</br>  <br> for some reason <br>it was for the ritual dude did u even watch</br></br>  Am I the only one that noticed this? Literally like one second between screen caps.  <br>Toriyama is the only one capable of understanding his characters, so there's nothing wrong with him returning. <br>Are you one of those mad because Gohan became exactly what he wanted since childhood?<br> DB was made by Toriyama and was a borefest <br>Oh, so this was just bait?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there characters more worthless and boring in Dragonball then Trunks and Goten?</br>  <br>T O E I<br>O<br>E<br>I</br></br></br></br>  <br>every thread?<br><br>really?<br><br>we get it, toei suck dicks at basically fucking everything<br><br>stop pointing it out already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to toei? welcome to toei.</br>  <br><br>So far is 10x times better than the shit fans were pushing with him and Pan before BoG.<br><br>Toramai gaining a following since that movie felt refreshing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What am I supposed to be looking at.</br>  <br>I noticed it too<br>Must be Uncle Piccolo covering up her body, trying to keep Gohan pure.</br></br>  <br>fuck we need more suit goku he looken like a pimp</br>  <br>Gohan always looks retarded.<br><br>But the girls are QUALITY.</br></br></br>  <br>Videl's sexy legs</br>  <br>How do you break through something 5 times when only going through it once?</br>  <br>Wasn't Gokuu's wedding off-screen too?</br>  <br>Broly is bad ass, i bought his figure</br>    <br> Literally cattering to stockings and bare legs fans at the same time <br> considered bad <br><br>Toei is good.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YEl<wbr>QOLJO6rY</wbr>  [ ]  <br>There was a couple of filler episodes for it.</br>  <br>Oh.  I think bare legs suit her better though. </br>  <br>For what it's worth, it was shown in the last episode of Dragon Ball  This was filler, though </br>  <br>Videl with stockings&gt;Bare leg Videl<br>Fight me.</br></br>  <br> there are people saying the latest movies got a good animation. </br>  <br> those episode <br> the hot springs scene <br> tfw we never got to see naked Chi-Chi <br><br>DBS better deliver.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want a post epilogue arc so badly.</br></br>  <br>That's an undeniable fact.</br>  So which universes are the other 3 timelines from the Cell saga?  How do you feel about Gohan's high school life and the Ginyu Force being among the episodes with the highest ratings in Z?  <br><br>Good.<br><br>Because the SoL/cooldown episodes are usually entretaining and the goofiness has always been part in Dragon Ball.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigga name one moment we didn't see Videl's bare legs in Z. She's a free spirit like that.<br><br><br>You'll have to make do with pic related.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The spats just evolved.</br>  <br>Short hair Videl&gt;Pigtails Videl&gt;Bob Videl<br>Fact</br></br>  <br> Short hair Videl <br><br>Just no.<br><br>Fuck you, Spopovich.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uub is now non canon until he gets brought up again. Til then he doesn't exist.</br></br>  <br>I agree entirely with this.</br>  <br>It's like OP and the feast chapters/episodes at the end of each arc.</br>  <br> Using a still image to argue something has bad animation <br>You're retard.</br></br>  <br>You are indeed my nigga</br>  <br>Sure you do, samefag.</br>  <br> You're retard. </br>  <br>Do you work for Toei or something? please stop defending this shit.</br>  <br>I think its more because kids like different shit these days. The new designs match the character designs from jump series a lot more now.</br>  <br>Not even samefag, but okay.</br>  Just finished the second movie. It was cool but Frieza's kind of a joke now and Bills can turn him into his bitch whenever he wants, so when will he join Goku and friends?  Why is Komari best girl?  She's a mature lady.    Womanlets, when will they learn?  <br>Best body.</br>  <br>Because she's loved by the bestest girl</br>  That's a weird way to spell Natsumi  <br>Because she's pure minded.<br>Also, the full OP is out. It's so good.</br></br>  renge is objectively best  Best.  <br>SHIN<br>KAN<br>SEN</br></br></br>  All the Mosaics are good  Stay funky.  <br> All the Mosaics are good </br>    So why the new timeline?  <br><br> new timeline </br></br>  Hey, don't bully Koma-chan.  Suguru is best girl  <br>They're all dead, this is purgatory.</br>  <br>She is pure minded because she has non-functional ovaries. She has no libido.</br>  <br>Koma-chan is built for bullying.</br>    <br>What's that?</br>  <br>Did you watch Higurashi? It's like that. We have to solve the mystery. Hotaru is Rika.</br>  <br>Because she's so  bullyable .</br>  <br>I thought that was Kirino Kousaka for a second.</br>  <br>ew</br>  <br>This nigga has the taste here.</br>  <br>Because of her VA</br>  <br>Because she's tiny and cute.</br>  <br>Wouldn't Hotaru be k1 instead?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128261085 <br>It's okay she's a middle schooler, or highschooler. One of the two. <br>Either way, it's okay.</br></br>  <br/>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128261085 <br>if they are both girls its ok!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128261085 <br>She is pretty rapeable.</br>  <br>It's okay if it's guy and girl too</br>  <br>Come to think of it, you're right.</br>  <br> molesting your senpai <br><br>Not okay</br></br></br>  <br>Look at her, she totally wants it.</br>  <br> Also, the full OP is out <br>Where?</br></br>  <br><br>MP3: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13189<br><br>FLAC: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13188</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br>    <br>Thanks.</br>  I want a Komari plushy    <br> that first pic <br>did... did someone die?</br></br>    <br><br>That's apparently the "normal" cover for the album</br></br>  <br><br>Why are shirts with English on them so moe?</br></br>  <br>  every episode of Repeat takes place prior to the Okinawa trip <br> last episode is them in the airport again <br> Renge asks Nee-nee what happens if the plane crashes <br> "That won't happen, Renge. Don't worry." <br> Season 3 is more prequel episodes </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god I want this</br>    <br>The Biyoris died in a flood or tornado or some storm shit. Non Non Biyori literally means "No No weather"<br><br>Everyone in the small community probably fled to their school because it's the highest point to escape the water, which is why their memory of the school is it being broken down and "leaking water" when it's never raining.<br><br>Koma, Nattsun, Renge, Nee-Nee and Onii-chan probably all died in that classroom, while Hotarun was somewhere else, most likely rescued and hospitalized, but died a couple days later due to complications, which is why she has a late start in NNB<br><br>The whole show is them in purgatory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weird choice on SilverLink's part. The new episodes are using "scenes" from the more recent parts of the manga but the prequel aspect of it is anime original.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hell, shit like this always makes me watch anime a lot different, like the child prostitution shit in Spirited Away.</br></br>  <br>Why does Komari look pregnant?</br>  <br> That little bump <br>Every fucking time</br></br>  I feel like, of all the girls, Komari would grow up to be the most beautiful. The other girls might beat her in puberty, and they might even grow up to be taller than her or bustier than her, but I feel like there is a pure beauty forming through Komari. <br><br>Without a doubt, she'll be the most attractive when they're all adults.</br></br>  <br> Biyoris getting older ever </br>  <br>I want them all</br>  This is a fake city girl.  Why does it feel like they are introducing a brand new character at the start of this season even though she isn't?  Why is everyone convinced the Non Nons are dead?   People making BBN more morbid than it is <br><br>How much country grown weed have you people have consuming?<br><br><br><br> For fun, after all Renge is actually Kazuho's daughter </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one retarded post at noon on a saturday <br> everyone </br></br>  <br>But she's not a village girl either, she's been tainted by the city. She is used goods now and blemishes other pure non-nons just by her filthy presence.</br>  Caring and the most cutest, Not even a dark night will stop her from saving Hotaru.  <br>People say they're dead in almost every NNB thread.</br>  <br>Meh</br>  <br>OP this time is pretty good, even if it is nano.ripe</br>  <br>Thanks pal</br>  <br>It isn't a new timeline. Where did you get that idea?</br>  <br>It's that one retard every time.<br><br><br>It is good because it's nano.ripe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We may never know.</br>  <br>Except it is, there are clues everywhere. Compare the school hallway and the buckets with those shown in season 1.</br>  I hope the next episode isn't a prequel too, I want to see Candy Store.  <br>I don't know. it'll take a lot more to convince me</br>  <br> It is good because it's nano.ripe. </br>  <br><br>2nd best after Gu.</br></br>  <br>Seeing this machine not filled to the brim with Komari is somehow depressing.</br>  <br>It also explains shit like the candy store always somehow being open, yet no-one visits the shop. Candystore also died in the storm, the shop long abandoned, so only other people who died in the storm, ie the girls, are able to visit the spiritual candy store that Candystore is running. Plus it is even mentioned in one of the episodes that all the stuff in the shop is from 10 years ago, as if it is frozen in time.<br><br>It's all beginning to make sense now.</br></br></br>  <br> Non Non Biyori literally means "No No weather" <br>No it doesn't. The title is most likely just a cutesy combination of the words のんびり and びより.</br></br>    <br><br>pls no</br></br>  <br>Adds a whole new layer to Natsumi wondering about ghosts and the afterlife.</br>  <br>Fucking hell I could have done without hearing that</br>  Onii-chan doesn't speak because when he was killed in the storm his vocal chords were destroyed after he was thrown into a tree branch which pierced his throat.  renge cries when she sees nii-chan because he molested her before they died  Why can't the threads be as healing as the show?  <br>Because /a/ is masochistic.</br>  Paint all black, black like that time.  <br/>   muh sekrit dark seid theories <br><br>Fuck off back to youtube you teenagers.</br></br>  <br> getting butthurt over shitposts </br>  <br><br>It's not their fault when Renge keeps singing those morbid songs  and I can't get this out of my head now, thanks /a/ <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zKl<wbr>9hp7LOvM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll hurt your butt with posting shit, faggot</br>  It's not like NNB was produced by Gainax, so we're safe from any dark secret twists, right<br><br>r-right?</br></br>  <br><br>But we are not safe from any dark secret twists by the mangaka since Renge singing all those morbid songs might be a reflection on his/her traumatic past</br></br>  <br>We're fine.</br>  <br> his/her <br>is this some new ebin meme I haven't heard about</br></br>  <br><br>I'm legitimately unsure if Atto is male/female</br></br>  Reminder that Hotaru is the best girl  Non Non Biyori Repeat went back in time to the beginning of the first season because of the promise of the adventure of boarding an air plane; the ending of NNB was that Bane crashed that plane with no survivors.<br><br>The sleeping eldritch power of Ren-chon awoke in that moment of trauma. Ren-chon unleashed the aweful nightmarish power of the Abyss to erase it all. <br><br>Space-time was distorted by the Golden Chaos and it reality was warped backwards to the day before Ren-chon entered the first grade.<br><br>In the back of her insane mind Ren-chon remembers it all. She paints her memory black. Gotta forget...gotta forget...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's Gakkou Gurashi for that you know.</br></br>  <br>The only dark twist is the undercurrent of failing rural areas and empty schools.<br><br>It's a little sad, but compared to the alternative, it's a million miles better.</br></br></br>  <br>best girl for impregnation</br>  <br><br>I'd hope she can survive child birth unlike Koma-chan</br></br>  She's very compact. Compact is good, they don't have a lot of space in Japan  I don't think 2 girls should hold hands or interlock fingers  <br> storm <br> fleeing to the highest point <br><br>?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not following you in a flood situation.</br>  <br>where exactly would they be flooded from? The river?</br>  <br>tsunami. fukishima got hit with a big one a few years back</br>  She's so small and cute you just want to cuddle her until you get tired.<br><br>Which is never.</br></br>  <br>they're pretty far away from the ocean though, in a village surrounded by mountains on top of that.</br>  <br>Haruhi was still not satisfied with the summer vacation and the world has imploded unto itself. Now a new reborn god Renge is upset with her own vacation.</br>  New art, they are so cute  <br>Komari looks so small.</br>  Full size,  is a peasant.  <br>They all look Renge's age.</br>  <br> womanlets <br>The smaller the girl is, the superior she is naturally and biologically speaking.<br> inb4 my manwoman landwhale pride </br></br></br>  <br>maybe we will have festival episode this season</br>  <br><br>Too many wholes in the reasoning but being in purgatory makes sense</br></br>  <br> Too many wholes <br>I agree. it needs more halves</br></br>  <br> this theory is full of holes, but I believe it anyways  <br><br>So this is the power of idiocy.</br></br></br>  <br>Ever since meguka, we've had tons of these faggots acting like everything is edgy grimdark shit.</br>  <br>I hate the fucking Lesbo</br>  <br>She's only gay for Komari.</br>    <br>fucking WHY?</br>  <br><br><br>He probably wants to kidnap the Koma-chan instead</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because she's annoying and overly-familiar. <br><br><br>How did you know?</br></br></br></br></br>  Would you?  <br>Yeah, I'd steal all of them.</br>  Non Non Biyori?<br><br>More like NON NON ITBORESME AMIRITE?</br></br>  <br>Kuma-chan!</br>    Consider how /fa/ Hotarun is, is she really eleven?  <br>I thought she was 12.</br>   12 years old   <br>It's not that hard to believe.</br>  <br><br>Well, Renge is 6 going into 7 and she's in first grade (after episode 10), so Hotaru is most likely 10 going into 11</br></br>  This show made me understand why the Japanese government works so hard to prop up traditional small scale farming. It's not remotely competitive with industrial farming on a pure price basis, but these little villages are so comfy compared to the vast, unpopulated fields of American and Canadian mechanized farms.  <br><br><br>Not exactly the most appropriate swimsuit for a ten/eleven/twelve-year-old</br></br></br>  <br>She drank her milk for sure.</br>  <br>The real reason she moved to the country is her dad got transferred to the ass end of nowhere for using the company's puberty enhancing drug on his daughter.</br>  <br>Because you're exhibiting the primary sign of pedophilia.</br>   Liking midgets     <br><br>Isn't that fucking kids?</br></br>  <br><br> Not wanting to tease midgets </br></br>  Best girl hasn't shown up in S2 yet.  <br>enough she's shit</br>    i want to sex hotarun so hard  <br>No, Koma-chan will only get less attractive from how she is now. She's ripe for picking.</br>  <br>Because she is the purest girl ever.</br>  <br>there is a game where you can wake her up and gang rape her</br>  <br>Did it get updated? Because the gangrape button only gives dialogue last time I checked.</br>  <br>shit <br><br>i don't know i don't play that shit lol</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't an eleven year old.</br>  Because she vaguely resembles Kirino.  I HAVE 0 CLUE WHAT THE TIMELINE IS SUPPOSED TO BE<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT<br><br>WHY THE FUCK IS IT BEFORE <br><br>WHAT DOES REPEAT EVEN MEAN</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all caps autistic rage </br>  <br>kyon-kun denwa</br>  TOMORROW  Going by the previous two episodes, the next one should fit in between episode 2 and 3 in the timeline, covering events after visiting CandyStore and before rice planting.<br><br>I wonder what they can do then? Cherry blossom viewing/festival maybe?</br></br>  <br><br> Cherry blossom viewing <br><br>Technically they did that in the very first episode of season 1 already</br></br></br></br>  <br>'Nam flashback episode</br>  <br>can you not?</br>  <br>NOT. HAHAHA.</br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about</br>  <br><br>THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF WAY OUT OF HERE</br></br>  <br><br>/a/ please.</br></br>  <br>Is she a 24 year old virgin?</br>   Not obvious best girl   <br>she was tied to a tree and gang raped. when the flood waters came, she couldn't escape the ropes in time, and drowned. so, no she's not a virgin</br>  <br><br>you fucking faggots are ruining this anime with your shitty ass nonsensical crackpot theories, like that faggot trying to convince everyone that they're dead<br><br>go the fuck back to /pol/ jesus fucking christ</br></br></br></br>    <br>What about her eyes?</br>  <br>pic related</br>  <br>Yo I'd fuck this kid</br>  <br>The only thing here that is shitty and nonsensical is your post.</br>    Stew! Stew! Stew!  <br>Is someone butthurt?</br>  <br> Why is Komari best girl? <br><br>Because she represents all that is good and pure about being a growing child. You yearn to see the world in a more adult manner while stuck in a point in your life where you feel held back by your age and everything you've yet to know. <br><br>When you're older, and these days are over, all you'll ever want to do is go back to not knowing. Go back to how it felt to be on the cusp of something greater than what you have now. <br><br>I love you, Komari.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My heart can't take this.</br>  <br> getting mad over shitposts <br>lol</br></br>  <br>her ears are growning</br>  Will we ever see what happened in Okinawa? Maybe as another OVA?  <br> maybe as another OVA? <br><br>W-wait, There's a NNB OVA?</br></br></br>  <br>It's basically episode 13 of season 1. It only ever came bundled as part of the 7th volume of the manga.<br><br>http://myanimelist.net/anime/21667/<wbr>Non_Non_Biyori:_Okinawa_e_Ikukoto_n<wbr>i_Natta<br><br>Just search Non Non Biyori OVA on nyaa.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit I can't believe i missed that</br>  <br>I didn't even know about it until about an hour ago.</br>  Most intense fight this season thus far.  Where did this ebin "the girls are all dead and Renge fought in Vietnam" meme come from?  <br>watching it now<br><br>Why is Onii-san so based</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's a Bro.</br>    <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>Well played.</br>  <br>nice<br><br> dat doujin <br>brb</br></br></br></br>    <br>There was a doujin about Hotaru drawn by Pony R, but it never got scanned. It's a shame, since Hotaru looked nice and meaty.</br>  I want to fuck Komari HARD  <br>Because at one point Renge sings a song to herself with the lyrics "paint it all black"<br><br>you should be able to infer the rest</br></br></br>  20 year old Hotaru when?  <br>eto..... i'm here, anon</br>  <br>Tried to find a good approximation of an older Hotaru. This is the best I found.</br>  <br>Not what?</br>  I want to have carnal relations with this girl.  <br> KEITAI </br>  <br>Your meme is broken, all I hear is 新幹線</br>  <br>Does she have a boyfriend in Tokyo?</br>  <br>She has Roppongi.</br>  I'd show her my shinkansen, if you know what I mean.  <br> I do not sadly </br>  cunny  <br>Out.</br>  <br>Perfect. <br><br><br>Me neither.</br></br></br></br>  What are the chances of more Komari yuri doujins now that we have a second season?  <br>Great, now I'm imagining Sirzechs Lucifer hanging out in Vietnam singing Sympathy for the Devil while a bunch of Phenexes play in the napalm fires.</br>  <br>I assume the Secret Flowers guy will provide.</br>  Kaede when?  <br>Why would the government care about that?</br>  Well, I assumed anon was using the image of a shinkansen as a metaphor for his penis, but then maybe realized that speed wasn't the stat he wanted to aim for there. A big train is still good though I think.

I wish they would go to cripplechan or somewhere else.</br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  If your favorite anime character can't pass this test then it is shit. Try to guess each others.  <br><br>He's kind of a loner, but for some reason quite popular with women. He's got kind of a shitty personality in some ways. He's crass, shameless, and not particularly smart. Relationship with his family isn't straightforward.<br><br>He does like wordplay, and it feels like he spends like 90% of his time just hanging out and having ridiculous conversations with his friends. He can be pretty funny.<br><br>People forgive him for a lot of his bullshit because he's genuinely good hearted and selfless.<br><br>His taste in cars is pure shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  "kill em dead!"  <br>rararagi?</br>  he fucked youre mum and he's sitting in my chair in front of my computer right at this instant  Sword autism  <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Looks like RRRG passes.</br></br></br></br>  Tomato  <br>arararrararararra-gi<br><br>he has a catchphrase <br>he can seem ignorant and disinterested of his family and people around him, but he actually deeply cares about them<br>he's a silent person<br>he travels with his gang in rather exotic countries<br> EXTRA <br>a fat, ,dirty,ugly and old cunt with a broken VHS player<br>also does reviews sometimes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he has a silver soul</br>  A gardening tool is her weapon of choice.  <br>He's completely chunni, having a taste for norse mythology, secret organizations and conspiracies. He often makes up things and phrases that mean absolutely nothing, creating in-jokes that only he understands.<br><br>He talks to himself often, mostly to make himself feel cool. He pretends to be an ass sometimes, but is actually pretty kind-hearted and empathetic.</br></br></br>  He's an arrogant jackass who was raised by an arrogant, thieving, drunkard jackass. He has no real friends, only potential romantic interests, rivals, and potential death threats. This includes his own mother. He sucks at school, but is a world-class genius in his one narrow area of specialty. He has an ability to stick his foot so far in his mouth he can taste his kneecap, which manifests at the worst of times. He's willing to kill to save people he cares about.<br><br>Oh, and he turns into a girl when you splash cold water on him.</br></br>  He legitimately cares about other's problems, and will go to extreme lengths to solve them -- even if his solutions come at a cost to his job, image or personal well-being. Doesn't care what anyone thinks and will do what he wants to do and say what he wants to say, even when what he wants to say is vulgar. The truth hurts and he knows it, but says it anyway.<br><br>Really smart but doesn't seem like it to others, exceeds when he tries hard enough.</br></br>  <br>He's manly, he kicks logic out, a rebel to the anyone who stands in his way.</br>  <br><br>Toshino Kyoko.</br></br>  <br> Oh, and he turns into a girl when you splash cold water on him. <br> breaking one of the only OP rules </br></br>  <br>Jotaro.</br>  A chainsmoker with a mysterious past who likes to travel and has impeccable fashion sense.  <br> wrong </br>  <br>Also speaks authoritatively from a wide and deep knowledge base, but often the people he meets are unwilling to take his advice.</br>    <br>Too easy</br>  <br><br>Ginko?</br></br>  Shit.  <br>Currently running show?</br>  He wants to save everyone and that at the end of the day people go home smiling without having lost anything  He lives for thrill and is the best at what he does, is mysterious and demon like. He find no value in material good and money. He values staying himself above everything, even his own life.  <br>yes<br><br>8man<br><br>4 one of main four people gakkou gurashi<br><br>you're waifu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Next review when?</br>  <br>Episode VII is my guess</br>  <br>Hououin Kyouma.<br><br>Sounds like a huge faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>No, what I said applies to him pretty much as well though.<br><br>I'll add something to narrow it down. He smokes, often.</br></br></br>    <br>RLM is shit.</br>  He's the demons.    <br>She's the kindest most pure girl there is. She always does her best for her friends. She carries a heavy burden. Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker</br>  <br>Elsie.<br><br>I sure hope you're not describing Biribiri.</br></br></br>  <br>Elsie</br>  Being more intelligent than his peers make him bored of school, he has a strong and controversial sense of what's right and wrong and is not afraid to say what's on his mind.<br><br>He often comes up with plans that are convoluted and trick anyone trying to defeat him.</br></br>  <br>Biriri carries a heavy burden?<br>No</br></br>  <br>He's a human. Definitely a human.</br>  <br> Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker <br>again, breaking the rules</br></br>    She often comes off as the clown of the group.<br>A glutton with a lighthearted facade, but shoulders great responsibilities.<br>She might not look like it, but she excels at almost anything she does, perhaps not out of choice but because circumstances forced her to.<br>Also ghosts scare her shitless.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou</br>  <br>Correct<br><br>How?</br></br></br>  <br><br> She's the kindest most pure girl there is <br><br>Generic as shit<br><br> She always does her best for her friends <br><br>This like 99% of anime characters <br><br> She carries a heavy burden <br><br>Lots of characters do, or there would be no dramatic conflict <br><br> Her best friend is considered a crazy lesbian stalker <br><br>This isn't even about her<br><br>OP was correct, based on this thread most anime characters have absolutely no personality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's too obvious and defeats the purpose. It's like me describing Hei from DtB as "his sister died in an accident". It gives too much away, so just stick to describing the traits of the character.</br>  She's cute.<br>Fuck.</br>  <br> His taste in cars is pure shit. </br>  <br>He's extremely weak and helpless to a point where he hates himself for it.<br>He can still admit these faults to himself and others who are close to him.<br>He actively tries to better himself and do his best to not be a burden.<br>He's incredibly nice, yet almost seems of unaware of just how nice he is.<br><br>Well I did a lot better than I thought I would.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guts?</br></br>  <br> Summerfags don't know this <br><br>Male, teen, socially retarded, honest, brave, protective, not perverted, conservative, skilled, takes extreme measures even if it is not appropriate, slightly masochistic<br><br>Female, teen, pure maiden, violent, tsundere, superficial tendencies, enjoys bossing people around and maintaining social order, wears her heart on her sleeve, has feelings for above male,<br><br>hint:  only summerfags need spoonfeeding </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She's a proud childish goddess forgotten by the people that used to praise her. She's also extremely intelligent and is scared of being alone forever because of her immortality.  <br>Onii-sama?</br>  <br>She seems sort of laidback and nonchalant, if a little cold, and gives no fucks about trivial stuff. In reality, she's actually batshit crazy, probably more afraid of human connection than the fucking NGEs, and only seems casual because she's made a conscious effort to divorce herself from normal concerns in order to not allow herself to be overwhelmed by petty bullshit. Because of this, she doesn't know how to deal with anything except by ignoring it, and if she can no longer ignore it, she can't cope at all and flies off the deep end. Manga, not anime.</br>  <br>Wrong. The female is also easily scared by supernatural things, the male does not believe in such things.</br>  <br> goddess <br>That's a role/profession</br></br>  <br>Or maybe people are shit at describing personalities.</br>  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br>She's a proud childish immortal forgotten by the people that used to praise her. She's also extremely intelligent and is scared of being alone forever because of her immortality.<br>Happy?</br></br>  <br>that girl who is almost deaf mute?</br>  Manga: he is obsessed with social standing and snell. most perceive him as the lowest of the low, and he acknowledges it himself  <br>The one girl with the glasses from Haruhi?</br>  <br>Kyon and Haruhi?</br>  <br>Intelligent, nihilistic with a wicked sense of humor.</br>  She's very talented at what she does, but she's a bit of a slacker. <br><br>She's extremely affectionate with her friends even to the point of making some of them uncomfortable.<br><br>She loves to relax and take it easy to the point that she can be a bit of a slob.<br><br>People think she's stupid, but that's mostly because she just says the first thing that comes to mind without caring. She can be competent if she tries.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody praises her.<br>ex mode: she really likes apples.</br></br>  <br> shirou and rin? </br>  <br>He who crawls in skin.</br>  <br>Yui</br>  Why do most of these vaguely sound like descriptions of otaku in general?  <br>nope. He is physically fit, excellent fortitude and constitution. He is very goal driven, and will never abandon a task, even if it means death. If you gave him the choice of a bow or a sword, he would always choose the ranged option.</br>  <br>Anon-kun</br>  While he seems aloof, he never turns down those who need help, a true altruist who doesn't cares about himself. Has an extremely strong sense of justice, but that justice is his own, never tries to preach or change people's minds about their own beliefs. Has shown that talents are not things you are born with, but are things you earn with hard work and determination. Has a group of close friends that share his ideals and sense of justice.<br><br>Enjoys cleaning parks.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>This is what I was gonna write, so Yui Hirasawa.</br>  He steals the show, figuratively and literally.  <br><br>Because lots of anime characters are designed to be relatable to inadequates.</br></br>  <br>Aquarion Logos or Kuusen Madoushi though neither strike me as msochistic.</br>  He's a whiny kid who thinks he's more mature than he is.  <br>What, Shouko? No. She wasn't cold at all. Hell, Ueno'd probably be closer.</br>  <br>Kiririto for the male and Asuna for the female?</br>  <br>nope. He was born in 1984, has at least three aliases.</br>  He never wins. Ever. No matter how effortlessly he beats down his opponents, in the end he still loses  <br> While he seems aloof, he never turns down those who need help, a true altruist who doesn't cares about himself. Has an extremely strong sense of justice, but that justice is his own, <br>Why does this sound like every other description in this thread</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Scumbag Loser MC</br>  He gets left behind by people leaving to do amazing secret stuff, nobody wants anything out of him, until years later they do, and he's so starved for validation that he ends up happily obeying the people who threw him away like trash.  <br>Kumagawa</br>  He strives to lose neither to rain, wind, snow nor the heat of summer. To have a strong body, unfettered by desire nor moved by anger. Never praised and always ignored.  <br> summerfags don't know this currently airing show <br>I'm not even him, but that's definitely not it.</br></br>  <br>His nationality is not entirely japanese, i.e. mixed race. Any more and it will be spoonfeeding.</br>  the one who exploits from the bottom of the dogpile.<br>the person who goes against all odds by themself.<br>the one who was betrayed and doesnt show any mercy.</br></br>  <br>alright, that was easy mode</br>  <br>Yeah I realized after I posted that, somehow is made me think it would be something airing.</br>  <br>You could be more specific</br>  She is outwardly sweet and kind beyond comparison, but suffers from a number of mental issues and traumas that result in her being very sadistic at time, but also incredibly self-loathing. Despite her traumas and emotional baggage she usually puts on a strong face and smiles through the suffering. She can be very possessive at times and can be quick to jealousy.  <br>Horo.</br>  <br>Gintoki<br><br>Loud; full of energy; has lofty ambitions that she doesn't really put a lot of effort into pursuing, though she's happy to force her friends into doing things along with her; gets jealous and petty rather easily and doesn't like it when other people spend more time with her friends than she does; loves sweets, being lazy, and pushing responsibilities onto others; huge prankster, loves cracking jokes at the expense of her friends; fairly talented, though with some obvious flaws in her performance that everyone picks up on; sometimes childish and directionless, but slowly learning to be more of an adult because of the influence of her friends.</br></br></br>  <br>elfen lied</br>  He has the  Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu   <br><br><br><br><br><br>All these summerfags. Are you going full panic yet?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lain?</br>  <br>Ueki</br>  He claims he only wants to live a normal life, whereas he actually prefers his unnormal life. He likes to comment current situations in a snarky way.  As he says, he is an autistic child  <br>as always, Madara just can't be beaten</br>  The Strongest.<br><br><br>Kyon.</br></br></br>    <br>That kind of sounds like almost every genki girl ever.</br>  <br>Rinne Tensei Madara Uchiha</br>  eh? nandatte?  <br>FMP</br>  <br>boku no pico no newfag no summer OVA?</br>  <br>Shokugeki no Souma?</br>  She is a lesbian born into a fairly challenging job field that boils down to committing fraud. Outgoing, helpful, friendly, and resourcefulness are some of her best traits. These traits lead her to befriend some interesting people who will likely become heavily involved in her future career path.<br><br><br>Accelerator</br></br></br>  She's in a perpetual state of being happy and carefree. She's also capable of closing her eyes when being cyber bullied.  <br>Well, you're definitely not talking about edo tensei uchiha madara</br>  <br>Yes. This thread makes me sad.</br>  What is the new season even about?<br><br>Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free?<br><br>what the fuck is going on</br></br></br></br>  who cares, its the same edgy as fuck villains that wanna destroy the planet for no reason every season im tired of this shit.  <br> What is the new season even about? <br>Idols vs Vocaloids</br></br>  <br> Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free? <br>Three months passed.</br></br>  Everything is explained in the first two episodes.<br>Did you even pay attention?</br>  <br> Watching Symphogear for the overarching plot <br>You're doing it wrong.</br></br>  I still can't bring myself to watch the second episode.<br><br>It can't possibly be as good as the opening scene, so I think I'd rather not watch it and instead live with a platonic idea of what could've been instead.</br></br>  <br>Them chrises.</br>  <br>How about you watch the show?<br><br><br>You have serious issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love thoses Zembus.</br>  <br><br>The new season is about beef stroganoff.</br></br>  <br>But you'll be missing out on Chris and Tsubasa transformations and songs.</br>    I think I forgot to take my pills.<br>Or was it because I took pills?<br>Either way I'm not sure what just happened to my brain.<br>Something, something, pills stroganoff.</br></br></br>  Chris is so petite, why are her breasts so dis-proportionally huge?  <br>Shortstack, maybe.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, you'll also miss </br></br>  <br> oppai loli </br>  <br>At least Ver was an actual villain. The new bitch just wants to kill everything because she has daddy issues and will be redeemed at the end of the season regardless of how many atrocities she committed.</br>  <br><br>All the girls are really short.<br>Even Maria, who's the tallest is only 170cm.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but.</br>  How many more concubines will Hibiki acquire for her harem this season?  <br>New villain just looks like she has daddy issues that will be resolved when Hibiki hugs her or whatever. Although I suspect the dolls will overthrow Carol.</br>  <br>Watch it nigga. Second episode is just as good and the third one has a wondrously surreal song about beeg stroganoff.</br>  <br>Gaijin genes</br>  <br>Hibiki:<br> We're all humans and we all want to protect ourselves from the Noise, instead of fighting each other we should talk things out because we can understand each other. <br>Tsubasa:<br> I'm a sword who shouldn't feel emotions and my only value is how well I can kill the enemy. <br>Chris:<br> In order to end war you should stomp the will to fight out of anybody who wants to fight.  <br>Maria:<br> The ends justify the means <br>Kirika:<br> I don't want to disappear forever, and if I have to then I want to leave behind a world that remembers who I am. <br>Shirabe:<br> Wanting to help people for selfless reasons is hypocritical. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So far the villains this season really piss me off. At least FIS did not kill dozens of people in the first two episodes.</br>  <br>FIS confirmed superior hero squad.</br>  <br>I want SoL of the FIS girls and Maria being a loving onee-chan.</br>  <br> Maria: <br> The ends justify the means <br>She clearly didn't think that way else she wouldn't have been so hesitant at everyhing she did in G.</br></br></br>  <br> Then that's bad writing. She's a person with thoughts and feelings, not a drooling retarded who doesn't have a semblance of common sense, empathy or ability to learn. That's just a shit character. <br>Well, when a person does stupid things and it never has negative consequences they tend to think they are doing things right. Which is what Hibiki is going through right now.</br></br>  <br>Seems generally pretty accurate. No complaints here. <br><br>However Kirika's isn't a bad thing, and Maria's isn't either, the ends to justify the means sometimes when the 'end' is literally the fate of the world. It just so happens that she was in a bad position and didn't have much luck in her draws.<br><br>In fact, all of these ideals have weaknesses and strengths so I wouldn't say that any of them got 'proved' wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa: <br> &gt;I'm a sword who shouldn't feel emotions and my only value is how well I can kill the enemy. <br><br>No wonder I can't stand her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In S1 her pacifism is treated as a personality trait and nothing more, it never becomes a point of conflict for her. Chris words never made Hibiki falter like Shirabe's did. She never questioned her own pacifist ideals, even if at the time she was less radical about them and would still be willing to fist a girl or two.<br><br>S1 was all about Hibiki finding a reason why she fights. S2 has Hibiki finding a conflict in her ideals. S3 will be Hibiki being forced to deal with this conflict.</br></br></br>  Genjuro should just take Gungnir away from Hibiki. Carrying it around without being able to use it endangers her and everyone around her.  <br> OP starts thread with best girl <br>Sweet.</br></br>  <br>That's the ideal that she tried to adopt, and it didn't go well.<br><br>It was the way that they went about it that was retarded, Kirika was willing to stick with a homicidal maniac to the bitter end and so was Maria. It turns out that when you openly associate yourself with terrorists then people are gonna not want to listen to what you have to say.</br></br></br>  Pls stop. Just accept the fact that G skipped important parts of Bikkie's character and delivered asspulled manly girl without any developement. GX is here to fix this shit and deal with her problems.  <br> &gt;It was the way that they went about it that was retarded, Kirika was willing to stick with a homicidal maniac to the bitter end and so was Maria. It turns out that when you openly associate yourself with terrorists then people are gonna not want to listen to what you have to say. <br>Yes, but honestly in their positions they didn't see any other alternative, and they did learn and improve their stances later on. Biki is probably the most inflexible.</br></br>  <br> Maria makes smart and level headed decisions while saving people without her gear <br> Tries talking sense into Hibiki <br> Kirika saves Chris at the cost of hurting herself <br> DMJii team fights and escapes in the smartest and most efficient way possible  <br> Hibiki has an existential crisis because she nicked her finger on a knife <br>Someone punch her in the stomach. Please.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> S1 was all about Hibiki finding a reason why she fights. S2 has Hibiki finding a conflict in her ideals. S3 will be Hibiki being forced to deal with this conflict. <br>Why S2 feels so incomplete?<br>In this last discussions it always appear to be the one that fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point I'm making, Hibiki is the only who who has never had to seriously reconsider her ideals and improve them. Now it's finally her turn.</br>  <br> when a person does stupid things and it never has negative consequences <br>You mean outside of the hundreds of civilians who have died in the process?</br></br>  <br>I think everybody agrees G was a mess in terms of writing. I don't think it fucked everything though. I still found it extremely enjoyable and the plot in GX seems promising despite the setbacks in G.</br>  <br> &gt;That's the point I'm making, Hibiki is the only who who has never had to seriously reconsider her ideals and improve them. Now it's finally her turn. <br>Oh, you said something like 'she was the only one that wasn't proved wrong'<br>which to me implies that everyone else's ideal Was wrong and hibiki's was right - or at least not debunked as of yet.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br>128308818<br>There's already a way.</br></br></br>   Maria watching Tsubasa intently to make sure she doesn't try to yuusha herself off the plane   <br><br>The problem is that she just waltzed on through everything without any real consequences up until now because her friends picked up the slack or the finales were a string of super asspulls. She's had no consequences because of a contrived series of events and now in the final season the main character is just now starting to be treated like a real person and not a cardboard cutout that spouts one liners about wanting to help people.</br></br>  <br> Maria wants to flirt in their private jet but Tsubasa is too preoccupied with SAKIMORI to notice </br>  <br>The way they were going about their ideals was wrong though; Tsubasa had turned herself into an emotionless machine, Chris was trying to stop war using Noise which only made people angrier, and FIS associated themselves with a lunatic who shockingly turned out to not have the world's best interests at heart.<br><br>After getting their development they found a way to modify their ideals for the better. Hibiki never had to do that. Nobody is arguing that what Hibiki is doing is smart, but the same is obviously going to happen for Hibiki, but you can't make a beef stroganoff without breaking a few Symphobird eggs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Should have actually quoted that properly.</br></br>  <br> You mean outside of the hundreds of civilians who have died in the process? <br>Did Hibiki ever realized she could have stopped it early on?<br>No, she just turn a blind eye to everything happening as something she could nothing about.<br>Now everything is happening in her face for she to realize how stupid she has been, let's wait and see if it has an actual importance or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Tsubasa had turned herself into an emotionless machine <br>Tsubasa was cold but certainly not merciless, especially when Hibiki was acting the way she was.<br><br>But yeah hopefully biki finally owns up to her shit otherwise i'm just going to pretend she doesn't exist and focus on all the other infinitely superior characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But do those ideals still hold right now?<br>Tsubasa softened up a lot, Chris as well, Maria saw that this doesn't work and probably has changed it, Shirabe might have changed her view as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't say nothing bad happened and then follow up with "Except the things that she ignored."<br><br>That's bad writing. Someone obsessed with saving people should have enough empathy that it doesn't take someone being murdered in front of them to elicit a response or drive to do something.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>*Emotionless not merciless</br></br></br>  <br>This. Biki should fist first and ask questions later.</br>  <br>S1 has Hibiki being more interesting as a character. The fault lies mostly in G which started out suggesting Hibiki would have to come to grips with her hypocrisy and ended with the person who questioned her in the first place saying 'you might be a hypocrite but I think you're still doing the right thing' leaving Hibiki exactly where she was when everything began. <br><br>Personally, I don't think it's that bad though. G just works sort of like a bridge between S1 Hibiki and GX Hibiki. G got Hibiki's lack of self confidence going and it only reached its apex in GX.</br></br></br>   Our beloved character whose heart is filled with many worries: of course it's none other than Tachibana Hibiki! Once again this season has our hero trying to save everyone, and because of her disdain for fighting she continues to suffer. Before she can overcome that fear, she clashes with a new problem. This problem is tied to Hibiki's essence; what makes Hibiki Hibiki. Her problem will contrast this season's enemy Carol, so please be sure to pay attention. <br><br> yfw we're going to have muh ideals and muh daddy issues at the same time </br></br>  <br>I think that Tsubasa sees herself as a human wielding a sword rather than a sword itself, and that although she's been given power it's okay to think of herself sometimes.<br><br>Chris also realized that she can use her power to help others and to stomp out threats, rather than stomp out people.<br><br>We aren't completely sure what Maria and Shirabe have learned but they've definitely learned something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She better just accept that her dad is a piece of trash.</br>  Is everyone else enjoying hibiki's alternate universe character?  <br>More like she already has a dad who's a million times better than her biological dad will ever be.</br>  <br>Please no.</br>  I think Tsubasa's character arc this time might be about choosing whether she wants to fully dedicate herself to being a Sakimori or a singer. And whichever side she chooses, we lose.  <br>Yes. Greatly so.</br>  <br> That's bad writing. Someone obsessed with saving people should have enough empathy that it doesn't take someone being murdered in front of them to elicit a response or drive to do something. <br>Says who? You?<br>Human beings are all different.<br>The most stubborn ones tend to ignore everything that makes them think they are wrong.<br>See /a/ as an example, you don't think you are wrong no matter what kind of evidence is provided, and who knows if I'm not the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there's much of a conflict here. She should try to balance both.</br>  <br>Not him but I don't see how his argument is wrong. Someone who cares about others shouldn't need to think so long and hard about helping others when they have the power to do so.</br>  <br>I can't wait</br>  <br>Someone should really destroy the moon.</br>  <br>Fine pls<br>Noone cares that God is your oneitis</br></br>  <br>And what I said is that she is stubborn enough to ignore the facts that say she is wrong.</br>  <br>Treating one third of the story like a bridge and not a proper segment of the work as a whole is pretty bad.<br><br><br> Read the magazine article <br> Be depressed <br>I'd forgotten about that until this week. Fuck you for reminding me.<br><br><br>This bothers me.<br> I have daddy issues <br> My dad didn't leave me anything  <br>Meanwhile, Genjuro adopts her, trains her, entrusts her with protecting humanity and adopts any girl she chooses to befriend. Honestly the way she treats Genjuro and Miku after all they do for her bothers me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When does Hibiki refuse to use her power to save people then? Even in episode 3 she still tried to save Miku and her classmates.</br>  MadokaxSymphogear crossover when?  <br>What if you want help others so badly you want to help your enemy too?</br>  <br> I don't think there's much of a conflict here <br>That talk with the English producer kind of suggests otherwise though.</br></br>  <br>The fight with fine and the her confrontation with carol. Carol obviously needed to be apprehended, she's too dangerous to leave at large.</br>    <br> Says who? You? <br>Common sense and logic? Did you even read the post or were you just in a hurry to disagree with it to defend the writing? This isn't even a case "you want them to be too logical", it's a case of the characters being defined by X trait except when X trait would actually necessitate some change or introspection. It's incredibly weak writing.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is fucking dense, news at 11.<br>She probably doesn't understand yet that a person doesn't have to be related to you by blood to be your dad.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki never did that though. And no, trying to talk before trying to fight doesn't count as not using her powers. She was just trying to see if she could solve the problem without fighting first.</br>  <br>If she wanted to help Carol she'd fucking transform.</br>  <br> &gt;Hibiki never did that though. And no, trying to talk before trying to fight doesn't count as not using her powers. She was just trying to see if she could solve the problem without fighting first. <br>She didn't even put on her gear. She was asking to die. That counts to me as not using her power when she should.</br></br>  <br>Why are anime girls always so white? All have yogurt skin</br>  <br>Don't make me flip your hat Carol</br>  <br>Chris is 5 feet tall with a B90/W57/H85 body. She's short stack as fuck.</br>  <br> Hibiki is fucking dense <br>There has to be a limit. She runs around preaching that everyone should talk and try to understand each other to solve their problems, then when Miku begs and cries for her to open up and actually lean on her, Hibiki just brushes it off and then bottles it up and collapses later on. It's like they took every ideal and value she had then used them all to contradict one another while slowly mixing in daddy and self worth issues until she barely resembles a person anymore. At this point she does nothing but spout ideals then break down and cry when someone even comes close to opposing her ideas. Hell, a fucking knife almost broke her down in school.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why I'm arguing with you. I agree that the writing in Symphogear is sub par. I just don't think it hurts the show too much to have this simplistic writing where things happen according to the convenience of the writer. I can't take anybody seriously when they tell me they watch Symphogear for the plot, so I have no place trying to defend that plot.</br>  <br> Man I wish I could crash this plane right now  with no survivors  and make a cool entrance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138   <br>I didn't even realize we were arguing. And I have no problem with a simplistic or straightforward plot. My issue here is that it bites off a little more and tries to touch on some more complicated themes present in Kaneko's other works (what it means to be a hero, cooperation, opening up to people) and then manages to pull them off well for every character then completely drop the ball when it tries to develop the main character.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br> not the side character of manga and anime <br>LONDON</br></br>  <br> no survivors <br>Ogawa could easily land on the water, carrying both of them on his shoulders.</br></br>  <br>There is just something I love so much about oversized witch hats.</br>  <br>You are saying it is bad because she doesn't act the way you want.<br>She is a stupid and stubborn person that will never acknowledged she is doing something wrong unless you make her see it against her will.</br></br>  <br>you forgot to add Mai-HiME in there too</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <br>She tried to put on her gear and it didn't work. That counts to me as not having any power to use at all.</br>  <br> That counts to me as not using her power when she should. <br>That's you personal interpretation then.<br>Remember Carol criticized Hibiki's behavior of saving the world first. If Carol really wanted Hibiki to fight her she should shut her mouth and not cry in the first place. Her plan all went wrong from the very start.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Remember Carol criticized Hibiki's behavior of saving the world first. If Carol really wanted Hibiki to fight her she should shut her mouth and not cry in the first place. Her plan all went wrong from the very start. <br>You don't even know what her plan is yet, how can you say whether or not it is wrong? Also, she had the chance to do whatever she wanted to do with hibiki, she simply chose to leave her be. She could have done anything.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she was exactly planning on being seen crying. She also expected that anyone with half a brain would try and defend themselves when they come under attack. Her only mistake is assuming that Hibiki wouldn't be fucking suicidal.</br>  <br> Get to the point where you can't even pretend to make a real point or form a constructive thought <br> "Well you're just mad because everyone isn't behaving as you want them to." <br>You can fuck right off. You're not even pretending to address what's going on in the show anymore, you're just throwing a bitchfit because you got called an idiot and don't know how else to respond.</br></br></br>    <br><br>So they picked up the idea as well.</br></br>  <br>KANADE AND VER ARE BACK</br>  <br>You don't read past the fist line of a post or what?<br>You haven't respond with arguments, and, just for you to know,telling someone to fuck off isn't an argument.</br></br>  Episode 3 was lower-quality animation-wise and filled with flashbacks because they had to pay Nana a ton of money to put her drawing on the screen.  <br>I think at least her plan of fighting Hibiki had already been ruined by her own hands since episode 1. <br><br><br>Then her another mistake is she knows nothing about Hibiki's personality.<br>Even Garie knew how to handle Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't think Hibiki's situation is bad writting. She's supposed to be insane.  <br> Implying Nana isn't already funding this show. </br>  <br>She probably told Garie to do it. <br> Go drain some people and also antagonize that idiot girl into fighting. </br></br>  <br>This feels good on my penis.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>PLEASE BE IN LONDON</br>  <br>Given that you can't put a sentence together and don't know how commas work I can tell English isn't your forte, but I presented a completely logical and sound argument. How about you go back and read it again then try addressing what I said instead of throwing a tantrum?</br>  <br>It was worth the price.</br>  <br>She did. How to handle it depends on Garie though.</br>  <br>So Hibiki will get her shit together just to find out that her using a Symphogear was part of Carol's plan? I kinda like this idea.</br>  <br><br><br><br>More importantly, the moth noise is there, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These threads are so fucking bad where did all these retards that can't follow basic plot progression come from.</br></br>  <br>It's literally one post, stop trying to stir up shit</br>  <br>That is a formidable counterargument, I'll admit. A great rebuttal, if you will.</br>  <br>She probably wants to break all of their relics and force them into enough of a corner that they're willing to use Dainsleif. There's no way she didn't intend for Elfnein to give it to them.</br>  <br> her using a Symphogear was part of Carol's plan? <br>Isn't it very obviously after episode 3? Even Genjuro thought it's strange.</br></br>    <br>Maybe she saw Hibiki fix Durandal and figures she can do the same with Dainsleif.</br>  <br>God she's so fucking hot I want her to dom me</br>  I really just want to see Carol turning Bikkie into her dark beast mode servant to fulfill her evil overlord schemes.  <br>Bikkie didn't fixed shit. She activated it. You can't activate fragment without making it into gear or space cancer.</br>  <br>What exactly is this?</br>  <br>I really just want to stick my dick in Carol</br>  <br>Fanart  I hope </br>  <br>I want to rub my dick into her hair and armpits and loli thighs and cum inside her braid. She's a villain, so it's okay to do bad, morally reprehensible things to her right?</br>  Why is the opening not the song that played in episode 1?  TODOROKE  G-BEAT  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>RON<br>DON<br>IF ANIME DIES WE RIOT</br></br></br>  <br>Why was the G opening not the song that played in its first episode?</br>  <br>As do I. Bringing Kanade back as an antagonist just to kill her off again would be a gigantic middle finger from the writers, and somehow 'purifying' her or making her good again and having her rejoin the team would be utter bullshit and horrible writing  even if she is my favorite Gear .</br>  <br>What do you think she's so angry about?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>L O N D O N !<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N<br>!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> even if she is my favorite Gear. <br>Is this a meme now or is it just one guy who feels the need to say this in spoilers several times a thread? It's getting very annoying already.</br></br>  <br>Now I think of it, they only broke Tsubasa and Chris' pendants/converters. The relics in converters are still fine.</br>  <br>They're being played like fiddles by Carol.</br>  Who else loves upgrades. No matter how old I get I still get excited when the good guys upgrade their gear.  <br>Maybe they'll realize it, or at least figure out that they shouldn't just immediately accept help from Elfnein.</br>  <br>Elfnein hasn't really offered them any help, just a fragment of a relic they have no idea how to use.</br>  <br>She was building a weapon for Carol, she's probably got some kind of relevant knowledge installed in her. She'd have to if Carol sent her to them on purpose.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>this I can get behind<br>LONDON!<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe her mission is to NTR Hibiki</br>  <br>Me too.<br>But I think they will just fix the converters. The gear design won't be changed until they use X drive mode.</br></br>  Okay, seriously, where are the lossless rips of Biki's songs? It's been four days. For fuck's sake, the lossless rips for Exterminate are out and that single isn't even supposed to be out for three more days.  <br> not Chris </br>  <br>Because onee san doesn't want to play with her and her dolls, she told her that they could hold a mature and philosophical talk instead.</br>  <br>Her goal was to destroy everything Hibiki holds dear. Her relationship is obviously one of the most important things to her. Just killing Miku wouldn't be enough for Carol.<br> I'm sorry Hibiki, but I've found someone else <br>Would be much more damaging.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're already pretty suspicious of Elfnein with the brainwashing tests they did and all, I don't think they'll just blindly use the Dainsleif like that. They'll probably be put into a corner and forced to fight with the Dainsleif at some point  like episode 7 .</br>  <br>It's on  BUY THE CD </br>  <br>They'll get some upgrade that allows them to fight the new noise and the dolls. They're not even being subtle about it.</br>  <br> episode 7 <br>Nana pretty likes her name, doesn't she?</br></br>  What if Hibiki's dad has found a new wife and is now living happily with his new family?  <br><br><br> braids <br> small body <br> bare legs <br> arm stockings whatever the fuck those are called <br> those shoes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Hibiki to get dragged down so low that she thinks the only way she can be useful is to jam the shard of Dainsleif into her chest.</br>  <br> arm stockings <br>Gloves you faggot</br></br>  <br>Really? I figured they'd have a special name like everything regarding clothing.</br>  Alright, I've been avoiding Symphogear and its threads for 3 episodes. For the people that loved the first season but hated the second one, how is it so far? Does it live up to its hype, or should I just don't bother and save myself from another season of disappointment?  <br> They'll probably be put into a corner and forced to fight with the Dainsleif at some point   like episode 7 .<br> Genjuro wields it because Hibiki is too scared to do anything <br> Trades his life force to be able to fight with a relic <br> Die taking out 90% of the enemy forces and revealing their weakness <br>It might go down like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been better than G so far, the villains are better and every girl is better except for Hibiki.<br><br>The threads have been cancerous as fuck though.</br></br></br>  <br>Action sequences are super hype, people are shitposting now because Hibiki's finally getting meaningful development.</br>  <br>Hibiki went full retarded even worse than Ver and it's not even fun.<br>First and second episodes were great though..</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128313138 <br>LONDON</br>  <br>Long story short, it's much better.</br>  <br>Well, I really don't care about the threads, but for it to be better than G isn't that hard. Excluding the fight scenes, how would you rate it so far? How's the character development and plot?</br>  <br>Except Hibiki's final character development argument, everything is well done currently.</br>  <br>FIS is much better.<br>Chris-chan cute<br>Tsubasa is dere again<br>Hibiki's going through a rough spot and is currently useless but she's definitely going to get over it soon.<br>New villains are 10/10, everyone wants to bully Carol-chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>G was looking great for the first three episodes too. Things only went bananas later.</br>  <br>I want Carol to bully Hibiki</br>  <br> everyone wants to bully Carol-chan <br> You guys really like to bully cute loli.</br></br>  <br> Discussing the show is shitposting <br> People are at the fact that she's getting development, not how it's handled <br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>All, the character development that was sidelined in G is now on the frontstage. Hence the name, GX.</br>  <br>Carol please, I'm sure your father would get really heated if he learned you were browsing 18+ imageboards.</br>  <br>I want to bully Carol  with my dick  for making Hibiki so depressed.</br>  <br>I want to bully her with my cock</br>  A lot of conflicting posts so far. Guess I'll wait for episode 4 and see what's everyone's reaction is before I commit then. I'm not sure if I can handle another season of G again.  <br>Nobody can talk about character development 3 episodes in, but the build up has been pretty good.<br>Hibiki issues will finally be addressed, Maria seems a lot more serious and likable than in G and DMJii is going to develop nicely if they continue how they are.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you buddy</br>  <br> A lot of conflicting posts so far. <br>What? No they're not. <br> Opening was hype as fuck <br> New villains are looking good <br> All the girls got better <br> Hibiki currently has her head in her ass, how long it's stuck up her ass will determine how the season goes <br>How hard is that to understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only real conflict is about Hibiki, people are massively disagreeing over how her development is being handled.<br><br>Everybody else is universally agreed to be better and Episode 1 somehow managed to top G's Episode 1.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Carol is 400 years old now?</br>  <br>ZUN pls</br>  When is the opening single being released?  <br>It takes one hour to watch the three episodes. It's not going to hurt you or anything, no matter how bad it turns out to be.</br>  <br> Episode 1 somehow managed to top <br>They were surfing on missiles that Chris shot and Hibiki suplexed a rocket. After that, Tsubasa and Maria became barefoot jesus idols in London. There's no mystery as to how it managed to top G.</br></br>  <br>It's already leaked.</br>  <br>Let me put it this way, they managed to take the FIS Trio, who sucked all the fun out of G and turn them into likable characters.<br><br>That alone should convince you that GX is worth picking up.</br></br></br>  <br>It's already out.</br>  <br>I don't remember the date but you can find it on the official GX site. It doesn't matter though cause .</br>  <br>I mean people had no idea how they could possibly top G's first episode and were worried that it couldn't live up to the hype.<br><br>I don't think anybody would've predicted suplexing rockets and blowing up K2</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the slicing of forest and the second biggest mountain being reduced to the third place.</br>  <br>Just watch the first 7 minutes of episode 1 then judge it by yourself.</br>  <br><br>And yet there's still no FLAC for G-Beat and Little Miracle.</br></br>  <br>I meant conflicting for Hibiki's development, which was great in season 1 but crap in season 2. Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear.<br><br><br>Making FIS likable wasn't hard. Outside of their respective 'subplots' and the needless drama, they had all the makings of a good character.<br><br><br><br>I did that for season 2. It still hurts, anon. I stuck with the rest of the season hoping it redeems itself. It never did and had retroactively ruined the franchise for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So guys, what are your favorite attacks/attack cards?  <br> FLAC <br>For what fucking purpose?</br></br>  The duet was so fucking disappointing compared the the one last season.  <br> Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear. <br>Really? I love her when she's fighting and being hot blooded because Aoi Yuuki is a Goddess and pile bunker martial arts make my dick hard, but as far as actual personalities go she's easily my least favorite of the main three.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki was the main reason why I loved Symphogear. <br>Watch the first 7 minutes of episode 1 right now.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, you have shit taste.</br>  <br>Pic related and Megadeth Symphony<br>Also all of Kanade's cards were cool, she had the best card art</br></br>  <br>Heaven's wrath.</br>  <br>Some of us have nice headphones.<br><br><br>I feel bad for Seiten Galaxy Cross. It's not a bad song at all, in fact it's very good, but Fushichou no Flamme was just phenomenal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was worse, but it's not like it's bad, still a great song.</br>  <br> headphones <br>You're killing me.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, people are not in accordance as to what they think of the way they're setting up Hibiki's character in GX. You'll have to see for yourself if you want to make your own mind. I can at least tell you that they're indicating that they're going to go somewhere with her and not just sort of ignore her issues and pretend everything was fine and dandy in the end like G, I just can't guarantee you you'll like it.</br>  <br> Some of us have nice headphones <br><br>Did you miss the part where FLAC is only really worth it for archival purposes. If you can afford such nice headphones to actually be able to spot the difference between FLAC and the mp3 rips I'm sure you can drop the $20 to import the CD yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Just said it doesn't top Fushidori then.</br>  Hey, I have an idea, what if it was Gungnir that gave Hibiki her over the top fighting spirit, and since now it's gone, the psychological effects wore off?  <br>Not him but Hibiki is a miracle of the universe and has always been the greatest thing about Symphogear in general for me. Personality wise and hot-blooded hero wise.</br>    <br>Despite looking awesome, Furinkazan has failed to actually beat anything she hit with it.</br>  Does anyone have that synchrogazer track that has that awesome build up to it, it's played in this scene.  <br> Fushidori </br>  <br> Personality wise <br>I feel the opposite. The way she runs around yelping about her ideals, breaking down when someone tells her "let's hold hands and be friends" isn't the answer to everything, and then doesn't practice what she preaches by ignoring Genuro as a father figure and never really opening up to Miku who wants to help her makes me dislike her "civilian" personality.</br></br>  Fushichou might have arguably been the better song but Galaxy Cross defintely had the best concert scene.  <br>Level 2 version</br>  <br>She the only one of the main 3 with any conflict so , no big surprise they're focusing on her personal issues.</br>  <br>To each their own, I guess. All of the three heroines got great development in season 1. Some had highest peaks than her, but on average, her personality was very likable and coherently development throughout the episodes. Unlike season 2.<br><br><br>I'll hold off until episode 4. I got suckered in by episode 1 from season 2, so I'm going to be a bit more cautious this time around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only attacks that ever actually work in the end are these.<br><br>Also, post your faces when we get the EXTERMINATE attack card</br></br></br>  <br> She the only one of the main 3 with any conflict </br>  <br>Tsubasa had the coolest attacks in Super Heroine Chronicle.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rPX<wbr>OUPNxhXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Ask and thou shall receive. And in FLAC no less.<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/szibec_Synchrogaze<wbr>rAufwachenForm.flac</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You realize that when I look at her personality as a whole I'm taking into account all of seasons 1 and 2 and what I've seen of season 3, right?</br>  Is it weird if I say that my favorite song right now is  the beef stroganoff song ?  <br>Someone should make a compilation image of all the attack cards, kind of like that thing with biki butts, but more manageable.</br>  <br>No, it just means you have good  taste. </br>  <br>It would be weird if it wasn't.</br>  <br> G-Beat exists <br> Little Miracle Exists <br> Seigi wo Shinjite exists <br><br>Yep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's cute but it's not G Beat.</br>  <br>G- Beef </br>  <br>Fair enough. But I generally discount her 'development' from Season 2, or at least until Season 3 goes and does something with it. If people are still saying her personality is still crap after episode 4, then I'm just going to abandon all hope.</br>  <br> Attack connects right at EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE </br>  <br>I could afford it, yes, but at the same time just because I can doesn't mean I want to. That, and only having a complete set of charasong CDs for G and GX would trigger my autism. I can't seem to find Kanade or Miku's S1 charasongs below ultra-scalped prices anywhere.</br>  <br>What's the name of that phoenix attack she does?</br>    Beyond the blade &gt; G-Beat &gt; Trust Heart   <br>There is one somewhere, although it's incomplete.<br>I thought I had it saved somewhere but I cant' find it right now.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki only looks up to Genuro and doesn't see him as a father figure, and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems. Also, her whole "let's hold hands and be friends" thing work twice with Fine and FIS some no big surprise that she thinks it will work again.</br>  <br>Just watch it for everyone else. Chris, Tsubasa and Genjuro are all still amazing and they even made the FIIS girls awesome this time around.</br>  <br>I was not going to contest anything you said because liking a character is really a matter of preference, but <br><br> and then doesn't practice what she preaches by ignoring Genuro as a father figure <br>What does ignoring Genjuro as a father figure have to do with what Hibiki tries to preach? <br><br>Also, you expect Hibiki to simply forget about her biological father who actually raised until 3 years ago before running away when he couldn't take the pressure simply because Genjuro is a cool and kind master?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soaring Phoenix according to Commie</br>  <br>I will never get tired of this track.</br>  I miss season 1.  <br> and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems <br><br>THIS<br>DOESN'T<br>WORK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki only looks up to Genuro and doesn't see him as a father figure <br> Adopts all the girls <br> Teaches them <br> Protects them <br> Showers them with guidance and unconditional love <br>What do you think a father is?<br><br> and not telling Miku anything is because she doesn't want to burden Miku with her problems <br>She makes a point of telling everyone to get along and solve their problems by talking so they can understand each other, but she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most. That rubs me the wrong way. I'm not a fan of being a hypocritical idiot who hurts their friends under the guise of selflessness. <br><br> Also, her whole "let's hold hands and be friends" thing work twice with Fine and FIS some no big surprise that she thinks it will work again. <br>And during the process of it working hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people died so Hibiki could act out her hero complex and pat herself on the back for saving someone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh? If you really you should at least watch episode 1. She is still our badass heroine at that moment. Also I think you should judge a show by your own opinion. Even Hibiki began to question herself beliefs by her own self now.</br>  Good ol genjuro.  <br>I wonder how many people here were even watching season 1 when it was airing.</br>  <br>The same thing happened in episode 1 of G, anon. All of them seemed great in the beginning. I've already waited 3 episodes, I can wait 1 more. If nothing else happens or they introduce more drama, I can safely walk away and never look back.</br>  <br>This is actually the only reason keeping me from buying them all as well.</br>  <br> What does ignoring Genjuro as a father figure have to do with what Hibiki tries to preach? <br>That bit was more directed at how she treats Miku. The problem with Genjuro is her going on and on about her dad problems and now complains about her dad not entrusting her with anything when her surrogate father is helping her become a hero to humanity.<br><br> Genjuro is a cool and kind master? <br>Yes, because that's the extent of what he's done for the girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are we going to have to wait for the ost for a full version of this?  <br>Because I don't just watch one episode of something. I commit all the way to the end. I did it for G, so if I start GX, I'll probably watch until the final episode, good or bad.</br>  What's Kirika's GX song called?  <br>ですデスＤＥＳＵ</br>  <br>Her flaws are mostly due to her not valuing herself. That has always been Hibiki's thing and it's directly tied to abandonment issues cause by her father and how she was socially ostracized. She just thinks she's worthless and her life would be better used for others and not for herself. Sadly, she inadvertently causes trouble for others doing this even though she has good intentions. <br><br>You find this annoying, I see this and feel like I want to protect her and make her love herself. You hate her personality, I think she's a miracle of the universe. I guess you don't think broken things are moe or perhaps you can't conciliate the ideas of a resolute hero and a broken, fragile little girl in a single character.</br></br></br>  <br> What do you think a father is? <br>You know you use your own perspective to see Genjuro right?<br><br> but she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most. That rubs me the wrong way.  <br>Give her time ok?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you think a father is? <br>Thats not what he is to Hibiki he only guides her and teaches her how to fight that more of a master student relationship.<br><br> she refuses to talk to the person that cares about her most <br>Shocker its easy to fix others problems but your own. Not everyone can talk to those close to them about problems why do you think therapist are useful because its easy to talk to a stranger then to talk to those close to you.<br><br>  thousands of innocent people died so Hibiki could act out her hero complex  <br>What thousand of people? In S1 that was on everyone heads not Hibki's alone and S2 was the same thing but the plot had to go on so everyone look stupid when in most cases they would have stop them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be so rude, all the girls in this show are broken to some extent, I doubt he'd watch Symphogear if that was his opinion.<br><br>He probably just finds Hibikis specific brand of brokenness to be annoying and frankly he's not alone in thinking that.</br></br></br>  <br> desu death desu <br>th-thanks</br></br>  <br>オーバーキルサイズ・ヘル</br>  <br> オーバーキルサイズ・ヘル <br> Overkill size hell <br>Sounds like Kirika alright</br></br></br>  So seeing as how the OP song title is always the name of the final attack. What sort of attack will EXTERMINATE be?  <br>You're expecting way too much of her. People are not usually so strong or rational about dealing with their own emotions as you're expecting Bikki to be. Bikki is clearly scared to death of touching the wound in her heart that was left by the events that took place after the Zwei Wing show.</br>  <br>Nana said EXTERMINATE is the song that will destroy the world.<br><br>So probably them cutting the world in half.</br></br></br>  <br>Just rewatched this episode today. Literally still best episode of all Symphogear series. 11, 12 and 13 of S1 are all beyond epic.</br>  <br>I think broken things stop being moe when they start endangering the lives of people around them.</br>  TL pls.  <br> size <br>I think it's meant to be scythe.</br></br>  <br>Talking with the ennemy so they're bored to death.</br>  <br> I guess you don't think broken things are moe or perhaps you can't conciliate the ideas of a resolute hero and a broken, fragile little girl in a single character. <br>Chris is my waifu, so you're way off base. I just don't like martyr complexes and the inherent selfishness that stems from them. Life is something to be valued, and if you can't see how not valuing your own life hurts people who care about you, you need to pull your head out of your ass. This isn't something new or some novel challenge for her. She's been surrounded by people who care, who tell her they care and she even went out of her way to tell Chris to let everyone into her life when she put walls up between herself and everyone. Chris's apprehensiveness was brought about from having done something truly horrible as a result of a misguided effort to save people that resulted in her killing countless people. By comparison, Hibiki is really just being a bitch about everything.<br><br><br> You know you use your own perspective to see Genjuro right? <br>What did I say about him that wasn't shown directly in the show?<br><br> Give her time ok? <br>This has been a problem for her since like episode 3 of season 1. She's had time.<br><br><br> Thats not what he is to Hibiki he only guides her and teaches her how to fight that more of a master student relationship. <br>That doesn't answer my question at all.<br><br> Shocker its easy to fix others problems but your own. <br>And that makes her a giant hypocrite in the worst way.<br><br> What thousand of people? <br>Did you watch the fucking show? How many innocent people died because Hibiki refused to take action and stop the villains? How many people died between episodes 2 and 3 because she didn't try to stop Carol and Garie?<br><br><br> You're expecting way too much of her. <br>I'm expecting her to act like a human to the people around her after 3 seasons of them being there and unconditionally loving and supporting her. "Bad things happened" isn't an excuse for every action ever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Exterminate is the final attack <br> implying it's not Glorious Break </br></br>  Do you guys still rememeber this?  <br><br>Individual opinions.<br><br>Really, someone should destroy the moon right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, scythe is what it should be.</br></br>  <br>Of course we remember Maria doing the right thing and fighting to protect people.</br>  <br>I'm not going to type out all the words, but Miku asks Biki what happened when they got dispatched the other day because Shiraba and Kirika were hospitalized for an exam. Miku starts asking what kind of 3 person play went down and asking shit like "was it G-Beat play, was it Heart no Zenbu play?" then when Biki tells her to relax she starts singing the Shou Jin Rei summon chant.</br>  <br>That was good. She should have wiped out the team of operators that tried to attack FIS in their hangar too.</br>  <br> What did I say about him that wasn't shown directly in the show? <br>The point is how Bikki thinks about Genjuro, not you.<br><br> This has been a problem for her since like episode 3 of season 1. She's had time. <br>No, she met a new problem now and needs to think it a while by herself. It's not like she won't tell Miku her problem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That shit was out of nowhere.</br>  <br><br>Maria is the only geah user that has killed other humans with her own hands</br></br>  Why is Hibiki such a cunt to Miku  <br>I was. Symphogear will always be in my top 5 series.<br><br>The show has just enough wackiness in it for me to enjoy it a lot, with many interesting characters. Everyone can find a character they like.<br><br> Kirika a best. Especially her new transformation. Deth deth deth deth. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why she's the best.</br>  <br>They were shooting civilians. Hibiki would have let them die.</br>  <br> The point is how Bikki thinks about Genjuro, not you. <br>Ok. What does Hibiki think a father is?<br><br> No, she met a new problem now and needs to think it a while by herself. It's not like she won't tell Miku her problem. <br>What? She never actually confided in Miku and used her for support like Miku wants her to. She's in the same exact spot she was in at the start of season 1.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw one cm shorter than Maria </br>  <br>White Gugnir saves people, dark Gugnir kills them</br>  <br>Will she ever get her gungnir back?<br><br>Also, how the hell did she transform here again? I thought bikki took maria's gungnir?</br></br></br>  <br>Let's not pretend on a technicality that Chris hasn't killed a lot of people. If I throw a hungry lion into a room with a man, I'm still very much the person that killed him.</br>  <br>That's part of why I like her so much. She's not afraid to dirty her hands to protect others, unlike a certain crybaby hypocrite who has currently lost her singing voice.</br>  <br>That isn't Gungnir, that's Airgetlam. Why do you think she used a sword and not a spear?</br>  <br>They were evil Americans so it's okay.</br>  <br>You can't be serious do you not even look at the screen when you watch things?</br>    <br>She's going to take it back from Hibiki and be awesome with it</br>  <br>The white Geah is Airgetlam, the relic formerly used by Serena. X-Drive seemed to override the fact that it was broken through raw Phonic Gain. If you've been watching GX you'd have seen Maria in a similar white Geah with some sort of chain-whip sword in the OP - this is, again, Airgetlam. Maria will most likely never use Gungnir again, though some fans have theorized she might make an entrance and... forcefully borrow Hibiki's Gungnir fragment to save the day in Episode 4.</br>  <br> They were shooting civilians. Hibiki would have let them die. <br>I don't want to admit it, but you're right.</br></br>  <br> Mariafags are actually this delusional </br>  <br> That doesn't answer my question at all. <br>I did give you a answer you choose to ignore it and that's not what he is to her stop thinking every man in a girls life needs to replace her father. <br><br> And that makes her a giant hypocrite in the worst way. <br>And you miss the whole point of what I said most people are like.<br><br> Did you watch the fucking show? <br>Yea, I watch it a better question is did you with your funny interpretation of Hibiki and Genjuro relationship. All those deaths in 2 and 3 where already done before she got there not her fault and even if she did fight we all now she'll end up like her friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Give me a break, it was like a year ago.<br><br><br>So she was holding her relic this entire time? Didn't she comment that her relic had been shattered similar to what happened to tsubasa/chris's gears this episode?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't you heard anon? Maria is the cool and useful one now. She even got SAKIMORI to fall for her.</br>  <br> Ok. What does Hibiki think a father is? <br>How should I know? Unless she tells us her thoughts in the show.<br><br> What? She never actually confided in Miku and used her for support like Miku wants her to. She's in the same exact spot she was in at the start of season 1. <br>This is nonsense. Just because Hibiki hasn't told Miku her problem in episode 3 doesn't mean she won't tell her in later episodes. I really wonder if we watched the same show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not deluding myself into saying it will happen, I just think it would be really cool if it did.</br>  <br>There's no indication that Airgetlahm was unusable at that point. Maria probably never tried to activate it because she had Gungnir.</br>  <br> shattered similar to what happened to tsubasa/chris's </br>  Maria will be the new Kanade. She'll have to bust biki's ass and take the hit for her.  <br>Well Gungnir probably has to get broken somehow for Carol's plans to move forward, and Hibiki obviously can't even do that so it's up to Maria to job with it in her place. Poor Maria.</br>  <br>Hibki would probably block the bullets</br>  <br>I still can't believe the huge hate-boner they had for US and the NSA for this season. I was wondering how they were going to top each new atrocity the US were committing after each episode and they didn't disappoint.</br>  <br>Maria knows not to underestimate them like Tsubasa and Chris did.</br>  <br>Yes. Cracked might be a better way to phrase it but you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Bullshit. She'd probably try and "talk it out" with the trained killers.</br>  <br> I did give you a answer you choose to ignore it and that's not what he is to her stop thinking every man in a girls life needs to replace her father. <br>No you didn't. I asked you what you think a father is and you said something tangentially related. That's not a fucking answer to the question.<br><br> And you miss the whole point of what I said most people are like. <br>And? What does that have to do with how I view Hibiki? Other people being stupid doesn't make it ok to be stupid.<br><br> before she got there not her fault and even if she did fight we all now she'll end up like her friends. <br>What the fuck are you talking about? Learn English before you start posting here. The people she refused to fight and stop went on to kill loads of civilians. Her not stopping the villains so she could befriend them allowed innocent people to die. Hibiki willingly lets innocent people die to fulfill her ideals about saving people because she's too shortsighted to think about anything that isn't directly in front of her.<br><br><br> How should I know? Unless she tells us her thoughts in the show. <br>Then I'm going by what people generally view as fatherly, and that's what Genjuro does for them.<br><br> This is nonsense <br>Are you joking? Name one time Hibiki has actually talked to her or confided in her. Her not opening up to Miku has been a point of contention from the very beginning that was literally never addressed. <br><br> I really wonder if we watched the same show. <br>Clearly not, because you're assuming things that never actually happened are part of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could have sworn at one point in G they showed Airgetlam's pendant and it was all but broken in half.</br>  <br>That was at the end after they overloaded it with the XDrive.<br><br>So it being intact now is a retcon.</br></br></br>  <br> Mariafags are this delusional </br>  <br>I thought relics still work when broken in several pieces? That's how Hibiki's original Gungnir was</br>  <br> Then I'm going by what people generally view as fatherly, and that's what Genjuro does for them. <br>Then that's your opinion, not Hibiki's.<br><br> Are you joking? Name one time Hibiki has actually talked to her or confided in her. Her not opening up to Miku has been a point of contention from the very beginning that was literally never addressed.  <br>I guess you need to rewatch S1E8 and S2E10.<br><br> Clearly not, because you're assuming things that never actually happened are part of the story. <br>And you are judging Hibiki's behavior by episode 3 while there are still 10 episodes to go. Yeah, we are watching a different show by different opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pendant and relic are different objects.</br>  Hey Gears,<br><br>My name is Carol, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are useless, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day trying to make miracles. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever built your own weapons? I mean, I guess it’s fun trying to save people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than watching my dad burning to death.<br><br>Don’t be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I’m pretty much perfect.

And traps are little more than living, breathing onaholes who exist to pleasure men. Alpha men, beta men, tall men, manlets, thin men, fat men, muscular men, men with raging erections who need to be pleased and serviced by small, demure traps who will gleefully slobber their knobs, grinding men's crotches with their tight, tiny butts, and do all they can to milk their dicks with their vacuum-like asses so they can feel their war manjuice inside of them. <br><br>Traps are not people. They are fucktoys for those who can overpower them. Because it's not rape when it's with a trap.

White is more attractive.  Because Japs look ugly as shit.  <br>Did you watch Aku no Hana?</br>  Is it that time again?  They also give anime characters blue/green/purple hair which is not caucasoid or even human for that matter. Perhaps the anime style is a strange amalgamation of aesthetically pleasant traits and it would be foolish to pinpoint some of them to a particular ethnic group while ignoring the others.  <br>this</br>  Japs don't need to stereotype themselves to get the audience to understand that a character is Japanese.  Japs are ugly, whites are not  BUY MY BOOK  <br>There a ton of good looking white and Asian people as much as there are ugly ones.</br>  That is just your point of view. Japs see anime characters as Japanese. <br><br>Either way they're intended to be exaggerated features and you can't point them to a race since no race has eyes that big, noses that small or hair that colour. <br><br>Reddit tier thread, kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  Because japs know they're ugly and have made peace with it.

This happened because unlike every other non-white nation they didn't have the "hurr kill da whytei da whyty bad" mentality, but instead used the approach of learning, and taking inspiration from the european race. This is proof that they are the second best race (Yamato) to whites.<br><br>Therefore they aren't insecure or need to validate themselves aesthetically on anime. They, instead, accept that europeans are more aesthetically and metaphysically pleasing as a race, and find our little characteristics such as red, blond, brown hair and blue, grey, green eyes etc. interesting, and our past artistic background aswell, such in baroque, victorian etc. inspired anime/manga.<br><br>TL;DR: Don't hate and envy those superior to you in whatever area, learn from them, admire them and you will get close to their greatness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>whites don't have eyes that large and noses that small anon, in fact no race or ethnic group does.</br>  <br>why does she look like a shota in a dress?</br>  <br>Are you trying to prove his point?</br>  <br> they aren't insecure or need to validate themselves <br> anime industry is a good representation of Japanese culture </br></br>  <br><br>This. <br><br>'Anime characters are white' is just a perception based on how you view the default person.

Contrariwise, the aryan race does not see the asian race, but the aryan race. Does this imply that black people see themselves? No, because black people are niggers.

Skin colour ranges among Caucasians and Asians are pretty much the same. Asians having smaller eyes is false too. Large eyes are an ideal feature no matter your nationality, same with hair colour that stands out. Blonde and red hair is typically more sought after than black. Although obviously Japanese would be more interested in this because they mostly always have black hair and dying hair is not allowed if you wear a uniform.</br>  <br><br>They look white because they copied disney, and white features are more appealing. To be fair, it looks more like white and asian combined most of the time, with a some made up characteristics too.</br></br>  What is white anyway?

Heres a picture of a typical "moe" style character who's only difference is skin color (and eye color) in return.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;japanese people don't have hair, only white people do! <br><br>Sure that's what I was saying<br><br>Mediocre bait.<br><br> posts fictional anthropoid character that isn't mean as a depiction of a human <br><br>2/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why did you expect a lower lifeforms to form a logical coherent argument?</br></br>  <br>Thats what youre implying, seeing as how the only way your retarded assumption makes any sense is if hair is such a foreign object to Japan that they can only imagine different colored hair with the help of gaijin.</br>  This is the problem with these kids who grew up in murrica watching TV crap full of negro quotas for actors. <br><br>Can't get over the fact that anime is racially homogeneous.</br></br>  <br> I could have said human instead of humanoid <br><br>way to completely prove my point you fucking idiot. the thing you posted is not human, it's a humanoid. characters that are completely human are not drawn with unnatural skin colors, because it's not a standard of beauty.<br><br>you're all ignoring the main point, which is that larger eyes with folds, narrow upturned noses and lighter colors are far more white than they are asian. the intuitive standard of beauty that japs apply to their anime art much more closely resembles white people than asians, or any other race for that matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  western women don't have the round jaw and face that anime girls have, they're definitely more asian than western  <br>I never lose hope, If they can count to ten, there must be a way to get through their goy brainwash, right?<br><br><br>Read again my post and you'll find your answer, I don't feel like repeating myself.<br><br>Meanwhile enjoy this multiracial, multicultural, nigerian inspired, somalian drama, anime picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime girls <br> round jaw and face <br><br>what the fuck anime are you watching</br></br></br></br>    <br>Watchout, he may post a chibi picture to 420 rek u!</br>  <br>They don't look "white", most white girls have pretty bad manface cases.

No offense, but I hope nobody from here has actually paid that much when they could get the same thing here for free.</br></br>  <br>Alright, I godda go to sleep. Like I said I'll post it finished next WWD. Enjoy the rest of your evening!</br>  <br>its a shame that its the anime design.</br>  <br>Eric Andre draws?</br>  <br>Nah, Kuso is fully aware he overcharges. He's mentioned it before, I'd never commission him myself but I'm pretty sure he does it to take advantage of the dA kiddies who DO pay him.</br>  <br>I definitely can see the spirit of Makko Makorin in that.</br>  <br> 90 bucks  <br>Oh shit, I can get two drawings from Simon Adventure for that. Ristybro must have money, he comm. a drawing. Must be nice to have cash.</br></br>  Requesting Sakuya enjoying playing fighting games on an arcade cabinet.  <br>Just wanted to say thanks for this and sorry for the late reply. My love is anyways adorable and the finger puppet concept is creative and cute too! Thanks again and I'm really sorry I'm so late: I was without Internet for the past 24 hours</br>   Sunday's almost over in my timezone <br>Oh well, better luck next weekend<br>Have fun, drawfriends</br></br>  <br> E V O! </br>  <br>Nothing wrong with ripping of dA morons.</br>  <br>That's a little different then, I guess. I just got sort of shocked because I've seen better artists on dA who charge half that. It just seems wrong if he's ripping off waifufags.</br>  <br>Of course, if I could commission, I'd do the same.</br>  Can we make it to thread #7?  <br>Who's your waifu?</br>  <br>I believe he won't take this much if he never had any comissions.</br>  <br> No JWong <br> Most of the Top 8 is Morridoom and Zeros <br>I pray for Apologyman, KBR, and Rayray</br></br></br>  <br> sunday has been over for almost an hour here </br>  <br> Didn't make it to top 8. Always next year. </br>  <br>Yeah, I've commissed quite a few who are much better but I dunno, I think it's different if he's aware. I'm not really defending him, to be honest since it is kinda scummy, but if someone is willing to pay then it doesn't matter. People choose to commission him or not, they aren't forced into it or anything.</br>  <br> I'll be praying for you. </br>  <br>Jolyne</br>  <br><br>Did anon lose to anyone noteworthy?</br></br>  <br> it's Monday for 2 hours already <br><br>welp</br></br></br>  <br> No Wong <br>Fuck, I was out I didn't notice he was knocked out yesterday. Fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>There is a reason why people call him an asshole. It isnt just smoke blowing you know.</br>  <br> I looked at my broken wristwatch, it's actually 1 AM here, I fucked up  </br>  <br><br><br> Friday is already over <br><br>Shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wristwatch <br>People still use those?</br></br>  <br>Nah she's just shit</br>  <br>I keep that one on my desk, it was a gift</br>  <br>I think it's fine.<br><br>Before I stopped being able to draw, I overcharged like fuck on  Gaia  and dA.<br><br>Furries are terrible with money, and it's a good way to make a quick buck if you don't have any self respect</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OR here, thanks so much for drawing my waifu! You've got me curious about that box of ambiguous Stuff (I'll have to ask her about that later...), and I never get tired of Hina's cute butt!<br>Have a great week, anon!</br></br>  <br>Furries are the easiest target, especially if you draw obscure porn.</br>  <br>I'm a newbie drawfag (haven't delivered any waifus yet, still practicing), how would one go about overcharging on dA, for example? Just post a price sheet with examples and hope someone bites? I need cash, tfw poorfag</br>  <br>Basically. Also, having no standards helps. If you are willing to draw two furry toddlers sucking each other off you will make that much more money.</br>  <br>You have to be able to draw anything, even if the prices are high. If you have no boundaries or less than the average and are DECENT you can charge a whole lot. <br><br>Post up on furaffinity and watch the money flow.</br></br></br>  <br>I had the right idea, then<br>Sucks that I'm not living alone, I don't mind drawing fucked up shit like that but I do mind being seen drawing that kind of stuff<br>Also, one more question, how demanding are dA people when it comes to quality? I'm definitely nowhere near being a good artist right now</br></br></br>  <br>Low. Furaffinity and hentaifoundary are lower.<br><br> nowhere near being good <br>How bad?</br></br></br></br>  <br> how demanding are dA people when it comes to quality? </br>  <br>Generally, not that much.<br><br>You will get people that are stupid enough to pay you but want their money back, honestly you can get around that by not offering refunds on completed works.<br><br>Give everyone 2-3 WIP shots so they can't complain with the final.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really comes down to what you are willing to do. If you do the same kind of stuff ANYONE would do, you obviously need to be better to stand out.</br>  <br> How demanding are dA people when it comes to quality? <br>  HAHA  <br>  HAHA  <br>  HAHA  </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't post any examples right now but let's say I'm decent at making lineart, I've got top notch skills when it comes to coloring with flat colors but can't shade or color with anything else<br><br>Also if it's furaffinity, I guess I should learn how to draw fur</br></br></br></br>   tfw last day and she's still not drawn   <br>Keep the faith anon.</br>  <br>I-I gave up for this weekend and am now talking about earning cash with fellow anons<br>Good luck, anon</br></br>  <br>OR here thank you! It's adorable</br>  <br>I haven't felt that in some time<br> how exciting! </br></br>  <br>Ever giving up. You weak fool</br>  <br>Honestly, I know dA has shitty art but I've never seen any commissioned art that isn't good<br>Then again none of the art I saw was weird fetish stuff</br></br>   having hope <br> 2015 <br><br>pls</br></br></br>  <br>not to be rude but have done any progress on coloring the sharkbro drawings?</br>  <br> She's not moe enough to be drawn </br>  <br>it's okay anon, I'm in the same boat too.</br>  <br>It sucks having no one know about her and her series</br>  <br>I'll never give up! ;-;</br>  <br> none since last Monday, no. I still plan on finishing all of them but time was hard to find this week; I'll probably have more progress to show next week.  </br>  <br>Her series isn't that really obscure, she just isn't moe I guess<br> I don't mind though, the less people want to waifu her the happier I am </br></br>  NANAMI IS BEST GIRL, NO CONTEST  Did Akio rape her?  Cow.  yes  Why was Saionji cooking eggs in a forest in the middle of the night?  <br>Anthy &gt; Nanami</br>  <br>anthy is just boring</br>  <br>Not at all. She's the most fascinating person in the series.</br>  <br>But that's Utena.</br>  <br>The forest in the middle of the night is the only appropriate place to cook eggs tbh</br>  <br><br>Can't rape the willing, so Akio never raped anyone. But to answer your question, she's one of the few people in the show who never had sex with him.</br></br>  The best.  <br> Mikki  best girl</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i90<wbr>PApQT6kg</wbr>  [ ]<br>meme demenco best gril tbh</br>    <br>Tsuwabuki...</br>  Was Utena yuri?

Why aren't you modeling your life after him?  <br>But I am a manchild already.</br>  <br>It's cute how wrong you are.</br>  Everything in Adolescence happened inside Utena's head?  <br> kills cats out of jealousy <br>she was the most evil impure cunt</br></br>  <br>Because I don't want to fuck 14 year olds. 3DPD 14 year olds are nothing like their 2D counterparts.</br>  <br>You'd understand if you met my sister.</br>  <br>Cats are overrated.</br>  <br>Shut up, you couldn't even become a prince.</br>  <br>Never got any of the symbolism but people said that the Car scenes where they drove to the end of the world were representing sex or something.<br>Does that mean Akio had sex with all the people that got with him in the car?</br></br>  <br><br>I'd agree with you except she murdered a kitten.<br><br>Honestly I don't really like many of the characters in this show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br><br>I never quite got a full grasp of that symbolism, but he definitely fucked Utena.</br></br>  <br>But if that's the case then why seem people to always get angry at the part where Akio has sex with Utena and not the other people? Because you actually got to see it?</br>  <br>It's the opposite. The car scenes symbolize sex, the sex scenes symbolizes car rides. He just took Utena for a drive on that scene.<br><br>Holy shit, /a/ is fucking dumb.</br></br></br>  ZETTAI <br>UNMEI <br>MOKUSHIROKU</br></br>  <br><br>The car and such represented Adult Power.<br><br>He did fuck a lot of girls though, but no taking them for a ride in the car didn't symbolize sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I though the car symbolized a modern prince.<br>Instead of horses, he uses a nice car</br></br>  <br>Unless it did. In which case he fucked a pair of 13 year old twins.<br><br>Do you want to take that away from Akio?</br></br></br>  <br> kitten killing cunt <br><br>She's shit and the reason I dropped this garbage.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HTF<wbr>XzBeNosE</wbr>  [ ]<br>soshite<br> Tsuki ten  <br> Suisei ten  <br> Kinsei ten <br> Taiyou ten  <br> kasei ten  <br> Mokusei ten <br> Dosei ten  <br> Kousei ten  <br> Gendou ten <br><br> SA   RAN  <br> NA  <br> RUUU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spoilers of the final episode on the video <br>Why.</br></br>  <br>Becausae  everyone apart Shinji and Asuka die in the last episode </br>  <br>Asuka is also dead you fucking pleb.

Poor fucker, I wonder how many pianos he had to burn after his sister got dicked on them.</br></br>  <br>That looks pretty shounen man.</br>  <br>Juri was an uncommunicative, selfish cunt. Worst girl.</br>  <br>I think it was the guy who wanted to date Wakaba.</br>  <br>He was a good boy who didn't belong in Ohtori.</br>  <br>No, he just wasn't exploitable. But that doesn't make him good.</br>  Who came up with the crazy ambient visuals? sure it wasn't Chiho Saito  <br>Wasn't it Kobayashi?</br>  <br>He was the art director, but I think its more probable that he was just putting in practice Ikuhara orders</br>  <br> anthy <br> evil </br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Anthy<br>is this normal?</br></br>    <br>Obligatory</br>  What did the surfing elephants mean?  <br>Youth</br>  <br>How</br>  <br>benis</br>  <br>Best girl indicating where Nanami can place her kiss.</br>  <br> liking nanami <br> mfw </br></br>  <br><br>If you have a love/hate relationship with her you are already on your way.</br></br>  Still pissed that Utena's VA died. Her voice kind of makes me sad now.  <br><br>Solo makes me really miss 90's grunge rock.</br></br>  <br>Since Akio is the only who's old enough to drive, the car rides are meant to symbolize him corrupting the duelists in an adult way.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Jury wasn't in love with Shiori, everything that may have hinted at it was likely just a ruse.</br>  <br><br>Can't tell if bait or dumb.</br></br>  <br><br>You could say the car symbolized one's sex drive.</br></br>  <br>Pretty close to fucking her brother during that one car ride but I don't think she did.</br>  <br>Torch that whore....</br>  <br>She'll be back though, in  ARIA ;_; <br><br><br>Too early for me to rewatch it, I think I watched it the first time like half a year ago.<br><br><br>She was a bitch in the movie too, right?<br><br>Also can someone explain the ending of the series for me?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy asked if she was in love with her. It's the absolute most central point of any of the Jury episodes. Like, even if you ignore all of the symbolism of the show, that fact is shown clear as day. I was giving him a sarcastic response.</br>  <br> end of the series <br>Anthy and Utena kind of switched roles from what I understand. Anthy started out on a quest to save the princess, just as Utena did for Anthy. Akio's still doing the same old same old, just perhaps with a substitute Rose Bride since Anthy's doing her own thing. Utena's MIA.</br></br>  Nanami is the worst part of Utena  <br>It's been analyzed to death and exhaustively explained in countless forums and websites.</br>  <br>Keep in mind I'm going for a rather straightforward explanation.</br>  <br>She was a bitch and a car.</br>  <br>Akio decides to remain in the realm of fantasy (the school) and endlessly repeat past tortures and tragedy. <br><br>Utena disappeared = she grew the fuck up, graduated from the school, and moved on to live in the real world as a true adult foregoing childish things. <br><br>Anthy decided that this was the best thing to do and left the school as well to "find Utena" and live her own life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I won't rewatch until I get some weed.<br><br>Smoke a little pot and the show makes complete sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I sometimes wonder if everyone is dead in Utena and they're in some kinda purgatory.</br></br>  <br>I could see someone interpreting it like that. It's what I wondered at first after Anthy and Akio's pasts are revealed.</br>  <br>Christ, I haven't heard a reference to that Ed Edd and Eddy theory/pasta in forever.<br><br><br>It's one way to look at it. However, to me Akio wasn't really hurting and seemed more indifferent or accepting of his role. I mean, the guy's a chairman with a harem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What went so wrong in your upbringing that allowed such poor taste to surface?</br>  <br>Not everything is some copypasta, moron.</br>  <br><br>The fuck is this?</br></br>  <br><br>Her episodes were dumb and she was an asshole</br></br>  <br>Trying too hard to fit in.</br>  <br>Everything is so surreal that is what I felt it was when I first watched it. Didn't that pink haired filler boss disappear once he accepted reality as well.</br>   You will never turn into a car   <br> One way or another, every character was an asshole. </br>  <br><br>But she was a seriously that way</br></br>  <br>Pretty much. Even the ones who were supposed to be "better than that".</br>  <br>The 1990s equivalent of a butthurt post on /a/</br>    <br>Miki wasn't, not that I remember anyway.</br>  <br>I hope the person who wrote that died of embarrassment when they read it years later. Fucking 90's anime fans.</br>  <br>Now that you mention it, he really was the purest maiden in the whole cast. Why was he even at Ohtori?</br>  <br>The proof that you are a summerfag.</br>  <br> Miki wasn't <br>Oh he was. He treated Anthy like an object and was a purityfag. He was the least asshole-ish dude in the cast though.</br></br>    <br> implying there's anything wrong with being a purityfag <br>The car ride must have decimated him. Shit taste in girls though.</br></br>  <br> implying there's anything wrong with being a purityfag <br>Fuck off Miki<br> Shit taste in girls though. <br>He had great taste in girls. Guys, however... Remember when he fantasized about Touga?</br></br></br></br>  Why was the artstyle so alluring? watching Utena is like candy for the eyes.  <br>Truth be told I don't want to remember.</br>  <br>The movie is so beautiful. I wish Ikuhara would just release movies from now on.</br>  <br>The designs were great, definitely shojo, but very distinct from similar series. It also meshed really well with the different settings and backgrounds, which had a sort of high-class, overly extravagant look to it. Also, because of using the repeated sequences each episode, they were able to save some of the animation budget for the rest of the episodes, so things rarely looked off-model.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think that its one of the most stylistically impressive productions of all the nineties. <br>but I also think that Ikuhara isn't capable anymore of doing anything on that scale. even with talents and funds, his recent stuff has been pretty uninteresting</br></br>  <br><br>Dat architecture.</br></br>  <br>Yeah animation and backgrounds were definitely integral part of the charm. repeated sequences gave everything some sort of ritual vibe to everything, like a ballet or a theatre play</br>  <br>Too bad I lost the drive with the artbook and everything else.</br>  Why did Kozue hold a knife to Miki's throat and call him a traitor in the movie?  <br> But if that's the case then why seem people to always get angry at the part where Akio has sex with Utena and not the other people? <br><br>Because it's a rather uncomfortable scene to watch, despite not really showing anything at all and being entirely consensual (at least, as consensual as a 14 year old losing her virginity to her school's headmaster can be). It's cold, dispassionate, distant. Utena is so disengaged from Akio's ministrations she's muttering to herself about preparing lunches while he's riding her. You can't help but feel something very wrong is happening, which is the general idea.</br></br></br>  <br>That's sexy.<br> Shabadadoo </br></br>  <br>The "consent" in that scene felt rather dubious.</br>   get my friend into watching Utena <br> they don't realize even the most obvious things like Juri being in love with a girl or Touga getting raped by his dad <br><br>How the hell is that even possible</br></br></br>  <br> Remember when he fantasized about Touga? <br>No, please remind me. I used to hold Miki up there with Juri, Nanami, Onion prince and blue haired guy who showed in a single episode then died later as the few redeemable characters in this cast.</br></br>  <br> Touga getting raped by his dad <br>nigger what<br>its been a while, I don't remember this being implied at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Penguindrum had spectacular visual direction actually. Haven't seen YKA yet.</br>  <br>All of the characters were redeemable except Akio and Ruka.<br><br> No, please remind me. <br>I don't remember much but after his sister left the room with the piano he saw Touga in there with his shirt unbuttoned(?) and started to fantasize about him posing on the piano.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant the movie. It's never really mentioned in the tv series.</br>  <br>wasn't it his uncle who raped him?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it was his adoptive father.</br>  So if the eggs were symbolic for Nanami getting her period, then what the fuck was Saionji eating eggs out in the forest supposed to symbolize?  <br> Ruka <br> irredeemable <br>How? He was based as fuck who took worst girl Shiori (how anyone can see her as redeemable, I dont know) down a peg.</br></br></br>  <br>Yoji Enokido, who was part of Be-Papas, stated that the scene in the movie where Touga is raped by his step-father as a child was meant to go into more detail of Touga’s past after being adopted into the Kiryuu family than the anime series got the chance to. In an interview in the "Revolutionary Girl Utena Privacy Files" that were published in a magazine called "Shousetsu June" in 1999, he said the following:<br><br>Although the TV series touched upon Touga’s younger days, the film goes into more details - the wound of Touga that was never directly depicted. In his younger days, Touga was a normal kid who enjoyed happy times with his friend Saionji Kyouichi and his younger sister Nanami. However, he came to know his unfortunate fate from the time he was ordered by his parents to wear his hair long. His parents sold him to the Kiryuu family. Although he was an adopted son on the surface, the instinctive Touga knew what that meant. And in order to protect his younger sister, he accepted his lot. Being sold. We did not go into depicting what Touga’s parents obtained by going as far as selling their son. We would like you to think of it as a kind of metaphor. And Touga accepted in silence the sexual abuse from his new parents. His personality changed while he made a magnanimous show of enjoying the abuses in order to prevent his personality from splitting.<br><br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his recent stuff has been pretty uninteresting <br>I think he did some mistakes, but he can still amend them. Penguindrum had some writing problems and yurikuma had too much visuals over emotions.</br></br>  <br>Oh god anon. I think I'm going to be sick...</br>  <br>The change took place in a spot so deep in his mind, that even those closest to him did not notice. Saionji and Nanami never noticed out of their innocence. And Touga never told his secret to anyone. It is said that a human being gains whatever he lost in exchange. So what did Touga gain in exchange at that point in time? It was the sense of alienation from being abused every night and seeing his innocent friend and sister during the day. The alienated self.<br><br>And it is out of this awareness of alienation that you come to obtain a higher humanity and sexual self-awareness. In the TV series, Saionji always felt that he was one step behind Touga. Although the two are more or less equal in terms of ability, what Saionji lacked was that sense of alienation.<br><br>2/2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a doormat is fascinating. </br>  <br>Ruka's actions were shown in a negative light, I don't know how you could think he was redeemable. Plus he sexually assaulted Juri.<br><br> how anyone can see her as redeemable <br>She's seen mending her relationship with Juri in the end of the last episode and there's official art showing Juri and Shiori from the last episode standing together in their fencing outfits and smiling. Redeemable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need to rewatch this series because I don't remember any of this shit.</br>  Storytime fagotts <br><br>As promised, I finished translating the Mizore and Nozomi sections of volume two. I only translated the dialogue segments though. The descriptions of motion, the rooms and such would've tripled the amount I had to write, so I just summarized the most important parts of it. Also I am not a translator, I am just somebody who likes to read moonrunes, so this is going to be worse than amateurish. If you have any parts that you would like more detail on that I didn't make clear though, just respond to that post and I'll get back to you. Also if you want to say thanks, just respond to the OP, don't quote like ten posts because gets messy.<br><br>Also stated previous, this is just the Mizore and Nozomi segments which I would say covers about 50% of the novel, so this is going to jump around a LOT. There's also some Mizore/Nozomi segments I didn't translate because there's a lot of small scenes of them which I didn't feel like writing in the context.<br><br>I put everything in a pastebin if you just want to read it by yourself<br>http://pastebin.com/9Vwpgzzu<br>it's unedited though so no bully</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hashimoto: That girl, she’s in love with Taki sensei huh? <br>Oh shit</br></br>  <br> Kumiko: You really like Nozomi senpai don’t you? <br> Natsuki smiles without saying anything and they start walking again <br>She's so best.</br></br></br>  <br> I really caused a lot of trouble for Riko and Gotou. Goto in particular is still pissed off about how Riko got hurt <br>h-holy shit that's why Gotou despises Natsuki. Thanks novelanon</br></br>  How can one anon be so based?  <br>natsuki is so best it hurts</br>   tfw no more Sabagebu! Sundays <br><br>It's almost a year now</br></br>  <br>Subs literally never</br>  <br>Not proper subs but anon subs yes.</br>  <br>There are. Unless you mean the anime-koi version.</br>  <br>It was the episode where she gets fat. <br><br>Does anyone remember which one that was? I tried scrubbing through the season 1 episodes but somehow couldn't find it again.</br></br></br>   last service forever   How will 8man resist final form Yukino?<br><br>vol. 11 ch. 9 translation http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br>  At this point, a yukino end in the next volume with no sort of time skip would be a bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui).  <br> bigger asspull than any other girl winning (except for Yui). <br>You mean that, after 11 volumes of nothing but being shit on, things will completely turn around and go as far as a romance in just one volume for Yui, and it won't be an asspull?<br>Yuifags never fail to amaze me.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to work on your reading comprehension.</br>  <br>Why hasn't that hyper fag Hikki tapped this yet? She would let him and there would be no strings attached if he did. If her and 8man did it she wouldn't look too much into it and would be cool about it.</br>  <br>8man knows better than to stick his dick in crazy.</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Just buy it before it raises more</br>  Guys, I need serious advice.
