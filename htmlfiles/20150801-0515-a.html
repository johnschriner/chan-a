Each one had a distinct personality and traits that any hot-blooded male would be attracted to. <br><br>Ami, Rei, Makoto, and Minako reminded me of girls I knew in HS and college. They had their own dreams and aspirations while developing as characters and Senshi.</br></br></br>  <br>I made this thread with the intention of discussing the best way to get new people into the series. Then I got sidetracked and had shit to do for the rest of the day.</br>  <br>My only complaint is that Usagi and Minako are practically twins. Usagi should've had silver hair like Queen Serenity to differentiate herself from Venus (who came first storywise).</br>   Try to torrent classic series <br> Literally no torrents for classic, all crystal <br> Going to have to stream </br></br>      <br>Nice!</br>    <br>You doing it wrong then.</br>  <br>The Chibiusa effect.<br><br>What is meant by "true pantyshots"?</br></br></br>  <br>Actual panties instead of the bottom of the sailor leotard like </br>    We're almost there, /a/<br><br>NEW EPISODE TIME!<br><br>What are your expectations?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I expect to be fucking hyped about the next episode</br>  Preview are OUT <br>It looks like we will get to see all four autoscorers doing something this espisode.

Shouldn't there be a girl from 5ds instead?</br>  <br>Anon...</br>  <br>....you're aware number 4 is aki, right?</br>  In retrospect, the game got better with the addition of Synchro/XYZ didn't it?  <br>much better. every deck now has options and plays, even crappy petdecks, and even crappy decks stand a chance of winning against meta thanks to the toolbox that the extra deck provides.</br>  <br><br>Synchro yes. Xyz is just retarded. Especially rank 4.</br></br>  <br>The range of Rank 4 mostly. There ahould be good R3's and R2's as well, fir variations sake.<br>Nobody has a Rank 2 engine for example, because there's no point.</br></br>  <br> let's give the MC an archetype that can Xyz Summon Ranks 1-8 <br> let's have the MC Xyz Summon only Rank 4 </br></br>  He's back!  <br>Sanji is shit</br>  <br><br>He's a traitorous White Knight Faggot pussy beggar.</br></br>  <br><br> kicks some scrub <br> He's back! </br></br></br>  <br>I think he meant that he finally appeared after a year of being missing</br>  <br><br>Then 'he's back.'</br></br>  <br>oh shit there are devil fruit patterns on his arm</br>  <br>Are you literally autistic?</br>  <br><br>Are you?</br></br>  <br>Geez. <br>The other guys means "the Sanji that wasn't a little bitch is still gone."<br>We know the actual character of Sanji is present in the manga again.</br></br></br>  So who was it Chopper was trying to save this chapter? Law's crew?  <br>what a goddamn retard as if there is a any actual difference between "He's back." and "He's back!". Either way sanji appeared again for who knows how many chapters.</br>  <br>nami's group obviously.</br>  <br><br> as if there is any actual difference between . and ! <br><br>English isn't your first language I see. <br><br><br><br> guys means </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> English isn't your first language I see. <br>There is no difference in the content you autist, both would describe sanji coming back after a year. You're such a fucking nigga</br></br>  <br><br> there is no difference in the content <br><br>Do you know what the difference between an exclamation and a period is?<br><br>Guess nobody did English Lang. in school I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  stop arguing semantics with an autistic imbecile that is throwing a tantrum over a fucking exclamation mark  <br> still trying to damage control <br>As I said there is no difference in the content. Emotions are a completly different matter.</br></br>  <br><br> can't refute the point <br> ad hominem <br><br>Good job with that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The difference is one could imply Sanji coming back is a good thing, it implies enthusiasm and strong feelings.<br><br>The other is more 'Oh, Sanji is back.'<br><br>Nigga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but Chopper gives us this line after they reunite with Nami's group. So they're potentially still chasing after someone.</br>  <br> Kalifa has a key that they need to rescue Robin <br> Sanji refuses to fight her because he is a sexist <br><br>Why do people like this guy again? If Nami didn't defeat Kalifa, he would be responsible for both Nami's as well as Robin's death.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Blame the parents.</br></br>  <br> Emotions are a completly different matter. <br> speaks about the difference of the emotions anyway <br>You literally said what I did you autist ahahahahaha<br>The content stays the same just like your autism.<br><br><br>There is still nothing suggesting that chopper meant someone else instead of nami's group as sanji even saved them after they talked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm a rabid sanji hater but to be fair, he says most of the traitorous shit for show<br><br>When it boils down to serious shit he kicks in to gear like right here and protects his nakama<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cv_<wbr>yExLbaaA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> ahahahahaha <br><br>nigga I agree he's one retarded motherfucker but...</br></br></br>  <br> ... <br>Who is baiting who at this point?</br></br>  <br> sanji allowed Nami vs Califa to happen <br>He also opened those gates.</br></br>  <br> using diable jambe at fodder </br>  <br><br> Diable Mouton Shot on a mook <br><br>He's going to need Okama Kenpo soon, I feel it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty cheap animation. They know that they shouldn't waste their budget on Sanji.</br></br>  <br>His moveset is really cool, he just needs some good fights. Considering that his abilities aren't even boring.</br>   Originally Oda planned on introducing fishmen as far back as Chapter 3. However, due to his editor he held it back, ending up introducing the concept during the Arlong Park Arc instead. <br><br>So how much influence do the editors have? It makes sense to give some tips to a new author that just started, but do they still change some of the stuff Oda wants to do?</br></br>  <br>In chapter 3 they had a lot of influence since one piece was a fledgling manga that could be cancelled at any time.<br>Now they have as much influence as Oda lets them have from respect.</br></br>   mashima spent so many years ripping off of One Piece <br><br> now its Oda's turn to R.I.P Kaidou of off Zeref </br></br>  <br> but do they still change some of the stuff Oda wants to do? <br>100%. They still tell him if they think that a disicion is complete shit. Also Oda (or was it his Editor?) said in an interview that oda only draws his own idea, but rarely takes one two from others. The thing is, we don't know if they meant the assistants, the ditors or  Kishi. </br></br>  Are there still people who think that Kaido ate 100 Zoan DFs?  <br><br>Mixed signals are always nice, aren't they?</br></br>  <br><br>An immortal wanting to off themselves isn't original though - it's not like Zeref is the first.</br></br>  <br>neither excludes the other.</br>  <br><br>He ate them in loads, so he skipped 2.</br></br>  <br>All of the Supernovas are because of the editors wanting something like them there. <br>They probably also pushed for the Law bromance since he's obscenely popular. <br>They probably also pushed Chopper being a cute sidekick other then a more developed character because merch.</br></br></br>  People say it's a shame he didn't have a proper fight since the crew met up again, but Zoro's fights have been complete shit up to now anyway. Not like it's a problem that Sanji didn't get none.<br>Best fight of the crew up to now has to be Franky Vs Senor Pink</br>  <br> Franky Vs Senor Pink <br>It was a horrible fight that only got redeemed at the end thanks to the flashback.</br></br>  <br>big influence.<br> In Sabaody, Oda didn't intend to introduce supernovas at first, but only 3 hours after the editor advised him to make the story more exciting, Oda wrote a new story in which supernovas appeared. <br><br><br>http://www.apforums.net/showthread.<wbr>php?t=29195&amp;page=39</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well after all if it sells, it sells.</br></br>  Post the face you made when Doffy got BTFO  <br><br> Supernovas at Sabaody might not have happened <br><br>Thank you based editor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AP cancer please leave</br>  <br>this is a complete oda style explanation <br><br>10/10 would oda</br></br></br>  <br>Why do they have the best theme for the shittiest strawhat.</br>  <br><br>All the Dressrosa fights were pretty bad. When you cannot focus on something because you only see snippets of it, you lose interest. <br><br>I wonder if we will ever see a fight in OP again that isn't constantly interrupted by other shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They probably also pushed Chopper being a cute sidekick other then a more developed character because merch. <br>That was Toei. Movie 3 was essentially Chopper The Movie.</br></br>  <br>Luffy vs Blackbeard when the time comes, hopefully. Shit will be cash.<br><br> well unlesas we count blackbeard's flashback as an interruption </br></br></br>    <br> they call him sama <br> they all fuck off after Sanji kicked his ass <br> scrub <br><br>Sanji haters are so fucking stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  What if Kaido's powers are like Animal Man from DC? <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima<wbr>l_Man#Powers_and_abilities<br>He can access a morphogenic field that gives him the powers of any animal.. like the strength of a T-Rex or the durability of a cockroach. Basically his body evolves these powers as he needs them and this is why he can't die.</br></wbr></br>  <br> There is still nothing suggesting that chopper meant someone else instead of nami's group as sanji even saved them after they talked. <br>What? This was after Nami and co were saved. Sanji, Nami, Brook, Momo were all in the same place. The people Chopper talked about saving in the beginning of the chapter might've been Nami and co, but Chopper is clearly talking about something else in that panel. There's something else.</br></br>  <br>Vergo vs Law + Smoker and Doffy vs Luffy + Law are the only decent post-ts fights so far. Everything else was subpar as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Are you implying he's not fodder? I like Sanji and all but seriously.</br></br>  <br> when Mr Oda said "Would it be more interesting if bunch of new characters showed up?" <br>It was Oda's idea, he already had the supernovas planned but would have introduced them later, from what is actually said.<br><br>I imagine he respects his editors a lot, they had huge control at the beginning, and his story skyrocketed into success at least somewhat because of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we'll get Luffy's flashback of his mom. For some reason Oda still has this as a mystery.</br>  <br>shame Doffi's fight was somehow worsened (at least to me) by Law's giant room he was keeping up all along. That really bothered me. Also Trebol was useless as shit.</br>  <br><br> Frank vs Senor Pink  <br> not decent <br><br>And you call yourself a man?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Bari bari no pistol wasn't based as fuck. <br> implying Law/Luffy and Gear 4th vs Doffy up until the shitty 10min downtime was subpar </br></br>  <br>probably a low executive of Kaidou<br>so not exactly a huge enemy but not even close to fodder</br></br>  <br>He's a Kaido pirate of unknown ranking except he's the highest of ones who are there.<br>I think you are just assuming he's fodder because he got kicked away by Sanji.</br></br>  So in this arc Zoro will meat his real parents, right?  <br>He's one of the weakest Strawhats. He last time he soloed a big enemy was back in Enies Lobby.</br>  <br>That was my thought. Keep in mind they're following a vivre card rather than a log pose so they might be looking for the heart pirates.</br>  <br><br>flashback =/= fight</br></br>  <br><br>I was referring to the fight as well though.</br></br>  <br>That's the point. Why is simple shounen logic to hard to understand for you?<br><br> Sanji/Chopper/Ceasar speak about saving nami/momo/brook <br> Nami and Co. get attacked <br> Sanji SAVES them <br> Chopper calls them after awhile, because he found something/something happened unrelated to saving nami's group <br><br>That's what happened you dense motherfucker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great. Sabaody is my favorite arc because of the Supernovas</br>  <br><br>Depends on what you consider fodder then.</br></br>  What the fucking happened on Sanji side?<br>Where the fuck are they right now?<br>Who is this fodder that's attacking them?</br></br>  <br>at least Eines Lobby for the most part showed the fights in their entirety before moving to the next one.<br><br>  toei adding a 3rd sky slicer <br>fuck em</br></br></br></br>  these sanji discussions are fucking unreal. Is it going to be like this until the end of one piece?<br><br>also Akainu should've sent Kizaru to dressrosa</br></br>  <br> Eines <br>germanfag pls</br></br>  <br>nameless mooks that get pulverized by dozens with one attack</br>  <br><br>It's going to be like this until Mr. Prince returns or he doesn't job. <br><br>I hope Oda flicks back to that Big Mom part which he has skipped and Sanji did something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meat? Where!?</br>  <br>for example Doflamingo's soldiers were fodder<br>but none of his executives were<br>Sanji could one shot people like Dellinger but he's not fodder</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for when he's going to use his new okama powers and people will go batshit insane flooding the threads with 'HAHA to be actually strong he needs to become an okama what a fucking faggot holy shit the weakest strawhat fuck sanji'</br>  <br>His ship role is "cook" and you expect him to compare combatively to someone like Usopp the sniper?<br>Of course he is weaker than the combat oriented crew members, but he's an excellent swimmer, rescues the whole crew repeatedly in non combat ways, fools plots of main antagonists, and can cook foods to make the main combatants of the crew even stronger.</br></br>  <br>Isn't implied she dies early since when we first see him he's already being raised by the bandit lady?</br>  <br><br> Sanji could one shot people like Dellinger <br><br>Not that I don't agree, but uh-oh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That could have been said of Dragon too until he was suddenly introduced in Logue Town.</br>  <br>there could be lots of reasons for that<br>you seriously lack imagination</br></br>  <br> also Akainu should've sent Kizaru to dressrosa <br><br>Indeed. Kizaru probably would've just killed Doffy when he threatened him (assuming Doffy would've had the balls to do that).</br></br></br>  <br> I can't wait for when he's going to use his new okama powers <br>Literally worst meme.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Although what would've happened to the rest I wonder.<br><br>How would the SH remaining get away from him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually even in Loguetown I think Dragon being Luffy's dad was still a mystery but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>be careful anon, I can already feel the<br><br> implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo <br><br>posts coming at you.<br><br><br>they wouldn't</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> they wouldn't <br> get sent to ID <br> Based Bon gets them out of ID again </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Supernovas would have appeared sooner or latter, Shabaondy would have been shorter but also a lot more boring.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This nigger has the best facial expressions.</br></br>  <br>No, Kizaru is the dog of the tenryubito. He would have killed Law and Luffy and wished Doflamingo luck since he's sanctioned by WG.</br>  <br>Its becuse big mom is luffys mother</br>  <br>Great. We have an attempted thread derail because some faggot can't discuss the topic.<br> hurrrrr ignore the content of the post to focus on grammar. </br></br>  <br> implying Kizaru would send them to ID <br><br>he would probably just murder them on the spot. Taking them to ID? Too much of a bother</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh shit yeah. <br><br>I forgot Sabaody would still carry over.</br></br></br></br>  <br> be careful anon, I can already feel the &gt;implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo posts coming at you. <br><br>Not really, even doffyfags are not that stupid</br></br></br>  <br>well some of them were arguing he could have easily defeated Kuzan just a few months ago, it wouldn't surprise me</br>  <br>Only Hakuba seemed to be able to take on, let alone one shot, Dellinger because he had the speed and took him by surprise. That aside Dellinger was pretty fast too and could've probably distracted Sanji a bit before getting one-shotted.</br>  <br>I could see her being alive (although I think she's dead since Dragon seems single) but I doubt she raised Luffy. I mean come on you'd think this would be brought up even a little Sabo or Ace in flashbacks.</br>  <br>it wasn't known but it was certain if you ever read a shonen before<br><br><br>of course she didn't raise him<br>no one said that<br>also I said she could be alive, I still think she's dead</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if Kaido went to intercept Whitebeard because he knew he would die if he took on the marines and the shichibukai? Kaido didn't want the man who could potentially kill him to die.    <br> implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo <br><br>This nigga fucked up Marco shit and casually blast a hole into Whitebeard's chest. Doffy is child play to him.</br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's most badass moments always came when he was covertly sabotaging the enemies plans and fucking shit up behind the scenes.<br> Mr. Prince throughout the Alabasta saga <br> Infiltrating the Sea Train during Water 7 <br> Sneaking off and closing the Gates of Justice during Enies Lobby <br>Oda really needs to start writing Sanji like this again because it's where his character really shines.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are at similar levels to where both of them wanted to avoid a real fight.<br>Kuzan tried to kill Doffy, Doffy took the attack unblocked undodged and was fine, so even if Kuzan won it wouldn't be through his logia.</br></br>  <br> 40 death sentences <br> Litteraly tortured for who knows how long and with what methods <br> Thinking he would die when taking on the marines and the Shichibukai </br></br></br>  Can we just go back to urouge posting?  <br>Yeah but the post I was replying to talked about Luffy having a flashback, which seems unlikely to me. Although I guess it's still possible since Luffy did only say he thought he didn't have a father, and no didn't have parents.</br>  <br>but of course</br>  <br> He actually thinks it would be a close call <br> Implying it wasn't him just going easy with the shot <br> Unblocked, undodged </br></br></br>  <br>He did nothing to Marco until Marco got distracted by big daddy having a fucking siezure mid combat. Even then it was a VA that cuffed Marco and Kizaru shot him in the back.<br>Kizaru is the least likeable admiral.</br></br>  <br>well it could be more of a Dragon flashback where we see Luffy just a few months old<br><br><br>wev'e already gone to the conclusion that Kaidou's cursing WB because:<br>1. WB died and Kaidou can't, he's jealous<br>2. WB was the only one able to hurt him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kizaru is the least likeable admiral <br><br>while I do agree he looks like the shadiest one and possibly the most sociopathic, I can't help but like the guy. He's got style.</br></br></br>  <br> going easy on the guy trying to kill his good friend in front of his face after ignoring his warning not to kill him <br>Seems highly unlikely anon.<br>He tried to freeze Doffy's heart and kill him, which is stated. He just could not.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is from Oda's editor.. <br><br> Q2: How far along is the story right now, percentage-wise? <br><br> A: He told me that the first part of the story, the part prior to the time-skip, was around halfway through. That was about 60 volumes, so maybe we’re at 70%? I don’t think it’s at 80% yet. Something like that. <br><br><br>So OP is about 70% done. I guess things will ramp up soon. A big Kaido arc and the ending arc would just about fill that time up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kaido might be immortal but we don't know his actual strength yet. He gotten captured plenty of times so maybe he's not all that. Obviously he must have some strength to be a Yonkou but Shanks and Whitebeard may still be able to give him a match  <br> tried to literally smash Robin to pieces when she had done nothing wrong <br> froze the ocean floor so Jinbe wouldn't land in water after Akainu pierced his chest with a magma fist <br> killed Saul in cold blood for trying to stop a genocide <br> joined Blackbeard <br>Where the fuck do you get the idea he'd nerf himself vs someone who ACTUALLY pissed him off?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote you there, ignore that.</br>  <br>For some reason I feel like that wouldn't be enough</br>  <br> trusting Oda's or his editor's estimates as facts. </br>  <br>Things change, maybe not the overall plot but new ideas get added etc.</br>  <br>Oda stated in 2014 it would have taken roughly another ten years to finish the whole thing.<br><br>Besides,<br><br> trusting Oda or anyone close to him about estimated times </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'll get to see the end <br><br>Praise Buggy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He did not state that. He said he felt like he 'could' continue writing one piece for ten more years.<br>That's not the same as saying it has ten years left, it's saying that's the longest he could envision himself writing for it.</br></br>  <br>Its a shame Curly's opponent was Doffy, one of the most OP villains yet.</br>  Why is Sanji's pants still intact after all these fire kicks?  <br>arcs don't make 15% of the entire story</br>  <br>There's no way there's only two arcs left, they haven't even gone to elbaf yet.</br>  <br>I wish Diable Jambe was kept a high-tier power up though, like Asura.</br>  So I was rereading Sabaody and I had totally forgot this panel. Is there still someone but believe Zoro isn't the first mate? How can you not believe based Urogue?  <br><br><br><br>I'm glad you noticed pretending to be a fujoshi faggot wasn't working and came back to your older character to rp, but you should change characters to vary a bit. I'd pick some character that atracts retards and autists, like Kizaru</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Zoro is the first one to join the crew, duh.</br>  <br><br> This speedreader level of comprehension. </br></br>  <br>that believe*</br>  <br>Is Elbaf Fable backwards in moon runes too? Must be the island right before Raftel.</br>  <br><br>I have a stupid theory that donflamingo supplied him with smile because it was a drug + the power of a artificial df. It could maybe work that way as in eating more than two and still living and keeps him addicted to it. <br><br>My guess is the fruit that momo at was what ceaser used as a catalyst to make them and inject the drug so donflamingo could control kaido and why momo is so important.<br><br>Think of it as having the a lion on a leash with his favorite food. The second the food runs out he will probably attack you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, but there are a lot of people who refuse to admit Zoro is the first mate as the second in command.</br>  <br><br><br> editor says an "maybe" estimate on the spot based on the 50% Oda gave him before <br> speedreaders and narutards already assume it's confirmed and start sperging about how much they are happy it's "confirmed" to end soon since they only want the end <br> get autistic and cry when someone states otherwise <br><br>I want all ap forum tards and narutards to leave, pls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Editor Onishi: ONE PIECE is 60-70% done and it will probably finish within 10 years.<br><br>it wasn't oda but his editor, my bad. Still, you're clearly mistaken as you can see. The statement you're referring to was made back in 2002 and referred to the possibility of writing it for another 20 years</br></br></br>  <br>Get out of here Mike "Rolento" Ross</br>  <br>What a useless piece of shit. He should've killed himself after jobbing so hard like this.</br>  <br>I still stand by the idea that One piece is just going to be the final Glyph that Robin will read and realize, "holy shit the world government made this whole shit up just so that pirates would sail the seas and kill each other, but then it got out of hand." Then everyone will redirect their guns at the world government.</br>  <br>You misunderstood his misleading post. What he meant was that he knew WB would die from the Marines and Shichi because he knew of WB's deteriorating condition?</br>  <br>I really don't think the Strawhats have that level of organisation. Is Zoro the strongest below Ruffy? Of course. Is he the first to join? Yes. Is he the second in command? Who cares. Ruffy obviously doesn't.</br>  <br>It's already in canon that Usopp is captain should Luffy die or become unable to continue.<br>Right when Usopp joins he demands this, Luffy accepts, Nami writes it in the log book, and Zoro does not object.<br>Uroge doesn't make Luffy's decisions</br></br></br>  <br><br>I say we have roughly 500-700 chapters left if FI was halfway.</br></br>  <br>the more I think about that the madder I get that Dressrosa took us so long. Like, it wasn't bad, but holy shit it wasn't even a Yonkou arc. They'll have to cut a ton of shit from the now on to make everything else fit</br>  <br> Ruffy <br>Heil Hitler<br><br><br> Uroge doesn't make Luffy's decisions <br> implying </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mashima invented immortals wanting to die <br>holy shit please kill yourself</br></br>  <br> I'm a rabid hater <br> I also discuss and debate a shitposter who's only here since early 2015 <br><br>op threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Urouge doesn't make Luffy's decisions <br><br>Don't underestimate the Urouge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It won't take Blackbeard anywhere near 500 chapters to get to Raftel though, especially if Big Mom and Kaido are resolved in the next hundred and fifty.</br>  <br>I see you never read a manga and only pretend to like 3 (the third is naruto since you are retarded)</br>  <br><br>Well it might do - Raftel is supposed to be difficult to reach after all.</br></br>  <br> other then a more developed character <br>he is as developed as everyone else after the timeskip and that means not much at all<br>go and reread PH</br></br></br>  <br> kizaru <br><br>Which face will he have at EOS when Sanji defeats him by giving a facial surgery? Is there another older actor Oda could base his new face?</br></br></br>  <br>So this was on purpose right?</br>  <br><br> his face turns to another mangaka's </br></br>  <br> What the fucking happened on Sanji side? <br>They fucked ur mom<br><br> Where the fuck are they right now? <br>on her room<br><br> Who is this fodder that's attacking them? <br>ur mom.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> it's kubo </br>  <br> They'll have to cut a ton of shit from the now on to make everything else fit <br>Fit everything else in what? Are you one of those faggots that think Oda is trying to end it at ch 1000? That's why people are saying not to take the time estimates seriously because it always changes. Oda is shit at estimating how long his series will take since he always adds in more stuff than he anticipated. I doubt he or his editors or especially Jump will give him a time limit on when his series needs to end.</br></br>  <br>What about Raftel makes is too hard to reach, though?<br><br>Can't the Marines simple just skip over to the island with their anti Sea monster technology?<br><br>I also doubt the important people in the One Piece Manga can't reach it. They're always found fucking around on islands all over the world, which implies that they have some form of high speed travel.</br></br></br></br></br>  How long will Fujitora will stall catch the straw hats?<br><br>Will he have any chance of fighting Kaidou?</br></br>  <br>Sanji's lack of a real bounty poster is totally playing into this. He is bound to be involved in the underworld at some point just due to his anonymity</br>  <br>The most recent thing that we know is that Oda wanted to make a Boobs sector but editors forced him to rename it to B sector.</br>  <br><br> Since when were you under the impression I lost? </br></br>  <br> tripfags think they can redirect people <br><br>filtered.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody knows yet - but the meeting between Roger and WB implies it's more than simply 'getting to' the location of the island.<br><br>Because many people know where it is, it's at the end of the New World (or supposed to be).<br><br>But why would Roger say 'Wanna know how to 'reach' Raftel' to Whitebeard of all people, if it wasn't so difficult?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For all we know he will continually help the straw hats rolling ones until the end of the story, a de facto straw hat Marine Armada.</br>  One Piece is back baby<br><br> Mr Prince  <br> Nami's delicious thighs <br> Brook <br> Kaido is a fucking beast </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It never left</br>  <br> What about Raftel makes is too hard to reach, though? <br>You think Oda is reading these threads faggot?</br></br>  <br> He's one of the weakest Stawhats. <br>get the fuck outta here</br></br>  <br>He's shitposting m8, it's even a pasta. Like when people shitpost about sabo or doffy</br>  Could Urouge solo the Kidd allliance?  <br>You also missed the part where he took out the second best of almost all of One Piece antagonists, and Oars leg</br>  <br> Nami's delicious thighs <br>absolutely</br></br>  <br><br>Of course.</br></br>  <br><br>there are a lot of obstacles <br><br> marco and the whitebeard pirates which was confirmed as being able to oppose BB <br><br> shanks of course until he dies lol <br><br> world government <br><br> big mom </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wanking a sub character just because you are gay for him <br><br>Worse than an enelfag.</br></br></br>  <br> least likeable admiral <br>Really? Among the pre-timeskip admirals he seems to be the most proper one, not as easygoing as Aokiji, nor a dickward like Akainu. He's totally chilled while the latters fought each others in a death battle over some promotion (an act which I find very out of place for a marine, not to mention the WG was kinda facing a difficult time after the war against WB, and there they are, butting head to head). I'm also curious at the fact there's absolute no mention of him post timeskip so far.</br></br>  <br>Poor Brook, not having a dick anymore must be hell on earth when this hot piece of ass is around you 24/7</br>  <br><br>And;<br><br><br>It was difficult even back when it was a wasteland with some legends roaming around to shit on your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maynard would catch on a some point.</br>  <br>Are you saying Ussopp is stronger than Sanji? Are you for fucking real? <br><br>Ussopp took out a person with a power level of 9<br>Sanji took out someone with a power level 2180</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he doesn't have a boner at all times </br>  <br><br> implying his bone(r) isn't hard </br></br>  <br>Sanji lack the speed to OHKO Dellinger, which is retarded anyway, how come Luffy can now use geppou but Sanji still lack basic stuff like Soru?</br>  <br>Kizaru will have a buttface thanks to Sanji defeating him. Then everytime he says "oy oy", his buttocks face all tremble.</br>  <br>Rayleigh could swim to anywhere in the one piece world.<br>It's not about just going to the right location, theres many other potential factors.<br>1. The right tide<br>2. Right altitude<br>3. Maybe you need a key or a magic word<br>4. Right time/season/moon alignment<br>5. Might need to be a D.<br>Most likely what happens is, a strong pirate reaches the location, and nothing of interest is there, so they decide it was bullshit, and just drop the dream and amass wealth and power normally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> power levels in one piece <br><br>there is no such thing anon, anyone could take on anyone given the right situation.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Sanji can geppou too (and 'properly'), so surprising he can't soru as well really.</br></br>  <br>What am I supposed to see here ?</br>  <br> not being able to handle the banter </br>  Jimbe will defeat Ryokugyu right? Since Luffy is confirmed to defeat Akainu, Sanji is confirmed to defeat Kizaru, and Zoro is confirmed to defeat Fuji<br><br>Does that mean Ryokugyu will be an Earth logia?</br></br>  <br><br> lack of speed <br><br>we haven't seen him do anything speed worthy since he did his sea walk vs the kracken. We could assume he is fast but he has only showcased little of his power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. Jabra could've killed Ussopp easily but Sanji saved his ass.</br>  <br>By that time he will be at least tsundere so it won't matter</br>  <br>Also<br> Have you ever been kicked at the speed of light <br>How could anyone not like this</br></br></br>    <br>yfw Raftel is Letraf backwards</br>  <br>Can someone post the page?

You don't treat it like a saint just because you are a fanboy in love. That would make you as bad as an enelfag.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice trips.<br>Kuzan isnt honorable but he wants to be. The rest seems accurate.<br><br>Since Kizaru is an overpowered Coward why don't people speculate that Usopp will beat him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah kizarufags are showing themselves as a pretty sad bunch. They shitpost all day but can't take it back, like babbies.</br>  <br><br> guns killing people in One Piece outside of flashbacks <br> implying that changes anything <br><br>I wanted Luffy to punch him and all, but Kizaru was literally doing his job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Usopp will have Buggy already, seems too fitting.</br>  <br>Surely God will have Light on his side ?<br> Kizaru future ally confirmed </br></br>  <br>I wanna know what face Kizarufags will make if Usopp beats him.</br>   didn't show glassless doffy   <br><br> Ooh scary </br></br>  <br> implying <br>I dislike all the pre timeskip admirals, it's just so happened that I hate Kizaru the least out of the 3.</br></br>  <br>Nizaris has a power that lets him overwhelm almost anything, so he is never scared, but Usopp's specialty all story has been putting fear into the heart of his enemy.</br>   Fuji fights Akainu <br> he summons the moon to crash into Earth <br> Enel is on it <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I meant. <br><br>He's been saying that all series with confidence and not giving a shit, but this time he will shit his pants.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji kicks Kizaru so hard he mentally breaks <br> becomes Sanji sidekick <br> everywhere Sanji goes, he's followed by this mentally broken, former admiral who helps him cook and acts as his personal butler <br><br>pls Oda!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Despite it being like a hooker, I'm glad she's finally wearing clothes.<br>Also I'm glad Brook got hi</br></br>  <br> enel doesn't know what the fuck is going on and is just pissed someone stole all his fairyvearth or whatever </br>    <br><br> the moon <br> not moons <br><br> each moon contains difference races/aliens <br> One Piece Z begins </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Despite it being like a hooker <br>go back to church you acolyte</br></br>  <br> enel appears for exactly to panels before being crushed by moon itself <br> nobody notices him <br> no more mentions of it <br> he never shows again </br></br></br></br>  The scary thing about Kizaru is how fucking detached he seems as he goes about his orders. He seems like the type who could mow down a bunch of little children without being phased.  <br>I'm not sure I understand. Your face looks dismayed, defeated. That shit would be the most hype thing ever.</br>  <br><br>How is it bait when it's true.<br><br>Well aside from implying the immortal wanting to kill themselves character is original with Zeref.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru is there for the job and because following morals in a world where you have to choose between pirate anarchy and tenryuubito zionism is simply stupid, people like Aokiji or Garp are even more cowards, because they protected this rotten system while following said morals just to leave when their own interest were trashed.</br>  <br> Sanji has glasses now instead <br><br>Also we did not see Kaido's eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>Enel can't be crushed he'd just turn himself into electricity and escape. He's a logia</br>  <br> Sanji lack the speed to OHKO Dellinger <br>where do you get that from exactly?</br></br>  What do you think Kaido meant by saying "Whitebeard really did a number on me" ?<br><br>I mean he's been dead for 2 years<br><br>Did Whitebeard tell him to an hero by jumping from a sky island?</br></br></br></br>  <br> being a literal fedora fag <br><br>Do you write fanfic about a fedora kizaru killing your school bullies too? And then you marry him?</br></br></br>  <br>Makes sense though. Kuzan was Moral Justice, Akainu was pretty Brutal. Third one's gotta be the guy that just does it.</br>  <br>Well he is the assassin admiral or something right? So that makes plenty of sense character-wise. Plus when you're literally light I imagine its hard to get fazed</br>  <br>I seriously hope you're -15 if the very first thing that comes to your mind after the idea of the "immortal tired of life" is Fairy Tail.</br>  <br>Whitebeard died, so he beat Kaido in that regard. Simple as that.</br>  <br>he'd be too busy screaming in fear, like a little bitch.</br>  <br>Isn't that exactly why it's bait ?</br>  <br>never happened don't worry</br>  <br>but defensive logia reactions are subconcious and instant. Try again, retard.</br>  <br>Why would he ? The moon's not made put of rubber, presumably.</br>  <br> What do you think Kaido meant by saying "Whitebeard really did a number on me" ? <br>In dying, Whitebeard did what Kaido couldn't.<br><br>Kaido actually wants to start a massive war because when Whitebeard did the same it resulted in his death.</br></br></br></br>  Is Sanji Marco tier now?  <br><br> huge moons falls over him from nowhere <br> dumb narutards who obssess about power levels think he will be fine <br><br>Enelfags are funny kids.</br></br></br></br></br>  So i think probably someone already poninted this but, do you guys think Kaido is an actual devil fruit user?<br>I've been thinking he might not, because if he is, why doesn't he just jump to the sea to die.<br> Inb4 he's so powerful that he can still move on water or hold breath for days. </br></br>  <br>Fedora: the post</br>  <br>You don't seriously think Sanji is as fast as Hakuba or even cp9 speed right?</br>  <br>from his ass, he is a kid who started to shitpost here this year</br>  <br>he's detached because he's that fucking strong<br>no one gives him the chills</br></br>  <br>The water would go on land if he went into the oceans. :^9</br>  <br>Even if he had no powers, he could just eat two fruits and die.</br>  <br><br><br> so triggered and mad about sanji being back, he gives up on pretending to be a gay fujoshi and go back to pretending to hate Spiral <br><br>the funny thing is that you fap to spiral every day irl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this is shit bait but for my sanity, I advise you to look up what a Logia is.</br>  <br>Jumping to the sea will just eternally trap him in there, as if an immortal will need oxygen to breath.</br>  <br>Kuzan has moral justice, Kizaru has lazy justice (I think?), Akainu has absolute justice, or something.<br><br>Fuji has blind justice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>His arm ate a fruit sheep mode.</br></br>  Why does the general audience eat up moeshit when there are japanese artists that are quite capable of producing objectively better art?  <br>That means cute is the superior way to evoke emotion.<br><br>Less skill/effort but the effect is still felt.</br></br></br>  <br>Commercial art exists.</br>  <br><br>That kind of mentally is one of a cause of the decline of the anime industry.<br>Yeah, sure. You guys are better off that way but it hurts people who got "better" taste than you though I suppose you guys don't care about that anyway. <br>Don't you want better things to watch? Are you really content with what you're having right now or is it just a lie to make you feel better about anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What sells at the time is far more dependent on the current trends in society rather than the actual quality of the piece. It's why something like LOGH is lesser known in general while Naruto got fuck huge popular.</br>  <br> /v/: the thread </br>  Mook translation:  http://aitaikimochi.tumblr.com/post<wbr>/125504782946<br/></wbr> <br><br>Where were you when RinHaru finally became canon?</br></br>  Why is RinHaru so one-sided?  <br>GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY</br>  WTF is this?

We would never have had to suffer Rei telling boring stories or that idiotic robot reveal or the pointless drama.</br></br>  <br>My favorite mook &gt; shit &gt; you're favorite mook</br>  <br>I enjoyed the MomoAi mook so I wouldn't mind more of it at all.</br>  <br><br>Makoto and Haru had 10 pages, Rin and Haru had 8, everyone else had 6.</br></br>  <br>SouRin &gt; RinHaru = MomoAi &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>See, why didn't they make 6 pages for each pairing, since this seems to be what they were going for initially.</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; SouRin &gt; HaruRin &gt; MakoHaru &gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = RinHaru &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; SouRin &gt; HaruRin = MakoHaru &gt; shit &gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = HaruRin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei.</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; RinHaru &gt; SouRin = MakoHaru, NagiRei</br>  <br>MomoAi &gt; MakoHaru &gt; HaruRin &gt; SouRin &gt; NagiRei</br>   people still don't understand the NagiRei mook was a masterpiece   <br>Maybe they made the MakoHaru mook longer to make it up to the fujos since the mook was delayed a few months. And then RinHaru mook was a bit longer too since they were the last to get one and for the longest time people thought there would be no RinHaru mook.</br>  <br>2deep4them</br>  <br>SouRin &gt; MomoAi = HaruRin &gt; MakoHaru &gt;&gt;Shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NagiRei</br>  <br>Ignore those bigots, they just don't understand the pure love between a human and his sexbot.</br>  I'm glad everyone enjoyed the SouRin mook so much since that's about all you'll be getting from KyoAni for a while.  <br>If this is all I'll be getting from kyoani then I'm content enough.</br>  <br>That's all everyone except for MakoHarufags will be getting from KyoAni in the next months.

Because he drank the half fish man’s blood, his muscles suddenly got a huge powerup. He yanks the bars! <br> The gangsters are still approaching and look at Rin breaking open the bars.

But he was in all the others, as gay as they seemed, so it would be weird not to have him here too.</br></br>  <br>Someone suggested it was just Halloween costumes, but it seems early for that.</br>  <br>They'll definitely all be there.<br>Sousuke and Makoto could be adventurers, like normal humans who got lost in a forest filled with creatures. And Rin could be the princess they just rescued.</br></br>  <br> And Rin could be the princess <br>Please</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Flower Afternoon is releasing on August. Even if it's late August, there's still two whole months until Halloween.</br>  <br>Nagisa doesn't seem very forest-like. Maybe it's like an amusement park? And he seems to have someone else wearing the same behind (there's an orange shirt but the stripes don't match, and neither does the green vest). Also, he seems to be holding something, like a bag or pillow.</br>  <br>Yeah I just realized that too. But the shota Halloween artwork didn't make much sense either so who knows.<br>I thought maybe he was sitting at a table which is covered with a white drape, sitting (which is why you can see his legs, in purple pants). It seems a bit like a tea party in a meadow or something.<br>Also maybe the wings are just part of his fab outfits and all the other guys are dressed normally, and staring at him like "what the fuck is this disaster".</br></br></br>  Since we're having a live thread, might as well dump these here for those who have missed them. Bigger scans of those clear files that came together with High Speed movie tickets.  I'm still mad about the bland Alice in Wonderland official art we got.  <br>Based, I was looking for these in hq.</br>            <br>Also two pages from the HaruRin mook which weren't posted before. Nothing very interesting, as you can see, just a selection of scenes for each character.</br>    <br>I don't know if adding Sousuke's hearteyes was really necessary.</br>  <br>This is some weird shit.</br>   142 posts <br> 22 posters <br>Sasuga Free thread</br></br>  <br>I guess it can't be helped since about 80% of Rin's screentime in S2 was with Sousuke. They could have used some scenes from episode 12 but maybe those were used on the staff interview pages or something, I don't know.</br>  Mamo confirmed being in the HS2 movie. So we'll definitely be seeing Rin in some capacity.   Utsumi: But [Haruka] would have to study as well, so he's probably really annoyed as he's doing it. Plus he doesn't have anyone to rely on anymore (haha). <br> Nishiya: Someone to rely on? Doesn't he meet with Makoto fairly frequently? <br> Utsumi: I don't really know about that. Personally...well, while I'd like to share my personal thoughts, I think I'll leave it up to everyone's imaginations! <br><br>MakoHaru BTFO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is this info from? But this is nothing surprising, really, we already knew they would put him there in some form, at least in flashbacks or something.</br>  <br>The mook. Mamo mentions working on it.</br>  <br> RinHaru finally became canon <br>Does this mean SouMako is finally canon too?</br></br>   "I believe that [Haruka and Rin] form the core axis of ‘Free!’s story, and I have such deep emotional attachments to them that, if I wanted to, I could talk about them for ages." <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook </br>  <br><br>Baby's first wet dream?</br></br>  <br> trusting fencer's biased translation </br>  <br><br>Snippets only? When will fujoa translate the full interview?</br></br>  <br> Utsumi: Well…I would not say that Haruka and Rin are halves of each other. If anything, I think that Makoto would be the other half of Haruka. As for Rin, it’s clear that the person who understands him the most is Sousuke, and HighSpeed has iterated time and again that Sousuke is Rin’s other self. For Haruka and Rin, although they definitely complement each other, if it wasn’t for the common interest of swimming that they both have, they probably would not have become friends because of their opposite personalities. </br>  <br>Stay mad Makoharufag</br>  <br>No idea, apparently fencer's not doing it. Maybe some other fujo will.</br>  <br> Yoneda  <br>At the end of s2, tho they chose their paths, they were still together<br> Nishiya <br> This time, they had their first fight in s2, but in the end they properly made up and were able to move forward. I think from now on they'll be able to keep their relationship always the same. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously telling me even Fencer isn't doing the full thing?</br>  <br> slidufhsldiufs I am so behind on things to post/translate/write that I don’t think I’ll have time to do the ENTIRE interviews, but I’m posting fun bits as I read! <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br> not even fencer gives a shit anymore </br>  <br>What a useless piece of shit.</br>  <br> apparently fencer's not doing it <br><br>So she only translated two snippets out of the entire interview? Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>How sad, only two parts were fun to her.</br>   REGARDING WHERE THEY WOULD GO ON A TRIP WITH HARUKA AND RIN <br><br>Mamo: Then why not just go to Australia, in that case? Then, Rin and Haruka would sleep in the same bed, and I and Nobunaga-kun would sleep in the same bed.<br>Zakki: Ah, I get it--recreating that scene [from S2E12]. (haha)<br>Mamo: Yeah, like, 'There's only two beds!!' (haha) I wanna hit up all the [Free!] holy sites too. Let's go to that hotel that they stayed at.<br>Zakki: Let's go! To the same room from the anime!<br>Mamo: But that room only had one bed, huh. Uwaaah, four people in one bed? No way~!<br>Zakki: Sleeping back-to-back wouldn't even be possible then...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, there's more, I just didn't post it yet. That MakoHaru bit threw me off too much.<br><br> "We didn’t use it in the episode, but we also went to an aquarium in Australia. There was some suggestion that maybe Rin could take Haruka there to help him feel at ease. " <br> - Yoneda, HaruRin mook staff interview <br><br> "[In the final scene of the series], Rin as usual is eager for a race, but Haruka smiles when he looks at Rin. All we really see is that, but I believe that’s a shot that illustrates their new relationship as they walk down the same path of professional swimming together. " <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook <br><br> Mamo: So the bed scene, then? <br> Zakki: If you're going to talk about it, call it the 'scene where they talk while in bed'! (haha) <br> Mamo: Hey, it's not incorrect, is it? They're two people, sleeping in one bed together, after all. <br><br> "[Haruka and Rin] just feel like the ‘destined pair’ for one another." <br> - Miyano Mamoru, cast interview in HaruRin mook. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Makoto and Haru: "This sort of distance where they can see each other on occasion really suits them." </br></br></br>  <br> "[In the final scene of the series], Rin as usual is eager for a race, but Haruka smiles when he looks at Rin. All we really see is that, but I believe that’s a shot that illustrates their new relationship as they walk down the same path of professional swimming together. " <br> - Utsumi Hiroko, staff interview in HaruRin mook <br>As usual nothing Utsumi says makes sense. What a shitty director.</br></br></br>  <br>Any more besides those? These were spoiled before.</br>  <br>This romanchikku sakura is cute and shit, but I am disappoint. I wanted it to be as ridiculous as the other -<br><br> *SLAM* <br> The gangster punches Rin in the face. <br><br>Kyoani finds a way.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday Nagislut  <br>Don't think so, maybe some other fujo translated something.</br>  Happy birthday best boy!  <br><br><br><br>So basically Utsumi says different things depending on which shippers they're trying to appeal to. Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's really little considering the length of the interview.</br>  <br>You only figured that out now?</br>  <br>Why can't Utsumi kill herself?</br>  <br>Nah, it's just funny seeing those interview quotes next to each other and how transparent Utsumi is.</br>  <br>There isn't any contradiction in her words. By saying to use their imagination, she didn't say anything to go against her previous words.</br>  Happy Birthday, Nagisa! I will love you forever and ever.  <br> So basically Utsumi says different things depending on which doujins she fapped to that morning. <br>ftfy<br>Utsumi a 2D slut who cheats on her husbando</br></br></br>  <br>I think that the rediscovery book fujo who was linked to earlier might translate something. I think she likes Haru and Rin but I don't know for sure.</br>    <br>Makoto gets to be  free  from being Haru's nanny for the rest of his life and has probably moved on to dicking him down whenever they meet thank you Utsumi.</br>  <br>Because she's smart enough to know that pandering to both sides means more money for KyoAni and she's probably laughing to herself all day every day</br>  <br>Slut.</br>  <br> implying <br>He still has to pick up Haru from his bathtub every day so Haru doesn't drown himself.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks anon, I did actually missed them. What's with the line they all have, though? Part of the clear file or shit scan?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's understandable that she didn't want to talk about Makoharu in a mook about another pairing. It would be different if she said something contradictory.</br>  <br>Well, technically not. It's like that one time when she said that Haru and Rin would spend their days globetrotting the world together, and then a few days later another interview came out where she said they would only see each other at competitions and otherwise cheer each other on from their respective abodes (or something along those lines). Technically she didn't contradict herself because while Haru and Rin are both pursuing professional swimming, that doesn't mean they will be together all the time, but there is a clear difference in wording. Obviously HaruRin fujos latched onto the first quote while MakoHaru fujos prefer the second one.</br>  <br>Today is raining here. And Makoto's so pretty in this picture. I love him so much.</br>  <br>It's normal for a masochist who likes dick in his mouth.</br>  <br> It's like that one time when she said that Haru and Rin would spend their days globetrotting the world together <br>She didn't say that, it was something in a magazine. <br> she said they would only see each other at competitions and otherwise cheer each other on from their respective abodes <br>Now this she did say.</br></br></br></br>   all this MakoHaru vs HaruRin shitflinging <br>W-what if I like SouRin?</br>  <br>Just a shit scan but those are the biggest versions I could find. There are also smaller versions without the lines, if you're interested I could look for them for you.</br>  <br>Suicide is the only option.</br>  <br>Then you have good taste.</br>  <br>She actually didn't say the globetrotting thing, it was from the magazine. Considering how much she had been pandering to the MakoHaru fujos in previous interviews, it really confused me that she would even imply they would grow apart from each other but I guess it makes sense since it's in the HaruRin mook.</br>  <br><br><br>Well, they did mentioned in the event that everyone would be in it so it's not surprising at all. But they sure are taking their time filling the Cast section in the official site. Tatsuhisa appeared recently, it was only Shimazaki since the announcement of the movie.<br>http://movie-highspeed.com/cast-sta<wbr>ff/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>You aren't even on Utsumi's mind enough for her to mention Sousuke in the interview.</br>  <br>You can be the middle man in a MakoHaru and HaruRin sandwich.</br>  <br>Who is this Sousuke person</br>  <br> it really confused me that she would even imply they would grow apart from each other <br><br>She didn't have the guts so she cop out by saying to use their imagination.</br></br></br>  <br>We talk about SouRin in 90% of the threads, where have you been?</br>   panders to MakoHaru in one interview <br> panders to RinHaru in another interview <br>But what does Utsumi really ship?</br></br>  <br>They guy Rin is crying for here</br>  <br>I other have a few pics on my phone.</br>  <br>No, these are more than okay. The line can be easily removed with some editing, I guess.

And they used some old shitty art for the announcement.</br></wbr>  <br>As expected, retards would latch on to something in a magazine but not the director's.</br>  <br>Then you share the same preference as most shippers in these threads</br>  <br> a Leo and a Virgo <br><br>It's like a recipe for domestic abuse given physical form.</br></br></br>  <br>Taito are lazy fucks who put out the same boring merch every time. What do you expect?</br>  Did anyone ever post the MakoHaru staff interview or did their fujos schlick to death over all the pandering?  <br> horoscope <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br>It's the second most popular pairing so it's not just these threads.</br>  Friendly reminder that real OTP is Rin x  ...Me...   <br>It's still being translated, I think.</br>  <br>Sousuke what are you doing on 4chan</br>  <br> Nishiya (character designer) says he created Makoto and Haru as a set.he actually said while creating them he thought of them as a set. <br> Makoto's popularity was a surprise to all of them.. Tho utsumi thought he was going to be popular he didn't think Makoto would be THIS popular <br> Utsumi: of course there are many good scenes in s2, since you 2 already brought them up, for me it's s1e6 "If Haru's not there it's no good" <br> Utsumi: the line itself is from the original. When I read the original it was the most shocking scene for me. I can't believe he said that! <br> Utsumi: That's when their relationship became interesting. It triggered Haru to do the relay and showed Makoto's courage. <br> Utsumi: it impressed me so much I wanted Makoto to say it in the anime too. <br> Utsumi: For Makoto, saying I want to swim with Haru has different meaning than the others saying they want to swim with Haru. <br> Utsumi: For Nagisa &amp; Rin, they watch Haru swim, it's so to speak, through swimming. Only Makoto is attracted to Haruka's presence itself. <br> Utsumi: it was that life or death moment only that Makoto could say his real feelings. Otherwise, due to his personality he'd never say it. <br> Apparently Utsumi's favorite feature of Makoto is the nape (neck hairline) and she made them retake if it wasn't showing <br> Talking about their bodies, Nishiya says Haru has smooth, slender feel like a swimmer, with beautiful muscles not over the top. <br> It was important to show the body difference with Makoto. Makoto is well muscled. Then he asks whose body is better, Makoto or Rin... <br> Utsumi: both are muscular, but Makoto always put on muscles easily, unlike Rin who had to work hard. I think Rin's secretly jealous of him. <br> Utsumi: personally, when drawing Haru's muscles I'm left wanting. When drawing Makoto's muscles I'm completely satisfied. <br><br>I only have snippets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From Taito? Nothing, really. They've disappointed enough already. <br><br>There's absolutely nothing nice about this Star Night thing. The chibi art is shit too. But well, at least is some news.</br></br></br>  <br>Haru is a pure girl, not a slut.</br>  <br>Virgo and Aquarius are shit as well. So are Aquarius and Cancer. Rin confirmed to die alone based on horoscopes.</br>  <br><br> Yoneda saying they received passionate expressions from many fans, more than they expected at the start. <br> Haruka and Makoto are really so loved and she's so grateful for that. At the end of s2, tho they chose their paths, they were still together <br> She wants to see them always happy together and feels the fans must feel the same way. From now on too, watch over them. Thank you. <br> Nishiya: from the start of the production, I could keep drawing from these two. Looking back, I think heartily it was a really fine balance <br> This time, they had their first fight in s2, but in the end they properly made up and were able to move forward. I think from now on they'll be able to keep their relationship always the same.These two were a miracle to me. I'll be happy if you watch over them warmly. Thank you. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ai deserving happiness <br>Ai is Nagisa's playtoy on MWF, Rei covers TThSat, and Sunday is his day of rest.</br></br>  <br>Scorpio and Cancer are the best match.</br>  <br>Aquarius get along great with Sagittarius so he should be with Momo or Rei.</br>  <br>Utsumi, stop learning English from 4chan.</br>  <br> &gt;Utsumi: both are muscular, but Makoto always put on muscles easily, unlike Rin who had to work hard. I think Rin's secretly jealous of him. <br><br>Based on Rin's dream and the delivery boy track, there's definitely some breast envy going on there.</br></br></br>  <br> You'll never hug her <br>Why live ;_;</br></br>  https://twitter.com/nobunaga_s/stat<wbr>us/627083257515892736<br>So, Nobunaga is going to the cafe? I don't get it. The cafe has been open for a while now, right?</br></wbr>  <br> She didn't say that, it was something in a magazine. <br><br> She actually didn't say the globetrotting thing, it was from the magazine. <br><br>Tumblr so stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> MomoRin is finally canon <br>Thank you based horoscope</br></br>  <br>Virgo and Aquarius aren't pre-destined disasters as long as they both know how to keep talking. Aquarius and Cancer, that would an adventure up until the commitment issues come into play, which is why HaruRin is like cursing both characters to an whirlwind honeymoon followed by a most unhappy life.</br>   seriously discussing horoscopes <br>This is too normalfag for me.</br>  <br>Let's shitpost about something fun instead.</br>  <br>Not really, because longer ones (i.e. MakoHaru's mook) had other characters appear with significant appearance time. Whereas straightforward stories like ReiNagi's are short because it only focuses on the main two.</br>  So why are these not Alter's? It's definitively not bad sales, since they opened pre-orders for a second batch of Haru and Makoto's scales.  But which Free would you fug?  <br>You're husbando.</br>  <br>Because Alter is too busy making idolshit</br>  <br><br>Or maybe Nagisa in that pic has butterfly wings (switch with Rei), Rei will have penguin flaps, and the other pairs will switch animal characteristics.</br></br>  <br>If Utsumi and co really wanted to make it a friendship cake triangle, she should have had Rin's birthday be a month later.<br><br><br> which is why HaruRin is like cursing both characters to an whirlwind honeymoon followed by a most unhappy life. <br><br>Not if they keep competing with each other forever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rin-chan is cute.<br>CUTE!</br>  <br>  It's definitively not bad sales, since they opened pre-orders for a second batch of Haru and Makoto's scales. <br>You answered your own question. They're making an second batch because Haru and Makoto sells and didn't bother with Nagisa or Rei.</br></br>  <br>Anon, butterflies don't have translucent wings.</br>  <br> Penguin Rei <br>Fucking ew</br></br>  <br>Careers don't last forever, and Cancer's not going to expend the energy to sustain something they don't think is going to last. Plus, Aquarians are "I don't wanna be locked in a cage" flakes, so they're doomed from both ends. They could do the fuckbuddies thing on the once every couple of months schedule and be perfectly okay, but attempting a commitment? Better to just drink poison.</br>  <br>Dick/Anus</br>   Horoscope fags     <br>I don't think you got the point. Free sells well. Even the less popular characters have decent sells (at least in other areas like kuji), thanks to completionists. I know kuji is not the same as scales, but making Sosuke would have definitively bring some good money. I don't understand why Alter slept through it and let this other company take the glory.</br>  <br>That is correct</br>  <br>They are terrible. Everyone already knows that RinHaru became canon today, sasuga Utsumi's favourite OTP of all time.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>I see, thanks for the correction. Could anyone help me find that second quote? I distinctly remember it being posted in one of these threads some months ago but it doesn't show up in the archive for me.</br></br>  <br>Alter wouldn't have made another Rin scale before selling his first or before a second one for Makoto or Haru. Rin is only getting another scale before two more popular characters because of his popular ship.</br>  <br> muh horoscope <br>I'm a Cancer and I have exactly zero typical Cancer traits, fuck off with this woodoo shit</br></br>  <br><br>Rin a shit</br></br>  <br>Fuck off defensive cunt.</br>  <br><br>Fuck ON</br></br>  <br> Alter wouldn't have made another Rin scale before selling his first <br>Well, yeah. I was talking more about Alter's missing Sosuke's first scale and not making the pair. Of course they wouldn't have made another Rin scale, they had one already.</br></br>  <br> These butthuted Sourinfags <br>SouRin is a fucking shit, go fuck yourself.</br></br>    <br>Typical cancer.</br>    <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Harufag pls</br>  <br>I'm a Sagittarius and I'm nothing like one too but it's fun to talk about characters' zodiac signs sometimes because some authors actually keep those in mind when assigning their characters' birthdays.</br>  <br>Haru a shit</br>  <br> Rin will never blow you a kiss <br>Fucking kill me</br></br>  Post best girl  <br> in a Free thread  <br> not total cancer </br></br>  <br>Exactly like something a Cancer would say.</br>  <br>I actually looked up Virgo male/Aquarius female dynamics some months ago and it was strangely spot on.</br>  <br>Post your address.</br>  Happy birthday, Nagisa.  <br> Rin will never blow you <br>Fucking kill me</br></br>  <br> Are Haruka and Rin best friends? Or rivals? <br>They’re eternal rivals! Haruka and Makoto, and Rin and Sousuke’s relationships give me more of the image of best friends. But I believe that, even if Haruka and Rin are walking different roads or in different locations, the kind of relationship where they’ll be sure to come to heads wherever they may end up in the future is very ‘them’. Rather than being together all the time, I have a stronger image of them–in their separate locales–urging each other on and reuniting at a meet to battle it out.</br></br>  <br>It irks me that very few bother with male/male relationship compatibility.</br>  <br> Harufag shows up <br> thread goes to shit <br>Like clockwork.</br></br></br>    <br>That wouldn't have been accurate anyway since Rin's a girl.</br>  <br>Makoto a shit</br>  <br> all that birthday sex <br><br>Nagisa's gonna get straight rekt.</br></br></br>  <br>Especially since Free didn't bother with the blood type horoscope and chose to emphasize birthdays for more money.</br>  <br> Rin will never blow you </br>  <br>What birthday sex? Rei is useless in bed</br>    <br>Okay.</br>  <br>Was KyoAni thinking internationally when they made free? They always seemed like a studio that considers foreign fans too.</br>  <br>Mighty Samezuka will step up to the plate if Madame Butterfly can't get the job done.</br>   horoscopes   <br>But you just posted worst girl.</br>  Happy birthday  Which Free has the best ass?  <br><br>Yes, dear, we heard you the first time, now shut it.</br></br>  <br>UMARU IS LOVE<br><br>UMARU IS LIFE</br></br></br>  <br> Virgo and Aquarius aren't pre-destined disasters as long as they both know how to keep talking. <br>That sounds accurate. Sousuke and Rin and had their differences and separated because of that but their experiences made them change and grow up and in S2 they got on the same track again and became even closer than before (speaking of mentality here, obviously the injury prevents them from being together physically again, at least for now).<br><br><br>Reminds me of this doujin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's more than one person who hates that shit, you retarded fujo.</br>  <br> implying it has to be Rei <br>Nagisa can decide on anybody and they'll just submit to the perfect semen demon he is.</br></br>  <br>If you insist</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Indeed she is.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Whatever, samefag. You know where the door is.</br>  <br>Much appreciated, thank you.</br>  <br>Didn't they premiere an episode at some convention? But other than that, not really.</br>    <br>Nagisa is probably the only one who goes well with everyone, be it Iwatobi or Samezuka.</br>  Reminder that Haru and Nitori are the most compatible couple  <br> Doujin <br>Perverted Sousuke is best Sousuke.</br></br>  Happy happy birthday  <br>Well, they did had an English version of the AniDo event site. And then there's that infamous Engrish leaflet they gave at some USA event, I think.</br>  <br>And that's why he's the best.</br>  <br>We knew from the secret fujo messages Utsumi gave us.</br>    Happy birthday, Nagisa. I wasn't very fond of you in S1 for some reason but now you're one of my favorites and I hope you have a wonderful day filled with all kinds of sweet treats.  <br> not Makoto and Sousuke </br>    <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Yes, not.</br>  <br>Mook when?</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Those muscles look repulsive</br>  <br> Cancer/Capricorn <br>Usually works out really well, if a bit boring for being so rigidly traditional.</br></br>  <br>They don't even have symbolic blue roses to represent their love.</br>  <br>Wrong</br>    Birthday messages?  <br>Utsumi is working on it and the HaruRin/SouMako double wedding movie as we speak. That's why she isn't involved with the High Speed movie.</br>  <br>No birthday messages this year, just merch.</br>  <br> cowtits <br>Into the trash it goes</br></br>   Utsumi: I thought that Sousuke and Makoto would probably become good friends while cheering on Haruka and Rin.   <br>We get a written one earlier with the merch. No audio messages.<br>Nagisa drew some cute stars and a smiley face.</br></br>  <br>CANON<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Confirmed.</br></br>  <br><br> Love Shit </br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Ebina is lovely.</br>  <br> RinHaru <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>barabros confirmed</br>  <br> Freeshit </br>  <br>When you compare them like that, they really do look like a gay couple and a lesbian couple.</br>  <br>At least be more creative and use something like "kuso raibu".</br>  <br><br>Get the fuck out of here with this crap, or we'll track your bullshit threads down and assfuck them to death while you cry bitter tears.</br></br>  Why are LLfags so insufferable?

The last week was the hardest one for the group in years (I lost my credit card, Paypal without funds, my PC crashed and it is still broken). Very well, I'm writting this just to let you know that our website is online again, and we'll still scanlating Prison School, but please be patient 'till the weekend. <br><br>That weekend is already past.

She will probably develop a fetish for having sex in places where people might run into them. After all, that's what happened every time she interacted with Kiyoshi.</br></br>  How are you supposed to not get a boner to piss while is staring at it when you are unzipping?<br>Just look at her turned on lewd face.</br>  Anime-only friend here, so how pure are the girls in the manga?

I'll settle for an episode if there's no chapter.</br>  <br><br>they come out every friday I've heard. so hopefully tomorrow</br></br>  <br>17 hours until the next one airs.</br>  <br><br><br>Im going to be disappointed if he doesnt patch things with klutz-yaoi-chan</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Cool, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>He has to.

Just curious, what do you guys think of the anime? I was aware of the manga, but after seeing the first ep I went ahead and read it and bought vol 1 (I like collecting stuff I really enjoy). I see a lot of hate for the anime but I was just wondering  <br><br>They're dead for all intents and purposes now, and we have the Koreans to jerry-rig a translation as soon as the K RAWs come out.</br></br>  <br> not wanting Gakuto to have true harem end <br> joe part of his harem along with Klutz-chan <br><br>If Andre goes back to Vice prez i'll be sad. He works well with crazy bitch, but I can feel in my bones they will put some more forced (but funny) drama there. Be funny if each guy ended up with 2+ harem end.</br></br></br></br>  Post yfw Meiko returns to her former self.  <br> it happens through a sudden love for one of the boys </br>  <br> for andre <br><br>I know its coming<br><br><br><br>not really looking forwards to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this a troll?</br>  <br>Yes, and you did a poor job of ignoring it.</br>  Just to remind you there is no chapter tomorrow. But the episode will be dela--- kidding. It won't  <br><br>Butchered by censorship. It will be decent once the BRs come out, but nothing much beyond that. It's pretty faithful though, and the voice acting is good.</br></br>  <br>That wouldnt even make sense. Shes never had interest in anyone. Her trigger is mari.</br>  <br>It'll be Andre. Just accept it Anon.</br>  <br>Don't forget to use Commie.</br>  <br><br>Anything that breaks the Hymen takes a woman's Virginity.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect? I don't even know why I like her so much, she's  indeed  a bitch, but her face is so cute.<br><br>I want to  pinch her nose and her cheeks. </br></br>  <br><br>She's a total cunt though. In every sense of the word. And she's a depraved homo.</br></br>  <br>the puffiest</br>  <br>Because Smirkfu.</br>  <br>I somehow like how manipulative and smug she is with the girls, and the depraved homo thing, only makes it better, that chapter was the hottest thing I've ever read.</br>  <br>I was so close to waifu-ing her before she was raped.<br><br>not pure anymore though.</br></br></br>  <br> rape(d) </br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure Kate was on the receiving side for most of it.</br></br>  <br> implying Mari didnt rape the shit out of Kate <br><br>she was a woman so ended up enjoying it, but it was still rape. Marifags like literal rapists.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't see how it counts as rape.</br></br>  <br>yuri is boring and meiko deserves better<br>I don't care if it makes sense, have her end with four eyes shitter or maso-buddha, it's more fun</br></br>  <br>It's not rape if she raped Mari back.</br>  <br> mfw I love sluts <br><br>It's like the missing piece of my heart.<br><br><br>It was consensual rape.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a damn good villain, that's for sure. Still, Kate is too much of a psychopath for me to ever consider her "waifu material".<br>To each their own, I suppose.</br></br>  <br>It is not yuri, it is friendship.</br>  <br>people waifu mari and she's at least on kate's level in cuntery, if not higher, plus a misandrist.<br>people waifu for all kinds of fucked up reasons, don't let it bother you</br></br>  <br><br><br>Kate saying 'no', trying to bite Mari to make her stop, and being forced down for almost the entire thing before giving into it.<br><br>It was clearly rape, with power being the main driving force, and then blackmail. It was pretty fucked up.<br><br> I fap'd to it at least three times that day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, especially when meiko bent over, flaunted her ass and begged mari to spank her</br>  <br> Kate saying 'no' <br><br>So, this means that 99.9% of any hentai doujin has rape on it?</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't spank his bros </br>  <br>thats sort of the point</br>  <br>taking the time to shit talk someone else's crush on a fictional character. pathetic</br>  <br>Kate could have stopped her anytime if she really wanted to.<br>She did not.</br></br>   All of these bro moments with the guys <br><br> I wish I had friends like this. </br></br>  <br>Ah yeah. Censorship kinda ruined a lot of parts. Especially the pissing scene</br>  <br>Well, if she spanked her back, I'd consider it comradeship, but she denied her to torment her more, domme style. That goes beyond the spanking I engage with my friends.</br>  <br>Taylor's amazing legs. Hana double best.<br> I'd let either do anything to me. </br></br>  <br>Because she just is anon</br>  <br> 99.9% <br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br><br>Would you want to stop if the woman you've been Waifuing for years is fucking you?</br></br>  <br>she was chained to Mari, and Mari was over powering her both physically and psychologically. She tried to stop it multiple times.</br>  <br><br>Part of her wanted it to stop, but she was closeted, and with a woman she'd been lusting over silently for years, so there's no wonder she let it happen.</br></br>    I don't understand the point of did she rape her or not debate.<br>At the end of the day, Kate lusts for her, Mari used her feelings and crushed them and they're both rotten cunts. Rape or not changes nothing in the grand picture.</br>  Vice Prez for sure but I'm only up to Anzu in terms of new females so I don't know if there is any more.<br><br>The delicious body and chest and her no shame in showing off her delicious thong.<br><br><br>HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one that is spot on is Rooney Mara</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and even then only because of the hair/makeup. The others are really a stretch.</br></br>  <br>post this on /co/ for easy shitstorm/trolling</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br><br>is she becoming so lewd that her eyes are going cross-eyed?</br></br>  <br><br> mfw this is revealed to be Kate's sister/mom and she's going to be the new Chairwoman <br><br>it'll keep getting better and better it has too! WE HAVE TO SPIRAL IN DEEPER!!!</br></br></br></br>  so is Joe actually gay, and destined to be some fabulous idol-agent, or just a phase?  <br>Probably just a phase. I think he'll end up with Cake-san  or one of his Ants .</br>   Andrew ends up in a polygamous relationship based on abuse <br><br>Truly Andrenomics is king, what an innovator.</br></br>  <br>The real meaning of Andrenomics is believing he can ever be a good character ashit.</br>   Meiko will NTR Risa   <br>I'm sorry someone needs to be raw SRS BSNS to you and that you can't have fun</br>  <br>been watching the anime is she always an asshole and why is she an asshole?</br>  <br>The piss awakens something in her. <br><br>Soon™.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not an asshole, she just a sexually frustrated/confused teen. She nice to the girls, and doesn't really interact with the boys apart from Kiyoshi, with whom she mellows out after a while.</br></br>  <br>She's a sheltered teen who apparently never had intimate contact with boys. Kiyoshi triggers her "puberty" and ends up maturing alongside her</br>  <br> 2015 <br> not being an ass man <br><br>Leave</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But from what I've seen, she's right. The boys were caught trying to peek at the girls while they were showering. I'm not saying her actions are justified, but the boys were in the wrong from the get go.<br><br>I still think the anime is a good watch, I don't see how anyone can hate something so mindlessly fun as prison school, maybe not AotS, but it's definitely worth watching for the ride.</br></br></br></br>  Do you guys think that the Hiramoto planned on writing the Kiyoshi and Hana relationship the way it turned out?<br><br>I feel that initially she was only meant to be a set-up for jokes, but as she grew more popular, Hiramoto decided on actually developing her as a character.<br><br>Similarily, Chiyo was probably meant to be the cliche love-interest girl, but he seems to have grown bored of her as the story progressed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true.</br>  <br>Hiramoto stated that Hana is his favorite girl, so it's no wonder the story went that way.<br> Too bad he'll make his waifu lose the Kiyoshibowl </br></br>  <br>not before  she loses her virginity with Kiyoshi spoiling it for Chiyo </br>  <br><br>Got source on that? Also, that might be the case now, but it sure didn't feel like that at the start.<br><br>As for her losing, I don't think the manga will go into full romantic drama mode. I don't see any character entering a serious relationship that is not a part of some ploy, or a setup for wacky situations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some other anon posted and quoted an interview link some threads ago, but I don't have them, sorry. He might've been lying too.<br><br>In any case, I don't expect full blownout romance, but some drama is gonna go down, it's inevitable after we got Risa taming Andre and Mari with Kate</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh sure, there's going to be drama, but it will ultimately be for the sake of comedy/erotica. It won't suddenly go into full broken hearts, shattered dreams, depression mode.</br></br>  <br>It has to be planned if he goes back almost 170 chapters to reference the four leaf clover shit. At first you wonder what the fuck is the point of kiyoshi remembering this so suddenly and then it hit me, four leaf clovers have the superstition behind them that the person who finds one will meet their future lover on the same day. The boys found one but it didnt amount to anything. Kiyoshi found one by himself and met hana up close and personal on the same day. This shit goes deep in a comedic way.</br>  <br>I never even fucking thought about that.<br><br>For Chiyo to be the main love interest, Kiyoshi has sure spent more time with everyone but.</br></br></br>  <br>Those chapters made me harder than 90% of h doujins I've read. God damn that was hot, and I'm not even into yuri. Is it because you know the whole backstory that it makes it that good?</br>  <br>I don't recall Kiyoshi finding one</br>  <br>Panels like this are important. Just like nobody realized hanas phone dropped and took a picture of them.</br>  <br>Hana is gathering those clovers for unprivileged kids</br>  <br>He probably found one at the same time he picked up that bird since hes holding it in that tree.</br>  <br>man the art has really improved since then</br>  <br>Thats shingo's hand</br>  <br>Hes trembling and saying ill be killed in response to considering the option of telling chiyo the truth. Thats not shingo.</br>  <br> probably <br>You know he didn't, but I'm sure you noticed Chiyo stalking Kiyoshi to find a way to make sure he isn't a bad guy</br></br>   Before, when Chiyo thought she was fucking the guys  <br>Because in her fucked up world he cant be a bad guy for her assumption of him actually liking sumo. When peoples ideals get put into jeopardy they will tack on any amount of bullshit to reinforce it and make sure that ideal doesnt get shattered.</br>  What should be peeking out anon?  I just binge read the whole manga in these two days.<br><br> mfw the last chapters </br></br>  <br>sex and laughs anon<br><br>fap while you laugh</br></br></br>  <br>Weren't they jap-&gt;kor-&gt;eng without proper scans though? Made it hard to really keep the feeling of good flow.</br>  <br>I tl;dr'd it on tumblr, and she was actually complimenting it. Something about how the scenes were constructed and how the character development of Hana is good.</br>  <br>the boxers she was wearing you dummy.</br>      Kate is straight you retards. She doesn't like Mari that way.    <br>Oh god all the girls in this manga make me diamonds.</br>  I think Hana will win the Kiyoshib Owl. The mangaka clearly puts the most effort into drawing her, particularly her legendary expressions and has given her the most covers. She's clearly his favorite.  <br>Everyone has 2 covers up until now. Hana has 1 more only because it's latest volume. Also Kiyoshi doesn't any feelings for Hana. He only cares about Chiyo. Re-read manga and you will see it.</br>  <br>Fuck, my post is a mess.</br>  <br> and clearly mines </br>  Holy shit man, those fucking hips.  <br>Dont forgot great ass</br>  <br> Piss slut <br><br>Yeah, no.</br></br></br>  DO NOT SEXUALIZE THE HANA  Meiko is my favorite. I know that's a controversial opinion, but it's the truth.<br>I feel like there would be less people that don't like her if she wasn't the one in 90% of sexual scenes.</br>  <br>All girls have their charm points. Mari really grew on me with her bitchy behavior, Ice Queen persona and vulcano hot body.</br>  <br><br>The only thing I don't like about her are her Tits. They don't look natural, or something any human would willingly have. They look like the worst plastic paps turned up to 11, like one of those reality porn stars would have them.</br></br>  <br>Kate has two belly buttons.</br>  <br>she's the only reason I picked up this manga back in 2011</br>  <br>I love her udders and how they keep getting bigger.</br>  My face through the current anime episodes.  <br>I don't know how people can put up with watching this censored.</br>  <br>Less people would hate her if her character design and personality weren't completely fucking retarded. Like how her nipples seem to be on the sides of her body half of the time, or the fact that she's walking around in a private girls' academy with her tits hanging out, high heels and an exposed thong.<br><br>Meiko is nothing more than a joke character, same as Andrei. Both of them are severely disturbed: one has regressed to her childhood due to trauma, and the other has become a feral beast, and no one even considers giving them medical attention, because it's all a gag.<br><br>I wouldn't even call any scene with Meiko in it sexual. It's too over the top and always played just for laughs, like Armstrong in FMA was for men, unlike Kate's or Hana's scenes. She also lacks any sort of believable reaction no matter what happens, especially for a virgin 16(?) years old who is part of a misandrist club. Unless Mari talks to her and then she starts sweating like a cartoon character.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why in the fuck is the 185 raw still not up?  <br>Can't you just read it in English?</br>  <br>Makes me think, I just can't imagine her taking class with her usual ouftit.</br>  <br>always an asshole, due to being a confused teen. unfortunately, that doesn't excuse her being an asshole</br>  <br>That sure is a lot of words to say the same thing.</br>  <br><br>Is that from some Ergo proxy manga?</br></br>  <br>Yes. That's the key for a good fap.</br>  <br>Thats not the point. The korean scans have dogshit quality.</br>  Episode in about 3 hours, subs probably not long after.  <br><br>What do you think they'll cover? Gakuto shaving, getting the uniform, the date?</br></br>  <br> Kate's mom <br>soon Kate can call Mari - Oneeeee-sama<br> One-sama, time for morning Uroboros </br></br></br>  <br>They did 8 chapters last time. Wouldnt be surprised if they did it again and ended it when chiyo finds out kiyoshi has her uniform.</br>  <br><br>That's probably the best place to end the ep. They can probably condense everything without skipping anything significant, but I don't remember how many chapters it took to get to that part.</br></br>  <br> Chiyou imouto catching her two onee-san performing morning lesbian intercourse tribadism </br>  <br> Chiyo goes turbo dyke to understand how her two onee-san feel </br>  <br>Erina get out of this thread. You'll have a stroke.</br>  <br>she's done it before, It was not corrected by her misandrist sister, I believe she'll do it again in the future.</br>  Anzu best girl.<br><br> Loses cover as girlfriend by becoming real girlfriend. <br> Gets tortured. <br> Is used as a decoy. <br> Does dumb shit with no questions. <br> Has strong personality. <br> Still gf with shitbag while breaking his balls.  <br><br>Why have you not realize?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's pretty high tier.</br>  <br><br> having such terrible taste in men that you would go out with a scumbag like Shingo <br> gets used and tortured <br> does dumb shit <br><br>Yeah, truly the hallmarks of the best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is she the Mari of SnS? Actually, scratch that, she is way more insufferable than Mari could ever be.</br></br>  <br>Still better than being pissed on.</br>  <br>She's pretty similar to Kate to me.</br>  <br><br>At least Kate seems to be able to have fun and enjoy things. Also, she doesn't have a superiority complex (the opposite actually).</br></br>  will today episode have the zawa zawa part?  <br>the more accomodating and dutiful a girl is, the better she is, especially if she manages to do it without being a moeblob.<br>anzu is pretty high tier, especially considering the rest of the cast</br></br>  <br> gets tortured <br>how does this have an impact on her status as good or shit girl?<br>it's not one of her traits or something she wanted, it's irrelevant to her "ranking"</br></br></br>  <br>it's more that she resists the torture</br>  <br><br>Exactly, it doesn't. The guy originally posted it as an argument for why she is the "best", which makes no sense.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand. it's bad that she resists being tortured?</br>  <br>no, it's good that she does</br>  <br>being tortured in and of itself is irrelevant. risking getting punished by helping the boys -and eventually getting tortured for information- is a very positive trait.</br>  <br>This is literally the next page</br>  <br> Does Mari want to fuck her dad? <br>You will see soon in what Mari is intrested<br><br> Why is Andre such an asshole nigger? <br>You did't already see the apex of his niggerness<br><br> I want to tell the chairman to his face that asses are shit and breasts are the only way to go. <br>This is rude man, mr chairman is totally a bro, a true man among men. I'm a titman too, but i respect assmen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, but the original guy didn't say that. He literally said that because Anzu: a. is willing to date a terrible guy, b. does stupid shit for no reason, and c. gets tortured, she is somehow the best girl.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Though now that he brought it up, I'm sure there are some unresolved issues with her and her dad. I mean, one look at Kiyoshi's ass and she had a fucking memory recall and started fidgeting.<br><br>Kiyoshi confirmed for fixing her relationship with her father with the power of his ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  The longest golden rain of the history. Also, man, if only i was 10 year younger, this manga probably killed me for dehydration.  What is your favorite page, /a/?      <br>It's over.</br>  <br><br>Hana looks good, but her bust is way too big.</br></br>  <br>There's a lot of set up &amp; foreshadowing in the beginning so I'm going to say he planned it.</br>  <br>Hana by far.</br>  What the livestream to the episode everyone uses?  <br>she has a penis &amp; penetrated her anus?

She's only about an A in the manga.</br></br>  <br>Kiyoshi didn't lie.<br>He never actually peeked, he was just inside of the girls bathroom but he was always looking down and feeling out of place.</br></br>  <br><br>Chiyo trying to be a slut just to be like big sis made me hate her character even more</br></br>    <br>that shit was hysterical</br>  <br>She did it to understand what being a slut us like, not to be just Mari.</br>  <br> being a slut is like <br> not to be just Mari <br>What's the difference?<br>How ARE they different?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hana going crazy from kiss</br>  <br>yes, but made me dislike her character, not that she had one to begin with</br>  Zuikaku kai ni soon  Asashio Kai Ni never    They already released the patch notes for today's maint and there is no turkey kai 2.

It's just that you don't get Black Lagoon- or Jormungand-like anime every season.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Prisma Illya.</br></br></br>  <br>Overlord<br>Gakkou Gurashi</br></br>  <br>To LOVE-ru Darkness is super interesting.</br>  <br>The defense has no more questions.</br>    Gangsta.  :&gt;  <br>Sore ga Seiyuu. Seriously. The ED is what I'm mostly looking forward.</br>  <br>Gangsta.</br>  <br><br>Autism: the ANIMATION</br></br>  <br>We have dope music too :&gt;</br>  I just want to cuddle with Haruka.  <br><br>Are you Chihaya?</br></br>    <br>No. Just someone with Haruka as their waifu.</br>  <br><br>You're not allowed to have lesbian waifus, anon.</br></br>  <br>That hasn't stopped literally all of /u/. I love Haruka. That is the end of that.</br>  <br>Shimoneta is definitely /a/ aots</br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi and Prison School.</br>  Jitsuwata, but only because I prefer marathoning shows so everything that I think I would like the most I'm saving for when 10+ eps have come out.  <br>Just look for stuff with ball touching.</br>  Wakaba Girl<br><br><br>The song they sing is barely even 10 seconds song. I mean, if it was a complete cover every episode I could understand, but you don't enjoy it THAT much, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Shimoneta, easily.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128835829   <br>I'd say Wakako-zake and Gangsta</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128835829 <br> neo-/a/ <br>Get out.</br></br>  <br>My nigga. First episode is a bit boring, but after that, it's better.<br><br>Not the one you quoted, but the ED (besides the cover song) is catchy, I love it.</br></br></br>  Ushio and Tora, or Wakako-zake   Gintama Degree   Ore Monogatari<br><br>How the fuck am I the only one to post this? Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>ore monogatari or baby steps 2</br>  <br>two-cour shows are counted in the season they began<br>Ore Monogatari was last season.</br></br>   Looking forward to every week <br>Prism Illya, Jitsu wa, MonMusu, NNB, Shimoneta<br> Watching because why the fuck not <br>Gakko, Himouto, Okusama, Sore ga, Wakaba<br> Watching because Rory and Albedo <br>Gate and Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> pin pon </br>  Probably Rin-ne since it's the only currently airing show I'm watching. The other stuff I'm watching through these days is Sidonia S2, Non Non Biyori S1, Crest of the Stars, the original Macross, and  Star Trek: The Next Generation   Gate or Charlotte. I love Gate because modern military is not jobbing for once and I like the setting, Charlotte is not that good right now but I expect it to get a lot better soon.  <br>naruto</br>  I've been watching Prisma Illya, and I've had a good time watching Working!!! God Eater caught my attention recently, and there's always a thread up on /a/ keeping up with Gatchaman Crowds with me, but for my money, I'm picking  Naruto .  <br>Why does Haruka's smile always cheer me up?</br>  <br><br>Haruka suffering &gt; Haruka smile.</br></br>  <br>Hajime is the less autistic character in the whole japanime.</br>  <br>If for this whole year, Shirobako. If for this season, I guess To Love-Ru Darkness 2nd.</br>  <br>Definitely Working!!! Despite the complaints of some anons, this season is very solid overall, but Working!!! is its unquestionable highlight for me.</br>  <br> anime called Working <br> they do no work <br><br>Yeah I dropped it alright.</br></br></br></br>  Gintama of course  Priya  I was watching Shinometa in case they revealed what the 4th mouth of women is, but last ep had nice development so I'm looking forward to it  The king of Slice of life.  <br> I'd actually say that it's "non generic, generic" because a lot of shows similar"ish" to it are popping up. <br>This sentence has to be the single most retarded thing I've read all day. Congratulations.</br></br>  <br>I want to mess up Ren-chong's insides.</br>  Working!!! by far.  <br>I've watched the first season of this anime until episode 9. Holy shit, this anime is really gold.</br>  Either Charlotte or Himouto.  <br>Symphogeah and Joukamachi no Dandelion(very surprisingly).</br>  <br> Hibiki will never be your husband </br>  <br> Symphogeah <br>Why are you looking forwards to Hibiki being a whiny bitch for 23 minutes?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is kill, the only one who will be whining next episode is Garie when the rest of the team pushes her shit in.</br>  <br>Because I don't have the attention span of a goldfish.</br>  <br>Kamen Rider Drive</br>  <br>This entire post is full of shit. You are full of shit.</br>  <br>Rokka, Charlotte and Classroom Crisis</br>    1. Symphogear<br>2. Sore ga Seiyuu<br>3. Akagami</br></br>  <br>Is that still going? I honestly couldn't be bothered after episode what, 8 or something.<br>It got stale really quickly.</br></br>  <br>Kangoku Gakuen.</br>  Crayon Shin-chan.  <br>It's the anime that I never knew I always wanted to watch</br>  Arslan Senki number one  Monster Musume + Overlord<br><br>Tuesday's are good.</br></br>  I don't know<br>I guess it's a tie between NNB and working<br>but then I also really look forward to jitsu wa watashi wa<br>but then there's also umaru-chan<br>and prison school is pretty good too<br>and shimoneta<br>monster musume is okay too<br>I don't know it's a pretty good season<br>I'll tell you what it's not though, charelotte, that's shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Non Non Biyori Repeat, by far.  Overlord.  Non Non Biyori and Gate, I guess.<br><br>I really liked Working in its first season but I can't stand it anymore.</br></br>  By this definition it's Ninja Slayer. It is also last season's AOTS.  Symphogear GX<br><br>I wish Hibiki gets better already</br></br>  Gatcha / Ranpo / Arslan / Gangsta / Rokka<br><br>Though that's because I am familiar with the plot for Ushio and DBS, otherwise they have to be included in the list above as well.</br></br>  Non non biyori, what else could even try to top it ?  Gurashis, Kurumi is truly a miracle of the universe.<br>Timeline is fucked tho, but I don't really care as long as we get more shovel screentime.</br>  <br>Worst taste IIT.</br>  Joukamachi no Dandelion.  thats dumb because there are always ups and downs.<br><br>Right now its Working!!! because its finally got some development.</br></br>  <br>Either NNB, Sore ga Seiyuu, or Monster Musume. It's too early to figure out which one will pull ahead.</br>  It's obviously Non Non Biyori.  <br>More JoJo</br>  <br>Symphogear and Gatchaman.</br>  Sore ga Seiyuu is the show I forward to the most because I'm always hyped to see which real life seiyuu will get a cameo and to hear the song that they sing during the ending. <br><br>The objective AOTS is  Charlotte </br></br>  <br> declaring AOTS of a season that is yet to air </br>  <br>This, it's cute as fuck</br>  <br>Because it's shit. "SUKI DA" can only be funny for so long</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori and Symphogear.</br>  Shokugeki no Souma. Also Ore Monogatari is a guilty pleasure.<br><br>And I don't get why Gangsta is hated that much here.</br></br>  <br>"Suki da" isn't supposed to be funny, if you can't relate to what Takeo thinks in his head all the time you must've been alone your whole life.</br>  Overlord is the one and only correct answer.  <br>Gin to Kin</br>  Prison School.  Overlord.  <br><br>My niggas</br></br>  GATE.  <br> Im@s  and NNB.</br>  Literally no show has piqued my interest this season. I'm using it as a chance to finish my backlog.  Wakaba<br>NNB<br>Symphogear<br>In that order.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that would be Dragon Ball Super, but I don't really think that is my AOTS, another ones would be Mon Mus and GATE, but I think I go for GATE for AOTS.<br>This year AOTY is already settle anyways, only surprise is going to be OPM on fall, but if it not deliver, AOTY going to be Etotama or Kekkai Sensen.</br></br>  Working. S3 has been so hype despite me being spoiled on it for years.<br>If only new shows count, Gangsta. It was Charlotte, but the quality's been dropping.</br>  <br> backlog <br> finish </br></br>  <br> Honestly, I'm not interested in anything this season. I'm just waiting for the next season of jojo to be announced. I honestly feel like the walking dead here.  </br>  Gangsta.  <br>It picks up a lot when Takeo meets another girl that has a crush on him. But I agree, it can boring pretty fast if you want variety</br>  your mom  <br>It's not like I don't enjoy any of the shows this season but I don't really look forward to anything. I just watch whatever airs each day.</br>  Best action scenes.

Event ticket. DVDs from extended. <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA BIGGEST FLOP OF THE YEAR. DON'T EVEN THINK ROKKA NO FLOP WILL BEAT IT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably not. Just think of the anime as a prologue of sorts, the game is long and features the next Yuta with more time looping, possession, soul swapping, superhumans and panties.</br>  <br> alternate timelines. <br> people not who they think they are. <br> using info from one timeline to do something in another. <br> saving someone in the past from the present. <br> robot girl. <br>He's a one trick pony if I've ever seen one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair those who worked in KID write the same stuff. Haven't got into ZE yet but after playing Sci;Adv games and I/O that's the impression I get but not really as mindbending as his. At least these hacks are better the predictable as fuck Maeda, I don't really get why that guy receives a lot of praise.

Why do they have hearing that can discern locations with that much accuracy as you're assuming as well? Gunshots echo. The zombies could easily scatter because they don't properly know where the shot is coming from.<br>If you want to be a retard sticking out in the open instead of ducking into a proper hiding place afterwards your death is your own damned fault.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanity was a poor choice of words. I meant her defence<br><br>He's right though. They only talk to her when they can establish Yuki is seeing her, outside of a few flashbacks</br></br></br>  <br>Technically, you only see Rii enter the car, Yuki is also magically already in it, with Megu-nee.<br><br>Of course where Megu-nee was hiding herself prior to that is anyone's guess.  The answer is "in Yuki's head". </br></br></br>  <br>I see it</br></blockquote>]
