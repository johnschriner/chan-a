[ Oh gosh   Wowzers   oh my   What ever happened with KKK?   Has it catch a hellfire yet?    Botan not with Sakura  This is not okay.     Judging from these post times, no.    What is this show about    Like any other good square enix comic, they cancel it right after the anime airs.    It's video game and manga references combined with references to Japanese things that will go completely over your head in some episodes.    10 posts  Holy shit. It finally caught fire, guys.    mention the 3 episode rule     on the 4th episode  KKK was ahead of its time.     It's been two years since the anime aired and it was discontinued. Unlike a certain other manga.   I saw the first episode of this a few months back but I didn't quite get what was it about.   Its better you stop there, the whole thing was excruciatingly boring Imagine a slice of life wacky high school club anime, but remove all the things that make it good and replace it with 70% talking about stuff you dont care about 25% unfunny fourth wall jokes and only 5% funny stuff that all happen near the end i suppose it wasnt as bad as watamote however, and it also had good op and ed themes       It looks so shit, I can't believe why they took it in the first place.    Wait, so it got canceled? I didn't need to know this. Time to commit suicide.    It's one of those series where the anime adaptation just wasn't quite as good as source material. Like Re-kan from this season. Mind you, I'm not saying the manga is phenomenal, but it's decent and some other studios/staff might have been able to handle it better.    KKK thread   Holy shit, it's been a while.    Dead thread.   what the   who did this     Botan's pass is still my favorite part  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=46G<wbr>ZrMq18LU</wbr>  [ ]    Keeping the fire alive for another hour. RIP   SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING  We can't let the fire die, who knows what will happen?!    Face it anon, only Tesabu caught fire. KKK is pretty much kill.    Make your own tsukkomi  Man this show was awesome.  Oh look, the annual KKK thread, as energetic as always I see.  Hey /a/ - what is this pic from and what is the characters name?    summer isn't real      Boku no Pico.    boku no edgy vampire  googleman from legend of blue wolves   I'd knew thered be incest basement dwellers all over /a/, worth a shot.   Anyone asking, daddy's NOT coming home.   Should've used that shot to kill yourself, fucking faggot.    Alucard from Hellsing, specifically Hellsing: OVA I really appreciate the artists work, I find the colors and way he draws to really set the mood and give the show character.    Latest chapter made me feel for Odagiri   Hope she wins the Yamadab owl   When is P.A. Works going to make their next masterpiece?  In 2 years.  What is /a/'s general consensus on P.A. Works?  I think they are pretty good when it comes to slice of life genre (minus Glasslip). They tend to stumble when they try different genres (Another, Canaan).     I mostly just love their artstyle, especially those backgrounds, man.    i would prefer to learn more about directors than about studios, but alas I'm too lazy for that sort of thing. P.A. stuff is usually worth a look though.     Amazing background, comfy show. Not my favorite studio, but a good one.    Are Miuna mondays still going or did those fags finally give up?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RQp<wbr>OIrg_uvA</wbr>  [ ] Soon    Third Aerial Girls Squad when ?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8X_<wbr>L0Ce2crM</wbr>  [ ]    Glasslip 2: Even Glasslippier   Is such a thing even possible ?  Also, initial D remake. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9y6<wbr>fTTZBJ60</wbr>  [ ]       Glasslip 2: Electric Cockadoodledoo     +Glasslip movie tetralogy.  I would actually watch 'em.       Next season    That looks so shit   When Masayuki Yoshihara directs another series there. Out of the directors that have worked there, he's put out the best work by far.   What did he make? Uchouten Kazoku?   Glasslip was 3deep5you   Yeah.     More like 2shit4me.     Uchouten Kazoku reminds me that there aren't enough interesting female antagonists lately.   They can't even spell Angel Beats right, not sure I can trust them to save anime.  They're already making it.    almost as many boys as girls  How is that supposed to be good?     Too spooky.    Hopefully Haruchika. Which is Hyouka x Euphonium x full double gay no bait.  Next season they are whoring themselves to Key, resulting in huge respect loss for the studio, but not all is bad. Hopefully they`ll recover from shit smearing on own face which is making Key-shit and do something original with Okada again or adapt good stuff in future.       Keyshit  kill yourself    RDG season 2, please   Didn't you watch Angle Beats? It was AOTS     Haruchika  Isn't that g...gay?     Haruchika seems really based.   Everyone seems to love Angel Beats, but I can't help but feel it's based on what it should have been more than what it actually was. It needed about 4 more episodes to tie up loose ends. Without those, the character development was incomplete and the pacing was erratic. It was decent, but loses major points for that and the derp explanation for the world.   You're just butthurt that Angel Beats outsold your hipster taste, are you not?     Everyone seems to love Angel Beats  you arent at MAL here, and you belong there thinking someone in sane mind likes AB or that it could be any good if they fixed stuff     The only good thing about AB is music, since Maeda is better composer than he is writer.  For Charlotte he does not even do that, so theres no chances for it to be any decent.       Charlotte he does not even do that  Do you have any proof backing up what you say, or are you just making stuff up now?     I really like Uchouten, NnA and Hanasaku Iroha Shirobako is god tier, definitely in my top 10  Angel Beats is overrated trash Glasslip is so bad it's hilarious        What's so bad about Glasslip?     Which is Hyouka x Euphonium x full double gay no bait.  Except Hyouka and Euphonium both had great directors working on them. HaruChika does not. It's gonna be mediocre at best.

Dies anyone actually care about Kirio?                          Just want to say I'm digging Ushio's attire.                           Braid Mayuko is cute      True    Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Who said Historiafags hate Ymir? Are you retarded?    That's not Ymir's liquid. The titan is not part of Ymir's body (since it is obviously male and we 4channers believe that gender is biological and not an identity thing).    like gordon ramsey?    Even the females?   The 104th are a bunch of 15 yr olds, they can only grow baby beards and shit.       Because that seems to be what some think here the moment you say you're a Historiafag who likes YH or Ymir.   How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127111408">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.         Spoilers tonight chaps?  Also, Iida is fucked.    I'm more interested on what happen with Slain and facepalm guy, it seem like they were getting ready to throw down. This manga haven't had a good villain vs villain action yet so I'll be interested in that. Maybe that how Iida will find Slain.  Steins;Gate Zero coming November 19th.  http://gematsu.com/2015/06/steinsga<wbr>te-0-japanese-release-date-set</wbr>      HYPE   American localization never, right?           Has a better chance than any of the other Science Adventure titles without someone literally bringing a translated script to a localization company.    Well, there goes another 10000 yen to limited edition. Just paid for the C;C.   Same. Won't bother with zero though since its a spin off. Maybe if it has a neat limited    That scene looks like it's from the murrican lab, did they add the omake manga to it too. Looks like it.    Maho would've wear lab coat too if its from the murrican lab. It's probably for this part.     In that case then I'm really disappointed that they're just using a Kurisu standing sprite for her Amadeus talking.   Dual when? End of June happening when?  Who uncontrollable HYPE here?       Steins;Gate Zero is a direct sequel though like Chaos;Child, not like Hiyoku Renri no Darling or Phenogram.     Oh yeah I know, I dig the epigraph trilogy as well. Just since it's not a continuation of main series world line, I'm less motivated to buy it.    Zero is not a direct sequel. It's a side story that ties into the main plot, not a continuation.     No, there are neuro scans in the background, it's probably a flashback.    Okabe looks terrible boring in Eternal Return.    Then why is Maho wearing the discount clothes she got in Akihabara?    Because he's a normalfag now.    More like expansion pack, but I suppose it's actually canon this time.  Bad news is that we haven't seen any signs of new material yet.     Why does Kurisu wear the same sweaty pantyhose all the time?    I prefer that look.    Huke being lazy again.     Ah. I thought you meant something like that. That's fine then. I'm sticking with it just because of my love for Steins;Gate and the need for more great character interaction.  Replaying the VN has renewed that love once more. The way everyone deals with Okabe's chuuni shit is too good.    Seems more promising than the movie, at least.           you have the worst taste then    I'm a little tired of S;G now after all the spin off stuff, glad with the route the're going with zero though. More excited to see what's next after C;C    I love Okabe's and Kurisu's banter.    You won't be seeing much of that in Zero considering she's dead. Maho's got the spotlight.   Recently finished C;H and feeling a bit lukewarm towards it. It doesn't really explain much of the backstory relations to how it fits in with the 300, does it? Should I be looking at C;C from here?   Did you read through all the ends? It explained it pretty decently.    Noah has a lot of 300 stuff, B route of C;H has a bit of 300. Wait for Noah announcement that's happening soon. Read/experience in order of release.      From what I understood, the only difference between the A and AA endings were that in one Taku lives. B ending talks about the NewGen murders, though I haven't done it myself yet due to a lack of interest as there's a number of questions C;H can't seem to answer.      not liking his new look    implying we'll even get his new look in VN      Such as? Most the information you need is there.    How did you not understand how it related to the 300? The Committee had the Silent Weaponry and the cult guy and the political guy defected from them to work with Norose and use it for their own ends. But that's what the Committee wanted and expected them to do in the first place and they were used to gather data via the Earthquake. This was all explained in the VN.    http://a.uguu.se/lellyu.ogg  Tooryanse, Tooryanse      BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP BEEP BOOP     Isn't it fascinating, that a brainwashed woman was humming this in a certain basement in Chaos;Child?  I know the translated lyrics, but why is the 7-5-3 in relation with Project Noah?     ≪Cert Dead≫ - 205/221; 58/100  IT MOVED      It's a game   Not a sequel anime  Why did you waste my time, you flaming faggot?       being this much of a baiting secondary     I think we've got a shot at an English localization -- hopefully sooner rather than later.    It already moved yesterday, so it's very much alive.    It'll come some point maybe. I expect C;H and hopefully the rest of main SciADV first.    Steiner said he predicts R;N first since it can be marketed as a sequel to S;G.     Well for example, if Taku is an incredibly strong gigalomaniac, why wasn't every delusion he was having manifesting itself? He'd been capable of doing it without his Di-Sword at times, so what's the issue?  The fuck happened to Shibuya after the AA ending? Did Taku and Rimi just fix everything up and nothing about Noah II ever got out?  I also didn't quite understand how Shogun found Rimi in the first place, and why Rimi was somehow included in the staking delusion.         Who knows. I'd happily take them in any order. Though I would be insanely salty if they just did all the S;G stuff first.    Well, at least there'll be the anime to tide us over until then.    Takumi could only realboot the delusion with Ayase because  his original was the one doing the realbooting.   Shibuya is in ruins after the earthquake, Taku falls into a Coma, and Love Chuchu happens.  Rimi was having delusion, strong enough to synchronize her delusionary world with Takumi's. She found him, he didn't move a muscle.         Truly, the marketing campaigns will be wonderful.  "Chaos;Head, the prequel to Steins;Gate!" "Robotics;Notes, the sequel to Steins;Gate!" "Chaos;Child, the sequel to the prequel to Steins;Gate!" "Steins;Gate Zero, the actual sequel to Steins;Gate!"          No an awakened gigilomaniac yet. They fix the sky, Shibuya is pretty fucked and you find out about a lot of the mess in C;C Explained in B route, due to delusion synchro.     I'm gonna marry Kurisu!    The fuck happened to Shibuya after the AA ending? Did Taku and Rimi just fix everything up and nothing about Noah II ever got out?  City was still destroyed, Noah II was presumably covered up by the Committee.  I also didn't quite understand how Shogun found Rimi in the first place, and why Rimi was somehow included in the staking delusion.  Shogun could've just just ended up synchronizing with her by chance, and the 2nd part is covered in Noah.       I will swallow my pride and autism if it allows me to play Dual in a language I can comprehend.  Just give me Dual, god, please.     What is likely to occur first -- an English localization of S;G 0 or me becoming fluent enough in Japanese to read it myself?    Rimi being in the staking delusion is completely explained in Noah, not in the B ending. Rimi says who were in the delusion when she explains to Taku who he really is.       "Anonymous;Code, not related to Steins;Gate!"     Becoming fluent enough.    Fuck.  Guess I better get started.      I don't mind A;C not being main line since it's artstyle is quite shit, but O;N looked pretty neat.   adaptation when?   Chaos;Child this fall, Steins;Gate 0 in Spring next year.      Nono is a good girl.    Not if I do it first.   At least we have the adaptation to look forward to. Even if the VN takes years, we'll have most of the content relatively soon.        I don't mind Anonymous;Code's artstyle, but Occultic;Nine's is definitely cool. The PV especially is pretty awesome.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=879<wbr>YvJPVecs</wbr>  [ ]  Makes me want an anime with a similarly well-constructed opening.         Yes, pretty NEAT indeed.     Adapted by Shaft     Spooky suffering for everyone.    Okabe designs: Epigraph and original Pandora &gt; new Pandora &gt; Zero Huke &gt; original Huke     I think they've actually started to improve their English in those chuunibyou paragraphs. It's still stilted and awkward, but at least it's understandable now.   Why is visual novel Mayuri so much cuter than anime Mayuri?   Why is anime Kurisu so much cuter than visual novel Kurisu?     Because of Asami Imai, I think they made Mayuri less spacey in the anime, they toned it down a lot compared to how she is in the VN.      implying     Well, technically it IS a sequel to Steins;Gate.  Hell, I'd be glad if it got marketed this way because I'm tired of people who don't understand jackshit about how the SciADV series connects arguing about it. Would let me go "here, see? Says Robotics;Notes is a sequel to Steins;Gate right on the box."       people who don't understand jackshit about how the SciADV series connects arguing about it  When and how did this happen? I've only ever seen people be confused about it, then have it cleared up by someone else.      Box.jpg     New music themes when?     So, are they going to be less relevant for Zero?  I hope Luka will be.      spoiler    Time for that S;G dump I said I'd do last thread but ended not being able to.   New Pandora chapter never        I love her bomber jacket.     generic looking Okabe that high  Though it's actually quite refreshing to see Okabe without his lab coat  and new haircut  once in a while.       Is that the one with Kayano?    trying to learn Japanese so I don't have to wait forever to read S;G 0   start with Hiragana   shit's fucked   God damn it, it's the same fucking deal with Arabic -- but at least the Arabs don't have fucking Kanji.             Learning Arabic  For what purpose, is there Arabic cartoons, VNs and manga?             Hiragana and Katakana are the easy part, since that's just simple memorization. Grammar and Kanji are the real meat of the language.     I took a few Arabic classes in my senior year of high school for college credit and since I wanted to learn a third language. I don't remember a single thing other than the fact that it was suffering.   Hence why I'm psyched out       Japanese grammar is a joke compared to other languages' grammar. It's not that difficult if all you want to do is read Japanese material. Now, if you want to read Latin texts, that's another story.      The only hard part is kanji. Speaking Japanese is easy.     Roman grammar   hard  U wot m8? Roman grammar one of the easiest.        Are you high? I'm talking about Grammar, not Orthography.  6 different cases, 5 different declensions, each declension has 3 genders, 6 tenses, different forms for subjunctives, irregular pronouns, and that's just off the top of my head.  It's much easier to learn the particles in Japanese, than to learn each case, their usage, how to form them and the pronouns.  Fucking Hic, haec, hoc, is, ea, id, ipse, ipsa, ipsum and so on.           But the grammar is very uniform and has very little exceptions to its own rules. Plus, out of all those different cases and tenses, most are used sparingly to the point that if you just want to understand bare basics of a text, you prolly only need to know two of each.  Try learning any other minor language from ancient Europe, like Galician-Asturian, which have completely unorganised grammar systems and then proceed to break those system more often than conforming to them, and you'll see how simple Roman grammar is.  Hell, I'd say that in some way, Germanic grammar is even more complicated than Roman.         Now that the dust has settled, can we all agree that the Steins;Gate anime was a masterpiece?  I was really disappointed to see you all "turn on it" like typical hipsters after it ended.       Yes, it was. If the plebs here knew anything about proper film making, they'd know that it did everything perfectly given the parameters it had.         Rather slow but I think the VN handles things better, characters, situations and such, still very good series though.     Compared to original VN it wasn't.      Who is that girl on right?      A magical girl.   HAPPENING  https://twitter.com/5pbgamesUSA/sta<wbr>tus/613420318762254336</wbr>       I loved the show, but I liked the VN a little more.    Oh fuck please.      Wait, 5pb. has an American branch? Why aren't they localising all S;G shit at least?     5pb. Games USA   W-what?        The branch is new and there weren't sure up until recently how well it would sell.     Germanic grammar  German is easier than Latin, well I'm native German, so I'm biased to it, but still the rules are easier to understand than Latin, and the forms are easier to get.     Could this be  one of the reasons  why they're going to AX?    Finnish isn't a language, it's a meme.    I cant figure out what's going on here    In think it's a very liberal interpretation of the opening scene ton Dr Jekyll on Lines.        To this day my favorite doujin is of Okabe snapping and raping Suzuha.  That's the only acceptable rape doujin of Steins;Gate.      All languages are memes.   It's an arousing scenario, but badly drawn.        Woah, now this is exciting. I was kind of expecting maybe a 2016 localization, but it seems pretty confirmed now.  Hopefully.      Hell yeah  Get fucked Zakobot     Lately I haven't been following the news. Indulge me, anon, what's the story with PQube releasing other SciADVs in English?   Dual coming to West.  That's what we are deluding ourselves into.   In all honesty, Noah will probably come some time soon.      Anime when?   Steiner and Blick Winkel are confirmed to be working on a translation of Noah together.   Steiner is confirmed to be working with PQube.  PQube have an announcenent to make regarding sciADV in late June/early July.  Many anons think that they're gonna announce an official localisation of Noah. Some anons think they're gonna announce Dual (a double package containg both Noah and Love Chu Chu).  5pb. have recently opened an American branch, which is showing interest in localising Steins;Gate Zero, and will be attending AX this year.  Everyone is hype.              Chaos;Child this fall, Steins;Gate 0 Spring next year.    Wow. Time to start following the news again.    The show was a superb adaptation and was surprisingly well-paced given its source material. I'm very impressed that the story transitioned as well as it did, and it manages to adhere closely to its source material while still injecting new images into the mix. It's a really great fucking show.    A lot has happened lately. Did you buy the El Psy Kongroo Edition of the PS3/Vita S;G localisation?    I certainly do consider the Steins;Gate anime a masterpiece, it's been almost 4 years since I saw it and it's still among the top for me.    STEINS GATE LOCALIZATION BEST DAY OF MY LIFE   Even though I go on about  muh chapter 9  I agree, it was a good adaption, but ultimately, the VN is way better.       Yes. And I really liked some of the directing choices (uncoloured scene in ep 10(?) and even original to anime additional details, like Mayushii's watch (Wasn't in VN IIRC). Or the recurring scene where boy plays with the toy train imagining it as Shinkansen. Mother tells him that he's wrong and that Shinkansens are white while Okabe in white lab coat running in the background.  But it still is way more inferior to the VN and not even so good on it's own. Solely because there were quite a few bad episodes (First two, Farys and Ruka's episodes and so on). It was still okay, but by no means a masterpiece.    Too many things are converging at the same time. S;G0 confirmed as the secret project.    If SG is the secret project... then why did you post Ban?   Dual confirmed.      If Dual is confirmed, then why did he post Ban? He isn't in Love Chuchu.      Love Chu Chu Tsu: Ban Edition?     I also liked the bit in episode 22 where Okabe talks about watching Mayuri die again and again and how it cuts to the shot of the water falling from the faucet -- or when Kurisu talks about existing in multiple parallel worlds despite being a single entity and it cuts to the shot of the telephone lines running side by side.  As for the Feris and Ruka episodes, I think that the problem was that those two were condensed into a single episode when they probably deserved two episodes a piece like Moeka.   To be honest, I don't really mind the changes to chapter 9 in the anime. Braun's suicide was still done very well -- especially with the hard cut as Okabe begins to scream.         Nah, the timing fits perfectly. 5pb. had probably started the project over a year ago.    Jackpot trips confirm S;G0    No, I don't have a console.    I loathe the change in chapter 9, it devalues the adaption for me significantly.  Nah, it's Noah.  If we won't get Noah now, we will never get it.        Wasn't there a similar sounding tune in Robotic;Notes as well?    Kagome, Kagome. That's the one in R;N.     It was all smoke and mirrors.    That's cool, but when is R;N dropping, C;C dropping, chuchu dropping?    Before we get Chuchu, I'd like to have Noah.    That's totally happening though    It still has to "drop".     chuchu dropping     Anon, you should stop hoping on chuchu, it'll just feel shitty when it's not announced alongside C;H    Well, Noah and Zero are gonna be console only, so...      Chuchu is console only too.    I'm just hoping for an uncensored version of Noah, at least. Chu Chu would be the cherry on top.    I can't wait for it. The day of the announcement I will flip out like a teenage girl, that was looked at by a super star.     Uh oh.    Why uh oh Steiner?      This is technically shitposting, isn't it?    So when are they going to rename this to Cash;Grab?  They keep making spinoffs and side material and ignoring everything else on the series. The movie gave it a nice ending, now let it rest in peace.      Because S;G &gt; all other SciAdv     The movie gave it a nice ending  Confirmed for animeonly fag     Beep. Beep. Shit taste detected.     Chaos;* &gt; Steins;Gate &gt; Robotics;Notes    I played the VN and heard the movie was a continuation of the VN so I gave it a try.  But then you have the LN, the manga, the other manga, the spinoff, that other spinoff and now ANOTHER one with this zero thing. I cant bring myself to give a single fuck about another attempt to milk steins;gate's success, I want to see the other entries in the series get translated and brought over.  Stuff like C;H's fandisc, Chaos;Child, Robotics;notes and others instead of MORE steins;gate.         C;H's fandisc  You mean, like the canon sequel that is important to the great picture?  Calling it a "fandisk" is an understatement to what it is.      https://twitter.com/DistantValhalla<wbr>/status/613452085082890240</wbr>  WHAT IS HAPPENING?   VNDB lists it as a fandisc so I was using their classification, if its a sequel then that's even better because it means more content and plot.     IT'S; HAPPENING  Yes, it's a canon sequel, that is important for details in the plot of Chaos;Child.         PANIC     Can't wait for this to turn into disappointment after Anime Expo.   Pls no.    After Mekaku Shitty Actors? no thanks   <br/>    I am swearing off a studio because they couldn't give two shits about an anime-original that nobody gives any shit about     Don't worry, this could be their final attempt to milk S;G success.  But not until Gamma VN. HAHAHA     What Steiner was planning on doing Zero with PQube, but now 5pb. USA are showing interest in it, he has to contact them to clear the situation up?     Hope you guy's are ready for shit outsourcing and bad localisations. I'm assuming Steiner isn't a part of this      Oh, that's entirely plausible and would explain a lot.     I don't think this is it. Might have to wait for response of him though.     STEINER, SAVE US   Game Over Man, Game Over. I can only think of two possible explanations and they are both kinda hilarious. S;G is getting too popular that much is clear.     What are the possibilities?     Now would be a alright time to go anon and hint shit Steiner.   I love how quickly SciADV fans come screaming that the C;H fandisc is a sequel and that the Steins;Gate sequel is a spin-off. No respect for official labels around these parts.    Daydream is the name of Nanami's End in Noah. Steiner got a book yesterday that had all their names in English.    Aw shit, I didn't know. Did I just accidentally post spoilers?    Because objectively speaking, Zero is not a sequel in any shape or form. At best it's a "kind of interquel" that takes place between two points in the original VN. And yes, while Love Chu Chu is a fandisc, it is also a sequel to Chaos;Head Noah.   Nah, that's not really spoilery. I can post the names of the other ends as well if you're interested.   I got nothin'.           The Steins;Gate "sequel" is an interquel, it's not a sequel, it doesn't directly continue after the true end.  Love Chuchu directly continues after the True End of Chaos;Head Noah.      One's a continuation that adds to the main worldline, the other is based in another worldine that at best expands on characters we already know loads about.    Crying Sku best ending.    Love Chuchu is still a fandisc even if it's a sequel  It's not rare. F/HA is a fandisc and a sequel as well.       PQube get Steiner to do none   Noah[/spoiler  5bpUSA get   Zako  to do S;G shit How salty would you be?       Both are already posted here. In any case, those who are waiting for localization may be fucked.    I'd probably kill myself.     F/HA is a fandisc and a sequel as well.  F/HA doesn't continue after any of the ends, so it's not a sequel.     Please post the other ending names.   Currently watching Steins:Gate   This is a very bad time to enter a sciADV thread as a newbie.    Blue Sky (True) Silent Sky (A) Crying Sky (B)    Anima Image (Rimi) Daydream (Nanami) The Blood of Covenant for Our Sins (Ayase) Deus Ex Machina (Sena) Sickness unto Slaughter (Kozue) The Moon and The Sun (Yua)               So, what 'book' had the English names for the endings?    I'm not saying he isn't being stupid but Mekakucity Actors wasn't an anime-original, it was part of a highly successful franchise that by all means would've sold tens of thousands of copies if they hadn't dropped the ball so hard with it.    It was on a flowchart in the Chaos;Head x Steins;Gate Maniacs book. I hadn't taken a proper look at the guide segment until yesterday. Not all of the names were in English though, Sena's was in Katakana for example.    MAYURI DIES   I've not bothered with this series since the ending of the anime. Is there more story that didn't get into the animated series in the manga and if so is it worth reading?    by all means  It was just chuuni-shit with nico backing. It wasn't a surprise it bombed.     I've been meaning to get my hands on that at some point. Anything neat in it?    Yes, it isn't surprising that the anime of one of the best selling Light Novel series out there, based on what's probably the most popular vocaloid music series, bombed. Not at all.  I mean, like you said, it's just chuuni-shit, and chuuni-shit simply doesn't sell. Just look at the Fate series, a complete flop, right?      Can you take a pic of the flowchart?     SLAM DUNKED.     Yeah it's a really cool book. It has the official afterstory in it, as well as a handwritten letter from Kurisu to Okabe. It's full of creator interviews, cast commentary, character profiles. Route summaries, annotated maps of Shibuya and Akihabara, a full timeline, art samples, guides to merchandise and a list of side material. Flowcharts, a guest art corner, mental profiling for each character and so on. Overall it's about 260 pages long, it's well worth the purchase.   I would but I don't have a camera at present.          Yes because it tried to cater to everyone and have everything it "can" and has little character of its own. Believe me, I want to like it. Stylized chunni-shit are some of my favs. But Kagerou/Mekaku is just lacking.    So that's where this is from.   This is very much my fetish.   Has anyone actually translated that letter? I keep seeing that thing floating around but no English translation.    I think some of that, like the character profiles, Akihabara map, and timeline made it into the S;G fanbook that came with JAST's limited edition.    I'll pick it up sometime. I really should get back into learning jap so I can read all my sciadv shit   I don't care, C;C fucking where?   No, it ties into the afterstory so I'll get around to it.  I have started to translate the afterstory for the last three Christmases but I always stop a few pages in because things come up. Maybe this December.     Some of it did, I think. Yeah.         Kozue ending  It's so fitting it hurts.      Darth Spider  Ah, the suppressed memories are coming back.     Or right now Steiner.    Is that C.C's straitjacket I spy?    It's not really about whether you liked it or not, and I'm not some Kagerou fan if you think what I'm doing here is "defending" the franchise.  Kagerou Daze was the third best selling light novel of 2014, above Oregairu and Monogatari. It used to be the second best selling light novel the year before, but clearly the Mahouka anime did a much better job of boosting its sales than MCA did, as it leaped to first.  If they had played their cards right, Shaft and Aniplex would've had another hit franchise on their hands, this is undeniable when you look at the circumstances. Unfortunately for them, they messed up badly.        I can't translate a story about Christmas in the summertime! Don't be absurd.   Yes, and Mayuri is cosplaying Shirley.       Yep, and Okabe is Zero.   Wait a minute... Steins;Gate Zero is where Okabe truly becomes Zero!        Luka's dad as Old Snake  Anyone find the work Huke did for Metal Gear Solid?    i would buy the living shit out of a Dr.Pepper promotion with Stein's;gate on it tbh   Who's Nae?     Braun as Doraemon  Just why     IIRC even the LN sales went downhill for Kagerou Daze.    A character from the fictional anime "Miko Miko Overdrive".    Can someone list all the cosplays?    I'm assuming it's a magical girl anime.  Will we ever get a SciADV title that is to mahou shoujo as Robotics;Notes is to mecha? I would like it.      I buy the shit out of it anyway. What does that make me?     genderbender  Dropped.     So, that's what they do during their sleepover?  Holy shit, never thought that hair down Suzuha looks so much better.       &gt;genderbender  u wot m8?      genderbender  wut      responding to illiterate shitpost      I am HYPE for more FES.   I can feel the bad endings for S;G 0. Really hope for a single.       That Mayuri looks a lot like ROBOTS.   Give it to me straight /a/, what are the chances of this being good? What are the chances it lives up to the original?   I know the answer just lie to me      So you like talking to yourself. Why do you even post?    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rcj<wbr>pags7JT8</wbr>  [ ]    I'm pretty sure it was based on that.   Where were you when Tuturu died?   Not on /a/ being a pleb since I've read the VN.     muh eliteism   not joining in on the shit posting       shitposting about shows you like   You are the cancer.      Clearly you guys are jumping the gun. Assuming they're even serious, they're just throwing the question out there to gauge interest. Don't get your hopes up.      someone's butthurt    They need to work on the huge backlog of sciadv already out there first.    Why would you join in that?   I just finished playing the VN for this and is @channel supposed to be some parody of 4chan?   You always with the cockblock, man.  At least tell me C;H is happening      Face it, Blick, they're doing a shitty in-house translation of S;G0.  Go contact them before it's too late to avert this tragedy.      It's meant to be a parody of 2chan, Japan's equivalent of 4chan, but half of the 2chan memes were localised to 4chan memes for the English release anyway, so it's kinda both in the English version.     implying 2chan is the same as 2ch     spoiling people, you see it all the time in Jojo threads    What's the difference?      Dual?     Why does Okabe think he should get into a worldline where everything is okay? If everything is okay in that worldline then he should accept that there is a version of himself out there that's able to live without problem.  What gives this Okabe the right to think he should be the one who gets to live in the good timeline?     It's 2 different sites you dipshit. One is an imageboard, for one.    That's not how it works. Only one actually exists at a time.    There is only one world at a time, either all are doomed to Dystopia or WW3 or the mystical Steins Gate, where all is ok.  World lines are POSSIBILITIES, they are not real, only ONE world is real.  For fuck's sake.         So this is a plot hole then.     What? How?    It is not a plothole, if you payed attention to the time travel mechanic, you'd understand it.  Seriously, why don't you guys understand? It's super easy to understand if you're not a brain dead zombie.       You moron, 2ch is just short hand for 2channel, which is a text board.  Futaba Channel is the image board.       Okabe B still remains in the Beta timeline, whereas Okabe A goes into the Steins;Gate timeline.  In the S;G timeline where Kirisu's death is fake since Okabe A didn't time leap into Okabe B, then Okabe B should still be around as a separate entity as in the S;G timeline. So we now have 2 Okabe's around.       And Futaba is the one commonly referred to as "2chan" around here ala moot ripping from Futaba for 4chan, STILL differing from 2ch.    Nope. Physical time travel affects divergence slightly. It's not S;G when he fakes her death, but it is when returns, because he faked her death.    No, you retard. There is only one world, one Okabe, one of everything. World lines are possibilities. If the world line shifts, everything restructures itself, the world itself changes to another form. They don't travel between worlds. There is only ONE world. So if the world line shifts, the world itself restructures itself to compensate for any paradoxes.           Every time travel is supposed to be taking you to a different world line, thus not the same you were in before and excusing not meeting yourself from other time travels. There can be only two at most in the same time line. Which makes time travel useless if you are trying to change a past that is different each time and not the same you came from.   You may end up messing with events that would have prevented the future events from happening in a natural way. Also, the whole thing is very convenient, as you go back to a different world line but always return back to the same in the future, with the time altered the way you please and no paradox of you being there at all. What if you, from that specific past world line, never time traveled because of your changes? How can you possibly be in a future you time traveled back from, if you never time traveled in the past because there was no threat to need it?   See the paradox? The whole thing is a crock theory by modern pseudo-science and despite their efforts to make it believable.  The first circle proves that A2 was created by itself, something which is impossible. The second proves that there should be three Okabes in the same timeline since time by then was linear again, or two without the third being heard screaming in the background. It is so simple, see?            because I've seen people refer to Futaba as 2chan, it is 2chan now  In reality, 2chan and Futaba are still different sites, and "2ch" is still just a nickname for the former. What  said is still correct, and would've still been correct if he had said any of "2channel", "2chan" or "2ch".      There can be only two at most in the same time line.  Stopped reading right there. I don't know what scientif model of time travel you're going by, but the one in Steins;Gate specifically states that there is only worldline in existence, ever.     The show literally contradictions you, when he used the time machine to go back in the time in the Beta world, literally 2 Okabe's existed at that moment in time.    In the game Suzu says that you can't go back in time to a timeline where your previous time traveler self has been too. So therefore you wouldn't be able to run into your previous time traveling self.  So therefore only two can exist in the word at any given moment.      But they both existed in the same worldline.   Yeah, only two versions of one person can exist, I never disputed that. The other guy was trying to say that there must be more than one worldline, which is wrong.       First things first. Beta Okabe travels back, meets Kurisu, stabs her, the result is seen by the "first" Okabe.  First Okabe goes on world line drifting. Ends up in Beta, get's contacted by Suzuha. Travels back to beginning, stabs Kurisu, as seen in the beginning.  Beta Okabe now get's a mail of S;G 0 Okabe (his future self) and is encouraged to try again. In order for this message to be sent, he had to witness the stabbing first hand, to ensure S;G 0 Okabe's existence.  Beta Okabe goes back in time, meets Kurisu, as before, prevents her death, by getting stabbed, and forming the pool of blood. This results in "First" Okabe to see Kurisu lying in a pool of blood, this results in his drifting on Alpha, this results in him having regrets on Kurisu, this results in him obsessing over her and building the time machine, this results in Suzuha going back etc etc.  Now. This is important. By going back into the "future" the cycle is broken. Suzuha vanishes, because she can't have existed at the time, Okabe somehow got a similar wound. Kurisu remembers Okabe, because he saved her, coming back from a now non-existent future.  What you are probably upset about is the fact, that Okabe shouldn't have been able to come from a future that does not exist, right?  This is wrong, because the future did exist, and was observed.  You have to understand it like this; the world is breaking down into a state of stability, like a radioactive atom. The world itself is aiming for a state without time travel. That's the "choice" of Steins;Gate. The world went through numerous loops, so it could achieve the state it is in now, yet all those loops existed at one "time" (if you can even call it this).   This is why I claim the world lines in spin-offs to be non-canon, because they never went into reality. And are merely unreachable possibilities.                               non-canon   They were put out by the authors. They're canon.       everything put out by authors is canon  Yeah, no it doesn't work that way anymore. 8-bit is non-canon, doesn't matter how you turn and twist it. Similar, Darling and Phenogram are non-canon too. They never happened, they will never happen.         on a different divergence   arguing about canonicity      They simply explore alternate worldlines. The true end worldlines are just the ones explored in the greatest detail.    Not as bad as Cash/grab series.    Kurisu remebers all the other shit on the Alpha timeline as well for some reason what was properly explained besides "maybe everyone has reading stiner".    That shit was only in the OVA, not the original Novel.  I don't want to consider those definite sources for the inner workings of the world of Science;Adventures.  Yet again, both Luka and Faris remembered stuff of previous world lines. So it's possible that she remembers a little, as seen in the True End of the VN and the anime, but not everything, as proclaimed in the OVA and movie.         Source on that pic? Style looks familiar    The artist name is called  Dagaotokoda     Now that shit was in the VN as well, Okabe meets Kurisu on the zigzag crossing again in S;G and blurts out one of her nicknames and she retorts with the "I am not celeb 17, your assistant or Christina etc." which then indicates she remembers then the game ends there.    The VN tries to say everyone has reading steiner just that Okabe's was the strongest, so every other character should be able remember as well.    http://www.2chan.net/ = Futaba Channel http://2ch.net/ = 2channel  @channel is a text board, which means it is not based off 4chan's Japanese equivalent, Futaba Channel/2chan.net, but 2channel/2ch.net, the text board that is way more relevant.       I said she may remember a little, as seen in the end of the VN and the anime, but not everything.  The True End leaves it ambiguous as to how much she remembers, I'd like to think only strong memories carried over. Kurisu's strongest memories are "never being called by name", so of course, she reacted to that without even knowing why. She may subconsciously have those memories, but she is not able to recall them.  Maybe Steins;Gate 0 will shine light upon this, because in Epigraph (or Pandora) there were lots of people who remembered the Alpha world lines, and there were advertisements for counseling.         Are you rusing me, anon? I was only asking because reverse search turned up nothing    Are you rusing me, anon? Are you seriously unaware of what DAGA-OTOKO-DA is?  inb4watchingdub     Things I'm expecting:   Shellshocked PTSD Okabe. Tries to act normal at first, but has severe panic attacks every once in a while. Uses the Kurisu AI as a way to cope with what he did   He gets more and more detached as the story goes on. Is ruthless as a leader, but spends an unhealty amount of time talking with the Kurisu AI.   Ultimate bro Daru: believes in Okabe to the bitter end, even sacrificing his family to see his dream become a reality.        Here it is. On the next pages, Mayuri's friends remember her dying, so I expect great things of it.  This will surely explain any questions that are still there about the Reading Steiner.       Makes me wonder, if the hotline was installed because of committee pressure.     I wasn't here when it aired, but did anons start tripcoding as John Titor?   I've no idea who the artist is, but the only word in English in their description on Pixiv was "Strom1000", hence why I calked all the pics "Strom X".     anons   tripcoding  That's not how it works.      I wonder what the trip was.    Yeah, this will probably be dealt with in a specific route, with the friends as the "heroines".     Why are we still here? Just to suffer?     They keep a lot of memes that are 2chan specific, though -- like the "This guy's hopeless -- better do something about him quick." A lot of the memes remained endemic to 2chan, but a lot of the lingo like "moar" got localized. At least, that's what happened in the VN. The show's a different story entirely.   So, is it known how much Zero will cover? I'm kind of hoping for a time skip showing broken old man Okade before his death leaving the video.   I was talking about the VN, and, yeah, that's why I said "HALF of the 2chan memes were localised".    Zero takes place starting in November 2010 in the Beta Attractor Field outside of the Steins Gate. Though it will draw from the Epigraph Trilogy light novels/manga and the stories from various drama CDs, it is not a "game-ification" of those stories but will have its own new scenario. New characters will also be joining the cast.  So takes existing side material, chuck in some new characters and some other original content and bam, we have S;G 0.       old man Okabe  doesn't he die before he's forty, or is that just on the Alpha attractor field?       skinny daru   What what what?       Full circle. It'll end with Okabe in the Beta line receiving the video message.    Take a guess at the timeframe of the piece of fanart.     Anime when?   I meant more like "Dark Knight Returns" Okabe, when he's middle aged, jaded, tired as fuck and leaves things up to Daru and Suzuha before kicking the bucket.     middle aged  He's only 33 at the time of his death.     Huh. I thought it was 44 for some reason. So if dies at age 33, I guess we might see the entire thing in Zero. I wonder if the true route will be a romance one, or if it will be the one where can't let go and remains alone.    I really want to be able to romance Mahou, but I don't think it's likely, since she's the main heroine but the main route is Kurisu romance.    I think you might be able to do her route, but the main one will remain the Kurisu one, like the first time around.    Breaking Mahou's heart WILL happen. Breaking girls' hearts by giving up their future was the whole of S;G   Super updated map of what nations I think the Committe has influence in, with areas of high influence in red, and low influence in blue.   Luka's heart wasn't all that she had broken...       genius   beautiful hair   big blue eyes   avid shitposter   cute outfit   Nazi   Was there ever a more perfect girl?             Based Ireland in white   How did I miss this thread? I know I checked the catalog multiple times today.   Maybe it won't end up like that. I mean, we didn't even know how Altair ends.     Why do you think they have influence in Russia? When Russia gets their hands on the Time Travel documents, events spiral out of the Committee's control. Since their main influence is seen through SERN, the Committee seems to be US/Western Europe based. Russia seems to have its own plans.    I want FES-tan to drool in my eyeball.     dat Braunian Motion cover    Just asking, did /a/ sing a sci.ADV OP or ED?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tyl<wbr>zZEYY_po</wbr>  [ ]   If Okabe had Reading Steiner which allowed him to perceive changes in the World Line, why did he not notice when the world line diverged every other time before? Or was it more of an idea that only divergences that pertain to him affect him?  so is there a complete sciadv timeline somewhere? i've kind of lost track of everything what with all the alternate fandisks and sequels   What times before? It never changed prior to him sending the first d-mail.    The World Line hadn't diverged without him actively changing it, so it hadn't diverged before 2010.    I'll make one.     Hm... I guess my concept of worldlines is still off. Thanks.     yeah cause I saw somewhere that S;G and C;H take place on different worldlines, but the characters of C;H are mentioned to be members of the resistance against the Committee of 300 in R;N. Is that just Fluff, since Shibuya is destroyed and remains destroyed at the end of the main C;H plotline?  Really, the problem is that all the different SciAdv games have their own wiki, instead of a single one where all the information is correlated.      Chaos;Head still takes place in the Steins Gate because nothing Okabe did to get there impacted 2009 Shibuya. Shibuya is being rebuilt during the events of Steins;Gate, and is fully rebuilt by 2015 and the events of Chaos;Child.     So the alpha field is one where SERN got the time machine technology first and used it to create a dystopia. okabe's resistance managed to send someone back as well, creating a large divergence, the beta timeline, but this allowed his own self to invent a time machine in the past, which screwed things up. Then he tries to unscrew things, and eventually reaches Stein's Gate, a stable timeline where SERN is prevented from getting the time travel technology they need to bring their dystopia to fruition in the future. They don't magically stop existing, however, which results in the fight we see in R;N. Is that about right? I just like having a concise timeline in my head so i'm trying to figure it out and obviously, time travel is going to make a concise timeline screwy.  http://steins-gate.wikia.com/wiki/L<wbr>ist_of_Known_World_Lines  this was the shit i was looking at.  </wbr>      Beta came first. Alpha was created when Okabe sent the D-Mail about Kurisu being stabbed. It was picked up by SERN's echelon which alerted them to the PhoneWave in Akihabara, thus creating a Dystopia in the future which in turn affected the past due to Nakabachi's conference being cancelled by Suzuha crashing.    Bump.  Do we know anything about Okabe's parents?   They own a fruit store. Okabe's dad is muscular.    What about Mayuri's?    Mayuri's mother is apparently a kindly older woman and very much like her daughter.    Got any more interesting SciADV family facts?    I wonder if shogun's parent's know about Taku   https://sites.google.com/site/scien<wbr>ceadventureseries/home/series-timel<wbr>ine  I'll do the other Attractors later. Also tell me if you see anything I missed.  </wbr></wbr>  so are mayushi's eyes grey or green? i don't get it  Is Mayushi in this? The anime was pretty shit but tuturu made it enjoyable.   Distant valhala translated? Sounds pretty interesting    Yeah it's on my site. Translation's a few years old now so it's due a revamp, but it should still be okay to get the point across.    Cheers man. What's up for TL next outside [REDACTED]    Not sure, been kinda busy. I do have full scans for the Octet manga but they'd require a buttload of cleaning.   How many anime's are there in this universe?  Yuki when?   Three so far, with Chaos;Child due soon-ish. One's good, one's mediocre and one's absolute shit. The source materials are all fine though.    I'm surprised no one ever uses their trips to roleplay on /a/  Although technically they hang out more on /x/ so...     I watched choas;head and steins;gate, and ive played the steins gate vn. What about the robotics;notes is that relevant?    You should've read Chaos;Head, the anime is garbage. Robotics;Notes takes place 9 years after Steins;Gate.     refer to image<br/>    I was disappointed with the little attention that Faris and Ruka got in their episodes, but considering how the VN's a 30-35 hour read, it was inevitable.  The anime did a superb job at replicating the feelings that I got when I sped through the VN for the second time, striking true end. The ending was masterfully adapted.      This is a very basic wiki an anon whipped up in a thread last month. https://sites.google.com/site/scien<wbr>ceadventureseries/ Hopefully, with everyone's participation, it can become fully fledged. </wbr>     Are Taku's eyes gold, grey or blue? Are Suzuha's brown or green? Are Ayase's purple, red or gold? Every characters' eyes change depending on which artist draws them, and when that artist drew them. Just don't think too hard about it.       You're missing the underscores    An anon? Steiner himself is making that site!    Huh. I was the one who requested it of a random anon, and it was someone who replied anonymously to me that had created it. Never would have guessed it was Steiner.    Winter Mayushii and her friends.   Milking it hard, I see.    Is this address real?  I'm going to be in Tokyo pretty soon, and one of my half jokes was to go to Akihabara and see some of the S;G locales. If that apartment is real, that'd be fucking great.       The apartment and Braun Tube Workshop do exist in real life, not sure if it's that exact address though.     This exists? I've only just finished C;H and this would go a long way to answering questions.     The site's mostly a WIP without many pages yet. But if you have any particular questions I can answer them now.     If Taku is an incredibly strong gigalomaniac, why wasn't every delusion he was having manifesting itself? He'd been capable of doing it without his Di-Sword at times, so what's the issue?  How did Shogun/Takumi find Rimi in the first place? How did a friendship even form between them?  Who exactly is Rimi? Just someone who was found by Nozomi? Also, how does she end up first appearing in the staking incident?  Is gigalomania just some rare naturally occurring phenomenon?            Don't suppose you'd have any idea where they'd be then?      He wasn't awakened as a Gigalomaniac at that point. His obscene power manifested itself towards the end of the VN after he had fully awakened due to the psychological pressure.    Rimi's mind called out to Shogun. She was being tormented by NOZOMI and she constantly shattered her own mind and reset her memories and personality. Shogun appeared inside her inner world and saved her, this is explained a little more in the Rimi route during Noah.    Rimi was just a gigalomaniac, a victim that became a friend of the original Takumi. She ended up at the staking incident due to three delusions synchronizing in one, this is further explained in the Rimi route of Noah.   Yes, it's to do with a physical growth on the brain. Albert Einstein was also a Gigalomaniac.          The building in the game is actually a combined version of two real-life buildings. The original base is the Hikoyama Building in Akihabara. If you follow the directions Okabe gives at the start of the VN, it'll take you there.     There's a map on the Steins;Gate wiki with all the places and where their real life analogues are I think.    Yep. https://twitter.com/DistantValhalla<wbr>/status/613656779252232192</wbr>     Also interesting to note that MayQueen NyanNyan is a real location too.     It's going to be wikia style?    Whaddya mean?    There's free editing ( bad idea)  Or maybe an invite is necessary to edit?     For now it's only myself that can make pages and stuff, I'll see where it goes. It might take a while to do but I want to make sure I read up on the subject fully before doing a page so it's all credible and backed by official sources.    Huh, for some reason I thought that Kurisu did that exchange program several years earlier, not right before the story started.    Her outfit is a modified version of that school's uniform, so it makes sense that she'd have gone there just before the game starts.   Huh. Where did they ever state that Kurisu was executed after completing the Time Machine? I don't remember reading anything about that.   Suzuha manga    Suzuha says she dies in 2034. It's officially called an accident but most people knew that SERN simply had no more use for her.    Thanks, anon. I should get around to reading that and Mr. braun's manga sometime.    Suzuha manga is largely garbage and only partially canon. Braun manga is one of the best side materials around.    https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   No spoiler summary on the OP? Disappointing.      Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                               Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      Spoiler that shit next time, jesus.    Summary of the entire LN:  -Yui being a retarded whore who can't even say her true feelings and now is getting BTFO because she wants to live a lie -Yukino is a worthless bitch who can't fix her own mess and try to ask for help to everyone, first hayama, then Haruno and now 8man. Fucking dependant whore. -8man is an edgy faggot who try to find muh genuine even if he have that on his face but he's too retarded to make a single desition because he's just a coward. -Haruno take the antagonist role just because all those 3 faggots can't even realize they are living a lie. -Hayama a cunt -SENSEI IS THE ONLY TRUE ENDING BUT WATARI IS A CUCKLORD SO HE'S GOING TO PICK YUI OR YUKINO  Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?             Fuck off retard, stop posting false information      I'll make a summary   Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?      Friendly reminder  To those complaining about Spyro's translations having mistakes, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktards and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking plebs    Meta cuck   Marvelous.    I'm gonna miss you after this all over. See you in another thread in summer, I guess   No matter how much shitposting we make, you're all great, anons. Couldn't ask for a better, fucking twisted community. Fuck you all anons, fuck you all.    Blatant shitposter obviously trying to false-flag one of the smallest and weakest waifu factions.   Nigga go fuck yourse-   Doesn't bother including Iroha   kek'd. Carry on you gigantic faggot.           Implying he's not falseflagging falseflag     So he's not  genuine ?    Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   Little sister won right?   She already won before Hachiman got turned down by Orimoto    too lewd    I think this comic will answer your question  (1/3)      Hachiman teachings:  “It’s obvious they did that so no one would suspect them. If it were me, I would’ve avoided slandering one of them on purpose to frame them.”  He intended to be called out as an irohafag falseflagging a weak faction. Either a senseifag who wanted pity or an anti-irohafag      (2/3)    (3/3)    The best.     As to be expected     Maybe so, but I figured that given how Irohafags have been clinging to Iroha's spoon thing that taking a jab at her irrelevance by leaving her out would be far more damning than the meaningless words tossed at everyone else.   Making me read at 4 am   It's a commie meme sub. It sounds like she's saying that but the real joke is that she thought he was talking about the rice which CR surprisingly got right.     Reading  What kind of american are you?     I have a hunch that you are a yukinofag trying to falseflag and frame irohafags   In all honesty, 8man's behavior in the spoon-feeding scene is pretty suspect, and it's possible Iroha realized it too. (Thus her ambiguous reaction to the exchange.) Namely, between the "words she was waiting for" and the "Too sweet" line at the end, there are implications that 8man wasn't being entirely genuine with Iroha here during the spoon dialogue.  The question is, what does it mean if he wasn't? 8man outright lying to Iroha would be an extreme step out of his usual character. Even if he's guilty of falling into non-genuine patterns in the past, he usually never does it directly through dialogue, but instead manufacturing situations where it's not necessary to do so. (Such as the whole valentine's event.) Therefore, even if he isn't being honest with her, it becomes an equally (if not moreso) big event specifically because he's not being honest with her.  In previous scenarios where 8man's non-genuine, it's usually been a misguided and fear-driven attempt to maintain (or, in his words, "protect") something he doesn't want to lose. Take the club for instance, which he effectively froze into a status quo because he was afraid the election would cause their friendship to dissolve. When he stopped being non-genuine with the club, it's not like he gave up on the club itself. He got exactly what he wanted and the club became closer and more "genuine".  1/2          Now let's look at this instance, 8man is clearly being forward with Iroha in this case. Normally when she's being sly and flirtatious he'll tsukkomi, brush it off, or generally not give a proper answer. In this case he actually answers in a positive fashion: "I didn't dislike it." 8man isn't cold/dishonest enough to use Iroha's feelings for utility, so if he's being non-genuine in returning her flirtation it's because he's afraid of what not flirting will do with their relationship. 8man's non-genuine actions stay true to what he genuinely wants, but pursue them in the wrong manner.  For these reasons, even if he's not being genuine in his dialogue with Iroha, it still seems to demonstrate a desire to build a romantic relationship on his part. Furthermore it's not likely that it's "I have to humor her to preserve our friendship", as 8man has been aware of Yui's feelings for quite a while but has not given her the same sort of treatment. It goes without saying that something as cliche as "this isn't genuine, I actually love X" is unlikely, as his prior development shows that a non-genuine attempt to be with Iroha will be backed by a genuine desire to do so.   In conclusion I'd say that Iroha has very likely won 8man's affection, but she has not yet won the 8bowl. The simple reason being that since Watari put in those implications, it's most likely so he can capitalize on them for later drama. As an Irohafag I'm actually pleased about this because, quite frankly, it wouldn't be good writing if things were so simple. Iroha's best and most endearing moment is when she was on the train after being rejected, and she really hasn't been given any particularly emotional scenes other than that. There's upcoming roadbumps but, assuming 8man doesn't catastrophically fuck things up, their relationship will be all the better for it in the end.  2/2           You should stop if you don't even know what those 3 pages were about.    Can't fall asleep so it might help but it was like only 4 minutes long    It's not that Commie didn't got it wrong, it's that it makes sense. I don't know how CR translated it but if they went "Komachi? Who's that, rice?" they went full retard.    We should wait until some anon gives us a proper translation of all six pages, and not just a summary. For instance, I don't know if he said "too sweet" or just "sweet" (amai)     This is kind of a stretch, and that coming from a guy who was happy to see 8man shift from "this was irresponsible of me" to "how do I even ask someone out" with Yui's promise date.     Are you seriously believe that everybody in your fanbase is completely innocent and can do no wrong? And is it somehow always Yukinofags fault?    It's become a bit of a meme to blame literally everything on Yukinofags evwn though literally the only ones waifufagging are Irohafags.    mu dik   Also, despite that I also enjoyed keep talking about saliva and flirting as if they really exists. But in fact this part only has one meaning: It's hinted that Iroha will make a move in the valentine day (or later) using the "preference" she got from 8man in this scene.   He says 甘すぎだな     Does he know? Do you think he still think that Iroha is going after Hayama? He can't be that dense right? A girl waited for him until he show up just to ask him about his choco preference.      Correct me if i am wrong.  From what happen in ,When Yui is saying she want everyone living in lie together with her. She trying to baiting 8man or Yukino to called out her bullshit.  8man bit it and desperate do another genuine speech to convince both Yui and Yukino back on track to find genuine thing together with him instead stray to superficiality.  After 8man speech done, when Yui saying it just like him and smiling.  8man realises Yui intention and that he (and possibly Yukino too) was the one that almost stray to superficiality makes him cry.         He states 甘いすぎだな when she walks away, when licking the chocolate from his cheek.  甘いすぎ literally translates to "too sweet".  That line alone is a pretty big warning flag, especially the way it's used. The "words she was waiting for" is more of an additional nail in the coffin.  And really, it comes down to simple narrative structure. There's no way in Iroha and 8man would get into a relationship without it running into some kind of drama before the end of the series, it wouldn't be refined if it isn't put to the test at any point.          I don't believe irohafags are completely innocent and free of shitposters. However, in this case, it's very unlikely for them to be behind that post. Why would we be so obvious at false-flagging, when we can just circlejerk about the (not confirmed yet) indirect kiss and their flirting afterwards?  Once you discarded irohafags, then the culprit has to be either yukinofag or yuifag. And there are 3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  He shitted on Yui before Yukino (while the normal order would be Yukino and Yui). He did the same with who will win (Yui first, then Yukino)   Between yukinofags and yuifags, the first ones tend to be more anti-irohafags than the latter (I call it not-first-girl sympathy)   Sensei is like an adult Yukino (although this argument is subjective)           いすぎ     Yes, that was why some anon said she is the hero Service Club deserve.    Feel free to elaborate.  I did maybe go a bit too strongly by taking it for granted that 8man already likes Iroha, but at the very least things are heading in that direction.  The 嫌いじゃねえけど was a very significant statement by 8man. What is currently in question is the exact motivations behind him saying it.       Iroha will win, right?   Now you're projecting  Who's to say it's not Totsukafag or even Hayacuckfag?  Really, no one is fucking innocent. Best bet is to assume all falseflaggers are neutral party who wanted to see the thread burn  Which is what happened with almost every thread anyway.         「えいっ！」 一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来事<wbr>にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一色<wbr>が蠱惑的に笑った。 「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」 スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る。<wbr>いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑発<wbr>的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」 糖分はきっとそこまでではないのだろうけれど、舌が痺れるほどに甘い。てい<wbr>うか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことされると<wbr>ほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。 疲労には甘いものがいいと言うが、この手の心労には逆効果らしい。どっと押<wbr>し寄せてくる疲れに思わず吐息を漏らすと、一色も同じようにため息を吐いた<wbr>。 「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」 口ぶりこそ興味がなさそうだったが、ちらと向けられた瞳には答えを待ってる<wbr>色がある。 俺は口の中に残る甘さを噛み締めながら、一色の言わんとするところを噛み砕<wbr>いた。</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>     3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  All your reasons are bullshit      the words she was waiting for  He fucking knows, anon. He's not buying into the Hayama crap anymore.     She is there for the drama so not likely. She might be another Kuroneko    He picked up enough to give her a forward answer regarding the chocolate. Whether he has a solid idea of how she feels about Hayama I don't know, but whatever he thinks about it he's shown intent in getting closer to Iroha.   My mistake, it's pretty late.      「それでも、答えは変わらんな…」 「…そうですか」 一色は何事か考えるように、腕の中のボウルを見つめてふむふむと頷く。そし<wbr>てぱっと顔を上げた。 「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」 にこやかな微笑みで言うが早いか、一色はばたばたと駆け出していく。 それを見送りながら、ほっぺについたチョコを指で拭って口に運んだ。チョコ<wbr>レートとラム酒の香りが鼻を抜けていく。 「甘すぎだな……」 </wbr>   </wbr>     I'll be expecting your full thesis on how Yukinofags did everything wrong by friday. Don't let me down anon   Why is she using to pencils as chopsticks?   I can't figure out whether this is satire or just the ramblings of a retard    Guaranteed replies/10.     “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   MUH FUCKING DICK         W-where is the evidence?       Actually yeah, when you put it that way it's almost undeniable that 8man realizes what he's doing.  He's answering a girl who seemingly likes him by giving her "the words she was waiting for". It sounds like he's going after Iroha but with an eroge-esque mindset of acting with the express purpose of making the girl like you more.  In short, 8man's lack of relationship experience is going to fuck him over.         She is there for the drama  kek, she is there for comic relief       This is fucking delicious, 8man trying to go romantic on Iroha. Thank you Watari, you\re not that much of a cunt now.       Iroha finally wins   might actually just be getting Kuroneko'd   Kill me.      There is not going to be another Kuroneko for at least another decade. Everybody remembers what happened when she got kuroneko'd.     Yeah that's the only really glaring issue. You were building a solid argument, then completely jumped the shark by speculating that 8man might want to actively pursue romance with her.  I am interested in the 嫌いじゃねえけど debate though. I'm passingly familiar with the phrase, but I don't really into moon so I'm probably missing out on some nuance.  The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?          drama  It is out of her character to be all drama queen like. Even at her lowest when she was shown to be out of her depth during the stuco collab event and at the end of the disneyland, she never made a big deal out of it or cause huge drama.      I'm a Yuifag, but somehow I feel like Irohafags circle jerk is a lot more endurable than Yukinofags circle jerk.    It's nice now that its calmed down. It was goddamned unbearable right after the pages with the tasting scene got posted. Some of those guys turned the autism dial to 13 then broke the knob off.    We don't photoshop saliva or an actual kiss between the two and then shitpost those until the website's duplicate image system prevention kicks in.     The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?   「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」   But the pause is before the sentence, so it should be But I don't hate it. Another story would be that the pause was at the end, as if he didn't finish the sentence       Stop false flagging!     Just to add something to this, isn't Iroha the only one he went out of his way to talk to during the chocolate-making? Orimoto comes to him, Yukino calls him for chocolate-tasting, and Hayama just happens to be there while he's chilling by the wall. Iroha he actually walks up to and compliments for being able to make sweets, it's almost no surprise that she immediately responds with the hitting-on gag. And then of course we get the sweetness conversation from that.     Basically he thought for a long time before saying this line. His brain was shutting down.    She was made to lose.    The dots / pause came before the sentence. My guess would be "but I don't dislike/hate it". A comma or a repositioning of that pause would change everything.      You must be not here when the fake spoilers were posted for the first tiem.    How can one girl be so fucking best?     "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"  now BTFO yui       How the fuck can you be mad about phoroshop? That's the only good thing to come out of these threads. Not to mention that scene was basically asking to be shopped.    Who the fuck is trying to raise false flags? Fucktards. Yuifags are at least easier to tolerate than Irohafags.   I'm not especially proficient myself but I'm pretty sure it's meaning changes contextually. What you're referring to would be more like 嫌いじゃねえ、けど。。。 which would firmly indicate the けど leads off into something else. When it's just used to end a standard sentence I think it turns into more of a slang/nuance that indicates a non-committal answer.  That said I'm really not an authority. I've heard けど end sentences a lot though and I don't recall it ever being something that significant. It really doesn't make sense contextually for 8man to be using lead-offs in that conversation either.     Holy shit this thread going mad again. Sasuga /a/, I'm going outta here.  Fuck the falseflagger, all of you.      Hayate  Hinagiku end when?     Wait, when did the spoon come off his mouth? The illustration shows this part  She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes.  And he still has the spoon on his mouth.      So basically Yui is Haruno's foil in this volume.    She intervenes when Haruno's needling are making things uncomfortable between Yukino and Hachiman during cooking event, even though it pains her.    When Haruno says she's moving in with Yukino, causing Yukino to despair, Yui invites her to stay with her.    At the end, Yui is the catalyst for the dialogue that leads to the service club finally starting to overcome the problems Haruno exposed.        thinking about what others said about the pause being in front, is it possible that he only vocalized the back half of a thought? like say "It's too sweet, but I don't hate it"     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."   「甘すぎだな……」"it's too sweet"       Yui is Haruno's foil   Since the beginning. Since Chiba Mura end. Haruno already knew that Yui will be a needle in her plan. Hence she showed unfavorable response to Yui, occasionally      Was that where 2ch was getting the idea that maybe he was rejecting her? Effectively saying "She's not bad, but too sweet for my tastes"  Related to that, how many times could the sweet/naive wordplay be a factor in that scene?       一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来<wbr>事にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一<wbr>色が蠱惑的に笑った。</wbr></wbr>  「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」  スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る<wbr>。いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑<wbr>発的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。</wbr></wbr>   I'm cumming bucket now. God blesses Watari-sama.        That's where some of them were coming from, yeah. But then again, others just said that they're trying to read too much into it, that 8man is not going to BTFO somebody like that.      ていうか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことさ<wbr>れるとほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。</wbr>   Suck this denialfag, it's clearly stated that Iroha had used it before, and 8man is conscious about it.       Now that you mention it, I like that interpretation a lot. It ties in his answer to her question with the last line of the conversation very nicely.  Only thing that it leaves me wondering about is the "answer she was waiting for" bit though. On one hand it carries implications, but on the other it sounds kinda lewd.  I also have a foggier idea about the nuance of the scene now.        The waifufagging and shipping in these threads is absolutely intolerable. I stayed out of Yahari threads for the first half of the season until I caught up with the LNs and I came backing thinking there might be decent threads like before the anime aired, how stupidly mistaken was.   Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?     so what do you think "...I don't hate it though" mean?     &gt;She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.   &gt;"Even so, my answer is the same."   &gt;"Is that so..."   &gt;Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.   &gt;"Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.  &gt;"Too sweet...   He lied to her. Iroha ship sinking.             Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?  Nah, but for some reason I always ended up in this place anyway.       Now we're going back to ground zero in their scene with no proper conclusion. This is when informality becomes a huge issue. People are supporing either side both here and in 2ch because of Watari's way of writing that.        「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  Shouldn't it be 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど...」or 「……嫌いじゃねぇ, けど...」 for that translation?     Pure love.     I have no doubt Watari wrote it deliberately to be ambiguous.  Sort of like Yukino's purported "I have become aware of Hachiman" line.        because of Watari's way of writing that.  Maybe it's intentional that he made it ambiguous? Watari is certified troll that like to rile up his fanbase.     So, Iroha ship is on the limbo right now? If that's so, then we'll have our answers only on volume 12.     Every ship is on the limbo, they've always been there since the start.  Watari is a troll, a cocktease and a possible hack.  News at 11.      Does it matter? Look at  It is not something negative and coffee max is sweet as fuck.      yukino is going to win  Nothing changed indeed.     Yukinofags unite. All enemy shitposters shall choke on their keyboards when Yui and Iroha get rejected by the 8man,    I really don't see how you can call that a rejection. Quite the opposite in fact, as 嫌いじゃない is often used as a confession-LITE. For the LN to spend that huge amount of time setting up Iroha and 8man only for him to go "thanks but no thanks" and drop her into obscurity would just be shoddy writing.   Also something worth mentioning, the entire "sweetness" metaphor used in that conversation is most likely a reference to 8man's date with Iroha in 10.5, during which he makes a bunch of "sugar and spice" metaphors about her. (Including saying she has "a bit of excess spice in her")  So in 10.5 8man says he's she's sweet and a little too spicy. In 11 he says she's too sweet, but he doesn't dislike it. What does it mean?        Why even bother?. This bowl was over from episode/volume 1. It's either her or no one.     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  That should be tranlated as "...I don't dislike/hate it though". There's no comma splitting the sentence, nor ellipsis at the end of the sentence, so you can't get that "but..." meaning    Alright, just woke up from a come from 3 weeks.  What have I missed?  Did Iroha win?       I just want to see Iroha get rejected   The raw version makes me think he says "too sweet" as "too much to be believed".  Damn I really can't put it into words the right term.       character to be developed last   winning       First half of v11 has a bunch of Iroha flags Second half is yukinoshitas drama, 3some date, Yui going all out and Yukino finally deciding to say what she wants after 8man called all of them out for being not genuine.     I understand your point anon, but you're reading far too much into it. He simply says "Too sweet" and he doesn't dislike it.   Is there really gonna be only 1 more volume left? There's way too much shit for just 1   I wouldn't necessarily say we're "back" at ground zero. The scene implies big things in regards to Iroha either way, it's just not entirely clear to what end. In that sense we're much further along than before the LN came along.  And really, we've made a lot of progress from "holy shit they're basically having sex with sweetness metaphors Iroha won!" and "no fuck you this can't possibly be real!"       Did Iroha win?   She lost, 8man is not genuine with her.     What are these faces trying to convey? It's just harmless giri choco   http://peace.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>bookall/1435077524/262  Lots of nips seem to believe that Yui has the highest chance of winning right now because of 8man's reaction after he received Yui's cookies.  Also kinda funny how they nicknamed Yukino Copypaste-non,  because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.     </wbr>   So guys, what do you expect 1) a weak love triangle in the background 2) brutal and traumatizing love triangle 3) no love triangle     We still have the VN brothers , right?    Not harmless when the person you're interested in gets choco from another bitch. It's serious business. If they had AKs they would use them.     Well, it's 1 problem per volume so it will be enough. Will probably end at their spring time of their third years.      winning right now because of 8man's reaction   How he reacted?      Second, but it leads to bittersweet friendship end with hints of future romance    Nothing was stated in the afterword, so it's likely vol 12 isn't the final volume    It went something like  Komachi? You mean the rice?  which is perfectly understandable.  Next I suppose you'll be defending "chalk and let" and "rice krispy treats"?        Chocolate is serious fucking business in Japan.     Orimoto never said it was giri. Also if they knew 8man once liked her there would be hell to pay. Yui may defer to Yukino and vice versa but I doubt the would let in another girl. Why do you think Iroha still keeps up the Hayama facade?    Who's more fluffier Uzuki or Kaede?     Anyone fluffier than Queen Kaede.  Please.

She would be proud of your efforts.       Oh, I'd make her proud of my efforts if you know what I mean.      implying she is that sort of girl   implying she isn't pure and innocent despite what outward appearances might so.  you people make me sick      Mysterious Eyes when?   Anything and everything for Mil@dy.    Of course. Kaede is worth fighting for.    When I finish kissing Kanade.    I have no problems with trashy gyaru Rina though If you think the idea of killing a Four Loko and a pack of Marlboros together on top of your roof as the sun sets doesn't sound romantic then she's not your kind of girl        I do have to wonder though of how far we can take theses interpretations of the idols without some form of sufficient evidence to back up said claims. One can say pure but the other can say trashy, how are we to know of which is the real truth and not just wishful thinking and bullshit?      Rina is the kind of girl that would take you behind or in restroom of a convenience store though.      Hugs and headpats for Rina.     Is she homeless?    No, but there is a homeless idol.     she likes going to convenience stores as a hobby   go in there and buy $100 worth of snacks and junk food  Sounds like an girl to please        Donate your blood to me, Syuko!    Eve Santaclaus     sells her blood for money   not selling her sweet ass for double  She could have been living the high life instead of sleeping rough for the first few months       Slipping that glass slipper on you Syuko.     Is she a slut? I like sluts.    h8, r8, deb8, or appreci8    What do you think?    Sae has cornered the kyoto enjo kosai market. there are no deep pocket big dick oji-sans to be had.    Anzu dead last  I like you         I feel guilty for finding this idea comfy and appealing Am I a bad person?     no, its just a very hipster kind of romantic    no it sounds comfy and like something straight out of the early 70s. do it for her do it for Rina    No slutty gyaru's are love. just dick them to the point that no other dick will do.     they didn't have four loko in the 70s m8 replace it with cocaine if you want to be era-appropriate  this also sounds fun, fuck       these Rinafags coming out of the woodwork  where have you all been hiding?    /a/ secretly loves sluts, myself included   Does Kaede like cosplay sex?   Yes. What's her back story?  I love listening to all the perverted stuff.        You wouldn't a mushroom    She's nuclear.   Thread has had a lack of delicious cake lately.    10/10 would put a ring on   This is hard since I dont even know who half the CG idols are, I still love my 765      you can check only the 765 box if you want, and core CG which are only the ones that got a single.    Is that a squid ring?    i think it is but it's the thought that counts   im starting to believe the mods are purposely giving us cake img captchas        Onion ring      you will never have a passionate lovemaking session with Rina on a hot summer night in her trailer while her dad's drunken himself asleep on the couch   you will never taste the drops of her sweat that drip from between her breasts mingle with the aftertaste of cheap whiskey on your tongue, both of you overheated from the lack of working A/C   you will never drive her to McDonald's afterwards so she can get some fries and a shake at 2 in the morning while dressed only in your oversized sweatshirt and some panties   you will never follow her outside after a cigarette and the teasing flash of her underwear while you wait for your order to be called out   you will never take her for round two right there in the parking lot   I've got all kinds of sadness I never knew existed inside me        Miku may usually act like a playful cat at work, but when she gets serious, she's not kitten around!   BAKA BABA    Just curious how long did it take for you to type that?    fuck you i didn't need this right now    all this hagposting  Hooray for dry, meat curtain covered pussies indeed.    Couple minutes   I like my sundaes with Chieri on top. Rerorerorero~   Pretty much just got into CG and probably iM@S as a whole. Those not in the anime's main cast I chose based off their appearance and their bio on Project iM@S, how did I do?    ...but ALL of those girls listed in that picture of yours have appeared in the anime.   With that said, I would say you have pretty good taste       damn...    Penus too low but other wise good.    I wanna marry Kaede; even though I know I'll be miserable when shes drunk; I still wanna take care of her.    Ugly, droopy eyes, pointy long face. What the fuck is with this particular hag?  Least she looks good.        tfw no Minamin to cuddle      Minami   hag  kek       hag  She is collage aged.     I meant the Cinderella Project, I had to read up on Sae, Karen and Akane and it turns out I like their quirks quite a lot. Anya is just perfect and Minami's parts in the last 2 episodes really made me like her so much more from just simply not minding her.   Post your favorite hag  that'll never get a voice.     You would never have a drunk sex with her on your wedding day.   Why live?       I know I'll be miserable when shes drunk   not working your alcohol tolerance to a level where you can carry her home after a night of carousing and spirits with your beloved   apply yourself!  img captcha booze          Pretty much a hag for all it matters.     RUMIIIII    i want to smash this trailer trash    still salty Rika's bellybutton was reduced to a vertical line in the show?    Very.   Rate, don't hate.   are her tits normally that big?   Why is this anime so good? I started a couple days ago after giving into curiosity from seeing the im@s themed skins in Ace Combat, and now I can't stop watching. I normally hate the genre of "cute girl(s) doing X" with a passion, but this seems to be the exception to the rule.  pic related is idolfu. Ami and Mami are a close second.      because most "cute girls doing cute things" anime are just moeblobs, while im@s still does it, they do it via better characterization and an ensemble cast that makes you want to care about the girls (at least one or two of them)   Why is Mio even the leader of New Gen?  Will they get disbanded?  PLEASE REMOVE MIO       Uzuki's the only worthwhile NG and she's going to crash and burn this next cour anyways Break up NG and the show is made better     Because Uzuki is an average clutz and Rin is a 2cool4u bitch. Hate Mio all you want but she's the life of NG     Because at this point in their personal histories:  Uzuki lacks self-confidence and a spinal vertebrae, and can only ganbarimasu. It's really only after Episode/NoMake 12 that you see she's starting to feel at ease with having finally become the idol she's always wanted to be.  Rin lacks drive and had yet to resolutely feel that becoming an idol will be something worthwhile for her to experience. Until the later episodes, she's really just been "along for the ride" so-to-speak.  That realistically leaves only one possible option for who their leader figure that can actively try to give direction to their assemblage could be.  Leadership in Imas is hardly ever painted with a static designation though. It's always about circumstance, like how Iori leads RK normally, but when the chips are down, we were shown that it's Azusa that takes charge of the situation.             Break up NG  Yes, please.     I want to bare back Nao with reckless abandon.  Then lick her eye brows.       Oh hey look      Two people do not make a triad.      they make something better  a Rin-free group      But 3's a crowd too.    But then where will Minami go?   I want to date the rookie.   Who is this semen demon OP?    With all the other girls Anya was in a unit with before getting ditched.      Where's my slut?  ;_;      Superior version here    I want to pet the shaved bit of her head and call her a good girl   Before any further Rin bullying ensues, some key points about Ayaka Fukuhara (Rin's Seiyuu) revealed in a recent interview:  - Rin was the only role she auditioned for - Her image of Rin was "someone who gets mistaken for a bad person" - She didn't feel like a 3D Rin until recently when she grew her hair out - The most important line for Rin from the first cour is when she says she enjoyed being an idol in episode 13 - Recordings for the anime series are done as a group, Fukuhara says it feels like being in a sports club or school band. The cast eats a lot of fried chicken on work days. - Even though Mio declared herself the leader, there will be times when other members of New Generations will be the leader, like when Mio was depressed and Uzuki became the leader. - All of Rin's lines are scripted, there is no ad-libbing. - She feels a lot of pressure when she sings solo and usually ends up crying. She likes group songs better because there are other people around her. - The CG cast started out distant but between concerts and anime recording, they have grown closer. - If she was a Producer, she would want to produce Anastasia and/or Minami. - Fukuhara wanted to be a dancer as a child and took dance lessons. Her first voice lessons occurred shortly before auditioning for Rin. - She spends her time off going to movies or museums or researching new roles, most recently reading the Arpeggio of Blue Steel manga for her role as Myouko. - Her favorite musician to listen to right now is Nagisa Kuroki.                 Are you a bait?   Showing more skin doesn't mean its much better muh niggah; but thanks for the pic. I'll save it.       Nigga, we don't hate the Seiyuu. We know how hellish and competitive the seiyuu world is and they have our admiration for fighting on in that environment.  That doesn't stop us from shitting on their roles and characters though.  Fukuhara is pretty cool, but Rin a shit. A SHIT.         She feels a lot of pressure when she sings solo and usually ends up crying. She likes group songs better because there are other people around her.   Fun fact: In a recent radio show, Fukuhara received fan feedback that they liked her singing. This knowledge almost brought her to tears.  So she really is insecure about her (admittedly subpar) singing.  Must suck for her considering that Scamco is selling Rin as Cinderella Chihaya.          Nice girls.     If she was a Producer, she would want to produce Anastasia and/or Minami.  Brilliant fucking taste      All of Rin's lines are scripted, there is no ad-libbing.   Wait, so does that mean SOME lines are ad-libbed?       Even though Mio declared herself the leader, there will be times when other members of New Generations will be the leader, like when Mio was depressed and Uzuki became the leader.   See, even Fukuhara acknowledges that when the chips are down and shit gets real, the real leader of NG is Uzuki.      I'd expect small things like Miku's nyas and Anya's Russian to be improv, the latter especially since Sumire probably knows more about Russian than the writers.   So is any idol a true semen demon is it just fan made opinions?    Pure?   Kek      I imagine the Seiyuu are given a degree of freedom and encouraged to touch up their lines and delivery during recording.   Meanwhile, Fukuhara just simply does things 100% by the book.      http://imgur.com/XHTAIsO I wanna sumo wrestle Kanako!     Fan made opinions mostly. The idols in the Cinderella Project are all dedicated to their Producer. A few of the girls however do fall deeply in love with the Producer which leads them to act like semen demons towards him.   Do you think will we ever get a background story about this semen demon in 2nd cour?   And some of them view him as a Grade-A plaything.    I really hope they take the Chieri crushing hard on Producer route for the Anime Incarnation of Chieri.  If there is a person in the Cinderella Project to be openly P-sexual, it's her.   Girl applies to be an idol, she finds success. That's about it.   Even in the source material, she isn't an idol carried by a backstory. Most of the depth of her character is integrated with her relationship with her imouto. So If Rika gets a starring episode, you can expect her to have a prominent role in it too.           That`s certainly true.    Is TakeP lucky or unlucky?    That's TheatreP  Although, TakeP most certainly is based on TheatreP.      Kanako is a yokozuna.   Is she a Mary Sue?   I want Koume to prank my dick.     Superior waifu coming through.     Translation never.    TakeP is lucky. Hopefully the anime expands on his supposed relationship with Kaede. I want to see more of her in the second course.    Kaede would never wink at you   Rin would never get jelly when you look at other girls.   Fuck why do God torture us?      Because God had TakeP as her Husubando.  She ain't taking no mortal wench as competition.      Yeah TakeP is lucky and I wanna see their relationship too.  PS: my captcha is cakes.       Chihiro   God   The madwoman has sent many a Producer's wallet into eternal damnation.  If anything, she's the devil herself.         You called?     PS: my captcha is cakes.   Funny. Me too but I keep getting an error.  Someone email moot about the broken captcha.       Friendly reminder that Mayu loves Producer the most.     She's Anna Stasia    No, remember that doujin when she went "sorry, no space for you" with the baby?    It's sad anon, but I don't think they have a past.    I don't think that a currently existing CG idol will ever be introduced as one of the Idols that left TakeP. They stand to radically alter the characters and aggravate fans of those CGs.  The former Cinderellas of TakeP will probably only be some anime only filler idols.     <br/>  Oh cool, they fixed the freaky fishface in the initial airing for the BDs.  Dooky looks extra Dorky and Cute.   Mio still looks like shit.       It barely looks better.    What do you call those? Granny panties?   Fuck you A-1.   Uzuki is supposed to look like a dorky little kid staring at a pretty poster and fantasizing about her own performance in that scene  I'd say the revision gets that airhead expression down without looking QUALITY.  Mio's expression is just neutral in general.        Bloomers   I wish I could marry Kaede.   This one?   As expected.    Marry Kaede   Gets assulted by drunk Kaede   Never; why live!      Sometimes I just can't pick one.  Mushrooms are adorable  What's the worst anime you've ever seen?   SAO compared to most anime, is mid-tier.   1. aldnoah zero 2. valvrave    Wrong board m8.  /a/ is pleb island nowadays so Naruto,KLK and SAO are the best thing ever.      Yakumo tantei was pretty goddamned bad.  Mahou sensou was awful, Togainu no chi adaptation also sucked about a million dicks, and not in the good way.     Worst anime is anime you don't finish after 3rd episode.   /this    It's either this steaming piece of shit or Mirai Nikki   probably trinity blood or DMC    At least this shit was very unique, won't lie, I was enjoying the ride despite the shitty animation.    Probably your favorite anime, OP.     Your favourite anime.    It's funny because Seraph of the End is 100% shit. I honestly have no clue why I love it so much. Right on the money, anon.   Witch of the East Soul Link Tokkou      le SAO is shit because normalfags like it XD meme  SAO is mediocre at worst. If SAO is the worst anime you've ever seen, you're equally as pleb as those who think SAO is the greatest.     Symphoshit, it's literally edge and asspulls the anime. Most poorly written garbage I've ever seen.     worst anime i've ever seen   posts a mid-tier anime   watch some REAL shit.       Glasslip. Five hours I'll never get back.   Code Geass. I dropped the series in the episode where they spend the whole time looking for a cat. It wasn't deep, thrilling or fascinating like you bastards make it look. The protagonist was bland and edgy, the plot didn't make any sense and the animation was hentai tier.    a mediocre anime is the worst thing he's ever seen    that must mean he's a pleb for not watching complete and utter shit!  10/10, I didn't think anyone could be that stupid      Cool story, bro.    its a certain type of shit that i can't stand. like eureka 7 and accel world, they're so cheesy i couldn't make it past the 4th episode. i mean just terribly terribly cheesy     Funny thing is, I never said SAO is the worst thing I've ever seen. I just chose that picture because I knew it'd probably be a popular choice.     I don't think worst is the word you're looking for. Overrated is more like it. Unless SAO IS the worst anime you've seen, which just means you haven't seen that much. I just finished watching Attack on Titan. It is by no means the worst anime I've ever seen, but it is extremely overrated.   NGE   Easily No Game No Life  The shit characters, the shit plot, the asspulls, the fanservice were all on a completely different level to anything else I've actually finished   the art was nice though         This fucking anime. Holy shit. I don't know if the games are good or something but this felt like it was written by a 12 year old. Fuck. I couldn't even get into it as a PARODY of ninja anime.     literal decades of productions   the worst I can come up with is a mediocre SoL   Wow. What a reply. I, for one, am stunned by your impeccable ability to construct such wise and nigh-flawless posts. If even half the board put as much effort and thought into their posts, I'm sure the board's collective intelligence and overall understanding of the anime medium would reach unforeseen heights.      Such a shame since the girls are cute as hell.   lol. Are you insulted by that?    Yes    No it's only the freshest bad anime in your mind, there have been god aweful woeful ones out there.    Okay.    I'm insulted by everyone's inability to go five seconds without being a complete and utter retard who spews his turdwaste opinions all over this fucking website.    I think you're lookin' for /b/, m8.   <br/>    people who have standards belong on /b/  Kill yourself.     k-on    Can do, buddy.   If only for the obvious LN bait ending  Green Green. Nothing will ever be worse than that.    Alright, glad we could reach a consensus.   Fujoshit of the worst kind.   Actually now that I think about it, this was worse. This is fujoshit for fujos that like being treated like shit.   Legit opinion :   Death Note  Stopped watching after the first half, it's supposed to end there. I read the summary on wikipedia and I'm glad I don't watch further, because the ending is shit.   Code Geass  Stopped watching after S1, it's supposed to end there I don't even read the summary on wikipedia but I know the ending is shit.   Mirai Nikki  Stopped watching after the first half, I'm sure it will end with trainwreck.   Ragnarok Online   Jigoku Shoujo   Rosario + Vampire  Pure crap                   If that stuff is the worst you've seen, then you've been pretty lucky.   Daily reminder.   Illuminate all the good parts and ignore all the bad parts and everything is a prefect ten.   Either Fate or Fate UBW, yes they´re worse than SAO. SAO at least doesn´t pretend to be anything other than fat otaku power fantasy harem pandering. Fate pretend to be something more than k-drama cringe tier.    Oh man, that day was great.     In terms of intellectual bankruptcy, RahXephon. It's so obviously an Evangelion ripoff that it outright steals entire sequences, characters and a good chunk of pre-Red Cross Book speculation about what happened in Eva. It has a better ending that's the result of an even bigger set of deus ex machinas than are required to set up the premise in the first place.  In terms of QUALITY, I watched a bit of the original Getter Robo the other day and found it painful, but that's purely due to aging. I'm sure it was great for its time.      SAO is 2/10 friend     even thinking about considering samflam bad  You officially have the worst taste out of anyone that's ever been on /a/.    Is this the thread where we only post anime that's popular amongst the general public or buzzword websites like reddit and tumblr and dig for generic overused excuses for why they're shit?   Green Green. I want to forget ever watching that show. Master of Marital Hearts at least had the decency to mindbreak me with it's crazy last episode.   Objectively? It's Mars of Destruction. Even if it's a meme it's legitimately one of the worse ever.  Personally? School Days. I have never hated an anime character more than that piece of shit Makoto Itou.    Guys, this is the worst anime you've ever seen thread. Stop namedropping big shows. If what some of you are posting is legitimately the worst you've seen, then you really need to get some more shows under your belt.     Ironically I found the ugly girl the only one worth fapping to. She basically saved the show for me. Although it was still terrible.     Evangelion would be the absolute worst, followed by Fate/stay Night  Sakura Trick  School Days. Hilariously bad, failed in almost every possible way.   No shit. I guess they should consider themselves lucky that they've never seen anything that's actually terrible.   Dragonauts   Ow man i never thought thumblr raids can be this entertaining.    I'm just going to say you have bad taste, because I honestly cant fathom how you consider either of those shows to be the worst you've ever seen, unless those are the only shows you've ever seen.     Death Note   Code Geass  Actually those two have good endings.   Rosario to Vampire is only for fanservice. You either want that or you don't.         I agree with Rosario + Vampire. Most anime is otaku shit that is saturated with harem and fanservice at the expense of everything else including plot and depth. But with rosario + vampire the characters were too annoying to even enjoy the fanservice as a guilty pleasure.   Also. Fucking split personality girl.       This guy gets it. Green Green is easily the worst anime I've ever watched.   Anyone know why SAO was so bad? I really wanted to like it but just stopped watching after 6 episodes. I can't explain it, I just didn't feel the urge to keep watching.  Easily Wizard Barristers.    I always get a chuckle when someone complains about racism/misogyny or any of that western progressive shit in anime, a medium that (at the moment) is immune to that bullshit. They don't give a fuck, and it warms my heart. You may call a lot of anime shit or all of it shit, but at least it's something that the creators and fans built, maintain, and direct without it being manipulated and tarnished by some blogger who says problematic every other word and doesn't actually give a fuck about anime.      Death Note   HUR DUR tumblr liked this show so its pleb shit!! im not going to watch it entirely and give my shit opinion of why its awful     Lucky Star   Not my choice, but I could see why.   http://<span>youtu.be/UhmBnaEcbfA  [ ]      The LN was your standard haremshit LN, but apparently they made changes to make Kirito seem a lot cooler, basically made him more of a self-insert. I haven't read the LN, just what I heard. Apparently Kirito was really scared fighting against the PKers but in the anime he was fearless. He also lost to Yuuki but the anime made it seem like he wasn't trying to win.       Popotan was the worst thing i ever watched   the love hina and negima! series.      posting bait this obvious      hataraku mahou sama  its just shit  dokuro-chan le random xD       Aku no Hana was absolute shit   It's a solid 3/10 anime. Not the worst, but nowhere near mid-tier.   The worst anime I've seen, in no particular order and without going out of my way to watch bad anime, are Togainu no Chi, Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou ~la pretentious title~, Saint Beast, Higurashi Kira, Sex Pistols, Ookamukakushi and Akikan.  But also SAO, Btoom, Naruto Shippuuden, Maoyuu, Afro Samurai, Death Parade, Persona 4, Seed Destiny. The difference is that I'm neutral towards the shows in the first list and I actively hated these.    To me it was one of the most intense anime that aired recently.        Like after 3 episodes it just went to hell   Naruto Shippuden and Hunter x Hunter. I couldn't get passed the first episode of HxH. The cliches killed it. And when Naruto dedicated it's 400th episode to filler, I knew it was time to give up. The manga ending was so shit. He just wanted to end on chapter 700. These new kids they all had isn't make it better. Tie for the worst.  Probably Dragon Crisis, I kept hoping it would get better but it never did, too bad because the main girl wasn't bad.   You people have absolutely no objective standard of ranking do you?  Hurr durr it aint masterpiece, must be either 1/10 or a 3/10      /thread There is nothing more trash than SOA     You talkin' shit 'bout my shiny robots?    This.     Reign: The Conqueror.   No, it's 3/10 because it's a terrible anime. Should I rank everything that's not literally a slideshow 6+?    Escaflowne    Fight me.      Only time I'd agree with you. Worst one for me also.    Fate/zero    FMA Movie    Kampfer   Submarine 707r      Who let that MAL faggot in the picture into /a/   Kiniro Mosaic. Karen was quite entertaining but apart from that the show is almost completely pointless and a colossal waste of time.  Garzeys Wing still, I can't imagine any series could be less coherent   That was a pretty funny thread   Probably some garbage OVA, say, Maryuu Senki. I don't even seek out the infamously bad ones for laughs. Or Mobile Suit Gundam-san. They somehow made a decent manga into an outright physically painful anime with almost nothing but the worst possible jokes they could pick.   You asked for it OP.   Gantz  Filled with easily solved problems I would see in a badly written B-movie   Strike Witches/ Vividred Operation, Might as well because it felt like the same damn thing.  I tried watching this damn thing 3 times. Fanservice so blatant it's cringey, Formulaic copy pasta first season, like Gantz moments of 'WTF, why do that'.  Vividred was the fastest I've dropped an anime (seven minutes thirty seconds) and still managed to give me a literal headache.   Hyouka  I know /a/ is tired of hearing this, but I found it boring as well. The characters were uninteresting (I hate, hate, HATE Chitanda) and the first mystery was bogus as well  Hyouka = Ice Cream. Really?    Infinite Stratos  Possibly the worst harem I've seen. I didn't like Seitokai no Ichizon's cast either but that had moments of hilarity. Char was the only character I didn't hate in the end and the final episode I didn't even watch fully (alt tabbing and did other things while the player was running)                 But why is it a terrible anime? You've just said that it's terrible without basing it on anything.  "Oh, that anime is terrible but i don't know why i just hate it! hurrdurr i just want to be like all the other people who hate it"  Before you say i'm some sort of fanboy, i don't even like SAO but just because i don't like it doesn't mean it's bad.        Mahou Sensou.  SAO just had some bad writing here and there, but Mahou Sensou was shit through-and-through. Forcing myself to finish even 2 episodes was horrendous.      And then they went on to claim they were a girl, as if to solidify they were nothing more than a shitposter.    But the MAL account was for a girl, it was either legit or someone with way too much time on thier hands     someone with way too much time on thier hands  Mate, this is the internet, and you're on /a/. EVERYONE here has too much time on their hands.      This reminds me of the time a MAL reviewer wrote a One Piece (anime) analysis and posted in on /a/.    Going to MAL, finding a weeb queen to impersonate and then coming up with original pasta is getting into dangerous territory   Honestly. Mahouka.  I get the oniisama meme and all that jazz, but the show is complete and utter garbage. There's no tension, because you know glorious tatsuya will overcome anything with literally zero effort. The parts where he isn't annihilating his enemies without breaking a sweat are boring as shit too. At least SAO was entertainingly bad.      Ctrl + f    no Kill la Kill   Kill la kill This thread would not be full without it!       Wizard barristers.   Blood + is my least favorite title by far.   Honestly, Valvrave. It's not "so bad it's good". It's just so bad it's awful.   It's one of those seasonal Sunrise productions that would be utterly irredeemable if I didn't watch them with /a/    lolnah   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dwk<wbr>ClIFBMEE</wbr>  [ ]  admittedly I did not make it past the opening  honestly most of the stuff that was posted here isn't even bad  but  well I'm a guy who unironically likes Musashi Gundoh so            Easily Wizard Barristers   Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite? Because they weren't too bad.       Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite?  Here https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ]     Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai   The first episode had some sleek animation in it. Everything afterwords was a train wreck, most notably their lack of budget for the last episode.  Also, the character designs were fucking ugly.     wtf is with all these comments? Its "What's the worst anime you've ever seen?" not "Name a popular anime you dislike and say it's the worst anime ever because /a/"  have none of you seen the crap that was chaos head  YOU ARE SUPER SPECIAL ANONS       this is horrible it souns like s butchered anime of animaniacs or something     Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite? Because they weren't too bad.   Wizard Barristers should have been a 1-episode special.  It goes from having a really exciting first episode that had some potential, to total shit.       Weiss Kreuz (it's shit) Lucky Star (talking about bread)    Wow, thanks for reminding me about this fucking abortion, you cunt      ok chaos;head isn't the greatest but the worst? i think that's a bit much. have you seen the vn?     "Name a popular anime you dislike and say it's the worst anime ever because /a/"  its just rebound. people hate hearing people jack off a series they didnt care for     At least we got some good reaction faces out of it.  I say while not posting any images.      wtf         It's not that bad but the game is superior in every way.    Pretty much this. The game shits over the show in every way.   Worst anime I've ever watched was Claymore. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. I guess the nice designs and art kept me barely strung along.  We all know 70% of anime is 90% garbage. So I'm sure there's worse out there, but I am not shy about dropping, so I haven't watched any.     What's wrong with Death Parade? It wasn't exceptional but definitely not bad either.      I like you.     Why did they turn Alicia into a tsundere bitch in the anime?    It disappointed me and never got better.   Ore Monogatari.  SUNAAAA   SUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   SUKIDA   SUNAAAAAAAAA   SUKIDAAAAAAAAAAA   YAMATOOOOOOOOOOOO   SUKIDAAAAAAAAAA   SUNAAAAAAAAAA            worst anime you're heard of  Mars of destruction and steel chromed regios were the shows that gave me a violent reaction   bottom of the barrel *bad* show you've never seen  Hatenkou Yuugi (pic related). I always post this one when "worst show" threads pop up, and it legitimatelt is the worst show I've ever watched. too bad that post typically gets lost in slews of "UR FAV ANIME, SAO, NARUTO,LOL" and other mid-tier stuff.   shows I really hated but many folks here loved  Anything by Ryukishi07 and anything by type moon,          She's only really a bit tsundere at the start of the game when Welkin first meets her. But other than that she's sound so they did kinda mess that up   Sacred Seven comes to mind.   forgot pic    I regret it, I regret everything, The ONE ANIME THAT I SHOULD HAVE DROP BEFORE PASSING EPISODE 3.    SAO and Naruto Shippuuden are both worse than Hatenkou Yuugi though. I've seen it, it's 4/10.   Worst I've seen is SAO, best I've seen is Berserk. ( I'm new to anime but I can tell you Berserk is great, I watch a lot of TV and it's probably in my top 3)   I would, but I'm afraid the ass-kicking might fix your fucking nose.     responding three hours later  Did you take a nap to gather courage?    I think it was 3 episodes, but it was 3 episodes of shit that I had to force myself to slog through.  The problem with these threads is that some of the worst anime where you think "Wow, this is technically terrible" are the most entertaining, and you really can't discount the entertainment factor.     The thing was Mirai Nikki was that it was just good enough to keep you watching, but not good enough to ever satisfy.    Fuck you, I had Fate/Stay trolling to do. And Escaflowne is still fucking shit.   There's no bad anime Just bad characters (or between us, bad taste)         /a/ hates Kill me Baby   What happened?         This.    KamiAso was actually enjoyable in a stupid way. The main girl actually something that resembled a spine.  And yeah, Diabolik Lovers (or Amnesia) is easily worse.  Only thing I can think of that was worse was that Megane-bu show, but that was mostly just boring as fuck.

Now he even gave his headband to Boruto and not his own daughter. Top kek, Kishi, never stop.     fat hinata  what?    Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?   Assuming OP has 8 billion people like we do that's 8 thousand people with conqueror's haki     Doubt the OP world has 8 billion (probably not even a billion), but there should certainly be a reasonable amount.
