[ How many of you plebs are waiting for the best girl? the one who stay on top and even the author of shieldbro says she's the best. <br><br> Mature <br> Bondage <br> Legs, tons of legs <br> Boobs <br> Pseudo-ass </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cerea is best girl  <br> HORSEFUCKER.</br>  caaaan somebody give me the pussy please  <br>That isn't Cerea, sorry to break it to you.</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Still is best girl</br>  <br>Should start next one with the Suu "not done till I say so" pic.</br>  <br>hahaha, nice meme.<br><br>I swear the anime has attracted the worst kind of people to this series.</br></br></br>  <br>Newfags?</br>  <br><br><br>All these horse bully's get pretty annoying.</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   Well, all the ratings about the girls made by Crab said Rachnee is the number one and Cere is the number 2. <br><br>That means Rachnee is the best girl.</br></br>  <br>That literally isn't Cerea though.</br>  Am I the only one who's hyped to finally here Zombina's full voice in the anime?<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/amXiceqtTto  [ ]<br><br>After hearing a few seconds of Zombina's voice in the Ending song I'm fucking hyped for her voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> ratings  <br>what?<br>popularity poll?</br></br></br>  these threads are damaged beyond repair  <br>I'll be more hyped when they release the full ED</br>  <br>We already knew that though.</br>  <br>How is it samefag when someone is replying to someone?</br>  Someone told me there's an uncensored version of episode one out there.<br><br>Am I being trolled?</br></br>  <br> Each Arachne is born with a different pattern <br>So are there other Arachne going around with hearts and lightning bolts on their ass, or are they all variations on the skull?</br></br>  <br>Your lying he never said that</br>  <br>Not even a spiderfag but that's a 10/10 pic.</br>  <br>It goes to show that people don't know what's good for them.<br><br> Don't know why that came into my head. Sometimes playing the devil's advocate bites big time. <br><br><br>I want to hear Manako's, myself, but then again I'd be happy with MON in general.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  how long until the figmas and statues come out?  daily reminder  <br>I think it all depends on the species of spider. Which means there's an arachne out there with a green/yellowish posterior with a black smiley face pattern.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4880267  <br>whats going on there<br>i dont get it</br></br>  <br> Not even a spiderfag <br>You'll join us soon enough.</br></br>  I thought the anime was pretty good, do most people agree?  In all seriousness, why can't we just agree that all girls are amazing. All of them have their specialties, and their disadvantages. No one girl can be best. Learn to appreciate all girls as best.   Papi can meet her dad anytime she wants as he is still with her mom <br> Cerea most likely could easily find her dad and would most likely be happy to see her <br> Miia will never meet her dad as her mom is a slut and he most likely hates Lamias <br><br>Isn't it sad?</br></br></br></br>   Yu doing an EXTREMELY calm and cool voice <br><br>Holy fuck what? I know she can do that but it's on a different level here.</br></br>  <br>Err, I like it and all, but how you guys don't get tired of have a 24/7 thread?</br>  <br>Protomen<br>The Good Doctor<br><br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vgGYwXYt3J0<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can just call Darling dad during sex</br>  Do nut forget  <br>Yes</br>   #<br>He already amounted to something, anon; he's the hero that Monster Musume deserves, but not the one who's the main character right now... So we'll bully him because he can take it... He's not our protagonist... He's a nervous guardian... A wheeled protector... A bike cop.</br>  <br> All of them have their specialties <br> Papi a useless </br></br>  <br>Best girl<br><br>And she doesn't have a brain scouring voice like Miia</br></br></br>  <br>Because as logical as it may sound, nobody likes the harem ending. It can only be one girl and no one else. Then again, it's less about whether or not the girl is best and more about your opinions on the matter and how they're superior to others.<br><br>At least that's my understanding. I've been known to be completely off base on a few things.</br></br></br>  <br>someone sacked it</br>  <br> Am I the only one who's hyped to finally here Zombina's full voice in the anime? <br> No. </br></br>  <br><br>You're assuming that all Monmusu species have the same psychological need for a father that humans do.</br></br>  <br>LMFAO, the horse fucker is rigging the votes</br>  <br>Yep. Another carpet bombing is in effect.</br>  <br>She's a natural born leader.</br>  MIIA BEST GIRL  <br> there will never be a dark knight spoof with bike cop </br>  <br>At first I thought this was supposed to be joke lyrics to the OP and tried to fit them. When are we going to get the lyrics translated?</br>  <br> Anal </br>  <br>I find it hilarious that Tio and Polt have yet to get a single vote.</br>  <br>Monstergirl wedding dresses gotta be a bitch to design.</br>  <br>Based on Miia's personality you can tell she would like one.<br><br>She wants Darling for herself and not share him with the snake pit.</br></br></br>  So we all agree that Centorea is literally /mlp/ tier trashgirl, right?  <br>I am so ready!</br>  <br> Horse fuckers are THIS insecure </br>  <br>No she is S+ teir. All girls S+ teir.</br>  <br>no , fucking retard you are as bad as the assholes that kept saying horo was furry.</br>  <br>How many weeks more till we get best girl?</br>  Can spiderlady ward off other spiders from entering darling's home? I dislike spiders (a lot) but like her. How would she feel if someone killed a spider in front of her?  <br>FUCK YEAH!</br>  <br> best girl <br> can fly, can carry you, can give you eggs <br> useless <br>I'm afraid sr. That your opinion is utterly shit</br></br></br></br>  What kind of monster girl would you like to see added to the harem?<br><br>On top of that, what would her personality be?</br></br>  <br>The only thing I agree to is that it's impossible to like her without being associated with that inhuman subset that had to be exiled to their own board.</br>  <br>Probably as bad as Mero would feel about eating fish<br><br>Or Papi about eating chicken<br><br> Not at all </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7 if they keep doing 2 chapters per episode.</br>  SPOT THE PILLOW SEIYUU  <br>I find it hilarious how Cerea tries to act all chivalry with her boring shit even though her whole race including her mother have a cucking tradition. That's pretty much why she's one of the worst girls along with Miia for being a jealousy gag.</br>  <br>Eyes went straight to Yuu.<br><br>She really is a force of nature.</br></br></br>  <br>Cow<br><br>With the existing Cow's personality<br><br>Just not as stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy crap, is that actually a thing in the manga? /a/, would you eat a delicious Papi-laid omelette?</br>  <br>Quite a few.</br>  <br>She'll eat you once you're done mating</br>  <br>Only one choice here, any other answer is objectively wrong.</br>  <br>Alraune seems nice. Though the tree lady counts as that doesn't she? <br><br>Moth girl? <br> Non-yandere version please </br></br></br></br>  <br>has this series ever had a Character Poll?</br>  <br>And I find it hilarious that the horse fucker has to rigg the votes because otherwise Cerea would be the same as Tio and Polt. 600 votes and counting LOL</br>   anime finally depicting gyaru as the disgusting as fuck girls they actually are <br><br>Based</br></br>  <br>What else do you expect from /mlp/?</br>  <br> is that actually a thing in the manga? <br>yeah<br>the egg laying scene was pretty lewd<br>I heard the author had to tone it down when thinking about the possible adaptation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bee/Wasp/Octopus/Flower<br><br>Fuck knows about personalities though</br></br></br>  <br>It had two. <br><br>Cerea won the first, Rachnera the second.</br></br></br>  <br>A few. Miia and Rachnee constantly swap for the number one spot. Strangely enough, though, a recent poll had Manako as the most popular MON member.</br>  <br>I can't wait till Kii lactation<br><br>How are they going to do that?</br></br></br>  <br>6 more after episode 2!</br>  <br>She has got the most developed character out of all of them?</br>  Episode 2 when?  <br>Okayado has been going through this list so far of girls.</br>  <br>Ushi Oni</br>  <br> Miia and Rachnee constantly swap for the number one spot <br>When did that happen?</br></br>  Why are people so jealous of the horse girl?   It's a papi episode   <br>Anime's been making fun of ganguro for years. They're basically the "dumb blondes" of Japan.</br>  <br>we salute you crabman</br>  <br>I know this is the work of one angry dude with a bot, but I like to think that if I were to go to /mlp/ right now, I'd see a thread linking to this poll with a plea to spam it for the good name of horsekind.</br>  <br>Because she is pretty popular and probably one of the most attractive ones. But that's my guess</br>  <br>Given how Seikon no Qwaser went, probably just do it straight up with some nipple fog.</br>  <br>What? No. They make them seem ditzy/slutty, but generally sexy/sexual. The girl from this episode was ugly as FUCK.</br>  <br>Still can't handle the stress though.</br>  <br>  Anyone Jealous of Horse pussy <br><br>Yeah I like good hygiene not filthy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But the manga did exactly the opposite anon kun</br>  <br>I'd like to see Tomo as a cowgirl<br><br>It would fit extremely well</br></br></br>  <br>Don't even like horse all that much but i really don't get why people always hate on her she is pretty cute.</br>  <br>there's a part where the FOG gets clear and with contrast abuse you see Miia Titty in the fog</br>  <br>Hornet.<br> queen hornet and her worker slaves tries to take over the world and rid it of all other monster girls <br> only mon can stop them  <br> darling gets kidnapped like the dopey fuck he is, has to defeat hornet army with his harem <br>Series needs an antagonist, it's becoming stagnant and cliched.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot you can't reply to your own posts.</br>  <br>You must have trouble looking in the mirror then.</br>    <br>Who da fuck voted John the Baptist?</br>   airing the same season as jitsu wa watashi <br><br>How unfortunate are they? They share similarish stuff.</br></br>  <br>It will never happen anon just let go.</br>  <br>Here's one that hasn't been proxy'd to death<br>http://strawpoll.me/4879011</br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4880382  <br>See my problem with her is Cerea's boring ass personality. It doesn't help that she's so chivalry all the time.<br><br>If you compare her to the other monster girls she's like one of the worst ones with Miia being the same as well.</br></br></br>  <br> carpet bombed poll <br> hurrrr Cerea won <br>Why can't you horse fuckers just accept that your girl is a boring piece of shit and objectively the worst girl?</br></br></br>  <br> no Succubus option </br>  <br>Scylla when?</br>  <br><br>Fuck off with these autistic strawpolls, get your waifu wars somewhere else.</br></br>  A mimic.<br><br>She would be a mix of rachnee and suu, but with a little bit more rape. She would always be in the background being extremely obvious but the MC would fall for it anyway.</br></br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  Mia vs Mia's Mom<br><br> panics </br></br>  <br>  Cereafags denying how disgusting Horse pussy truly is. <br><br>Truly some delusional fans.</br></br></br>  <br>someone didn't attend catholic school as a child</br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br> Implying there weren't other previous polls that got bombarded with cobwebs and lolidevils. <br>Straw poll a shit.</br></br>  <br> sperging that hard </br>  <br> Because she is pretty popular </br>  <br>I want a worst girl straw poll. I'd make one, but I'm on a phone</br>  <br>What are you even talking about most of these girls are horribly one dimensional. For the most part only Cerea, Mia and Rachnee have actual characters to them besides just boobs. I mean Cerea's character is that she wants to come off as a strong person but is deep down inside pretty shy and goofy also she is pretty clumsy. What you are saying is completely false and just incorrect.</br>  <br>Nice dodge. Though you don't deserve those quads. Besides, I only have eyes...well, eye, for one girl, and it ain't Cerea.</br>  <br>Will this get animated?</br>  <br> implying Centorea would sully herself and her master's name by having such poor hygiene </br>  <br>At least Cerea has a personality, even if chivalry isn't your thing. <br><br>But Miia's pretty much just "I Want Darling's Dick: The End."</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yes the girl from episode 1 it was. I was referring to the other gyrau character that you definitely know because you had read the manga already</br>  every girl is the best girl<br>except the one you like<br>she is the worst girl</br></br>  <br>Not sure why, but half of them look to me like they're doing the thumb through fist gesture, even though I know that's just them with clenched fists and thumbs on top.</br>  <br>This guy seems to get that most of the girls are really just a pair of boobs.</br>  <br> like all girls <br> they are all worst girls </br></br>  <br>  Cerea and Miia have actual character. <br><br>Well this is a new one because they're the shittiest characters in the series that suffered from the harem curse.</br></br></br>  <br>Miia cooked and ate it because someone put it in the fridge. Indirect cunnulingus.</br>  <br>Even Papi?</br>  does anyone have a picture of what crabman actually looks like in real life?  <br>Isn't it true that at the age foals start galloping, human babies can't hold their heads up yet? What would happen? Would their heads be dangling while they run around?</br>    <br>Yes, we wouldn't want to destroy the sanctity of a fucking harem manga with waifu wars.</br>    <br>Christ I hope so. For Cereafags and Miafags.</br>  <br>thats a scorpion you dumb bastard</br>  Played through all of MGQ but never got into the monster girl theme.<br><br>Is the manga worth picking up?<br><br>First episode was alright, sad it was just one girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They showed Darling pondering lamia bathroom habits, so probably.</br>  <br>Your just the same faggot who keeps saying over and over again how shit Cerea and Mia are. Ok dude we get it you don't like them now fuck off and talk about the series</br>  <br><br>But that's a scorpion.<br><br> Scorpion girl when? </br></br></br></br>      <br>theres some doujin that had one, it was kinda hot</br>  <br> barely-in-the-manga-chan best girl <br>Surely you jest</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck you, I couldn't find a half man half crab pic.</br></br>  <br>hey, crabman</br>  <br>We, papiposters are the only ones who can enjoy the delight of a sweet big booty<br><br> titstards will never know this feel </br></br></br>  <br>What the hell, succubus</br>  <br> titstards <br><br>Could you come up with an insult that rolls off the tongue more awkwardly?</br></br></br>  <br>papi is #1 imo</br>  <br>Have you seen Cerea's ass?</br>  <br> But who is Ms. Smith? <br> 1. appeal for any faggot who reads this series and wants to feel superior liking the one human girl <br> 8 votes (47%) <br> 2.

From what we've seen Monmusu have zero emotional connection to animals they happen to physically resemble.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mimic <br>I've heard of barrel-chested, but not box-chested.</br></br>  <br>Sorry poco English.

Honestly, unless you enjoy seeing girls with safety sacks/oven-mitts over their stingers, it's doubtful Okayado would introduce any girls with easily-deployed poison-injecting implements(Miia's and Rachnee's fangs are pretty easy to conceal/cover, vs hornet/scorpion girls' tails).

Same question goes for mermaids.  <br><br> Fantasy-Cyborgs <br><br>12 Beast already has the Fantasy equivalent of Robots.<br>A race of naturally-occurring cyborgs with primitive cybernetic implants would be kind of cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miia <br> interesting personality <br> Mero <br> bottom-of-the-barrel personality-wise <br>How can someone be this wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still waiting for a fairy-girl. </br>  <br>Arachneras lay eggs but just one or few, unlike spiders that lay hundreds.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127861286 <br>My prediction is that her mom is a completely pure, non-lewd super-doting grandma type who, while disapproving of Rachnera being a "wild child", dotes on both her and Darling and sues her silk to knit sweaters for Darling. She also constantly urges Rachnera to make a move on him because he is such a "fine young man".</br>  <br><br> Papi <br> more interesting personality than Cera <br><br>Literally what.<br><br>Papi's characterization has been almost exclusively "retard with a heart of gold" up until this point.<br><br>I don't even like Cera, but come on man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hens lay unfertilized eggs all the time, also THEY EAT THEM  <br>One does not "fuck" the centaur pussy. One makes love to it, with plenty of tender  finger-twining , along with  hand-holding , and finishing off with  arm-swinging .</br>  <br><br> But that's not what characterizes bestiality. <br>It's what characterizes it psychologically.<br><br> Either all monster girls are bestiality (because they are not fully human) or none of them are (because they are able to reproduce with humans). <br>Wrong. There are shades to this. And no, something doesn't have to be EXCLUSIVELY animal to appeal to people with a penitent for bestiality.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon pls<br><br><br>Still better than "generic female paladin #2947".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am really creeped out by spiders. I prefer papi, suu, the dullahan who's name I can't remember right now, and   Ms Smith .</br>  <br> It's not gay if its a girl with a dick!!! </br>  <br>because only retards get in the box, and only a retard wouldnt have taken the rapey spider by now</br>  <br>exactly. Best girl never wins.</br>  <br>Hopefully this one looks less shit than the job I did with Tio.<br><br>Now back to trying to finish Doppel.</br></br></br>  Y'all betta be watching in glorious 1080, quality bigger than Centorea's tits  <br>It's not animated in 1080p, so who cares? Just hit full-screen, it'll look the same as an upscale.</br>   you will never cuddle with a monster girl <br> you are surrounded by boring humanshit <br>At least VR will come soon</br></br>  <br><br>Arachnaes lay eggs, and similar to how spiders sometimes lay eggs in the corpse of a dead insect in their web, Arachnaes lay their eggs  in the rectum and intestines of their lover with an ovipositor, complete with a nice big enema composed of fluid nutrients, and let the male carry the eggs to term until their ready to hatch in a bastardized but somehow sexy version of pregnancy .</br></br>  <br>Kaiju girls when?</br>  <br> It's what characterizes it psychologically <br>That's even more equivocated, because centaurs have human minds and you can actually connect with them in a psychological level. Sure, you're fucking a horse body at the end, but what if you're getting a tailjob from a lamia, or even a blowjob as they also have inhuman tongues? Neither of these things are bestiality per se, despite the fact you could interpret them as such.<br><br> And no, something doesn't have to be EXCLUSIVELY animal to appeal to people with a penitent for bestiality. <br>Isn't that another issue though? Lamias and other species might as well appeal to people who are into bestiality, since their inhuman features are also presented in a sexualized manner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying that, yes, if you want to fuck horse-pussy, you have a penitent for bestiality.</br></br>  <br>Whelp.. I am glad there is no Wasp Girl<br><br> That's a big bitch</br></br></br>  <br>well hello boner!</br>  <br>For you</br>  <br>So if you want to fuck any monster part of their bodies you have a penitent for bestiality?</br>  <br> He hasn't read Chapter 20. </br>  <br><br>When the Monster-part is identical in shape, size, texture, biology and structure to an animal, yes.</br></br>  <br>I have. I meant girls that are kaiju-sized in their natural state.</br>  <br>So a wing-job, a spinneret-job, a throat-job, also bestiality?</br>    <br><br>It could potentially be argued to be, but personally I don't consider it anywhere near on the same level.<br><br>Again, there are levels of abstraction to these things.<br>What you listed has many degrees of abstraction away from intercourse with an animal.<br>Fucking a centaur in their centaur pussy which is indistinguishable from a horse is not quite as far away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That last one's necrophilia.</br>  <br> personally <br>Well, that explains it.</br></br>  <br> implying that fucking snake tails or spinnerets isn't bestiality because they are bigger </br>  <br> tfw you will never fuck an otachi girl </br>  <br>So classic Harpy(like the ones in that Torii-Kiss cafe manga, girl's head on bird body) would be bestiality to you?</br>  <br><br>Now try to Imagine rachnee explaining that to MC while they make sweet arachno-love.</br></br>  What times does this air?  <br>What, you never jacked-off an anaconda by the tail while exploring the Amazon?</br>  <br>Right now nigga, get hype.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/anichart/</br>  <br>It saddens me to say it, but  no. ;_; </br>  <br>That pregnant belly is a nice touch.</br>   Licensed by Sentai <br><br>Well...fuck.</br></br>  <br>I recommend fingering its cloaca, maybe even stick your sharpie in.

Okayado needed a joke he could milk for a while in regards to Miia.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever held a snake?</br>  <br>I think it would be cute to see Cerea trying to belly dance. Much blush will be seen.</br>  <br><br> Miia wouldn't be nice enough to let you move your legs over the course of six hours. <br><br>That's a pretty weak assumption, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  because they are venomous predators <br>Nah, even non-venomous snakes are abhorrent to people.<br><br> Good thing Lamias aren't snakes <br>Most of their bodies are.<br><br> Okayado needed a joke he could milk for a while in regards to Miia <br>I know, she has nothing else going for her other than that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hellhound</br>  <br><br>What is this picture supposed to prove?</br></br>  <br>And with this last one from the ED, I'm done.<br><br> God that took 12 hours, now I remember why I quit doing these in one sitting after Star Driver finished airing. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's a matter of kindness.</br>  <br><br>Dear Loen,<br><br>Please stop harassing me. If you continue assaulting me like this, I will get the authorities involved.<br><br>Signed,<br>Anon's Penis</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nah, even non-venomous snakes are abhorrent to people. <br>That's called fear-psychology Anon.<br>Harmless snakes incite a fear-reaction because they are indistinguishable to the harmful venomous snakes that people have a reason to fear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything about this ED only makes me think how much better a MON spinoff would be compared to the main story.</br>  <br>That without notes you'd call them all snakes for they look like snakes.</br>  <br><br> I think it would be cute to see Cerea trying to belly dance. <br><br>That's true of every girl though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a anime girl version of Crimson Typhoon from Pacific Rim</br>  <br><br>Will you do a lewd version?<br><br> Please. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yea, but if Cerea and hell, even Rach-nee did most would have to go to the hospital for a heart attack.</br>  <br>It's alright, Darling plays a pretty good straight man to everything that's going on around him.</br>  <br><br>She still makes a cool organic-looking cyborg.</br></br>  <br>But that's wrong, you can easily distinguish nonvenomous snakes from venomous ones, some by size alone. Not to mention they can also be harmful.<br><br>The reason people find them disgusting is much more simple. It's because they are these weird, scaly things that slither around and hiss at you.</br></br></br>  <br>I would still prefer Coyote Tango or Striker Eureka</br>  <br>Kaiju monstergirls when</br>  <br> It's because they are these weird, scaly things that slither around and hiss at you <br>And because they have no legs.<br><br>What kind of unholy beast has no legs?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Mero having a bigger bust than Miia <br><br>....Is this cannon?<br>I know Mero has Mermaid Blubber, but I thought Miia's were still supposed to be bigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dear Anon's Penis,<br><br>No.<br><br>Signed,<br>Loen<br><br>Never nipples and vagoo anon, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The girls bust sizes are the most inconsistent part of the manga</br>  Is this creature from /a/?<br><br>OP: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gX7<wbr>kZoDmXf4</wbr>  [ ]<br>ED: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yfo<wbr>EyZbKMaM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>100% /jp/</br>  <br> The manga have nearly 100 chapters, why start discussing it just now?<br><br> Fucking casuals.</br></br></br>  <br>How much of a cunt she is shows up even more in the anime.</br>  <br>i know that fuking faggot, because the episode 01 is out fukin onlymangafag</br>  <br><br> Go fuck yourself you only anime filthy scum, the day you actually develop a taste we can talk</br></br>  <br> Mangaonly fags getting ass blasted over superior anime watchers enjoying things <br><br>Don't you have a shounen shit thread to go post spoilers in?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit,its not a short? Fuck yes.</br>  <br>20min</br>  <br>Why does everyone hate shorts so much? I think they are good too especially with comedy but all the time I see shit like "Holy shit this looks great. Oh, it's a short. Pass."</br>  <br>I thought it was a short too.</br>  <br>It only shows up more in the anime because the anime just started. She is a turbofag early in the manga too, people just forget it since she's been mellow for so long now and the focus shifts to her hanging out with her friends that you forget what an ass she can be.<br><br>She starts chilling out when the other girls start showing up which coincidentally should begin next episode since they're already at Ebina's introduction. It's a gradual change in the manga so I'm interested to see how it comes out in the anime. They'll still devote time to her being an asshole but I assume Dogakobo knows what to focus on as the anime progresses.<br><br>It's a lot better when they move away from the "haha she's an ass to her brother" jokes anyway. The focal point nstead just becomes about her and her friends. The anime seems like it'll follow that (it's introduced Sylphin and Kirie earlier than in the manga and the ED is completely focused on the four of them)<br><br>she'll still be a faggot to oniichan for a few more episodes but she does mellow out eventually. plus once taihei is allowed to be a unique character instead of just "angry brother who reacts to her bullshit" he's better too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to eb Ebina's ebin bina's.  <br>I swear if I find out that you're lying.</br>  <br><br> manga vs anime adaptations <br>Please stop this bullshit. 90% of the time the anime adaptation is worse. Stop being so fucking angry about pointless shit.<br><br><br>This is true. <br>The manga gets much better when it becomes more about the interactions between the characters rather than the main sibling gags.<br><br> Sylphin a best </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why won't he just kill her?  <br>I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws fucking all my shit up all the time, and it ain’t like I can pop a cap in their ass and not hear about it Thanksgiving time<br><br>-Proposition Joe</br></br></br>  <br>Go home Alex your drunk.<br><br>Mother complex and he's a good oniichan</br></br></br>  Animeonlyfag here. <br><br>Is Ebina mentally retarded?</br></br>  <br>she's from the country so she's kind of a simple hick<br><br>quietly a top tier girl though</br></br></br>  <br>Why?!!!?</br>  Something is seriously wrong when your computer screen is bigger than your TV. <br><br>Also why do nips put the TV and PC on the ground? a 2-3ft high table surely can't hurt.</br></br>  <br>I've only seen the first episode and I haven't read the manga.<br><br>She doesn't seem like a cunt to me at all. Spoiled brat, sure, but not a malicious person. She got mad at her brother not because he didn't buy her sweets, she got mad at him because they didn't get to play video games all day together like he promised.<br><br>That's a clear sign she really likes him and wants to spend time with him.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw the fucking School Days boat reference   I remember reading the manga years ago but dropping it after about 20 chapters because it was the same shit every time - the younger sister is a lazy, spoiled girl who gets her way all the time with no repercussions.<br><br>Watched the first episode and it started well but by the second half it had become the same old boring shit.<br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  <br> TFW you'll never have a sister get mad at you for not living up to a promise to play video games with her all day. </br>  Seems like the perfect /a/ poster.  <br>You basically pegged what Umaru really is. She's honestly a good person deep down and she and her brother care about each other. That gets more apparent over time.<br><br>Most people won't see it that way though, which is unfortunate.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like her the most because being that spoilt is cute.</br>  <br> an anime starts out the same way the manga does <br>wow tell me more</br></br>  I want to fuck her chibi.  <br>A bit, although Kirie and her brother Bomber are too. Or maybe socially retarded is more accurate for them.</br>  <br>It feels like it's trying to be cringe comedy. Like a shittier Watamote. Does a pretty good job making me disgusted with that filthy fucking NEET hamster girl though.<br><br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>Absolutely disgusting. How is she not fat</br></br></br></br>  <br>well her brother has a table, I think she just likes laying on the floor for kicks</br>  <br>Shimoneta was pretty different from how the manga began.<br><br>It was made a shit manga into a good anime when it is usually the reverse.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's fucking stupid. The smugness was the appeal factor for me. Does that mean she'll be in her chibi form for much less/none at all? Guess I'm dropping it.</br>  <br>She's a moeblob for pretty much a majority of the series.</br>  <br>No lies, only best girls<br><br><br>She still uses it a ton and is still lazy in general but isn't just an asshole to her brother. they still do a ton of jokes and shit but it isn't just a one-note gag<br><br>either way she's still going to exploit the brother for a while in the anime until they get through all the characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Dogakobo <br> pick no-name VAs <br> they're fucking perfect <br><br>they can't keep getting away with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're gonna mess up bad one day, but not today.</br>  <br>She didn't eat anything else all day and the cola was probably sugarless</br>  Someone needs to make a .webm of the maracas part in the OP.  <br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>I remember when I could do that, I'd chug entire gallon bottles.<br><br>Now more than half a glass feels like way too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>really easy to eat a bunch of shit when your metabolism is probably at it's peak and you're playing sports constantly</br>  <br>Those absolute madman's how do they do that</br>  <br>there are a couple but none of them loop perfectly like they need to</br>  <br><br>There was two of them in the last thread if it's still up.</br></br>  <br>oops posted a still</br>  What material is the hood made of?    <br><br> little to no lewd of chibi form, let alone normal form </br></br>  <br>Her pubic hair.</br>  <br>Oniichan's tears and sweat.</br>  They did a good job of sticking Kirie in the background of most of the school shots, walking behind/watching Umaru. I didn't even notice her in this scene until I saw it a few times since all my attention was on Sylphin.  <br> That constant blushing at Umaru. </br>  <br>They might spend a large amount of time trying out different VAs, just because they are no-name doesn't mean they are just picked at random.</br>  <br>How can someone that spends her time doing nothing and eating crap get to be so beautiful that everyone blushes at the sight of her?</br>  <br>Kirie in particular is turboyuri</br>  <br>Worst imouto ever. <br><br>It is oniichan's fault for not raising her properly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fantasy, son. Stop looking for logic and enjoy the Himouto hijinks.</br>  <br>she's 16, some teenagers are crazy mutants who maintain perfect bodies no matter how shitty they treat themselves.<br><br>When her mid 20s come around all that junk food and sedentary activity is going to hit her like a ton of bricks.</br></br></br>  This is literally /a/non:The Anime  <br>Anon isn't a skillful and beautiful girl outside of his home though</br>  <br>With an actually girl and not a fat old fuck in a magical girl cosplay.</br>  Hime Imouto or Hiki Imouto?  <br>Himono no imouto</br>  Kirino is like an angel if you comparing to that girl.  <br>Fuck no. Kirino makes Mao Zedong look like an angel in comparison.</br>  <br>dried fish?</br>  <br>As in she fucks like a dried squid.</br>  <br>doesn't kirino hit her "friends" and try to fuck her brother? shes a scumbag to the core, umaru at least actually cares for her friends<br><br><br>yes<br><br>excuse the shitty TN misspellings, Norway scans blow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it's usually Hyperthyroidism, that shit effects girls more than boys.<br><br>You'll notice this when you eat a ton of crap and don't gain any weight whatsoever, producing hormones by the bucketloads. This leads to hyper metabolism which allows you to process any type of food and not gain weight.<br><br>However the downsize to all this, if left untreated a fuck ton of shit happens, hallucinations, heart problems the works. The downside for men, men are very unlikely to get this disease happens in 5 times more in women.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not very cute though.</br>  <br><br>Fuck i meant downside not downsize.</br></br>  <br>Except we are inside. That's the point. /a/ is not disgusting dirty men, but cute lolis.

She does fuck her brother though. <br><br>Both characters mature over time and that's the point. This anime is going to have the exact same problem as Oreimo though because the people these anime attract are retards who can't comprehend a character who isn't strictly static.</br></br></br>  I'm going to buy some cookies with chips so I can try her eating technique it is so simple yet I've never thought to try and utilize it  <br> Dropping Prop Joe quotes in a Himouto thread <br>You're a good dude.</br></br>  <br>More like, retards who call anyone a cunt as soon as they do one thing they don't like.</br>  Based dogakobo does it again.<br><br>This could be my AOTS, i can feel it already.</br></br>  <br>it's actually what every /a/ poster looks like, info 100%<br><br> LPT: using a tripcode reduces your chances of becoming a moeblob </br></br></br>  my uncle's boyfriend told me he read the manga and it later turns into an incest story please tell me that's not true I watch ep 1 and enjoyed it but I will drop this shit if it turns to some sister fucking show  <br><br>We're just living in the moment.</br></br>  <br>Isn't she supposed to be in another class?</br>  <br>Are you saying you wouldn't fuck your sister even if she was a 10?<br> <br>Do you suck dicks too?</br></br></br>   umaruun~   <br>It's a 1DK, they sleep in the same room, their PCs are right next to each other, I bet imouto knows what type of porn he's into.<br><br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Umaru <br> Ebina <br>What's with the caveman names?</br></br></br>  <br>only those who don't have sisters/never lived with a women outside of their mothers are into fucking sisters <br><br>it's a shitty trope in anime tbh</br></br></br>  <br>I have 3 sisters.

I was apathetic to school as fuck. Grades were easy. Teachers were lax. I had a great time not paying attention to school.</br>  Dogakobo did fucking splendidly with the material here. Impressive, as usual.  <br/>  <br> nobody knows you're actually umaru-chan when you shitpost </br>  <br> that poster that just called you a cuck is actually a beautiful woman who is too autistic to talk to her friends at school about her actual interests <br>weird feel</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there's some of her chibi form on pixiv.</br>  I fucking hate this little shit what the hell's wrong with you guys<br><br> Why can't I stop watching? </br></br>    I feel bad for Sylphy ;_;  <br><br>I couldn't stop thinking about this scene when I was at work today. I immediately re-watched that part when I got home. It's just too good.</br></br>  This is some big bang theory level shit. Dropped.  <br>Umaru's slovenly habits are basically reality for a lot of otaku, unlike BBT's half assed "such a nerd"s.</br>    <br>it's a kind of magic</br>  <br> shitposters are actually cute girls </br>  <br><br>Do you have the slow-mo jump to the bed? <br><br>Weird how the tantrum scene ended up looking in the episode.

It was announced as a full lenght anime. Nichijou's manga had the same format and they made a full lenght anime out of it. Nozaki-kun was a 4-koma and they made a full lenght anime out of it.

Gonna watch it when I get home.<br><br>So this is about... a split personality imouto?</br></br></br>  <br>It's hard feeling superior to people when you're a hardcore weeaboo.

I like him.</br>  Judging from the ED, is the show going to involve the other girls more? I want this more to be about cute girls having fun together, rather than a cunty little sister throwing tantrums and a doormat brother always bending backwards and accommodating her.  <br>the whole plot is that her friends don't know and she works to keep it hidden from people<br><br><br><br> Kirie, the only very blatant turboyuri in the series, falling for someone who is working to destroy the object of her affections <br>i know you guys like to self-insert as Alex but calm the fuck down</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes it does, anon. <br>Trust me, I'm a lawyer</br></br>  <br>Stop shitposting you faggot. What you're doing is no better, and argubly worse since you're baiting shit on an 8 hour post</br>  <br>The manga has arcs that focus on introducing Ebina (this will happen probably next episode), Kirie, and Sylphin. Sylphin has the best arcs devoted to her. Once all the girls are introduced and they become friends, the focus shifts to that as the main draw of the series. Umaru's still a lazy shit at home but she mellows out a lot and takes it easier on her brother and they grow closer.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127848626 <br>Is this the fate of all Ebina's from here on out?</br>    <br>Kirie is very blatantly devoted to Umaru and Sylphin is pretty gay for Umaru's "TSF" persona but the series is more about familial love than anything.<br><br>Ebina x Umaru's brother is the only true good het pairing.</br></br></br>  This adaption is perfect.  <br>I bet she browses JP /v/</br>  <br> Kirie is very blatantly devoted to Umaru and Sylphin is pretty gay for Umaru's "TSF" persona <br><br>that's all the gay I need, thanks</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and the OP is gold<br><br><br>Honestly it's blatantly about friendship with Kirie having intense devotion towards Umaru. <br><br>Every other relationship is completely platonic and you need some goggles for anything more. There is literally nothing but strong friendship between UMR and TSF</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i won't say to look into it too much because i doubt they'd ever pull the trigger on it considering what type of manga it is but im sure you're used to that by now</br>  <br>but does umaru ever show interst in another boy precisely her onii-chan?</br>  im calling it now S1 ending at ch 68  <br>see the translator notes in <br><br>Umaru and Taihei are very devoted to each other but mostly in a familial way. Umaru never really shows interest in anyone else, and the only other boys in the manga are the oniichans.<br><br>Ebina is super in love with Umaru's brother anyway</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well then it should be fine, the pairing will most likely happen then</br>  <br> precisely <br>What?<br><br>Umaru shows tons of love to her oniichan. <br>Oniichan x Kongou or Oniichan x Ebina are heavily hinted at. Oniichan probably has a mother complex.<br><br>Umaru and her friends are pretty much just friends with Kirie being insanely devoted, but Umaru seems to feel no romantic feelings to anyone at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   that gccx referance <br><br>Can't wait till Arino shows up later</br></br>  I wish all the characters would find out the truth and put together the connection already. I want everyone and their Onii-chans hanging out.  <br>They're gonna drag this shit out as long as they can, but it is frustrating that Bomber, Kirie, and Sylphin are all too retarded to realize that Komaru and TSF are just Umaru<br><br><br> stopping before the soccer arc <br>no, my heart can't take it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we get the tournament arc and tennis though, which are both filled with best girl so im good</br>  <br>I was upset when she didn't go through with this. Also that Taihei just didn't say anything to Ebina or her brother about knowing the other.</br>  <br>Her imouto magic is too powerful.</br>  <br>You're not living your life correctly.<br><br><br>It s the internet: you never know.</br></br></br></br>  Did this anime screen well with the elevens?  <br>wait for the BDs</br>  <br>this one was the fucking worst<br><br> have huge confession scene <br> don't follow up for a bunch of chapters <br><br>I'm ok with it being about finding her brother because every imouto needs an oniichan but goddamn don't jerk me around like this<br><br>They keep teasing Umaru confessing her double lives and I know they're not going to reveal it to her friends for a long time but still, it's some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fun though and I think I'll enjoy it for longer. More Sylphin interacting with Umaru or UMR is great<br><br><br>It got a mediocre rating of 77% good. <br>Manga sales are more important though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I believe it was like 74% positive. Someone posted the results in the last big thread I think.</br></br>  <br>Massive bait. I was expecting the next chapter to be a confession or something but it was actually about her brother. <br><br>Shows you this manga really is about sibling relationships. I hope Ebina's oniichan comes into play again though and they meet.</br></br></br>  <br>They nailed it on so many accounts, I didn't expect such a good adaptation<br><br> the music <br> that tantrum scene <br> Sylphin in motion <br> doing things like throwing Kirie in the background following Umaru <br><br>and most of all<br><br> the VAs <br>Sylphins is literally perfect, and Kiries is great because I expected some Tomoko knockoff instead of the deep voice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How is she not a horrible fat slob? <br>Teenagers can usually eat a fair amount without gaining weight, she probably doesn't eat much for lunch at school so that she looks dainty in front of classmates.<br><br> How does she get perfect grades if she hardly ever studies? <br>Good genetics</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do jap girls scratch their stomachs when they are being lazy?</br>  <br>I hope they keep it up so we get more of best girl. <br><br>All of her arcs are the best part of the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for the NTR doujins where Umaru comes home to her brother fucking Ebina.</br>  <br>Watamote is even more trash than this. Don't kid yourself.</br>  <br>Sylphin's laugh is flawless<br><br><br>It did ok. The manga seems more popular than I expected. I'd like to think the anime will gain more traction as the focus moves toward all the girls but who knows, maybe Japan will drop it after the first episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Always believe in Dogakobo</br>  <br>This is weird comparison, since they're nothing alike in the type of humour even if the concept is similiar.</br>  Why is Umaru the worst girl in this show?  <br>Because other than her multiple personality autism she's honestly kind of bland.</br>  <br><br>Alex is cool guy and second best onii-chan</br></br>  <br>Do people enjoy reading manga upside down?</br>  <br>As if it matters when it's Jumpu</br>  <br><br>has optometry found a cure for this?!</br></br>  <br>I sometimes do it, actually, but mainly that's because I shift position a lot when reading anything.</br>  <br>I want to know the cause.</br>  <br>A cure for perfection?</br>  <br><br>I think that Ebina's case is worse, is not normal for a person to blush that much</br></br>  <br><br>You don't read upside down?</br></br>  <br>she has erythrophobia</br>  S2 when?  Reminder that Umaru likes Oreomo  <br>from the country and can't swim. you lie anon.</br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br><br>So Sylphy and Alex, you can guess where it goes</br></br>  <br>nah for real, she's like from a farm or something. none of her family lives in whatever city the manga takes place in</br>  <br>I read sitting, because I only read it on the computer.</br>  If you were having sex with Umaru and she suddenly shrank to her tiny self half-way through, would you keep going?  <br>They feel the desire of a big black cock in their stomache</br>  <br>Are girls that can't swim more moe, anons?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>But earnest hardworkers like Sylphin are even more moe.<br><br><br>It's alternative universe oreomo obviously.

I don't think he touched him as a kid, though that would've been good too. PTSD!Law sounds pretty good. Let that slut suffer.<br><br>Not gay, and well. I'm a masochist so Doffy is perfect to me.<br><br>That would be acceptable.</br></br></br></br></br>   Why would Kuzan join BB???? <br><br>Consider Blackbeard from an in world perspective rather than an omniscient reader perspective.<br><br>Kuzan is disgruntled with WG, hell, even Akainu is.<br><br>Blackbeard wants to destroy it, he doesn't kill unless he has no other way, he's got the same gift of recruiting strong people as Luffy.<br><br>He recruited Kuzan, it is Oda's way of telling us no Luffy won't automatically have stronger ally than Luffy.<br><br>Remember Hao from Shaman King?

Now I have no idea how their quest is supposed to tie with Strawhats, Shanks seems so far away from everything that is happening.<br><br>Speaking of Yonkos, I'm surprised Kuzan is with the Blackbeards, although I'm not certain if he is part of the crew or just has agreements with them.

The entire plan was to provoke Kaidou to take down Doflamingo, not attack him, right?</br></br>  <br>Legbeards aren't girls.</br>  <br>is that your definition of fun?</br>  <br>The shounen genre is actually quite popular among us. Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. There's something for everyone. <br><br>Kizaru a piece of shit. I've never understood why people like him.</br></br></br>  <br>SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies so they fled with their tumblr fanfics to One Piece.</br>  <br>trap, trans, fag you guys don't know what to call yourselves anymore but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies</br>  <br>Law. He's like a walking fujobait.</br>  <br>Just because you whack off your wang doesn't make you a girl, Bill.</br>  <br>They're all you'll ever get though. NEETs don't deserve any better.</br>  <br> 1337 <br><br>The chosen one has spoken.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's somekind of huge creature working for Kaido. It has tentacles, and those tentacles are so huge, its sucktion cups were what we saw sucking Capone's ship up in the air. Capone is now working for Kaido and his job is to capture Caesar so that Kaido can keep getting those SMILEs. That creature is bigger than Kraken so it might be even different species. Rogue Sea king, artificial creature or other mythical beast maybe?</br></br>  <br> Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. <br>So then the same reason the rest of /a/ watches PreCure.</br></br>  <br>Hey, don't talk shit about my legs, they're always smooth as fuck.</br>  <br>People like him because he's a piece of shit that looks like he stars in JAVs in his spare time.</br>  <br>How can he just quit when he was drafted?</br>  <br> SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies <br>How so?</br></br>  <br>It did ? How ?<br>Hell I remember last month chapter included ErwinLevi fujobait.</br></br>  <br>Capone is working for Big Mom.</br>  I am so fucking hyped for Vegapunk.  <br> but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies <br>And yet some guys wonder why they can't ever put their dick in anything but a hoover and their dog's anus.</br></br>  <br>By mutiny.<br><br>Like he just did this chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but I can</br>  Will Green Bull also be a huge moralfag? Maybe Akainu should do a psychology test instead of hiring them for their height and fighting power.  <br>At least we still have a dick.</br>  <br><br> can't deal with any marines at all until he catches lawhat <br> never chases them <br> never has to do marine stuff ever again, can't be redrafted or forgiven </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is by far the best Law pic out there.</br>  <br>Oda copped out on Smoker.<br><br>Smoker didn't even get any new stitches on his face despite Dofla just making new and new bloody scars all over his face.<br><br>It's bullshit when he gets bandages on his body instead when Dofla attacked his face more than his body.<br><br>Guess Oda can't have a disfigured Smoker in his kiddy manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When Freud said girls wanted a dick, he was referring to the priviledge that goes with it. Not the actual thing.<br>Also technically they do have one. It's called a clit.</br></br>  <br>Dressrosa happened. Law became pseudo-main character. Doffy was shown to have a soft side for his family. Caring-dad figure, decent looking character that wears makeup. Trap-boy that likes wearing high-heels. There are three points in one piece that had a sudden influx of new readers. Enies Lobby, Marine Ford, and now Dressrosa. This influx is the era of fujos.</br>  <br>No it's not.</br>  This damn chapter hyped me too much, I ended up dreaming about it. I was desperately trying to call the Heart Pirates to say "To Dressrosa! Your captain is in danger!" because I thought they had a submarine and I can't remember if I was even able to call them. I was using something weird to contact them, not a regular phone, but not a den den mushi either. I don't know. What the fuck  <br>I don't care about Smoker I only care about Vegapunk.</br>  Shit more happened or was revealed in this chapter than in the last 50 on dressrosa<br>Shanks is gonna get BTFO by Kid and company but never shown until one chapter hundred weeks from now like BB Vs. Ace was so it'll be short and sweet (i really hope they speed up the road to raftel by doing this)<br>It's shown that Doffy was practically the Fifth Emperor in term of connections and power<br>Luffy is gonna have another pirate gang hot on his trail right after this arc<br><br>Did I miss anything?<br><br>Man I love the sea politics chapter way more than the fightan, but I am still hype for what's next</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that memebase and 9gag love shanks<br><br>Memebase and 9gag epic BTFO</br></br>    <br>look at the bonsai trees you idiot, this is probably Wano and the outline is a japanese styled building</br>  <br> because I thought they had a submarine <br>But they do have a submarine.</br></br>    <br>I didn't like Kizaru either at first but his jokey kind of attitude grew on me over time</br>  Kaido will be Godzilla Zoan.<br>Luffy will fights Kaido while riding on T-rex Drake, like Blue in Jurrasic World.</br>  <br>Oh please it's just a giant horned shadow. Building, demonic Totoro or giant den den mushi, we have no way of knowing what it is for sure.</br>  Which is more satisfying. This punch, or Bellamy's?  <br>I really don't like Luffy, for some reason. Never have. Didn't like either punch. <br><br>Most satisfying was him punching Wapol.</br></br></br>  <br> An entire arc taking place in Vegapunk's old laboratory <br> Learn nothing about him the whole time <br><br>I don't even dislike Punk Hazard, but this still pisses me off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This one.<br>I thought Bellamy's was cool, but since I felt more pity than anger toward Bellamy, I didn't really feel any satisfaction.</br></br>   tfw when got bored halfway through fishman island and haven't been back to OP since   <br>That's not just his best punch, that's the best moment in the whole series.</br>  <br>This meme just doesn't work with Shirahoshi as the MC.</br>  <br>This one. Bellamy's was satisfying at the time but he grew out of being a douchebag  and is a cute now </br>  <br>This. It shows Luffy's bravery and how he would rather die than be subjugated by some fat coward who hides behind his title</br>  <br>literally the GOAT moment in One Piece. I really felt the old vibes that the old manga had where Luffy would just punch anyone that pissed him off and punch them hard.<br><br>Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action.<br><br> tfw he punched the shit out of helmeppo those first few chapters </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the top right panel next to Drake's face. It is meant to show location, yet it looks like an exact fragment of the bottom panel.<br> in case this needs to be spelled out: that's just the scenery and not the silhouette (unfortunately). </br></br>  <br>What if they tortured him instead, though? I bet the Celestial Dragons have some really nefarious torture methods, since they've been running the world and quashing dissent for ages. We saw that torture exists in OP with Smoker's regiment.<br><br>It'd be interesting to see how Luffy'd react to Chinese water torture or hot pokers.</br></br></br>  <br>Seconds later, Luffy tearfully begs Kuma to stop raping his crew.</br>  <br> Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action <br>What ? What manga have you been reading ?<br>He just didn't meet any weak entitled idiot stupid enoug to challenge him since then.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, you might be onto something.</br>  <br>I don't think its bravery when your entire life is defined by taking down oppressive authorities. The list of people Luffy wouldn't punch if they ticked him off is probably empty.<br><br>Also, this chapters name was The Tiger And Dog. Fujitora is the tiger, was Moltres the dog(of the government)?</br></br></br>  <br>Akainu means "red dog"</br>  <br>i miss vander deckan...</br>  <br> was Moltres the dog(of the government)? <br><br>wtf are you talking about</br></br></br>  <br> Now a days luffy just looks at them menacingly insted of taking action. <br>When has that ever happened recently?</br></br>  <br><br>He isn't dead, but we probably won't hear from him again soon, no hazuda.</br></br>  <br>I most certainly am. I initially didn't want to give in to those retarded people saying that that was a building, while I was convinced that the shitty shadow was indeed Kaido. Then I saw panel and realized I was the one being retarded &gt;(and half of 4chimp).</br>  <br>I meant they had a submarine, which is a much better means of escaping than the Thousand Sunny. Sorry if that wasn't clear.</br>  Pretty shitty chapter. Too many worthless nobodies taking up panels.  <br><br>don't even remember who that guy is. Fuck that arc.</br></br>  <br>How did Law get a submarine anyway?</br>  <br>It's more hype than anything.<br><br>Luffy and Drake/Kaidou showdown coming soon to Wano.<br>Luffy will probably get stomped and humiliated then have a rematch years later on a different Kaidou island.</br></br></br></br>  <br>autism the post</br>  <br> &gt;It's somekind of huge creature working for Kaido <br> &gt; Hundred beat kaido <br>make sense. . kinda..</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about shipping. I do care about the science of having sex with Alvida and Kalipha though. <br><br><br>Alvida isn't frictionless. Otherwise she wouldn't be able to wear shoes or the likes. They would just come off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>just ignore the bait, he wants you to post</br>  <br>We did learn that Caesar worked with him and that he doesn't seem to be inherently evil like caesar is. He does seem to have some bit of morals about his experiments.</br>  I'm confused. Are the Gorousei on the top of the World Government or not? Are the Tenryuubito just a completely independent existence that they allow to cause trouble and fuck shit up?  <br>This is the first time I've seen one of you anons admit you were wrong. Especially before the most obvious thing was revealed. Can't believe how many people think some shitty shadow is a kaidou reveal. Most obvious tactic ever</br>  Reminder that Rosinante got himself killed because of his over obsession with a D.<br><br>you can't run away from it</br></br>  <br>Excuse me for wanting the plot to develop rather than seeing a bunch of random faggots like Capone and Urouge repeat for the millionth time how amazing Luffy is.</br>  <br>in order to emphasize my answer I have to post several pages.<br><br>Oda made a chapter where the straw hats almost got an unidentified treasure chest.<br><br>A monster appeared so the treasure got taken out of their reach and we never got to see what was in that chest by the way.<br><br>Then even the monster got terrified because we were shown what (at the time) we believed to be the largest giants ever depicted in one piece.<br><br>Oda named the very next chapter (222)<br> New Heavy Weights Appear <br>In the following pages Blackbeard's crew is introduced, starting with Van Auger.<br>Now here is the two pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>that was before usopp knew of CoO though<br><br>he didnt even know he had awakened it and pulled off a crazy shot.<br><br>when he actually masters it should be even better than that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is strong evidence that Van Auger was pre haki as well (fought Ace), and other than how amazing his shot was, no evidence he used haki to do it.<br>Even with CoO Usopp has not matched that shot (hitting a target beyond the horizon line) ever.</br></br>  <br>By being kawaii</br>  <br>he hasnt because this was his first time using it ever with sugar. He didn't even realize he awakened it.<br><br>Sanji and zoro and luffy were the only haki users post time skip and now usopp is the fourth.</br></br></br>  <br>But Blackbeard had all those Level 0 prisoners kill each other.</br>    Jesus gets jobbed <br><br>when am I supposed to like Sabo.</br></br>  <br>That would be his name if he had Apoo's fruit. Or hell, any other music related one.</br>  <br>Correct, he had no choice but to because he didn't want that many crew members and didn't want to release legitimate competition to come challenge him later. Kuzan put all those lv 5 prisoners in permanent ice stasis (odas version of death) on punk hazard, so he shouldn't be too upset that BB eliminated all the others.<br>I agree that eventually Kuzan will fight Blackbeard and lose.</br></br>  <br>I guess the same place he got matching clothes with his logo on for his whole crew?</br>  I really hope that Fujitora gets a proper fight like Kuma, instead of Sabo or someone else meddling in and saving them. Luffy and Law probably can't fight (unless Mansherry intervenes) but there's still Zoro practically woundless and Kanjuro with Kinemon who haven't really fought.  <br>Fuji is not going to attack law &amp; luffy</br>  <br>He doesn't. People are just assuming he does because of recent events.</br>  <br>Zoro and Fuji already began a swordsman duel do you really believe Zoro won't beat an impossible opponent in the arc everyone says mirrors alabasta?<br>They gon fight EVEN IF Fuji plans to let them go all along.<br>The swordsman duel started already no way it won't finish. That's the real reason Zoro fought a easy opponent in the conflict.</br></br></br>  <br><br>remember that clothes act differently on the bodies of fruit users. Sabo's clothes don't burn away, Luffy's stretch with him, Bonney's change size with her. It stands to reason that Aldiva's clothes are not affected by the slipperyness, but are, themselves, slippery as well</br></br>  <br>Okay assuming her shoes are frictionless why isn't she constantly in motion or able to stand upright? <br><br>Surely there is some traction there albeit how little it is.<br><br>She is also able to hold objects like her mace.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bonneys doesnt change</br>  i just read another translation of the chapter cause fuck my manga panda didn't make any fucking sense other then the fleet admiral was super mad, now i can actually understand why<br><br>jesus fuck manga panda</br></br>  <br>I don't think he's going to risk his position in the government. There's already an Admiral who deserted to go against the WG, there probably won't be another.<br><br><br>Zoro would definitely not beat Fuji. He's stronger and more important than Doffy, he's the typical stronger character at the end of an arc that forces them to leave. I somehow want Zoro to lose, but that shouldn't happen, so I hope that it ends in a stalemate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm.</br>  <br><br>I assume that she can control how slippery they get, but in more of a subconscious way a la buggy. Buggy can't get cut and Alvida can't get hit/hurt with anything else. They are a nice match.</br></br>  <br>Mangapanda is only good for pic related</br>  <br>I don't think Fuji gives a fuck about the government anymore.</br>  <br>I think one of the Blues is well known for having more advanced technology than the others. Possibly West Blue, the one Sanji is from.</br>  <br>He's just seen the equivalent of an earthquake combined with the Amritsar Massacre and all of it because of the government.</br>  <br>What I mean is that Oda wouldn't have Fuji be introduced this arc, only to leave the Marines at the end of it with us barely knowing about him. Aokiji made sense, we knew a lot, and he had a big fight and all that. Besides it'd be having the same shit happening again in a span too short.</br>   6th months till Gear Four appears in the anime   <br>Jesus can't become a pirate anymore right.<br><br>It looked like Sabo burned one of Jesus's eyes until it became blind and 3rd degree burns all over his face.</br></br></br>  <br> Zoro would definitely not beat Fujitora. <br>Okay, I can honestly understand feeling the way you feel, but everything about Dressrosa proves you wrong.<br><br>Oda isn't ever gonna have an admiral defeat the SH crew again, he already did that three times, with the third being the direct cause of the time skip with Luffy literally having a flashback of it and saying "never again!!!" Before he accepted to be trained by Rayleigh.<br><br>Zoro will win.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This chapter made Akainu look like a fucking joke. All he did was whine like a little faggot and get told off by his bosses and even his fucking subordinate. <br><br> M-muh reputation <br> Y-yeah?! W-well you're not allowed in my club anymore if you don't make it up to me! &gt;:C </br></br></br>  <br><br>I think he will be the chaotic one, with the navy tolerating his mess because he follows their orders.</br></br>  <br>From my understanding, in ranking of actual power held:<br><br>Tenryuubuto: The Top, but don't actually do anything and simply exist in opulence. The royalty that don't do anything.<br><br>Cipher Pol: Agents of the Tenryuubuto and work to make sure they stay in power. The FBI that does undercover work.<br><br>Gorousei: Actual head of the government part of the World Government that makes decisions. The Senate or Congress that passes laws.<br><br>Marine HQ: The military part of the World Government. In charge of enforcing the WG's rules. The military that answers to the government.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't wait when Akainu tells Kizaru to head to Dressrosa with the authority to Buster Call as well since he can't trust Fujitora anymore.  <br> Mangapanda thinks Hiken is Fire Gun <br> Mangapanda thinks Mariejois is Marie Joy </br></br>  <br>I get what you say, but its not like someone like him who hasnt drink the Marines kool-aid could remain an Admiral for long.<br>But something would happen that will make him keep his position.<br><br> Fiji, pls take Law away <br> Save us from the Waterlawl ride. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it didn't.<br>Akainu is the first character to legitimately challenge the Gorosei in the whole story.<br>I thought Akainu was a bitch because of what he did at Marijeford, but this proved me wrong.<br><br>Akainu is mad at Fujitora really only because he feels his actions humiliate the Marines. They both clearly agree about removing the shichibukai.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing is not getting curbstomped and another thing is winning. We are still at a too early point to have Zoro beat an Admiral, especially before even Luffy doing it. In fact, that shouldn't happen until after they've beat some Yonkou's high members or something.<br><br>A stalemate from a close fight favoring Fuji would be for the best. But seriously, even Sabo had trouble with him, Zoro is defnitely not on that level, otherwise we might as well be near Raftel.</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't necessarily need friction to hold her mace depending on its shape.</br>  4 have been announced in the August edition of the Newtype magazine.<br><br>July 12 – 701: 「悲しき記憶 白い町の少年ロー! 」<br>“Sad Memories!

Fuji won't have good relations with the WG, but that doesn't mean he won't keep working for them. Even if he doesn't agree with their ways, he has accepted them, and now is willing to go after Law and Luffy even after all they did.</br>  <br> op-op fruit </br>  <br> No Harpy parts <br><br>Shit<br>would rather bang Sugar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Had no choice <br>Come on man, he totally had a choice. Blackbeard doesn't hold grudges, but he's totally got no qualms about killing anybody because it suits him.</br></br>  <br><br>The guy who ran away from Kuzan, yeah.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Doffy get dumpstered by Aokiji</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>With or without wings, Monet is the best.</br>  <br>People only use Panda because they come out really early and they want an idea of what's going on.<br><br>When you read Panda, you don't actually read the translation, you just kinda skim it</br></br></br>  Anyone here play Dance Battle?<br><br>Why don't more people play Dance Battle?<br><br>Also why isn't it in available in English yet?<br><br>Also did they remove the referral bonuses in the 2.0 update? I can't find any options to share to Twitter/Facebook/LINE to get 5 coins like some online guides indicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alvida had to take her shoes off to slide around on the floor. She can obviously control it though.</br>  <br><br>This. Even if mangastream uses a lot of slang, at least it is pretty understandable and trustworthy.</br></br>  <br>Dude...<br>Just think about the shit you say. Jozu lost a fuckin arm to Kuzan, Kuzan lost a leg to Akainu, Whitebeard lost half his face and had incinerated internal organs.<br><br>Luffy outright would have refused to continue his journey if Rayleigh didn't tell him he's admiral tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shanks <br> btfo <br><br>yeah, no.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Mangastream takes a lot of liberties with their translations but at least it's coherent.</br>  <br>We already had a "stalemate" where Fuji ran away from Zoro after his gimmick failed.</br>  <br><br>Given the story so far:<br><br>The Gorousei seem to be on top of the world since they control the marines. Tenryuubito seem to be nothing but just the descendents of the creators of the world government; out of respect for that fact it seems the marines give them a status above normal nobles. However, there has been hints to some sort of national treasure in Mariejois and a prophecy involving the "D." line.... Not to mention the ancient weapons and the Void century. It could be possible that it's later reveled that the Tenryuubito have access to a powerful relic that their specific blood lines can only activate, maybe this relic allows them to strong-arm the world government into giving them their special status as long as they promise not to use it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as there is 'sort of' a depression for her to hold it it would be fine. The curvature of the mace and her grip strength will provide resistive forces.<br><br>If its the same mace she used while fat there should be no problems, except it would slip around a bit while moving.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you seriously think that Luffy is at the same level as Whitebeard and his crew? If you do, I can't say anything, there's no point in arguing with retards.<br><br><br>That wasn't a fight, that was just a small clash.</br></br></br></br>  So is fuji fight trastraw or is he giving the finger to Akainu?<br><br>I'm not sure either way due to translation shit.</br></br>  <br>What will ascend luffy to be whitebeard tier?<br>Awakening?<br>He's gonna need to be that level to reach raftel.</br></br></br>  <br>He would have to become the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br> ... <br><br/></br></br>  <br>In Marineford it was directly shown that Doflamingo was stronger than a WB commander.<br><br>Yes, I think that Luffy is stronger than Ace was when he died. You don't?<br><br>Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died.<br><br>Luffy is not as strong as Shanks.<br><br>It was a fight. Fujitora ran away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died. <br><br><br>Release day is amazing</br></br></br></br>  <br> if I don't like Luffy's statements they weren't said <br>Fuck off.<br>We are 3 months to revery in story you stupid fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard <br><br>hahaha get a load of this guy</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Doffyfags were dead but I guess not.<br><br>He's not, he ran from Aokiji like a bitch and tried to kick Fujitora and failed. He's not admiral level.</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to hear Akainu say what he said to give Fuji reason to keep doing what he's doing and that's to expose the WG for it's wrongdoings.<br>Akainu barring an Admiral just to save face is being absurd and it will only strengthen Fuji's idea of justice. Fuji won't be doing anything to the strawhats as he has no intention of handing them over. So, he'll remain chasing them and fail doing so while never being able to report back until people call out Akainu's extremism.</br></br>  It's depressing to think the best we have (for free) is Mangastream.<br><br>I miss Mangarule and Powermanga.</br></br>  <br>Question<br>How the FUCK did Akainu not get a little permanent injury from the most DIRECT hit from Whitebeard</br></br>  <br>Its for free so I wont bitch, nigga.</br>  <br> Luffy is close to the same level as sick Whitebeard, who admitted he wasn't really the strongest anymore before he died. <br><br>I hope you realise how wrong you are when Luffy severely loses his first fight with Kaido.</br></br></br>  <br>He was permanently scarred. Look close.</br>  <br>he lost his first encounter with doflamingo and it took gettings his organs mangled and luffy going gear fourth twice to take him down.<br><br>Where the hell are people getting whitebeard level from<br><br>his gear fourth kong guns didnt even beat some animals on that island hancock keeps her pets</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are tattoos dumbass</br>  <br>I think he is referring to the frankenstein scars</br>  <br>Luffy is admiral level his organs healed partway into the fight</br>  <br>Akainu has some awesome tattoos. Yakuza style tats are just cool as fuck.</br>  <br> Luffy severely loses his first fight with Kaido. <br>I just hope he doesnt go all post- Marineford angst again and realizes that ´´okay, I fucked up, lets make an actual keikaku´´</br></br>  <br>neither luffy nor doffy are admiral level<br><br>They are in that niche zone between admirals and vice admirals.<br><br>Admirals are masters of all and super well rounded. There is a reason Doflamingo ran away from an Aokiji who no longer had ties to the government. He could have possibly beat him with luck but he knew he was definitely at the disadvantage. Breaking the ice was a bluff and aokiji was just letting him know he could kill him if he really wants to start something.</br></br></br></br></br>  Luffy is not Admiral level.<br><br>An Admiral would not need thousands of people's help to defeat anyone not to mention Law doing half the work,</br></br>  <br>You mean like with crocodile where he tried using water during round 2?</br>  Pick one  any decent translation of the chapter by now ?  Anyone else think this smug bastard's gonna beat Zoro to Mihawk?  <br>niggastream was out since 14 hours ago</br>  <br>first one</br>  <br>No<br><br>VIZ's will be out on monday, and powermanga in a couple weeks. Good translation takes time, save it for a reread of the arc.</br></br></br>  <br>bro, the boys at niggastream got you ass covered</br>  <br>That was hardly a plan, more like picking something up on the way, but given how they were in a rush its okay.<br>I mean more like a more intricated plan that involves more than show up and beat up the baddies, then again it will always end up in that.</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo, the king of the One Piece underground and would probably know about Aokiji and Blackbeard's connections. <br><br>For one thing, Blackbeard's crew is getting powerful devil fruit, which could easily tie in Doflamingo. <br><br>I feel like the whole "I don't have any intention of fighting you . . . what's your current status, Kuzan?" thing was an intentional verbal attack on Aokiji, probably since he knew good details about Kuzan and BB. He probably thought it wasn't in his best interest to fight Aokiji, regardless of if he could or couldn't beat him.<br><br>But I agree on what you said. I feel like Doffy's actually just really hotheaded, lashing out at Fuji sometime during this arc when Fuji ragged on the Shichibukai, while not fighting Aokiji. Makes power levels more bullshit, but personally I think doffy would have been murdered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido, Big Mom, and Shanks were all stronger than final days Whitebeard. He was still really strong and still had his op fruit, but he was on life support literally.<br><br>Kaido and Shanks arent.<br><br>The real reason WB told his commanders DONT INTERFERE is if Shanks was there to kill him, that way his sons wouldn't also be killed.<br><br>Shanks blocked Akainu with Haki.<br>Whitebeard got his face melted.<br><br>Think about WB speech when he said he wouldn't always be the strongest, he didn't mean when he died he meant in that time that he was alive.<br>He was really really sick physically to the point that at one point he seized up due to his medical condition, which caused all his commanders to look and get distracted from their own fights.<br><br>Do you seriously believe that a rubber man, immune to quake, immune to blunt damage, resistant to all damage, who can retain his rubber property vs haki and exponentiate his attack power with gear 4 could not hit Whitebeard while he randomly gets full body paralyisis for brief periods during the fight?<br><br>Whitebeard was only strongest at Marineford because of his reputation.<br>He hadn't been in a real fight for a long time, think about that too, think about how BB thought WB would die easily, because he knew WB wasn't the strongest anymore, knew all about his illness from being on ship 20 fucking years.<br><br>WHITEBEARD WAS NOT STRONGEST AT MARINEFORD.<br><br>Shanks easily was, that's why he stopped Kaido from taking advantage he knew WB was inflating his power level to protect his family by reputation (remember FI)?<br>If WB wasn't perceived as strongest still, those islands would get challenged even before his death.<br>You gotta read with eyes unclouded anon.<br>On a unrelated note Buggy was looking for Johns Treasure.<br>Did you know that Luffy never obtained the (exclamation mark circled by Oda) unidentified treasure chest within this derelict ship?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He said 'decent translation'</br></br>  <br>He'll get wiped out like Burgess</br>  <br>the 'trusted' translators agreed it was pretty on point this week</br>  <br>ain't nothin wrong wit' a little slang, gotta loosen up and enjoy the flow</br>  <br>Sorry. 14 ours ago i was a work or sleeping.</br>  <br>One Piece threads will always be terrible, because the mods doesn't care.</br>  <br>Why is everyone assuming that he's going to quit the marines instead of pursuing Luffy?</br>  <br>Because we read the decent translation<br><br>his reply was akin to "pfft like I care" or "That's fine by me"<br><br>when akainu stuttered and told him he would be kicked out if he didnt kill luffy/law</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nigger</br>  <br>"That's fine by me" could also mean he's fine with taking out Luffy to make up for his actions.</br>  <br>What if that translation is based on an incorrect reading by the "trusted" translator?<br>If Fuji attacks Zoro next week should we default to manga panda since it would confirm one group translates real but ugly while another translates styled based on fan thoery of the translator?</br></br>  <br>Black suit Doffy master race</br>  <br><br>Looking at this, I wonder how many times a week do One piece characters have sexual intercourse? Or you think they all are actually virgins?</br></br>  <br><br>It's the island from the cover story with the quicksand quicksand guy where kaido's forces rivet-plated an entire island then in the end Drake X showed up</br></br>  <br> virgins <br> children <br> pregnancy <br> sex slaves for the tenryubito <br><br>quad satan pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>can't people just accept that it was probably intentionally ambiguous, on the part of both Oda and Fujitora?</br></br></br>  <br><br> the crew having frequent orgies <br><br>Muh dick</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>That's some quality post, mate.</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo fucked all the women in his crew</br>  <br>It was definitely meant to be ambigous but you have to take into the context of everything else. He did something he knew Akainu would be pissed for and pretty much did the shounen equivalent of cursing out akainu via cellphone.<br><br>His words about being told what to do wouldn't be a "yes sir right away sir"</br></br></br>  Is Corazon the only flashback character with devil's fruit? Am I missing some other characters?  <br>it's a new age, and yonkos wont be able to exist in the presence of a Pirate King<br>They have to fall and these are the real contenders to make Shanks fall, the only other one to BTFO Shanks is Luffy, but he has no reason to Shanks <br><br>The reign of the one armed bastard is coming to a close man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Jora?</br>  <br>Even Jora?</br>  <br>Why was his devil fruit such pointless shit that existed for one gimmick scene with law crying? <br><br>This is one of the cheapest things Oda done in one piece.</br></br></br>  <br><br>- Zoro fucks Robin everyday and Nami twice a week (when he gets money)<br><br>- Usopp is constantly being teased by Nami, maybe she sucks his cock in the morning sometimes  for free <br><br>- Luffy has fucked Robin a few times, when she joined the crew, after her rescue from EL, and post time-skip being the more memorable ones. He fucks Nami at least three times a week.<br><br>- Franky is only interested on Robin, so they fuck 3-4 times a month for sexual release.<br><br>- Chopper constantly takes baths with Nami and Robin, he's used to see them naked and also is not interested in human women.<br><br>- Brook is always peeping on the girls, but he  just couldn't get a boner, YOHOHOHOHO <br><br>- Sanji  don't even know how a pussy looks like </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does Sabo get those batshit crazy eyes so much? Is he Yandere for Luffy tier?  <br>As far as I remember yes Maybe Kuina had a Devil Fruit too, that's why her father killed her, he wanted the fruit for himself</br>  <br><br>even moot</br></br>  <br><br>Shanks blocked an akainu who had already taken a whitebeard beating. Sure he got back up but he wasnt nearly in the same shape as he was prewhitebeard<br><br>You guys are silly. Whitebeard took a billion attacks and still beat the shitout of blackbeard and he needed his entire crew to kill him<br><br> luffy can beat blackbeard <br><br>just stop</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He´s not all right in the head.<br>But may as well be yandere as well.</br></br>  <br>it was flashback abd roci was gonna die anyway (from Oda's POV)<br>he knew he never had to show the practical use for a pirate</br></br>  <br>It's great if someone like Teach eat Absalom and Corazon's fruit. Unless if he stinks.</br>  <br>Pointless? Without it there was no way in hell he would ever get the Ope Ope fruit. Do you not see how clumsy he was. Seriously, do you extrapolate at least a little? Or does reading alone uses up all your mental resources.</br>  <br> Sanji don't even know how a pussy looks like </br>  <br>Shiki and his levitation fruit</br>  <br>All these fucking assumptions holy shit, and no I still stand by my point, he's not as strong as Whitebeard, even the same Whitebeard at Marineford.</br>  <br>You forgot Usopp's mom.</br>  <br>First Doffy lost his hair<br><br>now his throne</br></br></br>  <br> Why was his devil fruit such pointless shit <br>That fruit would make you a great assassin if not for Haki bullshit <br><br>It would make you arguably a better assassin then even invisibility</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Dellinger?</br>  <br> I won't let anyone touch my little brother </br>  <br>Kuina is Kaido<br><br>*K*uina<br>*K*aido<br><br>Oda is a genius</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a trap nigga<br> Cutie D. was the bottom bitch </br></br>  <br>Was the favorite</br>  <br><br>Cause Yonkos stand in the way to Raftel and One Piece.</br></br>  <br>Shanks blocked Magma.<br>Shanks blocked Magma.<br>shanks blocked Magma.<br><br>Easily. With Haki. With one arm tied behind his back.<br><br>Whitebeard got melted by magma. Whitebeard was unable to harm Aokiji with anything but his devil fruit.<br>He was unable to harm Akainu without using QUAKE.<br><br>Shanks intentionally did NOT use the sharp side of his blade vs Akainu.<br><br>Stop making yourself appear retarded just because you don't want to be wrong. You are, faggot.<br>Revery 3 month away either Luffy is super close to strong enough to fight Blackbeard or he's gonna fuckin die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido &gt; Kaidan (stairs)<br>Holy fuck Oda!</br></br>  Oda sold himself out after the timeskip. He's been creating shitty characters that don't fit One Piece at all, like pedo bait Sugar and fujo bait Dellinger.<br>As a result, the fanbase became more and more cancerous <br><br>Law is pretty much the co-protagonist at this point and I don't see it changing anytime soon</br></br></br>  <br>His clumsiness was conveniently inactive while he was stealing Ope Ope from Barrels' hideout. He could've done it without his fruit.</br>  <br>We knew that since the shit with Kuma though.</br>  <br>Shepard's nakama killed Kuina?</br>  <br>The attack wasnt aimed at shanks. It was aimed at a defenseless fodder marine and it was spread out instead of the concentrated attacks he used against whitebeard. Not nearly the same. <br><br>There is no way this version of luffy beats the blackbeard that was in marineford.That means he isn't sick whitebeard level and your whole theory falls apart<br><br>he doesn't beat akainu either. or whitebeard. Or any of the other admirals. <br><br>Even if gear 4th could possibly let him hang with them he will inevitably get his hakiless time period and die.<br><br>He couldn't even finish doflamingo in his first use of it and doflamingo was just on the defensive taking hit after hit.<br><br>Luffy will get stronger of course but to say he is currently as strong as whitebeard is hilariously inaccurate.<br><br><br>We knew he kept his word. What we didnt know is that he had a limit for SCIENCE!<br><br>most /evil/ scientists don't have a moral compass and put the research above all else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the risk of eating a devil fruit. You might get something pretty shitty.<br><br>But his fruit was rather useful as a spy tool, because he was able to make phone calls whenever he wanted to without any chance of anybody listening in.</br></br></br>  <br>there needs to be more shitty ones to make what spandam said about it true<br><br>so far all we have is sui sui and corazon's as the truly shitty fruits and they aren't that awful</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, we know he's eventually going to go after the Yonko for one reason or another. But he wasn't actively going after Kaido like people in universe are assuming, he just wanted to fuck up Doffy.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>People with shit fruits aren't going to make it in new world.</br>  <br> Swim through solid <br> Tactical Stealth  <br> shit  <br><br>are u a giraffefag as much as you are a tripfag?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Haki is willpower. Whitebeard is old, so he has no will left. Him passing on his will to his 'children' was one of the focuses of his attack.<br><br><br>More like:<br>- Zoro fucks robin regularly. Gets extorted by Nami every month or so for sex (she forces him to pay)<br>- Usopp gets the discounted price of free to fuck nami since she needs someone regularly and cant do most of the cew<br>- Luffy fucks no one because he's dumb<br>- Franky fucks no one, but gets off on exposing himself to the  guys <br>- Chopper fucks no one because bestiality<br>- Brook masturbates to the girls panties<br>- Sanji masturbates to  what's left of the panties when Brook is done  and he  adds his  semen to their food</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read all the way to the end<br><br>I said they aren't that awful. Just comparatively to every other single devil fruit power I would have them both at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br>Chopper's is useless if eaten by a human.</br>  <br>it gives them enlightenment. Oda still hasn't clarified what that means.<br><br>It might also make them more attractive like alvida's did</br></br></br>  <br>Dellinger is a cute young femboy, not a woman.</br>  <br>You don't understand. There are no shitty fruits, just shitty people who get them. That's the entire point of devil fruits. They are just random shit but no matter how fucking stupid they sound you could still use them for lots of useful things.<br><br>Many people thought that being made of rubber was a stupid useless power before reading the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>what is fun ?</br>  <br><br>Anyone with Observation Haki could fuck Roci. It's only useful if used against fodder.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps Luffy is the first gomu-gomu user who invents gear.</br>  <br>A human who ate the Human Human fruit would be able to transform into 3 different versions of a human, and would get the natural physical buff that all Zoan fruits give.</br>  <br>No there are definitely some shitty fruits. No one would say "man I am so glad I got the soundless fruit!" in a world where people can turn into light and use telekinesis.<br><br>Yes it has a usage but it's still one of the worst fruits. There is no getting around it. Even if you think it's okay for assassination Lucci is far better off the Leopard fruit than he is with a soundless fruit.</br></br></br>  <br>Not definition, but example.<br><br>You don't know what's the definition of the word definition, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Do human fruits give the carnivore buff or the herbivore buff since we are omnivores</br>  <br>Because he felt comfortable to know that even if he does fuck up, no one will hear it. That peace of mind alone is probably enough to alleviate a great part of his clumsiness. Plus, clumsiness aside, not being heard helps out in heist situation like this immensely. How else would he shoot explosives and shit. Instead of confusing everyone, it would give him away.</br>  <br>why doesn't blackbeard just kill kuzan and take his fruit so he has 3 fruits?</br>  <br>- Zoro fucks Sanji regularly. <br>- Usopp sucks Chopper dick regularly<br>- Luffy is a transgender, he's actually a girl<br>- Franky fucks the ship becos he's robot<br>- Brook doesn't have a dick<br>- Sanji doesn't want to fuck women, he's only admires them, he fucks nobody<br>- Nami and Robin are lesbian</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know that he isn't trying to.</br>  <br>blackbeard might have a limit to 2 fruits</br>  <br/>  <br><br> implying BB doesnt have like a shitload of DF powers now </br></br>  <br> Franky fucks the ship becos he's robot <br><br>But anon that´s incest.</br></br></br>  <br>He would die if he has two logia.</br>  <br>He said on Punk Hazard "I'm going to defeat all of them", so he's been wanting to go after Kaido for a while... and by that I mean a day.</br>  <br> this is why he didn't want mera-mera for himself </br>  How are BB and his crew stealing fruits? Clearly Jesus has the ability because he said when Luffy came out of G4 "Luffy is at death's door your gomu gomu fruit is mine" and he seemed to think he could take Sabo's fruit off him.<br><br>DFs don't spawn where the person dies do they?</br></br>  What would happen if someone eats an Oil Logia?<br>Will he drown because he is a fruit user or will he float because he is oil?</br>  <br>fruits so shitty I forgot all about them<br><br>I assume if you awaken your "jacket" fruit you should be able to forcefully take control of things</br></br></br>  <br>I want a filler episode with Franky dating Sunny a la Futurama.</br>  <br>They give the Mythical Zoan buff.</br>  <br>might float but be weakened when touching it<br><br>  I want to know when we will see a water water fruit user or salt water, clearly oda is keeping it in the back burner for future use  </br></br></br>  <br>Or turn things into jackets.... I smell a Wapolesque cover series.</br>  <br>DFs apparently go to the nearest compatible fruit, so Burgess was probably carrying all sorts of normal fruits in that big bag.<br>I'm sure BB just extracts the power directly from the user with Yami Yami.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he has a bag full of fruits, to make sure the DF will respawn there.</br></br>  What did Blackbeard do under the black cloth?  <br>If he activates it then he should float, similar to Akoji's bicycle stunt. If not, then auto drown.</br>  <br>Basically he's weakened but he'll still be able to walk on water.</br>  <br>That's true, but he wasn't specifically targeting Kaido. Kaido just happened to be connected to his current target.</br>  <br> he sucked Whitebeard's dick </br>  <br>I wonder if he is still wearing that uniform. I kinda hope so because it looks cool as fuck but at the same time it wouldn't really make sense for him to.</br>  <br>Sucked WB's cock to get the fruit out</br>  <br>We all know.  Blowjob.  The black cloth works as a spoiler tag.</br>  <br>He deep throated Whitebeard</br>  <br>sucked the big white moby dick of course</br>  <br>Akainu dropped everything he was doing in a major war to immediately kill Coby with all his might.<br>Without Akainu interfering, Coby hard countered Blackbeard who was planning to sink the whole island, shown literally distracting him with his Haki declaration.<br>Coby is not fodder.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to know how he got a submarine and I want to know what he named it. Why hasn't this been asked in the SBS? If I remember correctly, Law's birthday was suggested by a fan. Why hasn't anyone suggested a name for Law's submarine? Bandai had to print "Trafalgar Law's Submarine" on the model kit they made? They should've realized at this point that "Hey, doesn't this thing need a name if it's popular enough to sell?"<br><br>Someone suggested back then that the submarine could be named "The Walrus" because Beatles and Yellow Submarine? Can't remember.</br></br></br>  <br>That's an awesome power</br>  <br>He absorbed Whitebeards Soul with his Yami Yami or he just sucked his dick while his angel list lasted.</br>  <br>The Strongest Man in the World: die by a blowjob</br>  Haki lets you to attack DF users' real body, allowing you to hurt Logias and Paramecias like Luffy whose bodies are changed in one way or another.<br>What happens if you hit a Zoan with Haki?</br>    <br>I guess you would hit him as if he were in his human form.</br>  <br>Not as good as a Possession Fruit. Think about it. You can possess anyone. Take out a knife. Slit their throat. Winrar. Better than Doffy's puppet shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>that other anon from earlier was right<br>there really is an increase in faggots from the usual level</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They will die.</br>  <br>He came too late to rescue Ace. Hue Hue.</br>  <br>There are only three things you do underneath covers:<br><br>Sleep, build a fort, and  fuck <br><br>Didn't look like he built a fort to me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Namely Marshall D. teach.</br>  <br>Where you you think we are?</br>  <br>You're retarded. Possessing someone also makes you experience the same senses as they do so if you slit your throat in someone else's body, you would also experience the same pain of dying from slitting your throat.</br>   all these peeps thinking Luffy is Admiral/Yonko level   <br><br><br><br><br>What if when you eat a devil fruit, it never fully passes through the body and just says in your stomach for the rest of your life until BB rips it out of your stomach?<br><br>What if the secret to having more devil fruits was having more than one stomach by surgery( or just having a really big stomach for two in one) to house each new DF. This extend to swords to if you gave them a hidden compartment to hold a small devil fruit bite.<br><br>Calling it now, Luffy has room for two fruits as is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Sorry but Blackbeard was always a retard.<br><br>Magellan was KOed and Blackbeard had all the time in the world to kill Magellan and get his Devil Fruit and give it to Jesus or something but he didn't do that so Jesus spends 2 years fruitless while passing off the chance to get Magellan's fruit even though Magellan would have shown no resistance anymore since he was KOed.<br><br>Fuck off Blackbeardfags. He isn't as smart as you think he is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really. Look at Luffy, he broke into Impell Down while Whitebeard's choice was to wait until Ace transported to Marineford. He's too beta to break into Impell Down.</br>  <br>Pain! But not actual death. Build high tolerance and you king. Plus, there are actual install kills for a human body. Server the carotid artery and you die within seconds without experiencing much pain. <br><br>Anon, use your head for something more than banging your keyboard with it.</br></br></br>  <br>Lawhat alliance is based and founded by the declaration of defeating Kaido specifically.</br>  <br>Can't be the case as the first bite of the devil fruit gives you the power<br><br>there is no devil fruit inside of you. we already seen what happens to a dead devil fruit user and where it goes</br></br></br>  <br>No one can tolerate the experience of dying.<br><br>It would feel worse than stomach poisoning ten fold</br></br></br>  <br> blackbeardfag <br>who?</br></br>  <br> Amount of fruits able to be eaten at once relates to stomach size <br>This is so oda it hurts</br></br>  <br>Jesus would refuse because no one would wrestle him if he had magellans fruit and he's a fag like you.</br>  <br>I meant to imply that only a chunk is needed to stay in your body</br>  <br>He was still unsure it might work? Why do you think he had the cloak for WB and why Shilew was like: if it fails we bounce?</br>  <br>Ah. Then maybe I'm wrong.</br>  <br>The fruits appear in the ocean apparently when you die.<br><br>My guess is it's based off the bible and they're "forbidden fruits" from the Adam and Eve tree, and they're probably the souls of the Sea Kings. When people die, the souls return to the trees, and Caesar was making zoan fruits by just using regular animals instead of sea king souls. The lost century probably explains this as the time when people were creating these for war. The ability to "hear the voices" we've seen mentioned is probably what it takes to "awaken" a devil fruit, because they're hearing the soul of the fruit. I'm guessing D's and Celestrial Dragons can both hear the voices since the lost age and that's how the two groups was formed.<br><br>Black Beard is probably using his dark fruit to steal souls themselves or some shit. Just my theory though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People can't throw houses either.</br>  <br>No one would wrestle with him in the first place, retard.<br><br>Sabo certainly didn't.<br><br>And use your brain, if Jesus got Mera Mera like he intended, no one would feel like wrestling with a man on fire, either.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will he get a fruit before the final war?<br>If so what fruit will he get?</br>  <br>Blackbeard would be under less stress doing that devil fruit stealing experiment on a KOed Magellan with no one around to help Magellan in Impel Down versus doing that shit on Whitebeard surrounded by enemies watching.</br>  <br>Makes sense if they were like 'If he pops from the two DFs we bail'. BB might have just pulled out a fruit under the wrap to get WB fruit.<br><br><br> The fruits appear in the ocean apparently when you die. <br>Where was this stated?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't know trigeminal neuralgia. It's a bitch, really.</br>  <br>no where<br><br>we already saw what happened when you die last arc<br><br>no one pays attention or even reads this manga apparently</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This OP world where magma burns fire, and people get stabbed/ shot a thousand times, casually loose limbs to walk another day (or hop in case of Kyros). Pain is not as much a factor in OP. <br><br>Plus, how do you know that death = immense pain. If your brain dies fast enough then you won't be able to feel shit for long. Also, no need to stay in the body as the guy is dying. Leave as soon as a fatal injury is inflicted and then watch him suffer.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty early on. I forgot where. They were referred to as "the souls of sea devils that appear in the ocean." or something</br>  <br>Who ever said Sanjuan was the largest living thing?</br>  This is why powerlevels will forever be branded as shitpost, there are no real powerlevels in One Piece and if they exist people who bring them into discussion are either retards or narutu immigrants always biased towards the most "cool" characters (Zoro, Doffy, etc)  <br>Good theory.<br> that stance! <br>-Marco</br></br></br>  <br>They are the Florian Triangle Entities which were said to have been lurking in the mist since before Moriah even arrived.</br>  <br> we all saw what happened last arc when you die <br><br>The fruits reappear? Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>I left the part out where I think D stands for Devil, since it's tied to biblical shit and the "devil fruits" are were referred to as the soul of sea devils.</br>  <br>Only dying from a nuclear explosion up close would be faster than your brain reaction.</br>  <br>Omg. That seems like BB. Never having the ability to steal but pretending to. In reality he just took a fruit and ate it. So only special thing is dual DF. Kek</br>  <br>True, how else will he achieve his goal of abolishing the Shichibukai if he loses his position? I'm not sure what's going to happen with the conditions Sakazuki has just set upon him, but he'll remain an Admiral.</br>  <br>He tried to get Gomu Gomu too though remember? Which one does Burgess want more? Maybe he wants Fire for himself but like Jinbe said BB wants the Gomu Gomu.</br>  <br>Lurk more, newfag.<br><br>Magma is compose of rock and fire. Of course it beats fire because it is two elements versus one and Ace had the weakest color of fire being red.<br><br>Blue and white fire are hotter than regular red fire.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point I guess, guy is already a super human, he just need a decent fruit to be a decent Yonkou commander.</br>  <br>Gravity. Fujitora is too good to be true so he will be the first killed Admiral in Blackbeard's fruit hunt.</br>  <br>Because he is a fucking mime you mongoloid</br>  <br>Muh colors! How autistic are you?<br>I said burns. How the fuck can you burn fire? I'm not taking about relative strength, just the burning thing. If anything, in the world of OP you should be able to burn magma since it has a more tangible component, as opposed to fire.<br><br>Oh, and knowing OP nuances has nothing to do with lurking here, you summerfag. Learn to fag....oops I mean 4chan, you do that other part so well already.<br> Look at me I used newfag and lurk, 4chan vocabulary, without basis. I'm so smart. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not necessarily. Some things kill you in mere seconds.</br>  <br> he doesn't kill unless he has no other way <br>Tell that to Thatch</br></br>  <br>You're absolutely right, it was Buggy that called them that. In the 4kids dub.<br><br> YO YA YO YA YO </br></br></br>  <br>Personally I hope their paths don't really cross at all, certainly not to the extent that they share an arc. I like that major things happen independently of the Strawhats.</br>  <br>Never watched the show. I only read. Couldn't have been that.</br>  <br>My mistake, it was Shanks who said it to Buggy, and it was just that they're related to the sea devils in some way.</br>    <br> There are no shitty fruits <br>http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Samu<wbr>_Samu_no_Mi<br>[</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>That's pretty useful for shitposting though.</br>  <br>The awakened form of that fruit robs laughter from the world, making those caught in it's influence lose the will to live and fight.</br>  <br>Perfect for stalling. Anything you say becomes so cringe inducing that your attacker has no choice but to stop everything he is doing to cringe/sigh/roll his eyes.</br>  <br>He'll be an aggressive/chaotic type of person I suppose, akin to a bull.</br>  <br>One of Zoro's swords should "eat" this fruit.</br>  <br>lol i dont even think anyone is a blackbeardfag everyone seems to think he is a goofy motherfucker</br>  <br> You don't understand. There are no shitty fruits <br> implying anyone would willingly eat the Spring Spring fruit or the Jacket Jacket fruit willingly </br></br>  <br>So was I man. Kid's had a past with Big Mom, and she's likely weaker than Shanks so I don't know why they're after him. I wonder what that means for the predictions of Blackbeard killing Shanks? Surely Oda would have Kid's alliance also take down a Yonkou which is why Big Mom would have worked nicely. What's going to happen with her now? I can't see both her and Kaido as well as Blackbeard going down to Luffy personally.</br>  <br>I actually really like the Spring Spring fruit, Bellamy is just a shitter.<br> Not turning your face into a spring when you get punched to harmlessly bounce away from an attack. </br></br>  Manga or anime if I've never gotten into Once Piece before?  <br>Manga.</br>  <br>Mange by a mile<br><br>it's quicker and the manga art is better quality than the animation, especially after the time skip</br></br></br>  <br>Manga if you want to go fast.<br><br>Anime is fine until around Thriller Bark, then you'll probably want to jump ship to the manga because of pacing issues and poor animation.</br></br></br>  <br> what's the means of prediction. <br>1. Shanks Scar<br>2. Shanks Jolly Roger<br>3. Shanks repeatedly pre empts Blackbeard<br>4. Blackbeard wants to go to Raftel Shanks knows how.<br>5. Blackbeard said "It's not time for me to fight you yet." At Marineford. Meaning the time will come.<br>6. Shanks can't defeat Blackbeard for Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  List of Broken Devil Fruits:<br><br>Horo Horo no Mi<br>Ope Ope no Mi<br>Noro Noro no Mi<br>Mero Mero no Mi<br>Goro Goro no Mi<br>Gura Gura no Mi<br>Pika Pika no Mi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you think that if Luffy and the SHs went straight up to Kaido/Blackbeard as soon as they came back from the timeskip, they'd win? Nope.<br><br>While they all got a lot stronger, they progressively continue to do so during the story to the point where they actually will be strong enough. Zoro and even Luffy at this stage could not defeat an admiral solo, but by the end of the story they both would be able to I imagine (or at least the likes of Zoro would match one).</br></br></br>  <br>But I mean does that mean Kid's alliance will lose to Shanks? Because I've always felt like Blackbeard was going to be the one to finish him off.</br>  <br>Hobi Hobi</br>  <br>Coloured manga without a doubt.</br>  Has there been any talk of the scars that Salazuki also got from Kuzan? I knew there were going to be fairly prevalent ones; Oda did well to hide them this much.  <br>You know, after today's chapter, I'm starting to think that admiral might not the level to compare to anymore. Seeing as there is still the Gorosei, who talk down on a fleet admiral as if he was an ant, as well as the mysterious CP0 whose power might even be more than that of admiral (I guess their like the CIA in relation to the Navy). Not to mention, we still have no idea if there's an actual physical power component to any of the tenryubito. Let's say the highest elites are actually devilishly strong.</br>  <br>I can't distinguish bait and fucking retards these days.</br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004</wbr></br>  <br> he/she could only tell stupid, bad, and flat jokes <br>How could that be possible when the existence of the fruit itself is pretty funny?<br><br> Yes, I ate it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, you are not Oda. What you feel, doesn't mean shit, no offense. Oda will do what he does best and blindside us with something unexpected. There's nothing to say that anyone will take down Shanks.</br>  <br>People in power talking down to physically stronger people is nothing new.</br>  Zou/Wano better not be as fucking gay as Dressrosa.  <br>All I'm saying is I'll be disappointed if Kid's alliance doesn't manage to take down a Yonkou, especially since they're currently stronger than Luffy's alliance. <br><br>Dressrosa is a top arc though.</br></br></br>  <br>Kidd's alliance will get wrecked unless they ally with or are unexpectedly given aid by Blackbeard.</br>  Can't wait til Shanks finally shows up and we see under his infobox "World's Strongest Man".   the only supernova with the balls to target Blackbeard was Bonney   <br>Blackbeard you mean.<br><br>Pretty sure he hunted her down and then just used her as leverage.</br></br></br>  <br>You are absolutely correct. But how do you get to that power? In OP world, I believe strength is a great determinant. Look, at all of them. Not only are the fuckers as tall, if not taller than, Sakuzaki (just compare them to a chair in those panels), they also look like lean and well preserved old guys. Like as if they spent their whole life giving a beating and never taking one.<br><br>Plus, the one with the sword always clutched, if that's not a foreshadowing for being Zorro's opponent, I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br>op, op-op is op in op</br>  <br>anime but then transition into the manga once the quality becomes shit</br>  So we have<br><br>Zoro<br>Nami<br>Usopp<br>Sanji<br>Chopper<br>Robin<br>Franky<br>Brook<br>Jinbe<br><br>who's gonna be the 10 to join?????????</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Condoriano.</br>  <br>You mean Con D.

There are already enough samurai fiction manga in Japan.</br>  <br>But we'll finally get to see whether pirates are better than ninjas.</br>  <br>Who said ninjas were involved?</br>  <br>Considering Moria managed to steal the corpse of a national dead hero despite the obligatory tomb guardians, that question is already answered.</br>  <br>I think what he meant is that he hopes that Wano does not have as much fujobait as Dressrosa</br>  <br>That was back when Moria had his pirate spirit duked it out with Kaido.<br><br>Though we don't what experience or powerlevel Kaido was at.<br>It'd be kind of cool see some of the current Yonks as superrookies.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Japan: The Island <br> Kishi is Oda's friend <br> no ninjas <br>Please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shadow in the background may be Kaido. Wasnt there a huge shadow like that in the end of thriller bark?</br>  <br>not the same kinda shadow</br>  <br><br><br>that's a japanese castle<br><br>they're in wano</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are gonna get hyped up and then taken down within out a hard fight like fisherman pirates because they are old and dated. Or they'll fight somebody like Rayleigh. <br><br>One piece is about current and previous generation pirates and such oldies as them are past expiration point. WB has already finished that era.</br></br></br>  Because of reasons I need to know when the anime becomes unbearable due to bad quality and it's better to read the manga from then on, someone knows?  <br>Fujitora can beat him. Gravity can bend light therefore he can bend Kizaru to his will.</br>  <br>The fuck?</br>  <br>Another pointless chapter.<br><br>Oda is milking this series hard and U.O.E.N.O it.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he can't. Blackbeard has the power that Fujitora needs in order to do that. He has incomplete gravity powers.</br>  <br>It dips and rises randomly; it's not consistent.<br><br><br>He would have to be exerting some monstrous gravitational force though. I know OP doesn't give a shit about physics sometimes but I don't think that'd be the case this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbear power is darkness, something hard to describe. But Fuji himself has a really simple power yet extremely powerful. Gravity is both the strongest and the weakest force in the universe. It affects the entire universe and a man who can pull a Meteor from space and say that was nothing can pull some crazy shit. For all we know he can pull the Moon and destroy the entire planet. We don't know the Limits of his power.</br>  <br>Blackbeard is a gravitational pull. Fujitora is complete control over gravity.</br>  <br> It dips and rises randomly; it's not consistent. <br><br>But there isn't a point where most of it is obviously made very half assed with the exception of important battles? I remember thriller bark very badly because of the animation but surely the decline happened before that.<br><br>It might help to know if most of enies lobby is at least bearable. Don't remember the animation of that one but at least the battles were good, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best admiral <br> Bows down to someone like a bitch <br><br><br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah but Blackbeard's Black Hole works weird because DARKNESS whereas Fuji would probably have to make a literal black hole to fuck up Kizaru</br>  <br><br>I play but it's been kicking my ass lately.

However, you simply liking to degrade yourself and enjoying the lowest of fujobaits is not sufficient reason for others to not look down on you. Social control necessarily includes to slap the wrists of those who act retarded.</br>  I kind of like the visuals for the opening, a shame the song is ass.<br><br>The show itself is okay, I guess. 3 episodes and all that.</br></br>  <br>Let's start with yours then.</br>  anyone read the manga?<br>what is twilight about?</br>  <br>ebin</br>  Was there an endcard for episode 1 or did Underwater not leave it in?

I bet you like traps.</br>  So what's the deal with this series? I was seriously disheartened by the first episode, I was pretty much on the verge or dropping this, but Anons kept praising it and saying it's the definite AOTS, so I decided to give the second episode a chance. What a mistake. I thought the fujobait would lessen after the initial exposition in episode 1, but it actually only got worse. Fucking hell, the very first scene is the absolute definition of female powerful bara wet dream.<br> Some bald buff ugly nigger is being a complete jerk and objectifying a woman that's passing by. Fortunately, he bumps into the uber strong white beautiful short bara who is about to fucking destroy the nigger but he doesn't because he is gracious and merciful, and frankly too strong to deal with suck small fries. <br>So pretty much 15 seconds into the episode and I want to barf. Some of the other obvious issues with this piece of shit series:<br> Glorification of prostitution. <br>The author just loves putting prostitutes on a pedestal, which is frankly disgusting. This is not something you can make light of, especially since women all around the world are suffering because of it. It's basically enabling women's suffering and sexual exploitation.<br> The main baddie is a PoC <br>Seriously? This bitch of an author should seriously check her goddamn privilege. Why are all the good guys pretty and white? Hell, one of the MCs is even blonde with blue eyes. Talk about racial stereotypes, golly...<br><br>Add to all that the excessive violence, the objectification of the males characters (all of them are pretty much female power fantasy), the blatant portrayal of women as powerless creatures in a patriarchal society, the constant sexual innuendos, as well as the all other typical fujobait tropes. Really, this must be one of the worst animes made as of recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's unpleasant to look at. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>im too lazy to post a bait pic so just imagine i did</br>  <br> marathoning <br> first episode <br>How do you guys even manage to do this without passing out?</br></br></br>  <br>You have issues, if the dude has only a bit, it's kind of sexy. It shows off his virility.</br>  <br> You have issues <br>Being heterosexual?</br></br>  <br>But Nicolas is Asian.</br>  Is there anyone in the credits credited with the sign language research? I'm wondering how accurate this all is.  <br>It's a manga adaptation, idiot.</br>  <br>The faggot doth protest too much. Get out of that closet.</br>  <br>Heterosexual people aren't afraid of men.</br>  <br>how the fuck are these pubic hair? seems more like belly hair. I got them.</br>  <br> "nigger" and "PoC" in the same post <br> misogynist attack on women and SJW-esque defense of women in the same post <br>I don't even</br></br></br>  <br><br>Finding male pubic hair to be aesthetically unappealing = being gay and afraid of men<br>OK.<br>I just don't like looking at aesthetically unappealing things. I figure if I'm going to waste my life away watching anime I might as well at least make it anime that's nice to look at. That's why I always watch any anime by Kyoto Animation, except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the Free! guys don't have pubic hair, or pubic anything. They are ken dolls.</br>  <br>Your aesthetic sense is so shitty, you are a failure of a human being if the male form cannot be beautiful in some minor way to your eyes. Let me guess, you think other guys' dicks look nasty?</br>  <br> you think other guys' dicks look nasty? <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br>  <br>You are gay if you aren't attracted to anime men</br>  <br>Sorry to burst your bubble, but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men.</br>  Was the thread last week as bad as this one?  <br>It was 10 time worse.</br>  <br>Welp, maybe it'll get better later on when the shitposters get bored and move to something that attracts more attention.</br>  Daily reminder that this is undoubtedly the best pairing, and that everyone should hope this happens in the end.  <br> but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men. <br>It's at its most fun when it's depraved. Guys are just icky.</br></br>    <br>What if I find penises and vaginas equally disgusting?</br>  <br>Vampires</br>  <br>Cuties :3</br>  When do they fuck?  <br> Soldiers in some war 100 years ago took experimental addictive medicine that made them stronger, unfortunately it also affected their offspring and while they're stronger they also need to take the medicine on a regular basis, have mental or physical defects and only live about 30 years. </br>  <br>Yeah and they spend 2 volumes worth of pages every time he uses sign language to get everything in the Manga.<br><br>Good idea, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>That would never have happened if Umbrella was developing the serum.</br>  <br>You got it wrong. Shaving is gay, body hair is manly.</br>  <br>Yes, the Japanese Federation of the Deaf.</br>  Nina is CUTE.  So... the whore is never ever going to fuck someone again ? That´s like minus 3 points for me.  <br>Nico is like a cool older brother to Nina<br><br>It's pretty fucking cute</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does fuck someone  at the high point of her withdrawal from the TB meds Barry gave her. </br>  <br>so the first episode was really bad but I gave it another one, I don't see how this is going to get better, dropped</br>  <br> Umbrella was on the other side, they lost the war </br>  <br>Ditto. It's shit.</br>  <br>Which one will have to pay for it when they do?</br>  <br> Midget <br><br>Is Nic really a manlet? He doesn't look that short.</br></br></br>    Even Tsutchie can't save this.  <br>169 cm, or 5'5.5" in fat.</br>  <br>The happy trail is pubic hair.</br>  <br>Deaf Moe Muscle Manlet, very nice.<br> Captcha wants me to select the mountains. <br>How insensitive.</br></br></br>  <br> 1.69 <br><br>Poor guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Does being asexual suck? Or is it just whatever?</br>  <br>He's my height! I wonder how much he weighs.</br>  Is this worth watching? The characters look really hot  I want to fuck Nick  <br>He never really grew up, did he?</br>  <br> not knowing it was childish tripe the moment it was announced </br>  Why is a slanty eyed oriental midget called Nicolas?  <br>What's Iskandar doing there?</br>  <br>Likely an alias, or he was adopted by a family that gave him the name.</br>  <br>Disgusting sluts the both of them.</br>  <br>Because  it was probably his mum who was Asian and she was killed by his dad after she gave birth. </br>  typical toonami anime <br><br>Nothing wrong with that. The manga is rad too. Cool to see a good adaption of it. <br><br>Nina a miracle of the universe.</br></br></br></br>  What was that blank paper the doctor gave Nina?  I thought Nina was voiced by HanaKana.  It took me until Worick said 'baby' to realise he is voiced by Junichi Suwabe. It seems so obvious now.  <br><br>Underrated asshole.<br><br>I bet they fuck doggy style too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, made me laugh.</br>  <br>Fucking hell he is so hot, makes me wonder why I've been fapping to girly twinky 2d boys all this time</br>  <br>He's qter as a shota to be honest.</br>  <br> Woric <br><br>I read that as Wojak</br></br></br>  <br>They're both extremely cute shotas but sometimes I forget I'm attracted to adult males as well</br>  <br>Alex is pure though.</br>  The yaoi hands are strong in this one.    <br> Nico x Nina is better <br> Nico x Worick is better <br> Scarface x arm is better </br></br></br>  <br>She  will be a great fuck in a few years. </br>  <br>I always get really anxious whenever a child shows up in a show like this.<br>Especially after what happened in Black Lagoon, and EVERYTHING that happened in Jormungand.</br></br>   'Gangsta' that look like football players <br><br>No.</br></br>  Wait, it's actually called Gangsta? It's not a joke name /a/ made up? Holy jesus  <br>No, Gangsta is just an acronym</br>  <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>Picked up.</br></br>   All those Nicholas ass shots in the second episode <br>Based Manglobe</br>  <br>We might have filled our damaged children quota with about every character's backstory and all the Twilights.</br>  <br>that made me diamond hard.<br>but he was wrong, she already is!</br></br>  <br><br> except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing. <br><br>How is this aesthetically unappealing?<br>You a fag son?</br></br></br></br></br>  So everyone is actually speaking in english, right?  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Yep. You can expect a decent dub for the amerifats soon.</br>  <br> ottermode is shit <br><br>Get hueg and swole like a bear or a warrior.</br></br></br>  <br>There may be QUALITY, but the ass shots look great.<br>As usual, Manglobe has the best priorities.</br></br>  <br>Worik? More like whore-ik?</br>  <br>I always thought it was Italian, it seems like the show is set in pseudo-Italy.</br>  <br>Nah, it's English. The signs are in English.</br>  <br> As a straight man, I prefer my men to be shaven clean </br>  <br>people speak english in italy. hope you know that</br>  <br>They don't only have signs in English, nice try.</br>  <br>He said  I want to  hold hands with Nina  </br>  <br>Fuck off Nina is pure</br>  Why does he wear eyepatch?  <br>Because he doesn't want to show people his disgusting fucked up eye socket.</br>  <br>Because  his papa burnt his eye with a cigarette. </br>  <br>If this is true, I'm gonna be sad</br>    <br>My god</br>  <br>I wouldn't lie to you, Anon.</br>  <br>It's fine  Nico killed all his abusive family </br>   black tag makes fun of pro tag for using a sword in an age of guns <br> uses his fists and random objects as a weapon <br>:\</br></br>  Could someone tell me what the fuck was going on here?  <br> Did he do that out of spite because Wallace bought out his dad or out of protectiveness/gratitude? I've always wondered. </br>  <br>it's a blank paper, it indicates to the emptiness of her personality, since she's a whore, it's a medical diagnostic</br>  <br>I keep seeing this shota demon, who is he?</br>  <br>Likely  both </br>  <br>Mikhail,  one of the tagged hunters that shows up in volume 4. </br>  <br>Not even</br>  <br> Volume 4 <br><br>Shit. No chances of him showing up in the anime then, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how quickly they progress through the arcs. The mangas later volumes are much more action intense so they can choose to draw it out or shorten it.</br>  <br> He already did show up, anon. </br>  <br><br>Well shit, guess I'll have to read the mango</br></br>  why does noto mamiko only get roles where she's beaten and violated now?<br><br>what happened to her career?</br></br>  <br>Yeah that was fuggin regarded</br>  <br>It wouldn't be nice if they just rushed everything though. <br><br>Kinda wanted to wait till the anime was over, but, fuck it. I'll read the manga.<br><br><br>Where?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out the silhouettes in the big black weeaboo slaying scene.  If it was just the one silhouette it wouldn't be clear, but he's very often featured with another lead character who matched up with the other person in that scene. </br>  <br>Dummy.</br>   Literal powerlevels <br>well this escalated quickly</br>  <br>lol this.<br>So a B ranked just got absolutely destroyed by an A. Didnt realize A&gt;B massively. <br><br>Where is the S rank</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should. Didn't Worick dream in this episode? It was in chapter 2 in the manga. Probably a change for the better though.</br>  <br>Ginger is the only S rank that we know of so far. S/5.</br>  <br>A/0 is meant to be the highest rank but  Nico is also called "faker" because he gained his rank by beating higher ranked people than him and he overdoses on that drug to give himself a boost/edge when fighting. In reality he's closer to a B/4 </br>  Do we know how long this one will be? One cour or two?  <br>I completely forgot about that they were in this scene in the manga.</br>    I love Mikhail but he seems kinda out of place sometimes.  What the fuck is wrong with these guys? Who straight up drinks this shit?  <br>He has brain problems.</br>  <br>Europe</br>  <br>During the '80s that shit was like champagne.</br>  fujoshit  <br> I said it again! </br>  <br>but his brother and mother didn't even do shit</br>  <br>this is so moe I can't stand it</br>  <br> Junichi Suwabe <br>I had no idea at all till he went full dandy either.</br></br>  <br> They might not have done shit but they didn't exactly try and stop the abusive father either. I mean, Wallace had bruises 90% of the time, usually visible ones and he was pretty much secluded from them. </br>  <br><br>Is it okay to be homo for SuwaJun?</br></br>  <br>No. It's okay if you're GAR for him, though.</br>  <br>S rank move so fast they almost teleport</br>  I would read an entire series about these two as shotas.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Shota Nic is the fucking cutest, jesus christ</br>  <br>The B rank was B-2, while Nico was A-0.<br>So it's not just one power level, it's however many the highest number is +2.</br></br>  <br>He's only Asian on his mom's side.</br>  <br>Retard moe.</br>  <br>She's around. If they get far into adapting then you'll see them at the tail end of the broadcast.</br>  <br>me too I want him to hold me gently and mutter obscenities at me</br>  <br>Nic is made for cuddling.</br>  <br>It's superior nipponesian bait folded over a million times<br>there's at least 2^1 000 000 layers to the bait</br></br>  <br>Yes. Body hair's normal, shaving your nuts and stomach is fucking weird. Or waxing or whatever you fairies do. Flipping out over a man not having groomed his pubic area to your liking can only mean you're a giant fucking faggot.</br>  <br>So what were they doing if not fucking?</br>  <br>Epilating is superior to both.<br><br>Just saying.</br></br></br>  <br>Worick was having a shower and Alex was puttering about and answering calls.</br>  There is no excuse to make this into a proper anime now right?  <br>Same. They're so cute and I really like their character designs</br>  <br>Only the very beginning was good.</br>  So how about that naked Worick in the OP?  <br>Spin it around so Shouko-chan is a cold-ass killer for hire besides the regular stuff in the manga and you got something.</br>  What is the deal with Dogtags?<br>What is are the Twilights?<br>What are the pills for?</br></br>  <br>Read either the manga or this thread.</br>  <br> &gt;Twilight (黄昏, Koukon) is the title given to the children and descendants of those who used the Celebre drug. While Ergastulum was created to control and house Twilights due to an influx of them after the war, they are still a source of controversy. Anti-Twilight factions are prominent in the city despite pro-Twilight support from three of the four Big Fathers.<br><br> From birth, they are registered and controlled using tags embedded with chips that monitor their vital signs. Thus, they are also known as "Tagged". These tags also have their rank - speculated to be a measure of the Twilight's strength - with D/5 (the default) being the lowest and S/0 the highest. After a Twilight's confirmed death, they are automatically deleted from their category and their family registration. Every record of their existence is erased. <br><br> Celebrer can be administered via three methods: pills, injections or bullets. Twilights require a controlled, continued amount of Celebrer in order to stay alive, as it maintains their vital functions and negates pain. Failure to regularly take Celebrer results in withdrawal symptoms, including dizzy spells, nausea, palpitations and migraines. More severe cases include haemorrhages, convulsions, hypothermia, hallucinations, laboured breathing and other irregularities in cardiopulmonary activity--after a certain amount of time, death occurs. Because a Twilight must take Celebrer to control their withdrawal symptoms, it's assumed that if a Twilight has children, they will also be Twilights. </br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>They're for identifying fellow Twilights.<br>Humans and the children of humans who were experimented on in a government supersoldier program.<br>Medication, it gives them strength and stamina greater than the average human and it also prevents them from seizure and cardiac arrest that will occur if they don't take them. Basically meant to control them.</br></br></br>  I just watched the opening on youtube<br>is this Fujishit?<br>kinda looks like it from the op, just half naked men getting dressed</br></br>  <br>Do you epilate your pubic hair?</br>  <br><br><br><br>So basically, nanomachine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Now leave.</br>  <br>But a anime movie is already confirmed....</br>  <br>Yeah its hardcore gay sex every episode</br>  <br> just half naked men getting dressed <br> hurr fujoshit <br><br>Go back to hibike thread faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> getting mad on the internet </br>  <br>Yeah bro, it comes with a sensitive area cap for that purpose.

The OP was disappointing, but I'm digging the music. ED is pretty dope, too. Bit of a slow start, but I imagine they've got some set-up to do, so I'll see how it pans out.    <br>It's a slum city because it was originally meant to be a quarantine for all the Twilights like Nico.</br>  <br>Yeah, the music is pretty top tier. Really chill.</br>  <br>Is every thread going to be full of posts like this? Why are straightfags so fucking retarded? If I want to avoid a series with female fanservice I just google it and check the tags/genre/reviews.</br>  <br><br>so it's set in Australia?</br></br>  <br>Might as well be.</br>  <br><br>Fucking this.<br><br>Let me just info dump to this cum dumpster she clearly cares. <br><br>is the manga this bad?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was this again?</br>   Nic's face   <br>Like a bad Elvis impersonation</br>  <br>Chapter 10, but it's not even on-screen, Anon.</br>  <br>Is that neymar</br>  <br>No wait, it's chapter 11.</br>  <br>Thanks for telling me, even if it doesn't show</br>  <br>are you deaf?</br>  <br>I think it was him giving her a clean slate.

Currently the guild is being led by Gina Paulklee whose rank is unknown. As far as S ranks go, the manga's only shown/confirmed one and that's, S/5 rank Ginger, member of the guild, and the sleeping lesbo in  </br>  <br>How big is the powergap between an A/0 and S/5?</br>  Best boy when  <br><br>Drunk visit to the tattoo parlor when?</br></br>  <br> matching tattoos <br> isn't a fujoshi show <br> no homo </br></br></br>  <br> The manga hasn't really shown a full blown fight between an A/0 and a S, but you can only assume the gap is significant considering what Nic did to the B/2 with relative ease. </br>  Man, Alex is a fucking whore  Knowing nothing about the manga I was pleasantly surprised by how likeable the two main characters are. Cute loli nurse is a bonus. I sort of thought this was gonna be a shitty grimdark blood and guts type thing, and so far it is, but at least is has some fun elements.  <br>But B/2 to A/0 is quite a gap, but A/0 to S/5 is just one step.</br>  <br>anon you don't have a matching tattoo with your best bro?</br>  <br>Welp vol 7 of the manga went on sale in Nipland today, so maybe we'll find out soon.</br>  <br> She's so fast Nic was swinging his sword and she appeared a meter behind him. Erica and Mikhail ran when she appeared. She tends to end fights quickly so we haven't seen how powerful she is yet. </br>  <br> matching tattoo with your best "bro" </br>    <br>So basically it's like Deus-Ex all over again? <br><br>I kinda like that concept though.</br></br></br>  <br>She'd be a great fuck now.</br>  <br>Nicholas is the perfect blend of strangely cute and badass.</br>  Underwater vs Horriblesubs - quality of subs<br><br>/a/ go</br></br>  <br>Watch it raw</br>  <br>I like brown women</br>  <br><br>Why don't you go back there then?</br></br>  <br>On one hand I got drunk and branded myself with the rest of me company on my ass so I feel like I'm justified calling you a retard. <br><br>On the other hand the military is really fucking gay so I'm not going to</br></br></br>  <br>HS is using funi's subs, why are you even asking.</br>  So wait, is Big Boss superhuman too ?

Do they have enough content?  <br>They can pad it out with some of the side chapters from 3rei.</br>  <br>If they make a cliffhanger end  and announce 3rei , yes<br><br>they used 16 of 27 manga chapter in the first part, they need to use Side chapters of zwei and drei (like Rin remember kid Shiro) and add more fanservice/extra Scenes (Like Luvia Butler v/s Bazet )</br></br></br>  <br> bigger bust than Leys <br><br>Oy vey<br><br> Why the fuck are Luvia's measurements still unknown </br></br></br></br></br>  Will we get this chapter?  I'm surprised you guys are so sure that SL would do 3rei. It's obvious that they enjoy animate the cute lolis / fanservice part of Prisma the most while battle is just side dish, 3rei is the opposite with pretty much non-step action so I doubt they even have the budget for it to not look like shit.  Why are all the best Type-moon not written by Nasu?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they went with an anime original ending to the series. Beyond what you said, 3rei is a big investment. It's as long as 2wei at this point and it keeps on going, so that's two whole seasons to factor in.</br>  <br>When is Gil going to appear? mid-seasonish? I don't follow the manga beyond spoiler pages in Fate threads but I've heard good things about the Gil alter (?) fight.</br>  <br>Endou Aya if they keep the old VA.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for them to exploit Kuro's underlying pranalust for Gil</br>  <br>They can make a original ending for zwei and if they make drei they can make a original start episode (like they need to check the zone where Illya fight gil)</br>  <br>I hope you're not talking about Prisma here. Other than fanservice for TM audience and pedophiles, this series has nothing else to offer. Flat characters, failed attempt at serious plot in 3rei, aweful humor.</br>  <br>He's the final boss of 2wei<br><br>Then he becomes a protagonist in 3rei and eventually peaces out because the writers didn't know what to do with him anymore</br></br></br>  <br> The first to tip a fedora </br>  <br>Aside from the beach shenanigans, the rest of 2wei is fighting against Gil, there's a couple of good fights, especially the one involving Bazett.<br>The fight people usually talk about is one of Ko-Gil vs an homunculus using his card in 3rei.</br></br>  <br>That is a good option, we won't be left with a cliffhanger and they can still start 3rei later if they feel like it. I prefer them to gather enough budget before touching 3rei at all.<br><br>However if they didn't go to the alternative world right after the fight then what would to Gil and his card?</br></br></br>  <br>He's been way for like one chapter, just give it time, I'm sure him and Kotomine are up to something.</br>  <br>I feel like they're going to make KoGil show up for more than he did in the manga, in terms of not being his Alter form and talking to Illya and the crew. I feel like they'll add a few scenes for him.</br>  <br>It's so weird that he just left like that. At the start I thought him and Kirei were scheming something together for sure but nothing came out of it. Part 3 sure have lots of anti-climax situations.</br>  <br><br><br>Man Ilya a cute</br></br></br>  <br>The first priority right now is info dumping, we really don't know a lot about what the fuck happened in that last fight. Then I'm sure some Gil and Kirei shenanigans will happen.</br>  <br> info dumping <br>I was really expecting this, but when I was rereading the manga I realize there's really not much to tell, Miyu has already given quite a lot of information during the 3 series.  Miyu's Kiritsugu is dead, for example. </br></br>  <br>Still better than drei. Shit goes more over the edge forgetting about sol parts and fanservice. I got into this for lolis not this holy grail bullshit again.</br>    Next chapter when?  <br> Flat characters, <br><br>You mean delicious flat characters.</br></br></br>  <br>26th.</br>  <br>That's an impressively-sized black knight greatsword.</br>  this and carnival phantasm are the only good things to come from the TM franchise  <br>Or they can just adapt as is since 3rei has a potential for more character goods.</br>  <br>Why does Miyu looks so serious there? She's surrounded by Illyas in slutty clothes, that's like her heaven.</br>  So well get<br><br> Episode 1: Beach Party <br> Episode 2: Attack on MudGil, end with him breaking free <br> Episode 3: Attack on MudGil pt2, with ZweiForm Illya <br> Episode 4: Drawback into the parallelworld <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br> Miyu's puffy vulva outline  <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br>Miyu is without a doubt the lewdest Prisma.</br>  <br><br><br>Is this the first time takeuchi has drawn miyu?</br></br></br>    <br> not Kuro <br>Kuro is also a slut.</br></br>  <br> Mimi most popular among Illya's friends <br> Illya, Kuro, and Miyu head and shoulders above everyone else <br>All is right with the world.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin above Luvia  <br><br>Legit great taste from Japan for once.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Illya</br>  <br> best girl in a three way tie for last <br>Fuck you two, Japan.</br></br>  <br> two <br>Time for bed.</br></br>  <br>OHOHOHO Rin pleases studio staffs for votes!</br>  <br>Jesus Christ is her pussy trying to eat its way out of her clothes?</br>  <br>They skipped some shit from 2wei already though. I just want the Shirou beach episode, dammit.</br>    <br> Shirou beach episode <br>I'm sure they can still adapt that.</br></br>  <br>I think I'm getting my timeline mixed up. The beach is pretty much right after the first Bazette fight, right?</br>  <br>wont it be the first episode?</br>  <br>They already showed a bit of it in the trailer.</br>  <br>Most people are just waiting for the shit that happens after this season especially Shirou, Gil, Kotomine, and all the other husbandos<br><br>Although the Extra chapters are probably the ones people want the most.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuko doesn't have nearly enough votes.</br>    <br>They'll probably skip around some parts though. I'm pretty sure Shirou is not as prominent in the anime as he is in the manga.</br>  Who do you think they're going to pick to eventually voice Tanaka? I could actually see  Chiaki Omigawa  working out.  <br> Fate／kaleid liner PRISMAILLYA.zip  https://mega.nz/#!TwtU1LCJ!7_4QMbN3<wbr>YHZli4W_IaHXva4QNSfc4i8t8WjwO3PoRfo<wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>Complete up-to-date manga.</br></br>  <br> doujin-artist-turned-mangaka is more skilled than a longtime professional VN character designer <br>Takeuchi needs to step it up and move beyond his same-face problems already. It's been over a decade now and he gets more work than ever.</br></br>  Where was Miyu during UBW?  <br> to another world <br>Yeah, to a world of some actual fucking proper action. Ikuzo, motherfuckers!</br></br>  <br>Probably was never born or died in the fire.</br>  <br>wait so shirou the fucker had a lil sis called miyu that died in the fire and he forgot?<br><br><br>That would be some serious plot twist</br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. She's never mentioned anywhere outside of Prisma. She might have simply not existed.</br>  <br>Someone should abduct the writers of both fate and prisma illya and hold them hostage until they answered all of /a/´s questions</br>  Next ch is finally supposed to address Miyu and her Shirou's past right?  <br>Yep. Should be a doozy. It's got a lot to cover.</br>  <br>yup<br><br>wanna see more imouto-miyu</br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought in F/SN Shirou mentioned a Sister who died in the fire.</br></br>  <br>If he does, I certainly don't remember.

The One power and shit would look great animated + awesome sword fights, harem, and giant battles.</br>    Different studio for each tale  <br>I was watching the live-action adaptation and it was so terrible that I couldn't make it past the first ten or so minutes.</br>  <br><br>I think you've been reading too many trap doujins if that is what you interpreted from Ender's Game <br><br><br>oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be terrible. Incestfags would scream there's not enough Ender x Valentine content.<br>All the political net writing would be full of emoji. Yaoi fags would not even pick it up until shower scene. And you can bet your ass some retard would cram in 'floating with toast in the mouth in zero G' scene.</br></br>  <br> oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato <br><br>They should do End of Hyperion, I think a diffferent studio for each tale would highlight the differences between storytellers<br><br>It would also not spoil a twist</br></br></br></br></br>  Farseer trilogy  <br>Movie wasn't THAT bad if you read the book before.<br>Shit went sanic fast though and they went full retard with the Formic fleet.</br></br>  <br>Branden Sanderson's Stormlight series would be neato.</br>    <br> Branden  <br><br> wtf. <br><br>Stormlight would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD. I read those when i was in like 5th grade yo. That takes me fucking back. I still have the little shitty amulet you get with the box set.</br>  This would make one epic space opera.    Just make the martians look more like dark elves and you have an awesome sci-fi series.  Just read this series, Time slowing, western style gunslingers in a fantasy setting would be pretty fucking cool. Plus weird giant metal abominations that widows with swords have to kill.   All of these scifi genreplebs <br>disgusting<br><br>I cast my vote for a series of collected short stories by Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Concur on this. Its single character centric enough to be fucking great as an anime.</br></br>  <br>hurr a raven made me kill myself</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus fucking Christ, why are book covers always so fucking horrible?<br><br>Really, it's just one image you need. One fucking painting or drawing. Not that hard, you incompetent shitheels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Books 2, 3, and 4 should each get a 2 cour adaptation.<br>Then, after, they can make the first book into 2 or 3 prequel movies.</br></br></br>  The Witcher series seems tailor-made to be an anime.  I actually am surprised Ender's Game never got animooted in the 80s or whenever the nips were nutty for western SF.    <br>Right? When the stuff that's inside them is so great, the cover really just makes you wonder, what in the fuck?</br>  <br><br>next book when<br/></br></br>  <br> scifi genreplebs <br> Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe </br></br>  I just want my 2D Luna Lovegood  <br>Dont judge a book by its cover<br>˙͜&gt;˙</br></br>  <br>Exactly, thank you. I've never been able to understand this shit.<br><br>It seems that every publisher under the sun took that saying as a license to churn out shitty covers.</br></br></br>  <br>Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>I laughed harder than I should have at this</br>  Pic related would be amazing, but I don't think enough nips read Narnia as kids to get hooked in.  <br>No they should do 1 and 2 side by side jumping back and forth between Ender and Bean..</br>  <br>That's why when i Said Wheel of Time i didn't post a cover. They are the furthest from what the book is actually like that you could possibly get.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to process Conrad's style?</br>    <br>In a series full of absolutely shit characters, Luna stands out as a bastion of purity and moe.</br>  <br>Don't ever push Brandon Sanderson. That fuck writes like a god damned machine.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Here, have some Perrin Fan art.</br>  Anyone read this shit as a kid? Literally perfect for an anime adaption.  <br>Jesus Christ Superstar: The Anime</br>      <br>If he takes long enough, he can let some up-and-comer turn stormlight book 10 into 3 more novels!<br><br> He actually has a progress bar on his website. 8% through the first draft ;_; </br></br></br>  This would be perfect as an anime.  <br/>  Last to First Men and Starmaker.  I would love to see a proper adaption of Moby-Dick, but it honestly wouldn't translate well. Moby-Dick uses the written medium to its fullest potential. <br><br>Anything by Nathaniel Hawthorne or Mark Twain would be cool too. A lot of Le Guin's novels might work well as anime: The Lathe of Heaven, The Left Hand of Darkness, etc. <br><br>Also, Little, Big.<br><br><br>I read that book about a month ago and it was fucking terrible. I literally could not get myself to finish reading the last 40 or so pages, so I ended up dropping it, which is something I never do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you imagine the huge uproar this would cause if this show was aired in the United States?<br><br>I know this is completely unrelated to the thread, but man, fuck the west.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind the other stuff he's writing too, I mean. He's already got an extensive universe going on with Mistborn and Elantris, AND warbreaker.</br>  <br>Why do people think Ender's Shadow is the second book?<br>It's the fifth.<br>All the shadow books (anything that's not the first 4) can be ignored.<br>The first book can be ignored too actually - It's really just an extraneous backstory.<br> mfw most people didn't even read the best part of the series </br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to see an old-school sword and sorcery series get an anime, maybe Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.  Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation.  <br><br> Read series back in late-elementary/early-middle school <br> Even made an entire board-game about it as a school project <br> Found out there was an anime a couple years ago. <br> mfw <br>Now I really want to see the sequel series adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This book is garbage.</br>  <br>Wait. <br><br> anime <br><br>IT HAS AN ANIME?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delicious brown elf version of Dark They Were and Golden Eyed </br>  <br>stop demeaning people's religious texts, anon</br>  <br>No, it's literal garbage. It has no idea what it wants to be.<br><br>Fuck, the Shaver Mysteries are better than Battlefield Earth. And least that sticks with a tone.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if they looked like this</br>  I'm surprised no one has suggested this yet.  <br>it was a (admittedly bad) Scientology joke, calm down</br>  Or a series set in the Sprawl.

The initial prototype. So they are not the same. TNH was lighter and had different armament.<br>Pz 39 aka LTH is moreover based on LTL tank, which was smaller and even lighter than TNH.<br><br>Ironically enough, the very LTL tank never entered service as it was meant, thanks to Soviet annexation of Lithuania, and was later redesigned into LT-40 for Slovakia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> what is foreshadowing since episode motherfucking one? </br>  <br>Different info that I had.

Not being a dick. That's the actual answer right here in front of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Constant near misses are historically accurate, while also being good for drama. Remember that almost all shots in GuP are taken on the move on a moving target which is never a good way to actually hit something.<br><br>Also that, again for the sake of drama, the tanks are faster that real life across the board while the tank engagements are usually closer than they would have been.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking size matters in GuP </br>  <br>My point is that I am German. I can't really tell what's parody and what not because I am German.<br><br>I see the portrayal of the Soviets and the Americans and British and that's nice and so forth but with subs this shit is impossible to figure out for me. I just want to know what non-aryans think about it.</br></br></br>  <br> actually realistically expected result <br> plot armor <br>Choose one. It would be plot armor if you were depicting a character standing in the open in front of multiple automatic weapons at 10 meters and somehow not being mowed down (every Rambo movie, I'm looking in your general direction). But if you're depicting WW2 tanks firing on the move, they actually hitting anything would be... unexpecetd. Kindly notice not only , but even the very thread caped in the post you quote actually comments on that.<br><br><br> speed <br>To make it a bit more specific: the tanks are SAID to be moving at their real historical speed (example, episode 8, they're said to be going 20 Km/h), yet they are DEPICTED as if they were moving at roughly twice as fast for aestetics purposes. They don't give some tanks "boots of seven leagues" and not to others.<br><br><br>also<br><br>Of course the depiction of German-themed school is stereotipical as fuck. That's the series' whole point.

There's no such zombie story where suddenly the zombies are defeated and humanity rebuilds to what it once was.  <br>The anime will never be able to do the suffering as good as the manga anon, trust me.</br>  <br> he doesn't like hats </br>  <br>Well I know who I don't want in my SoL apocalypse survivor group.</br>  <br>There's that word again.<br>Can we not start this shit please?</br></br>  <br><br>I never really get why people complain about spoilers. Why can't people just enjoy the ride? A good story is entertaining even if you go through it two or three times.</br></br>  <br>How can they be so carefree when straggler zombies occasionally get through the barricade?</br>  <br>Yeah, it'd be depressing as fug to live in a zombie world. <br><br>I mean, sure, you could live, but you'd be looking over your back for the rest of your life.<br><br><br>I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Individual zombies aren't hard to deal with. Just bash their heads in with a baseball bat.</br></br>  What would you do?  <br>It's still better if you don't know what's coming. I still like to rewatch stuff, a lot actually, but being surprised, in real time, by the work itself is undeniably better than hearing about it from someone else before actually seeing it.</br>  <br>let her bite me so we could live happily ever after together</br>  <br>Everything's easier if you kill yourself, anon. The struggle is what makes things worthwhile. <br><br>It's pretty difficult to live in a zombie apocalypse, and you have a good chance to die every day, but I'd rather die fighting zombies than just giving up and never even attempt survival.</br></br></br>  <br>Cure her, make her fall for me then marry her.</br>  <br>They don't occasionally get through. That happens right after a fire and a lot of their barriers were down.</br>  <br>Why don't you just stop trying to act like you feel superior and force other peple to read the manga? You're only ruining the threads with your idiotic attitude faggot.</br>  <br>There is a pink haired girl with brain damage running all around on the floors, and you are expected to follow her whims around. She even goes to the toilet at night. It's not a matter of difficulty of dealing with a single one.</br>  <br>So do they have some kind of endgame? Leaving the school? Finding other survivors? Or is this one of those things where somehow there are no other survivors?</br>  <br>Do you go to the toilet at night, anon?</br>  <br>Blame chink and gook scanlators for being stingy little shits and not making their raws public.</br>  <br>They do leave the school like one or two chapters after this </br>  <br>She will give you zombie STD.</br>  <br>But this is not what Sora no Woto tried.</br>  <br>It's a simple case of risk and return.<br>It's just not worth it when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's different for everyone.  I typically get immersed into something to the point where I just forget everything else the first time through. </br>  <br>this sounds a little bit too familiar</br>  <br><br>Tell her that the toilets are going through indefinite maintenance and have her piss in a bucket. As for bashing the zombies in, tell her that's a new trendy way to greet people.</br></br>  <br> I'm assuming that the cast will slowly dwindle as more and more characters die to zombies or crap, probably with a death directly caused by one of them as a zombie. <br><br>Obviously. No way in hell will the author actually let them survive this. Nobody survives in zombie shows or movies. Even when they fool you into thinking they could, BAM, suddenly the save house they reached is gone because some dick head hid the fact they were bitten or the stupid corporation decided to keep making their zombie juice OR, and this is my personal favorite, a crazy fucker unleashes an experimental zombie in the safe house because "Fuck the world, fuck surviving, let's all meet again in the next life!". There was even a zombie movie that had it's group escape to the Flordia Keys and low and behold, there are zombies there too and they all die.</br></br></br>   All these people who haven't read the manga <br>Seriously? I finished it in a few hours, its not long.</br>  <br>Is the brain damage a permanent thing?</br>  <br> brain damage <br>Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on.<br><br><br>And you think you're any better than him by posting this? replying is going to cause as much shitposting as he is.<br><br><br>It'll all be worth it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the light at the end of the regular life tunnel?<br><br>I'm seriously asking, I just don't know.</br></br></br>  <br>No. She's only pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>It's okay, she needs no explanation of what's going on.</br>  <br>You're ruining them by crying about how people are discussing the series in a thread about it. Fuck off. He obviously is superior since he actually follows the material instead of just coming to 4chan to blindly shitpost like you do.</br>  <br>Wasn't that Dawn of the dead or something?<br>I try not to waste time watching Zombie stuff, because it's all really similar. I mean, seriously.</br></br>  <br> pick up an anime <br> clear starting point <br> clear ending point <br> left satisfied and able to move on after the season ends <br><br> pick up a manga <br> read for 2 years <br> gets delayed for 1 year <br> author starts making chapters again for 3 more years <br> author delays for 2 years <br> picks back up for another 5 years <br> sales go down so author is forced to conclude the story <br> you actually died 4 years ago and never got to finish reading </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its all an act, she knows full well whats going on. <br><br>Then why does she still go to the bathroom at night? That's so dangerous, she should at least do the favor of pissing in the bucket.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure that's fire damage. What kind of idiot would use the lens area for bludgeoning instead of the base? Lenses are a bitch to replace</br>  <br>Because it's not really dangerous. Their barricades are strong and almost the whole school building is clear. Even if she does run into one she'd snap out of pretending to be retarded and deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom.</br>  <br>Fuck her as she is turning</br>  <br><br>Not really. <br><br>The thing is that shows and movies and a lot of other zombie media don't really show you what actually happens to human bodies when left in the sun/cold for prolonged periods of time. Basically, their bodies would collapse within a few months tops. No matter what kind of cool stuff is helping their tissues out... sunlight is not good for your skin. Being out in the elements will destroy your body.<br><br>Shelter actually comes before water on the list of needs for survival. You will certainly die of the elements before you have time to dehydrate.<br><br>In short, the integrity of zombie bodies cannot hold. Even if we assume they can somehow move past death, just the stuff that a body is made of is going to severely degrade and collapse.<br><br>Plus, there's just too many people who actually do have zombie survival plans and supplies. While I didn't invest a lot of time into it, I do have them. Worst case, just chill.<br><br>Something missing from most zombie fiction is great and competent leaders. They do exist, please trust that I am one of them and would work to get things in order. Guys like Rick/etc have leadership thrust upon them and aren't really ready for the weight and haven't done prior planning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> author delays for 2 years <br>This isn't HxH anon, it isn't going to happen.<br>Just read the manga.<br><br><br>Because she's still an idiot. And the school is barricaded so its not really too dangerous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will there be a full flashback of events when the school went down the shithole?  <br> deal with it like she did the one time it happens in the classroom. <br><br>But she's usually unarmed. That time she was lucky she had a broom.</br></br></br>  <br>Running from a single zombie isn't hard.</br>  <br>Feeling comfy with your life and smiling before dying.</br>  <br>They mentioned she was broken for days, but suddenly got up and she was got more genki than ever before. I just wonder how broken inside is she, that she can put this act up every day.</br>  <br>But your waifu accepted him. She even fed him with the taste of survival. Would you really utter such cold words to her if she had to mercy kill him in the anime?</br>  <br>Only one, and it shows why they survived.<br>And a little something else.</br></br>   DIE <br>SUKI~</br>  <br>Your theory doesn't work in Resident Evil universe  shittiest zombie franchise imo </br>  I think Gakkou Gurashi could make a good VN or adventure game. With all the possible ways to die/lose.<br><br> Having to escape/kill a zombie or be killed <br><br> Try to immediately approach the helicopter instead of proceeding cautiously, get literally blown the fuck out <br><br> That chapter where Miki must find the serum for the infection, if you take too long in getting the serum and coming back,   Yuuri will have killed Kurumi when you return <br><br>Stuff like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yet The Walking Dead is a very popular show despite the fact that we all know how it ends. All of them dead or if the author wants to be an asshole, it ends on a scene with whoever huddled up and ready to tackle yet another horde of zombies coming for them with no denial or confirmation that the character or characters survive the confrontation with a scratch that will turn them soon or no wounds whatsoever so they can continue fighting in a world that's no longer there's.</br>  Good night guys taking a break from this suffering  <br>I also follow the source material.<br><br> And you think you're any better than him by posting this? <br>No, but people need a reminder to stop acting like idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, I think that's good enough for me.</br>  <br> The franchise where zombies can walk indefinitely without any form of nourishment <br> Their bodies barely even break down even in places it obviously would <br>I always hated that.</br></br></br>  <br>How did she not catch the zombie STD if zombie blood got in her eye?</br>  <br> All resistance is futile when you're outnumbered 10000 to 1. <br>Zombies are like lepers, they'll eventually fall apart from their everyday shamblings. Doubly so if they actually need humans for sustenance.<br>Time is on your side; stay alive in your foxhole and you'll get to repopulate the world someday.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember to lock the door.</br>  <br>Which is exactly why there's no point in watching it. Why waste your time watching something bleak, hopeless, and depressing, that isn't even entertaining on top of that?</br>  That first episode was so fucking disappointing. Holy shit, did they stretch that shit out. It would have been so much better if they got that shit over with by A part and spent B part on actual survival stuff. Everyone knew what this series is and yet Lerche fucking exaggerated the reveal. 3/10 about as mediocre as Hamatora.  I wonder if I would realize something was off before the end if I didn't know what it was about already. There are a lot of subtle hints. Even the mood is kind of off. But I'm not sure. Might have just dropped it.  <br>I don't care how much Shovel likes the dog, i can't stand the mongrel. He's only there to die anyway.<br><br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I’m the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces. <br><br><br><br>Washing it out? I don't know ask the author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the strongest of all.</br>  <br> Everyone knew what this series is <br>/a/nons are not everyone</br></br>  <br>It's been confirmed that zombification works on every mammal.</br>  <br><br>I genuinely looked up the series to see if it would stay this fucking boring or if I should finish the first episode.<br><br>Hope the second one's more exciting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that all of what has been done in the first episode is the authors fault</br>  <br> He's only there to die anyway. <br><br>Him and everyone who isn't named Yuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Like, where did it come from? How does it even work?<br><br>How did a disease spread by someone staggering around drunkenly and attacking actually manage to make it so far?</br></br></br>  <br> Washing it out? <br>That's not how it works. You can catch every disease by getting the patient's blood in your eyes that are not normally transmittable.</br></br>  <br>I mean it's the same problems with everything zombie related.</br>  <br>The very existence of zombies could deny your theory.<br>It's unnatural for a body to move after death. Where does it even draw its energy from when all its organs have shut down.<br>Expecting them to simply decompose because it's "common sense" is unreasonable.<br><br>You could make an argument about still 'living' zombies, such as in  The last of us , more so since the fungus does exist.<br>But in that case, when the host approaches its death it finds a good spot and spreads its spores, so waiting on them to die naturally is even more problematic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think too hard about it. This ride is about despair and slice of life.</br>  <br>They're not dead.<br>They're just... retarded.</br></br>  <br>If you did, you wouldn't be so upset about spoilers. Stop acting like an idiot.</br>  <br>Read up the summaries. The English and Japanese ones both end with something along the lines of "there's something more to this shit." The Japanese Wikipedia page straight up says there are zombies in its two page story outline.</br>  Not enough Kurumi/Taroumaru interaction this episode.  <br>The only thing about the virus known so far is that the government knew before hand and its man made.<br><br><br>Well, maybe it doesn't work that way.<br>Its a made up disease anyway who knows how it works.<br><br><br>Rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, okay, even with that. There are people who are good tactical leaders who want to live with all of their might and are not going to let odds that are hopeless, terrible, depressing-- whatever-- trample them.<br><br>While our present society keeps us out of constant threat and danger and shelters us from facing the threat of death on a daily basis, it hasn't always been the situation. We've made it through times that we couldn't even realize were horrible because they were the everyday.<br><br>Ultimately, great leaders cope with these problems. A zombie series that I think you guys should read is the Newsflesh trilogy. In my opinion, it shows a more realistic outcome of a zombie "apocalypse". However, in the worst case, even later on in the Walking Dead you will see competent leaders and what they can do.<br><br>We've been to the moon. We didn't die to nuclear war. This zombie thing could and would be dealt with and if it happened I'd give it my best. There's other people who would too. Sorry to be cheesy, but the "oh we're all doomed" attitude is something I want to remedy.<br><br>Love this show though. Great setup. Disagree with people who thought the SOL was too long, it was really needed to build setting, drop hints, and hit hard. Also dat fang.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Two sentence story outline I meant to say.</br>  <br>The problem with those scenarios is that people either have never seen a movie or have only seen the wrong ones and make really stupid decisions. Honestly in a walking biter-type zombie situation there would be a very large amount of survivor strongholds even if you assume stupidity allowed the zombies to spread. As  said the elements would destroy most of the infected within a month or two even assuming they could move and attack after a full "death" effect. It's the airborne disease and/or sprinter type like in Left 4 Dead or I Am Legend that would actually do severe damage.</br>  <br> 0 budget </br>  <br> Think about it <br> Ruined forever <br>Welp, guess I'll skip ahead and read the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br>You're one to talk. Don't bully Taroumaru. See<br/></br>  How do you people stand Yuki<br><br>she's so fucking autistic</br></br>  <br>Recent zombies make zombies fast ass fuckers but classical zombies are slow as shit and it makes you wonder why you would need to be afraid of a rotting, slow ass motherfucker.<br><br>Can you imagine a zombie trying to hike up a steep mountain with their missing muscles or limbs?<br><br>Zombies can't get /fit/ anymore which makes them easy tier horror monsters to kill.</br></br></br></br></br>  I really want to rehabilitate this woman... with my penis, if you catch my drift.<br><br>And then I'll marry her.</br></br>  <br>Are the kinmosas already zombies?</br>  <br>Because classic zombies swarm.</br>  <br> How do you people stand Yuki <br>The same way I tolerate you.</br></br>  <br>And Megu-nee is fucking retarded for not taking the proper measures.</br>  <br>Well sorry, i just don't want to get attached to a dog who i know is gonna be dead in about 3 or 4 episodes.<br><br><br>I'll take shovel then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. The usagis too.</br>  <br>she's cute</br>  <br>Oh come on, at least pretend to care for her sake. Or would you actually pat her on the back after the deed and say something like <br> good job of getting rid of the stinky mutt, zombie waifu </br></br>  <br> &gt;I'll take shovel then. <br>Literally spoiled goods. Enjoy she-wesker while she lasts.</br></br>  <br>Then why get attached to another dead character like shovel?</br>  <br>It's pretty easy if you are not a faggot.</br>  How innocent and heartfelt.  <br> IYAAAA! BELL-KUN, DON'T TOUCH ME THERE~ </br>  <br>Megu-nee didn't know anything about the virus when shit first started going down either. She wasn't able to get to the booklet with information in it until they cleared the third and second floors. She had no way to take proper measures for this.</br>  <br>Rize would manage.</br>  <br><br>How many episodes until we get berserk Chino?</br></br>  <br>Chiya is alive and well!</br>    <br>I'd probably just tell her its all gonna be daijoubu.<br>While inside i wouldn't care.<br><br>No matter how much you pester me I will never like this dog.<br><br><br><br>Now that is just rude.<br>She'll make it, i know it!   ;_;  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 18 year old </br>  <br> We didn't die to nuclear war. <br>dude, give us a chance. it's only been 70 years</br></br>  <br>The Ayayayas had to fuse up into Kurumi to survive.<br>Then she became zombie Chiyo.<br><br>Good job, morons.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She'll make it, i know it!    ;_;  <br>Everything will be daijoubu.</br></br>  <br> THE DOG IS ALREADY DEAD </br>  <br>Yeah, well, fuck you. I know the dog's gonna die but I'll be sad.<br>We know Yuki'll be the sole survivor because  pink is always best girl. <br><br>Deal with it. Like the dog.</br></br></br></br>  I thought the episode was great. <br><br>The couple of changes to the original story are just big enough to keep people who have already read the manga interested to see what has been changed, while leaving the premise untouched.<br><br>I predict two things: <br>1. we'll get a flashback episode that explains how Miki gets to the school<br>2. Taroumaruu's 'disappearance' in the manga was extremely uneventful since the audience never quite sees it. Keeping the dog around to participate in club activities is a good thing. <br><br>I'm calling it now: episode 4, flat side with the shovel, in the sleeping quarters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Never forget.  <br>The other girls seemed to see him when it jumped on the table.</br>  Anime added hints that weren't in the manga, though I'm not sure whether it was intended:<br><br> Megu-nee: I'll have to write another apology letter because of Taroumaru running around the school. <br> Kurumi: Hey, we didn't have any causalities, it's all good. <br>   Megu-nee: I'M a casualty! </br></br></br></br>  Pink is the only good thing about this show. Unfortunately she's in the wrong fucking anime. Leave it to Japan to create ridiculously cute girls and then have them suffer.  <br>It will be daijoubu! i can feel it in my bones!<br><br><br>Very dead. Like. Shovel dead.<br><br><br> We know Yuki'll be the sole survivor <br>  Please no ;_;  <br><br>And, fuck the dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I assume you've watched Black Bullet?</br>  <br> the dog was only around for a chapter in the manga, and since it had been bit already, megu-nee seemed to have it chained up the whole time it was still alive. Maybe the dog is getting a whole diffferent backstory if he's not just a delusion </br>  <br>We've already been over the fact that the dog is getting a main role. And that role is being a tear jerker.</br>  <br>The virus probably has two stages: one that spread invisibly and created a large outbreak, and the later stage that only spreads through bites.<br><br>If the virus isn't present in zombie blood, but is present in their mouths, it's likely it makes more changes than simply animating a walking corpse. The delivery system could be something like a snake's venom.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it the dog that bit Megu-nee?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>It was obviously intended.</br>  <br>No.</br>   replying to baiting shitposter   <br>Nope, she got bit fending the girls from a crowd of zombies.</br>    <br>I'm just wondering what Not-Umbrella Corp was up to when they released the virus. I'm genuinely curious as to the reason.</br>    <br>I get the feeling the author is going to change how Miki joined the group.</br>  Maybe it's just me but this show does feel kind of "real" in a way. If something that devestating happened I'm sure you'd have some students staying at their school trying to pretend that life hadn't gone to shit. I also love post-apocalyptic stories because they make me feel this sense of dread so that might be it.  <br>The more you hate him, the more your waifu will love him. Accept him for the cute emotional baggage that he will be and embrace the fluffy future depression.<br>Just look at him, imagine you were 2d, wouldn't you want to puni puni his little paws together with Shovel too?</br></br>  <br>There are a bunch of underground shelters, evacuation plans and suppressants distributed everywhere. It was something the government expected.</br>  <br>I hope not, the shopping trip was one of the best parts in the manga.</br>  <br> tfw can't enter these threads to talk about the first episode because manga fags don't know how the fuck to use spoilers </br>  <br>The same thing all corporations are up to, making money. How a virus that turns people into flesh eating monsters would of made them back I have no idea but if zombie movies have taught me anything, If the people in charge can protect themselves and the situation is only a small town or just one city, they'll pretend they did nothing wrong and try to cover it up somehow. Still, you'd think after six fucking games of zombie outbreaks and all the other shit they've done, The people at Umbrella would try a new business model.</br>  soo, where are they putting all the bodies? Considering they're stuck on only several floors of the school, it'd be hard not to have a serious rot problem. The Stand had a chapter or two on post-outbreak clean-up, so I'm wondering if the author will ever put forth specifics  <br>Dog will be dead within two episodes.</br>  Is this worth picking up for 3 ep rule?  <br><br>I don't think my school had supplies to last months.</br></br>  <br>  wouldn't you want to puni puni his little paws together with Shovel too? <br>Stop this anon, you're hurting me. I don't want to like this dog. ;_;</br></br>  <br>They know, they just don't give a fuck.</br>  <br><br>Throw them out the windows and let nature do the rest.</br></br>  Up to which chapter are raws available?  <br>The school had a store. I just wonder why did they not stay in the underground shelter if it had enough supplies for months.</br>  <br>Everyone was using them pretty well in the threads before horriblesubs was released, but then animeonlyfags shitposting exponentially increased and everyone just started throwing out Megu-nee bites Kurumi.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't mouse over every single surprise box regardless </br>  <br>My highschool did. Granted we had about 5k students there so we were 5 stories and 17 halls but we had a fully functional greenhouse and a huge court in the middle of the school that could be transformed into farming land. We also had a stock of food incase of a crisis (i.e 9/11, soviet invasion) or lockdown. Each room also had a crisis bag with medical supplies and a flare gun.<br><br> tfw you will never survive the zombie apocalypse with your high school buddies </br></br></br>  <br>There's only 35 jap raw and 37 Korean raw online.</br>  <br><br>Yuki has to attend class.</br></br>  This girl.  <br><br>Just read the manga man, 35 of the 37 chapters are translated, you could probably read them in 1-2 days depending on your reading speed and whether you let 4chan distract you.</br></br>  Piece of shit grimdark BS.<br><br>Wouldn't be surprised if it was written by that hack Urobuchi.<br><br>Holy fuck what a shitshow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this.<br>It ain't our problem.</br></br>  <br>I know a guy who read all of Berserk in a day</br>  <br>Tell that guy he's a fucking hero.</br>  <br><br>How many are still left untranslated or without raws then?<br>Or are 37 chapters all that's out so far?</br></br></br>  <br>There is line on how far can you pretend to be retarded.</br>  So I finally got round to watching the episode. Was pretty good except (and I'm sure this has already been posted several times) why was Miki there and why was the dog there? Are they going to veer off in their own direction or are they just compressing shit?  <br> rush through the manga to participate in the threads <br> miss details <br> only find out after reading the threads <br> pretend you knew all along and make fun of people who come to ask questions <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read all of Dragon Ball in a day. Is manga supposed to be long to read? I mean I've always been a fast reader but I don't understand how 35-37 chapters could take someone 1-2 days. That shit is like, 30-45 minutes tops.</br>  <br> already read the manga before the anime aired <br> mfw seeing yuki talking to all those "students" and megu-nee <br><br>Shit is very surreal as fuck... it's like watching tragedy while knowing what will happen and you can't do shit about it.<br><br> Also is Megu-nee still alive in this episode? IRC when they found the dog she was still alive... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>Volume 6 is out.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only 37 chapters so far.</br>  <br>Impossible, everyone posts the same 5 manga pages every single thread.</br>  <br>it's an american named company. and the japanese government had a whole network of safe houses set up in case of an outbreak. They made the virus cuz it's the standard bonkers u.s. military research program gone awry in anime.</br>  <br><br>I thought she only started pretending at around chapter 29. Before it seemed fairly genuine.</br></br>  <br>I read it in two, without sleeping. Tell that guy he's a fucking trooper.</br>  <br>She was pretending the whole thing.</br>  I was thinking on dropping this, until the anime dropped me.  <br><br>I didn't really get why Kurumi walked into a bunch of zombies at night until I read one of the threads, but I'm pretty dense.</br></br>  <br><br>There was no one there when she used the broom to kill the zombie. It's kind of weird pretending if she's all alone.</br></br>  <br> already read the manga before hand <br> wake up and remember it had aired <br> can't remember who was subbing it  <br> check CR real quick to see if they have it <br> one of their main pictures is the reveal the classroom is fucked up <br>Glad I wasn't spoiled for the manga version but I was genuinely waiting on the anime version of the reveal</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest i was confused about that till my 3rd time reading the manga.<br>Don't blame yourself.</br></br>  <br>it didn't look like anyone other than yuki was interacting with her, so I'd so no. sorry friend</br>  <br>Nope, if you look at the roof scene you can see Megu-nees grave.</br>  <br><br>How? I'm seeing this a lot with this manga. Like that guy who didn't understand what happened to the person at the radio station. I just don't understand.</br></br>  <br>she's been crazy the whole time, her crazy has just been getting more and more usefully attuned to the situation. she has been having more bouts of actual lucidity as the manga goes on</br>  <br> korean raw  <br> raw <br>This tickles my autism. It's still a scanlation even if it's in another scratchy written language no one can read.</br></br></br>  <br>actually these zombies at a little time of conciousnes where they will get back to the place they loved most.<br>They explained that for some reason , all zombie students went back to the school , even miki's friend (who died in a different place) <br><br>Or the dog that they trowh it away but managed to come back even when it was undead.<br>All animals are affected by the virus except pidgeons for some reason.<br><br>Sorry for my bad english</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck her while she's still warm</br>  <br>Retarded people are everywhere anon</br>  shoveldog the anime  I wish there was a zombie show where it's more of a black comedy affair like in High school of the dead with those two BFF's running from zombies only to die trying to sell the other one out, the loser who tried to go at a horde of zombies with a pocket knife thinking he was gonna go out like a badass and the teacher just flat out "Nope'd off the fucking building with nearly no change or second thought to his face as he went splat.  <br>I'm not quite sure how i didn't notice it.<br>I always thought she was going to look for stuff and until my third time reading through did i understand what miki was talking about.<br><br><br> she's been crazy the whole time <br>Even if she is deluded she wasn't crazy the whole time, some part of her knew what was happening. That part was Megu-nee.<br><br><br>Aha whoops, i just wrote raw cause i couldn't think of the word.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Kurumi say something?</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, there was the rooftop scene too. When we get there, Yuuri is up there by herself. But when Yuuri tells her to apologize to the rest of the gardening club, all of a sudden two generic students appear from nowhere. And they're waving stiffly and don't speak.<br><br>Of course, these things are easy to notice when you've already read the manga, but I wonder about those who haven't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She said that to yuki and "megu-nee" responded.</br>  <br> Yuuri tells Yuki* </br>  <br>at some point they find a map with 3 locations , these 3 are: the school , an university , an a mall.<br>The girls survived in the school , miki in the mall.<br>These 3 places are from a outside company they mentionen somewhere , and make me think they planned it all.<br>Still just theory, nothing confirmed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, what's wrong with these kids nowadays? School would have definitely been not the place I would have gone back to after turning.</br>  <br><br>Well, at first I thought the zombies didn't notice her because it was night.</br></br>  So the manga is going to have 3 "Acts," Right? The school was Act 1, that took about 30 chapters. So now we're at the university arc, Act 2. Wonder if it'll be another 30 chapters or if they'll be done with it quickly?  <br>I've never thought about that.<br>Maybe the final "act" will be in the shopping mall where the bunker is located.</br></br>  <br> anon clearly becomes infected during intercourse <br> message flashes across the screen. <br> "Don't be a nutter, <br> Wear a Rubber" <br>I'm surprised there haven't been any hip condom psa's involving zombies yet</br></br></br></br></br>  I really hope we get to see Miki before the rescue. The scene where she tried to act out her school schedule was one of my favorites.  <br><br>I figure the final arc would be at Randall Corp. Lab.</br></br>  <br> tan tan tata tan <br>I laugh at that every time, its adorable.</br></br>  <br>You mean the Randall Corporation building, not a mall.</br>  <br>What would they even do at the company? Assuming that it is the starting point of the outbreak and may or may not be fully infested by zombies? Or will the university be a dead end with none of the people in charge actually being there after all.</br>  <br> adorable <br>Were you that fucked up guy that finds suffering girls cute? Because that's depressing, not adorable.</br></br>  <br>When the part of you that knows what's going on is the talking apparition of a dead person, you're still crazy</br>  <br>Would you still do it if she got a bit cold?</br>  <br>No, i just find the little dance cute.</br>  <br>Depressing. Just imagine the strain of trying to do your everyday chores that are meant to be done in a group with a teacher, then having rest of the day doing nothing but staring at the wall.</br>  I WISH <br>THAT I COULD TURN BACK TIME<br>BECAUSE NOW THE GUILT IS ALL MINE</br></br>  <br>Gakko ga suki da!</br>  Mii-kun best boy  <br>I'm making it your problem, asshole.</br>  I was genuinely expecting another SoL anime with 4 cute girls.<br>Call me a filthy secondary, but they really got me good with this episode.</br>  <br>Oh shit, not a report.<br>What if i get banned? I'll have to walk all the way to my router and reset it. Anything but that anon!</br></br>  <br> announcing that you avoid bans </br>  <br>I'm actually not that anon, just saying that reports mean shit.</br>   Kurumi gets bitten by Megu-nee. <br> There are antidotes in the basement. <br> The helicopter crashes. <br> Rii-san crazy levels increases. <br> Yuki crazy levels drops down. <br> Radio-chan turns into zombies. <br> The loli is a bear. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not that guy either, and expecting someone to get b&amp; for spoiling is silly, but ban evasion is definitely bannable.</br>  <br>Good summary anon.</br>  <br>Thanks, Anon. You've saved me countless hours.</br>  <br>That's why Key left  and died  and why is important the school activities like festivals.</br>    <br>We don't know she died. She probably just went to the arcade to have some fun.</br>  <br>True.<br><br>Good think happens when you are alive anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Miki saw her zombled when they left the school as far i remember.<br><br><br>Nice.</br></br></br></br>  Just read all there was of the manga and  Kurumi a cute! A CUTE!   So, who was it?  <br>Here lies Shovel's chances of survival.</br>  <br>Indeed she is anon.<br>  But she's mine  <br><br><br>Obviously Megu-nee</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "I'm a casualty?!" </br>  <br>I thought megu-nee was the one in the barricaded hallway.</br>  <br>A  liar  teacher that deserved to die.</br>  <br>squidward hopes and dreams<br><br>i hope</br></br></br>  <br>She thought it looked like her, but then said it was nothing.</br>  <br>No, there's a scene in the manga were Miki prays to that grave and thanks Megu-nee.<br><br>As far as i remember anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, heh.<br>Yeah, I'm a total secondary, have to admit.</br></br>  <br>Just like Kurumi said "it's nothing" when they drove by her home.<br><br>We don't really know if it's Kei, and it's not really important. Mii-kun herself isn't sure about it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Actaully!  Her zombified corpse is walking around a bunker in the school they find later and she bites shovel. </br></br>  <br>See global rule 7, and fuck off back to wherever you came from.</br>  <br>The characters look like the character designer is Fatal Pulse. The distinct puffy cheek.</br>  <br>Thats her body, the grave on the roof was made for Megu-nee.<br><br>That's what upsets Rii when they found her body.</br></br></br>  <br> implying I broke that rule <br>How is what I did different than what you're doing now?</br></br>   tfw shovel is going to die first   The more I rewatch this episode, the worse I feel for the girls.  <br>You announced a report by saying "I'm making it."<br><br>Why are you misusing the quote function?</br></br></br>  <br>Decomposition or not, walking around all day with gaping wounds is only going to aggravate those wounds until so much damage has accumulated that the body cannot mechanically function. A quadriplegic zombie can't do shit.</br>  Holy fuck, this episode really had me going there. Then the grave was shown, and I was really confused. When the end happened, I felt like I was watching something beautiful like a child birth only for it to to be stabbed to death by the doctor.<br><br>Anyways, great episode, but I'm confused as to how this can be continued without it getting old. I mean the twist is revealed at the very beginning, so will there be surprises? Otherwise, I felt like this would have worked better as a short movie with basically the episodes format, but maybe like 10 minutes longer. <br><br> Also did you notice the chalkboard at around 9:20? I missed that shit when i watched it.<br> "I enjoyed studying with everyone.<br>Let's together again.<br>But it does not come true at all.''<br><br>''All is in darkness in the past.<br>Please don't throw me away.<br>Help me.''</br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you mean Kurumi  a dead! A DEAD! </br>  <br>I didn't announce a report. You may want to get some reading comprehension, m8. <br>Or maybe not be an asspulling faggot who puts a period in the middle of a sentence pretending that's the end of the quote.</br></br>  <br>It remains slice of life, however weird that may sound. No edgy slasher gore, only hopelessness, despair and clinging onto the last straws of sanity.</br>  A lot of you could argue the first 20 minutes were pointless shit to further emphasize the shock factor of the big reveal, but if you re-watch it there's a shit ton of foreshadowin,g and I don't just mean the broken glass or chalkboard writing. Like Miki always barging in class and making Yuki 'remind' her that others are there, those commenting that Yuki is too happy, etc.<br>It was all pretty damn well done, better than in the manga in my opinion.<br><br>But seriously, FUCK Taroumaru, fucking annoying as shit spending 10 minutes just chasing him.</br></br></br>  <br> But seriously, FUCK Taroumaru, fucking annoying as shit <br>Mah nigga.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Looking forward to that  zombie Taroumaru scene </br></br></br>  <br><br>They would be dead without her. She's the only one that regularly wields a weapon.</br></br>  <br>You really love her, don't you?</br>  <br> The loli is a bear. <br>I knew it!</br></br>  <br>She's been my waifu for about a year an a half, so yeah.</br>  <br>Not as much as me.</br>  <br>Yeah, everyone missed it when a screenshot of that blackboard was the thread's OP image.</br>  <br>A lot of people complain that the twist is useless because it's not an original anime, but it's really done well. Even if you know how it'll end, the foreshadowing and the small hints are really interesting. <br><br>When they finally revealed it, it felt really "satisfying" -- if you know what I mean. <br><br><br>I don't see anyone else dying, to be honest. She still has one more of those syringes and I'm sure they'll find more in the university. <br><br> Megu nee already filled the death quota </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oi, you're #2 keep you mouth shut.</br>  <br>I hope you made a good insurance.</br>  Reminder that shovelfags are degenerated necrophiliacs.  <br>How shit are you going to feel once she turns into a zombie?</br>  <br><br><br>Why would you do that anon. ;_;<br><br>You don't understand the pain of knowing your waifu is 100% a goner.<br><br>And knowing that fact for over a year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember the feelings you felt when  happened? Something like that, but much worse.</br>  <br>Go ahead and explain what you meant, then. What action are you taking to use the rule you highlighted to make it his problem?

It's pretty heartbreaking.</br></br></br>  <br>That is adorable.</br>  <br>Little known fact: Teuchi's ramen shop was actually built and running before Konohagakure was created.

What does he tell himself then?</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Like, he's seen dozens, if not hundreds, of shinobi be like "Hey, seeya Teuchi.

Not new material, just put together in a more readable fashion.<br>http://imgur.com/a/OEiUk<br><br>I'll translate Nanashi's comiket work whenever it comes out.</br></br></br>  <br>  FoszeMI[1].jpg <br><br><br>Fuck off back to reddit, Narutard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> knows this means Reddit <br> thinks he gets a pass for this and others don't </br></br>  <br>So wait who did this one? This wasn't Nanashi as well, was it?</br>  <br>Yep. That's the third of his works involving Naruto and Hinata getting comfortable being naked around each other.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/ and stay there.</br>  Best fight to me was Itachi and Fishhead vs Azuma, Kakashi, and Kurenai.<br><br>They'll never capture the power level moment like they did back then when we had limited knowledge of what was going to happen.</br></br>  <br>Ah, I think I saw ooooooone other.

They fail.</br>  <br>Boruto confirmed for worst character of his own fucking movie</br>  I am 100% sure that Studio Pierrot will fuck this shit up to hell and back.

How the fuck do those have 'new material' for discussion?</br>  <br>The thing that most shitposters don't get is that when they fuck up a Naruto thread, it forces the people who just want to casually talk about it to make a new one, leading to two Naruto threads. They then jump ship to the new thread, the same thing happens, leading to a THIRD Naruto thread.<br><br>If they left the Naruto threads alone, the people who enjoy Naruto would stay safely confined to their threads. People who don't like it pretty much just has to filter 'Naruto', 'Boruto', 'Gaiden' and 'Salad' and they'll never see another Naruto thread again.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it doesn't.

It's not the best thing by any means but it's watchable enough that it shouldn't really bother you. I realize there were a few episodes, especially episode 6 that was really badly animated but that all got fixed in the BDs so you have no excuse to say that anymore. We all can't be like Unlimited Budget Euphonium Works</br>  <br>No one cares that this attracts fujoshi's interest, besides the occasional shitposter.
