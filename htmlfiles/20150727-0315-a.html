[  No Overlord thread <br>Shame on you, /a/!</br>  <br> discussing the latest vrmmo multi media project </br>  <br> Overlord <br> VRMMO <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Overlord does not need to have thread everyday</br>  <br>We don't have to have a thread up 24/7 when there's nothing new to talk about.</br>  Just finished vol 4 , shits went better than I expected  Sebas dun goofed. Now to wait a week to see how papa bones bails him out.  <br>By burning the 8 fingers down, you don't try to extort Nazarick and get away with it.</br>  <br>Hopefully the 2 goons join Demi's kebab chimera farm. Getting fast way out by Sebas' hand is too good for them.</br>  Looking forward to Mare's rape train and Entoma encounter. Literally everyone in this arc is my favourite characters.  <br> volume 9 TL will never finish this year </br>   tfw you will never be a part of Papa Bones army   <br> Get double release on Saturday <br> Vol 5 ends as Sebas is about to lay the smackdown on 8 candy fingered asses aka cliff hanger <br> Vol 7 ends while mentioning hot shots but stops right before The Darkness shows up <br><br>I'm not sure whether to feel impatient, or savoring how fun next week looks.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it Tuesday yet?<br>Is it Saturday yet?</br>  <br>Check the bottom right corner of your screen.</br>  <br>??</br>  <br>Post that ni shibullath thingie one, I want to see it again.</br>  <br>Alternatively, you can check the day in the top line of every post.</br>      <br>Well its not particularly good and there's nothing new to discuss.</br>  <br>He should quit his overlording career and become a model.</br>  <br>Shalltear should have Papa Bones child.</br>  Best girl.  Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit.  <br> Papa Bones <br> hero <br><br>I wish<br><br><br>Poor Arche ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does he have a conception spell?</br>  <br>I don't know m8, killing enemies in battlefield is pretty normal, regardless whether the method is edgy or not.</br>   Think the lizard romance last volume was cute as fuck. <br> Sebas completely blows that away this chapter. <br>Damn Sebas, why you gotta be so suave, let the lizards have something.</br></br>  Will we get to see the papa bones vs shalltear fight animated?  Been out of the loop. Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  <br>There no information about her so we can't be sure she's a low level NPC like here sisters.</br>  <br><br>The Tundra must be fucking awful if you don't have frost resistance.</br></br>  <br>We can because in the early volumes like vol 1 or 2 it's said other than Sebas the rest of the maids were below a certain level. The second point is the poster of the level 100 npcs, of which there are 9 including the miko.</br>  <br>Not to mention you have to jump into a lake to get to it</br>  <br>I was bored.</br>  <br>Ok, then she must have some special shit like Victim to stay in the 8th floor.<br>Damn, the more we talk the less chance I see PDL could be a threat to Nazarick.</br></br>  <br>This works quite well</br>  <br> fighting cocytus <br>oh god all of them swords<br>I bet his cleave must have been a bitch<br> fighting demiurge in the molten realm <br>I can only imagine him mind controlling people into lava pits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting that PDL's main skill is subterfuge and trickery and that Ainz is shit at that. Demiurge will probably have to step up his game in order to prevent PDL empowering Penguin to enslave pandora's actors and stealing all the world items and class changing Ainz to a toad or some shit.</br>  <br> Ourobouros is in the new world and is probably the most game breaking in terms of long term <br> World Savior can one shot all of Nazarick <br> Nameless Spellbook allows PDL to know all of Nazarick's spells <br> Potential players that hate AOG <br><br>PDL himself was never a big deal, it's how he goes Hitogami on Ainz's ass that's the set up. <br><br>Plus, the author stated Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 70% of her faces show nothing but anger. <br><br>Come on Narb, those humans aren't that bad, calm down.</br></br></br>   “And those glasses… didn’t they seem incredibly expensive?” <br><br> “Could it be a magic item?” <br><br> “No, isn’t it just a luxury item? Maybe a dwarf made it.” <br><br>Fucking dwarves, man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's something briefly touched on in vol 7. It didn't go into specifics though.</br>  <br>CD is a chump though. As cute as she is.</br>  <br>Except for the Nameless Spellbook, does PDL even has the others 2 ?</br>  He looks pretty fucking good.  <br> All these pests around me, I want to squash them all. </br>  <br>Who is Certain Death ?</br>  <br>I still don't know what fucking race he is</br>  <br>Orobourus has already been used, its not coming back.<br><br>World Savior should still be in the hands of the goblins because no one is out powering them.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolielf that we see hanging around with the Black Scripture guy, so she's Sloan Theocracies bitch. Apparently part of the Black Scripture but not the leader.</br>  <br> it turns out that one of the goblins under Erin has it and she decides to not use it against Ainz because he saved the village <br>That would be a nice tweest.<br> she doesn't know that Ainz could have revived her parents </br></br></br>  <br>Garuda maybe?</br>  <br>There's noting stating a WC item that was used up in the new world returns to Yggdrasil instead of coming back to the new world.<br><br>In fact, assuming Martial Arts was introduced through Orobourus then that's twice it's been used since translation konjac is clearly one use.<br><br>World Savior was already used by the goblin king so it shouldn't be with the goblins since it's a twenty, so even if it's in the new world it's somewhere random. It'd be super dumb luck for goblins to find it twice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The winged god of Ra</br>  <br>confirmed high crit rate</br>  <br>She's beautiful.</br>  <br>What is Ouroboros's power ?<br>Is it alter-reality or some shit like that &gt;</br></br>  <br>Yep. It's the broken shit where you call the admin team and ask them to do something. By far the most potential over the long term if we're talking about items we know about.<br><br>And we know from how Wish Upon a Star changed that Ouroboros would be even more godly in the new world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was a post about who was stronger between rubedo and touch me like 2 threads ago. Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz.</br></br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me <br><br>Missed it, source on the author word of god link.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't ouroboros one use though? I think the LN mentioned it being used in order to help that guild steal Ainz's secret jew gold mine. I remember that Ainz has at least two one-shot World items, but I don't know what you're implying with Wish Upon A Star.</br>  <br>How did Wish Upon a Star get changed in the nw?</br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz. <br>As in, it's a direct comparison? Rubedo is stronger because her skills have good compatibility with Touch Me as an opponent?</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128551<wbr>803/#q128565734</wbr></br>  <br>There nothing stating that orobouros was used for those two things. Another option is that orobouros isn't even in the new world. <br><br>I'm just believing in the fact that the twenty really are just one use items, that does not respawn. So the guild that used it on the mines was the only time.</br></br></br>  <br>One use means it disappears and comes back in the world of Yggdrasil as far as the game goes.<br><br>However, since the item transferred to the new world, chances are after it's used it comes back to the new world. Not proven fact but the way the novels keep hinting at shit and Ainz's paranoia at WC items it'd be more of a buzz kill if it doesn't work this way.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but author just said she's stronger than Touch Me.<br>There's no comparison mention.</br></br>  <br>nah the twenty and one-use world items aren't the same thing<br><br> Answer: The amount of EXP needed from Wish upon a star is dependent on the type of wish granted. In Yggdrasil a player who cast Wish upon a star would be granted 3 random choices from a pool of choices; However, In the New world the spell is a lot more Omnipotent. But basically the larger and stronger the wish, the more EXP given to complete it <br>https://forums.animesuki.com/showth<wbr>read.php?p=5599818<br><br><br>I don't know where you got that idea about the one use items but I'll assume you're right</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Martial Arts is 50/50 but Translation Konjac is clearly hinted.<br><br>Every fucking species in the world right down to the very last descendent's ancestor somehow managed to eat a konjac? You telling me someone went Santa Claus and spread some language jelly during Christmas for a few years in a row and even went in the sea cause sea races can't be bothered to surface?<br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the game it gets one of three random wishes to choose from every use.<br>In the new world if you can think it, it will grant it (unless it's going up against a WC item)</br></br>  <br>so what you're saying is<br> Herohero was summoned to spread jelly to the mouth of every being on the planet. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok<br>So Ouroboros can works on even a larger scale than that ? That's some OP shit.</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but I'm pretty sure he's still busy trying to free Veldora out from the prison. Maybe it was Simmering Teapot instead. She's an eroge voice actor surely making her the best candidate to go Ho Ho Ho.</br>  <br> twenty and one use items not.the same thing <br> These items called the ‘Twenty’ were so powerful that they could only be used once before disappearing. <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was Teapot's race?</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  There are our twenties that can change the world. We're both arguing about something that may or may not have happened.  <br><br>No wonder he was away from Yggdrasil for so long then showed up overworked. He was making Christmas runs the whole time behind Momonga's back!

Seeing them laugh like that together was really cute</br></br>  <br>it's perdy gud</br>  <br>That episode, man<br>Damn, that guitar, man<br>I fucking love that episode, the best one-episode of the series. Why Gin is so based? Why Kagura is not real?</br></br></br>  <br> small-dicked <br>I don't think so</br></br>  <br>Such a great episode.</br>  Hnngg  <br> small dick <br><br>It's cannon to be basically a third leg.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Gin fucked Madao when he was drunk and it seems he was a top. So Gin could definitely be bisexual or something.<br><br>Hijikata has been bullied by Sougo so often that he's pretty much bottom material whether he wants to or not.<br><br>The math just checks out.<br><br>Harada. I'm not sure how much I like her shipping of Gin and Hijikata but she's got the general dynamic between them down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there actually people who still don't know the core audience watching and financing Gintama?<br><br> Fujoshit stronk </br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah. One chapter where they finally get along is the reason to ship. Yeah nah.</br>  <br>But when you go to /a/ you don't expect to find a thread of fujoshits. There are no women on the internet, silly!</br>  Why did Gin stop drinking strawberry milk? It's been so long since I've seen him with any.  <br>Because he was drunk. That's your damn keyword. And he's repulsed by it when he finds out, so no.</br>  <br>It's no secret around here that Gintama panders to fujo, the show it's self jokes about it occasionally.</br>  <br>Gorilla doesn't actually tease the fujoshits that often. This and the Soul Switch arc are the most he's done. There's also the Scandal arc for those who ship him with Madao, but I don't see there being many.<br><br>And before you ask, the episode with the two chained together is anime filler.</br></br></br>   healthy grown up Kagura in the movie   <br> One chapter <br>You wot m8, Gintama is pretty gay</br></br>  <br>The fake yaoi dvd covers are anime filler</br>  <br>Never said it was. I just realized that the 'two rivals secretly wanting to fuck each other' thing is pretty hot. Like with Sougo/Kagura</br>  <br>blame Abenomics</br>  <br>Surprisingly not as gay as fujoshits think though.<br><br>And I was referring to the fact that they finally had a chapter acting as friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Then come up with a different suggestion. Who is going to be?<br><br>Otae... oops, she's taken.<br>Sa-chan... oops, she's a comic relief BDSM slut.<br>Tsukuyo... maybe, she's got a chance.<br><br>The way things are now he either ends up with Tsukuyo, Hijikata (to appease the fujo horde?), Madao or no one at all.<br><br>He's got a pretty great dynamic with Hijikata and Tsukuyo so I don't mind considering Hijikata an option for now although it'll probably never ever happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's that got to do with the post you replied to, we all know it panders sometimes but that's got nothing to do with the fanbase on /a/</br>  <br>And the episode where they're handcuffed together as well</br>  <br>How many older men do you fuck on average when you're drunk?</br>  <br>I'm talking about the polls and the doujin covers they show in some of the comedy episodes.<br><br>You have to admit, at this point the main audience is women and mostly fujo going beyond that. It doesn't bother me I still quite enjoy the show, but the fact remains.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop with the<br> ... <br>already</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure fujos realize it isn't actually gay</br>  What does aru mean  <br>Hijikata is not seriously in the running, unlike Tsukuyo, Tae, and Sacchan, by the sheer fact this is a shonen manga, and there's never been anything romantic implied.<br><br>Tsukuyo is in love with him, Sacchan is as well (but doesn't stand a chance), while Tae sometimes seems to have feelings for him then suddenly doesn't (plus she's now getting teased with Kondo).<br><br>Don't take development in their friendship as romantic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not her newest picture.</br>  Well this thread sure did an interesting 180°. From Kagura to Gin buttfucking Hijikata.  <br>You'd be surprised by all the "omg ginhiji canon" cries after this chapter. Fucking annoying.</br>  <br>From 13 year old tumblr grils then I guess? Somehow I really doubt the jap fujos would believe that for real</br>  <br>None. But drunk people do stupid and weird stuff they don't normally do, and Gintama exaggerates anything.<br><br>It was a punchline to add to Gintoki's horror, who is disgusted with himself for it. I think we can take it as Gintoki not being bisexual.</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Kugyuu. The stress, age, and fatigue really show.</br>  <br>Jesus, how old is she?</br>  <br>Part getting older, part harsh lighting</br>  <br>Even if he actually was bi I'm pretty sure he'd still be disgusted at the thought of fucking Hasegawa</br>  <br> Hijikata on the list <br> Not Tae <br>I know she's not worth much, but come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh-huh, or something like that. She said it makes her seem cute.</br>  <br>she's the manliest of all of them</br>  <br>This.

That should be proof enough that Gin accepts the possibility of him fucking Madao which doesn't sound very straight at all. He doesn't even object to it on the grounds of him being straight.<br><br>Punchline was indeed him being disgusted but once again, he believes Madao.<br><br>Would a 100% straight guy so readily believe he fucked an older man?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because not only do they fit well together, they get great ship tease.</br>  <br>36.</br>  <br>Yeah this. He also wouldn't want to risk upsetting his fujo audience</br>  <br>Every time</br>  <br>He already thought he'd fucked 5 women he knew. He was already at a low point and willing to believe anything.</br>  <br>And here I thought asian aged well</br>  <br>I don't think it'll be because he doesn't want to upset his audience, but simply because he doesn't want him to pair up with anybody at the end.</br>  <br>Her beard would only fuel the fujoishi. In fact anything that is not the definition of female would inspire them to make even more Gin x Hijikata djs.</br>  <br> "Did I fuck 5 women yesterday? That means I probably fucked a man too!" <br><br>How gay do you have to be to even think that logic is solid?</br></br></br>  <br>...I meant that he was willing to believe anything at that point, simply because of how out there it was for him to fuck OTOSE in the first place.</br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>  <br>Fuck this, I'll drop it and stand by my point that the circumstances doesn't work to prove that Gintoki is bisexual.</br>  <br>What the fuck happened, any chance we can move the thread in a better direction?<br><br>Like towards best girl?</br></br></br>  <br> Expect something nice from Gintama <br> Be disappointed by the outcome <br>It's like the real deal.  GinxMadao OTP </br></br></br>    <br>I've always wondered, is it just one or two vocal Tsukuyofags, or do people here actually like her?</br>  <br>He doesn't give a fuck pissing off about fujos. Otherwise, he wouldn't made the Love Potion arc.</br>  <br> But what doujin was it? This? http://g.e-hentai.org/g/809420/9d3b<wbr>987f79/</wbr> </br>  <br> not wanting the magical fujobucks <br>Making one panderish arc is a different thing from ending the manga with Gintoki marrying Tsukuyo and having five children. The latter would completely kill the appeal of the series for fujos.</br></br>  <br>Well the series would be ended at that point anyway. I'm told that while the fujoshi are consistently interested in Gintama, they're far from the only ones keeping it afloat, and many of them aren't as interested as they used to be. It's not a new series after all.</br>  <br>Judging by the polls I've seen before, it does seem to me that people here like her a lot. What, you don't?</br>  Why doesn't anyone listen to Daiz and his nameing sheme?<br>Why don't scanlator upload the chapters as pdf instead of zip/rar?<br>Why are /ak/-scans so fucking shit?<br>Why can't we purge jaimini's box and fallen angels?<br>Why do more than one group work on Tomo-chan wa Onna no ko!?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I clean It my way? cause I didnt like that action.</br>  <br> listening to daiz <br> pdf <br>stopped reading there because you're beyond retarded.</br></br></br>  Did photoshop ever implement non-destructive canvas rotation? That would help for redraws.<br><br><br>The little trash bins icons are an indicator, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, if someone does i at allt, I would appreciate it. The script was done by another anon as "help" to motivate people to try it out. You can just use the raws and the TL if you want to.</br>  <br> non-destructive canvas rotation <br>Those exists?</br></br>  who is the most edgy character in anime  <br>Illuminati</br>    Kiritsugu by far.  <br>Seconding this. It's like he has a brain tumor and can only think of the edgiest solution possible.</br>    <br> Episode 1 <br>Literally says the line "Kotomine Kirei frightens me." A main character who is scared of his rival, wow so edgy. I've never seen anything edgier than a scared guy. All he does in the episode is talk about Kirei and summon Saber.<br> <br> Episode 2 <br>Shown playing with his kid and calls her his princess. All he does in the episode is make her a promise.<br> <br> Episode 3 <br>Iri tells Saber that Kiritsugu showed her the outside world. Kiritsugu has a scene with Maiya. And even though he's showing off his weapons he still gets emotional by the mere thoughts of his daughter. Wow, how edgy. He's concerned about his kid. Nothing edgier than that.<br> <br> Episode 4-5 <br>Was going to kill Lancer's master. (Put himself in a perfect position and gives orders to Maiya. Wow, a protag using tactics instead of just spouting the word justice and getting saved by everyone around him. Wow.) Doesn't really succeed. A main character who fails, how edgy.<br> <br> Episode 6 <br>Again trying to kill Lancer's master and failing. Pretended to be Kayneth, set up explosives and gives orders to Maiya. (A protagonist using tactics instead of just blushing about girls and recklessly charging into combat, great. A character that uses his brain, how edgy.<br> <br> Episode 7 <br>Kiritsugu tells Iri and the others about his plan. Literally had a city map and was asking if anyone questioned him. A protagonist that makes plans instead of just talking about justice over and over again and blushing about girls.<br> <br>Then he talks with his wife about how he's scared of Kirei and how he's already sacrificing her and Ilya. HE LITERALLY WANTED TO RUN AWAY from the Holy Grail War. Wow, a scared guy. How edgy. His wife was the one that had to talk some sense into him.<br> <br> Episode 8 <br>He fights Lancer's master. He's fighting a guy that's trying to kill him. He's fighting in a war, I guess this is edgy somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boku wa... </br>  <br> Episode 9-13 <br>These episodes flesh out other characters.<br> <br> Episode 14 <br>Shoots a child murderer. He killed a child murderer so he's edgy.<br> <br> Episode 15 <br>Cooperates with others to take down an enemy. How edgy.<br> <br> Episode 16 <br>Eliminates the Lancer team. He eliminated someone in the grail war, so I guess he's edgy.<br> <br> Episode 17 <br>Kirei kills Rin's father. I guess this means Kiritsugu is edgy somehow.<br> <br> Episode 18 <br>Kiritsugu backstory. Showed how scared and weak he was. So edgy.<br> <br> Episode 19 <br>Kiritsugu backstory. More tragedy, but Kerry learned from his mistake. Episode ends with him sobbing loudly because he just killed his mother. This is clearly edgy. Nothing is edgier than a man crying.<br> <br> Episode 20 <br>Kiritsugu concerned for Maiya/Iri orders Saber to defend them. This is obviously edgy.<br> <br>And HE CRIES AGAIN. All Kiritsugu does is cry. So edgy.<br> <br> Episode 21 <br>Kirei and Gilgamesh drink whine while watching a woman get choked to death. Clearly, this means Kiritsugu is edgy.<br> <br> Episode 22 <br>Kiritsugu is trying to come up with plans and Saber apologizes to him. Irisviel says "he can't help but love others despite knowing he'll lose them."<br> <br>Kirei chokes Iri, which means Kiritsugu is edgy.<br> <br> Episode 23-24 <br>Kerry fights Kirei. Grail tests him, and he chooses the greater good over everything. Even his family.<br> <br> Episode 25 <br>He saves Shirou and adopts him.<br> <br> <br>In conclusion, Kiritsugu is an edgy character. He saved people and died. Yeah, that's the edgiest thing ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>People tend to use "edgy" completely incorrectly, and as a way to write off any story that has dark elements to it so they don't have to feel bad about not fully understanding the "why's" of a story.<br><br>Granted, when something happens for no other reason than for the sake of a suffering/gore-porn quota being met, so that a relatively simple or uninteresting story is seen by the duller crowd as grim or deep, then that's when you'd call something "try-hard". As there is no formal definition, it fits a bit better, and the informal definitions tend to fit.<br><br>"try-hard<br>A person who puts a large amount of effort into achieving a certain image, or counter-image, to the point where it is obviously contrived. Rather than achieving an image through genuine personality, the try-hard consciously attempts to fit a certain style through deliberate imitation, forced style, or scripted behavior. That is to say, he/she is trying hard to create an image. "</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What a sperglord. Typical fate idiots though.</br></br>  <br><br>His origins are 'severing' and 'binding' so the driving force of his existence is literally to destroy things and then ruin them by trying to fix them.<br><br>He's edgy because he's incapable of solving a problem without ending up making things worse for everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trying to fix things but having them break outside of your own control is edgy. <br><br>Try again.</br></br></br>  <br>Popular != edgy</br>  <br><br>Pretty impressed you managed to write all of this over a character being called edgy, but regardless of his actions and if they're related to war or a good cause he's edgy.<br>Look at Dante from DMC and Sasuke Uchiha, both push for the greater good but are called edgelords because regardless their methods for obtaining the goal are Crawling in my skin.</br></br></br>  <br>Your origin is your true self and the driving force of your soul. He was born the personification of 'severing' and 'binding'. That's who he is and that is exactly the opposite of it being out of his control. <br><br>Kiritsugu exists to destroy things and then try to fix the situation shoddily. That's Kiritsugu.</br></br></br>  <br> my despair will eat your darkness! <br>Yeah, Sasugay wins hands down.</br></br>  Every character in Wolf Guy  <br>Was the slut teacher really edgy though?</br>  <br>Is that the one where the teacher gets raped for like 30 chapters? Too many similar titles.</br>  <br>Except it is out of his control, everyone who is close to him dies sometimes from him trying to fix a situation, other times just because. Norikata and Natalia died as a result of him destroying and then fixing. Maiya, Irisviel, and by extension Illyasviel all died simply because the world hates Kiritsugu.<br><br><br>Dante and Sasuke don't push for the greater good, I don't know what you're talking about. Dante hunts demons because its his job and "why the fuck not" and is generally happy go lucky. Sasuke is obsessed with revenge and a moody son of a bitch, he's also a protagonist gone antagonist so you have that.</br></br></br></br>  A true edgelord.    <br>It's not how terrible this character is. Is the self-insertion of the fans.</br>  <br/>  <br>And you fucking know it.</br>  <br>I love his fucking posture though and design in general throughout both Shippuden and non-shippuden, a shame his dialogue and writing as a character and motivations made no sense.<br><br>Still the only character in Fate universe that isn't a complete dumbass chinese battle shounen porn slideshow protagonist  like Shirou  <br><br><br><br><br>This.<br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But he's Dracula. Dracula was always edgy. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=onb<wbr>iOVpX0_w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a big guy</br>  I MUST KILL ALL THE VAMPIRES  I was wondering what's peoples opinions on Gangsta so far?  You first fag.  Would be good if Daiz actually started subbing it again.  <br>Okay. I liked it, not bad story so far. Very thoughtful characters. It seems edgy at times with all the twilights around but other than that, 7/10 from me.</br>  <br>Okay, now me. Haven't watched it.</br>  <br>Just go with Funi</br>  Animation and choreography could've been better , at one point he pulls off some completely unnecessary but also very retarded looking moves (think it was in the first episode, he just does a sort of low height jump and mid-air roll and lands exactly where he was before just to slash the guy)<br><br>Also muh superhuman test subjects is pretty silly, but otherwise the story hasn't been unbearable and if anything it's worth watching for the novelty alone.(Whore main characters, etc.)<br><br>As this guy put it <br>7/10 is a fitting score.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Definition of 7/10. <br>The characters are interesting enough, there's an intriguing backstory that hasn't fully developed, the action is fine and it's short enough to stay entertaining.</br></br></br>  It's in the ''so bad it's good" category.  It needs an anime original ending.  Average. <br><br>The relatively novel setting is nice, but it's lacklustre.</br></br>  It's pretty  gangsta   Its starting to get good<br>Last episode was the best one</br>  <br>Hell no. Anime original ending is only a great way to ruin the series completely.<br><br>As for the anime, it's pretty okay, there are some silly moments, but I'm enjoying it so far.</br></br></br>  I'm really liking it.<br>I think it's very interesting that one of the main characters is deaf.<br>Communicating by sign language and barely being able to talk, while talking to himself normally was a very good touch.<br>Nico is a pretty likable character, in my opinion.</br></br></br>  Ep.4 and still haven't dropped.<br><br>That means I like it better than 90% of the shit I start.<br><br>Alex-chan a cute, hope nothing bad happens to her</br></br></br></br>  <br>5/10, terrible choreography and "emotional" animation. If you cant animate feeling, you have failed as an animator. Mind you some parts are good, some.</br>  <br>fujoshit</br>  <br>Its a bit slow but entertaining. hopefully something articulated will actually happen before last episode</br>  <br>Yeah they invested everything in characters and not much in a plot.</br>  Characters seem good enough, but it kinda lacks that hook that makes you want to keep watching  <br><br>Since when does being deaf mean you have fucked up control over your eyelids?</br></br>  <br>Opening is good<br>Show isnt</br></br>  <br>But Funi so incredibly bad.</br>  I'm not sure about the whole super soldier business, but I like the main characters a lot, especially Nico. Time will tell if my interest in the characters carries me through to the end. <br>Predicting a 6 or 7/10, entertaining but nothing to rave about to recommend to a friend.</br>  <br>A deaf fighter surely would have been ambushed and killed by now. Other than it it's boring if you wanna watch a real gangster anime watch GunGrave or Black Lagoon.</br>  I really liked the first 2 eps for the action, atmosphere, and music. <br><br>I didn't like the last 2 eps very much since they took it in an entirely different direction. There was an unnecessarily large amount of time spent on backstory, especially in a 12 episode anime. The girl turns from a whore who shot her pimp into a bland character who asks questions about everything to get the audience up to speed. <br><br>Also I don't like the introduction of more super soldiers doing super acrobatics. I could suspend my disbelief with Nicolas's acrobatic swordplay, but I can't keep it up anymore when there's a kid with machetes jumping over rooftops avoiding every bullet the mafia boss's closest men shoots. Not to mention the gang leader is a sharpshooter who can't land a hit on a kid running around in an enclosed alleyway.<br><br>Another point is that so far we've only seen a single setting: a generic alleyway. There's hints to a larger bustling city, but we never see it. Instead we see the same alleyway with a corner or two to mix it up.<br><br>Started out as a 9/10, but now it's a 7/10. I hope it gets better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like it so far. Not awesome but it's solid entertaining.<br>The op is pretty nice, i like the chardesigns and so far no char is as dumb as a potato. Thats nice for a change i guess.<br><br>The Story reminds me of Dark Angel, and i don't know how to feel about that.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Pretty lackluster adaptation. Sure, is more or less faithful to the manga, but the animation is cheap and boring. Fighting scenes are yawn inducing and just lack that exciting spark. I guess is 5/10. Not dropping because of Nina and Nick.</br>  The show is the definition of a 5/10. It lacks any discernible identity of its own in anything it does, even down to its terrible choreography. Let's see if it's flying, or floating at the end, though.  atleast its not highschool/10<br><br>while it started pretty nice and certainly is good and nothing major. 6/10 nice watch, nice style but still waiting for that big stuff to happen.<br>too bad the hentai of it is shit aswell. instead of brown hotness or cute nursegirl we get Worick fucking nico all day. fucking fujoshits ruin it</br></br></br>  <br> its shit because the males have more screentime </br>  Honestly didn't like the anime adaptation at first, but it made me re-read the manga and eventually catch up with the anime. Still neither here or there with the anime, but love the manga, so I have hope. 7/10 so far. <br> No clue what they're going to cover in 12 episodes though, a lot goes on... Sad they've cut out some of the smaller, cuter moments </br>  <br>i was talking about the fanart, especially the hentai you dibshit. Have you checked pixiev on it? <br>http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_m<wbr>ode=s_tag&amp;word=gangsta<br><br>Go to R-18 and feast your eyes on dispear. <br><br>I like the 2 male leads and they certainly carry the show, its good they get the most screentime. the show is mostly about fighting and the girls dont fight there its obvios the anime isnt focusing on them.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Everything's cool, but I'm not liking the 'THESE GUYS ARE SUPERMEN' shit  <br> Guy jumps around crushing roof tile in the OP <br> He kicks a police car so hard it nearly tips over <br> Oh shit this guy is [special man from special group] <br><br>What else were you expecting?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was expecting no superpower shit.<br>Though roof tiles are pretty fragile and that's a bad example.</br></br>  Was it drool?  I am gonna let you mull that one over yourself.  <br>Defiantly not</br>  <br>It's Love Honey, everyone knows this.</br>  <br>It was grool</br>  <br>Snail slime.</br>  Anna is the purest slut.  <br>It's biodegradable lubricant. What a thoughtful stalker, gave him such precious lubricant so he wouldn't use WD-40 which gives off toxic fumes.</br>  its vaginal mucus<br><br>spit or anal mucus lacks the vicosity compare to vaginal mucus</br></br>  drool wouldn't kept it's fluid state for as long as she opened that letter.  it actually looks like an ovulating vaginal mucus...<br>highly intoxicating if you smell it directly....makes your head go dumb</br>  <br>Could have been a high-quality air- and watertight envelope?<br>This bears further study. What we need is a wide selection of stationery, the smuttiest animes we can find, and an /a/neue with a raging ladyboner for SCIENCE. Any takers?</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/Ms9NVc22HIs  [ ]<br><br>A friend and I made a video about this week's episode.</br></br>  <br>she is so hot...</br>  <br>Why won't anyone just rape Rika? She's asking for it.</br>    This episode was the lewdest thing I've seen in a while.  <br>He needs to get his roof fixed.</br>  <br>and his windows.</br>  How would Okuma get laid if he wanted to?  <br>By doing nothing.</br>  <br>Looks like alien cum</br>  <br>It isn't as if Anna pull this sort of stunt again, right?</br>  <br><br>For real. This could be better than hentai.</br></br>  <br><br>That bitch is fucking nuts, she needs dick like she needs to breathe.</br></br>  <br>It was fluid of druid</br>  <br>That is why Okuma should give her a dicking. She is bound to calm down after he gives her one.</br>  <br>We all know he's too pussy to do it.</br>  <br> hi </br>  holy<br><br>fucking<br><br>shit<br><br>that escalated quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> defiantly <br><br> its <br><br> it's </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Reddit</br>  <br><br>Well, it's a good thing Anna was about to rape him then.</br></br>  <br>She was just expressing her pure feelings of love. The is nothing more righteous then what she was trying to do.</br>  <br> anal mucus <br><br>wut</br></br></br>  <br> capitalising reddit <br>You can't fool me, mr. infiltrator<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anal mucus anon. You've never heard of it?<br><br>Next you'll tell me you've never heard of vagina bones as well.</br></br></br>  <br>it was snot.<br><br>Jesus I hope this is popular in nipland so I can get all the doujins of reverse rape, femnetorare, kajo defloration, and gang/mindbreak of sophia.</br></br></br>  <br> it was snot. <br>i cant tell if you're doing a bit or being serious or something else entirely</br></br>  <br>What kind of paper is she using that holds the liquids intact without it drying up?</br>  <br>i think anna's pussy juice is just too viscous to be absorbed/evaporate.</br>  How did Anna manage to get home without getting dehydrated?   become a wild rape-beast <br> leave dripping all over the streets <br>She's probably more sexually repressed than all of 4chan combined.</br></br>  <br>She is in puberty (16 or so), has never looked at porn (or at least she didn´t even know it was porn) and has never masturbated. Of course she is crazy horny. Anyone would be.</br>  I decided to pick this up. Is it worth the wait for hiryuu? I'm just using HS right now.  <br>just use clawhammer in the meantime, if you cant wait. HS is censored to shit</br>  What is the anime called?  <br>Shimoneta</br>  <br>he was about to be raped in the middle of his own home and closet troll was  all go for it </br>  <br>thanks, though the color looks a bit duller for some reason.</br>  holy shit the quality is so much better on funni but hammerclaw doesnt have censors.<br><br>I can't do this.</br></br>  <br>I keep hearing about a version where there are no censors and it's pissing me off because I wanna see more shit like this episode for all it's worth.</br>  Question of the century.  Anna is a fluid druid<br><br>Goddamn my dick</br></br>  <br>Hiryuu and Clawhammer are both uncensored. Hiryuu isn´t out for episode 4 yet.</br>  <br>What is being uncensored? I watched the first 2 episode release of Hiryuu and it still has those bleep or ding sound.<br><br>Though I can see that Anna's drool while licking Tanuki on the latest ep was not on Funi release.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Still no nips. you get to see love "honey" tho.</br></br>  http://webm.host/82a62/  <br> no nipples <br>What is this weak shit?</br></br>  <br>Someone needs to shop Snake smearing her juice on his face with his robo-hand</br>  <br>Nevermind, she's covering it the whole time. Still, fuck.</br>  Anna has a sweet ass  <br>Rika and Hyoka are top-tier waifu material. Just imagine all the SCIENCE sex they'd have with you. Excitedly experimenting on you with the goal of giving you the very zenith of sexual pleasure. Dumbass slures can't even compare.<br><br><br><br>This was pure gold, I can't wait for the dubs man. Show this anime to everyone, let em' know what's going on before it gets to that point.<br><br><br>Such is the feminine imperative. You white knight a girl with violence IRL and she WILL fucking rape you. That's a fact.<br><br>It's how they're programmed, the damsel in distress act is a highly effective genetic sorting algorithm. Beat all the rapists? Well, that means your genes are best genes. She *will* want your babies after that, for ye have proven thine worthiness through combat. Hell, any of her friends that saw it will rape ya too.<br><br>Instant harem, just add badass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this is not okay.</br></br>  Did someone edit this scene to have her shout ALLAHU ACKBAR yet?  <br>grool is thicker.<br><br>Do you think MC will let Anna know she was being lewd? Will that speed up the plot? Will MC not tell her until later?</br></br></br>  This girl is fucking insane. I'm really hoping that the MC is a broken man after this and stays the fuck away from her  <br> This girl is fucking insane. I'm really hoping that the MC is going to fuck her for good <br>fixd</br></br>  <br>This. If you wouldn't stick your dick in that overflowing love-honey pot, I just don't know what to do with you.</br>  She was fucken pissed. She's gonna do something, I can feel it.  <br>you can feel the fury in her face</br>  <br>Yes, she will find new insects.  And lead student body to yatsugamori  Laughing Fuwa this ep or next?</br>  <br>If she NTR'd that yandere slutbag, I'll lol.</br>  <br><br> I'll lol <br><br>could you at least TRY to not sound like an outsider jesus christ</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, can't wait. I'm expecting some fucking Terumi level insane shit from her. She snapped, you don't snap the SCIENCE chick, you will regret it and you will regret it hard.</br>  I don't suppose the LN is translated?  <br> newfag trying to be autistic about "lol" just to fit in </br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51626439<br><br>Hey guys what's up</br></br></wbr>  I am not as funny as you guys, but you clearly see her shambling home at the end of the episode and   there isn't any "drool"coming from her face   It is shocking how people can stand CR release, not even waiting for Hiryuu.  <br>Well there is a tiny droplet of drool hanging from the side of her mouth but that doesn't explain how she drooled all over her panties.</br>  Gotta say that escalated quickly.  <br>Or at least raw + ass</br>  <br>It's like cookie dough</br>  <br>She's not even stimulating herself and she freaking soaked those panties.<br><br>Also why does everyone here keep calling her a slut? Is everyone here just as ignorant as the guys in the anime, or did /a/ change the definition of it for the need to call someone a slut at least once a day.</br></br></br>  <br>I would pound her ass raw if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>That ain't drool anon, that's love honey, and she's leaving a trail of it as she walks without her panties to hold it in.<br><br>Gotta love being a puddle fetishist in this episode, whole thing made me diamonds.<br><br><br>Natural born slut, pre-lubed for all the cocks in the world. She needs a good dicking already, give a whore what she wants, cocks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  She can open her own cookie factory with the ammount of Love honey she leaks out.  <br>she never had anything sexual happen to her and she doesn't even know what that is, as soon as puberty hitted and the occasion appeared, she relesed the kraken<br> did /a/ change the definition of it for the need to call someone a slut at least once a day. <br>yes</br></br></br>  <br> tfw she will never make love-honey flavored cookies for you </br>  <br>Now post the psycho-pass blood bottle  and the fried bacon one </br>  Reminder that she is not only crazy lustful, but she's also as strong as an Amazon. Try to keep her away from her favorite dick with a chastity belt? She's going to break that shit with a hammer.  Well shit.  Is Anna the girl of your heart?  <br>so far the whole scene from the moment Anna enters his apartment has being the most recognizable moment of the season, we'll be talking about this and comparing shit to it easily 5 years from now</br>  Is slut mirai going to be animated?  <br>yes, without any reasonable doubt yes</br>  Am I going to get raided for watching this? Do I need to watch it behind multiple proxies?  <br>pls tell me that there's padding in that shit</br>   /a/ confusing DEEP LOVE with lewd rape <br><br>Anna is a pure maiden, fags.</br></br>   /a/ meetup   <br>I bet she gets micro-orgasms from the shockwaves sent through her body each time she strikes, squirting a little each time.</br>  Those insects are in a better place now, right?  <br>That faces shows the joy of discovery. Also she probably soaked his pants right there.</br>  <br>maybe if we get S2</br>  <br>Wait, so the BS law actually passes? How do you come back from that? I mean, once that's in place the K-types have won absolutely. Wouldn't breaking it get the decency squad on your ass with a checklist to see if you're worthy and ready to reproduce according to strict governmental eugenicist guidelines?<br><br>I mean, I'm only going on the anime but fuck, this shit is the funny version of Orwell. Big Brother is literally watching you fuck at that point, but he no likes the fucking. So how the hell do fuckers fucking fuck?<br><br><br>No doubt, she's pure lust incarnate.<br><br><br>Yes they are, fuel for the funerary pyre of that slutty whore Anna. Don't fuck with SCIENCE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of man has posters of elephants on the wall? Subtle subliminal homosexual tendencies there, Tanukichi.</br>  <br> Anna is a pure maiden <br>This.<br> gets hugged and patted on the head <br> falls asleep on his lap </br></br></br></br>  Is there a bigger fluid druid than her? I think she could fill an entire bucket with only her love honey in less than an hour.  <br> we cleaned ur lab no need to thank us </br>  Why would Japan make laws like this if they already have extremely low birth rates?  <br> implying i can read moonrunes <br>there might aswell be written the source of eternal youth</br></br>  <br>Unless Okuma put the chastity belt on as a defensive measure against Anna's advances<br><br>I haven't read the LN, just speculating.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet her parents are actually crazy degenerates who are getting off on stoping anyone else from getting lewd while they can do it no problem.</br>  <br>She could open up a hotsprings with her vag geyser as the water source.</br>  <br> Anna catches her parents having sex <br> realizes they're full of shit <br> joins SOX <br>I can see it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;realizes they're full of shit <br>She would know what they are doing.</br></br>  I genuinely hope that this ends with the school being corrupted and fighting off the oppression of the government only to have their asses handed to them and all be put in work camps/executed in a very pyrrhic victory for the state  <br> vag-geyser <br><br>I am going to only refer to Anna by this term from now on.</br></br></br>  <br>She thinks that is just an expression of love anon, she pretty much tried to rape Takumi and thinks it's not lewd or wrong in any way.</br>  Why would you ever hide your porn in a school locker. <br>That old writer guy knows whats up. Forest porn is the only way to keep your stash safe.</br>  <br>she's not half-wrong</br>    <br>Why defend? She's hot, you admire her, and she wants your dick inside her. God fucking damnit do you need it to be anymore ideal than that? Just fuck her already!<br><br><br>That's if she even realizes how lewd they're being by doing it. She tied up her love interest and was about to rape him and she still thought she was innocent!<br><br><br>That wouldn't be funny though. Now, everyone having an orgy right in front of the decency squad only for all of them to just watch and jerk off to it and/or join in on the other hand...<br><br><br>/k/ is right again. Best plan is always to grab SKS and go innawoods!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the hell is that worm that Scientist-chan gave to MC?  <br> vag-geyser <br> not omankonsen </br></br>  <br>Because his whole image of her is being literally cummed on.</br>  She's alredy this crazy for Takumi and she hasn't even done any real foreplay aside from some light rubbing against his crotch. <br><br>I wonder how crazy she would get if she actually managed to rub one off, or ends up having sex with him. She's lustful yeah, but once she gets a taste of it i bet she would not be leaving around snail trails, they would be small streams.</br></br>  <br>And this is bad... why? You like her, and she lusts for you with the intensity of a thousand suns. I fail to see why anyone save a hardcore faggot or MGTOW would refuse such prime breeding material literally willing to rape you to get that dick.</br>  <br>He's in denial tough, he alredy expressed how it felt to be doing dirty things or "wrong" things according to the system. I'm guessing he'd be actually into banging the shit out of her, but he's still trying to deny that side of him.</br>  <br>or maybe it will satisfy her curiosity</br>  <br><br>Glasses calling him out on it. If you don't want to bang the ever loving shit out of her if you get into a relationship with her you're being weird.</br></br>  <br>It's mostly a new feeling for her yeah, but she kinda gives off the yandere vibe and seems to be the type who'd want to feel like that as many times as possible, if she finds out how good it feels she'd be chasing after him even harder.</br>  <br> stop stop <br> kanji kanji kanji object </br></br>  Hot springs episode when?  <br> W-why does the love of my life want to fuck me? Just kill me ;_; </br>  <br>"Research" doujins when?</br>  I can't help but feel like the demographic of this thread just hit puberty.   Hand going straight for her own asshole. <br>Best grill.</br>  <br>A mixed bath?</br>  <br>Who is glasses anyways? From pics shown, it seems like she wants the dick just as bad, but is more pushy than crazy.</br>  <br>RIGHT INTO THE DANGER ZONE</br>  <br>Considering how pure minded she was, that's some crazy instinct leading her to act this lewd without even knowing where babies come from or masturbation, or any kind of fetish ever.</br>  I didn't expect Anna to be a nutter. Let's hope this is a one time thing and she isn't possessive.  Science girl is going to snap.    <br> Is enforcing the fight against lewd to get the man she likes to notice her <br> Got into his home after seeing the note telling that he also loved her, and pretty much tried to rape him <br> Leaks out "love honey" everywhere just from thinking about the guy <br> Was in pure bliss mode just from stradling him <br> Yandere vibes <br><br>Yeah, she's not gonna be possessive at all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, i tought you meant the other girl that comes later who also wears glasses.</br>  <br><br> self-proclaimed lewdest girl <br><br> loses her shit when she sees a dick <br><br>what.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is it wrong to want a gf like Anna?</br>  Anna needs to make her dreams come true.  <br>At least she never falls in love with Okuma.</br>   Want Anna to win and her accepting her lewd side <br> It will be a Kajo end no matter what <br><br>Feels bad</br></br></br>  Hopefully its popularity raises in Japan a bit.<br><br>People on futaba seem to be enjoying it, at least.</br></br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>Maybe his dick is really ugly.</br>    <br>sames, i just want Anna to be satisfied</br>  <br> sees his completely erect dick <br> panics and calls it gross tons of times <br>I didn't expect her to be this unprepared for the real thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Lewd, yes. Actually explicitly sexual, no.</br>  <br> Dat shadow </br>  <br>nah, other scene showed her turning her face in the hotsprings after seeing him having a boner from bathing together with then, she's just a prude. Loves dirty jokes like a 13 year old, but can't handle the real deal.</br>  <br>Oh my god, it's long and thick.</br>  <br> &gt;Is enforcing the fight against lewd to get the man she likes to notice her <br>Damn, I just realized he told her all that shit in his introduction to her.<br><br> &gt;Yandere vibes <br>I don't get that.<br><br> Yeah, she's not gonna be possessive at all <br>The only other grill in the Okuma bowl is Kajou and they're friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> guroi guroi guroi guroi <br>It must be really fucking horrible.</br></br>  <br> elephant posters <br>just sayin'<br>he's hefty and he know it</br></br></br>    Is Saotome into NTR? Does she want Okuma to fuck her waifu Anna while she watches from the closet?  <br>Makes her more appealing. Anna will only like him for his D, she'll like him as a person.</br>  <br>she must have some tiny as fuck nipples then<br> anime logic </br></br>  <br>Anna doesn't even know the purpose of a D, her love for him is the purest</br>    <br>Some others are gonna join, including a trap.</br>  <br>She just wants to draw man, I'm willing to bet she'd fuck him herself if it meant her being capable of drawing proper lewd.</br>  <br>Would you care about NTR or not if the first time you saw a live sex scene was between a person you admire and someone else? I'd assume only the dick (or the vagoo) can have any say in that.<br>And wasn't Saotome's admiration for Anna purely because she's so pretty anyway? What the fuck is up with you people trying to force NTR where there isn't anything.</br></br>  <br> I'll never strike fear in the hearts of women with my 15 cm pingas </br>  <br>He just makes her cunt gush, she doesn't like him as a person. It isn't love, it is lust, pure lust.</br>  <br>Anon she didn't even know he had the D. Stop saying she's just a crazy slut.</br>  Does the fact that Okuma told Saotome he loved Kajou come into play in the future?  <br> wanting 3dpd </br>    <br>off course he does, but only because she's in love with him, keep in mind that she is cluless about sex</br>  <br> Maybe his dick is really ugly <br><br>What does a "Good" looking dick looks like anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>Being clueless about sex doesn't mean that isn't what she wants here anon.</br>  <br>i would post mine but i would get banned<br>t. i think i have a nice dick</br></br>  <br>When is the Pink Haired girl going to appear?<br><br>So far we just have Ranko Hata's Daughter.</br></br></br>  <br>When your head doesn't look like a raisin</br>    <br>Her design reminds me of radiohead doujins.</br>  Anyone else get weird vibes from how she acted like in front of science? All this and that about love, those grand statements that imply she isn't in her gourd.  How can one produce so much saliva? Not some small shit that saliva is thick as hell.  <br>She's confusing being horny with being in love <br>that much is very clear.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeah. Kind of the statement of the show: blocking an entire society off from any outlet for sexuality will get you a country full of nutters<br> although historically it just seems to lead to organized pederasty sooner or later </br></br>  <br>The Okuma should dick her hard so she gets it out of her system. Would probably solve a lot of problems.</br>  <br>well shit, i could continue posting but in the end all our arguments will be: my psot &gt; your post. so whatever<br><br> anime physics </br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded. She liked him personally before any of this happened, even defending him against Goriki. Now she's turned on and she doesn't know what to do with these emotions in her head.</br>  Best OP of the season?  I want to flash Kajou.  <br>Am I the only one that ships Fuwa and Okuma. <br><br>I mean she was the first girl to visit him in the hospital.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to tenderly love Kanjou and tell her how I like her jokes while we hold hands.</br>  <br>She only defended him because she is a nice girl with great morals when it comes to things that aren't sex. She just wants to bang him even if she doesn't know it yet. It isn't even a crush at this point.</br>  Will the anime show Trap-kun?  <br>Not him, but you are retarded. Just read light novels.</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT AYAME HAS A DICK?!</br>  <br>fucking where</br>  <br>I am not. I am just reached a proper conclusion after watching the anime. Her feelings are shallow.</br>  <br>what a nice girl</br>  <br>you're shallow</br>  <br>AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT?!</br>  <br><br>That is not Ayame, you dumb cunts.</br></br>  <br>chap?</br>  <br>Holy shit muh dick!</br>  <br>What chapter is this? I kept searching manga sites and all of them only covers up to chapter 3.</br>  This show makes my dick harder than hentai.  <br>Disgusting...</br>   Kajou is actually the pure one <br><br>I knew all along she was best.</br></br>  So there's Ayame, Anna, science girl, trap, glasses and possibly Gorilla after his trap ass.<br><br>Is that it, or do even more join in the LN?</br></br>  <br>I know, it's fucking glorious!</br>   love honey cookies <br>Does she give him pussy juice? How is this not horrifying? If I was Okuma I would quit the student council right then and there.</br>  <br>Is the Allahu Akbar meme still considered to be funny?</br>  Why is Kajou so ugly? She looks like Sayoko Minase.  <br> Being gay </br>  <br>She does have feelings for him, it's just that being sexually repressed her entire life made her lust just come out much stronger.<br><br>He did save her from the rock, if he hadn't given her a kiss, she would probably start liking him too, just not being able to know she was because of how innocent she was. The kiss gave her the spark she needed to get a flood of new feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>she is a matryoshka doll of purity</br>  <br>What anime is this ?</br>  <br>i would drink her love honey like a bottle of beer in a sunny hot day</br>  <br>Ok so is this person Ayame or not? I could never imagine Ayame being a trap but so far she is the only character that looks like that girl in that pic.</br>  <br>Not wanting to eat her vagina juice doesn't make me a fag. I like women.<br><br><br>Yucky. She will make him eat menstrual blood in the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prison School</br>  <br>That scene made me legitimately sad</br>  Who is the pink-haired semen demon with the vibrator and when will we see her?  <br> yucky <br><br>I'm guessing you'd never give a girl cunnilings then?</br></br></br>  <br>wimminz are especially horny when they're menstruating</br>  <br>No, you are a faggot. Go back to tumblr.</br>  <br>Kajou saved her too. Anna didn't even visit him in the hospital.<br><br>She has no cause to like like him. She doesn't like him as a person.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING NORMIE<br>GET OUT<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br></br>  <br>not him but i have never</br>  <br>The trap is not Ayame, he is a new character that might get introduced if there is a 2nd season.</br>  <br> Anime girls <br> Menstruation </br></br>  <br>He's one of officials or government people</br>  <br>Kajou did save her yeah, but it was part of the plan, him taking the force to the rock for her was not, she saw him being selfless for her.<br><br>Also, she didn't visit him because she wanted to make sure that when he came back he'd see that she was the same anti lewd girl he liked, plus was probably scared of what she felt whenever she got close to him, being a new feeling and all.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, so Kajou will never develop romantic feelings for the MC? Fucking Dropped!</br>  <br> 4chan <br><br><br>Yucky. Okuma should know Kajou is where it is at.<br><br><br>Never been sweetheart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically speaking, he saved Kajou from the rock not her, hence him questioning himself during that entire scene.</br>  <br><br> you'd <br> you would <br> WOULD <br> you're mum <br>I mean come on</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The question isn't if you have, it's if you would.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm asking as an example anons. goddamit.</br></br></br>  <br>You are an SJW faggot.</br>  <br>Wrong, he appears on main site and will appear in one or two episodes since  is from second volume, which adaptation started in latest episode</br>  <br><br>OK tell me how do I give a 2D girl cunnilings then.<br> Sorry for overreact. </br></br></br>   Anna <br> cock craving slut <br> Sophia <br> hates sex and everything associated with it <br><br>How does this happen?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sweetheart <br>Fem Anon detected.<br><br>Now TITS or GTFO!</br></br></br></br>   beta faggot <br> retard <br> sperglord <br> one-dimensional <br> talentless <br> extremely extremely generic <br><br>Is he the worst harem MC ever?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  No, just a typical one.  Watch more harem anime.  <br>At least he is not as dense as Ichika</br>  He has his moments. He was a lot better in the earlier parts of the series.  <br>Not to mention what a fucking White Knight faggot he is.</br>  <br> &gt;talentless <br>Pretty sure he's a good cook.</br></br>  <br>Unmanly</br>  <br> watching harem anime <br><br>Ayy<br><br>I inderstand TLRD but niseikoi is just a cock tease. Have fun getting cockteased til the end</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still feel like  Onodera or Tsugumi  would've won in roughly 5 chapters if Raku wasn't written as a total idiot.</br>  <br>Because its a harem</br>  <br>Shokugeki no Raku when?</br>  Why can't harem protagonists be like pic related?  Are there even good harem MCs or good harem in general?<br><br>I can't get into this genre or understand people who read this garbage.<br><br>Are they all virgins with no social experience at all?<br><br>Why can't they make ONE SINGLE harem that shows how people actually behave?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>how come 4 10/10 girls want his dick again?</br>  <br>Definitely in the running</br>  <br>Because harem is self-insert for virgin neckbeards.</br>  <br>Pic related is my favorite harem protag. Only harem I've ever followed for the MC.<br><br> intentionally makes girls fall for him <br> isn't dense  <br> knows the effect his actions have on girls <br> chooses best girl in the end </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does he wear a fagboy hairclip?</br>  <br> &gt;chooses best girl in the end </br>  <br>Watch more anime you pleb, he's bad but not the worst.. and the worst aired the same season Nisekoi did.</br>  <br>Try Kusen Madoshi, it's airing this season and MC is the best thing about this show</br>  <br> how people actually behave <br>Maybe you should stop watching anime and get the fuck out.</br></br>  <br> hurr it's anime so it's ok for people to act retarded </br>  just stick your dick in the eldritch horror already you fucking pussy  <br>I'm sure there's worse. MC from  CAT PLANET CUTIES  was pretty aggravating.</br>  <br>Arata from Trinity 7 is probably the most based battle harem MC.<br>And the girls don'r fall for him just because he exists like 99,9% of harems</br></br>  Nisekoi is garbage   2015 <br> Watching haremshit </br>  <br><br>No, that would be this faggot.</br></br>  <br> hasn't watched school rumble </br>    <br>Ken FUCKIN Sugisaki<br>Araragi<br/></br></br>  <br>Both faggots.</br>  <br>I don't know if Monogatari counts as a harem, but ararararagi kun is pretty based</br>  <br> 2d otaku <br> still manage to kiss one of his harem <br>both are faggot,but hes better</br></br></br>  <br>TOPKEK<br>He is one of the better MC in this shitty genre. Funny how he accomplishes more than Raku-faggot</br></br>    <br>Tomaru isn't the MC though. In all the games he appears in, protags can absolutely not keep their harems in check.</br>  <br> Why can't they make ONE SINGLE harem that shows how people actually behave? <br>Because that would remind the viewer of their own life.<br><br>And you know what the average viewer for this shit is like. Right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichigo 100% is good<br><br>The MC is generic as fuck though</br></br></br>  <br>You just listed the traits of every harem MC ever.<br><br> Harem shit is garbage anyway you should feel bad </br></br></br>   Anyone worse than that faggot from Nyaruko-san <br>Surely not?</br>  <br>You're a faggot</br>  <br>10/10 would chill with</br>  <br>He's faggot because he acts like a total cunt, he also pussies out when he sees a naked girl so he's not that different</br>  <br> every <br/></br>  <br>nigga did you even fucking see the shit storm from Kampher?</br>  <br> Why can't they make ONE SINGLE harem that shows how people actually behave? <br>Because PATRIARCHY and BARBARISM. A harem story where the MC never gets with anyone is because the author is spineless, but is satisfied with remaining the illusion. A story where an MC gets with someone is either rushed or well-done. A story where an MC gets with everyone is either horrible or well-done, depending on whether or not the harem is actually structured and if the MC is the one who makes it (the worst is where the MC has the decision made for him by others).</br></br>  <br>Those against a harem story just due to it being a harem are worst off. It's a negative kind of projection.</br>  Hey anon, guess what!  YOU'RE ALWAYS SUPER SPECIAL!    THAT'S WHY YOU ARE HERE WITH ME <br><br> Literally the only thing people remember about the anime. </br></br>  <br><br>The anime was just a delusion. The anime was just a delusion. The anime was just a delusion.</br></br>   tfw no anime of C;H that actually animates the VN instead of becoming a trainwreck halfway through   <br> tfw no Rimi </br>  So how exactly does the anime butcher the VN? I lack the free time to read it myself.  <br>in vn plot is still shit but you can literally feel chaos in your head</br>    <br>I'm imagining things just looking at her.</br>    Fuck, now it's going to be stuck in my head all day.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PJa<wbr>1-_Xj4KY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Being a true lolicon is suffering.  <br>There's no drama tho. Where did I even write drama? <br><br>Also Black Lizard is a man.</br></br></br>  He's the strongest lolicon.  <br>Did you by any chance eat a little girl?</br>   fat people chopping girls up <br> pedophiles eatting children <br> <br>I'm not sure I want to know what this is.</br></br></br>  <br>Does this include toddlercon too?</br>  What is the difference between loli and pettanko?  <br>Yeah, she's the first thing which pops in my mind when I think of a pettanko. Another might be Misaka</br>  <br>Is that your final answer?</br>    <br> That's a creature </br>  Would you consider true flatness required for pettan status?<br>What about the barely present beginnings of tits that just never had a chance of making it?</br>  So, Toei tweeted this shot of Patamon from the new PV that will be shown at Digi on Fest next week. Just one more week Anons.<br><br>http://digimon-adventure.net/<br><br>PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CN9<wbr>xpqG1giY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Which series should I rewatch first, Adventure or Tamers?  <br>Adventure, Tamers is overrated.</br>  <br>Why do they insist with black versions? Does anyone find them interesting?<br><br> no VictoryGreymon <br>They fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They had to make a new game, and models for the Digimon. Hopefully they make more for the sequel.</br>  <br>When I was a kid I appreciated how vulnerable the Tamers kids were. I also liked how their inner conflict wasn't solved in one 11 minute episode like western cartoons.</br></blockquote>]
