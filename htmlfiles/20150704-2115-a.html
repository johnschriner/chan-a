It makes no sense to assume everyone with an opinion is the same person.<br><br>It seems to me like this mod's strategy is backfiring. He (the crack fag) was originally a madokafag, now he is spreading to other mecha shoujo shows like nanoher and symphergear because the mod has his own personal agenda to enforce instead of protecting the quality of the threads. IP's are infinite, while mod time is finite. If someone is autistic enough and feel slighted, he will always win the war of attritition against a mod because all he has to do is reset his router, while a mod can't do shit long-term without banning half an entire state or country. Good luck explaining to half of California or Texas that they can't post anymore since some shitty yuri drama. You say he is autistic but if you felt slighted you would probably do the same thing pretty much. Normies wouldn't but I the "autistic" people would. If the issue is derailing then everyone should have been banned in wherever the original instance was. Instead, it seems only this crack fag was banned and not the people he was arguing against. Which continued since then. It is unsurprising an autistic with enough time and unlimited IP's continues to argue his case. <br><br>Well, whatever, sorry for adding to the shitstorm since I don't want to see it too. It just seems there is no way to communicate to the mods, I can hope troid will see this and change his mind.
