Funny thing, being a horse-fag. Cerea said something along the lines of「餅は餅屋」. "Get Mochi from the Mochi shop", meaning "leave it to the pros". Google translated it as "horses for courses", which was oddly apropos. Skynet learns every day.</br>  <br> Cross-dressing has evolutionary advantages. <br><br>Not exactly what I was expecting to learn today...</br></br></br>  <br>They thirst</br>  <br>I can't wait until they do the Arachne version of this chapter. We need to learn if they are solitary shelob-types or have large hives and cities underground.<br><br> Imagine a giant silk covered structure suspended in a well lit ravine deep in a cavern. Across it are moving hundreds of vast eight legged forms... each attached to a beautiful woman.  <br> And as you walk down the silk covered bridge to the main gates, a bunch of small children, young arachne girls, skitter up and are all 'Ooooo!

I really wanted a Scylla in Monster Musume, they are right next to Arachne as my fave monster girl.

If she tries to shapeshift, she could lose the wetsuit. Any part outside the wetsuit is still vulnerable to dissolution as well.</br>  <br>It's more fun to speculate without speech(trains your body language skills), as well as looking for funny background stuff.</br>  <br>it would be funny if the story of her resurrection involved sucker punching Lala.</br>  <br>I'd go as far to think hating each other.

She merely survived it. She quickly retracted her boobs once she realised she'd die without the wetsuit.</br>  <br>What if Miia's cooking actually created her in some sort of perfect culinary storm of poor ingredient usage?<br><br>Sugar, spice, and everything else. These were (thought to be) the ingredients to create the perfect meal for Darling. When suddenly Miia accidentally added 4th ingredient.

I'd complain that they aren't shown enough, but I kinda like that they aren't flaunted nearly as often as Cerea's.</br></br>    <br>Yes. I know that.

Lesbian lizard is a B, But then Polt is D cup and the next biggest. Everyone else id E cup or above.</br></br>    <br> There was a point in the manga I was literally wondering if Crab was just trying to figure out even bigger sizes for his characters. I think it started with Tio and reached a head with Cerea's mother. <br>He is a tits man, like me. Same lactation fetish too.</br></br>  Have people been making webms of the almost dailys?  fish people waterworld is cool and all but when are we gonna see the arachnids people, and their insect society  <br><br> Spiders <br> Society </br></br></br>  <br>Still best girl. Come at me bro</br>  <br>Doppel, Succubutt, Papi-MamI, the sheep at the farm.<br><br>There's plenty of reasonably sized tits in the manga, just not among the main girls. You're just basing a presumption on over-saturation by a specific cross-section.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Mero of all people is giga breaker tits too. She's always portrayed as being super skinny, somehow has boobs &gt;= Miia. Even suu with her morphogenic powers has only shown two settings: flat as a board and big bewbies.</br>  <br>Did you even go to school illiterate nigger? learn something about spiders faggot.</br>  <br> Doppel, Succubutt, Papi-MamI, the sheep at the farm. <br><br>Nobody cares about Doppel or Succubus, Papi-Mami had tiny titties just like Papi, and the sheep never ever whip out their boobs besides that faun-girl whore.</br></br></br>  <br>I never said anything about people caring. I'm stating that they exist for the people what want them.<br><br>Unless you specifically demand that a reasonably busty girl be in the main harem. That would be a more legitimate complaint that whining about there not being any reasonably sized tits anywhere to be found.</br></br></br>  <br> All of those scales on her <br>What's wrong with that poor girl!? I'm glad she can be so happy but I hope she gets some good treatment.</br></br>  <br>why would i come out you if i agree with you anon?<br><br><br>I would die to be with Miia <br><br><br> i sometimes have fantasies about her killing me with her poison food in a murder suicide and petting my head in her lap and whispering "i love you" into my ear while i drift off  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I honestly don't know if Mero should be reasonably sized. On the one hand I agree that having her as a modest C or D cup would be great, but from what we've seen of her those chest beefers look mighty nice in her goth loli swimsuit.<br><br>More girls need to take Lala's lead with boob size. Dullahan's got an E cup but her combination heavy-clothes and surprisingly broad shoulders means it looks reasonable on her.<br><br>Which is really the problem, when you get down to it. The girls have massive chests but not a lot of mass to make them work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miia would never kill someone she loves!</br>  <br> not a lot of mass <br>Miia, Rachnee and Horse would all weigh over 400kg. I know it doesn't look normal on their female figures but you also have to consider that they are monster girls.</br></br>  <br> POTC crab stampede </br>  <br> killing yourself to be with someone else <br>The ultimate beta</br></br>  <br> I would die to be with Miia <br>More like you should just pay 800 dollars for a Miia pillowcase. Better than an heroing.</br></br>  <br> thinking someone who's in love with a 2 dimensional half snake lady cares about "betas" or "alphas" </br>  <br>Are you sure Mero isnt a better fit for your "needs" ?</br>  <br>Real thing in afterlife &gt; overpriced pillow</br>  <br> you also have to consider that they are monster girls. <br><br>I guess, but the idea that larger girls = larger boobs is kinda silly and only encourages Crab to give us huge monster-girls.<br><br>Miia strikes me as the kind of girl who would look much better with a pair of perky C cups.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wherever you are there's a class. What if you could enter 2D all of a sudden, would you want to be a 2Dalpha or 2Domega?</br>  <br>Personal preference I suppose. You can tell from the manga that crabman is a tit man more than anything else.</br>  <br>I know Miia's length is pretty inconsistant, but no way is it that fucking long...</br>  <br>canon length is 7 meters</br>  <br>They have to justify that $1000 price tag somehow. Also it might have come down to the size of the pillows that they are using inside it.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br> Rachne in charge of being best </br>  <br><br> what if i said i *accidentally*, made her flater </br></br>  <br>Shouldn't she be off begging the gungans for military aid?</br>  <br><br>Computer, give her ahaego!<br><br> And NUDE TAYNE. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based TF.</br>  <br>thank you based TF<br><br>Someone has to decode those moon runes.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based TF</br>  <br><br>Lamias are supposed to be long.

Knowing this, you should know that people always underestimate or overestimate what they eat. I know its an anecdote but I used to eat nothing but junk food and only drank soda and was still extremely skinny, to the point I could put my hand around my entire arm. When I actually started counting calories I noticed that despite eating like shit I was consuming not nearly as many calories as I thought I was. I'm going to assume you frequent /fit/ since you mention skeletons and calories in calories out. Thermodynamics are very real, but /fit/ seems to neglect the reality of metabolic rate and general lack of motivation to eat more or less. It is very possible and very easy to eat like shit and not be a fatass. Instead you will be extremely weak and have a very high percentage of body fat for your weight (e.g.: skinnyfat).</br>  <br>forgive me for not watching beyond the first fifteen minutes- it started physically hurting my brain when the hamsters-carry-her-to-the-bathroom bullshit happened</br>  having a high metabolism is a legitimate thing  <br><br>You mean normal Asian genetics.

I only translated the dialogue segments though. The descriptions of motion, the rooms and such would've tripled the amount I had to write, so I just summarized the most important parts of it. Also I am not a translator, I am just somebody who likes to read moonrunes, so this is going to be worse than amateurish. If you have any parts that you would like more detail on that I didn't make clear though, just respond to that post and I'll get back to you. Also if you want to say thanks, just respond to the OP, don't quote like ten posts because gets messy.<br><br>Also stated previous, this is just the Mizore and Nozomi segments which I would say covers about 50% of the novel, so this is going to jump around a LOT. There's also some Mizore/Nozomi segments I didn't translate because there's a lot of small scenes of them which I didn't feel like writing in the context.<br><br>I put everything in a pastebin if you just want to read it by yourself<br>http://pastebin.com/9Vwpgzzu<br>it's unedited though so no bully</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The plot of volume 2 is centered around the Oboe player Mizore, and her friend Nozomi who was a freshmen that quit last year. Nozomi wants to come back but Asuka refuses to let her back in and this leads to the main drama. Kumiko gets involved playing detective as she interviews every second year student in the bass section about what happened last year, including Mizore and Nozomi themselves. But as Kumiko digs deeper, she isn’t entirely sure about what is the right thing to do anymore.<br><br>The subplots of the second volume revolve around themes of friendship and how easy it is to lose a friend you considered very dear. Kumiko and Azusa don’t talk anymore despite them being best friends in middle school. Kumiko also worries how long her relationship with Reina will last since Kumiko can’t keep up with Reina’s ambitions. Reina’s subplot is about her love for Taki sensei as another adviser comes to the club who everyone thinks is Taki sensei’s girlfriend. This leads Reina into spiraling depression but she gets her smile back at the end. Taki sensei’s subplot revolves around his wife who is finally revealed by Taki sensei’s best friend, Hashimoto who also comes to help advise. And then there’s a subplot about the change of Asuka and Kumiko’s relationship from section leader and club member to something more like mentor and protege. Asuka starts grooming Kumiko to be her successor but at the same time Kumiko butts heads with Asuka on their ideals. As Asuka starts to peel off her mask little by little, Kumiko is afraid of what she sees. <br><br>The major events all take place around a 3-day band camp and the events that follow which you could consider the equivalent of the audition from volume 1. However this summary only covers Mizore and Nizomi’s scenes so most of that band camp is left out until I one day do the same thing for Asuka which I really am contemplating because rereading what I wrote, it turns out I messed up on a lot of things and I hate it when that happens.</br></br></br></br>  The second volume begins with Mizore and Nozomi at the prefecture tournament after the results of their performance (sound familiar?). Mizore is sitting on the bus next to Nozomi with her shoes and socks off after the Kyoto competition. Mizore is deep in thought, thinking about the nature of competitions. When they say competition, they always refer to music competitions such as the Kansai tournament.<br><br>Nozomi: Carsick?<br>Mizore: It's not that, I'm fine<br>Nozomi: You sure? Then that's good<br>Nozomi: The competition is really over<br>Nozomi: I thought we'd make it all the way to Nationals this year but the world just doesn't work that way <br>Mizore: uh huh<br>Nozomi: It really sucks that it’d end this way<br>Mizore: ...yeah<br>Nozomi: Hey Mizore<br>Nozomi: Do you really think that?<br>Mizore: I do<br>Nozomi: Sorry, I said something stupid. Of course you’d be upset too<br>Mizore: It's fine, I'm not really that upset<br>Nozomi: I'm being a little strange right now. Sorry, I'll shut up<br> Mizore mumbles to herself <br>Mizore: Just what are competitions really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based novelanon</br>  <br> Mizore and Nozomi's middle school (also Natsuki and Yuuko's), Minamichuu was a fairly famous school. They made it to the Kansai tournament six times and got dud gold three times but never made it to Nationals. They could never figure out what they were missing that was needed to make it all the way to Nationals though. Nozomi is the current president of the club after reaching her third year. The previous years they got dud gold and then silver. <br>Nozomi: This year we're definitely going to Nationals!<br>Nozomi: This is the last competition for us in middle school, so lets really make it to Nationals!<br> The club practices their free-choice piece "Daphnis et Chloé" to perfection, spending their entire summer rehearsing instead of having fun, all in order to make it to Nationals, Unfortunately, the result was nothing short of a disaster <br>Club Member A: So this is the result huh<br>Nozomi: This has to be a mistake<br>Club Member B: We couldn't have gotten Silver. It's still Kyoto right?<br> Mizore is speechless and keeps thinking to herself that this all must be a mistake. That at any moment now, a staff member will come to tell them they messed up. And then... <br>Neighboring School: KANSAI TOURNAMENT!<br>Nozomi:..... lets get on the bus<br>Nozomi gathers everyone up<br>Nozomi: I'm real sorry guys, for putting you through all this<br> Everyone is back on the bus now and the scene shifts back to conversation between Nozomi and Mizor. The bus is eerily quiet, everyone too tired to cry anymore. Mizore now thinking about how all their effort and work amounted to nothing in the end. Nozomi suddenly asks Mizore another question <br>Nozomi: Hey Mizore, do you like competitions?<br> Nozomi's is facing the window with her back turned towards Mizore but Mizore can see through the window’s reflection that Nozomi is about to cry. Mizore’s throat starts to burn but all she can do is shove her face in her lap and pretend that she's sleeping. She mumbles <br>Mizore: I hate them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Season 2 never?  Mizore’s first actual introduction in the novel is when Reina tells Kumiko about despite the fact that Reina shows up at 6am for practice (and to see Taki-sensei), Mizore is actually always the first one to club. Kumiko agrees to join Reina for early morning practice, and after Reina’s daily visit to Taki sensei’s office, they find Mizore already in the club room practicing. Mizore’s oboe is so beautiful that Kumiko thought it was someone singing at first until she saw it was infact Mizore playing her oboe.<br><br>Reina: This is Mizore, the one I was talking about<br> Kumiko listens to Mizore’s long tones, thinking about how beautiful they are but at the same time she says <br>Kumiko: It feels like something is missing though<br>Reina: Good morning<br>Mizore:.... How rare<br>Mizore: Two of you today?<br>Reina: Yes that’s right, today we came together<br>Kumiko: umm, Mizore senpai, do you always come this early<br>Mizore: yes, always<br>Kumiko: It’s really early though. Do you like practice?<br>Mizore: Who knows<br> Mizore goes back to practicing while Reina and Kumiko look at eachother, both thinking that Mizore is a strange person and leave her be. Kumiko feels like this is the second time she’s felt this way about a person since she joined the club. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Based.  This is the first scene with Nozomi. Prior to this scene, Nozomi has been with Natsuki, the both of them planning on how to get Nozomi back into the club. You also get to see the other side of Natsuki for the first time, a bit more serious side of her which she only shows when she is around Nozomi. Kumiko sees Nozomi in the hallway, peeping into classroom 3-3, the bass section practice room<br><br> Nozomi: ....eh?<br>Kumiko: Um, can I help you?<br> Nozomi blankly stares at Kumiko, and then goes “ahh” and then stares at Kumiko’s euphonium <br>Nozomi: Are you by any chance a first year from the wind ensemble club?<br>Kumiko: Ahh, yes. That’s right<br>Nozomi: This room is the bass section’s practice room right? Do you know when Asuka senpai is going to come?<br>Kumiko: Umm....<br> Kumiko is wondering why this girl wants to know about Asuka senpai and gets lost in thought thinking about where Asuka might be and if she should tell her. Suddenly Natsuki runs down the hallway towards them with an extremely frantic look on her face. This is the first time Kumiko has ever seen Natsuki lose her cool. <br>Natsuki: Hold it Nozomi! What do you think you’re doing?<br> Nozomi goes “crap” and Natsuki is panting, trying to catch her breath after running here <br>Natsuki: Didn’t I tell you to hide somewhere until I told you to come? What happens if you get caught by the other club members?<br>Nozomi: But...<br>Natsuki: No buts! You’ll get in even more trouble than you already are in.<br> Nozomi gives in to Natsuki’s angry gaze <br>Nozomi: Okay I get it I get it. If I got not say in this, then I’ll be waiting in room 7 until you call for me.<br>Natsuki: If you get it then good</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Noice  <br> Nozomi then takes a close look at Kumiko and says “you look like a real mischief maker”. Kumiko isn’t sure if she should agree or disagree with that. Nozomi starts laughing and &gt;Natsuki sends a a suspicious look at Nozomi <br>Natsuki: hold on, you didn’t say anything weird to her did you?<br>Nozomi: I didn’t say anything~<br> Nozomi pats Kumiko on the shoulder a few times and slings her backpack onto her shoulder <br>Natsuki: Don’t do anything strange like this again. The one who’s going to be in trouble is you after all.<br>Nozomi: I said I get it<br> Nozomi starts to walk away, her ponytail swaying back and forth. She then slowly turns around. Nozomi tries to make what resembles a smile, her bangs covering her eyes. <br>Nozomi: Natsuki<br>Nozomi: ...Thanks<br> Natsuki is silent, her throat tightens a bit and she lets out an unusual sound. She looks like she’s trying to choke something down. Some time passes until Natsuki responds <br>Natsuki: You don’t need to thank me <br> Natsuki groans <br>Nozomi: well, I’ll be waiting then<br>Natsuki: Kumiko, I’m sorry but could you keep what just happened with her a secret? I need to think about a lot of things.<br> Natsuki’s voice almost sounding like a threat, Kumiko nods repeatedly. Relieved, Natsuki finally returns to her normal cynical smile. Midori walks towards them, cradling her contrabass in both arms. <br>Midori: Kumiko chan, lets hurry and practice!<br> Natsuki goes into the band room <br>Midori: Did something happen with Natsuki senpai?<br>Kumiko: It was nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Later that week, the bass section is gathered up as usual for practice. Since the incident with Nozomi, Natsuki has been asking very strange, especially around Asuka. Asuka takes notice to this and asks<br><br>Asuka: Natsuki, do you need something from me?<br> Natsuki unnaturally sits up straight <br>Natsuki: Ahh, no, sort of kind of.. not really..<br> Asuka looks deeply at Natsuki through her glasses. Kumiko mentions how Asuka’s gaze is sometimes scary. Everyone in the room looks at those two worriedly. <br>Natsuki: Actually, I do have something to consult you on senpai<br>Asuka: Consult me? Do you mean with me as a person or me as vice president?<br>Natsuki: Both..... will you hear me out?<br>Asuka: Well if it’s just listening then whatever<br> Natsuki leaves the room with everyone puzzled as to what she’s doing. After a few minutes, Natsuki leads Nozomi into the room by hand. <br>Riko:...... Nozomi chan?<br> Riko suddenly stands up, knocking her chair to the ground. Gotou takes a big gulp. Nozomi looks to Kumiko and shrugs her shoulders. Midori and Hazuki both make eye contact, realizing how grave the situation is. Asuka as usual does not act surprised or act anything for the matter. She fixes her glasses and then says <br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan, why are you here?<br> Asuka says this with an intonation that is telling her to leave. Nozomi stands silently in front of Asuka and bows her head. Goto and Riko watch with eyes wide open. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: I want to return to the club!<br>Asuka: ha?<br> Asuka turns to Natsuki <br>Asuka: When you said consult, did you mean this?<br> Asuka is in her emotionless uncaring state now, asking only to get confirmation. Natsuki takes a step back due to the pressure exerted. But then she resolves herself and bows her head too, alongside Nozomi <br>Natsuki: Please let Nozomi back into the club<br> Nozomi raises her head in response to Natsuki’s plea and looks at Asuka <br>Nozomi: I’m not asking to be let into the A-team right now. I just want to be let back into the club, like in the B-team. I want to help support the A-team and see with my own eyes us making it to Nationals. Please let me back into the club. Please I beg you.<br>Asuka: Not happening<br> Asuka is completely unshaken with Nozomi’s plea <br>Asuka: At the very least, I’m not letting you back into the club until the A-team’s competition is over. If you still want to rejoin the club, then go Taki sensei and receive permissi-<br>Nozomi: I want your approval!<br>Asuka: If that’s the case, then give up on wanting to rejoin until Nationals is over. After that, you can come back whenever you want.<br> The room is filled with silence, Nozomi with a strained look on her face <br>Asuka:.... I want the freshmen to go home. We still have things to talk about here.<br> The scene ends here with Kumiko, Midori and Hazuki leaving the club. Midori and Hazuki are disappointed they don’t get to see the ending. They then start making plans to go to the pool together instead since they haven’t hung out together in a while. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you're going to translate it, translate it, don't adapt it into a screenplay.    <br>Nozomi comes back to the club several times making the same plea and the freshmen as usual are kicked out everytime. This scene involves Kumiko, Hazuki and Midori listening through from the doorway after being kicked out as usual<br><br>Nozomi: Senpai, why cant I come back?<br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan, will you give it up already? Even if you keep coming here everyday like this, I already said I won’t let you back in. And I want to practice.<br>Nozomi: But if I don’t ask, then you won’t give me permission to come back. And even if I’m here, you can just ignore me and practice if you wanted.<br>Asuka: Just by coming here you’re wasting my time. And in the first place, Natsuki what are you trying to do? Why are you trying to bring this kid back into the club?<br>Riko: umm, Asuka senpai, I think Natsuki is just trying to help out a friend in need....<br>Gotou: Riko..... that goes without say. Asuka senpai already knows that.<br>Natsuki: Always sucking up to Asuka senpai aren’t you Gotou? Even though your girlfriend said something good. I wonder when Riko is going to ask you to decide between her and Asuka.<br>Gotou: Natsuki, be quiet. Riko wouldn’t say that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shut the fuck up and enjoy. <br><br><br><br>Thank you so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: Senpai!, I really just want to help everyone. I want to come back to the club one more time. Is there anything wrong with that?<br>Asuka: No, there’s nothing wrong with what you’re saying Nozomi chan. Not a problem at all. Simply put, the only reason why I wont let you back into the club is my ego. If you really want to come back to the club, just forget about me and go to the Taki’s office and....<br>Nozomi: Then there’s no point if it’s not you!<br> The sudden outburst from Nozomi silences the room. Nozomi mutters <br>Nozomi: Asuka senpai is special<br> Kumiko agrees that Asuka is special and thinks back to all the times Natsuki has repeated these words. Asuka takes a deep breath <br>Asuka: Take a second to think about why I’m not letting you back into the club<br>Nozomi: huh?<br>Asuka: I can’t approve you coming back to the club. You wouldn’t a plus in my book.<br>Natsuki: What do you mean?<br> Asuka doesn’t answer and leaves the room. With a big grin on her face, she looks at Kumiko and the others who are now caught in the act. <br>Asuka: Lets end this discussion here today. We can all agree to that right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Favorite Hibikek?  This is another early morning scene but this time Yuuko arrives too and you can see Yuuko’s interactions with Mizore. Ever since Nozomi left the club, Yuuko has always spent what time she could with Mizore to keep her company.<br><br>Yuuko: Good morning!<br>Reina: Good Morning, Yuuko senpai<br>Yuuko: ahh, the first year duo has arrived too<br>Mizore: Yuuko, do you not like them?<br> Kumiko is surprised that Mizore is the one who said it  <br>Yuuko: Not like what?<br>Mizore: Those two, Yuuko<br>Reina: Is that true? Senpai?<br>Yuuko: Who knows? Whatever, Kouhai<br> Reina and Yuuko both start laughing. Kumiko is slightly creeped out at this scene. Yuuko moves next to Mizore. <br>Yuuko: Mizore, you really dont know much about the band drama do you?<br>Mizore: Because I’m not interested<br>Yuuko: Well, that’s one of your good points I guess.... speaking of which I just remembered something<br> Yuuko stands up from her seat and suddenly turns to Kumiko and Reina who are eavesdropping <br>Yuuko: Are you two making sure to practice or what?<br> Yuuko then walks up to Mizore and whispers in her ear <br>Yuuko: Yesterday it seems like Nozomi came to club and said she wanted to come back<br> Mizore’s eyes that were shut while she was playing suddenly widen and she gasps but doesn’t say anything. Mizore then lowers her eyes and shuts them again, as if to shut out everything around her. <br>Mizore: is that so?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kumiko after practice finds Mizore balled up and sitting on the stairs with her face in her lap, visibily shaken. Mizore looks up and sees Kumiko when Kumiko walks up to her. Kumiko describes Mizore’s eyes as looking like the ocean at night. So dark you can’t see through it but calm like the surface of still water. This scene kicks it up a bit, there's a lot of stuff that happens beforehand though.<br><br>Kumiko:.... Mizore Senpai<br>Kumiko: Senpai, are you okay?<br>Mizore: I feel awful<br> Beads of sweat roll down Mizore’s face <br>Kumiko: Senpai, whats wrong? Should we go to the nurses office? It’s summer break so I don’t know if its open or not though...<br>Mizore: It’s fine, I don’t need to go<br>Kumiko: Your complexion is awful though. Are you sick?<br>Mizore: It’s not that. Don’t worry about it<br> Kumiko tries to drag Mizore onto her feet when suddenly she hears the sound of a flute playing. It’s the flute solo from the start of their free-choice piece. The warm and lovely sound of the flute suddenly makes Kumiko recall where she heard this sound from. <br>Kumiko:.....This is the sound of Minamichuu’s flute players<br> Minamichuu is famous for their flute players. Kumiko in particular has always loved the sound of their flutes and has listened to recordings of their flute players countless times. The person who is playing the flute perfectly right now is like listeneing to that recording once again. Kumiko knows for a fact that none of the third years can play this well which makes her look towards the direction from where the flute is coming from, curious as to who is playing. <br>Mizore: I’m going to throw up<br> Mizore’s expression has gotten worse. She gets up struggles to hold onto the handrail. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, are you okay? Don’t push yourself<br>Mizore: This sound. No. I don’t want to hear it<br> Mizore uneasily descends down the stairs, as if she’s trying to run from something. She disappears down the hallway. <br>Kumiko: I wonder if she’s okay?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko continues on her way to find her competition piece she left behind while listening to the sound of the flute, which has moved onto the next part of the song. She arrives at her room and finds Nozomi <br>Nozomi: Oh hey, it’s the UFO kid<br> Nozomi then suddenly gets worried and uneasily points at Kumiko, realizing she got caught. Kumiko notices that Nozomi has a folded up copy of their competition piece <br>Nozomi: ahh, well this is uhh that you know. I just wanted to try playing it.<br>Kumiko: Where did you get that from?<br>Nozomi: I got it from Natsuki. Ahh, can you keep this a secret. It’s not like I want to participate in the competition or anything. I just wanted to try playing it you know.<br>Kumiko: Is that right?<br>Nozomi: yes yes. Hey wait, isn’t it kind of early today? Your ensemble.<br>Kumiko: Today’s ensemble ended early. It’s the Firework festival.<br>Nozomi: Ehhh, That means Asuka-senpai left already right? There was no point in waiting for her then!<br> Nozomi shrugs her shoulders. Kumiko actually knows that Asuka is still in the music room but decides that its better to keep her mouth shut for once to stop any drama from happening. <br>Kumiko: Anyway, Senpai, you’re really good. I’m surprised.<br>Nozomi: Ahh, thanks<br> Kumiko is looking around for her copy of the competition piece that she left behind which she has now found <br>Nozomi: You came looking for that?<br> Kumiko notices that the silver flute in Nozomi’s hand is not one from the school <br>Kumiko: Senpai, is that flute your own?<br>Nozomi. Ahh, it is. At Minamichuu, if you don’t own your own flute you couldn’t play, so I asked my parents to buy it for me<br>Kumiko: Senpai, you really like the flute don’t you?<br> Nozomi’s mouth suddenly shuts and she squeezes her flute. Kumiko looks at Nozomi  <br>Kumiko: What’s wrong senpai?<br>Nozomi relaxes herself and then makes a smile<br>Nozomi: I like it. Love it.<br> Kumiko feels like Nozomi was trying to convince herself what she was saying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Mizore's eyes were blue? KyoAni changed her eye color.</br>  It’s pool day and everyone is here. Kumiko Hazuki Midori and Reina all arrive together. Hazuki is the only one who can swim since she went to swimming school as a kid. Reina mentions the previous day it’s a good time to go to the pool because her bikini is getting tight. Kumiko asks where but Reina won’t answer because she’s embarassed. Reina and Midori surprisingly hit it off, Reina likes Midori because she’s very talented and Midori likes Reina because Reina has big breasts (not even kidding on this one). Asuka and Kaori then arrive together, in black and white bikinis respectively. Kumiko at first doesn’t recognize the dazzling goddess in the front of her because Asuka isn’t wearing her glasses. And both of them are licking icecream cones because why not. Midori comments that Asuka and Kaori look like models. Reina sarcastically says that it’s a good thing Yuuko isn’t here or else she might faint if she sees Kaori in a bikini. And speaking of the devil, Yuuko screams in the distance and rushes over to them, with Mizore right behind her. Not wanting to get involved in the chaos, the girls leave. Midori and Reina go off to buy some icecream while Kumiko decides to go buy the drinks at the vending machine. When she gets there, Kumiko suddenly gets a cold shock when someone places a cold bottle on her nape  <br>Kumiko: hyaaa<br> Kumiko turns around, and sees the smuggest expression on Nozomi’s face. <br>Kumiko: Nozomi senpai, why are you here?<br>Nozomi: I came with my class. Natsuki is here too<br>Kumiko: ahh, speaking of which, Asuka said she saw Natsuki too.<br>Nozomi: So Kumiko, how long have you practiced the euphonium?<br>Kumiko: ah, since elementary school. I was in a brass band.<br>Nozomi: I see <br> Kumiko feels the mood is kind of bad since all the previous incidents and tries to twist off the cap of her bottle but it’s too wet to get a grip. Then she finally asks <br>Kumiko: Umm, Senpai, why did you quit the club?<br>Nozomi: hm? You’re interested in that?<br>Kumiko: I’m curious<br>Nozomi takes the bottle from Kumiko’s hand and swiftly twists the cap off<br>Nozomi: It’s quite a long story but are you okay with that?<br>Kumiko nods her head and they both sit on a nearby bench<br>Nozomi: You’re in the A-team right?<br>Kumiko: Ah yes. I am.<br> Kumiko is worried about the question she was asked and grips her bottle  <br>Nozomi: What do you think about Natsuki being put in the B-team?<br> Kumiko stops breathing and her eyes widen. Nozomi is still smiling at her but her eyes look very serious <br>Nozomi: Nozomi is a 2nd year but in the B-team while you’re a freshmen in the A-team. What’s the deal with that?<br> Kumiko then goes through a bit of audition trauma in her head again and there’s a long reminder on what went down last volume. Kumiko is worried that Nozomi might hate her for taking Natsuki’s seat. <br><br><br>hrm, I think everyone has actual normal Japanese colors in the novel, like every has either brown or black hair so I assume the eyes are brown. Kumiko just thinks Mizore's eyes look like the ocean. I'll have get back to you on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko:.... it’s just how things turned out<br> Nozomi makes an unexpected expression at Kumiko while Kumiko continues speaking <br>Kumiko: Kitauji is planning to go to Nationals, so it’s expected that there should be an audition to choose the members. In a competition, an individuals skill is also necessary. As long as the individual excels in skill, even if they’re a first year, I think that them being chosen is just how things are going to turn out<br>Nozomi: Well said, I think so too<br>Kumiko: eh?<br> Kumiko was taken back by Nozomi’s unexpected response. She expected Nozomi to be angry but Nozomi starts cackling and then smiles <br>Nozomi: Well, I also understand that it’s better to pick someone based off of their skill rather than some ambiguous standard. It’s unbearable to have someone be put in the A-team over me just because they’re older even though they’re hopeless.<br>Kumiko: You didn’t have auditions last year?<br>Nozomi: That’s right. It seems like last year’s advisers goal was for “everyone to get along and have fun in club” so members were chosen from the third year down. Just thinking about it now still pisses me off.<br> The bottle in Nozomi’s hands make a crushing sound <br>Nozomi: What are the serious members supposed to do when they’re told that? You can’t win if you gather together all of the useless slackers. If that’s the case, then normally you should be putting the skilled first years who are practicing into the A-team. If you gather all of the kids who who want to try and win, then even if you get silver or copper you can accept it when that happens.<br>Nozomi: But, that adviser from the start never planned on winning in the first place. We couldn’t accept that. If we could all play together, we’d be fine, that’s what we truly thought. But under that adviser, those dumb third years got cocky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks for this, OP  <br> Kumiko starts thinking about the adviser before Taki sensei who was Rikako sensei. She was very kind and gentle adviser but had no drive to push the club to win. She left because she got pregnant which is how Taki sensei ended up at Kitauji. <br>Kumiko: If you were so determined then why did you quit the club Senpai? Why are you trying to come back now after all this time?<br>Nozomi: Simply put, I’m jealous<br>Nozomi: During Minamichuu’s last competition, we got silver. At first we were extremely disappointed but when we got to highschool we got back on our feet. My classmates from middle school and I, we decided that in highschool, even if we couldn’t make it to Nationals, we’d at least take gold at the Prefecture competition. Well, Kitauji is a weak school but we were enthusiastic about being able to reshape the club.<br> Nozomi looks like she’s thinking about the past while a sudden breeze blows between them <br>Nozomi: But the moment we joined the club, it didn’t go at all like we planned. When we were first years, there were a lot of third year students you see. Furthermore, our club is a lot like the sport clubs right? There’s a pecking order. That’s why no matter how hard us first years tried to speak out, nobody would listen to us. Instead, they called us annoying. The second years were afraid of the third years so they didn’t listen to us either... and thanks to them there were a lot of complaints.<br> And then this goes on for about another few pages and ends with Nozomi and the rest of the members quitting when they’re all put into the B-team while the third year slackers get all the A-team seats without audition. The members who quit joined the K-ON (light music) club. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko: Mizore and Yuuko senpai were all from Minamichuu right? Why didn’t those two quit?<br>Nozomi: When we asked Yuuko, she said she’d like to try it for a little longer. Mizore... from the start nobody tried to ask her to leave I think.<br>Nozomi: That’s because she’s Kitauji’s one and only oboe. I don’t think she understood how we felt. That’s why nobody said anything to her.<br> Is that really what happened thought Kumiko. That since Mizore was the only freshmen in the A-team, nobody asked her. Maybe it was just because they were all jealous. But Kumiko didn’t have the courage to say this to Nozomi. <br>Nozomi: Speaking of which, Yuuko asked me the same thing<br>Kumiko: Yuuko senpai did?<br>Nozomi: Yeah. She asked me why I didnt ask Mizore. The reason why Mizore was in our club in middle school was because I invited her. Mizore and I are childhood friends, we’ve always been close. So I think that’s why Yuuko asked me about it.<br>Kumiko: So then, what did you say back?<br>Nozomi: hm? Oh, I didn’t say anything important. Just that I didn’t have a need to ask her, something around those lines. I don’t really remember.<br>Kumiko: ..... is that so?<br> Kumiko didn’t feel like Nozomi was being dishonest, and that Nozomi answered with how she actually felt. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: When I tried to quit the club, Asuka senpai called out to me. Everyone thinks Asuka senpai is special and to be honest, even the third years were scared of her. Asuka senpai refuses things that would be a loss to her through her calculation and treats everyone accordingly. The bass section was called Tanaka’s Kingdom and was mocked by everyone but I think the bass section was better off than the rest of the club.<br>Kumiko: What did Asuka senpai ask you?<br>Nozomi: Well, I was really surprised when it happened. I was going to submit my form to quit the club and Asuka senpai just happened to be there submitting something. As soon as we met she suddenly looked and me then started laughing and said “Wow, you’re really quitting? What an idiot”, she was treating me like a real fool.<br>Kumiko: Huh, isn’t that actually really mean?<br>Nozomi: It was mean wasn’t it? I got really huffy too when that happened. I said back that “this isn’t an idiotic thing to do” and I don’t know why but she just laughed some more. Then she said “You’re going to sacrifice yourself for a bunch of worthless people? That sounds pretty idiotic to me. If you just leave them alone, sooner or later they’re going to graduate”. Going that far to say that, I realized that Asuka must’ve hated the third years too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: Thinking back on it, Asuka senpai must’ve been trying to stop me from leaving. She asked me if I couldn’t just wait for the third years to graduate but I said I couldn’t wait. If I could wait, then I wouldn’t be trying to quit in the first place. Senpai I feel was a bit shocked and then said “I don’t know about the other members, but you’ll definitely come back to the club. The fact that you didn’t already join the Light Music club is my proof. You still have lingering affection for our club”. “If you quit now and later you want to come back, there’s no time limit for when the club will accept you again. If I feel like your presence in the club will become a minus though, then I’m sorry but I’ll object to you coming back. If you don’t want that to happen, then I’d prefer you stay in the club” she said.<br> Nozomi says Asuka hit the bullseye and continues <br>Nozomi: I don’t know why but that really set me off and I said back toher “No matter what you say, I’m not coming back and even in the most unlikely case that I do, I won’t come back until I get your approval!”<br>Kumiko:..... so is that the reason why you’ve been so obsessed with Asuka senpai?<br>Nozomi: well, yeah thats about it. I don’t really care about Asuka senpai herself, but the words she said to me those days I’ll never forget. What she said was right, a year later and here I am trying to come back to the club.<br>Nozomi: I was angry that time, but from the bottom of my heart I probably must’ve been happy when Asuka tried to stop me from leaving. I.. was a problem child in the flute section and I didn’t have a place where I belonged. I don’t have any good memories of that time..... the bass section on the otherhand must’ve been a very lovely place. Well there you have it, until Asuka senpai accepts me, I won’t rejoin the club. Asuka senpai is very special to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi goes on to talk about how the real reason why she wants to come back to the club is because of how Taki sensei replaced Rikako sensei and now the club made it to the Kansai tournament. It’d be obvious that anyone who quit last year would want to come back after changes like this she says. Nozomi’s dream has always been to make it to Nationals, and she doesnt mind if she doesnt get to play but as long as she gets to go. <br>Nozomi: Asuka is a really amazing person. She can see parts of me even I can’t see. Senpai won’t let me rejoin the club because she thinks if I rejoin I’ll become a minus. But I dont know what she means by that. I don’t think there’s anything Senpai would be worried about either.<br> Kumiko thinks back to a conversation she had with Reina about Nozomi. Reina thinks that Nozomi ran away from the club but Kumiko thinks that Nozomi chose the best option she had available to her. <br>Kumiko: I’ll look into it<br>Nozomi: huh?<br>Kumiko: I said I’ll look into why you can’t come back to the club. And then I’ll get you back into the club. The fact that you can’t come back is strange.<br>Nozomi: Just the fact that you care makes me happy. Thanks Kumiko-chan<br>Kumiko: hey wait a second... my friends bought me icecream!<br>Nozomi: If you don’t hurry won’t your icecream melt? Sorry for keeping you for so long<br>Kumiko: It’s fine, I should be thanking you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nozomi is so smug, I knew she was gonna tease Kumiko.  I really love this scene since it's a Taki sensei scene<br><br>It’s around 7pm at school and everyone except Kumiko, Mizore and Taki sensei have left. This is a really great Taki sensei scene, not so much a Mizore scene even though she’s there. This is another one of the scenes where Kumiko and Taki sensei interact and it reveals a bit about Taki sensei’s past and character. Kumiko is staying late to practice. During a period where both of them are taking a break from playing, Kumiko starts talking with Mizore.<br><br>Kumiko: Senpai, have you ever lived anywhere besides the Kansai region?<br>Mizore: I haven’t. Why?<br>Kumiko: ahh, I noticed you don’t speak in the Kansai dialect so I’ve always been curious<br>Mizore: My cousins live in Saitama. Probably that’s why.<br>Kumiko: ah, so you’re infected? It makes sense that if you’re always speaking the main dialect, you’d be infected with it.<br>Mizore: uhuh<br> Mizore goes back to practicing and so does Kumiko. Taki sensei peeks into the classroom <br>Taki: I see you two are still here practicing <br>Taki: Isn’t it about time for you two to go home?<br> Kumiko hurriedly stands up from her seat but Taki sensei says its fine and gestures with his hand that it’s okay to keep practicing <br>Taki: I only came to see how you two were doing, I don’t mind if you still want to practice<br> In Taki’s hand are some bottles of green tea from the school vending machine <br>Taki: These are some refreshments. Keep it a secret from the other students though<br> Taki puts his index finger on his lip as he says this. Kumiko thinks about how strange it is that Taki sensei is acting a bit smug with that gesture, even stranger that it actually looks natural. He hands the bottles to Kumiko and Mizore <br>Taki: This one is for you Yoroizuka-san</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko: Sensei, do you always stay this late?<br> As Kumiko asked this, Taki looks a bit troubled for a moment but then laughs <br>Taki: Well, it’s that kind of job after all<br> Kumiko’s heart feels a bit tight as she looks at Taki sensei’s usual smile and grips her bottle <br>Kumiko: But aren’t you always here early in the morning too? Isn’t the club a lot of hard work?<br>Taki: It certainly it is a lot of work, but it’s a fulfilling job. Pursuing the same dreams with all of you and spending everyday like this is truly enjoyable. And well...<br> Taki pauses for a short moment, his eyes becoming slightly strained. The intonation from those last words were unpleasant. Kumiko looks up at Taki sensei, and Taki sensei changes his tone to a sarcastic one <br>Taki: I don’t have a wife or any kids after all. The only thing I have is this job.<br> That’s a lie, Kumiko immediately thinks. What part of it is a lie, Kumiko doesn’t know, but Taki sensei is an adult and hiding things are what adults do. Kumiko keeps quiet though. Taki sensei then walks up to the music stand <br>Taki: Since you two are still here, shall we practice?<br><br>Also I saw you guys talking about it in the other thread, but they actually talk about it in the novel  Kumiko think's Taki sensei's wife looks like Kaori </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this is the jump to band camp, it's quite a big event but you only get to see the stuff that happens with Mizore<br><br>This scene takes place at band camp, at around 1am. Kumiko gets something to drink after Reina keeps her up all night being frustrated about Taki sensei and Niiyama sensei flirting. Mizore suddenly taps Kumiko on her shoulder from behind and Kumiko screams, thinking Mizore is a ghost. This leads to the first major conversation between Kumiko and Mizore. This is also the first scene where Mizore actually shows emotion when speaking normally she's very quiet and expressionless. Also Kumiko is afraid of ghosts which leads to some funny stuff in later stories.<br><br>Kumiko: [screams externally]<br>Mizore: ...... you don't have to act that surprised<br>Kumiko: Senpai, what are you doing up this late?<br>Mizore: Couldn't sleep. Decided to play a game<br>Kumiko: What kind of game?<br>Mizore: Rhythm game<br> Kumiko notices Mizore is playing a rhythm game on her cellphone on extreme difficulty level, the notes flying by too fast for Kumiko’s eyes to keep up with <br>Kumiko: Senpai, do you like games?<br>Mizore: Not really<br> Mizore turns off the game, and points to Kumiko's music player with wrinkled eyebrows <br>Mizore: That song, turn it off<br>Kumiko: eh?<br>Mizore: Daphnis et Chloé. I hate it<br>Kumiko: Ah, I'm sorry<br> Kumiko thinks Mizore must have really good ears if she could tell what song was playing just by listening to the sound that leaks out of her earbuds. Mizore moves over to a bench next to the vending machines. <br>Mizore: Sit<br>Kumiko: umm, so why did you join the wind ensemble club?<br>Mizore: I was invited, by a friend<br>Kumiko: By friend do you mean Nozomi-senpai?<br> Mizore's eyes suddenly widen in response and then she nods  <br> umiko: umm, why did you not quit the club last year? A lot of the other members from Minamichuu quit <br>Mizore: ...... did you want me to quit?<br>Kumiko: ahh, no, I didn't mean it like that!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore:...hey<br>Kumiko: w-what?<br>Mizore: Competitions, do you like them? (they’re talking about music competitions in this conversation)<br>Kumiko: come again?<br>Mizore: I.. hate competitions<br>Kumiko: Why do you hate them?<br>Mizore: Competitions are unfair<br>Mizore: Objectively evaluating music, that's unreasonable<br>Kumiko: Why do think that?<br>Mizore: Because in the end, it's up to the taste of the judges<br>Kumiko: Well, it's true that it's hard to attach a score to the performing arts. Stuff like dance is like that too.<br>Mizore: That's why skill is important.<br>Mizore: When it comes to Nationals, all the free-choice songs will be the ones of the highest difficulty. It's easy to judge something based on skill and hard for it be influenced by personal taste<br>Mizore: Despite that, in the end it's still decided by the taste of people. There are a lot of things I cannot accept about these evaluations.<br>Kumiko: Hrmm. But that’s just how things are. It's gotta be hard evaluating it in any other way.<br>Mizore: Just how things are?<br>Mizore: Words like "just how things are" don't justify anything. Competitions are painful. I wish they would just disappear.<br>Mizore: Sorry<br>Kumiko: That was unexpected. Senpai, you don't like competitions?<br>Mizore: Hate em<br>Kumiko: Then why are you still in the club? If you just wanted to play, you could do it outside of the club.<br>Mizore: I don't know<br>Mizore: I don't know anything anymore<br> Mizore and Kumiko then return to their rooms. Kumiko lies in her bed thinking about how competitions have effected her life. Both the pain but also the happiness from winning them. Kumiko thinks about what must have happened to Mizore for her to come to hate competitions. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Asuka a shit as usual  <br>Taki is such a best ;-;</br>  <br> Asuka did nothing wrong <br><br>This scene takes place between Asuka and Mizore on the last day of band camp, with Kumiko listening in on their conversation of course.<br><br>Mizore:.....I’m sorry<br>Asuka: I told you not to worry about it Mizore-chan<br>Mizore: But, at this rate, Asuka senpai you’re going to become a villain<br>Asuka: But you’re still afraid right? It’d be much worse if this leads to trouble during the competition.<br>Mizore: I don’t know myself why I’m afraid. Nozomi didn’t do anything wrong<br>Asuka: It’s true that kid didn’t do anything wrong. But, Mizore chan, you didn’t do anything wrong either<br>Mizore:.... I’m sorry<br>Asuka: ahh, why are you still apologizing?<br> Asuka and Mizore start walking further away from where they are. Kumiko wants to keep listening but she realizes that this conversation is not something she should be peeping on and runs away as fast as she can as to stop herself from coming back. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is a really important scene between Kumiko and Asuka because it shows how much their relationship has changed since the first volume. Kumiko waits until the cafeteria is mostly empty and approaches Asuka who is still eating. This is the scene where Asuka reveals why she hasnt been letting Nozomi back into the club to Kumiko. <br><br>Kumiko: um, Asuka senpai<br>Asuka: hm?<br>Kumiko: I have something to ask you<br>Asuka: What do you need to ask?<br>Kumiko: It’s about Nozomi senpai though<br>Asuka: oh it’s about Nozomi-chan? Okay okay<br>Kumiko: um, why wont you approve Nozomi chan coming back to the club?<br>Asuka: hrm, so it’s about that.... well why do you think I should?<br>Kumiko: well, because Nozomi is very talented. We had the incident between Kaori Senpai and Reina, so maybe you’re worried about another incident between upper and lower classmen... I think<br>Asuka: ah, okay. I see<br> Asuka gives an expression that shows she really wasn’t listening to what Kumiko was saying which annoys her a little <br>Kumiko: Please tell me then<br> Asuka starts laughing <br>Asuka: I’m sorry. Well, I’ll tell you but before that there’s something I need to ask you<br>Kumiko: What is it?<br>Asuka: If I tell you, what do you plan to do? Are you planning to tell Nozomi-chan?<br>Kumiko: S-should I not?<br>Asuka: It’s fine if you tell her. It’s just that I think it might be a bit painful for you to do so.<br>Kumiko: What do you mean by painful?<br>Asuka: Just like the word means. Well no matter what I say you’ll still want to do so I’ll tell you<br>Kumiko: Please tell me<br>Asuka: That’s what I was planning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka scrapes her fork against her plate, a high pitch screech rings out <br>Asuka: Mizore chan, she can’t handle Nozomi chan<br>Kumiko: Really? What do you mean?<br>Asuka: It’s what I said. Mizore-chan seems to have some trauma towards Nozomi chan and just by looking at her makes Mizore-chan sick. That’s why until the competition is over, Nozomi-chan can’t come back. If she has an effect on my dear Oboe, it’ll mean trouble.<br>Kumiko: What do you mean by trauma? Nozomi senpai and Mizore senpai have been close since middle school haven’t they? I heard the reason why Mizore senpai joined the club was because Nozomi senpai invited her.<br>Asuka: Well<br>Kumiko: huh?<br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan wouldn’t even dream that Mizore-chan was avoiding her. Infact she still thinks of her as her close childhood friend. Despite that, do you think you could tell Nozomi to her face that Mizore can’t stand being around Nozomi? Even I’m not that much of a monster.<br>Kumiko:.... so that’s why you’re against Nozomi coming back to the club?<br>Asuka: That’s right. No matter what, our club only has one oboe player. If I had to choose bewtween those two, who do you think I should pick?<br> Kumiko feels like she’s being lectured like a child right now. Asuka gets up and pats her on the back. <br>Asuka: my my, don’t sulk so much. This is a problem between those two and maybe by some chance it’ll be resolved. It might not be fair to Nozomi but she’ll have to wait until that happens though.<br>Kumiko:....okay<br> Asuka starts rubbing Kumiko’s hair. Kumiko feels like Asuka is treating her like a dog now. <br>Kumiko: Senpai<br> Satisfied, Asuka stops rubbing Kumiko hair <br>Kumiko: When Nozomi senpai was about to quit, why did you stop her?<br>Asuka: Well isn’t it obvious that I would stop my beloved kouhai from trying to quit?<br>Kumiko: Can you stop with that? I know you’re not that kind of person <br>Asuka: oh my, how harsh<br>Asuka: It’s because Nozomi is a talented person of course. Kids with talent might become useful to me in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best Natsuki scene <br><br>Kumiko is late at school practicing again but instead of Mizore remaining, its strangely Natsuki who is still at school. Since they’re together, Natsuki decides go home together with Kumiko. They talk a a bit about how the seniors are must have it rough since they have college exams to take too. Natsuki brings up how Asuka has the best grades in the entire school despite still practicing so much. Then Kumiko asks Natsuki<br><br>Kumiko: Senpai, why did you join the Wind Ensemble club in highschool?<br>Natsuki: hrm, why are you asking about that?<br>Kumiko: ahh, no real reason<br>Natsuki: I was in the Go Home club in middle school. Three years, I had a lot of free time. So when I entered high school, I decided to join an easy club.<br>Kumiko: So you joined the Wind Ensemble club?<br>Natsuki: That’s right. Wind ensembles, there’s a lot of people so they’re famous for slacking off<br> Kumiko thinks that can’t be right while Natsuki runs a bit ahead of her. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, why did you give Nozomi the music sheet for our competition?<br>Natsuki: What’s with that all of a sudden?<br> Natsuki starts laughing as if to deceive Kumiko <br>Kumiko: Also, why are you trying to make peace between Asuka senpai and Nozomi Senpai?<br>Natsuki: There’s not really a reason. It’s just that she told me that she wanted to come back to the club, so helping her out is the least I could do...<br>Kumiko: I know that much is a lie<br> Whether Kumiko suddenly grew a spine or if it was another slip of tongue she doesn’t know. Natsuki is wide eyed but fixes a smile <br>Natsuki: and what do you plan to do knowing that?<br>Kumiko: I’ve been talking to a lot of the second year students and I now I decided that I want to help. Like you, I want to help Nozomi senpai get back into the club. But after talking to everyones stories, I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do anymore.<br>Natsuki:.... so now you want to hear my story?<br>Kumiko: Yes<br> Nozomi stops walking and they’re standing in the parking lot of the train station </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Natsuki: Nozomi, I’ve always admired her<br>Kumiko: Admire?<br>Natsuki:Yeah, admire<br> Natsuki starts to blush a little at what she just said <br>Natsuki: I don’t like bothersome things so I’ve always avoided things like clubs. That was pretty fun and comfortable. But, during my middle school graduation ceremony, I thought to myself. Just what have I done these three years?<br>Natsuki: Nozomi was the president of the wind ensemble club, the exact opposite of me, hot blooded and passionate. During the graduation ceremony all of the kids from the Wind Ensemble club were crying and I thought they were all idiots since they were going to the same highschool anyway.<br> But says Natsuki <br>Natsuki: I was a little jealous of them. So in highschool I decided to join the same club as them. And then before I realized it, I ended up playing this strange instrument called a euphonium.<br>Kumiko: You really like Nozomi senpai don’t you?<br> Natsuki smiles without saying anything and they start walking again, Kumiko by Natsuki’s side this time <br>Natsuki: Kitauji’s Wind Ensemble club had a rotten atmosphere but to me it was a pretty comfortable place. There wasn’t a lot of practice and it was easy. But Nozomi didn’t think that and defied the Senpai. Watching her, I was honestly a bit surprised. Spending all that effort on a bunch of people who weren’t going to listen to you? That’s a huge waste of time right? Despite that she clashed with time like an idiot. If only she could’ve just weathered the storm and waited until she was a third year.<br>Kumiko: Her patience wore out I guess<br>Natsuki: So that’s when a bunch of kids starting talking about wanting to quit the club. I thought that it couldn’t be helped. The way the senpai felt about them was pretty blunt, and then the ignoring incident happened. They treated them like they weren’t even in the club. So even if those kids quit, nothing would change.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Natsuki pauses for a bit to think about something and then spills a smile <br>Natsuki: I got a little pissed off so I said some pretty rude stuff to the third years<br>Kumiko: What did they say?<br>Natsuki: hrm? Well it wasn’t really that big of a deal. Something like “you’re all crap”<br>Kumiko: huh?<br> Kumiko thinks thats a pretty damn big deal <br>Natsuki: That period was really horrible. Because of what I said to the third years, we became the targets of the third year. I really caused a lot of trouble for Riko and Gotou. Goto in particular is still pissed off about how Riko got hurt, so even now he doesnt talk about what happened in the past. Asuka senpai managed to talk to the third year students out of it so things were finally resolved peacefully.<br>Kumiko: So that’s the reason why Gotou doesn’t like to talk about the first year incident?<br>Natsuki: Right. Well, he also just doesn’t want to tell the first years about this horrible incident. Gotou’s, he’s a good guy. His personality is a bit gloomy though. <br> Natsuki tries to hide the fact that she’s blushing a little after what she just said <br>Natsuki: So that’s the whole story. There’s this incomplete burning feeling in me about how Nozomi senpai quit the club, I haven’t accepted it yet. So that’s why when she said she wanted to come back, I felt relieved.<br>Kumiko: Because now you two can be in the club together again?<br>Natsuki: well, there’s that too<br> While on the platform, a train rushes passes them. The light shining on Natsuki’s face, dying it red <br>Natsuki: I wanted to atone for my sins<br> The train exits the station, the wind pressure blows Natsuki’s hair. Natsuki starts to walk forward, as if to avoid looking at Kumiko. <br>Kumiko: What do you mean by atone for for your sins? You haven’t committed any crimes<br> Natsuki doesn’t turn around but begins to speak </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Natsuki: In the end, I didn’t do anything for her, even though I felt the pain she was in. I just watched from a distance. I wanted to do something for her. Nozomi really loves playing you know. With all her heart. I didn’t want to see the girl I admired be in that much pain.<br><br>Kumiko: So that’s why you’re trying to help her?<br>Nozomi: That’s right<br> It’s a hopeless and pathetic reason don’t you think says Natsuki. Natsuki’s is forcing her voice to be cheerful but it’s still pained. <br>Kumiko: It’s not pathetic at all<br> Kumiko’s voice is her shaky Kumiko voice. Upon hearing that, Natsuki turns around and looks at Kumiko with surprised eyes. Natsuki gently puts her hand on Kumiko’s hair <br>Natsuki: Sorry, for making you worry about me<br>Kumiko: There’s nothing to apologize for, you haven’t done anything wrong<br>Natsuki: Kumiko, you’re a good kid<br><br>Best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  nice  While doing some self practice, Nozomi finds Kumiko. Kumiko is relieved that Mizore isn’t anywhere to be found. This is the start of a horrible chain of disasters that leads to the finale.<br><br>Nozomi: It’s almost time for the concert<br>Kumiko: Senpai, long time no see<br>Nozomi: It’s right before the concert, so I didn’t want to bother your practice. There’s only three days until the Kansai tournament right?<br>Kumiko: You’re not going to see Asuka senpai today?<br>Nozomi: I went, but she already went home<br>Nozomi: Hey, about Mizore, how is she doing?<br>Kumiko: Mi-Mizore senpai?<br>Nozomi: I heard lately that Mizore has been having trouble with her solo part. I thought about giving her some advice.<br>Kumiko: ahh, well, umm, yes. That’s true. Umm, she’s been told she needs to put more emotion into her solo when playing.<br> Kumiko is trying her best to cover up whats going on <br>Nozomi: They said that to her? That’s strange<br>Kumiko: What’s strange?<br>Nozomi: Well Mizore, she’s a very quiet person, but when she plays, it’s like an explosion. This is so fun! kind of feeling.<br>Kumiko: Is that so?<br>Nozomi: Yep. That’s why I think something must’ve happened.<br> Kumiko now understands that to what Asuka means by Nozomi thinking that Mizore is still her close friend and that she hasn’t realized what is going on. That’s why nobody can tell her the truth. Asuka’s words ring in Kumiko’s ear about how Mizore and Nozomi can’t meet. <br>Nozomi: I hope I can help out Mizore<br><br>And then two days later, it happens</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The day before the competition during rehearsal<br><br>Nozomi: MIZORE!<br> Nozomi’s voice echoes down the hallway. The sound of frantic slippers can be heard. The voices of students gossiping. Mizore runs out of the music room. Nozomi: MIZORE! WAIT! <br> Nozomi screams from the doorway with her arms reaching out towards Mizore’s fleeing back. Nozomi stands there and watches as Mizore disappears. <br>Asuka: You’re the worst<br>Yuuko: Hold it! What the hell are you doing?<br> Yuuko is gripping Nozomi by her collar with both arms. Nozomi is shocked at what’s going on because she has no clue. <br>Yuuko: Why are you going this far to hurt Mizore?<br>Nozomi: wait, I didn’t do...<br>Natsuki: Hold on, Yuuko, what are you doing!?<br> Natsuki tears off Yuuko’s arms from Nozomi’s collar. Without calming down, Yuuko lashes out and shoves both of them. Natsuki and Nozomi both fall to the ground. <br>Natsuki: The hell you doing?<br> Natsuki is angrily glaring at Yuuko, different than what usually goes on between them. Natsuki is probably really angry thought Kumiko. <br>Natsuki: What are you trying to say Nozomi is doing? And I can’t believe you’re being so violent all of a sudden.<br>Yuuko: I’m not angry because she did something, I’m angry because she didn’t do anything!<br>Natsuki: Haa? I don’t get what you’re saying<br> Yuuko is looking back at Natsuki with the same angry glare, like they were natural enemies. Kumiko takes a look at their surrounding which is still in the classroom and decides to take a step back from the situation but Yuuko suddenly grabs onto Kumiko’s arm. <br>Yuuko: Are you going to look for Mizore?<br>Kumiko: ha?<br>Yuuko: If Mizore runs into someone while in that panicking state with someone who doesn’t know her, it’ll be a disaster. Hurry up and go look for her.<br>Kumiko: ahh, that, umm<br>Yuuko: I’ll look in the third and fourth floor, you go look at the first and second floor<br>Kumiko: R-roger!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good. Now summarize vol 3 I want the exact details where Asuka gets bitch slapped by her mum.  <br> Kumiko looks into Yuuko’s eyes. Besides anger, Kumiko can see that Yuuko has other emotions mixed into them and it’s a look that Kumiko knows too well. Yuuko lets go of Kumiko’s arm <br>Yuuko: Hurry up and go then<br>Asuka: Kumiko chan<br> Kumiko turns around <br>Asuka:This was an error in my judgment. Anyway, hurry up and find Mizore<br> Kumiko wonders what she means by error in judgment, and what the heck happened in the first place. Kumiko’s head is filled with questions but she prioritizes finding Mizore first. Kumiko runs throughout the first and second floor, covered in sweat by the time she reaches the last room. And what do you know, it’s the abandoned run down drama club room. From the doorway, Kumiko hears Mizore trying to catch her breath. Kumiko finds Mizore, balled up like she was during the last time she saw her on the stairs. Mizore covers her face with her hands when Kumiko walks towards her. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, um, what happened?<br> Kumiko sits down next to Mizore despite how much dust has gathered up in this abandoned room <br>Kumiko: Do you hate Nozomi senpai?<br> Hearing that name, Mizore raises her face slowly and stops covering her face with her hands <br>Mizore: I don’t <br> Mizore’s voice is horribly scratchy. Some time passes before she speaks again <br>Mizore: I don’t hate her, it’s not like that, at all<br>Kumiko: Then what happened? Did Nozomi senpai say something horrible to you-?<br>Mizore: No!<br> Mizore suddenly speaks out, surprising Kumiko <br>Mizore: No, Nozomi, isn’t bad. I’m the one who’s bad.<br> Kumiko gets a good look at Mizore’s face and notices her skin looks like the scarlet light filtering through the red curtains <br>Mizore:......Just now, Nozomi came to talk to me. And then, I got scared and ran without thinking. It’s because I’m afraid of seeing Nozomi. I don’t want to see her. So that’s why I hid.<br>Kumiko: Why are you afraid?<br>Mizore: Because then I’ll understand<br>Kumiko: Understand what?<br>Mizore: Understand the reality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I never had interest in the Wind Ensemble club. Never planned on playing any instruments<br>Kumiko: Then why did you join the club?<br>Mizore: Because Nozomi invited me<br> Mizore lowers her eyes, as if she was trying to run from something <br>Mizore: I’m... afraid of talking with people. My personality is depressing, I never had any friends in middle, I was always alone. But, Nozomi talked to me. “Lets play instruments together” she said. So then, my life changed. Being with Nozomi was fun.<br> Mizore wraps her arms around herself tighter, her nails digging into her arms. Kumiko feels like there’s a transparent wall between the two of them <br>Mizore: Nozomi is special. She’s my dearest friend.<br> But says Mizore. Kumiko notices there’s a bit of red mixed into Mizore’s black eyes <br>Mizore: No that’s wrong. What Nozomi means to me and what I mean to Nozomi are completely different things. To me, Nozomi is my number one best friend. But to Nozomi, I’m just another one of her friends. Nozomi has lots of friends, I’m just one of them. It’d be the same if I wasn’t around.<br>Kumiko: T-that’s not true. Just recently, Nozomi senpai was worried about you Mizore senpai, and there’s....<br>Mizore: But when she quit the club, she didnt say anything to moe<br>Mizore: Even though she she asked everyone else. It was just like that in band. I didn’t know anything. When I asked another senpai “Is Nozomi taking a day off from club today”, I was told that she quit the club. That’s how I found out. It was a shock. Extreme. I mean, that means our relationship wasn’t worth enough to tell me these things.<br> Kumiko scrambles to find the words to say even though they don’t exist. Time passes but Kumiko still cannot respond </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I also joined the highschool Wind Ensemble club because Nozomi invited me. She and I are different types of people, so I thought if we didn’t have the club between us, our relationship would end right there. But in the end Nozomi quit. I don’t understand why I’m still in the club though. I really don’t know.<br>Kumiko: B-but! Senpai, you come earlier than anyone to practice. It’s because you love to play right?<br>Mizore: I was afraid<br>Kumiko: huh?<br>Mizore: That if I don’t play, Nozomi wouldn’t need me as a friend. This instrument is the only thing that connects me and Nozomi. This is all I have. I don’t have anything else. If I can’t play well, Nozomi will think I’m useless. That’s why. That’s why I play.<br> Kumiko is now at a loss for words. This is the first time Kumiko has ever met a person who plays for such a reason. People play to get good results at competitions or to be cool (Reina I’m looking at you). Kumiko thinks that the reason she and Mizore play are much too different. That if we’re all aiming for Nationals, this isn’t a time to be thinking about friendship. <br>Mizore: I’m... afraid of seeing Nozomi. Nozomi probably doesn’t think anything of this. She hasn’t done anything wrong. She thinks that just leaving the club like that on a whim wasn’t the wrong thing to do. But I’m afraid of coming face to face with this reality. I’m afraid of being stabbed with the fact that I’m not anything important to her.<br> Mizore covers her face again and groans <br>Mizore: It’s disgusting. To be obsessed with a friend this way.<br>Kumiko: It isn’t<br>Mizore: I think it’s disgusting. I think I’m disgusting<br> Mizore buries her face into her lap, her hair covering her face completely </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I wish competitions would disappear. If that would happen, then Nozomi wouldn’t have disappeared. She wouldn’t have cried over not being able to accept what happened with our results. It’s idiotic. How everyone is so obsessed with this stuff. No matter how much you try, there’s nothing fun. There’s nothing left. Just the feeling of pain.<br>  The door slams open. I’ve been looking all over for you says a voice from the doorway. Kumiko turns around. Standing in the doorway is Yuuko, covered in sweat, her hair a mess. Kumiko wonders how many times Yuuko must’ve ran around the school considered she started on the fourth floor. Yuuko walks quickly towards Mizore, brushing her uphevealed bangs to the side. Kumiko takes a step back from the intensity and even Mizore shrieks a little bit. Yuuko puts both her hands on Mizore’s shoulders. <br>Yuuko: What the hell are you doing!? I’ve been so worried<br> Mizore taken back by that says she’s sorry. Yuuko takes deep breath <br>Yuuko: What did Nozomi say to you?<br>Mizore: Nothing, she just came to give me advice<br> I just got scared on my own replies Mizore. Mizore looks down. Yuuko takes her hands off Mizore’s shoulders and holds her hands. Yuuko gently squeezes them and tells Mizore to look. <br>Yuuko: Are you still afraid of talking to Nozomi?<br> Mizore nods <br>Mizore: after all, Nozomi is all I have. If she’s not around, I can’t do anything. That’s why I’m afraid of being rejected.<br> Yuuko stops holding Mizore’s hands and then Mizore’s eyes frightenly shuts her eyes. Yuuko takes a deep breath and then claps Mizore’s cheeks together with both her hands  <br>Yuuko: Idiot<br> Mizore timidly opens her eyes and looks at Yuuko. Mizore’s eyes are suddenly overflowing with emotion, turning pink like her cheeks which are pressed between Yuuko’s hands </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: Hey, is Nozomi really your only friend? Just because she was the first person to rescue you, that makes her a special friend to you? Does that mean everyone else means nothing to you?<br>Mizore: That’s not it...<br>Yuuko: What about me? What am I to you?<br> the sun is setting, the lights in the room falling.  <br>Mizore: Yuuko, you’re only being nice to me because you think I’m pathetic right? Nozomi left me, so you thought I was pitiful by myself. You were just pitying me. Right?<br> Mizore turns her eyes away immediately as she says that. Like if she was actually asking that to herself and not to Yuuko, thought Kumiko. Yuuko takes her hands off Mizore’s cheeks and instantly pulls both of Mizore’s ears. Yuuko shouts, point blank to Mizore’s face <br>Yuuko: ARE YOU AN IDIOT? You really are an idiot. Will you cut this crap out already?<br>Mizore:...that hurts<br> Mizore mumbles that as a response to having her ears pulled like that but Yuuko ignores her <br>Yuuko: I wouldn’t think of hanging out with someone I didn’t like just because I felt like it. I wouldn’t be able to do something like that. Pity, what is that supposed to mean? Don’t you think of me as your friend?<br>Mizore: It’s not that. But...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: Club is like that too. Are you really only still playing for Nozomi’s sake? Have you never had any fun or felt happy? Didnt you feel the pain of competition? What about the Kyoto tournament? When it was decided we made it to Kansai, weren’t you happy?<br> I was happy says Mizore, straining her voice to the point of losing her breath. It seems that Yuuko’s passionate words has finally gotten through to Mizore thinks Kumiko. <br>Yuuko: I was happy we got this far. That our effort didn’t go to waste. That our hard work paid off. I was finally able to think that. I felt like we were finally able to escape from our memories of middle school. Don’t you think so Mizore too? Didn’t you feel anything?<br> Mizore shuts her mouth and grips the hem of Yuuko’s uniform. Then Mizore spits out <br>Mizore:.... I was happy. I really was. But at the same time, I feel guilty about the people who quit. Is it okay to be happy?<br>Yuuko: of course it is.<br>  replies Yuuko immediately <br>Yuuko: Of course it’s okay to be happy about something like that. There isn’t anyone in the world who would want you to be sad. At the very least, I don’t want you to be sad. So smile.<br> Embracing those words, Mizore takes a deep breath. Her lips are quivering as she bites down onto them. Large tears start to flow down her face. Yuuko spreads her arms and Mizore buries her face in Yuuko’s shoulders, and starts crying outloud. <br>Yuuko:.... hey<br> after some time, Mizore’s tears have finally stopped. Kumiko who has been standing there watching this whole thing wonders if she’s being a bother. Taking notice to that, Yuuko turns to Kumiko and says <br>Yuuko: It seems like Mizore’s calmed down so can you call the people who are waiting outside?<br> As Yuuko says that, Kumiko looks to the door to see that they have been peeping on them from the crack. Kumiko slides it open <br>Kumiko: What’re you two doing?<br> Natsuki and Nozomi both look at eachother with a “we’re busted” expression. Nozomi is hugging Mizore’s oboe case. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nozomi: Ah..... Asuka told me to bring this<br> Nozomi walks into the room. Natsuki worriedly looks at Kumiko as Natsuki doesn’t know what has happened just yet. Nozomi walks up to Mizore and looks at her. Mizore rubs her eyes, which are still red and swollen <br>Nozomi: Mizore, did I do something bad to you? I can’t think of anything I might’ve done though<br> Mizore holds onto Yuuko’s arm. Yuuko takes a deep breath and takes Mizore’s hand off of her and pulls Mizore onto her feet. <br>Yuuko: Talk to her about it<br>Mizore: Huh? But...<br>Yuuko: It’ll be okay, I’m here with you<br> Yuuko walks Mizore to Nozomi, Mizore holds onto Yuuko’s uniform <br>Mizore: No-Nozomi, why didn’t you tell me to come with you?<br>Nozomi: Come with me when?<br>Mizore: When you quit the club<br>Nozomi: That’s because I didn’t have a reason to tell you to<br>Mizore......why didn’t you?<br>Nozomi: Well because you were always trying to hard in club. Even when I became a bad apple, you were always practicing. Even when there wasn’t anyone to praise you for it, even when nobody else was practicing with you, you were always diligently practicing by yourself. So why would I tell you to quit the club? That would be an insult to all the work you’ve put into playing<br> Mizore’eyes flicker with relief. Mizore lets go of Yuuko’s uniform. <br>Mizore: So that’s why you didn’t say anything?<br>Nozomi: Hrm? Well yeah<br> Nozomi also has relief written on her face <br>Nozomi: Don’t tell me that I made you feel left out because of that. It’s not like that at all. I would never hate you, ever. I’m sorry, this was a misunderstanding.<br> The flustered voice of Nozomi is both light and beautiful. Kumiko thinks the difference in their personalities, Nozomi being hot and Mizore being cold, is why Nozomi can be this innocent around Mizore. I’m sorry I didn’t realize this says Nozomi. It’s fine says Mizore.  <br>Mizore: There wasn’t a misunderstanding<br>Nozomi: You sure? I didn’t do anything awful?<br>Mizore: mhm. It’s fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi shouts out happily. Kumiko looks a bit down, wondering if Mizore is going to keep her feelings about Nozomi to herself. Nozomi then says shly says to Mizore <br>Nozomi: You know, I actually went to the Kyoto Tournament to see you play<br>Mizore: You did?<br>Nozomi: Yep. And there, I was so jealous. Everyone was so radiant. Your solo was so cool too.<br>Mizore:.... really?<br> Mizore looks to the case in Nozomi’s hand and with a smile on her face Nozomi waves it by the handle to Mizore  <br>Nozomi: It really was, why would I lie about it? I’ve always loved the sound of your oboe, since middle school. How should it put it... just by listening to you play, my heart starts pounding. It’s like I’m the one who is having fun.<br>Mizore: Do you really think that?<br>Nozomi: I do. That’s why I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s performance at the competition too. You might be in a bit of a slump right now but if it’s you Mizore, I just know you’ll be able to pull off a great performance.<br> Nozomi hands Mizore her case. Mizore hugs her oboe case tightly. Without trying to hide how red her cheeks are, Mizore looks straight at Nozomi <br>Mizore: If it’s fine with you, would you like to practice with me? I want you to listen to my solo<br>Nozomi: Do you even need to ask?<br> Upon hearing that, Mizore bursts into a smile. Kumiko gets caught up in the moment and smiles too. These two are going to be fine from now on thinks Kumiko. Suddenly, Yuuko grabs Kumiko and is drags both her and Natsuki out of the room. Natsuki is not okay with being dragged by Yuuko though. <br>Yuuko: Well then Mizore, you can go home ahead without us<br> Mizore nods and Nozomi waves bye without shifting her attention from Mizore. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuuko: You two should really be able to read the mood when something like that happens. You two need to pay attention.<br>Natsuki: Here she goes again! Trying to show off how more mature and caring she is at worrying about other people!<br>Yuuko: Huh? Natsuki, you picking a fight?<br>Natsuki: Not really picking anything. I was just thinking that just this reminds me of something<br>Yuuko: Uwah, what are you even trying to say? I’ve been thinking this for a while but isn’t the attitude you have towards me too rude?<br>Natsuki: Can’t be helped, you make me feel irritated<br>Yuuko: That’s absurd! No way!<br> Looks like things are back to normal between them thinks Kumiko as she keeps walking away noticing how dark it’s gotten outside <br>Yuuko: ah<br> Everyone turns around and stops talking. A familiar sound fills the air. It’s the sound of Mizore’s oboe. The echoing of her notes down the hallway sound divine.  <br>Natsuki: Is this, Mizore?<br>Yuuko: It’s beautiful isn’t it. Mizore can play like this.<br> Yuuko looks down the hallway <br>Yuuko: In the end, Mizore was always playing for Nozomi’s sake.<br> Yuuko grips her skirts <br>Yuuko: To be honest, Nozomi really pisses me off<br>Natsuki: Why?<br> Natsuki looks at Yuuko with amazement. It’s not often that Yuuko is honest with herself. <br>Yuuko: Think about it, even though Mizore was going through all that pain, Nozomi didn’t realize a thing. Mizore has been always worried about it since Nozomi quit the club. Look at what just happened before, when a friend starts running, shouldn’t you be chasing after them? It isn’t time to just be standing dumbfounded in the hallway like that.<br>Natsuki: So that’s why you grabbed Nozomi? You really are short tempered<br>Yuuko: That’s just the kind of person I am<br>Natsuki: Well it would be kind of gross if you were to suddenly become a good girl<br>Yuuko: Uwah, what are you saying? I’m already a good girl.<br>Natsuki: is that how it is?<br> Natsuki breaks out in laughter as she teases Yuuko but Yuuko shrugs her shoulders. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: In the end, I couldn’t win against Nozomi. Even though we were together for a whole year. Even then, Mizore’s most important person was still Nozomi.<br>Natsuki: Well that can’t be helped, Nozomi’s a 100 times nicer girl than you are.<br> Yuuko shrugs even more <br>Yuuko: You don’t need to say it, I already know that<br>Natsuki: But you know<br> Natsuki turns away from Yuuko <br>Natsuki: I think Mizore was glad you were around Yuuko. If you weren’t, I think Mizore would’ve fallen apart sooner. Probably.<br> Yuuko is at a loss for words and then suddenly changes to a mischievous smile. Without trying to hide how flustered she is, Yuuko moves sneakily behind Natsuki and starts poking her. <br>Yuuko: What’s that? Are you trying to comfort me or something?<br>Natsuki: Haa? No that’s not it<br>Yuuko: Not being very honest are you. You’re always so rude to me, but you really love me don’t you?<br>Natsuki: Ugh, you’re so annoying. What’s with you.<br>Yuuko: ahh, okay okay. It’s fine to be embarassed<br>Natsuki: Annoying, so annoying!<br> Yuuko laughs at Natsuki with a pleasant smile on her face while Natsuki is quite openly disgusted. Kumiko leaves those two alone and walks away with a smile spilling out of her face towards the music room. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kumiko returns to the music room to find that everyone has left except for Asuka<br><br>Asuka: Kumiko chan, good work<br>Kumiko: Senpai, were you waiting?<br>Asuka: Well I guess<br> Asuka looks out of the room to see Natsuki and Yuuko still bantering <br>Asuka: Ahh, we should just leave those two alone for now. So, how did it go? Did Mizore and Nozomi make up?<br>Kumiko: Yes, more or less<br>Asuka: Is that right? Well then good<br> Asuka sighs with relief. Kumiko asks Asuka <br>Kumiko: The one who told Nozomi senpai to bring the oboe case was you right? Why did you do that?<br>Asuka: Hrm? Well, simply put, this was the only chance for them to make up.<br>Kumiko: I see<br>Asuka: I was planning to keep Mizore chan and Nozomi chan apart until after the competition was over though. But since that plan got blown apart in the music room, I had to do something about it right?. So that’s why I decided to do things directly. It’s called shock therapy.<br> In the end, everything was okay! says Asuka with a fearsome smile. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka: Well, the MVP for this time was Yuuko. If she wasn’t around, things wouldn’t have gone so well<br>Kumiko: Yuuko senpai, she’s always been worried about Mizore-senpai<br>Asuka: Well, there’s that but Mizore-chan is just a very dishonest person<br>Kumiko: Dishonest? What do you mean?<br>Asuka: The reason why Mizore chan is so insistent on Nozomi chan is because she’s actually just afraid of being alone. That’s why she would’ve just realized that she had Yuuko by her side, she would’ve been able to face Nozomi-chan like she just did now. Even if Nozomi-chan rejects her, as long as she has Yuuko, she won’t be alone. Well, to Mizore chan, Yuuko would basically be a back up I suppose.<br> Kumiko is at a loss for words, and honestly quite offended with Asuka just said. What Asuka is saying isn’t right thinks Kumiko. <br>Kumiko:.... Mizore senpai isn’t that kind of person.<br>Asuka: You sure? I think people’s actions are decided by calculations though. But if you don’t open your eyes you won’t realize this.<br>Kumiko: You’re just too shrewd<br> Asuka just laughs at what Kumiko says. Kumiko wonders what Asuka must see in the world to think this way and how scary it must be.  <br>Kumiko: So can Nozomi senpai come back to the club?<br>Asuka: Well, yeah. There’s no reason to stop her anymore.<br>Kumiko: That’s great<br> From behind somebody calls Kumiko’s name <br>Reina: Kumiko, let’s go home <br>Asuka: Looks like it’s time for us to both go then<br>Kumiko: Ah, okay<br>Asuka: Let’s do our best at tomorrow’s performance<br> <br>Also if anyone read my earlier spoilers, I made a mistake when I wrote that Nozomi wasn’t allowed to come back to the club until next year just in case. That’s what I get for writing things from memory at 5am. Nozomi is back in the club she just isn’t allowed into the A-team* until next year because reasons and stuff. She and Natsuki practice together in the B-team throughout volume 3. I was wondering why Nozomi was still around in club when I re-read volume 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Final Nozomi Mizore scene for the volume go! <br>Everyone is standing around, getting ready to go on stage and perform. <br><br>Nozomi: Mizore<br> Mizore turns around to see Mizore whispering her name. Nozomi starts to walk towards Mizore with a music sheet in her hand. Nozomi’s hair which is usually in a ponytail is in a wave perm today. <br>Nozomi: Good luck on the solo<br>Mizore:.....Okay <br> Mizore blows lightly into her oboe <br>Mizore: I play for your sake Nozomi, so I want you to listen<br>Nozomi: Got it<br> Nozomi says with a smile. She starts to pat Mizore on the head, her fingers running through her hair <br>Nozomi: I’m looking foward to it<br>Mizomi: Yeah<br> Unlimited budget works ten page long performance intensifies with a wonderful oboe solo. Extremely narrow gold victory secured because the story can’t end here in volume 2. Another huge ass trophey for Asuka and Haruka to carry because they don’t enough enough trophies. <br>  Kumiko finds Mizore after the celebration and asks her <br>Kumiko: Senpai, do you still hate competitions?<br>Mizore: Just now fell in love with them<br> Mizore smiles, Kumiko thinks that this is the first time she’s ever seen Mizore this happy before. <br><br>Volume 2 ends on this line<br><br>And that's about it. S2 one day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you so much. Please marry me.</br>  While reading<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fme<wbr>7g41lzEg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I know this has little do with Mizore and Nozomi, but how does Reina get her smile back?</br>  Hajimari no Senritsu actually is a part of Crescent Moon Dance  <br>Not that anon, but you don't story time a novel. You translate it and post a link.</br>  <br>well Reina loses her smile when she meets Niiyama sensei. She's like a sexy female Taki sensei who is a professional flute player. And Taki sensei is pretty fond of her because Niiyama is his kouhai from college.<br><br> Taki: For today and tomorrow, Niiyama Satomi sensei will be in charge of directing the woodwind section. She will also help direct the woodwind section after the training camp. <br> Taki: Tomorrow, Hashimoto sensei will also come to direct the percussion section. <br> Taki: The woodwind section will practice in the second hall, percussion and brass will be practicing here. Niiyama sensei might young but she is is extremely talented. Make sure to follow her orders. <br> Niiyama smiled shyly in response to what Taki sensei said <br> Niiyama: Extremely talented? You're not getting anything from flattering me you know <br> Taki: of course not, but I am only saying what is true <br> Niiyama: oh my, well I'm happy to hear that then Taki sensei <br> the club members watched with a cool gaze as the gorgeous couple in front of them scattered an air of freshness. <br> Curious as to what Reina was thinking, Kumiko turned her head to the trumpet section. Reina was watching the couple with eyes that greatly resembled a dead fish. <br><br>But she gets it back later when Kumiko finds out that  Niiyama sensei is married </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn, if they make a second season it's gonna be filled with Yuri.<br>Gotta make you wonder why they'd go for Reina and Kumiko this season when they have the least potential.</br>  <br>Thank you so much. Nozomi is now my favorite girl, god she's such a goof ball and hotheaded idiot but like her. Also the Natsuki/Yuuko parts were intense and adorable.</br>  <br><br>I want Reina yandere moments next season.</br></br>  I want more added Yuuko/Natsuki bantering. they are epic.  <br>Kumiko is a good friend</br>  <br>this scene happens after dinner at band camp. Ribbon is wearing a fluffy parka and short pants and then suddenly Natsuki out of nowhere<br><br>Natsuki: Whats with that outfit? Why'd you choose that?<br>Yuuko: I don't want to hear that from someone wearing such a shitty t-shirt with a lame design<br>Natsuki is wearing a black t-shirt under her track suit<br>Natsuki: What's lame about my shirt?<br>Yuuko: That english on your shirt, it says "I am addicted to cement"<br>Natsuki: Look who's talking, that frilly logo on your pocket says "my staple food is love"<br>Yuuko: Stop speaking in english! This is Japan!<br>Natsuki: Aren't you the one who brought this up?<br>Yuuko: Shut up. What's that, is it possible that you want to care about me?<br>Yuukoi: ugh, you're so creepy. I get goosebumps when you say weird stuff like that<br>Yuuko: That's it! It's time for another showdown!<br>Natsuki: ah, okay okay, You haven't learned your lesson yet from every other loss though.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128288265#p128290612">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?  <br>I wouldn't mind if she looked like OP's pic as long as they show she is fit, and full of muscles.</br>  Thread full of Madhouse faggots crying over it not being a 1:1 panel reproduction.  <br>Fuck off back to your Love Live containment thread</br>  <br>wakarimasen</br>  <br>It's funny because madhouse adaptations are garbage most of the time (cough parasyte cough)</br>  Post your favorite tankobon cover art.        <br>TOGASHIIIIIIII</br>      <br>You.

Actually almost every Yotsuba&amp;! covers are my favorite. But this one takes the cake I guess.      such a mischievous and playful cover, I love it.  <br><br><br>Do you?</br></br></br>      <br>yes, which is why the allusion to the actual painting isn't indicative of Pitou's gender - of which whose gender isn't the point of its character's importance.</br>  Such an amazing cover art.  <br>Based Velazquez</br>  <br>the tankobon art alone certainly isn't indicative of pitou being female, but it sure does add to the case.</br>  <br>only if you're desperate enough to use confirmation bias and moreover if there is even a case to be fought over - Pitou's gender is inconsequential because it's intentionally ambiguous. Togashi operates a certain way for a reason.</br>        <br>Except it's completely logical inference to make given the visual and metaphorical cues Togashi released over the course of things. Ambiguity is just that, ambiguity, not a complete lack of gender. And Pitou was most certainly "gendered", extending a motherly love to Meruem, which is only reinforced my the mother cat and Virgin Mary imagery.</br>  <br>This</br>    <br>This one is my favorite.

So fucking CUTE.</br>  <br>It ended anon<br>but if you want it to note it down for next week<br>http://www.ustream.tv/channel/galax<wbr>y9000</wbr></br></br></br>  can someone explain the deal with doffy's eyes? did they got shot out/scarred or something?  <br><br>Who was doing the cutting?</br></br>  <br>Usopp with his plants.</br>  <br>i don't think anyone knows, anon. maybe oda just wants to hide his face forever. or maybe it'll be something like Sanji's eye, which we eventually got to see after a long while.</br>  <br>you idiot, im talking about a working link to a subbed episode..watchop is down..omfg people these days</br>  <br>you kind of have to be looking for it to find it so its not surprising you've never seen it<br><br> but also im a loser who still digs janky MMDs<br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ste<wbr>2AMXUOng</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br> omfg people these days <br>Not him but fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I definitely wouldn't put it past Oda to explain it with some shit like this in an SBS.<br><br>Wouldn't really bother me at all either tbh</br></br></br>  <br>You mean when Whitebeard was almost dead with a hole in his chest and half his skull missing?</br>  Best  slut   <br>I do watch MMDs. LawLu MMDs are cute. I just drown in it. Searching for the Donquixote family didn't cross my mind. I should look for more. Thank you, anon!</br>  <br> thinks im a retard <br> uses tumblr </br></br>  <br> baww why aren't you spoonfeeding me </br>  <br>Fucking lewd.</br>  <br>Did you draw that just now?<br><br>Also, we still don't know Machvise's power.</br></br></br>  <br>nah, I think that picture first surfaced way back when we first saw Trebol's real body</br>  <br>not that person and you may not realize this but that pic you posted is from a tumblr photoset</br>  <br>The lewdest.</br>  Roci's name being deep as hell makes sense, Doffy's voice is also really fucking deep.<br><br>In fact, I never would have imagined Doffy's voice as deep as it is from the manga, and it took me a lot to get used to it. His casting reminds me of older anime.</br></br>  <br>I got this off 4chan, so im still not a tumblr retard</br>  <br>Doffy's animu voice bothers me because his laugh is different from the mango</br>  <br><br>Hehe he's right now that I pay attention to it.<br>Look at the top right of your pic. It's watermarked. Moreover I'm pretty sure tumblr's gif limit used to be 500KB.</br></br></br>  <br>refer to what I said here<br/></br>  <br> I got this off 4chan <br>yes, from a tumblr user<br><br>the lesson here being, you cant exactly call someone out for using tumblr images when you dont know what they look like yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>1 of 2 rebutting you.</br>  <br>no it's not. Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example.</br>  <br> i'm not a tumblr retard, I'm just ignorant <br>Whatever makes you sleep better at night.</br></br>  <br>2 of 2</br>  <br>ok, I was just making shitty excuses, but my point stands tumblr is a shithole</br>  <br> tumblr is a shithole <br>while that's true, so is 4chan. Non-imagedump boards specifically<br><br>it's kind of a pot/kettle thing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off bitch.<br><br>Anyone care to give me the one piece 703 sub link?</br></br></br>  Anyone else notice that Oda sometimes seems more interested in the world than the characters these days? Since the timeskip it feels like there's been an up kick in flashbacks related to things like the history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, and fights going to members of the supporting cast that would've gone to a Straw Hat in any other arc.<br><br>There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions. I'm not sure I like this.</br></br>  <br>No, now fuck off.<br>If you can't find it by yourself, then you have nothing to do here.</br></br>  <br>I like the focus, but I also dislike that there's no focus on the straw hats. It's an exchange of sorts, the good overrides the bad, but I still wish we get more of the crew next arc.</br>  <br> Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example. <br>Do it's not you uncultured swine. Doffy's laugh is ffuffuffu, it has the sokuon while the generic onomatopoeia doesn't.</br></br>  <br>*No<br>Can't type tonight</br></br>  <br>https://www.google.co.uk/</br>  <br> .co.uk </br>  <br> since the time skip <br>Did the anime skip flashbacks, side stories, history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, because the manga has constantly had them pre skip too.</br></br>  <br> There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions <br>That's exactly what they were though, it wasn't an impression. Law was, technically, the protagonist of this arc. He was the one who underwent the most conflict, he was the one who suffered the most, he was the one who got everything into motion because he was the one with the objective to kill Doffy and the motivation to do so in the first place. <br>Luffy by comparison ? He got his lunch from Rebecca. He was a side character. A side character who saved Law's ass and finished Doffy for good, but a side character none the less.</br></br></br>  <br> What are they even planning to do once they catch up <br>cant ever happen, they always go 1 chapter = 1 episode format. and sometimes, half a chapter to compensate for the oda breaks.</br></br>  <br>I said they seem to have increased, not that they weren't there. Skypiea in particular had a lot of that.</br>  <br>Yes it is, and i'm the faggot that posted that link</br>  <br>Yea I'm saying you're wrong though. There were more flashbacks per volume in the early story than the later.<br>Back then there was also more side story focus, though that's harder to count.</br></br>  <br>I'm going to miss him so much</br>  <br>why dont they just do a long filler arc ala bleach?<br><br>theres plenty of cover stories, even epecially important ones like jimbei's</br></br></br>  <br>Cover stories aren't THAT important though, after the characters reappear we get all the info necessary, in the end it's something to have fun weekly. Except for maybe the strawhat training ones before the timeskip.</br>  <br>Flamingo babies cute as fuck</br>  A previous iteration of this thread made me realize Hody was stronger than Lucci. I'm still kind of floored by that.  <br> Hody was stronger than Lucci <br>My brain refuses to accept this for some reason.</br></br>  Why Doffy's mom lost her blush in poverty?<br><br>Post Doffy mom.</br></br>  <br>My brain did for a while too, but the argument was since the pills supposedly double your power each time, Hody would have to be weaker than an ordinary civilian Fishman at base for his super form to be above Lucci.</br>  <br><br><br>He may have been stronger than PTS Lucci, but remember the guy isn't dead. Also, Doriki isn't really a good way to measure Lucci's strength, it only measured his physical strength as a human, no DF or Rokushiki power ups.</br></br></br>  <br> toei removed the scene where he was shirtless and bandaging himself up <br><br>Too lewd or do they just hate everything good</br></br></br>  <br>Not even in your dreams</br>  <br>Yeah, post-TS Lucci will certainly be stronger.<br><br>It just made me realize I'd been VASTLY underselling the timeskip gains.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>how could this have even possibly been in question<br><br>do you actually read this manga? in what world could lucci take anything that luffy threw against hody? lucci got rekt by a fucking jet gattling - no armament included</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never in question that Hody was definitely tankier, but my thought was that since Lucci is faster and has a greater variety of techniques, he could pull a difficult win.</br>  <br><br> that since Lucci is faster <br><br>and where are you getting this from?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy defeated hody with his first attack jet stamp but he took steroids and recovered</br>  <br>its just hard to comprehend because of the different level of threat that each posed to luffy.<br><br>lucci was basically his equal at the time they were fighting and hody just got rekt. timeskip lucci would also likely wreck hody if his growth was anywhere near luffys</br></br></br>  <br>Lucci has Soru. Hody's just a big tank, but I'll admit he can throw water-bullets pretty well.</br>  Wait a sec...where is corazon post time skip?  <br><br>they arent talking about timeskip lucci - they are clearly talking about pre ts lucci<br><br>and it is fucking retarded to think that lucci would be anywhere near crackhead mode hody<br><br><br><br>the fight continued, stop talking about hodys strength as if it ended there - it does not matter how he got that strength - we are just talking about said strength compared to lucci<br><br>crackhead mode hody put up a fight against a timeskip luffy who trained with the first mate of gold roger - and tanked a good amount of his attacks AND broke his armament haki (which luffy admitted he needed to work on)<br><br>lucci fought a pre ts luffy and got out speeded by gear 2nd and out lasted<br><br>there is no comparison <br><br> b-but ts lucci... <br><br>no, that is not part of what those 2 idiots said</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What will happen to Bellamy?    <br>bones.</br>  <br>hopefully he'll make up with luffy and they'll go their seperate ways. but it kinda looks like he'll become the next nakama</br>  <br>Huh?<br><br>Post-timeskip, where is Donqixote Rocinante ?</br></br></br>  the episode showed one of doffy's eyes when he woke up<br><br>it was red</br></br>  Another weird fight I think about sometimes: post-TS Brook vs. pre-TS Jabra, the Tekkai expert. Could Brook break Tekkai? He did defeat a dragon whose skin was so tough that it ran face-first into a thick steel wall so hard the metal cracked, after all.  <br> a </br>  Threadly reminder that Sanji will die in a fascinating way.  <br> Throat cut by Anita Sarkeesian. </br>    <br>Marineford did something to Oda. The character interactions between the crew were fucking amazing in Sabaody, but in FI and PH they were pretty underwhelming. The part where they were going doing to FI was fun though.</br>  <br><br>wut u have to remember about brook is that his 'age' precedes rogers - hes literally the oldest pirate there is barring any other crazy df ability wank<br><br>he should have been able to shit on plenty of people way back then just because of his age factor in one piece power scaling <br><br>the issue is that he got turned into a sissyboy by moria and ryuuma abuse</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was still powerful but not as powerful as when he attacked Shanks.</br></br>  <br>he's older than anyone sure, but he's basically fodder that aged. his one piece old age boost turned him from fodder into decent strength<br><br><br>plus one piece doesnt actually have an age boost, young WB would shit all over the marines but old whitebeard couldn't, maybe its the sickness though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the body swapping shenanigans in Punk Hazard were fun.</br>   Dressrosa arc for 2 years <br> rocinante not seen the entire time <br>lmao oda you are a pos.<br>You could have atleast done rocinante,law and luffy vs doflamingo</br></br></br>  <br>he wasnt going all out against shanks. unless you think shanks has surpassed roger</br>   Law's flashback <br> one of the only opportunities where filler could work <br> Doffy and fucking Bellamy get more original scenes <br> they suddenly switch back to 1 chapter per episode pacing right as the flashback starts <br> it feels like it's going by even faster after fucking months of 10-12 pages per episode <br><br>Normally I can laugh at how bad Toei is but I'm genuinely sad now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You...you truly don't know</br>  <br>theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. they got inside knowledge from oda that hes joining so they spend more time on him<br><br>oh god i felt dirty writing that I hope it doesnt happen</br></br></br>  <br>By that point in time Whitebeard was already weaker than his prime</br>  <br>he's obviously baiting  i hope </br>  <br>If this isn't bait, you're almost as retarded as the Rebecca fag<br>  almost  </br></br>  <br>Even though I agree, he was still strong enough that it's absurd that three all out attacks to Blackbeard didn't even phase him beyond crying whereas Akainu had to flee.</br>  <br>Hody couldn't keep up with g2 luffy either, and he didn't tank any of luffys hits he took steroids that would make anyone even fodder recover instantly. Lucci put up a fight and nearly won hody got his ass kicked all over noah</br>  <br>i mean, this is basically how their first meeting is gonna go</br>  <br>And still the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>I'm an anime fag, but idc if u spoil it, why isnt he in the final fight?</br>  <br>Forgot pic.<br>Aces Fire Spears are very similar to a magma fist, anyone vulnerable to internal organ incineration should at minimum be defeated if directly hit by that unless they have a special first aid like Doffy. Just Crocodiles hook KOd Luffy.</br></br>    <br>hes dead, its already been said anyways. he is the younger brother that doffy kills.</br>  <br> theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. <br>How dare you make me read that with my own two eyes</br></br>  Posting this I found through a previous thread<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cir<wbr>LmTzDldk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>The reason this was possible is Brooke is a casual swordsman and a master musician.</br>  <br> young WB would shit all over the marines <br><br>Garp, Sengoku and Zephyr (all three) could defeat prime WB.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, no, Prime WB = Roger.</br>  <br>He was murdered in cold blood by Doflamingo for being a Marine informant.</br>  <br>You don't think 3 marine admirals could defeat Roger?</br>  <br>Oh, all at the same time, you mean? Not sure then.<br><br>Though 72-year-old, face-melted WB destroyed one Admiral.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but no they could not. Roger volunteered to be executed, don't forget.<br>At the end of One Piece Luffy might say about Smoker, "he cornered me many times" but all readers will know Luffy became overwhelmingly stronger as the story progressed.</br></br>  So /a/, post what your face would look like if, at the end of the series, another pirate crew beat the Straw Hats to the One Piece.    There are people that think Zoro can take Fujitora.    <br>I used to dislike the most recent One Piece op. It's grown on me and now I actually listen to it fully instead of skipping it.</br>  <br> MFW I realize some of those people are probably on this board </br>  <br>its hard to reason with the *insert character* fags. Just like that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks. They don't listen when you tell them why theyre wrong</br>  <br>I'm honestly amazed at all the wank that came out of Zoro pushing Fujitora back a few feet.</br>  <br>me too, i'm kind of hoping Fujitora wrecks Zoro's shit at some point just to laugh</br>  <br>since fuji's a swordsman does that mean that mihawk is above admiral level?<br><br>since shanks is a swordsman does that mean he's stronger than a yonko</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>How would Fujitora defeat Zoro?<br>With gravity? Zoro broke out easier than Shichibukai Law.<br>With swordsmanship?<br>There are people on this board who believe Fujitora would defeat Mihawk trained Zoro in swordsmanship?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora openly admitted he was dangerous.<br>Fuji may also be a junior admiral in some capacity, and not as strong as Kizaru or Akainu, since his appointment was urgent.</br></br>  <br> 128287090 <br>just because he trained with him doesnt mean he reached his level of skill</br></br>  <br>Mihawk is, IMO, the best "only" swordsman.<br><br>Fuji and Shanks have other powers as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks and Mihawk only dueled back when Shanks was a rookie or mid-level.<br><br>Shanks gave up any hope of being best swordsman when he lost his arm.</br></br></br>  <br> Survive the very same attack Fujitora used against fodder <br> Would totally trash an admiral guys believe me <br><br>Some people, some people.</br></br></br></br>  What ever happened to that chef guy? Wasn't there like a cook or something?  I'm of the opinion that Magellan is likely above all the Warlords, since corralling them should they go rogue is probably in his job description.  <br> hyperbole the post <br>I didn't say Zoro would easily defeat Fujitora, I asked how Fuji would beat him. Your answer so far is "but he's a admiral" and it is shit.</br></br>    <br>that can't be true, magellan and shiryu were said to be equals, and shiryu is a swordsman, meaning mihawk is stronger than him.</br>  <br> calling it Blind Justice because he is blind </br>  <br>Gravity, swordsmanship, haki, etc. Admirals are complete fighters, if Fujitora couldn't fill the shoes of the likes of Kuzan and Akainu, they might as well just promote any random VA, anyone who can read the flow of the story know it's too early for Zoro to be on the same stage as an Admiral, if you want real factual evidence you're in the wrong place discussing the wrong subject.</br>  <br> hyperbole the post <br>If you're going to meme then do it correctly. You claim Zoro can take Fuji but your only reasoning is "because I say so" and it's shit.</br></br>  <br> Law <br> Fodder <br>Don't you remember how Law had to wait till Fujitora was distracted, to use his op as fuck DF to escape?<br>Zoro felt the gravity and made Fujitora release it by attacking him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> read the flow of the story <br>It is 3 months to revery. Zoro trained under Mihawk for a longer period of time than his entire journey and all his fights on Luffys crew.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Fujitora the first person to make Zoro bleed since the timeskip?</br>  <br>I'd lol if Mihawk's only been the best since Shiliew was locked up.</br>  <br>I believe he was referring to when Fujitora made a giant hole in the restaurant.</br>  <br>But Law didn't want to go head to head with an admiral. His goal was Doffy and the factory and shit. <br>If he fights and admiral, which he probably wouldn't win regardless, he'd be trying to go up against Doffy. And he'd lose for sure.</br></br>  <br>Magellan was explicitly stated to be stronger than Shiliew (how do you think he beat him and locked him up in the first place?)</br>  <br>I'm not sure how that attack was weaker than what was used on Law, seeing as the hole is a representation of the force of gravity used.<br>I'm also not understanding how Zoro easily countering it proves Fuji would defeat him.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, Magellan wouldn't be the one to capture the warlords. The warlords will be restrained with Sea Stone anyways.<br><br>Mihawk is the only person I'd say Magellan would have a tough time against otherwise, but if he's ever captured he wouldn't have his swords with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ZoroSmiling.png </br>  <br> pretending there are lower levels in one piece </br>  <br> Zoro trained under Mihawk <br><br>So? He's not Mihawk yet, and probably not even close (Blame DB and it's shonen logic of real fighting &gt; training) Vista got the seal of approval of Mihawk and even then he was hopeless against Akainu, Kizaru was having the upper hand against the Dark King with only swordsmanship, that speak tons on Fujitora who's main weapon seems to be a sword, and even then he still have gravity. Sure as hell Zoro is no easy feat for anyone after TS, but on the grand scheme of things there are still both, stronger people and stronger swordsmen.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he'd have a very tough time against Mihawk and Kuma, but defeat all the rest handily. Probably easily in the case of Moriah, who was the weakest.</br>  <br> that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks <br><br>im positive that guy didnt give a shit about whether or not Kid could kill Shanks<br><br>Some people really do come here just to have someone to argue with</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The french guy? He left when he found himself a Suger Momma</br>  <br>She dumped him for Usopp though.</br>  <br> thinking I mean Violet </br>  <br><br><br>This is no DBZ, Shiryu presented the same treat as Magellan, but their fighting style is completely different, Magellan just needed to fill a room with poison for him to defeat Shiryu, and his ultimate poison made the use of swords quite useless too.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro "easily" broke though the same attack Fujitora used on some shitter pirates in a restaurant. I'm not seeing how Zoro can match up to him yet. You bring up Law was just shitty reading skills since he isn't fodder.</br>  <br>Funny enough, Moria would have the upper hand against Magellan compared to Mihawk, I don't see how poison could affect Doppelman, while Mihawk touching Magellan would still infect the sword and then Mihawk body.</br>  <br>presumeably armament haki can counter magellans poison otherwise he literally has to touch you to win<br><br>still not as op as sugar's touch to win</br></br></br>  <br>Did you read the start of Zoro's training? He defeated Human drills which had copied Mihawk's sword style. Mihawk assumed he had lost.<br>Fuji is based but he will still have to fight Zoro if he follows orders.<br><br>It is stated by Mihawk's that he ALWAYS imbues his blades with haki.<br>This means that at Baraty, Mihawk only won because Zoro did not have haki, resulting in 2 of his 3 swords being broken. The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki, it is why he accepted Zoro as his disciple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moriah is a hard character to quantify, really. He's explicitly the weakest Warlord (may or may not be counting Crocodile at that point, though), but he's mastered his Fruit to a degree not even many much stronger characters have.</br>  <br> shitty reading skills <br>Who has challenged Zoro as a swordsman post skip?<br>He immediately but Fujitora on the defensive.<br>Zoro is stronger than Law.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki <br><br>don't do this to you anon</br></br></br>  <br>If that was the case than there'd easily have been plenty of jailbreaks from ID, moreover you'd think the escapees like Jinbe and Croco-boy wouldn't even need to run from Magellan and just 1-hit him.<br><br>Has Oda ever confirmed if BnH means you don't make contact? Like if Luffy grabbed Akainu's magma fist, would he still feel the heat?</br></br></br>  so why did crocodile save ace and luffy (from akainu)?<br><br>was it cause he was getting back into the pirate spirit of "fuck the marines" or was he grateful to luffy for getting him his groove back<br><br>Do you think oda has plans for croc considering he showed up in the newspaper cora was reading? oda stated he was a big time rookie and had the same dream as luffy when he was younger, but then the defeat to WB crushed him. <br><br>He presumeably got a strength boost at marineford (fighting doffy, akainu, jozu, mihawk, alabasta luffy could not do that) because he got his "ambition" back. SInce he follows his dream again he is stronger</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The monkey imitating Mihawk was only in the anime, anyway.</br>  <br>Oh, Alabasta Croc was definitely way stronger than Alabasta Luffy.<br><br>Luffy attacked his weak point for massive damage.</br></br></br>  <br>I kinda hope but it would still be a stretch of what CoC truly is, an armor, and even in full armor you still have a human body beneath, Law stated there's simply no way to protect your body from the inside, so Magellan poison might as well be still a treat to Haki users.</br>  <br>Does anyone else feel like there's going to be tension within the SH crew? I really feel like Zoro has put in zero to no effort in every major fight thus far (while Luffy's gone balls to the wall) only for this to be a major point in the future. Regardless of what power-up Luffy is always hiding, it still stands that Luffy has gotten much more injured and collapsed after each fight (like Hody and Doffy), while Zoro is clearly fine each time. <br>Can we really expect to go for the entire latter half of One Piece without having any drama between the Straw Hats, like the whole deal with Usopp, Robin, even Nami way early on? And I'm not talking about potential future crew, I mean current crew (despite the whole "train for my captain!!" timeskip resolve).</br></br>  <br> Zoro is stronger than Law <br><br>pls stop</br></br></br>    <br> moving the goalpost from "real fighting." Look how Rayleigh trained Luffy. King Kong Punch in Gear 4 was needed to defeat the animals on the island he trained on. It was strong enough to KO Doffy. </br>  <br>Are you implying Zoro's ALREADY beaten Mihawk?<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!</br></br></br>    <br>One Piece Episode 702 - Nothing Happens</br>  <br>Just let him be, he believe anyone with sword is automatically below Zoro, I don't blame him thou, this is Oda's fault for spoon feeding Zoro since the TS.</br>  <br>I actually consider Pica a pretty difficult fight. Zoro had to ask for help, not once but twice.</br>  <br>one piece timeskip in a nutshell</br>  <br>I think any dissention will be coming from the new members. Which is maybe why Oda is introducing them at all<br><br>I doubt anyone current will have Usopp level issues at this point. Robin's already done, Franky has never had issues to begin with and Brook has already given himself to Luffy.<br><br>I can't imagine anyone earlier having something to get worked up over. With new member, we get the chance for clashes. Zoro with Kin'emon for obvious reasons, Jinbe with Nami(and therefore Sanji), Momonosuke with Luffy because D vs. 'celestial dragon' lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>now don't kid yourself, you may be a hardcore zorofag but you are right about some things, pica was an easy fight, the only "hard" part was transportation</br>  <br>Do you just make shit up to argue? I implied that Mihawk was capable of training Zoro up to fight an Admiral in 2 years if Zoro was capable of cutting steel 2 months into his pirate journey with only memories of a sensei.<br>Zoro won't lose a sword fight against anyone but Mihawk or above.</br></br>  <br>Chopper and Robin still haven't had their "Xth Person" chapters yet, just to note.<br><br>I speculate Chopper will get an offer from Kaido's crew as a powerful Zoan, and Robin will consider becoming a full-time Revolutionary.</br></br></br>  <br> therefore with sanji  <br><br>fucking whiteknight</br></br></br>  <br>he wont lose, WHEN HE ACTUALLY FIGHTS THEM<br><br>right now zoro would lose to fuji in an all out fight, which is why they wont have an all out fight, skirmishes at best.</br></br></br>  <br>Not the same guy.<br><br>I actually find Zoro quite boring, but I enjoyed his fight with Pica.<br><br>Monet fight sucked though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are just assuming would lose abased on a title "Admiral" and despite evidence that Zoro started the fight on equal footing.<br>vs Mr.1 zoro started "this guy is literally drilling my chest and can't be cut"</br></br>  <br>If you edit a toilet under Zoro it look like he taking a shit.</br>  <br>I'd always seen Oda to carve a marble statue and polish it over the years, not someone who'd put Zoro on pedestal and with a stainless steel plaque titled "Badass". <br>In fact, ever since Sanji's thing with Vergo and the difference between Luffy and Zoro's exertion and damage each battle, the space between the monster trio really feels like it's been rearranged and broadened. Makes me sad if this is just Fairy Tail levels of "muh husbando so cool" fanservice as opposed to foreshadowing or something.</br></br>  <br>I see what you did there</br>  <br>The Straw Hats do seem to be the crew with the smallest gap between the Captain and the next best guy.</br>  <br>It has been several years since the skip.</br>  Post some "oh shit" moments.  Doffy father isn't really a bad guy but he sure is naive.  <br>I was going to say that Luffy didn't lose a fight once until Croc, then I realized it's been longer since the timeskip started to now than the beginning of the manga to when Luffy first fought crocodile.</br>    <br>i think it's less Zoro getting special treatment and more Sanji becoming the butt monkey<br><br>that combined with way too many new characters being introduced, some of which may or may not be joining, is messing with the classic dynamic<br><br>Jinbe joining makes them a Monster Quad. Kin'emon gives Zoro someone new and more equal(sword vs sword) to fight with. Bellamy might be an interesting plaything for Sanji. It doesnt help that Sanji hasnt been seen for two years so Zoro gets more screentime so its hard to tell what's going to happen or really how their strengths are going to settle<br><br>Hell Sanji hasnt had a fair fight yet. He's either way stronger or being put up against Doffy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I also think it's entirely possible Franky's closer to Sanji than Sanji is to Zoro.    <br>every translation I see of this page is different. I have to wonder what weirdass wording Kuzan used<br><br> Pardon me, Buddy <br> Sorry Bro <br> Excuse me, Young Man </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's also incorrect.<br>Luffy lost to Buggy at Logue Town.<br>He was incapacitated by Arlong but rescued by Sanji as well.</br></br></br>  Was I the only guy that noticed Pandaman?<br><br>You guys even watch this shit?</br></br>    <br>oh shit, why was Gladius watching Luffy?</br>  <br>you think Sanji fell that far behind? They seemed on equal footing when they had their reunion fight on Sabaody</br>  <br>I think the first one sounds most appropriate, personally. The third could be viable but too formal maybe.</br>  <br>Sanji could at best tie Vergo, but Zoro defeated Pica, who was equal in rank. Maybe slightly weaker.</br>  <br>I wonder what roiding Lucci would be like</br>  <br>How strong even was Vergo though? All of his fights before Law OP's him were shit<br><br>I mean taking out Smoker isnt really a measure and all before that he fought fodder. Perhaps Vergo would have wrecked Zoro but we'll never know</br></br></br>  <br>Hina looks and awful lot like Bonney<br><br>Is it just the hair plus sameface?</br></br></br>  <br>Vergo and the other Seats were IMO even with a typical Vice Admiral.</br>    <br>Vergo WAS a vice admiral.</br>  <br> top hat <br> bow staff <br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for drawing the arrow sherlock</br>   Mr. Prince <br> Not a prince. </br>  LAW IS A "D."JUST LIKE LUFFY AND BLACKBEARD  <br> Law's sister was a D. too <br> yet she died crying like a little girl </br></br>  <br> Doflamingo getting beat up by Pandaman <br><br>Truly the worst childhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to forever ago?</br>  <br>I dont think that applies to children</br>  <br> implying she won't pull a Sabo </br>  <br>Do you only watch the anime?

I felt it with Tolstoy’s “War &amp; Peace”, got a glimpse of it in Dostoevsky’s “Crime &amp; Punishment” and got completely overwhelmed by it in Full Metal Daemon Muramasa. <br> From the authentic-sounding ancient Japanese prose, to a meticulously constructed alternate history of early 20th century and carefully researched martial arts of real samurai; you simply can’t make a story so vast and this profound unless you sacrifice majority of your life researching and contemplating the subject matter.  <br> Muramasa is a masterpiece, and it sends shivers down my spine just imagining what Narahara Ittetsu, a certified master of ancient Japanese martial arts and by no means a professional writer, had to go through to bring this grand work to life. <br><br> Note that this is all true. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I make her wear clothes.<br><br>And then I enjoy her suffering from being properly dressed.</br></br></br>  <br>Short selling them to bankruptcy.</br>  <br>What the fuck happened?</br>   you will never have an elf waifu <br> she is perfect in every way possible <br> she is ageless, and will always be young, nubile, healthy and supple </br></br>  <br>Sensual buttfucking.</br>  <br><br> implying she would give consent to you </br></br>  <br>I'm worried that if I had a son with an elf he would seduce her after I'm gone and she would end up forgetting about me.</br>  <br> Continuous poor quarterly results posted and so downgraded to "Sell" status by most market advisers.

Is it worth watching the 1st and 2nd movies or I can skip straight to the 3rd one?  None of it is worth watching, should have skipped PMMM in its entirety.  <br>series is god tier<br>movies just shit on it<br>stop now while you're ahead</br></br></br>  <br>Movies 1 and 2 are recaps. Skip to 3.</br>  <br><br> shitting on PMMM or Rebellion <br>Did you know that you're more mainstream than mainstream when you do this?</br></br></br>  <br>Third movie is shitty fanfiction, don't bother.</br>  <br>Don't watch any of the movies. The series is fine by itself, you'll just be wasting your time.</br>  Third movie is the best part of the series, proceed  <br>The first two movies are literally just a compilation of the entire TV series so no, you don't have to watch them.</br>  <br>this</br>   Rebellion is hated on Reddit <br> Rebellion is loved on MAL <br><br>Oh no, what are /a/ hipsters to do?</br></br></br>  <br>Skip straight to the 3rd one.</br>  <br>Ignore what ridiculous Rebellion haters say.<br><br>Rebellion is the TV series' sequel respectively. Proceed.</br></br></br>  <br>rebellion is visually so spectacular that it would be remiss not to watch it.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6P4<wbr>9pNzDiq0</wbr>  [ ]<br>It sure is.</br></br>  <br>It's worth watching it all.</br>  <br>more like it's a clusterfuck of meaningless visuals</br>  <br>Not rhe same anon, but you can't seriously think that right? This isn't like eva, where the Christianity just was shoved in, each and every piece of symbolism in rebellion is relevant to the story. I didn't like the story, but the symbolism was on fucking point.</br>  <br>Who told you it was alright to skip parts?</br>  <br> Being this dense <br>I didn't like the movie either but most of the visuals are very direct and easy to understand symbolism.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Agree with these guys. The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back.<br><br>And don't give me that meaningless "H-Homura's character development! She was left sad!!!" that's just the outcome of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched up to mami's death and dropped it. Figured there was no point watching it knowing her theme song would never play again</br>  <br>It does play again though.</br>  <br><br>And Mami's theme isn't the only one that is amazing.</br></br>  <br> there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>If there's a story that can be told, that is enough reason. There's no actual logical basis to rejecting a sequel just for being a sequel. <br><br>And there's no such thing as a 'perfect ending'. Nothing is above re-examination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty though.</br>  <br>The true answer is you can ski straight. But I would rather give it time and watch the movies later.</br>  <br>This. Based Homura. Leave now before more smoilers.</br>  <br>Don't watch the Rebellion Story. Read the Different Story instead.</br>  <br>You can skip the first two movies. But don't skip straight to the third movie. Give it a week or so.</br>  <br> yandere Mami <br>Kowaii</br></br>  <br>It's Candeloro talking.</br>  <br>The movie didn't have to be as shitty as it was. Felt they only had like 45 minutes worth of plot and needed to stretch it out somehow.<br><br>I prefer the manga version of Rebellion since it doesn't feel as flabby with filler.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally implode</br>  <br>Candeloro is just Mami after she's given up all hope.</br>  <br>Are the manga canon?</br>  <br>Well, you shouldn't consider anything beyond series and movies to be canon. Manga are done by Hanokage and not by Gen.</br>  <br>Yes, except when they aren't. <br><br>Different Story is canon while Homura's Revenge isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press released Homura's Revenge already?</br>  <br> different story is canon <br>As far as I would like, as long as there's no word from the creator of the original series, it cannot be considered canon.</br></br>  <br>What is this</br>  <br>It adapts a canon Drama CD and explicitly takes place in an alternate timeline from episode 10. It's canon enough and a good read. <br><br>Yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>The Butcher is part of the Magica Quartet, right? So if a manga says 'story by Magica Quartet' would it be considered canon?</br>   hurr canon <br>Who gives a shit, I hate you people, fuck you and the horses you respectively rode in on.</br>  <br>Fanfiction where Homura gets her revenge</br>  <br>upon whom</br>  <br>Kyubey.</br>  <br>What, again?</br>  <br>Yes. The only manga that's worse is Homura Tamura.<br><br> The life of a magical girl isn’t all fighting witches and collecting grief seeds. When they aren’t kicking butt, Homura Akemi and her friends face the same trials as normal high school girls! In this four-panel comedy, glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! </br></br></br>  I Just Watched the Third Movie today and I hated it ¬¬, the anime is good itself, you don,t need the movies  <br>Why is it bad? The revenge one I mean.</br>  <br>The worst part of the movies is the replacement BG in the morning sequence. The plates clearly have cherry tomatoes on them but the BG in the movies has these big beefsteak monsters on the same vine. I can't believe someone said "We had to rush these out the first time, let's do this right and fuck up the tomatoes."</br>  <br> glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! <br>They just don't give a shit anymore, do they?</br></br>  <br>The characters just feel like caricatures of themselves. Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami. <br><br>The actual plot of the manga is that Homura and Madoka remember the end of the TV series and decide to stop any tragedies from happening. The main conflict is that Kyubey also remembers and needs bitches to become witches.</br></br></br>  <br> Not having your own opinions <br> Not knowing Rebellion is   shit <br> Only yuri fags and homu lovers could enjoy the absolute trash that is rebellion.  </br></br></br>  <br>Suzune Magica is canon.</br>  <br>how<br>does<br>her<br>spine<br>work</br></br></br></br></br>  This is all you need to know about rebellion, if you liked this; you'll like rebellion, if you didn't you won't.      <br>It's magic.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  Good bye everyone.    <br>Sayaka-chaaaaan</br>  Half of Rebellion PN scanned. <br><br>Bored out of my mind.</br></br>  <br> Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami.  <br>Except there was nothing wrong with Mami and Kyouko. We already know that Mami's weakness came about because she was desperate not to be alone, and in Rebellion's dream world Mami has an artificial past of having been with Bebe for longer than she can remember, and having formed a team with the others. She has no reason to lose her head, in any sense of the phrase. Kyouko doesn't discuss her past but it's fair to assume that she has fake, saccharine memories like Mami up until her scenes with Homura cause her to remember her real past, and even then you have to remember that this Kyouko already had her conflict and resolution with Sayaka off-screen, before the events of the series ending. <br><br>Rebellion's characterization of the two is spot-on. <br> b-but muh despair! <br>It's like you didn't even watch the series ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Reddit</br>    <br> cause her to remember her real past <br>Did this even happen? The only other shown to recall something on her own was Mam, which presumably was followed by Nagisa dumping all the info on them as they got together to face Homulily.</br></br>  <br>Probably not entirely. Bits and pieces? This scene seems to show a Kyouko who remembers enough death in her life to be rather fed up with losing people close to her, and after this Kyouko seems more jaded and in line with her former self—her (lack of) reaction to Kyubey speaking sticks out to me.</br>      <br/>      What is the relationship between Mami and Bebe at the end of the movie? Were Bebe still living with Mami?  <br>Oriko Magica and The Different Story are definitely canon and also not shit. They also have stories that star the anime cast but focus more on Mami and Kyoko. <br> They take place in alternate timelines that Homura visited. <br><br>Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br>Kazumi Magica, Tart Magica, and Suzune Magica are side stories that don't really contradict the canon of the anime. Tart Magica is probably the best of the three. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are non-canon and are just fanservice for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> PMMM <br>It's like I'm actually on tumblr.<br><br><br>The term canon means what is true within a fictional setting. And the only way you can prove something is true is to support it with facts. There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in TDS. Thus you have no proof to support the fact the events from TDS are true in the same fictional setting as the anime/movies. You can Google the word canon to confirm the definition. Canon is about story narrative, which is why stories that don't connect in some way are not part of the same canon, and why everything is canon to itself. Also, just sharing characters and location is not enough to "connect" them, because in that case fan work would be canon as well.<br><br>If you want examples of series where side content is canon look at Nanoha or Raildex. Both of those stories have events that happened in side content referenced in the main setting.<br><br>Also note that TDS or the CD drama it's based on was not written by Gen, but Masaki Hiramatsu. A person who is not on the anime production staff.<br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Masaki_<wbr>Hiramatsu<br><br><br><br> if I like it it's canon <br>Do you keep realize how you never actually say why it's canon you just keep stating it?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa no longer henshin into Bebe. Nagisa is now Mami's daughter.</br>  <br>What about battle pentagram   it's all homura's dream  </br>  <br> if I like it it's canon <br>Works for me. It's not like this is /co/ where comics have defined canons.</br></br>  <br>We don't exactly know her relationship with Nagisa is but Nagisa's definitely her loli.</br>  <br>I'm really happy today because Rifyu is back. He posted a Umaru~n comic on pixiv.</br>   <br>Let me restate that Kazumi, Tart, and Suzune don't directly contradict the anime's canon but aren't tied to its plot either. <br><br>The Different Story and Oriko do take place in different timelines thanks to Homura shenanigans. <br><br>Madoka and Rebellion manga are a retelling of the events that occurred in the anime and movie. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is wrong with you? Apply the definition of canon to the events of Battle Pentagram and see if it comes out canon. You should be able to save this on your own.<br><br><br>I hope you realize I was making fun of you.<br>I don't know what you think canon is, but you clearly wrong. Because you seem think it's just something to shitpost about. What's canon is used when answering questions related to the series. The point of knowing what's canon is so that if a question arrives you use relevant information to answer it. Not something unrelated. Like trying to answer a question about the Book of Revelations with something that happened in Genesis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oriko did nothing wrong!</br>  <br>You're right. You sure did restate it. But you didn't add anything new or relevant.<br><br> don't directly contradict the anime's canon <br>You keep saying this like it's relevant. Did you even read what I wrong or good the word canon itself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Oriko and Different Story and so they're canon to me. Seems simple enough. Thanks anon. <br><br>You shouldn't have your panties in a bunch about what is part of the one true canon though.</br></br></br>  <br> so they're canon to me <br>It's like you can't even read.<br>What's the point of coming to a discussion board if you're not actually here to discuss anything, and only here to endless spew what you think (but can't prove) and then hope people praise you.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't think it's relevant when it comes to talking about the canon of fiction if stories set in the world directly contradict the source material or not? Please explain yourself.</br>  <br>Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true.</br>  <br>You're discussing even less. Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy, you instead need 'proof' of what canonical for some reason. Seems like you have a one track mind.</br>  <br>God damn, I hate you retards. You didn't even read what is the very first post I made.<br>Something JUST not contradicting doesn't make it canon, because by that logic near everything is canon.</br></br>  <br>Not contradicting canon of the anime and being set in the same world as the anime make the manga canon enough.</br>  <br> Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy <br>No, you fucking idiot. Jesus, go back to tumblr. No one gives a shit what you like. You are here to discuss the series itself, you are not here to talk about what you like. This is not your blog.<br><br> for some reason <br>READ the posts in front of you. ALL the way through.<br>I already explained why you need to know what's canon. So when having discussion about the topic you answer with relevant information.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br> Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true. <br><br>Yeah, same here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to ask. Are you legitimately brain dead? No, honest question. Because what you said was already specifically addressed.<br><br>For the good of the Earth, just kill yourself. You are clearly not smart enough to ever contribute anything of worth.</br></br></br>  <br> I already explained why you need to know what's canon <br>Okay, say why you NEED to what's canon again in seven words or less.</br></br>  <br>So you don't answer with irrelevant information.</br>  <br>You should calm down. That's just how canon works when it comes to anime and spin off manga. Your lack of powerlevel is showing.</br>  <br>I mostly agree with you. And just one question. Is Rebellion canon with your opinion? <br><br>There is nothing in the main story (TVA) that supports the events that took place in Rebellion. Just like TDS, the plot of Rebellion is one possible way that doesn't contradict to the setting of TVA.<br><br>You know who the creators were not important in the definition of canon right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your wrong because I say so <br> this is how it works because I say so <br>Again, the Earth is bad enough as it is. Do your part to clean it up. Think of the children.</br></br></br>  <br>That is seven words or less. Guess there's just nothing to discuss with a dumbass like you.</br>  <br>You have yet to prove me wrong.</br>  <br>Coming from the retard who can't even read.</br>  <br><br>samefag.</br></br>  <br> you didn't prove me wrong because I say so! <br>I recommend just over dosing on something. It's painless that way.<br><br>Because you are honestly stupid enough to think saying nothing other than "UR WRONG" proves you right. You didn't even address what I said in the first post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Insults are the crutch of the ignorant. And you're boring.</br>  <br><br>Mami is a mediocre character, every medium; I have enjoyable time reading Kyoko backstory.<br>But dropped Mami story because she´s extreme optimistic</br></br></br>  <br> blatantly claiming something is canon just because. <br><br>I want tumblr to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>What is there in your first post that even needs to be addressed?</br>  <br>I want reddit to leave.</br>  <br> opinion <br>No. Stop using words you don't understand.<br> everything is canon to itself <br>Read this part? Rebellion is a direct continuation. It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8 related to each other?"<br>Ether way. Homura's black wings state the events of Rebellion are to happen.<br><br>And TDS does contradict the anime. At multiple points.<br>First off, there is an after life even though Madoka had not contracted yet.<br>And there are more. But I have other retards to tell off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you think you are welcome here at all, tumblr? Also, don't take my posts that are going to be deleted by a tumblr mod who doesn't belong here either as proof you belong.<br><br>And when you are literally saying nothing at all, the best thing to do is insult you. Because it's the best means to point out your faults. If you don't like that negative words can be applied to you, then don't be negative.<br><br><br>How about the whole thing, fuckwit.<br><br>Or how about this. Link a single source anywhere that states your made up definition of canon is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rebellion is worth watching for eye candy alone.  <br> not opinion <br>Okay then what it is? Please state.<br>  <br> everything is canon to itself <br>So TDS is canon to itself, TVA also, and Rebellion. Okay. <br> direct continuation.  <br>A new concept here. What is direct continuation? Is it different to canon? Why can't you just call it canon? If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation?<br> It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8.. <br>No. You are trying to separating each episode in one completed anime. Your metaphor is wrong because if it's right, we now have to think each episodes are canon to themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>The cliffhanger.</br></br>  <br>Okay. I am not trying to ask any difficult stuff. Is Rebellion canon or not? Please answer with some reasoning.</br>  <br><br> I agree with what you say expect for for everything you said is wrong <br>I love retards like this.<br> A new concept here <br>No, it's not a new concept. It's just another word. Episode two a direct continuation of episode one. This isn't some mythical idea, it's just a term that means exactly what it's stated to be.<br> If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation? <br>No. Because it's not official. It's like you failed high school math and don't get that concept that not all rectangles are squares. Same thing here. To be canon something must be official, but not everything that's official must be canon.<br><br>And the full definition of canon was given in my very first post with all of its rules. Apply that to the event of Rebellion and if it fits then it's canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebellion is canon. <br><br>It is a direct sequel to the original series, by the same writer and animation studio.</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is American, thus she is best girl.<br><br>  She probably only wears the lewdest of American flag styled bra's and panties on the 4th of july </br></br></br>  <br>... this is a thing?<br><br>well, fuck.</br></br></br>    <br>What? Tamura is fun and a best. I think you just hate Homura focused things or something.</br>    So what's your favorite pairing? <br><br>Kyoko/Mami is my favorite.</br></br>  <br>Better question? What's your favorite past time?<br><br>Mine is treating the characters from Madoka like shit, using them to bait in Madoka threads, and being an all around asshole.<br><br>Oh wait, I just listed you're favorite past time.<br><br>Though, I could be wrong. You could be wholly innocent. If that's true you should have no issue trying to prove how you're not a scumbag who degrades and insults the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, the plot is really dull.</br>  <br>Mami / the trash</br>  <br>You sound mad, you should calm down and try to enjoy things.</br>  <br>You clearly don't like Kyouko and Mami is you like pairing them together. I mean. If you liked them why would you shit on them. You don't like them as they are in the series, you only like them for the shallow shipping you do with them. Which isn't actually the real them, obviously.</br>  <br>Ah, so I was spot on. Thank you for clarifying. I always have slight doubt each time someone posts crack shit, but it's usually the second reply that seals the deal. If it's anything along the lines of "autism" or "u mad" it's a safe bet that it's on of your standard Madoka thread shitposters.<br><br>It's good to know that you are so mentally inept you can't even pretend to prove you're not treating the characters like shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for shitposter.</br>  <br>You're assuming quite a bit about why I enjoy this pairing. <br><br>No wonder this thread is so dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>samefag.</br></br>  <br><br>So what's your favorite pairing, anons?</br></br>  <br> I don't like a pairing for anything about it or the characters in it <br>And it's obvious you're still dodging the obvious questions made in the posts. e.g. Why you treat the characters like shit. And you are clearly dodging it because you know you can't prove you're not.<br><br>Didn't I tell you to fuck off, tumblr?</br></br></br></br>  Bare Mado legs or covered Homu legs?  <br>And you're dodging the question on what your favorite pairing is. If you answer my question, I'll answer yours.</br>  <br><br> 61 seconds apart <br>Now this is actual samefagging.<br><br>I wonder. Do you have real purpose in life or do you just wake up every day thinking of new ways to be a shallow asshole?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Covered Homu legs.</br>  <br>So what's your favorite pairing?</br>  <br>I don't see the characters as just parts in a pairing. I appreciate them as for what they are, and appreciate them all equally.<br><br>And part of appreciating them is appreciating who the characters themselves like. e.g. Madoka and Homura like each other, and Kyouko and Sayaka like each other.<br><br>But guess what?<br>This isn't your blog. You're not here to talk about your likes and dislikes you're here to discuss anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All pairs that don't degrade and insult the characters involved.</br>    Did Homura do the right thing or not?  <br>I'm discussing my favorite pairing in a media franchise that includes anime and manga. You still haven't stated your favorite pairing.</br>  <br>God, you are such a fucking scumbag.<br><br>And no, you are not discussing anything anime related, you are discussing yourself. You're the same as every retard who makes a post like "XD me and friends are gonna go watch Naruto, should i take pics?"<br><br>Lastly. I did answer your question, you are just a brain dead idiot.<br><br>Your "favorite pair" shits on Kyouko and Mami's characters, and is thus low quality posting and does not belong here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   here and:<br><br><br><br>61 one seconds between posts, with same angry tone and choice of words?<br>Yeah, you're samefag is strong. Still haven't posted you're favorite pairing though. It's almost as if you don't want to discuss the series at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what's you favorite pairing, anon?</br>  <br>I wasn't pretending to samefag, you moron. The replies were to different posts.<br><br>Posting your favorite pair IS NOT discussing the series, you fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  I'd like to see black and red work together  <br>You x Suicide</br>  <br>This. Just watch wixoss if you want magic and cute girls suffering.</br>  <br><br> I agree with what you say expect for for everything you said is wrong <br> I love retards like this. <br>It was a way to make fun of you. I am relieved that you understood this.<br><br> If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation? <br> No. Because it's not official. It's like you failed high school math and don't get that concept that not all rectangles are squares. Same thing here. To be canon something must be official, but not everything that's official must be canon. <br><br>Well? I asked the concept of direct continuation. Not canon. I asked how direct continuation is different to canon. Because you said "Rebellion is a direct continuation." not "Rebellion is canon" in the post  <br><br>So direct continuation is another word of canon? Some kind of prequel is not canon? Is it a necessary or sufficient condition to be the canon? Please answer.<br><br>If you can list the necessary and sufficient conditions to be the canon, that makes it easy.<br><br><br>So the fact that Rebellion is a direct sequel of the TVA, created by the same writer and animation studio, makes it canon? I am okay with this. Without Gen, absolutely non-canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember to stay on topic, anon. I don't think that pairing has anything to do with the series.</br>  <br> this artist draws Yuuno x Nanoha doujin <br>Man. They're scum in everything they do.<br><br><br> It was a way to make fun of you <br>Yeah, no, that' doesn't imply anything negative about anyone. So it's not making fun of them.<br><br> concept of direct continuation <br>Still not a concept. Learn to fucking read.<br>Not only that. But all your questions have already been answer IN THE VERY FIRST POST I made.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> black and red <br>You mean Homura and Kyoko, right? They did work really well together in the anime. Until someone died.</br></br>  <br> this person will never kill themselves even though they are clearly worthless to everything and everyone <br>Why?<br><br>And no. As it was already explained, you posting your favorite pair is not about the series. It's about you. Just because you keep ignoring it doesn't mean you're right.<br><br><br>Funny how obvious crack shitposters are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please make sure than the term "canon" used here means "canon to the Madoka TVA" because everything is canon to itself according to the post  that could make things confused</br>  <br> stay on topic <br>Shouldn't you take your own advice?<br>YOu're not posting on topic. Not only are oblogging, you're posting random characters that have nothing to do with the Madoka series.<br>The only characters I see in your posts are shallow knocks off with red and yellow hair.<br><br><br> begging for any excuse at all post garbage that treats the characters like shit <br><br>What's it like knowing you will never ever be a quality person?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Skip straight to the 3rd one.</br>  <br>Talking about the characters in the series is more on-topic than insulting the people posting in the thread. <br><br>Nice meta-posting. <br><br><br>I prefer to ship Homura with Sayaka, especially after Rebellion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  i love homu  <br> replying to yourself <br>Just stop.<br><br>And you are not talking about the characters, as you have been told a 1000 times before. You are talking about your own shipping.<br><br>I keep trying to get you to talk about the characters, but you keep insisting people blog.<br>In short, you need to end yourself.<br><br>And in case it's not obvious to everyone else how it's obvious you are replying yourself. Both you and your pretend persona are dodging the exact same thing; how you treat the characters like shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's very lovable.</br>  <br>I understood that you are listing the Raildex as an example of canon series to the original Series. You know that Raildex is not any kind of prequel or sequel, and any kind of "direct continuation" to the original series right?<br><br>So, it seems that direct continuation has nothing to do with canon. Because something can be the canon to its original series without being the direct continuation. Then why did you say "Rebellion is a direct continuation. It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8 related to each other?" to endorse the fact that Rebellion is canon in the post ?</br></br></br>  <br>she is very perfect</br>  Hello, sorry to interrupt. <br><br>Please take back your edgelord Kyon-kun. He's that one fuck that likes to write depressed/suicidal and drunken out of character Madokas with pseudo intellectual bullshit, while having her abuse Homura and belittle her friends. It was a cross over with Civ5. After that quest died, he kept making new ones and made another recently. We're all very worried for his mental health. But mostly just disturbed.<br><br>With love, /tg/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you mind using a tripcode? It would make filtering you and your anger out much easier.</br>  <br>It helps that she's grown and changed so much throughout the series which gives her a lot of depth.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with your brain that you are so hung up on the term "direct continuation?"<br><br>And again, if you had any ability to read at all you'd already know the answer to your question Because it was already said.<br><br>If something is official and direct continuation then it is canon. You're right, something doesn't have to be a direct continuation to be canon, but it is one of the default things that make it canon if official.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Such a person never posted here. He's all yours, friend.</br>  <br>Oh look, there you go dodging the actual subject again. It's almost like you are out to prove you're shitposting and nothing more.</br>  <br>seeing her character develop was one of my favorite things about the series. Also it meant that there were so many flavors of homus to love.</br>  <br>The actual subject?<br><br>Oh right, Mami and Kyoko is my favorite pairing. But I thought you knew that already?<br><br>And I agree with  in that Homura is my favorite character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not even saying anything new now. You're just repeating what you said before.<br><br>The actual subject is how you degrade and insult the characters by pairing Mami and Kyouko together.<br><br>But again, it's obvious you already know this and are just looking for "excuses" to keep posting more and shit that insults them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My favorite thing about her character development was that when rewatching the anime you understand why she acts the way she does. <br><br>Especially in that first episode, like when Madoka asked if it was alright to use Homura's first name.</br></br></br>  <br>I just don't agree with your premise that shipping characters is degrading to them because they are fictional. <br><br>Why so serious?</br></br></br>  <br>Good enough. Thank you.<br> If something is official and direct continuation then it is canon. <br>That's the answer I wanted.<br><br>He just accepted the wraith arc is canon to the Madoka TVA. Because it's a direct continuation of Madoka TVA, and official. But I am not actually very happy to this. So let's add one thing to this.<br><br> If something is official animated series by the same writer and animation studio, and direct continuation(sequel) then it is canon. <br>It returned to this post  anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Defiantly. To be honest when i first watched madoka magica i thought she was just the edgy character. All i knew, thanks to /a/ spoilers was that she somehow became the "devil". But watching the series and then rebellion multiple times, her actions and ultimate choice in the end really made sense. She was trapped in the maze called reality and she not only found a way out, but a way to become the master of the labyrinth.</br>  <br> you're serious about adding 2+2 so ur wrong! <br>Nope. Not how it works. No one "serious" you just tell yourself that you so cop out of giving actual answers. It's self delusion.<br><br>And you, I'm sure, have been told many times that just because they are fiction doesn't mean you can't degrade them.<br><br>In the canon setting of the series Madoka/Homura and Kyouko/Sayaka have strong (romantic) feelings for each other. Note, strong is a term that means something is high in value. In the state of their feelings being strong for each other they are obviously in love with each other. Seeing as how if you portray the feelings they have as stronger than in canon they will only be even more attracted to each other that means the only other directed the feelings can travel in a crack setting is lower. This means that Madoka/Homura and Kyouko/Sayaka’s feelings are being portrayed as weak in the new crack setting because if they weren't being portrayed as weak they would still be in love with each other rather than their crack setting counter part. And obviously, weak is a term that means low in value. Now, remember what it meant to degrade something? To lower it in value. This is what you have done in your crack setting. You have made their canon feelings be portrayed as weak than what they are for the sake of pairing them without someone else for the sake of amusing yourself. <br><br>Of course you as a third party can not actually effect the canon characters to degrade them. What’s being discussed here is that in your personal portrayal of them they have been weakened and degraded. The issue is not that the canon characters have been changed, but that you as a viewer are saying negative things about them. You are saying their feelings are weak in your portrayal of them, thus you are degrading them. It doesn't actually have to effect the characters, it’s similar to insulting someone behind their back. Which means to insult someone without their knowledge of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thread always reduces to shit when the crack shitposting occurs.  <br>What you said is already part of the definition of being a direct continuation. If it's not made by the same people then the same project is obviously not being continued.</br>  Time for your weekly dose of tomato suffering.  <br><br>You could not pay me to drop a Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, no matter how radical the story changes were.</br></br>  <br>Because it entertains us.</br>  <br> Ruri is more scared of Yuto than Acedemia goons and joins them willingly </br>  <br>Yeah, though it'll probably be bad/mediocre like the 5D's manga was.<br>This Arc-V manga seems to be making the same mistake that made me dislike the 5D's manga so much, so I have no expectations here.</br></br>  <br> tfw I don't want to pay for those goddamn tokens </br>  Just finished the manga. Judging from everyone else's reaction and the uncanny resemblance of the two. She finally snapped, right?  yes  she's a bear, jim.  <br>I was about to post this. Where can I find the other chapters?</br>  Kei is daijobu  Don't delude yourself. You know she is the best.  <br>Too late.</br>  <br>Nico is the best girl and best idol.<br>Damned LL fags having such shit taste.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean, exactly?<br>She is among both the most loved and hated girls.<br>Many LL fags think like you do.</br></br></br>  However, Umi seems to get a lot of a particular type of doujins and this makes me and my penis very happy.<br><br>How so? I just see a lot of "muh ultra rare pepe" and "nico a shit u hav shit taste hurrdurr"</br></br>  Rice is nice  Post anything JJBA!  <br>Oh, forgot about PB.
