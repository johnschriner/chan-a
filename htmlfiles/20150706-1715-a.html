[ Be honest, you really think there will be a second season? why?  <br>Tumblr demands it.</br>  <br>But tumblr hopes and dreams got crushed by Reina's takisexual tendencies</br>  <br>Buchou's got rack</br>  <br> sample </br>  <br>Why are they sexualizing Kaori like that?</br>  Trombros  <br>They both play the trombone and are the love interest of the main girls of this season. Everything is so beautiful.</br>  <br>A good chance of it, going by levels of discussion created by the first one. Sales are above recent averages all points to working in favour of a continued production.</br>  It's funny meme, like Amagi second season<br>(but Keionium was sold even worse)</br>  Pick your side  Both of them at the same time.<br><br>/threading myself</br></br>  Reverse trap &gt; trap  <br>I want to fuck this girl cause I like girls who are if she look dudeish <br>I want to fuck the boy cause he look like a girl but I don't like guys</br></br>  <br>this IMHO</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>good job with that damn res.</br>    <br>Once again, selling all my figures, except for a few.<br>Shoot me a PM on MFC if you're interested.<br>I'm going to bed now, but I'll reply as soon as I can!<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/xYellow</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck, but I think you should keep some, maybe four or five.</br>  <br>He's not selling them, he's scamming.</br>  Just bought a Shirobako daki from Kinokuniya x Animate booth at Anime Expo for 40 bucks. What's the chance that they're official? Design's the same as the one that is supposedly only limited to 100 for pre orders. Quality also seems to be there.  <br>You could get better deals selling on MFC rather than here.</br>  <br>Kinokuniya were reported to sell bootleg dakis during AX, and it was in the past thread as well.</br>  <br>I know. Whatever I don't sell by Wednesday or so I'll put up there. But I always like to give anons a chance first.</br>  <br>RIP. <br>Oh well. Still got my Yano</br></br>    Look what people at MFC comment when your birthday comes up.<br> You are the birthday star today... Happy birthday! ...xD ...xD </br>  <br>People who say xD are mentally ill</br>  <br>I got that one.<br>I removed my birthday from my account since.</br></br>  <br>I wish I lived in US to buy something, as I said before, good luck.</br>  <br>How much for meido kuroneko?</br>  What's the best way to order from toranoana?<br><br>Some anons were talking about some proxies, forwarding sites but I didn't really get in the end which one was the best. Someone even said that 2you4 didn't handle r-18 stuff or whatever.</br></br>  Left butt vs right butt<br>Which one would you prefer?</br>  <br>I got my first fig today. I know the picture is shit but does her ahoge look right to you guys? Is it supposed to curve off to the side like that?</br>  <br>ask him by MFC as he said.</br>  <br>I want Pochaco to ride my dick cowgirl while Sonico sits on my face.</br>  <br>Shut up.</br>  <br> wanting to go on the bottom <br>You got a death wish?</br></br>  <br>I didn't put Pochaco on my face for a reason.</br>  <br>Goody-Japan is good although sometimes slow to order and items have sold out in the meantime a couple of times for me. Pretty popular for the fixed 500 yen tora commission.</br>  <br>Your lower body will still be crushed.</br>  <br>Bones heal.</br>  <br>I'd prefer if you stop spamming this pic</br>  <br>I know that 2you4 will ship R-18 labeled doujinshi at least. Don't know about other things though.<br><br>2you4 and BiJ are great for forwarding. Goody-Japan is a good proxy but the downside is you have to wait for someone there to place the order so if stock is very low and you it's outside their operating hours it might sell out. FromJapan seems good too, though I'm still waiting for the stuff I won from auctions to arrive so I can't say for sure yet.</br></br></br>  Box  If I just want to buy digital copies of stuff off tora no ana I still need a jp address and phone number to register, should I just completely make this up and put a randomly picked existing/nonexisting address in?  <br>Packaging</br>  <br> and you it's <br>Meant to say "and you place the order when it's outside their operating hours".</br></br>  <br>FJ won't buy from Tora, sadly.</br>  <br>Bubble Wrap</br>  <br><br><br>Stop</br></br></br>  <br>Reveal</br>  <br><br><br>I'll give GJ a try then, just tried to register on Tora and apparently my moon is not quite there yet, so a proxy service is going to be the best to not screw something for now.</br></br></br>  <br>Perfection</br>  <br>And why did this shit need 5 posts?</br>  <br>If I were to explain your series of posts, it would be a drumroll, followed by https://<span>youtu.be/1ytCEuuW2_A  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I don't say this often, but go back to fucking /v/. You didn't read the guide, you posted SAO shit, and you didn't even show us the fucking figure. Congrats, you fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously to increase his post count on this forum.</br>  Today I found myself sitting in the shower, embracing my fat upper leg for a good five minutes. I think it's time for a daki.  <br>Wonder how many points I've accumulated...</br>  <br>Oh, really? I only just used them for the first time for some auctions so I only took a look at that part of their FAQ.</br>  <br>Liked, subscribed and fuck off.</br>  <br>Just throw them up on ebay, I just made 1300 from my auctions this week and that was only 7 listings. I just put up about 8 more.</br>  <br>How many do you have, bud?</br>  Just reminding you all that this is a thing and people will buy it  <br>Is that a new Zoid?</br>  <br>Evangelion rebuild. In episode 3 they get this thing that's powered by unit 1</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god if you don't say is from Eva 3.0 I would have never guessed, and I watched the movie. That thing doesn't look like anything I remember from it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's that giant ship at the start that Asuka and Misato etc are in. I'm pretty conflicted that it's a thing to begin with</br>  <br>Pochaco erryday</br>  <br>I'm glad I've never watched any Eva shit except the original series when it was first on TV in english.</br>  <br><br>I remember the giant ship, just not that it looked like a digimon/zoid.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't blame you. The rebuild so far has kinda slaughtered everything<br>Asuka is a bitch with no explanation. Misato is just a slut, nothing on her daddy issues and Shinji  causes the third impact and is in a coma for 14 years and comes back and is sorta okay with the fact he killed nearly everyone and is eager as fuck to get back in unit 1 but everyone hates him and Misato threatens to kill him if she catches him piloting an eva <br><br>That may be from how they didn't show the whole thing very often. But I might be remembering it too vaguely</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Rebuild 1&amp;2. But 3.0 just butchered everything about the series.</br></br>  <br>Agreed<br>But I would have like some back story to Mari</br></br>  <br>I got pissed at 3.0.</br>  <br>By the sounds of it a lot of people did</br>  <br><br>Because first 2 are basically what you already know but with more action and a few different things here and there, which is nice. 3.0 is just, quite literally, what the flying fuck am I watching? Nothing makes fucking sense, at all.</br></br>  No new Haruhi figures for the spinoff, yet?<br>Odd.</br>  <br>Don't forget about the fact that nothing that they showed on the preview actually happened.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gigantic budget and the addition of Mari  Sue </br>  <br>We've been over this anon, he didn't cause the impact.</br>  <br>According to the rebuild he did</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I forgot about this too.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it was stopped before the impact took place.<br>Come on anon we figured this out ages ago.</br></br>  You're still getting this, right?  <br>Only if I have enough money to.</br>  <br>Depends who makes it</br>   I know nobody cares about this but I won't be here for 30 days since I have three finals pending and the Cisco 200-120 test   <br> liking the shitty Illya spin-off <br><br>It ruined best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody cares indeed.</br>  <br><br>If Amakuni is the one doing it, yeah. Alter would also be a good option, but I consider Amakuni way ahead of them when it comes down to nude/semi-nude figures.</br></br>  <br>It made her into*</br>  <br>I don't even know who you are and who on /a/ would even care?</br>  Still in stock at Amiami, I don't get it, this saddens me, does that means that she's going to bin?.<br><br><br><br>guess what buddy?, you're going to fail on all of those three, now get lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw that. It is 100% for sure a bootleg. It wasn't even the same material as the official, for starters.</br>  How's Manda for doujins? Like, how is the the quality usually?  <br> I don't get it <br>Snake type monster girls are only popular when they are Lamias.</br></br>  <br>Perfectly fine.</br>  <br>She already binned to 12k on Amazon.</br>  <br>But didn't they say straight up in 3.0 that he caused the third impact at the end of 2.0?<br>In 3.0 the 4th impact nearly happens, if that's what you're thinking</br></br>    <br>I really want to but I might get v&amp;</br>  Which do you prefer for your waifu, daki or artbook?  <br>Daki so I can hug her</br>  Would you buy a H-manga from your favourite artist for 5k yen?  <br>That's not really binning considering her price is 12.5k at AmiAmi with their usual discount.</br>  <br>Are you serious? Daki.</br>  Did the Mage for Bikini Warriors get shown yet?  So how do you guys clean the semen off your figs after you're done? I usually just use hot water, but I'm wondering there's a better way.  <br>No.</br>  What's the most recent order you placed? I just put a bid down on a Greek island.  <br>Can never have enough daki covers, but her appearance in artbooks is slim, and I have a handful of covers. I'd take an artbook at this point, honestly.</br>  <br>Well if you consider that Alter's Selvaria was at 18k at some point, and since the face of the Vertex's one is more faithful to Raita's style, I would have expected to see her soul out faster.<br><br>Yeah but she's at 12,5K (with the discount of course)at amiami (brand new), so it's basically the same.<br><br><br>Wasn't that Non-virgin artbook around 4,5K?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you?  <br>Nop, that's the price with Japanese txa removed and Amiami's discount. You have tot take in to consideration the Japanese market.</br>  <br>What was the open bid?</br>  <br>Steal her collection? Of course.</br>  <br>What's his hourly rate?</br>  <br>3DPD</br>  <br>Would be mad not to bang the woman you paid for</br>  <br>eww, looks like a ladyboy.</br>  <br>Judging by the figs there, I don't think she'd be into guys anyway</br>  <br>All the better</br>  <br>where are the MODS when you need them?, also ban this fucker.</br>  <br>I doubt I'd be able to get all those figures into my conservative muslim nation without getting into trouble</br>  <br>Amiko doesn't remove Japanese sales tax for their international store. Oddly enough she's 12.5k on their international site and 14.5k on their Japanese site.<br><br>But Amazon tends to have bigger discounts faster anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> conservative muslim nation <br>Sweden?</br></br>  Since I friend gave me a rinko figurine as a present, I got curious about love plus so I played it, in the end it was pretty monotonous and boring, I can't really understand the all hype about it back then, it doesn't seem that different in comparison to true love to me.

I want Naruto back.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> All aboard the hype train!</br></br>  I don't remember Krillin being so short.  <br><br>too bad bulma is old now</br></br>  How the fuck did Freiza power up a trillion times by "training" for a month?<br><br> It works because I'm a prodigy <br> It works because I've never trained before <br><br>What the fuck Toriyama?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think this season needs some Goku and Chichi romance, cause Chichi is always up Goku's ass but there aren't really any sweet human moments between them lately.</br>  <br> I wish I was back in my training capsule taking a fat Saiyan shit </br>  I REALLY enjoyed watching the episode.  So did my girlfriend. <br><br>Really brings back that classic Dragon Ball feeling. Plus Goten is adorable.</br></br>  <br>When did Mr. Satan go DYEL?</br>  <br><br>That's because Bulma is rich and money means nothing to her. It's obvious that Bulma has more control over Vegeta than ChiChi has over Goku. Goku keeps abandoning his family whereas Vegeta actually raises his children and spends time with Bulma. Bulma even made him wear a pink shirt just to humiliate him.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully when the arc is redone in the series they will make it more clear how he was able to get such a huge power jump.</br>  <br> <br>odd</br></br>  <br> How do they even fuck </br>  <br>The pig is still a thing?<br>He should've been dead by now</br></br>  Is GT canon?

Stop shitting up /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oolong has the coolest power and the biggest thing they do with it is make him turn into scissors</br>  <br>I wonder what Toriyama is going to do with SSJ4. Perhaps he'll keep it. . .or maybe he'll just act like GT never happened and leave it alone from there.</br>  <br> So did my girlfriend. <br><br>There's the door, normie.</br></br></br>   <br><br>Well I think saving the planet is pretty important too</br></br>  <br>SSGSSJ is SS4</br>  I liked the ED.<br><br><br>Well hello cancer.

Fuck off somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br> that QUALITY  <br>TOEI!</br></br>  <br><br>The thing I don't get is why he had to go for the most ridiculous explanation there was. He just trained? How about a mysterious, ancient item that increases your power a thousand times? Or how about a genetic modification which allows Frieza to evolve further? Or how about him getting God Ki somehow?<br><br>There are so many possibilites, yet Tori went for the most implausible one. This cannot be a coincidence. I think he did it on purpose. He is trolling us.</br></br></br></br>  Working on making the part 2 sub file right now guys<br><br>let you know when there is a link up for it!</br></br>  <br>No, SSGSSJ is SSGSSJ<br><br>Pic related is SSJ4</br></br></br>  <br> So did my girlfriend. <br><br>No one cares. Fuck off,</br></br></br>  I can't believe i'm hyped for DB again.  <br>DB -&gt; DBZ -&gt; DBS -&gt; DBZ Ending -&gt; DB Online</br>  <br> I want Naruto back. <br><br>That's a lame joke. You should at least have said something more believable or at least, within reason or a realm of probability. It's not funny if it's so outlandish, that no one takes the bait or plays along.</br></br></br>  <br> Plus Goten is adorable. <br>You sure you're not the girlfriend, m8?</br></br>  <br>I thought it could be setting up a way for Uub to be relevant afterwards. If Freeza could get on the level of gods just by training, then Uub, who has Kid Buu's power, could become even stronger.</br>  Japanese sub is awful, but I am really tempted to download it because of hype. Fuck grandma Goku.  Ok seriously, neither CR nor Funi, and therefore HS, are subbing this? What the fuck? WHY?  <br>Vegeta.<br><br>Goku in the end does whatever the fuck he wants. If Chichi has a problem with it he'll just "accidentally" bitch slap her through the house again.</br></br></br>  <br> Dat salt  <br>kek</br></br>  <br><br>Puereh did that.</br></br>  <br>Your daily reminder that Naruto is not a bad series, and certainly not worse than DBZ<br><br> It's just the cancerous fanbase over-hype that turns everyone off. </br></br></br>  <br>Its not bait.

Good work.<br><br>Also I understand the transition but its only 6 months after Buu. Gohan and Videl are.. 19? Tops? Videl shed her action girl form really quick and Gohan went full GT real fast.<br><br>I was looking forward to Mystic Gohan transitioning to Scholar Gohan. Missed opportunity as he winds down.<br><br>Also, that dragon fist movie? I wanted to see them as some fuckin' Great Saiyaman and woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was teasing someone with aspergers. I'll be more careful not to upset you in future with default file names.</br></br>  <br>Replies!</br>    <br>I kinda like that explanation actually.<br>Frieza never learned anything. He just started out as the most powerful being around, never having to struggle against anything.<br>So he never learned to temper his natural strength. He only learned how to suppress it.<br><br>Also he seemed to be fond of assimilating other people's fighting techniques. Frieza makes mention of learning how to copy the Namek regeneration power at one point I think. So maybe he learned to copy the super saiyan power as well. That's why he goes all glowy like one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was just born, wasn't he? He's just a bit older than Pan.</br>  <br>DBS starts before the last episode of DBZ where Uub shows up.<br>so this is in between majin buu and that particular tournament.</br></br>  <br>he wished on the dragonballs to have special <br>panties<br>this Wish winds up creating the ONLY female Dragon in GT<br><br>he disguised as Bulma a bunch of times</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lol autism xD <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  Why battle shounen threads are always the worst?  <br>It really is. Fortunately there wasn't much Goku in this episode, but Trunks and Goten have some terrible voices as well.</br>  Now I see why people here didn't want Naruto threads  <br><br>No. You clearly don't know how /a/ works and should go back to whatever normie site you came from.</br></br>  Why is Goku using a tractor in the beginning? Didn't he use to plow fields with his bare hands to train?  <br>Pan and therefore Uub aren't born yet.</br>  <br>God GT sucked</br>   streaming <br>Sasuga DBZfag</br>  Who's subbing this decently?  <br>The Moonlighters</br>  <br><br>It's okay, the bad websites can't hurt you here.</br></br>  <br>Because it attracts the worst kind of people.</br>  <br>Do you think that's enough training for Goku now?</br>  <br> lol <br> xD <br> &gt;/reddit/ </br></br></br>  <br> archive screenshot </br>  <br>Its just cause the rest of /a/ realized how much fun we were having and decided to start the shit flinging. <br><br>Keep up the good work.</br></br></br>  <br>just why anon<br>you blew it<br>all this shitposting is because of u</br></br></br>  <br>I was wondering about that too. The best explanation I could come up with is that Chichi bought a tractor since Goku would never stick around to do the work himself.</br>  I fucking love shitposting.  <br>Dont see why not, doing pushups was enough for Frieza to be stronger than God.</br>  <br>If you got a gf you wouldn't be so bitter</br>  <br> a fucking stream link in the OP on fucking /a/ <br><br>And people say that Fatefags and Narutards are bad.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Your explanation makes sense, but his growth rate is still too ridiculous. If he can become stronger that fast, then why didn't he overpower Goku during their fight? Fighting a strong opponent should be considered training, after all. <br><br>Another thing I like to nitpick is that it was established that god ki &gt; all other ki. So how can Frieza challenge somebody with god ki without having god ki himself?<br><br> Frieza makes mention of learning how to copy the Namek regeneration power at one point I think. <br><br>I don't remember that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last few DBS threads weren't bad at all. I blame OP.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br><br>That sucks.<br><br>I'm rewatching the last couple episodes and would have liked to see Uub's training</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how you missed it, but Goku made those huge craters everywhere.</br>  <br>Freeza is naturally much stronger than Saiyans.</br>  <br>I think it was when he was fighting Nail after he rips his arm off.</br>  <br>  undisciplined internet habits <br>you are either a skinny fat manlet or a 200+ pound obese landwhale</br></br>  <br>She was one of the best parts of GT</br>  <br>They'll catch up eventually.</br>  <br><br>I want to know what kind of Japanese qualification OP has. <br><br>How do we even know he speaks nip?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto threads were full of deviantart/tumblr shit. They were just as bad.<br><br><br>I highly doubt that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>freiza was actually stronger after he got BTFO by goku. mecha freiza was stronger than 100% full power freiza but SSJ Trunks and even SSJ Goku were still above him.<br><br>the reason why freiza can train for 4 months and be stronger than god ki is because he is a freak of nature/toei handwaving bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> I highly doubt that. <br>I was there, check the archive.</br></br>  <br>And you are certainly not from /a/.</br>  how long is this going to be on the air for?<br><br>every sunday until it ends?</br></br>  <br>BON PARA PARA PARA BON PA PA</br>  <br>I miss old Videl. When she was strong willed and tsundere. She's too bland now.</br>  <br><br>inb4 cancelled :C</br></br>  <br>Ara ara Videl is superior.</br>  <br>Every Sunday until Gokus VA dies.</br>  <br><br>I just want pig-tail Videl back</br></br>  <br>It's called character development. Modern Videl is the eventual fate of every tsundere.</br>  <br>I was thinking of this, I remember the wish too though</br>  I want to be cucked by 18.  <br>forgot to attach the picture</br>  <br><br>The very fact that it's one of the most popular western series is probably the reason why it's not getting a simulcast. <br><br>Toei is likely charging either several magnitudes of gorillion dollars for the streaming rights or are outright refusing to sell streaming rights so they can manipulate supply/demand and maximize profits when they do export the series overseas.</br></br></br></br>   the minute Chi Chi gives Goku permission to train with King Kai this nigga immediately fucks off   <br>Why would anyone want to be from /a/?</br>  Why the fuck doesn't the World Martial Arts Tournament ban aliens<br><br>so unfair</br></br>  <br> goku doesn't get the pussy, the pussy goes to goku </br>  <br> streaming <br><br>I want reddit to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>that made me lol when he left _immediately_ no hugs or affection for his wife or child</br>  <br>I love that. Goku didn't say goodbye to everyone or anything. And you know he doesn't plan to come back for like 3 years or something.</br>  <br><br>Naruto threads never flooded /a/ like DBZ threads do these days. <br><br>Narutards mostly minded their own business. <br><br>Dubfags kept invading and janitors kept deleting the threads just for the sake of being assholes. <br><br>Discussion of the gaiden was fun whenever it was possible. <br><br>Now look at this mess. <br><br>DBZ attracts a lot more normies than Naruto does.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  KRILLIN EPISODE WHEN  <br>i know, based origins</br>  <br><br>Hopefully, two weeks from now.</br></br>  <br>Normans rooooooooooooooooooooooooooo outta my hole, MY hole, rooooooo</br>  <br><br>King Kai is Goku's Moe's bar.</br></br>  <br><br>Dragonball is the every-man anime.<br><br>Just a lot of bad dudes doing badass things</br></br></br></br>  <br>Difference is everyone likes DBZ.<br><br> Except faggots. You're not a faggot are you? </br></br></br>  <br>it was because of fucking OP <br>Older threads were good.</br></br>  <br> Roshi, Krillin, 18 and Australkrebs go on a camping trip <br> Krillin teaches Australkrebs to fly while Roshi tries to sexually harass 18 </br></br>  Pikkon when?  <br>And those naruto threads were still cancerous as fuck.<br><br> Narutards mostly minded their own business.  <br><br>Except when their thread got deleted and they spammed new threads and telling everyone ''fuck board culture''.<br><br>Naruto threads were just as bad as this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Naruto threads were pretty bad with all that "cuck" posting even if the shipping was toned down a bit.<br> normies <br>You gave yourself away right here with this off-board terminology. Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>checked</br></br>  <br>Remember when Krillin was aboput Vegeta's height during Namek?<br>No one does at Toei.</br></br>  <br>Only nostalgia fags and redditors like dbz.</br>  <br>Australkrebs? You mean Maron?</br>  <br><br>I like Dragon Ball. DBZ is meh. That's not the issue though. You should be able to tolerate threads about anime/manga you don't like as long as they are not cancerous, whereas cancerous threads should not be tolerated even if you like the manga/anime in question.</br></br>  So...

It would be great to see Tien and Krillin and Yamcha be able to contribute again. God power doesn't seem to be a saiyan only thing, so who knows.

Normally I would expect them to shitpost an anime that didn't meant their hivemind-shounen hating standards but DBS is going be like a gorrilion episodes so I wonder if they'll eventually get bored or manage to break the limiters on thier autism levels and shitpost in these threads for all eternity? That'll be pretty funny see how their willing to go.  <br><br>That's the spirit. I want to see this shithole burn to the ground.</br></br>  <br><br>seems legit</br></br>  <br>Have we started the fire?</br>  im a HUGE DBZ fan. ive watched the series multiple times growing up. but this episdoe was bull shit. i am dumbfounded by how people are in such denial over how "good" this episode was. it was literally filler quality in the first episode...<br><br>you c an say what you wantn about GT, but the first episode of GT &gt; first episode of super. and i DARE anyone to prove me wrong so i can make them look like the retarded fanboys that they are.<br><br>we have a fucking problem when goten/trunks, who is supposedly stronger than namek saga final form freiza, is STRUGGLING to beat up a fucking snake and that same scene is actually the best scene in the damn episode. like you have to be fucking kidding me with that bull shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep posting like this and DBZ thread will be reduce to only one a week.</br>  <br><br>Posting Dragon Ball will probably become a bannable offense on /a/ because most of the mods are autists themselves. But Western garbage can always be posted here without a problem.</br></br>  So, what's the chance of there being a noticeable drop in animation quality within the next few episodes?  <br><br> we have a fucking problem <br><br>no, it's only you, you autistic neckbeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> im a HUGE DBZ fan. ive watched the series multiple times growing up. <br>well aren't you just precious!</br></br>  <br>100%</br>  <br>it was always burning since the world was turning</br>  <br><br>she is the weakest human among all of the "z fighters" she was destined to be a stay at home get me a sandwich bitch.</br></br>  Where the fuck are Yajirobi and Dende?  <br>Nigger I could give two shits about DBS being discussed on /a/. I'm most likely going to drop it anyway if it stays as shitty as the first episode was. I'm only wondering how autistic you faggots are going to be about anime you don't like. This shit is funny seeing grown men lose their shit over chinese cartoons.</br>  i dont think there's any precedent for banning discussion of a currently airing series. you guys are exaggerating or just having delusions  <br><br>Not really, the episode was crap. Half this thread also agrees it was crap. More than half of the last thread agrees it was crap.<br><br>The only ones who don't agree it was crap are the autistic fanboys who are drunk on hype for the series return. Like you for example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> am dumbfounded by how people are in such denial over how "good" this episode was. <br><br>But you're the one who says that it's bad. So you're in denial over how good it was. <br><br> you c an say what you wantn about GT, but the first episode of GT &gt; first episode of super. <br><br>Meh. The first episode of GT wasn't that bad actually. I didn't like the way Pan was introduced and Trunks scene was also unnecessary if you ask me, but the rest was ok. GT got really bad later. <br><br> we have a fucking problem when goten/trunks, who is supposedly stronger than namek saga final form freiza, is STRUGGLING to beat up a fucking snake <br><br>People need to stop caring about powerlevels. You cannot have fun adventures when your characters are indestructible. Just imagine that a space wizard scaled their powers down and enjoy the adventures. <br><br> and that same scene is actually the best scene in the damn episode <br><br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn<br><br>That's deep, just like the mod's mom's asshole<br><br>For free<br>R<br>E<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Piccolo absorbing Dende <br> Not Dende asserting his youth by devouring the bitch that is Piccolo </br></br></br>  <br> grown men </br>  <br>He looks like the love child of Krillin and Piccoro</br>  <br><br>Where they always are? On top of that big ass tower.</br></br>  so are Battle of Gods and Resurrection F noncanon? Will Super have a timejump? Because this appears to be set before Battle of Gods, yet the opening makes it clear Super Saiyan God as an idea hasn't been abandoned  <br>no one cares if you don't like something. go back to reddit.</br>  <br> I'm only wondering how autistic you faggots are going to be about anime you don't like. This shit is funny seeing grown men lose their shit over chinese cartoons. <br>Coincidentally you're being autistic about people you don't like posting about a show you don't even care about. It's funny seeing you lose your shit over blue boxes.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually expecting this TV run not to be perfect at all, lately animes have been rushed to air on TV which is resulting in some horrid shit quality at times, look to Sailor Moon Crystal for example.<br><br>DVD versions though are gonna look fucking tight or at least allot better then the TV versions. sorry to link to this site but its the quickest example I can recall:<br>http://kotaku.com/the-new-sailor-mo<wbr>on-anime-has-changed-1670373950</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> People need to stop caring about powerlevels. You cannot have fun adventures when your characters are indestructible. Just imagine that a space wizard scaled their powers down and enjoy the adventures.  <br><br><br>Power is the entire point of the damn series. goten/trunks should not be fighting snakes. period. gohan had them bitched out by there age in the sayian saga...<br><br>it just doesnt make sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>goku can literally still visit them even if he died. Hell, even if everyone died, they could all still be together cause other world. I guess it just means they can't die again or some shit?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Gotenks should've been replaced by Prillin.</br></br>  <br>When have people watched DBZ for the animation quality?</br>  <br>movies are possibly non-canon like before<br><br>the series will probably do the "official" versions of beerus visiting earth and freiza being revived<br><br>you can bet your ass SSG and SSJSSG will appear</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING NORMIES<br><br>RRRREEEEEEEEEEEĘEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEE</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you're the kind of guy who gets assblasted that Krillin threw a rock at Goku and it hurt him</br>  <br>Wow did you think hard about that amazing comeback all on your own?<br><br><br>Did you read my post? I don't care though? I just find it funny reading salty comments and I'm just wondering how long you autists can keep it up.</br></br></br></br>  Guys, I'm not supposed to do this but who cares. <br><br>My Uncle Toyable told me the following things:<br><br> BoG and RoF arcs are 20 eps long each <br> Champa is stronger than Beerus <br> Universe 6 is Demon Lord Piccolo <br> Super Dragonballs have limitless power <br> Gohan becomes Super Saiyan Mystic God <br> First 100 eps ends with the rest of the gods appearing and sets stage for next set </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Power is the entire point of the damn series.  <br><br>I thought the point was whacky humor, discovery, fun action sequences and a little ecchi fanservice from time to time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>ima just throw this out there.<br><br> DBS gohan = exactly the same as GT gohan. even has the fucking glasses. <br><br> Super Dragon balls = black star dragonball 2.0. same idea but probally different function. <br><br>its honestly looking more and more like they are just revamping GT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you are only pretending to care?</br>  <br>It's pretty funny to think you're making people mad when you're the most defensive person in a thread about something you hate.</br>  <br><br>that ended in Drgaon ball or, more specifically, at the arrival of radditz.</br></br>  <br>Fucking bullshit, right?</br>  <br> Universe 6 is Demon Lord Piccolo <br><br>They dropped the entire demon thing and turned him into a slug alien.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All right autists please memetext me about what post I made that makes you think I give a shit about Toei's new cashcow?</br></br>  GUUUUYYYSSS<br><br>Can you honestly tell me this episode did not make you feel a little warm inside? <br><br>I'm pretty happy right now.

The execution was what ruined GT. Watching GT is like a boring chore because the pacing is horrible. Furthermore, everything looks so ugly. All the colors are weird and don't fit together. When I watch GT, it's like I'm having a weird acid dream I want to wake up from.</br></br>  <br>Seeing Goku's shadow of when he was young brought back some memories. I like that they're showing the families all together.</br>  <br>You don't seem to understand the term separate universe.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br><br>Chichi needs to decorate their house.

Lapis) to appear once in super, and I want it on the Krilin chapter, make it so that 18 has a family reunion with him and they uncover a mystery on the woods.  <br><br>Yeah sure but Toei doesn't have to be THAT lazy. The background only needs to be drawn once. They didn't even bother to put a curtains on both sides of the window.</br></br>  <br>You think they reverse engineered space technology?<br>On the last episode of DBZ they still used cassettes and their TVs where fat as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Just get it over with. Its more ammo to use when debating with morons who say GT was a good series.</br>  <br>Sure they don't HAVE to, but they are.</br>  Lets get this shit straight once for all:<br><br>1. Krillin<br>2. Ten Shien Han<br>3. Roshi<br>4. Yamcha<br>5. Mr. Satan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it the mystery of the lonely park ranger and his furry friends? Will animal people finally get an origin story?</br></br>  Could it be that the black star dragon ball is the original dragon ball made by the dragon race (original people of kami and guru, not that namekian pariah) and not a repro?  <br> 1. Krilling <br> 2. Tien <br><br>Yeah, okay pal.</br></br></br></br>  Just realized, DBZ chapter 288, the big snake from Super appears there, tries to eat the pterodactyl egg, Goku grabs the snake and throws it away... <br><br>Continuity.</br></br>  <br><br>Yamcha is stronger than Roshi (at least in Z - no idea what happened in RoF)<br><br>Tien Shin Chan is stronger than Krilin when he sacrifices his life energy. Krillin was so scared of the androids that he couldn't even move. Meanwhile, Tien Shin Chan was able to hold his ground against imperfect Cell for a while. Krillin defeats Tien Shin Chan when both only use regular Ki though.</br></br></br></br>  1-Tien<br>2-Krillin<br>3-Yamcha<br>4-Ciaozu<br>5-Roshi (though at the RoF it seems that his power really increased exponentially)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chapter 288 takes place on Namek and there is no snake there.</br></br>  <br><br>Toriyama...remembers?</br></br>  How is it even possible to be so best girl?  <br>oh god please bring back bunny bulma</br>  <br><br>How did she end up in that costume again?</br></br>  <br>If only /a/ was still good.</br>  <br>Anime you fuck.<br><br>Episode 288 "Goku, you're late!"</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's possible when there is no competition.

What does everyone think Keith will have to say this month?  Please tell me Annie is unfrozen in the next chapter  He'll say:  no Eren, you ARE the Titans.   Ymir and Historia are the best shingekis in this terrible series.  <br>ur spoiler doesn't even work kiddo..psh</br>  What are the chances of any one of BRA surviving?  I love Annie.  <br>Zero, no one in this series is living to the end  since the world is obviously ending </br>  <br>Reiner would probably die.</br>  <br>No, MC and MC's girlfriend are best shingekis.</br>  <br>I always thought they might die a death where they redeem themself. Then again I think BRA working with humanity would be kind of boring.</br>  <br><br>Shipperfags are cancerous</br></br>  <br>Fuck off EHshitter.</br>  <br>So what would be a good fake spoiler?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>People usually only react to fujobait characters dying.</br>  <br>That one was a good one. Many Tumblrshits started killing themselves because of it.</br>  <br>I agree but it's not that bad.</br>  <br>Then the EMfags got mad because they recognized it from an EM doujin.</br>  <br>The one with Levi being kill got a lot reaction.</br>    <br>This makes me uncomfortable.</br>  Which one would you fug, /a/?  <br> It makes me feel all hot and bothered </br>  <br><br>It remind me of the potato faces of Aku no Hana.</br></br>  <br> no Kenny <br>No thanks.</br></br>  <br>Nick.</br>  <br>Yes, that terrible rotoscoping.</br>  Is Eren taller than Mikasa now?  <br>Hard to tell with Isayama's art.</br>  <br>Ymir and Ellen are wearing the wrong shirts.</br>  <br>Why does Ymir look like a gorilla?</br>  <br>WELL SWEET MOTHER TERESA ON THE HOOD OF A MERCEDES BENZ, YOU SOUND LIKE A MAJESTIC FUCKING EAGLE</br>    <br>Speaking of gorillas.</br>  <br>He needs more training to defeat MT.</br>  <br>How did this joke even start? Because of the spin offs or character design describtion?</br>  <br>Those are just fathers, Kenny doesn't belong in the group</br>  <br>He's wearing heels</br>  <br>I think it is because of the spin off.</br>  <br>Reminds me of my favorite BR picture</br>  <br>Reiner is such a faggot.</br>  <br>It looks like Bert has a really muscular leg in the bottom left pic.</br>  <br>He basically was Manlet's dad</br>    <br>The look about the same height in the fourth panel.</br>  <br>It was probably the character design description or it randomly started in fandom because of his build. Chuugakkou and Spoof both picked it up from fandom.</br>  <br>Takes a bit to get used to seeing Annie in a skirt.</br>  <br>*They</br>  <br><br>It's fine, I could tell what you meant.<br><br>Anyway, yeah it's probably a very minimal height difference</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127654846 <br>Allahfag sure doesn't know when to quit.</br>  <br>Annie is too pure to wear skirts</br>  <br><br><br>More like conscious that wearing a skirt with her style would be unfitting.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't believe someone would dare to bring that unfunny shit here.</br>    Can someone give me fucking spoilers idc even if its's fake spoilers just fucking give me  <br>Is she standing on Levi?</br>  <br>More like girls using skirts is either because they must according to the rules, or because they want potential parnters to notice them. She clearly doesn't care.</br>   I want Erwin to chicken me while pounding me mercilessly.   <br>I want to chicken him too anon</br>  Still no fucking spoilers?  <br>I have spoilers<br><br>Ask me anything</br></br></br>  <br>Oops I meant choke.

She just had a baby.</br>  Now that EH is canon, when Eren marries Historia, does he become king or prince consort?  <br>Probably king since Isayama doesn't seem to comprehend politics and hierarchy very well.</br>  <br>Historia isn't interested in Eren so he doesn't get any royal title.</br>  場面変わって キースを探す中で手掛かりをつかめないままの調査兵団 しかしさすがはヅラ、前々から「コイツ、スパイじゃね？」と目星をつけてい<wbr>た者を泳がせ尾行 スパイの正体はサシャ キースと落ち合うサシャ、そこに駆けつけ、二人を問い詰めるリヴァイ班、が<wbr>そこに猿軍団登場！ 立体機動で突っ込むミカサだが凄い蒸気で吹き飛ばされる、気を失うミカサ…<wbr>目覚めると、そこは温泉だった！<br>Translation: Scene changed survey corps but still you do not grasp the clue in to look for Keith is truly is Dzura, "guy, spy 's right?"

It's Mikasa that stick in the three-dimensional mobility, but be blown away by the great steam, and Mikasa ... wake up and lose the mind, there was a hot spring!<br>Apparently, Sasha is a spy?

I can't really see Sasha being a spy, especially since she was supposed to die, but Isayama could've changed the story.</br>  <br>If she is a spy, she would get more deathflags.</br>  <br>We also know what her home life was like, so I can't imagine her being a spy.</br>  There's no one for Sasha to even spy for  <br>Military Police?</br>  <br>Marco is obviously the spy if there is one</br>  <br> no yummykuri <br>FAKE<br><br><br>Fuck off Islamshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter.Royal marriage always raises the citizens morale.</br>  <br>She can spy on my  dick .</br>  <br>She's going to marry Ymir only.

There is no God!!</br>  <br><br>I chuckled.</br></br>  <br>But I'm german and atheist.</br>  <br>She can't marry someone dead, anon.<br>But if you are into that then okay, I won't judge you.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, it's not going to happen.</br>  <br>Not even legal in Japan.<br><br>Even if whatever the fuck medieval place they live in is more progressive than America a month ago, Historia still needs to fuck some dude just to keep the royal blood line going.</br></br></br>  <br>YHfag, please.</br>  <br>Why do the shipper retards here think being queen means she is going to need a king, particularly that retarded faggot Eren? She is only a queen in name anyways.</br>  <br>Okay, then she'll become the virgin mary to keep up the royal bloodline.</br>  <br>Doubt the royal bloodline will be needed once her reign is over.</br>  if God created the universe who created God? im so confused  <br>Ymir.</br>  <br>It's for the better not to continue her devil bloodline. It already caused enough suffering.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Erwin needed her for his plan to succeed and also because he probably assumed since she is a bastard she won't align herself with her family's ways.</br>  <br> hundreds of years of peace within the walls <br> suffering </br></br>  <br>They mindwiped everyone, didn't want to help when BRA attacked, massacred people they considered a threat, and only a minority really benefited from their reign.</br>  <br>I want Erwin to  praise  me  for my hard work   and my  dedication to humanity </br>  <br>Historia even said so herself and that their idea of peace was ruinous</br>  <br>If you're german and an atheist then you should support yummy kurry or else you're hitler.</br>  <br>atheists will die in hell</br>  <br>Being evangelic is fine too.</br>  <br>ugh, Islamshit fuck off, we are a bunch of fedora wearing yummykurry lovers here</br>  <br>They wiped everyones memories for their own good. And they only eliminated those who threatened the peace and stability, the new military government is doing the same thing except on a larger scale and including people who are even slightly associated with those threats.</br>  <br> monkey corps appeared! <br><br>So, we deerman now?</br></br></br>  <br>As another anon said, even Historia agrees her family was awful.</br>  <br>This. To be an atheist you must also be a cuckold (like YH). Our moderator is an atheist too and he ships Yummy Curry, even though he's too scared to admit it.</br>  Why are there no Greek Characters in the World of Attack on titan?<br><br>Did they Not pay the Debt?</br></br>  <br> Echolalia (also known as echologia or echophrasia) is the automatic repetition of vocalizations made by another person (...) one of the most salient aspects of communication disorders in autism </br>  <br>that's some dank meme kush you got there my fellow Greek brother<br><br>we shall never pay DEbnts to EU</br></br></br>  I want Isayama to confirm the political marriage of EH so all the YH fags jump off a cliff.  <br>Bert is Greek.</br>  <br>I am never going to jump off a cliff because yummy curry is canon, and you are a deluded het shitposter who only posts in this thread to shitpost, just like every other hetfag.<br><br>Even if Eren married her, Historia would still love Ymir only because Ymir is her true love and Historia is lesbian.<br><br>Now go blow yourself up for Allah, you filthy Muslim.

She was always suspicious.</br>  <br>Someone told the central MP where Nick was Anon. It could have been anyone. Even those we'd least suspect.</br>  <br>She was supposed to be killed off by Isayama. She never was suspicions and since she's supposed to be dead she clearly never was spying.</br>  <br>He probably made her a spy afterwards.</br>  <br>It's not Sasha, Connie or Jean.<br><br>They're two unimportant characters from the countryside and the MC of the manga respectively.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but that would be a total asspull. At least when it came to BRA there was some foreshadowing, but if he suddenly turned Sasha into a traitor after she was supposed to die it would feel random and forced.</br>  <br> Not him, <br>I am a girl.</br></br>  <br>EH doesn't make sense as a politacal marriage. More likely she'd be forced to marry some noble.</br>  <br>Sure you are, bro.</br>  <br>Who knows. It still could happen.</br>  <br>Can confirm. I posted those spoilers, I'm trolling kek</br>  <br><br><br><br>go to tumblr you shipping nigger faggots</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's coolman229, he doesn't listen to reason. Just ignore &amp; report.</br>  <br> Doesn't make sense <br> A Titan known to be helping humanity </br></br>  <br>We are not shipping. YH is canon, we're just stating the obvious. The EHfag should go to tumblr though.</br>  <br>A noble still makes more sense.</br>  <br>You never know Anon. Maybe Connie really is a genius. Maybe mutinybowl is still on.</br>  <br>Coincidentally, Ymir is a noble (we know she is royalty).<br><br>So, will EHfags jump of a cliff when Isayama makes Historia marry the person she actually loves?</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe mutinybowl is still on <br>If what Jean said in the forest was foreshadowing, who would be the most likely to be killed by him?</br></br>  Lmfao at all these lil shipping fags, just a reminder that before they will even touch each other lips they will be dead already  <br>I hope you're talking about EHshitters / Eren only.</br>  <br>Erwin or Armin. <br>Maybe Levi if he's incapacitated/distracted.</br></br>  <br>lmfao this fucking faggot</br>  <br> calling a girl faggot <br>uhm</br></br>  MODS  <br> lmfao </br>  <br> Armin <br>He saved his ass too many times, I doubt Jean would ever turn on him like that.

So your comparison is moot.

That's hilarious.</br>  <br>I wish there was a short children's book with this plot. It would be the best.</br>  <br>They're correct in broad strokes, but skim over or exaggerate many details.<br><br>For example the reason the Japs win against Americans is because they're using exported high level accounts rather than newly created level 1. It's not enough to defeat the Chinese and the Koreans, though.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks like bullshit, but I believe it.</br>  I look forward for more doujins.  <br>It's from the webnovel. How much the author may change when all is said and done, is unknown. If past experience is something to go by, he'll dial back the numbers some at the least.</br>  <br>That sounds like both the dumbest shit ever and the most hilarious shit ever. 11/10 will watch every episode</br>  <br>Of course when they need players that have to be evil they get Americans, and when they need to save the day they get Japanese.<br><br>I get it, you guys are still sour that you lost.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, SAO is nothing but literally bad writing.<br><br>It started off really good but toward the end of the first arc it just went down the shitter.</br></br></br>  <br>this is just dumb enough to make me think it's real</br>  <br>It was only good for the first episode.<br><br>Also the books SAO II was based off of were actually decent (except any time Kirito was in them), but A-1 fucked up their adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br> except any time Kirito was in them <br>As the protagonist, was that not a frequent occurrence?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm still waiting for the new Cior doujin, it came out june 14th.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/817410/069ec2<wbr>25ec/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He shouldn't have been the protagonist of GGO (and even then it was arguable, since Sinon effectively carried 90% of that arc herself while Kirito was off playing Jedi), and he really was not the protag of Mother Rosario, though I'd stopped watching the anime before that point so I have no idea how they adapted that arc.<br><br>I know they missed their chance at ending SAO II on the cliffhanger of Johny Black killing Kirito, so they fucked up on that.</br></br></br>  <br>So we get to see Kirito be killed by desu gun?<br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>They didnt say that though. Everyone was jsut asking for the next season of their favorite series and they we're give vague replies like as long as people show their support and theres enough material and they secure funds then it might happen.</br>  <br>There's a decent chance we might not see SAO III. The next arc is a mess that's looking to be longer than the rest of the series before it (meaning there's no chance they can adapt the arc in a single season). Splitting an arc between seasons can't be appealing for a show that tries to get through two arcs a season.</br>  <br> Project Alicization <br><br>I can't wait for A-1 to blow the animation budget on Kirito and Eugeo whittling down that giant tree and halfass everything else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Lumberjack HYPE</br></br>  <br>The most Sakuga tree-chopping action you'll ever see.</br>  <br>SAO makes Naruto look like the AOTD that is how shitty SAO is.</br>  <br>Yeah. I like SAO</br>  It amazes me how popular SAO is and .Hack is still considered shit.  I actually liked most of what I read of Alicization.<br><br>And then you find out how the arc went in the web novel.</br></br>  <br>It's still possible to change it for the LN.</br>  <br>Anime adaptations of .Hack are ultra shit while SAOs at least are more than just talking and walking on the town.</br>      <br><br> Of course when they need players that have to be evil they get Americans, and when they need to save the day they get Japanese. <br><br>If it's a chinese story, then both americans and japanese are the bad guys and at least some americans will get killed in real life when they come over to try their violence spiel as they do with all countries.</br></br></br></br>  What if instead of animating Alicization, they animate Progressive?  <br>Not enough material yet.</br>  <br>yet another rapist psichopat villain</br>  <br>It's obvious from a business point of view, normies eat this shit up.</br>  <br>No raping this time, just psychopaths.</br>   Monogatari has the main couple get together early and fuck but still has a ton of girls that want the MCs D. <br> Popular, full adaption. <br> SAO has the main couple get together early and fuck but still has a ton of girls that want the MCs D. <br> Popular, full adaption. <br>Are psuedo-harems with sex the wave of the future? I welcome this change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't really rape people, he just gets turned on when eating delicious souls.</br>  Never watched the second half of season 2, but I heard the only player better than Kirito dies of AIDS.  <br>That's about right, I guess.</br>  <br> SAO III <br>Didn't SAO II bomb?</br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, they might be able to scrounge up enough material if they mix the manga and LN versions for the anime.<br><br>There's no way if they go with just the novels though.</br></br></br>  <br>asuna a cute<br>cute!</br></br>    I'm excited, SAO gets a lot of hate, but I enjoy it quite a bit.<br><br>To hear that they'll be adapting the novels probably to the end is great, I can't wait for Alicization to begin.</br></br>  <br>The only thing ever good to come out of this is BUN BUN art, and now we have YYY so SAO is unneeded.</br>  <br>GLOP</br>  <br>huh, I just marathoned the first two seasons. I'm actually pretty glad it's getting more eps.</br>  <br>abec isn't bunbun</br>  <br> Didn't SAO II bomb? <br>It's average sales are going to work out to be in the 15-20k range, closer to 20k than 15k. That's lower than the first season, but far from bombing.</br></br>  I just want my Progressive animu.  <br>Excited for more doujins of Asuna.</br>  <br> Whole series  <br>Accel World deserved this, not shitty SAO. Stupid nips.</br></br>  <br> more Asuna <br>Yes, please.<br><br> wearing swimsuit in onsen <br>Dammit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Himura Kiseki is giving Kirito characterization by making him a clon of Toori Aoi from Horizon?<br>That's pretty lame.</br></br>  <br>*clone</br>  LNfags, are there more rape attempts in the future to look forward to?  Reminder that Asuna is also a shit character.<br><br>Started off as a competent, badass guild leader, then quickly degraded to a delicate housewife and stayed that way ever since. Give me a fuckin' break.<br><br>At least Kirito actually has some aspirations going towards adult life  even if his motivations involve his shitty virtual daughter. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kinda because Asuna was filthy rich her whole life and never felt envious of others in terms of aspirations. She just wanted more freedom, so until she actually acquires it from her dad and lives her life the way she wants it's unrealistic to judge her from your standards when you wouldn't even make enough salary to fit her pocket change.</br>  <br> Are you excited yet? <br>For the doujins, yes.</br></br>  <br>Nigga what exactly is wrong with her choice? She's rich enough to not live a shit life, and all she needs to do is not get shafted by her mom.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>This. I don't give a shit about anything past them getting out of Aincrad.</br>  I just want my Accel World s2.<br><br>Fuck SAO.</br></br>  <br><br>And where do you suppose it ends up by the third season...and the fourth. A-1 strikes me as a studio with no identity or sense of how to pace it's production. They'll just recklessly take on project after project after project and say they'll do anything and everything all at the same time right here and right now and whatever happens with regard to the quality so damn what as long as the license is popular and it'll guarantee them some form of return. I've never seen a studio pretend to give so much of a shit and act like they can please everyone when they clearly don't at all otherwise they'd slow the fuck down already.</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>Many studios do this. They gotta make quick LNbucks to save up for their real shit.</br>  <br>At least half the anons that batch against SAO wants more about the better work of Kawahara, me included.</br>  <br> Started off as a competent, [occupation], then quickly degraded to a delicate housewife <br>so a normal girl?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is happening in Progressive?</br>  ONO KENSHO FOR EUGEO.<br><br>PLEASE, A-1.</br></br>  <br> Things. </br>  <br>Pretty much. It's acutally  really good </br>   tfw it's has few trap Kirito doujin <br>I just want my mind broken Kririto being cum inside. God damn it, eleven</br>  <br>God dammit Himura.  Picked up. <br><br>How are the original LNs? I only read First Day years ago, before forgetting about them.</br></br></br>  <br>What was she supposed to do after being freed from SAO, join the army or something?</br>  <br>Oh this is real all right and it will be Oni-Sama levels of glorious.</br>  <br>Fairly decent, though I haven't gotten around to getting past part way through Rondo of a transient sword. Argo gets a decent bit of screen time by virtue of being a technically established character that Reki was free to do almost anything except he wasn't free to have her fall for Kirito. Kibaou gets to show up as a somewhat antagonistic guy who is otherwise a leader in the push to clear Aincrad. Asuna doesn't get quite the prominence and development she gets in the manga adaption, but that may change past the point I've read.</br>  <br>Some business crap and marry a richer guy she will not love to please the jew mom because muh shekels.<br><br>They're already rich enough to live life as it is.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=InB<wbr>Xu-iY7cw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Elegant rape will be the best thing to happen to /a/.</br>  <br>Progressive's manga and LN take completely different paths, but ultimately reach the same conclusion.<br><br>Asuna is the protagonist in the manga, and Kirito is the protagonist for the LN version.<br><br>Also, Laughing Coffin's been fucking around since the first floor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He should of never left the first game and just written about all 100 floors.</br>  <br>That's Progressive, progressing at the rate of 1 novel a year, covering 1 floor per novel.</br>  <br>It's not rape if it's Asuna.</br>  <br>I can't wait to watch all this garbage on toonami.</br>  <br> swimsuit in the bath <br>barbarians</br></br>  <br> expecting elves to be civilized <br>till though,it seems like Kawahara/abec are actually making her boobs smaller in the progressive LN adaptation.<br><br>I'm going to be honest,if Kizumel was my waifu,it would be hard not to become part of an anti clearer group.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Laughing Coffin did nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br> marrying an NPC <br>wait,wut?<br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br></br></br>   New Tomo-chan out <br>I want to protect a Tomboys bare thighs</br>  I want to lick them.  <br>Oh, yes.</br>  Tomboys are for<br> Getting in fights with <br> Playing sports with them <br> Holding them close and telling them you love them <br> Accepting all of her girlish sensibilities, no matter how much she hates you finding out about them <br> Patting their heads <br> Holding her hand in public <br> Making them try on cute dresses when you're out on a date even though you know she'll never buy one <br> Encouraging them to try on sexy black lace lingerie, only for her to wear spats over them <br> Marriage <br> Carrying her over the threshold of your new home to start a life together <br> Gently laying her down on the bed <br> Whispering into her ear how much she means to you while caressing her toned body <br> Spending an entire night making passionate love to each other <br> Raising a new generation of tomboys with <br>These are the things that tomboys are for</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   fainting after seeing her panties <br><br>this guy.</br></br>  <br> Getting pegged by. </br>  she pulling her skirt down is almost criminal  <br> black and blue </br>  When will we be getting pants wearing Tomo.

This is your honest opinion, anon?</br></br>  <br>Yes, I am despicable. But that doesn't change the fact that Jun and Misuzu have way better chemistry in their limited panel time than Jun and Tomo. Besides, I also like Jun and Tomo, so I'm all for a threesome ending.</br>  <br>Heart boner maximum level.<br><br>She's so cute last panel.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I'm only seeing Misuzu wanting to help her two close friends get together, I'm not seeing any sexual chemistry between her and Jun. She teases them both because she is friends with them and is confident that they like each other, not because she wants the D.</br>  <br>  threesome ending. <br>Not sure who sould i feel about this, for one part Misuzu is a total qt and so is Tomo but in the other hand i like who slowly but smoothly thngs are going on with Jun and Tomo</br></br>  <br>The lust between the is barely one step from taking psychical form in an orgy of hatesex.

They know exactly what to say and do to most effectively hurt each other the most. They probably know the worst things about each other and yet they still interact with one another. It's incredibly hard to continue to hate someone unless there's a deep underlying reason for it. The fact they're childhood friend makes me think that something had happened between the two of them at one point. I could be wrong and this is just a normal love story between Jun and Tomo, but from all those anime/manga I've read/watch, I can't shake the feeling that there is something between Jun and Misuzu.<br><br>I mean, take this page when Jun describes his ideal dating partner.

Just kidding, girls doesn't exist in the internet</br>  <br> Spats are power limiters </br>  <br>He's not disgusted, he's trying to run away from his lewd thoughts. His brain can't process it and snaps when he starts feeling attracted to Tomo.</br>  <br>Partially that, plus the awkward blush of a cute Tomboy who is feeling the air blow on her bare firm thighs inevitably gives all men the urge to breed</br>  <br>Jun needs to see more of Tomo's feminine charm in order to realise his true feelings.

And I like it. I wonder if she'd show me them if I begged her.</br></br>  Pool chapter when?<br>Beach chapter when?</br>  Anime when?     Practice karate with Tomo <br> She's much better than you at it <br> She manages to knock you on your ass <br> Before you can get a chance to get up, she lunges at you, grappling you on the floor <br> You feel her breasts push against you <br> Her sweat mixing with yours <br> She starts to breathe heavily </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Don't hit the guy <br> You'll be just like him </br></br>  <br> Tomo-chan anime done by Love Lab team <br>Whoa whoa WHOA</br></br>        <br>Who would be a good seiyuu for Tomo?<br><br>Tomatsu Haruka?</br></br></br>  <br> Tomo has the same VA <br>Make it happen Godakobo</br></br>  <br>Every page she's in she becomes best girl even more.</br>  <br> Don't hit the guy <br> You'll get garbage on your fists </br></br>  <br>Misuzu a good girl</br>    <br>Gonna have to agree with the guy. She looks silly being as tall and unkempt as she is wearing a short skirt and visible spats like an 8-year old.<br>Go either knee length or just wear pants.</br></br>  <br> don't hit the guy <br> he can present charges against you </br></br>  <br><br>how about sawashiro</br></br>    the jokes are getting old already because the guy is an insufferable homosexual. it' s pissing me off    So if Tomo had the courage to confess her love to him, why can't she simply explain that she's IN LOVE with him?  <br><br>Which one? They're all best girls.<br><br>I does take something special to be as best as a tomboy though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How the flying fuck can you say you love your waifu if you aren't willing to put forth effort into becoming a passable husbando?</br></br>  <br>Misuzu, obviously.</br>  Would you risk getting beat up to stare at these wonderful things?    <br> Sawashiro Miyuki <br><br>Hmm, that's real, she's good too.<br><br>Between Ranmaru and Kanbaru, who is more Tomo?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> you will never fuck her while she has this smug look </br>  <br>Not that anon but what the flying fuck is a passable husbando for 2D waifus?</br>  <br><br>If I kissed Misuzu's feet and let her stomp on me, do you think she'd give me Tomo's spats?<br><br>I'll take one for the team guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can't just work up that kind of courage on command. It gets harder the more she has to talk about it.</br>  OH GOD  <br><br>Misuzu has some ninja skills.</br></br>  <br>In love with her and actively working to become better for her.</br>  <br>Komatsu Mikako would be literally perfect though<br><br>That's the first one that came to mind, Sawashiro sounds a little too old for Tomo.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>See </br>  <br> she will never bend you over and fuck you while she has that smug look </br>  <br><br>Maaya Sakamoto? I'm thinking her Lal'c voice from diebuster but more rough.</br></br>  <br>That's not my fetish.</br>  <br>Every aspect that you improve contributes to improvement of your total self. A better body is by definition an improvement. If your waifu loves you then she will support an attempt at self-improvement even if it means your body ending up as something that's not necessarily her personal physical ideal.</br>  <br><br>Too bad, it's mine.</br></br>    <br>this manga is bad for my heart</br>  <br>Huh, really? Well, it's not mine either, it just seemed like the logical next step in the shitpost chain.</br>  <br>When you make a daily routine of trolling you kinda have to.</br>  <br>No no, see, Misuzu belongs to me.</br>  <br>You're wasting your breath, anon. Neckbeards who are too lazy and pathetic to improve themselves even for their so called waifus aren't going to listen.</br>  <br><br>How come Jun is able to push her out into the rain and steal her scrunchies then?</br></br>  <br>That's for only self-satisfaction, you're not even thinking about her at all. That is 3DPD logic.<br><br>Love is about accepting even yours and you're waifu's imperfections.</br></br></br>  <br>She's far too small for the amazon position,anon. Or are you as much of a manlet as her or are you imagining yourself as a shota or something, holy shit, are you a pervert.</br>  <br>Because when you've been trolled enough, you develop the skills to actually get them. Tomboy doesn't get trolled as harshly as Jun does.</br>  <br>She lets him. Look at , she clearly could see it coming but didn't even try to avoid it. I think she has a little smile in the other two, too.</br>  <br>I think it's more she just accepts it as tit for tat. Her bant game is pretty strong.</br>  <br>Love is about getting rid of your imperfections because you know she should have nothing less than perfection.</br>  <br>So are you trying to say that she's actually M?</br>  <br> Misuzu with a ponytail </br>  <br><br><br><br>wait a minute is she getting off on this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>nope, asymmetrical sidetail + scrunchie is clearly superior</br>  <br><br>She's holding back for Tomos sake. What a good friend.</br></br>  <br>For Jun.</br>  <br>Hm, that I can actually agree. Yeah, I see your point now.</br>  <br>No more.</br>  <br>She just likes watching him being massively butthurt. The only reason she's not smiling in the rain one is because her getting wet is actually a problem compared to being able to just pick the scrunchie back up or a harmless forehead flick.</br>  <br>she's trying to get her friends together, so she plays the part of the bad guy</br>  <br><br>So she's angling for a three-way?</br></br>  <br>The way they both look in the rain one gives me the feel that she's saying "yeah, I went too far" with her eyes.</br>  <br><br>Really?<br><br>I got more of a 'Ha! Joke's on you! I was already wet!' vibe from her there</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahuh. You don't fucking pull the NTR card.</br>    How long is it going to take until we get a doujin of this?<br><br>  pls? ;_; </br></br>  <br><br>A few months after the anime airs</br></br>  <br>Considering the artist himself has done other doujins in the past, probably not too long before he takes the dive.</br>  <br>Look into these eyes. They convey the heat of anger, quickly cooled by a wave of acceptance and understanding.</br>  What would you think was happening here if you saw it out of context?  <br><br>That they'd be fucking in the storage shed within five minutes</br></br>  <br>This is actually one of the only Mangas I would want to be adapted, would be pretty hard to fuck it up.<br>  Maybe a 10-13 episode 5 min short series? </br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter. The sexual tension there is so dense you could walk up between them and physically take it, then go home with it.</br>  <br>Sexual tension. Either two lovers who just had an intense fight or a pair of childhood friends who just reunited immediately after they both experienced separate tragedies and are about to admit their love for each other.</br>  <br>That they are going to start hatefucking each other any minute now.</br>  <br>Well, there is a guy looking at a girl with eyes of contempt, while the girl is looking at him as if she is pondering something.<br>Out of context I would probably say they are brother and sister.</br></br>    <br>English mothefucker!</br>  <br><br>STANDING HERE</br></br>  <br>What about it?</br>  <br>I'd say that is probably a shoujo manga of a lonely bitter girl and a lonely "his face is scary" boy who just met, and he'll offer her his umbrella or something.</br>  <br> tomboy <br> girlish sensibilities <br><br> Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't you mean UNTIL IT FINDS MY DREAMS HAVE DISAPPEARED</br>  <br>Why did he faint from panties? Did they smell?</br>  <br> implying jun is the MC </br>  <br><br>His boner sucked all the blood away from his brain</br></br>  <br>Damn, Tomo just about straight-up killed the bitch.</br>  <br>Prelude to a school-wide chase scene.</br>  <br>I've had balls punted at my head harder than that. It would stun her, but she'd be fine.</br>  <br>He'd need to have a foot long thick boner for that to happen.</br>  <br><br>Spoken like a man who's never had a tomboy take her spats off for you.</br></br>  i can see it already<br> anime soon </br>  <br>I wish for that too.<br><br>More when?</br></br></br>  <br>yeah me too<br><br> 5 minute episodes </br></br></br>  <br>This needs to be a 4chan banner.</br>  <br>Which studio/s would actually do it justice though</br>  <br>From all 90 pages that have been posted so far, there's hardly enough material for one episode if that.</br>  <br>The real question:<br><br> Yuu Kobayashi or Miyuki Sawashiro? </br></br></br>  <br>Is this a monthly or weekly manga?

Especially in porn, the idea is you want to get involved with that. If there's no vector for doing so, it's pointless. Yuri is nothing but a turn off unless it exists solely for the arousal of a male character.<br><br>In the case of this manga, Tomo and Jun's singular true love is the main attraction, with Misuzu's sideline commentary and past with the two of them being a secondary one.

In the first place, I think most people will drop it like a brick if the main relationship is disrupted. Everyone came here for a genuine tomboy love series and it's pretty clear that's what the artist set out to draw.

It doesn't affect the source material and you're being autistic by giving a shit about it.</br></br>    <br>Futa on dark skinned female will forever be the best.<br> 23 will never make a sequel ;_; </br></br>    <br>It's not going to.</br>  <br>what kind of faggot are you?!</br>  <br><br>You're here for the wrong reasons, yurifag.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather he do yuri with his married pair and I don't usually seek out yuri</br>  <br>Also explains why it's so rare. mtf threesome very rarely ever a decent tag, which is such a shame. At least with most of Sanagi's works being futa recently(if he ever has another chapter anyway) there might be another chance. <br><br><br>futa on tomboy is the only thing that could top it. Kind of fits into futa on dark skin though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't he have the futa chick marry the tanned girl? Thought he had a wedding pic with her.</br>  <br>No. Based on the cover, every girl had her boy. Or will have, in case of Misuzu. I don't even know how she'll get with that boy.</br>  <br>He threw the hair tie so she would go get it. The chapter was called go away or something</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br> I don't even know how she'll get with that boy. <br><br>I believe in genkibro.</br></br></br>  <br>Futa girl is blue haired. He does snapshots of the married yuri couple.  They got engaged when Japan won the women's world cup, so this must be a sad day. </br>  <br><br>The shipping was already predetermined.</br></br>  <br>Too bad that guy friend of Tomo would, huh?</br>  <br>Misuzu NTR Jun when Tomo force to watching when ?</br>  <br>Speaking of which, if there is a hypothetical women's world cup anime ala Whistle!, how would they animate Carli Lloyd and that beautiful mid-field hat-trick goal?</br>  <br>Fuck off NTR and crackshipfags. This is a lovely romantic comedy, not a venue for your shit fetishes.</br>  <br><br><br>yeah worst is when they're not tagged properly.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/531204/745177<wbr>984c/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wow This guy sucks at coloring.</br>  <br>Wow, this manga is nice. Where is it serialized and how?</br>  <br> JunxTomo <br> childhood friends, clearly close to each other, considerate to each other <br> MisakixCarol <br> childhood friends, promise to marry each other as a child, girl is clearly jealous of Misaki when he's close to the tomboy <br> MisuzuxThat boy <br> the boy's too familiar with her, she abuses him <br><br>How is Misuzu's love story going to proceed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you not know what "read the fucking thread" means?</br>  This strip is addictive. Have the translations caught up with the Japanese releases yet?  <br>I did read like 1/3 of the thread and found no info on that.</br>    <br>Can always add the tag, I thought I did before to that one unless someone voted it down. Oh konmori why do you cater to every single one of my fetishes.</br>  <br>That didn't help either. Brings out all the manga reading sites and nothing more. It isn't in any sort of database either.</br>  <br> anime <br> of a webcomic <br>Maybe if the author had actually published something before and had a known professional body of work, like Cool Kyoushinsha.<br><br>It'd be cool if he sold a tank of this after he made enough pages, though.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> what is One-Punch Man </br>  <br>With a different guy.</br>  <br>Something that got officially published before it became an anime.<br><br>Also a very, very, VERY far out outlier.</br></br></br>  <br>bato.to<br>search for Tomo</br></br>  <br>I like yuri romance, but I can't get off to it. My dick doesn't register it as sex.</br>  <br>Maybe you should read some of the descriptions of those manga reading sites.</br>  <br>One punch man caught the attention of a very well known and established mangaka though who did the art. You can't really compare the two.</br>  <br><br>If this gets famous enough it'll get published as well.</br></br>  How does she not just scream the obvious at him  <br>Well that was easy, thanks anon!</br>    <br>One of them needs to have a dick, I'm sorry.<br><br>That, or it has to be really intense, like Softcharm.<br><br>That said, I love yuri romance a lot. I am undoubtedly a yurifag.<br><br><br>It and the author may be decently well known in porn communities/on 4chan, but I don't know about popularity in the East.<br><br>Literally, I don't know what nips think of him if they even know of him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> clubs in school aren't co-ed <br>So does Tomo have a special exception?</br></br>  <br><br>Know of any others anon? It like the swinging tag. It's very very rare to see it actually tagged in raw. though the lotte doujin was translated. So who knows.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br> One of them needs to have a dick, I'm sorry. <br> That said, I love yuri romance a lot. I am undoubtedly a yurifag. <br>Is your favorite tag female:dick growth?</br></br></br>  <br>I know she's in the boy's karate club, but I didn't see the specifics of the special exception she has.</br>  <br>If her just sparring with a girl one time was enough to mentally scar her for life I could see them making a special exception for her, yes. <br><br>Didn't know the author also does porn. Doesn't seem like a very adult-ish style. But if even Cool Kyoushinsha. can get porn published, who knows</br></br></br>  <br>How the hell are these two going to get together? Can't even see her giving him a chance.</br>  <br>Yes, since she scared all the girls and is better than all the boys. These things are usually separate for safety reasons.<br><br>There's another manga that's more down to earth about this girl who's a part of the boy's baseball club. Makes me think the rule is, like, unofficial in co-ed cases and if a female student really wants to be on the boys team, it'll be allowed.<br><br>That said, the girl in that manga isn't allowed to play in any official games.<br><br><br>Just futanari really. Doesn't have to grow in.<br><br><br> Didn't know the author also does porn. Doesn't seem like a very adult-ish style. <br>He does mostly porn going by what's on ex and very perverted porn at that, in some cases pretty hardcore as well. It's all doujinshi and therefore unpublished.<br><br>As for Kyoushinsha, I don't know if he ever got any of his porn published. It's not like having published porn has ever really stopped someone from going legit/getting an anime though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   slapping/groping your best bro's butt every morning <br><br>what.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they won't get together, then.</br>  <br>Desire sometimes slips out from underneath denial.</br>    <br>That's probably going to be the hardest romance the author's gonna have to deal with. The other couples are pretty acceptable. This on the other hand would have to have a lot of circumstances for love to bloom</br>    <br>Tomo-chan is already tall as fuck, does that mean Jun is a giant? He pretty much towers over her.</br>  <br>It hurts</br>  <br>He's pretty big.</br>  <br><br>God dammit what does she have to do sneak into his bedroom and put his dick in her mouth?</br></br>  <br>cool kyou shinja has been in Anthurium for a long time now. admittedly not doing porn often though. He seems like Sakurai Energy and mostly does non porn in porn magazines. If I look up Fumita on panda will I be scarred for life type porn or...?</br>  <br> _______ </br>  <br>I assume Tomo's around 5'10 and Jun's like 6'2 or 6'3.<br><br>Which are both pretty giant for Asian girl/guy standards.</br></br></br>  <br>Fumita does both heartwarming vanilla (one starring a tomboy) and run-of-the-mill rape. Doesn't have any sick fetishes like ryona or guro or scat or anything. Hadn't done the former for a while though.</br>  <br> implying he won't think it's a bro job </br>  <br>That would be a start.</br>  <br>It's just hardcore porn. It's not like going from Nanashi's fluffy Naruto/Hinata doujinshi to his horrifying sadomasochism works.</br>  <br><br>"What are you doing, bro? I'm not gay!"</br></br>  <br><br>/jp/ taught me this is normal for two guys.</br></br>  <br>BROS<br>DON'T<br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br> I swear if Tomo gets with anyone other than Jun I will fucking die a little inside. <br> childhood friend <br> tomboy <br>For all the ones that didn't win, she must win. She's the main girl so there's no excuse this time, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not knowing about bro jobs </br></br>  <br> pull down spats <br> lift up skirt <br> point to vagina <br> "Look!" </br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably dreams about being princess carried and stuff like that. I guess she's constantly wet for him considering her reactions to the frequent physical contact they have.</br>  <br>Don't worry, they'll be fucking by the halfway point.</br>  <br>No need to be mad, beta friend. Based nips will deliver it. Mark my words</br>  <br><br>His brain would explode and you know it</br></br>  He has to be doing this on purpose  <br>It's a good thing.</br>  <br>No, he's resisting the urge to flip the skirt up and fuck her there.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who liked the spats better? Short skirts do nothing for me but the spats accentuated her legs, and I'm a huge legfag.</br>  <br> Misuzu's yakuza father wants her to find a nice boy <br> enter Tanabe </br></br>  <br>She can do young, see Gekkan and also Inaba from that one anime. I love her voice.</br>  <br>You have to how perverted it must feel for her to have that sort of breeze.</br>  <br>You have imagine to how*</br>  <br>Even then it's for more of a Genki type tomboy while Tomo is more of a flustered tomboy.<br><br>If they did have Sawashiro I wouldn't complain since it's fucking Sawashiro but I still think there are better seiyuu for the role.</br></br></br>  <br><br>forget it</br></br>  <br>Hatred. Somebody wronged somebody and is paying for it.</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  So what is their first time having sex going to be like?  <br> Penis! <br> You have a penis! <br> I can show you where to put that penis! </br></br></br>  <br>Yes, more or less. I think there are a couple of untranslated pages but not another batch of 10.</br>  Who's the worst MC of all time?  Sorata was worse.  Not him you fcking faggot.  <br>Only a true faggot would think Saekano's MC wasn't a complete shit cunt.</br>  <br> Angry Tomoyafag </br>  Without a doubt.  <br><br>He was super entertaining.</br></br>  <br>he was a shit and he was unable to do anything productive with that game of his dreams, damn,</br>  <br>WA2's MC was even worse.</br>  <br> he hasn't read the LNs <br><br>See you for Season 2.</br></br></br>  WHO IS HIKARU ICHIJO FOR 1000, ALEX!  <br>OUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOO<br><br>Literally autistic.</br></br></wbr></br>  Your favorite MC.  <br><br>Would you be okay with your waifu getting NTR'd?</br></br>  <br>Sorry I didn't know you were Autistic and could relate to him.</br>  <br>At least he didn't pick that whore Minmay.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Nope, hell even WA1 <br>was way worse than 2.</br></br>   inb4 Shinji   <br><br>Cuck</br></br>    <br>At least he chose best girl.</br>  Madoka. <br> muh wish <br>For twelve fucking episodes.

Are they trying to recreate Shinji? Shinji only works because of his glorious harem.</br>  <br>WTF</br>  <br>I know what the point was.

And they seem to be setting up Ibusaki/Ryoko recently as well.</br></br></br>  <br>From that LN bit anon translated, yeah you can't ignore Ryouko's feelings for smoke.</br>  <br> Superior tsundere <br> fucking cute <br> probably really pure <br> only wants to be Souma's rival <br><br>Others girls wouldn't have stood a chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to  kiss  Meat's delicious golden thighs </br>  <br>I am interested.

Final boss (not including Souma's dad) will be either Aldini or the current first seat.  <br> best 3 turn out as <br> 1. soma 2. erina 3. dad </br></br>  <br>are you fucking retarded?<br><br>Final boss is the head-master and it will be a shougeki to free erina from her bloodline</br></br></br>  <br>How does Erina make everything so erotic? I swear she could make an astronaut suit bonerific</br>  <br>If the manga ends soon after Souma graduates, the final boss will likely to be 3rd year Erina if it isn't Souma's dad.<br><br>Senzaemon will probably be an extra boss though.</br></br></br>  Souma will never be the #1. <br><br>Erina will. He'll be the #2. <br><br>But through his ventures versus and with her, their relationship will deepen. <br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if the writing is good;<br> soma will mindbreak erina into liking his pleb food and admitting he's as good as she is..   this during the moment she is impregnated by him </br></br>  <br> Aldini <br>top kek anon</br></br>  Erina is a bitch.<br><br>I got so mad when she bullied Loli Alice.</br></br>  <br> Childhood friend <br>Literally who?</br></br>  <br> not understanding that him being his first rival and the one that made him understand why he was at Tootsuki makes him important <br>Anon, please.</br></br>  <br>the weak should fear the strong</br>  <br>Kurase.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Few.

And him jobbing doesn't help the case either.<br><br>Every one in the Academy is a possible Rival for Souma. Erina will be the Number 1 Rival for him.</br></br></br>  <br>As a masochist, there's a difference between a dom and a bitch, she's just a bitch.</br>  <br>  she's just a bitch. <br>Sure at the early stages of the manga but please do tell me how she's a bitch now ?</br></br>  <br> getting bullied by a loli <br>nah Alice is beta</br></br>  <br>She stole Alice's teddy bear you evil fuck.</br>  <br> wahhh she stole the teddy bear <br>I want Charles Foster Kane to leave.<br><br>And I'm pretty sure it was a doll, a fucking ugly doll at that, I don't get why they were fighting over it.
