[ I assume most /a/nons know as much Japanese as a 2-3 year old Nip baby (if they still exist).<br><br>How do you translate this? Do you leave it as 'onigiri,' since the food is Japanese in a Japanese setting, and so in context the viewer can know what it is? Do you call it a 'rice ball,' since it's made of rice and it's somewhat circular, although 'onigiri' means 'grasp?' Or do you completely 'localize' it and call it a jelly-filled donut?</br></br>   jelly-filled donut <br><br>What the fuck?</br></br>  "Jelly Donut" isn't a localization, it's just bullshit.<br><br>Rice ball is what we call them in English, so either that or Onigiri if you have a weeb audience.</br></br>  Onigiri in subs, manga, or LN, rice ball in a dub.  <br> What are the 1990s? </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vWg<wbr>xH2KG4ts</wbr>  [ ]</br>  The Japanese have borrowed a plethora of English words, to the point where create English terms that aren't even used in English (or in America, anyways).<br><br>What we in America call a 'salisbury steak' in Japan is called a 'hambahgah.' If the word 'HAMBAHGAH' is spoken loudly and clearly, should the subs simply leave it as 'hamburger' or should they say "Salisbury steak?"<br><br><br>Summer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the most well-known localization of all time.</br>  <br> What we in America call a 'salisbury steak' in Japan is called a 'hambahgah.' If the word 'HAMBAHGAH' is spoken loudly and clearly, should the subs simply leave it as 'hamburger' or should they say "Salisbury steak?" <br>Salisbury steak is hambaagu. Hamburger is hambaagaa.</br></br>  <br>Pretend you're a bong and call it hamburger.</br>  <br>I prefer "Hamburg steak." Although it's a slightly different dish from Salisbury steak, it makes more sense as a translation of the Japanese word and Japs probably don't know the difference between the two anyway.</br>   a 2-3 year old Nip baby (if they still exist) <br><br>5 star post.</br></br>  <br>pretty much this, it should be as close as possible to the original name but shouldn't sound retarded when spoken, pretty much like honorifics</br>  Why is it called a rice-ball when it's clearly a rice-triangle?  <br>who the fuck doesnt know what onigiri is</br>  There are only rough equivalents for honorific suffixes: -san, -sama, -kun, -chan, etc. It may be proper for to adults to call each other Mr. X and Ms. Y (X-san, Y-san). However, -san is commonly used between students, and even in Britain kids don't call it other Mr. X and Ms. Y, just X and Y if not their first names. You can't localize two students calling each other '-san' since no such convention exists in anglophone countries.<br><br><br>Nips suck at English anyways, and subs mix the two anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>Rice ball makes sense. When I make onigiri at home and eat them at home, I call them onigiri, because the people I'm talking to know what they are. If someone randomly asks me what I'm eating after seeing me eat one, I'll call them rice balls because I don't assume they know what they are. They obviously don't if they're asking. <br><br>Likewise, you shouldn't assume your audience knows Japanese things just because they're watching Japanese anime. They obviously don't speak Japanese or they wouldn't be downloading subtitles. Onigiri would be weeb subs, a special kind of stupid that's kind of cute. <br><br>Jelly doughtnut is jut plain retarded, unless you're actually going to edit the footage to make it into a jelly doughnut.

You're just making your own arguments look more and more retarded. I hope that's the point.</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, the weeaboo "translation" doesn't translate at all, but since it's a JAPANESE food in JAPANESE cartoon usually in a JAPANESE setting, calling it "onigiri" wouldn't be out of place, and the viewer (assuming they're not retarded) can tell from context what an ONIGIRI is.</br>  <br>And 'onigiri' isn't a name/propernoun?</br>  <br>No one is arguing that you aren't a cute stupid weeb. <br><br><br>That's correct.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No one is arguing that you aren't a cute stupid weeb. <br> saying this after trying to show off your shitty japanese <br><br>Anyway it would be onigiri in restaurants, so it's stupid to change it. I've never heard anyone say "rice ball"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With such shit art, the fonts and translation must be similarly shitty.</br></br>  <br>90% of the time there's no reason to not translate it to rice ball. <br><br>In fact there's only two scenarios where I'd leave it untranslated.<br><br>1: the show is steeped in Japanese culture, so leaving cultural foods and other things with their Japanese names would be an aesthetic choice to add to the atmosphere. Doing this, you are basically opting to make the subs less accessible to EOPs for the sake of making an artistic choice.<br><br>2: it's a series I've read the source material for and I know there's a puns later on that make use of the Japanese names of food, including Onigiri. In this case, I'd probably err on keeping the Japanese names of food items to make translating the pun easier because I'm not good at localizing puns. <br><br>The important thing in translation though is to be consistent. Don't switch between terms, and don't mix and match Japanese and English terms for similar things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have very very VERY rarely seen onigiri drawn in such a way that I would be able to tell what it is just from looking. Likewise, characters very very VERY rarely talk about the onigiri itself in any sort of way other than calling it FUCKING OISHII IN MY MOUTH so there's no context to tell that it's a palm-chaped blob of rice, or that the darker thing is a piece of seaweed, or that it usually has some sort of filling.<br><br><br> showing off <br><br>Okay then. I guess not being as retarded as you are is showing off now. I don't even speak Japanese. I know a few words here and there is all. That doesn't mean I can't explain why English subtitles should contain English words.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    I tend to translate nearly everything, except for stuff like "onii-chan" because that's just too cute.  <br>  I don't even speak Japanese <br>Yes, that is clear.<br> That doesn't mean I can't explain why English subtitles should contain English words. <br>It's also clear that you don't know English. or realize how many "English" words are actually from other languages.</br></br></br></br>  <br> or realize how many "English" words are actually from other languages. <br>Please stop talking.</br></br>  <br>That's a pretty childish way to try to get out of a lost argument.</br>  <br>What do loan words have to do with this? If the word is a loan word, then you obviously wouldn't need to translate it because it's already an English word. Onigiri is not such a word. Just because you use it all the time at restaurants because you're a fucking weeb trying to show off to the sushi slave doesn't suddenly make it an English word. <br><br><br>No one lost any argument here. Not even you. No one made any. You're just being stupid and saying a bunch of stupid shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Based commie.<br><br><br>But it's true. Even simple geographical terms like "mountain river valley" aren't even native English, it's from French&gt;Latin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty selective about referential pronouns when I translate. I also tend to leave "onii-chan" in, cause like you said it's cute, but because the English equivalents sound stilted to me. <br><br>But I don't have the same isuse with translating Kaa-san and tous-an to mom and dad. With oji-san I can go either way. I think oji-san sounds better than "uncle ____" personally, but since I speak Japanese my opinion is skewed.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a native Jap speaker?</br>  <br><br>Please stop talking until you learn how languages work, this is embarrassing. You are like a LING 101 student desperately trying to impress people because you just found out about etymology. Please read the chapters in your textbook about assimilated diction.</br></br>  <br>No, I'm native English, but I've been speaking Japanese for about 10 years now, translating for about 7. I mostly just do personal projects when I feel like it because I don't want it to become an obligation or a job, then I'll feel bad when I inevitably back out.</br>  <br>Please stop talking until you learn how translation works, this is embarrassing.</br>  <br>Call it rice ball.</br>  <br> if they still exist <br><br>That's pretty funny OP, I got a good chuckle from that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I also prefer using "mom/mommy", "dad/daddy", "mister/uncle/auntie", etc, while leaving TL notes if needed.</br>  <br>I translate though. I speak German in addition to Japanese and English. I also studied linguistics back in college. You sound exactly like every freshman who just took his first intro class.</br>  <br>This isn't about how languages work, it's about whether to translate a simple word or not. <br><br><br>So should there be a TL note briefly explaining what an onigiri is? Or does that 'disrupt your immersio?'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think German food names like 'Bratwurst' and 'Sauerkraut' should be left as is or translated?</br>  <br>I try to avoid TL notes cause I tend to overwrite them, and then if I'm working with an editor they often complain that I'm trying to fit a mini-Japanese lesson in the margins.</br>  <br>Holy shit, how can someone be this fucking new.</br>  <br>If you think translating food names is bad then you're probably a terrible translator.<br><br>If you actually think "rice ball" is better then I hope you have good alternatives for things like escargot ad hors douvres</br></br></br>  <br> So should there be a TL note briefly explaining what an onigiri is? Or does that 'disrupt your immersio?' <br><br>No, the Japanese word should just be translated in the English subtitles. How is this difficult to understand?</br></br></br>  <br> they often complain that I'm trying to fit a mini-Japanese lesson in the margins. <br>When that happens I keep that stuff in the credits page anyway. If people get interested they'll read it at the end.</br></br>  <br>Stop being an autist, its a rice ball.</br>  <br>TL: onigiri is a riceball with filling<br>Of course, you could just call it a riceball.<br><br><br>Should 'omelette au fromage' be 'cheese omelette'?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you seriously this fucking stupid that you don't know what a loan word is?</br></br>  <br>Those words are assimilated into English, they are effectively English words. You can't translate what is already English, there's nothing to translate. It's like asking me to translate origami, tsunami, sushi, doppelganger, etc.</br>  <br>Yes because that's an English translation of the French word that ISN'T an English loan word.</br>  <br>I didn't say that though? I said it's embarrassing that you're acting like etymologies are the same thing as borrowed words.</br>  <br>  It's like asking me to translate origami, tsunami, sushi <br>Holy fucking shit those are all JAP words. And sushi is a food that could be translated as 'sourrice!' And anyone can tell from context what sushi is!</br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omele<wbr>tte<br>Omelet has a wiki page.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_<wbr>ball<br>Rice ball tells you to go to the page for onigiri<br><br><br> you're acting like etymologies are the same thing as borrowed words. <br>Are you implying those aren't borrowed words?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Those are words, in both English and Japanese. Holy shit, your retardation is the funniest thing on /a/ right now. Thanks.</br>  Now for the one million question: ビッチ (Bicchi) to "Bitch" or "Slut"?<br> Most people get the fucking answer wrong holy shit just damn </br>  <br>Yeah, but in my case I'd just translate the term if if the note was too long, then add a note in the back for anyone interested. Better to give them a smooth read-through, instead of having to flip back to an appendix to figure out what the fuck a word means (I've seen a lot of translations that do this, especially LNs).</br>  <br>Those words are English words now. Notice your spellchecker doesn't flag sushi or tsunami or origami, yet it does onigiri. Because onigiri isn't a borrowed word that's been assimilated into English, but the other three mentioned have been. <br><br>This is what I mean by you confusing etymology with borrowed words.</br></br></br>  <br> they are effectively English words <br>You're so god damn retarded it's really hard to grasp.<br><br>But let's try to take another direction here: Do you think those words were used hundreds years back? No, they weren't. When people first started to call a tsunami a tsunami there, as well, were retards much like you who whined and cried all day that it should be translated. But it wasn't, it was assimilated into the English language. And this assimilation is still happening to this day. Words are still being adopted into other languages, because there just isn't a real suitable translation-alternative.<br>The same is happening with onigiri.<br><br>You sound like those retarded German language purism faggots who want the internet to be called "weltnetz" in German. Go kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's meaning is more like slut. It's literal translation is bitch, but the connotation for bitch is different in Japan, where it means a woman with loose morals/is very promiscuous.</br>  <br>No, I meant something like:<br> translate a name to english (ability, building, order, etc) <br> leave TL notes at the credits page explaining the naming choices/meanings. </br></br></br>  <br> Do you think those words were used hundreds years back? No, they weren't <br>And here we go again: you don't understand the difference between etymology and assimilated diction. <br><br>It doesn't matter what language a word comes from, once it's been naturalized into English, it's an English word. I use the spellchecker as a good indicator of what is accepted into English lexicon. Any default English spellchecker will not flag tsunami, or origami, or sushi, and you can even look up those words in an English dictionary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meinu, On'na, Bitchi, Mesu all work for Bitch.<br><br>I believe slut would be Chijo.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, it's all shades of gray, right? Unfortunately for you and your arguments, what constitutes the English language is actually in black and white, like on the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary, which does not have an entry for onigiri, but does have one for tsunami.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, that's exactly what I do now.</br>  <br>"Bitch" in heat.</br>  HONORIFICS<br>As pointed out earlier, it makes more sense to translate 'otou-san' and 'okaa-san' as father and mother, while "onii-chan" should probably be left since English equivalents sound awkward. Then there's the issue of students addressing each other as "-san" which shouldn't be translated as "Mr./Ms." (unless the girl is an ojou-sama). If a student clearly addresses another with just 'senpai,' should the subs say "Sempai/name-sempai/name/upperclass<wbr>man"?<br><br> origami, tsunami, sushi <br> English words <br><br><br>slut</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You know that the acceptation of those words is pretty arbitrary right?</br>  Oh look another fansub thread I won't even bother reading due to mandatory weeblords avidly defending their honorific shit. Fucking neo-/a/.   people who don't want "tsunami" translated as "tidal wave" <br><br>Fucking weebs go back to gaia</br></br>  Are you just so unmotivated to actually learn Japanese that you're hoping every single Japanese word becomes an English loan word? I mean, you're still going to have to learn them, man.  <br> ANIME AND MANGA <br> NO JAPANESE WORDS ALLOWED <br><br><br><br>This man is correct.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It makes more sense not to call dad, Dad. <br><br>Haha, sugoimonogatarioniichan.rmvb</br></br></br>  <br><br>How's that first week around here treating you neo-/a/?</br></br>  <br>Not really, it's based on popular usage. Dictionaries are first and foremost descriptive catalogs of popular language (as in, language as it is used by the people). Prescriptivists pretend like the dictionary isn't updated every few years to reflect popular usage, because they want language to be exactly the way it is in all the books they read. <br><br>The spell checkers and dictionary aren't perfect, there's some words that are popular in different social circles. Like zaibatsu. If you know anything about business, you probably are familiar with zaibatsu, but the general population might not. Where I live everybody knows about zaibatsu because Japanese own a lot of our businesses.</br></br></br>  <br>The issue isn't borrowing new words, it's simply leaving native words and terms in their native language if they can be understood through context. If 'onigiri' can be understood as a riceball, then a translation really isn't necessary. That's not the same as leaving a whole sentence untranslated.</br>  <br> if they can be understood through context. <br><br>Like onigiri? Really? How the fuck does context tell me what onigiri is? Show me an example, please. <br><br>Nevermind that it's still not an English translation because onigiri isn't an English word.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You do realize what you're saying is: "if some, alright, let's say most of the audience understands that particular word/meaning there's no need to translate it even if a translation is what you're doing" don't you?</br></br>  <br>Unfortunately we can't compare the spellcheck reaction to "onigiri" with that of "rice ball" since rice ball is just a combination of smaller more common words. But how about another example: Yellowtail sushi. The spell check trick marks it wrong, does that mean we shouldn't call it yellowtail? Is it better to just use the Japanese word in this case?<br><br><br>It's a food. That's all you need to know. "Rice ball" doesn't make it clear what it is either, beyond that it has rice in it.<br><br> It's clear you've never learned a second language.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> origami, tsunami, sushi <br> English words <br>They are. Your spellchecker didn't flag them, did it? Look them up in any English dictionary, they'll be listed.</br></br></br>  Hey did you guys know that in Japan they eat this shit called "onigiri" which is basically just a giant fucking marshmallow with a little dab of chocolate on the bottom? Looks fucking oishii in my eyes.  <br>See <br>It's just a type of food. We aren't arguing about "Senpai" here. Onigiri is something where all the important information is obvious just from the fact that it looks like it's made of rice and someone is eating it.</br></br>  <br>Tsunami in English refers specifically to abnormally large waves created by some disturbance of the ocean. The wikipedia page for "tidal waves" is literally called "tsunami", and the wiki specifically claims that tsunami is appropriate because the waves it refers to are not "tidal" in nature.<br><br>On the other hand, nobody knows what the fuck an "onigiri" is. Since I know "oni"s are those big sexy blue/red ogre ladies, and my friend who took judo wears a "gi", I can only presume that "onigiri" is some sort of bathrobe or belt for big sexy ogre ladies.<br><br>Disregarding my advanced knowledge of Japanese terms, I would presume that an "onigiri" is some kind of weapon or crushing device. Just my two cents as a non-faggaboo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At least 'Rice ball' tells you it has rice in it. In proper English, you know, the language you're translating in, 'Onigiri' tells you jack shit.</br></br>  <br> let's say most <br>I assume we're talking about fansubs, not CR/Funi; fansubs should cater to /a/udiences, who should know some simple Jap words.</br></br>  <br> Unfortunately we can't compare the spellcheck reaction to "onigiri" with that of "rice ball" <br>I wasn't comparing onigiri to rice ball, I was comparing it to naturalized Japanese words that are now English words. Compared to tsunami, sushi, etc, which the general English speaking population is familiar with and accepts as English, onigiri is not. It's absence in English dictionaries and spellcheckers is a sign of this.<br><br>I've already stated my position on translating it vs not translating it here <br><br>My opinion is that leaving it as "onigiri" is still very weebish and/or lazy most of the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody knows what the fuck an "onigiri" <br>And nobody can be bothered to learn one new word. Usually the word 'onigiri' is used in eating scenes, and unless there's an oni in a bathrobe eating 'onigiri,' I don't see your point.</br></br>  <br>But the CONTEXT, man. Doesn't it like, tell you that it's a ball of rice because someone is eating it?</br>  <br> And nobody can be bothered to learn one new word <br>Here you are tacitly admitting that it's not an English word. It's nonsensical to English speakers. Maybe 50 years down the line onigiri will be a naturalized part of English, but right now it's not. Nobody besides anime fans and Japanese cuisine enthusiasts knows what it means in the Anglosphere.</br></br>  <br>Not being bothered to learn new words is the entire point of subtitles.</br>  <br> "onigiri" is still very weebish and/or lazy most of the time <br><br>You could call any words leftover for flavoring as well as honorifics lazy translation since it's just easier for the "translator" to leave something untranslated then to ponder for a proper alternative.</br></br></br>  <br> straw-manning this hard </br>  <br> anime and manga <br> nobody besides anime fans <br>Where do you think<br>e<br><br>a<br>r<br>e<br>?<br><br><br><br>Translate, "Onii-chan daisuki" in a way that doesn't sound awkward.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If "I love you Big Bro" sounds awkward to you I fear for your English vocabulary.</br></br>  <br>"I LOVE you" if that person is talking to the brother<br>"I LOVE my brother" if that person is talking about their brother to someone else.</br></br>  <br> I'm a fucking weeb so everyone else is too </br>  <br>Have you ever heard a little girl say "Big bro?"<br><br><br> knowing common japanese terms is weebish <br>This is neo-/a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You misunderstand me. Wanting common Japanese terms to be left untranslated in the English subtitles because you're a fucking weeb is weebish.</br>  You don't tranlate Croissants to "Bread Crescents" and you don't translate sushi to "Rice bites" so you don't translate Onigiri to Riceballs. A single google search of rice ball will redirect you to the wikipedia page for Onigiri.  <br>How would you translate the following words?<br>daruma<br>onmyouji<br>sennin<br>andon<br>chouchin<br>shinkansen<br>okonomiyaki<br>oni<br>youkai<br>yuki onna<br>nattou<br>kimchi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded and I hate you. This has already been explained.</br>  <br>I've already had a long conversation about my philosophy on honorifics, I go with what I think sounds best. To my ear, "onigiri" doesn't sound any better than "rice ball," and unless I have some kind of incentive to leave it untranslated, which I've already gone over, I see no reason to do so. <br><br>Referential pronouns are different, largely because in some anime there are some characters who are referred to by a familial pronoun 90% of the time, so that becomes almost like their name. <br><br>That, and in some cases I think it sounds more natural in Japanese, because they use those familial pronouns a lot more extensively than we do in English.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You don't tranlate Croissants to "Bread Crescents" and you don't translate sushi to "Rice bites" <br><br>because these are English words. This is just getting lazy now. You've completely ignored the entire rest of the thread to repeat the same argument from earlier that was already torn to shreds.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just because the term isn't use doesn't make it gramatically incorrect. Since remember, you are translating here. If it triggers you personally that bad, you could always use his name or just as  pointed out.<br><br>Also please don't try pointing your neo-/a/ at someone else.</br></br></br></br>  You faggots will argue about anything.<br><br>Do you guys do subbing / translation work? Probably not. You're going to be reading whatever the fuck it is the subgroups put on the screen anyways, so you're opinion on the matter is absolutely fucking pointless and you're all getting riled up about someone else's preference for, quite literally, no reason at all.<br><br>And if you do subbing / translation work, you already have your style and I doubt a thread a thread in this shithole is going to change how you do things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>twintails are SHIT</br>  <br>-<br>Shaman<br>Hermit<br>-<br>-<br>Bullet train<br>Forgot this one but it had a good alternative<br>Ogre<br>Monster/demon<br>Forgot this one too damn it<br>Fermented soybeans<br>Not moonspeak<br><br>And this is coming from a random fag that learned all his moonspeak from his chink cartoons.

Maruto never said there's "something big happening", he said that by episode 4 you get the idea what kind of show this is going to be. And since the students who left came back and A-TEC is alive and well I guess we're getting them building podracer.</br></br>  Mizuki continues to be defiantly entertaining<br><br>And no one missed that glance he gave to Iris right?</br></br>  Angelina = Hanako pfffffff  Why is every character best boy/girl?

I always think this show airs on saturday for some reason  <br><br>It does in Japan.</br></br>  Dead show.  <br>See, they are OTP!</br>  <br>I hate /u/ bait.</br>  OP single  <br>See, they love each other</br>  Subs when?  <br>IT'S NOT YURI THEY SAID</br>  <br>One hour.</br>  Thank god this show is CR, I'm not sure if I could take more Funi's bullshit this week.   thread dead except for /u/ shitposters   <br>Noice, I probably couldnt understand the episode if they go standing around and bring out some japanese business talk.</br>  <br> if they go standing around and bring out some japanese business talk. <br>This has been 90% of every episode so far.</br></br>  <br>This is one of those anime where you need the subs to understand this shit.</br>  <br>This. I think I'll just wait for subs next time, livewatch doesn't work at all with this show.</br>  Guys, I can't get past episode 2. It just seems too boring. Please tell me some interesting shit happens.  <br>It doesn't unless you like business drama.</br>  <br>Then don't watch it</br>  Well, at least episode confirmed that Iris also interested in Nagisa  <br>nopefuck off</br>  <br>Keep dreaming. Besides Nagisa is too busy thinking about his brother and Sensei.</br>  <br>So much pure love in this show.</br>  <br>There is nothing worse in today's anime than yuribaiting.</br>  Preorders are finally up:<br><br> **1,948位/**1,772位 (---,--- pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/10/28 【Amazon.co.jp限定】 ClassroomCrisis（クラスルームクライシス） 1 (メーカー特典:「霧科コーポレーション カレンダー(2016年)」) (全巻購入特典:「かんざきひろ描き下ろし全巻収納BOX」「描き下ろしB<wbr>2タペストリー」引換シリアルコード付) (完全生産限定版) [Blu-ray]</wbr> <br><br>RIP.</br></br></br></br>  H-horrible is out!

Murricans won't understand this episode because most of them don't even know what labor union is  <br>This anon is right</br>  <br>Do you actually believe that?</br>  <br> In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union "density") was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada and 70% in Finland. </br>  <br><br><br><br> acting like this is anything new in Maruto anime </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone like this show honestly? The kids in this show are some of the most entitled spoiled little shits I've ever seen, they maybe talented at what they do but holy fuck they have no sense for money, respect or responsibility.</br>  Sensei did nothing wrong this time except maybe being too hopeful and naive. Joining the union is the right choice in this kind of situation, but Nagisa was smarter.  <br>The whole point of a character having negative aspects to them is so character development can happen. Especially for kids, because they don't all start out perfect. If you want gary stus there are anime that cater to you.</br>  <br>They were just told last episode that they have to learn those things and yet next episode already abusing the teacher's new position to get money for themselves. And it isn't just one character, it's all of them even the teacher who is an adult.</br>  <br>The show isn't even HALFway over you fuck<br>People don't change in a day</br></br>  <br>Not doing something doesn't mean you don't know what it is, anon.

By pleasing old men?<br> Any idiot can learn anything if they try instead of complaining about it. <br>Learn =! master. Take off your shipping goggles. If someone have to spend years of hard work and suddenly Yukino comes and becomes better in 3 days, that's just her Mary Sue skills<br> She's good at sports but it also helps she was pissed when going against Miura. <br>Read again everything. She masters any sport in a couple days and then she quits<br> Oh gee wiz I wonder how Judo works. <br><br> Just who did you think you’re making enemies with? It was Yukinoshita Yukino. If it was just her specs alone, then she was at the top of the entire prefecture. She excelled in her resourcefulness, her strategies, her bravery, and her features with her personality collected and viciously unjust. To add to that, she was invincible and peerless as well as the ultimate sore loser. When it came to matches, she was the provisional strongest. <br> The small fry wouldn’t be allowed to even come in contact with her. <br> As reality had it, Yukinoshita didn’t even give him the chance to touch the sleeve of her uniform. <br> She would read her opponents exhalation, anticipate his inhalation of air, and anticipate the movement of his legs. What remained was to insert the most optimal move in relation to her conforming to the movements she had predicted. With dancing footwork and cutting agility, she controlled her opponent’s actions like that of a matador. <br> ... <br> She threw a person from just defensive body movements alone… What the heck was that? Was she Kenichi’s master? <br><br>Yeah, totally not Mary Sue</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sure  How a Yukino end could happen<br><br>  I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. <br> So maybe. So maybe she and I. <br> Hey Yukinoshita...can we be <br> Yes, I will be your girlfriend <br> Uhh, I didnt even finish my statement... <br> Didn’t I say it before? That it’s out of the question for me to be friends with you <br> You did say that twice to me before I suppose <br> Yes but I never said anything about not wanting to be your girlfriend <br> I mulled over Yukinoshita's response. She sure has a habit of not telling the full truth after all <br> Well her answer was what I wanted to hear but was this really how people start dating? Its something I hope Komachi never has to experience next anytime soon.... <br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking sauce now!!!</br>  <br>That doesn't explain why she was such a moeblob in the last novel like I said last thread.</br>  <br>five seconds on sad panda will find it for you.</br>  <br> believe in Spyro-sama <br>Newfag detected.</br></br>  <br>OOC as fuck, though.</br>  <br> Seems that nobody studies apart from her <br>No one else seems to retain knowledge from what they study, Yui and Komachi are a bit air headed when they study, 8man does good but his general laziness fucks him over.<br> Your point? <br>It doesn't matter what you have if it can't help you.<br> If someone have to spend years of hard work and suddenly Yukino comes and becomes better in 3 days, that's just her Mary Sue skills <br> Read again everything. She masters any sport in a couple days and then she quits <br>Look at the way she intended for Saika to get better at tennis, if that's the way she practices and gets obsessive about the things she wants to learn she's pretty damn brutal and probably the reason she has poor stamina now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who undresses in the middle of a school classroom anyways?  <br>Why was Yui even naked in that scene?</br>  <br>She didn't want Yukino to feel awkward about changing in front of her so she started stripping too.</br>  <br>Whores. That's who.<br>Iroha a pure</br></br>  <br>she's lesbian and want rape Yukino</br>  <br> only girl in the cast known to use her feminine wiles to manipulate guys <br> pure </br></br>  <br>Summer detected.</br>  <br>Japs in animu and mangos.</br>  <br>What a fine looking slut!</br>  <br> No one else seems to retain knowledge from what they study, Yui and Komachi are a bit air headed when they study, 8man does good but his general laziness fucks him over. <br>Top student in Sobu High, first at every subject. That means she's the best at all the subjects they teach in HS and the best amongst all the students in Sobu High.<br> It doesn't matter what you have if it can't help you. <br>Your argument doesn't refute the fact she is a Mary Sue. It's like saying someone isn't a Mary Sue/Gary Stu because there are people who envy their perfection at everything<br> Look at the way she intended for Saika to get better at tennis, if that's the way she practices and gets obsessive about the things she wants to learn she's pretty damn brutal and probably the reason she has poor stamina now. <br>Have you ever done any kind of sport? At this point I don't really know if you are just baiting or you really believe in what you just wrote.<br><br>If you are good at sports you learn the basics fast, but that's all. You don't become all at once better than someone who has been training for years by just your sheer willpower. The human body doesn't work like that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because manipulating == evil, right?</br>  <br>They swapped uniforms earlier for the tennis match.</br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  <br>You mean objectively best girl.</br>  <br>I would most likely take it. 8man will take it sooner or later. It cannot be prevented, /a/.</br>  <br><br>Her victory will be complete and glorious.</br></br>  <br>Wrong</br>  <br> I don't know what pure means </br>  <br>You're saying it isn't?</br>  <br> ugly droopy ass on left <br> no tits on right <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed it will. We are blessed to be able to witness it.</br>  <br>Sagami says hi.</br>  How many children are they going to have? How is 8man going to support the family while she's pregnant if he's a stay at home dad?  <br><br>Haruno is the true batman of this series. 8man “solves” problems by making people hate him (social suicide), however, he either doesn’t care about those people or he dislikes them. Haruno, on the other hand, plays the villain in order to fix her autistic sister, a family member whom she is extremely fond of. She plays the villain for her sister's sake albeit the fact that she wants to be close to her.<br><br>Haruno playing the villain is only a small glimpse of her sacrifices.<br><br>We don't even get to see what truly happens behind the scenes with their family problems. Yukino turns into the biggest autistic character whenever her mom shows up. Yet, not only does Haruno interact with their mother in a daily basis, but she also does everything without complaining and performs each of her mother's requests seamlessly. She puts up with her mother's bullshit in order to give her sister freedom and the opportunity to live a happy live. <br><br>Haruno sacrifices her own happiness to help her sister; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy thinking of her drama and why the world is so cruel to her. Haruno executes every single one of these sacrifices without resentment or hatred of her sister; as a matter of fact, she feels quite the opposite, she wants nothing but the best for her.<br><br>Being Haruno is suffering and the thing that makes her so great is that you never hear her complain or whine about her own issues. That's why I truly hope that 8man will be able to show her that genuine bonds do exist, because I feel that all the bullshit that she had to go through for her sister's sake has made her into the cynic that she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's certainly a shitty way to interact with other people.</br>  <br>Dubs say it'll be two children, don't they?</br>  <br>The gods have made their will known.</br>  <br>you basically described every single male protagonist character in every Hmanga/ova/eroge ever.</br>  <br>It's more like her young girl innocence to manipulate guys(triggers their oji-san or onii-chan instincts).<br>It doesn't work on younger boys, boys her own age, or other manipulative girls(Yui, Haruno, Yukino).</br></br>  <br> manipulative girls <br> Yui, Yukino <br>nice one<br><br> nice girl innocence <br>You mean sluttiness? she just wants an older guy to ride</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Have you ever done any kind of sport? At this point I don't really know if you are just baiting or you really believe in what you just wrote. <br> If you are good at sports you learn the basics fast, but that's all. You don't become all at once better than someone who has been training for years by just your sheer willpower. The human body doesn't work like that <br><br>Let's focus on just tennis for now, while Miura was the junior high champion and has good skill, the reason Miura was overwhelmed by Yukino wasn't because of sheer skill.<br>Miura was constantly aiming for her weak side so that made her incredibly easy to rea what she was going to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  anime that actually made you laugh      <br>Zaix10 is great.</br>  shin strange +<br>Senyuu<br><br>Very few people talk about it but I love it.</br></br></br>  <br>first seasons of  naruto </br>   Precure Thread   PRECURE IS DEAD  I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>I'd nyani her sore, if you know what I mean.</br>  Ded anime and ded thread.  <br>What's with all the shit posers going Precure is ded<br>How's the current season compared to Heartcatch Precure?</br></br>  <br>Not to mention ded franchise and ded demographic.</br>  <br>Heartcatch was better, but GoPri might turn out better than last year's stinker (Happiness Charge).</br>  <br>Takes more cues from Yes5 than anything else I'd say.

They're hardcoded to the movie. I only watched like five minutes, but they synced up fine and were legible. Just depends if you want better quality or not.</br>  <br>The Genjutsu was a Mangekyo Sharingan one. Basically, Sasuke's Sharingan was specialer.</br>  <br> If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu <br>This was never confirmed. The sharingan HELPS, but it doesn't guarantee anything.</br></br>  <br>alright ill just mux it with the OP chink video then, there was some other reencode that used the camrip subs that was terribad.</br>  <br>It's been said that the Sharingan allows the user to see through all Genjutsu cast upon them. Although clearly it's not ALL Genjutsu, and I reckon  has the right idea - it's pretty much all, not including Genjutsu cast by a higher-level Sharingan.<br><br>That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it.<br><br>But pffft, plot holes.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is from the short manga which is about Naruto becoming Hokage.  <br>When was it said?</br>  <br>Also, there is a short new commercial trailer<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pmz<wbr>wOZq878w&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>do we have TL-anon here?</br></br>  Naruto is not anime related  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519831 <br><br>is this a new meme?</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519831 <br>retarded samefag</br></br>  <br> 3 irrelevant characters on the scan </br>  <br> new meme <br><br>Moot is rolling in his grave newfag</br></br></br>  @128520011<br>Who?</br>  This and the SnK thread  are cancer, yet /a/ isn't doing anything about them  <br>Thanks anon.

You had your series end, but keep wondering why your threads get deleted every day.

Then we can talk.</br>  <br> the show invites shitposting <br>OK fair point. Now show me exactly which posts in this thread are shitposts.</br></br>  <br>IT'S HAPPENING. FILLER THAT I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO!<br><br><br>I'd like to see Boruto breeze his way through the exams only to get destroyed by the most unassuming character.<br><br><br>It doesn't invite shitposting. It's that a ton of anons feel the need to be part of the 'in' group on /a/ for some reason, and the 'in' group shitpost on Naruto threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of mine<br><br><br>This isn't "new", Naruto has been the redheaded step child of /a/ forever with moot protecting them. Now that moot is gone threads seem to be fair game.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kawai </br>  <br>I never said it was new, it's just that there's no reason for it. If Naruto threads were left alone, the people who want to talk about Naruto would stay there, and create a new thread when the old one ran out. As is it, threads get derailed, and a new one is made, which gets derailed, and a new one is made.<br><br>People who shitpost on Naruto threads can't see to grasp the concept of 'if I don't shitpost on Naruto threads, maybe Naruto threads wouldn't be full of shitposters'.</br></br></br>  <br>the context here is that Himawari wants to bring the bear to the inauguration ceremony, but Boruto is conviced he'll be the one who'll get stuck carrying it and end up embarrassed.</br>  <br>You can add all extra "i" you want. Be my guest.</br>  <br>Is this a thing that's out in English now, or only in Japanese?</br>  The 1080p version on nyaa has a dropbox link where you can download English subs for it that were uploaded by intruder.master.<br><br>Can anyone here verify if it's legit and if it works?</br></br>  <br> destroys birthday cakes <br> now stuffed animals too <br>Why is Boruto such a little shit?</br></br></br>  Was the Kakashi face chapter ever properly translated?  <br>I fucking love that picture so much. I didn't think I'd find a girl I liked more than Hinata, but god damn Himawari has just fucking got everything her mum had, but better.<br><br>Boruto is a cunt though, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>Stealing a teddy bear from Himawari and ripping it apart?<br><br>Really Burrito?<br><br>Fuck this lil nigga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did he destroy cake ?</br>  <br>I don't know where that photo/scan came from, but there is apparently a pre-screening happening sometime this week (maybe even today).<br><br>That 17 page oneshot will be with the book given out at the movie, but I don't know if it 'll be given out in the pre-screening. But we'll definitely get that thing sooner than later.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Bort such a little faggot?</br>  <br> Who is going to stop him ?</br>   Naruto has his own blimp <br>lel</br>  <br> himawari was conceived in that blimp </br>  <br>Grandpa Hiashi.<br><br>Ain't no one, BUT NO ONE, fucks with his little Hima-chan. Not even Boruto.</br></br></br>  <br>  Naruto and Hinata were the first shinobi to be members of the mile-high club </br>  <br>Dadruto uses Kagebunshins that each spank his ass.</br>  <br>Is that a train? Will they get a car then? Kek</br>  <br>Only he gets to treat his family members like expendables pieces of shit.</br>  <br>I'd like to see Hiashi backhand Boruto through a door. I'd like that a lot.</br>  <br> Naruto kids SOL </br>  Here is my sageru.    <br><br>I bet Boruto is even now stronger than grandschemer Hiashi and Dadruto don´t give a fuck. Give it 3 years and both edgelord and Dadruto won´ t be able to stop him if he decide to go serious.</br></br>  <br>As strong as Boruto is/will become, I don't think he'll be able to step to Super Ninja Jesus 1 and 2. He doesn't have Kurama, the Byakugan, or the Sharingan. He's just a kid with a good chakra pool and a few good teachers.</br>  <br>It's not that hard of an accomplishment, he and his slaves got buttfucked by fodder puppets.</br>  <br>He will probably develop Rinnegan and even without it he is able to make some bijuu his bitch.</br>  <br> If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu, why was Danzo not able to see through Sasuke's Genjutsu on his arm with the one Sharingan he had left functioning in his right socket? <br><br>how did kakashi get caught in itachi's tsukuyomi?<br>answer:  kishi writing </br></br></br></br>  <br>How the dick would he develop the Rinnegan? He needs Uchiha DNA for that.<br><br><br>Plot holes? I think you mean creative writing!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rinnegan <br>Get in time gramp. Tenseigan is the new cool</br></br>  <br>OVER THE FUCKING LINE!</br>  <br>It can break regular genjutsus if the victim knows he's on a genjutsu.<br><br>And Tsukuyomi is too OP.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn´t matter if he have DNA from both demigod brothers.</br>  <br> only 6 years <br><br>What did she do to deserve this ?</br></br></br>  <br>Buuuuut he only has Senju DNA at this point. Unless Uncle Orochimaru comes over for a while, then that might change.</br>  Why the fuck did Hinata almost fall off the tower in the beginning when hanging from the scarf? BITCH YOU CAN WALK ON WALLS AND WATER<br><br>Why your ass fall into genjutsu when you can see the chakra flow from miles away? Why the fuck didn't she fall into the genjutsu in the first place when Hyuuga have top tier chakra control. <br><br>Why didn't Naruto just use Bijuu mode from the beginning and end this shit in seconds? Why was he using the vastly inferior KCM?<br><br>Why doesn't the Mizukage have a technique similar to Kisame's water dome? No wonder she's the weakest of the kages. <br><br>Why didn't Based Madara will himself back into existence and fuck Toneri up for being a pussy ass villain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Indra/Ashura reincarnations can develop the rinnegan.</br>  <br>How do you know the bear wasn't his to begin with?</br>  <br> Why the fuck did Hinata almost fall off the tower in the beginning when hanging from the scarf? BITCH YOU CAN WALK ON WALLS AND WATER <br>She didnt have any chakra left, Toneri absorbed all</br></br>  <br>Toneri absorbs Chakra.</br>  <br><br><br>So is the cakepocalypse supposed to be in like a flashback from around when nuduru was first hokage?<br>Burrito and Sunflower look about 12 and 9 during the time of the movie.<br><br>Or maybe just a random number of candles not corresponding to age?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, he is really thirsty for her, sucked her dry.</br>  <br>If she didn't have ANY left, she'd be dead.<br><br>You're telling me she had so little she couldn't even do the simplest of shits. That's whack.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it's just any Senju and Uchiha DNA. They don't HAVE to be Indra/Ashura reincarnations.<br><br>It's just that, you know, what with being mortal enemies, they don't generally have many kids with each other.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Question: If the Sharingan is able to break any Genjutsu, why was Danzo not able to see through Sasuke's Genjutsu on his arm with the one Sharingan he had left functioning in his right socket? <br><br><br>The Sharingan can see through Genjutsu but that does not mean the user can break free from it.<br><br><br><br> That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Burrito is a lil bitch ass nigga.</br>  <br> You're telling me she had so little she couldn't even do the simplest of shits. That's whack <br>Yes.<br>The plot of the movie required a scene like that, and plot will always trump the internal logic of the setting.</br></br></br>  Fuck I hit enter by mistake<br><br> That being said, Danzo's right eye was Shisui's who had a Mangekyou, meaning he still should've been able to see through it. <br><br><br>Shisui's Sharingan was only available after the "recharge" time and that was after the whole genjutsu trickery and once he started to use it he was faster than Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When a movie is in the hands of a bad writer, the plot will always trump the internal logic of the setting <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>He is not black and you seem to have just as bad logic as Kishimoto.</br>  <br>No, Hagoromo and Zetsu clearly state that you need Indra and Ashura's chakra.<br><br>Which only reincarnations have.</br></br></br>  <br>well most fiction except a few books are written badly so I guess you do not enjoy things much.</br>  <br>It is said right there and in another page that both indra and ashura chakra are needed.</br>  <br> When the movie's source material is already ridden with inconsistencies, one more will hurt no one <br>ftfy, seriously, you talking as if this was the first time this happened in Naruto</br></br>  <br>Most of everything is bad, yes. <br><br><br>Hey, let me talk my shit in peace.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the plot simply required that as many red scarves as possible give their lives for the ship.<br><br>  chibi scarf - bullies <br>  hinata scarf mk. 1 - impromptu rope <br>  mk. 2 - combusted <br>  mk. 3 - survived? <br>  mk. 4 - being knit in post-credits <br><br>that woman must have the patience of a saint. I would have snapped after like the second time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She waited like 20+ years for Naruto, 18 or so of which consisted of him being completely oblivious to her.</br>  <br>How good are the dropbox subs in the 1080p version?</br>  <br>It's good practice and Hinata has a lot of love to give. <br>When you knit a scarf it takes a lot of time and the more love you put into it the longer it takes. <br><br>Now lose in one punch and let Hinata take the eyes out of your eye sockets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly don't know, I haven't downloaded them. Apparently it requires dicking around with timings.</br>  <br>Have you downloaded the 1080p version? If so, would you mind tinkering around and seeing if the dropbox subs work?</br>  <br>They were only 19. Only 12 of those years were being in love with him.</br>  <br>Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh but it's 2:15am and I'm tired as fuck. If this thread is somehow not pruned by the time I wake up, I'll do it. Otherwise I'll start a new thread with results.<br><br><br>I generalised. It's way too late for me to figure out exact ages.</br></br></br></br>  Things I disliked about Naruto: The Last:<br> Naruto's feelings for Hinata being a literal deux ex machina <br> Disney-esque scarf shit <br> Naruto's haircut <br> literal DBZ beam spam fight scenes, even the fight against Madara wasn't this bad <br><br>Things I liked about Naruto: The Last:<br> Hinata <br> Hanabi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Here is the current, most updated subs file:<br>mega.co.nz/#!b0lRmbhS!yDhe_LtcWMK4H<wbr>T2EfFv8CAMcJcX8Iwx4ZVZqVjivUHM<br>The missing lines were added and it's properly timed. The guy who made it said he would post an updated version today with color.</br></wbr></br>  <br>2:15AM? Where do you live anon?</br>  <br>With color to what? The subtitles? Can't I just technically download these subs to the 1080p version right now?</br>  I just checked and the guy who made the subtitles actually just posted the updated version with colored lines:<br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/wcm42zgz7<wbr>nowucl/The%20Last%20Naruto%20the%20<wbr>Movie.English_%5BFINAL%5D.ass?dl=0<br><br><br>Yeah, with the subtitles colored. You can download the ones on mega, if you don't want them with color.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh </br>  <br>North Queensland, Australia, my man.<br><br><br>Hanabi was literally one of my favourite things in The Last. She barely showed up, but Jesus Christ I want to see more of her portrayed like that.<br><br>I want an arc dedicated to NaruHina dating shenanigans:<br><br>  Hanabi develops a small sisterly rivalry with Hinata over Naruto after he saves her life. Shenanigans ensure as Hanabi is clearly raunchier and more outgoing than Hinata. <br>  Naruto's first dinner at the Hyuuga household. Hanabi plays footsies with Naruto under the table, who thinks it's Hinata the whole time. <br>  Hiashi Hyuuga walking in on them making out <br>  Several missions that bring them closer together <br>  Naruto looking tenderly at Hinata as she sleeps and he keeps watch <br>  Hinata and Naruto share a kiss before the beginning and at the end of each mission. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OK, then how good are the subs? Can you verify them to see if they're legit?</br>  <br>Australia? Jesus. Is it true that Australia's internet connection sucks shit?</br>  <br><br>Shikamaru's kid would be a good choice for him to lose against.</br></br>  <br>I'm paying for 25mbps down, 1mbps up.<br>I'm lucky if I get 1mbps down.<br>I usually sit on around 0.60mbps<br>It took over an hour to download a 150MB file<br><br>You tell me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched the whole movie yet but from what I've seen they're good.<br>The first version had some missing lines and some misspellings and whatnot but that has been fixed in the most updated version.<br>They should be good to go.</br></br></br>  <br> haircut <br><br>Where is muh long hair beta cuck MC haircut ? Fucking faggot, nurto finally looks like decent human.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw slovakia </br>  <br>Shit.<br><br>Got it. Can you post a few screencaps if you don't mind?</br></br></br>  <br>jesus fuck, is that for even domestic connections, or are you talking about fighting for bandwidth on undersea fiber to 'murica or something?</br>  <br>The fight will be cut short by aliums.</br>  <br><br><br>Different Ausfag here.

It's absolute bullshit, and nothing is being done because our Government gives no shits about keeping up with the rest of the world.</br>  <br>His unrequited crush on Sarada.</br>  <br> Sakura's face <br><br>She should have clocked Naruto for being a retarded idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>why are hyuga clan bullies even a thing?</br>  <br>  Hey, let's pick on the daughter of one of the most powerful clans in the Village <br>  Ha ha yeah, there's no way this could end badly! <br><br>There is a near 100% chance that Hiashi fucking killed those kids and hid their bodies, explaining it away as 'Something something those damn Lightning ninja, whatcha gonna do?'</br></br></br></br>   same clothes <br><br>So Orochimaru is Mitsuki's dad?</br></br>  <br>what the fuck are these?</br>  <br> Sakura  <br><br>A blush because someone is in your face is not unrequited love.</br></br></br>   naruto has a dream <br> all of a sudden is no longer asexual <br> all of a sudden is in love with hinata <br>garbage</br></br></br>  <br>Covers for the gaiden's volume</br>  <br> Sakura criticizing anyone else being stupid about love. <br>Please look at who you are talking about here.</br></br>  <br>Anon, please. Hiashi is classier than that. He just used his prestige to ruin their family and lead the kid's parents into getting divorced. <br><br>Gotta be ninja subtle about that shit, yo. Can't play 5000 hours on Crusader Kings 2 without picking up some subtlety</br></br></br>  <br>Giorno had a dream and he is gay</br>  <br>It's a cheesy romance film for kids with DBZ action. Were you expecting the orange road or something?<br>Also he has shown attraction to women before in the chapter Jiraiya was introduced.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Naruto's feelings for Hinata being a literal deux ex machina <br><br>His feelings for her were all him, nothing forced those feelings into him, he just saw a dream that made him reconsider some things, he just needed to understand first that she loved him, before he started to realize "Oh, I guess I'm into her as well now that I think about it".<br><br>Probably could have figured out another way to do that if that was all it needed, but this way was more flashy and good for the movie in terms of visuals. Also considering what it took for him to realize it, they needed something like this to really hammer it in since he misses the clues so much.<br><br>Guy is dense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto can be pretty gay sometimes, but let's not forget that he's a serial peeping tom. He's not asexual.</br>  <br>Yeah, I felt that Naruto falling in love with Hinata was BS. Should have been done better. I was laughing the entire time when watching the movie cause of how bad that was.</br>  <br>  7th Hokage and the Scarlet Spring <br><br>that fucking title still makes zero sense to me. and naruto was only a supporting character.<br>for a story about worst family with potential best daughteru</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Perfect. I'll download it as soon as I get back home. Thanks anon.</br></br></br></br>  When is naruto going to take control of other countries ? What´s taking him so long ? He can literally start in morning and be done at evening for some Hyuga fucking.  <br>No problem anon, have fun.</br>  <br>"Where Sasuke stuck his dick into?" doesn't make for a good title.<br><br>Besides, it needed to be something ambiguous so WSJ could advertise it as the adventures of Naruto and Naruto Jr.</br></br></br>  <br><br>People in real life are freaked by their eye design. It must be worse in-universe.<br><br>Also, because even if a dissapointment to Hiashi, Hinata was still treated like a noble, and that probably made the bullies angry (the same version of that scene in the anime implies the kids believed she felt superior to them and looked down upon non Hyuugas).</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck?!</br>  <br><br>Notice he was dreaming about Hinata before the dreams connected.<br><br>He already had feelings for her. But did not underatand the romantic implications until he saw those moments through Hinata's eyes.</br></br></br></br>  I want Hinata to be my  onee-san   <br>The guy constantly asked Sakura out on dates as a 12 year old. Was it that hard to do the same thing with Hinata?</br>  <br> naruto has tapped that AT LEAST twice </br>  <br>Its talked about in the movie a bit; he liked Sakura because she liked Sasuke, and he didn't want to lose to him in a sense.<br><br>With Hinata, he was dense so he confused what kind of like or love it was, didn't really understand the difference due to a misunderstanding, and didn't realize his own feelings.<br><br>Shikamaru Gaiden apparently says they hung out a lot even before the movie in the off moments.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, the same way we know they've kissed for at least 12 seconds<br><br> inb4 muh forehead poking is better </br></br></br>  <br> unrequited <br><br>They are already singing duets together.</br></br></br>  <br> Its talked about in the movie a bit; he liked Sakura because she liked Sasuke, and he didn't want to lose to him in a sense. <br><br>That still doesn't make sense, nearly all girls in ninja school liked Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Only ones that "seriously" liked him were Ino and Sakura.<br><br>The other ones were more fangirls, like what Naruto had when he became famous.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck in hiashi doing with all his free time then?<br>  bored as fuck, just waiting for keikaku 2.0 kids to age up <br>  considering lobbying naruto to lower legal marriage age in konoha before he realizes what's up </br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pm<wbr>zwOZq878w</wbr>  [ ] <br>The fuck did this nigga just throw?</br>  <br>Why is he such an Uzumaki fangirl trying to make them the strongest clan in history?</br>  <br>looks strongly like a lightning raseshurikan</br>  <br>Yeah, but look at the size of it.</br>  How is Burrito going to surpass his dad? You can't get more powerful than Ninja Jesus No. 1 and 2 without being a Juubi Jinchuriki, an Asura or Indra reincarnation, or having Otsutsuki.<br><br>And how come there is a threat to a world where these couple of Ninja Jesuses live on?</br></br>  <br>probably wants to breed their offspring back into the hyuga clan.<br><br>in the ninja world, barely diluted incest makes the world go round.</br></br></br>  <br> How is Burrito going to surpass his dad? <br>see<br><br>Throwing around Rasengan the size of minivans is a good start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>boruto and himawari definintly have a little bit kurama chakra in them, they wouldnt have the marks if they didnt.</br>  <br><br><br> 12 year old normies are going to fight him <br><br>How ? This nigga have rasengan, chidori, gentle fist, he can literally fuck up your organs just by touching you. And they send "haha i caught you in my dont move jutsu" at him ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 空も陸もお任せ！便利な乗り物が色々誕生！！ <br><br> Entrust the skies and lands to me! It's the creation of various convenient vehicles!  <br><br> 近代化した木ノ葉隠れの里に、新しい乗り物が登場！里の人たちの手段もす<wbr>ごく便利になったよう だ！！</wbr> <br><br> In the modernized Konohagakure Village, new vehicles have appeared! It seems to have become a very convinient means of transportation for the people of the village! <br><br> 田舎の駅と、雷のエネルギーを用いて稼働する電車。見た目は、どちらかと<wbr>いうと汽車に近い…？</wbr> <br><br> It's the station at the countryside. It uses lightning energy for the operation of the electric train. If you had to describe it, it looks like a steam-powered train...? <br><br> 木ノ葉マークをあしらった飛行船は、なんと火影専用！ナルトはこの飛行船<wbr>に乗って他の里に行っているのか！ ？</wbr> <br><br> It's a private blimp for the Hokage that's affixed with the symbol of Konoha! When Naruto is riding on this blimp, he goes to other villages!? <br><br> 木ノ葉隠れの里もずいぶんと変わったな… <br><br> Konohagakure Village has really changed, eh... <br><br> nardo has a fucking blimp as Hokage </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>chakra monster status confirmed, didn't even need sage mode or whatever.<br><br>even without reincarnation level instapowers, burrito could top his dad by just not being an incompetent taijutsu user (check) and  reviving hiraishin .</br></br></br></br>  <br>So is the blimp that weird place where Naruto and Sasuke talk in the trailer?</br>   been keeping up with the anime for the past few weeks because it's the guy fight <br> it was fucking shit <br>how can they make the kakashi obito fight good, but not guy madara? when are we burning toei to the ground?</br></br>  <br>naruto could have made it for bolt and handed it off to him</br>  <br>pre toad sage Naruto might have under average taijutsu, but frog kata Naruto is legitimate good</br>  f*ck yeah the time has come and so have i  <br>I don't think he necessarily gets the chidori and lightning rasengan shit until after the interrupted chunin exams.<br><br>anyway, last fight is against mini-Shikamaru, who's guaranteed to out-think him and get the promotion after he runs out of juice and surrenders.</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly. They didn't show any interior, though. <br> implying it's not where nardo and Hinata go if they want a little alone time away from the kids <br>Dude's got a fucking pimp blimp. How much more based can you get?<br><br>Also,<br> nardo operating any vehicle <br> especially flying ones <br>We're all doomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> toei <br><br>They also have a movie, Naruto and Sasuke vs Madara, team 7 vs Kaguya and Naruto vs Sasuke right around the corner.</br></br></br>  <br> dat Hinata <br>Usually don't like short hair, but she looks good there.</br></br>  <br>That looks impressive. But probably that's Dadruto's Rasengan and Bert is helping him throwing it because Father-Son kamehameha shit.<br><br><br>Obviously they do. The question is, how can that surpass what his dad has: the entire Kurama (or just one half, who knows) inside? Also consider that said dad also happens to be an Asura reincarnation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you out-think someone who can kill you with one touch ? This isn´t Temari vs Shikamaru toddler level. I swear it´s going to be biggest asspull.</br>  <br>It's possible, but it seems too vanilla to have nardo be involved. It's just a giant fucking Rasengan.</br>  <br>So either he gets beat by a half sandnigger or he needs training from the two ninja Gods to defeat him?</br>  <br>Holy shit muh dick.</br>  <br> But probably that's Dadruto's Rasengan and Bert is helping him throwing it because Father-Son kamehameha shit <br>I dunno. The way it rotates when Bort gets ready to use it makes me believe it only has a single user. But you could be right. Or he could have just made it for him and handed it off.</br></br>  <br>Sauce just teaches chidori and supervises. Naruto just taught him the clone jutsu. Bolt is actually too lazy to actually train most of the time.</br>  <br>maybe it just looks bigger cause bolt is still a kid when naruto learned rasenshurikan when he was older and taller.</br>  <br>So it's canon? Jiraya and Neji reincarnated inside of Bort?</br>  <br> 12 years away <br> comes back just to train Boruto <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shikamaru had to be sneaky since he was fighting someone who had a perfect long-range defense with moderate offense at all ranges.<br><br>burrito probably doesn't have any viable long range attacks before sauce later trains him.<br><br>but realistically, shikadai would stand little chance against a shadow clone user with death touch unless he picked up a LOT of techs from his mom or multi-target grab already from his dad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is lazy when it comes to training according to the profile. I suspect rather than train, he just picks things up.</br>  <br>forehead poking is objectively retarded and therefore reserved for shit characters like sasuke and sakura</br>  <br> dat bear mode Chouji w/beard. </br>  <br>He must have taught him something really impressive if he ends up wearing Sauce's headband in the final fight.</br>  <br> What's to stop me from becoming a god 'ttebasa? </br>  <br>Is it just me or does the movie look kind of bad? I mean, this is movie quality animation? The animation seems like it's from an average series, and the characters look like they're really off-model sometimes.</br>  <br>He comes back because Konoha is about to get invaded by ayyliens <br><br>Bort is the one who begs him to let him become his pupil.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never noticed that.</br>  <br> they even fight like siblings <br>Nigga, that's kawaii.<br><br><br>Back and front? If so that's kinda cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, why is he wearing that ugly ass jacket ? Come on, black looked good on him.</br>  <br>What do I use to open the .ass file from dropbox?

Not a big fan of them initially omitting some of Hinata's scenes, so to have her "mysteriously" go rogue. The non-romance plot was nice, though a bit plain. I would have liked to see more of Hinata trying to take a lead, like her back-and-forth scene, before Hanabi counseled her. Her being timid and contemplative isn't all that interesting to watch. Every once in a while a few things irked me, like this bit:<br><br>"Oh wow, Sakura, you sure saved us, what with you being immune to Genjutsu!" Last time I checked, she just knew how to wake someone up from Genjutsu back during the Konoha invasion. At the end of the manga Sasuke even took her out with genjutsu, so he could go have sex with Naruto. Not to mention that Naruto was the only one who had canonically an inbuilt Genjutsu counter. "You always need someone to wake you up" was what they said back then and Naruto had the Ninetails, who conveniently didn't do shit until he was summoned for the end fight. I guess they had to throw Sakura a bone. Maybe she had no happy memories to speak of, so she woke up immediately.<br><br>Naruto's "lol I love you" came a bit too sudden IMO, at least in that level of commitment. He was still completely oblivious at the start of the movie, so a "I realized how you feel and I'm glad, I'd like to start things from here" or something like that would have flown more naturally. It felt like the movie skipped a few steps.<br><br>I'm not quite sure why Moonboy needed Hanabi's eyes (other than drama), since the whole moon had been populated by Byakugan owners. Sure he could have taken one pair from the superweapon to activate the process. Might be that I missed a sentence where they explained that it had be from an Earth based clan.<br><br>Overall, I liked the movie though. It ended the series on a high note and had many cute and nice looking scenes, which is good enough, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish salad will fight like this in chuunin exam.

She was probably the only one out of the group who figured out they were dreaming/genjutsu and snapped herself out willingly.<br> the whole moon had been populated by Byakugan owners. <br>He was filling a prophecy.

She learned it.</br>  <br>if she didn't naruto wouldn't get any work done anon</br>  <br>no, she was a shit muggle-born who acquired decent control because her chakra reserves had the depth of a thimble.<br>retard punch and heal hacks were just taught skills requiring high levels of control.<br><br>she is literally just the Rock Lee of chakra control.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does he hold himself back ?</br>  <br><br>The super strength is caused by chakra control (releasing chakra the moment the attack connects) so if chakra control is hereditary then that's explained.<br>Isn't the auto healing seal just the technique created by Tsunade that accumulates chakra throughout the years and then uses it to heal?</br></br></br>  <br> send a clone to do your work <br> stay at home filling Hinata with baby batter all day <br>Daily reminder this will NEVER, EVER be you.</br></br></br>  <br>what ass?</br>  <br>Yeah but you only get techniques in the Naruto universe if you are related to someone who has them or if you train with them.</br>  <br>He always go as original to work. Which bring question. Can clone produce sperm, are they fertile ?</br>  <br>good point</br>   end of bolt movie <br> hinata tells naruto shes pregnant again <br> followed by kishi announcing a sol naruto <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>I'd guess like 10-12 years after Chapter 699/ after the birth of all the childs<br>They're probably around 12 like in the original chunin exams</br></br>  <br> how old is everyone during the salada gaiden/boruto movie. <br><br>original main cast is about 19 + 2 + X + 12 (where X = time to married + preggers), so probably about 35.</br></br></br>  I love naruhina and all but the way they handled naruto having feelings for hinata was atrocious  <br> she is literally just the Rock Lee of chakra control. <br>Isn't perfect chakra control one of the most useful shit in the Naruto universe? That could come handy for the Burrito/Salad kid.</br></br>  Poor Hinata  <br>For fucks sake just let it go Naruto has never been a sol nor will it ever be.</br>  <br>I can´t believe people find those eyes repulsive.</br>  <br> Isn't perfect chakra control one of the most useful shit in the Naruto universe <br>It's like you haven't been paying attention to the series at all. The most important part of this series is good genetics. That's it. Nothing else.</br></br>  <br> not reading springtime of youth </br>  <br> stay at home filling Hinata with baby batter all day <br>and cuddle afterwards</br></br>  <br>the point is that she's genetic trash with high level skill acquired through circumstance and hard work as a result of another handicap.<br><br>nothing has shown that high level control is genetic, whereas it's explicitly stated earlier that sakura's control is high -because- she originally had minimal reserves.</br></br></br>  <br> Naruto has never been a sol </br>  <br> perfect chakra control <br>Ok, let's go with that one. Although any fuck can improve it wit some training.<br> super strength <br>Training.<br> automatic healing <br>Training.<br><br>Sakura's genes are nothing special and the best Burrito and Salad can hope is that her muggle genetic dillutes enough to not harm their Uzumaki-Senju-Uchiha-Hyuga mega-baby's genetics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Can clone produce sperm, are they fertile ? <br><br>I don't know, but double shadow clone proxy sex is probably the safest and best form of birth control known to man.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are only for Naruto's view.</br>  <br>Hyuuga apparently have good genetics but that didn't stop them from being useless jobbers that lost nearly every fight they got themselves into.</br>  <br><br><br>This<br><br>Narutos song says it all<br> No Matter What Day It is <br>  <br> In the expansive scenery before me, <br> I saw only what was facing me. <br> That there is truth hiding on the backs of things, <br> I never noticed, and overlooked. <br>  <br> Getting lost, and taking the long way, <br> It’s not a smooth road, but <br> If I turn around, I know you are beside me, watching over me, <br> Kindness overflowing. <br>  <br> No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is, <br> I’ll never give up on what I’m aiming for. <br> If you laugh, then with just that, <br> It will always give me strength. <br> Like the flowers coloring the treetops in two colors, <br> Let’s start answering our feelings. <br>  <br> Even the days I look back on, <br> Not a single one is the same. <br> They build upon one another. <br> I now understand the meaning of warmth. <br>  <br> No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is, <br> The bright sunshine raining down upon is <br> Smiling with us and accompanying us. <br> These days that I want to protect, <br> The place where are roads meet, from here on out, <br> Let’s walk together, <br> And start today. <br>  <br> Understanding one another, <br> Believing in one another, <br> We’ll take these bonds, and drive them deep into our hearts! <br>  <br> No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is, <br> I won’t give up on the dream I’m aiming for. <br> If you just laugh, than with just that, <br> It gives me strength. <br> We might fail, <br> But we won’t bend, <br> No matter what, we’ll do what it takes. <br> Even when there is a shadow on our hearts, <br> Now that we’re together, <br> From this point where our roads meet, <br> We’ll walk together, <br> And start today </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would Hiashi do if he found out Sakura ruined his CK II, eugenics keikaku master schemer plan ?</br>  <br>She's got Hamura chakra now<br><br>Passed it onto the kids</br></br></br>  <br>take one of the scene where her turban flies away and she looks like a goddess</br>  <br> Uzumaki-Senju-Uchiha-Hyuga <br><br>God, the Hyuga really feel out of place compared to how strong the other clans ended up being.</br></br></br>  <br>If Naruto pulled off that bandage would he die?</br>  I cant imagine hinata giving birth, shes too fragile.  <br>So I guess since Shino won every fight he was in, that makes him the strongest character</br>  <br>Yep, sounds about right. He's pretty much always been considered nigh-top tier.

No it it isn't "They lose everything"<br><br>You'd have a stronger base saying they're completely irrelevant, but they aren't jobbers no matter how you say it.

It brilliantly sparkles in the sun. <br><br> * When he was young, he should have thought that he naturally wanted to be a ninja like his father. But now...  <br><br> * Sarada tells him to not be in a daze (--&gt;like stop being so absentminded) <br><br> * Boruto tells her he's not though.  <br><br> * Running next to him is Sarada. She has characteristic thick glasses and black hair. She seems listless. <br><br> * Mitsuki tells Boruto to go first. Mitsuki's pupils are described as being like a Zashiki-Warashi from a fairy tale. <br><br> * Boruto makes a seal while running for the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu---&gt; Now there are three of him.  <br><br> * He tells the 'damn panda' that he is it's opponent. <br><br> * Next time : A quarrel between parent and child: Hokage and son) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone hasn't been keeping up.</br>  <br>Fuck, so dream is over ?</br>  <br>she only got stabbed, being tossed was added into the anime for muh drama</br>  <br>  imblying Senjus weren't a one-trick pony plus a random reincarnation jackpot </br>  I'm still kinda mad that Neji died<br>Even Gai who opened the 8th gate, which was hyped up all over the series that it's so OP that it kills you no matter what, was just healed<br>Neji could've just spinned like he always does and deflect that shit</br></br>  <br>Bort uses the Hyuuga fighting style. He doesn't need the Byakugan. Keikaku is on, motherfuckers.</br>  <br>The Hyuga are the only clan left of the five who didn't get wiped out to near-extinction. <br><br>Otsutsuki has one person, Senju has one person, Uchiha has three, Uzumaki has 5 inclusing Hinata and the Hyuga have massive numbers. <br><br>They won the race by letting everyone else wear themselves down and they just casually strolled their way to victory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a big arm, though.</br>  <br>No seriously, who puts these kids against each other ? There is some serious power level difference.</br>  <br>aren't they just purely natural arms that happen to be fugly and grow random faces?</br>  <br>The thing you're saying was never a real thing, officially Kishi says he just forgot to give them it in the designs later on.<br><br>Turns out they can still do it in the movie though.</br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai has them Shikamaru and Temari intellect. He's going to Batman his way through the fight to Boruto's superman.</br>  <br> Boruto inherited his golden locks and blue eyes from Naruto, and his gentle features from Hinata. </br>  <br> muh jobber <br>This fucking guy, every thread</br></br>  <br>omae ga da.</br>  <br> Hyuga have massive numbers. <br>But none of them are even side characters</br></br>  <br>Shikadai's got his dad's IQ. He'll be fine at this stage of development.</br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br>That´s like batman vs superman. But Shikadai without any magic stone.</br>  <br>Good; less chance of dying by virtue of not being on the main cast and thus higher chance of birthing a main character.</br>  <br>yes, thank you<br>whoever animated this scene was a hinata fag</br></br>  <br>is this some preview for a Boruto novel like all the past movies?</br>  <br>His IQ could help him realize quicker how fucked up he is. But that´s all.</br>  <br> No seriously, who puts these kids against each other? <br><br>they did themselves, through advancing through the tournament brackets.<br>boruto is probably a fighting prodigy like sauce who has coasted for long enough that he habitually doesn't use his brain strategically.<br><br>lazy nara 3.0 can deal with anything close-to-mid range and only has to worry about getting shadow clone spammed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> higher chance of birthing a main character. <br><br>What? Do you seriously think that eventually Kishi is going to do a hundred year time skip and write about some random Hyuga kid?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably the whole team<br>She looked amazing the whole movie, way more mature than before</br></br>  <br>What is that supposed to be anon?</br>  Although the subs I watched were shit, I can at least say it was really worth waiting for the BD and avoiding Naruto threads to not get spoilered.<br>A really well done finale for this manga.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Bolt will have a weakness for Shikadai to exploit.</br>  <br> Boruto inherited his golden locks and blue eyes from Naruto, and his gentle features from Hinata.  <br>Oh shit, Boruto's gonna look like an Aryan, spike-haired Neji when he's older, isn't he?</br></br>  <br> Mitsuki's pupils are described as being like a Zashiki-Warashi from a fairy tale. <br>So this kid is that fucker from the film's son, right?</br></br>  <br>that's just kishi trolling. burrito movie production started at least a year before the manga ended, so the bolt legacy stuff was already being built up then.<br><br>some folks probably decided to go with gentle fist rather than pale eyes for his mommy's legacy due to aesthetics or to keep him from being too much of a nedgy clone.</br></br></br>  <br> 5 minutes into the movie <br> shota Naruto gets his ass whooped by 3 bullies <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>Only thing we know it does is make her chakra purple, allow her to possibly awaken the Tenseigan if she felt like it which she probably won't, however the potential is passed down at least, and gives her chakra reserves great enough to refill Naruto when he's empty near the end of the movie without running out herself.<br><br>Purple is a good color I guess?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Sarada is Sakura's daughter; Sakura has mastered both those techniques so it's no surprise she might have taught them to Sarada.</br>  <br>Who knows? yellow eyes and stretching powers say otherwise.</br>  When's the KANA BOON song out from the movie  The wedding outro almost had me in tears<br>I always wanted it to end after all those years, but now i wish it would continue in a more relaxed series</br>  <br>I still can't believe that he had a failed multi-shadow-clone as a 6 year old or whatever.<br><br>he shouldn't have even known what the shadow clone was even for just a bluff.</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13463<br>It's the the music video</br></wbr></br>  <br>Danzou's sharingan was on cool down from using it on the kages earlier.<br><br>Second is that the ability to see through genjutsu is not passive. The user needs to be aware or on the look out for being in genjutsu sort of like focusing an eye.<br><br>finally on a side note it can't see through all genjutsu. It can resist genjutsu but if the user is weaker than the genjutsu used on them then its meaningless. thats what happed to part on Kakashi and Sasuke against Itachi's MS. genjutsu.<br><br>Also it only helps against visual Genjutsu which is why Sound genjutsu fucked both the rinnegan and the sharingan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that the new anime opening ?</br>  <br>is it confirmed?</br>  <br>He always said shadow clone was his worst technique in the early chapters of the manga. Couldn't ever get it right, tried to do it during graduation and it came out dead.</br>  <br>Yeah, I thought he only learned that shit in the first chapter of series through that scroll he stole. But now apparently it's always been his thing?</br>  <br>August 5 i think</br>  So /a/<br>Will we finally see Nardo going all out?<br>Or is he gonna restrain himself like he did in The Last?</br></br>  <br>That Sakura is Sarada's mother?<br>Yeah, it was confirmed in Gaiden: Karin did the delivery while Sakura was traveling with Sasuke.</br></br>  Fuck i am not watching 720, when i can i expect some decent subs for standart quality ?  <br>That was normal clone though wasnt it.</br>  <br> Sakura has mastered both those techniques so it's no surprise she might have taught them to Sarada. <br><br>she probably taught control/retard punch, but the heal hack requires years of continuous focus/control which salad almost definitely won't get any time soon</br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Madara and Kaguya were a threat that required both Naruto and Sasuke at the same time<br><br>Toneri was a legit threat on par with Naruto going all out with his chakra mode, but not Naruto and Sasuke together. It just required Naruto getting serious and using a bit of strat.<br><br>He was a bit lower on the scale but not much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those were normal clones, he didn't really know anything about the shadow clones until he stol the secret scroll.</br>  <br> He always said shadow clone <br><br>clone != shadow clone<br>the latter he only got at 12 years old from the secret scroll</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh I agree with that, I just meant that it wouldn't be a surprise if Sarada learned them at some point. I worded it poorly.</br>  <br>Thanks<br><br><br>Alright nice, thanks.<br><br><br>Nah, movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What child is this plays at the begining <br>They're not even trying to hide that Naruto is Ninja Jesus<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lt<wbr>X-6HblGJI</wbr>  [ ] <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1A<wbr>3i0GATnRI</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toneri was a legit threat on par with Naruto going all out with his chakra mode <br><br>He only used the fox mode not the Jesus mode.</br></br></br>  <br>Same basic shit from the sound of it<br><br>The secret technique just kind of spams it on mass, in a way that would require massive chakra to not die.</br></br></br>  <br> 180cm <br><br>Looks like the studio didn't account for Naruto growing another 4 inches after The Last.</br></br></br>  <br>he says "kagebunshin no jutsu" at 00:02:43</br>  Why do I not have any video for the 1080 version in MPC?  <br>it's most likely a mistake on SP or Kishimoto's part</br>  <br>No, the regular clones aren't physical and can't fight.</br>  <br>  i wish it would continue <br>That's what makes it a good ending, you know you don't really want it to continue.</br></br>  <br>In the new trailer it looks like naruto is protecting Boruto from a big explision using his bijuu mode but i don't understand why he doesn't uses the gioudama to protect him and the kid after all that balls are almost undestructable.<br>Maybe Naruto lose that sage power after all</br></br>  <br> Hey mom and dad <br> did I ever tell you about the time I was an evil alien goddess and then your dads sealed me away for what they thought was for good? <br> Yeah, good times, good times. <br> I'm going to go spit in Grandpa Naruto's ramen now </br></br></br></br>  <br>regular clone is an E-rank illusion<br>single shadow clone is B-rank with the memory transfer thing, something that most chunin have a hard time pulling off<br>multi shadow clone is A-rank due to the death potential<br><br>regular clones to shadow clones are about the same difference as between a body flicker (D) and a true spacetime jump like the flying thunder god (S).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying naduro doesn't want to show off </br>  <br>I want to bang the shit out of Kaguya.

NH fans love this excuse despite it being full of holes.<br><br>and this is coming from a NH fan. Their getting together the way they did felt cheap. But I love the results just the same.</br></br></br></br>  HOW COME TODDLER NARUTO EVEN KNEW ABOUT THE SHADOW CLONE JUTSU IF IT WAS FORBIDDEN AND YOU WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT FROM READING THAT FORBIDDEN SCROLL  <br>truth seeking balls probably got removed because they were simply too OP<br><br>  completely immune to ninjutsu <br>  will kill anybody who tries taijutsu against them <br>  only shown to be vulnerable to kamui, the biggest hack power ever <br><br>maybe nardo just tanked the hit normally because muh never show full power at the start of a fight, but there'd be no reason he'd need sauce's help later if he could just pull them out whenever.<br><br>  also, may be dependent on begging other biju for power and he's too lazy to go traveling to ask them / doesn't want to start a war through stockpiling more powers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HE WAS LYING. SAYING HIS FAKE CLONES WERE THE SUPERIOR SHADOW CLONE.</br>  <br>Mass Shadow Clone is forbidden. Regular Shadow Clone is just advanced.</br>  <br>The forbidden was making 1000 at once because it will kill you.</br>  <br>One day, anon.</br>  <br>I wouldn't take family pictures where Sasuke is around as evidence of the actual sizes.<br><br>Especially with how inconsistent heights are nearly everything that requires drawings. Sarada looks in some panels of the gaiden to be about Naruto's shoulder size.</br></br></br>  <br><br>it was either a stupid kishi/SP mistake (likely) or the implication that the dumb orphan would even know what they were and tried to bluff (seems unlikely)</br></br>  <br> it was either a stupid kishi/SP mistake (likely) <br><br>That was my first thought when I saw the scene but Naruto knowing OF the Shadow Clone isn't impossible. It could be something he overheard being mentioned once and thought it sounded cool.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Toneri was a legit threat on par with Naruto going all out <br> Naruto going all out <br> In The Last <br>Heh no, he didn´t go all out<br>If he woul have gone all out he would have looked like Pic related and he would have definitely ass-raped Toneri<br>But if you take into account  then there´s the possibilty that Nardo lost his Sage powers, and that, anon, makes me mad as fuck cause that means we´ll never see Nardo using Goudodamas ever again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she have nothing on Boruto <br>She has a tight cooter and a nice set of thighs.</br></br>  <br>Toneri sapped Naruto's chakra repeatedly in the film, since that seems to be one of the main powers of the Reincarnation Eyes.<br><br>Maybe he didn't have the stamina to go beyond fox mode.</br></br></br>  <br>If he had gone all out*<br>Geez, my English is disgraceful</br></br>  <br> bottom right <br> when you nutted but she keep suckin </br></br>  <br>Can he even do that anymore?</br>  <br>The boys just hit puberty, anon.

Perfect. We need a draw fag to get on this.</br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br> * He tells the 'damn panda' that he is it's opponent. <br>Boruto the Panda Slayer.

The kid might not have their eyes, but he's got their body.</br></br>  <br> Aryan Neji and female Sauce <br>Fuck, they're going to have some sexy ass kids.</br></br>  If the sharingan can see through genjutus then how did Sasuke and Itachi have their ENTIRE scene of Genjutsu fighting before deciding to fight for real.  <br>If the "super secret surprise announcement" is that Naruto Z/GT is getting the greenlight for a serialized continuation or a regular movie release cycle, Burrito is virtually guaranteed to get the tenseigan or comparable hacks.<br><br>It's against the very nature of battle shonen to not have power inflation, and hyuga stuff is definitely being built up in the two most recent films.</br></br></br>   CTRL + F <br> Naruto is a g <br> 0 results found <br><br>Is this what it has come to, /a/?<br><br>Where am I supposed to go now?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd assume that Naruto and Sasuke either aren't as powerful as they were when younger or somewhere along the timeline they agreed to not use the full extent of their powers and/or were told not to by other leaders</br>  <br>Away.</br>  <br> there is already enough boruto hinata incest pics <br> Show me. </br></br>  <br>same for kakashi and obito pre-fight. kishi just has no idea how to deal with genjutsu consistently</br>  <br>He won't get magic eyes, or at least not powers directly related to his eyes. Naruto's eyes changed too but only represented his power-ups.</br>  <br>They were each trying to end the fight with a genjutsu before having to physically fight.</br>  <br>I dunno,how bout to a thread you actually want to participate in?</br>  I don't really care fuck-all about reading the rest of the manga or anime, but can anyone tell me how Sasuke ended up? I know he lives and gets the Rinnegan, but is he like... exiled from every society forever for being a MASSIVE terrorist?  <br> spoonfeeding <br><br>Anon, you know that´s not how it works here.</br></br></br>  <br> but is he like... exiled from every society forever for being a MASSIVE terrorist? <br>He's teaching the Hokage's son in the movie.</br></br>  <br>pardoned for saving the world. By all rights should have been executed</br>  <br> get told not to by other leaders <br><br>How do you force someone 100 times more powerful than you to do this ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pierrot is keeping consistency over their designs rather than sticking to Kishi's heights (Kishi's naruto is taller than Sasuke, Pierrot's isn't)</br></br>  <br>Due to his action in the war and Naruto and Kakashi (who was Hokage at the time) vouching for him, he was formally forgiven.<br>Currently, he's traveling around the world and through different dimensions in search of the threat Kaguya was getting ready to fight and to atone for what he did.</br></br>  <br>Nope. He gets let off scott free because he helped in the final fight and because Kakashi, who was the hokage at the time, vouched for him. As an adult, Sasuke is an official shinobi of the Leaf who's out on missions all the time.</br>  <br>Didn't Kishi personally make all the designs for the movie?</br>  <br> in search of the threat Kaguya was getting ready to fight <br>I can't remember this part</br></br>  <br>Naw, he was exonerated...in fact so was Kabuto and Orochimaru. They got away with everything.</br>  I hope they just haven't shown it in the trailers. I need to see Naruto Jesus again.  <br>Anyone have pic with Kakashi saying that Naruto told him he is pardoned ?</br>  <br>It's not about power, it's about  politics. </br>  <br>When Kaguya showed up either she or Zetsu said she was building an army to fight something.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh my god Is Naruto going to go full Gurren Laggan with fucking planetary battles</br></br></br>  <br>do we even know it's Sauce's<br> &gt;it's Itachi's so he'll be a good older brother </br></br>  <br> hey you 2, just stop please or we don´t trade with you <br> gets conquered next day by ninja god <br><br>If only Naruto wasn´t such a peace loving faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You must have forgotten the last page ever of pre-epilogue Naruto.</br>  requesting that picture with salad, jojis kid and a third one when they're older  <br>He just wants to protect his cozy village family before it gets completely taken over by modernization and the future</br>  <br>You need an occupation force to conquer somebody.</br>  I'm getting audio from the 1080 version but no video.

I'm trying to get merch. Here's the twitter link from the store.<br>https://twitter.com/ichijinshaevent<wbr>/status/624595517310263296<br><br> Buyfagging seems hard </br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Is illya going up today? I can't wait any longer.  <br> bishoujo <br> slut <br>Heh.</br></br></br>  <br>Merida and Vanellope were fine. Frozen is just shit.</br>  <br>Something about this particular line of raibus looks really flat to me. For such a colourful show they look so monotone.</br>        <br>Yes, plently. Manufacturers nowadays overlook this massively and it's a huge shame.</br>  <br>Sometimes Toranoana has merch, but it never seems to stick around long. You'll probably have to wait and lurk Mandarake or Suruga-ya to find what you want.</br>  <br>I was really tempted to buy her but the exclusive thing hurts, though on the other hand it will at least not be shipping rape anymore. I hope we get more pictures of her on Sunday. I really want to see how she looks in not so polished pictures first.</br>  <br>I hope you're aware that's photoshopped</br>  <br>Amazing news captain obvious</br>  <br>always glad to help!</br>  <br>I wish this was real</br>    <br>Oh well, guess I'll give up on it then.

I wish I had several dicks.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Probably. I've seen dakis stay up for order for a while on older series' pages, but if it's something new and popular it'll be gone fast. Might get reprints though, I've seen those a few times. Things like keychains tend to go fast too.<br><br><br>If you set up FigInStock alerts for Mandarake or use the site's own keyword alert function you might get lucky.

I was holding out hope that MF's Hestia would be nicer than Amakuni's.</br>  <br>But how could it have gotten any better than perfection?</br>  I ate some bean sprouts in preparation for Yomi by Alter for sure this WF.  <br>For starters it could have been literally any other character.</br>  <br>girls have 4 holes</br>  <br>I can think of eight and maybe one more.</br>  I want this.  <br>you can't really use the nostrils or ears for sex though</br>  Soon.  <br>you aren't trying hard enough.</br>  <br> by alter <br>BEAN<br>SPROUTS</br></br></br>  <br>I want this, but not the lewd sides.</br>  <br> No pubes <br>Sorry anon but it's shit.</br></br>  <br>There seems to be little hope for any Senran but the Hanzo girls and Yumi to get decent figures. The all the Crimson girls except Yomi got at least one shitty figure, not counting the niitengo.</br>  <br>I've been looking for that Miku cover for a long time. Fearing I may have to settle for a bootleg. Either way, nice taste.</br>  <br>Maybe you should put some effort into it.</br>  <br>She'll get an Alter figure in my heart. This is foolproof.</br>  <br> no pubes </br>   Megaman Nendoroid <br><br>I'm buying 2.</br></br>  <br><br>Forgot pic.</br></br>  I don't know about you but I prefer my figures with broken spines.    is it wonfes yet    <br>Hope we get a Roll and Proto Man out of this as well.</br>  <br>My favorite is so unpopular even my heart can't even imagine a scale of her being made. It'd be too painful.</br>  <br>Soon. What are you looking forward to?</br>    <br>Is it Murakumo?</br>    <br><br><br>I honestly don't know why people are against her face, it looks fucking exactly like Tama, not only like in the art she's based from but also on the anime she makes that expression all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry I don't have a needle dick like you</br>  <br>I'd feel less despair if it were.  __Imu__ </br>  <br>a figure from a show i liked in the past that never got squat<br>like witch craft works or amagi brilliant park<br><br>i am braced for disappointment and also boats</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can hardly believe anyone likes her.</br>  This is probably the only real chance to get a figure for a favorite character of mine, but really don´t know if I should get it.<br>It´s....too lewd.</br>  <br>I agree, the other figure is so much better.</br>  <br>That's what multiple dicks are for dumbass. Guess you got all defensive and forgot about the topic?</br>  <br>I'd be happy with just 2 large throbbing members, so I can anal and vaginal at the same time</br>  soon  <br>buy the alter one.</br>  <br> Lewd Gochuusagis <br>How dare they do this to my daughteru</br></br>  need to see that Starry Miku from RoB, I really hope we get to see a sculpt atleast  Is smug loli in stock anywhere or am I fucked? I couldn't decide which ver I wanted and when I finally did it was too late. Willing to go proxy if need be.  <br>Also soon, would prefer a scale but at least it's something for best CV</br>  <br>Child bearing hips</br>  Still hoping. <br><br><br>No, but SOON.</br></br></br>  <br>Buyfags don't play games or watch anime. Note they only buy lewd figures of OCs and flavor of the month like Hestia. If it's not meant to be hotglued, it's shit. Half the people posting Tama don't know where she's from.</br>  <br>pretty much.</br>  Up.  <br><br>I was going to call this shitpost, but with the amount of<br><br> face looks off <br> it looks weird <br><br>And the likes a lot of figures get here it makes you wonder if most of them even know the source of said figures.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Figma Kirishikuma <br><br>Likely a figma Haruna or Takao or Kongou to follow?</br></br>  <br>Precisely why I don't dare to dream for her to get any figures ever. She doesn't even get New Wave cards.</br>  <br>Just yesterday people were rapidly posting about slutty Illya and Kuro and asking about the source material. Only reason people want them is because naked loli. They weren't even upset they added bikinis to them when the source image had them nude because they don't know of it.</br>  <br><br>Face is good otherwise but that mouth is horrifying. I wish they'd have given her teeth.</br></br>  I hope GSC final does a CCS figure, figma are nice, but I need a scale. <br><br>Also, will they ever deliver those figures from that 2012 poll? I need Billy re-release and figma Gil. <br><br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's like you guys don't even know it's norm/a/l in here now.  How likely this one is a Knights of Sidonia character sitting on top of Tsumugi?   ¥22,240 in Solajewris <br> ¥16,000 in amazon japan <br><br>How is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of buyfags that can't recognise the source. Even if you haven't seen it, simply browsing this shithole should familiarise you with 90% of figures posted here. I mean fuck, how do you post on /a/ and not be able to recognise fucking Illya?</br>  <br>shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>I thought most fans knew she was a huge fucking slut. Didn't you pick up on the subtext?</br>  <br>Because they don't. That or they're genuinely stupid, which wouldn't surprise me.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br/>  <br>It's great that we're getting the Chino nendo, but i hope the Alice nendo is also displayed</br>  <br>The bikinis actually made me decide not to pre-order. But yeah, it astounds me how many people here either don't know where things are from or are too fucking retarded to just look it up on Google.</br>  <br>That's not even the problem. The face does look like in the illustration, but open mouth and those eyes just don't look good in 3D.</br>  <br>That I was: a man with anime as a main entertainment source, with own opinion on the best show/score/girl of the season, with something to look forward during work week<br>That I am now:<br> what a nice figure, maybe I should watch or read that to justify buying <br>Gross consumerism shrine.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I like, and I usually hate that kind of expressions on most figures, but in this particular case all that does is scream "TAMA BATTORU" whenever I see it. <br><br>Even from the Nendo only the expression of pic gave me the same feeling. <br>I'll wait till after Wonfest to pre-order though, 22800Y is not cheap and since it's almost a year away I want to see what else is likely going to be released around that time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even browse /a/ that much outside of buyfag and haven't seen many series in the last few years and even I can recognize most of what gets posted here. It's not even hard.</br>  <br>too bad she doesn't look much like the illustration</br>  <br>Blue and the other protags never.</br>  <br><br>I can't tell which one of those looks worse. Both look like dudes at least. <br>Do people actually think this looks good?</br></br></br>  <br>Her legs and body angle make no sense in the illustration.</br>  <br>The figure looks better.</br>  <br>I like how she looks in the figure.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>i wouldn't buy, as i dont care fore DC/Marvel - but i find this one looks beautyful</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm gonna say the figure looks better. Her pose is more natural and she doesn't look undead.</br></br>  <br>You too slow</br>  <br><br><br>Wish they made her left hand different, in the figure she looks like saying<br><br> WHAT U LOOKING AT HOMIE!? WANNA FIGHT!? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying that's not what's going on in the illustration </br>  <br>I guess it matches the illustration's nigger face.</br>  <br><br><br>disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>I want this</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT I KNOW WHO IT IS</br>  <br>it's lala</br>  <br>Bet it's actually Lal'C instead.</br>  <br>order her or not?</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br>she looks retarded</br>  <br>Man i just don't like Nendos that much, I hope they make scales or Figmas later</br>  <br>you mean the face or pose?</br>  <br>face and pose, you should pass this one.</br>  <br><br>It is definitely Nono</br></br>  <br>The pose is probably one of the worst in recent memory, but the face isn't doing it any favours either.</br>  <br>feminine scum detected</br>  <br>  It´s....too lewd. <br>For what? It'll be fine, anon...</br></br>  <br>weak</br>  <br>It looks like you can remove her clothes. Does this have a cast off feature?</br>  <br>Prototypes usually have visible seams like that. It will probably be forced cast-off.</br>  <br> figmas <br>They look better on nendos or scales.</br></br>  Does the release of Insight mean there will be some more Utsusu figures in the works?  <br> finally a figure of Miuna <br> GK <br>Of fucking course.</br></br></br>  <br> Nagi No Asukara will never get good figures </br>  Why does /a/ think we get so few really HQ male figures, particularly from GSC ?  <br> Miuna <br>I don't even fucking care that its GK I need it.</br></br>  <br>Goodbye pure childhood memories, Im going to stain you with my cum</br>  <br> Hotgluing your figures </br>  <br>Because until very recently that was absolutely the case?</br>  <br>Damn this is cute</br>  <br>What are you talking about, faggot? You're getting OR from now on.</br>  <br>OR?</br>  <br>Sorry, I meant to say LR, as in lurk more.</br>  <br>My guess is sword boys.</br>  <br> not taking it in the ass and buying 15k preowned alter momohime <br><br>Are you gay or something?</br></br></br>  Caped Baldy is getting a nendo.  Saitama  <br>Sword boys is three figures so far. (Have to admit I've preordered one).<br>Apart from that, we've had, what, a few Kamen Rider figures, Lelouch and Suzaku who are impossible to get hold of, a couple of FSN characters, Kyon and Itsuki, vocaloids and that's about it.<br>SNK's boosted it, but that's been in the last 12 months, and tbh, SNK's a weird case in terms of merch full stop...<br>I think, in total, even including SNK, we've had under 50 figures total (1/8, Nendos and Figma from GSC).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Saitamamind</br></br>  <br/>  <br/>  <br> I will never have this <br> GK <br>Life is cruel. Someone just shoot me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I hoped that he'd get a proper figure</br></br>  <br>Eh, knowing GSC, they'll chuck out the nendo to sate the fans to begin with, then follow up, bout six months later, with a sss-tier figure.</br>  Just a question, is it worth lying about a packages' value to avoid customs charges in Canada? Even if shipping is EMS?  <br>He will. The anime will be popular, can't see this being all she wrote.</br>  <br>Anon I got this for like $50.</br>  <br>He wasn't talking about swordshit retard. <br>I'm surprised you're this interested in male figures and don't even know what the new upcoming line of male figures by GSC/MF is called.</br></br>  <br><br>She looks too tall and old for Rin. Still nice, would buy, about time Rin got a good scale.</br></br>  soon?  <br>God damn it I'm running out of money and semen.</br>  <br> The anime will be popular <br>Welp better brace yourselves for shitposting</br></br>  <br>Oh, you mean Orange Rouge?<br>Yeah, prepare to pay like 50% extra for those.<br>And, again, swordboys everywhere. <br>Odd choices with Haikyuu characters, too...Would have thought Kenma was a cert.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I could probably tell you if I was Canadian.</br>  Maybe August, if she isn't delayed again.  <br> The anime will be popular <br>Maybe, maybe not, the manga is only popular among online hipsters, that is half of /a/ but that's it</br></br>  <br>It depends on if you can make up a believable lie. I've done it before with GKs and haven't been called out on it, but I've also never had to pay customs on anything so I don't know how bad it truly is.</br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-24/vertical-adds-mysterio<wbr>us-girlfriend-x-the-gods-lie-devil-<wbr>line-manga/.90846<br><br> MGX <br>At some point I loved the manga, now I feel like it arrived after everyone hated the last half of the series and ending</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>hopefully Hajime figures too<br>Sugane too</br></br>    <br>You're right, but if someone were taking bets I'd go for it being popular.</br>  The bike looks good. That's it. Rest looks like shit.  <br><br>Utsutsu and Hajime have Nendoroids in the works. I want Rui and OD figures too.</br></br>  We seriously need more figures with gaping assholes.  <br>We just need figures of all the Gatchaman characters tbh</br>  <br>let's start with you</br>  <br>I'd love some figures of the gatcha forms.</br>  <br><br><br>I don't need it, I don't need it,  I NEED IT </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>I wish i knew, Anon</br>  <br>ok seibahfag</br>  <br>But I don't look that good, I don't think anyone would want a figure of me.</br>  <br>Kobato</br>  <br>Although, showing everyone around the world my gaping asshole in a form they can display... that's pretty hot. How are we doing this, anon?</br>  <br>you can start by  go fuck yourself </br>  <br>Does anyone know what her preorder window will be? I do not see Shinazu No Himegimi listed on Native's website and MFC is silent on this. Maybe the source that provided that painted image had info?<br><br>Pic unrelated.</br></br></br>  <br>i hope melt-san melts that person in your picture</br>  <br>Already did, got so horny from imagining my figure that I stuffed my ass. What now? How do you plan to make a figure?</br>  <br>That's honestly fucking sickening.</br>  <br>What emotion is her face supposed to convey?</br>  <br>Why do so many girls like Sonico?</br>  <br>Triggered.</br>  <br><br> I should have fapped before buying and now I'm broke and banned from amiami. Thanks /a/ </br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because she's cute and has big tits.</br>  <br>She's cute, her proportions are nice, and sometimes she gets some really interesting designs and poses. Especially the ones like pic related.</br>  <br>why was it delayed</br>  <br>Why do so many guys like Benten? <br> But then very loudly need to pronounce that they're not gay and therefore can't get him or some shit like that? <br><br>Hint: It's the overall nice interesting design and outfit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Does anyone know what her preorder window will be? I do not see Shinazu No Himegimi listed on Native's website and MFC is silent on this. Maybe the source that provided that painted image had info? <br>So.... anybody want to take a swing at this?</br></br>  <br> her proportions are nice </br>  <br> Why do so many guys like Benten? <br>Who?</br></br>  http://nintendoeverything.com/fire-<wbr>emblem-fates-manga-announced/<br><br> Kibayashi on story <br> Kozaki on art <br><br>Both the original game authors are on board, so color me excited.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  Honestly, I'd think the only thing in the series that could be adapted well to other media would be the first arc of Awakening. Then again, I haven't been paying too much attention to Fates, so maybe I'm wrong.  <br>From all I've seen, Fates is just as anime/manga-friendly as Awakening if not more. Stuff like the battles would have to be condensed of course, but character-wise it has lots of anime archetypes and relationships that would translate well into an actual anime series. Also ever-increasing fanservice.<br><br>Fates splits into three completely different story paths though, I wonder if the manga will just pick one to adapt over the others.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying it would be anything other than Hoshido </br>  <br>Can't be. If you go Hoshido you can't have both imoutos survive, nobody wants that.</br>  <br>It will totally be the team-up path so as not to kill anyones waifu.</br>  <br>Oh boy, they'll totally go the open/harem route with Kamui's wife, won't they?</br>  Another Fire Emblem OVA when?  I just want more best girl  <br>That's not Oboro</br>  <br>I've never realised how odd that thing on her head looks. It's like she clipped a table cloth to a bandana.</br>  <br>for what purpose? she'll pic related anyway.</br>  <br> Kozaki on art <br>Huh, maybe this is why he keeps putting Donyatsu on mini-hiatus.  ;_; </br></br>  When is this coming out in the west anyway?  <br>Q1 2016.</br>  <br>Welp, just enough time to finish that Awakening support log then.</br>  Hoshido route: Fate route<br><br>Nohr route: UBW route<br><br>Third route: Heaven's Feel route</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not even remotely close. Why would you even make that comparison?</br>  <br>Hoshido seems like the super vanilla route<br>Nohr is a bit edgier than the former<br>Invisible is when unexpected shit hits the fan, like in Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br>   adapting the most retarded FE story yet <br>Oh boy</br>  Anime when?  <br>But this isn't Sacred Stones.</br>  <br>What's wrong with it?</br>  <br>I guess if they do Hoshido it's not as bad, but Nohr path is so fucking dumb it beats out fucking Blood Pacts in retardedness.</br>  <br>If Fomortiis was a dragon the story would have been the same as any other FE</br>  <br> best girl <br><br>Sorry, wrong girl.</br></br></br>  Aw shit nigga<br>Time for canon supports</br>  <br>But that's not Awakening</br>    <br> Awakening <br> bad story <br> implying it wasn't the most intricate and thought provoking story in the FE franchise to date </br></br></br>  <br>Oh, you really think that?<br>Explain to me how Awakening is the Boku no Pico of vidya then.</br></br>  <br>But this'll create the idea of "canon" relationships, causing even more warring.</br>  <br>Not like it matters much, since in the end the only thing people care about are eugenics</br>  <br> mfw Fire Emblem has finally been upgraded to one of Nintendo's flagship titles </br>  <br>please take your fate shit somewhere else.</br>  <br>But at what cost?</br>  <br>Stop comlaining, the gameplay in Fates is one of the best we got in years.</br>  <br>Everything</br>  <br> thinking awakening's story is worse than nohr's </br>  <br>How so</br>  Oh man, now I don't have to wait for a 3DS emulator to get perfected before getting my FE fix on.  <br> Kozaki on art </br>  <br>Nohr is the darkest route, clearly it'd be HF.</br>  <br><br>Real best girl here.</br></br>  <br>Even with the stupidity of IK route, it does not match the clusterfuck of Radiant Dawn blood pacts, black knight, Rebellion in crimea etc</br>  I'd be more interested if Kozaki was doing everything, honestly. Donyatsu has better writing than any Fire Emblem game.  <br>Damn, she gets cute with every FE entry.<br>The Anna of FE 25 will be a singularity of cuteness</br></br>  <br>you're never ever getting a figure annafag. Just stop already, you didn't even come top 10 in the awakening poll.</br>  What studio is did the cutscenes for Awakening and if? This is some of the best CG I've ever seen.  <br>Only if it has my nigga Swoleo.</br>  <br>worst child, it's a shame since Leon is cool.</br>  <br> draw a girl <br> give it huge gains <br> call it a boy </br></br></br>  <br>Is this game out?</br>  <br>In japan</br>  <br>That's not Leo's actual ingame model is it?</br>  <br>Geneology had a damn good manga</br>  <br>boy you are in for a surprise</br>  <br>It's not leo, it's his shitty son.</br>  <br>His name is Foleo</br>  <br>Studio , according to Wikpedia</br>  <br>Studio comma?</br>  It better not be fucking Hoshido  Is it true in the west they are selling it as two seperate games? (pokemon style) Wasn't it just one in Japan and you just choose your path in the beginning?  <br>Japan:<br>Buy one of the two Games, the other paths are DLC<br>OR<br>Buy the special Edition that has both Byakuya and Anya, 3d path is still dlc</br></br></br></br>  <br> Manga version <br> not Yamato Damashii <br>Yeah right.<br>Expect to watch every Nohr sibiling getting killed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's always been two versions. Though I guess it's more Zelda Oracles than Pokémon, since it's different plots and characters and all that.<br>And then there's Invisible Kingdom, which is basically the true route... and is DLC. I swear, Fire Emblem is Nintendo's foray into the world of downloadable content jewishness.</br></br>  I just hope more Camilla art comes out of this  <br>camilla a shit</br>  <br>They claim each route/path has an entire game worth of content. "Claim" being the key word, we don't know yet. I want to believe them though.</br>  <br>You a shit</br>  Okay : You guys need to understand Fates story is it's WEAKEST fucking element.<br><br>This is set up. This conflict was sold as being between two sides who had valid reasons for what they are doing.<br><br>Now : Let's observe what Hoshido looks like</br></br></br></br>  Lissa a best.<br><br>Asumi Kana is love.</br></br>  <br>This, lissa gives you the best family. <br><br>Cordelia and Olivia are up there too since they give amazing kids.</br></br></br>  <br>They have a fucking skyscraper?</br>  <br>and this is Nohr.<br><br>The bias should be self evident.<br><br>The story in the Hoshido version of the game is your typical "Good Peace loving Japanese people defeat the big bad empire" filled with a bunch of pointless deaths for shock value.<br><br>The story in Nohr however is you fucking around for most of the game because you don't want to fight the poor little Hoshido people until you realize "I need to get Garon on the throne of Hoshido because it'll reveal he's a slime monster"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This faggot<br> has good mag and terrible strength <br> the only way to give him okay strength is Vaike, and this kills his skills <br> his best dads make him a magic user <br><br>Fuck him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like an MtG terrain</br>  <br> he's back in fates<br>and he actually reclassed to spellcaster before coming this time</br> </br>  <br><br><br>Basically a summary of the three routes stories<br><br>Hoshido: Typical FE story, defeat big bad in the end, nothing really out of the ordinary.<br><br>Nohr: Has the dumbest plot known to mankind, even worse than RD bloodpact shit<br><br>IK: Pretty retarded at some parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't give a shit about the story, I just wanna rub my big sister's face.</br></br>  <br>I've heard that's a crock of bullshit, but that's just me.</br>  <br> not marrying lissa yourself and making morgan and owain grandmasters so you can have a qt grandmaster family </br>  <br> Herpderp why is the evil side actually evil? <br><br>I've been following this game closely and all I see are Nohr fanboys hyping up their game and got a golden plate of shit and fall back when called out for their shitposting.</br></br></br>  Yes. You read that right. <br><br>Fates is home to so many retarded plot elements it's insane.<br><br>These plot elements include<br><br> A Magic Barrier that makes anyone who invades Hoshido lose their will to fight against Hoshido, powered by Mikoto (Your Mom). You can also guess how long she lives after this is revealed <br> A curse saying that if you mention the name of a kingdom outside said kingdom, you'll turn into bubbles and die. (This is the crux of the Invisible Kingdom route, where you have to convince everyone to side with you against the real threat BUT CAN'T FUCKING SAY ANYTHING YOU JUST GO YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME) <br>Once again : A Magic Chair that reveals peoples true forms. In the Nohr route this is how you feel the best way to convince your family into fighting against Garon. This also involves you conquering all of Hoshido just to GET the chair. <br>In both Hoshido and Nohr : Aqua attempts to assassinate Garon with the power of dance. In Hoshido she gets a wizard to cast and illusion so no one will no who she is. In Nohr she puts on a sexy outfit and nobody figures out it's her. She also gets a bunch of innocent dancers executed for no reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, it was so obvious that Nohr was the evil side, I don't know why people are so surprised about this. Did people actually think that Nohr and hoshido were both good sides?</br>  <br>Annafags are so boring.<br><br>There's so many GOAT, god tier girls each game and they always pick the same girl every time.</br></br></br>  <br>Welp.  After all that effort grinding him into a decent physical pair-up bot. </br>  <br><br><br>Except that this is addressed in story quite a lot.<br><br>In fact, one of Azura and Kamui's conversations is them talking about how it's unfair to call Nohr war-mongering, since they live in fucking Mordor and need to expand their territory to maintain prosperity, whereas the Hoshidans basically got handed Eden on a stick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nohr is evil <br><br>No, Touma is evil.<br>People in Nohr are just very very very retardely stubborn. Because they've got to make Hoshido the poor little dindunuffins.<br><br>Despite the fact that Hoshido's the one with the mind rape barrier, Hoshido's the one constantly sending assassins without getting called on it, Hoshido's the one who actually coordinate and get a bunch of innocent by standers killed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good thing FE has never had a good story and I wasn't expecting one.<br><br>As long as the gameplay is good and I can't waste a sufficient amount of time playing it I have nothing to complain about. <br><br>In fact, the characters used to be kind of bland, but now they are all basically anime characters and even though they are all just stereotypes they are at least fun. Then throw in the supports, the face rubbing, the whole custom town or whatever with your own maid and butler. It is all stupid but I will like it anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hi /feg/  I will be very happy if Effie is in it  <br> Nohr is actually the good side, Hoshido is the evil one! </br>  <br> Nohr isn't evil <br> non-slime Garon dicked many women to the point they neglected their own kids  <br> Garon and Iago are literally evil <br> Clear was a shit father <br> Belka kills people for fun <br> Zero tortures people for fun <br> Charlotte is literally a crazy prostitute <br> Xander is literally a Camus and kills his own real little sister <br>Fastest way to spot a Nohrcuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but Nohr has the best  husbandos </br>  <br> &gt;Belka kills people for fun <br>She is pretty much a professional hitman<br><br>Charlotte is a golddigger, not crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> non-slime Garon dicked many women to the point they neglected their own kids  <br> Garon and Iago are literally evil <br>Real Garon was actually a pretty good person and even the siblings said that he was a kind father. The concubines were the ones that neglected their own kids.<br><br>Can't argue about Iago but the Garon we see in game isn't the real Garon.<br><br> Clear was a shit father <br>Yeah, poor Flora.<br><br> Belka kills people for fun <br>Nah, only kills people if its her mission but not just for fun. Kind of like a hired Assassin.<br><br> Zero tortures people for fun <br>Not really, he tortures people who deserve it or he thinks that deserves it. His whole sadism stuff is just to make people back away from him but he's a pretty cool guy.<br><br> Charlotte is literally a crazy prostitute <br> crazy <br>Charlotte is not even crazy or a prostitute. Just a gold digger that wants money for her poor family.<br><br> Xander is literally a Camus and kills his own real little sister <br>Well, he's literally Camus but he accidentally killed his own little sister. Its not like he wanted to do it.<br><br><br><br> True. Zero is my husbando. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You chose the wrong picture silly.

I think the mangaka's characters even replaced Roy's role in the story at some point.</br>  <br>I could see it working if it was more of a space fantasy than a sleek, modern sci-fi setting. Star Wars is plenty romantic, wouldn't you say?</br>   Hoshidofags <br>Please leave this place forever.</br>  <br>Shit what the fuck<br><br>That was so hype<br> Too bad he was merely being possessed </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> that fucking Gunther reveal <br><br>Invisible might have been kind of shit but there were pretty unexpected things.<br><br> Sorry for your loss. <br><br><br><br>Yeah, that's why I said Sawano could do good stuff.<br><br>X was pretty good but there are more of his works that are pretty repetitive like A/Z.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The threads when that path was leaked where the best threads I'd ever been in, shit was cash.</br>  <br>no</br>  Roy's our boy! Roy's our boy!  <br>Why do people get so mad over the curse?</br>  <br>I wanted to quote<br>  and I'm talking about the two deaths that came before Azura's. </br></br>  <br>Oh, that makes sense, I like that idea. My train of thought was going in the wrong direction.</br>  <br> story isn't really good <br>That's true for a lot of shit that gets adapted to anime.</br></br>  <br> Space guns and shit instead of bows, I guess. Doesn't have the same romantic feeling, though. <br>Have you ever watched LoGH? That one isn't even medieval (1800s) and pulls off the romantic space opera tone a space FE should have (but not as stone-faced serious).</br></br>  <br>Well yeah because the two characters were written, especially in convos, as people who knew and love you and the circumstances are very tragic.<br><br> that elise and marx convo <br><br>Would have felt bad for Ryouma at least but he is just boring, and after the bullshit Takumi pulled in Hoshido path and being a nuisance in Nohr I was glad to put him down for good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FE9 had the best plot out of all the game except maybe FE4. FE10, however, was pure concentrated bullshit. Micaiah worst girl and Mary Sue.</br>  <br>How about  Space Bows </br>  <br>both are fucking cute.</br>  <br> glad to put him down for good. </br>  I hope the manga has Femui somewhere in it.  <br>It just a cheap way from anyone saying anything about the Invisible kingdom but, its nothing as bad as some of the plot points in Nohr.</br>  <br><br>Nohr side's deaths don't come near the emotional impact of the Hoshido side's. Ryouma and Takumi are dicks to you throughout the Nohr route after meeting your for like, two days. Everyone that dies in Hoshido you've spent years with.</br></br>  <br><br> Nohr has better gameplay and is just like the old FE games <br> has the shittiest story <br> Hoshido is just Awakening lite but a bit better <br> has the better story <br><br>I'm so disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not that much better, it may be less retarded, but its still bad. You're not playing this game for the story, and I mean all of IF if you don't want to leave disappointed.</br>  <br>Get IK<br> better story than Nohr <br> Better gameplay than Hoshido <br> best ending <br><br>Too bad you gotta pay extra...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is this manga gonna be based on the story, or is it just side story shorts like awakenings?  <br>I liked awakening and I like hoshido more than nohr.</br>  <br>We don't know.</br>  <br> your waifu gets cucked <br>I mean I guess I'll just go for Azura there but still.</br></br>  <br><br>I know that Hoshido is no better than Nohr but at least its less retarded.<br><br>Of course, you don't play any FE game for the story at all but I kind of was expecting both good gameplay and good story for Fates.<br><br>Oh well, at least it got better gameplay than both Hoshido and IK.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IK is a gimmicky piece of shit where half the cast is worthless because they come at level 10 at the buttend of the game and half the maps are gimmicky garbage, fuck IK, it has nothing going for it outside of the fact that you can get everyone.</br>  <br>Well this time they actually promised a good story, and that's why people are pissed. They did the whole bait and switch.</br>  <br>Pick Nohr and stop giving ISIS your money there, just mash start when the story starts.</br>  <br> A curse saying that if you mention the name of a kingdom outside said kingdom, you'll turn into bubbles and die. (This is the crux of the Invisible Kingdom route, where you have to convince everyone to side with you against the real threat BUT CAN'T FUCKING SAY ANYTHING YOU JUST GO YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME) <br>Was writing it down also impossible? Usually when the spoken word is cursed, the written word doesn't come to mind.</br></br>  Yeah just give me a Bravely Default anime already.  <br>They promise a better story than Awakening which we got didn't say it'll be good or not.</br>  <br> those stats <br>More like Gainz</br></br>  <br> wanting another Endless Eight <br>As expected of Ledouche</br></br>  <br> tfw going to get all 3 routes <br> tfw going to go for Aqua in all of them <br><br>I will suffer for 2 routes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lunatic!Nohr 26 is fun.</br>   fates <br> not awakening <br> no tharja <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Well in my opinion none of them had a better story than Awakening and hiring a writer that capable, but then having him reveal he only did the outline because IS wanted a good grasp of control is terrible. They also lied about not needing other paths or the third path to get the full story. They lied about a bunch of stuff really.</br>  <br>I'm only going to marry azura because I like the thought of having two kids.<br><br>Then it's pretty much femui for the rest.</br></br></br>  <br> Tharjafags showing up <br><br>Well it was good while it lasted.</br></br></br>  <br> tharja <br> liking babby's first waifu </br></br>  I really fucking hate the current art direction of the series.  <br><br> liking Awakening AND Tharja <br><br>Get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself tharjacuck</br></br>  <br> caring about fire emblem before awakening <br><br>lel</br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Fates improved with the armor designs and many other things compared to Awakening's horrible Knight designs.</br></br>  <br>Just because Titania was 10/10 doesn't mean most of PoR's designs weren't generic as hell.</br>  so is this going to prove once and for all that IK is the canon route and Aqua is the canon waifu?  Why are people acting like this is new, there are dozens of FE manga  So are they going to cut chapters from the manga and sell those as separate mangas too?  <br>Ironic considering the true path takes place in space. How do they get back home?</br>  <br>I know people shitpost about this a lot but I actually kind of agree with it. I wouldn't say canon route but I do think it's the most important route and aqua is basically the "canon" waifu.</br>  <br>The senerios of their plot alnoe where better than Awakening just excution wasn't good enough.Maybe this manga will be different since it seems Kibayashi has more control than in the games.</br>  <br>I'll take generic over retardedly overdesigned any day.</br>  <br>Anon, you're not making any sense.</br>  <br>Well the Nohr siblings backstory with all that concubine stuff and the lives surrounding the servants and being another makeshift family to the MC were the only stuff that intrigued me.</br>  <br>If/Fates' generics are pretty good.</br>  <br>Tellius designs looked like shit, Titania being a 10/10 doesn't change that.</br>  <br>I want to fuck him</br>  <br>No it's just more advertisement to pay more gold to get the jew wife that is more jewish than Anna.</br>  <br><br>I really like the designs for the Mercs and Heroes in this game.<br><br>Many classes have great designs in this game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IK, probably.<br>A canon waifu, hahahahahaha surely you can't be serious.</br></br>  <br> more jewish than Anna <br><br>is such a thing even possible?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, this plot point alone renders assassination weapon obsolete.<br> corner enemy <br> make them read a document with the "forbidden word" on it <br> they die <br>Quick and bloodless. Is it also painless?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's best and most canon so you might as well, it's her and Kaumi's route anyways<br><br><br>Half the cast is worthless because you get all the Royals and the whole cast in a route that's just as long as the old one, nohr babies are butthurt they get their units last but it's balanced since nohr units tend to have better growths than Hoshi ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This shit reminds me of  TGT </br>  <br>You're right, anon. Toilet bowl armor is much better.</br>  <br>I barley come to this board anymore and I already know your a huge faggot.</br>  <br> cherrypicking this hard </br>  I want to lick Rinkah's painted abs!  Wada designs &gt; All  <br>Okay, so we're just completely ignoring all cavaliers and knights then. How about bird cages and buttons?</br>  <br>Their designs almost makes me want a Generics Emblem.</br>    <br>Awakening and Tellius both looked like shit, I don't see how that changes anything.</br>  <br> that maid <br>Making an army of maids as soon as I can.</br></br>  <br> he didn't like Lissa's outfit </br>  <br> liking Tharja <br><br>Consider suicide.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking lissa's design <br><br>seriously nigger</br></br></br>   tfw always heard good things about FE <br> tfw I can't play it because I don't have 3DS </br>  <br>Lissa is cute as heck you fag.</br>    <br>save money then</br>  <br>You know that crinolines are a real thing people used to wear, right?</br>  <br> the generic maid already looks better than the obtainable maids </br>    <br> All those people who thought she would become the monster of strength in this game <br> IS made her instead one of the worst units thanks to terrible growths </br></br>  <br> that guy 2nd to the left in the top row <br><br>hnnnnnnng<br><br>The guy in the middle row on the very left is cute too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just promote her to sage then. Her sage costume is great.</br>  <br>The cage is a real thing. How do you think they get dresses to look that huge?<br>The question, though, is why is she wearing that on a battlefield.</br></br>  <br>It's that I'm afraid that I will buy a 3DS only for that. At the moment I can only think of another game that I would like to play and that it's on 3DS</br>  <br> Have to ruin most characters to do this <br> Will have to play on normal or below to make it work <br>Oh well, it will be worth it.<br><br><br>Hey, hey, Flora is cute looking too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's a staffbot.</br>  <br><br>Her design is great, fuck you.<br><br>And also the cages were something people used to actually wear.<br><br><br><br>Go play the GBA FEs, anon.<br><br><br><br><br>I fucking love the Outlaw and Adventurer designs, they are great.<br><br>Lancer class desgin is also pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can get a used 2ds for like 40-50 bucks. I don't know if you like pokemon but you can get that too, and super smash brothers. Plus you can get awakening as well.</br>  <br>What's the problem? The 3DS one is one of the best to avoid. Play the SNES, GBA, GC/Wii, and second DS one instead.</br>  <br> Micaiah <br> Mary Sue <br> The entirety of her involvement in P3 has her fuck up over and over again as she tries to solve Pelleas fuck up.  <br> Meanwhile Ike wins everything and any loss his side had wasn't even his fault. Not to mention that anyone who hates him is portrayed to be crazy, evil and/or misguided. </br></br></br></br>  <br> The 3DS one is one of the best to avoid <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br><br> people still perpetuating this myth  <br><br>She's a tank, not a slugger. She's got some of the best def and res growths in the game. Stop talking shit about mai waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening is shit compared to fucking Shadow Dragon, all it's good for is for shipping, grinding and eugenics, it's dull to actually play through.</br>  <br><br>Those things actually existing doesn't make them not stupid</br></br>  <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Awakening is the weakest FE game and you are better off playing the old ones.<br><br>If you want to play a good 3ds FE game, wait for Fates.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening has the most replay value and is the most fun fe game in my opinion. <br><br> tfw awakening changed the FE franchise forever <br><br>feels good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss the GBA FE's ridiculous animations. Sure they don't have a follow through so it's the same thing over and over, but all the spinning and Merc's smug as fuck lean were the best.</br>  <br><br>I miss it too. Does anyone have a gif or webm of the GBA Hero crit animation? I loved it so much.<br><br>I'm glad FE14's animations are way better than Awakening's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9xq<wbr>b5cVBBK8</wbr>  [ ]<br>They're getting there</br></br>  <br>Fates is bring back a lot of the crazy spinning, plus combined with ability activations, face cut away + one liner, and double pair ups make the combat way more exciting than any of the 3D games so far.</br>    <br>No ranking, RNG focused later difficulties (early lunatic plus is rerolling to avoid certain skills on enemies) and no actually different paths, simplistic main map design not allowing different strategies.<br><br>Not that great.<br><br>The best content gameplay wise is locked behind dlc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Awakening has the most replay value and is the most fun fe game in my opinion. <br>You can beat the game with only MU and Chrom and the maps are flat, open fields and there is no basically no reason to ever think, I can't play through it anymore considering how fucking boring it is.</br></br>  <br><br>I have to educate myself, does the pastebin in /feg/ help?<br><br>Not here where I live unfortunately.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've never been able to get into the tellius games because of how ridiculously bland the battle animation was, personally.

Nice b8 desu.<br><br><br>That's what the franchise has repeatedly told us in the TV series and movies, so yes in the Garo universe they are.</br></br></br></br>  Kaarage arc -  Commence   <br>Souma would be the funniest since it would effectively write out the entire cast.<br><br>It would never happen for that very reason and since he's the MC, but honestly, he's the likeliest to bite off more than he can chew.</br></br></br>  <br>for plot reasons? houjou because her character development seems to have peaked and she's now just being used for cameos/reference.<br><br>for personal reasons? marui because he's bringing down best boy smoke into "comic relief" tier.</br></br></br>  <br>- Meat<br>- Don<br>- Isami<br>- Yukki,ryoko</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes Meat should be expelled : she's a slut, and she can't even cook decently.</br>  <br>Marui has been hanging on by a thread for a while now.
