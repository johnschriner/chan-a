I only watch season 1 of A/Z so I kinda forgot who this bitch is. Was she the vice-captain of MC's ship?  <br> old waifu </br>  Close enough  <br>Anon, do you want to know why you can't get a date?</br>  <br> old waifu </br>   November 2 <br>http://schara.sunrockgo.com/day/nov<wbr>ember/11_2.html<br><br>Shit, pretty much nobody unless you like Sister Princess.<br>I really like my birthday, though.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because I browse /a/?</br>  + Some secondary characters from Wan Piss and that faggot from Danganronpa.

Summer is pretty damn terrible because of how hot and sweaty it is over here.</br></br></br>  I've known about this one for a while.<br>That site did make me aware that our birthday is shared with Soo-won of Akatsuki no Yona fame, though.

Fucking Kirito.  Blonde bitch from Idolmaster.<br><br>Blondes are my fetish so this is okay I guess.</br></br>   9/29 <br>This show was so hot. Usui makes me want to be a little girl.</br>  The only characters that share my birthday are from fujoshit and shounenshit.  I got the black hole-power dude from Hero Macadamia.<br>http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com<wbr>/wiki/No._13<br><br>Also Greece from Hetalia.</br></br></wbr></br>  There's quite a few on my birthday, maybe because it's Pocky Day. <br><br>Anyway this is my pick</br></br>  http://schara.sunrockgo.com/day/nov<wbr>ember/11_26.html<br><br>Honestly have no clue who most of these are.

I'm fine with this.   I bet there's like one, or zero. <br><br>Well fuck me, the list is huge.<br>http://schara.sunrockgo.com/day/dec<wbr>ember/12_26.html</wbr></br></br></br>  Pretty cool didn't expect buggy   I'm the only one looking for some anon who shares my birthday?   <br>At least we got Toriko brother.</br>   hidden data collection thread   Hi  <br>Is that you Kay?</br>  <br>I also have that brithday.<br>cheer up we also have best gyaru idol.</br></br>  <br>Dec 4th comrade!</br>   Tfw   <br> old waifu </br>  <br><br>21st of June<br>I like explosions and canned coffee too</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  good job anon  Ayy.  <br>I don't know how you guys can even watch Funimation's, the video quality is truly hideous and the 3D scenes were for the most part "lagging".</br>    <br>and aside from the fanservice, what does this anime have to offer?</br>  <br>Did you see what they just did? For Akagami episode 3 they fucked up the ENTIRE episode by having the audio not be from the episode itself, but from the next episode which hasn't even aired yet. HOW can you fuck up that bad</br>  <br> Overlord <br> fanservice <br>Your definition of fanservice must be different from mine, because the first two episodes don't have any fanservice at all</br></br></br>  <br>KILL<br>I<br>L<br>L</br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT, SERIOUSLY?<br>Did they just go beyond the impossible in fucking up shit? <br>How does that even happen? What the fucking hell?</br></br></br>  This is why we need to be able to delete our own threads still. <br><br>I make this mistake like once every 2 weeks. <br><br><br><br>I have little patience</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128348887 <br><br>I see your scrip failed you bateman.</br></br>  I applaud this series for its uniqueness in the first two episodes. The main characters appearance is a definite change of pace. Like a skeletor anime. But it'll have to bring something to the table soon. Starting to really slog at the end of the second episode there.  <br>There have been employees from Funi here before. They treat anime with disdain and the working environment is horrible</br>  So is this going to be an overlord thread or just waiting for the pruning?  <br>Gotta love Funi's fuck-ups.</br>  <br>Poop, possibly a few cool fights as the floor masters face off against whatever human enemies they end up facing later, I'm assuming, and assuming momonga doesn't just walk all over them.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, time to download the RAWs then.</br>  <br>literally every single screenshot I've seen of this show on 4chan has a sexual innuendo.</br>  <br>That's from Mikagura. <br>The Shirayuki hime fuck up was release episode 3 with episode 4's audio</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Sexual innuendos=/=fanservice<br>Also, there aren't that many innuendos.<br>What you see from some cherry picked screenshots proves nothing</br></br></br>  <br>And HorribleSubs encoded it without making sure everything was fine?</br>  <br> And HorribleSubs encoded it <br> smug anime face.jpg </br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs encoded it </br>  <br><br>I meant stole. I'm not that dumb.</br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs rips it manually </br>  <br>How would I know they're using a bot.. I mean yeah, it makes sense. Pls no bully.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, at least lurk before posting.<br>Fucking newfag, I swear.</br></br>  <br> How would I know they're using a bot <br>Because they have literally said multiple times that they use a bot to rip stream sites, newfag-kun.</br></br>  <br>I dunno Papa Bones is sexy as fuck.</br>  AINZ - SAMAAAA!!!<br>KISSU!<br>KISSU!!</br></br>  <br>Moe~</br>  So what are you fellas doing while waiting for your weekly dose? Currently going through 37 year old, ex-businessman slime tensei.  Is there any other manga or anime where the MC is an ruler or an overlord?  Tomorrow's the day  <br>I'd give Shalltear my Spuit Lance if you get what I mean.</br>  <br>Next episode the slaughter begins, and it keeps going up from there and end on a pretty high note.<br><br>If by some crazy stroke of luck we get a second season it will escalate even further.</br></br></br>  <br>Lizard sex animated on TV! Crusch x Zaryusu OTP!</br>  <br>I wonder if its any different from anahole when i put my dick in there</br>  <br>Pretty sure it's only adapting up to volume 3.</br>  <br>Oh never mind, didn't notice the second season part in the post you was replying to.</br>  <br>I really do want to see the lizard sex animated though.<br><br>For research purposes of course.</br></br></br>  <br>  We will never get to Volume 9 and see Ainz in his World Domination mode glory.  <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>sure we will. Five years from now.</br>   nothing to talk about till tomorrow   <br>Don't worry, if we keep studying Japanese I'm sure we can sort of read it in a few years.</br>  <br><br/></br>  If the anime means that we get more so-bin art, I'm all for it.  <br>Oh thats a new one. I like it.</br>  <br>How can anyone fuck up this much?</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl is passing by</br></br>  <br><br>I can't properly describe what my dick is feeling at this pic.</br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope some retard got fired, right? I also hope I'll live to see the day funi goes under.</br></br>  <br>Eh, Overlord air on Hulu later in the day. So whatever I catch first.</br>  <br>It's finally time.</br>  Over Lord? More like Over Bored.  <br>no quite. We won't get that far tomorrow.</br>  <br>No patience animeonlyfag gtfo</br>  <br>*not <br><br><br>*airs <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hulu is better than Funi? How is this even possible? Funi is the direct source.</br>  <br>At least death knight will have some fun.</br>  <br>I'unno. If it is or not I never noticed it. <br><br><br>Yup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should get him summoning the DK and blowing up people's hearts though.</br>  <br>Ainz always blowing up peoples heart.</br>  Threadly Reminder  <br> retard lovers <br>not even once</br></br>  <br>Who is last born and toilet? <br><br>Also what race is Yuri? Is she a dragon like Sebas since she's the only one who doesn't hate humans?</br></br></br>  <br>You could check the wiki.</br>  <br>Nobody really knows who they are yet. <br><br>Yuri is a Dulahan.</br></br></br>  <br>Lastborn is the immortal human lieutenant of the meidos who ranks above Yuri but below Sebastian. She hasn't been shown in the LNs yet.<br><br>Toilé(t) is  the whore Sebastian saves from Eight Fingers and the sister of Ninya <br><br>Yuri is a Dullahan.<br><br><br> retard meme <br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> narberal being retarded is a meme <br>Narberalfags are as braindamaged as their waifu.</br></br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>Reminder that Entoma literally means "bugs".</br>  <br>Narberal is cute precisely because she's so bullyable.<br><br>Her best moments are when she screws up and Ainz has to correct it.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br>I figured that's who toilet was, but just wanted to be sure.<br><br><br>What would one level in Dullahan even give you?<br><br>Also I though she was the head of the maids excluding Lastborn, but why is she like 12 levels lower than Narberal? That just seems weird to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't say<br><br><br>She's the one most fit to lead them when Sebas isn't around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the head of the Pleiades.</br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>Not being harmed by decapitation.</br></br></br>  <br>Solution is second best though</br>  <br>The main character aka protagonist is a fucking SKELETON! A spooky skeleton with a fucking armor! Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh?</br>  <br> Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh? </br>  <br>damn, I haven't seen this pic in a long ass tme lol</br>    <br> Fake tits </br>  <br>Mononga sama is great.</br>  <br>When does it even air? Threads have up since Saturday.</br>  <br>Tuesdays, with LN chapter translations on Saturdays.</br>  Prepare yourself for terrible CG.  <br>Best girl is not even a girl</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's doppelgänger.</br></br>  <br>Can't be worse than anything we've seen so far. Looked a bit awkward but okay in the preview.</br>  <br> implying </br>  Longest 7 days ever.  I don't understand why there's an argument over who the best made is. Yuri was made by Papa Bones, who's simply the best. His direct children should always rank above his adopted ones.  <br> Yuri was made by Papa Bones <br>We don't actually know that yet. It's not been said in the Tld chapters so far.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a broken translation, Naberal is a shapeshifter while PA is a doppelganger. PA looks like how doppels normally look like, naberals "natural" form is half man half woman mostly monsterous looking.</br>  <br> Implying there are people who don't rate PA the best guardian. <br><br>Like a lot of families with adopted kids, Ainz tends to treat his surrogate kids way better than his direct kid.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both doppelgangers, not a broken translation m8.<br>Plus in the web novel Narberal actually shows her true form which is exactly like Pandora's actor, a face with holes for the eyes and the mouth.</br></br>  drop after 15th minute ep.1... is worth or what?  <br>No.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck is going on here?</br>  <br>Mare gettin shit done</br>  <br>Just because he treats PA like crap, doesn't mean PA still isn't the best. Same goes for Yuri. I thought her being his creation was one of the earliest spoilers we got in these threads.</br>   My order of volume 3 and 4 will arrive today <br><br>Yiss</br></br>  <br>Again, that's never been proven.</br>  <br>While it's heavily implied that all guild members had a hand in making the maids, we still don't know who made what.</br>  Just why is PA rated so highly anyway? Is it because unlike the other guardians, he verifies Momonga's orders before he does them?  <br>Is that the translated one? I thought someone said it was translated in their country to something but I can't remember what.</br>  <br>More like it's because he's a goofball nazi.</br>  <br>PA's ability to mimic up to 45 other builds at 80% power gives makes him a very tough opponent apparently.</br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>Mare was practicing after receiving Demiurge's private lesson.<br><br> “In addition, regarding the plan to strengthen Nazarick, I am also very interested. I want to know how far our kids can go. How about it Mare, you want to have children?” <br><br> “Uh? Huh?” <br><br> “However, that is impossible without a partner… If you find any humans, dark elves or wood elves, could you please capture them?” <br><br> “Eh? Ehhh?” Mare briefly nodded: “I-, if this helps Momonga-sama…. Then I will do it. But how are children born?” <br><br> “Well, when it comes to that time I will teach you. If you decide to experiment on your own, Momonga-sama will probably scold you. Due to maintaining the Great Tomb of Nazarick’s operating cost, it should be better if we try to maintain the balance first.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently <br><br>You really think that level of versatility doesn't make him high tier?</br></br></br>  <br> Elf rapist <br> No elf being raped <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br>There were guys in the guild that were broken, like Touch me. 80% of fucking invincible is still a lot.</br>  how long has momonga been in charge anyways? that blob guy from the first episode said he last saw him like 2-ish years ago right? and it sounded like he was surprised momonga was in charge now and that's why the guild is still around.  <br>This dialogue will be animated?</br>  <br>It's not like he can take on more than one form at a time and wouldn't there be a lag between forms. Also that 20% from top form is pretty significant. I don't know if just having a counter build is enough to bridge that.</br>  <br>It was skipped.</br>  <br>No, it got skipped. It was during episode 2.</br>  <br>For a very long time. He wasn't surprised that Momonga was in charge NOW, but that he was STILL around and covering the Guild's maintenance fees because almost everyone else had already quit.</br>  What's the current pace of the anime (1 LN = X episodes)?<br><br>Are the LNs worth reading?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much 4 episodes per volume. And yes.</br>  <br>It's only an issue if he was facing someone who had the stats that could match one of those forms at 100%. 80% of a God's stats could still wreck 100% of an ant's stats.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;No elf being raped <br> implying <br>Demiurge want Mare to capture elves too (). I wouldn't be surprised if that guy has already prepared a rape dungeon filled with Orc.</br></br></br>  <br>Patience is great, but just like SAO and Log Horizon it's clear that this show will wear out its welcome after a season, and there's no chance it'll get more than two seasons. So, there's a limited time in which events can happen.</br>  <br>What  said but be advised that the translation quality of like half of the first volume is pretty poor. It gets better though.</br>  DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION  <br>I thought you meant against other equals, then the advantages are situational. <br>Just about anyone in that world is pretty puny.</br></br>  <br> But how are children born? </br>  <br> <br>The woman is a noble who lead a criminal group<br>Said group pissed MC off by kidnapping Sebas' waifu<br>He sent Mare and Entoma out<br>They go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Good alignment my ass, that kid's fucking creepy I swear, just look at his face.</br></br></br>  <br>Even against most other level 100s Pandora's Actor would still have an overwhelming advantage from having copied Touch Me (World Champion) and Ulbert (World Magic Champion).</br>  <br>Mare is actually kidnapping a girl to fuck her then? Interesting frown there.</br>  <br>It's neutral good, not good.</br>  It's ok to be Mare sexual right?  <br>Otoko.</br>  <br>Good does not mean nice</br>  <br><br>I'm sure his versatility and ability to transform into two world champions is extremely powerful, but he lacks in the knowledge and items for proper use for those builds. Also, Albedo only considers him to be on the same level as herself and Demiurge. Of course it's possible she just never considered him turning into world champions, but her assessment is probably accurate.</br></br>  <br>He's Neutral Evil. Neutral Good is Shizu and good is Yuri or Sebas.</br>  <br>Mare's actually evil though.</br>  <br>Why would punishing some uppity animals affect his alignment?</br>  <br>Why Mare and Entoma? Knowing Ainz, he must have thought really hard about it before he chose them.</br>  <br>Well it's not like he can send most of his guardians<br><br>Cocytus is a giant lizard monster<br>Albedo would probably murder everyone in a fit of yandere rage<br>Shalltear obviously cant be trusted to take hostages<br>Victim is pretty easy to kill<br>Gargantua is a xbox hueg golem<br>Demiurge and Sebastian were busy with their own stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cocytus <br> lizard monster </br></br>  <br>Why not send meidos?</br>  <br>*bug-lizard monster</br>  <br>He's an Ant Mantis.</br>   Sharknado is a real spell and we will see it animated <br><br>Thank you based Momonga</br></br>  <br> Meidos were sent to help Demiurge. </br>  <br>Characters act according to their alignment. Their behavior doesn't change it.</br>  <br>Looks more like some amalgamation of large beetles, like stag/hercules beetles.<br><br>Immediately thought of this guy when I first saw him</br></br></br>  <br>Is this what pokemon has become</br>  <br>I fucking wish</br>  <br>So he's a mANTis?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>Entoma IS a meido...</br>  <br>How much was it? Shipping cost? <br><br> So Bin artbook when? </br></br></br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>The ability to give good head.</br></br></br>  <br>Clackity clack clack.</br>    <br>If I recall, he sent almost everyone that could be disguised as a human.  The whole event only got out of hand once Blue Rose intercepted Entoma. Both were after the Eight Fingers, but the goody two-shoes Blue Rose adventurers wouldn't let Entoma go once they met her, because she was eating people in front of them, even if those people were guards of Eight Fingers. Entoma even asked if they would ignore her, but the muscle thing/woman wouldn't let her go. </br>  I've been reading the LN, and mostly it's "We don't know fuck all, so we need to investigate." When they finally do, they discover the MC and his minions are hilariously overpowered compared to everybody else.<br><br>It gets interesting when  one of his own minions gets mind controlled , though, because he actually has to form a plan. Judging from the OP of the show, that battle will probably be the finale.</br></br>  <br>I'm still pissed that their leader  managed to resurrect the two that Demiurge killed. What good id resurrection magic if everyone and their grandmother can use it? </br>  <br>Feel  kinda bad  Gagaran  is probably going to be brutally wasted.  <br>I hate her character design, but I admit it fits with her personally rather than the "beautiful butch musclegirl with the 10/10 face" and she's bro-tier as hell going by the last chapter.<br><br> But god I hate Climb. Even though I want to like him. But I hate him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have we ever seen Ainz hold any writing instruments? My mind is boggling on how the hell he holds a pencil or brush with those slenderman skeleton fingers.</br>  <br>Who doesn't hate Climb? Fucking Climb, man.</br>  <br>with those points all Ainz needs is an Inkwell</br>  <br>Well, I don't really care for him but I don't particularly hate him either. I'm just waiting for the day he discovers what his precious princess thinks of him and humans in general.He'll wish he were dead.</br>  <br> lolis never EVER get any kind of sex in any anime, ever <br> any time a shota is introduced, he ALWAYS fucks someone <br>Fucking double standards holy shit, so frustrating.</br></br></br>  <br>I only see a chair</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>It's only everyone we meet because they have the resources to do so.<br>It's costly as hell to resurrect people, since the New World plays by D&amp;D rules. And that sort of magic is costly as hell for anybody not a wandering murderhobo-cum-adventurer-thief. Like, literal lifetimes of commoner money, if not the effort to find people who can actually do it.<br><br>As well,  it only works on "strong" people anyways, since you seem to lose levels on respawn with that sort of magic. Anyone too low in "level" can't be brought back, as Khajit implied about his mother. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You see anon<br><br> something something boys always want sex says men who have messed up views of sex </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, that's hilarious. And a good point. I've always wanted to just be able to finger write without having to literally write it out with a stick that made it not look smudgy and shitty.</br>  <br> Plus the person has to want to come back, though I wonder who'd not want to come back if they could. How many levels did the Blue Rose people lose? </br>   Ainz says dark elf twins are too young to know about sex <br> when they're 70+ years old <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I WANT to like him. He just tries so hard, the poor bastard. He is the stuff that real heroes are made of, what with his obviously pure as grace heart.<br><br>But he just eats up so much story with his goddamn sob story and STOIC LOYALTY. At least Gazef was fighting an uphill battle physically and politically with a modicum of personality.<br><br> though I am preaching to the (dark) choir of Nazarick, I assume </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To him, they're less than ten years old, since they were "born" when Bukubuku Chagama(?) created them.<br><br>As well, that's how they were created. 70-year old virgins. Because of roughly-made NPC blurbs that did nothing for Yggdrasil's gameplay other than making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds).</br></br></br>  <br>Ganbatte, toilet-san</br>  <br>If Khajit somehow got his wish, I would assume the irony would be that his mother would reject him trying to call her back to the earthly world. <br><br> I mean, he'd kill thousands, if not millions, to get enough negative/death energy to become a lich, THEN kill more to research his perfect resurrection spell for her. What mother wouldn't be appalled she was even tangentially related to that sort of slaughter? </br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. All we know is from dubious rumors by Chinafags and people who read moon off of the (admittedly quite different, especially for later volumes) web novel.<br>All we know is who gets rekd, details are lost (if they're even true at all). And once they get published in the re-written LNs as opposed to the WN volumes, who knows where the story will head?</br></br>  Can Ainz-sama bring back Ed's mom?  <br>Bait response aside, he could. She'd come back as a shambling mess of organs, bones, and necrotic goo screaming in mindless agony and rage, but yeah, he could. <br>I mean, it's not much different from what Ed/Al did.</br></br>  <br>Ed/Al might have had a bit bigger success if, you know, those weren't revealed to be a different woman's bones.</br>  <br> making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds). <br>You just have to know that probably a lot of guilds were Magical Realm as all get-out. If future /a/ played Yggdrasil and remade Touch the Fluffy Tail or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts and terrible and disgusting fetish blurbs on every R-15 (due to game age restrictions, not that a dedicated modder wouldn't get around that) sex puppet there.</br></br>  <br>Eh, disgusting flesh horror made from a summoning built off of true familial love gone wrong, gory lost limbs off some innocent-but-well-meaning kids, same difference to Ainz. <br>He'd just take a look at it, take notes, then let Demiurge play the remnants.</br></br>  <br><br>I used to lurk the tera generals, and I can confirm those fags were such sluts it was unbearable. But then again any /a/ guild would probably be the same if some game like Yggdrasil ever pops up.</br></br>  <br> or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts <br>Should have joined Pettan.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Ainz be able to effortlessly bring hdr back too life? Death is a minor hurdle at his level.</br>  <br><br>Well considering it requires the sacrifice of lvl experience, she'd probably be too low to be resurrected.</br></br>  <br>it's not his level that matters as the person that's brought back is the one that looses levels.</br>  <br>By name alone, I can tell that guild was probably sluts pretending they weren't sluts.</br>  <br>He probably could, even without level-loss. He has an assload of rare items, many of them not even Pay items that could probably do perfect resurrections without level loss. Magic too, even.<br>But why would he spend the effort (or more importantly, items) to do so?</br></br>  <br>They spent all their time hanging out in the arena. Nothing happened in their entire lives except getting killed by at least one raid group.</br>  <br>He might be interested In having alchemists who he can learn about a new form of magic from. I can't see Ed/Al being of use for anything else except Demiurge experiments. Of course he could just grant himself the ability to use it with his wish item.</br>  What time tomorrow's the livestreaming? I always get confused. 10:30 or 11?  <br>Ainz has enough resources and competent minions to do pretty much anything he sets his mind too, in the New World. <br><br>The issue is that he generally lacks motivation and is too cautious to ambitiously experiment. His primary concern is to protect Nazarick and his children. Most of the activities he undergoes are incited by the Guardians. He would rather just stay in the background, looking for his former guild mates and having adventures.</br></br></br>  I hope to God that the next part of the LN isn't more Climb.  Finally finished reading Vol4.<br>Fuck that was long.<br><br>Vol5 chpt3 translations when?</br></br></br>  <br>Saturday.</br>  <br>but chpt2 came out 2 Sats ago ;_;</br>  <br>The LN translation seems to be on weekly basis.<br><br>Crazy, right?</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck you talking about? Chp 2 came out 2 days ago.</br>  <br>What kind of time loop are you in?</br>  <br><br>well fuck me then, time for bed.</br></br>  Man looking at the illustrations for volume 7, I feel really, really sorry for the Workers. Poor saps took the worst job possible.  <br>Is that you undead flash? Please tell me about episode 4.</br>    <br>Surprise.  More Climb. You get to see Sebas teach him how to be a man (or die in the process.) </br>  <br>Oh god please no.<br><br>Somebody save me from this fresh hell.</br></br></br>  wait a minute. If she is dead, how can she still produce body fluids.<br><br>who programmed this shit.</br></br>  manga update when?<br>i need that hugging scene illustrated</br>  <br>Her creator designed her that way. It's why they all worship the 41 Supreme Beings.</br>  3/5    <br>What?</br>  <br>She does show off her natural fingers at some point in the published novels, I'll be fucked if I can remember where though.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear, papa Bones stuck all of his friends armor onto statues or threw them into storage.</br>  <br>It triggers my autism knowing there will always be a gap in his collection from the last 3 that left without deleting the characters and giving him their gear.</br>  So how much do the NPCs remember about the Players or Supreme Beings? Its clear they know they were created by them but do they remember the game as it was their reality or just the background they were given?  <br>right after fighting khajit/clementine saving alchy shota in the tomb. The Virtuous King of The Forest asks about it. I'm wondering if they are going to bring up the sentient item they gave to the King. Probably not for another 10 volumes.<br><br>Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. Papa has 11 world class items anyways so its not like he needs more crazy shit to fuck around with.<br><br>They understand their settings but the characters seem to take after their creators in the gaps. They act as if they were always sentient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They act as if they were always sentient. <br><br>That just makes me imagine all the terrible shit that could've happened if a pervert played this game<br><br>Imagine some pervert making his NPC follower into a scantily clad waifu and then forcing her to take on humiliating poses using the menu or giving her a cringeworthy backstory a la "She loves me and is a nympho who needs cock at least three times a day bla bla bla"<br><br>Then you accidentally go to the new world and your NPC waifu who was accustomed to doing the "bend over" pose and "sexy dancing" emote is real and remembers every single thing you've done together, even the times you ran into her character model repeatedly and pretended it was sex.<br><br>Man, I'm glad for Ainz but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly <br>Oh anon.</br></br>  So did anybody else hear him at the end of episode 2? It was the last thing I was expecting.  <br>If you think that's bad, just imagine what /tg/ and /d/ would get up to as part of an evil guild.</br>  reading time  <br>Woot! Reading! Literature!</br>  <br>Chinese or Korean?</br>  <br> actual literal cherry picking <br><br>Sasuga disinformators.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo, stop being so perfect please. I am trying to work, not to produce instant, infinite boners.</br>  <br> Dullahan <br> head maid <br> head <br><br>bonelaugh.gif</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget he gets to copy secret weapon Rubedo and he can do lame shit like go Ainz -&gt; Eclipse CD -&gt; transform into someone else and not be fucked over by Ainz's shitty build. Unless 80% of kill everything period means only kill it by 80% and leave 20% alive, which is still pretty damn good for just one attack.</br>  <br>Isn't he just 80% of the original's level when transformed? That would make him too low to use eclipse when mimicking Ainz</br>  <br>The one that turned into clothes?</br>  <br>It's 80% stats, not 80% of the level.</br>  <br>Is this Vol 7 or Vol 5? I'm gonna guess the 11k words is total and not per page.</br>  <br>You know what's funny. Khajit and Zuranon have to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve lichdom. Ainz just needs a book, that he probably hoards by the hundreds.</br>  <br>But that's just how it is. Players are different than New World denizens. Compare 13 heroes leader who was a player to Climb. It's not even remotely fair.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Ainz to show Zuranon just who is the true master of the undead.</br>  <br><br>What is this!?<br><br>He's just bones....</br></br></br></br>  <br>believe it or not but skeletons are usually just bones</br>  <br>So is the human body. Oh wait.</br>  <br>A book?<br><br>I thought all he needed was the character creation screen.</br></br></br>  Next episode in 7 hours. And then it will be another 7 days until we can see Papa Bones animated again.  <br>I still wonder where we're going to stop at this episode.</br>  Hey does anyone have the image of the world map? I swear there was one, but I don't remember which volume or chapter it was, or if it was only in the manga.  <br>I say virtuous king.<br>If it happens I'm buying a hamster.</br></br>  <br>Right before the confrontation or a quarter into it.</br>  <br><br>Introduction of Strogonoff, before the battle with the Angels start.</br></br>  <br>that's a stupid move though. the Eclipse CD augments Insta-death spells which are the main reason that Ainz RP build sucks(in the game there was lots of anti-instant death resistances and Rez at high levels), so PA is better of copying Touch me or that PVP wizard</br>   In that room, a white lizardman was being pressed down with its tail lifted up. A black lizardman was riding on top.<br><br><br>Baffling.<br><br><br>Ainz didn’t understand what was going on in the very beginning. The next instant, that changed to confusion as to why they are doing that thing at a time like this.<br><br><br>Ainz then moved the sensory organ outside silently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>T-Too lewd</br></br>  <br>angel battle won't last part A anon haven't you watched enough animus?</br>  <br>I just started the lizardmen chapter. I had no idea you could make lizardmen so boring.<br>At least Shalltear drowning herself in drink that shouldn't even effect her was hilarious.<br>I hope they put Eck in the anime. A penguin plotting to usurp Ainz is hilarious.</br></br></br>  Where I can read the LN? <br>I just found about this anime and it was great</br>  <br>It was from Volume 9, but we only have a shitty camera picture since there are no scans yet.</br>  <br>really?</br>  <br>It's a race change item, it's mentioned in Volume 4.<br> One of the conditions was a specific item. For example, you would need the ‘Book of the Dead’ to be a lich. To turn into an imp required ‘Fallen Seeds’. And the ‘Heaven’s Feather’ that Ainz mentioned was a required item to become an angel. </br></br>    <br> shadbase </br>  <br>Ah but that's the kicker, the Eclipse CD is the only worthwhile move in Ainz's build, and it's honestly not that shit just easily countered.<br><br>Besides, it's not like there's any known counter to rez items as far as we know. Ainz himself has a ring that gives him 3 self rezes in a row without losing exp. Being able to instantly take down 1 of them then transforming into Touch Me/Ulbert/Rubedo is very useful.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ainz started the game as a skeleton, he doesn't need any items to change.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>He was just a weak skelly in a tattered robe, he could've taken up a curved sword and maybe be one of those spooky pirates. He probably needed the book to be magical spook lord.</br>    <br>http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>05/O42.html<br>start from vol 2 at the very least</br></wbr></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br><br>Cool, thanks based anons<br><br> start from vol 2 at the very least <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You will understand as you read.</br>  <br>Spookman is still a alright mage, his insta-gib stuff does debuffs if it doesn't kill and he still has some bread-and-butter things to be good enough at just straight up killing things when he's not being busy playing support-bot.</br>  <br>Just ignore him, start from the very beginning prologue. The minor details that the anime and manga discarded are nice</br>  <br> You will understand as you read. <br>But did I will lose any detail/info if I didn't read vol1 or it was bad translated?<br><br><br>Ok, thanks again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess the book is needed to class up from a spooky skele mage to a lich. What else could he have become other than a lich?</br>  <br>It's probably in one of the D&amp;D 3.x books seeing as a good chunk of stuff in the novels is lifted from there.</br>  <br>A wheel skeleton, I guess.<br>At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider.</br></br>  <br>Death knight?</br>  <br> At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br> Papa Bones as a level 100 wheel skeleton <br><br>The mental image is simultaneously hilarious and horrific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only proper answer is to become a bone wyrm instead.</br></br>  <br>It's only worthwhile when compared to the enemies he faced in YGGDRASIL and other undead, but when up against pretty much any other opponent, Ainz is loaded with all kinds of incredible moves, such as all his summon abilities.</br>  A lich's soul is attached to his phylactery right? What item would that be for Papa Bone?  <br>To become a lich in 3.x you pretty much just have to create a phylactery; that requires a caster level of 11, Create Wondrous Item, 120,000 GP and 4800XP.</br>  What would the guardians do if Ainz announced that he would go adventuring alone?  <br>Reluctantly agree while praising the unknown plan Ainz has concocted that their feeble minds could never fathom. They would soon become stalkers of the highest order.</br>  <br>I do know that the orb in his chest is a world item so that can't be it.</br>  <br>Do liches even have independent phylacteries in this setting? We know that Ainz can be resurrected normally and the lich that was destroyed by the lizardmen would have automatically resurrected if it had a phylactery, but it simply died along with its body.</br>  <br>How does one turn himself into a bone wyrm?</br>  <br>They would put up a fight and pester him endlessly to try and send at least one maid to accompany him. If he still refused, they would have someone skilled enough follow him and keep tabs on him</br>  <br> stalkers of the highest order. <br>Pretty much this.</br></br>  <br><br>Dracolich it up.<br>Or just do what I did and  reform a collection of ground up bone dust from various species, preferably those with high magic affinity, into the inexplicable visage of a dragon's skeleton. During the bone creation process, you fuse pieces of your soul into the various parts of the skeleton and then assemble them together into the aforementioned dragon shape. <br><br>You have to then to find a way to keep the form together, there are numerous ways to do this but I prefer simply empowering the bones and possessing them en masse hence why I embedded my soul into them. Some have resorted to simply practicing bonemancy or utilizing a single gemstone acting as the heart to keep the whole thing together. If you did things right, you should be able to leave your mortal body and become a spooky skelly dragon.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>What's the source on that? I know he has a WC item cause the guild said it was okay but I didn't read anywhere that it was the orb.</br>  <br>So you used the bones as an unconventional phylactery instead? Neat.<br> also /tg/ pls </br></br>  <br>Stalking is highly possible. So is suicide.<br> “Ai- Ainz-sama, please agree to me, promise to me that you will never abandon us and leave this place!”  <br> “......I apologise, however……” <br> After ‘however’ , Ainz did not continue speaking. He had a particular reason for it, but Albedo assumed that his silence was due to something else. <br> “Why! Why can you not make that promise? Did you have thoughts about abandoning us already? Why! Is there something which makes you unhappy? If you would just explain, I will immediately remedy it! If you think of me as a hindrance, I shall immediately take my own life!” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less he's an umber hulk</br>  <br>Isn't that what the skeletal dragons from Volume 2 are, barring the intelligence?</br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to do this but I'll just have to put it on my bucketlist. Gotta fucking find a way to to become a little girl mimic first.</br></br>  <br>but that's my point, the Eclipse CD is useless on a standard build that doesn't focus on instant death, so there's no point for PA to copy it unless he's going to fight as Ainz</br>  <br>Then what?</br>  Will we ever see Sebas' other eye in the anime?  <br>Undead turning lich don't have phylacteries. That's for mortals going lich.</br>  <br><br>You're a god damn skeleton dragon. What else do you want to do? Jerk off?</br></br>  <br>Receive a tier-7 lightning spell to the face and crumble.</br>  <br> Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. <br><br>Nah, they were the ones that hadn't left the game, but hadn't logged in the past 1-2 years. <br><br>All of them reconnect the last day to say farewell to the game and to the Guild. Ainz comments that in the first chapter. <br><br>So, since they logged out that very same day, I doubt they were anywhere in the game world or in the new world. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Also, he knows everything about the gear that is stored in his vault. It's not like he wouldn't be able to use the builds and equipment with a high degree of skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thri-kreen would have been the ideal DnD base for Cocytus.</br>  <br>I don't know. Get stronger?</br>  So is this entire show just about characters wanting to suck MC's dick?  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>Go fuck off and assimilate better bones or ores into your frame, refine the enchantments and bindings, and go find a dragon rider crazy enough to join you on your journey.</br></br>  <br>no mosty its start with hugging and getting stressed by his minions who keeps ovwethinkinf his orders</br>  Please tell me there's gonna be more lewd Albedo.   discuss pic related   <br>A guy like him wasnt going to last in the Marines for long.<br>But I bet he´s gonna keep his rank for raisins.</br></br>  <br><br>They cant fire him just like that. He will get some sanctions but they wont kick him out</br></br>  <br>Is there a chapter this week, or is everything on break?</br>  <br>His ultimatum is either get fired and take his entire marine regimen to become pirates/revolutionaries OR become Smoker 2.0. Either works for me</br>  <br>One Piece has no chapter this week. Not sure about the rest of JUMP.</br>  Dumping chapter 186.<br>Reminder that Usopp has a<br> meteor hammer <br>The only other character with a "meteor" named attack appear in this order<br>1.

What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou. <br><br>Good point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if Blackbeard grabbed Luffy while he was in gear 3? Would losing his rubberness with all the air in him cause his limb to explode? Would he be able to hold it together with haki?  <br>Luffy used haki unconsciously to win the final exchange, since he punched through Crocodiles cutting attack which sliced solid rock the previous time it was shown.<br>Same shit happened vs Arlong.<br><br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do you actually believe this?</br>  <br>Because Crocodile second in command Mrs Allsunday was a traitor</br>    <br>Power creep. <br>Don't think too much of it, it happens to every shounen over time.</br></br>    <br>Forgotpic</br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>20/working-with-eiichiro-oda-an-int<wbr>erview-with-one-piece-editor-suguru<wbr>-sugita/<br><br> Well, now that we’re in the second half of the story, I think there will be more and more chapters that revolve around the main plot. The Four Emperors will also appear more in the story, so I think you’ll really enjoy what happens next! </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I'm pretty hype if Fujitora tries to follow his commands. Having both a Warlord and Admiral defeated would be some real shit assuming Luffy and Law can fight the following morning.  <br>Two knocked out novas versus a full health admiral. Yep, def gonna happen.</br>  <br>Fuji is just New World Aokiji<br><br>he'll follow them around lazily but otherwise isnt doing shit</br></br></br>  <br>its stated by territory, right after the war when the gorosei are talking i think. BB was in WBs crew for a long time and knew where all thin freshly unclaimed land would be and had crew that could solo cap an island each so it just happened to go to him</br>  <br>I am saddened when I see these threads and I have no recollection of reading some of these pages ;_;<br><br>Perhaps it's my due time for a re-read</br></br></br>  <br> 30% of the story left <br><br>w-what?? theres still so many unresovled things, I don't want it to end too soon :(</br></br></br>  <br>You can't remember a page from two weeks ago.</br>  <br>that page was literally 2 weeks ago chapter, are you sure you arent a speed reader with alzheimers?</br>  <br>30% ends at chapter 1100 or so.<br><br>It's as far from now as the start of the series from Luffy fighting Lucci.</br></br></br>  <br> the following morning. <br>I think this information alone allows us to deduce Fuji is letting them go.<br>If he wanted them he'd have the marines pick them off the ground as soon as the doffy fight was done.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda or one of his editors said OP was half way done back during the end of Skypeia. I'd take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>I'm just glad the Yonko are going to play a more active role now.</br></br></br>  <br>He is NOT going to come after Luffy/Law. He's saying he's fine with not coming back to Marine HQ.<br><br><br>Because Oda can't break muh monster trio, he's too strong and there are too many crewmembers wah wah wah.<br><br>Same shit you see in these threads all the time. They don't read the series, though so they couldn't know half the shit they spew.<br><br><br>Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one.<br><br><br>Neat. But to be around 70% of the story? Hmm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come people are acting like Vivi isn't already part of the crew. <br>Jinbe could have joined and then went on a solo mission, instead he said "he, ill join later." which is a deathflag or at minimum "some shit will block him from joining" flag.</br></br>  <br>he's going to have some Big Mom conflict but he'll still join. <br><br>He and Luffy are blood-brothers afterall</br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br>Another proof he won't join/will die</br></br>  <br>How much do you think there's left of Berserk?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shieet I somehow missed last week's WSJ release. Well another example is Kuzan/Aokiji's appearance post-timeskip</br></br></br>  <br> Nearly $25million a year <br><br>Holy crap</br></br></br>  <br>Caribou will tell<br> that man <br>That Shirahoshi is Poseidon.<br>That's where Jinbe, strongest fish man in the world (deathflag), will get blocked from ever joining.</br></br></br></br>  Would I be right in saying his reintroduction was ambiguous?<br><br>Capone working for Mam is a boring to me since we already have the yonkou underling dynamic with Drake/Kaidou.<br>I'd much prefer Capone to be striking out alone.<br><br>Why would he be after Ceasar though?<br>Ceasar probably has wares that can be traded on the black market.<br>I think it would be interesting to see Capone make a play for becoming the top Broker...might also suit his namesake since it's a black market vibe.<br>Does this sound like headcannon or a reasonable theory? I can never tell when it's my own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea, miura does what he wants. I just hope the announcement about monthly releases holds up, and we actually do get monthly chapters.</br>  <br>He was on Big Mom's fucking ship.</br>  <br>Sabo seems to be doing just fine though</br>  <br>law said to survive in the new world you either take out a yonko or join a yonko, and no supernova can take them out alone, so I think its fine if he's working for big mom, just makes him a less important character compared to say captain kid. drake is ambiguous, he might join luffy/law</br>  <br>Sabo has more deathflags than any other character in One Piece.<br><br>He even did and said the exact same things Ace did before he died almost word for word, and Zoro explicitly commented on this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Caribou tells Kizaru?<br>Think about it, Kizaru killed the sun pirates. Kizaru is Proven 100% loyal to tenryubito, and the tenryubito are actively trying to acquire the ancient weapons as Proven at water 7<br>Jinbe vs Kizaru means no Jinbe cremate</br></br></br>  <br> He was on <br>near, He was NEAR Big Mom's ship</br></br>  <br><br>Which translation is this.<br>Seems decent.</br></br></br>  <br>that's assuming they actually parallel 100%<br><br>I doubt they do. It'd make no sense to replace Ace only to kill him off as well</br></br></br>  <br>He was on big mom's ship. You can see the fucking candy canes.</br>  <br>I guess you forgot CP0 was on Dressrosa at the same time as Sabo and the obvious possibility that Koala is an agent.<br>No one guessed Blueno the bartender was a spy either.</br></br>  <br> stripes are candycane <br><br>anon...</br></br></br>  <br>You're in fucking denial of something that was explicitly shown so it fits your fanfiction better, and you're trying to be the bigger person here?</br>  <br>that's some wild speculating you're doing there</br>  <br> obvious possibility that Koala is an agent. <br><br>With such amazing evidence as....</br></br></br>  <br>prove its candy cane then and not just stripes?</br>  <br>It is speculation that Koala is a spy.<br>It is a fact that every reader was surprised when CP9 was unmasked, and will be when CP0 is too.<br>Sorry if that offends you</br></br></br>  <br>these two things arent linked because you type them together, m8<br><br>no idea what you're getting worked up over.

Why must CP0 be the same as CP9? because CP1-8 also did that, right?</br></br>  <br>tobi was obito</br>  <br>I said nothing like that and you know it<br><br>you're running purely on speculation and getting pissed when people point out how stupid you're being</br></br></br>    <br>The hilarious part about that is that this twist was SO obvious the entire reason people started doubting it was because it was just too fucking obvious so it couldn't be true.</br>  <br>Anybody close to the second in command of the revolutionary army.<br>Not anybody we've seen. All the CP9 agents were close friends with their assassination target.<br><br>you are falsely telling me what I am arguing. I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members of the same organization as Iceberg, not "anyone we've seen."</br></br></br></br>  <br>By your logic, even Fuji might be a CP0 member. muh surprise. Or even the king of the dwarves!<br><br>In simples manner, it's not really possible for Koala because she's too short (and don't try that whole midgets in overcoat shit.</br></br></br>  <br> . I am not affirming koala as a spy, just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did in that they were members <br><br>To put it another way "I'm not saying Koala is a spy, but she totally is". I'm not sure if you legitimately think you're saying something different, but that's what you're fucking typing dude.</br></br></br>  <br> just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did <br><br>you can replace Koala with literally any other name and nothing would change</br></br></br>  <br> an infiltrator in Dragons army wouldn't need a good back story. <br><br> koalatellingsaboitsgoodhedidntsave<wbr>ace.Png </wbr> <br>Anyway my argument is that Sabo has death flags, good derail by focusing on koala who I mentioned as hypothetical example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who I mentioned as hypothetical example. <br><br>that's your own fault though. Your theory holds no water either way</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu Gomu no Autism!</br>  <br>No my logic explicitly excludes them because they are not close with Sabo in any way, having met him less than 24 hours ago in canon, whereas my logic requires they were close to Sabo for years and years like how kaku and friends stayed with iceberg for like a decade.</br>  <br>My god<br><br>Luffy is a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br>Its completely feasible as it mirrors CP9 being long time friends and subordinates of their assassination target.<br>You are arguing that it is unfeasible even though it was the water 7 saga</br></br>  <br>Except we know he is not.<br>You are either just being antagonistic or very dumb.<br>Luffy hasn't talked to Sabo before today in story since he was like 6 years old, so it violates the logic, as well.</br></br></br>  watch this retard be right, and koala turns out to be a cp0 agent.<br><br>post YFW</br></br>  <br> Except we know he is not. <br><br>That's why it's proof, because it was surprising when the CP9 agents were revealed, and it would be surprising if Luffy was revealed as a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br> mirrors <br>prove that it's a mirror or even happening right now?<br><br>you have no clue IF CP0 is after Sabo in particular or someone we havent even seen yet<br><br>you're just assumin because they're in the general area that they must be linked when Dressrosa introduced something like 30 characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why Sabo? The CP0 were said to have been mobilized to take out Doffy. Shouldn't they be close to him then?<br>Plus, why do you think Oda will follow the same approach to CP0 as he did with CP9. Such blatant repetition just isn't his style. There's a better chance CP0 will be handled nothing like the 9 so all conjectures based on it are potentially a waste.</br></br>  <br> That's why it's proof, because it was surprising </br>  <br><br>She won't be she's the girl fisher tiger rescued. She'd never work for the CDs</br></br>  <br> being the is much of a troll <br>I just feel bad for you at this point.<br>The only CP9 agent who wasn't working for iceberg and also his good friend of many years was Spandam.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not proof, it is well reasoned speculation based on the known modes operandi of another in canon branch of the WG.<br>It could easily be wrong, but it is not "wild speculation," which was the initial criticism.</br></br>  <br>And Jyabura. And Fukuro. And Kumadori.<br><br>Does Nero count too, even though nobody remembers him?</br></br></br>  <br> CP0 is Koala and Hack <br> CP0 is all of Dragon's subordinates <br> Dragon is the CP0 boss <br> they're all conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary </br></br></br></br>  <br> Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one. <br><br>Marfineford and Dressrosa were both just giant arcs about a bunch of new characters fighting each other with minimal character development for the Straw Hats. It makes sense they'd like Dressrosa.</br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UK<wbr>8-wh-oLp4</wbr>  [ ] <br> tfw Roci's voice is manlier than Doffy's </br>  <br>So some agents weren't, this doesn't affect the veracity of my speculation though because the means of assassination primarily relied on the members who were friends with Iceberg.<br><br>It is a reasonable speculation I'm not sure why you are so aggressively attacking it with fallacy.</br></br></br>  <br> well reasoned <br><br>You seriously call something with no evidence whatsoever 'well-reasoned'.<br><br>Literally the only support for your argument is that it would resemble what happened in Water7. For fuck's sake, you don't even have any evidence that there's more than the three agents we already saw in CP0, that they've infiltrated the revolutionaries (who nobody knew was on the island), that Koala is one of them, why Koala would have stayed behind if she was one of them when they were explicitly stated in the last chapter to have completely left the island, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it is well reasoned speculation <br> Koala might be CP0 <br> because she works with Sabo <br> who the CP0 were obviously around to apprehend <br> because of COURSE Sabo is being doublecrossed <br> because he's deathflagged <br> because he's Luffy's brother </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I state that ALL of galley la were infiltrators?</br>  <br>Because it's not reasonable, it's insane. You have no proof, nothing other than 'parallels', without even any evidence to suggest that the series is following parallels, that the parallels apply in this instance, why they specifically apply to Koala instead of, say, Hack, or anything at all. There's absolutely nothing supporting a single thing you're saying, and the fact that you don't seem to grasp this. The fact that you repeatedly and consistently are getting details of the story wrong is also not helping.</br>  <br>There is substantial evidence that Oda heavily mirrored Alabasta in Dressrosa, though. And he set up a spy agency involvement for the next saga and also revealed Sabo as the #2 rev, had Sabo say the same shit as ace when he left Alabasta as well</br>  <br>my bad<br><br> CP0 is MOST of Dragon's subordinates(not all because then it wouldn't be a perfect mirror!) <br><br> they're MOSTLY conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary(not all of them. Bunny Joe is cool) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora for next Strawhat</br>  <br> a correlation exists <br> therefore, a trend exists and will continue <br><br>You realize Ace was killed by Blackbeard and the Marine, right? And that CP9 had nothing to do with this? So by the 'muh parallels' logic CP0 should also have nothing to do with Sabo?</br></br></br></br>    <br>You keep putting words in my mouth.<br>I did not clack Dressrosa was a perfect mirror of Alabasta.<br>I did not claim that most of the revolutionary army are spies for WG.<br>I did not claim that "most" of São's underlings will betray him.<br><br>Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You keep putting words in my mouth. <br>YOU asked me to elaborate<br><br> Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim. <br><br>has nothing to do with CP0. Not a thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait holy shit</br>  <br>You are still relying on straw man after straw man. You realize that Laffite was in talks with WG shown on panel at the shichibukai meeting before Ace was killed and that Teach was Ace's crew mate for years and years before he back stabbed his friend Thatch, right?</br>  <br>then fucking talk to me asshole i'm bored</br>  <br>how's the wife?</br>  <br>There's literally a watermark anon.</br>  <br><br>Was Fujitora always blind from birth or did he get blinded in both eyes by the [swordsman?] who gave him that scar?</br></br>  <br>It's likely we'll learn of Fujitoras past in Wano.</br>  <br>Seems stupid for Ceasar to be valuable in the black market.<br><br>All he has is his bounty or whatever Big Mom's willing to pay. Not everyone can give him an island and the chemicals for Cesar to make SMILES for them. Unless Oda really wants Big Mom and Kaido to fight, Ceasar is not that important and I don't believe Capone has any interest in him besides obeying someone else's orders.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that he built a nuke BEFORE he had smiles or any real supplies? Dude is still the second smartest character introduced after vegapunk, even without a lab. Plus Big Mom and Kaido seem like the two people most likely to be able to actually give him the stuff he needs. Which isn't to say that Capone isn't working for Big Mom, he probably is.</br>  Was Doffy Tsuru's boytoy?  <br>Have they ever met or interacted at any point in the story?</br>  <br>I want speedreaders to leave</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot, they met once right after Croc was deposed.<br><br>Still a weird as shit pairing</br></br></br>  <br> animefags </br>    <br>She also pursued his crew during Law's flashback. Do you even read, anon?</br>  <br>Still not entirely correct, stop being a speedreader.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, look at these panel layouts and posing. I completely forgot how awesome these were. What happened? All of New World feels so flat and simple compared to this...</br>  <br>This. That water weakness reveal. Such an epic fight. Such a page turner. AAAAHHH.</br>  <br>I forgot about that too, although in fairness to me they never were actually shown interacting.</br>  <br>I disagree, I'd say his crew treats him way more as a captain this arc. They always asked his permission to do things. Franky with the dwarves, Sanji with Big Mom.<br><br>Stop being a powerlevel fag that thinks character development = fighting skill.<br><br>The only true disappointing fight was Diamante, and maybe Burgess. Even Picas actions were on par with his character because in the chapter we learned about his voice, Doffy told him the battle would decide who would be king, that's why he targeted King Riki and challenged his ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is tsuru his aunt?</br>  Who else should i add to this?  Vizanon is MIA  <br> Kuma <br> Croc <br> abandoned <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>Kuma will never be explained.</br>  Does anyone else feel like Kaido is a good guy? Or at least a fallen good guy like one of those Raoh/Toguro scenarios?<br><br>I think him, Rogers, and Raleigh are like Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy. They've already shown Shanks can look like a devil to other pirates that don't know him.</br></br>  <br> Oda is still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. <br>Oda goddammit, stop it. Wasn't the entire point of his last hiatus so he could get out of that habit?</br></br>  <br> kuma <br> crocodile <br> roger <br>roger is dead and still we get the flashbacks of him from rayleigh <br>croco has been shown a lot throughout the series and he is still a prominent character<br>kuma is the same</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him needs an explanation?</br>  <br>You are kidding, right?</br>  <br>What's the Sanji abandoned plotline? <br><br>And how is Morgan still relevant? <br><br>Also what's abandoned about Kuma and Croc?<br><br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely all high tier pirates are devils to their enemies.</br>  <br>For being the wise man he is it surprises me that he's previously so unable to see the pure goodness in Luffy, despite his being a pirate.</br>  <br>Alvida.</br>  <br>The guy with speed and claws from ussop island</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Is with Buggy</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I get the feeling that all the yonko are chill and only have skirmishes for appearances <br><br>Hell Big Mom is probably really reasonable besides the people eating thing. Kaido may just be a big friendly gorilla who happens to like fisticuffs</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because he's too strong in the water that he's waiting so long to let him join. If he just let someone as strong as Luffy join off the bat it'd break his Luffy fighting the main villian every arc since Jinbe could crush them.<br><br>As for Akainu I agree, him and Kinnemon are probably the only ones who could beat Akainu with their skills, Kinnemon being with firesealing. (Unless they say fuck it and just like Zoro damage him with Haki like they did with Marco)</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy. <br> the first time we see what the grand line is all about is not worth remembering <br> the first time zoro shows his devotion to luffy is not worth remembering  <br> fucking roger is not worth remembering </br></br></br></br>  <br>Morgan not being relevant is the point.<br>Kuma's whole deal with the marines is never explained, along with his entire backstory.<br>I added crocodile as a bonus hilarious joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kumas backstory will come during the revolutionary arc or the Vegapunk arc, be patient anon</br>  <br>To be honest, I kind of feel like Fujitora is going to join. If not now than later.<br><br>I only say that because if Aokij joined blackbeard, it's only fair that the rivaling crews both get an ex marine. <br><br>(I'm still hoping Hajrudin is next strawhat)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What we know:<br>Kuma is a warrior priest for the revolutionary army.<br>Kuma apparently made a trade accepting brain death and use as a WG Weapon as the cost.<br>Dragon allowed this.<br>Anon it just doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haki was an asspull later in the series and you know it. He just kind of said "Okay, the seamonster Shanks intimidated and the listening ability on Sky Island is part of this new system I'm introducing. Everyone accept it because it was there all along"</br>  <br><br>It was obvious that something like haki had to exist. There's no way you can let logias run around unchecked like that and have people like shanks be remarkable without some type of ability.</br></br>  <br>It's ok because Oda is the king of asspulls.<br><br>Eg: This guys was invented to explain how the door higuma kicks off in the 1st chapter is repaired a few pages later. He is a carpenter who cannot let any building go unrepaired.</br></br></br>    Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world. The first is Benn Beckman. Kuro will return.    <br>That's Roger? I never watched the Anime. He looks nothing like he does in the manga.<br><br>Who is the purple haired faggot though? I want to say Don Krieg but I pictured him differently as well. Plus there's no reason for him to be relevant either.</br></br></br>  <br>CP0<br>Big Mom<br>Bartolomeo's BIG SUITCASE <br>Sabo<br>Koal's it'd be dangerous to luffy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't tell Kuma that they'd be replacing his brain, he joined the shichibukai as a spy, agreed to become a weapon for reasons that aren't explicitly stated but easily guessable (get stronger/get more info, etc), and then had the deal altered to destroy his brain when he couldn't disobey</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4983818/<br>Which saga is the best?</br>  <br>What if he's a member of CP 1-8</br>  <br> my master plan <br> pretend to be a butler for years <br> to have a chance at some small town hick girl's money <br> instead of just killing her, forging a few documents and taking the money </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I figured as much. But it still seems lazy to introduce it so much later in the series.<br><br>Maybe he could have done a system where the fruit users had to take eachother out or something where they have to figure out clever ways to hurt the Logia like Luffy did with Crocodile.<br><br>Frankie beams Blackbeard and GG. Jinbei waterlogs Akainu. Kizamuro is beaten by mirrors or something. Fuck if I know. I didn't think it'd just turn to Dragonballz where strongest wins instead of figure out how to beat the opponents.<br><br>Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that intelligence list was created during east blue when there were like 30 characters. Vegapunk is likely the smartest man in the world. And Benn Beckman is more "wise" than "smart."</br>  <br> if they used bullshit made up on the spot and never mentioned again to win fights it would be jjjba <br><br>I'm sure you meant to say that.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they only wear the mask when they can be recognized by their target. They wore masks on Dressrosa, but Doffy talked to the leader after Marineford and he was unmasked, proving this.</br>  <br> Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure. <br><br>You whine about asspulls, yet use Jojo as a comparison?</br></br></br>  <br>kuro Is the name</br>  <br>We don't have any clue if the guy Doffy talked to was related to CP0. They wore similar hats and that's about it.</br>  <br>Oda was an assistant on Kenshin so you'd have to be retarded to believe he didn't plan haki all along and foreshadow and even use it under varying names before he revealed it to the protagonist.</br>  <br>best movie right here</br>  <br> Haki was an asspull </br>  <br><br>Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better.</br></br>  <br> abondened plot <br> One Piece </br></br>  <br>Gears after 2 and Haki weren't introduced on the spot, and the author actually remembers that they exist and how they work, so yes, it's way better than JJBA. Awakening is too early to tell, but if it's never mentioned again then it will be tied with JJBA, which does the same goddamn thing more than once.</br>  <br>the explain the florian triangle monsters</br>  <br>According to a letter send from Miura to SK forums, we are at the 70% of the story.</br>  <br>Dressrosa was more about the plight and danger of the country itself, I feel.</br>  <br>this was a plot? when?</br>  <br>Ok. Please adopt a trip.<br>Doflamingo commanded Pacifista when he attempted to assassinate Moira for someone "higher up" than Sengoku.<br>Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed.<br>Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command.<br> Doffy carrying out assassination of Shichibukai for WG. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening has already been mentioned a few times. Chopper awakened his fruit every time he goes monster mode.</br>  <br>since it was now</br>  <br>just drawn to make the background look eery</br>  <br> don't hear of haki until 500+ chapters in <br> everyone and there dog has it now <br> expects us to believe people like Shanks, Crocodile, Ace, Arlong, Buggy, any of the CP9, Garp, anyone in Alabasta, any of the marines like smoker, anyone on Sky Island despite already having Mantra, or anyone else for that matter used Haki other than possibly Shanks and the listening haki on Sky Island despite alot of them being in legendary groups like Roger's crew, Fisher Tiger's crew, white beard's crew <br><br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing is ever abandoned in OP, even the gaimon and sarfunkel gag took 600 chapters to be revealed</br>  <br>Introducing a huge threat and mystery and then ignoring it is abandoning a potential plot line.</br>  <br>That's nowhere near enough to say that they're the same person, because, again, the only connection between the two is 'similar hat'.</br>  Reminder that this is the reason why Doflamingo is deathly afraid of Tsuru.  <br>it was not an asspull simply because it was already introduced in Skypia</br>  <br> Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better. <br><br>That you're stupidly comparing haki to DBZ is retarded enough, but you're compounding your stupidity by using the 'Jojo card' while assuming that OP and Jojo fanbases are so far removed, that someone wouldn't notice this, it does nothing but make you look like a complete faggot. <br><br>If you just want to man up now and admit that you were spouting bullshit and bating to cover up for the fact you didn't know what the fuck you're talking about, feel free to.<br><br>That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed. <br> Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command. <br><br>If anything, this seems to indicate they're different people, because the first guy wants to know why Doffy didn't follow orders, while the second guy is following Doffy's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>potential means it never was a real plot line</br>  <br>It is if no one has it or knows it by name and now everyone has it and knows it by name including previous characters who didn't even reference or use it. If Shanks knocked out the bandits, then it wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br>Alabasta had a war between its own citizens orchestrated by Baroque Works.<br><br>The civil war occurred before Luffy defeated Crocodile. Don't you remember Vivi almost averted it but infiltrators in her royal army shot Koza?<br><br>It was much more dramatic and realistic than the birdcage and the fighting continued for a little even after Luffy made it rain by KOing Crocodile. Vivi screamed and screamed finally ending it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB referred to haki by name in Jaya. He even said that he was surprised how small Luffy's bounty was when his haki was so powerful.</br>  <br>I was comparing the fact that they made people go from shit like Rubber man, Chopchop man, Slipman, etc as the main fighting style to WHO IS THE STRONGEST to dragonballz. You can't say it isn't. It's no different than when Yuyu hakashu got rid of psychic style fighting to just see who has the strongest powerlevels.</br>  <br>Morgan is done, he showed up in Coby's story and again in Django's. There's no reasonable way for him to be relevant again<br><br>Only character's Oda has ditched are Kuro and his cat underlings, all the Krieg pirates, Chessmarimo and Enel's priests. You could include Foxy but he's exactly the kind of gag villain Oda loves and I'm sure he'll find a way back. Everyone else has gotten some kind of callback or reference.</br></br></br>  <br> That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid. <br><br>This.<br><br>Even Luffy 'solution' to G4's weakness of just pumping Gear 3rd into it screams like some shit Luffy would do, which what makes it fucking hilarious this is what finished Doffy off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, but she's quite old so she's not likely to be a threat other than her fruit.</br>  <br>Is Nen an asspull because Kite didn't use it in chapter 1 to save Gon?</br>  <br>Jokes are boring if retold. Foxy won't come back</br>  <br>You realize that Gear 4 just turns Luffy into a giant rubber ball, right? How is that not rubberman powers?</br>  <br>Yea the thing is you are wrong they are "both" directly tied to Doffy and work in a high up WG position.<br>Which means it is pretty likely the same person in a canon where non navy hats are mostly unique and the main character literally is called by the hat he wears.</br></br>  <br>He used haki as "willpower" there. He was referring to Luffy just taking a beating from Bellamy and still believing in Skypeia.</br>  <br> she's not a threat if you take out what's threatening about her <br>are you okay anon</br></br>  <br>Because Zoro can ships and mountains in half.</br>  <br>Mihawk did that in chapter 40something</br>  <br>It is, but for other reasons.<br>I still somehow like it.</br></br>  <br>Not him but he also referred to it in Impel Down</br>  <br> it's an asspull if you disregard all the things that doesn't make it an asspull !!!!!!! </br>  <br>I figured the second mate of Krieg that Sanji fought would eventually make a name for himself and fight Sanji like they promised ;_;</br>  <br>That's the reason it got lost in translations, but the word "haki" IS used.</br>  <br> You can't say it isn't. <br>It isn't. It is still completely possible that a fruit user can beat a strong haki user. See Law vs Vergo. Luffy vs Doffy also was not decided by who had the strongest haki or anything like that. There are no powerlevels in One Piece, period.</br></br>  <br><br> asspull <br> introduced in the very first chapter <br><br>Yeah... about that....</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said 500 plus chapters</br>  <br>nottothisoshittoagain.jpg</br>  <br>It was first explicitly mentioned and used when Shanks knocked everybody out on WB's crew in 434.</br>  <br><br>Seems pretty obvious to me that they're the same. Doffy "followed" orders, but he also didn't give a shit about the repercussions of not completing them or talking back. They followed his orders on Dressrosa because he's blackmailing them<br><br>Not to jump on you two in particular but I really hate this small subset of fans who refuse to believe anything until its stated literally in the manga. Sabo was alive, Kuzan was with Blackbeard, this guy is CP0, Capone is by all the evidence we have on Big Mom's ship. Why ignore the information given because "it might not be"?</br></br></br></br>  <br> See Law vs Vergo. <br><br>Law used haki to defeat Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's not proven to be true.</br>  <br>I'm sure if they introduce Stands next chapter, then within 50 chapters everyone has them and Oda tries to say he already did stands at one point and it's what makes Sanji's legs hot, you'd try to justify it as not an asspull.</br>  <br><br>We already know what makes Sanji's legs hot, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he get poisoned saving Sanji's life?<br><br>Plus I just don't see Krieg attempting to go through the Grand line after getting his ass kicked by Mihawk twice, then by Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Oda can find a way to make it internally consistent and not contradict anything in the story, then it's not an asspull. Do you think an asspull just means 'a new power is introduced'?</br>  <br>Okay. 434 chapters is when it actually comes into existence which is still a long fucking time and an asspull. My bad. It wasn't really explained until Shabondy though around 500 chapters in.</br>  <br> Lucky Roo fast steps so fast in the panels it is like he fucking teleported when he shoots bandit. <br>For years people speculate Roo as fastest in the world.<br>The first Haki shown was CoO, it is how Shanks found Luffy.<br>The second is CoC, when Shanks glares at a sea monster and it runs away. You should swim in central CA pacific and give a great white shark a "intimidating stare" if you think that was not haki.</br></br></br></br>  The fact Luffy mentioned that Garp could hurt him even though he's rubber multiple times was an indicator of CoA haki early on.  <br><br>No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it.</br></br>  <br>Just because something isn't explicitly introduced in chapter 1 doesn't make it an asspull. All haki does is take a bunch of pre-existing powers that weren't explained and give them one. That's not an asspull, it's not even a retcon,</br>  <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and purposefully hides his frontside <br> 120 chapters later <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and shows his frontside <br> its somehow not the same guy <br>I appreciate a skeptic but c'mon. Unless there's another leading Cipher Pol agent with an identical hat its the same person</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard uses the phrase Haki back in Jaya, he said he knew Luffy's Haki was too great for a 30 million bounty, it was just translated normally back then.</br>  <br>no, he just sliced him inside his room</br>  <br> and an asspull <br>holy shit just fuck off already</br></br>  <br>That was typical anime bullshit. HE'S SO STRONG HE STARED DOWN A SEAKING!<br><br>That's another point that he turned it into Dragonballz basically.<br><br>Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. But he couldn't use any Haki to beat it, just let it take his arm, didn't attempt to kill it, etc. Yet somehow Luffy at the beginning of the series when he sets off punches it in the face and knocks it out. <br><br>One Piece wasn't supposed to just turn into a muscle flexing contest where everyone is superman tier. It was supposed to be about powers and shit then it diverged.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could Luffy damage a spring man who is Springs instead of Blades like Mr. 1?  <br><br>It's actually the opposite. He was shocked that with his current level that he was even worth 30m, much less 100m. It was in the aftermath of him knocking out bellamy</br></br>  Smoker is pretty much done for as a rival figure. He is currently far away from Luffy and arriving at Vegapunk's in a few days, that translates to hundreds of chapters, next time he'll show up will probably be when our main characters meet Vegapunk. By then Luffy will be even more magnitudes stronger than Smoker, worse Smoker is still healing his wounds, so he can't even hope of training.  <br> chapter 1 <br><br>yeah, chapter 10 maybe. Maybe after Arlong Park that'd be cool?<br><br>But 434 chapters... Come on now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The justification is what makes it not an asspull. If something new was introduced WITHOUT any justification, then it would be an asspull. Do you not have any idea what the terms you use mean?<br><br>An asspull is something a character, y'know, pulls out of their ass to win a fight. That sure as fuck doesn't apply to haki.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. <br><br>Maybe because he wasn't a Yonkou back then? Shit, a year in OP can get you an assload of power. Look at where Luffy has gotten in 2.</br></br></br>  <br> Blackbeard didn't chase/attack Luffy till he BTFO a man made of springs with a punch <br>He chased Luffy so fast too, considering Luffy sprinted all the way back and they immediately set sail but were still almost overtaken</br></br>  <br> No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it. <br><br>This from the guy who seriously try to defend throwing around the term 'asspull' by using Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as in a series 'where there are no unexplained powers' and 'everyone fights cleverly, not unlike DBZ'.<br><br>Since you're not going to apologize and own up to the your own faggotry, I'm going to disregard your statements (which have been repeatedly refuted easily) as shit-posting.<br><br>To that end, calling something you're too daft to understand an asspull, does not an asspull make.<br><br>It just means you have really shitty reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are talking toys an asspull because they weren't introduced until 702? Even if haki had never been used once before in the series and Oda didn't retcon other stuff into being haki, it still wouldn't be an asspull just because it was introduced a while in.</br>  <br>Super strength has been a part of every strong character's power set since forever, was there any powerful guy that didn't have super strength?<br>Crocodile and Enel probably come closest.</br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking <br><br>Stop being a powerlevel faggot. It was either stop the seaking or save Luffy, there was no time for both.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember reading somewhere that Oda didn't want Shanks to lose an arm, one of his editors made him do it. I guess it gets a pass since it was so early on and Oda had no idea OP would get so big.<br><br>"Oda had no intention that Shanks lost his arm, but after an editor told him that the story was not interesting enough, Oda decided to cut his arm off. ONE PIECE Grand Countdown 2 (2010)"</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he somehow had swordfights with Mihawk before he lost his arm?</br>  <br>What makes Sanji's leg hot is similar to Okama Kenpo and Bon Kurei's spinning kicks<br><br>The difference between 400 or so chapters of haki appearing hear and there and your example is that the former has appeared in the first 400 chapters here and there and your example comes from your dumbass. Cherry picking is for idiots, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Devil Fruits were introduced.</br>  <br>Before anyone speculates that Mihawk and Shanks weren't big deals back then, Whitebeard remarked that their duels were legendary, so Shanks most definitely was strong as hell before he met Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah it does seem strange that a Yonkou would be just chilling out in the East Blue and no one would comment on it.</br></br>  <br>That was a good call.</br>  Holy shit and I thought all those underaged retards who keep misusing the word "asspull" only crawl out of their shitholes on chapter release days  <br>And yet somehow a seaking that Luffy one punched chapter one took his arm.<br><br>Don't give me that he didn't have time or he bet it on the new generation shit either, we know it's just a fuckup on Oda's part.</br></br></br>  <br> we know <br>no, fuck off</br></br>  <br>This came out in 2000, and this light novel contained material Oda cut from Loguetown so that he could enter the Grand Line at chapter 100, so Haki would have popped up around 100.<br>"If you've ever read the light novel adaptation upon which Oda collaborated on, there was a scene where a fortune-teller who reads people's faces reveals to Luffy that he has the 'Sign of King's Ambition'. Lit. 覇王の相. This is interesting because in Japanese fortune-telling there is the Sign of the Emperor 帝王の相　and the palm-reading 覇王の手相 most commonly known as the 覇王線 or 'Line of King's Ambition' is specifically meant for palm-reading. This means the term was probably created uniquely for this scene."<br>http://apforums.net/showthread.php?<wbr>t=27758&amp;page=256&amp;p=3139755#post3139<wbr>755</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>They are shitposters but newfags keep replying to them</br>  <br> using insults because you can't make a valid argument <br><br>kek.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't have time and had to choose between letting Luffy get eaten or sacrifice his arm to save Luffy.</br>   people legitimately mad about the seaking <br>It was the first chapter of a story that's evolved greatly in the past 18 years. Its not a big deal<br><br><br>Imagine if Garp wanted to check on Luffy during the year Shanks was there. The fucking shitshow that would be</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ye. That's not relevant though. We all know Oda was just referencing pirate king.</br>  Did Mihawk have the title of strongest swordsman before Shanks lost his arm, because he refuses to fight him anymore. For all Mihawk knows, Shanks could beat him.  <br><br>Shanks is most likely the most recent addition to the Yonkou before the timeskip.</br></br>  <br>well the word "retard" best describes faggots like you who misuse buzzwords and do not know what their true meaning</br>  <br><br>Since Garp repeatedly "cornered" the Roger pirates... Doesn't that mean Shanks/Garp are likely to have fought in the past?<br><br>Still, it would be fucking hilarious to see two of the strongest fighters dicking about in the East blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No you idiot. Have you ever considered the possibility that Higuma was legitimately strong with a low bounty like Blackbeard and ambushed Shanks in a bar full of bystanders, women and children?<br>Then Shanks negotiated his way outside and owed everyone except Higuma who escaped?<br><br>Shanks lost his arm because saving Luffy took all his concentration and he therefore could not defend his own arm.<br><br>Kenshin Himura (a red head swordsman with a scar on his face) falls on his ass when he lands a blow on Seijuro Hiko for the same reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world.  <br> The first is Benn Beckman. <br>First of all, you mean "the east blue", not the world. Second, that sbs was only in reference to the characters who'd been introduced up to that point.</br></br></br>  <br>He had plenty of time. Reread the first chapter. Luffy was about to get eaten and he pulled him back. He could have easily cut it's head off in the way that guy cut the giant snakes head off on Sky Island's flashback. Or if he was actually as strong as Mihawk he could have thrown a slash like Mihawk did.<br><br>Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? :3</br></br></br>  <br>Mihawk refuse to fight Shanks because he lost his good arm, however Oda has stated Shanks didn't lose any power at all, but it would probably leave Mihawk a bad taste since muh swordman code.</br>  <br>"Fought" a cabin boy on Roger's ship? Garp probably just focused on the big shots, Roger, Rayleigh, and Gaban.</br>  <br> Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? <br><br>Yeah, no one has ever bitten through armament before.</br></br></br>  <br>Lol. Just no. Reread chapter one. All of Higuma's got rekt instantly. Higuma got eaten by the seaking and Shanks pulled Luffy back instead of trying to deliver an attack.</br>  <br> :3 </br>    <br>Still, does that mean Mihawk's title is meaningless, nobody ever mentions who won their famous duels, and he won't fight a cripple.<br>How can he claim to be the best if he refuses to fight one of the strongest swordsmen alive?</br></br>  <br> How can he claim to be the best <br><br>When has Mihawk ever called himself the strongest? It's a title given to him.

And how far Shanks had to travel in the one second of time it would have taken for that eel to eat Luffy is unknown except Shanks was on shore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying that during that split second, Shanks swam there and if he attacked the seaking first, Luffy still would have died.</br>  <br> Higuma spent the last 12 years inside the sea king <br> waiting <br> watching <br> planning </br></br></br></br>  <br>He did, not only that he used a speed hack to reach Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Who says he could?

We don't even know if they have it in the story as is.</br></br>  <br>I believe the only reason none consider Mihawk still a runner up for the title is that Shanks is not known nor he consider himself a swordsman, and he probably isn't anyway, people like Shanks, Rayleigh, Kizaru or Fujitora, use a sword but have way more fighting skills and haki/df abilities, even Mihawk stated being the best swordsman is easygame compared to aiming for the PK.</br>  <br>Is the story over?

She was a completely manipulative slut who used Jesus Yamato's feelings for her to get revenge. Arguably her actions did actually help move the plot along. Still, a total whore.  This little cuntmuffin.  <br>Kishimoto actually likes her, he just can't write women so they don't come out as dumb cunts. All good females in Naruto are good because he didn't pay attention to them.</br>  <br>Flay is so fucking terrible i had actually purged her from my memory until just now.</br>  <br/>  <br>Would you not cum on her forehead?</br>  <br>No. I would shoot it with a gun.</br>  <br>Kishi reached a point where even he himself had realized that he had fucked up with Sakura's character and publicly admitted that she's "a horrible person", at which point he began upgrading Hinata to become more of the lead heroine in the series.</br>  <br> saying no to this <br><br>You're probably as much of a faggot as Sasuke.</br></br></br>   anyone shittier than pinkshit <br><br>nobodies more terrible than sakura. she fails more on parenting than sasuke</br></br>  <br>I'd rather say yes to this titfucking Hinata.<br><br>Also, calling Sasuke a faggot is an insult to people who really are gay.<br><br>Sasuke is just asexual and not to mention a complete autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh yeah we mention worse girl all the time, you're Just new</br>  <br>What I mean is that we don't shame worst girls as often as we should.</br>  Too easy    <br>Karin is not the mother</br>  <br>Sure you would but I didn't give you a choice.<br><br>If you wouldn't fuck Sakura, you're probably a faggot. She's sexy as fuck.</br></br></br>  Haven't kept up with Naruto ever since the main-manga ended. Is The Last finally out in good quality?  <br>Two days 'til Jap BD. Expect a high quality rip + subs shortly after.</br>  <br> the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie </br>  <br>Karin is hotter and even Sauce agree.</br>  <br> &gt;the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie <br>Obviously since the Nurutu movie already have official subs.</br></br>   naruto   <br>I've started watching it.<br>So far she seems like a bothersome cunt but I actually dislike Hinata more.<br>She's just "Oh look so shy uguu".<br>At least at this point.<br>Sasuke hasn't went full edgelord as everyone says yet.<br>Also didn't expect to like Rock Lee.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching Naruto </br>  <br>I played the Ultimate Storm game and the animations and shit looked really interesting.<br>Its not as bad as I thought so far.<br>I hear it really goes to fucking shit though; especially when it hits shippuden.</br></br></br>  <br>this manhating cunt right here</br>   tries to kill literally everybody   <br>Junko tried to kill literally everybody.

Someone call the paramedics.</br>  <br><br>Misato is better than both</br></br>  <br>Kishi probably read a poll and realize how popular was Sasusaku. Japan's national motto is "if ain't broken, don't fix it". Some may say that Kishi gave so much importance to Sasuke for the same reason but I think Kishi is genuinely in love of the sauce while he can't find a reason why Sakura loves Sasuke</br>  <br><br>See</br></br>  <br>she was always shit even with out sasuke she was a shit tsunderer trash</br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with Sakura except that they forgot to develop her character early on so she ended up being behind everyone else, which was unfixable without having a bunch of arcs dedicated to only developing her character, which of course they couldn't do since she wasn't popular as a MC type character like Naruto and Sasuke were. Just make her learn to be some kind of badass in some way early on, and suddenly the problem fixes itself for the entire rest of the show without even changing anything else</br>  ruined the fucking show  Pic related.<br>Literally the most autistic, pathetic and beta heroine I've seen in ages.</br>  <br>Sasuke is at least 90% of what is wrong with Sakura. Both her bitchiness towards Naruto and her general uselessness can be attributed to her obsession with him</br>  <br> liking a slut who admits she sleeps around cause she doesn't like to be cold in bed,so she seeks out warmth from other people bodies, and likes to fill the hole of emptiness with sex </br>  <br><br>How about:<br><br>Haru in Nisekoi<br>Manami in Oreimo<br><br>You litterally can't top this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata body is ruined by her terribad fashion sense.</br>  <br>Considering how many women can relate to Sakura and root for sasusaku, I think Kishi did something right</br>  <br>Early/mid-shippuuden (with the Hidan and Kakuzu fight, Sasuke and Itachi fight, Pain vs Jiraiya and Naruto vs Pain) is the peak of the Naruto series though. At that point it's legitimately fucking amazing.<br><br>Other than that it's mostly garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>She's delicious brown though. You can't hate delicous brown.</br>  <br>The real problem is that she does not possess an actual character, any ideas behind who she is besides Kishi's idea of an average girl who eventually had Tsunade's moveset grafted onto her.<br><br>I wouldn't even mind her being a cunt all that much if people called her out on her. Part 2 ino would have been a great opportunity, someone who now gets on well with her team, is a good coordinator and unlike Pinkshit seems to have developed, if offscreen, from the shallow fangirl that both she and Sakura were in Part 1. Maybe make Sakura realise that despite having been granted powers solely on the grounds that she was the third wheel of muh Team 7, she is nowhere near as effective team member as her rival is. Bam, development.<br>Instead, even when Naruto calls her bullshit confession, he only tells her that she is lying to herself as well as him, rather than outright telling her to stop presuming the world revolves around her.<br><br>Hell, maybe do something with the whole illusion angle she was stated to be good at instead of the medical stuff that makes her butthurt over not grabbing the limelight every single fight she's in, and throw in some more clever, basic stuff with tools as opposed to the divine gift her (ex) team members were using all the fucking time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They just want to fuck Sasuke themselves</br>  <br>Being cute but having no flair for fashion and hiding her assets behind comfortable clothing was a core element of her character, and it is a nice detail about her.</br>  <br> She'll be badass in my private headcanon. </br>  <br>They actually hate Sakura too, just like they hate themselves.</br>  <br>Got dang</br>  <br> muh cute and shy moeblob <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a charm point I say. Naruto isn't known for his good fashion sense either.</br>  <br>10/10 should have been the lean, well-built action girl.<br>Sakura's thing actually works by magic manipulation, not through muscles. The pic's nice, but all it has in common with Pinkshit is the colour of her hair.</br></br>  <br>At least she snapped Naruto out of quitting. Sakura on the other hand couldn't go through with doing anything to Sasuke. Even Naruto who was also a big doormat concerning Sasuke was at least willing to trade blows with the guy.</br>  <br>Horrible NTRing bitch</br>  <br> one thinks wearing horrible neon orange tracksuits is a sensible idea for a ninja <br> the other does not give a single fuck about fashion or prettying herself up as she's got a case of single target sexuality and does not want to attract anyone else <br> the two have a /fa/ as fuck son <br>That's actually pretty fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She only fucked Kaji</br>  <br> Hur dur there's nothing wrong with Sakura except she never developed and stayed the same as she was in chapter 1, that is an unlikable cunt. <br><br>Sakura up until Shippuden was popular with Japnese fans, but she kept disappointing them and so they gave up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>Most women actually hate Sakura, its only the loud ones you hear a lot but even tumblr the females who like her and Sasuke are actually in the minority.</br>  <br>Not saying that Sakura is any better, but Hinata is a boring doormat character also. Hinatafags are also the worse there is.</br>  <br>She was a cunt sure, but she had an interesting character arc. When she died, the tone of the original show died with her and paved way for the less dark and more kid friendly turd known as Gundam Seed Destiny. I am not saying Seed was a masterpiece, but it sure as hell was better than Destiny.</br>  <br>Isn't that literally what I just said? They didn't develop her enough, so she became unpopular. Maybe she was more popular at the start with Japanese fans than she was with American fans (because Americans are obsessed with feminism and Japanese people aren't as much), but the actual lack of development was still the problem regardless</br>  <br>Sakurafags only care about the fanon version of her.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but what the fuck did she even do in part 1 to get popular in the first place?<br> dramatic haircut that achieved nothing <br> mutual knockout in her one proper fight (and would have lost completely if not for magical multiple personality disorder), in all others just standing in the back with a kunai <br> jumps inbetween Nardo and Sausage launching their most powerful attacks at each other, by all rights the point where she should have died </br></br></br></br>  <br>This. People act as if hinata is the best female in the series because of "muh naruto". She's better than sakura but that doesn't say much and hinata is basically a doormat as you said.</br>  <br>She drives? weren't they supposed to be high school freshmen/juniors? I don't know myself, but I doubt Japanese driver's license is for people under 18.</br>  <br>Gundam SEED Destiny never happened.</br>  <br>I agree with <br><br>I think it's totally fine that she was obsessed with Sasuke at first. Damn, I'm even okay with her staying that way until meeting again with Sasuke in part two. It's pretty psycho that way but it would have worked if she were allowed to move on. Instead she's emotional garbage.<br><br>Her skillset has been worse than Naruto's since the beginning of part 2. As it's a battle shounen, this is the biggest insult.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get advertised a lot. Have slutty pink hair.</br>  <br> but Hinata is a boring doormat character <br><br> is perfectly aware of her main character flaw and her foremost goal is to correct it and become a better person <br> fights Neji who does everything she can but better and then some, he takes his sweet time as he picks her motivations, beliefs and sense of self apart, psychoanalyzing her to hell and back, yet she stubbornly refuses to yield, standing up time and time again <br> is willing to stand up to a living god who just nuked her hometown to protect the man she loves, declaring her feelings and overcoming her greatest fault <br> when said man is in his lowest point she slaps some sense into him, and rallies him as well as the whole army <br><br>Those are just the most obvious points. It is okay to not like Hinata, but form a criticism of her that is actually true as she's not a doormat. Gentle, kind, reserved, even demure, perhaps, but that is a far cry from being a doormat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up fag</br>  <br>don't forget she ripped a mans eyes off</br>  It was only a matter of time.  <br>I was thinking more about her characterization within the main series.<br>You are right, though, she gets some good stuff in the Last. Plucking her sister's eyes right out of her captor's skull while he screams for mercy was pretty neat.</br></br>  <br>All of these are typical waifubait traits for self-insert fags. <br><br>I bet you think Onodera and Kobeni are well written characters too.</br></br></br>  <br>The question at hand isn't about whether the character is written well. This is fucking Naruto we are talking about, nothing really lives up to any proper standards of quality.<br>The question was whether the character in question is a doormat, like you said she was. I have demonstrated that she is not.</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga if you're gonna pick up Naruto. Studio Pierrot fucking sucks.</br>  <br>No one except Kakashi is well written in Naruto.</br>  <br>Just admit you don't like Hinata because of her personality and just leave it like that.</br>  <br>Keep with the games, even Kishi said they are the best way to enjoy the story.</br>  <br><br>shut up.</br></br>  <br>Jiraiya has his moments, when Kishi isn't trying to rip off/reference Master Roshi with him.</br>  <br>Jaraiya?</br>  <br>It's weird because she both made the show better and worse. Yui needed a foil like Mio was to Ritsu and Yui and Mugi had zero chemistry with each other. Seriously, the group is dull as fuck without Azusa, she may be a nagging no fun allowed bitch, but she makes the show less dull even though she is annoying a lot of the time. She makes it better because my dick.</br>  <br>Muh naruto.</br>  <br><br>and shw was a doormat how?</br></br>  <br>To bad she's actually completely fucking useless in combat.</br>  <br><br>Yeah he has his moments too.</br></br>    <br>Except she isn't. Naruto and Sakura are bigger doormats than her.</br>  <br>I agree it was fine in the beginning. If it was any other story I would say you're supposed to not like Sakura then, but Kishimoto seems to think MUH SASUKE is romantic.<br><br>The worst part is that she WAS getting some development but she regressed back to her former self because Kishi couldn't come up with a plausible reason why she would love Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you're a faggot to let someone's personal choice in fashion cock block you.<br><br>Literally no fucks given to yourself I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura was hated from the very beginning. Especially by female readers, which is ironic since Kishi wrote Sakura with a female audience in mind. Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake.</br>  <br>That was one of the most endearing moments in the manga. Hinata wanted no more of Naruto's doom and gloom. That was not what she saw in him, and that is not what she fell in love with.</br>  <br>At least with Naruto it is justified in that he had the bad luck of having made his first friendship with Sausage after 12 years of being a hated/feared pariah with low self esteem, no social skills who was incredibly lonely, and they even started to develop an actual friendship/rivalry thing. <br>It's still fucked up and turns incredibly gay without Kishi even meaning to make it so, but from with a character who has massive abandonment issues I could see him imprinting on the idea of being best friends with an edgy murderous crazy bastard and carrying on with that idea to an irrational degree.<br><br>Sakura just wanted to fuck him because all the girls wanted to too, possibly also because he's a handsome bad guy later on.<br>The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to, having found better people they cared about on a personal level and everyone but her found happiness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this. Hinata was truly best girl and she deserved to win the Narubowl.</br>  <br> Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake <br>I fucking despise her character, but you gotta drop some sauce for that to be believed.</br></br>    <br>Sakura would've been a better character if she just given up on sauke like ino did in part two. She doesn't necessary need to be with naruto but find someone else besides sasuke and show some character development. In the end she just became a stupid bitch who fucked a guy who tried to kill her at least twice or more.</br>  <br>She was a doormat character up until she confessed her love to Naruto. Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. It took I don't know how many chapters for her to stop being a doormat so at this point, even though you're not for the last 10 chapters, you're still known as the doormat character.<br><br><br>Do you even know what a doormat is, you fucking retard?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> this thread <br> 0 pictures of Kirino <br> cntl-f kirino <br> 0 results <br> yet this image is posted <br><br>You've changed, /a/. I expected Kirino spam in this thread. I am proud of you. Manami a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino or Lee could have both been candidates, bot both deserve to have someone better thank Pinkshit.</br>  <br>Temari?Tsunade?Kushinu?<br>How was hinata best girl?<br>Could care less about the narutobowl because she was the only one in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you OP. This is literally waifuwars: the thread</br>  <br>Any girl from Sword Art Online.</br>  <br><br>The fuck even are you talking about? Hinata was fighting for herself, to prove that she changed against Neji.<br><br>Neji told her to forfeit several times but she didn't not because to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself. Naruto simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To keep a figure that thick, and healthy you need an appetite to support it.</br>  <br>Sasusaku recently won an internet poll as the best couple. Also, nurutu isn't precisely the kind of TV show that attract a sophisticated audience</br>  <br> Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. <br>She stood up for herself and the things she believed in. She was completely outclassed and already beaten, but called Neji out on his bullshit to a degree that it turned a feasible opportunity to belittle her and show off into getting told hard enough to make him lose his cool and attempt to fucking murder her right there.<br>Having been inspired by the MC to aspire to her goals does not change that she is not a doormat.<br><br>Her previous appearances before that were as a productive team member, someone skilled at academics or spying with her Byakugan and as a person willing to take a risk for someone whom she cared for. That was the lowest, most passive state and the earliest bit of her character arc we have seen her in, when she had trouble looking people in the eye.<br><br>As I said, it is okay to not like quiet and reserved, nice characters. But you don't need to pull unfounded bullshit out of your ass to support that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>* she didn't forfeit. and not to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself.<br><br>Naruto's nindou simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it was a rigged poll. ssfags on tumblr spammed the poll.</br></br>  <br>Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. Don't know what she sees in sasuke. Sakura has been ignored by sauke throughout most of the series yet she still loves him. Her relationship with sasuke is the biggest reason why people hate her guts. There is no real reason for her to love sasuke so much.</br>  <br> Caring about internet polls <br><br>You are this retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> internet poll <br>And which internet poll was that?</br></br>  Takiko from Tokyo Ravens  <br>Most of these faggots don't read the manga anyway. Only known because of memers. I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br> Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. <br>Eh, she's a cunt but it's ardly fair to expect her to just will herself to feel shit she does not. She clearly developed a degree of respect/affection for the guy, just not romantically.<br>Now if she actually questioned herself on what does it say about her, liking a guy who tolerates her at best and shunning others who stood up for her, even burning bridges of friendship for him, maybe she would not be as completely shit a character as she ended up as.</br></br></br>  <br>God, the first part of Naruto was so good.</br>  <br>Rock Lee is "ugly" compared to the prodigy Edgelord. Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys.</br>  <br> The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to <br>Karin wanted. Probably Ino too, considering she married Sai aka Sasuke's poor man</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's when the series naruto was at its best.</br>  <br>Female readers support their shallowness though. Read shoujo and watch K-drama</br>  <br>I just had a thread about her on /r/anime.<br>Naruto is the best anime.</br></br>  <br> Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys. <br>That's actually a great life lesson to teach little boys. Act like an edgelord and treat girls like shit and you'll have them on your cock. Act like a good guy and they'll friendzone you the rest of your life.<br><br>Kishimoto is actually a genius.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It works on every female-aimed media</br>  <br>Rock lee was a pretty good character back in the day</br>  <br>If you truly played the games then you should know how terrible Sakura is.</br>  <br><br> Naruto <br> best anime <br><br>And I bet that Sakura is your waifu, too<br><br>Fuck off back to Reddit, faggot. And take your troll bait with you, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rock Lee and Gai were cringy as fuck, bitches don't like that, and certainly the prom queen of bitches Sakura didn't like that.<br><br>Shit Sakura reminds me of those girls who were always on the bad guy's dick and then end up with three children and a guy who beats her shit for not being young</br></br></br>  <br>sakura is shit in any way possible</br>  <br>This. Sakura was a realistic bitch. The problem is how Kishi refused to write Naruto accordingly. No one admires a loser emasculated Nice Guy who lets himself be abused by a cunt. Women aren't attracted to such loser men and men don't want to be the guy who gets beat up by twats (which explains why only masochist losers like harem protagonists).</br>  All the bossy little meganekko bitches who turned out the way that they did because they have to wear glasses. I have yet to see an actually badass meganekko who isn't a total pretentious bitch or a clueless airhead. If someone can suggest me one I'll give you a cookie :D  Don't make challenges you can't win.  <br>Lee was just as bad. Especially since his dream still had him fucking Sakura.</br>  <br>To be fair now it's realistic. Women DON'T like Nice Guys. They don't get moist or turned on by such decent men. Only men respect Nice Guys and see them as stable individuals. But pussy? Pussy ain't getting tingles for Nice Guys so there you go.<br><br>If anything the best type of protagonists treat females poorly or are asexual. Shame that when it comes to asexual male characters in anime the cliche is retards like Luffy.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128351882 <br>I don't remember Sakura abusing Naruto that much though. You sure you are not confusing SP fillershit with her? She only hit him like three times early on and then once after the timeskip out of 700 chapters.</br>  <br>Women don't care about Nice guys or bad guys. They just care about resources. You need resources to get a girl.</br>  This dipshit. Right here.  <br>The best male character in Naruto was Shikamaru because he seriously reflects the current cultural values of young men in Japan. Meaning he finds pussy too much trouble/work to be worthwhile. Didn't his ideal dream involve the same simple life he was already leading under Madara's genjutsu?</br>  <br>You never heard of Alpha Fucks &amp; Beta Bucks? Thugs, cads, assholes, etc type of men generally have an easy time getting laid. Resources on the other hand are for the beta guys who are women's Plan B when they decide to settle down (meaning they get old to the point these alpha guys don't want them anymore and start going for the new crop of young women).<br><br>Having resources is just a sign of a man who women will parasite off of. And no, these women may use the resources to be provided for, but they do not love these men themselves. Just their provisions.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>But what gets on my nerves is when they start saying shit like "where are all the nice guys?", bitch, they are right there where you left them, in the friendzone.</br></br>  <br>Keeping her dangerous weapons concealed like a real ninja.</br>  <br>The typical shoujo fantasy is an irredemeable asshole who happen to be rich and the best at sports and grades without even trying</br>  <br>Not only do they leave them in the friendzone, but a saying that's catching on nowadays is:<br><br>"You left them in your early 20s."<br><br>Because let's face it, long term commitment is for the young and ignorant male. The longer a man grows into being single the less likely he'll have an interest in the rotten deal that is cohabitation/marriage. Ideally men want to experience the opposite sex when young because the thought of doing it when he's in his 30s with a woman who is ALSO in her 30s is a huge turn off as the woman is no longer at her prime.<br><br>There's a reason the saying "Men age like wine, but women age like milk" exists. It's damn true. No man wants a woman that is old, especially when you consider that a woman in today's world who is past her 20s has likely slept around and has been pumped and dumped by many other cocks making her sexual value zilch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Most rich men are assholes. If not all. You have to step over people to remain or stay rich after all.</br>  <br>She's not a doormat. That's just how fillers portray her because they go lowest common denominator.</br>  <br>True but not precisely the kind of asshole women dig</br>  <br>I'm going by the manga not the fillertarded anime.</br>  <br>Pussy tingles for dominant males who are strong, some kind of instinct for creating stronger offspring perhaps?<br><br>Most of them just tend to be assholes to girls. If they're not then they tend to fall into to many cliches like this dude</br></br></br>  <br>this pink shit. good god was she awful.</br>  If women dig assholes, why anons can't get laid? 4chan is full of assholes  <br>Does Salad count?</br>  <br>And for what it's worth, it's a bit shocking to see how many rich men even now still get raped in divorce. A fool and his money are soon parted.<br><br>It's especially shocking when said rich men divorce repeatedly like that actor John Cleese (got reamed in divorce 4 times) and now is truly broke. Then there are other sad stories like Robin Williams who everyone knows could not retire because of alimony payments, poor abused old dog ultimately killed himself because of parasite ex-wives.</br></br></br>  <br>because we are too sad. We have no lives. We have to fap to lolis instead. Lolis are the exception. Lolis dig Onii-chans, not assholes.</br>  <br>I don't know about John Cleese but Robin Williams was a junkie. His multiple marriages were just a sympton of his fucked up mind</br>  <br>those fucking whores</br>  <br> im a fucking retarded midget who loves to be abused </br>  <br> Haru in Nisekoi <br><br>Ayane Sakura in charge of voicing annoying tsungires.png</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Robin Williams was always too fucking high to think about things straight<br><br>He shoulda married cocaine</br></br></br>  <br>Ssfags voted for them and other people voted for them out of spite. Both characters are so terrible that they deserve nothing else but each other so that that level of shit could be contained.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure other people vote for Naruhina or their OTP rather than waste a vote on 2 characters they hate. Is it really that hard to believe? Women love crap like Hana Yori Dango and Itazura na kiss. The latter is still an abusive relationship even after marriage</br>  <br>Not really. Kishi did say a little girl came up and told him she hated Sakura. She was definitely not alone in that opinion.</br>  <br>I think anon means that people who for one reason or another were not happy with NH voted for SS as a protest.<br>I still think giving opinion polls and voting about non-concrete issues is fucking retarded.</br></br>  <br>Eh. Bad boys are definitely more attractive to most women but you have to draw the line when they try to murder you or if they are apathetic or condescending to your entire existence. <br>It's okay to appreciate them from afar but don't try to get into a relationship with someone who fully intended to kill you. That should go without saying.</br></br>  <br>You haven't even given us the source on the poll. Furthermore It's an internet poll.</br>  <br>That little girl is still into prince charmings. Once the hormones kick, it's all about dreamy wife beaters and the prince charming degrade into a "nice guy"</br>  <br>It won because ssfags advertised the shit out of it and it's very popular on tumblr. <br>Did any of the other ships try to rally votes like that?</br></br>    <br>I don't really see why people do this shit at all. Their voting achieves exactly fuck all.</br>  <br>I rarely see any girl (or boy) who actually like Sakura unless they already ship SS. <br>That phase of liking abusive relationships is mostly contained to teenage fangirls. After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br>Ugly nice guys who are poor are shit out of luck. It's for the best so they don't pass on their loser genes.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a medal for them. Naruhinas would be obnoxious about it if their OTP won. Any shipperfag would. That's one of the reasons why shipping faggotry is cancer</br>  <br> After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br> what's 50 Shades of Grey? <br> what's every Fabio-on-the-cover novel? </br></br></br>  <br>That's just how that fandom is. Since their ship is so hated they feel they have got something to prove. Winning a poll is like validation for them.<br>They could probably rally enough votes to say Sakura is the most beloved female character of all time, despite everyone knowing that is bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>everyone in 11eyes</br></br>  <br>No I'm talking about people who hate Sasuke and Sakura and so would rather they be together rather than with a decent character.</br>  <br><br>I can't even imagine what it must be like to actually gleam a portion of your identity from wanting to Sri Lankan graffiti characters fuck, never mind who the actual characters are.<br>Just enjoy cute fanart on pixxiv and keep it at that, is that so fucking hard? Sakurafags tend to be women, who tend to be the most fanart-production prone, so I imagine there must be a fuckton.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, yes. Everyone told me to watch Toradora because I enjoyed Clannad. I couldn't make it past episode 5 because I just couldn't handle her. She was too much of a bitch and Toradora wasn't even that good to me. The main character kept on stuttering every time someone talked to him and that was just annoying (at least in my opinion).</br></br>  <br>50 shades of Grey appeals to the teenage girl in women. But women don't want that shit in real life.</br>  Singlehandedly killed the whole show.  <br>Whatever man. The point is women dig that kind of shit on fiction. Hell, if I was a shoujo editor, I wouldn't let a mangaka to make a nice guy end. This is a business</br>  <br>No females who like Sakura then to immature and delusiional bitches, who hide their bitchiness under the moniker of them being "feminists". <br><br>Besides LadyGT there really aren't that many fanartists who draw Sakura, because again most women hate her.</br></br></br>  I win.  <br> Assmad Sakurafag calling my post bait <br><br>Typical. <br><br>Also, Hinata&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sakura</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In fiction being the key word here, and even then we are talking about a certain type of woman, aka a much older woman who hasn't gotten any in a while. <br><br>Actually the prince character is very popular in Shougo titles.</br></br></br>   singlehandedly killed the series   <br>Maybe on the 70s, when shoujo was writen by men. The current best selling title is Ao Haru Ride and the male lead is a by-the-number emo douchebag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128357750 <br>I don't know. I live on a third world shithole and it's common for men to cheat and hit their wives</br>  <br/>   awful tsundere <br> obnoxious drama queen <br> fanbase that rivals Narutards in shittiness <br><br>At least she loses hard.</br></br></br></br>   Tomo a shit.   <br>I agree.</br>    <br>/thread</br>  <br>I never seen such a wrong opinion about anything before.</br>  But she got cucked by Sasuke and is actually forced to raise his child with that redhead whore.  <br> But women don't want that shit in real life <br>Bwahahahaha.</br></br>  <br>This is true in my case.  When the fuck is Loyalty updating? I think the author is entering the air force in Aug. </br>  <br>It was red herring. Sakura is the bio mom. Kishi didn't have the balls</br>  <br>You mean the story where the girl's crush was someone she knew and who returns her feelings, and who wasn't always a emo douchebag?</br>  <br>more like shitty writing</br>  <br>So you're a neckbeard virgin who hasn't met a real woman before.</br>  <br> backstory isn't generic shoujoshit <br> then, it turn into generic shoujoshit in less than a tankoubon <br>Every shoujo</br></br></br>  <br><br> what's 50 Shades of Grey? <br>It's a trend and it will pass. What it read on that book is vanilla S&amp;M. They like it now because it's pictured like really good sex, but irl not every one would like it.<br><br> what's every Fabio-on-the-cover novel? <br>A short lived fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the source of many faps though</br>  <br> the actual story doesn't support my bias <br> t-the story doesn't matter.  <br><br>Top kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>her ass is decent.</br></br></br>  <br><br>the pain fight was great, but the anime completely ruined it with that liquid embarrassment they used for the animation.</br></br>  Backstabbing whore piece of shit.  <br>Forgot my pic.</br>   OP starts thread with naruto pic <br> this happens </br>  Absolutely obsessive, bordering on psychotic, and she absolutely just loses her shit when her not-quite-lesbian bff Euphie gets a new blowhole in her noggin. I really wish she had just been taken into a back room and had a bullet put in her head at the hotel jacking.  <br>Iris was fine.<br><br>Ash having gone through a lobotomy and Jessie/James/Meowth inexplicably becoming edgelords were what killed BW.</br></br></br>  Literally no one is worse than Claire. No one.  <br>Why is this even being argued over? Every girl in NGNL is equally shit.</br>  <br>/r9k/ pls. You can be a nice guy and still be dominant when the time is right, and this will net you a fucking heap of pussy lol.</br>    <br>are you f4cking kidding me?<br>wrong thread dude, best girl thread closed already</br></br>  <br>You're missing a lot of things if you only watched 5 episodes. You're review is destined to be incomplete.</br>  <br>Being obsessive and psychotic doesn't bug me, but dear god this girl was the most annoying thing I've ever seen. She is utterly repulsive. <br><br>It is beyond me how someone could like her.</br></br></br>  <br> Asahina <br> Not Sayaka fucking Maizono <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>The thread is now back on track.<br>I say Akane from Ranma 1/2 by the way is worst girl.</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty solid choice. She has few if any redeeming qualities and is annoying to watch.<br><br>I'll nominate... the sister from Sword Art Online. She just doesn't really do much and adds very little to the story. During her arc she's mostly irrelevant. After her arc it feels like she's there just because she was introduced and the author doesn't know how to put her away.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty standard reaction.<br>Hinata starts out weak, just a trope that appeals to nerds, but she has a crowning moment of awesome much, much, much later on.<br>Sakura will only continue grating on you as the series goes on, especially because she doesn't actually develop at all, she stays a dumb childish cunt that thinks she's mature and logical. It gets worse when she actually starts making huge, stupid mistake like an actual retard  like actually trying to join Sasuke right after he kills Danzo, the hokage, which almost gets her killed as well. <br>Sasuke's edge gets progressively sharper as the series goes on, and late into it you'll look back and go "oh shit, something went wrong, didn't it" and begin to realise that his motivations and logic don't really make a ton of sense.<br><br>Everybody likes Rock Lee, and for good reason. Too bad he eventually falls off of the face of relevancy, the author forgot about him like most other characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of Shippuden was actually pretty good overall, but holy shit do things suddenly hit the fan and take a nosedive toward the twin towers right at the end of the Pain arc.<br> Pain ressurecting everyone was very definitively the turning point of the series, where pretty much no events after that point are salvagable. </br></br>  <br> Hell, maybe do something with the whole illusion angle she was stated to be good at <br>Don't remind me about genjutsu. Fuck Kishi for actually introducing something he was too afraid to actually utilise because it was too complicated for him.<br>Genjutsu is clearly the most powerful style of jutsu, especially if you want to detain someone weaker than you, which would be a HUGE factor in a world run by ninjas. "Police brutality" would be a non issue, because a hostage just has to look in the cop's magic eyes and the situation is dealt with. Or play a fucking flute, you've won the battle.<br>I can't believe Kurenai got knocked up just so she didn't have to be expected to fight any more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>series would have been substantially better if it had ended right after the Pain arc.<br>about the only redeeming part later IMO was  Naruto getting to meet his mom .</br></br>  <br> Sakura <br> Feminism <br> any relation whatsoever <br>But how?<br>I'm sorry that landwhale weeaboos' first strong female character was Pinkshit because she a physically violent bitch that was unfair to everyone, but that means she inspired feminism for people? What the fuck!?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Back when Itachi and Kisame came back to the village in part 1 only to run into the jonin instructors I recall I was pretty hyped for a surreal, weird illusionist-on-illusionist combat. Then nothing came of it.<br>Then Sausage fought Itachi and the genjutsu there was a simple case of I-can-out-Matrix-you.<br>Disappointing as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Yup, Kishi had a good idea for genjustu, used that one idea, and then realised he didn't have any idea about how to write genjutsu.<br>If sharingan hadn't already been stated at that point to be fucking AWESOME at genjutsu, I'm pretty sure he would have tried even harder to just shelf the idea entirely. Too bad he already wrote that in, and he was fucking obsessed with the sharingan.</br></br>  <br>An amateur wikia poll who the fuck cares about that.</br>  <br>Guy going 8 Gates was also superb, too bad it was entirely invalidated by Madara healing it off pretty much immediately, and Naruto "saving" him from dying, thereby invalidating Guy's entire reason for living, his Springtime of Youth, damning him to a life in a wheelchair, never able to experience the rush of youth again, nor able to pave his way for the new generation in a blaze of glory.<br>I fucking hate Kishimoto so fucking much for ruining the crowning moment of Guy's life for literally no reason whatsoever. Naruto's magical revival hand power was never relevant or useful, Guy's life being saved had literally no benefits from a storytelling or character perspective, all of it was so stupid and pointless and Kishi is the biggest hack in the industry.</br></br>  Bitch.  <br> Still talking about Nardo. <br>Stop talking about Nardo fag.<br>And start talking about bitches like Rin and Houki from IS. Ichika is equally terrible so he deserves them though.</br></br></br>  Narutards truly are cancer.  This piece of shit.  <br>You're not contributing to the thread.</br>  <br>Please complain about a shit girl like manami.</br>  More like "cock-hungry slut"    <br>Why would anyone want to contribute to a shit thread started by a Narutard like yourself?</br>  <br>Because that's what it means to not be a shitposter like you.</br>  /thread  <br> Implying your existence as a Narutard isn't shitposting by default. </br>  <br>Yeah, discussing anime and manga on the anime and manga board isn't shitposting. Bitching about people liking things you don't is, though.</br>  <br> violent bitch that was unfair to everyone <br> inspired feminism for people <br><br>Checks out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's all Manami's fault, easily the worst girl, that doesn't make pink shit any better, she's still a huge piece of crap</br>  <br> Team Rocket becoming competent instead of blasting off after 5 seconds of dialogue is what killed the series  <br>Anon, please.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not the ugly cunt with the glasses who wanted Rosshit's dick.</br></br>  Seeing there's Alter Memory……<br><br>And if we go into the games, Celica A. Shitury 10,000 percent.</br></br>  Sakura's development through Part 1 was fine, but like everyone else in Part 2, Kishimoto had no idea what to do with her afterward.   Narutards <br>Both Hinata and Sakura are equally shit, get over yourselves. The entire series is garbage.</br>  <br>At no point in Part 1 did I think that Sakura should be a ninja. She was just dangerously weak. <br><br>Turning her into mini-Tsunade during the time-skip was a huge power up, but it was still a very limited and lazy skill set.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura's development through Part 1 was fine <br>She had development in part 1?<br>She had development?</br></br></br>  I could barely watch an episode without me not wanting to strangle this little cunt.  <br>She, like, cut her hair and everything. Girls cutting their hair means character development in anime.</br>  <br>Jeriya was also a best male character, considering how he was a good source of comical relief aswell as having a serious tone when needed. He also had a great back story, a very well developed character in this series, I would say. However I can't disagree that Shikimaru is one of the best, just wanted to point out another.</br>  This whiny little shit  <br>Hinata gets some cool moments right before she has the shit kicked out of her every single time</br>  <br>She'd crush your dick into oblivion with her gorilla strength grip.</br>  <br>The tone and armpits instantly make me say yes .</br>  <br>This one hurts me the most because I REALLY fucking like her design.</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that, Narutard.<br><br>Your threads are nothing but tumblrshit.<br><br>Get the fuck out of /a/ and back to the shithole where you belong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You really can tell when newfags post on /a/, even going as far as using spoilers for Naruto.</br></br></br>  I never understood her appeal.

Read Time Braid.</br>  <br><br><br>No one gives a a fuck Narutards about your fanfics and tumblr crap.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think about it: who was worse than Sakura in the elimination fights at the end of the Forrest of Death? Nobody.</br>  <br>Arguably Tenten, because she didn't get a single hit on Temari, but that was just her bad luck. If she went up against almost anyone else she probably would've won.</br>  <br>Thing is her mindrape specialisation should have knocked Pinkshit right out, they only tied for plot convenience.<br>Like Shikamaru her best asset is not some real offensive ability, but she did use it well.<br><br><br>Funny how Team 10, by far the weakest, has two characters who should have by all rights been promoted.<br>Team 8 had Shino, possibly Nardo should have been given a promotion (accessing fox chakra puts him in a league well above genin, used surprise tactics against Neji and most importantly took charge of a dangerous situation against Gaara and disabled an invasion force's key weapon) and the examiner said Sausage was on chuunin level - and the last two are the main protagonists of the show.<br>The outcome of the exam arc could have been a game changer in the team dynamics, entry for new missions and interesting shit, but instead we had to have the local edgelord defect and ruin the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually think the first few arcs of Shippuuden are better than just about anything in the first season.<br><br><br> not Inami </br></br></br></br>  <br> anon not reading the last chapter  <br>You should know good and well kishi wouldn't pull that shit anon</br></br>  <br> neckbeard virgin <br>How does it work out, living under false assumptions and spouting nonsense?</br></br>  <br> They like it now because it's pictured like really good sex, but irl not every one would like it. </br>  <br>Not that anon, but some fetishes can be described as fun, pleasant and interesting and get people curious/interested, but once they try it many of them might end up not liking it.<br>It's akin to how next to anything can with some skill be made alluring in 2D form.</br></br>  <br>well, Sakura is pretty shit. A complete waste of space and story focus. In fact, I can only thing of one I hate more.</br>  <br>I might accept that if Sakura's mental disorder was ever brought up again, but it was about as cheap and useful to decide a character's power ranking as Naruto farting in Kiba's face.</br>  <br>I am a girl, I like Sakura and I shipped Sakura x Naruto since it was obvious that she loved him a lot in shippuden. It's obvious they changed it on purpose because they wanted the MC to end up with some unrealistic male power fantasy / submissive sex toy "woman" (Hinata).</br>  Kill la Kill was a shit show to begin with, but it is astounding how many people ended up liking this cunt.    I wanted her to die in chapter one. I have never stopped wanting her to die.

It's laughable to see them so upset about her loving Sasuke, as if she wasn't slobbering over his dick since her first appearance.</br>  <br>In any other anime I'd be inclined to say that Manami was the worst girl by far, but Oreimo had Kirino. So Manami was only second worst in that show.</br>  <br>You're not the only one anon...you're not the only one</br>    Was Hiko the strongest character in the series?  <br>We know that Kenshin's no match whatsoever against Seijuurou. The one time he "won", it was because Seijuurou deliberately used Kuzuryusen. The only way that Kenshin could survive was if he used Amakakeru, which, as Seijuurou stated, was a hard counter against the Kuzuryusen. As long as Kenshin used the Amakakeru, he'd be able to beat the Kuzuryusen no matter what. This is what Seijuurou was deliberately gunning for.<br><br>But putting that aside, Kenshin is inferior to Seijuurou in every single way. Strength, speed, technique, talent, endurance. There is nothing that Kenshin can beat Seijuurou in.<br><br>Generally speaking, the reason Kenshin usually wins is due to two reasons: 1) he's one of the best at reading his opponents and 2) Hiten Mitsurugi is, without a doubt, the greatest of all Japanese sword arts in Rurouni Kenshin's universe. No one's techniques are better. Even if Seta was faster, even if Shishio was overall superior, even if Enishi had super-nerves, they were all inferior to Kenshin in terms of swords style. And Seijuurou is the absolute master of the Hiten Mitsurugi, above Kenshin. Not only is does he have greater mastery of the style, but he's vastly superior in every single stat and he's not bound by Kenshin's whole "no-kill" rule either. He has all of Kenshin's strengths multiplied by two or three times and none of his weaknesses.<br><br>If a handicapped Kenshin is able to beat Shishio and Enishi, then Seijuurou should be able to demolish them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay, that just shows you never read the damn Manga.<br><br>Hiko's feats for the Japanese Government are as great if not greater than Kenshin's, that's why he got his land and total freedom to choose in participate in power struggles.<br><br>Hiko is stronger than Kenshin for the simple fact his body has reached such a pinacle that the Hiten Mitsurugi will never cripple him, unlike Kenshin whose abilities will rust tremendously with time, the Gaiden where he passed his sword on flat out confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We know that Kenshin's no match whatsoever against Seijuurou. <br>No True Scotsman Fallacy. Begging the Question.</br></br>  <br>Because his stats and techniques are superior? Despite what you seem to believe, accomplishments aren't the end-all measure of strengths. <br><br>If I could bench-press a mountain but never showcased that talent to anyone, would that somehow make me weaker?</br></br></br>  <br> Hiko's feats for the Japanese Government are as great if not greater than Kenshin's </br>  What's her angle?  <br>Damn those curves</br>  Whens momoka    <br>Never.<br><br>It's time to let the dream die, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Hope never dies</br>  <br>what the fuck is with the "go get checked by a dr any time you get even slightly injured" trope<br>do they really do this or is it just anime bullshit?</br></br>  <br> just anime bullshit? <br>No. Unless your country's health care is a joke of course</br></br>  <br>Even in my 3rd World shithole country, in my office; when someone gets papercut with a case of visible bleeding, we send them to the company nurse/clinic. It's just simple disinfecting and bandaging or whatnot. Shit is just standard procedure.<br><br>You seem to be under the impression that "getting checked by a doctor" = "getting a formally scheduled appointment". A doctor worth half a shit wouldn't mind just checking out minor injuries and treating them if necessary. <br><br>What kind of craptastic healthcare have you been experiencing till now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah we have a lot of walk-in free clinics where you can go get stitches, warts removed, antibiotics prescription etc etc but going for scrapes and bruises is pretty excessive</br>  <br>346 is a big company. <br><br>I imagine the healthcare benefits are amazing. And remember, their primary assets are their idols. They need to take everything seriously. Even things as simple as scratches.</br></br></br>  <br> MishirOjou <br> Angle </br></br>  <br>Don't they got spas and beauty clinics on the compound?</br>  Who /puchiderella/ here?  <br>If a clinic refuses to treat someone on the basis of their injuries being "too light" then they have no right to continue functioning as a clinic.<br><br>As long as there aren't any other patients requiring more immediate attention, there is nothing wrong with entertaining patients with "minor" injuries.<br><br>And look at the comic, Anzu had a big cut that eventually ended up staining her gloves with blood. It's probably nothing that serious, but she really should get that patched up properly with disinfectants and bandages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> cakem@ster <br> giving her voice <br>Never.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting on that Anya and Nino Puchi god damn it.</br>  <br>Meh</br>  <br>TakeP: I wanna produce her EGAO</br>  You will never be the subject of Mayu's love. <br><br>I bet she even deepthroats on the first date.</br></br>  <br> cakem@ster <br>the only relevant ages are 15-18.<br>I blame those hagswarm posters for pushing their cakefaggotry.</br></br></br>  <br>All relevant girls or big shots are mature looking or outright adults.</br>  CRIME TIME<br>R<br>I<br>M<br>E<br><br>T<br>I<br>M<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally who cares.</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br>only KWSM and Kaede have been the only established idols that are past 18.<br>the rest of that group are around 17 and a loli.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, delusional LLfag.

Regardless, they still look far better than LL's sameface uguu-eye character designs. Now go wallow in your shit taste somewhere else, because you aren't wanted here.</br></br>  <br>Why would I want that?</br>  <br> where are you getting at <br>Jesus Christ you can't even into official site measurements, or wikipedia for human average sizes?<br> LL's sameface uguu-eye character designs <br>I could say the same shit for Im@s if I really wanted to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anya and Rin's sizes are below average for their height.<br>And probably average in CG.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, you're right, if anyone is attracted to girls who are under cake age, they should be castrated, noted.</br>  <br>Height is also an important factor, and it's not like they are small in bust area either.</br>  <br>A sharp chin</br>  <br>I remember there was a BMI-like chart for height and bust size, Anya and Rin are below their expected bust size in relation to their height, Mika was the only one with the perfect proportions in relation to the 80cm bust size.</br>  If I told her fellatio was cool &amp; rock, would Riina buy it?  So I'm finally watching the anime for hyperdimension neptunia because I've been seeing a ton of popularity from it.<br><br>But I never see /a/ talk of it, is it because people only like the game?</br></br>  <br> But I never see /a/ talk of it, </br>  I was going to try the game out but the animation looks like CG ass, why couldnt at least the side story parts be in 2D  <br>Question<br>would I be lost if I start from the most recent game or do I seriously need to play from the beginning</br></br>  So, I finally started playing Re:Birth 1 after never playing any of the series before.<br>I've gotten to chapter 3 and how does one know how all these fucking systems work?<br>Also, when MAGES. and TEKKEN are saying they're from another dimension, do they mean they're from the original version of the game?</br></br>  <br><br>Where did those measurements come from?<br><br><br><br>They're just dimension hoppers/4th wall breakers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those scales are fucking awful. Somebody tell the person who made it that 3 centimeters is not half of someone's entire head</br>  <br>waifu material reporting in</br>  NEVER FORGET<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iYz<wbr>x-eHN-Zc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>This fucking ED made me want the game.</br>    <br> HERE WE GO<br>WAY TO GO~</br> </br>  <br>whats so special about it?<br>serious question<br>I watched the whole thing<br>If your talking about the boob thing you are seriously fucking new</br></br></br></br>  <br>No not really.<br>Technically each game is kinda its own separate thing but still ties in with the others. And they always give a small summary of the past games for those catching up. <br><br><br>Honestly I hold Neptunia as being one of the smartest shows when it comes to its humor.<br>But unfortunately unless you're an avid gamer and know a lot about events that happened in the industry, almost all of the jokes will completely fly over you or not make any sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, I've watched this 10 times in a row now.<br>How the hell do I stop?<br><br> Starting 11th loop now </br></br></br></br>  <br>  know a lot about events that happened in the industry <br>context on that?</br></br>  <br>Say hello to the sunbeams for me</br>  <br>It's cute.<br>The song is endearing. <br>The characters are Cute AND Soft.<br><br> And you're the new one if you even had to seriously ask that question. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And you're the new one if you even had to seriously ask that question. <br><br>literally every anime with fan service displays the same images here in this ED <br>I'm implying you're new because you must have not seen too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Send Help</br>  <br>Well for example in one of the episodes Nepgear (sega/gamegear) was snuggling in Vert(microsoft/Xbox) tits and was entranced by them and wanted to "become hers".<br><br>It may looks like something stupid on the outside, but in actuality was was poking fun at about how Sega almost sold itself out to Microsoft by becoming an exclusive partner during the early 2000s when the xbox first launched.</br></br></br>  <br> literally every anime with fan service displays the same images here in this ED <br> I'm implying you're new because you must have not seen too much. <br><br>Freezing's EDs were far too sexual.<br>Same for DxD.<br>Color Wars was close, but the song wasn't as great.<br>Maburaho's ED was an insult to it's OP.<br>Wandaba Style had the same problem as Maburaho.<br>Have you even seen Cutie Honey?<br>Or Shuffle! for that manner?<br>Vandread's ED Theme wasn't as good as the visuals. <br><br> Seriously, learn to critique. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> boobs literally giggling up close in your face <br> more lewd than a soft core still image of Bridgette <br><br>how old are you? also the rest of those examples are shit if youre trying to imply they are more erotic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the hell are you even talking about?<br><br>If you can't differentiate between what is cute and what is lewd, how can you be expected to talk about it?</br></br></br>  <br> huge boobs giggling up close <br> "OMG guyz itss just CUTE totally not lewd or sexual!!1!" </br></br>  <br>You do realize you need to be 18+ to be on this website, don't you?</br>  <br>good comeback anon<br>I like how your defense on why youre right relates to my last post</br></br>  <br>I've been playing rebirth1, and I'm finding myself a little less fond of the anime.<br><br>I think I've been playing too long already, dat Iris Heart, hot freaking damn, I cannot get enough of her voice even though I only occasionally like HanaKana characters.</br></br></br>  <br> (Sega/Gamegear) <br>Nep is supposed to be the Sega Neptune, a Genesis + 32X console to make the whole process of hooking up a genesis and 32X less annoying (the 32X used a different power source than the genesis and need to be hooked up by video cables into the genesis besides sitting on top of its cartridge port)<br><br>Sega dropped it because by the time it was fully developed, the Sega Saturn was ready to be shipped<br><br>SoA was planning to call the unit Genesis32X in western markets due to not even knowing SoJ was going into planet names for their next console line (The Sega Saturn, The Sega Neptune and the Sega Pluto)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HanaKana fucking sucks.</br></br>  The game is a million times better. Though Peashy is an evil baby and unlikeable.   But I never see /a/ talk of it <br>Lurk more.</br>  I hope Vert gets an imouto in the next game. Hololens, maybe?  <br>End your life immediately.</br>  <br><br>But they're all handhelds.</br></br>  <br> Neptune and Blanc are literally dick height <br>guess they're the perfect size for the only thing they're good at</br></br>    <br>Neppy-chan is olev, blasphemer!</br>  <br>Zune?</br>  <br>That's not a gaming device.</br>  Is White Heart built for sex?  NEPU  <br>The others are. She's built for cuddling.</br>  <br>Your last post was infantile. <br>So was this one, actually.</br></br>  Hey /a/ I've upgraded your IF<br><br><br>It's hard to discuss Neptunia without also talking about the game; however, I once got banned from /a/ for 24 hours when I posted an image from the game, because it's "not anime/manga", so there's also that.</br></br></br>  <br>Kinect could be a cousin</br>  <br>Nope</br>  I heard the development studio is made up mostly of females?  <br>Almost certainly not mostly, but the director and character designer are.</br>  <br>All neps are<br> WH is perfect though </br></br>  <br>It's kind of garbage. It basically takes the shitty story from the game and erases 50% of the humor and adds a bit too much drama. Nep is cute though.</br>  <br><br>I've been playing rebirth 1 too, and I'm mainly surprised how well the anime managed to capture the characters and spirit of the game. I expected the real deal to be different.</br></br>  <br>AS if Iffy needed to be upgraded<br>It's pretty much settled that if we lower the game discussion to minimum the hotpocket master won't delete it</br></br>   turn on English voices in game <br>Never again.</br>  I want to ravage Nep's sexy little body.  <br> English voices in a weabo game <br> ever <br><br>Why not Blanc's?</br></br></br></br>  <br> weabo game <br>I hope you're not implying that these games were made for weeaboos.</br></br>  <br>I liked Nep's voice.</br>  <br>It is though. I don't see why it's not.</br>  <br>Are you serious? Do you browse /v/ too? The games were made for otaku and then localized a time after. Nobody thought they would take off in the west.</br>  <br>Back then? Yeah it was like that, now it has quite a big fanbase in the west</br>  <br>Still, the games are primarily made for otaku. Do you think anime is made for weeaboos too?</br>  <br> now it has quite a big fanbase in the west <br>That's not true at all. The first game sold by far the most of any in the series and that was due to the gimmick of console wars but western interest has declined to be about equal with Jap interest.<br>To illustrate that the first game is still the best selling of them all, despite being considered shit by nearly everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll have you know that Rebirth 2 is extremely popular in the Vatican City.</br>  <br><br>Sex with Nep would be awkward as fuck. Just imagine her comments.</br></br>  <br>People from IF/CH said a few times they have big fanbase in the west, they said so last time they were talking about a "suprise" collab and it was also why they started porting to PC</br>  <br> You took the bait! <br> My body is ready <br> Come and nepnep my nep <br> Gimme your pudding <br> NEPUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i was certain i read every nep doujin out there</br>  <br>You probably did but were too busy nepping to remember</br>  <br>Each game is generally it's own universe and pretty unconnected. I just played rebirth 1&amp;2</br>  <br>Well these are the games that aren't actually connected, the rest of mainline games? They kinda are<br>RB3 starts in the same dimension as RB2, then Nepnep gets thrown to the other dimension, then comes back in the ending and VII is again in RB2 dimension</br></br>  <br>Does MAGES. ever come back?

All except MAGES. felt incredibly forced in and I'm not even sure if they should have been there at all. It's like they didn't even try to make them interesting and thought referencing something would be enough.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's no one that wants to play vita games but doesn't want to play it on a shitty overpriced handheld console.</br>  <br>I think this was more a problem in 2 than in 1.

I got an -A/A one time and I found out a fly landed on it once.</br>  <br>that's cum mixed with vaginal fluids for you</br>  Anyone else have a Billy/Oxberg setup?<br>It seems to me that it would fit maybe 3 figures per windowed segment before looking overly cluttered.<br>It's definitely not the most cost efficient space.<br>Anyone else have photos of their collections in a Billy? I would like to see one filled up.</br></br></br>  <br>My virgin mind wouldn't know.</br>  <br>Should have gone with Morliden doors.</br>  <br>A is not guaranteed to be new, read again the disclaimer.</br>  <br><br>I would get it, but that face, it doesn't look right in any of the promo pics.</br></br>  <br>do you know if they ship to latin-america?</br>  <br>Yeah I didn't even know that variant existed when I bought it, otherwise I probably would have.</br>  <br>go check</br>  <br>Not my picture but you can see how much better the Morliden doors look.</br>  <br>Yeah I can definitely agree.<br>It's not worth it to me to go and buy the doors considering they're like $55 each and I already paid the $180 for the Oxberg variant.<br>I'll just need to see how it comes along when I start to fill it in more.</br></br></br>  <br>The Oxberg doors do not look bad, it just sucks on how much real estate you lose down the middle.<br>For a smaller collection it should be fine.</br></br>      <br>so cramped</br>      <br>Yeah I measured, it's like half an inch on each side and about 3 and a half inches in the middle.<br><br>I'll definitely be looking into the glass doors and glass shelves.<br>Maybe I'll be able to sell the doors, they're also listed on IKEA's site for $55.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Terrible.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for a umaru hamster hoodie.</br>    <br><br>worst meme character this year</br></br>  <br>Your face is the worst meme this year.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off hipster.</br></br>  <br> worse than Hestia <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Literal shit.</br>  <br>You know what this face looks like?<br><br>It looks like maridah as saber. Not saber. With those really spread eyes and weird mouth and button nose.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything that's not listed here is probably delayed because Wonfest is next week.<br><br>I got a message stating that Satsuki Senketsu was both coming out on the 31st and also delayed to August. So I assume the website is correct.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta have some sort of difference from all the other saber figs</br>  <br>That's actually the first scale though in that iconic pose. Would have been different enough.</br>  <br>How is Hestia a meme in the slightest?</br>  <br>IKEA actually has a 90 day return window, not a 30 day, so I'll just return them and buy Morlidens.<br><br>They look considerably better, losing no display space on the sides and only maybe an inch in the middle. I'm still not 100% sold on keeping the wooden shelves though.</br></br></br>  <br>Room is kind of dark so not a very good picture.<br>May as well continue the collection posts from last thread.</br></br>  <br> Delayed from July 2015 to September 2015: <br> Penguin Parade - Miyuki Shiba <br><br>My dear imouto is delayed????</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think I recognise you from /toy/. You got another doll to go with Makoto? Display still looks great.</br></br>  My dusty ass shelves as of a little while ago. (actually not that dusty, wierdly, since this place is old as shit).<br><br>Spot the shame piece(s).</br></br>  <br>I have my figures sitting out in the open collecting dust</br>  <br>That honestly looks atrocious.</br>  <br>In what way?</br>  <br>Jesus</br>  <br>Are there any figures of girl wearing panties on head?</br>  <br><br>The clutter.</br></br>  <br>It's just a mess with figures just all over the place and posters are tacky as fuck. Looks like a 13 year old's room.</br>  <br> cropped <br>Complete image plz</br></br>  <br>You need more shelves and risers.</br>  <br>Not mine, but this picture gives a clear view of the Billy/Morliden combo with glass shelves.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think having a room full of figures looks 13 year old enough.</br>  <br>Morliden looks more like a store display than a homely display cabinet. <br><br>Oxberg glass door looks really warm and welcoming for a small display in your home.</br></br></br>  <br>A lot.<br>Get a Nendoroid Kuroko and every nendoroid can be a figure with panties on head.</br></br>    <br>I hope those don't come unbalanced. I can see bending.</br>  <br><br>No. having a room full of badly placed and all over the place shit makes it look like 13 years old room.</br></br>  <br>Morliden doesn't really look like a 'display cabinet' at all, in my opinion. Hard to explain, but it looks more like a storage cabinet, or like you said, a store display.</br>    <br>Are those fucking tupperware risers on the bottom?</br>  <br>Yeah it's definitely a clutter, I have a good 30 odd figures still in box because of that. The other side has this set of shleves, slightly less cluttered, since it's kinda hard to clutter the 1/7's anyway, But also because I got sick of cluttering them. I am short on cash at the moment so I haven't been able to make use of the rest of my room so I could spread them out a bit.<br><br><br>Can't really make more shelves, those shelves are as small as they'll be without removing some of the bigger ones like the Tomo with the bow.<br>As said though, bit short on cash so haven't had a chance to grab risers, a KALLAX and a DETOLF for the free corner, which would free up a fair bit of room to spread em.<br><br><br>Nah it's fine, they have a 60kg loading weight for each beam. And the slightl bend you see on the left side there is from the speaker which counter balances when it touches the wall and from the speaker in the middle.<br><br><br>Okay mate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I am playing on covering them though. Couldn't find any risers deep enough.</br>  <br>100% agreed. Same reason I got those doors for mine. The Oxberg doors just fit into a living space better.<br><br>If I had a house big enough to have an entirely separate "recreation room" or something the Morliden might be okay.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly yes. I didn't plan ahead and give myself the option to move the shelves around because of the lights so I have to cramp both together.</br>  <br>Morliden looks clean and crisp, and Oxberg looks like it would house something older and more quaint like crockery or something.<br><br>Different strokes I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice to see another person with the lotto C.C. fig.</br>   so many decent looking collections <br>I'm impressed, I figured you guys would all have shit that looked like </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Ma I just don't have the space or money to go with one of these or I would, I'm sick of dust a day after i clean if I'm lucky.<br><br>Heck there's not even a Ikea in my country and these cabinets are ungodly expensive last I checked</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry bro, I forgot to cling wrap my shelves.</br>  <br><br>Some people actually take care of the hundreds of dollars they spend.</br></br>  <br>hmmmm that's a mighty fine Kos-Mos.</br>  <br><br>this clutter is why of the main reasons why i have so little figures after my few years of buyfagging now</br></br>  <br>Curious, would you think that would look better with just the white walls behind?</br>  <br>Yes. Posters are tacky as fuck. It wouldn't help the clutter though.</br>  <br> not swapping figures are so you have variety </br>  <br>Comparatively, yes. <br><br>The figures themselves would still need to be spread out some or at the very least, organised in some way to really improve it overall though.</br></br></br>  <br>I use videogame cases as risers too, at least till I get some decent shelves.</br>  <br><br>Might be a fundamental difference of opinion there. I think the plain white would look pretty tacky. I mean, if it were a patterned wall, some type of wallpaper, or tiles or a clear brick pattern, etc.. then whatever. <br>But a plain white wall, that looks boring as, in photos is might look a bit ugly, but definitely looks better in reality, when you have the benefit of depth perception and such.<br><br>I agree though, the clutter is clutter, no argument there.</br></br></br></br></br>  I found my grail on solarisjapan, but can't see any info on them when I ctrl+f in the guide, are they legitimate?  <br>I definitely like the Oxberg better when they're being used liked this. You have one in each, two in some,and you could fit a third with a riser depending on the size of the figures and how you want to configure it without it looking cluttered. You need to close the doors up some, though.</br>  <br>My only problem with them is that the viewing angles are pretty shit</br>  <br><br>They're legit, but overpriced as shit. <br><br>MFC has a link of shops with reviews:<br><br>http://myfigurecollection.net/shop/<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more about what's already in your room already. If your room looks like a normal carpeted white walled room, then probably morliden will look awfully out of place. The total look of your room matters farm more than which display looks best by itself or whichever one you think looks best.<br><br>If you have a bunch of wood grain furniture and a bed in your room, and then you buy a black billy with morliden doors because you think it looks cool in the store, your collection will probably look like the /v/ shit we see here so frequently. <br><br><br> would white wall look better than a bunch of tacky fold out posters that haven't even been ironed out or mounted? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could also check the archive to see previous discussion on them. Their prices are a bit over the top and that their pre owned items are risky even at 4.5 stars.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's hard to have perspective, maybe i'll take some photos in the future once i've de-cluttered, and also give some perspective on my room. The photo was taken from my door, which no one really views any of this from.<br><br><br> Posters <br>As was said, seems to be a difference of opinion, I think anything is better than plain white walls personally. I would rather spear dog shit behind the shelves than leave the walls bare.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>WWhy do people in Buyfag threads have such entrylevel/pleb taste?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice mustard bro</br>  <br><br>I found the link via the MFC page, and the price is actually very good for my currency, everywhere else is scalpertown in comparison.<br><br>The Figure quality is 5/5 but I'm a little suspect now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it seems you think everyone has pleb taste, never considered the opposite?</br>    <br>Na, I don't buy figures of seasonal waifushit and series that everyone on /r/anime adores. It's like you guys watched a few series a stopped there, never branching out.</br>  <br>Because the ones with the guts to show off their collections have different taste<br>So what you think is master race is for NEET plebs</br></br>  <br><br><br>Post your collection, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>You know that they don't make figures for your snowflakes tastes most of the time right?</br>    <br><br> there are people like this keeping your grail hostage </br></br>  dess dess~  <br>S1 training outfits never.</br>  <br>Flat colour walls are a regular part of interior design.<br><br>The shelves and the things on the shelves are what accent that area of the room. The blank wall is the negative space around the figures that lets you appreciate the shapes of the figures and stops the room from feeling cluttered and small.<br><br>Posters on walls look like complete shit, ESPECIALLY when there's no uniformity in size or positioning and just amount to visual noise.<br><br>As said before, it looks like a child's room.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do some people think anime should be all about the quantity you watch rather than just finding stuff you enjoy?</br>  <br>You're mistaken. It's not that you have something covering your walls. It's what you chose to cover your walls with. <br><br>To some people, like myself, creased magazine posters are the equivalent of speared dog shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That's true for some series, but there quite a few that have a few decent figures. It's about quality over quantity. <br><br><br>Na, most "NEET plebs" have awful taste. They're the ones that buy seasonal waifushit and trash like Pochacho.</br></br></br></br>  <br>best best*</br>  <br> quantity <br>Not sure how you're getting that from me. If anything, quality over quantity is what I advocate. The problem is that so few people make it past the surface of what's out there.</br></br>  <br><br>What's the figure?</br></br>  <br> Koukawa Asuka <br>My Taimaninfu</br></br>  <br>That still sounds gross to sleep with or hug.</br>  <br>What in that is your grail?<br><br><br>Again, fundamental difference of opinion. Uniformity isn't everyone's idea of "looks good".<br><br><br>Can't imagine much else that would look decent on walls. Outside of plastering a big line of uniform posxpos poster packs across each shelf, which I think would look only slightly better than plain walls.<br><br>On a side note;<br>You guys don't design your setups for other people, do you? Just seems that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you put the books on the bottom shelf because the shelves tip forward without nailing them to the wall?</br>    <br>This was such a stupid choice. Still can't believe it doesn't come with the hair bow.<br><br>It was already sold on CR too. No one bought it. Check how many people actually ordered it on mfc, huge flop.</br></br></br>  <br>Not everything gets a figure, so your choices are rather limited on a larger scale. Also muh opinions.</br>  <br> What in that is your grail? <br>Tsukihi.</br></br>  Great tapestry design on an overpriced weeb shirt.<br><br>Every time, cospa.</br></br>  <br>Ordered her preowned off Ami just yesterday. Though it was the original colour scheme, not the alternate one.</br>  <br>This. Most of my favorite series don't get any figures</br>  <br> weeb shirt <br>Why do people say this? The shirt isn't for people in the west.</br></br>  <br>Just infiltrated cospa HQ and steal their .psd files on a usb.</br>  <br>Because us buying it makes it a weeb shirt.</br>  <br> buying shirts </br>  <br>Define "seasonal waifu" please.<br><br>Also, if you like a character, or a set of characters, or just like the figures, would you not get them because they fit the "seasonal waifu" criteria?<br><br>If so, I consider you pretty stupid. Labeling things this or that arbitrarily based on the the popularity or otherwise. Then refering to that exact same thing when buying your own collection, you seem to care what they think, while simultaneously not caring. Seems all too neurotic, to be honest.<br><br>I mean, there are plenty of reasons to buy a figure;<br>I watched Samurai Girls, I didn't really like the series, the characters were a little fun, but mostly it was badly written and hard to enjoy. However, the character designs themselves were awesome (to me).<br>That's the only reason I have those figs, not for any "seasonal flavour" bullshit.<br><br>Hell, my "waifu" doesn't even have a figure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   SUKI IT? GET IT! <br>I'm not going to be using your store again.</br>  I'mtrying to buy one of the new PS4s through Amazon.jp, but Big In Japan's FAQ says not to order things with lithium batteries. How the hell do I get one? I always just assumed you could buy consoles with an American credit card and have them forwarded.<br><br>inb4 /v/, I really want to try out some JP-exclusive games.</br></br>  <br>Kahotan in 2 hours. <br><br>What's a good screenshotting program, that isn't fraps? Wish there was an internal windows one.</br></br></br>  can you guys help me?<br><br>I cannot find the guide</br></br>  <br>You are probably better off going to /vg/ and ps4 is region free you dingus</br>  <br>puush</br>  <br>Had to google that, brief imagesearch it seems like Idolshit? is that what seasonal waifu is?<br>If so I don't know why the original poster quoted my images, I have none of that shit.</br></br>  <br>I wish I could go back in time to warn my past self not to read your offtopic blogshit.</br>  <br><br>There's no region lock on PS4</br></br>  <br>Just use N-Y, it's cheaper.<br><br>I use ShareX for puush, since puush likes to force jpg/png at whim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well she was a good choice, though I can't imagine she was a cheap one.</br></br>  <br> I use ShareX for puush, since puush likes to force jpg/png at whim. <br>There's a setting for this. The default uses jpg unless png is smaller in filesize, but you can change it to never compress its files.</br></br>  <br>That fact that you thought that show was worth watching in the first says more about your taste than anything, not to mention that you liked the designs.</br>  <br>Seems cool, but also way intrusive. I don't want to skip the middleman. Would rather upload myself.</br>  <br>Not him, but I'm pretty sure "seasonal waifus" are when newfags and cancer switch waifus every season rather than sticking to one.</br>  <br>Don't read it! It's offtopic blogshit!</br>  <br>My tastes aren't anal, and I enjoyed it 'enough' to watch the 2nd season. Doesn;'t mean I think it was good, or even thought it would be good. A few things I saw made me think the animation/fight scenes might be good, but alas that was the main disappointment with the series, didn't even really bring that despite the terrible state of the rest of the story.</br>  <br>Oh there we go, judging people from 1 example. Might want to hang up your bible, you've graduated to choir boys, mate.</br>  <br> actually replying to that cop-out <br>He's just a newfag shitposting. You can't watch a decent amount of anime without occasionally watching a show that is bad but still enjoyable for tangential reasons.</br></br>  WHEN'S SAYLA MASS  You guys think that if I e-mail Manda they'll sell me the Sansei Muramasa extra body part from Amakuni by itself? I bought the figure from them before they Amakuni actually started distributing the extra bodies, so they gotta have at least a single extra one laying around.  <br>If you have taste, something like Samurai Girls isn't even going to appear on your radar for series that might be worth watching.</br>  <br><br>Well, I e-mailed them in Japanese and made it real easy for them, even attached this picture.<br><br>Hope they can sell me just the body, if not I'm gonna have to buy the bleeding figure again.</br></br></br></br>  KIMI DAKE WOOO <br>KIMI DAKE WOOOOOOOOOO</br>  TACHIAGARE KEDAKAKU MAE SADAME WO UKETA SENSHI YO  DAAAAAAKEEEEDOOOOOOOO  OHIIISAMAA WA MITEIRUUU  KIMI TO  KIMI TO  NATSU NO OWARI SHOURAI NO YUME   KOTAE WA DOKO AAAAAAYEAAAHYEAAAH  <br>N  ISHO GA ICHIBAN </br>  JIBUN   we <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uf2<wbr>iaLKYpcM</wbr>  [ ]  SUN WILL RISE<br>CLOSE YOUR EYES</br>  I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW  YOU ARE MY FRIEND!!!!!!!!  <br>JINGO FINGO TERYAKI NISSAN HONDA SUSHI KAWASAKI GIRUUUUUUUGAMESH</br>  KIMI DAYO<br>KIMI NANDAYO</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XGt<wbr>1sW6-s48</wbr>  [ ]</br>  KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YEEEEEEEEEE YEEEEEEEEEEEE  NOW I'VE LOST IT  NEE IMA DOUSHITE BOKURA UMARETA NO  <br>DOWNFALLEN</br>  <br>NEE IMA DOUSHITE BOKURA DEATTA NO</br>    ATARASHI MIRAI SHAININGUDORO  <br>WOOOOOO</br>  ANO KO GA KINOU NANKA SUGOKU YASASHIKUTE  SOMEONE WAN WAN  KILL MY WEAKNESS WEAKNESS  It's trying hard but not reaching the mark that the previous Aquarions have set. Still no insert songs either but we get a little girl instead. Thank the heavens for gattai.  <br>There's still more to be had though. They're still doing two person gattai's. The potential is there, just gotta hope it reaches it.</br>  <br>If they ever do a three person gattai. Hoping there will be an insert song when that happens.<br><br>The show started off very slow but it's gotten a lot better over the course of the last two episodes. The comedy is there, the unique character personalities but it's still lacking. There's still a ways to go so hopefully it continues to improve in the areas that are lacking. At least the BGM for the battle this time around was nice.</br></br></br>  <br>The insert songs are gone. Face it, we got used to the NANDEMO NANDEMO and dogeza giant robot.<br>Now its all gone. Now its all just an anime in logos and all the fun we wanted is gone.</br></br>  <br>Can I call it Aquarion Budget now? Because everything seems so low quality.</br>  Is the loli worth picking it up for?  There is a reason no one talked about this. Now you realize why after suffering through 3 episodes. Just let it go.  <br>I wouldn't pick it up solely for her. There's a large cast and since there's only been two character gattai's so far, it's likely she won't get as much screentime as one would like.<br><br>But there are a few good scenes with her in the one episode she's in so far.</br></br></br>  <br>It dropped a lot of bullshit from the previous seasons while keeping the eccentricity. The staff feels much more in charge of what they are doing than with the previous ones.</br>  right now it's basically aquarion in name only<br><br>i wouldn't be surprised if some amazing bullshit happens to connect it, though. Master seems like the kind of dickhead Fudo has become in a post-EVOL world.<br><br>so far nobody has been as grating as Amata and Mikono.</br></br></br></br>  ITT soft girls   come to soft thread expecting soft <br> get soft <br>Sasuga.</br></br>  <br> search Maybe and Yuuko on sadpanda <br> no results </br></br>    <br>Mai waifu is the softest.</br>  ABSOLUTE SOFTEST  Choose your woman.  <br>Saeko is just the right amount of crazy.<br>Saeko &gt; Pink &gt; Nurse &gt; Loli &gt; Roach</br></br>  Takagi, all day every day.  <br>Because the author of Freezing is Korean.
