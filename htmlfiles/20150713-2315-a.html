[ Is there an anime version of True Detective? it doesn't HAVE to be about detectives but that's a plus. I liked eerie creepy vibe of the show, Rust and his philosophies, and also realistic, and also that it was depressing in a way.  TD is entertainment level television at best. <br><br>Art:<br>The Sopranos <br>Deadwood<br>Mad Men<br><br>Journalism:<br>The Wire<br><br>Schlock:<br>True Detective<br>Breaking Bad<br>Game of Thrones<br>The Shield<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128013998#p128018545">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   banned for asking if there's an anime version to Gulliver's Travel's <br>Thanks for still being fucking retards mods.</br>  <br> deadwood will never be finished <br> there will never be anime/manga deadwood <br><br>Sometimes i'm wondering why i live when i've already experienced the greatest thing ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> asking for recommendations </br>  <br>It wasn't asking for a recommendation.<br>It was actually just a yes or no question.</br></br>  What does it take for an anime or manga to be labeled as "edgy".<br><br>Is it simply because violence is present or is there something more to it?</br></br>    <br>People enjoying hurting/abusing/killing others. Also gratuitous depictions of violent acts.</br>  The way /a/ uses edgy is when the portrayal of such violence is not only shallow, but also glorified for a coolness factor in a way that appeals to teenagers who think they're the shit for watching it.<br><br>However, the actual definition of edgy doesn't really have to be negative. It literally just means pushing boundaries.</br></br>  <br>What did you think of Gangsta's first episode?</br>  <br>It's edgy if it's not moeshit</br>  Top this.  <br>I remember</br>  <br> daijoubu </br>  <br>The most iconic anime death.</br>  <br>Easy.</br>  <br>But magician can't die.</br>  So NT13 getting translated when?  <br>your right anon, it doesn't help the fact theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit.<br>even if she just had the idol theory crap from the crossover she could very well get her powers back that way.<br>finally i'm fairly convinced huginn and muninn are fucking around somewhere in an alternate phase, probably gonna show up sometime soon.</br></br></br>  <br> theres a pretty good chance othinus has been faking the whole having no powers bullshit <br>Now THAT's a good plot twist.</br></br>  <br>the thing is NT 12 pretty much hints about it, 1% of infinite is still infinite after all.</br>  <br><br>also why is anti touma comig after her if she supposedly lose her powers?<br><br>She is suspicious</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> anti-touma is coming <br> Othinus has intel that she will (eventually be defeated) but she knows that Touma could combat this threat <br> lay low <br>Well that's one hell of an interesting theory.</br></br></br></br></br>  What's going to happen to her /a/?<br>Why is she being made out to be the underdog?<br>Why did the anime skip over and downplay every scene that indicated 8man likes her?<br>How will she fix her self esteem issues?<br>What were 8man's intentions when he asked her out?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess they can't afford Ebina ova.</br></br>  <br>best girl</br>  I want to have Gahamama as my mother in law.  <br>It's a cliche character Beta Charlotte.<br>Four-Eye-of-Shit-kun is a bete cliche character who serves the comic relief to the series, the tipicio friend estupito and idiot protagonist.<br>It plays the same role as Sunohara had the Clanned, he's the idiot and stupid friend of the protagonist<br>It images from the sidelines is the shit he does, he destroys and bother people.<br> is called in Japan and 2ch/net of Four-Eye-of-Shit-kun or Sunohara 2.0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, copied.<br><br>Would reuse in another thread.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MDx<wbr>Sz1utjzA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Is there anything better?</br></br></br>  <br>You must be joking. AB opening had a shit-ton of useless still frames and disgusting 5 fps CG backgrounds.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gqx<wbr>m--Wq82Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>   You  <br><br>Agreed</br></br>  <br>Do people really like it? Personally I find the OP and ED really don't suit the series at all, though I can't really think of a good suggestion to replace it.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zh5<wbr>6H_QKnow</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Would you accept her contract /a/?  <br>Once the love of his life dies he becomes more and more unlikable.</br>  <br> Lelouch has a vast amount of followers <br> Eventually takes over the whole world <br> Sister loves him <br> C.C loves him <br> Kallen loves him <br> Suzaku loves him <br><br>Yeah about that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>he's dead</br></br>  <br> It's been almost a decade <br>FUCCCKKKKK</br></br>  <br>No, because with my luck my Geass would be the power to turn people into Fridges.</br>  The To Love Ru Darkness Chapter 57 is out  <br>Risa is overrated and also a disgusting dyke,might as well have a chapter with 38 white pages.</br>  <br>Otaku are truly the shittiest target audience in the world.<br> no fun allowed because of waifufags and MUH PURITY <br> MC has to be either an average bland permavirgin nice guy to self-insert into or a gary stu with no real flaws that could ruin the power fantasy <br> girls have to love boring MCs for no reason, so kissless shits won't have their insecurities triggered <br> any romance has to be cockblocked until the very end to not enrage shipperfags <br> plot is made of cliches and actions have to be explained so viewers' brains won't overheat <br>At least the girls are cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gary stu <br>why is this word so overused lately?</br></br>  <br> Risa is overrated and also a disgusting dyke <br><br>I don't even.</br></br></br>  <br>Because there's a lot of LN adaptations lately and many of them have a super special slowflake MC winning everything and being worshiped by everyone.<br><br>But yeah, some people certainly overuse it claiming that MCs like Touma or Ararararagi are gary stus.</br></br></br>  How's it feel seeing your husbando for the first time in like weeks and then he gets raped by the KINGU, Yuzu?  <br>Thats a pretty beautiful waifu you got there Yuya<br>It would be a shame if something happened to her</br></br>  <br>Remember when people only read opponent's cards effects for random plot conveniences even though they can at all times?<br><br>I definitely do, I actually liked the DM dub, at least as far as Kaiba/Atem went.</br></br></br>  <br>Shining Dragon isn't bad because it's a main deck monster. It's bad because it is a main deck monster that requires an extra deck monster to summon, one which requires a reasonable amount of resources to get out.<br><br>And in the end it isn't that much stronger than Ultimate.<br><br>Shining would be a decent card if it just required one blue-eyes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shadoll Fusion for Blue-Eyes FIXED</br>  <br>The problem I have with the movie is the fact that is 6 months after the manga, so, that means it won't have any connections with GX and the people who died in the manga will remain dead? Or it will be a mix of the two storylines?</br>  I have a theory:<br><br>People who don't like Cat have not read Nekomonogatari (White).<br><br>Or to put it another way, I can't imagine anyone not liking Hanekawa having read it. It had dimensions that got cut out of the adaptation.<br><br>With that out of the way, let the customary waifu wars commence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nadeko basically understood morals, but was able to paint herself as the victim through her delusions. But once the delusions are gone she takes a different approach and basically says "I'm a bad person I guess, but if that's who I am then I need to live with it, right?"<br><br>Hanekawa has morals built into her like a machine, but she doesn't really understand their weight. Although Neko Shiro shows that she's actually more human than she appeared, even though she's missing some key ingredients.</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  Ladies, please. Can we just agree that monkey a shit and settle on that?  3 FUCKING ARC AND EVERYTHING RESULT NOTHING.<br>also if you read kizu it literally focus on her too</br>  <br>What'd you expect from a Crab fan, the biggest normies of the bunch.</br>  It is out  <br>How else do you think he comes up with the sweet moves these holy knights use?</br>   almost half way through the manga  <br> only 6 sins  <br> only 3 gaiden <br>I don't know how to feel about this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What's wrong with only 3 gaiden?</br></br>  <br>You don't need to worry about the 7th sin.</br>  <br>They aren't ninjas.</br>  Personally i'm loving this show already and it has the potential to become even better. I'm looking to hear some contrasting opinions, hit me with 'em Anon  <br>Although I think the brother drama was necessary to get the viewers to empathize with<br>Nao and explain why her personality is like that I honestly hated imouto-chan since she was<br>introduced. Really dont understand the praise shes been getting in the charlotte threads,<br>annoying voice with a stupid and moe speech pattern. <br>Atleast its been foreshadowed that imouto chan will die at some point, I'm one of the few eagerly awaiting it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I can't believe you can't see how shit this is.</br>  <br>It's not much worse than anything else I can nitpick in the first or second episode of literally any other anime.<br>Really, any other anime.</br></br>  what's the name of this show?  <br>b̶o̶k̶u̶ ̶n̶o̶ ̶p̶i̶c̶o̶ Charlotte</br>  chapter 03  <br>  Young Taiga <br><br>B<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>I wonder if they'll add more content. Like references to Zero and Gil fighting inside the shadow before getting rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She got just one H scene in her own route, less than Saber and and the purple one.</br>  <br> Rin can also use those spells, and Caster too. <br>She appeared with Rider's eyes at the end of that scene for fuck's sake, how is that vague?</br></br>  <br>Maybe Rin had an eye infection.</br>  <br> Rider's eyes. <br>There's more than one character in F S/N that share the same eye color.<br><br>You could even say that its actually Sakura, after using her shadow powers and taking the form of Rin.</br></br></br></br>  Are anime/maga/vn's the key to making interracial relationships more a publicly acceptable?  <br>2nd worst Campione.</br>  <br> The media of a nation is the reflection of the attitudes of the nation. <br>That's not true.<br>Media is often filtered to give the appearance of a certain popular attitude in order to guide the real attitudes of the nation.<br>Furthermore, if you go with fringe media like anime, which really barely anybody cares about, then no. You are not going to have a bigger effect.<br><br>In order for this topic to be addressed in a sane manner, you'd have to look at the media as a whole. But that wouldn't be /a/ related any more. I suggest    or .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know outside of this little 4chan bubble nobody gives a shit about anime and VNs, right?</br>  <br>When said media is niche as fuck and 5K sales are considered a big success it doesnt reflect shit, it only reflect a few perverts</br>  <br>I really want another season of Campione</br>  You should be able to solve this.  <br>Where's the question?</br>  <br>Also physics.</br>  <br>Physics is like the link between them.</br>    <br>What problem?</br></blockquote>]
