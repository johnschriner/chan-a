[ Everyone hates edgelords but it's ok if Guts does it. Why?  Maybe you should continue reading.  <br><br>Because it's more like a slab or iron than an edge.<br><br>Now let's get down to business; Who will win the rickertbowl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not that we hate edgelords, it's that edgelords have no character outside of being edgy as hell. Guts has something we like to call personality. I know it's a rare concept to give anime characters actual character development, but i assure you it exists.</br>  Because there are both many times that show that he's more than just an edgelord and that what he's doing does have an effect on him, and also because there's an explanation for why he started acting like an edgelord.<br>People probably wouldn't like Berserk so much if all it was was him being an edgelord without any explanation or signs of remorse.</br>  <br>Because Guts really earned the right to be edgy. He's seen some shit.</br>  <br>Erica. Miura doesn't have the guts to kill a loli like old times.</br>  Guts is the savior of humanity.  <br>Certain edgelords can be justified depending on the story. How they were raised, what they've been through, and how the edginess is portrayed</br>  <br> Guts has a personality <br><br> muh revenge <br> muh caska <br>Sure thing, bud</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgelords are edgy because they chose to be, Guts didn't really have a choice</br>  <br>Maybe you should actually read the text bubbles instead of skipping through the images.</br>  <br>No point in baiting. <br>But ff that's really what you think, go re-read Beserk, "bud".</br></br>  <br><br>Guts isn't that edgy anymore though.</br></br>  Where can i read the new chapters   Started reading a week ago <br> Last night I stayed up till 7 am after coming back from a party reading <br> Read the whole eclipse at once <br> Went to bed after reading 90 feeling legit mentally ill <br> Had dreams of finding out about weird orgies between several friends from different moments of my childhood in some weird hotel <br> yet everyone acted kinda cool about it and it was weird as shit <br> at one part I even suspected my gf was cheating on me <br> Had a dream where I had this weird phylosophical chat with a friend I had that I saw like gutts saw griffith about how our friendship ended because I grew out of it and now he hated me <br><br>Is Berserk legit fucking up my mind? Should I stop reading?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it wrong to want to lick Schierke  <br>Puberty is a bitch huh.</br>  <br>I'm 19</br>  <br>He could have chosen to stay in that magic cave with Casca after the eclipse. But he choosed to have his revenge.</br>  <br>He was ass-raped by a huge muscular black man.<br><br>He's excused.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn you ve been mind raped. Welcome to berserk</br>  <br>Don't you mean Griffith?</br>  <br>That's cuz when guts gets edgy people actually die.</br>  <br>Late bloomer? Well it happens I suppose.</br>  <br> going to parties <br> gf <br> epic greentext story <br>You should stop breathing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE WAS SPAWNED FROM THE IDEA OF EVIL!<br><br>Think of it like this, they are like the chaos gods of the warhammer universe. Thoughts and emotions and actions created them ,since there are more evil actions then good then guess what happend.</br></br></br>  Guts isn't even an edgelord. He's fucking cursed and he has to pretend not to be attached to anyone in order to keep on fighting.<br><br>I mean that panel where he turned his back on the count's daughter and was real sad was supposed to show it pretty well.</br></br>  <br>Griffith wasn't spawned from the Idea of Evil.<br><br>It's just causality, everyone has a fate and Griffith's supposed to be really lucky and always succeed and everything.<br><br>Meanwhile Guts' supposed to live through hell and survive, while his friends don't.</br></br></br></br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128823<wbr>353/<br><br>すけべ言葉版</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  なるべく諦めない！<br>なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

This is one of the drawbacks. You need to stop thinking about radicals and just recognize the kanji as a whole. If not I don't know what the problem is. I've never had to zoom in to see kanji.</br>  <br>I just only finished so I'm still transitioning, I did RTK late though and have some study under my belt aside from that, so I'm not stupid enough to read Japanese with English keywords. You mark a point though.<br><br>To be fair I might simply need to change my glasses. Anon up there made me notice my vision got worse.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks by the way.</br></br>  For people who learned kanji through vocabulary and things like an anki deck (that is, without mnemonics), how do you recognize different kanji where only one stroke seperates them?<br><br>I get that it is different from person to person, but I just want to know how it is for different people. If there are two kanji that look really alike, do you sometimes have a difficult time reading them?</br></br>  <br> Did you do RTK or something? This is one of the drawbacks. <br>Maybe if you're still learning them. The end result of RTK is recognizing the Kanji as a whole.</br></br>  the end result of RTK is flushing it down the toilet  <br>No it isn't. The book says keyword to kanji, that is not recognition, that is construction.</br>  <br>You misunderstood what he said. What he meant is to stop focusing so much on individual Kanji parts and instead seeing words as words. Example : 意味, the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as "idea" and "not yet", or even worse, "sound, heart / mouth and some young tree". Which is kind of what I'm going through at times, I need to stop thinking of these things and instead seeing words as words, like I would read English or my native language.</br>  <br><br> media <br><br>Anon, this is why I deliberately made the distinction between proficiency (undoubtedly years away), which is what you're describing, and fluency (probably months away).<br><br>I know that I'm not six months away from reading every VN ever made without touching a dictionary.<br><br>However, will I have enough vocabulary to be able to handle damn near anything that comes up in everyday conversation in six months? Based off of what I can comprehend now, I think I will. If you've listened to normal Japanese people having a discussion with their friends and family, you know that they're usually not throwing around 電磁 曳光弾 (you might be able to take a guess at what I've been reading), or any other terms along these lines that turns near-native proficiency in Japanese into such a long haul. The vocabulary pool for the conversational Japanese needed to be an active, functioning member of Japanese society who can get completely cut off from an English-speaking environment and still work and make friends is much smaller.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  熟語jukugo is more inportant than kanji alone. its have one meaning per a jukugo. so that simple and less mistaken  <br>baldr sky? more like baldr shit amirite</br>  <br> That anon saved the image from about a year ago. <br>More like two months actually</br></br>  <br>I'm most productive during the night. My comprehension drops to shit in the early morning.</br>  <br><br>I'm enjoying it. The setting is a bit depressing, but the story is interesting.<br><br>Unlike Flyable Heart. Goddamn, Flyable Heart was miserable to read, especially moving at a snail's pace like that. If I were to make a list of least favorite tsunderes of all time, Kururi might top it. If I were to make another list of protagonists who need to press charges on their harems, Shou would definitely be on it. Even being the miserable douchebag that he was, it was still pretty unpleasant watching him get abused at every turn, and it was made even worse by how he didn't so much as raise his voice at them (a double standard, since he treats dudes like shit). I think that the story was about to let up on Shou abuse, but I just didn't care to continue. Water gun tag wasn't enough to convince me.<br><br>At least it served as an easy place to get acclimated to grammar, since if you misunderstood something, you'd probably only be lost for the remainder of the scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  do you smoje, /DJT/?  <br> learn meanings and readings of some 2000+ symbols when several of them might have double meaning/reading <br>or<br> learn meanings and readings of 15000+ words but hey, at least it's not ambiguous now, right? <br>Hmmm.</br></br></br></br>  ぱっつん　like or hate?  What is Japanese equivalent of fuck off?  <br><br>ファック・オフ</br></br>   fourth <br> 五 </br>  <br> Example : 意味, the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as "idea" and "not yet", or even worse, "sound, heart / mouth and some young tree". Which is kind of what I'm going through at times <br>1. The second kanji's keyword is "flavor". 未 is "not yet".<br>2. If you're breaking kanji into radicals as you read, you're doing RTK completely wrong.<br><br><br>Recognition is obviously implied if you have mastered production. And RTK faggots who aren't writing the kanji as instructed deserve to fail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm running down that slope, the wind feels great.</br>  <br> If you're breaking kanji into radicals as you read, you're doing RTK completely wrong. <br>Don't be retarded, I never said I was, I said this as an example of "what-to-not-do". As for "kind of what I'm doing" I meant seeing Kanji indifivudually instead of seeing the whole picture (i.e. words).<br> the goal here is to read いみ, not think of it as X or Y. <br><br>Bu you knew this already right? You just came here because your ego is shitty and you felt like vomitting in the thread to feel better about yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> know enough to spot a variety of fuck ups, both "hard" mistakes like that one and "soft" mistakes like the translator's inability to capture the flavor of that particular line <br> don't know enough to actually enjoy raws; if I want to treat anime like a relaxing activity instead of as intense practice, have to use subs <br><br>I-I'll get back to reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Water gun tag <br><br>I think I spent weeks on that part. It was like the endless lunch in Hanahira.</br></br></br>  I don't understand what とる is supposed to mean when coupled with a (n/no-adjective) and に<br><br>like<br> 最強にとれるわけがない </br></br></br>  cluster amaryllis曼珠沙華　曼珠華　彼岸花　葉無花無<br>kanji cluster</br>  <br>This, I did RTK in a month and now I can watch anime without subs and write fluently like a japanese person</br>  I've been playing Aiyoku no Eustia and the grammar used is pretty easy. If it wasn't for the amount of vocab that I don't know, I guess that it would be easy to play without using VNReader.  <br> I did RTK <br> now I can watch anime without subs <br>I fail to see how it's related.<br><br>Also, one month? How many Kanji a day were you doing? 75? For that one I'm not doubting you, it's doable, but still quite intensive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it did run a bit long. Especially if you were trying different options out. I think that it tired me out, and combined with not really enjoying the story, it was enough to make me not come back.<br><br>If I ever go back to finish Flyable Heart, it will probably be when I can boot it up without AGTH and not be inconvenienced by this to any significant degree.</br></br></br></br>  If you have a group of people like in 多くの田舎者は都市に行っている or something, can 行っている have a repetitive meaning? Like, a group of people are going one after another.  Reading yotsuba before finishing tae kim is physically hurting me  <br> I fail to see how it's related. <br>Because if you know the kanji you know all the words too.</br></br>  <br>はやく死ね</br>  <br><br>Yeah, the first time is murder.<br><br>It gets easier pretty fast, though. It's not something that you think about when you haven't taken on a task like this before, but you build up stamina for mental tasks, too. Soon, reading for ten hours straight won't be an issue for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just don't go back to it. It's not like it's one of the top games, even among moege. It just happens to have a low kanji count so people take that to mean that it's one of the easiest things to read. I'm sorry you're ruining Baldr Sky for yourself so early though<br><br><br>大変申し訳ありませんが、今はちょっと…</br></br></br></br>  <br>I take like 10 minutes per page holy shit<br><br>Just noticed my first pun though so that's pretty rewarding I guess</br></br></br>  どうも、助かりました。お蔭様でした。<br><br>My first thought was "okay they're trolling".<br>But actually they were only half-trolling.</br></br></br>  <br> 侍魂 <br> translated as "Samurai Daruma" <br> TL note: A Samurai Daruma is a .... </br></br></br>  okagesama is king of japanese  <br><br> ruining Baldr Sky <br><br>I'm a bit lucky, in that I don't inherently find reading at a slow pace unenjoyable. Some people just can't stand it.<br><br>Of course, it depends. I think that with the water gun scene, I was ready to see if character interactions were going to change for the better and make the game cozy like SoL should be instead of obnoxious, so such a long skit put at that point just seemed to drag.<br><br>And Baldr Sky is interesting enough that you want to see what happens next, so that makes it a good pick. If I get lost (don't think I will; I'm fairly confident in my grammar), I'll just drop it and come back to it at a later date to enjoy looking at how my view of the story has changed.<br><br>Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm not eager to increase my reading speed. It's still more relaxing to read a work when you don't have to put any effort into it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't planning on trying to read Yotsuba before reading through the grammar guide. Should I?</br>  <br><br>It was the same for me. It wasn't long before it became 10 minutes per chapter, or less than that.<br><br>Try to get through Tae Kim.

There are much better quality raws than what is currently scanlated, so surely someone should have done it by now?  <br>I don't claim to understand the ways of the EOP scum.</br>  <br>You mean the ones in the CoR are bad? Where did you find better ones? Nyaa?</br>  <br>No I'm saying the scanlated versions. The one from the CoR is great quality.<br><br>Scanlated yotsuba seems to have been done ages ago and badly too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Sorry for the confusion</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh alright, I see, my bad too.</br></br>   a 5 year old knows japanese better then you ever will. <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>In your case you might want to study some more English.<br> then </br></br>  <br>The manga has furigana, friend.</br>  <br>Who knows.

There is no way in hell a person with a few months of Japanese would be mostly comprehending that show, or any anime.<br><br>Being able to mostly understand anime after a few months, if the person is an actual beginner and not someone who has really been studying on and off for years but only started seriously, is staggering progress. This means you have an understanding of thousands of words, normal paced Japanese mixed with a range of casual, slangy, formal inflections, niche terminology, etc. けいおん! is not aimed at kids despite whatever the fuck you might want to assume with calling it "easy". That's absolutely fucking absurd. Show me a single person who has only a few months with the language who can mostly understand something like K-On. <br><br>You know what I think, I think you are saying this from a position of a beginner yourself, spewing out retarded shit people have spewed out from reading what other people have spewed out before them. There really isn't much of a difference between shows like K-On and tv dramas, talks shows, etc. The grammar used is all pretty much the same with the key difference being the particular variety interest having a niche vocabulary pool. There really isn't a whole lot of "harder" media being broadcast aside word choice. For Japanese which is noticeably more advanced than things like that you would have to dive into literature. <br><br>How long have you actually been studying Japanese for?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another way to say "don't say things which I find offensive". <br><br>That's not what it means in that context though.

Calling a spade a spade doesn't mean the person is upset. This sort of reaction shows more of a misunderstanding of human emotion on your part than it does with the other person, which is something that relates to Autism. It was a reaction to a post.

I'm guessing it's something from the LN? Will we get to see it in the anime? And why couldn't she ride it before?</br></br>  Albedo is too desperate unlike delicious Shalltear.  <br>Albedo would like everyone if Ainz hadn't changed her description.</br>  <br>Her mount is bicorn (dual corn unicorn) but bicorns won't let virgin ride them (they will collapse to the ground if ridden forcibly). That's one one reasons why she jumps ainz later on. This stuff from vol 8 so it's unlikely to feature in the anime (it could be added anyway since it doesn't affect the timeline)</br>  <br><br>So she's a virgin until volume 8? And succeeds in jumping him and doing it? Indicating that he can indeed have sex and does have the necessary parts? Or it fails and she still can't?</br></br>  <br>Her creator said she was a bitch.<br><br>In Japan, they treat the term bitch like how we treat the term slut.<br><br>Albeido wouldn't love Ainz but she wouldn't be only his personal slut since her creator intended her to be the guild exclusive slut so other guild members could have a go at her as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't read that far but some spoilers mention that she is stopped before she can rape ainz punished with 3 days of confinement . she probably just gives up the option of riding her summon and ask aura to lend her a high level mount (such as a unicorn which can only be ridden by a virgin). BTW we also learn that shalltear is virgin although she has sexual experience with the same aex</br>  What day does this anime air again?  <br>Tuesday</br>  <br>You mean that Loli who is that insecure that she stuffed her busts?</br>  <br> shalltear is virgin although she has sexual experience with the same sex <br>Go on</br></br>  <br>Loli Vampire is always the correct answer.</br>  <br>She says that she only likes undeads but she can't stand decaying meat of most of them</br>  Loli, she's sweet :D      How can you impregnate and have an actual kid with a Succubus? That makes no sense.<br> Discovered Kyonyuu fantasy yesterday </br>  <br><br>I doubt they work the same as most succubi in that world.<br><br>Also, she's an imp and at least one other race. Probably fallen angel or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbian sex isn't real sex, silly.</br>    <br>I think Albedo would be more fun to date.</br>  <br>Albedo will always be my choice. I like big tits, and I also like loyal minions to the point of fanaticism.</br>  <br>no bully please</br>  <br>I'm fairly certain that Imp is the base class for all daemonic types and once you've gained a certain amount of levels in Imp you can get levels in a higher daemon class.

So she's autistic, right?  Why did she knock all the food off the shelf?  Ask /m/.  <br>YOLO</br>  I love this guy.  <br>Autistic people do that.</br>  <br>What is this face trying to convey?</br>  <br>And she almost stripped in front of an entire room of people to try and get them to believe what she was saying. Not only that, she also started randomly singing Jingle Bells when people began bitch-slapping each other.<br><br>Valvrave was comedy gold. The threads were fantastic.</br></br></br>  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside.</br>  I want to sexually fuck saki  <br>I want to psychologically fuck Saki.</br>  <br>I want to stuff Saki in a bag and forcefully feed her my semen through a feeding tube.</br>  <br>You must be confusing Saki with that dumb bimbo Shoko.</br>  <br>why is saki so hot lads?</br>  <br>Because she is a rapist?</br>  <br>The pleasure of brain problems inside.</br>  <br>Is this worth watching?</br>  <br>Do you like fun?</br>  <br>Not as much now, since most of the entertainment came from laughing at the retarded character interactions and absurd plot-twists with /a/ while it aired. But if you want to, go ahead. It's stupidly fun.</br>  <br>It is a silly show but I did have a lot of fun watching it with you guys at the time</br>  <br>It was fun to watch with /a/ for how much of a typical sunrise train wreck the show was. Ending was shit and I still mad,but other than that 7.5/10 pretty fun.</br>  Why didn't you protect his smile, /a/?  Why do I have this saved  <br>It's melodramatic and fun with retarded plot twists and a good OST.<br><br>The characters are generally okay too.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanted more Jewbro and Thunder</br>  <br>A3 will comfort him.</br>  <br>If you didn't watch it with /a/ as it aired, don't bother. Same goes for Guilty Crown and Aldnoah Zero.</br>  <br><br>Don't you mean perfect?</br></br>  ERUERUFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  <br>VVV was the gayest mecha in a while. I'm not a faggot or a fujo, but I didn't feel like Haruto was that much into Shoko or girls as he was into this dude.</br>   you will never waifu Vampire Saki   <br>Absolutely not, don't fall for the "LOL IT'S FUN" meme.<br><br>Completely garbage show, only worth watching with /a/ to laugh at the bullshit. And even then just barely worth it.</br></br></br>  Why don't monsters have feelings, /a/?  <br>There was no saving A.Z. The threads were as bad as the show.</br>  <br>It was fun, though. Why do you have to label everything as a meme?</br>  <br><br>Its a masterpiece, too far ahead of its time for some people to accept.<br>Don't listen to the plebians</br></br></br>  <br>This. It was a scathing commentary on modern society. The themes are far too subtle for the typical audience.</br>  <br>It was only fun to watch with /a/.<br><br>Same shit as Cross Ange or Code Geass or any of the other trainwreck shows.</br></br></br>  <br>But he's right. It was fun only because of the circumstances, i.e. watching with /a/.</br>  Would you?  <br><br>No, I agree. The "meme" bit just irked me a bit since that word has been so insanely abused recently.</br></br>  <br> not understanding the importance of moral <br>Why doesn't that guy go find some more instructions to follow.</br></br>  <br>Damn season 2 was two years ago?<br><br>Anime life is some dangerous shit</br></br></br>  What are some of the upcoming anime with maximum trainwreck material?<br><br>I didn't go on /a/ much in 2014 and thinking about the Valvrave threads puts me in the mood to enjoy another trainwreck with /a/ again.</br></br>  <br>It was obviously written by retards who didn't realize they were retards and kept attempting serious drama. In wouldn't bother.</br>  <br> still waiting </br>  So many plebs in this thread. I guess its true, most genius isn't recognized in its own time.  <br>I'm putting my money on the new gundam.</br>  <br> Same shit as Cross Ange or Code Geass or any of the other trainwreck shows. <br><br>Except those aren't the same and neither is this one. False advertisement.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not subtle. <br><br>What does seem kind of sadly hilarious is how there are still shitposters who don't fucking get the people making the show knew it was sort of a riot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the term means even less every day going by how stupidly you're using it. I wish you would all just fall down.</br>  <br>Is this the robo-Doakes of /a/?</br>  <br>I raged so hard when she managed to make it to the end but Haruto didn't.</br>  <br>she reminds me of the girls that I was scared of in high school<br> she even wears the same dumb boots </br></br>  <br>Shame Valvrave wasnt out at the time I hope, then you would have known that raping them is the proper course of action</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>girls are human too anon, not some mythical goddess you need to fear because they take effort to look good and dress nice</br>  What the fuck were the writers thinking when they did that whole High School Musical shtick in episode 5?  <br>I tried it a couple of months ago. I dropped it very quickly.<br><br>After random singing, and overall stupidity, I gave up.</br></br></br>  <br>the joke was the show was acting serious, but the only thing it was serious about was being a vampire highschool musical.</br>    <br>But Anon, I know you are hero in your life.</br>  <br><br>Of course she survived. She was the representation of the core of the show. The airhead genius. The pragmatic idealist. She represents the post-ironic quality of Valvrave that makes it a masterpiece.</br></br>  <br>It was protected.</br>  <br>A/Z threads weren't even good. A/Z in general was bad in a much more mundane way and not nearly as crazy as the other two, really.</br>  <br>No bully.</br>   show about space vampires <br> it sucks <br>Pottery.</br></br>  L-Elf x Shoko forever.  I miss S1 Valverave.<br><br>S2...eh.<br><br>I bought a kit for Unit 1 like 8 months ago I still haven't put together, should do that soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is the dumbest shit. I'm impressed. <br>This is still so apt.</br></br>  <br>L-Elf is what Slaine could have been if he had let his balls drop</br>  <br>If you have  friends  then it's an amusing watch to laugh at how absurd it is. Otherwise, no.</br>  Ah the older brother of Cross Ange, back when Sunrise didn't advertise how little fucks they gave, like they did with Cross Ange.<br><br>At least this show didn't have Deus ex Frying Pan.</br></br>  <br>The frying pan was kinda there (as in it was vanished from Momoka and not kinda of animation mistake). But, what takes the cakes is Tusk's suicidal bombing.<br><br>Besides, I think VVV operates in "If I can't make an rational even if somewhat implausible deduction (like a screw hitting in a precise spot) about it, it can happen".</br></br></br>  <br>They were doing this for retarded fun.</br>  VVV was the Code Geass of anime.  <br><br>It was basically Code Geass with mecha.</br></br>  Reminder that Saki is a rapist.  <br>They are nothing alike, anon. L-Elf was a murdermachine trained since childhood. Slaine was a peacefag who lost hope.</br>  Why was Jewbro the very best?  <br>Chaos Dragon is pretty trainwreck.</br>    <br><br>Ill give him this, he was never boring.</br></br>  <br>Jews are always the best, go- er, friend!</br>  <br>But he was a piece of shit. I hated that faggot the entire serie and i watched this shit with /a/.</br>  <br> People shouldn't never fight! Peace is the most important thing! <br> YOU KILLED SHOKO SO I'LL KILL YOU AAAHH <br> I CAN'T TELL SHOKO I LIKE HER BECAUSE MONSTERS DON'T HAVE FEELINGS! <br>He was already insufferable by the end of the second episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls are too fragile for me to be around.</br>  <br>That's sort of the one thing I can say about Valvrave in general. It was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen, but at least it wasn't boring.</br>  <br>AZ threads was shit as anime. It was filled with reddit and facebook fuckers</br>  <br> It was filled with reddit and facebook fuckers <br>That's Jojo. AZ's filled with tumblr.</br></br>  I need to rewatch this, thank's OP<br><br>Saki best girl</br></br>  <br>I always want to rape drill. Fuck Saki and Shoko. Drill was the best and sexiest girl in the show</br>  <br>And reddit, animesuki and MAL.</br>  <br>You're welcome, Anon.<br><br>I don't know about best, but the Drill ojou-sama was pretty hot.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, that's genderswap L-Elf.</br>  <br>It's samething. But that shit not even funny. Just retard and boring shit</br>  <br>The problem with AZ was that it was more subdued, so there wasn't much to make the threads entertaining, and Urobuchi's name and all that promo stuff attracted the worst kind of people.</br>  <br> rewatching one of the worst anime in years </br>  <br> so there wasn't much to make the threads entertaining <br>But I like the Char posting.</br></br>  <br>It may be dumb as hell, but at least it's kind of entertaining.</br>  Was Cross Ange better?  <br>No.</br>  <br>this<br><br><br>fuck you guy</br></br></br></br>  Be honest, how many of you picked up the show when the board was flooded with the Saki rape scene?  <br>Yes, because Nana was the MC rather than a side character.</br>  <br> not enjoying the rollercoaster in full force with /a/ <br> mfw saki got raped </br></br>  <br> not picking up a Sunrise right from when it airs </br>  <br>It was bad but fun. So fuck off.</br>  <br> it was bad but fun so fuck off <br>If only people had the balls to defend other shows like this</br></br>  I remember the 'We are on a motherfucking Dyson Sphere' post. I remember when we thought that different VVVs had a different movie monster attached to them and L11 would become a pilot of the 'Mummy' to gve people orders.  <br>Good times. Can't believe two years went by already.</br>  <br>I still wouldn't rewatch the show unless I had peopel to do it with though. Fuck Haruto and Shoko.</br>  <br> sorting through my folders last week <br> find Valvrave <br> so many Saki saved <br> begin to miss her <br> marathon S2 just for her <br>Pardon the blog but it was worth it. Saki was based as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have L-elf gif "fuck the thread, I'm out" when jump in floor? I lost my folders and the archive's image all die</br>  <br>Because most are just insecure faggots who try to defend what they enjoy claiming it's a masterpiece when it's not.<br><br>We're blunt and honest.</br></br></br>  How did AZ manage to be a better show in every way?  <br>Not autistic, but batshit clueless.</br>  KAKUMEI WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>LEEEEEEETS SHOOOOOOUT</br></br>  <br>Slaine was more fuckable than all the girls in VVV.</br>  <br> sexually fuck <br> sexually <br><br>Geez man, that's pretty fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The degree the plot advances lessens with every new arc.<br>Beyond that? Its a very fun ride</br></br>  <br>But not as fun</br>  <br>CA has better MC all around, but I prefer VVV in "plot tweest"</br>  <br><br> VVV was the Code Geass of anime <br> It was basically Code Geass with mecha. <br><br>You guys are either high or really, really stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is the Evangelion of anime, just as VVV is the Code Geass of anime, Anon. You're high and/or stupid, not us.</br>  <br> Madoka is the Evangelion of anime, just as VVV is the Code Geass of anime, Anon <br><br>Thanks for proving I was underestimating your stupidity.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself out of /a/, my man.</br>   Valvrave <br><br>The most fun show I've hd the previlege of watching with /a/.

Still was fun.</br>  I just finished it and wow that fucking Iori cunt literally ruined everything.  <br>Haruto did literally nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br>I picked it up because this Saki reaction image became my go to favourite.</br></br>  Saki was best girl of 2013. Prove me wrong, faggots. Oh wait, you can't.  <br>Wasn't there like an OreImo shoop of this with Kriem?</br>  Where's the stinky neet pussy?  <br>Not smashed against my face, unfortunately.</br>  <br>Just in case we where thinking child appropriate fucking</br>  So who fucked saki pussy in the end?  I want to liberate all the vulvas with my dick.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lef<wbr>ndDnsaNM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Shoko won right?  <br>yes, shoko was right afterall</br>  <br>The parts where A-Drei just starts screaming unintelligibly are the best.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sLI<wbr>QrFY3fUk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Aoi Yuuki could make any sound and it would still get me rock hard, but this is to go even further beyond.</br>  Greatest fun I've had with /a/, I miss those weekly threads full of speculah and that screencapfag posting Tank Top Girl or something like that before VVV aired.<br><br>I also fucking loved their eyes.</br></br>  Saki is love.<br><br>Saki is life.</br></br>  <br>on one hand I'm glad I lived long enough to see Part 3 getting animated, on the other hand I can't enjoy it as much because of the shitty threads, I'm just looking forward to part 4  inb4 never </br>    Does anyone have a gif or webbum of X1 pushing up his glasses over his helmet?  I wouldn't have liked this show at all if it wasn't for this guy right here  <br>I fucking love Jun Fukuyama</br>  <br> EWHRUAHRUHU <br>I can't stop laughing.</br></br>  <br>A/Z was a drama between 3 characters with the war as a backdrop. VVV was random shit that was occasionally amusing.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it up till the Valvrape the Penetrator twist, but even before that it was pretty fucking dumb.<br>If you like shipping white haired dudes together you might enjoy it.</br></br>  <br>I dunno, I would rather watch Haruto do dumb shit like a musical webcast than deal with anymore of Inaho's bland perfection. (Side characters are way better, though.)</br>  <br>VVV's side characters are way hotter, though.</br>  <br>Crouton was the only decent dude in the entire series.</br>  <br> Inaho <br> perfection <br>He lost a bunch of fights and he couldn't do shit without Hime.</br></br></br>  <br> Side characters are way better <br>Barely.<br><br> Maritos'muh PTSD for one season <br> only PUT YA GUNS ON for minor background events in season 2 <br> Rat's muh betrayal drama in season 1 <br> does jack shit in season 2 <br>etc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Side characters are way better, though <br>They were pretty boring with a few exceptions here and there.<br>That being said, Saazbaum was Jewbro-tier</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say Slaine and A-Drei are about equal looks-wise and the Princess is pretty cute, but Inaho's back-up team is pretty bland so I'll give you that. <br><br><br> Constantly using the shittiest mech and doing better than people with years more training <br>That's just standard teen protag though--what actually gets me is the emotionless, "sister, why are you upset when you thought I died?" sort of shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why were you scared?</br>  <br>He did better because he knew physics or some shit. They handwaved the training with "no one was ready for crazy super robots" which yeah, usual anime setup so the MC can be a teenager.<br><br> emotionless <br>He wasn't, this is meme shit. Not sure where you got that about his sister, he just told her he wasn't quitting the army.</br></br></br></br>  No.<br><br>She's a bit of an airhead yes but isn't autistic since she tends to be very friendl'y with people.<br><br>Why does people hate her again bar the election near end episodes?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Autism is a meme now, no one knows or cares what it means.</br>  <br> Missile lands nearby- doesn't seem to care <br> Friend falls into force field and dies- doesn't seem to care <br> In a battle for his life, facing ridiculous odds against superior technology- doesn't seem to care <br> Giving CPR to Seylum- doesn't seem to care <br> Humanity's last real bastion attacked by superior forces- doesn't seem to care <br> About to go on basically suicide mission- doesn't seem to care <br>These are just the ones I remember. I wouldn't mind so much if it was some part of character backstory that got explored later on but it just always seemed they forgot to write in a personality for him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't seem to care <br>Were you multitasking or something? It was obvious that he cared he's just less expressive.</br></br>  I want to cum inside Kriem.  I want to cum on Saki's eyes.  Audrey still best girl.  I want to publicly penetrate Saki  <br>No one wants to hear your bragging Amadeus.</br>  <br>thunder could've saved this show</br>  <br>Yes. She's also best girl.</br>  <br> code geass <br> trainwreck <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If I were new I'd be blindly agreeing with your nonsensical statements.</br></br>  What was the last Sunrise mecha anime that didn't devolve into shit?  <br>SEED</br>  <br>Does Build Fighters count?</br>  <br>S2 was a single big trainwreck.</br>  <br>Try</br>  <br>Shoko is love and live. Too bad the writers used her as a foil to make Haruto sympathetic.</br>  What was L-Elf's vampire princess name again?  <br>No it is not. Fuck off.</br>  <br>Licht? Haruto?

They are the reason I still watch anime.</br></br></br>  <br>All's well that ends well, as wise men say, so nope.</br>  <br>Cross Ange</br>  <br>But the ending was complete bullshit.<br>Ledouche wasn't held responsible for his crimes. <br>Suzaku suddenly lives.<br><br>Nothing was resolved, and the peace won't last for more than 2 years either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ledouche wasn't held responsible for his crimes.  <br> Nothing was resolved,  <br><br>You blew it. <br><br> the peace won't last for more than 2 years either. <br><br>It was never a permanent peace. Which means you didn't get the point of that either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please enlighten me then, oh great writer!</br>  <br>I don't think I can do anything for you, if you can't even understand that he was obviously held responsible for his crimes and more.</br>  SamFlam was the better rollercoaster.  <br>it was 2 years ago, s1 was good and the trainwreck of s2 was fun to watch with /a/</br>  <br>Cabaneli.<br>New AU Gundam.<br>Readaption of Logh.<br>Macross Delta.</br></br></br></br>    <br> he thinks Code Geass was good unironically <br>How to spot a newfag.</br></br>  <br> Cabaneli <br><br>This needs to be better than GC I swear.</br></br></br>  <br>First season shoko was so fucking great.

Ange was shit from the very beginning, so it technically didn't devolve into shit.</br>  <br> stop liking what i dont like <br><br>shouldn't you be in summer school kid. i dont need a reason to like this show, i watched it, i liked it, and i'll watch it again. when your ready to grop up and join the adults your welcome</br></br></br>  <br>It's more entertaining than any show that aired in 2015 though.</br>  <br> 200 year timeskip <br>Those bastards, I waited four justowns to see what that was about, but we got nothing.</br></br>  was <br>it<br>rape</br></br>  <br>No, it wasn't. She just let him believe it was rape. If he hadn't gotten to it soon enough, she probably would have just gone ahead and raped him herself.</br>  <br>To the point that his main expression is blank-faced, and his expression when shit goes down is "eyebrows raised a fraction of an inch &amp; sweatdrop".

Does Rory get ordered to kill the translator?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Given that the book they gave the maids at the PX so that they could learn Japanese have a very restricted diffusion, I think even the JSDF do not want too many people from the Gate world to be exposed to our culture.<br><br>Itami already fucked up by letting Lelei buy books about physics and shit.</br></br></br></br>  New chapter is out.  penguin or sony?

To my understanding, he survives with amnesia. Dude was handom as fuck, you're telling me he has a harem? Does he ever meet the daddy issues elf again? Does he try to fuck her?

Kurokawa /ss/?</br></br>  <br>yes and is fucking women in every town he set foot</br>  Rory is tooo l-lewd  <br> so they are sex machines in the Gate world. <br>A nice counter to the elf rape, NTR and mindbreak meme. No NTR when the males of your race are the best lays.</br></br>  <br>That line somehow makes me to assume that she's not a virgin<br>Don't get me wrong. I know a princess in an upper class society has no reason to stay virgin once introduced. I'm just surprised that the show decided not to pull that usual virgin trope</br></br>  She's asking for it  <br><br>That's a weird plothole in my head.<br><br>When she's told about the ROD OF STEEL, she asks Hamilton what it is because she's "the one with a fiancée", yet in the hot springs she talks about peeping on the male knights of her order having gay relationships.<br><br>Make up your mind woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck.

We've all been trying to ignore him for years.</br>    <br><br>The anime is a pretty solid adaptation, I'd say you could watch everything that's been animated so far and not really miss anything. The only thing I can think of that the anime changed for the worse is Irisveil's talk with Ilya at the end of the first season. Some parts are made a lot better, especially the major fight scenes.<br>The manga's artstyle is pretty mediocre up until around halfway through 2wei but the amount of improvement by the time 3rei starts is phenomenal.<br><br><br>You could watch Prisma without knowing any Type-Moon stuff beforehand. It works fine as its own work, you'll just be missing out on a lot of the more subtle parts of the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3rei with Unlimited Budget Works <br>muh dick</br></br>  <br> idiot <br>I've told you they will spend all ecchi budget on kissing scenes, and will completely cut down on any lewd details on what matters, their bodies.<br>And now that I was right I am somehow some trolling idiot still? I guess whatever floats your boat. It sadly won't make it any better.</br></br></br>  Where is Shinji in Prisma Illya?  <br>It's progressively getting shittier with the ecchi budget.<br> first season: all Miyu shots have cameltoe <br> second season: has pic related <br> third season: nothing </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this from that dressup game? If so how do you only get one girl? I just wanna dressup Ilya.</br>  <br>Still waiting on that Bazett Lancer Install Hiroyama.</br>  <br>  "Just" <br>... eh?</br></br>  <br>The Matous are almost completely absent in Prisma, we don't know if Zouken even exists considering the changes in the history of the Holy Grail War in Prisma's timeline. Sakura shows up for like two pages in a single side chapter, that's it.<br> Until 3rei, but that's a different story. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, just. Nothing explicit sexuality.</br>  <br>Do we have to make this joke everytime?</br>  <br> Kuro literally mastrubating on Ilya's leg while they're playing tonsil hockey </br>  <br>I picked the manga up because I saw how cute Shirou was in it, then ended up liking Chloe</br>  <br>Wanna talk about the lewd Megami/Nyantype illustrations instead?</br>  <br> literally masturbating <br> literally <br>Fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you realize it won't be interracial if it's Kuro</br>  dead illya is the best illya  <br>You're telling me it's not pleasurable for women to rub their lady parts against things?</br>  <br>Well it's not figuratively.</br>  <br><br>she dies?</br></br>  <br>Zouken was around before the 4th war though, so even if the 4th war ended on a good note technically he should still be around.</br>  <br>No, I'm telling you there was nothing there to make that conclusion, not literally at least.<br>And even more so, eyecancer even for an OVA.</br></br>  <br> women <br>That's a child</br></br>  <br> notes <br>Kaleid Ilya fighting Types when?</br></br>  <br>Gets her heart torn out.</br>   third worlders get subs before anyone else   <br>Children masturbate too you know</br>  <br>I can confirm that this list is objectively correct</br>  <br>And that's the only way I'll have it.</br>  <br> Mi cara cuando </br>  <br><br>So she actually dies, as in is fully out of the story?

They developed it on their own, the Tohsakas weren't involved, the Matous haven't been mentioned at all or even showed up aside from Sakura's very brief appearance. The entire scenario is wildly different back who knows how far in history. The most obvious difference is that Ilya is actually just as old as she looks while at the same time everyone else is their F/SN age.<br>And  Miyu's home universe  in 3rei is a completely different ball game.</br></br></br>  <br>That trigger discipline.</br>  <br>Probably calls mags clips too.</br>  Next week confirmed adapting 3rei Chapter 5.5!<br>so probably they gonna adapt the highjump scene too</br>  <br>Lloranos un río, chavalito.</br>  <br>is fate even worth getting into? fuck I dont want to read a fucking VN</br>   MIYU   <br> All this filler <br>They could have just done 2wei in 13 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter if they adapt it like the beach episode, it will be shit.</br>  Why is kaleid drawn and animated better than UFOs UBW?  <br> 3rei side stories not being saved for 3rei OVAs <br>worry.jpg</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly is has really good fifths</br>  <br> MIYU <br><br><br>The staff is extremely motivated because of the subject matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Motivated at what?

Might've been bs but sounds like a reasonable system.</br>  <br> The lack of effort by which he curbstombs everything is offputting. It lacks excitement and satisfaction for me. <br><br>The consumer attitudes are changing. There have always been curbstomp stories for as long as publishing existed. But it was shows like Sword Art Online and Mahouka that opened the market up to where all those neglected gary stu stories now became possible money makers. As long as the audience accepts the stories and buy merchandise and supports businesses that purchase licenses from the various gary stu production committees, then this type of storytelling will continue to exist in anime. <br><br>Or even grow.
