[ What good anime has rape scenes in them?  Berserk, right off the bat  Good Irohasu, everyone!  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Another thread? Damn.<br><br>Good Irohasu, my brother.<br><br> </br></br></br></br> </br></br>  I love Iroha  <br>I always thought that every Yahari thread was just Op posting this.</br>  It's not even saturday.  <br>When I'm the OP, I let people know.<br>I'm just autistic, sorry.</br></br>  <br>does anyone have photos of yahari novels on top of each other....??</br>  <br><br>This?</br></br>  <br>P2<br> Bought new clothes for the date, but didn´t take the labels off, so she can return it.after. <br> Her knee socks had hole, took out her sewing kit to fix it <br> Put a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Went to the library to return romance manga(s) she borrowed, saves money. <br> Came to the meeting spot early, take a extra look at her notepad, "things I want to know about senpai today". </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> opening up a second shitari thread </br></br>  That ending did not justify the 25 hour generals at all. Not by a long shot.  <br>At least there are only around 2-3 yahari threads in the catalogs currently. <br>It could be worse.</br></br>  So, why do they say Iroha is a contender? In the anime, Yukino and the other one are about to decide who wins.  <br> Yukino and the other one are about to decide who wins <br>8man is the one who decides it, not the girls.</br></br>  <br>Someone is mad that nobody cares about Fate´s third adaptation with generic MC anymore?</br>  <br>Not that...<br>Somthing like &lt;--------this <br>physical books on top of each other....</br></br></br>  I need more Haruno in my life  <br>Because she's made to look like a contender to keep her fans buying the books.</br>  <br>that guy was an animefag autist</br>  <br>Sucks to be him then.</br>  <br> Filename <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>yea this pls</br>  Guess we'll let this one die out.

Put it into a pastebin or something?  <br>My favorite one was the Does Yukino like 8man?<br>I would paste it if I had it</br></br>  <br>That's a very long compilation, nobody has the time to do it.</br>  What's the meaning of "Iroha or death"?  <br>"I am proud to be autistic"</br>  <br><br>same fag but still kek'd</br></br>   Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe <br><br> another thread? <br> still forgot to save the 2nd part. Damn which thread was it? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You dont mean the Junenmae</br>  <br>stop reposting this fanfic shit every thread</br>  <br> Bought new clothes for the date, but didn´t take the labels off, so she can return it.after. <br> Her knee socks had hole, took out her sewing kit to fix it <br> Put a buy-one-get-one-free-meal coupon for a new cafe in her wallet. <br> Went to the library to return romance manga(s) she borrowed, saves money. <br> Came to the meeting spot early, take a extra look at her notepad, "things I want to know about senpai today". </br></br></br></br></br>  yukinon's so cute.....<br>cute!</br>  Yui is hurt, if she doesn't get the 8man she will begin to hate him and everyone else.    <br> No more Yahari <br><br>What do I do with my life now?</br></br></br>  <br>Post your waifu and shitpost.</br>  <br>Pls, no.</br>  <br>what is that weird thing on her chest...<br>(#samefag)</br></br>    <br>2.03 mb<br>what the fuck are you doing with your life?</br></br>    <br>cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br><br>go hard or go home, friend</br></br></br>  Iroha basically ruined this series and threw a wrench in the workings. She is unnecessary and irrelevant and should just die.  <br>i want to be her pantsu-san</br>    <br>ohh dont b so hard on her she was an interesting character.....<br>she just wasn't animated enough</br></br>  <br> Iroha basically ruined this series and threw a wrench in the workings. She is unnecessary and irrelevant and should just die. <br>Why? Iroha is a side character. Complaining against her is like complaining against that Finn fujoshi or Saki.</br></br>    <br>i wish she would show expressions like that....</br>  <br>Side characters should stay out of the club room when they don't have problems. Iroha hangs around like she belongs there.</br>    <br>well mayb she did want to join but couldn't cuz she was already manager at football club and a seitou fucking kaichou!!!!</br>    <br>I think one of the reasons I like Iroha is because she inspires so much anger from faggots. It's hilarious. I think I'm German at heart.</br>  <br>Even if she wants to join, this is haremshit and she is interested in the bishounen character and not the main character. People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense like reading NTR manga/doujins.</br>      <br>It's not Iroha who inspires anger, it's Irohafags.<br><br>Most people don't mind her one bit, but the retards who constantly screech about her have driven the rest of the fanbase, including a significant portion of her own fags, up a wall.</br></br></br>      <br>You should be dumping in the other thread. This one's too much of a shithole to be worth saving.</br>  <br>didn't notice the other one<br> see ya, nerds </br></br>  <br> she is interested in the bishounen character <br>Assumptions<br> not the main character <br>again??<br> People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense. <br>There's just no limit to you autism...<br>Low IQ, jumps to conclusions, believes delusional shit, overconfidence.....You are not worthy for a discussion.<br><br>GO DIE.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>BITCH!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I sure feel like I'm missing out by not having a discussion with an Irohafag. Really, I do. There's naught to discuss, your waifu was shoehorned in.</br>  Reminder to all Yukinofags that there are far more superior version of her in other LN  <br>Still hilarious.</br>  <br>  your waifu <br>see! assumptions again....<br>I'm a yukinofag</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to your burgerland, nerd</br>  <br> no ZR </br>  <br> doesn't understand basic words like cuck <br> takes it out by trying to make himself look better than a girls fanbase  <br> almost succeeds in making himself look like a pompous dumbass <br><br>Sasuga retard, you're a credit to the rest of your kind.</br></br></br></br></br>  いろはす～  <br>l..le...<br>lewd</br></br>  <br>No dick, don't do this to me</br>  Irohasu~  Would you like a Chiba Irohasu?<br><br>130 Yen, same price with Max Coffee</br></br>  <br> mfw Iroha is out of budget </br>  Here's a list of all interesting Iroha vids on Nico.<br>For those that don;t know how to use jap Nico or don't bother to.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br>  bump  <br>Are they actually putting those on the bottles? I was in Chiba 1.5 months ago. Wish I saw this shit.</br>  <br>No, but a man can dream.</br>  <br>If Coca Cola were going to go as far as doing an anime promo they wouldn't recycle old promo art for it.</br>  Reminder to stay hydrated  Irohasu~  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127505874 <br><br>Sasuga neo-/a/.</br></br>    <br>I think you mean summer.</br>  <br> Life of I Lohas </br>  <br>such eco friendly</br>  <br>But still gets crushed in the end.</br>  <br><br>Wait. What is on the right side? <br><br>I've read vol4 with the swimsuit cover. Not the one with Komachi and 8man. Are they supposed to be different?</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's the point.</br>  Sasuga irohabros don't let this thread die.<br><br>IROHA AKBAR<br><br>IROHA OR DEATH</br></br></br></br>  Man, what is wrong with this fanbase.  <br>I want Iroha to keep me hydrated.</br>  OTP  <br>withdrawal syndrome. We are too used to have b2b threads for 3 months straight that we can't stop creating threads now. <br><br>Hopefully it can be cure when the new season start.</br></br></br>  I'd rather have Yui or Iroha, or even Saki, winning over Yukino winning. It just seems so damn unfair to the other girls. I'm sure Yukino can solve her problems with or without help, but to have her become the love interest MC would just be so cliched and boring.   yahari, it's over. <br> still can't get my life out of /a/ <br> people force animeonly people to read between the line </br></br>   2nd season inspired by Atto's countryside slice-of-life manga debuts on July 6 <br> Non Non Biyori! </br>  <br>what does Ren-chon's butt smell like?</br>  I am so happy about next season!<br>This show made my life worth living.</br>  <br>Like candy shop.</br>  <br>Like onii-chan's cum.</br>   still no CR announcement <br><br>It's coming, r-right guys?</br></br>  <br>sorry about that.</br>  <br>I hope so, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Friendly reminder not to sexualize the Biyoris</br>  <br>You do realize IRC is gonna hit the NNB threads hard, pushing the Dragon Ball v. NNB agenda all season long and spamming sexualization of Biyoris in the NNB threads just like they did in 2013, right? Just ignore it this time around and continue happily discussing the show as if they aren't there.</br>  <br><br>Friendly reminder that Ren-chon was fighting in Vietnam.</br></br>  <br>autism and salty milk</br>  She told us two years in advance about the second season    Guys i think Ren Chon is TOO SEXY<br><br>is that possible?!

Broly can tear apart any Dragon Ball character since his power and hatred is always increasing non-stop, fact.    my impromptu haruhi thread was cut short so why don't we have a proper one here and now  She's a whore.  <br>her voice actor is a whore, haruhi herself is a pure maiden.</br>      <br>Nope.<br><br>Whore.</br></br></br>  <br>where is the proof</br>  Cute loli whore!  <br>do not a loli haruhi</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>but this isn't what haruhi looks like, fanart isn't canon<br><br>pic related the real haruhi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why?</br>  <br>My heart is big enough to love all Haruhis.</br>  <br>so essentially you are two-timing. what would haruhi (2009) think about this?</br>  <br>Best</br>  <br>It's highly illegal.</br>  <br>You got the one you used for the last OP?</br>  There is literally a board for this shit.<br>Sage.</br>  <br>But best Haruhi is 06 Haruhi.

No sense of how light and colour works and how to actually apply it in anime. Their execution and production values in general were just bad too.<br><br>Honestly if you can't get Kyoani, one of the only studios that actually seems to care for animation quality and production values anymore, then just leave it rest.<br>Best to leave it dead on a high note with the Disappearance movie. <br>Yuki-chan was just some shitty spin-off so it doesn't really count as a main series addition, thankfully.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post more Haruhi  <br> Tohsaka Haruhi. </br>  <br>Are you sure Haruhi is this wide, Anonymous?</br>  <br>Have some more crossover<br><br><br>I dunno, you tell me</br></br></br></br>  So which one will it be /a/?<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IQ5<wbr>dSwqSv3s</wbr>  [ ] bonus song, because you need to be reminded of it </br></br>  <br>I choose a VN that isn't shit.</br>    <br>Reported.</br>  <br>Scientists have agreed that one of them  PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY </br>  <br> mods will never be this based again </br>    <br>i want to commit a crime</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> /v/ sucks ass <br>Truly <br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you ever pick Ilya?

Shit son do you even watch cartoons? There is literally nothing wrong with her bodily proportions, she is just a big girl, can't you love her as she is?</br>  <br/>  <br>There's a Taiga look alike in latest Shiqasu doujin. Her scenes are hot as fuck.</br>  <br>I remember when these came out on an /a/ thread.<br>It was fun.<br><br>Time really flies by.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Got a link?<br> I really did google, I swear. </br></br>  <br> Finns aren't annunaki <br> There is literally nothing wrong with her bodily proportions <br>It's been scientifically proven that Luvia's facial proportions are not a match for those of the average Finnish human female, but closely resemble those of certain extra-terrestirial lifeforms.</br></br></br>  <br> that most <br>A handful.

What if I told you her friend was better.    Do you think all the girls in kill la kill wouldnt be so violent if they just received some d?  Yeah most girls who act like men are just sexually frustrated. A good dose of dicks should fix them,  <br>I'm pretty sure Nui gets fucked regularly.<br>Ryuko probably masturbates violently every night.<br>Satsuki never cums and refuses to engage in anything so disgusting.</br></br></br>  I wonder who gamagori will fuck with his huge samoan/black d<br>Mankanshoko Mako or haruhara haruko</br>  Do you think Kill la Kill would've been a good show if it wasn't directed by Imaishi?  <br>Do you think /a/ would've liked it better if it was less popular?</br>  <br>Being less popular wouldn't make it less bad.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> Satsuki never cums <br>Mommy disagrees.</br></br>  <br>Nui and Nonon are the only cute girls in the show, I'm pretty sure both could become sweet after a good, deep, loving dicking.</br>  I dunno, some girls IRL are violent SIMPLY because they received the D  through rape .  <br>that's how /a/ works dude</br>  <br> whip out your dick <br> bend over nonon, I'm gonna berry this so far up your ass that whoever pulls it out would be crowned king arthur <br> NANI SORE!? </br></br></br>  <br>Explains feminists</br>  <br>Doesn't explain the feminists involved in the whole gamergate thing. Wasn't their thing fucking reviewers?</br>  <br>I don't know about that. What's her face who fucked with all those journos apparently is a real mess to deal with, and she's been given doses of D on a regular basis, turning her other boyfriends into cucks. Not that she's particularly violent, but she ain't right in the head, is all I'm saying. What was her name, Dina or something?</br>  <br><br>the fuck are you guys even talking about?</br></br>  <br>Too long of a story, I ain't explaining it. If you weren't new to the internet you would at least know the basics.</br>  <br>Get out of your bubble, man. How can you not remember the thing which took 4chan by storm after poole made one of the stupidest statements ever around here, got involved in those socjust conventions, became the laughing stock of /pol/,/int/,/sp/ over that "luggage boy" meme, lashed out and defaced /pol/ for a while then announced he was quitting. <br><br>Pretty much anyone on the more populous boards would have known about it. It was massive. Sage for offtopic.</br></br></br>  <br> Ryuko probably masturbates violently every night. <br>Lewd.</br></br>  <br><br>I've been here daily on various boards for the better part of a decade, I may have heard of it but it never registered because it didn't impact anything we were talking about. Maybe it's cause I don't browse /v/. I don't browse other "popular" places on the internet though cause 4chan suits me well enough.<br><br>also sage for offtopic</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127492153 <br>What?</br>  <br>/tv/ shitpost meme.</br>  <br>Oh. Good to know I guess.</br>  You misspelled mako's mom  <br>Shameful ryuko was best ryuko<br>Too bad she became shameless around ep 11</br></br>  I want a blowjob from Nui. Just to find out what it's like.  <br> Shameful ryuko was best ryuko <br> Too bad she became shameless around ep 11 <br>She got used to it after wearing Senketsu after a couple times. The shame is still in there probably.</br></br></br>  <br>No, when she was fighting satsuki for the first time when satsuki used junketsu she made that realization about not holding back and putting all of her self, naked self into the fight. <br>The shame was pretty much gone</br></br>  <br>Well shoot. Now I'm liking shameful Ryuko even more now.</br>   Embarrassed and ashamed after first time in some dirty basement <br> Gets over embarrassment and establishes a real relationship out in the open <br> Becomes a better, more well adjusted person every time afterward and uses it to work out all her anger issues <br><br>At what point did you realize, this is already a story about a girl getting the d? <br> The man's name is a euphemism for popping a girl's cherry. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's name?</br>  <br> MFW </br>  <br>"Fresh blood"</br>  <br>I don't know who that is<br>I only watched the Japanese voice</br></br>  <br> Fresh Blood and Purity are arch enemies. </br>  <br>She names "Senketsu" as he needed her blood to awaken, "Fresh blood" is the translation.</br>  <br>But she broke up with him and became a well adjusted person<br>She was getting angrier and angrier when she spent time with him</br></br>  <br>Nonon are already sweet</br>  I want to make Nui cry  and then console her afterwards   <br>right in my heartballs</br>  <br>You mean she broke up with him and went on a drug fueled downward spiral until they got back together.</br>  I would like to thank you all for coming up with what has to be the most magical realm thread I have ever seen in all of my time browsing /a/. In fact, I would say that this goes BEYOND mere magical realm shit and is now something else entirely. A decade from now, I will be in bed, staring up at my ceiling in the dark and trying to force myself to go to sleep. And sleep will flee from me, because of the simple fact that someone on this planet actually took the time to post something like this to the internet where everyone could see it. Mere words cannot describe my feelings at present. No image can either. The sheer level of idiocy present here is beyond the capabilities of mortal man to express. Even with this wall of text I am spending my time writing, I am underplaying just how stupid what I just read was. Please. Just fucking stop. Please. For my sake, for your sake, and for the whole of humanity. Stop.  <br>Haha.</br>  the only "d" satsuki needs is ryuko's  <br>Like sticking your dick in a ball of yarn</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> drug fueled <br>Nope<br>She found out she wasn't fully human and broke up with him far before she got injected with junketsu</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's exactly what it says, she broke up with him and then went on a drug fueled downward spiral. Then they got back together.</br>  Did anyone notice in the first few transformations ryuko only has a thong on but in later transformations she has panties under her thing  <br>But the original statement implied she settled down after getting back with him<br><br>She doesn't settle down she's still a raging cunt until senketsu dies and everybody separates</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because she's not a raging cunt. She didn't have any hate afterward, she even asks Ragyo to come home.<br><br><br>Weaketsu doesn't have any of the teeth growing out of his skirt like true Senketsu does. Pretty sure that's what the panties are suposed to be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some big fucking underwear.</br>  <br>Nah, most of the appeal is that all the main girls were gay</br>  <br>Really?</br>  Satsuki is the only decent character in Kill la Kill.  I still want to ruffle best girl's hair.   Ryuuko gets brainwashed so that she thinks she grew up with Ragyo her whole life <br> first thing she does is make out with Nui <br> implying she wasn't sexually attracted to Nui before the brainwashing and just couldn't bring herself to express it <br> could have avoided most of the second half of the show and saved Senketsu's life if she had just waifu'd Nui in the first place </br></br></br>  <br> implying Ragyo didn't ship them and decided to play match maker </br>  <br>I get you're just shitposting, but I feel I need to explain since I'm a little tipsy right now, there are two Ryuko's, the real one living a fantasy where she marries the life fibers, and the Junketsu Puppet which is just like Ragyo. And she only saved Senketsu in her heart by keeping Nui out of it.</br>  <br>Why does her hair do that? Is she a wild beast? Is she super saiyan?</br>  <br> Why does her hair do that? Is she a wild beast? Is she super saiyan? <br>Nah.

She's so gentle that she wouldn't even raise her hand against a mosquito.</br>  <br> Will will never be pinned down by extra hairy Devilman Lady Ryuko <br><br>Why bother?</br></br></br>  <br> Don't be like that. She's so gentle that she wouldn't even raise her hand against a mosquito. <br> doubt.jpeg <br><br>Oh, my. I guess there are only dreams. I'd still like regular Ryuko.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>It would still be regarded as shit, but at least the word "fun" wouldn't be considered a buzzword nowadays.<br><br>KLK was partially responsible for that.</br></br></br></br></br>   harime nui was given birth in a yarn pod <br> her dad was the giant ball of yarn <br> her mother was the yarn pod <br> nui resembles a human not yarn </br></br></br>  <br><br> LOL THAT ANIME IS FOR KIDS <br><br>They are all for kids idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously, Ragyo's DNA is in the mix.</br></br>  <br> Now I've lost it, I know I can kill </br>  <br>She looks nothing like ragyo</br>  <br>She has the same ahoge as Ryuko.</br>  <br> I just remenbered that fucking thread about primary colors. <br>Goddammit that was one of the most autistic moments of /a/</br></br>  <br>What<br>Color wars? <br><br>Blue was best girl</br></br></br></br>  I want satsuki to sit on my face  <br>I would rather have my face between Ryuko's tits.</br>  <br> Junketsu puppet <br> Junketsu made her kiss nui, call Satsuki all those sister names, make fun of all her old friends, and talk about how shitty her life had been up to that point  <br><br>That. Does not. Make. Sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you now realize that Nui had multiple chances to viciously murder Mako, Mako's family, Satsuki, the Elite Four, and Ryuuko but never did <br> all she ever wanted was her sister/waifu to love her <br> she only murdered her shitty father that left her behind and almost killed Mako because she was a love rival </br></br></br>  <br>It's like Ragyo. The real Ryuko is trapped inside her own head. Junketsu has no personality of its own, but it's controlling her.</br>  <br>Nui wasn't related to the dad at all</br>  <br>Says who?</br>  <br> super saiyan ryuuko <br> sounds awesome af <br><br>Aw shit nigga, off to a drawfag thread I go.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nui Harime not Nui Kiryuin </br>  how often do ryuko and satsuki purify each other now that they have a lot of time to waste? I say twice a day  <br> mvq </br>  <br> imbliygn miss "eaten out by her mother on a daily basis" is pure </br>  <br>Did you even watch the anime?</br>  <br>Did you not watch the ending or something?</br>  <br>Oh shiiiiiit right. I'm a dumbass.<br><br>It's totally not the same thing though. That was super senketsu or something. Yeah. I'm gonna stick with that excuse.<br><br>Ugh I'm just gonna go rewatch the series again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gross<br>I bet you rewatched guilty crown too</br></br>  <br>wow clearly this single feature they have in common means they are like unto fucking twins</br>  <br>She wasn't fit for Ryuko's love. Her arms were too weak.</br>   ryuko and satsuki wont start a happy family together <br>kill me, they'd make a cute couple</br>  <br>Incest. That is all. All I don't think Satsuki would go lesbian due to molestation at the hands of Disco Mom.</br>  <br>Confused me why they didn't live together<br><br>Ryuko literally goes off with mako's family<br>Like.. The fuck</br></br></br></br>   You will never tease Ryuko until she blushes <br>Why live?</br>  <br>Cause there's like 20gb worth of lewd hentai games I own</br>  <br> are you sure about this? <br> We can see each other whenever we like. <br><br>Ryuko an mako still need to graduate and their going to Rin high. Sats has to sort out The family business in Tokyo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Anon you sound like you're doing fine. I think I'm just going to go to bed and hope for a Ryuko dream.</br>  <br>I thought they graduated highschool on that last episode<br><br>Also I don't think you know how ages work in Japan and Korea<br>They're aged from when they're in the womb<br><br>If ryuko is 17 in Japanese age system then she is either 18 or 19 in American aging system</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there is literally 0 reason to have a bigger than 3 inch dick</br>  <br> Ryuko! <br><br> Mako! <br><br> We just found out where we're transferring to! It's Rinne-do High in Kanagawa Prefecture! We'll be going to the same school again! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn how fucking stupid is ryuko?</br>  <br>To be fair her heads gone through some shit, she was already a delinquent before the mind rape as it was.</br>  <br>Well, it's not her strong suit anyway. Thinking that is.</br>  <br><br>Ya and she's a fucking slut bitch</br></br>    I'm so tired of you fucking faggots trying to justify your stupid fetishes by twisting the girls' characters into something they're not.<br><br> Ryuko is angry all the time <br> SOME DICK SHOULD CALM HER DOWN <br> Satsuki is stoic and unfeeling <br> MY LOVE WILL FREE HER EMOTIONS <br> Nonon is a stuck-up cunt <br> SHE'LL BE HUMBLED AFTER I FUCK HER <br><br>You dumbass fanfiction motherfuckers are no better than Tumblr. If you really loved them, you would love them for who they were and not what you pretend them to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like the fact that Ryuko is angry all the time, it makes when she's sweet even nicer </br>  <br> are you a loner virgin or some shit? <br>Having someone pretty genuinely love you makes you calm the fuck down<br><br>After all, Ryuko couldn't sheathe her blade until Satsuki showed her love to her</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Feminists usually have no problems getting sex, especially compared to their red piller counterparts.<br><br>If your problems stem from being from being lonely, some attention might do you some good.<br><br>If your problems stem from being an over-entitled childish brat with an ego to rival Jupiter, the best guy or girl in the world couldn't save you. It doesn't help that they tend to choose enablers as their boyfriends, as compared to guys who are sane enough to recognize the double standards and subsequently have a bold enough personality to not just let it go.<br><br> girls crave romance more than sex <br><br>Feminism has done a great job at ensuring that there's no benefit for the men when it comes to relationships. Special attention and love from your partner? They want the man to treat her like a lady and make her feel special, but they roll their eyes and laugh at the prospect of going out of their way to pamper him. Socially? The role of the husband and father has been robbed of all masculinity and respect. You're some kind of weird cross between Homer Simpson and an impotent bitch. That's how society sees you, and expects you to behave. Especially the feminists, who lead the charge in shitting on masculinity and trying to rig the game so that men are powerless against women in relationships. Legally? Marriage and children are likely to end in financial rape for the man and lots of free money for the woman, via divorce settlements and child support. It's a risk that's just not worth it on any level. How is it any sort of mystery that men aren't willing to commit?<br><br>But nope. HURRR DURRR WHY BUY THE COW WHEN THE MILK IS FREE WE NEED TO PUNISH THE MEN MORE THAT WILL DO IT<br><br>Basically, the ones who are spouting feminist garbage are often the ones most guilty of causing the social issues that they complain about, including their inability to find a man who will settle down with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the problem is you underestimate the power of the dick.</br>  <br>This nigga knows</br>  <br><br>Samefag<br>Prob shrimpdick</br></br></br>  <br>BRAVO TRIGGER</br>  Seriously why does she suddenly have panties on during senketsu transformations like from episode 14 or something  Get hype!<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-02/trigger-teases-new-pro<wbr>ject-and-new-inferno-cop-little-wit<wbr>ch-academia-crossover-short/.90008</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> Get hype! <br>Stop!</br></br>  <br> inferno cop/LWA crossover <br>This'll be fun.</br></br>   Think "This has to be bullshit" <br> Check ANN <br><br>...Well fuck.</br></br></br>  YEEARRTT! oh wait sry.   Inferno Cop x LWA crossover <br>holy shit, that would be awesome</br>  In a college debate class, a Shaftfag and a Kyoanusfag were debating which was the superior studio.<br><br>"Shaft isn't technically an anime studio!"<br><br>"At least their faces don't all look the same!"<br><br>Just then a brave Trigger fan who had bought over 1500 KLK figurines and fully understood the necessity of Inou Battle stood up and held up what appeared to be a rock. "How old is this rock, bakas?" he asked.<br><br>"O-Haruhi-sama created it 9 years ago, ahou," said the Kyoanusfag.<br><br>"No, Godoka created it 4 years ago, and Homucifer recreated it 1.5 years ago," said the Shaftfag.<br><br>"Wrong! This is actually a bundle of Life Fibers created by based Trigger 2 years ago! If it were created by Godoka or Homucifer it would be tilting its head by now, and if it were created by Haruhi it would have evolved the Kyoanus sameface by now!" he said.<br><br>The two students were visibly shocked, dropped their unsold Tamako Market and Sasami-san DVD's, and ran out of the room crying their crocodile tears. The same tears Shaftfags cry in joy and Kyoanusfags cry in sadness, still thinking that sales=quality.<br><br>The student applauded and quit to enroll in Honnouji Academy that day. "Before My Body Is Dry" was sung several times, and a Goku uniform labeled 'Savior of Animu' landed on the flag and shed a tear on a discarded uniform. Ragyo Kiryuuin herself appeared to offer everyone free Goku uniforms.<br><br>The two debators lost their tuition and were expelled the next day. They died when they were betrayed by their clothing, and Inferno Cop himself showed up to personally take them to the lake of fire for eternity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Got to see it at Animenext, it was pretty good.</br>  She is going to summon her Servant  Now, will it be done in the same style as Inferno Cop, the same style as LWA, or a mixture of both?  <br>I'm wary of getting hyped for the new series. Hopefully it'll be original. I'm still waiting for the day that Imaishi tops TTGL.<br><br>Any idea how Trigger is doing financially these days? Last I heard they were raking in dough from Kill La Kill's BDs.</br></br></br>    <br>seems like this guy hate fun.<br>I like Trigger because they seem to not give much of a fuck.</br></br>  <br> Getting excited for the animation in an ONA </br>  <br>I want Nui to hug me so tight I start to bleed.</br>  <br><br>I want to watch Nui bleed out in a gutter after being raped by sixty niggers.</br></br>  People described the new show teaser as Persona-ish, Persona-like and "looks like Persona".  <br>That's fine too. As long as Nui is involved I'm happy.</br>  <br><br>I'll care if its not just another hyped up Aniplex produced clusterfuck. Please no Sawanos.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes cause Trigger publishes all its discs all by its lonesome right</br></br>  <br>Mako with guns?</br>  None of trigger's work outside of LWA are within a country mile of the production values they had while working at Gainax.  <br> hype! <br> Inferno Cop </br></br>  <br>Post the character designs for the new show so my dick knows how to feel about it</br>    Main girl looks like Panty and Mako fucked and had a baby  <br>If it looks anything like I have in my head I don't hate it</br>   The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br>Fucking Westaboos.<br><br>JAPAN MADE YOU TRIGGER NOT AMERIFATS<br><br>JAPAN<br><br>JAPAN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spoilers <br><br> <br> inferno cop stumbled upon the academia <br> meets sucy <br> its inferno cop vs sucy <br> lotte got roasted <br> inferno cop and sucy join forces for justice <br> sucy is a shuriken <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>They know their audience. They know who funded LWA2.</br>  <br>Fucking saved.</br>  <br>In a college debate classroom, a delusional Shaftfag and a narcissist, elitist Kyoanusfag were debating which studio was best.<br><br>"Kyoani shows sold over 300,000 from 2002 to 2009! And they deserve all the circlejerking because their artwork is objectively the best!" said the Kyoanusfag.<br><br>"Well, fewer Shaft shows sold over 200,000 between 2009 and 2013, so that's more bang for your buck! And at least Shaft faces don't all look the same!" said the Shaftfag.<br><br>Just then a brave Production IG fan who had bought over 1500 SnK figurines (and even some for Gargantia) and a limited-edition replica Dominator and fully understood the necessity of Titan Shifters stood up and held up some artwork.<br><br>"Could you tell me what this is, bakas?" he said.<br><br>"Sure, the one on the right is some oil rigs at sea, and the one on the left is the Tokyo skyline," said the Kyoanusfag.<br><br>"Wrong! Those are backgrounds from, respectively, Gargantia and Ghost in the Shell. If they were Kyoanusshit they'd be scanned photos with Photoshop lighting effects and blurring added, and if they were Shaftshit they'd be the zero-depth-and-shading 2-D backgrounds that might have looked cool the first time around in Bakemonogatari but now just look overused, pretentious, and cheap."<br><br>The two debators were visibly shaken, and dropped their unsold Tamako Market and Sasami-san DVDs. They ran out of the room crying their weeaboo crocodile tears. The same tears Shaftfags cry in joy and Kyoanusfags cry in sadness because everyone "knows" sales=quality.<br><br>The students applauded and all went out and bought as many SnK and Psycho Pass DVDs as they could find. "Out of Control" was sung many times, Amy and her two slutty friends themselves appeared before the classroom and belly-danced for everyone.<br><br>The debators lost their tuition and were expelled the next day. Akane Tsunemori found that one's Hue had gone dark and he needed to be "dominated", and the other was eaten by a Titan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryuko and Mako are in the crossover,too? Where the fuck is Ninja slayer, Nancy and Yukino then?</br>  <br>If trigger were to scrap LWA2 and do a feature length version of the original it would make millions of dollars at the box office in the US. <br>It's exactly the sort of animation that Americas are culturally used to. If they were to pay for a decent dub it would <br>The typical 5th place box office in the US is equivalent to Japan's first. They don't even have to hit it out of the park.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja Slayer is fucking garbage</br>  <br>like your taste normalfag</br>  <br>Inferno Cop is fucking garbage</br>   Inferno Cop x Little Witch Academia crossover <br>ANIME IS SAVED</br>  <br>What is the original for this one?</br>  Well triggerniggers eat every shit trigger throw to them, so at least someone would enjoy it.  <br>Trying to hard there</br>  <br>cuppy pls</br>  <br> Trigger wants to shit all over its only good franchise with EBIN COPPU NANI shit. <br>Good job.</br></br>  <br>Oh oh!</br>  I-Is it still happening?  I was at anime expo just today and the nee started out with generic trigger sushio drawn characters with a green? Haired mc and blonde girl and it ended with a shot of a bridge. The video was like 4 sec long  <br>At the trigger panel they**</br>  <br>Sounds epic.</br>   inferno cop and little witch academia crossover <br> Question is, which animation style will they use? </br>  <br>On the panel they used inferno copu art and literally everyone, even the directors at the panel lost their shit laughing.</br>  <br> Flaseflag <br>kill yourself IRC</br></br>  <br>I am the Internet Relay Chat. Fear me.</br>  <br>Well they the shitposting Jews that they are</br>  <br>It should be happening today.</br>  <br>There's already a thread for this, you know.</br>  <br>I hope so.

I never really found it that sad.<br>Pic related</br></br>  Any VHS friends here?  I miss the 90's. I miss summer breaks.  Literal proof of oldfaggotry.<br><br>The first animu I watched was on VHS. That was back around 1997. I seen shit like GitS, Akira, Ninja Scroll, Wicked City, Biohunter, etc. Those were interesting times.

None of it's localized shit, either.</br></br>  <br>This is the first time I've seen a collection on here that actually makes me jealous. Kudos.</br>  <br>I'm sure moot posted his laser disc collection here once. Anyone have that picture saved?</br>  <br><br>I want your LDs. Pray that I never find out who you are, because I will come to your house and take them if I ever do.</br></br>  Goddamn, I don't even remember where I kept my VHSs.<br><br>I had a lot of the Dragonball Z ones</br></br>  <br> have 500+ vhs and dvd collection of anime and obscure movies <br> every cover stinks of mold and has rotten away in the damp as fuck basement of my mother house <br>fuck</br></br></br>  <br> Riding Bean <br>Where did you get this</br></br>  <br>I have my VHSes stuffed away in a box at my parent's attic.

I almost bought Black Magic M-66 LD... also that project A-ko one....here's the only LD's and VHS I own. Still need to buy a LD player too....</br>    I remember watching Tank Police and Akira on VHS back in the 80s. I don't still own any tapes though, because they fucking suck.<br><br><br> Have you tried watching those?

There's nothing better than SVHS with a time base corrector. What's this DVD shit? Next you're going to tell me my man Slick Willie's getting impeached. <br><br>I am so ashamed of myself.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah a friend of mine today said he was going to watch Evangelion for the first time and I told him he could borrow my copies.<br><br>Sadly he doesn't have a VCR.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A while back I was reading old anime usenet archives, and I found DVD discussion before DVD actually came out. So many people talking about how DVD is going to bomb and how they're sticking to VHS.</br></br>   2015 <br> ever having tapes <br>Go back to 2000 oldshit</br></br>  <br> laser disk <br>Holy shit, I always knew I was a new fag, but this is the first time hearing of laser disks.<br>Were they expensive to buy?<br>I owned/own a lot of VHS tapes so how did I miss this transition?</br></br></br></br>  The only anime VHS I used to own were the old Sailor Moon ones.<br><br>I had the random DIC release ones from season 1, the Doom Tree arc and the 3 movies (both ENG dub and the JP subtitled)<br><br>Too bad I gave them away years ago. I can't believe I pay like $100 for fucking VHS back in the day.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127501277 <br> -_- <br>FUCK OFF</br></br>  <br>still have most of them,tucked away; including my first proper hentai anime.</br>  <br>Laserdiscs were popular before VHS.</br>  <br>No this is the japanese release. i dont think it had anything like that. The american laser disc lacked any special features, IIRC. <br><br>here's one with minnie may dollars.</br></br></br>  I used to buy the actual VHS until I discovered my local Chinatown. $5 p/tape? Never looked back after that.  We just don't get artwork on DVD/BDs anymore like they used to for LDs.  <br>They're the anime man's vinyl.</br>  <br>Are those the annoying plastic VHS boxes that the had at video rental stores?<br><br>I fucking hate those.</br></br></br>  <br>They're better than the shitty cardboard sleeves that you Americans have. In Australia we got plastic boxes for the majority of our VHS releases, and the American cardboard sleeves for blank VHS tapes or low budget releases like Christian animations and shit like that. Coincidentally, the VHS tapes in the plastic cases have lasted longer than the ones in the cardboard sleeves.</br>  I have VHS of subbed Tenchi yet still have not watched more than probably 3 eps of the franchise to this day. I also have never bothered with Evangelion, unless fapping counts. Never watched 79, but have watched some 70s mecha.  reminder that clamp a shit even two decades later<br>rayearth op is ok with me though</br>  <br> Posts a meme picture <br>WOW as they say.</br></br>  <br>Okay newfriend.</br>  <br><br>And better quality than even DVD since the video is uncompressed analogue and all.</br></br>  <br><br>LDs are like LPs on all of the steroids. Super rare, discontinued, but still have that charm of really interacting with the medium and of course the enormous cover art.</br></br>   people who worked on your old chinese cartoons left the business, got hit with sickness, or are now dead   <br>A lot of bands still produce vinyl.</br>  <br>Personally, I always preferred the plastic to the cardboard. The cardboard wears easily, the plastic doesn't.</br>   you missed out on the glorious days of VHS anime <br>The only anime I was aware of as a kid was just whatever was on TV, but I was damn hungry for whatever was on, no matter what insane hour of the night it was on. I didn't even know what Evangelion was but I sure as hell knew what Betterman and Dual! Parallel Adventures were. The very first anime I watched on physical media were some Robotech DVDs that a friend let me borrow and I loved it.</br>  The only anime I still have on VHS is Master of Mosquiton OVA. It was the first anime I bought and so I mostly keep it for sentimental value. The show itself is awful though. <br><br>Also, for you guys who collect LD, what's the purpose?</br></br>  <br>Grandpa why are you still awake?</br>  I had pokemon ones but don't even know where they are. <br>Probably in a box</br>  <br> not betamax </br>  I think I might also have a few Pokemon and Yugioh ones in a box somewhere.  I have a sealed copy of Eva Genesis 0:12  <br>So how does the blu-ray player read those discs? There's no way they fit</br>  I have a Fatal Fury bootleg VHS, does that count?<br>It was my uncle's, but I stole it from him about 12 years ago</br>  Don't have pictures on-hand but I've got all three Violence Jack OVAs uncut, a dubbed Iczer-One tape, a subbed volume of Fist of the North Star, the Ocean dub tape of Tree of Might, and all three volumes of an OVA called Burning Blood on Japanese VHS.  <br>What's the bottom left one with the Alfa Romeo?</br>  <br>Riding Bean. <br><br>Worth a watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, I'll give it a watch.</br>  hocked these on Ebay a few months ago,  <br>My Slayers tapes look better than the English credits on Funi's DVD release.<br>I don't know how they fucked that up so bad.</br></br>  <br>I have a little bit of Evangelion on VHS somewhere, but just on the blank tapes that I recorded shows on to watch later and rewatch.</br>  Shit pic, but still holding on to my collection.  Disney case master race.  <br>Laserdiscs were never popular anywhere outside of east asia. They existed, but they didn't catch on like VHS did. VHS also existed before laserdiscs.</br>  <br>I think my couses fucking stole my S movie VHS. She probably threw it away, too. That one was my favorite. You're missing the R, though.</br>  I'm probably younger than most people in this thread. I have this, Digimon, Pokemon, and Yugioh episodes. No complete sets, but I still have the ancient mew card. <br><br> people born in the 90s can post on 4chan now </br></br>  <br> BAOH <br>How long have you had that?</br></br>  <br><br>Probably 12-15 years?

I liked the idea. Also it's better than the Traitor field, that's one of the worst of my old version, I don't even understand why you kept it. So I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine and made the free space Vocaloid.</br></br></br>  <br> I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine <br>Making it unnecessarily difficult.<br><br>Vocaloid is dumb.<br>They're dolls not robots.<br>We don't even know if they're singing.<br>We know they already have seiyuu.<br>Making the audience listen to shitty vocaloid speaking voices all the time would be a terrible decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also the traitor field is fine.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if one of them defects. It won't be the dolls, and it won't be what's-her-face.<br>Elfnine being a traitor is a good, plausible, and simple one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tama's voice through a shitty robot filter <br>Just kill my ears.</br></br>  <br>Elfnein isn't a doll.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I thought she was the playing the red one for some reason.</br>  <br>Not difficult, it just says Elfnine is Fine. She's the most likely candidate.<br><br><br>Point taken, guess I just wanted it worded differently now, like "Elfnine Defects" would be more clear.<br><br>She's really the mysterious one, whose role and actions can't really be predicted yet.<br><br>Anyway, I'll leave the bingo alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's the most likely candidate. <br>True enough.<br><br>I'm pretty worried about whether her seiyuu can pull off a serious character.<br>Her design really doesn't suit such a squeaky cute voice. Maybe she has more range than I'm aware of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She voiced Cerebrum in Geneitaiyo, she'll be fine.</br></br>    Nana a lewd.  <br> believe in justice and hold a determination to fist </br>  Official relationship charts of S1 and G.

Dumping from mobile at work</br>  <br> I'm curious how the heck Bonple will ,,show" anything to schools like Pravda or Kuromorimine. <br>Simple. The major schools simply would under-fund Tankathon because they are better off spending resources on the main Senshado league. We already saw how Saunders refused to officially support Team Thunder. The same likely applies with the German and Soviet schools. Basically the big guns don't care about the minor competition, but this leaves the poorer schools in a better position. Bonple is unusual in that the school isn't poor at all, but they are not able to compete with the big schools because, according to their bio, they couldn't procure heavier tanks due to politicall arguments on the tank choices.<br><br>So Bonple in this manga is a well funded school who are stuck with light tanks only, thus making them a threat to the protagonists.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, from what little I saw of new info it seems Tankathon is proud of its rulelss nature. So Eggs might just be pointing out that the Tankathon might have weight limits, but its less rigid rules better imitates warfare compared to the sterile and heavily regulated Senshado.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cdq<wbr>oNKCCt7A</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>Pepperoni is so hotblooded.</br>  <br><br><br>Perfectly so.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why we like her!</br>  <br>Then i still wonder why Bonple does not focus entirely on Tanlathlon.<br>Taking part in the Senshado-tournament is almost hopeless for them then, even Anzio and Oarai could run through them with the P40 or Porsche Tiger. <br>Yaika seems to be very proud, so why doesn't she focus on the thing she really can shine in?

And it is still important to attend Senshado, just because even attending is in itself a big deal in keeping themselves relevant.

Sure, she had the hardware advantage, but so did everyone else in the championships except Anzio.</br></br>  <br>aye, that be true</br>  <br>And here she is, Kilimanjaro from West Kure Prince Glohna (?) high, platinum member of the Darjeeling fanclub</br>  <br> Senshado legal. <br>so only WW-2 tank?</br></br>  <br> And here she is, Kilimanjaro from West Kure Prince Glohna (?) high, platinum member of the Darjeeling fanclub <br>Wot, so it is a creepy fangirl who imitates Darjeeling. This would be fun...</br></br>  <br>Wait, it's not Darjeering but fangirl?</br>  <br> West Kure <br>And it seems she isn't even from St Gloriana, so I guess she is from one of the other Commonwealth nation schools? Makes sense, the British Empire spreads wide.</br></br>  <br><br> Not Darjeeling <br><br>The Hype is less real now...</br></br></br></br>  <br>EMPIRE PRIDE WORLD WIDE</br>  <br>what an unexpected twist. but at least Darjeeling's reputation remains unsullied</br>  <br>British empire super team when?</br>  <br> what an unexpected twist. but at least Darjeeling's reputation remains unsullied <br>Yeah, at least with this new girl we can have her be defeated without making Darjeeling look weak. And there really was a lot of Commonwealth nations, St Glorianna can't represent them all alone.</br></br>  <br>good I want to see schools with the Ram II, the sentinel and the bob semple tank.</br>  any of you guys watched the anime after playing the game? This anime is pretty /k/.<br><br>I only wish I found this, before strike witches left a bad taste in my mouth.</br></br>  <br>And just to dig deeper, the girl is named after Mt Kilimanjaro (famed in the Monty Python sketch) and is mostly likely from a school based on Ghana of Africa.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana<wbr>_%28Commonwealth_realm%29</wbr></br></br>  <br>pic derp</br>  <br>This Reminds me, Do you guys have a list for good WW1/WW2 anime?<br><br>So far I have<br>Valkyria chronicles. <br>Strike witches<br>Pumpkin scissors<br>Girls und panzer<br><br><br>Nothing else comes to mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the only thing good about valkyries anime was alicia reaction faces<br>it was more forgettable than c3bu<br><br>sore uhh soramirez do everything i forgot what the actual name was but it accurately depicted military life<br>nothing fucking happened ever</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sora no Woto<br>it was pretty poo.</br></br>    <br>Got any of those?</br>  <br>Looks like the girl is pissed off because she was expecting the real Darjeeling, and feel like she was defrauded.</br>    <br>Axis Powers Hetalia has some ww2 and ww1 scenes but there is more than its fair share of yaoi moments (unless that is your cup of tea). If you ever watch it don't talk to fans of it most are insane, and when watching I recommend that you buy some scotch or rum beforehand you may need it.</br>  <br>Oh there's also the joke that both West Kure and Gloriana get shortened to "Sei Glo"</br>  <br>Well, sounds like a great anime to watch it a  friend  Me and a  bud  watched all 200 episodes of sailor moon together over skype. It was fun, much alcohol was consumed.</br>    <br>some parts are fun to watch with or without the booze and you can find out some strange trivia some of it weapons related but you may need to double check some of the facts just to be safe. but the point about the fandom is as true as it gets. my advice skip the chibitallia (young north Italy) bits but that's just personal preference. gif is England after a night out on the piss.</br>      <br>Shut up and take my Visa!</br>    <br>moar</br>      <br>i dont have the anime saved on my hd so im swiping these of google but the anime was full of reactions<br>it was a fad for awhile</br></br>        <br><br>fuck ya thanks</br></br>  <br>looks like we got ourselves a match hooray</br>  <br>Mainly because both are just SPORTS. Even if a few schools are so obsessed upon a sport that the whole school revolves around it, they might be just "an extracurricular that som alumni choose" for others. Think the intense rowboat racing rivalty betwen Oxford and Cambridge for an exampel. Does any other university anywhere in the world actually fucking CARE about their rowboat racing teams?</br>  <br> can't you fight them faire and square instead of using the Intel I gathered? </br></blockquote>]
