[ Hey /a/, can we talk about delinquent manga?<br>What's your favorite series? Are there any good newer manga out right now or is it a dead genre? Why are pompadours objectively great?</br>  <br>That one show about the inner workings of the Yakuza.<br><br> Protip: You won't find it </br></br></br>  I really should get back to watching the rest of uh...<br>Something something westgate park</br>  I don't read much of the... genre? I guess, but really liked QP, and I need to read Crows one of these days.  <br>so this isn't a thing? I wish it was, there is a drastic lack of Yakuza anime</br>  Aoi Haru  Clover is pretty fun.  We need Sun-ken rock as anime for fucks sake. Don't know how they would handle the sexscenes thou  <br>Josuke is cutest JoJo.</br>  I just torrented Cromartie High School, Kyou Kara Ore Wa, and Sakigake Otokojuku. I've heard really good things about them, have any of you guys read it? Also, here's a recommendation chart  <br> Kyou Kara Ore Wa is pretty solid, totally worth a read</br>  <br>Mitsuhashi best delinquent and MC.</br>  Does Angel Densetsu count? Loved that manga.  <br>Cromartie made me laugh for days</br>  <br>Despite only a tiny fraction of it being translated, Rokudenashi Blues is the best delinquent manga. Rookies is also properly amazing, damn why is Morita so fucking based.<br><br>I think it is a dead genre now though, no one seems to really care about it that much. I think of many succesful modern delinquent manga which aren't continuation of old stuff.<br><br><br>All three are very good. Cromartie's humour is more non-sequiter style whereas KKOW is more slapstick. <br><br>I really liked Sakigake!! Otokojuku because it was so outrageously over the top all the time and was full of MANLY moments and cool characters, the best being the principal Edajima Heihachi (whose spin-off manga is also excellent).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gokusen kinda deals with that since the MC is the granddaughter of a yakuza boss.</br>  Do any of these delinquent series have overt romantic elements?  <br>Honestly I don't understand how someone could make something as good and funny as Angel Densetsu and then waste it all on an action manga that became your typical shonen manga after a while.<br><br>I really loved Sakigake until it became just pages of moves explanation, literally walls of text to explain the moves, that was a bit much so I never finished it.</br></br></br>  <br>I've actually always wanted to read Rokudenashi Blues, but I can never find it anywhere. It looks amazing but just like the prequel to GTO, I can never find a download</br>  So does a single good translation of Diamond is Unbreakable exist? Shit like "2" instead of "too" is just inexcusable. I might as well be reading a google translated version.  <br>Actually, yes. The Invincible Trio finished translating it last year.</br>  <br>Yes,  has a lot and it is an excellent comedy delinquent manga, I like it more than Cromartie, KKOW and GTO.<br><br>Rokudenashi Blues also has it. <br><br><br>The crazy styles did get really out of hand near the end but the first half of the manga was really good. Some of my favourite moments were J revealing his heritage and Toramaru Ryuuji fucking jumping into a fucking burning lake to fight a guy.<br><br>But the absolute best was the Man-To-Man Suspension Bridge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what is baka-updates</br>  <br>I held off on it because I like reading completed series but I buckled when I had nothing new to read. Best decision I have recently made, it's amazing. Also the artwork is ridiculous but I think Morita is a known art prodigy from even as earlier as his days working on Fist of the North Star.<br><br>Also read Rookies, I'd say it is almost as good as Rokudenashi Blues.</br></br></br>  Ocha Nigosu started off kinda good, but became a drag later on. I dropped it after they went to the zen retreat. The characters and relationships weren't going anywhere and the comedy lost its charm.  <br>where did you find it?</br>  <br>Mangatraders for everything translated up until now.<br><br>Crazy Delinquents and Shit Scans are putting out new chapters at a Berserk tier pace.</br></br></br>  Gungrave  Crows and Kyou kara Ore Wa!!  What are some good delinquent anime?  <br>I can't think of that many full length series adaptations, most of them have OVAs or films though.<br><br>Cromartie High School anime was great because of the VAs but they cut a lot of hilarious stuff. GTO was really good but had a lot of shitty filler near the end. It's not a traditional delinquent anime as such but Ashita no Joe's anime was aamzing.</br></br></br>  Hey guys, I've been thinking.<br><br>Do you ever think that...Mechazawa's kinda different?</br></br>  <br>He's certainly a lot smarter than the rest of us</br>  <br>I've noticed it too, he is really hot-blooded, but has an emotional side too. It's like he-, wait... i-is he oiling himself?</br>  <br>I don't think there are any anime, but there are a few Yakuza centric manga. Sanctuary comes to mind.</br>  <br>Not him but I can't really find Sanctuary english-translated except on mangafox. Mangatraders doesn't have it either and Batoto just has the Portuguese and Turkish scans.</br>  <br>U avin a gig? it's even on shitty sites like mangareader</br>  <br>You can get it from Bakabt as well.</br>  Holyland<br>Kyou Kara Ore<br>Crows</br></br>  Mikan's episode in 5 hours<br><br>Episode 03:<br>Part of the chapter 02<br>Chapter 03<br>Chapter 04<br>Part of the chapter 08</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Damnit, I just want more delicious Kansai-ben    Tanning problem related pic  <br><br>Let's visit the sick related pics</br></br>  Mikan's ahegao face is failed  <br>Like your English.</br>  Mikan's ahegao face is really failed  Who Orange here?  <br> Who Orange here? <br>in english?</br></br>  <br> Implies English <br> Can't bother to capitalize <br><br>HUE!</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a lot to fit in 20 minutes</br>  <br>Is her voice this bad in the manga though?</br>  <br>stop this</br>  <br>So when does it air? And are there any streams?</br>   Up to date on the manga. <br> I can't believe the progression, so use to nothing-happening shit like nisekoi. </br>  <br>It was absolutely wonderful in more than one way.</br>  connect is dead and neet doesn't seem to be playing it. what are you guys using  <br>neet is playing it.

What did people think about the skip to Chapter 5?<br><br> It really seemed like a good idea considering that the first few chapters took a while to get going <br><br> I mean, it's actually good that they're initially moving away from the Manga <br><br> I hope they don't keep doing it before? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck? they switched directly to chapter 04.... and they are changing the story and the order.... DROPED  glasses-kun was pretty annoying early on. I think she gets better when they get to the public pool?  was Alium stoping mikan in the manga? what the fuck are they doing?    man, these are some old school sfx  they changed everything, fuck them    Bishoujo wasn't suppose to happen before Ninjagirl   Orange will lose the eromineb owl <br>dropped</br>  Middle's pic episode   Fuku-chan already <br><br>Okay, that's a change that I don't like. For the rest, an okay episode.</br></br>  it wasn't suposed to happen there, this episode is SHIT, they fucked everything  1 cour direction, pacing kinda weird with the whole one character introduction per episode, old school animation style and lots of corner cutting techniques used. It's only episode 3 and I can already see this show heading straight into the bargain bin.   /a/ making a fuzz about it for some time now <br> loko like some generic harem shit <br> gets an anime <br> deside to check the manga <br> IS GOOD AND SHIT ACTUALLY HAPPENS <br>I'm so sorry, and I'm so late to the party...</br></br></br></br></br>    The episode 03 is really bad, i begin to fear about dumon  <br>Hope you enjoy the ride, it's never too late.</br>  <br>It's the DESPAIR parts that always gets me.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128348703 <br>Get the fuck out back to /v/.

I get that they were supposed to be fun, but they are really not.

Like, really fucking bad. Dumpire looked more manly than JoJo.</br>  it seems like the season will be halfway over before we introduce all the main characters. We probably won't even get to the big  SUFFERING  chapters.  I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128349097 <br>3DPD shitter please go.<br><br>Also why do you care what MAL and Reddit do?</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit if you want some sort of hugbox.</br>    <br>So now we're pretending that Japanese BD-sales are base upon the posting habits of 4chan /a/?<br><br>Anon, just stop posting please.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, posting that now is a suicide.

Japan hate it and actually occidental boards and forums too. <br><br>Now go and kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>This is my vote for most pretentious review of an anime this season.</br>  <br>Nice blog faggot, now go back to Reddit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128355607 <br>Except that's not me but keep it up mate.</br>   Jitsu wa thread <br> 50 posts discussing the show itself <br> 150 shitposts about stalkerfags/animeonlyfags <br>sasuga /a/</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't seen this pasta before, how new is it?<br><br>Also, saved.</br></br></br>  I really dig the ED singer's voice.  The weirdest thread since the beginning of this season so far  i like the change but Fuka-chan at the end is a bit much.  <br>Jitsu wa watashitachi wa baka da na<br><br>Or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>However, aren't Shoujo's face supposed to appear with Ninjagirl (Durriken)?</br>  <br>No, they appear earlier with Dumon. And it was simply a gag.</br>  Mikan's voice was much better this episode, but I'm not a fan of the mixup    I really can't people that have enjoyed this episode on MAL, Leddit, 4chan. At least, japan and the sales understand me. The episode was shit go fuking read the manga and i hope Manga's sales are great.  <br> I really can't people that have enjoyed this  <br>I really can't stand....</br></br>  <br>References to the Lupin OP never get old.</br>  <br>There was a Lupin reference in the manga as well plus TMS is the one working on Lupin so they had to do it.</br>  <br>I can't even finish the episode. This girl is too much of an annoying bitch. If I wanted hilarious pee pee and poo poo jokes I would be watching Shimoneta.</br>  <br> There was a Lupin reference in the manga as well <br>Oh yeah, now I remember.</br></br>  <br>She is a bitch only during the first chapters though, she became less annoying later</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128355607 <br>Deleting your post doesn't make you any less of a faggot</br>  <br>"Manga voice" is a shitty meme people, or probably one person, has been trying to force all week. I've seen it in these threads, Gakkou Gurashi threads, and Prison School threads. It is 100% intentional.</br>  <br>Mods came. There's a lot of post deleted.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128357292 <br>Oh god I love this thread, the shitpost is fucking real.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128357292 <br>fucking secondaries man</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128357292 <br>A mod came and deleted all your post and you're still going on.

By now it's like the uncle at your family get-together who found out that this one story made everyone laugh, so he starts telling it every year. The first time was funny. The second time was an endearing "oh yeah, I remember that"-moment. The third time onward is dumb.<br><br>And we've long since passed the third time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We /gakkougurashi/ shitposting now?</br>  <br>Memes are literally overused jokes.<br><br>And don't come up with Dawkins' bullshit vague definition.</br></br></br>  I don't really know why I'm watching this past the cute vampire girl.  I know this is supposed to be a parody but I don't remember males in 70s shoujo having eyes this big.  <br>If "manga voice" meme is old, then what about ayylmao, literally, and kek?</br>  <br>So it's like idiots who insist on calling episodes "chapters".</br>  Well, I think its understandable why they are changing the order of events. Giving every girl some spotlight every episode and stablishing the usual status quo faster than the manga.<br>I just hope they don't change things after that moment</br>  <br>Not shit posting, pointing anon to a board that is more suited to his sense of humor</br>  <br>they are, look at "La rose de Versaille"</br>  <br>Cute alien girl.</br>  <br>The chapter 24 was good though with Mikan who began to be cute without glasses and Dumon troll her with her glasses too... but it isn't going to be animated...</br>  Glasses girls are always the fucking worst characters  <br>They can still adapt that chapter, but without the reveal of Fuku-chan.</br>  <br>Those aren't memes either. That's just modern internet slang.<br><br>When's the last time you heard woot, noob, 1337 or le used unironically by people that weren't middle-aged businessmen trying to fit in? Same thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Devil-chan WHEN?</br>   all this anti-childhood friend propaganda <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  Worst childhood friend ever.  This isn't like Jitsu wa watashi wa  <br>They can't, Mikan didn't know about fuku-chan until that chapter.</br>  <br> troll <br> ... <br>go back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that this is a pretty average post for non-/a/ anime boards.</br>  <br>they could still have fuku-chan being taken and alium finding out about her. I expect it to be modified a bit though</br>  <br>The chapter was Mikan searching her glasses. They can do that even if she knows about Fuku-chan. Hell, she searching her talking glasses makes even more sense.</br>  <br>They are still being used, literally every 10 year old uses those, Try playing any "popular" game like LoL, CS:GO or WoW, people unironically communitate with those words there.</br>  <br>I got called a "noob" in World of Warboats today. I couldn't believe it. I thought that word was dead.</br>  <br>Searching for your glasses because they talk makes more sense than searching for them because it was a gift from your crush?<br><br>Not in my chinese cartoons anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw pwned on  /sp/  today, I didn't knew it was still used.</br>  <br>No, searching your glasses that talk and they were a gift for your crush makes more sense that just glassed from your crush.</br>  <br><br>Look there </br></br>  <br>Obviously they'll have to change that, but my point is that that's the only part they have to change.</br>  <br>As we saw in today's episode, the animators really hate Orange, so they probably won't bother adapting the whole story about her searching for glasses.</br>   inb4 they turn Dumpire ito a slut in the anime. <br><br>  By having her suck Asahi's blood in the last episode. </br></br>  <br>it won't have feel. <br><br><br>She became relevant with the box girl</br></br></br></br>  <br> it won't have feel.  <br><br>it won't have the same feel but it will probably look okay.</br></br></br>  <br>You sick bastard.</br>  <br>I bet they merge the Amusement Park trips so we get a kiss in the last episode</br>  <br>which manga?</br>  <br>Redline</br>  <br> That also happens in the manga the same week. <br><br>It will happen, she wants the B badly.</br></br></br>  <br>seriously.</br>  <br>Are they pronouncing her nickname as "GhettoQueen"?</br>  Why dumon get a nosebleed during the last released chapter?  <br>I'll admit I chuckled.</br>  <br>This is garbage</br>  <br>Because she's a cool beauty. <br><br> and a slut <br><br> flap flap </br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone got LoTR reference?  <br>They both did because they both fell on their fucking faces</br>  <br>KEK</br>  <br>10/2=7 nois math m8<br> &gt;&gt;/MAL/ </br></br>  Manga &gt; Anime sofar  This episode was really bad  <br>Does anybody else want to see a horror manga by the same author?</br>  <br>Anime &gt; manga sofar</br>    <br>What was there?</br>   Orange voice <br>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK<br>All those "manga voices" memes aside, it doesn't suit her at all.</br></br>  <br><br>Here from the same author: <br><br>Chapter 01 RAW : http://arc.akitashoten.co.jp/comics<wbr>/toumei/1<br><br>related pic</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the part where she turns from worst girl to being one of the best.</br>  <br>Mikan is mandarin. Orange is Tachibana.</br>  <br>There is a part like that? I must have missed it</br>  <br>uwow uwow</br>  <br> Can't wait for the part where she turns from worst girl to being one of the best <br> "Right guys?" <br><br><br> "Right...?" <br><br>It doesn't exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Owww the edge. Still thank you nice anon I love your cock</br>  Anyone also bothered Crunchy's use of the word "heathen" for Mikan? I thought "Evil" worked a lot better  <br>dunno, but since the anime is shit, no one care. Go read the manga.</br>  <br>They're are saying "heathen queen" in engrish, so it's the correct translation, but yes, I also prefer "evil queen"</br>  <br>I think 外道 is best translated as "scumbag," but evil works fine too.<br><br>"Heathen" is a really weird way to translate it, and it really doesn't make sense in context.</br></br></br>  Looks like I'll finally have to learn moon. <br><br>Since we're like 8 months behind the elevens with translations, even if Pretty Anon team would work their asses off, we won't catch up for another year or so, and that's assuming they won't drop it. Time to bookmard DJT, I guess.</br></br>  <br>The scanlators have already said that they have no intention of catching up with the manga because they prefer to work with the tankobons. With that said, something like JitsuWata should be fairly easy for a beginner to read.</br>  <br>It's a weekly manga and we're getting translations once a week, so we'll never really catch up</br>  <br> DJT <br>what is that?</br></br>  <br>http://jisho.org/search/%E5%A4%96%E<wbr>9%81%93<br><br>Seems like a fine translation.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Daily Japanese Thread</br>  <br><br>Well, if that's not a reason to learn moon, then I don't know what is.</br></br>  <br><br>We might catch up after it's completed. Which means another 3+ years, and that's assuming translators won't drop it in the meantime. <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this meme</br>   fuku-chan's VA is female <br>I always imagined fuku to be male, am I the only one?</br>  <br> fuku-chan </br>  <br>you're not...</br>  <br>No, you're not. Now I find this moment even more funny</br>  <br>I still think he's male. But that VA is new, right? She sounded like Hirano Aya, particularly her role as PaiPai in Gatchaman.</br>  <br>They still call him "god" so he's male, but with a feminine voice.</br>  <br>I always thought that fuku was male, but his voice changed based on who was holding him. (Which sort of explains Alium).</br>  <br>I forgot how unlikeable she was in the beginning. <br><br>It's weird how cool she is now</br></br></br>  <br>Orange a cute</br>  <br>Well, it explains why Fuku is so dumb.</br>  What is it with anime and their school papers being awful Murdoch-tier tabloid trash?  <br>No one would read the school paper if it wasn't. Why would anyone bother with the school paper in the first place</br>  FUCK ORANGE<br>FUCK GREEN<br>FUCK YELLOW<br><br>BLUE FOR LYFE</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I did school paper, it was mostly an excuse to laze around and write stupid shit and load it up with in-jokes and secret messages.</br>  <br>BLUE FOR LIFE<br>L<br>U<br>E<br><br>F<br>O<br>R<br><br>L<br>I<br>F<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's useful for those who write it to get practice but no one bothers to read it</br>  Holy shit this is the first time I hate a childhood friend from the moment she's introduced, even Minami was okay for me at first because her design hit all of my weaknesses and she wasn't all that bad until she went full moralfag.<br>And don't worry mangafags, I promise I'll pick the manga up once I stop being so lazy.</br>  <br>Then you're ahead of the game, everyone but orangefags recognize her as worst girl.</br>  <br>Secondaries really are cancerous.</br>  <br>She turned from worst girl into still worst girl, but much much better.<br><br>The competition she has to deal with though ensures she is still worst.</br></br></br>  *flapflapflap*  <br>The episodes felt really bad though. It was mostly<br> Orange Classroom - the anime </br></br>  <br>They wanted to get the girl that is most popular, and probably best, in the picture as soon as possible.<br><br>A bit cynical, but understandable. It's like what they do with Meat in Haganai anime.</br></br></br>   Sakurada blushing   <br>His opinion on Orange mirrors the primaries though since she is really awful.</br>  <br>They also took out Oka being on the roof with Asahi</br>  <br><br> People liking Alium </br></br>  <br>And just think, the anime won't get far enough for her to stop being horrible.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if they speed up her development somehow to get her out of her awful phase since this is never getting a second season.<br>They can only do so much without Granddumber though, since Orange really depends on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I figured Fuku-chan was a male but hoped he would be a female since it wasn't really clear early on.<br>Then the chapter came with the Love Hotel and I figured that confirmed Fuku-chan to be male.</br></br>  <br>All characters got a lot better once their personalities got established past a simple gimmick.</br>  <br>the nigger-spam in the captcha gets me every time</br>  <br>I need to impregnate her external unit.</br>  <br>Just finished the episode. Holy shit that cunt is insufferable.</br>  <br> chicken nipple <br> tuesday banana <br> rama ding dong <br><br>wat. Am I missing something?</br></br></br></br></br>  THE SEASON OF MEGA MILK SMUG FACES  man they really fucked up this adaption didn't they  <br>Dumon will make or break this series. It only got really good after she was introduced</br>  JUST  <br>She still is the worst anon.<br><br>Alium is the best, no wonder she's number 1 on the character popularity poll.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br> Thinking Alium is best </br>  <br> those monkey ears <br>JUST</br></br>  <br>Granddumber has the same ones.</br>  <br> Alium is the best, no wonder she's number 1 on the character popularity poll. <br><br>Please don't bully her</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even watch this show but this girl looks very cute. Does she have a deep voice?</br>  <br>It can get deep. It was better in this episode than the first</br>  <br>Mikan makes the best faces.</br>  I dropped the manga because the anime art is really good.<br><br>Thank God.</br></br>  <br>holy shit whats her problem? nearly dropped this show because her. worst girl so far</br>  Mikan was as hate-able as I can remember. So far so good.  <br><br>When you're that transparent, it takes all the fun out of it.</br></br>  holy shit. What a bitch.  <br>she's just pretending</br>  <br><br>How the fuck can shiragami have such a cute voice?</br></br>  <br>Because Shiragami herself a cute.<br> CUTE! </br></br>  <br>Don't underestimate the power of an accent.</br>  <br>because kuul byutea</br>  Dropped this shit. The characters are so bland and it's got the art style of a bad h-anime without the fucking  <br>fuck you</br>  That voice and smile made me check the manga. It's super adorable.  I'm really liking the girls so far. Even knowing that green will win, I don't really mind.  <br>Why is she so bae?</br>  <br>The fuck is this? I can't read it.</br>   Glasses <br> This early <br> Female voice <br><br>EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IS A LIE<br>I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS PLANET</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>same<br><br>mikan a shit<br><br>mikan A WORST GIRL OF THE SEASON material</br></br></br></br></br>  Dumon fucking when?  DROPED  <br>Same here</br>  <br>an another from the same Mangaka (Masuda Eiji), it isn't translated in english but there is a French version of it if you're a frenchfag<br> if you're not <br>Learn Moon.<br><br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/toume<wbr>i-ningen-no-tsukurikata-r14417</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> an another from the same  <br>Another manga from the same...</br></br>  is it done by the same studio of Rosario x Vampire?<br> This show was awful for the same reason (Artstyle and change)</br>  Lewd Orange pretending to be evil is more entertaining than her being a sore loser though.  <br>Kill la kill X jItsuwa Crossover?</br>  <br>What's the point of this character?<br>She's a retard that could have won the bowl if she wanted to because MC would have had fallen for her like the faggot he is.<br><br>actually what's the point of this series at all. Greenshit won already</br></br></br></br>  Please someone tell me i'm not the only one that thinks this is the worst girl in the manga.<br>I know she's main girl and all but jesus she's boring as fuck. Please someone tell me i'm not alone</br>  <br> what's the point of this series at all <br><br>Either Cute Girls doing Dumb Things, or Dumb Girls doing Cute Things.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you are coming from but I strongly disagree, Orange is clearly worst girl.<br><br>You are not too far off about the boring thing. Her biggest traits are that she is cute and dumb, which most of the girls are. I think the bigger issue is that she is almost always seen from the perspective of someone else rather than her own, so she gets less development that way. She's also Main Girl so hard that it hampers her own development, in the same way Haruna of TLR is.<br><br>All that said, she's still second best girl in my opinion, but probably not the second best character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange is clearly worst girl. <br><br>She isn't, all girl are good and best girl </br></br></br>  <br>All girls eventually become good, yes, but even when they are all best, some are more best than others.</br>  <br>I loved Mikan in the manga but I hate her in the anime. Anyone else feel the same?<br><br>class rep is still the best in both anime and manga formats.</br></br></br>  <br>Orange started really, really bad in the manga too. Did you just forget how awful she was in the beginning chapters?</br>  <br>She had better voice in the manga tho</br>  All those shit eating grins. I want to protect them.  <br>I remember, but I feel like her slightly different design and her VA choice make her just terrible.</br>  <br><br>She gave Shitma what he deserved.</br></br>  <br>I got really tired of class rep in the manga. 2much screentime</br>  DEAD as fuck this thread<br>The anime is really shit then?</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>TMS.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>Would you rather it turn into a shitty constant general? It is better this way.</br>  This bitch almost became worst girl of the season until the last scene saved her.  <br>these are the same shitbags that adapted yamada; of course they're going to shit everything up</br>  <br>No they're not faggot.</br>  <br>bullshit, everything about it smells of the same stink. it's like you actually believe just because jc staff name is attached it was done entirely in-house, by them.</br>  <br>4u</br>  <br>still worst girl in this show though</br>  uwow    <br>I hope you are not streaming anon as that cap looks blurry and jagged as shit.</br>  so, Is demon gonna save the animu?  <br>Too big for ants, I fixed it for you.</br>  <br>Did someone say too big?</br>  <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br>Jitsu wa watashi wa what?</br></br>  <br>I'm trying, god knows I am. I just hope Dumon is close to the manga.</br>  <br>Vampire/demon/alien etc.</br>  <br>not a cool beauty</br>  <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa Anonymous, can't you read?</br>  <br>Still  gl ad</br>  Wait did we find out about her magic glasses this early in the manga?  <br>No they come into play much later but this series is only 12 episodes so they gotta give Mikan her gimmick outside of her awful introduction</br>  <br>Depends on the performance of the VA, she'll have to do the switching between the playful sweets loving Dumon and the batshit crazy version.</br>  <br>If she can't, no one can.</br>  <br><br><br>watch her just not show up</br></br></br>  <br>She's in the OP.</br>  <br>I'm just saying, if it keeps up the trend of shit, she'll show up right towards the end as one of those "see you in the next season!" characters.<br>And we all know this isn't getting a second season</br></br>  Isn't Shiragami's secret actually safe, given the fact she's technically a dhampir?  <br>I can actually see that happening. And then the last episode's end card would be her with the caption: "Send me sweets for the second season featuring me!"</br>  <br><br>She showed up on several of the promotional artworks.<br>She debuted in the manga before Fuku-chan.<br>There aren't enough chapters to go a full cour without featuring her.<br>As bad as it's been, somehow omitting Dumon is a level of shit that's infinitely beyond anything we've seen so far in this or any adaptation. It redefines badness in a way that defies all reason. It's a degree of terrible that probably isn't even physically possible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the staff will apologize for fucking it up!</br>  <br> It's a degree of terrible that probably isn't even physically possible. <br>Prepare your anus then, cause I'm calling this shit.</br></br>    This anime is doomed, they look all awful  <br><br>I keep trying to picture a Dumon-less JwWw anime and it just doesn't make sense. It boggles the mind. The only way it works out is  if Dumon herself was in charge the whole time. </br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, she lacks her mischievous grin.</br></br>  <br>I would be fine with this, I just can't get demon horns to turn me on, the other girls are fine.</br>  <br> In between shot <br> Looks awful <br><br>I wonder why.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not posting the Dumon stampede </br>  <br>I-It's my first time. Be g-gentle</br>  <br>Man, Dumon's VA has to handle two unhinged characters this season.</br>  Why do they allow her to get away with what she does? Literally all they need to do is tell somebody that she is bullying multiple students and breaking into peoples' homes and she will be instantly suspended or expelled.  <br> Literally all they need to do is tell somebody that she is bullying multiple students and breaking into peoples' homes and she will be instantly suspended or expelled. <br><br>To who, Dumon? Like she'd do anything.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a comedy.</br>  <br><br>Even the police would work. She has multiple pictures on her camera proving that she is bullying them and even if the police can't take action based on only words she has probably posted pictures of the act in a few places. It wouldn't be hard to get evidence to make the police move since bullying now is apparently one of the worst crimes anyone can commit.</br></br>  <br>I think he means Mikan, who probably has dirt on anyone who could actually dish out that punishment  except the principal, who as we all know doesn't give a shit. </br>  <br><br>Oh yeah I forgot since this episode wasn't funny.</br></br>  <br>The police are too busy combatting the school's rape epidemic.</br>  <br>Look <br><br>this faggot there  is not me.</br></br></br>  <br>    the principal, who as we all know doesn't give a shit. <br>exactly, complain to who, dumon?<br><br>see  see </br></br></br></br>  <br> dat sakuga <br>with a proper studio this could have been such a great series.</br></br>   open any jitsu wa watashi wa thread <br> "they changed it too much from the manga" <br> "the manga looked better, this is shit" <br><br> open any gate thread <br> "they changed it too much from the manga" <br> "the manga looked better, this is shit" <br><br>Wouldn't it be great if these people just didn't watch what they considered to be such an inferior adaptation? These threads would be 100% more bearable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People new to adaptations + summer.</br>  <br>Because she's female.</br>  <br>Dumon finds her antics entertaining</br>  <br>Reminder that Jojofags and Fatefags are the reason for all this source material elitism and are the cancer killing /a/</br>  <br>I feel like Mikan's personality and gimmick was the most different from when she was introduced. <br>At first she was the annoying girl who was trying to find secrets but once she got her fortune god she became part of the silliness.

I'm curious as to why Rakshas wants to kill him but since he's full Yandere for Griffith, that's just his weird logic in effect. Silat, on the other hand, probably took an interest cause Rickert is the only motherfucker in Falconia who doesn't worship Griffith.<br><br>Dis gun be gud. It's a fight I've been looking forward to for literal years.<br><br>I'm also interested about Lucas' reaction. Since he's not watching Rickert leave but Griffith himself, I'm thinking that he might not be so much as pissed at Rickert but at Griffith himself for allowing such a commoner slap his shit and tarnish the idea that he's an untouchable being. Fucking fire breathing, hell spawning Godzilla monster couldn't touch a single strand of hair but this kid out of nowhere just pimps the fuck out of that scene.<br><br>Maybe I'm overthinking it but it's cool food for thought.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> moeshit poster <br>Nigger I like myself some moe sometimes but to shitpost twice with worst girls from their respective series must take some dedication.

It's more entertaining than Miura's shit manga anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>It shows that Griffith is a just ruler and doesn't control the emotions of his soldiers.</br>  Why, Miura?  <br>Don't see a problem.

Everything but Guts' jaw are getting more and more moe. Seems like there's less detail too, but that might just be the scans.  What's the story between Void and the Spooky one  Griffith just wants to rid the world of the Godhand and Guts will ruin everything.  <br>If you guys haven't noticed yet.it's not just style that has changed, it's also the quality.<br>It could just be the quality of the scans or the difference in panel size but, notice that the new hair has much less detail.</br></br>  <br> believing a random bullshitter on /a/ </br>  <br>Why would he do that?</br>  <br> this high level autism got this mad and embarrassed himself like this  <br> <br><br> believing /a/ at all </br></br></br></br>      will miura ever finish this shit  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  <br>and i will report you until you are banned</br>  <br>sup hawk</br>  <br>No. Next question</br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  <br> Getting triggered this easily. <br>I'm deeply sorry you can't block my blog, landwhale.<br><br><br>Have this</br></br></br></br></br>  Silat and Daiba joining the DnD party soon <br><br>Time for some eastern magic</br></br>  <br> Jerome turned out to have a wife so now Luca's available <br><br>who will win the Lucabowl, /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>They will and it will destroy the humanity guts has left.</br>  <br>i like it</br>  <br>I'd  respect  her  profession .<br> Just kidding I'd hold her hand .</br></br>  <br>Please don't make me destroy you.</br>   they don't get off the boat   <br> http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives<wbr>/472642</wbr> <br>Bakiraka up in his bitch</br></br>  <br>she is so hot, I wanna fuck her in the ass</br>  <br> Wanted a kingdom of his own. <br><br> Got his kingdom. <br><br> Wait a second, this is fucking boring when I don't have anything to pursue, I'll make everything my kingdom. <br><br> Kills the other Godhands because fuck them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>do you really wanna talk about destruction anon</br></br>  <br><br>GRIFFITH!!!!</br></br>  <br> Just kidding I'd hold her hand </br>  <br> Casca actually kisses him back <br>Kek sure.

Heck, some might have even made arrangements with whatever nightmarish D&amp;D monster appeared to spare their lives. <br>Some dragon installs itself as the new king over a city-state, granting them its protection in return for some yummy virgins once a month, which is still better than getting raped to death by trolls and ogres, and it sucks having to travel to Falconia which is on the other side of the world. And the only way to then get more virgins is to raid other city-states controlled by independent fantasy monsters and wizards who don't have to hide their power levels anymore because now everything is D&amp;D.</br></br>   autists <br> muslims <br> griffith defense force <br><br>I just want the manga to end.

Read the manga, people.</br></br>  <br>  implying i didn't read the manga even before the anime was announced <br>I said it because i know its gonna happen, Kurumi has no salvation</br></br>  <br><br> Not the edit </br></br>  How would /a/ survive a zombie apocalypse?  <br>Our backlogs can last for years</br>  <br> shovel <br> perfect </br></br>  <br>Betray people for their supplies.</br>  <br>I would  drink tequila and dance the cha-cha-cha with them  so hard.</br>  So right now after watching the first 2 episodes I'm reading the manga scans. Is it wrong of me to think that the Anime is doing a better job of contrasting the Zombie Apocalypse with Takeya's imagination as well as pacing the story (so far)? Especially since it's taking creative liberties from the source material  <br> Just like most words in mysterious chilean, it has multiple meanings for us. What do argentinians use it for? </br>  <br> to call people, referring to people and in very few occasions as an insult </br>  <br>Yes you are, though i like that the anime isn't the same as the manga so nobody nows what is gonna happen, but so far i see its like S2 of Tokyo Ghoul, is not the same story like the manga but its kinda similar too</br>  <br> also to call people. Old people used to use it for bastards or kids without parents </br>  <br><br><br>Guys, please stop using spoilers for that<br>Or discussing that shit here</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Same meanings as us then.<br><br><br>Thread is quite dead, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Imagine she'd opened that door and found the remains of her parents on the bed, there's no farewell letter as they lost all hope. Kurumi continues to enter her room. She reads the dusty letter, written for Senpai about their better future. A single framed picture is crooked, from her little sister who slumbers now between the parents. Before she drops on her own bed Kurumi grabs the choker, a birthday gift and last memento she got from them. <br><br>Also, I'm curious about the other gurashis. Were they friends before the pandemic? What happened to their families? How about their hobbies or plans for the future? So far, we only know a few things about shovel.</br></br>  <br> dead <br>I see what you did there.</br></br>    <br>I really thought there was gonna be a surprise inside the house, but you know being completely empty felt right for the scene.</br>  <br><br>I think they knew each other before the outbreak, not sure<br>Aside from Shovel, we know that Rii has a sister  (and even that is just a guess, maybe she just made up a story about her having a sister) </br></br></br>  RADIO CHAN IS ALIVE AND WELL  <br><br>Sure</br></br>  The irony is rich.  <br>you have a choice, and in all due respect, this is the right one. Otherwise.... well pic related</br>  <br>Nigga, I haven't been to /b/ in years.</br>  <br>watch anime read manga play games. Sit inside all day. Nothing changes except the quality of food is a little worse and the boards are a little slow.</br>  <br>I don't think that's a bad /b/ screenshot, there's a lot more worse stuff that could appear</br>  Alright, went ahead and updated this with a bit more information and a few corrections. Hope at least someone likes it. Not too sure about the white bubbles for the text, I was trying to make it more readable without being too distracting.<br><br>Still trying to figure out if there's a better candidate for the shopping center and if that oddly shaped building outside of Miki's room at the shopping center is a real building or not; it's been shown several times and is labeled 'Aloster Medical,' so I'm betting it'll make an appearance again later.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, theres a reason for that<br><br>I tried to get one that wouldn't get my post deleted and i figured this one fit the bill</br></br></br>  <br>I think I know what you mean.</br>  <br>Thanks for doing this, but I would think that the mall they found Mii in would be closer to their start point than the universities, otherwise there might have been other interactions before. There could be smaller shopping malls that were just made to be larger in the story that are hard to find on Google maps.</br>  <br>Underrated edit, would make for some sick horror movie trailer</br>  <br>Exactly my thought, that's why I put the note. But I can't find anything anywhere for it. Even Motomachi is a fair bit smaller than the one in the manga, doesn't seem like there's anything closer that's larger than a convenience store. Least that I can find.</br>  <br>Or to compensate for all the "we need to chase Taroumaru the whole episode and then drop the bomb!" thing</br>  <br>I love you.</br>  <br>Look at this guy taking all the credit!<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-07-20/fans-discover-real<wbr>-location-of-school-live-campus/.90<wbr>673</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I did say when I first made it the general location/map comparison came from 2ch. I looked up all the other stuff myself though. Didn't realize they'd gone that far though, guess I should go compare notes. Thanks for pointing it out.</br>  <br>Another flaw in your map, it's about two kilometers between the university and their school. Even with a stopover at the elementary school you could walk that in less than 2-3 hours. How they heck did they needed several days for the way?</br>  <br>Keep in mind roads in Japan are super narrow compared to the west (at least the USA), and they're covered in dead ends thanks to wreckage blocking everything. Constantly having to backtrack and weave your way through a labyrinth, combined with the need to be super cautious, I could easily see it taking quite a while to travel that distance.<br>But yeah, I'm not sold on that being the university, if there's a better spot I'll gladly change it.</br></br>  <br>Rii-san is so attractive.

Rejoice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bet she's wild in bed</br>  <br>Oh and here are the approximate sales numbers for the 6/7 - 12/7 week:<br> Manga sales list for the previous week is up. <br> All the data I'm using is from the http://shosekiranking.blog.fc2.com/<wbr> so it's up to you to believe me or not.</wbr> <br><br> As I've said before, none of the Gakkou Gurashi! ranked on this site aside from the 5th volume which barely managed to sell 2,500-3,000 copies in one week. This time though in just 3 days all the volumes managed to get as much as this: <br><br> Vol.1 - ~11,500 <br> Vol.2 - ~9,700 <br> Vol.3 - ~8,100 <br> Vol.4 - ~7,000 <br> Vol.5 - ~6,800 <br><br> Still not so much, but if this week's episode will be alright for the people who are buying the manga we may finally see some of them on Oricon with an actual official sales number. So all that's left is to hope. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So overall it's in the "okay" tier?</br>  <br>We'll know for sure tomorrow.<br>I'm not expecting it to get 100,000 right away though.</br></br>  i want to meet shovel ayaya and make her dream of becoming a bride come true  <br>I just want it to sell well so we'll get a 2nd season.

If human zombies move at such a slow pace, why would zombie dogs be any faster? Shouldn't they be just as slow as the humans are? Humans at peak condition are pretty fast, just like dogs at peak condition are.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there was a zoo nearby and it infected all the really big mammals there.<br>Along with the cats and dogs everyone would have, I can imagine it wiping out at least a city pretty fast.</br></br>    <br>The shows hasn't been the same as the manga so we can't be certain<br><br> megu-nees probably dead, toroumaru seems to be alive though because the other girls will interact with it, not just yuki </br></br></br>  <br>They only move fast when there's something to attack.

I meant it's pretty obvious she's a delusion in the anime.</br>  <br>I wonder what her hair smells like.</br>  <br>There is a tutorial on /r/anime.</br>  <br>What does dead hair smell like?</br>  <br>All hair is dead.</br>    <br>You're dead.</br>  <br>Optimism and genki.<br><br> I'll flip my shit if her body starts slowly decaying by discovering she is losing hair in patches and discolored marks start appearing on her skin </br></br></br>  <br> reddit </br>  <br>Rape the maids.</br>  <br>Don't worry, radio-chan had a healthy full head of hair.</br>  <br>But Radio-chan isn't dead.</br>  <br>please no<br><br>at least let her die while she's still cute</br></br></br>  <br>A script I wrote.</br>  <br>That is the closest anyone has come to making me want to stop.<br><br>Wasn't enough, though.

I tried doing a vocab exercise on memrise but it primarily used romaji so I couldn't get into it.  <br> Put your hands to a place where your hands can be seen <br><br>Doesn't sound odd in Japanese</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you have to know then is it really the most important thing ever?</br>  <br>Japs like to repeat themselves</br>  <br>を見える doesn't sound odd?</br>  <br>RTK everyone look at it and laugh</br>  <br>Oh right, so the first 手 is part of a clause for 場所. disregard the question then, i'm not japanese yet.</br>  <br>You will never be Japanese.</br>  <br> Hands where they can be seen <br>Not really</br></br>  <br>I actually didn't do RTK, I just use the wanikani deck. It only took a couple weeks to get to over 500 kanji so it's not a big deal, but I haven't been splitting things up by all three decks (kanji, vocabulary, radicals) included. It's my own fault.</br>  <br>Hmm... well shit, if only there was some kind of way to see a video with audio that explained the concept.</br>  <br> を見える <br>Yeah that sounds odd because that's not how it works. The particle attaches to the object, not the verb.</br></br>  What's your 2015 AOTY so far?  All of those are wrong.  <br>Keep the shitposting in one thread </br>  <br>Lightning bolt- fantasy empire</br>  I can only see 3 possibilities for 2015.<br>Death Parade, Crowds Insight or Subete ga F ni Naru.</br>  <br> Death Parade <br> Crowds <br><br>Get better taste.</br></br></br></br>  Does Shirobako count as 2014 or 2015?  <br>I bet it's better than yours.<br>What's your AOTY?</br></br>  <br>Literally shitposting</br>      <br>The show that killed noitaminA harder than Guilty crown and BRS combined?<br>Yeah, that is some stellar shit taste.</br></br>  <br>This is a fucking good list but<br> GitS over Haibane Renmei  <br> Planetes over Texhnolyze  <br>You did good however.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the best show that's been on noitaminA in the last few years. If you want to talk about killing noitaminA, you should talk about that homo detective show on right now.</br></br>  <br> generic harem <br> best anything </br></br>  <br> generic <br><br>Perfection isn't generic.</br></br></br>  <br>Please, "shitty rom com harem LN adaptations" (not just Saekano, all of them) and "best" can never belong in the same sentence.<br><br>I do agree that Game of Laplace is of little interest outside of trap fetishism.</br></br></br>  <br> those trips for the anon who said the objective truth <br>So god does exist.</br></br>  <br>Probably Kekkai or Death Parade. This has been a rather lackluster year with a lot of underwhelming sequels and not enough good originals. Shirobako was 2014 so I don't count that.</br>  <br> thinking harem can't be AOTS <br>Your containment thread is over here</br></br>  Why no one is talking about Jitsu wa watashi wa? I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost. It’s even better because even mangaonlyfag can enjoy this because everything is changed in a good way and they make it new.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come because In the end,</br>  <br>The only harem that was ever AOTS was Bakemonogatari.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Hare+Guu <br> good </br></br>  <br> not posting the official, objective version <br> instead posting the pretentious version </br></br>  <br>evidence of /a/'s shit taste at the time</br>  <br> Bakemonogatari <br> AOTY </br></br>  <br> thinking well written shows that took actual talent to make being AOTY is pretentious  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> check chart <br> are there any Yuasa anime <br> yes <br>It's pretentious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>where? reddit?</br>  <br> talks about pretentiousness <br> posts a chart that has Paranoia Agent on it </br></br>  It'll probably be One Punch Man but seeing as how that hasn't yet aired I will withhold my opinion.  <br> Kekkai <br>Will it be actually finished before 2015 is over?</br></br>  <br> well written shows that took actual talent <br> Madoka <br> Hyouka <br> Shirobako <br><br>Those shows fit the bill perfectly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best AOTY list I ever saw on /a/</br>  <br>I'll defend Ping Pong as AOTY 2014<br><br>or die trying</br></br></br>  <br>How is Yuasa pretentious?

The point of all Yuasa anime is to explore basic but fundamental themes of life in very creative and wacky ways using very realistic characters.</br>  <br> GitS over Haibane Renmei <br>GitS was better</br></br>  <br> thinking the visuals of a primarily visual medium aren't of extremely high importance <br>If I want top-tier writing and storytelling I'll read a book.</br></br>  <br>On that I agree.</br>  <br><br> defending this </br></br>  <br> Good anime in 2014 : <br> Mushishi <br> Ping Pong <br> Barakamon <br> Shirobako <br>10/10 taste there, can't agree completely on the 2015 choices but I do like YKA and OreMono.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The writing was at least 5,793 times less cliched, that's for sure. Ping Pong is a walking sportsshonen/battleshonen cliche.</br>  Hibike.  <br>Art &gt; Animation &gt; Characters &gt; Plot<br><br>All are important, but anime is first and foremost a visual medium.

In fact I'd say it has the most realistic art style of any anime in the past 2 years. You don't see anime like Ping Pong everyday. If you had any sense you would know it was a creative choice to keep Ping Pong's art style like that to make the characters look real and believable but add a sense of artistry to it.</br></br></br>  <br> Art &gt; Animation &gt; Characters &gt; Plot <br>So I guess you liked Shitgatsu too?</br></br>  <br> runner up 2015 <br> hibike </br></br>  <br> Ping Pong has top tier art direction <br>I could draw better by sticking a pen up my ass and writing with my ass.</br></br>  <br>Winter and Summer been shit, still have hope for Fall, but so far the only posible candidates are Etotama or Kekkai Sensen.</br>  <br>You should put more effort in your shitpost.</br>  <br>I disagree. An anime with superb art and animation will still be shit if the characters and plot are badly written, whereas a well-written anime with good characters can captivate me enough to overlook subpar art/animation.</br>  Am I the only one who feels like the general quality of AOTY contenders have dropped since 2010 or 2011?  <br><br>It's true. Hibike is super boring, it's like Glasslip but with an extra layer of polish.</br></br>  <br> . Ping Pong is a walking sportsshonen/battleshonen cliche. <br><br>Nope, it's the most accurate depiction of sports competition with respect to the game and more importantly its players and the struggles they go through as athletes, friends, rivals, and humans. I'd say it's the best sports anime since Slam Dunk. Inoue is the Yuasa of manga.</br></br></br>  <br> quality <br>Feels more like quantity. There's less and less anime that I would consider even good.</br></br>  Nice, another shitpost thread.  <br>Care to give an example? I'm interested in what you consider subpar art vs good art.</br>  <br> idiots who don't realize Ping Pong's art style was done on purpose </br>  <br>If the characters are shit no amount of good animation will save it from being shit<br>See SAO</br></br>  <br>I will agree with this, but only due to the fact that this year has been pretty shit overall and there hasn't been anything I liked more. In a better year it wouldn't even be a contender.</br>  <br> using an image where the calque does not even fit the teamplate <br>Nobody can take you seriously.</br></br>  <br><br>SAO didn't even have good animation.</br></br>  <br>SAO doesn't have good animation, much less good art direction.</br>  <br> it's the most accurate depiction of sports competition with respect to the game and more importantly its players and the struggles they go through as athletes, friends, rivals, and humans. <br>This.<br><br> When I was getting into CARD GAMEZ competitively, the show helped me put into perspective a lot of things. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibike is like Glasslip <br>You're not even trying</br></br>  If sequels don't count then  Koufuku Graffiti .  <br><br>Hibike wasn't even AOTS. <br><br> Kiniro Mosaic <br> Punch Line <br> Yamada <br><br>Even Yahari was better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quality has gone down and quantity has gone up. This is the biggest problem with the industry and at the rate it's going Anime will collapse sooner than later. We need to stop all the pandering, cheap shilling of industry names, and reduce all the adaptations especially the fucking LN ones since LNs are just a horrible medium meant to target a particular audience and make a quick buck. We need to have more original anime.</br>  <br>I haven't seen it, but it doesn't look particularly interesting to me.</br>   2014 had Ping Pong, Barakamon and Shirobako <br> 2015 has fucking nothing <br>Why is this year so bad?</br></br>  <br><br>If KyoAni did Glasslip you guys would be all over it saying it's the best anime ever.</br></br>  <br> anime is dying <br><br>I love this meme.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime will collapse sooner than later <br>Good. From the ashes will rise a new anime industry to get their shit together.<br><br>Or Japan sinks.<br><br>One of those.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Binan Koukou anyone  <br> super boring <br><br>This means precisely nothing</br></br></br>  Someone tried to tell me Gate was the must watch anime of the season.<br><br>This either means he's full of shit or this season is just that bad.</br></br>  <br>It's true though. Financially it's fine for the time being, but you can't argue that the quality is going down. Anime is less of an art form nowadays and more of a poorly adapted commercial meant to promote something else which is used to make money which leads to more merchandise and creates a franchise. Anime is dying in a figurative sense and somewhere down the line, maybe 15-20 years from now the pandering might not work anymore and people will stop buying late night anime. Who knows?</br>  YOU LIE IN APRIL is AOTY  <br>The industry is just preparing their big guns for 2016, right?</br>  <br><br>Literally nothing wrong with Gate.</br></br>  <br> Actually responding to an obvious bait. <br>How long have you been here? One month?</br></br>  <br>Wait for Lupin.</br>  <br>Where the fuck did you read that recommendation, imgur?</br>  <br>This season is one of the worst seasons in some long time.</br>  <br> nowadays and more of a poorly adapted commercial meant to promote something else which is used to make money which leads to more merchandise and creates a franchise <br><br>Anime has always been like that you big dummy.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty disappointing season. Sure there's a lot of watchable shows, but I don't think a single show will be remembered in the long run or be a potential AOTY.</br>  <br>Paranoia agent is good.</br>  <br> Charlotte </br>  What species is this?

Graphics is pronounced with a hard G. Why would the abbreviation switch to a J sound? The creator is clearly an idiot. Maybe an idiot savant, but still an idiot.</br></br>  <br>Me on the right</br>  Like many other living creatures, domestic hamsters in Japan underwent serious mutations following the second Fukushima disaster, affecting genes responsible for their metabolism. This eventually caused the animal's phenotype to change significantly.<br><br>A mutant hamster of this type, known as a "Flesh" among otaku, is one of the clearest examples of Japan's perversion of nature. The hamsters have developed a protective layer of scales and bones, their regeneration potential grew significantly and their nervous system became more complex. A side benefit of this mutation are their enlarged eyes, which can see in a greater spectrum of light and has olfactory receptors within (in layman's terms, the flesh can smell with its eyes).</br></br>  <br>ASAP is pronounced "ay-sap" even though as is pronounced "æs"<br>That's not really an argument. The letter g can represent both sounds, and the creator of the word defined which of the two sounds is to be used. Sounds pretty cut and dry to me. You don't just go pronouncing "giant" as "guy-ant" because you fucking feel like it, do you?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128376813 <br>and he loves his imouto</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128376436 <br>Good vid.</br>  <br><br>Don't feed the shill.

Go on twitch and make money that way. I'm sure there are some gay sugar daddies that will give you money if you talk dirty to them.</br>  <br><br>Not a bad argument, but no matter what the creator intended, most people have been pronouncing it with a hard "G" sound since forever. Language is determined by usage over time, not by the person who invented the thing the word is describing. <br><br>Anyway if both are deemed acceptable by the OED, then both are acceptable. That really is fairly cut and dried.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128378499 <br><br>Shilling your youtube channel on /a/ is against the rules, not to mention obnoxious.

Is it cute? </br>  <br> still not fat <br>Ebina is fat as fuck.</br></br>  <br>It's alright at best, the endless circlejerking is making it look a lot more popular than it really is.<br><br>Just watch it and decide for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>More like the endless shitposting.</br>  <br>Party Hard edit when?</br>  <br>A flashy "AUTISM" caption would fit that gif very well.</br>  It's an onahole that has achieved sentience.  <br><br><br>If anything verytime I start getting pissed off at this anime I think "at least it's not Oreimo" and calm down.</br></br></br>  <br>it's not an incest manga</br>  <br>Gay.</br>  <br>Yet</br>  If you took the same exact show but had umaru as a boy /a/ would never even mention this generic show  <br>yes, and?</br>  <br>You could say that about any anime show faggot</br>  <br>That's why no one talked about Free</br>  <br>So you'll admit that this show has no merit past the moeblob?</br>  <br>I know, right?<br>I call it giff. Like gift.</br></br>  Ebina is clearly best character  <br>Why do you think only lolbr and leddit talked about free like it was the greatest anime of the decade?</br>  <br> watching Imouto crap <br>for what purpose.</br></br>  <br><br>Umaru never treated her brother like he killed and ate the family dog.<br>Umaru was never outright hateful and hostile towards her beloved oniichan.<br>Granted Kirino eventually warmed up to her brother but she took her sweet time doing so and acted like a fucking Celestial Dragon beforehand.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128376436 <br> dat chan <br> dat manga </br></br>    <br>Yes, and the guy who created it pronounces it like that too. Gel, gem, gin, gif.</br>  <br>The guy who created it got out-fucking-played by webms. His opinion doesn't mean a goddamn thing.</br>  <br>Syrno</br>  <br>Umaru never had a manipulative glasses-wearing bitch try to interfere in her family relationships because she was a selfish cunt who wanted her brother for herself, either.</br>  <br>THE BOTTOM LEFT LEGS AINT EVEN WTF??!?!?!?<br><br>YOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that if Manami had kept her big, fat, stupid fucking jewnose out of their buisness, Kirino wouldn't have secluded herself away from her brother, thereby depriving her of that essential "holy fuck, i shouldn't bang my brother" imprinting that comes in every sibling relationship. Manami is a shit, who caused her own downfall by butting in where she had no buisness.</br>  <br>How do you pronounce "Flandere"?</br>  <br><br> falling for blatant character assassination <br><br>Umaru also never had an author blatantly assassinate the childhood friend character without any foreshadowing whatsoever because there MUST be an incest end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pudding</br>  <br><br>You say that like male moeblobs can't exist.</br></br>  <br> character assassination <br>You're the type of idiot who screams "retcon" just because you didn't understand something. Fushimi actually forshadowed it from volume 1 or 2, I forgot which one exactly but as early as that.</br></br>  You fucks don't even know what moe even means  <br>Enlighten us.</br>  <br>I'll admit, the whole "fly into a blind rage, and start physically attacking Kirino and kicking Kyosuke in the stomach" thing was kind of out of character for someone who has been shown to be more passive aggressive than anything.</br>  <br>Now do yourself a favor next time and lurk moar</br>  <br>I would watch it</br>  <br>That I can understand but if you really did not see the Kirino - Manami conlict coming and that it affected the siblings relationship negatively you must have been blind and deaf.</br>  <br>Whe are we getting a proper season 3?</br>  <br>You could see it coming from the moment Kirino first described Manami as "that plain girl".</br>  <br>For a jimifag, I also found that scene very odd. But nonetheless, very very very satisfying.</br>  <br>And then the dumb bitch has the gall to confess to Kyosuke like she didn't just punch Kirino, the girl he loves, in the face and in the babymaker.</br>  <br><br>Might want to continue this in the Oreimo thread.</br></br>  <br> /A/ <br><br>I came here to post this<br><br> Do we really need to have the discussion on Good and bad, violent and non-violent tsundere again? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Are these people actually serious?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sora no Otoshimono?

When shall we commence the testing on this disgusting abomination of a creature?  <br>post webm version</br>  <br><br>  now I most shitpost my hate for kirino because  <br> I am indeed retarded and can not understand the title of the fucking anime nor can i read a book. <br><br> Thanks for proving my point.<br><br><br><br><br>  I get buttfustered about what size my "a" is! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so how's your first day on /a/ going newfriend?</br>  <br> newfriend <br> not the top kirino poster of 10000 kirino threads vs dutchguy. <br>I pity you faggot.</br></br></br>  just finished making it.<br>magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ZUA4FWDHBENIMNJ<wbr>5TEFYP52TZ4JECZCC&amp;dn=Highschool%20D<wbr>xD%20Born<br>or<br>https://thepiratebay.vg/torrent/121<wbr>47923</wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  Do you remember Softenni?  Remember what now?  A little.  I watched like 3 episodes then forgot about it  Blonde girl with the soft voice was the best.<br>The OP is great too.</br>  The only redeeming feature was the Eva reference scenes, the rest was just awful. <br><br>Actually the ED was OK, especially as it meant that the episode had ended.</br></br>  sleeper aots  Better than Teekyu or Milky Holmes<br><br>Fight me</br></br>  <br><br>Is she wearing panties underneath her panties?</br></br>  <br><br>Tennis panties are made to be shown, then real underwear is worn underneath.<br>Same as cheerleaders.</br></br></br>  I loved it  <br>these are tennis panties which you wear over your normal panties. And OP, of course I remember, sofuteni is actually one of my all time favourites. I know that it's shit but I still liked it. It will probably never get another season ;_;</br>  <br><br>I remember the suffering</br></br>  Of course I remember it for all the super-lewd close-ups.  Oh shit! Softenni thread!  <br><br><br><br>Best slut</br></br></br></br>  So we can all agree this is the best comedy of the season, yes?  <br>Who's the dad?<br><br>is it a nameless old bald man?</br></br></br>  <br>She literally  came on cookies she later fed him </br>  Failed the three episode rule. Fuck even Seitokai Yakuindomo was more then just added vulgarity and period jokes for the humor and shock value. Plus the censoring and bleeping doesn't add to the comedy and hurts it.  <br>   "love honey" <br>Fuck man, I couldn't stop thinking about it ever since that anon's spoiler post.</br></br>  <br> She was so happy. She broke down because none celebrated with her and their mothers treated pregnancy like a bad thing. She asked Tanukichi who is the most important person for him and he coudn't answer because Annie, Anna and Ayame popped in his mind and Ranko stopped him before he could say anything. </br>  Can /a/ figure out who this is supposed to be?  <br>Written in maybe. Even if that were the case atitudes about women in power which have not been formulated yet have no effect on the past. Surely you agree. Elizabeth, great queen and empress that she was could not have possibly influenced the people who died before she was born. <br><br>  unless she was... Also a Saber clone  </br></br></br>  Saber is a woman, but says she is a man, that's some tumblr shit.  <br>King Arthur.</br>  <br> a woman <br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>Shirou from an alternate timeline.</br>  Season 4 when?<br><br> Ryoko best Girl. </br></br>  <br> irrelevant logic </br>  <br>Universe is a great watch. I watched it first before the 1st season of the OVA. It is wacky star trekking space hijacks. With a hot, and sexy bounty hunter to boot.</br>  <br>A few months ago Kajishima released a doujin.<br>Only a few pages and no dialogue, it's mostly just a preview for what he has planned.<br>He just has to get it greenlit and produced, which is likely as Ai! Tenchi Muyo was successful in it's purpose, which was to gauge the interest in the franchise, and results were positive.</br></br></br>  <br>Never liked her. Too much of a Mary Sue.</br>    does /a/ like initial d?  NIGHT OF FIRE<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sw-<wbr>2EiWZ-QU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>HAH! GOT EEEM, HAH!!!</br>  <br>-NIGHT FEVER<br>HIGH FEVER</br></br>  I don't have a license, and I've never been in the driver's seat of a car so I don't feel like I can connect with it.  <br>I know what you mean.
