This adaptation is terrible.</br>  I don't like the ED. It's alright by itself, but it really doesn't fit with the rest of the show.  <br>The hallways are pretty empty and barren in the manga, but it really could have avoided using CG for it. Looks out of place.</br>  <br>Don't rub it in.</br>  <br><br>my little korean animators sure can't into cgi</br></br>  <br>Seriously why the fuck is so hard to put a lttle bit more effort on a single adaptation.</br>  <br>Holy shit, what a fucking bitch.<br>Please don't tell me this character has a fanbase.</br></br>  <br>Is it normal if there's a fucking dwarf on the left of this pic?</br>  <br>Nope, just bad animation.</br>  <br>But I'm the REAL anonymous. You're just some wannabe</br>  <br> Please don't tell me this character has a fanbase. <br>Fuck you, animeonlyfag. That's mai waifu you're talking about.</br></br>  This is why we can't have nice things. I literally couldn't make it through the episode.  <br>I think it's just a problem on your end buddy</br>  <br>You'll see soon. Love is a battlefield.</br>  The quality is pretty bad for a first episode.  <br>It got better as the episode went on though.</br>  <br>Looking closer, it looks like a photoshopped character.</br>  <br>Is it normal if there's a fucking dwarf in front of your monitor?</br>  <br>He's in a fucking chair.</br>  <br><br>This Xeno gets it.</br></br>  I've never read the manga but I am going to enjoy the anime and there is nothing you can do to stop me! HAHAHAHAHA!  <br>Drink milk.<br><br>No he's not.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can't see the chair, you should go to the oculist. Look his arm.</br>  <br>So sterile.

Even if he stood up, the proportions of his body are fucked up compared to the guy next to him. Anyway it's just fail animation.</br>  <br>So which one turns out to be a girl? <br><br>And which one dies?</br></br></br>  <br>My bets on the red head and the mexican</br>  <br>Well, one kisses a man and the other gets horribly beaten off-screen.</br>  <br><br> autistic faggots </br></br>  <br/>  So Gate and this, will have shitty threads always?  <br>I have to admit, this was pretty funny.</br>  <br>Just wait a day for the freshness to run out.</br>  <br>She's not as bad as it seems at first, you'll see why she said that later on.</br>  <br>Don't forget the shitty Monmuso threads.

Sorry for being lewd.</br>  <br>Mikasa is terrible too, don't lie to yourself.</br>  <br>No Jean go away.</br>    <br>Still too lewd.<br><br>Wholesome family bonding only, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's really Keith's son, obviously.</br>    <br>Nah Mikasa is loyal waifu to Eren. She will fight and protect him and vice versa they belong to each other. LM shippers can go die.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Better?</br>  <br>You say that like Eren and Mikasa are any better than Levi. Those three are the holy trinity of shit taste and worst characters.</br>  <br>LM is a terrible pairing. It forces together Mikasa who's in love with Eren and totally devoted to him with a boring manlet who's double her age.</br>  <br>Still can't believe MEN training days is finally happening. It feels so surreal.</br>  <br>Why do they have to make both Mikasa and shitlet so out of character in LM art?</br>  <br>Mikasa is more boring than manlet.</br>  <br>Not at all. Mikasa is entertaining and she serves as comedic relief, manlet is just boring.</br>  <br>Eren is a great character. He's got that fire in him you know. And i just love it when he goes crazy.</br>  <br>Because their fans are retarded, as expected of anyone who genuinely likes the Ackermen.</br>  <br>Because they are so delusional they think this would actually happen.</br>  <br>Eren is annoying.</br>  <br>You know it.</br>  <br>Eren is a retarded pussy.</br>  <br>Because in character art would just be them both doing nothing and looking retarded</br>  <br><br>Manlet fans please get out.</br></br>  <br>Oh calm down. No one is threatening EM by shipping LM.<br><br><br>Most shipping fanart is OOC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No but I did see your LM fanwank when the movie trailer came out.</br>  <br>Eren and Levi are equally terrible characters.</br>  Levi and Mikasa &gt; BRAYH  <br>Eren a  best </br>  <br>It's the most retarted pairing in SNK. And take your shit back to Tumblr.</br>  <br>What's wrong with enjoying some non-canon fan service? I know LM is delusional but I just like it, I can't change that.</br>    <br>Jean &gt; Levi and Shitkasa</br>  <br>One thing is enjoying non-canon fanservice and another is claiming that LM is now canon because the Levi OC kissed in a non-canon movie.</br>  Reminder that the best pairing has and always will be Eren and Annie  <br>Not him, but  I like both Bert and Eren. </br>  <br>And who do you like then mmm? Horseface?</br>  <br>Can't even deny tbh</br>  <br>I wasn't calling them canon, but I'm not going to lie I did enjoy it.</br>  <br> Jeanfags shitting on Mikasa </br>  <br>Why would being a Jeanfag mean you have to like Mikasa?</br>  <br>The guy in the movie isn't even manlet. Why so happy?</br>  <br>Sour grapes, etc.</br>  <br>Because she's his waifu</br>  <br>Armin is his waifu.</br>  <br>But I never did. Anyone who thinks the movie is canon is stupid and desperate to make a delusional ship canon.</br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>Fuck off fujo.</br>  <br>Reminder</br>  <br>It's obviously him. You'd have to either be retarded or in heavy denial to negate it.</br>  <br>Jean has more of a bond with Eren and Armin than his five minute crush on worst shingeki Mikasa.</br>  <br>No one here ever claimed the movie was canon, calm down.</br>  <br>Just give it up, Eren prefers blondes.</br>  Dumblr linked these threads, explains why they're so bad and full of shitletfags  <br>nope</br>  <br>She's still his waifu whether you like it or not.</br>  <br>Shikishima is inspired by canon Levi. The fact that someone with similar mannerisms and the same title as Levi kissed Mikasa was enough to make some of us LMfags happy. It's not a big deal, it's not canon anyway.</br>  <br> five minute crush <br> has been into her for over 3 years <br> implying it hasn't turned into love <br> implying he won't die a pathetic death protecting her and she won't even notice him </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. When was the last time they even held a conversation?</br>  <br>Nay he likes blackhaired asian girls.</br>  What are the chances we'll get more chibi episodes when season 2 rolls around? I rather enjoyed the meta humour in them.  <br>Mikasa's mom?</br>  <br>How would you know that unless you had a tumblr yourself?</br>  <br>Them why he is not called Levi?</br>  <br/>  <br>Those were cute.</br>  <br><br>I really wanted to watch that movie until i saw that fucking trailer. Some manlet imposter kisses Mikasa and she allows it wtf! Mikasa would not allow that except if it was Eren.</br></br>  <br>To keep the fujos from dropping the series all together, which would be a big loss since they seem to dominate the fanbase now.</br>  Reminder that Eren would rather bang Historia, Annie and Armin than Mikasa.  <br>Because they thought his fans would flip if he was portrayed poorly. They made changes to save their ass.</br>  <br>Look at this lesbian.</br>  <br>Fuck you. You know what i mean. Even if Mikasa is half she looks Asian.</br>  <br>Eren thinks Mikasa is an annoying cunt.</br>  <br> wtf <br>Isayama might've worked on the script but it's not canon. Calm down.</br></br>  <br>Blonde hair</br>  <br> has a crush on Eren <br> lesbian </br></br>  <br>Isayama pls</br>  <br>hahaha he would rather kill Annie and why the fuck would he like Historia? He sees her more as a dear friend. Besides she is a lesbian.</br>  <br>Lesbian wondering how to scissor now.</br>  <br>Devil spawn Bert never ceases to amuse me. Let's hope he gets the Annie, or at least gets close to saving her.</br>  <br> hahaha <br>Try harder.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> implying <br> Isayama's top 5 are Reiner, Annie, Ymir and Historia </br></br>  <br>She's telling Eren about that night Ymir fucked her until she passed out for days.</br>  <br> Marie appearance. <br>FUCK, she's in every Persona game now she's invading this manga? God dammit, Atlus. Give it a rest already.</br></br>  <br>While I don't see BA realistically happening, I'm glad there's someone who loves Annie in universe. I hope he manages to show her she is cared for.</br>  <br>Keep dreaming man.</br>  <br>YHfags on full damage control.</br>  <br>I think he was trying to rape her mouth. Mikasas was resisting.</br>  <br>I like Ymir's beard there.</br>  <br>I don't think Isayama would allow BRA to ever be happy again</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>She have been for a long time now.</br>  <br>Ymir fucked her first, never forget.</br>  <br> Historia will never get this wet again </br>  <br>They see each other just as siblings.</br>  <br>She does look rather handsome with one</br>  <br>Ymir's penis broke off and is always inside Historia to remind her who her real man is.</br>  <br>I feel really bad for Mikasa. The only thing worse than losing your man to another woman is losing your man to a dyke.</br>  Can someone explain the point of shipping. Are you so desperate for some romance in your life that you have to resort to fantasize about fictional characters being in love with each other?  <br>Good thing she got over that lesbian phase.</br>    <br>At least they can be happy in their dreams.  In my dreams, too ;_; </br>  <br>Yeah but knowing the Japanese. A love triangle will come out of it. Fucking manlet.</br>    <br>The girls in this series are all shit, so instead of the usual waifu wars /a/ has, SnK has to resort to shipping.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Doesn't NGE have both?</br>  <br>See</br>  <br>If you're in this shitty thread you must not have much of a love life yourself.</br>  <br><br><br>Why do you guys even like that female on testosterone? Never in an anime before have i seen such an annoying creature.</br></br></br>  <br>Historia only sees Eren as her friend.</br>  <br>Dat Annie ass</br>  <br>That feel when my fake spoilers made it into the OP.</br>  <br/>  <br>I've seen it, I read the manga unlike you, that isn't it.</br>  <br>Hanji?</br>  <br>Nope, Reiner did.</br>   It's time   <br>Marie or baby Eren's birth?</br>  <br> Feels the need to shop the pic <br>Damage control much?</br></br>  <br>Is this a spoiler for the new chapter?</br>  A reminder to all the shitposters. The only important pairing in SNK is Eren and Mikasa the rest can go die.  This shit is so slow and it keeps leaving everyone asking more questions. Why do I still put myself through this?  <br>For Allah shitposting? You bet.</br>  <br>Reiner please, go back to being a homo.</br>  <br> editing fanart <br> damage control </br></br>  <br>True.</br>  <br> check out the tags on pixiv <br> tt's Ymir and Historia <br><br>EHfags desperate again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not shooped</br>  <br>But EH is delusional.</br>  <br>That wasn't me.</br>    <br>What is wrong with you? Didn't you read the replies? Even Hanji is more feminine then that beast of an Ymir.</br>  <br>Eren is going to die of cancer.</br>  <br>That drawing is so stupid.<br><br>And why the fuck is Bert blushing.</br></br></br>  <br>EH BTFO by a leaf dildo.</br>  <br>This is the original actually.</br>    <br>What a handsome gorilla.</br>  <br> &gt;And why the fuck is Bert blushing. <br><br>You are so cute anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Reiner pls.</br>  Cutest titan? I think pic related is  <br>Pregnant titan was the cutest</br>  <br>Hehe</br>  <br>Bert likes the Gorilla.</br>  <br>What's the story behind the leaf?</br>  <br>It's a leaf dildo actually.</br>  <br>It represents Ymir's transpenis.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>It is a symbolism for lesbian sex.</br>  <br>The leaf is Historia's virginity.</br>  <br> implying Ymir needs a dildo <br>Cisscum detected.</br></br>    <br>It represents YHfag delusions. It will dry out eventually.</br>  Reiner and Bertold is shit<br>Ymir and Historia is shit<br>This is the true pairing</br></br>  When did they become so fat?  <br> studio xebec <br>did you miss what they did to triage x ?</br></br>  <br>They're getting old anon</br>  is it just me or did Rito's voice change?  <br>On first glance, you would think they were using CGI.</br>  <br>Which had the same character designer as TLR, right?<br>And if you go by that, they got fat in S1.</br></br>  Why is this franchise still going?<br>Haven't they explored every possible scenario that doesn't involve penetrative sex?<br>Are they going to keep them in high school for twenty years?</br></br>  <br> That bit rate </br>   Had multiple seasons pass <br> Still in the same grade </br>  This looks like what happened to Maken-ki. Why do they have to ruin all their shit?  <br> Haven't they explored every possible scenario that doesn't involve penetrative sex? <br>Well, there's still plenty of material left to be animated.</br></br>   Localization never   <br>holy shit</br>  <br>uncensored when?</br>  <br>In the manga.</br>  Fucking Xebec ruining yet another season.  <br>isnt this by the same studio that made the last season?<br>How did they fucked up so bad? even the voices sound off.</br></br>  what is the point of monogatari other than dude meets bunch of girls<br><br>like what is it leading up to<br><br>its got good songs though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Character development and relationships. If you don't want that, then don't watch Monogatari.</br>  <br> replying to bait with bait </br>  Watch it and figure it out for yourself. <br>It might not even have a point, or you might have to use your noodle and come up with one :)</br>  <br>It's literally the greatest story ever told in any medium ever all time.</br>  <br>That's what makes the world go 'round.<br>Backwards.</br></br>  It's about character development, relationships, and tits.

When Koyomi?<br>When Owari?<br>When  Kizu ?<br>When Tsugi novel?<br>Is Monogatari dead?</br></br></br></br>    <br> November </br>  Character development  :^)   <br>The character development in Monogatari is great. It's too bad the best characters don't get much.</br>  <br>Hope you're not talking about Shinobu. <br>She get's pretty much the most character development of anyone in the series</br></br>  <br>Yeah he was talking about monkey.</br>  <br>She never gets any real character development, just the temporary illusion of it. The good character development goes to Bee, Bird, Monkey, and Crab.</br>  <br> bee <br> bird <br> character development <br><br>Wow. I mean they get more than other series give their characters but compared to the main cast, including bat, that's laughable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Cat. Can't forget Cat.<br><br>You don't know what character development really means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Do you? <br>Bat went from sulking emo, to haughty banter, flashbacked to her all-powerful and also suicidal self, and now an arrogant and knowledgeable but also insecure child. <br><br>Bee on the other hand didn't change at almost. <br>And Bird fucking can't by definition.<br><br>Maybe you should think before you post?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character development doesn't mean literal character development, anon. It means girls cutting their hair. Lurk more.</br>  <br> nice meme </br>  <br> Mentions bee and bird <br> Doesn't mention Cat </br></br>  <br><br>NisiOisiN puns.</br></br>   Visuals <br> Music <br> Character Development <br> Shitposting <br> Waifus <br><br>I think that's all of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot about her for a second. She's bland enough for that to happen. And of course I mentioned Bee, she has the most memorable character development moment of them all.</br>  <br>forgot to post picture of objective and undisputed best girl</br>  <br><br> ex dee le ebin meme </br></br>    The Monogatari series is supposed to be objectively shitty.    <br>Why do you make yourself so easy to identify? You know that's avatarfagging, right? Also, why are you always on a phone?</br>  <br>Because he keeps getting replies.</br>   everyone replying with muh character development and relationships <br><br>So its basically the M rated Friends of anime?</br></br>  <br>No. Monogatari has funny humor.</br>  <br>I'd like to see her character arc If you know what I mean</br>  <br>Didn't laugh ojnce when I was watching bake. I wouldn't call it a comedy</br>  <br>If you condensed Friends into a show 10 times smaller and also gave it some overarching plot then yes.</br>  <br>Monogatari doesn't have overarching plot until Second Season.</br>  <br>It does though, it's just not obvious until the second season.</br>  Shaft is the best modern studio<br>No questions asked</br>  <br>SHAFT isn't even a good studio in the first place, they made like 4 good shows.</br>  <br>If it wasn't for bake and Madoka they'd be as irrelevant as deen.

It's funny,avant-garde, has good character banters (which is the main point of the series since it's character driven) and has good OST, that's literally it though.</br>  <br> using avant garde unironicaly </br>  <br>Avant-garde just means experimental and innovative. It fits Monogatari perfectly.</br>  <br>Do girls irl also cut their hair like this</br>    <br>poor man's Ikuhara, they're not innovative at all.</br>  I want to marry Cat  <br>hanegawa is best girl</br>  <br>https://aninomiyako.wordpress.com/2<wbr>011/11/13/ikuhara-school-directors-<wbr>utenas-legacy/<br><br> Both Shinbo‘s and Ikuhara‘s style have their roots in Dezaki‘s work and consequently in the philosophy of Tezuka Productions, which is the school of pursuing maximum effect with limited animation. <br><br>Still, the visuals are not the only avant-garde thing about it. The label is for the LNs too: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monog<wbr>atari_%28series%29<br><br> Genre: Avant-garde, occult detective, romantic comedy </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Nothing. And unlike these other anons, I see what you mean and agree with you. In Bakemonogatari, there's a coming of age arc that Araragi has throughout the entire series. After Bake though, there's pretty much no larger story whatsoever.</br>  <br>Second Season has more of an overarching plot than Bake.</br>  <br>It ceases to be avant garde when they make a template out of that style. Every single SHAFT work post Tsukuyomi Moon Phase is pretty much the same thing. It's not experimental anymore.</br>  <br>i fucking hate this neck shit so bad it makes me hate first girl when i shouldnt</br>  <br> Still, the visuals are not the only avant-garde thing about it. </br>  <br>The backgrounds in Monogatari are avant-garde. The text occasionally flashing in the screen is avant-garde. The sudden shift in artstyle is avant-garde.</br>  <br>Whats there to hate?<br><br>Also can anyone outSHAFT her?</br></br></br>  <br>Not anymore.</br>  <br>Take out the visuals from Bake and you have an episodic harem centered around character interactions<br><br>Take out the visuals from Madoka and you get Nanoha<br><br>Take out the visuals from Mekaku and you get shit<br><br>Take out the visuals from Nisekoi and you get a generic romcom<br><br>Take out the visuals from Hidamari and you get Geijutsuka Art Design Class<br><br>Take out the visuals from Maria Holic and you get tumblr</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When did I mention other SHAFT shows?</br>  <br> Take out the visuals from Nisekoi and you get a generic romcom <br>You don't need to do that, it's already the very definition of a generic romcom.</br></br>  <br>It's not a fucking template, it's a series.<br>Having a series get an art shift for no reason is stupid, SZS looking at you. Avant-garde does not mean random shit made to look new and exciting. It's a style that is not well established being used and it's done to great effect in monogatari. <br><br>Other shaft shows occasionally look similar but they are not done in the same style.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it just pisses me off. Nobody does this other than severely retarded people</br>  <br>There are very few, if any romcoms/harems that feature similar wordplay, metahumor and character interactions comparable to Nisio's writing style.</br>  <br>I saw an ad for clothes at K-mart where the model was doing that.</br>  <br>I don't remember her looking like that. Where is it from?</br>  <br>I saw a picture from post civil war south of black people doing that in trees</br>  Which *monagatari girl could fit the most dicks inside of them at once?  <br>Kabuki, in SS.</br>  <br>Monkey</br>  <br>Nisio</br>  <br>Snake<br>It's always snake</br></br>  <br>Kiss-Shot.</br>  <br>I want to fit my dick inside most of them does that count</br>  <br>Kaiki</br>  Do people hate on monogatari because its cool now?  <br>Snake<br><br>Shes a legit semen demon</br></br></br>  <br>Best selling TV series of all time, son.

The more dialogue, the better.</br></br></br>  <br> too much exposition and uneccesary dialogue </br>  <br>Ok so if she tried killing a family member of yours, you would forgive that?<br><br>And why the fuck did he didnt kill that other cunt?<br><br><br> A man being beaten by a girl. <br> Nisio is actually a good writer <br><br>Unless this is typical japanese behavior, which I think not, then most MEN would bloody murder half the cast for what they done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Araragi understood where Yozuru was coming from. He didn't agree with it but he understood her actions and ideals, chose to oppose it and then beat her at her own game, using her rules. <br><br>At that point, the matter is settled and given Kanbaru and Hanekawa exist at that point - people Araragi has explicitly made friends with even though they've basically gone Yozuru-tier and fucked his shit up- Araragi is just that foolishly and irrationally forgiving. <br><br>It's not logical by any stretch, if someone fucks you up twice, you would think to stop being friends with them but he's still friends with Hanekawa. <br>Unlike Hanekawa and Kanbaru, Yozuru actually had a reason to go attack an immortal oddity. Though Kaiki deliberately sending his attack dog after Tsukihi was the legit dick move since he knew Tsukihi would get fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone haven´t read Medaka Box.</br>  I just started neko and dont know if i can deal with this shit. <br><br>Hana is obviously best girl and the only girl the MC loves. But he was basically forced into a relationship and still cant actually figure out why he is in it. <br><br>The more i watch this show the more terrified I am this shit is going to get nasty as fuck. <br><br>Is shit about to get real? if they make more TV of this should i just stop at the prequel? <br><br>This is why I didnt watch the second season of oerimo at all.

It's incredible how SHAFT's art was considerably darker compared to the following seasons. The use of lightning and music really underlines the gravity of situation.<br><br>Despite SS being overall better than Bake, it definitely has a special touch to it.</br></br>  <br> It's incredible how SHAFT's art was considerably darker compared to the following seasons <br>Incidentally that was at least partially caused by budget constraints. Hence those spoopy real life stills and such.</br></br>  <br>Bake definitely feels a lot more "special" than the rest of the series. Even if it was just because of budget, I kinda miss the 3DPD.</br>  <br> It's incredible how SHAFT's art was considerably darker compared to the following seasons. <br>I really hope they go back to Oishi as the episode director. I agree that SS is stronger in terms of material but Bake feels like it contains the 'real' monogatari art style while the sequels contain an inferior imitation.  And in this case the imitation hasn't tried hard enough to become better than the real thing .</br></br>  <br> Despite SS being overall better than Bake <br>U wot m8?</br></br>  <br> Crabfags still think Bake is better than SS. </br>  <br>I thought so too. The budget part didn't hit me the first time but now, I can clearly see it, especially compared to the more recent iterations like Tsuki.<br><br><br>She was so fugly.<br><br><br> And in this case the imitation hasn't tried hard enough to become better than the real thing. <br>I remember saying that exact sentence in my critic the first time I got to finish Nise. Shit was so bad it's the only Monogatari I actually deleted from my HD. I wish SHAFT would stop being so memey and go back to the "simple and efficient" style of Bake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it has by far a better direction though</br>  <br>Very true.</br>  <br>Otori and Kabuki by themselves are just as good as Bake. You can't ignore scenes and settings like world end and yukata scene, or the awesome char dev of Cat and Bat.<br>Add Shinobu Time on top of it and it easily surpasses Bake. I only disliked Oni but that's just my yandere rejection instinct.</br></br>  <br>  I wish SHAFT would stop being so memey and go back to the "simple and efficient" style of Bake. <br>That's a good way of putting it, but it's not just efficiency. For example, I don't think Oishi would have let the CGI snakes abomination at the end of SS fly even if the budget was limited. Actually, Bake uses very little CGI in general for something with a limited budget.</br></br>  <br>Intriguing dialogue.</br>  I love SHAFT. I still find Madoka, SZS and, to a less rewatchable degree, *monogatari to be thoroughly enjoyable series on several levels.<br><br>I never thought I'd want to have sex with cats, monkeys, children and corpses before but now I do.</br></br>  <br> implying Geijutsuka's visuals are bad <br><br>I'm sorry but Satoko Kiyuzuki is about as based as Ume.<br><br>Also, VN translation fucking where.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said GA was bad.</br>  <br>My bad, I really messed up my Gataries. I meant Neko and Kabuki were really great. The only one I dislike was Otori.</br>  <br> hating on nise <br><br>Worst sort of pretentious taste<br>Nise was one of the better seasons, better than the OVAs for sure.<br><br>The only non-retarded criticism ever fielded against it is "muh pacing" and even then if you are disappointed about a lot of character dialogue and interaction in your character drama you are retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari really opens up one's tastes.<br><br><br>I think the real life stills were used best in Hitagi Crab.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SZS and PPD would be pretty unique even without visuals, and even with Bake, it's not like there are a whole lot of episodic harems centered around character interactions, puns, and magical spirit trauma therapy.</br>  <br>Dude, Nise is widely regarded as one of the worst seasons of the series, alongside Neko (tho I really enjoyed the latter). It's basically the season that broke away from Bake's aforementioned qualities and went full "fan service subversion". It doesn't just have "pacing issues", most of the scenes themselves had no point, and there was an almost total lack of overarching plot. The sole purpose of 1/2 of the season was to needlessly "check on the girls of Bake", endlessly delaying Bee's exposition and solving the issue with a half-assed excuse like "it's gonna go away with some time". The thefts didn't go away with time. All of it then led to rushed Bird with an unnecessarily violent one-sided fight.</br>  <br>Not hating on Nise, but the OVAs were great. Even Neko Kuro which people hate on because it's easy to.</br>  <br>Yes, by idiots. <br>People complaining about the fanservice are retarded. There was hardly more of it than bake. Phoenix 1 is the only place where it wasn't really necessary but it was still enjoyable. <br>Other than that scene everything has a point. Points like characterization and character development, there is so much that we find out about the characters that's introduced in Nise. Plot advancement and character introductions. Not to mention the themes that get explored which are totally lacking in arcs like neko kuro and tsuki.<br><br>And if you missed the whole point of the resolution in bee then I can't help you. But it does explain your retarded opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have loved to debate about those so-called qualities but I definitely can't argue with someone that calls "retarded" on every opinion that is not his.<br>And please note that there is absolutely no mention of incest in Bake. Nise was considerably lewder than Bake, and that's a point you absolutely and objectively can't deny.</br></br>  <br> There was hardly more of it than bake. <br><br>What? two episodes out of 11 were entirely devoted to fanservice in Nise</br></br></br>  <br> there is absolutely no mention of incest in Bake <br>How the hell is that relevant? If you're so upset about me calling you retarded maybe you shouldn't act like it so much. <br>What is that a fanservice multiplier? Is everything at x3 now? <br><br>Also you're wrong. Crab basically jerks Araragi off in the car with her dad in it because she has an Electra complex.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There was hardly more of it than bake <br>You're just wrong, the toothbrush scene was an entire episode.</br></br>  <br>In the novel, how does the scene play out differently?</br>  <br>One episode, Phoenix 1 like I said. <br>Everywhere else the fanservice was on top of other stuff like exposition and character interaction and development.<br>Bake had plenty of it too.<br>Hitagi strip in crab, Mayoi get groped in snail, ironically enough nothing in monkey, snake rape in snake and Tsubasa prancing around half naked in cat. <br>Not to mention the car scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus. Even the Snake scenes were outright attempt at seduction in Nise. The bath scene was borderline hentai (though it served for some nice Shinobu exposition), and the toothbrush scene was... Oh fuck, I don't even see why I'm bothering to state the obvious to some random rude idiot.</br>  <br>The scene is basically the same in the novel, except there's some more dialogue when they're walking from the car to the star-viewing spot. The anime cut the right material because the quiet walk was more effective.</br>  <br>You have some nerve to include some of those as fanservice and deny an entire episode of naked shinobu bathing with araragi</br>  <br> the Snake scenes were outright attempt at seduction in Nise <br>Yes and? How does that make it not character development? It was a hell of a lot more than snake got in bake. The bath scene was also used for a bunch of bat character development as well as general plot exposition. <br><br>Like I said three fucking times now the toothbrush scene is the only one you could describe as pointless. Pointing it out like it's a hole in my argument over and over again does nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's really cute; And he's Araragi.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Is there any point in arguing about the fanservice? Even the scenes that are dedicated to fanservice are either important for advancing the plot (like Shinobu finally reconciling with Araragi in the bath scene) or are hilarious (like the toothbrush).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I deny that? Maybe you could go and find where I said Nise has no fanserivice? Or that it has less than bake? <br>Oh wait, I said <br> There was hardly more of it than bake <br>As in yes nise had more.<br>But bake also had a lot.<br>And the stuff in nise was not pointless and was relevant, barring toothbrush scene.<br>And the toothbrush scene was entertaining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The bath scene was a damn good introduction of Shinobu as a character and it's the sort of scene that gets even better when you watch it with more information. You're a moron if you dismiss it as "just fanservice". Fanservice isn't evil. It's just a pain in the ass when the entire story grinds to a halt for it, but Monogatari almost never does that.</br>  <br>She's ugly</br>  <br>That's my point. That's why I said that dismissing nise because of the fanservice is retarded. <br>Because a) bake has it too, every season does<br>and b) it doesn't hurt the show.</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that it developed absolutely nothing. Snake really got the short end of the stick in the series, considering it was really obvious from the start that she was infatuated with Muraragi and it never really got away from that part (tho Kaiki helped with that).</br>  <br>the point is that nise had more fanservice than bake. plain and simple. anyone denying it is just deluded</br>  <br>The thing is that my  post, I never, not even once, spoke about fan service, and you came up with it almost instantly. You seem to be pretty hasty to shoot yourself in the foot argument-wise considering you decided to bring up a commonly hated part of the series.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? It showed her overwhelmingly cute an stupid personality, just how much into Araragi she was, her relationship with her parents not to mention highlighting Araragi's denseness and paving the path for the developments in otori.</br>  <br>Are you kidding? You said <br> went full "fan service subversion" <br>In the second sentence.<br><br>Am I being rused?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I agree with you about that. I don't know who's who so I just tagged a bunch of posts.</br>  <br>But that says nothing about the quality of Nise. Like I said. Fanservice isn't bad. Stopping the story for it is bad. The only scene you can argue does that is the toothbrushing scene. But one scene doesn't make an entire season bad.</br>  <br>And nobody here has said otherwise so your post has no point.</br>  <br>It's not just hardly more. It's a lot more.</br>  <br>On a related note, I like how, unlike in most harems, the MC's denseness leads to very dire consequences.</br>  <br>But there isn't. <br>Nise has one scene of snake lewds, one of monkey lewds, bat bath and bee toothbrush and that's it.<br><br>People just seem to not remember the rest of the season for some reason.<br>Probably because they are retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Araragi <br> dense <br><br>People are in for a surprise once Owari is adapted</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if he's not dense he's reckless and thoughtless.<br><br>The shit he puts cat and snake through is not cool.</br></br></br>  <br> her overwhelmingly cute an stupid personality <br>Oh come on, wasn't it obvious from the start?<br> just how much into Araragi she was <br>Fair enough.<br> her relationship with her parents <br>Was done much better in Otori and the parents actually appeared then, which helped to understand the gravity of the situation.<br> highlighting Araragi's denseness <br>I like the fact that you speak about this because that's a part of the show that I feel is out-of-character with Araragi as it was in Bake. Sure, he never saw that Tsubasa was in love with him but, to be fair, it wasn't clear enough IMO. Araragi is stated to be a rather intelligent man, tho he's rather stubborn about the ways to solve problems. To have him not notice an obvious attempt at seduction makes him a generic bland harem MC, which he obviously isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because there was too much fanservice compared to Bake? Nise only had 11 episodes and people only remember the fanservice</br>  <br>Damn, the tape's actually pretty good.</br>  <br>It's not that he doesn't notice, it just he doesn't seem to particularly care. I mean maybe he expects them to just suck it up and deal with it because he's off the market but he expects too much.<br><br>I mean he treats snake in nise exactly like he treats cat. He doesn't bother putting any distance between them and leads them on.</br></br></br>  <br>But there wasn't. The people who only remember fanservice are retarded.</br>  <br>He constantly gets dismembered so it's okay right?</br>  <br>Oh he pays for his shit that's for sure and I would say learns from it. It's just the way he treated cat especially was a bit hard to watch.</br>  <br>No. The fact is that Nise didn't just have an increase in fan service, it also had a bad balance in storytelling and characterization. It's also a result of the direct jump from the Bake-style to the modern style and the most memorable scenes became instantly what the show highlighted so hard: ecchi. Bake used a clever mix of fantasy, romcom and ecchi with a simple overaching plot and actually dangerous and threatening aberrations. Nise broke away from a lot of these qualities, and the contrast was therefore all the more jarring that the ecchi got highlighted so much.</br>  <br>The point of Araragi is that he's fairly smart, but (as other characters say all the time) he only sees what is directly in front of him.<br><br>With Cat, he was in love with her after Kizu but decided he didn't love her after Neko Kuro. He didn't notice her feelings for him because he was too focused on sorting out his own feelings. He also saw her as some kind of goddess and didn't think it was possible for someone like Hanekawa to fall in love with someone like him in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>I recall Hanekawa outright asking Araragi if he was aware of her feelings in the commentaries. I think he just avoided the question so he might have been aware. It's been a while and I don't have the bake commentaries downloaded right now so I'm not sure</br>  <br>How did it have that?<br>You haven't explained that at all yet. <br><br>Or do you just dislike that the whole occult vibe was gone with meme. I mean it's fine if it's that but that is very much a subjective critique and should be labeled as such.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Even the Snake scenes were outright attempt at seduction in Nise <br>I agree that Nise had more fanservice overall (this seems pretty obvious, honestly), but for Snake specifically, half of her arc in Bake was her doing a handbra or being raped by a spirit.</br></br>  <br>no he didnt he lied, thats what conmen do.</br>  <br>I listened to that commentary recently. He tries avoiding the question by talking about how MCs only seem to have lots of people with crushes on them because it's how they interpret the situation. Hanekawa keeps pressing and he says that he honestly didn't know. She gets mad at him.</br>  <br>Reread <br>Nise lacked emotional impact, in short. The only scene that actually did something on that part was, ironically, the bath scene.<br><br><br>I'm not saying it wasn't sexy but Nadeko doing a handbra was actually a natural posture resulting from uncovering her cursed body. It certainly looks sexy, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the intended effect. Not gonna comment on the "spirit rape".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1) Visuals <br>2) Characters<br>3) Fanservice<br><br><br>I think what Bake has that the others don't quite have is the same sense of atmosphere. The visuals and cuts and dialogue really worked together in a great way. I don't know if it's really Oishi's doing like people always say, because I don't know anything about the guy, but someone was synthesizing Bake's elements really well, and the follow-ups haven't been quite up to par in that department.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  It certainly looks sexy, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the intended effect <br>If you mean it wasn't intended by Nadeko, then sure, I agree. If you mean it wasn't intended by the showrunners/Nisio, then I definitely don't.</br></br>  <br><br>what is the point of life other than dude doesn't meet bunch of girls<br><br>like what is it leading up to<br><br>its got good songs though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was supposed to be funny? I think you actually laughing at a scene like that is funnier than this piece of shit.</br>  <br>Really, Crab kidnapping Arargi and then later facing Kaiki lacked emotional impact? Bee's fight with Araragi lacked impact? Bird's death in Phoenix and the subsequent showdown lacked impact? <br>That's bullshit. Maybe there were not as many points because there were less arcs but that does not make it bad.</br></br>  <br><br>He was being an idiot. It's partly because of his self-loathing and lack of self-esteem, and partly because he actually believed what he said, he thought that Hanekawa had no feelings and was just being nice to everyone. I guess you could give him the excuse that she is a well respected and adored class pres, but Neko Kuro proved he was a chickenshit when it came to relationships.<br><br>Basically Araragi was too self-absorbed to handle her loving him at that point. Not that dating Senjougahara completely fixed that, since it'll take until Owari before that problem is dealt with.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> being lewd wasn't intended by Nadeko </br></br>  <br>I wish your life had good songs. All mine has is a bunch of guys in their basements screaming about how they feel like "showing their everything to me." I've been thinking about filing a restraining order.</br>  <br>HanaKana wanted to play a villain and Nisio gave in and we got Otori.</br>  <br>Yes but even in bake, she specifically chose to wear the swimsuit.<br>Also she kept telling Araragi to watch.<br><br>Snake was always a lewd slut.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The obvious difference in staff between Bake and the sequels is Oishi Tatsuya being the episode director of Bake but not being involved at all in the sequels. Dude also has the reputation of being Shinbou's "true" protege, so that's probably where the assumption comes from.</br>  <br>People like to say that Nisio completely changed the story to accommodate HanaKana but all the factors were there from when she was first introduced. He could've resolved her arc without making her an outright villain, but Nisio had a clear idea of her true character from at least the time Nise was being written.</br>  <br> Crab kidnapping Arargi <br>Actually, this part gave me more a huge questioning ahoge than feels<br> facing Kaiki <br>No matter how much the issue was brought up first, the simple fact of knowing that Hitagi and Kaiki are somehow related didn't give the scene any impact. Kaiki was MUCH better depicted in Koimono, where he outright stole all the spotlights and walked out with an Oscar trophy without looking back.<br> Bee's fight with Araragi lacked impact? <br>Sure, at some point, the fraternal fight could have some impact considering it dealt with Bee's and Muraragi's meanings of justice clashing, if only it wasn't so chuuni and ended up doing nothing regarding Karen's obsession with justice.<br> Bird's death in Phoenix <br>Can't be any more impact than a shock surprise when said char can't die.<br> subsequent showdown <br>Read  "unnecessarily violent one-sided fight". Kanbaru's fight was understandable as it was the exposition of her sexual desires and frustrations given form as the result of her wish. The fight vs. Doll's master was just dramatized.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> knowing that Hitagi and Kaiki are somehow related <br>Not somehow related, he was he one that duped her when she had the crab. How did that not give the scene any impact?<br><br> ended up doing nothing regarding Karen's obsession with justice <br>Also no true, she at the very least realized that there were fight she could not win.<br><br> Can't be any more impact than a shock surprise when said char can't die. <br>I don't know what you're trying to say here exactly but Arargi's reaction was where the impact was.<br><br> unnecessarily violent one-sided fight <br>Just like every fight in monogatari? <br>It was a perfect reflection on Bee's fight last arc and a contrast of Yozuru and Bee's, as well as Yozuru and Araragi's characters. Monkey's fight in bake was more visceral but this fight had more of a thematic point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nise was one of the better seasons, better than the OVAs for sure. <br>Better than most of them, but I'd put it on par with Tsuki.</br></br>  <br>Tsuki was not even the best OVA</br>  <br>Hanafag?</br>  <br><br>He did love her in Neko Kuro, Oshino even calls him out on it when he tries to bullshit it. <br><br>The whole last encounter was about showing how complex their relationship really is. <br><br>For instance he says that he would be there for her, but read the LN, and his words take a rather self-centered turn. To summarize, he wanted her to remain perfect because he was lost and she was his guide. The "if you turn delinquent, what am I supposed to do?!"was a striking part of that scene. It's why she asked him in Tiger if it was okay to be human.<br><br>Skip to Nise, and he says that she is like a second mother to him. And in Tsubasa Song, he jumped for joy at the prospect of going on a date with her.<br><br>Then there was the scene in Owari where he begs her at the airport before her trip around the world to stay by his side on his knees in tears.<br><br>He loves her, but it's something really complicated. Most people get it wrong when they say it's only lust. She is a pillar for him, and that doesn't ever really change.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they arent related. and the only thing he stole was childrens money, he was boring and the most disgusting character in the show.</br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>What I don't get is how can Araragi be self-absorbed and not give a damn about his well-being at the same time</br>  <br>Bake characters are starting to suffer from sameface.</br>  <br>I can respect your opinion on that. Hana didn't click for me, but I respect it for what it is.<br><br><br>No you're starting to suffer from sameface!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who else does she look like?</br>  <br>Does Kanbaru use pet shampoo for her monkey hand?</br>  <br>It's not that I didn't enjoy tsuki. and likewise I can see why people disliked hana but I did not like how shallow tsuki was.</br>  <br>Everyone doing that same smirk?</br>  <br>used*</br>  <br>Thats a facial expression. People make it at times.</br>  <br>Where are you getting this? At the very least her eye shape is completely unique.</br>  <br>You mean like the Dreamworks smirk?</br>  Post LN art  <br>Shampoo and Conditioner.</br>  <br>Crab's thighs have gotten thicker. I approve.</br>    <br>Anyone else think that Kanbaru was GOAT? Inb4 animal joke.</br>  We need more furries.  <br>Nah, that doesnt work with sword and board armies. You would have to systematically take out each over-seer with sniper fire. Even then, their advance would not allow such a thing to happen. While the JSDF over-reacted with fucking artillery, we wouldnt waste howitzer rounds on something a .50cal would have more effect on. After the first engagement and annihilation of the Imperial Army, we would probably start firing more INTO than at the secondary Unified Army that came rolling up or firing smoke rounds out of mortars just to fuck with them and make them go away. We even have tear-gas like rounds that do that, or put gas rounds into a Mk19 or fire sim-rounds (look like orange balls) at them as a kind of non-lethal approach. This is all speculative, as you are aware.</br>  <br>The fact that there were soldiers riding dragons during the Ginza incident implies that they can be domesticated/tamed.</br>  <br>In the anime they use small dragons as rides, but in the manga they are wyverns. Though the flame dragon is a different kind of dragon that seems to be special and more powerful.</br>  <br>Hardy would probably step in as soon as they try taming her dragons.</br>  <br>Those were the smaller drakes, relatives of the dragons (analogous to our Wyverns) which the JSDF has been killing for meat and scales for a while now. A full-blown Elder Dragon like the Red wouldn't be tameable.</br>     inb4 +250 in-between animation screencaps   <br> QUALITY <br> Denpa Kyoushi <br>Sure, but it's a bit like shooting fish in a barrel.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you it still counts</br>  was there no new episode this week?<br> I like it </br>    <br>I'm still in shock in how Passione could go from something as terribly animated and drawn as Rail Wars to Rokka no Yuusha which looks and is animated beautifully.</br>  <br> Last episode spent four weeks worth of budget. Was still QUALITY 3/4 of the time. <br><br>They had to take a time out</br></br></br>    <br>Sadly, this actually looks like one of the better shots, unless I am missing something huge.</br>  <br> Couldn't even be bothered to color in half of the faces </br>      <br>Besides the desks made for 3m high people?<br> and try to pass off as shadow. You aren't wrong about one of the better scenes though.</br></br>  <br>Off topic, but is it some kind of meme to translate this guy's name wrong?</br>  Why does Denpa Kyoushi look like an anime from a decade ago?  rail wars is cheating      This was around the point I couldn't take any more. I mean, fucking hell.   what is perspective   <br>The focus points look pretty solid. Whats the matter?</br>    <br> recap episode <br> yfw they only used that week to spend time on a new series instead of the ongoing piece of QUALITY </br></br>  <br>There needs to be a Crystal thread.

The Rebuilds only made it better and easier to follow, deal with it grandpa</br>  <br>This</br>    They ruined Asuka. Shikinami a shit.  The parts that aren't new (1.0-most of 2.0) are just the scenes from the original except with less character exposition and over-the-top action which doesn't fit the tone of Evangelion. <br>The parts that are new are poorly written.</br>  <br> Redesigned Eva 02 horns <br>You realize that's an image of Shikinami, no?</br></br>  <br>Best Eva got sidelined.</br>  <br> pretty much removed everything that made Eva <br>Ha</br></br>  <br> Why would they remake something that's supposed to be good? <br>Money, why else?</br></br>  Never got why people bitched about 2.22.

They were changes, yes. But nothing that couldn't have been spun into a good story. Unfortunately we got 3.0</br>  <br>That's just because she suffers from the same lack of characterization everyone in Rebuild has. Even Kaworu, in spite of his increased screen time, is just a bland gay Christ figure.<br><br>I definitely liked some of the character design changes, especially making her just a little more petite.</br></br></br>  <br>Most everyone agrees that 1.11 and 2.22 were fine, with 2.22 being the best Rebuild, but 3.33 is just complete and utter shit. Only contrarians say that 2.22 is shit. That or they just want to rewatch NGE for the millionth time because they can't accept any change.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jfM<wbr>3WjyCt8s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  There's nothing wrong with the Rebuilds themselves, they're decent movies. People are just way too dumb (like these people , , ) and keep comparing it to THE anime masterpiece NGE, which obviously not a single anime will ever top. I mean, how unfair is that? <br><br>They're also judging these three movies the same way people judged the NGE series before the end (EoE) dropped. Calling Hideaki a hack, flaming Khara (remember Gainax's building vandalization?), ad infinitum. So thanks to this dumb and predictable behavior there's a chance they'll shut their mouth once 4.44 releases, and you know, the whole deal gets finished and you can judge it as you judge NGE + EoE.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you. 3.33 was the best and that's the end of it. <br><br><br> imo </br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka is a horrible character to begin with.</br>  <br><br> reddit: the discussion </br></br>  <br> hating best girl </br>  <br> Asucka <br> Best </br></br>  Rebuild Asuka &gt; Original Asuka<br>Rebuild Rei &gt; Original Rei<br><br>Shinji is still the same bitch as always.

For me, Misato's unbelievable portrayal and the unexplained 'Curse of Eva' ruined it a lot for me.</br></br>    <br><br>Freckles?

So, yeah.</br></br>  <br><br>That's my point, I really hope whatever I'm looking at there isn't in the final film. It really does remind me of this post  in that is seems like what Eva was originally attempting NOT to be.</br></br>  <br><br>All of the other movies were shit, so why would this one be any different?</br></br>  <br>Anno watches MadMax, Eva 4.0 becomes a copy of MadMax with Evas.</br>  <br>I came into this thread to see if I could add anything, but it was pretty much /thread on the first reply.</br>  <br><br>But Mad Max just came out, so he couldn't have seen it before starting on the movies, Anon.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean like how Kojima wouldn't stop talking about Mad Max, and suddenly there's a chick in Metal Gear Solid V who looks just like Furiosa?</br></br>  <br> Eva 4.0 becomes a copy of MadMax with Evas. <br> Eva 4.0 <br><br>Do you really think Anno is working in Eva fucking 4.0?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Something like that but taking the plot<br> Shinji, Asuka, Mari and Rei get into a rebuilt eva made from parts from every eva <br> They get into a 2 hour chase scene by the Automatic Evas into the desert of TANG. <br> They somehow reveal everything in 5 minutes and resolve everything since they want to change everything. </br></br></br></br>  Why did people not like 3.33 again?<br><br>I think the new plot direction they went in made sense with the whole rebel group thing, the fact that there was a time skip and nobody aged was dumb though.</br></br>  <br> Asukafag chooses to post a picture of something that would never happen instead of defending his horrible waifu <br><br>That bitch wouldn't be caught dead hugging anyone, much less Rei.</br></br></br>    <br>She just needs a little love, that's all</br>  <br>I'm just hoping that the next episode preview is as bogus as the one in 2.22 that promised us Gendo and Fuyu's donkey adventures.</br>  <br>Most of it was dumb</br>  <br>Character motivations don't make sense or are completely unexplored. The actions of Willie and Misato in particular are extremely perplexing.</br>  <br>That was what made it clear that this is only a cash grab, not daring to piss off the otaku by turning their waifus into Christmas cakes.</br>  <br>Fucking otaku, where's my cake Asuka? A 14 year old with a handful of wrinkles doesn't cut it for me.</br>  <br>Man the 3.33 preview was hype, too bad what happened with it in the end</br>  <br>The one at the end of 2 or later ones after they redid everything</br>  <br>Te one from the end of 2.22, clearly, or I wouldn't have mentioned how it was too bad what happened in the end</br>  <br> pretty fight scenes, mediocre CG and shallow plotlines <br>But that's what EVA always was.</br></br>  Autists get mad because they don't understand or don't like that rebuild is meant to be fanservice. Literally, the entire premise is, "what would happen if everybody was slightly less fucked up?" with a few other changes to the setting. It's not meant to be a character study, they've already been picked apart to fuck and back, so what's the point? It's supposed to be something you can sit back and enjoy.<br><br>Also, 3.0 is extremely underrated. It's clear that Anno was trying to recapture some of the more quiet parts of Evangelion, but instead everybody got pissy because "WHY TIMESKIP EVA'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME PIECE EVENTS TOGETHER" and "WHYS EVERYONE SO MEAN TO SHINJI AFTER HE ACCIDENTALLY RUINED THEIR LIVES". It did have one annoying plot hole, but that's really not enough to justify the hate.<br><br>tl;dr anybody who truly appreciates Evangelion enjoys rebuild for what it is and understands what it's trying to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if it was trying to be fanservice, 3.0 was a shitty fart all over that</br>  <br>For me, it's new Asuka. They threw out most of her issues and pride in favor for becoming nowaday tsundere with more emphasis on dere side.</br>    <br>it's like poetry, it's sort of, they rhyme</br>  <br>No, it just wasn't fanservice that was meant for you. Fujoshi loved 3.0. You had your fanservice in 2.0.</br>  <br>Came to post this.</br>  <br>What if 3.0+1.0 isn't really FINAL, and instead is an insert showing the timeskip? Would that satisfy the camp who are mad that 3.0 wasn't what was initially advertised?</br>  <br> avor of pretty fight scenes, mediocre CG and shallow plotlines <br>So just like old EVA?</br></br>  I wonder what the average age of a Rebuild fan is.    The only reason people hate 3.33 is because it was Kaworu and not their waifu getting the focus.  <br>Even 1.11 wasn't any good<br> Here's your fucking condensed as fuck Eva shit with all the subtle and interesting bits cut out now with super-bloom 3DCG </br></br>  I liked everything about 3.33 aside from the pants-on-head retarded Wille airship and their inexplicable refusal to explain basic shit to Shinji even though it could have saved them from his defecting to Gendo.   TFW Anno goes full George Lucas and declares Rebuild the only canon story he intended to tell all along   <br> Reifag posts a gif of his doll acting completely out of character  <br>Oh the ironing.</br></br>  <br> le shit taste man <br>Everytime</br></br>  what is the purpose of mari other than taking asukas place as worst girl  <br>A deconstruction of character development.</br>  <br>yurilust</br>  <br> Asuka ever being worst girl <br><br>Not even if she was the only girl</br></br></br>  Not enough character development. Eyepatch Asuka should have gotten more screen time.  <br>Fanfiction, dubs, and AMVs are classic neo-/a/ though. If that was true the reactions would be more positive.</br>  <br>She lets your shit taste be known through your post on an anonymous imageboard.</br>  <br>A lot of people hate 3.33 because it's confusing on its own, deviates from the teaser at the end of 2.22 (which probably still happened, just with Eva 08 swapped to Eva 13), and will need Final to provide some important context.<br><br>You can figure out quite a few things just based on context clues in the background, but it is fucking impossible to establish an order of events for this mess and the Red Dead Evas littering the landscape without knowing what Unit 01 was doing and how reliable Kaworu is as a narrator</br></br></br>  <br>It's a a rough model build with the Mark 06s thrown in possibly as placeholders. The Unit 05 render from the 2.0 preview and the Unit 02 from the first space preview were both the same way</br>  <br>I was really hoping for adult Asuka and Mari</br>  <br>I'd be okay with that if it gave us a better sense of what 3.0 is building toward. It needs a flashback of some kind, but I don't think it necessarily needs a whole movie. They could do a half hour/forty minute OVA like Episode 21 of NGE and that would be enough</br>  The fact that so many books still name Neon Genesis Evangelion "the greatest or most significant or most influential" anime ever only tells you how far anime still is from becoming a serious art. Anime critics are still blinded by commercial success: Evangelion sold more than anything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Anime critics are often totally ignorant of anime of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Evangelion did anything worth of being saved.  <br>They were. That's what this whole scene in the interrogation room is about. They're telling him about the time jump, why they won't let him pilot, why he's wearing the DSS choker (because Unit 01 woke up in space), and the lack of Rei.<br><br>If ReiQ didn't have either the world's worst timing or some kind of psychic evaesdropping power, that could have been avoided</br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild needs more Asuka.</br>  Are we at the lewd part of this thread yet?  <br>Asuka is cute as fuck in uniform</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Mantou .35 by Chuuka Mantou.

Everything that could have been said already was said by EoE. I guess I know it because of money but it feels odd that the same man who made EoE made the rebuilds. Anno could have just made Shinji become a hero in EoE and people would have loved it and he could have milked the cash cow immediately.  <br>When they made EoE, Anno was massively depressed. Now he's rich, happily married, and wanting to finance his own  retirement .</br>  <br>It seems that he would at least respect his own creations and the pain that lead to them.</br>  <br>Shall I dump my Asuka in uniform pictures?</br>  <br>If you would please</br>  <br>Maybe "dump" isn't the right word, I don't have THAT many of them.</br>  <br>Understood. There's going to be some cake Asuka in here, if you're into that</br>      I think OP started anime waching recently  <br> 2.22 and onward pretty much removed everything that made Eva good <br><br>No, the violins and cello were still in there.</br></br></br>  <br>Sieg Zeon!</br>      <br><br>man, it really says something about rebuild that fans haven't updated their derogatory terms for the female character - you'd think there'd be terms like "Asukuck" or "rei-j-against-the-manwich" or something but no, still just "asucka" and "shinji's a bitch".</br></br>   mfw when someone says 3.0 was the worst Rebuild so far   The conflicts that drive the entire third film wouldn't have happened if any characters had told Shinji what was going on. Any of them. Even five minutes' worth of conversation, boom, no movie.<br><br>Instead we've got Ebert's Idiot Plot:<br><br> Any plot containing problems that would be solved instantly if all of the characters were not idiots. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They were trying. He refused to listen because his waifu couldn't be dead, and then Rei Black Version showed up</br></br>  <br><br>They didn't seem to be trying all that hard.</br></br>  <br>The captain and vice captain preparing and personally delivering a detailed report on the shit that's happened instead of having one of their cronies like Sakura do it isn't trying very hard? Plus including detailed diagnostics of the ship, the Eva, and security footage to back them up?<br><br>That's a hell of a lot more than Kaworu and Fuyutsuki did</br></br></br>  <br> 1.0 <br>Because too much like the TV show.<br> 2.0 <br>Because not enough Asuka and too genki.<br> 3.0 <br>Because Anno doesn't give a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>to be fair they did what you do when you rescue a pilot that has been shot down and been on the ground longer than a day. <br><br>they find you, draw down on you guns drawn, black bag you, get you to an area that they can observe you for a period of time, get your story reported then you get your debriefing. <br><br>they are literally doing things by the book with Shinji plus there is the whole he could be an angel thing so yeah cool on the way they handled that one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What, is that seriously SOP for any military organization? Rescue a shot down pilot with guns drawn and take him to a black site?</br></br>  <br>This whole post reads as superficial shit &gt; substantial stuff</br>  <br>yep because you have no idea what has happened to him. he could have flipped sides. it could be a enemy fighter dressed as the pilot. it could be that enemy caught him and forced a bomb or tracking device in him. all those things have happened.<br><br>that is why every soldier in the US army before they go to a combat zone has all identifying marks listed (tattoos,birth marks, scars) and are give a sheet of questions like the password recover ones encase they have to recuse you from the woods.<br><br>they find you, you put your weapon down and they black bag you and ask the questions. fuck this up and bang bang</br></br></br></br></br>  Because of 3.33 mostly.<br><br>1.11 and 2.22 were nice.</br></br>  <br> They were trying <br>They were only trying to shove guns down his throat and appear like untrustworthy douchebags.<br><br>When they finally let slip that Rei "is dead", they say "she's gone" in the middle of a heated situation where Rei or Rei's EVA sort of is standing right in front of them at the time.<br><br>When it comes to writing, killing off Rei off screen was a shitty move as far as storytelling goes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not enough Shikinami  <br> Never got why people bitched about 2.22 <br>Those "people" are called Asuka fans.<br><br>I've never seen a valid, working complaint from them that wasn't a clear lie that paints it as bad. It goes to show that Asuka fans who complained about 2.22 don't have any grasp on what makes good characters or stories, much less what made the original good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tl;dr anybody who truly appreciates Evangelion hates rebuild for what it is and understands what it's trying to do. <br><br>Fixed that for you. There's nothing here to piece together, the unsubstantial nonsense Rebuild (as in 3.33) presents isn't on it's own good enough.<br><br>When you piece it together, all you get is a sub-par story and raped characters, and those who escape that are pure fanservice like Asuka or Kaworu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too much Shittynami</br>  <br>Not enough Tittynami.</br>    <br><br>jesus christ that art tho</br></br>  <br>in a good way or a bad way</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't decide. I mean she's sexy as fuck and theoretically that spread should look gorgeous but I can't imagine how uncomfortable her vag must feel compressed and then stretched open under such tight material</br></br>  <br><br>Clesta's Asuka is 10/10<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/389151/142d45<wbr>a697/<br><br><br>Good, obviously</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  The Curse of Eva  <br>Best ass in anime history.</br>  <br> decensorship <br><br>I can't fap to this.</br></br></br>  <br>SOme people have a hard time accepting change, be it for the best, the worse, or just different.</br>  Did they ever explain the no-aging thing with the pilots? All I can remember is some throwaway line about "the curse of EVA" or something  It's like this. The original evangelion is a awesome cake like a chocolate cake. The ingredients are in perfect balance and every piece is delicious. So when they decided to make this cake the second time, they just doubled the amounts of sugar and chocolate. Because that's the bestest ingredients right? The result is a sickeningly sweet cake that falls apart with the gentlest of pokes.  <br>the first cake had a bit too much sugar tbh</br>  <br><br>actually, original eva is like eating an amazing cake, but then when you get to the last few bites, it's stale and has mold growing off of it</br></br>  <br>No. Everybody's just kind of guessing it's Angel contamination because of the glowing and elder sigils getting put on them.</br>  Why did none of you put actually best girl  <br>Asuka says "it's the Curse of Eva" and that's it. Ritsuko warns all three they risk their humanity by going too deep into the Evas, so my guess is that they were "modified" by the experience and have something akin to the Fruit of Life.</br>    <br><br>Now when I inquired about those films someone said they messed up Rei's personality and had some other odd stuff going on.</br></br>  <br> Misato in a turtleneck and leather pants <br>Don't mind if I do</br></br>  <br><br><br>all me</br></br></br>   people arguing rei vs asuka <br>why not both?</br>    <br>Here you go, then.</br>  <br>She went full retard in 3.0 though</br>  <br>Is this really meant to be a 43 year old woman? She hasn't aged at all either except for developing resting bitchface.</br>  <br><br>3.33 was truly a gift to Saigado.</br></br>  I like the rebuilds<br><br>They lack the intense psychological drama of the original, but they retain nearly everything else. <br><br>I'm also a sucker for time stuff. It's obvious that the original Evangelion was cycle 1, 2.0 is cycle 2, 3.0 is cycle 3, etc. I like seeing how each cycle has changed and inferring what caused it or what happened before/after that iteration</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone post the Japanese woman aging picture.</br>  <br>Ritsuko and Maya didn't change much either.</br>  <br><br>To be honest I knew who Rei was before Asuka so.</br></br>  <br>They did worse than that, they messed the character up completely as if they hated Rei.</br>  <br>Because Rei is the better girl and character.<br><br>But fifteen years of pandering to Asuka fans and around the same time of treading Rei down in the dirt has changed things.</br></br></br>  <br> They lack the intense psychological drama of the original, but they retain nearly everything else. <br>Anon, the intense psychological drama is the only reason anyone cares about Eva in the first place.</br></br>  I love it because it turns everyone into shallow boring homosexuals who do nothing but terrible things  <br><br>I'll admit one of the reasons I wanted to watch Evangelion was for Rei. I heard she had a smile at one point that would make the Grinch cringe. <br><br>The other reason was I remember reading that the Hope Diamond mutated to titanic size and supposedly laid waste to vast swaths of Tokyo with what was described as "perfect geometric symmetry and fury".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I heard a lot of Rei fans bitching about her behavior in 2.22 right after it came out because she was more open and forward with her feelings, like her blushing when Shinji gave her food or saying she felt warm and comfortable around him, or trying to bring him together with Gendo over dinner. They didn't like "Poka Poka Rei."<br><br>The Rei from 3.33 is a different character altogether with none of the original Rei's memories. That Rei is hanging out inside Unit 01 with Yui</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, not really, but you get Rei doing that to Tokyo-3 and the world so it should about add up.<br><br>I think the third movie sold a lot less than people expected given how much exposure it got combined with the extremely good post-cinema advertising setup it had.</br></br></br>  <br> I heard a lot of Rei fans bitching about her behavior in 2.22 right after it came out <br>A few did, and for reasons that had more to do with how it was different from the original, i.e purism.<br><br>It was something most could swallow because there were still two movies left to work with the characters, and being more open and forward with her feelings is more or less new territory ready to be explored.<br><br>Personally I agree that "poka-poka" was cute but a poor choice of words, Anno allegedly wrote that bit of dialogue.<br><br>After 3.33 that's all a waste now much like every other plotline that isn't pure pandering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>20 years later Reifags are still upset as ever, peddling their stories like no one's business.</br>  <br><br>What if the other girls seem scary by comparison ?</br></br>  <br>Why would Reifags be upset?</br>  <br>It looks like the third movie sold the best of the three, bringing in around $50-60 million domestically. I really wonder how peoples' reactions would differ if 2.0 didn't have that misleading Next Time preview at the end.</br>  <br>mix it up. they could be fun too.</br>  <br><br>Now from what I've heard Rei is the least likely to insult you or yell at you for doing something wrong. <br><br>I heard the other two supposedly give Shinji no small amount of problems in that area (well one anyway, not sure who the other one with Asuka in that image even is).</br></br></br></br>  <br>thinkgen about poka</br>  <br>more like SHITanami</br>  <br>  looks like the third movie sold the best of the three, bringing in around $50-60 million domestically. <br>No, it sold less than the second BUT - the cinema was more successful, yeah.<br><br>It's because of the hype from 2.0 - people rushed to cinemas to watch the sequel, and literally filled a street (!) to watch the trailer for 3.0.<br><br>Then they watched it, audience attention halved for the next few weeks, and when they released the BD's and DVD's, it sold less.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I stopped caring about Evangelion a long time ago. I can't be bothered to care about these movies one way or the other.  <br><br>Wasn't she missing an eye in one of those films ?</br></br>  <br> 20 years <br>It's a recent thing, for 20 years Asuka fans are the ones upset.</br></br>  <br><br>because if something isn't the best then it is the worst in these autistic man childrens minds. it was okay, it wasn't the original NGE but it wasn't trying to be.</br></br>  <br>Looks like it's still there, but it glows spooky blue when she's really mad.</br>  <br> audience attention halved for the next few weeks <br>Actually no. It was going strong for months because people were seeing it again and again, sometimes 5 times so they could understand it. That's why it sold so much more than 2.0 in cinemas. Also it sold more in DVDs than 2.0 but less in BDs, but only by a little bit.</br></br>  <br>Something has gone wrong if Rei isn't scary.</br>  remember when EVA Re-Take was better than EoE?  <br>What is it trying to be? It just feels like a less good version of NGE. It has many elements of NGE but nothing is developed, maybe with and final it will feel like a more complete and stand alone series but right now it just feels like eva with more action and substance.</br>  <br>Because it's a soulless cash grab by a once young, passionate director who's become fat and old like George Lucas.</br>  <br>Gonna be pretty hard to top this shit</br>  <br>3.0 was fantastic simply because Anno finally did something new. 1.0 is fine, 2.0 is complete shit and took out way too many story elements and it just simply wasn't Eva at all.</br>  <br>That's Yui, not Rei.</br>  <br> everything was fine til we hit 3 <br>No, so fucking wrong. 3 is when we finally got to see something new. 2.0 is just a far worse version of the middle of the anime that is not Eva at all its just more generic anime shit.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  At least we all agreed 2.0 &gt; EoE right? Right.  <br>It almost feels like it's trying to make up for the lack of big action setpieces at the end of NGE thanks to the budget running out, so you have NGE where the action starts to taper off but the character development and focus shoots way up, and NTE where the action is really ramped up but the character development isn't as pronounced.</br>  <br>Nope, script in the BD says it's Rei-shaped. God knows why Gendo calls it Yui</br>  <br><br>For some odd reason Rei doesn't seem all that intimidating.</br></br>  <br>Ya, but EoE gave us the action set piece that everyone wanted and through it in our faces. Witch is why I found it odd that same bastard who would make a film like EoE would do a 180 and make the rebuilds. I mean even if Anno wants to get some meta message about leaving eva behind, or looking to favorably on it, that message was already kinda there in EoE.</br>  Because Asuka got replaced by Rei.<br>Only the Japanese liked that.</br>  <br>I do enjoy it more, but EoE is such an intense mindfuck it's not a movie I enjoy watching very often</br>  <br> Actually no. It was going strong for months because people were seeing it again and again, sometimes 5 times so they could understand it. <br><br>While that's true for a part of the audience, the audience 2.0 had gathered and hyped to see 3.0, did actually halve for the next few weeks.<br>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies<wbr>/?page=intl&amp;country=JP&amp;id=evangelio<wbr>n3.htm<br><br>Looking at the first few weeks, it halves by 50% the first week, then ~35% and then 50% again.<br><br> That's why it sold so much more than 2.0 in cinemas. <br>Conclusively wrong, it sold more because of the initial hype. <br><br> Also it sold more in DVDs than 2.0 but less in BDs, but only by a little bit. <br><br>Those numbers are incorrect.<br> 3.33 <br>BD合計383,898枚（2013/07/29付）　DVD合計171,<wbr>126枚 （2013/07/29付） <br><br><br> 2.22 <br>BD 累計455,087枚（2011/09/12付） DVD累計373,820枚（2010年間） <br><br>As you can see, it didn't sell that poorly, but it didn't sell much, much less than one could expected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now from what I've heard Rei is the least likely to insult you or yell at you for doing something wrong.  <br>She'll give notice if necessary, but is very unlikely to insult, or at all say very much.<br><br>She's a good girl.<br><br><br>I prefer EoE a lot, but 2.0 is still the best Rebuild movie. Some might tell you it doesn't say much though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mhZ<wbr>2X9znPxM</wbr>  [ ]  3.0 is literally Rahxephon, an anime that has the outer aesthetics of Eva but none of the inner intricacies. I always laugh at retards who spout stupid shit like "3.0 is going back to Eva's roots" when it's a perfect example of Anno forgetting what made the original special.  <br>Source on these numbers?<br>I remember reading that 3.0's DVD numbers were the highest of the Rebuilds.</br></br>  <br>No doubt shoveled down your throat by a dumb 3.33 fan.</br>  <br><br>And while I'm on the subject of that is there any one of them that didn't take an eye injury ? <br><br>I remember Rei having bandages on one of her eyes at one point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I read it on a Japanese site 2 years ago. I have no reason to believe it to be wrong. Can you show me the sources for those numbers you just pulled?</br>  <br>Not that guy, but you're the one who's wrong here.<br><br>We get to see something new in 1.11, but very, very little. 2.22 is the movie where we actually get to see something new, including a new character and the characters we know developing differently and - competently enough to be believable. Add the EVA's/Angels and new background movements, and this is new.<br><br>As far as plot structure goes, 2.22 contains a similar work-up but gives the characters and story different conclusions. This is genuinely new here.<br><br>When we consider 3.33, we don't find it's new beyond new designs and background characters. The plot structure appears to be a copy of the original plot of 23/24, and proceeds/ends in the same way. It's less new, unless you count having drastically downsized characters (except Kaworu) and no working story "new".<br><br>There's no value in what you could consider "new" in 3.33, except as fanservice. It doesn't set up anything competently or even build anything within itself.<br><br><br>That's an insult to RahXephon. It has it's own inner intricacies, far more than 3.33 ever had. Also yeah those idiots are well, idiots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Rei is the better girl and character. </br>  Who /beastmode/ here?  Is Anno a Westaboo?  <br>Whatever fan site you read it at has to be misleading you, or you're lying.</br>  <br>I sure do.</br>    <br>Rebuild isn't a remake, it's a sequel.</br>  <br><br>in what manner?</br></br>  <br>http://hayabusa6.2ch.net/test/read.<wbr>cgi/eva/1374965149<br><br>Here you go, further sources are also linked there if you're curious.<br><br>I don't really understand how you could have thought 3.0 pulled big numbers than 2.0 as far as home media sales go. People didn't really like 3.33 except some hardcore otaku fans, and they don't have taste or numbers.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I doubt it was a fansite and I see no reason why it would make up numbers.<br>Now could you pull up those sources for those numbers? I'm getting tired of asking you for the umpteenth time. It's okay if it's from a Japanese site, I can read moon.</br></br>  <br>That is a troll image. 0/10.<br><br><br>It's a remake because it can only be considered a retcon, it's a retcon-sequel.<br>Reboot perhaps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu remembering the events of the original series. It's a time loop, but only Kaworu remembers, he's trying to make sure Shinji gets a happy end.</br>  <br>Any site I google or any fansite I've read gives me the same result, I didn't post the numbers in the first place but I have seen matching numbers everywhere else.<br><br>My conclusion? You're full of shit. How about YOU show the numbers ?<br><br> I see no reason why it would make up numbers. <br>Now why would someone defending 3.0 lie about the numbers? Gee I wonder fucking why.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's so fucking shitty. How can anyone write this and not come half-way to puking? It's like fanfiction.net came alive and decided to rape Evangelion.</br>  <br>How is it a troll image? It clearly lays out the truth of the entire rebuild series so far, its connects all the dots.</br>  <br>-1/10</br>  <br>To be fair Kaworu was a canon timelooper since late 90s SRW. It's nothing new or surprising for the Japanese fanbase.</br>  <br>To be fair you're either insane or just dumb, possibly both, since you put the words "canon" and "srw" together.<br>To just have the boldness to imply whatever nonsense you said was "fair" should make anyone who reads it sick.</br></br>  <br> he can't even come up with a reason why its irrelevant instead just posts ebin troll ratings xD </br>  <br>evangelion as a whole is shit prove me wrong</br>  <br> troll image <br><br>Gonna need a citation on that, anon</br></br></br>  <br><br>welp looks like I was right, you really were full of shit: <br><br>3.0 defense force man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to be aware of how seriously nips take SRW. All I'm saying is no one should be surprised Kaworu is a timelooper. He's one in pretty much every external material that has come out after EoE. Much to Anno's pleasure.</br>  <br>Says the Reifag.</br>  <br>Don't even try it.<br><br>Your willingness to eat up Kaworu as a "timelooper" doesn't mean everyone else eats it up. Point being, it ain't canon to EoE or NGE. NGE doesn't deal with timelooping.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127695911 <br> I get the feeling Eva Mark 6, the 12th Angel, and Lilith's old corpse were part of a sacrificial rite to resurrect Lilith using Evangelion 13 as a vessel. That would explain why it's so different from the others. <br><br>I get a feeling that's pretty fucking redundant since all it takes is you know, getting Rei in there.<br><br>You want the actual truth tho? There isn't any working plot structure or mechanic at play here, things happen and they say whatever they want without thinking what it means. Already confirmed by the writers themselves.<br>Now stop being fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both Rebuild and the manga are clearly loops, stop being in denial.</br>  <br> Rebuild  <br>Clearly not NGE or EoE here. Those were out the nineties.<br><br> Manga <br>Again, clearly not NGE or EoE here, and it only forced in looping in it's latest chapter.<br><br>You quit being in fucking denial.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I 'eat it up' because it's been a thing for almost 20 years now. Get over it. Anno says Eva is a multimedia franchise and wants us to think of it as such.</br>  <br>You eat it up because you're a filthy Kaworufag. No other reason.</br>  <br> NGE doesn't deal with timelooping. <br>It deals with the concept of there being multiple world as a result of different actions and decisions. Alternative universes all connected to eachother has always been a thing in Eva, and is reiterated in all external materials. Rebuild is most likely one of those worlds.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off. Everyone in Japan eats it up and accepts it, whether they like Kaworu or not. The thing that you claim to like is not Eva, it's an idealized portion of Eva that doesn't exist in reality.</br>  <br>Fanwank, and wrong, the original does not deal with that. <br><br>No, saying that "if you act like this or that, you'll feel better" is not dealing with the concept of alternate worlds or timelines.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was about hope (there's no reason why you must be a NEET) rather than time loops</br>  <br> Fanwank, and wrong, the original does not deal with that.  <br>Yes it does. Episode 26 directly states it and even shows us one of the alternative universes with genki Rei and childhood friend Asuka.</br></br>  <br>I don't even like Kaworu, but you're being too stubborn here. This is widely accepted.</br>  <br>Again, you're a Kaworufag acting like a vulture coming down once it suits you.<br><br>The thing I claim to like is called NGE, it exists and can even be bought in stores or downloaded. What you like is the fictional idealized (as in a subverted ideal) bullshit, considered it is literally based on stringing together fanwank on substanceless fanservice in various EVA franchises that isn't the original.</br></br></br>  <br> Yes it does. <br>Episode 26 is this: <br> No, saying that "if you act like this or that, you'll feel better" <br><br>The alternate genki childhood friend scenario is just that, a presented scenario used to illustrate the point that thinking and acting differently leads to a more positive situation. This is what the scenes are literally explained as.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm just not a retarded purist that ignores Anno's intentions to make Eva a multiverse franchise. My only statement was that Kaworu being a timelooper in REBUILD should not be surprising, nothing about NGE. Remember that Anno wants to destroy NGE as well. His words, not mine.</br>  <br>see </br>  it had a good thing going but shit the fucking bed with the latest installment<br>in retrospect the cracks were already appearing in 2.0</br>  <br>Shinji says this is just another possible world among many. For you to deny this exact statement is full on retarded. It's the inclusion of multiple alternative universes, which is why this very fact is capitalized on in external materials like the spinoffs, Manga, SRW, and Rebuild. Anno himself says this is what he wants, which should be expected considering his Devilman boner.</br>  We had tons of these threads since the first film and even more after Q. Is this the new "what the fuck did I just watch"? Do we really need to have the same tired talk about the Rebuilds? I's already one of the main topics onany eva threadalo with waifuwars, and kaworuposting.  <br> No, I'm just not a retarded purist <br>All right, you lose. What you fantasize in your head doesn't change the original. Whatever Anno creates tomorrow doesn't change anything he did yesterday.</br></br>  Always wondered is there any reason for a plug suit to have a Helmet ?  <br>And if you actually read my posts like a rational adult, you'd realize I never mention NGE. It's after NGE that the Kaworu timeloop thing comes into play, and I merely explain that fact to you and why you should not be surprised it is included in Rebuild.<br>Also, <br> Anno:Eva had one timeline, but what if it had multiple timelines like Gundam? We’ve thought about that before, during planning of the original Eva. It’s totally fine! After all, [Character Designer Sadamoto] is writing his own manga under the Eva title. <br>In other words, get over it. The NGE you loved is in the past, Anno is consistently trying to get rid of it and retcon it into something new. Whether this is good or bad is up to the individual fan; but you can't deny that it's what is happening. Find another franchise to sperg over if you can't deal with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shinji says this is just another possible world among many. <br>No, he says it's one of the versions of "him" that's - keyword - inside him. Not worlds, but "me's".<br><br>Then the rest of the episodes goes on to explain that it's about how you see things, perception - it follows up with an idea about how you're told to see things versus what they actually are.<br><br>It's actually really fucking simple, and either someone lied to you or you are cynically lying about the original to further your fanwank agenda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Whether this is good or bad is up to the individual fan <br>It's bad. Individual fans (such as you) defend it for reasons that are ultimately petty and destructive to the entire franchise, not being able to see what it'll do.</br></br>  <br>It's not about worlds, it's about variants of himself that are possible IF he changes his mind about how to act and feel. About learning to love himself and to not be a debbie downer when he doesn't have to be.<br><br>The whole fucking message of Evangelion right there, and you ignore it at the drop of the hat because it makes for better gay love homo stories. It should be allowed to hunt people like you.</br></br></br>  <br>The episode makes it clear that it is one possible world among many. No amount of fanwank will erase this fact. The concept of multiple worlds, one without Eva included, are all connected and there. You can't erase this truth.<br><br><br> It's bad <br>Again, your opinion. The majority of the Japanese fanbase on the other hand accept and love it. And they are the only ones who matter here.<br> defend it <br>I never defend it, I merely state it because it's the truth. Rather than be delusional like you and pretend it doesn't exist. It's there, get over it or leave for another franchise. It's that simple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only 3.33.</br>  <br> The episode makes it clear that it is one possible world among many. <br>No where does it do that; it directly refers to it as an illustration of a thought experiment that leads into changing Shinji's mind.<br><br>The only one fanwanking here is you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's about variants of himself that are possible IF he changes his mind about how to act and feel <br>How is this any different from what I say here? <br>They are alternate universes like the one we see in episode 26. End of discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not an opinion, and according to ratings 3.0 which is deeper into looping i's the least liked Evangelion movie FYI. Also sold less issues than the previous one from what I've seen ITT.<br><br>The integrity of the story goes into the drain and it's never going to present something that uses it's full potential for the sake of pleasing small portions of the fanbase that are the equivalent of nomads, bandwagoning pandering to pandering. It's stagnating.<br><br>Not good regardless of opinion. You can like something bad, and that's what you're defending and doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This really is the best explanation for it. People saying it's a return to Eva are simply blind fanboys and fujoshi.</br>  <br> How is this any different from what I say here? <br>Because the original episode has nothing to do with different worlds or alternate realities, only asserting what the final message builds up to: try to change yourself, try to love yourself and you'll lead a different life than the one you think you'll have or is having.<br><br>These are not alternate universes in the slightest, nothing of it is ever mentioned in ALL of Evangelion.<br><br>Now stop being autistic, they say this straight in the episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've got it. This is also a world. <br> A possiblity of me. <br> The me at the moment is not always the me as I am. <br> There are many myselves. <br> Yes. There must be the me who is not the Eva pilot. <br>This alternative world is shown as one of many possibilities, and that fact is reiterated by Misato to let Shinji know that the real world is not so bad. Stop denying what is directly shown and said in the episode to fuel your fantasies.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br>There's no talk about alternate worlds existing, much less simultaneously or successively.<br><br>When the original retard anon said that "it deals with alternate universes", that's a lot of meaning and shit to prove, like how does it discuss the existence of these universes, how does it affect the plot, how does it fit in anywhere and how does it work?<br><br>Of course, NGE or EoE does literally zero of that. It uses an alternate scenario (it is described as such), presented through mindscape like much of Evangelion has been in that episode, and the following description naturally follows up by using it to illustrate ways of thinking, not ways of fucking existing.<br><br>Stop being a fucking dumbass and stop pretending you watched Evangelion for anything but the gay rumours on tumblr.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence, the real world, in an alternate world scenario they're all equally real. Moreover it's mentioned as a possibility in HIM, not in existence, which is what the following dialogue that explains it all is all about.<br><br>Now the dialogue previous to this segment, unsurprisingly, deals with the exact same thing. How Shinji sees things, even how others shape him.<br><br>What you have in episode 26 is an illustrated thought experiment, not a literal different world, which it is explained as both prior to and after.<br><br>There is no plot mechanic, nothing that all deals with alternate worlds either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which is deeper into looping <br>You what? 1.0's beginning and ending is more pro-looping than the other two. Also Kaworu's words in 2.0 hint much more than anything in 3.0. Furthermore, they love it because SRW sells like hotpockets and every Eva spin-off contains elements of it.<br> It's not an opinion <br>It is. It's not an objective truth, it's a subjective opinion based on your own idea of what is bad for a franchise. The rest of the world is not you, stop pretending people are incapable of different opinions and realms of thought.<br><br><br> These are not alternate universes in the slightest <br>They are because no matter how much Shinji tries to change himself and love himself, the world won't suddenly change into a fluffy romcom with normal girl genki Rei and childhood friend Asuka who's not even German. It's an alternative reality used as an example for Shinji's eventual epiphany to learn that you are not bound by the world as long as you love and care for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This alternative world is shown as one of many possibilities <br>Your mother must have dropped you or something. Possibilities of imagined Shinji's within - SHINJI. The whole point ep 26 makes out to you that it's a matter of perspective, not a matter of alternate universes and shit. The whole point is to show Shinji (and you) that by thinking differently, learning to love yourself and whatnot, you can see a more optimistic future.</br></br>  <br> You what? 1.0's beginning and ending is more pro-looping than the other two. <br> Also Kaworu's words in 2.0 hint much more than anything in 3.0. <br><br>Kaworu going on about reocurring loops in literal form except implied visual references as in the first (red sea etc) is far more direct and forward than anything else. Moreover the visual references to EoE also count for 3.0, which makes you wrong.<br><br> It is. It's not an objective truth <br>It's an objective truth because we can look objectively at the consequences of doing so. See previous post for an explanation of those consequences.<br>You just don't like it being as bad as it is because you're one of the aforementioned shallow fans, and that makes you look bad. Something this very denial you're showing is also exacerbating.<br><br>Stop pretending that you're right or objective in any capacity whatsoever, just come out to say you're defending a shallow portion of Evangelion's fanbase that is most likely about shipping and bullcrap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> They are because no matter how much Shinji tries to change himself and love himself, the world won't suddenly change into a fluffy romcom with normal girl genki Rei and childhood friend Asuka who's not even German. <br>This world is not a possiblity within himself, that makes no sense. Characters are literally changed into other things completely different, as is the universe around them. It's an alternate possibility, another world.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They are because no matter how much Shinji tries to change himself and love himself, the world won't suddenly change into a fluffy romcom with normal girl genki Rei and childhood friend Asuka who's not even German. <br><br>This is why it's an example. It's not an actual, alternate reality. It's purely an illustration of the concept in question like everything in the episode has been so far.<br>It's an illustration to showcase an example, not an actual real world. <br><br>Listen to what they say for gods sake instead of being a brainless moron and injecting your shitty fanwank into it. It's possibilities within him as produced by his mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This world is not a possiblity within himself, that makes no sense. <br>Tell that to Evangelion then. It said it.<br><br> Characters are literally changed into other things completely different, as is the universe around them. <br>They aren't, it's a visual example. Shinji changes into a fish, a burning cross, all sorts of weird things, it's not real. It's not surreal, it's visualized illustrations of something that doesn't happen in real life, as in Shinji's real world and life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaworu going on about reocurring loops in literal form <br>He only does this in 1.0 and 2.0<br> Moreover the visual references to EoE  <br>1.0's beginning and 2.0. They are more pro-looping than 3.0 by far.<br> we can look objectively at the consequences of doing so <br>And those consequences are perceived differently by different people. It's subjective.<br> You just don't like it being as bad as it is  <br>Except I never once defending it. Just stated it like it is, unlike you who deliberately likes to pretend it doesn't exist. It's where the franchise is going, whether we like it or not. We have no control over that fact.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> It's not an actual, alternate reality <br>By definition that's exactly what it is. Just like the live-action alternate reality in EoE. The concept is present in both, and is then continued in the other works of the franchise.</br></br></br>  <br>It makes all the sense because it's not actually fucking happening. You Kaworufags are the most dumb people that show up in these threads and that's including autistic Asukfags rampaging the threads with butthurt.<br><br>The world or the characters aren't changing, it's a representation of the concept at hand. The build up scene describes the Shinji character and the world being set up, as the visuals illustrate it, first nothingness, then a line on the floor, then Shinji, then many other things that finally end up in that scene.<br><br>It's not an event or world that actually exists. That's why NGE calls it a possibility within Shinji, and if you can't deal with that then you can't deal with Evangelion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By definition that's exactly what it is.  <br>Which definition? No definition.<br><br>The concept is not present in the original or NGE. The concept of visually illustrating something using non-real events, surreal or faux real, is. It's the main tool for the last episode.<br><br>You didn't get Evangelion and used it as your personal jerk of fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He only does this in 1.0 and 2.0 <br>No, he doesn't because in 1.0 he only makes indirect references at best; something which is ambiguous and could mean anything.<br><br>In 3.0 he talks about recurring events directly, and the idea of impacts and so on are laid up to directly support loops. Therefore, you're wrong.<br><br> 1.0's beginning and 2.0. They are more pro-looping than 3.0 by far. <br>This isn't even a coherent argument.<br><br>3.0 has the same visual references as used in NGE, this being the invasion of NERV headquarters. <br><br> Just stated it like it is <br>Considering the above, even if you pretend to not defend it, then you didn't even do that.<br><br>It's where the franchise is going, but the fact is that it is not compatible with the original. You being accepting of any new direction equates directly to defending it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, in situations like the Magma Diver episode it would make a lot of sense to have a helmet, and a fully armored version of the plugsuit as a contingency. A fully pressurized suit wouldn't be a necessity, since the entry plug itself is a self-pressurized contained environment, but the more layers of protection between your pilot and a hostile environment, the better.</br>  <br>It's not an alternate reality if it isn't actual reality. It's more like virtual reality or imagined reality, in other words: fantasy.<br><br>This is what episode 26 does, if you recall it right it's doing this for scenes before the rom-com segment starts, some crudely and some situational placing people in scenes. <br><br>By definition, it's not what it is in the slightest. Also don't escape the fact that NGE or EoE doesn't in any capacity whatsoever discuss or use the idea of recurring events, loops or alternate realities in it's story or plot. There is one single scene there which you have grossly misinterpreted despite character explaining what it is beforehand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do people hate the Evangelion Rebuild? <br><br>Short, short version: It's just fanfiction. Ultra high budget, officially released fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br> That's why NGE calls it a possibility within Shinji <br>It says it is a possible Shinji, not something exists in him. To say it would be a possibility Shinji within him would imply that Shinji can actively make Rei genki Asuka his childhood friend and the existence of Eva completely disappear. Which is wrong. It's an alternate possible reality that could occur or not. That's it. Just like EoE's.<br> It's the main tool for the last episode. <br>Just because it's used as a tool doesn't mean that it's existence as a concept is invalidated. They say it is another world, a possibility. That is what an alternative reality is. Just like the alternative world in EoE. It's a concept present in the original and continues on in Eva as a franchise. Knowing Anno's boner for Devilman it's hardly surprising in the slightest.<br><br><br> he only makes indirect references at best <br>Multiple coffins and Kaworu already knowing who Shinji is is more direct than anything in 3.0. Kaworu saying he'll make Shinji happy THIS time is more pro-looping than anything he says in 3.0.<br> 3.0 has the same visual references as used in NGE <br>1.0 beginning with the splash of the EoE ocean is more telling than a mere homage to another scene in 3.0.<br> then you didn't even do that <br>Then show me where I defending it.<br> You being accepting of any new direction equates directly to defending it. <br>Show me where I was being accepting. Stating a truth != Defending it. Rather you're just mad because I brought up something that you don't like and choose to ignore. You're stuck in the past which is exactly what Anno hates about you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It says it is a possible Shinji, not something exists in him.  <br>It says it's something that exists in him. <br><br> To say it would be a possibility Shinji within him would imply that Shinji can actively make Rei genki Asuka his childhood friend <br>No, it would say exactly what the previous and following dialogue says: THAT HE CAN LEARN TO LOVE HIMSELF. <br><br>You are not paying attention, or you're so autistic you can't even interpret simple sentences right.<br><br> Just because it's used as a tool doesn't mean that it's existence as a concept is invalidated. <br>Yes, this is exactly what it means. The existence of it as a concept never fucking existed in the first place. You're forcing your own disgusting fanfiction onto the original where it doesn't fit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, that wasn't so bad. What they replaced it with just didn't hold my attention. Also the scenes with all the skulls were a bit too melodramatic. Bad pacing over all.</br>    <br>Really guy, you're arguing that Shinji would have to be able to change the world to deny the idea that it's not an actual alternate reality, and then later argue that just the mention of a possibility equates to alternate worlds existing?<br><br>You know what, you need to just get the fuck out. These threads never go along well when there's someone as far up their own ass as you. Every single post you make is filled with bullshit that contradicts the original series directly, and even your own posts.<br><br>Why do you even fucking bother?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those pegging doujins?</br>  <br> Multiple coffins and Kaworu already knowing who Shinji is is more direct than anything in 3.0.  <br>No, because the first is just that, multiple coffins. Any meaning you put into them is your own, it's fanwank.<br>Kaworu already knowing Shinji could have literally any other meaning, including a briefing or previous contact in any form or shape. <br><br>What the above says clearly, is that they aren't direct methods of saying "LOOPS/RECURRING EVENTS".<br><br>You're missing what 3.0 actually said here, where Kaworu goes on to explain that there are rituals and impacts t hat have gone on since time immemorial, directly in Rebuild. This equates directly to discussing recurring events, including loops.<br><br>If he says he's going to make "shinji happy" then that's something I clearly did not refer to or even mention, but you can add that to as an indirect reference. So in this case, you're wrong.<br><br>What you're also leaving out is how it's the least like movie, so yeah.<br><br> Then show me where I defending it. <br>You're doing it now, by acting like it's shenanigans were always there like Oceania says it was always at war with Eurasia.<br><br>You're not stating any truths and that's very obvious by how easy you are to prove wrong. You're delusional or misinformed, which is it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Magma Diver <br><br>When someone told me they built a mech sized diving suit I fell out laughing. <br><br>It was even funnier when I found out it was true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji's ass is the best thing about Rebuild.</br>  <br> It's not an alternate reality if it isn't actual reality <br>How so? We're just arguing semantics and pointless definitions at this point. Regardless of what it is, it stands to be another reality, space, universe, whatever. And that's the concept that is being continued in the Eva franchise.<br> It says it's something that exists in him.  <br>The possible Shinji exists within him, not the world it comes from.<br> The existence of it as a concept never fucking existed in the first place. <br>Except it is introduced in both episode 26 and EoE. No matter what it's used for is irrelevant, it's there and is a thing. A thing that Anno continues to use.<br><br> the mention of a possibility equates to alternate worlds existing? <br>Yes, because why else would they mention it in the first place? There's better ways to show Shinji his world can change if he learns to love himself than show a completely irrelevant world where Eva doesn't exist and characters are completely different. ie, A world that could never happen in this one; no matter what Shinji does.<br> but you can add that to as an indirect reference. <br>In 2.0 he says THIS time I'll make you happy, it's the most indicative of looping than anything stated in 3.0 and the beginning scene of 1.0 as well is more than 3.0.<br> there are rituals and impacts that have gone on since time immemorial <br>Which doesn't really indicate anything. You'd just have to fanwank a meaning out of that. Anything else he says in the movie doesn't indicate anything to the level his words in 1.0 and 2.0 did.<br> You're doing it now, by acting like it's shenanigans were always there <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127663267#p127699168">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know what's awful?

This is a fact.  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>Bring Al's mom back</br>  <br>Absolutely not<br>He was supposed to be an annoying faggot though.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but there's supposed to be a scene where he gets BTFO'd by Saitama. This is the new 'dine and dash.'</br>  <br>No,he's always supposed to be a faggot,only edgy teenagers think otherwise</br>  I need to do more push-ups.  <br>Hello there newfriend. It seems you haven't read the original OPM, if you really think Garou was supposed to be annoying cunt. Go read ONE's version and then come back.<br><br>But seriously, I know Murata is giving Garou more page time, but I hate what he has done to him. In ONE's version Garou was a dangerous threat and an actual enemy with clear motives  that made him somewhat good person actually  but Murata has done nothing but make him a whiny cunt who seems to beat up people just for fun. He also made Garou into a lot more doucebaggish than he actually is.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Exactly in what pages is he more of a whiny cunt who seems to beat up people for fun more than in the original? Or are you just talking about his overall design?</br>  <br>His startup does make him look somewhat whiny cunt, but as the chapters progress he seems to start taking fighting them a lot more seriously  He's already spoiling his plans in Tanktop chapter, which Murata skipped . Pretty soon after that we already get to the monster inc. arc and that's where Garous edginess fliess out of the window.</br>  That's the best Saitama reaction, I can't stop laughing.  <br>Have you read it?<br>He was bitching about being bullied the entire time, almost got killed against Bang, the MA monsters and almost died to one of Saitama's casual punches.<br>How is that any different than what Murata did?<br><br>Are you baiting or just stupid?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Garou stop posting please,in the original you are even more of a faggot.</br>  <br> He was bitching about being bullied the entire time, almost got killed against Bang, the MA monsters and almost died to one of Saitama's casual punches. <br>Well we haven't seen anything else from that except Saitama's casual punch. So pretty hard to say anything about them, but if you would compare Tanktop fight you might see the differences. Not that I except you to, this is 4chan, nobody ever listens to others.</br></br>  <br>I literally have no earthly idea what you're talking about. I just read through the two versions of the fight side by side, and it was like seeing the same game on low and high graphical settings. The dialogue and paneling is almost the exact same, the only real differences were in the fights(and even then it's still the same moves, just more detailed), and Murata added a Garou face to a panel that was just black in the original.</br>  Someone post them sequence gifs, I need them  <br>So what, are you mad that ONE developed his character over the course of the entire arc while Murata hasn't shown the same level of development over about the first 5 minutes of the same arc?</br>  <br>Exactly. Murata has just made Garous starting point a lot shittier, I don't doubt that he'll get better as the manga progresses.</br>  <br>you keep talking as if any story changes only come from murata without talking to ONE about it</br>  <br>Garou's entire development starts with the little kid and the monster association. Wait til we get there before bitching</br>  <br>Gosh, geez, just hate mainstreamfags like Murata</br>  Save his mothe- oh wait wrong thread.

Comic Sans MS is it Not ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spot the Comic Sans</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Boros had a faster paced fight and could withstand way more of Saitama's attacks than Garou in my opinion.</br>  <br><br><br>For the last time<br>Murata does not write this manga. <br>The remake is written by ONE, ONE has stated this in interviews, tweets, and Murata has even shown the fucking storyboards by ONE in his ustream. <br><br>Stop. Blaming. Murata for the story direction. <br>Bitch at him for art all you want, but stop blaming the wrong guy for what he didn't do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Intimidating? Nope. Garou was a fucking Jobber even in the One. it takes a while 'to become threatening,</br>  <br>I do not even understand why there is someone who complains.</br>  <br>Really? I thought he let Murata have his own way with the story for some parts at least. Would have been nice.</br>  <br>Kill Accelerator</br>  <br><br>Plus Saitama had to perform one of his strongest punches so far just to blow him in half. Garou looked like he was about done after the first punch to the face.</br></br>  <br> this retarded  <br>Saitama can beat also Superfaggot. No but seriously, Saitama can easily beat DC and Marvel heroes.</br></br>  <br>Saitama was buried with Lightsp[eed Flash, who made Saitama unlodge his sword+hand one boulder at a time while the S-rankers were busy trying to deal with Golden Sperm. Then Garou smashed Sperm, smashed the heroes, smashed some more heroes, Saitama broke free, Garou smashes more heroes, and then Saitama finally gets his turn.</br>  Now that he's defeated Garou, do the S-Rank heroes respect Saitama? Besides obvious bitches like Tatsumaki<br><br>Also, post yfw  Blast is Saitama from the future. </br></br>  <br>Find love.</br>  <br>???<br>Chp 55 of the One. Same scene. Although Saitama was looking for him on purpose (<br>but then he leaves fro stupid reason).<br>.<br>All that part was ridiculous, the remake is handling the story much better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Grow hair.</br>  <br>Sorry, wrong pic.</br>  <br>Could Saitama punch out of the cage?</br>  <br> remake is handling the story much better <br>murata drones a shit A SHIT</br></br>  <br>Everyone seems to have some weird impression that Murata wants to write things.</br>  <br><br><br>He even finished his sentence with "Everything I said is facts", why pay attention to him?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Probably, I mean, he was defined as limitless, and Doffy is not all-powerful.</br></br>  <br><br> Listen, I am not that guy nor am I a fan of Murata over ONE, but it makes sense that the remake could change things ONE was not satisfied with. Honestly the whole "I will use this chance to dine and dash too" was pretty off putting, this time it was done better.<br><br> No need to be a original drone that says everything original is better, be more impartial.</br></br></br></br>  <br> appealing to a shitposter's sense of decency </br>  Could someone tell me why Murata version is supposed to be worse? Until now it does not seem very different.  <br>Gist touching his shoulder so gently</br>  <br>Shitposters can't waint until the anime comes out.</br>  <br> just having finished the re-drawn version <br> not having known about the original <br>FUCK!</br></br></br>  <br>Murata is as much of a reader as us (well, though ONE already told him the whole plot probablyà. The only things he adds is the action.</br>  <br>You guys don't seems to understand we'll have the dine and dash as well. Why ? Because Garou don't remember the last chapter. ONE is almost shouting at us those fillers weren't important for the story. We never had any thing this "major" changed until now.</br>  <br>Nah man the strongest enemy was Asura Rhino.</br>  <br>He only changed the timing of a scene. Instead of doing it after the introduction of the Monster Association he has done that before.</br>  <br><br> Should I give up and let the world make me into a bitter asshole?<br><br> I am serious, should I? </br></br></br></br>  <br>GAROU DOESN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.<br><br>He should in the dine and dash, that's enough to confirm it's a bonus scene like the rest.</br></br></br>  <br>right</br>  <br>Things don't have to be black and white, bro. Just don't reply to people who only want to start shit.</br>  <br> Asura Rhino <br> Above Boros or Garou <br>Are you retarded? He's probably below Golden Sperm at best.</br></br></br>   opm anime <br>Anyone have seiyuu list?</br>  <br> GAROU DOESN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. <br> caps clock <br><br>Nothing prevents him to remember as soon see Saitama again. And in any case that not so important because between the ko from Saitama, Garou also suffering a semi Ko by his teacher and Bang, and the then a beating by the monsters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here.<br><br>Boros was 'out of this world'. He was able to put up a fight against casual Saitama even if it did require him to regenerate instantly. And he dealt a whole lot more 'damage' to Saitama than other foes have thus far.<br><br>He also forced Saitama to whip out an attack that was observable from space. Earth would've been destroyed if Caped Baldy hadn't thrown back a serious series attack.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's possible Garou will run into Saitama two or three times in total to reinforce that every time he got stronger that it made no difference against Saitama.  <br>At best it would have destroyed a part of it, even with the attack destroyed by the serious punch you can tell it's not that big.</br>  <br>The scale of Boros' battle felt larger than the one which might come with Garou depending how much One alters the polished one. However, I think Saitama winds up using more Serious moves during the fight, which sort of implies it's a harder one.  Not to mention Garou defeats every other S class hero present in order to get to that point, something which didn't happen at all during the Alien invasion. Garou wanted to force everyone to acknowledge he was Disaster Level God by their defeat. </br>  <br>Boros said that he would destroy the surface of the world with his discharge.<br>If that's true we can only speculate.</br></br>  <br>The thing is it could be that the only real threat of the alien invasion, to S heroes, was Boros himself. But we never see him fighting anyone besides Saitama.</br>  <br>Meaning it will have collateral damages compared to his previous attacks.</br>  <br>ONE himself said that Boros and Garou were even. That being said Boros was killed by the shockwave coming off of a serious punch from Saitama, meanwhile Monster form Garou took a serious headbutt and only lost an arm</br>  <br>beating up like half of the S class that were all heavily damaged, especially Tatsumaki who is by far the strongest isn't so much. Golden Sperm could most likely have done that himself at this point.</br>  <br>Saitama comedic logic. He kills monsters. He doesn't kills humans.</br>  <br>The deal with Silver Surfer is that he could vaporize someone with a thought or put a black hole in their brain, but he doesn't because he's not an asshole and was never a fighter before becoming a herald so it's just not in his nature. So technically Silver Surfer could beat Saitama in 1 second but never would.</br>  I kinda like Garou more in the redraw.<br><br>He's gotten more funny and despite his shitty whining I think he's pretty cool.</br></br>  <br> Saitama goes 100% <br> Breaks Vectors, and possibly reality </br></br>  <br>Garou had a better technique. Boros had speed and power. <br><br>But Boros can manage a good duel (for little time, sure) against a Saitama uninterested in spare his life. Saitama destroy him without fuss. For Garou, instead, is also a battle of ideals and Saitama want deliberately making him see what he can do.</br></br></br>  I love this scene. The desperation of Garou when he realizes that he's running out of options.  <br>that body, HNNNG!<br>I've already have unrealistic qualification in men and this just make it more impossible to find</br></br>  <br>Doesnt change the fact that a monster form Garou could tank a point blank serious attack from Saitama. I mean surely you arent the kind to say "THERE WAS NO KILLING INTENT IN THE SHOCKWAVES!"<br><br>wat</br></br></br>  <br> Pretending to be a girl on the internet </br>  <br>I love his lank</br>  <br>When Saitama punches monsters, they die.<br>When Saitama punches humans, they're ko but still barely damaged.<br><br>Is that so hard to understand for you ? He was trying to kill Boros while he just wanted to make understand to Garou that he was stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In all fairness, it could be a guy pretending to be gay too.</br>  <br>Nice to see that Murata's art is appealing to both audiences.</br>  <br>This. What's so hard to understand?</br>  <br> When Saitama punches monsters, they die. <br> When Saitama punches humans, they're ko but still barely damaged <br>This metaphysical bullshit is one of the dumbest things I've read on this board. I bet you unironically save power level charts</br></br></br>  <br> When Saitama punches monsters, they die. then considering what kind of monster they were, he EATS THEM <br><br>fixed that for you. it creeps me out every time he does it and he doesnt do it often</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay to be wrong sometimes.</br>    <br>I personally really like how Murata draws battles fights, and when Saitama throws a punch, you can perceive his power.</br>  Kurisu is stupid, ugly and probably smells bad.  <br> not calling her Cristina </br>  Makise sucks.<br>Steins;Gate sucks.<br>You suck.<br>I wanna hate fuck Moeka 'till she cries.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice try.</br>  <br>Don't call my waifu a slut you faggot.</br>  <br>ze zombie</br>  <br> stupid <br>She invented the theory behind time machines and wrote papers on neuroscience, anon.

Holy shit, I was so far off base.<br><br>Should I play Chaos;Head too?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get out before you're spoiled right now.<br><br>And yes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>sono me: dare no me</br></br>  <br>I got the impression that Kurisu was a composed kuudere from the official art at first too. I admit I felt a bit betrayed when I realized she was just your typical tsundere.</br>    <br> typical <br><br>But she was actually good and developed as a character though.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, she still is best girl after all.

The actual art looks way worse than the last game.    <br>I think huke's art has improved quite a lot.</br>    <br> worse <br>Nigga it looks better.<br> Kaede however has the worst design though. </br></br></br>  <br>Suzuha looks badass, Feyris looks pretty dumb with that big hat though</br>  <br>What the baka did you just fucking say about me, you little baka?

She's the star of the final chapter of the VN, the only heroine besides Kurisu to get both a large, actually detailed figma and an entire manga set from her POV, several other mangas which heavily feature her and expand her character, a drama CD heavily centered around her, she appears and has a major role in other characters' roures in Darling and Phenogram, et-fucking-cetera.<br><br>I'd definitely say that she's the second most appreciated heroine in the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> and probably smells bad. <br><br>At least we have something in common.</br></br></br></br>                             thread is dead <br><br>It's like you faggots don't even love her</br></br>  <br> both a large, actually detailed figma <br>Irrelevant<br> several other mangas which heavily feature her and expand her character, <br>Applies to every other heroine about equally<br> a drama CD heavily centered around her, <br>Moeka has one also <br> she appears and has a major role in other characters' roures in Darling and Phenogram <br>So do other heroines<br><br>Literally all she has going for her is a shitty spinoff POV manga and an extra appearance in the finale that's balanced out by her disappearing for the last four chapters and being the least prominent heroine after Faris anyways.<br><br>She's got jackshit compared to Moeka, Kurisu, or Mayuri and even Lukakp gets more attention in the VN itself - only Faris is on her level of being ignored.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Okabe <br>Soundtracks for films that matchup to his chuuni desires mixed with a fair amount of pseudo-hipster shit to not seem mainstream.<br><br> Mayuri <br>Jpop, anime OSTs, and maybe a bit of older music that reminds her of her granny<br><br> Daru <br>Vocaloids and anime/game OSTs exclusively, doesn't seem like an idoru kinda guy aside from Love Live so I think he'd ignore 3D piggu music.<br><br> Kurisu <br>Mainstream american pop and dad rock, mixed with trendy japanese stuff out of an interest in her birthland. Maybe some jazz too.<br><br> Moeka <br>Nothing. Bitch probably doesnt even own any CDs.<br><br> Lukako <br>I'm gonna guess primarily pop-punk based on the skullpin and preference for black, nothing genuinely subversive but still not entirely mainstream. Maybe some stuff Mayuri lent him too.<br><br> Faris <br>Anime OSTs, bombastic classical stuff, and mayyybee some pop.<br><br> Suzuha <br>Doubt she listened to much growing up but in the past she listens to literally everything to try sample it all. Really loves more upbeat stuff, probably into edm and such.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doubt she listened to much growing up but in the past she listens to literally everything to try sample it all.  <br>I don't know about that, actually. She's seen some old movies, at least -- she mentions in her ending that they watch a lot of pre-SERN movies in the resistance, so it wouldn't surprise me if they had some pre-SERN music in there as well.<br><br> Maybe some jazz too. <br>Fuck, I just got this image in my mind of hanging out with Kurisu in a jazz club and enjoying a drink and some tobacco with her and now I just want to fucking die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a best dad you mean</br>  <br>But anon, Suzuha is not a man</br>  <br> Irrelevant <br>How? It shows that companies consider her as popular and important as Kurisu.<br><br> Applies to every other heroine about equally <br>Again: Oh, fuck off. Faris, Luka are completely ignored in almost all manga, especially the ones which are canon. Whenever Moeka appears in a manga, she's always just quickly used as a plot device, then disregarded again. Meanwhile, most of everything we know about Suzu's childhood in both Alpha and Beta, her thought process and personality in Beta, and her years spent between 1975 and 2000 in Alpha, comes from the intensive focus she gets across at least five different manga series.<br><br> Moeka has one also  <br>That's true and a good point. Kurisu, Faris, Mayuri, Moeka and Suzuha all get further developed and explored in the drama CDs. But Luka barely appears in any of the CDs, and has no bearing on the plot of any of them. So Suzu still isn't the most neglected heroine in that department.<br><br> So do other heroines <br>That's also true, but to nowhere near the extent that Suzuha does. Faris' route in Phenogram is basically just a second Suzu route, but set from Faris' POV.<br><br>As for your final point that Faris and Suzu are the most ignored in the original VN itself, again again: Oh, fuck off! Whereas the early chapters barely feature Luka and Faris at all, and give them little involvement in the plot, Suzuha recieves lots of screentime, building her character and dropping hints about her true identity, and she is instrumental to most of the early plot advancements. Post Chapter 5, all the heroines get a chapter devoted almost solely to themselves, but in addition to that, Suzuha gets to come back with a cool new design and revamped personality and backstory, taking the spotlight in Chapter 10, which is meant to be Kurisu's chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How much of epigraph has been translated? I want to read it but I hear the translation is incomplete  <br>I went out with a girl that was a essentially a freckled version of Kurisu.<br> Tall <br> Shiney copper top hair <br> Physics major <br> Clever <br> Opinionated, pushy, bossy and unable to admit being anything less than right about absolutely everything <br> Perfect hot pink nipples on perky tits <br> Dirty, dirty, dirty <br>Unfortunately she had a kid already and went back to the father, who is paralyzed from a motorcycle accident (that he got into while leaving the girl's house he was cheating on her with) and barely has a HS education.<br>That's cool though... I'm fine solo.<br>That didn't hurt my feelings at all.<br>I'm going to have a few drinks and go shoot some bottles in the back yard now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  anyone knows how to stop chaos;head constant freezing?  <br>Nice blog, where can I subscribe?</br>  <br> Unfortunately she had a kid already and went back to the father, who is paralyzed from a motorcycle accident (that he got into while leaving the girl's house he was cheating on her with) and barely has a HS education. <br><br>Now that's rough.</br></br></br>  I just finished watching Steins;Gate. Best love story ever told. What now?  <br>I wouldn't openly admit I frequent here.</br>  <br>Epigraph is split into three parts:<br> Epigraph of the Closed Curve <br> Pandora of Eternal Return <br> Altair at the Apoapsis of Infinity <br>Eprigraph is fully translated, Pandora is only half translated, Altair isn't translated at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>same here, I just watched the end and then watched the movie. Now I feel so empty.<br><br>Am I a faggot for wanting to cry every episode after Mayuri gets killed? That show literally ripped my heart out over and over again, and now I want more.<br><br><br>can any anons recommend an anime as alluring and emotional as S;G? <br><br> inb4 clannad, i hate the art style </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel you anon, I normally hate moeblob characters but I grew to love Mayuri.<br>There's a movie? Holy shit I better get on that.<br> The episode where Kurisu leaves and she kisses Okabe is the only time I've cried to anime </br></br></br>  <br>I only cried in Episode 21 when Mayuri is talking to her grandma's grave. I don't know why it got to me. It's hard to make me cry so props to the anime makers.</br>  <br>I cried at the VN Kurisu ending<br>The two of them finally realize they love each other and kiss and then Kurisu essentially dies and no one except Okabe remembers her. It's heartbreaking.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>a-anon, why are you so rude?</br>  <br> suffer for an indeterminate amount of time, watching your best friend die over and over and over again <br> nobody understands what you're going through, you're mostly alone <br> finally find somebody to help you get through it <br> fall in love and shit <br> have to basically kill them off <br>Suffering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst was doing Mayuri's ending after getting the Kurisu end and the true end.  Sentencing her to death and she's trying to be strong about it but you can tell that it's killing her on the inside, and with no fleeting reconciliation since they never kiss or express their true feelings. </br>  <br><br>yeah, the movie doesn't really add anything substantial to the plot, but it's still a decent watch.<br><br>I normally hate moe too, but mayuri was just so innocent and care-free, and then to see her die time after time after time, I could really see where okabe was coming from in his mental anguish.<br><br>It's hard for me to find an anime that draws me in episode after episode like S;G did.

On a scale of 1 to Nanoha how befriending is this anime?  <br>2 Nanohas</br>   managed to watch ep1 of rokka no yuusha <br> thought I can get free at least for a couple hours <br> suddenly I'm watching the scene from G when Hibiki takes Maria's Gungnir <br> Seiten Galaxy Cross is on repeat </br></br></br>  <br>SYMPHOGEAR/Nanoha</br>  <br>  rokka no yuusha <br>Action heavy or not?</br></br>  I  didn't like Galaxy Cross that much. <br>The trio song in the beginning though, that was the shit.</br>  <br>She has to compensate for Maria's uselessness.</br>  <br> Maria's uselessness <br>Fight me in the parking lot, I'll be there in 20 minutes.</br></br>  <br>At least you tried Maria</br>  <br>I want Maria to lock me in with her strong thighs</br>  <br><br>She'll make a comeback eventually!</br></br>  <br>What expression is that face trying to convey?</br>  <br>Despair</br>  <br><br>It's the "I'm still learning how to draw faces" face.</br></br>  <br> *combines katanas* <br> *moonlights behind you* <br> Pshh nothing personell... doll </br></br></br>  <br>I'll miss her tornado cape.

Probably less in terms of quantity, but just as much in terms of quality.<br>Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies, befriending all 4 and giving them all the lesbian syndrome. Add to this 2 big bads (including 1 who went somewhat into the befriended category) and an unknown (very high) number of Noise monsters.<br>Nanoha in two seasons befriended 2 magic users, also infecting both with the gay, 1 big bad, 4 knights and 1 book.<br><br>Between a S2 Hibiki punch and a S2 Starlight Breaker, the raw befriending amount is mostly equivalent, despite having opposite classes (Hibiki is very-very-very-close quarters, Nanoha is mid-to-long-ranged friendship Raising Heart fuck yeah).<br>Both would probably end up befriending themselves. That said, Fate and Tsubasa would probably feel awkward together in the same scene. Hibiki also has the advantage of starting up already in a gay relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies <br>5, if you count  Hibiki's girlfriend.

Micha and Garie probably won't appear until later.</br>  <br>to be fair maria is probably more of a detriment.</br>  <br> Chino is the final boss of Symphoger GX <br>I see we are destined to not take any other Symphogear antagonist seriously after Fine.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeahlchemists have been known to manipulate the four elements.</br>  <br><br>Both their designs are shit so no.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd order her if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't like hat loli <br>You は shit</br></br>  <br>While I love the "Maria is useless" meme as much as the next guy  except I don't, she's my favorite  living  character , she was shown to be fast enough and skilled enough to fight it, just not strong enough to actually damage/disable it without her GEAH. That said, you could probably sell the argument that the autoscorer was holding back, knowing it didn't need to use it's full strength against an essentially unarmed human.</br>  <br>as much as I love the maria is useless meme as well, I was actually being serious here.<br>2 on 1 doesn't help much when 1 member clearly outclasses the second, and tsubasa doing blade flips all over the place means maria needs to stay the fuck back. maria being there means tsubasa has to keep track of her as well as the doll to make sure no harm comes to maria by accident or if the doll wants to use her as a distraction.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it yellow vs Chris? Red and Blue would probably go for the 2 kids.</br></br>  <br>Knocked out.</br>  <br>I more meant that Maria was show to be fast/agile enough to dodge, meaning Tsubasa wouldn't have to worry about defending her, rather than Maria being of any actual help. Just that she wouldn't necessarily be a detriment.</br>  <br>What if Phara actually has an AoE though? She's wind and those types usually have an area wide attack. She only used it as a barrier against bullets but it's easy to see her also using it all around her forcing Tsubasa to defend Maria.</br>  <br>just because she might be fast enough doesn't mean tsubasa wants to be doing crazy shit near her. and the doll isn't really an enemy you can let your focus stray from. the simple fact that maria is nearby is enough to fuck with tsubasa even if its just a little, and unlike chris or hibiki she can't rely on maria to do anything because she doesn't have a gear.</br>  Maria will be useful. Just awit for it.  <br>I began to watch this<br>just got the ZENBU part and I'm loving it</br></br>  <br>Remember, no survivors.</br>  <br><br>useful for breeding once ver comes out of jail</br></br>  <br>she grows outside being the villain of the week, right</br>  <br>Chris was such a great partially-insane antagonist back then.</br>  <br> once ver comes out of jail <br>I wonder if they ever visited Ver. Whether for reconciliation or the drugs.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear picked up during Bikki's "ご飯＆ご飯" speech for me.</br>  <br>She becomes a protagonist towards the end of S1 and remains as such in S2 and S3</br>  <br>Things were much simpler back then.<br><br>Nehustan+Ichaival Chris was probably the best antagonist of the series. Will Carol beat the record?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She is too moefied though. Like, she's the best when she's fighting. I understand the appeal of gap moe, but I do want more of that side of her.</br></br>   Wanted to post Chris's transformation sequence from Symphogear G <br> It's down due to authors' right <br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>Well, you know.</br>  <br>She becomes  best girl </br>  Tsundere moe blob Chris is best Chris.  <br>She does hold the record for  the most stupid betrayal ever  thanks to S2.<br><br>Watching S1 fully unspoiled makes for a lot of great moments, including pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's the only thing you need,</br>  <br>It's in the official channel anon.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CWD<wbr>zq63AvuM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>The ZENBU part where she switches to Ichaival was incredibly hype. Not sure if Carol can pull it off because she's not as active, but maybe one of the dolls can.</br>  <br>It's important to note that the befriending is slow and painful, making it more compelling than the average.</br>  <br>   the most stupid betrayal ever <br> But it's obvious that that was just so she could get close to Ver and get the cane. <br>Or do you mean that's the stupid thing?</br></br></br>  <br>The hero always escapes from jail eventually, right?</br>  <br>She's shooting death rays at Hibiki in the first episode, how much more active do you want?</br>  <br>I really want her to go sword&amp;board or twohander with Airgetlam for the full paladin mode but knowing Symphogear it will probably be something crazy like giant hands.</br>  <br>I'm hoping the plot point about the FIS girls still needing linker means he has a shot to make an appearance.</br>  <br>She's already carrying Tsubasa's baby.</br>  <br>you guys know they have their own version of linker. ver's wasn't anything that special.</br>  <br>They had linker without him though, it's been in since the first episode.</br>  <br>It was though. His LiNKER was a lot safer.</br>  <br><br> In the Playstation game Wild Arms 2 which was created by the same producer of Symphogear, Airgetlam is a main plot item that basically drove the entire story of that game. In game, Airgetlam is a legendary holy silver sword that grants people immense power and make them heroes to defeat evil, but will drain the wielder's soul to fuel its power. Anyone completely drained of their soul dies and their soul wanders in the lost void forever. </br></br>  Since they accented the Bikkibutt in Bikkies transformation and will accent the ZENBUS in Chris', what will be the focus of Tsubasa's transformation?  <br>kanade's linker wasn't dangerous she was just retarded about it and started fighting without having any in her system.<br>that and she ODed on it like a retard.</br></br>  <br>Ver's LiNKER was much, much better than anything the 2nd Division had in G, and if Chris's words are anything to go by, they still don't have anything matching that.</br>  <br>The flatness of her blade.</br>  <br>Her  sword .</br>  <br>Jamface.</br>  <br>Her  uselessness .<br><br>You knew this was coming anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br>The gothlolis were going to be badly harmed when singing their superb songs but Hibiki absorbed the energy instead.</br></br>  <br>Vagina bones window.</br>  <br><br>His was better wasn't it? Unless I'm remembering it wrongly. If they do go back to the old one, I guess that's interesting too since there's more danger to actually choosing to go into battle and making it more heroic.</br></br>  <br>they just didn't have any linker on hand. I'm assuming the gears don't get called into action that often so they don't carry it around everywhere.<br><br>I don't recall seeing anywhere it said it was better, the linker they used on kanade wasn't bad, she was fighting without it so it fucked her over.</br></br></br>  <br> everything <br><br><br>That's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about S1 though. Even Zoid made the same mistake.<br><br><br>They sure weren't harmed when they hit each other with them near the end of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the most likely. She didn't really have a 'charm point' before, but the vagina bones are a possibility.</br>  <br> that's one of the biggest misconceptions <br>what was it then? I'm pretty sure the keywords explicitly say that it was because of the lack of linker that she died.</br></br>  <br>Her new motorcycle.</br>  <br>It's not related - the lack of LiNKER was because Fine's plan involved both taking the Nehushtan and killing Kanade. She intentionally deprived her of it for some time.</br>  <br> not having linker is not related to her not having linker while fighting <br>anon what the fuck is wrong with you?</br></br>  <br>If Linker deprivation makes you puke blood too like she did in the manga it sure doesn't sound like it's a safe drug.</br>  <br>Whatever that thing is supposed to be it will take our ride to a whole other level of crazy.</br>  <br>the puking blood thing was from overdosing rather than deprivation.<br>which I guess is 1 thing ver's had over theirs, but that's not really a confirmed thing.<br><br>plus I doubt the defense force's scientists were just jacking off the whole time and didn't improve it all this time later.</br></br></br></br>   Chris <br> 153cm <br> B90/W57/H85 <br><br> Hibiki <br> 157 cm <br> B84/W58/H86 <br><br>Chris is an angry, tiny and fluffy moe blob.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was puking blood in the manga shortly before the Zwei Wing concert, when she supposedly wasn't on Linker</br>  <br>Kanade specifically says in the manga that it's because of deprivation.</br>  Symphhogear movie never  <br><br>manga is half canon and she was basically their lab rat so I wouldn't be surprised if she was fucked from lots of different things.<br>plus you have to remember she originally had 0 compatibility with symphogear. the only reason she could use it in the first place was because she fucked her body up really hard.</br></br></br>  Remember when /a/ said for a long time that Kirika and Shirabe's songs was a duet. Remember all the versions made by fans? Remember how it ended up being one of the best song from Symphogeah G?  Cute !!!  <br> best song from G <br>but that's wrong.</br></br>  <br>GX design statues fucking when?</br>  <br>That's very sexy. She didn't feel shorter than everyone when she was introduced in the nehushtan armor but imagining it in retrospect is funny.</br>  <br>This. It's the best song from the whole show.</br>    <br>I don't really like that channel.<br>They cut parts of the fights for no reason and make the video look like it's telling you the anime isn't that cool.</br></br>  <br>Never, just like G, enjoy more bunny Chris recolors.</br>  <br>S1E7 has the best 3 minutes of the series.<br>http://a.uguu.se/bewibp.webm</br></br>  <br>Never</br>  This show is so super good; fun, entertain, hot blood music, over-the-top fighting, etc.. thanks for let me know this show /a/ <br>I love Nana-chan and Aoi-chan</br>  I'm looking forward to having fun with you /sg/  <br> cringy charts <br>no more please</br></br>  <br>What did we ever do to deserve this</br>  <br> not loving cringy charts <br>I bet you think symphogear is only okay too.</br></br>  <br> Actually liking cringy charts <br>I like when the reaction charts aren't full of cringy text.

Grorious Break is a random Nana song that is admittedly awesome and fits well.</br>  <br><br>Oh fug <br>I like it<br><br>Still no synchrogazer</br></br></br></br></br>  Did the first episode seem like 2 crammed into one to anyone else?<br>Not in a bad way, but it seemed like so much happened and was so entertaining but was over in the space of 1 episode.</br>    <br>The slice of life parts were a bit too short if you ask me.</br>  <br>friendly reminder that hibiki has absolutely no qualms against hitting chris with a swan song tier punch.</br>  <br>Hibiki does this a lot</br>  <br>Than again she does not have qualms against hitting Chris with swan song-tier  hugs  either.</br>  <br>I thought they were just right.</br>  So I was rewatching G and holy shit, they broadcasted naked Maria and Hibiki worldwide.  <br>Yes, they did.<br>And it gave ultimate hope to every last people on Earth.</br></br>  <br> Tachibana Hibiki, you really are the Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX: Believe in Justice and Hold a Determination to Fist. of our times. </br>  <br> Calling Tsubasa useless. </br>  <br>Sorry, I thought the question referred to Maria.<br><br>Perhaps I too am like Maria.</br></br></br>  <br>It kinda sounds like one of her older songs</br>  <br>Why were those Buddhist monks watching TV anyway?</br>  <br>they could feel that the miracle of hibiki's butt was about to appear.</br>  <br>Tsurugi da!</br>  <br>I fucking love that moment</br>  /a/ I haven't watched animu for two years now, should I rewatch G to prepare my posterior?  <br>Rewatch straight from S1<br> By the time you finish, GX ep 2 might be out </br></br>  <br> implying you can prepare yourself for symphogear </br>  <br><br>No posterior in the world is prepared enough.</br></br>   get preview images in a few days <br> it will only be screen caps of that red doll with blood on her claws  <br> standing in Chris's apartment </br></br>  <br> Rewatch straight from S1 <br>B-But I rewatched S1 while waiting for the last episode of G.<br><br><br><br>Some preparation is still good for the inevitable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Quick, post your most played Symphogear tracks.<br> tfw filthy casual </br>    <br>Hibiki's physiology has been permanently altered by her little cancer experience.<br> To call her a walking talking singing relic would be an apt descriptor. </br></br>  <br> didn't get into the show until now <br> seeders for both the OST and character songs are most likely dead <br> all I have with me is   STARDUSTO </br></br></br>  <br>Too spooks</br>  <br>Should have more Symphogear on here, but play counts don't carry over between formats.</br>    <br>She had to, Nehustan is stupid tanky. It's a full relic and a goddamn armor after all.<br><br><br>I hope we get to see the parent teacher conference. For fun, and also because I want to know what grandma Tachibana sounds like.</br></br></br></br>    Are that many people unable to get the old OSTs? I can probably put everything on mega it will just take time to sort.  <br><br>I think it's more like the relic fragments slowly replaced her cells with a close approximation of what it things human cells should be. Physiologically she's human, but the relic could have made improvements to better accommodate itself.</br></br>  <br><br>I think it's more that people used to just youtube particular songs when they felt like it. They only really started taking them down hard in recent months.</br></br>  <br> people still use youtube for readily available music <br>It's really not hard to just download things.</br></br>  <br>If anything that makes her less of a slut<br>Normal girls don't wear a bra with their pyjamas, much less black lingerie</br></br>  <br>but technically ripping it from youtube is legal.</br>  <br><br>People are just lazy, like why watch streamed anime when you can just download it? I'm just giving you a possible answer.</br></br>  <br> technically ripping from Youtube is legal <br><br><br>If you're streaming and not downloading, obviously you don't give a shit about what you're watching anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really can't wait for Tsubasa's fight song(s).</br>  <br>What if Hibiki's real dad shows up? Won't be so fun then.<br><br>Hibiki's grandma showed up in s2 anyway.</br></br></br>  Does /a/ likes loli?  <br>you mean that peep? or the other?</br>  Lolis were made to be cute and hugged. Never lewd.  <br>you can't be serious</br>  <br>Are you sure?</br>  <br>yes</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>nice board, i wouldn't use it tho, but i used hookups boards a lot when i was an edgy teenager, loved that decks</br>  My filth arrived  <br>Pre-orders closed months ago, anon.</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>The FBI is probably tracking your every movement right now</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127650<wbr>667/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br><br>Please, don't respond to him. When we ignore him he stops with the idol bullshit.

It would help on the context since some people are having trouble here.</br>  <br> I mean, if you wouldn't translate it as that then how can you say it means that <br>Because literal and actual meaning and all that.<br>朝から literally means "from morning"<br>"since" is wrong I suppose because it specifically implies that time has passed, but it's not that far off.<br><br>Say you're transating an easy kotowaza like 蛙の子は蛙. You could say that it means "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree" or you could translate it as "A frog's child is also a frog" and explain that it's a metaphor. Whether you translate the metaphor or not is kind of up to preference.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off normie</br>  <br>I still don't really get it, these idols are basically like Miss America, or something?
