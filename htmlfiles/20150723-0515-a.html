[ Getting real fucking tired of these eyes. I know all harem MC's are meant to be empty husks for self-insertion, but this is taking it too far.

The guy that they want people to self insert into cant be more alpha than the audience ...then why give him eyes?</br>  It's there to show his constant state of bewilderment with how his life's turned out.  It's funny they kept Miia's face from that small panel  <br>Mr hands pls</br>  He's the worst part of the show and sadly, he takes all the screen time  how can you guys enjoy this without nipples    That series is garbage and people who like are fucking disgusting.  <br>The fanbase is full of crossboarders so it's baby first harem for them.</br>  <br>So, what are you doing here, faggot?</br>  <br>They probably compile shedding and director chapters in one episode.</br>  <br>You mean the shedding happens and then the next day/half of episode is the director stuff?</br>  <br>Yes, and next episode is Ranchee's appearing and jealous Centorea chapters.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>Nice meme!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>Why would you care about secondaries in a harem adaptation<br> implying there's plot or any notable character development </br></br>  <br> not liking anti spiral darling <br><br>Get a load of this new faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>First, you discard any dignity you still have.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br> x, x everywhere <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br> Not liking anti spiral eyes <br>Get the fuck out of here animeonlyfag</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431576 <br>You fags screaming secondaries left and right are just as bad</br>  <br><br>Easily.<br><br>Sheer willpower would allow me to, solely because it was with Miia,</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431576 <br>Doesn't that post imply he read the manga? Darling's eyes are open.</br>  <br>How does reading the manga change the opinion about his faggot eyes?</br>  <br>Are you crazy? Next episode will be the shedding chapter and Suu arriving.</br>  The horse girl is the best because she is cute  <br>You mean Suu surviving. Look at the preview</br>  <br>MCs being clueless to a specific scene(s) in general isn't limited to haremshit.</br>  Papi &gt; Smith = Miia &gt; Cerea<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br> Not including more girls </br>  <br>Which is why it's such a shame that she's attached to a big ugly horse body.</br>  <br>Well, sweet slime rape will begin. I have nothing to complain about.</br>  <br> ugly <br>She's big, strong, powerful, and built. <br><br>You can always rely upon her.</br></br></br></br>  Anime Papi is cute as hell compared to Manga Papi  <br>Yeah right.</br>  <br>Yeah she gave that "loli imouto" vibe this series was lacking</br>  <br>Anime Papi is cute but her voice gets a little weird</br>  <br>Manga Papi's better</br>  <br>It's the voice</br>  <br> cant, only ntr  probably fist her</br>  <br>Confirmed for not knowing shit</br>  <br><br> Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>Cerea is great, it's the horse bit I have a problem with, horses are disgusting unless Z-ton draws them </br></br></br>      <br><br>Cute? Yes.<br><br>Cuter than Miia? Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> birdbrain or normal human <br> superior to Lamia </br></br></br>  <br>I find it encouraging that the show is popular enough for so many people to come on and insult it. Its a compliment really, unpopular things tend to get ignored.</br>  <br>The trouble is the "character development" people seem to want tends to be things that would end a major element of its comedy (i.e. more of the girls figuring out how to not hurt Kimihito), or end the series itself (him picking one or all the girls). On the latter, as much as I would like to see Kimihito's married life, it seems unlikely the series would be as popular if it focused on that.<br><br>Also, given how the series has covered only a pretty short span of time (a couple months at most), its had a reasonable amount of character development. Course much of that has been revealing just who the characters already are in more detail.</br></br></br>  <br>Ive watched the scene like 5 times already where she introduces her, its just too adorable</br>   Yfw they skip the MON chapter so there's more Mero early   <br> &gt;Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>No, I want Cerea not a horse.</br></br>  <br> only 5 times <br>I've watched that first half at least 2 dozen times by now, I get a heart attack every time</br></br>  <br><br> hurting MC <br> comedy <br><br>do people actually think this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horses are disgustingunless Z-ton draws them <br>Horitomo centaurs are cute too.</br></br>  <br>I think they're supposed to laugh when he gets hurt sometimes. I self insert instead</br>  <br>Horitomo can go fuck himself after the last doujin he made</br>  <br>I don't like NTR too. But the story of the donkey centaur, the tsundere lizard and others doujins are nice and heartwarming.</br>  <br>supposedly a handsome guy makes her hot and then another centaur fucks her like horses do</br>  <br>But Cerea has a big fat stinky horse cunt, you can't get around it anon.</br>  <br>I do as well<br><br>I really want Miia to rape me and hug me so tight and close that she breaks a rib when we both cum at the same time and I impregnate her</br></br></br>  BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>GIRL<br>I<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I just unlocked the 1500 point second letter for Miia<br><br>Can someone translate?</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna go home and re watch it and then EP 3 since I forgot it released yesterday</br>  <br>Or you know, kick the centaur on the head and fuck her yourself</br>  <br>This. Please shut up.</br>  <br>What if a centaur woman was a shotacon?</br>   two weeks until worst girl   <br>Shes a big girl</br>  <br>But two weeks for MON.</br>  <br>2 years until monstergirls invade the real world</br>  <br>this was the 1100 pic for Miia? haven't seen it until now</br>  Well the MC could be worse I guess. He could be Kampher 2.0  <br>do centaurs sport more pair of tits on their horse parts<br><br>and why is she covering her horse part chest? Her genitals is way behind her.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea is incredibly moe.</br>  <br>Ya, I unlocked it awhile ago<br>I also have those 3 face response app things that I can post when I get home<br>And I posted her second letter a bit earlier in the thread</br></br></br>  <br>The more clothing they put on Miia, the more she looks like a worm.</br>  <br>Sasuga Chiyo Sakura</br>  <br>Imagine Monmusu with Muromi instead of Mero. Or even better, Levia-san. I mean, just any fish who's actually interesting.</br>  I like Miia, she's cute.  What if mero's dad is a serial killer  <br>Its allowed to be considered funny in part because he recovers so fast. And given he tends to get hurt unintentionally I find it a lot more tolerable than the mean-spirited "how dare you accidentally touch me" injuries harem MCs suffer in other series.<br><br>It also makes Rachnera look better so that's a plus. ^_^ I do have to suspend some disbelief though that the other girls still haven't learned better how to control themselves (perhaps if, like Rachnera, they ever inflicted an injury that lasted more than a few panels they would take things more seriously).</br></br></br>  <br> Levia instead of Mero <br><br>Best show.</br></br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off back to plebbit, you shitfuck</br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  Kind of a weird thing to notice but I did too. I think they took it a bit too far in the last episode.  Not going to lie: the jokes aren't really landing for me the second time around. Watching the anime is just reminding me of all the things I didn't like about the manga like the non-entity of an MC  <br>I'm only watching it for scenes with my waifu</br>  <br>It's not just ass and tits man. Legs also work well with a good ass and tits.</br>  <br>It's a good thing I don't take things here seriously, I guess that face has negative connotations here. Consider me na√Øve.</br>  <br>Consider what we know of the other parents, unlikely. He's probably a human prince or something that gave up his royalty to be with Mero's mom.</br>  <br> Miia <br>They are all cuter than her.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense if mero mom is royalty Then why would he give up royalty</br>  <br>Aside from parodying morons from other sites, emoticons haven't been considered acceptable on 4chan for at least 5 years.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  MON SQUAD WHEN?<br>LALA WHEN?</br>  <br>smith a shit.<br>that pig voice.</br></br>  <br> talking shit about Yu Kobayashi <br><br>This is some poor bait. Not even worth a bait image.</br></br></br>  <br>think whatever you want.</br>  <br>I have nothing against people liking Lala, but you have to admit that she is the most underdeveloped character so far.</br>  <br>MON in two weeks.<br><br>Lala never.</br></br></br>  <br>This being terrible bait is a fact, anon.</br>  <br>Sure, but I feel like she has the most potential for development. <br><br>I mean, I like her this much despite the lack of development. I will love her with some development, I imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>Cereas ears.<br><br>I wanna touch them a play with them.</br></br></br>  <br>A bit longer than that <br>I remember people being shat on for it back in 2007</br></br>  <br> Lala never <br> implying </br></br>  <br>I want to nibble them while she squirms and pants.</br>  Which one of Zombina's eyes is originally hers, the yellow one or green one?  <br>I pretty much only come on here to see comments on Monster Musume, read the translations from Translator Fag etc. I know little of general 4chan stuff.</br>  <br>Where the he'll are you people coming from?</br>  Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters?<br><br>If it was just 3 cute girls all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  <br>Look kid, lemme help you not embarrass yourself and also not make this place more of a shithole than it already is. I'll give you a little bit of advice.<br>Stop posting.</br></br>  Ok so a Scylla is next. Predictions on her personality or the awkward situation Kimihito will be placed in?  <br> Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters? <br>Absolutely not</br></br>  <br>No, that's stupid.</br>  <br>GET.....OUT</br>  <br>You're mean</br>  <br>That's fucking sick</br>  <br>I've been reading and posting about the Musume threads here for over a year, no reason to stop over one emoticon. In fact, I think this is the first time I've offended anybody here.</br>  Will Darling get any more harem members, or will is just be monsters of the week from now on like the farm chapter?  What's the point of including a girl if she has no chance of winning?  <br>I think the house is crowded enough. Hell Lala doesnt really have that much of a reason to be there</br>  <br>leave and don`t come back</br>  <br>But this way, the monster is on the outside of the girl.</br>  <br>Where did you come from</br>  <br> we want the pedo audience<br>i see her more as a sister than an actual competitor</br></br>  Anybody got the English lamia subspecies end thingy?  <br> pedo <br> same age as the others <br> body isnt even young looking, just petite </br></br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>The fuck you mean papi isn't winning?</br>  <br>But Horse pussy's already there.</br>  <br>not even in the running really, her and Suu are in the same boat of being adopted daughters or sisters like you said</br>     mfw anime-only fags popping up all over the place   <br>None of them are in the running.<br><br>It will be a harem end or nothing.</br></br></br>    <br>I need the practice, so I transcribed it as best I can. Like the others, Miia's second note is basically an apology for some unspecified thing, she says she likes that he takes care of them, and she loves him. Wait for TF or someone with a better grasp than I for high quality translation.<br><br> „Å†„ÅÅ„Çä„Çì <br>  <br> „Åì„ÅÆ„Åæ„Åà„ÅØ„ÄÅÊÄí„Å£„Å¶„Åî„ÇÅ„Çì„Å≠„ÄÇ <br>  <br> „Å†„ÅÅ„Çä„Çì„ÄÅÁßÅ„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®ÊÉ≥„Å£„Å¶Ë®Ä„Å£„Å¶„Åè„Çå„Åü„ÅÆ„Å´„ÄÇ <br> „Åª„Çì„Å®„ÅÜ„Å´„ÄÅ„Åî„ÇÅ„Çì„ÅÇ„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ <br>  <br> „ÅÑ„Å§„ÇÇÂÑ™„Åó„Åè„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Çå„Çã„Å†„ÅÅ„Çä„Çì„Åå„ÄÅ <br> ÁßÅ„ÅØÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ <br>  <br> „Å†„ÅÅ„Çä„Çì„Å®„Åö„Éº„ÄÅ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´„ÅÑ„Çâ„Çå„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„ÄÅ <br> „Åì„Çå„Åã„Çâ„ÅØ„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Å®Ë®Ä„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®ËÅû„Åè„Å≠„ÄÇ <br>  <br> „Å†„ÅÅ„Çä„Çì„ÄÅÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Å†„Çà„ÄÇ <br>  <br> „Éü„Éº„Ç¢ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this one gets it</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Everyone assumes its a harem ending, which it very well may be.

Like vomit-inducing repulsive. I feel physically ill whenever I see her on screen.</br>  <br>I feel physically ill when I see your posts.</br>  <br>You're the one complaining</br>  <br>I'm not even a Cereafag and I think you're a faggot</br>  <br> That's just you wanting to throw up all that shit from having shit taste.</br>  <br><br>flying miia is the best.</br></br>  <br><br> sametails <br>Crabman is a hack.</br></br></br>  <br>So is God, because every snake with the exception of rattle snakes have the same tail. Rattlesnakes are the SJWs of the snake world, because "LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH, SILLY SERPENTS!"</br>  <br>If you see just her face, she's cute, but the further down you go, the worse it gets.</br>  What did the author do before this and his other series got published? He only had those small doujins before that, right? Assistant work or something?  <br>Posting the other English one as well. Too troublesome to directly transfer from phone to netbook.</br>  <br><br>Not him but I haven't even touched the anime. What chapter do they explain that? At ch. 21 by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sometime after chapter 21.</br>  <br>And as a manga only fag, how is the anime so far? Because like I said I haven't touched it yet.</br>  <br> SECONDARY DETECTED <br><br>Also use the fucking catalog you secondary piece fo shit.</br></br></br>  <br> You will never pet a Medusa's head. <br><br>God is a true bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>its almost exact except for the censorship here and there</br>  <br>Average</br>  <br>I like lamias, but logically Centorea sp? really is the best girl she hurts the mc far less then the others and really looks out for him its actually pretty touching.</br>  <br>Animated monstergirls but censorship everywhere</br>  <br>Imagine the shits she must take...</br>  <br>Anime voices match manga voices</br>  <br>Just as shallow and cute, I read the manga a few years back how did that end up?</br>  <br>Meaning the voices are what you expected to sound like?</br>  <br> SECONDARY </br>  <br>What if you use an actual horse?</br>  <br>Hell no, the only good voices for now are Cerea and Smith's</br>    In the translation of the Manga I read, Papi calls Darling "Husband", but she calls him Master in the anime. I really dislike that she's being used as the loli-body train for the incest and maid fanbases.  <br>No I did not mean that</br>  Do you prefer Papi referring to him as either Master, Husband, or Boss?  If Papi gave you a handjob, would she fly?  <br><br>Rattlesnakes have actually stopped rattling-a number of them, at least</br></br>  <br>Husband, honestly. I still don't understand the logic behind Boss for some reason...</br>  <br>No one care about her, anyway</br>  <br>I think it stems from Miss Smith telling Papi that Kurusu is the boss of the house and should listen to him or something.</br>  <br>Rude</br>  <br>Considering the genre, all of them have about the same chance as anyone else. Doppel could suddenly win the Darling bowl in the next chapter and no one would be surprised. Although, it's a moot point since it's a given he will end up with Lala, no matter who he chooses.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>This is an anime board first and foremost, it's retards like you who should fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Her ears are awful design</br></br>  <br>Then stop watching this shit and read the manga.</br>  <br>I should really check out the 7Sea release one of these days. See for myself just how much of a trainwreck it is.</br>  <br> ridiculously large tits <br>peadophile detected</br></br>  <br>it's a fresh dank meme</br>  <br>As someone who hasn't read the manga, is this just going to be "DAARIIING~~" getting abused and continiously used as a slipper for 10 more episodes? Because that seems like lost potential<br><br> I do want to fuck Cerea though, so there's that </br></br></br>  <br>I buy it mainly to support Crabman, but yeah they need to proofread that shit. Tio and Polt were accidentally referred to as Tia and Port -_-</br>  <br>I'm not sure if Papi and Cerea are using the exact same words to call Kimihito, but yeah the fansubs use "Master" regardless. <br><br>I'm curious how the english dub will do it</br></br></br>  <br> -_- <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Port I can understand, but Tia? Where'd that come from?</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/GEpNq</br>  <br>If you haven't bought the english volumes, then that means you bought the original versions, right?<br><br>Anyway, I guess 7seas has a lot of silly animal puns, I remember mostly when the girls are making fun of Cerea. Other than the jokes I think it's a fine translation though I have not compared it to the online translations</br></br></br>  <br>Horse shit is way cleaner than human shit nigga.</br>  <br>I prefer Boss. Calling him Master seems too formal for her.</br>  <br>Well Papi uses they typical Goshujin, while Cerea uses a ceremonial form that I don't know the romaji for.</br>  <br>Considering that Sentai has the license for it, I shudder at the thought.<br><br>Hillary Haag as either Papi or Suu. I'm willing to wager dollars to donuts on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Duh. No wonder I haven't heard that yet.</br>  <br>Does Hound do the translations? I remember someone explaining how it's hard to translate the exact term Papi uses into english.</br>  <br>It was some kind of mistranslation, but kept in for consistency's sake.<br>Papi is saying something like "boss."</br></br>  <br><br>If Papi can lift Miia, why can't Melusines lift themselves?</br></br>  <br>My guess is that they forgot Tio is suppose to be short for Tionishia and used an actual female name for their translation.</br>  <br>Read the credits page.</br>  New video<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14375<wbr>65938</wbr></br>  <br>People seem to worship horse pussy, but would centaurs even feel human dicks?<br>Centaurs can only mate with other centaurs.</br></br>  <br> It is Miia's toothbrush </br>  <br>Well, the shu in goshujin is the same kanji as the su in Kurusu. Also the same as Aruji(Cerea). And yes, they're from the root Chinese word for Master</br>  So, every time he rides Cereal, she can feel his balls and dick on her back, huh?  <br>If they're equipped exactly like horses, then no a human dick wouldn't do squat, she wouldn't feel anything and your dick wouldn't even penetrate far enough for impregnation to occur. So you sex life would have to consist of lots of fisting and if you wanted to have kids it'd have to be done through artificial insemination.</br>  <br>Most likely, since he also must get hard from grabbing on her tits.</br>  <br><br> believing chuuni delusions when they've been explicitly revealed as such in the manga </br></br>  <br>If you've read the manga you'd know that Cerea is born of a Centaur mother and a human father, so I guess it works out. Snake pussy wouldn't work either, going on real world anatomy, since cloacas have no muscles.</br>  <br>Thanks. Think I'll probably still redo them, just for redrawing practice, as well as the big white chunks cut out of the girls triggering my autism.</br>  <br>Eh, Cerea was conceived somehow, so I doubt centaurs have the full same physiology of an actual horse.</br>  <br>For some reason, I can't get tired of hearing the sheep-counting, especially when Papi does it.<br><br> Possible to get the same from Suu, Mero, and Rachnee in the future. <br><br>The suspense is terrible. I hope it'll last.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well in Monmusu at least we know that Lamia's have the same set up as humans, with the vagina being where the tail starts.</br>  <br>Where do they shit?</br>  <br>from their asshole, they have a normal butt</br>  <br>We've never actually seen it so that could just be the cloaca.<br><br>In which case  it all comes out and goes in the same hole.<br><br>I think it's better to just assume that in a grand coincidence humans and monster girls are perfectly sexually compatible.  Which makes me a bit less sad about them not existing. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you weren't a faggot you wouldn't spoonfeed him</br>  <br>She says "Danna-sama" in the manga, right?</br>  <br> to just assume <br>But that's the point of monstergirls</br></br>    You can kill off one girl from the series. Who do you pick?<br><br> Cerea. </br></br>  <br> not spoiling it for anime-only fags <br><br>It's like you hate fun.</br></br></br>  I thought I was going to get Yuu Kobayashi singing. But it was cut off, I feel cheated.

Does everyone on /a/ pay for premium crunchyroll?  Is Karera dead?  So what's happening with the better Part 5 translation? I heard there was one being done but it's being updated so slowly.  <br>Wasn't Hotpants' thing that she looked like a man?</br>  No gay priest <br>No abdul is here<br>No evil kakyoin and no hot pants<br><br>final destination</br></br></br></br>  is Pucci evil  <br>And the president was supposed to be chubby and small, but Araki is not known for his consistency.</br>  <br>You do realize that Valentine's whole schtick is going to alternate dimensions and getting a new version of himself to become the new "real" Valentine if he was ever mortally wounded or anything, right?  Fat Valentine was only the first of the Valentines we saw you dumbass </br>  <br>Why would the president be fat only in the based dimension?</br>  <br>Gay priest is pure  and here now. </br>  <br>He probably used a fat version of himself to make people less suspicious of him or something, hell if I know. I doubt fat valentine was the very first/"native" Valentine in the based dimension though.<br><br> There are people ITT that don't realize the reason Valentine   looks so youthful despite being about 50 is because he kept swapping places with Valentines who were more youthful/at their physical peaks </br></br></br>  <br> he kept swapping places with Valentines who were more youthful/at their physical peaks <br>so does that make him the "original" or something</br></br>  <br>I woudn't be sure, remember that Annasui was a girl at first, so I think that Araki had other plans to the president. You have a lore-friendly explanation, but I doubt that's what Araki was looking for.</br>  This time with the real DIO.  So which group did the least shitty job on stardust crusaders?<br><br>Apparently Some-Stuffs fucked up the translation, Commie dropped it not even halfway through the season, and HS is no better than just watching it on CR.</br></br>  <br>DIO looks so out of place next to Araki's new skinny boy</br>  <br>Spanish subs.</br>  <br>When Valentine swaps places with another dimension's Valentine after getting mortally wounded or something, that makes the 'new' Valentine the recipient of his D4C powers and thus the 'true' Valentine. I wouldn't say 'original,' the true original Valentine of the based dimension probably died long ago, judging by how well-practiced he is with his Stand. <br><br><br>Okay, this might be valid if not for the fact that fat Valentine was present for chapters and chapters and Annasui was a girl for literally one chapter/appearance where "she" didn't even speak. I don't think you're right on this one, as much as you might want to think Araki is that much of a hack.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DIO is a skinny fuccboi himself now, just look at his tiny arms.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128410654 <br>god he looks so weird compared to the new style</br>  <br>Final fix.</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus, now that I look at it, Part 7's The World looks so bad even after the edit.</br></br></br>  <br>i think he looks great as long as hes not piss fucking yellow</br>  You have ten seconds to explain Jotaro's hair hat/hat hair.  <br>EZ<br><br> Read the manga/watch the anime </br></br></br>    <br> Johnny doesn't have Johnathans face <br>1/10 for effort</br></br>  I think doc is gay  <br>from what I remember, Doc took this from another anon.</br>  <br>so close to quints, if it were, then I would have believed you.</br>  <br>Not a hack, but he conveniently changes the plot as he finds suitable. I remember on the chapter that Valentine is playing the violin and his "wife" is changing the pages, he is his old chubby self, but as soon as he takes his shirt off, he's all muscles and shit.<br><br>I took it more like a "those angles made him fat" and I'm not complaining, part 7 is my favorite, but I have my doubts about him swapping places as much as you think.</br></br></br>  <br>Either way it's still 1/10 for no johnathan.</br>  <br>why is some parts of the world lighters¬°?</br>  <br>looks like all the red words are anti aliased.</br>  <br>Everything without Jonathan is 1/10 at best though, that goes without saying, so you have to rate things subjectively, relative to other things that lack Jonathan.</br>  <br>All he needs to do to swap places is to be trapped between something. Even something as small as a wheel and the ground. He could have done it simply to make himself more attractive to the lady, especially since he suspected that it wasn't his wife(but still wanted her).</br>  <br>But now you are doing as much assumptions as you assume I'm assuming. Again, just because you have a lore-friendly explanation, it doesn't mean it's correct, it's just a theory based on a solid ground, but without proofs, you're as wrong as I am.</br>  <br>If you prefer your cynical Doylist explanation when there's a perfectly serviceable Watsonian one available that's your prerogative, but I think my explanation covers most if not all angles. And for the record that anon you just replied to is right, do you really think Araki decided IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHAPTER that Valentine suddenly wasn't fat? If it was between chapters, maybe I'd buy it.</br>    Can someone post meme_after.png?  <br>tried<br> just did some antialising and changed the headgear color </br></br>  What is his name again?  <br>Secco</br>  <br>Dat booty</br>  <br>That's The Gimp, from Pulp Fiction.</br>  <br>holy shit its actually looking proper<br>i thought it was just a joke</br></br>    <br>Just wait, Oasis will be there one day, just wait.</br>  <br>This image is beautiful. I just want a comic of all the memes living together in their meme personality format.</br>  So I have a question.<br><br>Stand can only be damaged by other Stands. Stands can also effect physical objects. So when Jotaro was fighting Dio why didn't he just use Star Platinum as a shield to block the knives?<br><br>Do stands just not work that way? Can someone please explain this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask araki.</br>  <br>Stand rules were only oficially stated in Part 7.</br>  <br>Because any damage incurred on the Stand is carried through to the User, unless they're an automatic type. (with varying exceptions)</br>  <br>It's Araki being Araki. He changed Annasui's gender as well and neither got explained.</br>  <br>He tried punching them away, and if he just let star platinum catch them he could get wounded</br>  <br>Main problem is that he's too skinny. I really think Araki could have kept them muscles for at least the stand, same for SP. I don't get why he's so "100% muscles or 0%", he's a great artist but somehow this kind of diversity just go over his head.</br>  <br>I thought it was because he had access to Jesus' heart at some point and then he got all buff because it helped out his cholesterol or some shit.</br>  <br><br>"Stands can only be defeated by other Stands." was a rule in Chapter 139. If you were punching knives would it cut up your fist? But even if the knives were sending damage to Jotaro his hands are completely fine.<br><br><br><br>Talk about ass pulls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hot pantsu is actually there </br>  what's the name of this type of jacket kira wears? it's longer than a suit jacket, but it isn't a coat or a trench coat<br><br>is there a proper name for "a longer type of suit jacket", i want one since going around in a suit is a bit to flashy, but this will suit me since autumn is coming soon</br></br>  <br>No, Gappy saved her</br>  Any idea what's it saying here about DB from the JoJoveller artbook? Would love to know more about DB influence on JoJo.  <br>Finally got to this point in the mango. Why the hell is it called Pucci_after?</br>  <br>Go look at Pucci's wikia page.</br>  <br>DB?</br>  <br>Wow, didn't even notice the changes aside from the Jojo birthmark.</br>  <br>Dragon Ball</br>  <br>I really doubt that's what is being referred too in the book</br>  <br>The text straight up refers to it in long form. <br>"„Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„Éú„Éº„É´"</br></br>  if only joseph turned into a vampire at the end of part 3, part 4 would be a bit more based  <br>yeah, I think the filename itself is the reason for meme and now it's the pose itself that a meme aswell as Pucci himself.</br>  <br>He'd be young again for one thing.</br>  <br><br>He'd also be evil.

It's literally just a Requiem Stand before it got the name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silver Chariot Requiem wasn't supposed to defend Polpol, It was supposed to defend the Arrow and that's is what Polpol wanted, because he didn't wanted to Diavolo to get the arrow.<br><br>Requiems not always help the user, it's supposed to make your desires real, Ex : Nobody knowing Kira's identy = Bite the Dust<br>Polnareff protecting the Arrow = SC Requiem<br>Giorno desire to kill Diavolo = GER</br></br></br></br></br>  i always wondered if araki's random changes in the story like hanged man and sand mans stands, or anasui's gender were because of araki or his editors  gg subs, I kekd. need moar whyyyyyy  <br>That classic biceps pose Star Platinum does in that JoJonium cover is embarrassing.</br>  How would Sex Pistols Requiem help Mista erase the number 4?  <br>Requiem does what the persona needs most<br><br>Kira needed a way to get rid of people trying to find his identity without anyone knowing<br>Giorno needed a counter to Diavolo<br>Pol needed a way to protect the arrow, but died right when it was created so it went haywire</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ill admit that to be true.<br>weak as hell</br></br>  <br>Change the world so that we all use base 4 math. That way, 4 = 10</br>  <br>Im still mad we ever got Jotaros Part 4 outfit in ASB</br>  <br>What were you paying attention to?</br>  <br>The Jojo birthmark on his neck.</br>  good point mah bad  <br>What are you trying to tell us man</br>  <br>Is this your first time on 4chan or what?</br>  im sorry bye, 4chan is to intense    <br/>  <br>It sure is buddy.</br>  <br/>    guys help me, im forgetting who the black stardust crusader is  <br>Polnareff when he picks up Anubis</br>  <br>Iggy's not completely black, you racist.</br>  How is the Viz translation of JoJo compared to the scanlations?  <br>Most likely a little bit of both, but I'd bet it's more often than not a case of him simply changing his mind.</br>  <br>If araki somehow switched back to late 3 art style just for alt diego and el mundo that'd be fucking insane</br>  <br>Why do you care?</br>  <br>Too intense for you.</br>  <br>Its simply an older style classic suit jacket. <br>The shorter ones nowadays are a newer fashion. Kira's is the traditional professional look.<br>Go to any men's clothing store and they will know what you are talking about.</br></br></br>    <br>You aren't impressing anyone Star Platinum.</br>  <br> those Jap faces on foreigners <br> that SP </br></br>  <br>Jotaro looks alright</br>  <br>there's actual progress though which is better than it's been for years</br>  <br>Only Kakyoin, Joseph, and Jotaro look okay.<br>Abdul, Pol, and especially Iggy look awful.<br><br>All the stands look trash.<br><br>Honestly only Araki's new characters look good in the new styles.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do Avdol and Polnareff look like traps?</br>  <br><br>as well as defending the arrow, it switched people's bodies to keep polnareff's soul/consciousness alive since his body was fucked. requiem stands always help the user in some way, even if it's kind of indirectly.</br></br>  <br>Most of those look really solid by standards of older characters outside of their styles. Pol-Pol barely looks different at all, unlike his part 5 self.</br>  <br>Magician's Red has kind of got a goofy face and Star Platinum is just awful, but every other stand is fine.</br>  <br>He looks like a 1920's strongman.</br>  <br>it cuts out swearing and adds some pretty lame sayings (shit like NO WAY HOSE) but it's pretty solid and readable.</br>  Why did Araki completely drop Fugo instead of just changing his story? He didn't like the idea of him betraying the group but that doesn't mean he had to leave him behind in Venice  <br>he probably thought his stand was too OP as well<br>but golden experience is OP as fuck anyway so whatever</br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>    <br> NO WAY HOSE <br>Thank Dio for Batoto</br></br>   he doesn't main Jotaro   <br> Star Platinum. </br>  <br>It feels like only the Jojo's after part 3 look good with the new styles.</br>  <br>yeah it can get pretty fucked, but i wanted them in print so i got the viz ones. if you just wanna read through it though batoto is the best bet.</br>  Reading part 6 again even if I know how its going to end is a bit depressing  <br>I guess it's because that's just the kind of writer Araki is. He had an arc already thought up for Fugo. Perhaps once he decided not to go through with it he found himself unable to reimagine the character and getting rid of him was an easy way out.</br>  <br>Just now i realized how poorly drawn Jotaro clothes are in this pic.</br>    <br>its the eyes, thats whats wrong with his style<br>they look so blank and lifeless</br></br>  <br>New style does well on the gay priest.<br><br> That doppio. <br>Hue.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think this looks good </br>  <br>Everyone looks so fucking...Pretty. (Except Iggy, who looks like a muppet.) It's surreal after what Part 3 actually looked like.<br><br>Poor Star Plat lost all his gains</br></br></br>  <br><br>And a shot of Kira</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Doesnt look like David Bowie, but doesnt mean its bad.</br>  <br>why is doppio there instead of diavolo? he should be there, he's the main villain of part 5 and appears more often than doppio</br>  <br>I forgot to mention that I think SP looks fucking retarded. I also agree that Pol looks a little too feminine. Everything else is good though</br>  <br> that chub face DIO </br>  <br>They're alright, I like the old Joseph in particular quite a bit. They've looked less like themselves than this over the years and it's not like they'll ever be appearing in the manga again anyway so it's just a neat little curiosity.</br>  <br>Josuke looks fine, and Jolyne looks pretty cute actually, but good god that Joseph and Jonathan are unrecognizable (I thought Jonathan was Rohan for a minute there). Those two are the only ones I really really hate in his current style. That far away shot of Dio actually isn't that bad, though he looks too skinny.</br>  The new art brings out Joseph's true terminal fuccboi-itis that was there all along and I can't decide if that's a good thing or not  Is DIO's asshole warm or cold?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GvF<wbr>90NJS-84</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>so good been listening to this on repeat</br></br>  <br>I like the redesigns he gave young Joseph and Johnathan, though. Gives them a more distinguishable and unique look. Oldsephs look reminds me of Speedwagon a bit, which you might say was done on purpose</br>  <br>These pieces of art are underwhelming, especially Part 5 where Narancia looks top heavy.</br>  <br> I still like them <br><br>Part 5s is literally the worst though. We barely get to see the characters and Narancia looks fucking ridiculous</br></br></br>  <br>He looks like a fucking chimpanzee or something.<br><br>To be honest though, that's probably my favorite image of Iggy. He actually looks something like a dog and not some sort of miniature puppet demon thing like he usually does.</br></br></br>  <br>The villain side looks a lot better than the protag side. Really only Dio looks kinda shitty, which can somewhat be attributed to how far away he is.</br>  <br>Straize didn't seem to lose himself at all.<br><br>Besides, it is Araki. Even if he explicitly said at some point that the mask turns people evil, he could ignore it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, look at Narancia's right foot and Abbachio's legs.</br></br>  <br>Pucci looks autistic.</br>  <br>What the fuck am I looking at. Araki really must've just not give a fuck</br>  <br> Pucci <br> Not autistic <br><br>All you have to do is look at how White Snake acts to see that he definitely is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw Whitesnake is just a sperg who tries to act cool.

He checked like every death flag there is.<br><br>Johnny saved himself by revealing something ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just didn't feel like taking it off and enjoyed posting things like this on /v/<br><br> It just works </br></br></br>  <br> They sleep in the same bed. <br> Canon Bisexual <br> Dio has been known to engage in sex with and without reason <br> Time for Heaven <br>There's no way they didn't have sex, prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His death flag was already fully checked when he was introduced as a Zeppeli and was Johny's friend and mentor.<br><br>Plus it was already hinted that he was Will's counterpart, and it didn't matter which original Zeppeli he was the counterpart of since both died.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a small point against it in that Dio describes this ideal friend he's looking for as "in control of their sexual appetites," but that's vague enough that it doesn't really have to mean celibacy and even if it did, I can see Dio not really giving a fuck when it comes to their attitude towards himself because he does what he wants, celibacy be damned.</br>  someone post the TONIGHT, YOU edit someone here did on iggy and polnareff    does polenareff regret not being able to save avdol and iggy?    <br>probably, and it probably haunted him everyday for the remainder of his own life</br>  <br>No, he's probably cool with it.</br>  <br>Pucci probably didn't care for sex but if DIO asked I don't think he'd turn it down. Do you think DIO would let that tight boipucci go unfucked?</br>    HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how many little brown boys he was able to get in Egypt I guess</br>  Who is best jojo and why is it  Joseph?   <br>best JoJo is obviously  Jesus </br>  <br>Because  it's impossible to beat a clever as hell fuccboi who evolves into a GDILF and then just an adorable old man. He's perfect.  </br>  <br>Apparently not many if he had to get one to fly all the way from Florida to Egypt .</br>  So just finished Part 7 since it's my first time reading through the series, and I wanted to ask people's opinion on what I should read next:<br><br> Go straight to Part 8  <br> Reread 1-3 since I only saw them through the anime <br> Read the two Part 4 spin offs </br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread 1 &amp;2 at least for all the parallels/references in 7.  Once you catch up to 8 u gotta w8 </br>  <br>part 3 is well adapted in the anime, no need to reread that one.</br>  <br>Including the parts where everyone randomly changes color pallets for no real reason?</br>  <br>In the color scans, yes<br>I'm pretty sure they're not the same colors at the same time as the anime but they're definitely there<br>Happens less as the part goes on the same way too</br></br></br>  <br> Including the parts where everyone randomly changes color pallets for no real reason? </br>  <br>read pt 1, 2, 3+pt 3 light novel<br>read the pt 4 light novels, and the kishibe rohan chapters<br>read purple haze feedback <br><br>there's also dead man's questions if you want more kira</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for no real reason </br>  <br>Trips are just triggers. The worst shit I've seen posted here, spamming from the archive, is done anonymously.</br>  <br>Best personality, 2nd best option is a dolphin autist</br>  <br>ishiggydiggy</br>   Narancia is a guy <br> Anasui is a guy <br>what the fuck</br></br>  Literally just finished reading Stone Ocean. I knew the gist of what was coming, so I don't really know what to think. But the fact that Emporio made it to the new universe, and it's implied that everyone that was alive on Earth at the end of the last one made it too, does that mean Josuke and Giorno are also in the new universe? Or does that get answered 5 minutes into SBR?  <br>Don't think too hard. Araki only made SBR part of JoJo after the switch to Ultra Jump 15 chapters in.</br>  <br>considering in part 5 it was one of the last things he thought of before he nearly died probably yeah</br>  <br> only made SBR part of JoJo after the switch to Ultra Jump 15 chapters in <br>But judging by the chapter titles, he introduces a Zeppeli in chapter 2, and a Joestar in chapter 3. How is it not immediately considered a part of JoJo?</br></br>  <br>Giorno and Rohan are "confirmed" alive in one of the light novels, but otherwise its never really stated one way or another.</br>  <br>If you look at the Weekly Shounen Jump covers, he never mentions JoJo at all.</br>  <br>SBR is a totally new universe<br>Ireneverse is just a slightly different original universe, basically part 6 never happened and everyone killed by Pucci was replaced by someone that's nearly identical, save for the name. Josuke and Giorno should still exist, too.</br></br>  <br>you mean Jorge Joestar? That's not canon.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vqR<wbr>RJrazaq0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Finally, an answer to the ''What would Jonathan say to Jotaro?''.<br><br>Looks really nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It technically can be since it doesn't directly affect the normal storyline in the manga</br>  <br>Hence the quotes. Though the explaination they give for Rohan still being a thing in the new universe isn't that much of a stretch imo.</br>  <br>Timestop is somewhat OP. They need to balance it by having you have to hit shit to build it up. As of right now you can literally just run away until it feels up and wait for your tag combo to build up then just stop time and use it for free.</br>  <br>Shit, you've truly got a point anon</br>  <br>Fuck it, we'll get it in EoH along with a new moveset</br>  <br>Peacoat. It's worn a lot in England.</br>  <br>You're an intense guy</br>  http://www.weather.com/science/natu<wbr>re/news/mutant-flowers-japan-fukush<wbr>ima-famous<br><br>Araki was right</br></br></wbr></wbr>   Good Grief <br>thats such a stupid catchphrase, what are you charlie brown or something asshole??</br>    <br>*raugh*</br>  <br>There's no exact translation for whatever Jotaro's catchphrase is.</br>  <br>Joseph really loves his grandson dearly</br>  <br><br>Magician's Red is the fucking strong</br></br>  <br>Shows what you know</br>  I love Gay Priest.  <br>Y'know, I always wondered what would happen if Diavolo erased Jotaro/Dio's time stop. It's not like it wouldn't happen if they fought considering how much Dio abuses it.</br>  <br>That's an illustration from 1994.</br>  <br>I know. That was the point.</br>  Ccould homura defeat dio?  <br>Is she a better girl than Narancia?</br>  Hot, cancerous OC<br>I'd be interested if they could pull something off that makes sense in EoH<br><br><br>So you finally got unbanned?</br></br></br></br>    <br>About as well as she could defeat Walpurgisnacht</br>  <br>Gay Priest will smite you.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Araki's art style really did go to shit at some point during part 4</br></br></br></br>  <br>Comsidering her powers are basically a combination of The World without the time limit and Killer Queen's Bites the Dust minus the explosions, topped off with a supply of ordinance large enough to make Dio's use of knives seem conservative, probably. Though really, in the end it boils down to which one of them figures out how to kill the other first. And on that front, Dio's far more clever than Homura.</br>  <br>The change was most noticeable in part 4 then others.</br>  <br>I like the new art style.</br>  <br> chew </br>  <br>This shit isn't even Duwang.</br>  <br>Josuke from the beginning of part 4 and Josuke at the end look so completely different that it's ridiculous</br>  <br>First time seeing the edit?</br>  <br>Yeah it's really weird. Looking at early josuke being just Jotaro with a pompadour to the last page with josuke stick his ass out in that gay pose.</br>  <br>No, but I still don't get why it exists.</br>  <br> implying Josuke isn't the most fabulous of all the JoJos </br>  <br>That ain't fucking Giorno.</br>  <br> Automatically assuming Giorno would be fabulous cause he's Italian. <br>Racist</br></br>  <br>Are all Italians really that fabulous? That's more posh English's alleyway.</br>  <br>Considering Fugo has the most disgusting stand in the series with it's flesh eating virus and he has that fucking hair I'd like to say the stereotype exists for a reason.</br>  <br>But he's half Japanese half English.</br>  <br>It's on batoto, there're still 11 volumes to be redone</br>  <br> josuke stick his ass out in that gay pose. <br>You mean best pose, right?</br></br>  <br>We're really limited by the speed of our translator and the speed at which some pages can be cleaned up and redrawn.</br>  <br>This entire picture is just terrible to look at with Josuke's gigantic left arm and his broken back.</br>  <br> that ass <br>Goddamn. People don't give Josuke enough credit. Among villains Pucci wins the ass game but among the jojos it's definitely Josuke.</br></br>  <br>So that's why Josuke never returned in parts 5 and 6</br>  <br>He looks fine in Part 8 ;)</br>  <br>I still love how that pose is his idle stance in All Star Battle, if I remember right</br>  <br>It's not. It's one of his taunts.</br>  <br>Naw, his idle pose is that similar pose with his hand on his hip.</br>  <br><br>With so many poses in JoJo I can't really be expected to remember all of them. I should at least remember the ones for best JoJo though.</br></br>  <br>Not him but it definitely is his idle stance. <br><br>It's similar enough to be called the same one.</br></br></br>   finally get ASB the other day <br> no part 4 or 6 costume for Jotaro <br> no Diego costume for Dio despite them doing voiced shit for SBR </br></br>  <br> no Diego costume for Dio despite them doing voiced shit for SBR <br>Except they only started doing voiced shit for Diego in EoH, which was announced two years after ASB was released.</br></br>  <br>THAT IS THE GROSSEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN OH JESUS CHRIST GET THAT SHIT AWAY FROM MY FUCKING FACE GOD FUCKING DAMN IT</br>  <br>diavolo has the worst idle stance in the game, everyone poses, making impressive stances, but diavolo just has an akward pose where he stands goofy, my favourite idle poses are kakyoin's or kosaku's</br>  <br>Nothing like a little radiation</br>  <br>I'm kinda glad there wasn't a Diego costume, myself. That alt Diego from the ending of Part 7 felt disgustingly shoehorned.<br><br><br>The only characters I think have really awkward idles are the pillar men, but the fact that i can't even remember what Diavolo's was should say a lot right there.<br><br>My favorite has always been Johnny's while he's on Slow Dancer though. I just like the way he hugs the horse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A Diego costume for Dio would be just as weird-looking as the football Doppio alt that Diavolo got, and having Diego suck blood and throw steamrollers around would be silly as fuck anyway.</br>  Here's a screenshot or two from the OP<br>It looks so fucking good with SVP and 1080p</br>  pretty good wallpaper material here  <br> SVP <br>Hmm?<br><br><br>That looks so good, I remember trying to edit a picture from the same scene and it was artifacted to shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a program that takes the usual 24-30 FPS and does some magic (ask /g/ about the details) and it smooths it out to a silky smooth 60FPS<br>Also yeah BDs are magic. Here's Polnareff being kawaii as fuck</br></br>  I think for Eyes of Heaven, they use the intros from the shows to help with the stages. Joestar Mansion is extremely well done. Camera doesn't freak out too much.  Even the episodes looks pretty good  <br>Link for this particular BD? Is this the newest volume of the Egypt arc?</br>  <br>The thing that worries me about Eyes of Heaven with the camera is I remember seeing footage of the Diego boss fight and the camera wasn't allowed to phase through walls unless it was clearly meant to be destructible, so the player kept getting corner fucked by dinos cause he couldn't see anything.</br>  <br>Some-Stuffs uploaded up to Volume 4 which ends at episode 16. It's all an Nyaa so far.</br>  What's the best translation for part 5?  <br>Yep, the camera in corners is really shitty. Especially if you're targeting a character and he gets you in a corner</br>  <br>Oh, I mistakenly thought the screenshots were of opening 2. I really want to see the Ndoul fight in glorious 1080p.</br>  Egypt Arc Blu-Rays when?  <br>You'll have to imagine what part 5's translation is actually like while reading it.<br><br>I'm not kidding.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in around 8-10 months?</br>  <br>You're gay for revealing that to me</br>  <br>You're overreacting, faggot</br>  <br> pretty good wallpaper material here <br> jpg </br></br>  <br> no Mista </br>  <br>Post the other one</br>  Where do we see the photo of the stardust crusaders in part IV?  <br>Nowhere, it's in part 5.</br>  <br>That's in V. It's on chapter 2 or 3, when Koichi tells Jotaro that Giorno's a faggot.</br>  <br>Seeing tens of pages devoted SOLELY to this guy getting his shit stomped in infinite punishment while Johnny was pimping and posing with Lucy at his side in every dimension was hilarious.<br><br>The first time I felt the big bad was satisfyingly punished for their bullshit in Jojo.</br></br></br>  <br>What about all the other villains?</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I just read through part IV and I felt a little confused because i was under the misconception that the photo was in IV.</br></br>    <br> while Johnny was pimping and posing with Lucy at his side in every dimension <br>That shit was like a Leonardo DiCaprio film.</br></br>  <br>Any good ones of only Joseph?</br>  <br>Damn, I wasn't even specific and you still read my mind. I love you Doc.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>STOP IT THIS IS ONLY MAKING ME SUFFER. Seeing JoJo in this 3D art style just keeps remind me that we will never have another good jojo fighting game</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I noted specifically "big" bad.</br>  Which torrent has just the Opening and ED?  <br>Download the 2 at the bottom here NC (No Credit): https://mega.co.nz/#F!KtsWna7K!_aG6<wbr>-fpmLtBmx26hGAl2wQ<br><br><br>http://imgur.com/a/lvwAP</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Vol 2</br>  <br>still that's like 4mb for a single picture</br>  <br><br>Any torrent for the second arcs op and ed in 1080p?</br></br>  <br>BDs aren't out yet.<br><br><br> wanting low quality wallpapers </br></br></br></br>  <br>There are no Egypt arc BDs yet </br>  <br>Seriously? Fuck</br>  <br>Is it worth downloading right now? I wanna watch it so bad, but I heard that they're being redone in some fashion, or did I misinterpret that?</br>  <br>I'm talking about them. Was Diavolo's too excessive? Was's Kira's too light? Did Dio get enough punishment? Stuff like that.</br>  <br>How do these images correlate to "another good jojo fighting game"? ASB was shit and it was the only 3D game so far, until EoH. Unless you mean the PS2 games which I doubt.</br>  <br>We don't give Josuke credit because he's technically purer than Jonathan. Jonathan already engaged in depraved missionary style reproductive sex before his death.</br>  <br> missionary style reproductive sex <br>Don't forget that they held hands with the lights off during all that.</br></br>  We got another reference  <br>The 3D reminds me of ASB and EoH. It also makes me think of Guilty Gear Xrd which has amazing cel shaded graphics</br>  <br>That has to be a translation error. That's a stupidass snark.</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>He literally says SUTANDO</br>  jojo is not gay  <br>Welp, another smartass remark with not much water being held. At least it's better than gratuitous JoJo poses.</br>  <br>You finally understand</br>  <br>All that made me sad Johnny didn't get with Lucy.<br><br>All those dimensions depicting them together like they're the star couple of a film (or films) and Johnny is about to kick Valentine's ass first before running off with Lucy... and then Johnny calling her a goddess bwfore anyone else did and long before she even gets actual powers... and nothing comes of it.<br><br>I mean they're relationship isn't the most well explored thing in the world, but weakly explored relationships have never stopped a Joestar.</br></br></br></br></br>  Vanilla Nice is here now  <br> http://imgur.com/a/lvwAP <br>Those are great. Thank you.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon, at least Gappy and Yasuho have a well defined relationship with romance on the cards.</br>  <br>There's no point in being a Joestar if you're not going to live extremely fucking tragically. There is literally no Joestar that hasn't gone through massive shit.<br><br>Even Josefumi got minced with a potential murderer weirdo just to become another Joestar hybrid entirely. The MC of Part 8 got fucked before we even started the story.</br></br></br>  I've kinda been thinking, how fast should read the manga? I'm kinda worried about going too fast and burning myself out. <br>But then again, if I spread it out to far, I may start to lose interest.</br>  <br>Hey Doc I really like your idea of the JJL ending.</br>  <br>If you want more frame specific photos, then here you go: http://imgur.com/a/8vs5I<br><br>I don't know if anyone else caught this, but I found this near the beginning of the opening when Joseph swaps out with Jotaro, it only happens for a split second.</br></br></br>  <br>Read it as fast as possible. Do not make the mistake of artificially lengthening a manga for yourself.</br>  <br>Read at your own pace for everything and just power through Part 5.</br>  <br> powering through the shortest, and best part <br>I once took my time rereading Part 5  in three days.  It's a shame because the setting and JoJo are the best. Part 6 felt so gay without the VA team.</br></br>  <br>Why do people still post the poorly made and obviously inferior version of art style comparions? Jesus<br><br><br>Don't listen to this faggot <br> about rushing through part 5, it's only going to worsen your experience. <br><br>Also from my personal experience I read the entire series in a month excluding part 7 and 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ok well my co-worker told me to start watching this show, is it any good? Whats the difference between 1993, 2000 and 2012 on kissanime or do i start somewhere else  <br>Hamon</br>  <br>Both Dios (P7 Dio counts as well though he's more of an "extra boss") Kars, and Pucci were all "scraping by" wins. No sense of conquering the villain, just that the heroes managed to survive (or some of them anyway). Kira was little better, though thedeath blow was a little anticlimactic.<br><br>I've haven't finished 5 yet because the retranslation, I forgot mention. However going over most of Jojo so far still, Valentine's "punishment" before was the most satisfying. He utterly lost without being killed and subject to a kind of eternal torment in which he lost over and over and over again to Johnny. And it's his fault because he kept trying to drag his other world selves into his mess. All he could do was either accept death or try to dupe Johnny. Johhny dominated that one.</br></br></br>  <br>Most people say download 2012 &gt; Stardust then read the rest of the manga on Batoto.</br>  <br>I have a cap so i cant download. Also can you compare it to another show or describe it, i feel like im getting into junjou romantica or some shit</br>  <br>he wasn't subjugated to eternal torment, it was more that he evaded death over and over again with D4C, and each time returning to the ground in futility, he had the choice to let go, give up and die, unlike diavolo who has no say in the matter regarding his own fate</br>  <br>What exactly about artificially lengthening it makes it a mistake?<br>If I blaze through it, I'll probably end up remembering less.</br></br>  <br>Lost time for no fucking reason. And it's not like you CAN reread later, you WILL reread later. There's no reason not to enjoy the ride now uninterrupted.</br>  <br>What was his idea?</br>  <br>When Broly-subs hurries up with the Jorge Joestar translation</br>  <br>A 'bizarre' story about the jojos family line with powers and shit. It's not always about one person. With spoiling much, the first part starts off with a "Mask" and after that, you don't know what is going to happen next.</br>    <br>Note that this is a rough idea, I may have missed out of some things..</br>  doc you're a fucking piece of shit you know that i fucking hate you  <br>Strangely enough those butterflies do nothing to me, but those flowers, oh man those fucking flowers. I'm still upset</br>  <br>That's what I said about giving up and die. That partly made it satisfying because making the vaillain choose between the torment and making himself die is bliss. Add that on top of basically making himself lose in every dimension he tried to pick another Valentine off and increasing Johnny's win counter dimensions-wide with a surprisingly good chunk of pages depicting just that made it an entertaining read.<br><br>Of course he went back to negotiate, but leaving the vaillain with just those options is a lot of salt in the wound. And luckily Jonathan isn't as gullable as old Jonathan.</br></br></br>  <br> No Joshuu </br>  <br>He probably dies</br>  <br>How about this?</br>  <br>Eh, I really don't feel like Jobin will be the real big bad. Part 8 is similar to 4 in that the villains up until now have all allied themselves with Josuke, or at least been neutralized (Norisuke, Tsurugi, Karera). <br><br>The split thing would be ultra cool though. CD vs KQ again.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't wish it on anybody but nah, sorry mate. It's the flowers.</br>  3&gt;4&gt;1&gt;2&gt;7&gt;5&gt;6  <br>Each part is different enough that they're almost different manga. Typically different genre. So, at absolute fastest, I would read 1 Part of JoJo per sitting. Read each Part like it was a different manga, whatever speed is comfortable to you.<br><br>Don't read the whole thing in a couple of days, it's a crapton of information and clashing genres to digest. You can appreciate each part on its own merits as long as you aren't actively comparing them like they happened hours from each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Switch 1 &amp; 2 and we're golden.</br>  <br>Pretty nice find, I've never heard of anyone else catching this.</br>  <br> You can appreciate each part on its own merits as long as you aren't actively comparing them like they happened hours from each other. <br><br>Seconded.</br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;5&gt;1</br>  <br>Polnaref looks like a transexual prostitute<br><br>What the hell is with the change of art style any way? Did he ever answer questions about it?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>4 &gt; 7 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 5 &gt;1<br><br>8 will probably be pretty high on the list but we gotta see how it finishes.</br></br></br></br></br>  What would Johnathan said to his ascendants?  <br>who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>Not really feeling it. Josefumi definitely didn't have Crazy Diamond, and he and Kira were not enemies either. We've known that Kira was allies with the other guy ever since I Am A Rock. Also the entire idea of the main character splitting into two different characters we have no attachment to is something that goes completely against what Araki seems to be building up here.<br><br>Also<br> meme arrows outside of image boards </br></br></br></br>  <br>whose the girl in the pic?</br>  <br><br>The one character that came out looking better in Araki's new style is Iggy.</br></br>  <br>Part 1 is Hokuto no Ken with vampires.<br>Part 2 is like part 1 with super vampires, posing, and fabulousness.<br>Part 3 throws out martial arts in favor of punch ghosts. Plot is basically Around the World in 80 days, except everything weird is the work of an enemy Stand.<br>Part 4 is a sight-seeing trip in the beautiful town of Duwang. Also there's a serial killer.<br>Part 5 is about a faggot Italian that's not even a real JoJo trying to become a gang star.<br>Part 6 is about a grill fighting a gay priest in prison, then the universe asplodes.<br>I haven't read parts 7 and 8 yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  wait a minute that bulge  <br>I thought it was pretty cool but your points are pretty solid too.</br>  <br> Johnnathan <br>You've done my lineage proud, you are a true gentleman<br><br> Joseph <br>You are a tricky one but please grow to be strong<br><br> Oldseph <br>You are strong now<br><br> Jotaro <br>One day you will be socially developed so please give the dolphin photos a rest<br><br> Josuke <br>Peculiar hairstyle, don't you think it's a bit ahead of its time?<br><br> Giorno <br>You are my true heir<br><br> Jolyne <br>You are gay</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, I don't mean to shoot it down too hard or anything, because speculation is always fun and discussing theories is really the most worthwhile thing these threads can be used for at the moment.</br>  You now remember  <br>I never forgot. Dude was hella useful and strong (to the point that Hol and J. Geil were worried about him), knew damn near every stand, it's user, and what they could do, and was only there because he was a good guy who thought evil shouldn't be allowed to win. Like, everyone else was there for pride or personal shit, but he was there because it was the right thing to do.</br>  <br>7&gt;5&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;6<br><br>It's not a bad opinion</br></br></br>  <br>What about Kak? He was just as righteous as Avdol, and this is coming from an Avdol fanboy.</br>  <br>Shame he was allergic to vanilla ice cream.</br>  <br>johnathan would talk to himself?<br>nigger are you high?</br></br>  <br>I want to protect Josuke's smile.</br>  <br>He put two n's so I assume he's referring to Johnny</br>  <br>I don't see how anyone could not pick SBR as best</br>  <br>He was there because he was saved from being manipulated by DIO, because he had given into his fear before and wished to right that, for Holly's smile, and because he had finally found friends who understood him. I thought Avdol's cause was more pure.</br>  Did Josuke have the birthmark?<br><br> The maid has one but Kira does not.<br>Josefumi does have one too despite being a Kujo so how do those work now?<br>I mean, it's not like it only goes to one person in the bloodline if you consider just about every of Dio/Jonathan's kids has one too.</br></br> </br></br>  Just watched Stardust Crusaders after Battle Tendency. Senile, old Joseph is the best.  I'm curious, any of you guys want to commentate with me Sunday for the HFtF tournament?

Whether or not they think she's your 'fap slut' is irrelevent.</br></br>  Requesting Sakurako and Himawari from Yuru Yuri in another of their little fights, with both in swimsuits (artists choice from ref sheet), with Sakurako leaning forward a bit and wearing a smug-ass grin, having just shoved Himawari down front-first into an oversized wet dessert cream pie, with Himawari looking surprised/humiliated/shocked and soaked swimsuit and all in the pie cream.  <br>Enough for me, sure. But she'll just end up as a topic for shit-posting and will be black listed in-so-much that just mentioning her will cause an uproar.<br>Everytime I see marikafag post, there's "Horse fucker" stuff, and "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. I wouldn't be able to deal with it if that happened to me and my waifu.</br></br>  <br>Well, then, start off with simple requests. Her drinking tea, or looking out at the sunset on the beach, or wearing so and so clothes or some shit.<br>Then maybe after two weeks or three, you can move up and start to request other things.</br></br>  <br>Just don't request waifus in the general then. Pick a pair of characters that are in the relationship, and request them.</br>  <br>Ignore other fuckers. If she's your waifu, then she's your waifu. Others can try to judge you, but only you can say what she means to you.</br>  <br>I've been requesting for months. That's how i know it won't stop them.<br><br>I don't just want this because I want fap material. Ideally, it would be an erotic image of my waifu.<br><br>Thanks you. And I agree, but it'd still suck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No way your waifu would lay a finger on my waifu, she'd be on the floor in a blink of an eye.</br>  <br>Then have the balls to request your waifu, instead of asking for a random one.<br> Requesting waifu masturbating. <br> Who is your waifu? <br> Not telling, since it would make me look bad, but a random other person getting a picture of his waifu masturbating, posted in this thread for everyone to see, is completely fine! Even if he wouldn't want one! <br>Put some fucking thought into this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't thinking. Please forgive me. I'll stop now.</br>  <br>If you truly cared about any of this then you would commission lewds of her so no one else can see.<br><br>And you're Tsuyufag, aren't you?</br></br></br>  so whenever i browse WWD for requests to draw<br>there bound to be someone who just say "nobody's gona draw her" or somthin similar<br>so then i ask who's your waifu and they just didn't reply<br><br>what is wrong with you guys?<br>you want your waifu drawn then fucking say it out loud ffs</br></br></br></br></br>   boa was drawing waifus  <br> didn't get to request mine <br><br>goddamn it.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's that people are willing to wait patiently to have her drawn, but will bemoan the chance that it might not happen before the end of Sunday.<br>That's how I see it. They're too proud to beg desperately for it, and are more than willing to request and wait.</br></br>  <br>I now have a relaxing weekend because of it<br> I'll be frantically following WonFes anyway </br></br>  <br> 2shy2beg <br>hmmm guess i didn't think about it this way<br>thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>Asking directly makes you look desperate for drawings. Some people would rather wait for a drawfag to pick up the request. Some jump on every occasion for a drawing/collage, and in a long run make themselves look like a greedy scum.</br>  <br>No.  I'm Nononfag. </br>  <br>People are going to complain that their waifu isn't going to be drawn, but it's part of board culture not to vulture artists, even if you directly ask them.</br>  <br>See? That wasn't so hard. If you want lewds, the only way to do it while still looking like a true waifufag is to commission.</br>  <br>But there's like three dudes in there.</br>  <br>Even better!</br>  <br>What do you want them to do? Finger their assholes? I doubt their husbandofags want them jerking it.</br>  <br>Huh, thanks for using my drawing for the OP image, didn't notice till now.</br>  Requesting this concept art of cyborg Hakodate Omiko doing something cool. Maybe something One-Punch Man related?  <br> They're too proud to beg desperately for it <br>I think it's more that they don't want to be seen as greedy or vulturing or whatever</br></br>  Requesting barefoot ryouna  <br>Thanks for drawing Rukia, Boa-sama. Even though my reply is really late.</br>  <br>not eating a cactus?</br>  <br>barefoot ryouna eating a cactus using her feet</br>  <br><br>Collages are fine. Everyone even settled with the "rerequesting after a collage" Thing.<br><br>Also, its not vulturing if drawfag specifically asks for waifus to draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I know this feeling, anon. I've had my waifu for many years now, there's no way I could say I don't fap to her.<br>But requesting lewds in here? that's something I'm hesitant about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, I wouldn't rerequest after getting a collage delivery.<br>Unless someone was saying they'd take requests for a different collage, because that would likely take a few weekends to get delivered.</br></br>  Requesting BurningGreymon.  <br>Requesting a barbed noose around your neck.</br>  <br> "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. <br>I don't really see that happen outside of shitposters whining in the general. Horse stuff for Marikafag, sure, but nothing for Koborifag.</br></br>  Requesting Sawyer by a table, with a cup of coffee/chocolate, a sandwich, and reading a magazine.  <br>koborifag is just trying to shitpost himself, don't mind it</br>  <br>Okay, now I've seen this. I'm not even sure that this even happens most of the time.</br>  <br>Does koborifag even love kobori? I mean, does he even know of her character song?</br>  <br>You could say the same for a lot of other waifufags.</br>  <br>I'm glad some waifufags actually know shit about their waifu and not just imagine every single thing about them like they're fucking OCs.</br>  <br>I wonder if any of the other Bleachfags know about the concept covers? I'm a bit envious of them, since they get to hear their waifus sing.</br>  <br> tfw your waifu is so fucking good at singing <br>Feels good man.</br></br>  Take it to /ghost/. This is not a waifu thread.  <br>Can confirm. Listening to your waifu sing is the one of the best feelings in the world.</br>  Requesting Tomoko riding a dinosaur.  <br>Does Yuunafag even love Yuuna? I mean, does he even know that she's a lesbian?</br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute frilly swimsuits kissing underwater like the scene from Sakura Trick  <br><br><br>Can't beat this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ICw<wbr>3HU0K5Ww</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Requesting Tomoko being RIDDEN by a dinosaur   sexually </br>    Requesting Akaza Akari drinking water to stay hydrated during this hot summer.  <br>First they came for Oorafag, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>Because I was not a meme.<br>Then they came for Marikafag, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>Because I was not a lewdfag.<br>Then they came for Koborifag, and I did not speak out‚Äî<br>Because I was not greedy.<br><br>Then they came for me ‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.<br><br>Moral of this story is when you see someone getting shitposted, instead of being glad it's not you, you should tell the shitposters to get fucked. You can take back the thread from the three or four asshurt terrorist babies who do this if you just try.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could just refrain from being a spergy faggot altogether.</br>  <br>Depends on the rules for the fight.</br>  <br> Then they came for Marikafag,  <br>I wish.</br></br>  <br>Or just you know, don't be a faggot and no one will shitpost you.</br>  <br>If you don't say anything wrong no one will shitpost about you.<br>In the end, its all about how you act around people.</br></br>  <br>I might do another one of this later that isn't a sketch.</br>  Requesting a two-panel comic with carol (giant hat) saying<br> My dad is fucking dead! <br>and Hibiki responding with<br> At least your dad loves you! </br></br></br>  <br>Sweet Burninggreymon</br>  <br>But I always reply with my waifu every time.</br>  Requesting Adlet licking Fremy‚Äôs navel.  <br><br>Yeah no. Everyone who does anything besides request and never post again gets shitposted. Drawfags, people who socialize in the threads, people who thank excessively, fucking everyone who anyone can actually identify gets sperged on constantly.<br><br>Needs to stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you want to identify yourself to other people so badly you shouldn't be on an anonymous imageboard.</br>  Requesting this with Natsuru<br>thighhighs_pull<br>underwear<br>nipples</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care whether people know me or not, but I'm not going to cower in fear of a bunch of crying faggots who love being anonymous because they can shitpost all day and all night without consequence. <br><br>If I want to talk to someone to tell them they did a good job or that I missed them or that they missed a delivery, and I want to let them know who's talking to them, I should be able to do that without being called an avatarfag or a tripfag or a spergy faggot for literally no other reason except people knowing who I am for one post.</br></br></br>  Requesting Nadeko playing jenga but cheating with her snake hair  <br>It almost sounds like you give a fuck what other people say. So what if you tripfag and people have a problem with it? There is a little something called ignoring it. If you cant handle a little internet bullying for doing something you want to do then you shouldn't be on 4chan</br>  <br>And I don't care if you want to do all that somewhere else. The only time you should be identifying yourself in these threads are when you are either requesting or thanking. Again, if being recognized by people is so important to you, perhaps you shouldn't be on 4chan.</br>  <br>Oora! is not a waifu, it is a meme.</br>  <br>That's great, but Oora isn't my waifu.</br>  <br>RIP mishafag.</br>  <br>You still aren't even close.</br>  <br>You can request, fuck off, and be one of the most invisible people in the thread. However, that's not stopping drawfag from shitposting you through drawings. You can't win in these threads.</br>  <br>Working on it</br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br>Mimi</br>  <br>moar like meme am I right</br>  <br>yeah so <br><br>The people who aren't shitposting retards<br>Or shitposting retard drawfags<br>Who actually love their waifus<br>And wouldn't want to be shitposted if someone found out who their waifu was<br><br>Need to gangrape the people who shitpost when it happens<br><br>Tamafag did nothing wrong except color waifus and be friendly<br>Yuunafag did nothing wrong except do pixels and be friendly<br>Koborifag did nothing wrong except writefag and be friendly<br><br>And they get shit on nonstop while these retards who shitpost them hide and shitpost and then pretend to thank the drawfags who draw for them while secretly hating them<br><br>All it would take is people telling them to get fucked when it happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>Just drop it.</br>  <br> Wake up <br> see this  <br>That's looking delicious! Thanks for picking it up!</br></br></br>  <br>You think that drawfag threads are an exception or something? That happens in every thread on pretty much every board. If you can do something that someone else can not they will most likely shit post you for being better than they are. What you really need to do it grow up and learn to ignore things you do not like, instead of having this big cry about your waifu not getting drawn by anon because he gives too much of a fuck about what other people think.</br>  <br>If you actually cared about those people, stop attracting attention to them.</br>  Also good morning! Requesting eggs and bacon for breakfast!  <br>I included a sausage because I thought you might like it.</br>  <br>Where da ketchup at?</br>  <br>Haha! Delicious indeed!

How can I put it any other way?</br>  <br>Get your mind out of the gutter, sir.  But... </br>  <br> I want them living happily a long life together <br>That usually involves the two of them boning the daylights out of each other</br></br>  <br>Untitledfag saves the thread yet again.</br>  <br>If it means having a family together then that's just par for the course.</br>  <br>what great timing, i just woke up 10 minutes ago.<br>thanks, its amazing.</br></br>  <br>That is fucking rad. 10/10 delivery.</br>  <br>Your stuff is always nice.</br>  Requesting Towa (Cure Scarlet in civilian form) being served tea by pafu in her cute human form.<br><br>Or anything of Cure Scarlet. She has the most awesome henshin of all precure so far<br>https://<span>youtu.be/uayY9-k-LGE  [ ]<br><br><br>Cool as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  eh, really sleepy, just leave it like this, supposed to add more characters but got bored and tired now<br>Not a direct request, just some request threads ago regarding currently airing anime</br>  <br>Too lewd Viper. I love your stuff.</br>  <br>That's lewd, dude. LEWD! <br><br>I love it</br></br></br>  <br>DAMN<br>Noice</br></br>  <br>Very awesome Viper.  Anyways, how's the Ryouna request going? </br>  <br><br> Maximum Overlewd </br></br>  Goddamn, I've been drawing hairstyles for over 3 months now and i'm still having trouble with this shit. This was something I drew a few minutes ago. I don't get what I'm doing wrong. These particular examples I did here, I tried to do more "anime" bangs, using my anime figs as reference, but for the past couple of months it's all been off 3D examples.<br><br>Every tutorial I've read doesn't tell me how to divide up the section with the bangs and the back of the hair, or how the hair should flow or how I should draw my lines. At this point, I thought I got it but now I'm just damn confused. <br><br>I don't wanna ask /ic/ either because they can be a bunch of biggoted assholes who tell me to stop drawing Chinese cartoons just because they hate it.<br><br>I'm just ridiculously discouraged right now and considering quitting hair tomorrow temporarily and moving onto eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting color<br>http://i.imgur.com/kUnhDdt.jpg</br>  <br>those look fine to me. but then again, its not like im a animu hair drawing expert either</br>  <br>really nice! dem bullets and posing are really well-done.<br><br><br>l-lewd!<br><br><br>e-eh, i hope this helps, i think it would help if you partition the hair into strands of approximately same width. hair also tend to curve inwards to face the cheeks, anime figs don't help much but looking at how other illustrators draw helps a lot in learning how to draw animu imo.<br><br>artists like nardack and kurehito draw the hair very nicely and maybe you can take some reference from them:<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4687727<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4691729</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you can't even name all those waifus.</br>  <br><br><br>I feel like I've seen these exact two posts before, a month or two ago</br></br></br>  <br>you need to think in volumes, try to feel the 3d form and let the lines flow along with it. Go from big and blocky to small and detailed.</br>  <br>i just drew it and composed that post about 10 minutes ago though, yeah, the guy's asking for help is prolly the same from few months back<br><br><br><br>he explained it better, actually and this one's the proper way to draw hair</br></br></br></br></br>  Feeling like taking Bakemonogatari, or Desu Note requests  <br> you will never have something this awesome draw for you </br>  <br>I have, several times.</br>  <br>Requesting Black Hanekawa in a revealing China dress</br>  <br>Untitled-san is my waifu.</br>    <br>well fuck you</br>  Requesting Nakiri Erina in Prinz Eugen clothes and Prinz Eugen in Erina's clothes, please  <br>aight will do</br>  I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  <br>Be sure to have side slits to show off those juicy thighs</br>  Requesting some cirno, either playing a guitar or using a camera  <br><br><br>Yeah it's me. Here's a picture of my progress. I believe I have made progress, but recently I've been sorta plateau-ing, which is something I definately do not want. I feel like I get the hair at some points but sometimes I don't. It's sorta weird. Would you guys say I'm on the right path? Would it be good for me to take a break from hair for now and try drawing other stuff?</br></br></br>  I honestly don't understand the wank over Heaven's Feel, why is it considered the best route?  I'm enjoying the horror aspects of it.  <br> best shirou <br> best sakura <br> best saber <br> best kirei <br> best illya <br> best rider <br> zouken <br> best fights <br> cooking <br>Is it really that hard to understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because Ilya. Sakura is only a plot device. so don't mind her too much  <br> best kotomine </br>  <br>You get to fuck Sakura.</br>  <br>Enjoy your worms</br>  <br>Because it focus the best girl(s), MC becomes a man, and has the canon couple</br>  <br> Ilya's role is literally infodumping and doing the good end <br> Sakura is a plot device while she isn't </br></br>  <br> extra stimulation when penetrating <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br>Dubs speak the truth.</br>  <br>I am tired of this discussion OP, you can do better but it's obvious you are just baiting. The route was just boring and full of info dumping.<br><br>Why don't you explain your reasoning as to why you don't understand the wank over HF?</br></br></br>  <br> why is it considered the best route? <br>It's not.<br><br>UBW &gt;= Fate &gt; HF</br></br></br></br>  <br>It has the most sex scenes.</br>  <br>UBW is the superior route. Shirou in that route is the core of what Shirou is. Fate is just weaksauce Shirou, HF is aberration Shirou.<br><br>Shirou is not a super hero in any route. Just a man living up to ideals that, no matter how impossible they may be, are so beautiful and precious to him that he can define his life by them, no matter how painful it might become because of that.<br><br>"I have no regrets, this is the only path." is not a declaration of weakness, but of understanding of what one desires at the very core of himself.<br><br>If anything, UBW Shirou is infinitely braver than HF Shirou, because HF Shirou gives up himself entirely to save another. He loses himself instantly and can live a happy-touchy life with Sakura afterwards. He trades his own values for something external, giving up on what he truly believed in.<br><br>UBW Shirou has committed himself to his ideal completely and will never waver. Even though he knows the outcome via Archer, he will walk a path of heartache regardless. He internalizes something pure at the cost of years of future pain, in order to embody that purity.<br><br>Which is braver? Giving yourself up completely for a future in which something good might come out of it or might result in horror, or committing yourself for a future that you know will be terrible and has no hope of reward except the fulfillment of your own ideal?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Saying that HF is the best route is like saying Cooking Mama is the pinnacle of gaming.  <br>This.</br>  <br>True.</br>    <br>It gets a pretty big boost from being the final route.</br>  <br>I have seen this before OP. But I thought we were talking about route quality not which Shirou you believe is the best.</br>  <br>What makes you think I'm OP?</br>    <br>Well my question was aimed at OP.</br>  <br><br>It's the only route that hasn't been "ruined" by an adaptation yet. Believe it or not /a/ is a bunch of hipsters.<br><br>UBW was best route before it got adapted. Then it became more accessible and they started hating it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The best characters get their time. Kotomine is a great antagonist and going fully into his ideals was a fitting contrast to Shirou's development. Ilya becoming your sister, Archer coming to terms with himself without being an edgelord villain, and befriending Rider were also great character moments.<br><br>Don't see how Ilya is just an infodump when the pivotal moment of the route happened because she calmed Shirou down and showed him he could love people enough to protect them.</br></br></br>  Because "best" still means pretty bad when it comes to Fate.   never posted in /a <br> just received Escaflowne vol. 1&amp;2 in the mail after watching the series when I was 15. <br><br>What are your thoughts</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>What made HF my favorite was all the Kotomine, Zouken and Shirou interactions in it, and HF has my favorite fights.</br>  <br> Archer coming to terms with himself without being an edgelord villain, and befriending Rider were also great character moments. <br>This is so wrong, Rider didn't get shit because muh Sakura and Archer doesn't get any answer same as Saber.</br></br>  <br>No dolphins  I hope. </br>  <br>Honestly I rather have a pretty good adaptation for my favorite route than /a/'s shitty hipster fanbase liking it.</br>  <br> /a <br>Ayy</br></br>  A friendly reminder HF is canon while UBW and Fate aren't. As canon as a nasuverse could be.  <br> &gt;best shirou </br>  <br>It's not. It's mostly considered the 2nd best route (with UBW being considered the best, most of the time). That being said, its fans are the most vocal out of the three routes because:<br> So what if there's some cooking... THE CLIMAX OF HF IS AMAZING!! <br> Shirou may throw away his ideals for pussy but SO WHAT, IT'S THE MOST REALISTIC SHIROU OUT OF ALL OF THEM <br> STOP CALLING HER A WORMSLUT OK SHE'S BEST GIRL AND WAIFU MATERIAL <br> closest thing we get to an Ilya route <br> dat Sparks Liner High <br> dat Mind of Steel doe <br><br>Heaven's Feel fans are like that guy with a crappy job who pre-emptively tells everyone that he's only doing it until he gets something better, even if nobody even asked him about it in the first place. HF fans are so paranoid about people calling their route a sissified cooking show that they go out of their way to vocally remind everyone just how great HF really is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heaven's Feel just has bad writing in places. It has all the Servants except Rider and Archer either die off in one scene or get turned into the bad guys' muscle. They have no place in the storyline but must exist due to the overarching structure of F/SN, so they get clumsily swept aside.<br><br>It uses the shouen cliche of "the hero's power X has terrible side effects but he overpowers them with his determination" when Shirou says Projecting three more times will kill him, then goes on to Project five more times.<br><br>Other routes don't do anything about Sakura's situation. Because that situation didn't exist in them, as far as we knew. The few hints we do get only point to Sakura perhaps being more involved in the War than it seemed, not that she was being torture raped for years. It all comes entirely out of left field.<br><br>Speaking of Sakura, she pretty much devours the plot. After about 40% of the way through, pretty much everything everyone does is in relation to how it will affect Sakura. She has the super sad backstory that feels so artificially designed to generate sympathy. She's so incredibly powerful she can take out Servants with no trouble, she's a Holy Grail despite all previous indications that the Einzberns were the ones who knew how to do that, etc.<br><br>HF feels like someone read the first two routes then wrote a fanfic with that tertiary character Sakura as their self-insert Mary Sue, ramping up the dark, horror elements because suffering=depth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even an HFfag but I do love me some Sparks. Easily the best ending in HF.</br>  <br>HF Shirou sees beyond his childish ideals and get a grasp of what means being a real human.</br>  <br> A friendly reminder HF is canon <br>It's almost canon.</br></br>  <br> HFs fanbase in a nutshell <br>Nice summary.</br></br>  <br>I think you should kill yourself.</br>  How much longer until Grand Order is out?  <br>Nice trips, I wasn't expecting to get a good response. I pretty much agree with all your points.</br>  <br>Agreed. Also, does anyone know the name of the song/OST that plays during the Sparks Liner High fight?</br>  <br>Mighty Wind.</br>  <br>Mighty wind.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/G9NSQIV15uI  [ ]<br>https://<span>youtu.be/t51TB9lXxDs  [ ]</br></br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G9N<wbr>SQIV15uI</wbr>  [ ]<br>What?</br></br>  3 reasons.<br>First and greatest reason is Ilya.<br>Second is that there isn't as much Shirou wanking<br>Third is the final fight.</br></br></br>  <br> he played the inferior version <br>Nigga you missed out.</br></br>  <br>It is there's just different versions of the same one remixed.</br>  <br><br><br><br>For fuck's sake... no it's not. I'm talking about this tune: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1EUPaxCW1mD</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ilya and Kotomine get actual screentime.<br>Shirou becomes GAR as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Clashing Souls?</br>  <br>Well I honestly like UBW more but from a serious note with the Grail War being the focus, I can see why HF can be called best route.<br><br> best Kotomine <br> Illya ;_; <br> best fights <br><br>But then again<br> some really badass servants get offed right at the beginning <br> all the fucking cooking <br> hf shirou </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HF was the only time I could actually stand Shirou.</br>  <br>Are you talking about the one after mighty wind?</br>  <br>At least Gil wasn't the big villain this time.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>OK NEVER MIND I FOUND IT: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XIY<wbr>g1FwgacU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop self inserting.</br>  <br>Yeah, I really wouldn't say he's best Shirou. I feel like that belongs to UBW Shirou. <br><br>I felt that HF Shirou was an interesting take on his character though. Throwing away his ideal to save everyone for just a single person.</br></br></br>   <br>Oh I see, you played the non-Realta Nua version.</br>  <br>I only self-insert into Shiki.<br>Intelligent, Nihilistic, with a wicked sense of humor.</br></br>  <br>Fucking hell, just watch this and skip to 22:25<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=znm<wbr>ECWz-8MI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> not self-inserting as Shiki <br>Shiki is pleb-tier, Shiki is much better.</br></br>    <br>Bait for ants.</br>  Why didn't they include Whirlpool of Fate in the anime?  <br>I prefer the Gae Bait. Also, has anyone made the Mystic Shitpost of Bait Perception? Seems like it could be a nice one.</br>  <br> Let alone flesh and blood, Mystic Eyes of Death Perception is even effective against Spiritual Bodies. </br>  <br>I'd recommend this instead of the Youtube ones.<br>http://fsn.seorinwastaken.com/index<wbr>.php?v=166</wbr></br></br>  <br>Here we go.</br>  <br>I picked it because it was quick, and his question was mostly audio related anyway.</br>  <br> pshh... nothin' personnel, Herakles </br>  <br><br>This is some hardcore Nasu fanfic.</br></br>  At first I thought they changed her design so they can animate her better. <br><br>But her scenes are badly animated anyways so what was the point?</br></br>  I understand they had to cut up this scene but it felt odd with it missing a bunch of parts.<br><br>How are they going to explain the Prince's scenes if they cut out all the rape?</br></br>  I sure like that in the anime nobody even reacted to the tiny loli throwing a giant axe so hard it made the big bad dragon flinch.  <br> her scenes are badly animated <br>what<br>Also she just look better anyway</br></br></br>  <br>In the LN</br>  So in 30 years Rory becomes a goddess?

He got his shit pushed in by one of Frieza's mooks.  <br><br>No, the reason imperfect cell was able to slap his shit while he was fighting 17 was because he'd eaten like another city's worth of people.</br></br>  He's waiting for another Deus Ex Machina ala "NAMEKIANS CAN DO THIS" in order to be relevant again (See: Permanent Synch, Limb Regeneration).  <br>At minimum, he's above Goten &amp; Kid Trunks. Super Buu got Piccolo's outfit when Gotenks' fusion ran out.</br>  <br>However strong he needs to be to job effectively to the current villain.</br>  Which is better and why?    I never got around to watching Evangelion, but Escaflowne was the first subbed anime I watched, and to this date is still my favourite take on fantasy settings.<br><br>Evangelion... I'm not really sure why I have put it off this long, but with all the remakes of the same series, it's seeming a bit silly. I'd just want to watch the original series from the 90s.</br></br>  <br>Rahxephon</br>  <br>Infinite Ryvius</br>  <br>I'd put NGE off for years but I'm finally watching it now, it's great just do it.</br>  <br>wow, what shitty bait<br>Of course evangelion is better you fucking faggot</br></br>  <br>Escaflowne. While I did love eva it really didnt age well. I can go back to Escaflowne and still enjoy it</br>  <br>if you haven't watched evangelion you need to leave<br><br>maybe go blog on mal or something okay?</br></br></br>    Escaflowne is pretty shit entry level anime. But it will be seem good once you start watching more anime  <br>This doesn't make sense</br>  I enjoyed watching Escaflowne much more than I did watching Eva, but the ending was kind of limp. If only there were a few more episodes to give that ending a little more weight, it would be a real masterpiece. As it is, it's just a really good show, one that I look forward to revisiting in a year or so.  <br>The one that has the penguin</br>  <br> threads talk more about NGE than the actual show <br>No, and the fans know it.</br></br>  MC was a fucking slut  <br>Escaflowne was much more consistent in its quality but Evangelion had more memorable highs.<br>Evangelion also had better visual design.</br></br>  <br>I disagree <br><br>they both look pretty impressive</br></br></br>  <br>NGE because it has MAI WAIFU</br>   Escaflowne thread <br> people not posting glorious Escaflowne <br><br>step it up /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Zegapain</br>  <br>aldnoah 0 is the best anime ever made.
