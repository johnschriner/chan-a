[ Is there any raws released for vol.9?  <br>sorry</br>  <br>That's so edgy.</br>  <br>Please more Spoilers.</br>  maps  <br>Finally.</br>  So Overlord is just the shitty SAO version of how to become a Demon Lord for dummies?  <br>Where is Mr. Bone's rape den?</br>  <br>Is there manga/ LN which feels like this picture? I mean some grim Warhammer ripoff. I'd love to read that.</br>  <br>Cause I read synopsis and this one is just another trapped in a game story.</br>   First editions of the DVD and Blu-ray Disc will also include: a box with illustrations by original character designer so-bin, a digipack with illustration by anime character designer Takahiro Yoshimatsu, a case featuring illustrations by so-bin on three sides, a leaflet, and a character card.  <br> a box with illustrations by original character designer so-bin <br> a case featuring illustrations by so-bin on three sides <br><br><br>Not this again anon, the game is gone, dead. The world is real, totally different from game world. And the people are real, they don't know jack shit about the game or anything "game" related. Only that this world has some similarity with the game about magic, skill, items, etc. But generally people in this world are at a very low level compared to the old game world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for nothing. I got what you wrote from the synopsis. My question still stands. Is there something like Japanese Warhammer?</br>  <br><br>Thanks for sharing.<br>Is there anything else from vol.9?</br></br></br>  <br>Nearest would be Gate.</br>  <br>Ah please wait.</br>  <br> I got what you wrote from the synopsis. <br> I read synopsis and this one is just another trapped in a game story. <br>Really now.<br><br>Anyway, sorry but right now I can't recall reading any LN/manga like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's the same type of "trapped in the game" like in LH.</br>  <br>No Log Horizon is a fusion of the real world and the game world and there are game mechanics everywhere<br><br>Overlord world only has two carryovers from the game in the form of the magic system and the magical relics and both of those are because players show up at different times and the group that appeared thousands of years ago dickslapped everything into submission.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Overlord a game turned into a genuine fantasy world?</br>  <br>It's more like DnD, the most "game-esque" thing is how the players/ex-game entities can rank/scale entities to see their approximate details with magic (which you can guard against/falsify info by using defensive magic/skills).<br><br>The normal inhabitants have no idea they even have levels or classes, they just "train" them without knowing it, or so I believe. Hence the roundabout way to gauge the strength by magic tiers and adventurer classes.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no turning<br><br>It straight up pulled Ainz and his guild to a completely different pre-existing fantasy world that pretty much follows d&amp;d rules.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh that makes much more sense.<br>I guess I'll pick it up. Shit's already reminding me of the glorious lovechild of Overlord and Dungeon Keeper.</br></br>  <br>It's D&amp;Dland.</br>  <br>You can try to read the manga if you don't want to invest on the novel for quick look on how the first volume pans out.<br><br>But the novel is heaps and bounds better and does the world/character introduction with more care.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread needs something to discuss so until someone dumps the early screening info so<br><br>What plot points do you want to see in the future?<br><br>Personally I hope we get Black Scripture finding out about Momon and attempting to seal him as a demon god.</br></br></br></br>  does Ainz ever figure out what the "sheep" really are?  <br>Anything by Theocracy, especially their human/dragon crossbeed "special seat". Maybe flesh out the Emprie &amp; other nations better.</br>  <br>Personally I hope the author didn't waste all that shit on the lizard men.</br>  <br><br>Characters that are on par with the Nazarick's denizen so we can see more interesting battles and not just plain curb stomping. Maybe a full scale war now that Ainz has his own nation. <br><br>Maybe see the return of a former guild mate as an enemy. And Albedo going into a frenzy trying to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the curb stomping when it's nicely done and not just over with one move. But yeah, hopefully the Dragon Lords and Dragon King know how to put up a decent fight in future.</br>  <br><br>Personally I'm hoping we see something like the Theocracy ends up going balls to the walls crazy and uses high level res magic to bring back their old heroes or releasing the stuff they sealed away hundreds of years ago to fight Ainz. For all we know they might have stuff like the Seraphim Ainz referenced as a last resort against demon gods.</br></br>  <br>yes, he even thought of it as a subspecies of what it was</br>  Wasn't there supposed to be some sort of pre-screening yesterday?  <br><br>Yes, let's hope the episode gets uploaded somewhere.</br></br>  <br>With the release of 9th vol I believe. It's not like we can expect cam record rip of 1st ep.</br>  <br>Want</br>  Caught up to the drama CD. Albedos abs of steel edition.  <br>I'm more curious about the default stats of the breeds.<br>Who knows they are on par with the Plediaes.</br></br>  <br>Her thighs must be equally hardy then.</br>  <br>Mmmm, my kind of woman</br>  More spoilers when?  <br>It's always spoilers with you guys. Can't you just have some patients and wait for the story to develop?</br>  8 days to go  <br> waiting 1 year for tls <br>Nope.With spoilers i will enjoy it more when i read it aniway.</br></br>  <br><br>Ready to be spodisappointed?</br></br>  <br>Like you have anything better to do<br><br><br>I'm going to watch it and enjoy it and there's nothing you can do to stop me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's nothing you can do to stop me. <br><br>I don't want to, I-I'm also going to enjoy it too!</br></br></br>  <br>We'll try our best, just like the VA's wished!</br>  Are there pictures of two Ainz Ooal Gown members like Volume 8, or just one?  So as it turns out, the prologue picks up on where Volume 7 left off.<br><br>Aura and Mare with the Emperor.</br></br>  <br>I-i have!Like fapping or.....fapping?</br>  There are spoiler pictures on Baidu, if anyone cares for them.  <br>That's Re: Monster</br>  <br><br>Fapping,  with both hands. </br></br>  <br>Link pls.Are they the ones already posted here?</br>      <br>Goblins putting in work.</br>  <br><br>Well fuck, humans are really weak in this world.</br></br>  I'm fairly sure that there should be one more chapter, but no picture for it was uploaded.  I have no idea what's going on this picture.  I'm assuming that the postscript picture is Ivileye.  <br>They really grow soft in those big walled cities of theirs, only fighting at best against other humans.</br>  <br> you will never be a goblin serving under a qt goblin general </br>  <br>Ainz's Super-Level Spell - La Shub-Niggurath<br><br>  Summons a black cyclone and kills everything in the area. The victims are sacrificed to summon monsters over level 90. "Dark Young", number of summoned dark young is proportional to the total level of sacrifices.  </br></br></br>  <br>That's a wicked spell</br>  <br>It's a spell with limited utility back in Ainz's MMO world, given how most players were essentially level 100 demi-gods. In this world, it's the apocalypse incarnate.</br>  <br>I find Ainz's brand of evil funny with how much it conflicts with his followers, criminals and literally anyone who inconveniences him is fair game but nope can't torture random villagers</br>  <br>Furthermore most had anti death equips.</br>  <br>as long as ainz doesn't know their backgrounds they all can rot in hell</br>  <br>So LH, but D&amp;D instead of MMORPG</br>  <br>Having bad flashes to sessions of Eldritch Horror gone wrong, due to this.<br><br>ONE Dark Young on the board was bad enough. Thank you for tapping into my fears, Maruyama.</br></br></br>  <br>MMORPG with D&amp;D mechanics.</br>  <br>He's very practical, but he still has a degree of 'human' morality. <br><br>However, it usually only applies if it is in his face, whether at Carne with Sebastian standing right next to him or with the kidnapped civilians after hearing the head maid and Nigredo's plea.<br><br>Demiurge seems to have caught on to it, which is why he never explicitly tells Ainz what he is doing in his "experiments."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best way to save yourself from Lord Ainz is to blurt out your family history and background the minute you meet him. He might not care in the long run but he might spare a second to feel bad about your plight after he kills you.</br>  <br>Other way around considering the transition.</br>  So based on the PVs, can we agree that Madhouse is actually saving their budget for the fight scenes?  <br>They better make the 3rd vol duel one ep long and blow the budget there. I might even forgive them at that point.</br>  <br>That's our last hope it seems. The scenes with the Knights getting killed was a lot higher quality than most of the rest of the PV.</br>  The fight with Aura/Mare against the fire elemental seemed pretty decent too.  <br>Admittedly, while Mahouka didn't lend itself kindly to action scenes, I believe Madhouse did a tolerable job with the few purely action scenes it had (not talking about the magic animation sequences). Thankfully, Overlord has more action sequences than Mahouka ever did so outside of the CGI parts, it should be average at the least.<br><br>As for overally animation, Madhouse isn't exactly known for sakuga, you know? Sure some scenes will be good but the entire anime will probably be more average than anything.</br></br></br>  So what if shitty cgi is just for when it was a game scenes?  <br>I would consider myself rused.</br>  L.L.L. when?  <br>We can only hope they deliver at least that. The dorky heroes and the not so lucky Silian "Knights" looked pretty bad. At least the Nazarick details were nice in comparison.</br>  <br>I was hoping for designs that were more than just bucket helmets</br>  <br> how to become a Demon Lord for dummies <br>Is that, that manga being translated by rapeman?</br></br>  <br>I've been reading that. I like it. MC is my kind of dude.</br>  <br>the NPC are extremely loyal to papa bones, and hate the humans, what could happen if they found out the past of ainz or an encounter with another supreme being. It would be madness. in other case, have they ever explained the hate towards the supreme beings? it just read theories.</br>  <br>You like being fucked by an edgy rapist who is a self proclaimed maou?</br>  <br>You don't?</br>  <br>It could just be Albedo s setting.There are traps all around Nazarick because of eroge master</br>  <br>The hate thing is pretty simple<br><br>All denizens have 100% loyalty to Ainz and the supreme beings<br>110% to their creator<br>Except Albedo who is only loyal to Ainz</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the past players believed that humans could be the best powerful force and the they were, until now.</br>  <br>Ainz fucked up her setting. Instead of 100°/• it is 200.</br>  <br> 100°/• <br>nigga was that necessary? There's a fucking percentage symbol for a reason.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/utism </br></br>  <br>Only about 70% autism.</br>  So has there been any even remote hint than any of his friends or other players period ended up in that world with him?  <br>that´s i would like to know, did tabula change her setting or did she develop the hate towards the supreme beings?</br>  <br>The settings were always there in that wall of text, I thought. They didn't actually mean anything until they became real.</br>  <br>Well not that the Silian magic casters were any more graceful looking in the manga, damn diver helmets.</br>  <br>Yeah and nobody else really paid mind or read the walls of massive text the NPC's were created with, even Ainz only read them on the final day for some odd reason. And even then, skimmed through them.</br>  <br>They never were the most powerful, only thanks to the 13 Heroes stomping all monsters out and 6 Gods safeguarding Silians they managed to stay alive until this date in their walled domains when the Eight Greed Kings warred against each other.</br>  <br>that japanese stronk manga? its nothing like warhammer, not even a little</br>  <br>His "friends" hopping on his robes would just ruin it or at the very least bring unnecessary drama into it.<br><br>And no, WN had one player that was still alive from the era of 13 Heroes but said guy hasn't been introduced to the LN, as of yet afaik.</br></br></br>  Really grateful for the guys who work on translating us a chapter a week, I hope the anime gets more TLs on it so we can read it even more.<br>Any news on the manga?</br>  <br>they just released the first book for the manga, so who knows if there is a chapter this month.</br>  I want to see Aura and Mare cuddle up with Simmering Teapot.    <br>Eh but she's so creepy</br>  <br>That's not Simmering Teapot though</br>  <br>But MeroMero was already a black ooze, why do they need another slime?<br><br>That said, would be pretty amusing to hear her acting voice come from that form.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that really is Simmering Teapot.</br>  <br>So Bukubukuchagama means Simmering Teapot now?</br>  <br><br>The moon runes at the top mean simmering teapot though.</br></br>  <br> ぶくぶく茶釜 <br> Bukubuku Chagama <br> Bubble Bubble Teapot <br><br>Pls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah ok. That makes sense now.</br>  <br><br>IS she a slime? Is there any info on what her particular race is?</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting these pictures from?</br>  <br>Probably one of the Elder X Ooze races like Herohero.</br>  <br>Implying the Elf Twins care.</br>  <br>I took a picture</br>   So in Volume 6, who is ヒルマ? And why is Mare dragging her?   <br>One of the Eight Fingers criminal organization's people, Mare was tasked to break her in so she'll be a mole for Nazarick later on.<br><br>He  threw her to Lord of Terror who made his cockroaches eat her alive from torso and Mare kept her alive be healing her. Bend? Not, back into the pit . Or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Mare so cute?</br>  <br><br>Ahh thanks.</br></br>  <br>She's a noble, the leader of the drug trade operations within a certain organization Nazarick opposes. Needless to say, she did not have a good time after Mare caught her...</br>  <br>Shit, we need MMOs that let you play as slimes.</br>  These cute lovebird Lizards are going to be turned into a matching pair of boots for Ainz and Albedo aren't they?  <br>Nah, they'll be fiiiiine. <br><br><br>Agreed. Or skeletons, or any monster race really. Why hasn't this been done?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, not fluffy enough to be made into morning slippers for Papa Bones as he would shuffle around his suite in the morning.</br>  <br>Stat compensation for players who CAN wear equipment or making up equipment for things that don't normally wear equipment is haaaard.</br>  <br>They made the mistake of kidnapping a human girl that Ainz personally promised to protect. I think it was also one of the few times he got really upset.<br><br>Shady human organization is no match for the might of Nazarick.</br></br></br>  <br>TERA had Aman, basically dragonkin, golems and fat animal dudes as playable races, no one picked them and instead went for human palette swaps and animal eared lolis. People that want to play quirky stuff are a minority.</br>  <br>yeah, but it's always just "slightly different humans". None of them ever take the first step and let you go full monster.</br>  <br><br>Isn't that girl the sister of some other adventurer chick? I recall Ainz saying he was repaying a debt or something.</br></br>  <br><br>DAoC. and Shadowblade had pretty much everything race wise<br>also<br> wanting to play mmos </br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Ninya's sister is different case. And not noble.</br>  <br>I liked being a walking castle while the game was still good.</br>  <br>Hey man, MMOs are the future. We're just not here yet.</br>  <br>The hetermorphic races of the old MMO had a fair amount of downsides compared to the human and demi-human races. However, they had powerful racials and transformative ability. <br><br>Humans and demi-humans had a wider selection of classes and jobs, whereas hetermorphic races were "restricted" by their racial levels. They couldn't take as many classes or jobs as humans or demi-humans could and people could PK them with little consequence.</br></br></br>  <br>Because mmo devs don't have the cajones to balance a system around undead players taking damage from healing spells and heal from harm spells.</br>  <br>You missed the golden age of mmos friend, we're entering the age of mobas, and mobile games now</br>  <br>Well, DDO kind of did it. But the game is super old by now. It needs to be redone and brought up to date.</br>  Speaking of LNs, I highly recommend Legendary Moonlight Sculptor. Been burning through it and enjoying it. Not bad for a Korean LN. <br><br>Can be read at royalroadweeds blog thing.</br></br>  <br>Basically hetermorphic races were better suited for min-maxing.</br>  <br>There was pre-WoW and post-WoW; say what you want about WoW, it massacred the diversity of the MMO market. <br><br>All these LNs and anime tend to focus on mechanics often present in pre-WoW MMOs.</br></br></br>  <br> just started the jewventures <br> didnt go through the dark times of all the translators claiming they totally weren't stopping at volume 20 and other possible translators didn't take over because muh TL community <br><br>I hate and envy you so much</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mare and Entoma go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.</br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>I'm sorry mate. If it's any consolation I've been through TL drama with a few other LNs.</br>  <br>Mare don't fuck around.</br>  <br>I've read a few volumes, it wasn't bad but got bored after a while. Does it get better after a certain point?</br>  <br>Dunno. I'm up to volume 14 and I'm ok with it.</br>  <br> that shield bro fiasco </br>  <br>Mare is  third best boy .</br>  <br>Who are the top two, then?</br>  <br> Demiurge and Ainz. </br>  <br> Not Pandora's Actor <br>Moderately shit taste</br></br>    <br><br><br>Ainz&gt;Sebas&gt;Demiurge&gt;The virtuous King if the forest&gt;Pandora's Actor&gt;Mare</br></br></br>    <br>How about for girls?</br>  <br> tfw I'll never get to play as a mindflayer in anything <br>Suffering.</br></br>  <br>Right? What the hell is wrong with devs?</br>  <br>Again, people that actually want to play are the minority and devs can't into balance.</br>  What would a person think when they find out a slime is the older sister of a bird?  <br><br>Tough one. Narberal&gt;Albedo&gt;Shalltear&gt;Shizu&gt;Yuk<wbr>i&gt;Wolf&gt;Slime&gt;bug</wbr></br></br>   mfw Funi is the one which will be simulcasting this.   <br>Where was this announced?</br>  <br>It's on their Twitter and their site.</br>  <br>Unfortunately, Illithids are one of the few things Wizards reserves for DnD exclusively, so it's not feasible for them to show up in anything else.</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Feasibility shouldn't matter. Just give us monster characters to play as.</br>  <br>Pretty sure I could use Mindflayers in FFT.<br><br>I'd need to get gud at RTS' first.</br></br></br>  <br>Ha, I've been trying to play that.</br>  I've been reading this and it's unbearably shit. <br>It gets good here and there, but it gets ruined quickly each time it starts to get good by some stupid shit. <br><br>The entire thing reminds me of Log Horizon, which I also hated and had the shittiest-taste fans on /a/. Even worse than Fate or Index fags, at least those turdburglars can admit that their series are shit.<br> <br>LH fags never did, they'd just try to claim you were an "IIRC troll" or some similar stupid shit and then focus the entire thread on denying the series could possibly be shit despite its glaring problems. <br>The people making these threads are almost as bad if not equal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dominions isn't an RTS. It's turn based and you don't even directly control your units. It has a faction for basically every fantasy thing you can imagine.</br>  I am interested, tell me, /a/, what genre does the LN belongs to ?  <br>Fucking Bob</br>  <br>poopoo fart butt for losers genre</br>  <br>Are you the guy who named their prophet/god Ainz and had a bazillion skeletons attacking a castle<br><br>Pretty sure I saw a picture like that</br></br></br>  So I been interested in reading this, so it is worth reading?  <br>Please be specific, I can't hear you through all the retard noises.</br>  So this guy is  Peroroncino, Shalltears Creator  no wonder where she got her armor design from  <br><br>Well fuck you too funi.</br></br>  <br>Then you won't be able to even read this series.</br>  <br>I don't care. Just tell me what genre this LN belongs to and what I should expect, the rest is my businese.</br>  <br>I already did and you're being pretty ungrateful for it.</br>  <br>or, you know, you can just read it.</br>  <br>*Business</br>  <br>That was me, the save got corrupted because too many skelletons on the world so I have to do it again.<br>I wish I had skills in pixel art so I could do a Ainz faction with the guardians as heroes and the great leaders as possible gods.<br>Though I don't know what units it can use since Nazarrick isn't just skellies</br></br></br>  <br>I already have tons of others in my backlog, knowing what this LN belongs to helps me sort out the priority.</br>  <br>Overlord should be priority one my friend</br>  <br>Adventure, MMORPG, grimdark, tits, loli, rape, anal, boobs, trap.</br>  <br> grimdark <br> loli <br> rape <br>Ok, I'm in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You would be</br>  Does anyone know how the radio show is supposed to work?  <br> radio show <br>The hell are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>http://www.onsen.ag/program/overlor<wbr>d/</wbr></br>  <br>looks like fan made</br>  <br>http://overlord-anime.com/special/</br>  So where can I download the translations so I can read this? On that LN site?      <br>LMS gets boring after about 20.<br><br>You already know what will happen in the real world with who fucks who and the game world's just a bunch of people taking games too seriously at that point.</br></br></br>  I think this is the closest Albedo pic I've found yet.  And now, for a little comic      <br>As it turns out a Korean author writing about vidya can't keep it interesting for almost 50 volumes<br><br>People should read Play to Live though since it completely ignores the grind after like halfway through volume 1</br></br></br>      <br>Don't get me wrong I was completely fascinated with LMS up to that point.</br>          Aw yeah    <br>i personally dont believe that movile games are the future, zynga bet on mobile games and the company now is broke.</br>  <br>i really wanna know what he did and what secrets he has....</br>  <br>He made a monster girl Starscream amongst other things.</br>  <br><br>My problem with this series is that the main character is called "Weed" really?<br>I've been reading a lot of manhua lately, and koreans always seem to add some dumb ass name into their comics<br> read soul lands <br> kind a goofy isnt that great but its fun to read <br> they go to a magic academy <br> its called Shrek academy <br> fucking picture of shrek as their symbol <br>SERIOUSLY<br>WHY<br><br>games like clash of the clans, candy crush and other dumb freemium titles pull in, insane amounts of cash enough to rival some major companies like Blizzard in terms of revenue</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>english names are just are exotic in korea as they are in japan.<br>as for the strange names, they like nicknaming people based on their habits and or perception of themselves/others<br>and its usually almost funny.<br>their humor translates better to the west than japanese humor though<br>since their pop culture is big on western influence. except the culture of seniority which is foreign to us, since they make fun of bowing and shit too<br>unlike nip work where if a scene is funny in japan it's not in the west since it's a cultural thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soul land(Douluo Dalu) manhua is the worst example though, it completely destroys the story of the novels and is only good to see the design of some characters.<br><br>No idea about the Shrek thing though I sort of assumed the author believed it to actually be part of some folklore</br></br></br>    <br> I sort of assumed the author believed it to actually be part of some folklore <br>well ogres were actually a thing in celtic folk lore but i think this guy didn't really dig deep enough they were essentially the west's oni so that's a thing</br></br>  The light novel started off pretty metal.<br>Then Volume 9 has Ainz going full metal with his legions of evil.<br>And now there's that anime OP.</br></br>    I hope Ivileye joins Nazerick. She's pretty fun.    <br>Ainz promised to let Entoma rip out her voice box if they ever met again, though</br>  <br>I agree but I still kept up with it, skimming the boring parts now. I liked the last arc with the zombie army stuff, catch up if you haven't LMS still has its moments if you enjoyed the beginning.</br>  <br>I wonder where Ivileye stands level-wise. A Pleiades isn't exactly out of the realm of being beaten.</br>  So does pic related get to marry Climb?  <br>Should be about lvl 45 55 since she needed team help.</br>  I've just started listening to the Overlord drama cds, the first one is already talking about resurrecting shalltear <br>can someone tell me which cd goes with which volume?</br>  <br>Technically it should be between volumes 3 and 4.<br><br>I'm not quite sure about Shalltear's personality though, since she's supposed to be completely depressed during this time.</br></br></br>  <br>oh ok, thats good because I didnt start on the lizardman chapter, I wanted to wait for the TLd chapters to bulk so I could spend an entire weekend reading them <br>so I can safely listen to all 8 of these subbed CDs without getting hit with any spoilers?</br></br>  <br>It won't spoil anything in Volumes 4+ if that's what you mean.</br>  So the two-legged sheep are people, right?  <br>I ordered it from CDjapan for exactly that reason, but it still hasn't arrived. If someone else is faster then that's that.</br>  Does Maruyama not have any people who knows English?<br><br>Because that title breaks my immersion.</br></br>  <br>Don't know yet. But if Climb is still survive till end, he might able to marry that princess.</br>  <br>  Imagine this epic birdman drooling over hentai. </br>  <br>maybe that would be worse than death.</br>  <br>Imagine  calling you "onii-chan" with a loli voice.</br>    <br><br>Yes, ch 5 raws this week hopefully.</br></br>  <br>Every member of Ainz Ooal Gown had a few screws loose as evidenced on their created NPCs, like Peroronchino designing Shalltear as a anti Momonga warrior, or Tabula Smaragdina designing Nigredo after a horror-story (scaring all members shitless) and Albedo with the flavor of 'wanting to kill all supreme beings'. <br><br>Let's not mention Momonga's Pandora's Actor so as to not lower further our impression of Suzuki Satoru.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or rather he jokes and tells but Ainz doesn't get it.<br><br>Lol Bellion Sheep. Lol Chimera.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol Re: Monster is nothing but fuck the girls, eat to get powerful, fuck the girls, eat to get powerful, etc.</br>  <br> lol <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>Well if she swears loyalty to the Nazarick, I can see Ainz apologising to Entoma again and giving her another reward or two as compensation. And his word is law anyways so he can change it if the situation fits.</br></br>  <br> No Aura <br>Rly ???</br></br>  <br> like Peroronchino designing Shalltear as a anti Momonga warrior <br>Er, I don't think Shalltear was specifically designed to counter Ainz. She's just an anti-mage character. That's pretty general. It's not like Ainz was the only spellcaster in the game, you know.</br></br>  <br>Neat</br>  <br>Maybe the supreme being werent so friendly as ainz remember. Touch Me discussion with the guild could be?</br>  <br>I think he discussed with someone he was friend with in real life but it was not Peperoncino or sister.</br>  http://raw.senmanga.com/Overlord/06<wbr>/1#4<br>Didn't find download link though so sorry for shitty reader</br></wbr>  <br>King of forest Kitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</br>  <br>http://bato.to/read/_/319093/overlo<wbr>rd_ch6_by_ak-scanlations</wbr></br>  <br>I don't remember if Ainz knew any of the g.members in real life but Touch Me and Urbet were friends and both quit over real life falling out. Iirc that is.</br>    <br><br>Yeah, shame it's only monthly though. Was looking for some other completely untl'ed series worth picking up, but everything either has a group on it already or is garbage.<br><br> I should probably TL some actual Rapeman at some point, but then I remember I probably can't upload it anywhere, not Batoto or even Sadpanda due to them calling it 'commercial non-h'. </br></br></br></br>    So the Shalltear arc is going to be climax for the anime, right?  <br>maybe. It seems the logical part in the story to stop at.</br>  <br>Isn't it only 12 episodes though? I would hate it if they rushed through the Gazef part.</br>  <br>Most likely. Even has the best scene at the end where Papa Bones sees his old guildmates overlapping with the Guardians.<br><br>Unless, of course, you want a documentary about Lizardmen.</br></br></br>  <br>If it's ~12 episodes. then yes. If it's ~24, expect the men in the kingdom part 2 to be the final.</br>  <br><br>4 episodes per volume is one of the most common formats after all.</br></br>  <br> Isn't it only 12 episodes though? <br>where did you hear that?</br></br>  <br> documentary about Lizardmen. <br>That part sucks ass so much.<br><br>World building is one thing. World building through several chapters of words is another.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That part sucks ass so much. <br>I disagree, they are clearly going to become part of Nazarrick, the chapters from their POV just makes it so you don't feel like "eh yeah lizards"</br></br>  <br>It is confirmed to only be 1 cour.So either shalltear or Lizard end if stretching it.Worst case we get even more volumes.</br>  <br>   I should probably TL some actual Rapeman at some point, but then I remember I probably can't upload it anywhere, not Batoto or even Sadpanda due to them calling it 'commercial non-h'. <br>How about just posting them in the sad panda threads and jcafe?</br></br>  <br>Unless mr. frost pain is going to be a guardian I don't give a shit. Hamsuke was enough. They even try to put more filler shit in like lizardman sex like it wasn't clear enough already. Cocytus and Demiurge saved the volume. Sheep for MVP.</br>  <br>Well, Ainz and his citizen can't get martial arts skills and he needs some slaves that can get them so that he knows better how to deal with them and if they get some treasure who boost those skills it may greatly increase his army power. Even if there are a lot of strong NPCs he needs more disposable pawns that can think on their own so he can just have them take care of little things skeletons are not able to think of. And even better if an NPC/new world person give birth to some creature that can get as strong as one of the lvl 80-90 guards and even get the martial arts skills you can see how OP it would be considering that a lvl 40-50 can manage to hurt his guardians with them.</br>  <br> filler shit </br>  <br><br> sad panda threads and jcafe <br><br> spending hours upon hours TL'ing and editing some series that will be seen by maybe all of 20 people in the sadpanda threads and 10 who visit the blog <br> caring about jcafe faggots <br><br>It can't be helped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed from the pre-screening event or? And yeah, 3 per cour would be optimal, 4 doable and with more migth as well zoetrope the whole production.</br>  <br>Not my fault both batoto and exhentai go full idiocy. And unless you wanna go on tumblr just to get those retards ' hate i don't know what to suggest .</br>    <br>is that entoma?</br>  <br>yup</br>  So I just got to the part when the best character shows up.<br>At what later parts in the LN will  Pandora's Actor  pop up again?</br>    <br>oh my</br>  <br>Literally go fuck yourself with that shit taste.</br>  <br>And your telling me Papa Bone doesnt want to dig this</br>  <br>That's fine and dandy but do they really deserve an extended backstory about uniting and falling in love for that? They could have just jumped straight into the love story and Rororo is the most useless character in the manga.<br> muh pet is family <br>And he doesn't matter in the long run. He'll die anyway.<br><br><br>I'm not the one into weird bestiality shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> manga <br>I meant light novel. Shit</br></br>  <br>Im interest how lizarman make baby</br>  <br> deserve <br>Doesn't fucking matter, if the author wants to write a lizard documentary he'll write a goddamned lizard documentary.</br></br>  <br>That's the same kind of mentality that drove SAO into even deeper shit with 16.5<br><br>Not that it was any less shit at first but still</br></br></br>  <br>Well you seem to be in a minority, for now at least.</br>  <br>He has his reservations about it.</br>  <br>Of course I'm in the minority. This series only became famous after all because the Danmachi faggots all converged here. It's their next "im in a game world" anime.</br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night.</br>  <br>Eat a dick most people in these threads have been reading since volume 1 or 2</br>  <br>Maybe you should lurk more instead of pretending to be an oldfag here.</br>  <br>I've been here since then too.<br><br>Does that make me or them any more credible?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what the hell Danmachi is. I found Overlord through the MT threads.</br>  <br><br>Yeah no, we came here with the promise of an evil lich king doing evil lich things.</br></br>  <br>Eggs probably. Maybe.</br>  So when is the anime being shown anyway? They're not doing a public screening or something?  <br>pre-screening was last weekend, official airing is on 7th.</br>  <br>And nobody said anything? What the hell? Gate is doing a prescreening and everything is blowing the fuck up.</br>  <br> And nobody said anything? <br><br>You do realize Overlord is nowhere as popular as Gate is, right? And yes, we knew there was going to be a pre-screening, but it's not likely we'll get a rip or something.</br></br></br>  <br>The novel is quite popular but that's with ch/kr official licenses already rolling, where as Gate was also original novel in japan and has had successful adaptations (unlike what Overlord manga is).</br>  <br>There was certainly some drama within the guild, but it's rather farfetched to think that Shalltear was designed to counter Momonga because Peroronchino hated him. There's no logic in that.</br>  BUNKER THREAD WHILE WE WAIT FOR SUBS<br><br>NO SPOILERS thank you</br></br>   tfw the war will never end <br>I want out.</br>  <br>Anime ends the same way the first volume of the novel does.<br>Kumiko and Shuichi reconcile before they play.

Whether or not it was from Kumiko’s own body heat, its fabric had roughly felt warm to the touch.<br><br>“It suits you.”<br><br>She laughed in a somewhat curious way, and then suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder. Pressed against such force, Shuuichi spontaneously tilted his body towards Kumiko. The lifting of her heels had playfully come into sight. Kumiko stood tip-toed and she held her hand close to his ear, with her lips following suit. This froze Shuuich’s body in place, even while his heart was bouncing — with Kumiko ever so close to him, Shuuichi found her presence difficult to ignore.<br><br>Kumiko’s voice had flowed, with the sigh of her breath tickling his ears, and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo striking his nose. Shuuchi did not move, but he was absolutely certain of the words she had just imparted to him.<br><br>“I love you too, Shuuichi.” .<br><br>/u/ Lose</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's her fucking initials, you retarded monkey. </br>  SO WHO WON?  <br>forgive me for the trip today but since the anime is over, it'll be probably be time to throw out the spoilers everywhere while you wait for subs. Also I'm the anon who talks about TakixReina and Mizore all day so those are my credentials I guess.<br><br> Kitauji wins the prefecture tournament, then they move onto the Kansai tournament. At Kansai, one of the top schools expected to win JOB hard because their adviser left, which lets Kitauji get a narrow third place Gold victory. However when they get to Nationals, they get btfo pretty hard by actual good schools and get copper. And it's pretty sad, everyone cries all the way home to the bus. Reina is especially upset for obvious reasons. She also apologizes to Kaori first surprisingly, since Reina feels like she jobbed it and took away Kaori's chance to play a solo. Haruka is crying so much that Asuka has to give a speech. And the section of the novel is Asuka passing the figurative torch to Kumiko in the shape of Asuka's music notes, which she received from her dad that she hasn't seen in 15 years because that is another long story </br></br></br>  <br>I want them to wear their marching uniforms as swimsuits.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>   [HorribleSubs] Hibike!

This gave them a mini power boost for prefecture but when they got to Nationals, every motherfucker can play this easy. That's also why Kaori playing the solo part was pretty important to her, because it would be her carrying the entire band to victory. But in actuality it's the Oboe carrying them. </br></br></br></br>  <br> hetfags thinking they won just because /u/ didn't win </br>  <br>anon, is pretty much confirmed by now.</br>  <br>context please.</br>   Both fagotts having a good taste in both man and fashion <br>Damn can they get any better?</br>  how to post link here.<br>has a fucking shit in neytip seems announcement of a free movie and third season of K-on<br><br>bitch who pario the media Hibike sales is 4,9k</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, just like Amagi Brilliant Park season 2 and Hyouka season 2</br>  <br><br>   it's the Oboe carrying them. <br><br>Absolutely halal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This anime is an adaptation of a novel.<br>The novel has a "het" end.<br>Anime adaptation did not have an anime original end.<br><br>There is literally nothing left to argue about here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon said<br> hetfags are chill </br></br>  The ponytail is back.  <br>TAXIDO!</br>  <br>Amaburi is bound to happen, Hyouka there's not enough material yet and Hibike is even on event already.</br>  The entire first season summarized in one frame.  <br>Hyouka is confirmed no s2 because not enough source material.</br>    <br>#LOVEWINS<br>TYBKA</br></br>  <br> What happen in July 10th? <br>the studio's 30th anniversary.</br></br>  <br>And oboe-chan is only a second-year.</br>  <br>one thing was original, though: Kumiko didn't give two shits about Shuichi and his screentime was reduced</br>  <br>Based natsun.</br>  <br>They seem to have a tuxedo fetish.</br>  <br>Amagi Brilliant Park had better sales.<br>It was a most entertaining anime, and there was a predominance of only people of the same sex.<br>And characters of the opposite sex interact between them.<br>Hibiki is an anime moshit school, in a colorful environment and distoricido where only girls are important, and there can be interaction between them.<br>The worst form of comparison with real life I've ever seen</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fixed for you anon</br>  <br> interlocked fingers lesbian sex in public <br>Those dykes couldn't wait until they got home?</br></br>  Yurifags are happy because of an open-ended ending.

Remember that their goal was only to reach nationals, not win it. But after they lost, Taki sensei actually doesn't say anything. No speech or anything. It's mostly Asuka who tells them all to git gud for next year cause she won't be around after she graduates; however, Taki sensei goes straight to Reina and they have the whole Reina confession scene round two.

Euphonium<br><br>  Asuka's dad is a famous euphonist. Like if they had a Japanese Chopin of the euphonium, that would be Asuka's dad. Her parents got divorced when she was two and her mom has custody. Her mom hates her dad but they never say why. She also refuses to let Asuka see her father. Asuka's mom remarries and Asuka pretty much forgets everything about her real father. But one day her dad mails her his silver euphonium (wink wink) with a bunch of music books, one of which is his personal book of songs (which she later gives to Kumiko). So Asuka becomes curious about her real dad and learns the euphonium from her brother, who of course learned it from their dad. And as the daugther of a musical genius, Asuka starts to feel a connection to her dad by playing. Asuka's mom wants her daughter to be a successful not-musician so she was against her learning how to play. But Asuka makes an agreement that if she studies hard, she can stay in the club. And everything is mostly okay for a while. Also this parallels Mamiko's story because it's basically the same thing since she had to quit for school minus the later twist. The reason why Asuka is so neutral is because there's so much fucking drama in her own life that playing music is the only thing she finds joy in. Actually the reason why she says "I wish these fun times could continue on forever" in the last episode is because playing her euphonium is the only time she's happy and she graduates this year. She also didn't really care about the competition in the first place so she let the club members kill each other over something she found pointless. Until motherfucking out of a manga twist (Asuka literally points out that her entire life is a music manga) that Asuka's dad is actually one of the judges for Nationals. <br><br>and I ran out of space so continue in next post</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chu2 and Tamako are explicit romances.</br>  <br>Dear I work as a camera in a sport channel.<br>I filmed the daily life of a volleyball team including the locker room.

I regret not trying to become special.</br>  <br> Kyoani's magnum opus. <br> an adaptation </br></br>  <br>Hyouka was 3 years ago though.</br>  I find this scene cute.   So, is copper in the nationals dead last?   <br>I wish I had done something in Highschool.</br>  Someone got a cap/webm of Reina telling Kumiko "Nakagawa Senpai is cool"?  <br> most anons that are guys will never understand </br>  did they really lose?  <br>So who's supposed to be better?  Reina or Nozomi? </br>  so many bijins  <br> romantic resolution <br>It's barely a friendship resolution, and I'm okay witht that.</br></br>  <br>haha spoilers<br> So even though her dad is a judge, this doesn't actually suddenly make Asuka care about the tournament for two reasons. One because she knows her club is too bad to actually make it to Nationals so she won't get her hopes up, and two is because Asuka is honestly just too afraid of meeting her real dad after basically being away from him her entire life. She could just take a train to see him at anytime but she doesn't. However, when they actually DO win prefectures this episode, this is a game changer for Asuka. So in the next volume, Nozomi, the tryhardest senpai who left the club, wants to come back. And Asuka actually wanted her back at first but then finds out that Nozomi broke Mizore's heart and if Mizore loses it, then the dream is dead. So she refuses to let Nozomi back in. And this is another long ass story so lets just go to the next part. So now comes the infamous third volume where people hear that Asuka is forced to quit the club by her parents, but it's actually just her mom. Asuka's agreement with her mom never entailed Nationals so Asuka complies with her. So at a PTA meeting, Asuka and her mom are with Taki sensei and Asuka's mom demands that Asuka quit the club to secure her future.Taki sensei refuses to let Asuka leave the club though because its against her will. Taki sensei doesn't budge so Asuka and her mom leave and then there's this brutal moment in the hallway after. Asuka's mom tells Asuka to tell Taki sensei she wants to quit, Asuka says she won'tand her mom slaps her so hard that Asuka falls to the hallway. Kumiko of course is here to see all of this. And Asuka later takes a break from school and the club. Natsuki temporarily takes Asuka's place in A-team. Also Natsuki and Asuka have this great moment where Asuka gives Natsuki the figurative, "you're up next" brofist. But Natsuki refuses to take Asuka's place and Natsuki tells Asuka she'll be waiting for her to come back <br><br>and out of post again</br></br></br></br>  Anyone got the compilation of her in several different episodes?  <br>It should be "Nakagawa-senpai is nice", actually.</br>   Concert band arrangement of OP as the series ending <br><br>Kyoani you dun good</br></br>  <br> Mizore.  </br>  <br>This is not their Magnum Opus though.</br>  <br>Not dead last, since multiple teams will receive copper.</br>  <br><br>They didn't get gold, just silver</br></br>  What will be the next anime,that fans of yuri chosen to cast their delusions<br>someone already knows</br>  <br>She's so fucking HOT<br><br>She's like the bitch who sits next to Yui<br><br>I want to fuck either of them, or both of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone have GIFs of Timpani-chan rocking it like a boss?  <br>Top 3 teams advance to the Kansai region competition from Kyoto, and top 3 teams advance to Nationals from Kansai.</br>  <br>You can assume whatever you want as the ending since it's open, there's no reason to assume it will be the same as the novel, when they leave it open for both couples and reduced the screentime of the hetero one in this season.</br>   tfw you go to a school full of lazy shits, autists, and drama queens instead of going to a music school with this friendly qt   <br>kousaka and asuka are the only memorable characters in this entire show</br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br>Why does everyone have tiny hands?</br>  <br>I went to a music school and our class ruined the school's reputation.</br>  <br>Because it was really cute<br> raises fist <br> don't ignore me now! </br></br></br>  Hetfags BTFO/  Just watched the episode... it was fantastic.<br><br>Hibike! isnt the top KyoAni show, but this episode sure is among the best episodes they made.</br></br>  <br>PLEASE BASED NOVELANON TELL US<br>How much of the LNs has been adapted into first season?

So I just finished marathoning this series.<br>I gotta ask. Did S2 feel like a drag while it was airing?<br>All I know about the series prior to watching it was that it provided the most capped threads in /a/ this spring. Why was it talked about so much?</br></br>  <br> bijin mocks hikikomori penises.jpg </br>  Yahallo~!

Compared to how much I enjoyed season 1, season 2 was a tiresome, unfunny drag and I'm sick of people told by it's rabid fans that I obviously just didn't understand the retarded melodrama.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why she is so loveable? Do such girls even exist?</br>  <br>This anon knows the score.<br><br><br>She's also the only main character who didn't become retarded in season 2.</br></br></br></br>   muh real thing   <br> muh genuine girls </br>  <br> muh drama queens </br>  its amazing how much better the first 6 volumes are to the latest 5  <br>Because she was preemptively retarded?<br>[sp] We still love it though [/sp]</br></br>  <br><br>I miss this beautiful chara design.</br></br>  <br>I struggle to understand people who say the new character design is better.</br>  <br>Well, at least she is not a childhood friend and not MC's initial crush either. That alone increased her chance significantly.</br>  Remember when Yahari was fun?  <br><br> tfw you remember the 3 main characters actually used to go on interesting adventures as part of their club </br></br>  <br><br><br>The only charm that was there in S2 was by the new blonde girl, (and pales to S1 Y and Y). The only interesting character was Hayama. <br>Apparently there was supposedly an iconic moment where 8man breaks down in front of the girls, and all he can talk about is "muh real thing." I get that what follows is figuring out what this real thing is, but in this delicate moment where the trio finally reconnect, I don't even know what to feel about it.<br>I get continually teased by potential drama whenever Yukino's sister comes in when Yukino is also on the scene, but then it goes nowhere. <br>S2 was just unfulfiling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino's sister went from being an interesting character to an annoying villain.</br>  <br>Haruno was right though.</br>  <br>I'm not denying that. But she was far more nuanced in season 1 and a bit less of an outright bitch.</br>  <br>Right about what? She's a fucking cunt sticking her nose where it doesn't belong because she's a no life loser with nothing better to do than insert herself into the lives of high schoolers. Haruno is fucking sad.</br>    <br> She's a fucking cunt sticking her nose where it doesn't belong because she's a no life loser with nothing better to do than insert herself into the lives of high schoolers. Haruno is fucking sad. <br>All of this is true, but she is right. A cunt. but right.</br></br>  <br>I've only seen up to episode 12 at the moment, but I don't see what she could possibly be right about. She's simply a sadist who gets off on other people's suffering.<br><br>What she needs is someone to fuck with her.</br></br></br>  <br> What she needs is someone to fuck with her. <br>Or somebody to just fuck her.</br></br>  <br><br>Even if her character lost her subtlety, I wouldn't have minded as much if there was more focus on Yukino's thoughts and behaviour. As much as I can tell, she didn't grow at all in S2, and in those scenes with both of them, all they did was establish that she needs 8man and Yui to protect her.<br>At least Yui showed a little growth by wanting both 8man and Yukino to stop putting the burdens on themselves, and willingly put herself out there to do so.<br>I'm just dissatisfied by how little growth there was to the two main girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wouldn't have minded as much if there was more focus on Yukino's thoughts and behaviour <br>True. She was sidelined for a lot of S2, even though large parts of the plot related to her. It was just people discussing her rather than actual focus om her. I found that quite boring for one thing. <br><br>Also, where they hell did the classic Yukino dry wit go in S2? It was one of the primary sources of comedy on S1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why live?  ;_; </br>  <br>Yes.  my gf </br>  <br> Also, where they hell did the classic Yukino dry wit go in S2? <br><br>Ice Queen Yukino is dead. Enjoy your stupid moeblob Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>Its the eyes. Most distincitive part of ponkan's art and they completely remove it for s2.</br>   mfw Im deployed and I cant watch along with everyone <br><br>Who's winning?</br></br>  <br><br>Now here's the weird thing. The basic idea of Haruno's anger comes from Yukino being a total doormat, and Yukino doesn't become this until season 2, which just so happens to be when Haruno dials up her bitchiness. <br>It's like the author decided to change his fucking mind on what Yukino was about. <br>What happened to the girl who rejected Hayama's friends request because that dude was being disrespectful to 8man?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Komachi</br>  <br> alumni coming back to high school <br>I browse 4chan regularly and even I'm not that much of a loser.</br></br>  <br>I watch this only for Komachi.</br>  <br>Komachi looks so cute in season 1 compared to now.<br><br>What happened bros? What did we do to deserve this fate?</br></br></br>  <br>Why must imoutos always be best girls? Can't authors just write shitty imoutos so the MC can actually have a chance at winning best girl?</br>  <br>That she is.</br>  <br> God the old art style was gorgeous.  <br>I remember a lot of people bitching about the first season art style and saying Feel's is better.</br></br>  <br>but when they write shitty imoutos they get the worst girl anyway, or none at all, just look at oreimo.</br>  <br>Hit the nail on the head there, anon. I think the hair is also important though.<br><br><br>Not the fans anyway, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's like the author decided to change his fucking mind on what Yukino was about. <br>Which is why she's probably the only anime character to go from one of my favourites to a person that just irritates me, all in the space of one season.<br><br><br>Those people are retarded, anon. That said, Feel's animation was of a better quality - I will give them that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That said, Feel's animation was of a better quality <br><br>Different try, but I want to weigh in. It's weird because I'm even willing to concede that feels art style fit the tone of s2 better than the old style would have. Maybe that's why I miss the old style so much, it's because I miss the tone of s1?</br></br></br>  <br>Different guy*<br>Excuse me, throwing absurdly expensive phone into lake.</br></br>  <br> It's weird because I'm even willing to concede that feels art style fit the tone of s2 better than the old style would have. Maybe that's why I miss the old style so much, it's because I miss the tone of s1? <br>Very well put, anon. I would struggle to deny that the art style of S2 (as much as I hated it) gelled well with the type of show S2 of Oregairu was. Similarly, S1's art style suited the type of show S1 was. But this alone goes to show the disparity between the 2 seasons - they're almost like watching 2 different shows. <br><br>And while I'm aware that it's trite to mention it, S1's art style adheres closest to the source material - infer what you will about that and the tone etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yep.<br>S1 was fun, S2 was genuinely bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Subtle..</br></br>  <br> S2 was genuinely bullshit. <br>Yet /a/ and other less savory anime sites are in love with it. And any time you call them out on it, they go "2deep4u" and run away cackling to themselves.</br></br>  <br>I don't think adhering to the art style in a LN holds much importance, that's the area where you get the most freedom from the source material. Sometimes LNs have god awful art and a studio has to ignore it entirely.</br>  <br>True. I concede that it was a weak point.</br>  Why did they have to completely assassinate Yukino's character in S2. She's goes from confident and independent in S1 to being unable to make any decision and completely pushed around and dependent on everyone around her. Almost completely different characters.  <br>She's a suicidal penguin.</br>  <br> Why did they have to completely assassinate Yukino's character in S2. <br>Drama. <br><br>Well, Melodrama to be more precise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised you didn't say  forced drama </br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Did the OST for this get released yet?  <br>Who writes an entire fucking essay on this shit? If you can't follow the cryptic melodrama shit stop watching the show, don't wait for sums autist like that guy to spell it out.</br>  <br>Y'know, when people don't pick up on a character trait as fundamental as that it either means the exposition is very bad or the audience is retarded. Normally I'd go with the latter option, but given how bad S2 was at explaining the motivations of many of its characters (seriously, unless you'd read the source material S2 is a headscratcher from episode 4 onwards), I think for once retardation may not be the cause.<br><br>It would also explain why i see so many different Secondary theories about character motivations floating around the place.</br></br></br>  <br> sums autist  <br>I take back what I said earlier, I will not throw the phone in a lake, because that is a beautiful thing it has just done to my post.</br></br>  <br>I can understand the development, but spending 1 season developing a character one way, only to pull a complete 180 the next season is jarring and ruins the story flow. This is on top of the complete change of pace of the plot as a whole.<br><br>And besides, the whole car accident thing was bullshit anyway. She was sitting in the back, she has literally 0 responsibility for the event.</br></br></br>  <br> If you can't follow the cryptic melodrama shit stop watching the show, don't wait for sums autist like that guy to spell it out. <br>Or more accurately, if you need an autist to explain a rom-com to you, either than rom-com is bad or you're just retarded.<br><br><br> She was sitting in the back, she has literally 0 responsibility for the event. <br>Yeah, but muh melodrama.<br><br><br>That's a dirty word these days, anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ami or Mami?<br><br>also<br><br> stockings with stars on them <br>why is this so sexual</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Side ponytail always wins.</br>    <br>Too late.

I watch american tv series and some patriotism doesn't bother me at all, but too much talk about the "fathers" the "freedom" and how good their soldiers is really dumb for foreginer eyes.<br><br>This series is not an exception the level of patriotism is so hight that makes things really dumb, not because is japanese patriotism, its because is too much patriotism, an american (or russian or french or whatever) series with the same level of patriotism would be as dumb as this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I just tried.<br><br> This program is not available in your region. <br> You will be automatically redirected to the home page in 10 seconds.  <br> Please click the link below if you aren't redirected after 10 seconds have elapsed. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet.

You didn't even go halfway.</br>  Type 74  <br>Well this was a while back, that's as far as it was out at the time. I didn't so much quit reading as bother to go back and check if it had updated further.</br>  <br>yeah it's updated a lot since then. Finish reading it man.</br>  I'm mostly excited for backblast bit.  <br>Which one? The first time they find the dragon, or the Dark Elves melting faces? Either is fine.</br>  <br>Christ. Still no go.</br>  <br>Sasuga lelouch</br>  <br> Rory pink pantsu <br>They already fucked up her design but pink? seriously?</br></br>  <br>Even after the goddamn broadcast has ended it's still not available.<br><br>I mean I get it but.</br></br></br>  <br>AOTY</br>  <br>You understand nothing, anon.</br>  <br>Is it actually done? I try to avoid starting a series before it's finished lest it end up like Berserk.</br>  <br>It won't be "done" for a long time. But they just finished one of the novels.</br>  <br>When the jap government supports your work you don't get it to end up like Berserk</br>  <br>They already expected the other nations to kidnap the otherworlders, while the enemies basically have nearly zero information. What would you expect?</br>  <br>Is this done by the same artist that did the designs for SAO? Looks generic as hell.</br>   Get told that this is amazing <br> Read it and find that its "beta otaku gets fantasy harem": Iteration #626353535, now with added Nippon strong power fantasy <br>Thats what I get for listening to /k/s recommendations. Then again, these are the same people that told me Jormungand was good, so its really my fault for being fooled twice.</br></br>  <br> post something in /a/ claiming to have read something <br> spice it up to make it believable with words like nippon power fantasy <br> not realize screw up in some details <br> itami is apparently a beta otaku now </br></br></br></br>  <br> Lelouch actually saying something reasonable for once <br><br>Is this still /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>The only modern military aspect is via the Japanese Defense Force, which is actually really archaic in terms of military gear.</br>  <br><br>The character designers have horrible taste in panties, obviously. Also they have no idea what fits with gothic lolita. It's a shame</br></br>  <br>Their tanks are one of the latest.</br>  <br>It doesn't even make sense in the context of the show/manga. I remember when Rory visited their world she went to buy lacey underwear too.</br>  <br>They did not. It was an alien loli demigod that did.<br>Troll harder, faggot.</br></br>  Blue hair is best girl, am I wrong?  Reminder that the anime will ruin Rori  <br>JAPANESE NATIONALISM ON THE RISE.<br>NUKE 'EM!<br>NUKE 'EM ALL!</br></br></br>  <br> An army whose entire doctrine focuses around hiding in the woods until the Americans mobilize and then providing logistical and supporting elements for the American war machine <br> Being able to handle an army that has invincible dragons <br>Nippon stronk is right</br></br></br>  <br>Nah Rori is best girl and she will won the Itamibowl</br>  <br>Right? This is much better, and overall more mature in my opinion. But they moefied the whole show and ruined the designs.</br>  <br> This is much better, and overall more mature <br>That defeats the purpose of being a loli imo</br></br>  <br>fuck I missed it. <br>Im gonna check out my premium acct to try timeshift view</br></br>  <br>I dig Rory's moe design.</br>  <br>I think a mature loli is fine. One of the reasons I like Rori.</br>  <br>Record it for us anon please.</br>  fuck yes it worked<br>watching it now</br>  <br>I bet you like K-On too.</br>   that nico stream <br><br>DEAD ON ARRIVAL dropped before it even airs.</br></br>  <br>proof or it didn't happen</br>  <br>We haven't seen anime Rory in action yet.

What's it about anyway? The first ep of the anime?</br>  <br>This isn't an episode though, just a preview special... just waiting to see any new footage</br>  <br> one alpha <br> there are multiple couples between many soldiers and locals <br> two of Itami's men get their own girls, one gets married and have kids <br> another diplomat gets a loli bride <br> one alpha <br><br>Lelouch, if you don't know anything why don't you keep your mouth shut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you aohige?</br>  <br>When the fuck did marriage become alpha?

A one alpha would be SAO where the panties drop just by hearing Kirito.<br><br>MC is also divorced, and acknowledged as ""nothing special".</br></br></br>  <br>I still keep seeing Kuroneko.<br>Didn't the artist actually drew Rori in Kuroneko's dress?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much ends here, very short glimpse of the first episode<br><br>Also while the romans and the orcs are killing people, no actual scene of violent kill have been shown.</br></br></br>  <br>The gore is gone?<br><br>Oh no that's another dealbreaker for the manga autists</br></br></br>  Oh, not over yet.

Do you want things to be shit? Do you just love shit? Its taste, texture, its heat?

I have the right to say I hate the complaints. You complain about art design right down to panty color. Don't push your shit on me autist.</br></br></br>  <br>expect german patriotism we dont have something like that</br>  <br>You are forgetting that she IS a demigod, not just a chuuni. I still find the chuuni better but the actual magic and fact that she will win the Itamibowl after the contract makes it that much sweeter.</br>  <br> You complain about art design right down to panty color <br>Panty color is the biggest issue.</br></br>    <br> its because is too much patriotism <br>It also says the Japanese government is made up of useless puppets.<br><br>I don't think that's too much. American tv meanwhile glorifies the White House you've seen several movies that have gunfights in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The manga art isn't that great but goddamn Rory looks nothing fucking like that<br><br>Why is she so different when the other girls are relatively the same?</br></br></br>  Man, them invasion screenshots reminded me of that captured japanese girl. Fuck.  <br> You complain about art design right down to panty color. <br><br>Are you acting retarded here or not, cause you have me fooled with your brilliant act. We aren't bitching because panties got their color changed. There's clear content cutting and alterations already being made to the anime adaptation.<br><br>Listen here normie, if an entertainment piece is good; whether a book, movie, music or picture gets an adaption that changes anything, it completely shits on what made it good in the first place. It's the core reason why adaptations, remakes, revisions so on and so forth always suck ass, because they deviate from the source and alter what made it shine in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br>  The sound effects are awesome, you can hear click of scope zooming, the low roar of engines, etc.  <br>Does the type 10 show up in this?</br>  finally, more look at Lelei  <br>True. Also, that fucking tease when bitch elf interrupts them broke my heart.</br>  <br> it completely shits on what made it good in the first place <br>And Rory is the only thing that makes GATE "good" whatever your standard of good is?<br>What makes this is the premise of modern military going up against the armies of Sauron not a fucking semi immortal goth loli.<br>You manga secondaries keep complaining about everything is ruined because of one extensive cosmetic change.<br>You haven't even seen the goddamn anime yet.<br><br>How about reserving judgement until a few eps have come out and conclude if Rory's character was indeed defiled because of cosmetic changes?<br><br>I don't see you people complaining that Goku became a do-gooder superhero in the US from the battle-loving maniac he was in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fluffy bunny crotches <br>fix'd</br></br>    <br>That dragon looks like a digimon to me.</br>  <br>Dragon is going to bite his tongue</br>  <br> You haven't even seen the goddamn anime yet. <br><br> Art between human characters and dimensional characters aren't aesthetically aligned <br> Main characters having their looks changed <br> Violence removed <br><br>These aren't good signs muppet. They point to greater underlying concerns. What about the implied rape and sex that is in the series, will that also get cut or changed? If the violence is gone, how am I to take anything seriously?<br><br>I don't know what the anime holds, but I do know the manga, and that is where my concerns come stem from.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Isn't it a wyvern?</br></br>  <br>No, what got me was when they showed how things between them both should've gone and how things happen when the Chink, the Rusky and the Murrikan tried to get them.</br>  <br> smug Rory <br>YES!<br><br>But still needs more smugness.</br></br></br></br>  Was Gate's author a soldier?  <br> Violence removed <br>The violence is still there. It's the gore that's gone based on the screenshots you idiot.<br> They point to greater underlying concerns. <br>Changing how people look and how the monsters and people look like they're made by different people point to greater underlying concerns how? It automatically changes how they behave now? The plot drastically suffers because they look different from the manga?<br><br>Call me whatever you want you're literally defending your stupid stance of judging a book by its cover or in this case, an anime by its screenshots.<br><br>The implied rape and sex will not be removed because it's an important part of the series. They wouldn't be breaking peace treaties if the nip woman wasn't enslaved. The prince wouldn't die if it weren't for bunny queen. Delilah wouldn't be bonding with glasses if the bunny queen weren't enslaved by the empire. Fucking italica as well.<br><br>Will they censor it? Seeing as this anime is also marketed to kids they will. Bunny queen might be wearing some sackcloth or rags but the implication is still there.<br><br>Stop bitching faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he served in JSDF</br>  <br>It will be hard to have as much smug as with Shinoa.</br>  <br>Basically cock blocked by the plot.</br>  <br>You have no idea how pissed I was at how wasted the premise of Ooutbreak Company was and elated to discover that this existed. I am hype.</br>  <br> It also says the Japanese government is made up of useless puppets. <br>Typical right wing propaganda, nothing new unless you don't kow shit about politics.</br></br>  <br> 10 </br>  <br>Yet Outbreak Company is good and this is bad.<br>Funny how it works.</br></br>  Last one.  <br>Yup. At that point Itami was starting to give in to his desires which made it better until you read "this is how it should've happen."</br>  <br>No, and no.</br>  <br>Got that any sharper?</br>  <br>Funny how you think a series led by a beta otaku who somehow magically jumps all legal procedures is better than this just because your country's special ops got ass kicked in a sauna.<br><br>Funny how that works indeed. I'll be bathing in your tears when that episode comes anon.</br></br></br>  <br>So it ends with best girl closeup? Nice. Do we get an end card?</br>  <br>Damn, that's disappointing. I was looking forward to seeing characters with actual tone for a change, but they managed to make some of the manliest people in IRL japan into gaunt scrawny faggots. Sasuga.</br>  <br>Nah they just played the new CMs, Lelei ver, Itami ver, and ended the special with Rory ver. <br><br>Tuka got shafted. Again.</br></br></br>  <br>what is this? somekind of knock off Finnish M91</br>  <br>Wow, they changed her teacher too.</br>  <br>Jap flecktarn</br>  <br>You do know the manga is not the original, and he was never visually depicted anywhere else right.</br>  Let's talk monstergirls, who's your favourite in-universe monstergirl?  <br> mfw the soldier is drawn with genuinely squinty eyes asian face </br>  <br>Broken rabbit queen</br>  <br>I like that this series emphasizes and includes all the outdated equipment as well, but I'm glad glorious Type 10 shows itself.</br>  <br>Titmonster</br>  <br>that's not a footage from gate.</br>  <br>Dammit. I stand corrected.</br>  <br>But the manga is what they know and apparently the manga is gospel instead of being treated as an adaptation around here</br>  <br>You do know the manga is the only thing everyone goes by here right? So chewing of someones head for making a observation is pointless.</br>  <br>My brother.</br>  <br>I like bunny barmaid.. Shame about her past, but wherever monstergirls go, there must also be suffering.</br>  <br>That cute medusa does things to me.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>the plot is:<br> enemy middle age retards attack japan <br> japan wins <br> endless fantasy harem </br></br></br></br>  <br>friendly reminder that we get dragontits</br>  <br> mangacucks.com </br>  <br>It's like /k/+bad version of Monmusu.

I wonder how far it will get though, the manga has been getting steadily worse.</br>  <br>Okay, bye now.</br>  <br>The manga is fine. Given 12 episodes this might reach until Italica. The dark elf isn't there so I don't think it will reach her.</br>  <br>Now imagine her in cat-ear shaped ribbons and maid outfit<br><br>Because I'm placing bet that that's what we're gonna get</br></br></br>  <br>That's because it's getting bogged down in politics.</br>    <br>They just killed a dragon and hung its head on the palace as a warning. Doesn't sound like being bogged down to me.</br>  <br> not liking the scheming bunny queen <br> not liking dragon fight <br> not liking dragon tits <br> not liking the new loli <br> not excited for the prince's uprising <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you<br>It's been steadily getting better and better.<br>Or do you prefer more Japan arc with yankchinkruskie agents getting owned?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's actually been less and less politics you cunt<br>stop trying</br></br>  <br>Well that's true. But the chapters before, and the most recent chapter are politics heavy.</br>  <br> Americans. <br><br>What've they got to do with anything?</br></br></br>  <br>Woah calm down. You get 2 chapters of Dragon fighting, and 6 chapters of politics, and you tell me I'm "trying".</br>  <br> The manga is fine. <br>Not to me, it seems to me to be getting a bit too silly. I keep thinking "that's not how I would have done it" too many times.<br><br> Given 12 episodes this might reach until Italica. <br>I really hope it ends with the explosion of the imperial senate. The manga was great until that point (when they weren't on Earth).<br><br><br>I like those things, but as I said above, I keep thinking "that's not how I would have done it" too many times. I don't know, maybe it's the pacing or translation that's throwing me off, I'm just not enjoying it as much as the earlier chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Let's end this war <br> fuck that shit pops let's fight <br> keikaku doori <br><br>You call this "too much politics"?<br>Hell you even consider this "politics"?<br><br>What the fuck do you watch, Tiny Toons?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the diplomacy banquet was mostly about the kid who's infatuated with the nip. You're talking politics in the most generous of terms.</br>  <br>I assumed from the untranslated scans it was all politics, my fault.</br>  <br> I keep thinking "that's not how I would have done it" too many times. <br>If you're looking for a self insert series may I recommend Sword Art Online?<br><br> I really hope it ends with the explosion of the imperial senate. The manga was great until that point (when they weren't on Earth). <br>It happened after they went to Earth. The only things that happened before Japan were Ginza and Italica. If you've really read the manga then you haven't been paying attention.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really need to relax.</br>  <br>Technically it is all politics so you're not all wrong. Just that it's not the boring politics.</br>  <br><br>I was kind of wondering the same thing. Something about the style of the trailer makes it feel like they're trying to turn this into the next SAO or something. Didn't it just come from some guys web novel originally too just like SAO. I admit I know very little about it despite it looking like one of the shows Aniplex is hyping the shit out of for this Summer. It's going in their Saturday blockbuster slot isn't it? The one where they take out an extra block ahead of time and force the staff and cast to say how it's going to be the most awesome thing ever. I still remember Hayamin being forced to talk about how complex her character was for Mahouka a week before it aired.</br></br>  <br>There's been 6 chapters of hunting the dragon, 1 chapter of bunny girl's past and assassination attempt, 0 chapter of "politics". <br><br>Stop. Trying.</br></br></br>  <br><br>First episodes of A-1 things usually don't look too terrible. It's after the first couple that it becomes a crap shoot. Is this split cour? Anyone know?</br></br>  <br>You think a trained soldier, captain of a recon squad, in his 30s, divorced once, being a Kirito?<br><br>That's actually pretty hard to accomplish.</br></br></br>  <br>That's my fetish, anon. MY fetish. It's right up there next to sex hair.</br>  <br>Trying what?</br>  Itami is sorta like crossing Kyon from Haruhi with little bit of Kotetsu from Tiger &amp; Bunny<br>Nothing like Lord and Savior Kirito or SASUGA ONIISAMA</br>  <br> based namefag <br>there's some new short PV's for the Gate anime with the VAs of the 3 main girls<br><br>Rory:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/Oju_4ogaXv4  [ ] [Embed]<br><br>Lelei:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/aFcnws9V3-c  [ ] [Embed]<br><br>Tuka:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/0fCePGfghVs  [ ] [Embed]<br><br>and a longer one for Itami:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/1itoFiQtoco  [ ] [Embed]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would assume stop trying to talk out of your ass.</br>  <br>I never understood some people's beef with politics in anime. I can understand if you just don't like it, but to actively hate it like some of the people here is weird. That's why I liked GitS too. But it's just anime people. Political intrigue can make the story more exciting. It doesn't have to be able the girls all the time.</br>  <br>how are you not dead yet</br>  <br> If you're looking for a self insert series <br>I'm not, I'm looking for better plot<br><br> It happened after they went to Earth <br>You seem confused about what I wrote there. I'm aware that the senate explosion is after they went to earth, hence "when they weren't on Earth". I'm hoping it will get to that point in the story, though that may be a bit too much ground to cover.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can kinda sorta understand if it's heavyhanded and the audience has IQ of a toad, but...<br>This is on the level of "holy shit a KING just said something! Too much politics!!" level of retardedness.</br></br>  <br>*about<br><br>Damn tablet.</br></br></br>  <br> It's the core reason why adaptations, remakes, revisions so on and so forth always suck ass <br>The GameCube Resident Evil remake.</br></br>  <br>You don't see people hating on other anime politics just here. I just think it's because their country's spec ops got their ass kicked in a fictional book. Much easier to think about it that way than to listen to their mental gymnastics that are their justifications.</br>  <br>Rory's seiyuu is magnificent.<br><br>Don't know what they were thinking with Lelei's hair, though.</br></br></br>  <br>You really need to stop saying stupid shit.</br>  <br>They need to get over it then. I'm from the states and I can give two shits if our military was owned in some manga. Its part of the damn story. Although realistically that whole chapter didn't amount to anything in the end. Was just a glorified hot spring chapter.</br>  <br> I'm not, I'm looking for better plot <br>Then I'm sorry you're not going to find self-insert in here. No matter what you think there's no guarantee you'll act what you claim to do if you're in the MC shoes.<br><br> I'm hoping it will get to that point in the story <br>My bad. I'm pretty sure this will only be 12 episodes. I hope I'm wrong and it reaches the point you're saying. But the recent chapter is awesome. I found the dragon hunt boring, maybe because of lack of exposition and rushing through the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  how many episode will it be?<br>is there any info in the nico live?</br>  <br>You have an excellent mindset. I hope your countrymen learn from you.  Completely serious I hate the /pol/ shitposting that happens every Gate thread. </br>  <br>1. Yanks are notoriously ignorant of ancient European history<br>2. The ignorant troll posts are coming from butthurt yanks<br><br>You can put the two together</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have low expectations. But I'll be giving it a shot.<br><br>Please let there be gun porn.</br></br></br>  <br>They live so long, the odds of a pure elf are very low. She could be 200 for all we know.</br>  <br>Is it from girlz und panzer I didn't think that had modern tanks</br>  <br><br><br>I'm excited because it will be the most trolled/shitposted series we've had in a while. We'll have genuinely butthurt Americans, falseflagging butthurt Americans who are probably Australians and GATE fanboys who will blame everything on butthurt Americans. It'll be non-stop shitflinging</br></br></br>  <br> falseflagging butthurt Americans who are probably Australians </br>  <br>Nice fallacy, bruh.</br>  <br> he doesn't know Canadians took the global shitposting title </br>   There are literally <br> right now <br> metaphorically <br> geographically <br> at this very moment <br> people who don't think and accept witches <br><br>Being smart feels so good. You can observe the common rabble from your ivory tower and laugh at their delusions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could you not accept a face like this?  <br>This weekend, I'm gonna go to LA, and say that right to R07's face.<br>What then, wiatches?</br></br>  <br>We should compile a list of questions for you to ask for us.</br>  <br>Ask him what is Featherines relationship with Hanyuu and whether Hanyuu purposely locked Rika in a loop</br>  Magic aint real.  <br> wasn't hanyu just helping rika survive because all her power could manage was reset the events holy shit don't make me reread the whole thing again </br>  <br>Maybe you're already .. busy?</br>  <br>Oh and another one, was the decision for Iwahime to be ADV style rather than what he usually writes a financial decision or was it influenced by something else?</br>  <br>He mentioned Featherine and Hanyuu's relationship in some character commentaries years back.  Featherine hit her head and turned into Hanyuu, basically. <br><br>Hanyuu was responsible for Rika looping back and time over and over, but didn't orchestrate the events of her death. She was an irresponsible douchebag, but not malicious.</br></br></br>  <br> that spoiler <br>So time is different for Hanyuu/Featherine? Since Seacats take place after Higurashi, you'd expect Featherine to come after Hanyuu</br></br>  <br>I think it's supposed to be that Featherine existed, became Hanyuu, then turned back. Either that or Hanyuu branched off and became a new memory.<br><br>It's vaguely referenced in EP8 when Lambda muses about how once, in the past, Featherine took heavy damage to her memory disk and it created a bug in her existence.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you ask him if he thinks he would ever do anything Umineko-related again or if he's washed his hands of it completely? I still dream of that fandisc he promised years ago but never delivered on.</br>  It's time  Let's try and get some discussion going. Rank your favorite episodes, anons.  <br>3&gt;7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;2&gt;5&gt;8&gt;1&gt;6</br>  <br>Go home Willard<br><br><br>3&gt;5&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;4&gt;8&gt;7</br></br></br></br>  <br>To answer my own question:<br><br>4 &gt;= 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; ep8 manga &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 8 VN &gt; 6<br><br>The manga version of EP8 really is that much of an improvement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest I loved the atmosphere of 1-4, especially 1, but the other episodes were quite fun as well.</br>  <br>How could anyone not believe in witches? Does Ryukishi have to hold your hand?</br>  <br>4 &gt; 5 &gt; 8 &gt; 7 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 1</br>  Chaos witches  <br><br>5 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 1 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 &gt; 8<br><br>It's honestly hard to rank them though. In terms of story I think 1 and 3 were the best. 4 and 6 had the best character development. 7 had based Willard as the protagonist and even 8 was extremely comfy and had a great final battle. For me I like 5 the most because it had the the best and dare I say epic moments of the series. 5 also possessed a real sense of desperation and unpredictability that kept me on the edge the whole time.</br></br></br></br>    <br> ranking 2 higher than 7 and 8 but not even mentioning it in your breakdown. </br>   I enjoyed the anime <br><br> Tsukihime anime aswell </br></br>  <br>It's not 2011 anymore. Keep that Costanza face to yourself. 2 Is great for Mousou Rosa.</br>  <br><br>Take me to the Golden Land, Gohda-san.</br></br>  <br> It's no secret that there are people with no standards </br>  <br> making fun of Dlanor's face. <br><br>Erika would be disappointed in you.</br></br></br>  <br> Not making fun of Satsujinki ningyou <br>It's almost like you don't enjoy bullying or something.</br></br>  <br> I enjoyed the latter as well, even if I watched it after reading the VN 6 or so years ago , but how did you possibly like the Umineko anime? It was my introduction to seacats, but I avoided the VN / manga like the plague for 2 years or so because of it.</br>  <br>5&gt;6&gt;1&gt;2&gt;3&gt;7&gt;4&gt;8<br><br>Erika a best.<br>Ange a worst.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I like 2 because it's the solid static point of the series. It's the good ol days of Umineko when it was just battler vs beato.</br>  So can we all agree that Black Battler is best boy?  <br>Fangirl pls. Battler is way better</br>  <br>This. It's not just a bad adaptation, it has some of the most cringe-worthy direction I've ever seen. Remember when Battler erased himself and Ange, Lambda, and Bern just stood there and watched with completely blank expressions?</br>  <br>no</br>  Your choice<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>Which one do you pick?</br></br></br></br>  <br>1</br>  <br>Masturbate furiously and loudly</br>  Has anyone of you ever presented the cheese riddle to anyone you know? Naturally everyone answers the usual way, but when you present them with the challenge that you can do it better, they start thinking deeper  <br>5 &gt;= 3 &gt; 8 (manga) &gt; 1 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 7<br><br><br>Ep7 must be the only one I genuinely didn't like. Even Ep6 who ends up in second to last was still really good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. I've presented both the cheese and the coin and cup riddles. They're neat little parlour tricks.</br>  <br>Posting best Seacat.</br>  <br>7 had its moments. The scene where Jessica discovers the shrine is spooky as fuck. The sub flashback was a good story by itself, and the battle of will vs bern with the executioner playing in the background was amazing.</br>  <br>I still stand by my original statement that that one Bloodborne track fits Bern perfectly</br>  <br>5 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 = 1 = 7 &gt; 6</br>  <br>Meh. Wright was a terrible main character and Lion made me feel nothing. The only actual good part was the flashback with young Kinzo and the first Beato.<br><br>Tea Party felt too forced. Sure, muh plot twist, but it was still about destroying two good character and making them assholes just because without any hint until then.</br></br></br>   Best calm ost <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EWP<wbr>BKAqJgsw</wbr>  [ ] <br>  UNTZiest ost <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=u_d<wbr>gUf8VHd8</wbr>  [ ]<br>Prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> making them assholes just because without any hint until then <br>Like a certain anon would say, it was on purpose, because usually in life there's no foreshadowing and since the ch7 tea party was mostly just on what happened in prime which was completely unlike what Yasu predicted would happen, you could say it was sort of fiction vs real life in my opinion</br></br>  <br>are you talking about bern? her monstrosity has been hinted since episode 1</br>  <br> without any hint <br><br>What bullshit. Kyrie was scary as fuck in episode 3 and has always been the smartest in-law.</br></br></br>  <br>Besterest calm ost<br> Golden sneer <br>Bestesterest UNTZ<br> The girls witch hunt </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohda, the true hero of Umineko.</br>  Anyone got a list of the ep8 riddles?  <br>You're not wrong and that could indeed have hapened irl, but here that's not really interesting.<br><br><br>Please, Bern has been a bitch since always, I'm obviously talking about Rudolf and Kyrie.<br><br><br><br>We saw that she was extremmely jealous in EP3. That made her pretty interestint with the contrast of her looking always calm.<br><br>In EP7 she's just a psychopath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Why do none of you like EP7? Do you all have ADD?  I want to deito Lucifer.  <br> the good ol days of Umineko <br>litelilly just one Episode</br></br>  <br> without any hints <br>I thought Kyrie was the murderer ever since the question arcs because she was that fucking shady.</br></br>  <br>Kyrie was jealous because she was cold whole the other woman was warm and girly. She reflected on how she could be useful as a partner and ruthless as an individual, but this wasn't what Rudolph wanted out of woman. Then you have her chess board methodical views. If you take away the view that she's a loving mom then all you really have is a sociopathic woman.</br>  <br>what would be the number two choice out of the stakes?</br>  <br>Too bad you're totally wrong since she wasn't the murderer in any game. Prime might as well have been Ghoda being the bad guy, it wouldn't have changed anything.</br>  <br>My point was that she was cold-blooded as fuck and it fit her personality. No, not like Gohda at all.</br>  <br>Lucifer &gt; Belphegor &gt; Leviathan &gt; Satan &gt; Mammon &gt; Asmodeus &gt; Beelzebub</br>  Did Featherine and the white haired Battler fuck?  <br>well, even it it was true that she never really cared for her, she seemed to be a good mother to Ange, at least neither Ange nor Rudolf or Battler said anything that would prove otherwise.</br>  <br>Mammon &gt; Belphegor &gt; Lucifer &gt; Leviathan &gt; I can't even remember the rest</br>  <br>There was nothing to prove that she really was all that great of a mother, either. I think you're just mad because you liked her and didn't want her to be evil.</br>  <br> We saw that she was extremmely jealous in EP3. That made her pretty interestint with the contrast of her looking always calm. <br>  <br> In EP7 she's just a psychopath. <br><br><br>Mate, she went on a monologue about jealousy before murdering a stake in cold blood. I mean, I know it was self-defense, but she clearly wasn't balking at the idea of taking a life. You should have realized during that scene just how scary Kyrie really was. Contrast her behavior with how Natsuhi and Rosa behaved with the gun in previous episodes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are the black haired stakes so perfect ?</br>  <br>Actually i'm not the guy you were talking with before.<br>I just said Kyrie, psycho or not, was able to be a perfectly fine person if she wanted to. I neither particularly like nor hate Kyrie, but she at least had her emotions a bit better under control than lets say Rosa.</br></br>  <br>That's the thing though, there's just about no scenes between Ange and Kyrie. All we have are Ange's memories from when she was a little impressionable girl, as well as the biased constructed stories of what went down those days.</br>  <br> Why are the black haired girls so perfect ? <br>It's a natural law.</br></br>  Dlanor a CUTE.  <br>I think she would remember if Kyrie constantly showed her the cold shoulder or mistreated her, though.<br>She may not have been the best mother, but Ange seems to have had a fairly normal childhood until the events of Umineko.</br></br>  <br>What kind of "tools" are in that pocket?</br>  <br>You mean Ikuko Hachijo and Tohya(Battler)?</br>  <br>Who wants to KNOW?</br>    I want to go to the beach with the Stakes.  <br>If they start smoking weed, will the stakes be high?</br>  <br>sociopaths always put up a mask of charm and charisma. it's simple to fool a child.</br>  <br>I want to snuggle up on a bed between Erika and Dlanor.</br>  enter the mansion, see this. What do?  <br> not Mammon and Ange </br>  <br>Best taste.</br>    <br>Lucifer is so delicious, god damnit.</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget the scene where Kinzo apologizes to Sayo/Beatrice with Bring the Fate playing? It's the most satisfying scene in the entire series.</br>  <br><br><br>Someone ask him why he was red-herring so fucking hard with Rosa.</br></br></br>    <br> angetrice </br>  <br>Hnnnnnggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</br>    <br><br>My niggers.</br></br>  <br>Fuck Alchemist and their once in a life available lewd goodies.</br>  <br>Zawa zawa</br>  <br>But the only witches that actually exist are the voyagers, Lambda and Bern - witches that are "birthed" like Beatrice are simply metaphoric. Beato is an insane, castrated, incest child.</br>  <br>Oh nice, that's the best scan so far.</br>  Reminder that we'll never get an adventure RPG dtective pirate sim with Erika and the 7 stakes.<br><br>Hello darkness my old friend</br></br>  <br>I had a huge scan someone did of it a long time ago before my pictures got deleted</br>  <br>Oh god, damnit, anon.<br><br>Any keywords for an archive search?</br></br></br>  <br>I also have this one that shows the whole thing but it's in low res and shitty jpg quality.</br>  <br>No idea.

Sprites.</br>  <br>Make your own sprites</br>  <br>Cause she's the best Waifu material.Confirmed by Rudolf.<br> You will never return home from a hard day at work where Belphegor tells you to relax wanting to take good care of you. <br><br><br>The fuck would that be like?<br>Mammon would just want you for herself pissing off Satan while Belphegor doesn't give a fuck and just pleases you which again triggers Mammon and the circle begins again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    See this.<br>What do.</br>  <br> Jessica pickpocketing Satan </br>    <br> maria doujin <br>For shame anon<br>For shame</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Best Umineko non-safe doujin.</br>  <br>3&gt;5&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;4&gt;8&gt;7</br>  <br>Call Jessica and Rosa.<br>Tell them Battler left his "magazines" lying around again and Maria found it.<br>Lay back, relax, optionally with Belphegor, and watch Battlers demise.</br></br></br>   tfw the only one who thinks Higanbana is the best think 7th expansion has made   <br>But it's not?</br>  3 &gt; 5 &gt; 4 &gt; 7 &gt; 1 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 8<br>This is a factual inequality.</br>  <br>It was great but I wouldn't call it the best.<br> Because Higurashi 6,7 and Umineko 3 are. </br></br>  5&gt;3=6&gt;1&gt;8&gt;7&gt;2&gt;4  <br>It's not the best, but it's very good.</br>  <br> 2 so low <br>What a homo</br></br>  What makes EP3 so good?<br>Evatrice?Kyrie and Rudolf?Closed Room Circle?</br>    <br>I've noticed that short, blonde girls and nearly any girl with a deformity are invariably rage-inducing.</br>        <br>Go to bed Touma</br>    <br> implying <br>She was the hero this anime deserved.</br></br>      <br>why do they always have their arms extended for concept art?</br>  <br>Touma never hit Othinus</br>   He had made his way up to her, but he did not clench his fist as he moved his red-stained arm. Rather than punching, he embraced her slender body in both arms.  <br><br>Not even Touma would punch her and deny her kindness.</br></br>  <br>Your mom-chan</br>  <br>yet</br>  <br>need more punch.</br>    The entire cast of Cross Ange.      <br><br>For presentation purposes.</br></br>  What is all of them?  <br> But not the one it needs right now. </br>  <br>Nah, she doesn't deserve a punch, she deserves  car sex </br>      <br> punching someone the TouMAN wont punch <br>She is a certified kind person and is living her life correctly.</br></br>  This bitch here! The other seasons just dropped on bluray and I really want to see what happens to the other characters and how the world works but I just can't take any more of this twat.    <br><br>she definitely deserve a punch <br> prepared carefully with fresh fruits and a slight amount of alcohol so she doesn't notice getting drunk while we play VNs through the night </br></br></br>  Crabs will try defend this.  Crabs can't use computers.  <br>/thread</br>  <br>This.</br>    <br>Fuck off asshole, she's pure!</br>    <br> not laughgingdonkey.png <br><br>You had one job, my good m/a/non, one job.</br></br></br>  <br>She had good taste. Kaiki is cute. What's the problem?</br>  Second season when?  <br> perfect ending <br> second season <br>????</br></br></br>  <br>Never. Now tell me which haibane you'd fuck.</br>  <br>None of them, they all stink of cigarette smoke. Especially their wings.</br>  <br><br>Theyre too pure to fuck. Go take that shit somewhere else perv</br></br>  <br>Get out.</br>  Does anyone know where I can read this?  <br>Have to get Despera out of the way first.</br>  Reki &gt; Kana &gt; Nemu &gt; Rakka &gt; Kuu &gt; Hikari  <br>Real talk, watching Haibane Renmei saved my life. I was depressed as hell til I watched it and it got my life back on track. I watch it every few months and it always comforts me.</br>    <br>Reki &gt; Rakka &gt; Hikari &gt; Nemu &gt; Kana &gt; Kuu</br>  Despera 2016 release, who else with me ?  <br>Why wouldn't you fuck all of them? Are you gay?</br>  <br><br>The dream is still alive</br></br>  <br>I'm not a pedophile.<br>Also, their wings are a sign of uncleanliness. They're people and deserve respect, but they need to live apart from the rest of working society. It is the will of god.</br></br>  <br>Who will be new director?</br>  <br><br>Mah nigga</br></br>  So of the "big 3", for me:<br><br>Texhnolyze &gt; Lain &gt; HR, though HR is by no means bad at all. It's a beautiful show.</br></br>  Haibane &gt; Kino &gt; lain &gt; Tex  <br>I want to cum on her halo.</br>    Not possible. If there was a second season, it would be shit like Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino.  <br>Their going to get 90s era Mamoru Oshii to do it and its going to be the best anime ever!</br>  <br>In all seriousness, has there been any other news since the new director thing?</br>  <br>http://apgnation.com/articles/2015/<wbr>06/23/17832/interview-with-screenwr<wbr>iter-chiaki-j-konaka</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> perfect ending <br><br>more like it ended right as shit was finally getting started</br></br></br>  DO. NOT. MAKE. HR OR TEX THREADS ON /a/.<br><br>All you're going to get are degenerates shitposting stuff like this  &gt; MAL plebs who didn't understand it calling it "pretentious pseudo-intellectual shit" and zero actual discussion about it.</br></br>  <br>Where else am I going to talk about them? These threads can get pretty comfy</br>  <br>I'll say again like I said the last time you made this comment. 99% of HR and Tex threads have better, more civil discussion and less shitposting than most of the threads on this board.</br>  <br> impying <br><br>Learn from history: https://archive.moe/a/thread/121563<wbr>344/<br><br>The only ABe-related thing okay to discuss here is Lain.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>retard</br>  <br>That shit thread was doomed from the start</br>  <br>It was still one of the worst threads ever made on this board. <br><br>/a/ is full of retarded faggots from MAL. Tex, HR and Lain all have a relatively low score there because MALshitters are pleb idiots.</br></br></br>  <br> a bait thread going to shit <br>Gee</br></br>  <br>Yes. And to keep it that way people should stop making these threads EVERY FUCKING DAY.</br>  <br>They did.</br>  <br>They don't happen every fucking day. It's a miracle if we get one that lasts more than 2 hours.</br>  why gilgamesh so unlikable in UBW but had class and honor in zero?  <br><br>This is great thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>A Shirou buffed like Kuzuki would probably be OP, but I'd still read it. Caster the best.</br>  <br>And then, Harem route with RB for recruit Saber and Rider.</br>  <br> it just tells you that he likes her, most of their development being off-screen <br><br>I'm not arguing for the quality of F/SN's writing or Nasu's storytelling. This is simply the context of the narrative.<br><br> Based on the context from the entire game he should still place Taiga's safety higher. <br><br>Love isn't something inherently based on the amount of time one has known someone else. It is wholly possible for Shirou to have known Sakura for less time and yet feel more strongly for her than Fuji-nee.<br><br><br> Shirou giving his everything for a love that you don't even know is worth it. <br><br>We know for a fact that Sakura has feelings for Shirou. This shouldn't even be in question. IT'S SPRING AGAIN should prove that if nothing else.<br><br>I agree, however, that the story would be better if Sakura's strife for Shirou was more emphasized.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127373006#p127395352">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon!<br><br><br><br><br>Picture, "Unlimited Bait Works", isn't usable.<br>Other Anon's pic folder and mine are different.
