[ Orchestr/a/ turns 1 year old today, and we're celebrating by releasing our very first album.<br><br>MP3 - https://mega.co.nz/#!zJNF0AyB!UXJxp<wbr>kBovjS7N0QmyytAb9TBZ-DysosVweWeflam<wbr>k2A<br>FLAC - https://mega.co.nz/#F!qVEylRZI!rr1L<wbr>md4U2KkqlKgp43Er-w<br>MF Mirror [MP3] - http://www.mediafire.com/?1t9nxjqym<wbr>sebsil<br>YouTube: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6<wbr>yF7Kh4DY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>A huge thanks goes out to all of the /a/nons who made this possible.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Looks great, thanks. <br><br>Wanted to join in but I had non stop classes during times when threads were up. And I didn't have my instrument with me.</br></br></br>  To celebrate the album release (and Canada day tomorrow), I'm going to play the first few seconds of any anime song you link me (badly), just like in the original thread where this all began.  <br>skipped around for a minute then had to turn off. is everyone on /a/ who can play an instrument still in grade school? or did you just let your imouto play?<br><br>Also this has nothing to do with anime.</br></br></br>  Though we just finished our first album, we're already working on tons of tracks for the next one. But we need YOUR help to finish them. If you play an instrument, come join us at our pad. There is bound to be something you can record, and if not, you can double a part or request one to be written for you. <br><br>**STRINGFRIENDS AND LOWREEDFRIENDS IF YOU'RE OUT THERE, PLEASE JOIN**<br><br>https://titanpad[.]com/orchestra</br></br></br></br>  <br>3.7/10</br>  <br>10/10 - It's shit.</br>  <br>Some are fine, some are horrendous.

I wish I was a part of that, since it's one of our best ones, but I have no idea what you're mistaking for a clarinet.</br>  <br><br>even obscure shit like peruvian box or triangle?</br></br>  <br>yeah, probably. the website isn't the best but it's free</br>  <br>I enjoyed it very much. Good work, all, does my heart good.</br>  <br>Bravo.</br>  <br>It dies even without anything happening, just wait a while and it'll come back.</br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0WwXkS8hXw9</br>  I think a lot of these pieces could be significantly improved with better mastering.<br><br><br>I'll for a day or two.</br></br></br>  pad is kill  Is this the new John Meyer album?  This is great background music for the sexual assault course I'm taking.  <br>peruvian box (cajon) is played in the hanymata track, nothing is too obscure.</br>  <br>Even sleighbells and [people sounds].</br>  <br>What happened with you in 0:42?</br>  <br>You're right, it's too high pitched to be a clarinet, it's probably a melodica.</br>  <br>low notes wouldn't come out</br>  <br>Can you sing Yuusou from Getter Robo Armaggedon?</br>  I'll wait til the hype dies, then I'll probably join you guys, as long as you'll be fine with me. For now the site is kill anyway.<br><br>Two questions though:<br>1. What mic do you recommend for recording?<br>2.  I suck, is that okay? </br></br></br></br>  <br>1. Fuck proper equipment, I'm using my laptop mic and there's a dude using his iphone<br>2. We all suck, did you not listen to the album? We only sound good because of our mixers.</br></br>  <br>1. People literally record with iphone mics. We don't care but if actually want to spend money then snowballs are fine.<br><br>2. Yep, we all suck too.</br></br></br>  <br>Site's back up.<br>1. whatever you have, as long as there's no static and no clipping<br>2. Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>I need to learn an instrument.</br>  Now that you guys have had a chance to listen to the album,<br>https://strawpoll.me/4790805</br>  <br>This? http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ABcuRLqvU1</br>  <br>There's no better day to get started than today, /a/non.</br>   mfw Wareta ringo <br><br>Renai Circulation was kinda whack it looked like someone was licking the mic<br><br>8/10 nice job faggots</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, one of our arrangers is posting an arrangement of pani poni dash OP2 tommorow, that has bari sax. will you stop by the pad please?</br>  Maybe one day I'll contribute, I'd really like to.

As it is now it hurts my ears. Enjoy.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll try to be more on the ball with threads this year, so you'll have more chances!<br>Hopefully your timetable sorts itself out.</br></br>  We're going to livestream the whole album soon. Come listen with us: cytu*be/r/Orchestr_a_ (replace * with .)  i hope you like it/even recognize the song http://vocaroo.com/i/s0mDs6Y71hH0  <br>Big guy and the seven bitches.</br>  Figure this is a relevant enough place to ask<br><br>what is the youtube of that dude always making threads for his music? it's vocaloid</br></br>  Our version of trainroll now playing at   <br>This has a surprisingly high amount of quality to it</br>  this is fun, who knows this one? http://vocaroo.com/i/s0M5bwalVhgw  <br>misakoisaqt, but he's not affiliated with orchestr/a/ in any way, shape, or form.</br>    <br>headpats for Rio</br>  <br>Next season, anon, next season. There are a couple Nobuyuki fans around.</br>  <br>Thank you</br>  That SSY one is masterful   1 year old <br><br>where does the time go.</br></br>   Electric guitar station    that recorder at the end of Tank <br><br>My sides</br></br>  Good job. I volunteered to play the flute for Wareta Ringo and even recorded it but never sent it in because it was awful ;_; I'm glad the flautist whose track you used was much better than mine was  <br>Keep on practicing, hopefully they'll write some easier parts that you can send in! Also  nice dubs </br>   That fucking reggae <br>10/10</br>  <br>My fucking sides, I wasn't expecting that.</br>  <br> Big guy and the seven bitches. <br>Here. http://vocaroo.com/i/s0u0N085FGSs<br><br><br>T-thanks, anon. But I'm sure your recording would've been great too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i-i'm glad you liked it, i snuck it in a shit mix one time as a place holder for the actual solo that was gonna go there, but everyone like it so we kept it</br></br>  <br>Album stream coming up soon get in here</br>  A little rough sometimes but I could certainly feel the emotions that were put into this. Thanks and GJ.  <br>Wow, thanks Jung! It's awesome.</br>  <br>Its almost as good as the Titanic Theme tune done on a recorder.</br>  <br>I'll keep practising so that one day I can play Chinese Cartoon music with everyone.<br><br> dat Kuchizuke Diamond <br>Fuck. Seriously, great job. I know that everyone says that it's okay to suck and still submit recordings but I'd much rather that they use yours/anyone who played it better than mine.</br></br></br></br>   streaming music   <br>For you</br>  This thread interests me but a friendly reminder that you don't need to use tripcodes for everyone to know what instrument you play  <br>duly noted friend</br>  <br>You can visit the pad any time. Some of the people get enthusiastic occasionally and do side projects so I'm sure we'll find something for you to record that you'll be content with.</br>  <br>That's why there are no tripcodes being used friend :^)</br>  <br>I added three to my list just from this thread</br>  <br>Doubling of parts can also happen.</br>  Just listened to the whole thing. I fucking loved it. Some of it was really good, some of it was pretty rough, but the whole thing was fun. The fact you shoved various instruments to take the place of vocals was pretty fucking funny (and even worked occasionally). A+, keep it coming guys,  <br>Well they're gay for using secure tripcodes anyway.</br>  <br><br>Guilty as charged, but I've seen people try to impersonate each other on these kinds of threads before, which is a pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>Only Clarinet uses a secure one though.</br>  <br> list <br>Why would you keep a list of trips?</br></br>  This shit is worse than /jp/'s compilation album  <br>Classic Guitar and Sax also use trips.<br><br><br> Not keeping track of wannabe e-celebs </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to my filter list</br>  Dat fucking Renai.  <br> worse <br>Worse is better with these tracks.</br></br>  <br> comparing an album of rerecordings to a mixtape <br>Well, I guess that's fair.</br></br>  <br>I know I do.</br>  <br>Sounds like an overreaction, but sure, whatever.</br>  <br> /jp/ album <br>I actually want to hear this, link?</br></br>  <br> not immediately filtering all trips who have no reason to be using a trip <br>It's made my life on 4chan a lot more enjoyable, that's for sure</br></br>  <br>Filters are for the weak.</br>  <br>moot was right, /a/ is indeed best girl!</br>  Imitation is really good, it sounds like the real thing except at a lower bit rate.  <br>moot?</br>  <br>There's an option to make everyone appear anonymous. Even then all the trips in this thread are harmless.</br>  <br> native anonymize filter <br> trips are actually useful (at least not harmful) for this thread </br></br>  <br>too soon</br>  <br>This is fucking beatiful</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/c<wbr>az9uuvan03c5z1/%EF%BC%8Fjp%EF%BC%8F<wbr>+Music+Compilation+One.7z</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>But I actively want to ignore tripfags, not just make everyone anonymous. Although it's true that I come from  /sp/  where trips are generally a lot worse. Still no real reason to use one here.</br>  <br>Trips have a way of talking that is very unlike other anonymous posters, they play it safe because they feel they might harm their internet rep and make internet personalities. Not to mention interactions between two tripfags.</br>  <br>I don't know why the link came out like that<br>http://www.mediafire.com/?caz9uuvan<wbr>03c5z1</wbr></br></br>  <br>It works either way, Anon.</br>  <br>I don't even use a trip outside of this thread when I normally post, how the fuck do I even have internet rep.</br>  There's an orchestr/a/!? How do I get in on this!?  <br>Sounds like you have personal experience with tripfagging.</br>  <br/>  <br>Please stop being a namefag and read the thread for your answer.</br>  <br> 222 <br>Nice trips brah</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's called spending any amount of time on any board of 4chan.</br>  <br>Uhm,<br>titanpad com/orchestra<br>when it's not down.</br></br></br>  Probably going to be redundant but it still lacks power from lacking musicians. <br><br>On the other hand it's pretty good, nisemono is perfect.<br><br>Still no pianist though?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A guitar has strings, r-right?</br>  <br>That sounds nothing like the trips on /a/. They're known for their shit taste and are hated even when their posts make sense, which rarely do.</br>  for the next cover you should have a section of rei clones  <br>We work with whatever we've got. Someday we hope to upgrade to philh/a/rmonic. <br><br>Also we have a few pianists  myself included, though I never record </br></br></br>  <br>The only /a/ tripfag I know of is Lelouch, everybody else seems to get harassed into oblivion.</br>  <br>It's tough to include piano in many arrangements.<br>There are a few that require a keyboard/piano part though, so if you're a pianist feel free to check them out. (Zoku Zoku from Hidamari and Penguindrum's first OP come to mind.)</br></br>  Alright, I'll try my hand at a few of the pieces that need trumpet. I need the motivation to start practicing again anyway.<br><br>The duet from Hibike looks fun.</br></br>  <br>I apologize, I am indeed a newfag. I read the first few posts then skipped to the bottom..</br>  <br>Mine doesn't ;_;<br>As with everyone else, drop in on the pad when it's not down and say hi.<br><br><br>Famously has piano, right? Pretty much the only thing it has :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Famously isn't happening anymore because certain people hate fun ;_;</br>  FUCK WHY DID I LEAVE MY BASS CLARINET AT HOME WHEN I MOVED<br><br>Who /marchingbandfag/ here?</br></br>    <br> 9 minutes of narration <br> fun </br></br>  <br>It better be a Buffet or Yamaha, or you're a fag.</br>  <br>Wow, some of those songs are actually pretty good. Didn't know /jp/ was capable of something like this.</br>  <br>Hey if it wasn't for Famously we never would have gotten those vocaroos. You know the ones.</br>  <br>Yamaha actually. Nice taste anon. I have an electric bass with me, but I'm sure there are better players than me.</br>   Masshiro world <br>This is glorious. Wish I could play an instrurment so I could join you faggots.</br>  <br>That's me! I played bass clarinet, but I'm broke. Had to use a school instrument. Still have a clarinet, tenor saxophone, a few flutes, a trumpet, and a trombone that I've aquired over the years, all I can at least make a noise on. I'm really a reedist though.</br>  <br>Today's a great day to learn anon.</br>  <br>Fuck I'm jealous. I'm in college and all I've got is a low level trumpet, but I would probably buy a whole orchestra's worth of instruments if I had the cash.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think my most liked track is Ascend, which is sampled from Blue by SoutaiseiRiron.</br>  <br>Sure. I'll be back at my parents house for the holidays which has a pretty nice piano so if you have any requests feel free to ask.</br>  <br>My mufuckin nigga. Too bad them shits expensive.</br>  <br>Shhhh, those are secret!</br>  <br>Which instrument should I learn. Lefty with a lefty guitar but no desire to learn it.</br>  The titanpad seems to be completely non-existant rather than just down. is there a fall back anywhere?  <br>Why on earth do you not have enough money for your main instrument but have a ton of other (also expensive) instruments?</br>  <br>l-lewd</br>  <br>hand me downs. nothing I have is great quality...</br>  <br>You're posting on an instrument right now, try starting with that. Piano is another good choice if you have the money for it.</br>  <br>My G3 is an instrument?

No point in buying an expensive instrument if you're not sure you'll practice it longer than a week.</br>  <br>Any idea where I can get some elaborate online lessons on guitar for free or cheap?</br>  <br>Youtube?</br>  Pad's going apeshit with all the new folks - join us on the cytube link if you're having woes getting on.  <br>/mu/ has a guitar general</br>  <br>justinguitar is usually pretty good for most people</br>  <br>If you're going to use your computer then it should be with a keyboard. It's better if it's only live performances.</br>  You guys looking for a harmonica guy?<br><br>I can play Fuura Kafuka (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Shingakki (1) (Azumanga Daioh), Après la pluie, le beau temps (Sora no Woto), Modokashii Sekai no Ue de (Piano) (Welcome to the NHK), Heionbuji [Slow Version] (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni),Yume Sekai (Sword Art Online)<br><br>I also suck mega ducks</br></br></br></br>  <br>try the guitar general threads on /mu/, they have a ton of resources</br>  <br>Hell no don't go there, all they talk about is gear and none of them know how to read music.</br>  <br>doesn't the OP have a bunch of links?</br>  <br> /mu/ <br> actual musicians <br>seriously, this orchestr/a/ had more legitimate musicians than they do.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh /mu/</br>  <br>This was a good listen, nice work.</br>  <br> none of them know how to read music <br>What is it with people and illiteracy? Music is easier than learning English, which they probably don't speak very proficiently anyway.</br></br>  <br>You can work without a keyboard, but a keyboard is definitely a good idea. If you have the money for a nice hardware synth, get one of those as well.</br>  <br>Why didn't you guys cover this? please cover it https://<span>youtu.be/4DilR3Ye8DI  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Guitarfags tend to care more about chord charts than actual sheet music. For casual playing, especially with popular tunes, chord charts are often more useful anyway.</br></br>  <br>This shit is bretty good.</br>  <br>There's a huge request dump at the bottom of our pad, this would be just one in dozens of other requests.<br><br><br>Maybe I'm just an elitist as fuck classical guitarist, but no guitarist who doesn't bother trying to learn how to read music is no musician. Hence, nobody on /mu/ is an actual musician.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not our fault arrangers hate us.<br> here's the chords and rhythm sheet, do that thing you always do </br></br>  <br>Now now, let anons make requests if they want. It's not as though the pad is consistently accessible right now anyway.</br>   That colors <br><br>I've always wanted to hear a shitty cover made by a bunch of NEETS and weaboos</br></br>  you all need to get some good mics i can hear no bass at all and it leaves it feeling flat  piano and classical guitar are the only ones committed from this though   <br>It's not the mics, we just don't have any bass players. Low brass is covered by literally one person.</br>  <br>You can't hear bass because we pretty much have one instrument in that range.</br>  <br>Good job.<br>Could you guys cover Uchuu Sekan yamato ?<br>The orchestral version would sound great.</br></br></br>  Terrible.   God Knows <br> Masshiro world <br><br>I love you /a/.

And that doesn't really have anything to do with the mixing.</br>  <br> dat guitar version of GuP </br>  <br>Can we also get more arrangers?</br>  I thought this was just going to be another /a/ Sings album, but this was much better.<br><br>Good job.</br></br>  <br> assuming </br>  <br>melodica</br>  <br> more arrangers <br>That might help us whittle down our huge requests list</br></br>  <br>It's a melodica. The player miscounted the rests and came in a bar (a couple seconds) early.</br>  I have a 10-year old Yamaha PSR-273 that has a dead B2 and with the rubber buttons essentially solidified from age.<br>I also have a Sousa Band No. 1010H harmonica, Bluesmaster 'A' harmonica, a Hohner Special 20 E, a Koch-Harmonica Chromatic 980/40, and Hohner Chromonica 270.<br>For recorders, I have a Sopranino Baroque 'B' and Alto recorders as well as a Welton and Angel 'B' recorder. I also have B and D tin whistles.<br>And finally, I have a Samick 'Artist Series Edition' electric guitar.<br><br>God damn.<br><br>I need to practice more though. I can't really use any of my harmonicas other than the first two and the recorders other than the Welton and Alto since those were previously owned by my grandfather before his passing (The Alto virtually untouched), and have smells of pipe tobacco in them, so I should probably try to get them cleaned out professionally.<br><br>Pic related: My electric looks almost exactly like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sis Puella Magica is actually pretty good.

I can play and read sheet music. is there someone who finds arranges for the group to play or is it all on an individual basis and then someone mixes in what sounds good and what doesn't? This sounds like it was a lot of fun.  <br>You're welcome to join us! <br><br>We have arrangers who either transcribe the original songs by ear or arrange them for whatever instruments we have available. We then have mixers put all of the good takes together.</br></br></br>  If anyone has a dog, we're currently planning to do the Excel Saga ending theme and could use some dog samples.<br><br><br>A little bit of both, but now it's mostly the first one. You can tell on the album which songs were arranged by an anon vs. the songs that were made by just everyone making up their own parts.<br>I'm pretty sure there are some bass parts that need recording, so feel free to give it a gander. If there aren't, there are bound to be some later on, so keep your eyes peeled for threads or lurk in the pad.</br></br></br></br>  Really good anons, maybe one day I`ll join you guys  <br>Where and when is the orgy?</br>  <br> Album Release <br> 1 year old today <br>You have no idea how moved I am right now. I promise I'll contribute more the coming year.</br></br></br>  Good work!  <br>All the time in Gensokyo.<br><br><br>Thanks for being around, look forward to more from you too.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Here's the part for dog.</br>  <br>I have a dog, what am I supposed to do here?</br>  <br>/a/ Sings is the poor man's Orchestr/a/.</br>  <br>I'd assume just make it bark and record it, he said he was after samples so he'll just change the pitch with some program.</br>  <br>tap it's head and the sounds come out</br>  <br>Good, I'll get some tomorrow, since everyone is sleeping.<br><br><br> like my dogs give enough of a fuck to bark at a head tap <br>I'll recruit black guy, they hate them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just wanna say it feels good to be in the background comments</br>  Sadly lacks in the best instrument that's  piano .  <br>There are many songs that has piano though?</br>  <br>All songs have piano if you try hard enough.<br><br>It just overpowers most other instruments when it appears where it shouldn't.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what you're trying to say.</br>  <br>That more songs with pianos would be cool.</br>  Why are the K-ONs so sexy?  K-Oners aren't my cup of Tea. But nothing special.  I want to gangbang the K-ONs with /a/!  Because KyoAni already mutated the characters so much from their original forms that nobody gives a fuck what you do to them anymore.    <br>I want to lick anon's cum off of Yui's butt.</br>  <br>I do too, Anon. I want to watch and fap to Anon getting a K-ON all sweaty, and creamy with their cum. Then lick them both clean afterwards.</br>  They're like shapeless blobs of jello.  DONT SEXUALIZE THE K-ONS  <br>Gosh that's hot. I'd like to position my mouth under a Keion's pussy while they're being fucked and catch all the cum and Keion juices in my mouth.</br>  <br>I want to bury my face in Anon's butt and give him a passionate rimjob while he fucks the K-ON of his choice.</br>  Mugi is a miracle of the universe  <br>She's the best and the sexiest K-ON.</br>  <br><br><br>delete this</br></br></br>  <br>I want to lick the tip of Anon's cock while he's getting a thighjob from a K-on</br>  <br>threadly remidner that mugi is the worst k-on</br>  <br>I want Anon to pound my ass from behind while I makeout with a K-ON's crotch.</br>  <br>See you in the park in 5 minutes. Consider your furniture dusted.</br>  <br>Because artists that are far better than the ones working on the actual show, make doujins of the Keions getting fat nuts busted in their faces and mouths but ugly old fat guys. <br><br>Seriously though Shiwasu no Okina renditions of K-ON better than the show, by far.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd do that for you anon. Just make sure you make a sloppy mess of the K-on's crotch.</br>  They were built for sex, especially Yui  <br> ribbed sweaters </br>  <br>Gladly! I'm sure we could have some lewd fun together. Thinking about it is making me hard.</br>  I love Mio!  It's July here, but I just remembered the end of Jun.  <br>I want to sniff Jun's butt.</br>  <br>Same here, I'm sure your butt would feel lovely too.</br>  <br> Have any fun fetishes, anon? </br>  <br> I can get into pretty much anything, but what sounds really hot is sharing a hole with an anon. It would be tight and slippery and we'd be able to feel each other's dicks rubbing together. </br>  <br> I'm the same mostly, though I do have a few fetishes that really get me going. Sharing a hole together sounds like a lot of fun. Which K-ON and which hole? I'd love to share with you. </br>  Did this just turn into a fucking Tinder thread?  <br> Probably Mugi's pussy or Yui's butt. Mugi would feel soft and pliant. Yui's butt would be tight and the pressure on our dicks would be amazing. </br>  <br>Pretty sure this is just ERP.<br><br>Get back on topic mongrels.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently...</br>  <br> Good choices. Mugi is my favorite anime girl, and Yui is lovely too. I've got a major butt fetish, so sharing Yui's butt together would get me going so crazy. Feeling our throbbing cocks rubbing together inside Yui's tight ass, our  balls  rubbing together as we thrust inside her. </br>  <br> So very true. The heads would be slick with precum too. So we would slide right into her and with the balls rubbing together we could tell when the other is ready to cum. With the help of Yui's moans it wouldn't take long either. </br>  <br> I hope you wouldn't mind me licking Yui's butt clean after we get done with her. </br>  <br> I wouldn't mind, it would make for a great treat afterwards. And I'm sure Yui would enjoy it. </br>  <br> I would love to have one of the K-ONs sit on my face while you rail my bottom. There are so many kinky things we could do together. </br>   2015 <br> still sexualizing the keions  <br>When will you monsters stop?</br></br>    <br> I'd make you moan into the Keion's butt so that they squirm around, causing your nose to rub against their hole. </br>  <br> 2015 on /a/ <br> Not sexualizing anime girls </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Room for one more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's so naughty. Butt sniffing is my biggest fetish, so feeling a sweaty K-ON butthole rub against my nose as you pound my tight butt would be the ultimate pleasure. </br>  <br>  No problem anon! </br>  <br>They go to a girl's school.<br>You know they talk about cock all day long.<br>I bit Mugi has tasted Finnish dick before.</br></br></br>  <br> You're fun, anon. </br>  <br> It's always fun to be lewd with other anons. </br>  <br> I agree. I don't even really fap to porn anymore. I can really only get off when I fap with other Anons and friends. It's so much more exciting. </br>  <br> Not him but I'm fapping to you two right now </br>  If we could please keep my waifu away from you shitty sweaty neckbeards, that would be great.  <br> That's naughty, Anon! I wouldn't mind having some fun with you too. Though I don't know how long this thread will last. These tend to get deleted fairly quickly. </br>  <br> I agree, the thought of other anons pumping their cocks while writing lewd posts gets me really hard. <br><br><br> Don't stop! </br></br></br></br>  <br> It's the best. Being lewd with others is so exciting. Nothing compares to how horny it gets me. </br>  Spoiler so much this shit looks like a redacted report on ayys<br><br>Post more butts</br></br>  <br>Just continue in /ghost/</br>  What the fuck kind of thread did I just come into?  Director's cut when?  <br>July 3 at the earliest, as far as I know.</br>  I miss her ;_;  <br>We'll just have to trust that Nihei does the right thing, anon.</br>  <br>Goddamn Daiz</br>  <br> Nihei already forgot about that one crate with Toha logo on it. </br>  <br>I thought he created this manga just so he can draw Tsumugi?</br>  <br>The right thing would be NOT to validate the unhealthy obsession Nagate shows for a girl who died years ago</br>  <br>I really doubt that Nihei has forgotten about her. If anything, his involvement with the anime should have refreshed his memory.<br><br><br>It was all for sweet interspecies love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Toha does mechs, not chimeras. Ochiai is away and even if Tsumugi proved it can work, Kanata was hard to deal with. <br>Enajiro 2 will maybe end up as kabi factory unless some drastic changes happen.</br></br>  <br>The right thing to do would be to at least get somewhere with the extra placenta sample waiting somewhere in Sidonia, which he could simply have killed off otherwise. Not saying she would necessarily have to "become" Hoshijiro (although I would prefer that, and think it would be fitting considering some of the show's themes), but at least that plotline has to go somewhere.<br><br><br> unless some drastic changes happen <br>I trust you have read the latest few chapters. I'd call those drastic changes. I could definitely see her make a return in the foreseeable future.</br></br></br></br></br>  S3 better be faster paced with a lot more action.  <br> S3 </br>  <br> I could definitely see her make a return in the foreseeable future. <br>Maybe Yure could pull it off with all the Ochiai's research unlocked but that would take time and they don't really have that right now.<br> drastic changes <br> Heh, I never though I'd see spaceship get a blowjob. <br><br> tsunbot <br> all the preparations for final battle <br>When that happens S3 will have a slow start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would take time and they don't really have that right now <br>I think they'll at least have to take some time to recover before really taking on the LMUS.</br></br>  <br><br>there won't be a s3 until the manga ends</br></br>  <br>The real question is why wouldn't the LMUS just rek them entirely at this point, it has clearly started the offense, so why would it stop when it has only expended a very small fraction of its forces? Kobayashi's plan relies on the fact that they don't get steamrolled, they can't wait around until 10 supersized Gaunas show up to suck on Sidonia. Then there's Ochiai who clearly wishes them harm and is amply equipped with a long-range as fuck weapon to inflict it and is also much smarter than the Gauna.</br>  <br>Well, seems like we'll find out what's going on with Nagate, Izana and Tsumugi next time, so we'll probably have a better idea of where things are going at that point.<br><br>I think one thing's for sure: Many changes are to come.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked Sidonia for the more hard-sci-fi feel.<br><br>Little did I know that Nihei just wanted to make his version of Love Hina with a talking penis monster.<br>Shit got pretty goddamn lame in the middle of this season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Youre fighting gauna and this girl straddles you in your cockpit, what do you do?</br>  <br>Stick it in.</br>   all this new BeniJiro art <br>muh dick</br>  <br>This. I fell in love with KoS when people started dying and shit by accelerating the ship.<br><br>I still like SoL with Izana though.</br></br></br>  <br> I fell in love with KoS when people started dying and shit by accelerating the ship. <br>Not that guy, but that's exactly fucking it.<br><br>It's not hard sci-fi by any stretch, this isn't Planetes, but it felt like the show put a bit of thought into what it really means to be in space, it wasn't just a backdrop and nothing more. Mid S2 did kind of veer of course, if I hadn't been already invested I'm not sure I would've liked the show in general as much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like shit though.</br>  <br>It's not fantastic, but it's better than most. I'll take what I can get.</br>  <br>That's not outright terrible, but the skin tone is totally off. They look like statues or undead or some shit.</br>  So, how much of the story did this second season cover?  <br>Up until Beni is killed properly.</br>  <br>Well shit. Brb, rewatching Planetes.</br>  <br>I hope it fixes the fuckawful CG framerate issues if they do.<br><br>I almost vomited on several occasions in both S1 and S2 when the CG was stuttering around at ~12 fps or whatever fucking lazy ass framerate they bothered to render it at.<br><br>I've mostly accepted that shitty 3DCG is the unavoidable future of anime, but for fucking fuck sakes at least make the goddamned stuff animate smoothly.<br><br>I hate it so much.<br><br><br><br>If I want to pick up the mange from the end of S2, what chapter do I start at?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever chapter they leave that planet but I would go back to the beginning where Izana did reconnaissance on the planet.</br>  <br>They changed that much of the story for an anime-original end?

Gauna produced copies of Hoshijiro's guardian together with pilot.

Anyway, gauna human clones are getting better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Solaris: The Anime <br><br>Did Nihei ever give Stanislav Lem credit for the inspiration?</br></br>  <br>Aside from the name of the Star System?

That should be enough.</br>    <br><br>Things like a giant laser beam seem less like trying to communicate and more like trying to genocide.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Well yes, but with gauna adaptability they don't really need to make clones yet they do it anyway. <br>Maybe they don't want to communicate, maybe they just want to understand humans better so they can make more efficient weapons to kill them.<br>We'll probably never know if Nihei doesn't introduce some TWIST with Enajiro acting as intermediary but I don't think that's very likely.</br></br></br>  <br> "I definitely want to make season 3 and BLAME! with this team.

The captain clearly has a goal beyond "kill all the gauna", she seems to be heading to a specific place which no one but her and Bear-chan know about.</br></br></br>  <br>She's dead ;_;<br><br>Well, I assume so because in anime it looks like she was decapitated but then she up and about walking around with Ochia's assistant possesing her.</br></br></br>  I just hope it's not the plot of Mass Effect...  <br>Yes, but keep in mind that they learned about the giant laser beam by copying humans who shot giant laser beams at them first.<br><br>I'm not really a fan of that theory, but it seems at least slightly plausible.<br><br>Also the Gauna clearly have an interest in Higgs particles as well as Kabi (which apparently can be made from placenta). It could simply be the case that Gauna just want to eat Higgs and copying shit is simply what they do, like a sort automatic thing, they may not even have the will or intelligence for someone to say they're copying humans on purpose.

What is up with that shit?<br><br>Is it supposed to hint at the fact that Gauna may somehow be human-made or that may even somehow originate from humans directly? How would that even work chronologically? Humanity wasn't advanced enough when the Gauna hit the solar system to do that shit. Any theories?</br></br>  <br>Well, like how humans model robots to look human the Gauna's creators (if they even had creators) probably modeled the Gauna after themselves.<br><br>Humans and aliens are bound to share some similarities.</br></br></br>  <br>A detail of human internal anatomy seems rather specific though, doesn't it?</br>    <br>Forgot that it doesn't screencap the subtitles. "the first Gauna that descended to earth was humanoid".</br>  Maybe it's humans that look like Gaunas, not the other way around  <br>looks more like a sperm</br>  <br>after eating the people sent to communicate with it in space</br>  <br>Possibly.</br>  <br><br>Yes, but IIRC that happened after humanity had attempted to send people to initiate first contact and failed completely.<br><br>Besides, from everything we know Gauna mimic things using placenta, not their true bodies, so you can't really explain the shape of their true body away by saying that it's mimicking the human central nervous system.</br></br></br></br>  Liiiiiive  <br>Dead version of a girl is better than the actual girl<br><br>Where have we seen this before?</br></br></br>  <br>Not for long, anon.

I'd wish him dead if it wouldn't make Izana sad.</br></br></br>  <br> he fucking did that to Izana <br>I'm no Captainfag, but Nagate has no obligation to give Izana the D.</br></br>  <br>He more did it to Tsumugi than Izana.<br>Izana's reaction is going to be great if she finds out though.</br></br>  <br> I'm no Captainfag, but Nagate has no obligation to give Izana the D. <br><br>YES HE DOES<br><br>Izana loves him but he's too thick to notice. It's like he's 6 years old and still in the "girls are icky" phase.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems rude not to.</br>    <br>Lots of plot spoilers ahead.<br><br> After S2 ends, there's several chapters where Nagate gets extremely close to Tsumugi. At this point, both Yuhata and Izana seem to bow out of the Nagatebowl, with Yuhata doing and saying some curious things to Izana. At this point, the Captain has some time with Nagate, who ends up missing a dinner (or several) with Lala, and Nagate is inducted into the Immortal Ship Committee officially. Then shit goes down with the fight with the LMUS and Tsumugi gets terribly injured while the Captain is doing relief work after Sidonia gets buttfucked. <br><br> Current manga Nagatebowl contenders are the Captain (who's arguably already won), Tsumugi (who might die), and Benisuzume's Hoshijiro (who's in a box somewhere). Izana and Yuhata have been sidelined, Teruru is MIA, Samari is old and busted, and Sasaki and Yure are not interested. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Calm down Izana is not even competing anymore. The contenders now are just Tsumugi and the Captain.</br></br>  <br>It's worth noting that it wasn't foreshadowed particularly well, as most people believed it to be a father/daughter type thing.</br>  <br><br>That is just pure denial from deluded shippers.</br></br>  <br>Nobody but the most hardcore of Tsumugifags expected it.</br>    <br>Isn't that bestiality?</br>  <br>Well, as far as I know it's still a bit ambiguous. The way it was worded didn't necessarily imply romantic love and a parent kissing their child on the cheek is pretty normal. Might be that Tsumugi sees it as a romantic thing while Nagate, dense as he is, sees it as a father-daughter thing. I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>fertilization complete</br>  <br>I'd be less than surprised if that turned out to be the case. I guess the whole 'sleeping together on her chest' thing could be rationalised this way too, but I'm not sure how I feel about this potential layering of asspulls.</br>  Izana x Yuhata ?  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Wouldn't exactly call it an asspull. We know that Nagate isn't very socially adept and he's had only one romantic relationship, which ended pretty quickly.</br>  <br>The Captain is just a kuudere. She may seem cold, but she does what she does because she loves Sidonia and all of its inhabitants. She is a true patriot. And in these hard times, she shows it.</br>  <br>Even assuming Yuhata meant it like you think she did, why the hell would Izana be interested in her? I'm yet to see a yurifag give me a halfway decent response beyond 'futa Izana :^^^)'</br>    <br>Yurifags can't read social situations.</br>  <br>Lala better pull Nagate aside and tell him about Saitou.</br>  Kobayashi wants to be nice, but reality won't let her.  <br>I reckon she meant that as encouragement, a sort of 'if I'm not rejected you sure as hell aren't' type thing.</br>  <br>That's how it's meant to be taken.<br><br>I think they're dragging Izana's character through the dirt by making her pine after Nagate despite how many times he hurts her. Intentional or not, fact is he hurts her.</br></br></br>  Hoshijiro is dead and no amount of Gauna bullshitting is going to bring her back.  <br>It's been the driving force behind a lot of her development, it wouldn't make sense if she just woke up one day feeling nothing for Nagate beyond their tight friendship. I agree that at this point she could probably do a lot better, but the heart wants what it wants.</br>  <br>The Captain already did but they did it in such a throwaway moment. It was before they had sex for MANY DAYS</br>  <br>I'm not sure if I'd trust her to give him the full story.</br>  <br>And you don't see the problem regarding why it should be Lala specifically that tells him about Saitou?</br>  <br>This was unrealistic. There was no reason for them to link physically or enough time for the pilots to argue about which guana they were targeting.</br>  <br> There was no reason for them to <br>It looked cool. Reason enough.</br></br>  <br>Anime original problems.</br>  <br>Depends on whether you'd consider a placenta clone with her memories and personality "Hoshijiro", in which case, there is definitely a chance.</br>  So do all the benisuzume love tanikaze? They just are too forceful with how they show it? I was sad when he killed it, if only she knew not to choke someone while kissing  <br>She remembers Hoshijiro's moment of death and her feels for Nagate. It's hard to tell how much she remembered.</br>  <br>It's unclear.<br>Something of note that the anime left out was Benny specifically hunting down Izana during her first sortie, leading to her horrific injuries.</br></br>  Figma or the plamo?<br><br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=TOY-RBT-3918<br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-011721<br>http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10280390</br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Bank right, get a handful of vag.<br><br>Winning.</br></br>  <br>I like the first one the best</br>  <br>It has too many shit tacked on</br>  <br>The first looks the most detailed and more enjoyable but the other two are more expensive?

He'll have to have a new mech so they can sell more toys</br>  <br>Plastic models require manual assembly and painting to achieve anything remotely appealing. Figmas are complete and prepainted.</br>  <br>Does the first one come unpainted?</br>  Why don't they just clone more Tanikazes body and mind with more Tsugumori Mk IIs. War's over by Christmas.  <br>The Mk 2 is very expensive as it is made complete out of the new lightweight material. There's not a whole lot of it to go around since the Mk 20 production was delayed because Nagate insisted that all Gardes should have the material reinforcing the cockpit.</br>  <br>Why not just have the head NOT be the Higgs Boson Particle cannon?</br>  <br>I don't see what that has to do with it. The problem is the limited supply of the new alloy/megastructure. I don't think they have any shortage of Higgs cannons since they strap that shit onto almost everything. They've been using it long before the new material was synthesized</br>  <br>Damage to the head equals zero vision for the 17mk2 and the 18 an the gaunas learn from that.</br>  <br>Benisuzume to a gauna that absorbed then used Hoshijiro, not Hoshijiro herself. The placenta clone of it might though be Hoshijiro.</br>  <br> Higgs Boson Particle <br>It's a fictional energy called Heigus Particle not Higgs Boson.

Instead of spending the last 5 minutes of the episode using previous footage couldn't they have atleast ending it with resolving all the SoL building they did in S2?

Nagate isn't THAT fucking ignorant, give him some credit. <br><br>If you feel like it's sudden on Nihei's part and thus dislike the development, that's another argument.<br><br> on the cheek </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw the kiss was actually an accident already explained a page before </br>  What did those numbers on benisuzume mean? The 702  <br>That was Hoshijiro's callsign. You are not a clever man.</br>  <br>Everyone has a 3 digit callsign.

It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>Sounds to me like it will first make a connection between Z and BotG and then take on the new arc. I doutbt they'll revamp BotG and RoF like some anons were saying</br></br>  <br>I wonder how different Universe 6 will be to the main one</br>  <br>The way I read it, seems it takes place after the latest movie. "Continues the with the battle of gods arc".<br><br>Seeing them going to new universes is pretty awesome. I just want Uub to show up one day</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I meant. Interconnect Z with BotG and then make the time skip to post RoF.<br> continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. </br></br>  FoG subs when  <br>In b4 a universe where every character is genderbent<br><br> girl goku </br></br></br>  I just realized a plot hole if Super is going to take place before the epilogue of DBZ.<br><br>In DBZ, Goku stated the main reason he decided to train Uub is so he could have such an incredibly powerful opponent to face. However, since the introduction of Gods of Destruction, there are tons of enemies stronger than Goku for him to fight.<br><br>So unless Goku becomes the strongest being in the entire multiverse within 10 years, the epilogue makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6 <br><br><br>what if uneverse 6 is gt universe</br></br></br></br>  <br>GIANT SUPER DRAGON BALLS<br><br>Maybe that 9-star ball on the V-Jump magazine manga adaptation wasn't a mistake!</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Battle of Gods made it so Goku never meets Uub</br>  Wait so will it be starting straight after buus defeat or after RoF? I don't get it  <br>Uub appeared in the tournament 10 years after the events of Kid Buu. BoG doesn't take place nearly as long as that. His meeting with Uub hasn't been retconned.</br>  <br>If Uub is able to harness his potential, he might potentially be greater than any warrior we've seen yet. It remains to be seen. Also, Goku never explicitly stated that, it's just heavily implied.<br><br>Battle of Gods, Super, and Revival of F take place in the 10 years between Majin buu's defeat and the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, where they meet Uub.</br></br></br>  <br>Both. They'll tackle Buu's aftermath first and then move to post RoF</br>  <br> an angry sexy Vegeta with a hard on for Goku </br>  <br>Would you?<br>Could you?<br>Should you?</br></br></br>  <br>it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies.<br><br>Makes you wonder what was the point of the movies, then.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the epilogue has officially been retconned now since it's stated that Goku hasn't seen anyone else since the Majin Buu incident</br>  <br> it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies. <br>What makes you think that?<br>The series will probably assume you have alredy watched both movies and after the post buu arc it will move to the 6th universe arc</br></br></br>  <br>Making money<br>Raise awareness for DB again<br>Making money</br></br></br>  <br>Only parts of it. Uub still happened.</br>  <br>  Hey Kakarot, after this battle how about you come back to my ship and I'll show you my Big Bang? </br>  <br>We'll still get Uub I think but it'll be tailored to fit into the new storyline</br>  <br>I wonder which universe is Future Trunk's.</br>  <br>Actually the epilogue stated it's been 5 years since he met everyone, which is what's covered by BoG. <br><br>Of course, that means he wouldn't be able to meet everyone in Super, which takes place directly afterwards. And that won't happen.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you? <br>yeah, a girl with the same personality as goku would be really cute<br> Could you? <br>idk maybe? i have a lot of energy but im just a human, not a saiyajin<br> Should you? <br>Probably no, but who cares? i would train and fight with her even if it cost me my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. It'll happen in a similar way, but be altered a bit for the new movies. Pan and Bra will be there too, since Pan was in the last movie with Grunkle Piccolo.<br><br> Bra might end up as the strongest hybrid, thinking about it. Veggie has the God ki, and remember how much stronger Trunks got with Vegeta around? </br></br></br>  Ok so it will take place after buy saga before BotG? I hope they don't re-tell it. Love that movie so much, and what's the deal with this new universe? Are the events of BotG told differently in that universe? Will the 2nd arc take place after RoF? Someone explain this to me for I am stupid.  <br>Do you think you could keep Vegeta away from Goku?</br>  All the other universes being just alternate versions of them would be dumb and lazy.<br><br>Unfortunately that's exactly what i expect they will be.</br></br>  <br>Post-Buu<br><br>Timeskip<br><br>Multiverse<br><br>at least that's sort of what it sounds like to me<br><br>there better not be a mary sue version of Goku's mom thought up by the French in there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see   </br>  <br>there needs to be a variation where personalities are completely changed<br><br>like yamcha is an alpha that actually trains<br>vegeta is a complete pussy that only fights when he has to<br>piccolo is a goody two-shoes who is very open and friendly<br>goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything<br>frieza could be an ally in one of the universes<br><br>just a few random ideas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything <br>Goku and Chi-chi single-handedly repopulate the Saiyan race through their fuckin'</br></br>  <br>Only if she's fit, none of this turning a muscular dude into a small skinny waifu crap.</br>  I really dislike the idea of just slightly alternate versions of existing characters in the other universe. I'm ok with maybe some of the top level people such as the god of destruction and some of the kai's being similar looking, but not the regular denizens of the universe.  Okay, so from what I understand,<br> The two new movies are continuations of the manga and introduce the idea that there are 12 universes <br> Movies/manga universe is the seventh universe <br> Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br> Super's first two arcs are retellings of the two movies with some differences like Champa <br> The third arc is a crossover battle with the sixth universe (notice they didn't specify what universe Super took place in, only that the sixth universe were their neighbors) <br><br>It opens the possibility of there being a GT universe, an Online universe, and other things like that where history plays out differently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt really want them to go to a different universe but after Beerus mentioned thered be 12 universes I knew it was inevitable.</br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>Where was this confirmed</br></br>  <br>So it's after BotG? That doesn't make sense considering goku turns SSJ and not SSJGSS, and discovers Beerus for the 1st time in the trailer, unless it takes place in universe 6? Why is there another universe and why can't they just continue the story after RoF? What's the deal with this multiverse arc and are the characters in each universe meeting each other? Maybe after the events of this multiverse arc, the characters that represent their respective universe go their separate ways and then they continue the story after RoF which would mean RoF already happened, right? It would go like this I'm assuming.<br> After Buu <br> after BotG <br> After RoF <br> Zfighters discover new universe <br> see themselves, fat beerus blah blah <br> work together to fight evil threat <br> characters from universe 6 go back home  <br> they continue the story of the main timeline after that <br>Unless it takes place after BotG and before RoF which leads to all of this shit and THEN whis trains goku/vegeta. Then after that, the next arc takes place after RoF. This multiverse thing seems like filler to me, but I guess it could be fun. Am I close or just being retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>What else is in your ass. Please keep taking stuff out of it, I want to see what else you can come up with</br></br>  <br>what if it's like, just the same kinds of races, but not characters?<br><br>like Saiyans are still around somewhere, but there's no Goku or Vegeta or anything, there's like, maybe some guy, who's sort of an asshole but not, named like, Artichoke<br><br>and there are Namekians, but no Piccolo or Guru or anyone, like maybe there's a dude named Mollus, who is a Super Namekian like Piccolo but talks and acts like some sort of bancho punk dude that flies around space getting into WACKY HIJINKS with his crew of oddball sidekicks<br><br>there are still Earthlings, but maybe they're not complete idiots? Also the champion of the Earth is like, a Luchador Cyborg Bear or something silly<br><br>fuck it, maybe the Tuffles are the race of heroes of the universe?

Who /Calgary/ here?  <br>Me.  melo? </br>  <br>Happy Canada day, fellow canuck. Fort Mac here. They just finished having their fireworks display a day early...</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>How's swimming in the money?</br>  I'm totally down  <br>Nevermind. The orchestr/a/ had another anon who was in Calgary.</br>  <br><br>You mean swimming in the tar pits? Terrible way to get oil.</br></br>              <br>Unfortunately I'm not doing oil related shit. As a matter of fact, I'm moving in the middle of July.</br>    best support unit                        You realize she never actually moved to Canada, right?<br>lol Canada. Reduced to only maple syrup references in the animes.</br>    <br>What are you talking about? She obviously moved to Canada, their teacher said so.</br>                                <br>I thought everything up there paid well just due to proximity to the oil.</br>       no Bernstein sisters <br> no Cecil Sudo <br>Shit Canada Day thread, eh?</br></br>    Best girl      So, which Negima series was better?<br><br>Xebec or Shaft?</br></br>  <br>There is no Negima anime.</br>  Berserk bread<br><br>I'm running out of patience Miura<br>Put an end to the torture</br></br></br>  what if he releases the full volume 38?  <br>Post best pages</br>  I stopped caring a long time ago.Why should i when he doesn't  <br>Even Miura has run out of patience for Miura. He hates Miura so much that he has stopped being Miura and does not write Berserk anymore.</br>  <br>Anon, Miura is gonna die before Berserk ends. He doesn't care anymore.<br><br>Ironically, this is the only chance for a continuation or regulation because maybe with luck, very good luck, another author pick the series.</br></br></br>    <br>I was going to post that one, good taste.</br>  Is he off the fucking boat yet?  <br>I do not understand. Why would he abandon his magnus opus? Has anyone bothered to go ask the guy what the problem is? It can't be that he can't draw anymore! He just did that pissing loli manga that nobody cared about!</br>  I want to know exactly why Berserk is being delayed so much. Is he bored of the series? Or is he sick? Is he depressed? Or maybe he's got writer's block or he's trying to work out how to deal with a big plot hole or something like that.  <br>maybe he has enough money and do what he wants</br>  <br> pissing loli manga <br>What was that? is it translated?</br></br>  <br>I'd suppose he's just lost his passion and wants to move on. It happens a lot</br>  At this point I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted it all to end. He has been drawing and writing it for 26 years.<br><br>26 Years.<br><br>However at the same time he has an obligation to at least give us an ending and not just abandoning it. Its a matter or respect and professionalism.</br></br></br></br>   anon i gonna kill myself, i can't take this anymore <br> no please, at least wait for shenmue 3 and berserk to finish <br>he still alive by the way.</br></br>  <br>Miura can't help that Cinderella Girls got animated.</br>  First three volumes in the mail, BotH Guts figma on its way. The hype cannot be contained.      <br>I guess I just can't get enough of these low angle shots.</br>  <br>The whole Lost Children arc has some great panels of Guts' berserk face.</br>  <br>Fuck, you can see the despair and rage in his eyes</br>  <br><br>Even the softer scenes in Berserk are well done though.</br></br>    Still laughing.  <br>I also enjoy the gag panels even. What makes Berserk so great is it perfectly seems to blend action, humor, drama and horror all into one.</br>    Berserk is never coming back, is it?  Im@s fan (not CG) here.<br>I'm sorry guys.<br>Really sorry ;_;</br></br>  How soon would you know if Miura is releasing a new volume? Would they make an announcement or would he just release it randomly?  gonna start looking into this whole berserk series<br><br>sounds neat</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't get how he can one hand that sword but not grip Casca when she fell off the boat. And don't tell me magnets.</br></br>  <br>write a letter to the author and ask him about it</br>  To increase the anguish let's list all the things that need to happen before the manga reaches its conclusion..<br><br>Guts needs to go through the elf island arc and probably fight the elf island boss, whoever and whatever that is.<br><br>After that and a probable power upgrade he needs to defeat all of Griffith's apostles, and since they all look formidable each one of them would probably get their own arc where they're the boss character.<br><br>Once they're dealt with we need to see Griffith taken on along with the Godhand. Again, since each one of them looks quite formidable they'd get their own arc where they get defeated as the boss of that arc with Femto as the last one standing.<br><br>So that right there are about 10 arcs or so just for those major characters, without counting in random assholes and monsters Guts might come across while traveling/reaching the major assholes.<br><br>And then of course we have Griffith/Femto's "I was pretending all along" master plan where it turns out he was doing what he was doing to defeat an ancient evil and so on so another final boss battle at the end.<br><br>Even if we condense all this into 2-3 arcs where all the apostles get dealt with in one arc and all of the godhand in another it's still way beyond any scope Miura can possibly deliver within his lifetime.<br><br>That's probably why he gave up. He overextended himself.<br><br>Same thing happened to the guy who did Bastard! and to the guy that did Alita.<br>They both kept writing their magnum opus until they got tired of it or it became so bloated nobody cares really since no end is in sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And don't tell me magnets. <br> It's the magnets. </br></br>  <br>You know it is magnets.</br>  <br>I don't know what this means<br><br><br>Do it! I loved the anime, great soundtrack, great character development, great everything. I'm about to start the manga and then I'll watch the CGI movies as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If it were in fact magnets, then the force holding the hand to the steel sword would have to be so great that separating the two would impossible.</br></br></br>   I better get this story wrapped up since it's taking way too long <br><br> chapter devoted to some lolis bathing <br> chapter devoted to Griffith standing in a flowery field with every flower rendered perfectly <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment </br></br></br></br>  I watched berserk tonight with my mom not even making that up.   you will never see Guts defeat Femto and then go into berserker rage and rape his ass in front of the godhand   <br>This guy gets it. You can't even interact with him unlike fans of GRRM do.</br>  <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment <br>I only sporadically join Berserk threads, I bet that Piss Wizard comic got posted all the time.</br></br>   you'll never see the skull knight slice Void's brain head in half <br><br>you just know it would happen sooner or later</br></br>  <br><br>Considering Berserk is never getting finished I'd rather Miura do more one-shots like that since I really like his artwork.</br></br>  <br> we've seen nothing of Skull Knight after Femto bamboozled him into unleashing even more monsters into the world <br><br>that's gotta burn, spent all that time on something the Godhand saw coming and based their plans on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Given the rather tropey nature of the entire thing I'm thinking that Griffith deliberately orchestrated the merging of the planes so that the evil entities could be given physical form and harmed by combat.<br>He knows Guts will slice em all up sooner or later and in the end the two of them will somehow take down the idea of evil as well.<br><br>basically Griffith needed to ensure he's dismantling the bad guys from within so he's pretending to be evil</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gigantomachia, I think.</br>  <br><br>Thats stupid horse shit. Griffith wants his own kingdom, nothing more.</br></br>  <br>Miura, pls no.</br>  <br>http://www.mangareader.net/gigantom<wbr>akhia</wbr></br>  <br><br>You know it's gonna happen.<br>Search your feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know what Griffith's plans are now, we haven't really seen what he's been thinking since the Eclipse. All we've seen of him and the Godhand are them setting up for Falconia's return. Who knows what they're ultimately planning?<br><br>Sides, I'd argue that becoming part of the Godhand was the ultimate fulfillment of his 'own kingdom' wish anyway. Now he's up to something else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Griffith is vain incarnate.<br><br>He saw that the Godhand are above him so he joined them but by no means is he playing their game and it's completely contrary to his character to be working for some giant evil heart with no choice in the matter.<br><br>You can bet your ass he's working it from the inside to come out on top somehow or at the very least fuck up whoever is above him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, best ending coming through<br> some unnecessary boat shit happens <br> Oh shit, Griffith's here  <br> But wait, Skull King gives Guts an amalgamation of behelits, causing another eclipse <br> Guts uses this opportunity to ask for his wish to be granted <br> His wish is to turn Griffith into a woman, who will then be married and subservient to Guts after he rapes her <br> Guts has successfully raped Griffith back at the same time as stealing his entire kingdom, because women can't rule </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah sure that makes sense, but I don't think he would be trying to do it for "good" reasons.</br>  <br>Dude he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. Whatever shred of good was in Griffith is gone, his soul is corrupted and now serves the idea of evil.<br>The Godhand tricked him into believing the only way he could achieve his dream was by betraying everyone, therefore claiming his soul. Just like all the demons before him.<br><br>Did you even read Berserk?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know youre a raging Griffith fanboy but relax with the stupid fanfic</br>  <br>Its a nip comic where demons and islands with teeth exist, i wouldn't think on it too hard</br>  <br>Mozgus is funny</br>  <br>It's obviously an electromagnet that is turned on when the dragonslayer is placed in the grip.</br>  <br>idolm@ster</br>  <br> he lied on the internet </br>  <br>Complete creative burnout. It's why he does silly things like spend inordinate amounts of effort on drawing shit like vases, why the pissing loli manga was so mediocre, and why the plot in Berserk has really gone nowhere since Guts finally got on the boat. I think he needs a shock to his system, like a few months traveling overseas. I think that's one of the reasons why Araki has managed to keep things so fresh.</br>  I mean, seriously. Griffith is a fucking background object to this vase.  <br>Not him but I actually did show Berserk to both my parents individually and even had my 68 year old father read the entire fucking manga. Now he's on the boat with the rest of us.</br>  <br>quick someone go take hostage of his idolmaster.</br>    <br>is there any other manga that puts same detail into its pages</br>    <br>I'm pretty happy I watched the dub of Berserk. I can hear Griffiths voice in my head when he talks, and its so fitting to the character</br>  If Miura ever kicks the bucket, I hope they bring this guy back to do the art.  How the hell does Muira make his living???    <br>The Berserk dub is really good. Marc Diraison's voice has become inseparable from Guts in my mind. The dub is excellent overall. The only character's voice I have a problem with is Gaston's because whenever I hear Sean Schemmel's voice, no matter the role, all I hear is Goku.</br>  <br> his work sold more than 30 millions <br>I fucking wonder anon.</br></br>  Could Takehiko Inoue finish Berserk if Miura dies prematurely?  <br>I thought I heard Goku's voice! I actually didn't mind it and was just kind of like "Hey its Goku" And yeah Guts' voice is great too. How are the movies? Is it the same voice actors?</br>    <br>All the key voice actors reprise their roles and sound better than ever in my opinion even though the movies abridge (butcher) the story.</br>    <br><br>Just to clarify, I do think the movies are worth watching at least once if you're a hardcore fan of Berserk. The movies are like seeing the same story from a different perspective, so they're interesting.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably get around to watching them even though I heard they are awful. Maybe might watch that Redux version</br>  <br><br>Actually, I've got time tonight I'll watch the first one now. I'll let you anons know what I thought about it</br></br>  <br>Kaoru Mori and Sui Kasai tend to get obsessive about detail, particularly with cloth, but they don't go haywire in every panel like Miura tends to, probably because they actually have to publish to put food on the table.<br><br>I kinda wonder what would happen if Miura recalibrated his brain and did something along the lines of Gisele Alain, maybe starring Rickert.</br></br></br>  Oh and I'd put Vinland Saga up there in terms of detail and in terms of probably never fucking ending, too.    Reminder that if Miura wont give us new chapter, autistic mods can delete berserk threads aswell  <br>Pretty sick colour work<br>Although i always imagined Grunbled would be blue like Seath the Scaleless</br></br>  <br><br>For me the story ended.<br>I enjoy it as something that is somewhat complete and done and i also imagined an ending for it.</br></br></br>  I just want more introspective/unstable Farnese. She's at her beast when she's confused.  <br>Don't be harsh on autistic people, they can't change the way they are.</br>  Anyone remember this shit?  <br> She's at her beast </br>  <br>One of the best Dreamcast games, here's hoping Fromsoftware gets to make the next Berserk game</br>  If you guys had to estimate how close we are to the end what would you say? 80%?  UGHHHHH<br><br>tbh i don't even care anymore<br><br>i haven't read a chapter in 8 friggin months, might as well not even exist</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me explain to you why the wait is so long.<br><br>You see, Miura died 10 years ago but due to a life unfulfilled was cast into purgatory with one task: finish Berserk and you will be allowed into heaven.<br><br>However, after years of struggling against his own laziness and habits he became bitter at the whole ordeal. He changed the plot and put the cast on the boat.<br><br>The reason for the change is obvious, the boat is a message to the readers: "Do not lose the momentum in your life and fall to apathy as I did." Guts and friends are never getting off the boat, because just like Miura, they are trapped; because the boat is purgatory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the amount of loose ends we currently still have, I'd guess closer to 70%.</br>  <br>Fan guesses of completion could be anywhere, but knowing Miura, he could take the story in a completely new direction on a whim, because there's so much unresolved shit going on in the plot. it doesn't matter anyway because the future is dark.</br>  Say what you will about the movies, I absolutely adore the female character designs. They have this soft, fleshy look to them.  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Slan in particular is positively delicious.</br>  <br> implying  <br><br>dude can't even finish his own shit</br></br></br>  <br> so great that separating the two would impossible <br><br>Maybe Guts doesn't have little bitch arms like you do?</br></br></br>  <br> dark souls berserk meem <br><br>Stop<br>They are completely different. Just because Dark Souls has references to Berserk doesnt mean its the same shit. From are awful at cinematics and they arent known for character development. A Berserk game would be extremely plot and dialogue heavy. From cant even animate fucking mouths for shit sake</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shut the fuck up Griffith apologist, you shit up every thread.</br></br>  <br>60 70<br><br>Still at least another 10 volumes to go in my opinion</br></br></br>  Are you yurifans satisfied? Was the ending good enough for you?  <br> the hands tied by fate are clasped together in the final scene <br>Kyoani finds a way</br></br>  <br>I'd watch the same episode 8 times if that's what it took to save her smile.</br>  <br>They'll get better first years. I'm sure news about Kitauji reaching the nationals will make musically talented people reconsider enrolling. They still have Oboe and Reina as their main weapons anyway.</br>  <br/>  <br>he is as pure as the driven snow</br>  can it be cropped porn time?  <br>Wasn't her second volume, Mida Love, released in 2015?</br>  <br>OP?</br>  <br> fishermen/people who post the images/people who know how to find the images: don't get aggressive because someone asked for a source, if you don't want to give them a source it's fine. also consider that in some situations getting the source might be hard for others, but again you don't have to do it if you don't want to. <br>Your newness sure show here. The whole reason most people being cunts and ass-blasted over a single "sauce pls" sentence is because it's the easiest way to scare off the newfag or people who aren't compatible with /a/. Of course, with time, oldfags are replaced by newfags and people forgot why it existed at the first place, but they still followed the tradition of telling other people to fuck off.</br></br>  <br> You can't win or lose against cocks, you can only love them. </br>  <br><br>this is the guy who made cherry bomb right? i really like his art style</br></br>  Rumi best girl  <br>Because he likes someone he thinks he can understand, what he wants is to completely understand and she's the only one he has actively tried to do so with.</br>  <br>SakiSaki x Yumiko or Yukino x Yumiko?</br>  <br> Since the morning, Miura seemed like she had been trying to keep me out of her sight. Be it during class or break, she’d always look away from me with her cheeks in hand. </br>  <br>Anon please, my heart is still recovering.</br>  <br>They don't make noise.</br>   buttmad mods delete a perfectly fine SAO thread <br>Isn't that just jolly?<br><br>Anyway, I recently rewatched the series. Was more fun than I remembered.<br>Any words on S3? Are the latest books translated yet?<br><br>On a related note, Accel World S2 when?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its actually real?<br><br>I want off the sao wild ride.</br></br></br>  <br> FPS <br> not Metal Gear <br>Really though he sounds like Big Boss, given that his real job is a mercenary for hire.</br></br></br>  <br>You were paying enough attention to get the number of people wrong and to not accept the basic premise of the first arc. You're still stuck in "How does the Japanese safety board allow this?" mode. The threads have long since moved past MICROWAVE HELMETS. Keep up.</br>  <br>But GGO is run by an American company...</br>  <br>I dunno why Kawahara didn't just use potassium. It would bring about the cardiac arrest he wants, and cell lysis after death normally deranges blood potassium levels so it would not be unusual to find it in blood tests at autopsy.</br></blockquote>]
