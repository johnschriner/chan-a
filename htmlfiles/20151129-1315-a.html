[ So how did he ever get C class rank 1? I mean, is there any real threat he can deal with?  Got that balloon down like a champ.  <br> So how did he ever get C class rank 1? I mean, is there any real threat he can deal with? <br>He can deal with Tiger threats. We never saw him with his shirt off but it is easy to assume he has well hidden muscles. His physical performance is actually quite good for someone with no superpowers, and is actually on par with Tanktop Tiger.<br><br>However he stays in C because he knows he is best served helping people on the ground, big or small.</br></br></br></br>  He worked hard.  <br>He stays in C because he's a faggot that gets fucking REKT every time anything even remotely serious happens.<br><br>He's still best though.</br></br></br>  He is literally an average human who uses a bike as a mode of transportation. He is as useless as any other screaming civilian but has a little bit of protection with his gear.<br><br>Is there a level below C? Currently he should be that.</br></br>  <br>He looks useless because he was up against a monster above S class heroes, but put his feats into perspective.<br><br>The Sea King destroyed the walls of a bomb proof shelter, and License-less rider was able to stand up and tackle him even after taking his blows. This is much, much more resistance than a normal human could possibly have, IRL, no one would be able to defeat him in hand to hand combat and he would have no trouble stopping a common thief.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He got rekt by Hammerhead though, and I'll doubt that guy was even Tiger class</br></br>  <br> He got rekt by Hammerhead though, and I'll doubt that guy was even Tiger class <br>Tiger = threaten human lives. An army of people who can destroy buildings in one punch is not a wolf threat. They were defeated by Sonic because he is S level.</br></br>  <br><br>You poor foolish little anon. Sonic is not S level.<br><br>High A level but not S.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Guy had an extremely r√©sistant skull, above human strenght on his own and he also was equipped with an armour that alows ypu to destroy buildings in one punch.<br>Most B class would have lost too, and I am not even mentioning the fact that he was alone against like 30 guys</br></br>  <br> You poor foolish little anon. Sonic is not S level. <br> High A level but not S. <br>Since I doubt you missed the memo, I am just going to assume you are trolling.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Memo? I am just basing this off feats and nothing else. <br><br>If the manga made him S level then I humbly take that back but I want evidence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or he could be an animeonly casual.</br>  <br>Sonic watched Pi-Pri-Prisoner and Sea King fight and commented he could beat them both. He also was able to fight toe to toe with Sea King until the rain started.<br><br>Sonic is definitely S class strength.</br></br></br>   been waiting whole day for "post character who can beat OPM" thread <br> it's not happening <br><br>What the fuck happened?</br></br></br>    <br>Read the manga<br>Sonic defeated Genos, Saitama had to save his life<br><br>I know Genos is a jobber, but he is S class</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sonic fought Genos to a stalemate and even before that, Sea King wasn't able to hit him (granted, Sonic couldn't do any damage either).</br>  <br> talking shit about Mumen Rider <br>I'll fucking cut you.</br></br>  <br>it's already been decided</br>  <br><br>Look better.</br></br>  <br>He beat quite a lot of A-class heroes on his own.</br>  <br>That's not what happened at all. Don't bring in your headcanon.</br>  <br>It's probably because he always tries even when he knows it's hopeless.<br><br>The reason King, despite everyone thinking he's the world's strongest man, is ranked so lowly in class S is because he shirks his duties (due to actually not being the world's strongest man).</br></br></br>  <br>That's too specific.</br>  Do you guys think Genos would have been able to beat Sea King if he didn't have to shield the girl?  <br>ONE said Sonic could beat sea king<br><br>you stupid bitch</br></br></br>  <br>Probably if he gave it his all.</br>  The thing with Genos is that if his fire power doesn't do the job then he is fucked.  <br><br>with weapons and before it started raining, yes.</br></br>  <br>You gotta admit he nearly beat the shit out of Sea King and had he not dropped his guard he may have been able to take him out on his own.<br><br>Dude crushed 1/3 of Sea King's face</br></br></br>  <br>referring to Genos btw.<br><br>He went out a couple times on his own too, who knows what threats he defeats when Saitama's not around.</br></br></br>  <br>What?<br>He beats tank top tiger<br><br>He can deal with most criminals.<br><br>And it's implied he gives a fuck about the ranks.<br>Bang said it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Heart and determination. C class mostly deals with low level thugs and mundane shit. If you meet the quota, you can push forward regardless given time.  I expected more from Sea King fight. <br>That Saitama vs genos scene really got my hopes high. <br><br>Can it be that they are saving the budget up for something amazing or is their budget already spent on that amazing moneyshot?</br></br></br>  <br>What happens if Saitama hits Accelerator?<br><br>Besides i believe that anything with mind control/telepcy will also do.</br></br></br>  <br>Genos needs to work on his perfomance overall. Letting your guard down after the first punch isn't very smart. Dude needs some pain receptors to learn the basics again. Then he might have had a good chance.<br><br><br>Every Genos fight so far was pretty good or at least decent. This one was very underwhelming compared to the rest. Saitamas punch was perfectly executed though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>i cant w8 for when king wrecks saitama</br>  <br>They're probably saving their budget for the big Boros finale</br>  <br>This gives me hope they poured all that remained into v. Boros, because even though it would be great to see the whole S class team beautifully animated, that fight deserves the attention,</br>  <br> 1080p <br> jpg </br></br>  So when the fuck is Saitama going to get recognized? I'm sick of him taking all the shit and getting shit on every episode. Will he ever achieve rank S? Or at least get some fans who like him?<br><br>And who the fuck was the fatass false-flagging nigger in this episode? Who acts like that?</br></br>  <br> Saitamas punch was perfectly executed though. <br>I believe the perfect execition would be like nothing observable happens but it's BANG "Supersonic jet sound" and pulverized Sea King insides are raining all over the place</br></br>   Dual-audio <br> English is default <br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br> Where can I get those? </br>  <br>Because English dubs are better than Japanese dubs. If there is a choice between an eng dub and a jap dub, i always pick the enlish one. Thank god, that so many anime have dubs these days. I watch dubs because i want to listen to the dialogue and i cant understand moonspeak. And also, the Japanese voices sound really monotone and half of the voices dont fit the characters anyway.</br>  <br> The prints are custom made, but the brand is Bambino Biancos. </br>  Because who listens to moonspeak when you could listen to it in English? Fuck reading subtitles if I don't have to.   ctrl-f daiz <br> 0 results <br><br>It's like you newfags don't even know about him.</br></br></br>  Come gather round, /a/nons.<br>It's high time ye learned<br>About a swordsman named Guts,<br>And the scars that he's earned</br></br></br>  <br>You posted the angels.</br>  <br> Guts' first love <br> unimportant </br></br>  <br>Do you think guts enjoyed it?</br>  <br><br> is that his personal trainer or something? </br></br>  <br>I feel so sorry for Guts</br>  Magical legwear.  <br>You know too much about this stuff.
