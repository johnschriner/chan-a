[ Didn't see a thread.  Why is Erina such a bitch?  Aldinis a qt.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Get in line.</br>  So what are the dishes in the manga that are worth cooking?<br><br>I already tried Chaliapin Steak Don. Shit's delicious.</br></br>  <br>I would fuck post-summer Isami, no homo.</br>  The first five posts ITT more or less summarize a typical Shokugeki thread. Bravo.  Why hasn't there been Toriko and SnS collaboration manga?  So why did they feel the need to replace Kaarge arc? Why would they just randomly switch arcs, what is a reason?  <br>and it's glorious</br>  <br><br>that's the inevitable truth with generals</br></br>  <br>Because Toriko is literal dogshit. Notice how Tosh loves collaboration work but decided to do it with Isobe Isobee instead of the obvious choice.</br>  <br>They will probably adapt the Karaage Arc in only one episode or something.</br>  <br>I think it's not up to him to call the shots, no? I agree Toriko became officially worst thing ever after Human world but it's kind of hilarious when it would be the obvious choice. Guess Luffy and Goku don't want to be associated with Toriko anymore also.</br>  <br><br>Because collaborations feels pretty forced in general.</br></br>  <br> you will never eat gelato with Aldini bros <br>Why ever live?</br></br>  <br>That fucking gap between Isami's thighs.</br>  <br>Takumi a cute.</br>  Meat best girl.  <br>What the story behind this pic again?</br>  <br>Isami and Takumi go to a maid cafe in the Karaage Arc if I remember correctly.<br> Translations soon. </br></br>   dat deer in headlights look   Is Hayama's dick likely smaller than Soma's since he's Indian while Soma is Japanese? Need anons' estimation for something I'm drawing...  <br>It's probably Ryou &gt; Hayama &gt; Souma.</br>  <br/>  <br>you ship Soma and Hayama? Will they be the new Dojima/Saiba?</br>  You will never be raised in a small Japanese diner and attend a prestigious cooking school with the craziest best friends a person could ask for, live in a creepy ass dorm, have nightly food and rice wine parties in the same guy's room damn near every night and he doesn't want you there, have a legendary chef dad, a cute and meek bluenette secretly in love with you and have heated cooking competitions with your Italian rival. Why even live?  <br> bluenette <br>nice. Don't forget he has a brown admirer too.</br></br>  I like the new ED, you just have to listen to it a few more times.<br>Also I can't stop laughing at this scene.</br>  <br>Aren't Indians supposed to be second biggest after black people?</br>  <br>That duck Aldini made should be pretty good too if you can get the materials</br>  <br> I think it's not up to him to call the shots, no <br>IIRC the collab with Isobe was his idea and sent his editor into a panic when it was approved by WSJ.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I find it funny how the last couple of years WSJ tried to lump Toriko as the next big thing. Always putting it beside Naruto and One Piece but then its ratings never taking off. Now you have a cooking manga that just blew up and Boku no Hero Academia releasing at the perfect time (Naruto ending and all) to just garner the amount of recognition WSJ wanted Toriko to have.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Takumi getting autistic over "no cream" on carbonara when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately, Black Clover is also doing well. And it keeps ripping off the Big Three.</br>  <br><br><br>At this point I think Tsukuda and Shun just dislike Shimabukuro. Toriko truly has become an epic fail. The food there isn't delicious anymore, it's all about stupid capturing levels. If Monkey Kings poop was sentient and hostile it could lay armageddon over human world, how sad.</br></br></br>  <br> Alice complaining naked to Ryou <br><br>L-lewd</br></br></br>  Oh boy, here we go.  <br>I like it too, people was just too attached to previous ED.</br>  <br>Terrines are great, I often make some meat based ones, since they keep for a couple of days and make for great eats when works and life got you too busy to stop and cook.</br>  <br>The only things I dislike are the singers voice and the lack of O-face panel.</br>  <br>Hayama is edgy because he's Indian still has small dick.<br> Even Jun can't be satisfied with it. </br></br>  <br>Alice doujins never.</br>  <br>SBS sure does love their rape and blackmail.</br>  is souma a lolicon?  Megumi a  Shit   <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Souma is strictly foodsexual and that will be his greatest obsctacle to becoming super cook.</br>  <br>Stop with the generals it's bringing in terrible cancerous discussions.</br>  <br>Inb4 Momo will win the Soumabowl</br>  <br><br>Voice just ruins it for me. Shame really, because in other aspects it's nice ed</br></br>  <br>The sound quality of the song is kind of poor in the anime. Try giving the mp3 or youtube version a listen.</br>  <br>What? Aren't Indians chink tier when it comes to dick size, stereotype-wise at least? I know that they had a national condom crisis because of the international condom standard being too big for them, anyway.</br>  L'etoile cover.  <br>Are you by any chance Indian?<br>Indian men have the smallest penises in the world by far.<br><br>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-<wbr>news/condoms-too-big-for-indian-men<wbr>-475611</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>You call them native americans</br>  <br>This manga just shows how delusional the japs are with their elite cooking school. <br><br> Shino graduates as first seat of elite ten <br> Nobody hires him in France </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because  there is a cooking academy in Europe that makes Tootsuki pale in comparison.   Rivals from said academy will appear during Souma's third year </br>  <br><br>Huh. Since India alone outnumbers Europe's population, I bet the fact that this means that a dark-skinned person statistically is more likely to have a smaller wiener pleases /pol/.</br></br>  <br>Then Aldini bros father must hate his mongrels for sending them overseas.

Tosh's character designs make me question everything about my sexuality.</br>  <br>Shes not, her fanbase is simply not vocal about it like the megoomifags and erinafags that feel that they have to push down their insecurities through shitposting and dragging other girls through the mud.<br>Stay classy and enjoy her through content silence.<br>Truely the masterrace.</br></br></br>  <br> by the time he graduated. </br>  <br>Jouichirou was best boy.</br>  This series has the best character designs I've seen. Period.  <br>Based Tosh.</br>  <br> grow up in sex-crazed 80s Japan <br> live in the manly 90s <br>Jeez</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those series where everyone is fabulously attractive.</br>  <br>It's like Jojo without the hideous manface</br>  <br> manface <br> hideous <br>Gay  unless you mean when it's on the female characters in which case I can agree </br></br></br>  Why do the American and Italian characters have fully Japanese names?  <br>He's a shrewd businessman.

Alice is also worth mentioning.<br>For best guy it's harder to tell since we have less fujos around than waifufags but I guess it's either Soma or Takumi.  Shinomiya is top tier tho. </br></br>  <br> best boy <br>Souma.<br> best girl <br>Tie between Erina and Hisako.<br><br><br> Megumi has both vocal fans and less haters than Erina <br> less haters than Erina <br>Hahaha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who cares, just like whoever you like.</br>  LN anon said he'd have the chapter by this week, where is he?  <br>New Chapter? After 127? Is there some special thing going on, I though this shit was weekly.</br>  <br>It's possible they're moving it to just before the preliminaries, during summer vacation instead of random administrative holiday. The Kaarage arc, and Eizan talking shit to Soma are pretty portable. Soma's dad showing up before all the initial elections stuff already screws up several of his lines, but ultimately they can have him hang around as long as they need to to deliver his lines, though the context might need a bit of changing.</br>  <br>The guy who was translating a la carte</br>  <br>Maybe he got held up by something or is finishing the chapter as we speak. I'm not too worried even if he doesn't deliver because we have other translators.</br>  spinoff series about doijma and shinomiya's generations in totsuki when   poor bee   <br>Best boy-Isshiki<br>Best girl-Meito<br>Best pair- Alice and Ryo<br>Fight me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is best pair.</br>  <br>When the anime hadn't started aired the waifuwars and husbandolust were at the same level.

I just want her to be happy.</br>  <br><br> having Alice in a love triangle would suck. I just want her to be happy <br><br>Are you kidding me? I feel like being in a triangle would make her all chirpy and teasing as fuck. She'd have fun with it and the kick is that she won't be aware she's in a love triangle and she'll just have fun with Ryou and Hayama being her play things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Hayama has his waifu already.</br>  <br><br>Which makes it even more amusing. He gets sonzoned so hard by Jun's parental love for him that she'll start teasing Hayama about the idea of liking Alice even though he detests it.<br><br>It will be a love triangle taken at face value but not a love triangle at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True anon.

Personally I thought that the part with the kids was a bit too long and yeah it was meant to be a pre-arc/build-up arc for dressrosa, but I still thought that it was pretty good as a standalone. The only thing that was really off is that Ceasar was the main villian. The endboss, the last one fighting before baby 5 arrived, should have been Vergo in my opinion. It would also have been good if law took out the arc boss in taht arc instead of luffy who got doffy in dressrosa.  <br><br>I think remove the running + kids and it would have been alright.</br></br>  <br>Vergo is gross and I'm glad he died.</br>  <br><br>Sugar pls.</br></br>  <br>it was breddy gud read all in one go. Weekly it was a pain during the children part</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>reposting</br>  <br>Why should Vergo have been the main villain? He didn't destroy the island with poison gas or experiment on children. He was just an ambassador of Doffy's.</br>  <br>I completely forgot about this page</br>  <br>I thought that Vergo is probably stronger than Ceasar and ceaser being a little bitch and blowing everything up after losing while vergo gives no fuck and fights law headon would have been sick</br>  Better than negrofish island  <br>Painfully tedious through the children part, but worth it just to have scenes like this in the OP.</br>  <br>++<br> exploring the island at the beginning with best crewmates <br> Caesar a cute <br> Vergo kicking ass <br> Law hates fun <br> Kinemon <br> Brokers <br> Kuzan and Doffy <br>~~<br> Monet <br>- - <br> way too long <br> too much running <br> Caesar was a cakewalk <br><br>I want Oda to do another 20-30 chapter arc like Impel Down/Marineford, or every arc before Alabasta. I know that arcs need to be a full year for merchandising and shit but not everything in FI and PH needed to be as long as it was</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I'm gonna need to you get off of him. <br> need to you </br></br>  <br>yeah for the speed that the groups that scanlated the colored version invested they lost a lot of accurancy in return.</br>  It wasn't all that bad. The Yeti's were hyped and was a huge let down and the whole saving the children deal felt a bit forced and unnatural. I didn't really have any problem with the rest, even when I read it weekly.  <br>My only real problem was the cop-out with the gas.</br>  <br>Good to marathon, kinda poor otherwise</br>  <br>Why is Smoker such a jobber post-TS?<br><br> Played by Law  <br> Rekt by Vergo <br> Got his ass handed to him by Doffy <br><br>All in a single short arc. Oda must really hate him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his fruit became nearly useless when Haki was introduced. Since he seemd to rely a lot on it at the beginning, he somehow lost his combat power. I wish oda decided to make him a threat again</br>  <br>The smoke fruit was easily the worst logia<br><br> inb4 the mud fruit was worse <br><br>The swamp fruit allowed for infinite void (like blackbeards) and incredibly entrapment capabilities. <br><br>I'm not saying his fruit is bad, because he IS a logia. But damn his fruit is shit compared to others</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Vergo was the only good seat </br>  <br><br>Well it's bad on the face of how it's been used - it could do so much more really.</br></br>  <br>The saddest thing is that ceasar's fruit is basically a 100 times better version of smoker's. I mean Gas &gt; Smoke. There are so many things ceasar can do while smoke is stupidly limited to hurr durr Imma smoke all over you.</br>  Smoker is probably just going to full on CoA from now. And use his Smoke to proper his punches or whatever.  <br> One piece is shit cause oda can only make luffy be inflated </br>  <br><br>I never understood why Smoker didn't do an attack where he binds them and 'pours' smoke down their throat to fill their lungs and suffocate them.<br><br> inb4 an awakened smoke fruit gives them lung cancer </br></br></br></br>  <br>The gas fruit is easily among the top logias. <br><br>Up there with Darkness and Lightning.<br><br>Caesar can suffocate fire, immediately giving it the edge of the Mera Mera and Magu Magu. <br><br>Lightning can't really exist in the convential sense in a vacuum (which Ceasar can create as seen when he suffocated the strawhats.) so it's got the edge over the lightning fruit. <br><br>Smoke is pretty much a gas, so you figure that one out.<br><br>Without air, snow and ice are pretty much just water so it's got the edge over that. <br><br>The only ones I can't really see it having a massive effect on would be light and darkness, and I'm sure it would have some adverse effect on sand and mud.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah again, fruits are only as strong as the user, like Kizaru.</br></br>  <br> and Magu Magu. <br>magma doesn't burn, it just sets things on fire<br>even if you prevent it from burning you still have thousand-degree molten rock</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because Oda didn't intend on the MC and his crew dying before they even reached the Grand Line.<br><br><br>Is Magma reliant on Oxygen ?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not breaking the empty dielectric <br>Enel can do that</br></br>  <br><br>Well even later on, there's so many better ways Smoker can use his fruit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's true that fruits are dependent on the user. Whitebeard with the weakest fruit you could think of is still incredibly powerful. But you have to consider that fruit's still have some basis of power over one another. Lightning was said to be invincible, Darkness was said to be the strongest logia, Quake was said to be strongest paramecia, Operation fruit is said to be "The ultimate devil fruit", so that's just what I think. All I'm saying is it's blatantly one of the most powerful fruits possible.<br><br><br><br>Not necessarily, but high gusts of winds could probably cool it if strong enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kizaru is shit </br>  <br><br>No I agree - I was just saying it was much stronger than people realize due to Caesar being shit.</br></br>  <br> Whitebeard with the weakest fruit you could think of is still incredibly powerful <br>Why ? All he did was cause Earthquakes. The most basic shit his DF could do. I agree that WB was a strong as dude but he wasn't really all that creative if you think about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Well he rarely fights seriously and hardly takes the Light fruit to the levels it could be.<br><br>His attitude is his own handicap, for what is arguably the strongest power in the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>earthquakes, tsunamis, tilting the entire island, shattering aokijis ice<br><br>what else is there to do</br></br></br>  <br> not bending light rays to be invisible assassinating everyone and become king of the world </br>  It was a nice setup for the Donquixote Family and Dressrosa. It's actually shorter than some people make it out to be. The kids were a plot device to show how vile Caesar and Monet were, and by extension, Doflamingo.<br><br><br>She already appeared.<br> Inb4 kengo <br>You realize a swordsman can be a samurai or just someone who fights with a sword, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enels fruit is just as good if not more so<br>Both are fast enough to basically teleport<br>Both can do ridiculous nukes<br>Both are logias<br>Enel also had island-wide maphack, he could restart his own heart, he could mold gold at will, he built and powered a ship that flew to the moon and could literally vaporize entire islands</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> just someone who fights with a sword, right? <br>Shanks &gt; Mihawk<br>Shanks uses a sword<br>Shanks is the Worlds Strongest Swordsman<br><br>Alright, it's official.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely it's the opposite, even if you're being sarcastic ?</br>  Punk hazard arc ruinned Nami as a character just like Dressrosa ruinned both Sanji and Robin  <br>Shanks may have surpassed Mihawk had he not lost his arm. <br><br>Scratch that, he is stronger than Mihawk.</br></br></br>  <br>Smoker really wasn't shit to begin with, his seastone tipped jitte &amp; weapons training are the only things he ever had going for him. He's just the only one smart enough to use a seastone based weapon.</br>  <br>That's a stretch. And based on nothing.</br>  <br>That, and he was merely an example of what a logia is and is capable of doing. Hell, he was merely the border patrol for the Grand Line, in East Blue.<br><br><br>One is a Yonkou and the other is a Warlord. Not hard to put two and two together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about the better Swordsman, not the better Pirate.</br>  <br> implying Mihawk couldn't become a Yonko if he wanted </br>  <br><br>Never said it wasn't.</br></br>  <br><br>So what? The point is, Shanks may not have the skills Mihawk has with a sword, let alone have a special snowflake sword but that's not all he's capable of doing. He's definitely stronger all along. But I get your point.</br></br>  <br>Just wait for Smoker to awaken his fruit and turn other people into smoke.</br>  dude what if smoker turned into weed smoke and got erry1 relly high lmao  <br>I don't think that's how it works. He might be able to suffocate people without having to shove part of his hand inside someone's throat. Like Crocodile's right hand or whatever.</br>  <br>What if he turned into cigarette smoke and gave everyone cancer like your post just did?</br>  <br>Light&gt;Electricity, considering that charge can't be transmitted without photons. And Enel can only teleport in conducting material.<br><br>I'd think that haki covers that. Just like it makes you see where the light will hit so you avoid it before the laser is released.</br></br></br>  <br>  And Enel can only teleport in conducting material. <br>You mean like, the air?</br></br>  <br>Yet another reason why that DF is wasted on Smoker.</br>  <br>it was good, because Caesar was there</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elect<wbr>rical_resistivity_and_conductivity</wbr></br>  <br>I bet he's secretly by Kizaru for easy highs after Akainu burned down his weed stash.</br>  <br>Outside of his very first appearance, Smoker was never not a jobber<br>Hell, even then, he didn't even capture any pirates</br></br>  What if Luffy was a fishman?  <br>he'd be stronger</br>  <br>but fishmen are all weaklings</br>  <br>What's keeping enel from using a lightning strike as a means of teleportation?</br>  <br>devil fruit magic<br><br>Think of it this way: devil fruits don't turn your body into rubber, or electricity, or whatever.<br><br>They grant your body magical properties /resembling/ those of rubber or electricity or whatever.<br><br>It'll make your brain hurt less when you try to think about how they work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, Luffy is made out of rubber, even under the effects of seastone. Logias, on the other hand, can turn into their element at will (even subconsciously after some training). <br><br>Don't know if that works. He was never shown to travel through anything non-conductive.</br></br></br>  <br>Jinbe isn't. And he's pretty much the only fishman that matters.</br>  <br>Wait what? Devil fruits don't make you resemble an element. They transform your body into the element. Not just a resemblance but full on transformation.</br>  <br> Wrong, Luffy is made out of rubber, even under the effects of seastone.  <br><br> Wait what? Devil fruits don't make you resemble an element. They transform your body into the element. Not just a resemblance but full on transformation. <br><br>But that's obviously wrong. Luffy's body behaves like what a 6 year old might think rubber is like, but not actually real rubber. Half the shit he does has no basis in the real world at all, and he doesn't do half the shit rubber would actually cause. <br><br>He's not rubber, he's a weird magic material that looks and acts like rubber kinda sorta that is called rubber for brevity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>luffy isn't normal rubber<br>if he was he'd die for starters</br></br>  <br> Don't know if that works. He was never shown to travel through anything non-conductive. <br><br>You're right, but I don't really sure why he shouldn't be able to, since he's a lightning man and lightning travels through air</br></br></br>  <br>Jinbe fought to a standstill with Ace.<br><br>Fucking Ace.<br><br>The strongest fishman alive, is on par with a guy who was one-shot by an Admiral.<br><br>Fishmen suck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon it's a mongolian picture book<br>I don't think 100% realisim is the intent here</br></br>  <br> but not actually real rubber <br>Yeah, no shit. But his body is still made out of One Piece universe rubber.</br></br>  <br>That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm glad we agree.</br>  <br> real world <br>are you seriously watching one piece going "that's not how it works in the real world"?</br></br>  <br>Considering that Jinbe is just a dude and Ace was a fucking Logia, that's pretty goddamn impressive. Luffy didn't stand 2 seconds against his first Logia. he almost died 3 times against his second. Only beat the 3rd because he literally was the one person who could counter the fruit.</br>  <br> are you seriously watching one piece going "that's not how it works in the real world"? <br><br>No, I'm responding to the guy watching One Piece and asking "wait, why can't he do X that he could do in the real world?"<br><br>Also<br> watching <br> one piece </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you realize that brooks obnoxious comic relief persona is the result of damage to his personality from spending 50 years in complete solitude   <br>Sure, the first THREE Logias Luffy ever faced were rough, before he had even heard of Haki. Luffy's been at sea for &lt;3 years now and doesn't give a bigger shit about Logias than any other fruit user. Ace had been at sea for what, 3-4 years by Marineford? You can't compare Ace with 3-4 years at sea to Luffy's first few logia opponents.<br><br>And you can't even argue that Luffy has an advantage due to being trained by Rayleigh, because Ace was under an even stronger guy AND in the New World.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what ? No, let's focus on Jinbe. Dude fought against Ace for 5 bloody days. What;s the furthest Luffy has gone without eating ? 3 days ? When he's out cold after fighting and almost dying ? Jinbe even tanked Akainu's magma so that's another point for him.</br>  <br>That's also why he doesn't actually talk to anybody, just talks at them.</br>  <br>Yes, Jinbe took ONE HIT from an admiral and was on the verge of death. A hit he was unable to block or avoid.<br><br>He's shit. There's no strong fishman. No admiral-tier, no yonko-tier.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger, the strongest fucking man in the entire goddamn World got half his fucking face blown off by that magma cunt. Jinbe is the strongest fishman in the World. Better than Shirahoshi, even.</br>  <br> the strongest fucking man in the entire goddamn World got half his fucking face blown off by that magma cunt. <br><br>As an eldery man on the verge of death.<br><br>  Jinbe is the strongest fishman in the World. <br>I don't disagree. In fact, that's my point exactly.<br><br>Fishmen are weak.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you even take shirahoshi as a comparison? She is fucking weak to say the least.</br>  <br> As an elderly man on the verge of death <br>Still was the Strongest Man in the World.<br><br>Jinbe achieved the same feat as Whitebeard, hence he's as strong as a Yonko.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because of Poseidon. Some people get a shit fest when people say ''Shirahoshi is weak''.</br>  <br> Jinbe achieved the same feat as Whitebeard <br><br>No, WB lost half his face and didn't slow down. Further, he was old and dying of age, AND suffering a myriad of other injuries.<br><br>Jinbe got hit one time and almost died.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, no, they both got hit. One died, the other didn't. That's all I'm saying bro. Jinbe stronger than Whitebeard, confirmed.</br>  <br> only argument that fishmen aren't weak is shitposting <br><br>I accept your concession</br></br></br>  <br>Massive troll.<br>Don't fall for the bait anon.</br></br>  <br> One is a Yonkou and the other is a Warlord <br> Meanwhile a pirate who isn't either of those things has been facestomping warlords left and right <br>muh powerlevels</br></br></br>  <br>It's their fucking problem if they can't handle the truth.<br><br>Shirahoshi is weak. <br><br>What good is the power to control the sea kings when any decent pirate can one-shot you before you can even say a word.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, saying Jinbe is weak just because he got hit by Akainu is pretty bullshit too. Double standards, people.</br></br>  <br>Jinbe is weak because he's fucking weak.<br><br>He fought to a draw with fucking Ace.<br><br>Again, there's not a single god damn fishman that's Yonkou or Admiral level. Fishmen are shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It´s not like there´s actually a race out there stronger than humans.<br>Even giants are dogshit now.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I know Shirahoshi is weak but I just didn't want to cause a drama which leads to other people causing drama which leads to more shitposting which leads to more fujoposting which leads to everyone and their mothers complaining about how shit OP threads are everyone telling each other to kill themselves which summons Rebeccafag for some fucking reason, which causes the thread to go even lower, which is pretty much a fucking achievement in itself. <br><br>It ain't that simple bro.</br></br></br>  <br>And Ace could beat Luffy. Ergo Jinbe could beat Luffy, who's the future Pirate King. Therefore Jinbe is stronger than the Pirate King.<br><br>I have no qualms over shitposting, friend.</br></br></br>  <br> Even giants are dogshit now. <br> Implying giants haven't been shit since day one <br>Dorry &amp; Broggy seemed to get toppled pretty easily</br></br></br>  <br> So now that the dust has settled, what do you think about the Punk Hazard arc? <br>We got Monet so I can't say it was absolutely worthless.</br></br>  <br>Well shit. I didn't think that far ahead but damn you're right.</br>  <br>You're also the only one between the two of us that's shitposting.<br><br>Jinbe is the strongest fishman.<br><br>Jinbe could not take any admiral or yonkou, all human, in a fight.<br><br>Fishmen suck shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically the strongest man in the World couldn't defeat Akainu either. Guy was just fine after that beat down.</br>  <br>Man, everything is a bloody time bomb these days. I just want to enjoy these threads for as much as possible before it all goes down hill.</br>  <br> Jinbe could not take any admiral or yonkou <br>Admirals are backed up by particularly broken devil fruits.</br></br>   next chapter <br> marco cover story <br> chapter starts with a big dent on big mam's ship <br> That bastard black leg sanji almost made a hole in our ship-bon <br> doffy gets assassinated by cp0 <br> luffu and co start to sail for zou </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except for garp.</br>  <br> strongest man in the World <br><br>What a bunch of imbeciles you Whitebeard Pirates are!<br><br>Well I suppose it's no surprise your captain being who he is.<br><br>After all Whitebeard is nothing but a loser from a dead era!<br><br>Gold Roger conquered the entire Grand Line. He gave his life to open the door on a new era the Great Age of Pirates. A Navy man like me probably shouldn't say this but that man truly deserved the title of "Pirate King".!<br><br>What is Whitebeard when compared to that? I mean did he even have the guts to fight against Roger? All he's ever done is hide in some safe corner of the world and keep himself out of trouble right? These days some fools may claim Whitebeard's name alone upholds peace on various islands. But as far as I'm concerned he just intimidates the small-fry and believes himself a hero for it.<br><br>Ridiculous! Roger maintained his honor as long as he lived and even dead his fellow pirates hailed him as a king. In other words Whitebeard is an eternal loser who will never surpass Roger! That is all he is.<br><br>Everything I've said is the truth. Now that I think of it he sure is one pitiful man. Making all his underlings call him their "Old Man" or "Father" or whatever and sailing the seas playing house.<br><br>He reigned the seas for decades yet he never became a king or gained anything. He got himself stabbed because one of those foolish "sons" of his believed every word I said and now he'll die to protect that same fool. Truly an empty existence.<br><br>If man does not live righteously he does not deserve to live at all! You rogue pirates don't deserve a "place to belong"!<br><br>Whitebeard will die a loser! A fitting end for a little fish in a big pond!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this post <br> everyone got cancer </br></br>  <br>Surely Akainu would shit on Roger too ? It's not like he had some kind of personal vendetta against Whitebeard. It's time people updated this pasta.</br>  <br> I just want to enjoy these threads for as much as possible before it all goes down hill. <br>Then tell people to stop bringing up powerlevels since clearly no one is mature enough to discuss it<br>also get rid of dumbasses who don't know the difference between admirals and vice-admirals</br></br></br>  <br>Ace is dead akainu.<br>The bait isn't going to work on anybody else.<br>So go back at being a government puppy.</br></br></br>  <br>Hah, if only the World worked like that. A person speaking against powerlevels would became the bait for the powerlevelfags who'd argue about titles and positions and shit. It's pretty inevitable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128350482 <br>Seems like I have to write another mail to moot</br>  <br>It's a fucking battle shonen so of course there will be powerlevel discussions. You can't eliminate that element from discussion.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I admitted to making that mistake. But I wonder if the two are still evenly matched.</br>  <br>Shit like this is unfortunately inevitable in 4chan and more so in /a/ where somehow all the children roam.</br>  Why is 50% of the strawhats useless fodder?  <br>Ace could beat Luffy? Are you high? You better mean pre-TS Luffy. Ace is a weak fucboi.</br>  <br><br>Because franky is strong enough to compensate for nearly the whole crew without even using his mecha</br></br>  <br>Not that guy but I have nothing against powerlevel discussions. But what we have on /a/ is everything but a discussion. It's 2 or more idiots shitposting and ruining the thread without discussing a damn thing.</br>  <br>Exactly. And that's precisely why I try my best to cover my bases so I don't accidentally bait and annoy someone.</br>  <br>Because the only thing that matters to marineford babies are fights.</br>  <br>Well, considering that Ace isn't alive Post-TS, yes, I meant Pre-TS.</br>  <br> Jinbe is the strongest fishman. <br><br>That's just sad. An island were the scrubs start off with x10 the strength of humans, even better underwater, and then whatever additional abilities their sea creature blood carries. It's practically an island of Zoan or at least SMILE users. They also have unique fighting styles were they hit the water in people's bodies with Fishman Karate or can manipulate the water itself with Fishman Jujutsu, but hardly anyone knows this and the best they can produce is Jimbe. Hody needed dozens of pills to be a threat, Neptune's can't do anything, Namur looks like a smaller Jimbe but he still has potential, and Hack got the Maynard treatment. Oda really fucked up by making them a weak island that got raped and captured by pirates regularly.</br></br></br>  Is anyone else hoping for a more lax arc in the near future?<br>A shorter, more light-hearted one with not as many fights and more opportunities for Strawhat sillyness.</br>  <br>Don't get smart with me.</br>  <br> A shorter, more light-hearted one with not as many fights and more opportunities for Strawhat sillyness. <br>So ... you want a manga filler arc?</br></br>  <br>Why ? That easy to outsmart you ?</br>  <br> manga  <br> filler <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> no fights is filler <br><br>I want an arc like that too, its probably just nostalgia for pre timeskip arcs like water 7 and shit</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ace was apparently equal to Jinbe (fought for 5 days)<br><br>Can current Luffy defeat Jinbe in a fight? Honestly I'm not sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the crew desperately needs one so that everyone who isn't named Luffy, Zoro or Usopp can have an actual character again.</br>  <br>Current Luffy would shit on Ace.</br>  <br>what happened</br>  Punk Hazard was great except for that it was literally running, the arc.<br><br>Vergo and Monet were quality villains. Vergo ended up being the strongest executive in retrospect. Caesar had a lot of cool attacks even though we know now that Luffy and Zoro were sandbagging could've one shotted him at any moment.<br><br>I just wish that Vergo and Monet stay dead. I know they won't. It makes their final interactions with Doffy that much more meaningful if they had actually died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's some tricks we've seen Smoker do that no other Logia did, like projecting his smoke-arms while the hand is still physicla and, say, grasping his jutte, or flanking an enemy by covering an area in smoke and emerging from it<br>I got the feeling it's kind of a mobility oriented fruit, which is kinda shit compared to say the Pika Pika no Mi, but they can't all be absolute winners and everyone can have his niche<br>Also for some reason it seems like it and the Mera Mera no Mi cancel each other out, which is fucking amazing considering its reputation</br></br></br>  <br>The best way to beat Smoker is to set up a large Fan.</br>  <br>I don't like how they made Smoker into an eternal jobber. He was supposed to be like Garp was to Roger. Now I think even Usopp and Nami would oneshot him.</br>  The problem with the recent arcs is that there's too much focus on side charactes and not enough on the crew members.  <br>Calm down m8 and smoke 420 blaze it magmafag!!!</br>  <br>That's going too far anon.</br>  <br>I just realised that the 4 crewmates exploring the island + Franky were the ones who stayed on Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Let's not exaggerate that much.</br>  <br>Brook and Sanji kinda explored the Island too.</br>  Who's the next nakama?<br><br>Everyone knows Jinbei's going to join or tragically die in the process so he doesn't count.</br></br>  <br>I'd put Jimbei on the same level as Sanji atm. Considering Sanji hasn't revealed his special kicks yet, this can be thought to be a pretty accurate estimation.</br>  <br>Bellamy.</br>  <br>Rebecca was good fanservice, but aside from that this character was one of the most annoying of the whole manga, alongside Momonosuke, Brook and Wanze.</br>  <br>How is that a problem?<br>Personally I love how oda is giving the attention to law and in the future other supernova/worst generation. We've already have stories and arcs dedicated to the crew members now we have to explore other characters such as the worst generation pirates.</br></br>  <br>Springy Dick.<br>Followed by  Caesar .</br></br>  <br>No way she's 16 years old.</br>  <br>I think there will be a "B-team alliance" that stays on the Straw Hats' side forever but isn't officially part of the team.<br><br>Jinbei should be the final Strawhat.</br></br></br>  <br>I really got turned on when Luffy pinned her down. But then I got pissed at those youtube comments from Ameridumbs who literally think they are the highest upholders of morality and ethics.</br>  What would be the shittiest logia to ever exist?<br> Other than a literal shit/piss one. </br>  <br>Knowing Oda it would be something like a fart logia.<br><br>I guess glass would be pretty shitty. You could cut people but would get smashed instantly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You were saying Magma brat?</br></br>  do you guys think there will be a point in the story where shanks and buggy fight together again? I really want to see them tag team someone or multiple people  <br>Slime logia?</br>  <br>paper logia from the gba game</br>  <br>They're probably connected like Doflamingo was with Kaidou</br>  <br>Can this be a figurine?</br>  <br>A paper devil fruit power can be devastating if used correctly.</br>  <br>What was the name of the girl from Read or Die? The Paper. Not the three girls, but the original.</br>  The best Logia is Cloud<br><br> Lightning anytime <br> Smoke-like powers <br>  Weather Control <br> Flight </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everyone who isn't Luffy, Zoro or Usopp can have an actual character again <br>Luffy- yeah sure, he has a character<br>Usopp- great character, probably one of the best written<br>Zoro- uh. No. His character is ME STRONG YOU DEAD WITTY ONE LINER</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good doujin. One of the only 2 Rebecca ones I could find. The other one was a little weird.</br>  <br>because they have roles on the ship and you can write more funny/interesting scenes if some strawhats are strong and some are weak</br>  <br>I'm thinking it could be like the one in JJBA part 4. Once the guy with it as a stand figures out your fear and fear tic then he can turn you into paper. He could also turn inanimate objects like guns into paper and then make them normal again to use.</br>  <br>That's either Caesar's gas logia or a water logia.</br>  <br>there are like a thousand times more humans than fishmen</br>  <br>I mean the ones who drew the lot, not the ones after.</br>  <br> Usopp- great character, probably one of the best written <br><br>It's weird seeing all this Usopp love , I haven't read past Fishman Island but does he get a much bigger spotlight post-timeskip? It seems that people love him more than sanji now.</br></br></br>  The bad things were just too bad:]<br><br>-Fucking let me waste some chapters and put Nami in a good light kids.<br>-Deadly gas of death that was not so deadly.<br>-The crew lost to sleeping gas 3 times.<br>-The worst character of One Piece yet: Yeti Cool Brothers. Even Curiel is better, yes fucking Curiel.<br>-Running.<br>-High exposition to random mooks.<br><br>It had hype though, like :<br><br>-Pirate alliance "against" a Yonko.<br>-Doffy moves.<br>-Aokiji´s whereabouts.<br>-Hype for future Aokiji vs Akainu flashback.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Oda confirm that Water DF would be too OP in an SBS?</br>  <br><br>get out of here fuccboi, I heard the WG calling for you again</br></br>  <br>because saji is a jobber and is 10 years since he made something awesome</br>  <br>Tashigi &gt; Monet, as the events themselves show.</br>  Which villain do you think got off the easiest?  <br>tashigi would not have won a 1v1, but still tashigi&gt;monet because tashigi got lucky and got the genetics that makes zoro want to protect her</br>  <br><br>Caesar</br></br>  <br>Don Krieg, becaue when Luffy beat him down he had nothing left to lose anyway</br>  <br>But he did<br>All the fucking time.</br></br>  <br>Akainu is such a master troll. He knew exactly what he was doing and he baited Ace so hard.</br>  Could Akainu defeat Madara Uchiha?  <br><br>I'm sorry for asking but where can I read colored scans or in the very least where the chapter is all on one page instead of<br>having to click every page. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>kissanime</br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004<br><br>It only goes up to chapter 700 by the way, But that's not really a problem since that's like 7/8 of entire manga.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah well, Ace was an easy target: stubborn, violent, proud and reckless<br>Really he didn't grow up much from when he was a brat hiding in a mountain bandit hideout, he just put a lid of good manners on that</br></br>  <br>I've been rereading it ever since I found about the colored ones and continuing from 700 without color really sucks now.</br>  <br>Roger was just like that, Ace would have never grow out of being reckless and think of others before him.</br>  <br> bro <br> bro <br> bro </br></br></br>  <br>The OP manga looks so amazing with colour, it kinda looked unappealing without colour after watching the anime but once I found those I jizzed my pants. The panels look like a clusterfuck if you're used to reading in colour.</br>  <br>basically the same ussop bs as always, either hes throwing rotten egg, running around with a mask, or winning because of how retarded his personality is, oda literally took the small nuances the crew had in the crew and magnified them times 100. chopper became a monster teddy bear, nami went from flat chested to cow in the span of 2-3 years, robin still fine af tbh, sanji hasnt done a goddamn thing except run after females and get his shit rekt, franky i have to admit is badass, luffy is luffy, and zoro's design gives him a clear advantage over every enemy</br>  <br>Well that's because you have shit taste but it's ok, children need their books colored.</br>  <br><br>Usopp stole everyone hearts on the Going Merry death (Water 7) that arc gave a backbone and another very rich dimension to the character, he also proven hes baddass when standing ground facing Luffy</br></br>  <br><br>And now he's a God.</br></br>  <br>Kissmanga you muppet.</br>  <br>Yes, Luffy has the capacity to fuck Jinbe up if he hasn't gotten any stronger since Marineford.</br>  <br> spoonfeeding a bait <br>Will you ever learn?<br><br><br> being a retard <br>this is too sad</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and that's the joke</br>  Friendly reminder Garp is literally shit<br> could have raised the son of the Pirate king and the son of the revolutionaries and grandson of the legendary marine hero on his own,making them an unstoppable duo <br> could have eliminated the future pirate king without even knowing it <br> could have been their mentor and protector until they were both strong enough to make it to VA <br>Instead he threw them with a bandit and said "lol you better not become pirates you little shits"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy was corrupted by that filthy pirate Shanks before he even got to Dadan.</br>  <br><br>You realize he couldn't just fuck off from the Marines as a VA right?

Takes away all the big deal that was made around the poison.<br><br>The samurai should have survived the poison using his clothing power by creating a special breathing suit.

They're naturally proud and hateful of humans and therefore need to be taken down a notch. This doesn't mean just humans and an orc can be used instead to show her that she isn't so high and mighty as she imagined. <br><br>Half-elf: Meant for tender loving. Half elves receive little acceptance in human society since they're frequently mistaken for full elves and in most elf societies they're instantly killed or expelled for tainting the bloodline. All of these factors lead to the creation of a submissive but extremely cute girl who becomes loyal and loving the instant somebody shows her a shred of kindness after a lifetime of pain and suffering.<br><br>Dark-elf: It's a mixed bag. In some setting Dark elves are seen as domineering and even more xenophobic than white elves which means that instead of being raped, they're the ones to do the raping and frequently raid human travelers in order to secure husbands and rape victims. In other settings dark elves lie at the other end of the spectrum and are discriminated against even more than white elves for being brown-skinned as well as their long ears. In these cases their designated role should be housemaid that falls in love with her master and happily gives herself to him for being so kind where her previous masters abused her.<br><br>Dark-Half-Elf:Spunky tomboys who wear spats and fuck their childhood friends until their dicks start whistling.

High elves are the typical arrogant elf, like the one you describe. There's also wood elves, who are on the whole much friendlier to humans and the ones responsible for 90% of the half-elves.<br><br>Both have some overlapping features, but they are on the whole unique; most anime just combine the two. For example, the pure blooded elves in Zero no Tsukaima act a lot like high elves, with their incredibly arrogant attitude and condescending view of humanity. Wood elves are much friendlier to humans, but they are still arrogant: just about one thing. Probably their shooting skills. <br><br>Wood elves are nearly always archers, though they might have a bit of magic skill as well. Very skilled hunters and adept at roaming about the forest. High elves are far more likely to rely on spells to do the heavy lifting, but they sometimes uses bows as well if they can't spam spells.<br><br>Wood elves congregate in large forests so contact with humans is inevitable, the high elves use them as a buffer for their own cities far, far away from humans and even more isolated.<br><br>There's a shit ton of other elf types, Drows and Snow/Cave/Sea/Etc but those two I discussed often get mixed up and are the most common variety encountered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't do it anon<br><br>it's NTR</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;An elf 165 years old, though is considered to be in her teens by her race's standards. </br>  <br>I am okay with this</br>    <br> Implying Dwarves aren't better <br>Can Elves hammer?

So yes, laws that apply to humans at large would apply to them.<br><br>For the most part anyways. It would probably spawn another civil rights debate, about how many rights they REALLY have.<br><br>Besides, even animal rights would make raping them illegal, seeing how they would be in clear distress.

If I want to fuck my sister, and she wants to fuck me, then why should you care? My motto is, if you aren't killing, destroying peoples shit, stealing or raping, do what the fuck you want.  <br>No, you're the one that doesn't know what it means faggot. Saying &gt;hur dur just because I didn't know who Lelouch was because I haven't seen Code Geass doesn't mean I'm a newfag, is bullshit. It's common knowledge, you'd have to be new as fuck to not know who Lelouch is, and in the same capacity you'd have to be new as fuck to not know Satsuki and Ryuko are sisters. It's common knowledge because it's absolutely everywhere<br><br>Fuck off and lurk moar fag.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fundamentally right attitude, but you might fall prey to viewing things in way too simplistic ways.<br><br>Some things can be very indirectly harmful. (I'm not implying that incest is one of these.)<br><br>Sometimes so indirect that the only link is the fact that you contribute to a culture-wide mentality which harms some people you never knew existed, or harms them in such a way that even they themselves think is normal and acceptable (because they're also living in the same culture) so even they don't speak up themselves. For example this is the case with cultures that see sex as something inherently aggressive and such, calling it "fucking" etc., thinking that penetration defines sex. Women enjoy clitoral stimulation most, not sex. A very large number of women can't regularly orgasm from sex, because they and their partner both have no fucking idea what they're doing and think the woman should reach orgasm from being ruthlessly penetrated.<br><br>A less indirect example is /a/'s constant half-joking glorification of rapist attitudes, especially towards little girls. Recently some idiot in a loli thread suddenly started talking about how he'd like to fuck his 9 year-old sister. No matter how many people yell "2D only!" it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill <br> Common knowledge <br>When did shit series become common knowledge, anon?</br></br></br>  <br> it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished. <br><br>Fucking this. The "darkest corner of the internet" that is the 4chinz laughed and ridiculed other peoples' closet homosexuality, pedophilia, and autism. You used to expose your own retardation for other people to laugh at. And you would do the same for others. Now, it's become a hugbox and anyone who has a disagreeable attitude toward their "muhwaifu" and "muhloli" circlejerking is branded as a "normie". <br><br>Ironically, the loli fetish is becoming one of the most casual fetishes out there with an astounding number of tags in most boorus. And your average kid on LoL talks about having Janna as his "waifu". The average /a/utist is the true normie with an elitist facade. Fucking disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe when it aired and there were five threads for it at any given time?</br>  <br>The motto is for most situations, I don't have a particular ideology so I take social issues one at a time to form an opinion about. I can't put every single thing I have an opinion on in one motto, anon, that would be silly.</br>  <br>So you visit shit threads?</br>  <br>The only things that get spoilers are new events in the source materials, and info in the shows on simulcast. Spoilers aren't used that much because if you really don't want something spoiled you will watch said anime and not be on /a/. If you want to avoid spoilers don't go on /a/</br>  <br>mom x daughter incest is the purest form of love</br>  <br>I visit /a/, that's my point.

I know that I love my sister in a brotherly way and I care about her a lot, so maybe I'm mistaking regular brotherly love with romantic feelings.<br><br><br>It's okay, I'm beyond the point where I can be helped now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Ririko isn't canon </br>  <br> dated <br>get out normie</br></br>  <br> Brotherzoned <br>Sorry to here that anon.</br></br>  <br>It's the purest form of giving me a boner</br>  <br>If you don't like koikishi purely kiss episode 2, then you are confirmed homosexual.

And are we still talking about anime on /a/ or real life?</br>  My big sister was my first kiss. She'd always been incredibly affectionate when she was drunk, cuddling on to me and cooing, "You know how much I love you, right? You know how much I love my little brother." One of these times she pecked me on the lips. I followed her and we ended up making out on the couch for half an hour. I was 14, she was 23.<br><br>Easily the hottest and most heartpounding moment of my life. If I'd been braver I might have made something of it. She's married with a kid now, so I lost my chance.

When we are talking about society and rules, I bet you think Nazi Germany and oppression. On the other hand, society and norms are necessary for modern life, and the reason why you comfortably sit posting on your computer.<br><br>Very existence of society makes it possible for people to find happiness. Granted, happiness could most likely be found in a different environment, but so far human history has not reached these environments, as lack of order has mostly caused said oppression and instability.<br><br>Saying happiness cannot exist under rules and norms is ridiculous, even though you don't have firsthand experience of said happiness.<br><br><br>Yeah, it goes both ways. The fact you have not found happiness does not mean the happiness doesn't exist. I think it is ridiculous to classify modern life and relationships existing only for benefit. Right now you are stating "happiness does not exist because I say so".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Crossboarding scum please leave.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well. If you can't figure it out on your own, then find the person you trust the most and seek advice. Be totally honest. Include the weird incest and suicidal bits. Work through it togther. You can figure it out.</br>  <br>Not that anon but that is pretty bad advice, I for one do not have a person I'd be comfortable discussing the subjects</br>  <br>Or get turned in to the police.</br>  <br> It seems you believe things can be perceived as black and white. <br>That's on you though, my first reply was<br> Not close to all of it of couse. <br>It's you that think it's all white and pretend I said it was black. If there were no questioning of standards we wouldn't have improved. I'm happy that all the people in the past didn't simply think "people can find happiness while complying to these rules so why change" and I can only hope they will be even better for the future generation.<br><br>Regardless this is not anime, and I just wanted to discuss why anime incest is great anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, I missed that part. I thought you were one of those edgemasters preaching how world is evil.</br>  <br>I'm not suicidal, I'm just a little fucked in the head right now. I don't have anyone I trust that much so I feel like the easiest way I can talk about it is with anons. I won't kill myself I know that for sure, but I don't think I'll ever be as happy as most people. But again this isn't the place, thanks for the advice though.</br>  <br>Chopping up your dick and then folding it inwards, is that better?</br>  <br>Anon, why don't you go and be gay somewhere else?</br>  <br>My sister's a bitch but if I have to choose to fuck my sister or my mother, it would be sister everytime</br>  <br> tfw i used to be a leftie, but now i'm completely ambidextrous <br>Feels good</br></br>  <br><br>I remember I saw something an anon posted about his relationship with her sis in /v/ but his family beat the crap out of him, called him a pervert and degenerate. I think the thing didnt end well for him as last time he posted was that his family was a dick and told everything to his friends and he became an outcast (he had to leave the college and went to another city).<br><br>The post was deleted since I cant find anything on the archive, but some anons saved it. Anyone got it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess not all stories have a happy ending. At least it didn't take a car accident to bring him and his sister together.</br>  Why does every incest thread devolve to blogging fanfiction shit?  <br>If you think I'm degenerate you are degenerate.</br>  <br>Because instead of touching your siblings at night, you touch yourself.</br>  <br> incest <br>Doesn't anyone here know what westermarck effect is?</br></br>  The best part about reading doujins for shit like this is that a lot of them could be canon. The Koi Kaze doujins, for instance, i consider fully canon.<br> Chapter 5 of pic related fucking never </br>  <br><br>Ya but its fucking disgusting that your own family exclude you like that. I remember the guy said there was a meeting and the family asked him not to show up or he'll regret it.</br></br>  <br><br>I went through something similar. My family is old fashioned, and had already picked someone for me to be with, but I was already dating a girl i had loved for years. When they found out, they ended up disowning me. Something about weakening the family's position, and being a liability by loving someone so weak.</br></br>  <br>Brutal</br>  <br> doubting Freud <br>Any supposed evidence has been equally debunked so the term is basically a buzzword to try and support incest taboos. It's a result of trying to explain that people heavily indoctrinated into believing that incest is something that absolutely mustn't be done as a result of social ideals</br></br>  <br>Going to /v/ for any advice sounds like a terrible plan.</br>  <br><br>I just dont remember how it started, but he wasn't asking for advice.

She gives birth to a little girl; I now have a little half-sister.  <br> Mother is super-religious, so my older sister can't abort. I am a father at 12.  <br> my older sister kept right on beating me up, forcing me to eat her out every night.  <br> mother comes home while I'm changing my little sister's diaper <br> calls me a pedophile rapist <br> I get sent to live with my father.  <br>(cont'd)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Flash forward a few years. It's 2005, I'm 25. I have a lot of emotional problems. <br> girlfriend is legit crazy, as in me getting a restraining order, moving out of state, switching jobs and buying a gun crazy.  <br> get a call from my mother's friend. <br> mother has had a stroke, I need to come home and look after her.  <br> and if there's any funny stuff with my little sister they're going to cut my cock off and run it through the garbage disposal.  <br> go home, mother is mostly bedridden between trips to the the physical therapist to regain mobility.  <br> I take a job working graveyard shift. Can't stand being around people, lots of depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts. <br> get introduced to 4chan, literally hang out on 4chan at work all day, erry day.  <br> my little sister is hot. as. fuck.  <br> She's 14, tiny little butt, perky tits, the works.  <br> I'm supposed to be her big brother but there's this weird awkwardness between us like I'm the cool older brother/ complete stranger living in her house <br> I come home when she's just going to school, so when she leaves I go into her bedroom and beat off every single day <br> I cum in her used panties, her bed, into her pillowcase, into her socks <br> if there's a place that semen can go in her room, it was there.  <br> start making breakfast for her <br> fried eggs, sausage, pancakes, etc <br> naturally everything has a healthy dollop of cum in it.  <br> I shoot off into the food while she's in the shower <br> my little sister thinks I'm the coolest guy ever for fixing her breakfast all the time <br> I start talking about what I'm doing on /a/ <br> there's a lot of incredulity, some disgust (not much) and a lot of support that I should do the deed with her.  <br> there's no way I can do it, but the suggestion is liquid courage.  <br> I get alcohol, and we drink together. Once she's sufficiently inebriated I kiss her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's 2005, I'm 25. <br>nigga you old</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Suddenly she's all over me, and we end up fucking in the shower, and then afterwords we go into her room and we fuck some more. I must have came at least three times that night.  <br> The next day, the reality of what I've done hits me. I got my little sister drunk and fucked her.  <br> things are instantly incredibly awkward between us. We literally don't speak to each other or are even in the same room as each other for three months.  <br> mother is much better, so I pack up my things and move.  <br><br> it's 2009. I'm in therapy, trying to get my shit together.  <br> it's not working out. I can't tell the therapist that I was forced to have sex with my older sister, that I got her pregnant, that I got my little sister drunk and took advantage of her.  <br> I'm constantly thinking I should kill myself.  <br> It's my birthday, and I get a text from my little sister; she wants my mailing address.  <br> oh god. My world has come to an end. It's time to face up to what I've done.  <br> give her my address.  <br> an hour later she's at my house.  <br> She'd tracked me down. she'd taken a scholarship at a college in town.  <br> she told me that she loved me and that she wanted to be with me, and that she probably didn't think it would work out but she wanted to try.  <br> we try to make it work <br> between 2009 and 2011 I try to kill myself several times.  <br> most of my hair has fallen out, I'm blind in one eye, I've get a lot of heart and nerve problems.  <br> my sister gets pregnant, and we nearly split up because of it.  <br> both because I want to abort and she doesn't, and because I told her about what happened with my older sister and the daughter I haven't seen.  <br> she's super determined to make this work </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's 2015 <br> everyone thinks we're a married couple <br> there's never a day that I don't think that this is fucked up.  <br> it's 100% fucked up.  <br> working hard at keeping myself together.  <br> my little sister came out as lesbian to the family and they disowned her <br> nobody knows we're together since we live so far away from the family. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. <br>Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact</br></br>  <br>Your family never questioned how your 'lesbian' sister got pregnant and just believed her enough to disown her?</br>   tfw incest anime turned you into a siscon   irl   <br>I've been a siscon since I realized what my dick was for.

That's all you need to know. <br><br>Incest is another story. Since we're programmed to find reproduction with blood "repulsive", it's a deviation from the norm.

He fights for morality.  I want to protect that blush.  <br>Doubtful. It's a bit too early for that. They'll probably raise Tsubasa and Gel on a pedestal for a while for saving Rui's life and ask why the other Gatchaman didn't help. Build both of them up as the true saviors before having them come crashing down and causing Gel to turn evil in the process. Then understanding and hand-holding happens, and suddenly everyone fights as a team and an understanding ending occurs. Oh, and Katz probably goes crazy at one point because someone had hurt Hajime.</br>  <br>Why would Katze go crazy about someone hurting Hajime?</br>  <br>Because it's clear that he likes her. He's a massive tsundere when it comes to her. No amount of his bullshit works on her, she saw him in his real self and still accepted him. It's true love.</br>  Next episode is called 2-6-2, so we'll probably hear more of Rizumu's ideas.<br><br><br>Agreed.

Soon you may change your mind. </br>  <br> Hanayo &gt; anyone <br> Having taste this shit <br><br>Also Kotori &gt; Umi and everyone else is irrelevant</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking any of the three main girls <br><br>Top shit taste, mate.</br></br></br>    <br> Being enough of a hipster to discredit main girls solely on the basis that they are main girls <br><br>Also all the raibus are main girls, are you fucking high?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off beta.<br><br>Honkers &gt;= Bird/Umi = Nozomi = Horosho &gt; the rest &gt; shit &gt; Nico</br></br></br>  <br>Honoka a fatty  cute fatty. </br>  <br> implying that's the reason <br> all of them are main girls <br><br>The three main girls all have significant flaws that make them shitty characters.<br><br>Also, stay retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Those shirts are so hot</br>  What is the best single and why is Future Style?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=szM<wbr>K2THOldE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Eli endorsed her <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>Why student prez have a terrible fashion sense?</br></br>  <br>Oh god more please</br>  <br>She didn't care, she just wanted Honk to go away so she could bang Nozomi.</br>  <br> &gt;overworks herself to the point where she ruins the rooftop concert for everyone <br>That is correct but it only happened because everyone relied too much on Honoka; and telling her that she has to do her best. Kotori actually sided with Honoka against Umi's caution.<br><br> &gt;ignores Kotori's feelings and gets mad at her for not saying that she'd leave the group earlier. <br>That's Kotori damn fault for not telling Honoka sooner but waited till the last moment. <br><br>Later, Honoka even apologized to Kotori but burd pulled a dick move and never replied.<br> <br> &gt;forces drama by announcing that she leaving the group because of stupid reasons <br>She left because without Kotori there is no point in continuing. They have promised to stay together forever but Kotori broke that at the worst time. Granted this is also another wrong move from Honoka by ignoring other people hopes and dreams riding on her and muse, but this is understandable given her age.<br><br> &gt;To the point where Umi has to slap her to wake her the fuck up <br>This is a dick move by Umi. She should have understood why Honoka was so depressed, after all, she warned burd about it and even went out of her way to reveal the secret before it too late. The slap changed nothing as Honoka still determined to leave. It might have made the situation worse if Honoka were not a nice girl and slapped her right back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why does she like dinosaurs so much</br>  <br>That's an evolutionary secret.</br>  Honk is love, Honk is live.

I'll see how S1 is though.  <br><br>S1 was fun, S2 nothing fucking happened until the last episodes. S3 was ok.</br></br>  Would you a Charlotte?  Can't would a comet, sorry.  <br>I'd Nao in the butt.</br>  <br>it sad best girl appeared only twice for like 5 seconds</br>  Who is Charlotte?  <br>Any lewd of her or imouto yet?</br>    <br>Charlotte is the comet.</br>  I'm thinking about watching God Eater and I was wondering if the MC was an annoying retard like Eren from Attack on Titan?  Thoughts the first two episodes:<br>- Utsugi Renka seems like a failed atttempt to combine Yu Narukami and Eren Jaeger. Maybe some DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAY in here as well, courtesy of compass.<br>- Eric got a major upgrade from overconfident jerk to heroic sacrifice. Still served his role as a wake-up call for the protag.<br>- Reaction to the protag being a New-Type is way too much. Yes, he's got a sword AND a gun. Big deal.<br>- Why didn't anyone use their shield or devour yet?<br>- Large scale incursion with the good guys one-shotting Ogretails and Zygotes? Feels wrong.<br>- Fight against Vajra was a lot better, but the group was just kiting it and then Lindow goes for the kill solo? What?<br>- That underboob shot was extremely unnecessary.<br><br>So far, the second episode showed a bit more promise than the first. Third episode will decide whether I drop it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know why people are comparing Renka to Eren. They are nothing alike aside of the I want to kill my enemies which many characters from other series do. Renka is really chill and doesn't scream 24/7 like Eren. Plus he doesn't go full retard like Eren does most of the time.  <br> - That underboob shot was extremely unnecessary. <br>Opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>Not saying I don't like fanservice.<br>But that was just a cheap static shot with Dr. Creepypants talking into the camera barely deserving of the term "fanservice".</br></br>  <br>What the fuck even was this reply? He stated he doesnt watch shounenshit, so why did you talk about him watching Jojo? I dont get it, its not even relevant if you consider Jojo good.</br>  Why does everyone keep saying this guy is gay? It's obvious as fuck he's in love with Asuka.  <br> I think the biggest difference between Etrian Rei and Qworu is that Qworu has some semblance of a good character <br><br>Here's the sad part, "Rei" in Rebuild is a far better developed and characterized character than Kaworu. "Qworu" isn't a good character. It's a pure fanservice character who has been given an extremely positive and uplifting portrayal compared to the original series, whilst the writers fellate the characters image and the fans ego.<br><br>He's not a good character. He's a good character for escapism, denial and gay fantasies. All in the midst of a story intent on ruining every other character.<br><br>In Rei's case, not only is the character dumbed down and so much worse than the original, but they've gone out of their way to ruin any enjoyment one can get from it.<br><br>That's the difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It was your fault. <br>I didn't make the movie, I didn't tell Anno what to do with it. I'm all the way across the country living my own life.<br>I don't like Q, but I don't hate Qworu. Sure, I don't like him anywhere near as much as I love Animeworu (Everything from the design changes of generic shounen MC haircut to giving him fucking pupils to a completely different dynamic with Shinji and an even more shallow personality with less motivations), but I don't hate him. I liked his scenes with Shinji, save for the final battle scene which was just full on retarded including his death.<br>I don't think there's anything wrong with liking some scenes from a movie and yet not liking the rest of it. It's nowhere different from someone liking the OST but still hating Q.<br>I love Rei. I love Asuka. I love Misato. I love Shinji. I went through 23 episodes of Evangelion without even knowing who Kaworu was, and falling in love with these characters and all of their complexities. It is because of who I am that I chose to love Kaworu above them all, become attached to him. I still love the other characters though, and I do not condone nor approve of what happened to them in 3.0 and even 2.0 as well. <br>I don't think I should be shit on for liking Kaworu in all mediums and spinoffs and canons he is presented in, especially considering I wasn't shit on it before 3.0. <br>Even things like the friday night Kaworu threads that I looked forward to for winding down after a stressful schoolday are gone now; I feel alone in a battlefield.<br>I don't want to fight, I want to get along. I'm trying to understand your position, but I still think you're being too unfair on me.<br>See <br><br><br>I see them, thanks anon. It means a lot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br><br>Honestly, just look. You're doing it right now. No humility or even the slightest acknowledgement that Kaworu's fanservice ruined everything else.</br></br>    The wind is    Already posted page 3.
