Thank you, and I wish you all a great weekend.</br></br>  Requesting something cute with my Kiri~<br><br>Good lucks to anyones!<br><br>Anything's good, but it'd be most fitting if she was found somewhere unexpected, like in a cupboard, typically responding with "don't open it".</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Axel as a chef while wearing apron with the text: Awesome.

Usually with Shikai the sword changes in appearance but some don't. And with Bankai the sword could change again or not all all, the user could get a costume change or not, and the power is sometimes the same as the Shikai but may be different but keeping the same concept (I.E Making ice to making more and stronger ice, having a small 2HK weapon to a massive 1HK missile, or freezing opponents to controlling temperature and freezing yourself to absolute zero and being able to move.) They also get a newish name (Zangetsu - Tesna Zangetsu, Sode no Shirayuki - Hakka no Togame, Ryujin Jakka - Zanka no Tachi) but naming Mirokumaru for Bankai isn't necessary.<br><br>Examples of Shikai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=km4<wbr>R8J_CqoU</wbr>  [ ] Senna's is at 8:30<br>Examples of Bankai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4IU<wbr>khdqLeso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But anything else is welcomed. <br><br> If the drawfriend who said that he'd draw her on a Ferris wheel in the sunset and woudl deliver in a couple of months is here, has it been dropped? Or is it still in the works? Is it possible to see a wip of any kind? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128515631 <br>you need to take a step back, re evaluate your priorities and your life if free drawings on a shitty imageboard make you so mad. If drawfags don't do my request then that's cool; maybe next time eh? Not worth losing my cool over.</br>  Requesting my Wanko wearing your waifus clothing, anything else is appreciated.  <br>We worked on it during the week and it's not your specific request so feel free to rerequest.<br>Collages don't count anyway.</br></br>  <br>Now I know what I must  intend to draw  this weekend.</br>  <br> 4ft demon in a 4ft giant water balloon </br>  Good morning everyone, hope you all are well. Requesting my dear sweet Gwendoyln please, her smiling face would be enough for me but if you want something specific, I wouldn't mind seeing her sitting comfy in Alice's big red chair and reading or dusting off the Valkyrie book. <br><br>Just remember to take it easy and relax. Let's all have a good weekend.</br></br>  <br> Collages don't count anyway. <br> a collage consisting entirely of images of one character <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tooru with happy look.  I -really- want to ask for my waifu, but she's a  game character  too, how many people would explode if I did so?  <br>go ahead and do it, only autists give a shit</br>  Please report and ignore people trying to derail the thread.  <br>Screw it, thanks for the encouragement.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128515938 <br>Why not pull an Ishida and be nice? Also I'm sure enough your request is supposed to be in the general thread.</br>  <br>Look around. There are a lot of /v/ here. Though I believe this is what /v/ drawthreads were for, literally no one gives a fuck. Just request.</br>  <br>It's probably just one really fat anon who spends all his time to write all the rage postings, don't worry about him.</br>  Requesting Shion wearing glasses and frilly lingerie<br>Anything cute of her is fine <br>Thanks in advance</br></br>  <br>Reminder that this won't stop you from getting a delivery and you're an idiot if you think otherwise</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing. If you have any ideas of your own that is fine too.<br><br>Also thanks to the drawfag who colored that Aichi doodle last weekened, I didn't notice it until recently. It looks great!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516117 <br>Fuck off, cunt.</br>  mai waifu with her bangs brushed behind her headband rather than in front  <br> Gets this at the beginning of the thread <br> It's Friday <br> Can re-request <br> Meanwhile we will all bare witness to tons of waifu's not being drawn </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Ciel in a winter attire bundled up with scarf with arms stretched out asking for a hug with a soft smile.<br><br>Thanks for your time and effort should you decide to take my request!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>Because its a DRAWTHREAD</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>Obviously the intent is to make people angry. And obviously you know this because you're one of them, just trying to make it seem like you've succeeded. This is too obvious though, so no one actually cares.</br>  <br>This is the waifu thread and I think I messed up the post. I wanted to say "please don't treat her poorly".</br>  Requesting my beloved Goddess Satsuki Kiryuuin cosplaying your favorite Dragonball character, my sincere gratitude in advance.  Could someone draw Nemu for me? Anything would be fine but please don't treat her poorly.  <br>Ciel is a qt.<br>What do you think of her remake design?<br> The difference in bangs changes everything. </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>You know I find it hilarious how you preach about not derailing the threads when you shit them up yourself you hypocrite</br>  <br>As if anyone could rerequest after something like this!<br>Thank you very much, Choco, the turtleneck sweater looks really nice on her! Looks very comfortable!<br>And thank you, kuso, for drawing her three times!? They are all very lovely! Ranging from cute, to cute lewd and silly cute. I love all of them!<br>The next image, I don't seem to know who drew this, but regardless, I greatly appreciate it, she looks great with that devious expression on her face!  It does seem you forgot her wings and tail, though <br>Thank you for drawing her as well, Coupon, she looks very calm and serene, I love it!<br>I absolutely adore the outfit swap, the legs, the spear and the see-through shirt on yours, 34, it looks amazing. Thank you so much!<br>Thank you for drawing her again, Hakase! Her looking embarrassed like that with that love letter in her mouth gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling on the inside.<br>The one you drew looks very lovely too, Coati! It makes me happy to see her happy, I just wish I could read what she's saying I'll be studying korean start of next year,  I'll find out at some point  thank you very much!<br>The chibi Etna you drew looks very cute, ora, all sleepy~ thank you!<br><br>I can't thank all of you enough for drawing her for me, but I hope my words of appreciation will convey at least in some form how grateful I am.<br>Once again, thank you!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is indeed.<br><br>I'm more fond of the original, but her remake looks nice. Her original hairstyle is amazing to me and I love it, but a lot of people don't feel that way.   I just want to curl the hair that frames the sides of her face with my finger  </br></br></br>  I'd greatly appreciate somebody working on something for my waifu, Ramlethal.<br> I'm genuinely sorry for not being terribly /a/ related, but she is my waifu, and these threads are reliable! <br><br>If possible I'd like something cute, with her discovering a new food, valentines, a birthday, or swimming - just something she's experiencing for the first time (as she's not very knowledgeable about the world or its contents).<br><br>The further to the right of the reference image you get is more of the stuff I'm looking for/interested in.<br><br>Thank you for reading my request, I hope somebody is interested.<br>Good luck other people too!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting RJ please!  <br>Yeah, I do think her new design is quite nice on it's own, although it's quite different. This may just be my personal experience, but Ciel seems pretty underrated to me, since as far as Type Moon goes most people focus on Fate, then they mainly focus on Arc when it's relating to Tsukihime.</br>  <br>Go ahead and request your waifu, I am sure no one will mind and drawfriends like variety to choose from.</br>  Requesting Alisa please, either her GE1 or GE2 outfit would be fine.  Requesting Risty relaxing after a fight, preferably with armor damage http://imgur.com/a/d2I7V<br><br>Or just her in casual summer clothes or in a swimsuit.</br></br>  Good morning, waifubros and drawfriends. Hope we're all set for a nice laid back and relaxing weekend! I'm just going to list a few ideas I've got for this weekend's requesting and hope someone will be interested:<br><br>- Doremi in a cute bunny costume<br>- Doremi in a sexy bunny costume (probably best to do and older Doremi here)<br>- Doremi in her pjs, sleeping cozilly while dreaming about steak<br>- Doremi dressed like Cure Dream (http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_<wbr>mode=s_tag&amp;word=キュアドリーム) and looking like she's about to kick your ass<br><br>Anything at all would be greatly appreciated though.

Why are you asking?</br>  <br>Thank you for adding the wings!  and the tail <br>Thank you once again, anon!<br> Haha, and don't think I didn't notice the ice cream </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I just really thought it was cute and hadn't seen it before.</br>  <br>That's cute! I like your coloring. Nice work drawfriend.</br>  Requesting anything with Tiffania.  Requesting Mazaki Anzu attempting or posing (does not need to be any of the ones pictured) on an aerial hoop.<br>Outfit up to artist.<br><br>Any other works are appreciated.</br></br></br>  Requesting PoV of some kind of date with Azusa such as eating at a restaurant, walking in a park or at some kind of event/festival like Tanabata.<br><br>Or anything cute is excellent.<br>Thank you in advance!</br></br></br>  Requesting my dear Ion. Having fun under the rain would be nice, thank you!  Requesting Kochou Yoshida switching outfits with another waifu.  <br>Requesting Kukaku Shiba dressed as Frank Sinatra singing into an old 50's microphone.<br>Or anything is fine.<br>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  Also, the husbandos are done! I'm posting the ones I had left in pairs as usual. <br><br>Elias and Kagura first.</br></br>  Requesting Mimi Tasogare from Duel Masters dressed as Sheena Fujibayashi from Tales of Symphonia or Milla Maxwell from Tales of Xilia, please!<br><br>Alternatively, requesting Mimi doing something related to her job as a News Reporter, please! <br><br>Thanks if you pick this up!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Super pretty artwork! Lovely! Wonderful! Draw my waifu!</br>  Mikoshiba and Alex Almer.  Afternoon everyone, hope it's going well. <br><br>Requesting Mako as a cute and sleepy magical girl. I'll leave the rest up to the artist's imagination.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These are just colors of a huge delivery 34 did like a month ago, but thanks!<br><br>Mochizou and Handa next.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice Elias  can't say the same for the other one though. </br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please. If the artist wants something specific they can have her legs on a desk while she's sitting or have her tied up in a glass cylinder like in Batman Forever.  <br>It's the coloring that's wowing me, anon. Great great great work.</br>  Aizen and Gawain to finish.  <br>That's a lot of husbandos colored. Thank you for all the hard work! <br>I feel really happy to see them all colored too, there needs to be more love for husbandos around here.</br></br>  Requesting anything with Sailor Iron Mouse, please!  And full picture. Full size at the booru, tag your husbandos! I'll try to arrange them all in some more fun way later.<br><br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=49154<br><br>Thank you to 34 for drawing these, as well as all the deliveries every weekend and thanks to all the anons that like them!

Thank you again, and have a wonderful rest of the weekend!</br>  <br>No problem, anon  I was going to draw her anyway </br>  <br>Draw waifus as food. Like you did with Esdeath.</br>  Requesting Eureka in a dress similar to the one featured on the right.(Long, elegant design near the rim). Maybe looking off a cliff into the ocean, but that isnt needed!<br><br>Additional Refs: http://imgur.com/a/jK9yw<br><br>Thanks for your consideration.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Draw her again, if you would kindly.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519788 <br><br><br> Only new IP on the non deleted request <br>hmmmm.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waifus as food <br><br>Now it will give me nightmares.</br></br></br>   boa replies to every thanks but yours  <br><br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>It's just a chibi so rerequest if you feel like it.</br>    <br> cutehat <br><br>Now I have hope my waifu's hat would be more well received.</br></br></br>  <br> Not the Netherworld lava beach <br>Get creative, guys.</br></br>  Anything of Chihaya please, not terribly picky.  <br>That was a very confusing request<br><br><br>Never say this to me again<br><br><br>Don't worry anon, I know when I get thanks and when I don't. Still, it's not like my replies are all that much beyond "don't mention it"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Animated delivery <br> rerequest </br></br>  Requesting Chronoire please, I usually get mega cute deliveries so something more faithful to her original style or outfit would be cool, since she's kinda kickass. Like, she eats other witches for meals. But definitely including her tiny  hat  please! I don't think many people realize how tiny she is, so her getting on a stool to reach something or anything making fun of her size would be cool. Like not being tall enough for a roller coaster! As always, anything cute is fine and much appreciated, thanks!  Requesting Akame anything is fine!  <br> That was a very confusing request <br>I think what he wanted was as Esdeath version of those Dennis the Menace ice cream pops.</br></br>  <br> How're those paper waifus coming along? </br>    I get that you drawfags hate the people that complained about that huge collage, but I don't get why you can't realize that those were shitposters. Just be the bigger man and stop giving in to these shitposters. You're only making non shitposters hate you more, ultimately wrecking these threads more than they are.  <br>Pretty good, I'm going away for the weekend today but plan on delivering before then.</br>  <br>Thank you again for the chibi, you didn't had to link me tho, how misleading</br>  Requesting Tsuruya please. Perhaps as a magical girl or idol.<br><br>Anything else is fine. Take it easy!</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Oh my god, thank you so much, Kusugu, this looks amazing! She's so cute, and the swimsuit is adorable too! I absolutely love it!</br>  Requesting Fuuka wearing a Bavarian dirndl. Thanks in advance.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirnd<wbr>l</wbr></br></br>  Requesting anything cute of Honoka.<br><br>For specifics, requesting Honoka eating a bagel and wearing glasses.<br><br>Have a great weekend.</br></br></br></br>  Smile, anon. Love you're waifu with all you're heart and she will be drawn this weekend!  <br>I don't like your implications, nigger</br>  <br>I could have worded it better, but basically the "circle" shouldn't poke the bear just because they can. They're making even more people hate them (which causes more shitposting) just because they can't get over trolls that did something over a month ago. It makes them honestly look like children when they get hurt by trolls on an anonymous board.</br>  <br>I know, but that took a while to figure out<br><br><br>what</br></br></br></br>  <br>I spent the whole week reading her manga and watching her anime over and over. You better not be lying.</br>  <br><br>Not talking about you Boa.</br></br>  <br>A ditzy Boa is cute, too.</br>  <br>I don't remember people complaining about that huge collage. I just remember a lot of people being confused about whether they should request after that or not. Nobody but the mods even know who is who around here anyway though, so it's unlikely there's any sort of revenge or whatever happening for whatever trolling apparently happened.</br>  <br>The worse the shitposting gets the worse the circleposting gets the worse the shitposting gets<br><br>We may have to shut it down for a month or two at some point.</br></br></br>  <br>The "revenge" some drawfags are enacting are the things like "rerequest it's part of a collage and it's not what you asked for!". Except they're not hurting the shitposters, they're hurting everyone else. <br><br>Drawfags have an identity in these boards whereas the shitposters can be completely anonymous, so it's up to them to be the more mature ones and just leave shit alone. Although it doesn't hurt me personally, they could have easily just given Etnafag the deliveries in the stream. If they try to cause shit like that, their posts should be deleted just like the mods do to the ones complaining about circles.</br></br></br>  Requesting Oora in the typical scene where rose pedals are leading to the bed to seduce the anon.  Except she is happily asleep since she dosed off before she could   Requesting some cute Yuki please de gozaru~  lewd is okay   <br>I think that would be best. Just to let everyone cool down a bit.</br>  Requesting Taiga, please.<br>Anything would be appreciated.</br>  Requesting Len drawn in mitsudomoe style art if possible.<br><br>gelbooru.com/index.php?page=post&amp;s=<wbr>list&amp;tags=mitsudomoe+official_art<br><br>Anything cute would be fine too.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I finished that sharkbro colouring, though in the end I didn't have time and went the lazy route. Hope she gets drawn, anon!</br>  <br><br>Ah, I see.<br> <br>I don't really know enough about the circle to point any fingers or anything, but I think the basic rule of thumb should be to avoid starting any shit to the best of your knowledge and ability. Even if someone comes up to you and tries to provoke you, your best bet is just to fold and stop the wheel of hate before it even gets rolling.<br><br>I know I'm not a perfect example of that but I think it still holds up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OR here, thank you for drawing and treating her kindly.</br>  Requesting long haired Hitagi sitting under a tree, or anything that you're be motivated to draw of her.  Requesting Millia Rage please. It would be greatly appreciated.  <br>I completely agree with you Boa. That's why you're my favorite drawfag around here.</br>  <br>Thanks.<br>its pretty nice, the colours are good.<br>some edges are a bit pixely though, but thats fine.</br></br></br>  <br>See I agree with you too. I also agree with the mentality that if people cant follow the established theme it shouldn't exist. The general was getting along just fine when you were drawing waifus or other anime girls as bunnies</br>  <br>Have a nice weekend</br>  <br>Lewd! Nicely done Yokura!</br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>Holy cute and lewd!

Just curious since this seems like a popular thing people are doing recently.</br>  <br>If you're going to fuck off for the week, there's no need to announce it, much less avatarfag about it</br>  Requesting Kagura laying/sitting up in a bed, please!<br><br>As always, anything you feel like drawing,  even somewhat lewd,  would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Please and thank you!</br></br></br></br>  Everyone here is always so salty.

Thank you so much for including him, I had fun with you guys as well.<br><br> <br>I just wanted to thank you for coloring all of them; your colors are so soft and beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop please. Just ignore the "circle" deliveries.</br>  <br><br>I'm not the anon you're quoting but you guys need to take it easy.</br></br>  <br>Take what easy? I'm asking a simple question...</br>  Requesting Misao hugging a big teddy bear.<br><br>Keep it cute, no lewd and have fun, thank you.<br><br>Have a nice weekend.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Inaba please.<br><br>Anything cute or  cute/lewd  would be awesome! Thanks in advance!</br></br>  <br>To be fair the only reason people say they aren't requesting is hoping that someone will take sympathy on them and draw something.</br>  open-chest_sweater  <br>Thanks hei, she's super cute. The time you spent shading really shows!</br>  Requesting Pyrrha Alexandra in Yomi's clothes please~<br><br>Extra reference:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/484135/0d5f83<wbr>c941/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br>goddamn, yokura, that's very hot.<br>very nicely done</br></br>  <br>Great work as always.</br>  Good Day.<br>Requesting Amelia running around in the kitchen with an anxious look on her face.<br>But anything ,especially where she's pressured, is fine really.<br>Thank you in advance.</br></br></br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br>I think you may have linked the wrong person.<br><br><br><br>No problem! I enjoyed drawing it a lot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just said it because my rationale was that if people know there's one less rival this weekend, it may give them more hope.<br>But hey, it was a bad judgment call from me. Won't repeat it.<br><br> Either way, good luck </br></br></br></br>  <br>Boa draw my waifu for fuck sake.</br>  <br>ehehe~<br>Thank you so much!<br><br>You made her look really cute, as you always seem to with any character in your works.<br><br>I hope you have a good weekend, this helped make mine</br></br></br></br></br></br>  requesting Yuki refreshing her self fro the heat of summer with a fan  Not going to request my waifu this weekend, but have a good weekend and thank you drawfags!  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you!<br><br>I was a bit afraid I made them too big, glad you like it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What's the problem this time?</br>  Not going to request, but have fun and good luck!    <br>I think the anon is trying to say: "Nobody cares."<br>But good job if you are trying to shitpost the stockingfags.</br></br>  So, who else isn't requesting this week? Reply to this post if you're not requesting. <br><br>Anon reporting in.</br></br>  Requesting Tsukihi flying through the sky with phoenix wings https://i.imgur.com/H5sUROG.jpg, thanks in advance  Bunch of whiny cunts in this thread.  <br>~</br>  <br> tfw two drawfriends I got into these threads left after a few months because of the circlejerking <br><br>They were smarter than me.</br></br></br>  <br>Its just you, my friend.</br>  <br>I'm considering leaving as well and the fact that it'll just be met with "good riddance" doesn't make the choice hard.</br>  <br>why do you have to announce that you're leaving a thread <br>why does it matter if a thread accepts you or not<br>just post what you like?</br></br></br>  <br>easy for you to say futayofag.</br>  Independent of anonkyun's ongoing Pokemon requests, I'd like to request Vanilla handing a Snorunt a  jelly doughnut  while the Snorunt hands back a  onigiri   <br>There are some shitposters who want to see the threads burn and are the loudest, but there are also plenty of people who are thankful and polite. It's just that the former overshadow the latter.</br>  <br>Hope you like it.</br>  <br>Like this?</br>  <br>I bet Satsuki could beat Vegeta in a frown-off.</br>  <br> those legs </br>    How do I bait you?  <br><br>Vanilla best girl, I want to fulfill this request dammit</br></br>  <br>Write a sincere haiku about you're beloved</br>  <br>How could you imply that<br><br>All waifufags are wonderful people</br></br></br>  <br>Because people need attention</br>  <br>Thing is, some pictures take hours to finish. You put in an immense amount of energy and receive a mild thanks from the requester. Some requesters get popular because they respond enthusiastically and you know you improved their day. <br><br>I keep seeing drawfags come and go, and some pretty good ones too, I usually try to comment on such pictures but I'm only one person. These threads have almost become a private forum for a small group of people. <br><br>There is no reward for drawing here and it's more harmful to your confidence than anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better question, how do I bait you without being a massive attentionwhoring faggot?</br>  <br> implying some of it isnt false flagging <br>also the key word here is some, not all, before you get your panties jumbled in a bunch.</br></br>  <br>Drawfags thrive from it, really. They're not just sitting on their asses all day, doing nothing. Being creative is insanely draining.</br>  <br>I'd take your challenge,<br>But I swore a solemn oath<br>Not to request now.</br></br></br>  Good morning everyone<br><br>I'm requesting anything cute of Yukiho please! If you want something more specific, how about receiving flowers or a cake to celebrate 10 years of iM@S?</br></br>  <br>Ah I needed that.</br>  <br>I'd be very surprised if it wasn't all legit.</br>  <br>This is awesome.</br>  <br>Everyone from the Angel Wing is pretty great but Vanilla was my one and only.</br>  Requesting my lovely wife Yuzuko wet from being out in the rain. I would be fine with mostly anything however.<br><br>I hope you all a good weekend.</br></br>  <br>a love unspoken<br>between me and my waifu<br>i'm not requesting</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I like her as Vegeta, think it suits her well! I think anon here got a point and legs look a bit too thick in my opinion but great job overall, thank you very much!</br>  <br> Thing is, some pictures take hours to finish. <br>No, everything that isn't colored takes 2 minutes. Colored work a hour tops.<br>Didn't you know?</br></br></br>  Eat steak with bare hands<br>Masturbate with the juices<br>I love my waifu</br></br>  <br>Those were shitposters, drawfag. Stop.</br>  <br>Ahaha~</br>  <br>Better? or still big?</br>  Requesting Kuroneko in her summer dress wearing her hat with cat ears : https://imgur.com/a/D88lS#0  <br>Now this is double standards if I have ever seen any simply because it is a group you dislike, but when it is a requester obviously being a dick they didnt do anything wrong</br>  <br>Yeah, definetly looks better, thanks!</br>  <br>Her name rhymes with 'Kyou'<br>This one is not good enough<br>I'll just rerequest.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because it's shitposting, doesn't mean it wasn't meant seriously.</br>  <br><br>Wow I wasn't expecting to get anything, epecially anything this nice! Thanks you so much for drawing my boat, they are very cute!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128524598 <br>requesting melona taking a dump while on the phone</br>  Requesting a robotic version of Tsukimi please. An emphasis on her having more metallic and robotic features would be appreciated.<br><br>As always have a good weekend.</br></br>  Requesting Hisui in animal pajamas, rubbing her eyes and/or yawning.   All these deleted posts <br> Rias is the only request of the bunch deleted <br>Is it safe to say that the one getting riled up all the time is that guy?</br></br>  <br>You're right, I flipped the responses, my bad. Still applicable.</br>  Requesting fluffy Kumiko.  <br>One of them, yes. There's at least 3.</br>  <br>No Riasbro is actually a really nice guy. I don't know why mods deleted his request.</br>  I'd like to humbly request something with Rikka, anything would be met with much gratitude. If someone would like to try something specific, though, I feel that these two poses would suit her:<br><br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/206<wbr>6767<br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/649<wbr>008<br><br>Lewd (of varying degrees) is fine too. <br>Many thanks in advance, for anything that comes up.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>It's never safe to assume anything about anyone's identity here. I could copy and paste anyone's request here, then go on a shitposting spree, and then after my ban you would assume I was them?</br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>are you no longer linking the video with your requests?</br>  <br>Sounds suspiciously like ban-evading.</br>  <br>Yet people always do exactly this. Why is it suddenly not acceptable? Sounds like damage control.</br>  <br> gakkou gurashi was so sad </br>  <br>It's riasfag samefagging to lower suspicion.</br>  requesting mochi singing or anything cute thank you  <br> suddenly <br><br>Assuming anything about anyone's identity here hasn't ever been acceptable.</br></br></br>  Requesting my dear sweet Lancer in Doutanuki Masakuni's battle clothing. Any level of the clothing is fine. I'm not picky however and will accept him having summer fun in any possible way, from fishing to beach time and anything in between. Tight swimsuits preferred, but draw what you are comfortable with.<br>Lancer Refs: http://imgur.com/a/Axfod/all<br>Doutanuki Refs: http://imgur.com/a/HsPXS/all</br></br>  <br>I fucking love your style. And I'm a drawfag.</br>  <br>Your husbando is very handsome.</br>  <br>Come on, people jump on the slightest reason to dirty anyone's name. And then call it "proof"</br>  <br>Impersonating someone in order to shitpost is trivial. I know because someone had done it to me.</br>  <br> And I'm a drawfag. <br><br>This is how we know you have exceptional taste</br></br></br>  <br>I changed the format a month ago for our 10 year anniversary, and I guess I never re-included the video, why?</br>  <br>Whoa. I really love your style too. But I'm not a drawfag. It looks kind blocky, but then it somehow looks smooth at the same time. <br><br><br>Because people do things doesn't make thing acceptable.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop samefagging, Choco.</br></br>  <br> I could copy and paste anyone's request here, then go on a shitposting spree, and then after my ban you would assume I was them? <br>To care enough to get banned, you'd have to be here for quite a while. And on top of that, it'd mean you wouldn't request your waifu the week you decide to shitpost. People like to ruin others' image here just because they get a bigger chance then to get their own waifu drawn. They wouldn't do it at their own expense.</br></br>  Requesting Akaza Akari.  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Because people do things doesn't make thing acceptable. <br>I agree, Shirou, but I still find it a bit suspicious because usually nobody speaks up and suddenly we have a voice of reason here.</br></br>    <br>One could just post a reference, shitpost and then delete all the posts himself. And evading bans isn't difficult in any case.</br>  <br>Cat ears, twin tails, cute lewd, longish bangs or just have a cute waifu. Also school uniforms</br>  <br>At least give some reference you prick.</br>    archive is down, can't get my mini wall of text request   <br>And dinosaur onesies</br>  <br> One could just post a reference, shitpost and then delete all the posts himself. <br>This is an excellent point actually.</br></br>  <br>Archive works just fine, nigger.</br>  <br>That's cute.</br>  <br>woah nice</br>  <br>I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you call it the voice of reason, than are you not agreeing with what I was saying? It's no skin off my back if people moving forward decide not to deliver to someone they think is a shitposter based on the most retarded of assumptions. I honestly just don't like all the negativity. <br><br>These threads are so fucking depressing. That's why your uncharacteristic voice of reason is hardly ever here.</br></br></br>  <br>and you have good taste</br>  <br>It could do with less yelling, definitely.<br>It was kind of hostile like this about two months ago, but not to this level.</br></br>  <br>All I'm seeing is a gif of a crying madoka.</br>    <br><br>CB?</br></br>    <br>It's not Riasfag.<br>When you get banned, all your messages get wiped at the same time.<br><br>Riasfag's request and all the shitpost got deleted at different moments, so it can't be him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes? </br>  <br> than </br>  <br>requesting a waifu with cat ears, twin tails, longish bangs in a school uniform that is also a dinosaur onesie</br>  Requesting Akane eating a popsicle in front of a fan, please.   tfw you're vidya waifu is now /a/ - related because of this <br>http://nintendoeverything.com/fire-<wbr>emblem-fates-manga-announced/<br> tfw you won't have to get bitched out of /v/ any more. </br></wbr></br>  Requesting my wonderful Shiina Miyako.<br><br>Anything cute is appreciated, with a bonus 10 GOOD!! to anything that shows off her lovely smile.  Tears of happiness are good too. <br><br>Thanks in advance and have a wonderful weekend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>will it make the plot less fucking retarded</br>  <br> implying there werent FE mangas before this you could have used your bullshit excuse on. <br><br>Kirby has an anime does that mean I can request him here?</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a challenge</br>  <br>Actually, yeah. Why wouldn't you?</br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br>Thigh highs, boobs, wings, cute girls, nice OR</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Yes, as long as they appeared in a manga or anime, they should be fair game.</br>  <br>only if kirby is your waifu/husbando</br>  <br>A fellatio is always welcome for a lonely drawfag.</br>  <br>We allow 2hus so why not</br>  <br>Kirby would get many deliveries since he's in the range of our artistic abilities and moe.</br>  Requesting Ryuujou dressed and posing as Raidou  <br>I hope<br>both of the people working on it worked on the original game<br><br>I seen Tharja drawn here before, so yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would this change anything unless you were planning to request a character from Fates here?</br>  <br>sky rocket kirby to 200+ club when</br>  Requesting Alleyne bathing and relaxing in a water spring.<br>Else her fighting someone (or something) else would be cool.<br><br>If not anything's cool as long as it's not too lewd. Cutelewd is fine.</br></br></br>  <br>Time for me to ditch this in favor of the general. You got your wish drawfags.</br>  <br>Didn't you just get 2 nice things?</br>  Is Heikatsu in thread? I got a delivery for him  <br><br>oh shit I did? Time to check the old thread sorry</br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> Old thread <br>This is the only thread up right now</br></br>  <br>Requesting paper waifu collage picture.</br>  <br>Without even counting the millions of Touhou doujins, they also have multiple official manga.</br>  Alright guys, practicing with my tablet and I mainly do stuff like this right now. If you'd like something like this, go ahead and request and I'll do my best to get all of them done!  <br>Wow fuck you</br>  <br>nothing, I was just curious, as I was used to seeing that specific video every time you requested.</br>  <br>Are you gonna use something else than that yellow piss color? (no offense)</br>  <br><br><br>If you can, please!</br></br></br>  <br> already got a delivery <br>maybe next weekend</br></br>  <br>Could you please draw my Momo?<br/></br>  <br><br>I would love it.</br></br>  <br>Draw for this guy<br/></br>  Requesting my fluffy goddess trying her best to contain her fluffy hair, be it in a new hairstyle or a hat, but ultimately failing  <br><br>Why not</br></br>  <br>I want to request you someday, Yokura.</br>  <br/>  <br>I don't think he is. I also have a delivery for BB.</br>  <br><br>Shion please</br></br>  Requesting Yuria wearing a cute top and some daisy dukes/short-shorts.  <br>haha no offense taken. Yeah, I just pick the main color of the character's hair and then go with it as the color for everything else.</br>  <br>That's reassuring, good luck!</br>  Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  <br>You do know, you can easily change the color yourself in Photoshop, right?</br>  <br><br>I'll throw my bid in the hat, but don't feel obligated to do it if you don't want to. Thanks in advance if you do though.</br></br>  <br>Tch, how transparent and embarrassing to be spotted immediately. I hope I draw her for you someday</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Going in order of request, thank you for helping me practice!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your drawings are cute Ochakobro.</br>  <br>I, too am practicing right now. Hopefully this would motivate me to practice more often. Good luck!</br>  <br> Well I know you, so of course I'd know from what you posted. </br>  <br>Don't worry, I'll draw it it for you anon!<br><br>Aw, thanks so much.</br></br></br>  <br>My thanks drawfriend, can't wait to see all the cuteness.</br>  <br> Uselessly big ref <br><br>Why is this kind of shit is starting to be the norm?<br><br>It's not better, it's just a clusterfuck, I really don't like using those and generally google ref when drawing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm looking forward to it</br>  <br> and generally google ref when drawing. <br>That might cause a problem if, for instance, a character has multiple color schemes or outfits, and you go with one the waifufag doesn't like.</br></br>  <br>Many thanks drawfriend, I look forward to the delivery.</br>  <br>Do you have any tips how should we organize the pics in the ref then? I'm in the process of making a new reference and I wanna make it look right for the drawfags. Note that it's mostly anime/manga snapshots since official art of her is non existent.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but if a waifu has multiple outfits you should limit her reference to two you like or have different references.</br>  <br>I don't have any problem with megareferences. I just cut out the ones I need.</br>  <br>Speak for yourself.</br>  <br>I noticed I uploaded the wrong reference. I think something of this size is more appropriate which I usually do.</br>  <br>Natsumoe-chan kawaii</br>  <br>I hope you ask next week</br>  <br>What a drawfag needs to know:<br>-what her full body/outifit/haircut looks like<br>-what her colours are<br>-some images with different expressions are nice<br>-if there are any details or tattoos, a close up of them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, thanks. Will do that.</br>  <br>Y-you too  Natsumebro? </br>  Requesting Lila from Yozakura Quartet!  <br> _no </br>  <br>sorry I kinda forgot what you wanted while I was drawing feel free to rerequest.</br>  <br>That was pretty quick!<br>Thanks anon, you improved my day, the blushing face looks really cute. I love it!</br></br>  <br>*Midorifag</br>    <br>I ask sometimes, but I usually don't get any pictures. So I've focused on just drawing for everyone else.</br>  Requesting Rukia! Thank you.  <br>Thank you so much anon!<br>I love the way you coloured his eyes, and your style even reminds me a bit of his designer. Well done!</br></br>  anything would be fine<br><br>thanks if you consider</br></br>  <br>More than happy to fulfill your request. I love doing eyes and hair the most, thank you so much!</br>  <br>I too enjoy drawing those two the most.  I just can't draw. </br>  <br> I'm sorry you feel that way, but if you call it the voice of reason, than are you not agreeing with what I was saying? <br>I am agreeing. I definitively am. It just surprised me. If we were calling each other out on the real bullshit instead of the little things we usually shit on, these threads would be much more pleasant of an experience.</br></br>  First they came for the jews, and I said nothing, because I am not a jew<br><br>Then they came for the communists, and I said nothing, because I am not a communist<br><br>Then they came for Riasbro, and I spoke up, because he's pretty cool and he called my waifu cute</br></br></br></br>  Requesting my husbando, Snufkin. Thank you!  <br> Real bullshit <br>Please dont tell me you think Mishashit wasnt real bullshit.</br></br>  <br>I got hit for evasion when I wasn't evading shit in the from the very beginning. Get your fucking shit together, mod.<br><br>And I'm reposting my goddamn request.<br><br> Good afternoon, WWD. Requesting Rias dressed as a Lilim. Thank you very much and have a wonderful Friday. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was</br>  <br>Nice Usaka</br>  Summer is in full swing, so requesting my princess in crab bikini.  crossover/time paradox, if you will <br>http://imgur.com/a/4KQtL<br><br>Please and thank you.</br></br></br>  <br> I do not because I am not <br> I do not because I am not <br> I do because I am BUT A FRIEND OF MINE IS <br>This makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Usaka?</br>  <br>Yes, Usaka</br>  a.uguu.se/dfemhg.png<br>a.uguu.se/mfechb.png<br> Break the record, 20+ Etnas xDDD <br> Forget about the waifufags, they're just shitposting autists! <br> [slurping and jerking noises intensify] <br>Faggots will defend this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>U-usaka</br>  <br>Does that count for this weekend when they are just colors of old doodles?</br>  <br> Drawfags have an identity in these boards whereas the shitposters can be completely anonymous, so it's up to them to be the more mature ones and just leave shit alone. <br><br>This is true...<br><br>But I think it's too late to convince most of the circle the threads are worth saving or improving, and getting shitposted just makes them grin harder.<br><br>I think cancelling the threads for a couple of months might be the best option. Good luck getting that to happen, tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, if you were banned for evasion, and you're here now...</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>I'm not going to sit out 3 days to appeal because someone's an incompetent fuck-wit that can't do their volunteer work correctly.</br>  <br>I wouldn't count it as a delivery and Snufkin colour was posted a week or two ago.

The OP's visuals look better than most of the Ufotable UBW fights.    Question to mangafags, have anyone touched Shirou's penis yet?  HS when?  FUCKING FOOD PORN!  <br><br><br><br><br>This can't be legal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  sasuga shero  <br>Not Shirou's.</br>  <br>Illya touches  Ko-Gil's  dick.</br>    <br>Did Miyu's design improve?

You shitters are the biggest retards I have seen on /a/.</br>  <br>Didn't mean to insult your self-insert porn picture book.</br>  <br>I am posting in a thread.</br>  <br>Even the responses are stupid. You do know you are watching a spin off of that self insert porn picture book? And what you were praising was that self-insert having a giant sword in a loli fanservice manga?</br>  <br>you're responding to a bait<br>come on, /a/ always like this "everything better than UBW" meme</br></br>    <br>The butler behind him in the op,when they were bathing together.</br>  <br>Excitement (and desire)<br>Shock (and desire)<br>Shame (and desire)</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but there are always stupid anons that believe it in the end.</br>  <br>Hey look!

Will SL deliver on the action scenes?  <br>I hope we get more of this, personally.</br>  <br>Prisma is better than F/SN because it's honest, it knows that it's just loli fanservice and shonen powerlevels. Whereas F/SN is stuck up its own ass about Shirou's shitty ideals.</br>  <br>Because an imitation can surpass the original.</br>  <br> being this new to anime <br>https://<span>youtu.be/4UBya4-M3j0?t=14m3<wbr>9s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>You newfags!<br>Nobody checked already!<br>Quads checked!</br></br></br>  <br>Because SEIGI NO MIKATA is what Kiritsugu is embodying at the moment, and he is the greatest incarnation of that ideal. Sacrificing the few for the many, the world demands sacrifices so that humanity will be fine. A hero who ensures the man in the name of JUSTICE. This is the incarnation of justice that we've all been asking for, the mind of steel.<br><br>Without any doubt he exemplifies the concept of Seigi no Mikata in all its been shown, and is on that side in trying to sacrifice a little girl.<br><br>Shirou is not on the side of justice or humanity, he's just trying to protect his family or loved ones as a human. Even though the world or humanity would condemn him for this action, they would demand this sacrifice in the name of the many, he wants to save her.<br><br>One in the light, the other in the shadows, this was the last time they ever spoke as friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based anon</br>  <br> FSN is the most pretentious Nip thing I have ever read </br>  <br>Holy moly.</br>  <br>That's the interesting about Fate.<br>Without Shirou it would never have been liked.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is Rin doing.</br>  <br>She looks a bit b!chy</br>  <br>Yes yes, without the self-insert nobody would like it.

One Piece is still regularly occupying one of the first 2 places in the SJW rankings, the sales have been constantly great in the last 5 years (inb4 morons who have no clue about the MF hype in 2010 and backlog sales), on every big anime site the ratings of the manga are still as high as ever and One Piece is still breaking records almost on a yearly basis. And if you claim that is due because there are so many "blinded fanboys": Naruto and Bleach dropped down in everything after they went to shit while One Piece didn't. Face it, you grew out of One Piece and now you just are desperate to find other people who share your shitty opinion to make yourself feel better.

I only ask because I don't know if I've ever read a full English copy. I've always read scanlated chapters online.<br><br><br>He was way tanky early on too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, see </br>  <br>I don't get why people complain about the running part. There was enough stuff happening during that time. And the kids did not really bother me. The parts were they played a role were over fast. They were not a central part of the arc at all.</br>  <br>That looks awful and you should feel awful</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah I know.<br><br>But with him specializing in CoA and having fought in that near death state vs. the Baboons and assumedly Mihawk too for 2 years, holy fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, it is that single colour hating fag again</br>  <br>I buy the fucking books and subscribe to Jump.<br><br>Viz Anon's been uploading the WSJ stuff since about Volume 73/74.<br><br><br>I hated the running weekly but in bulk it was great for keeping up the pace and tension.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr agrees with me.<br> She never had a choice to be a pacifist, because her pacifism was forced upon her by her being too weak and scared to fight. She WANTED to fight. She really did. But she couldn’t, she ran, Robin held her back, Kyros told her not too–no one cared about how much she wanted to help protect her father, because Oda set up the story so that the only Kyros protecting her was what mattered. And yeah, it is important for parents to protect their children, and I think that’s what Oda was going for here. However, liked I talked about here, he could have done that without making Rebecca lack all agency and accomplishment for the entire arc.  <br> Rebecca was stripped of all choice, all agency, all accomplishment, and all her strength. She made made into nothing but a damsel in need of protecting and saving and nothing more. There were so many things Oda could have done to retain the positive messages he wanted to include, without completely trampling Rebecca’s agency.  <br>Now you know that many people share my opinion.</br></br></br></br>   no chapter this week <br> chapter release cancer still here <br>why?</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't over fast and yeah they were pretty central. The entire latter half was how they were in "danger" of dying and it was dragged out heavily. The poison and the candy were terrible plot points as we knew he would never ever kill off anyone but he kept trying to build up the suspense like they were actually going to die. Similar to the bird cage stalling.</br>  <br>True. He's definitely up there and will probably pull off another impressive feat at some point.</br>  <br>Hi</br>  <br>Okay</br>  <br>Because it's devolved into Arlong Park levels of fagottry lately.</br>  <br>I read the first part and now I feel like killing someone</br>   Oda presented Rebecca to us as a driven, inspiring, survivor of tragedy who was going to fight with everything she had to protect the person she loved. But then Oda cut the legs out from under her and made her completely useless, scared, unable to fight, unable to even flee successfully, and did nothing but stand on the side lines and cry and shout in the final fight against the man who killed her mother. <br> She made no choices. She had no agency. She fulfilled none of her promises. She accomplished nothing the entire arc. She was victimized and beaten at every turn and did nothing but rely on her father in the big climatic fight. The whole thing of praising her on the basis of “honoring her mother’s wish”? That praise is forced and false because Rebecca did nothing of her own free will to honor her mother in that final fight. If she had had the chance to kill Diamante and chose not to, THAT would be honoring her mother’s wishes. But being too scared and running away and crying and begging to be saved? How the heck is that her making a CHOICE about anything? </br>  Post your favorite Strawhat.  <br>Thanks for reminding me that I need to filter you</br>  <br>Everything she says is true though. What do you disagree with ?</br>  <br>this.</br>  <br><br>Truly the best SH.</br></br>  Threadly reminder  <br> No it wasn't over fast and yeah they were pretty central. <br>That was not my impression when I read it. Too bad for you that you feel that way though.</br></br>      <br>I read through the most recent chapter. I never knew that's where "Paramount" came from in Paramount War. Some of the dialogue changes were interesting.

I agree with everything she says.<br> That’s why I’m so mad about what Oda did with Rebecca. Oda could have done it all with her. He could have had her fight bravely against Diamante–overcoming her fear of him and fighting side by side with her father to protect him–and then CHOOSE not to kill him in the name of revenge in order to honor her mother’s wishes and not dirty her hands like her father wanted for her too. That would have been an incredible way to have Rebecca succeed in her goal of protecting her father while also honoring the principles she was raised with. But no. Rebecca’s “success” in not staining her hands was the result of her simply failing to be strong enough to fight to protect anyone. Oda threw Rebecca’s agency and ability into the dirt so that she could be protected by her father. </br></br>  <br><br>Best SH.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>Not him, but damn son, you need to work on your arguments.</br>  <br> rebecca doesn't want to hurt people <br> kyros doesn't want rebecca to fight <br> hurr durr WHY DIDN'T GODA MADE REBECCA DEFEAT DIAMANTE <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why have I never seen that gif before.<br><br>Absolutely hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Praise the Urouge.</br></br>  <br>Wonderful, and I'm not being ironic. <br>Someone should stick Oda to the ceiling of his own toilets and force him to watch as his wife and daughters take a shit evere morning.

To fight and win so that she could give back to him like he had always given to her. I really loved Rebecca and Kyros early on in the arc. I loved how much Kyros cared for and loved her, and I loved how much she loved him. And I loved how Rebecca was fighting against insurmountable odds in order to protect him like he protected her. Rebecca and Kyros were one of the best parts of the arc to me early on. <br><br>But what happened after that? She accomplished nothing and only cried and had to be saved. She lost all her agency and ability. She broke every promise she made and fell short on every goal she had. She was reduced to a sobbing, cowardly wreck who did nothing but run and beg to be saved<br><br><br>Oda really annoyed me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rebecca joining the SH.<br><br> there are people who unironically believe the above </br></br></br></br>    <br>East Blue was a slog.

Since the beginning of Dressrosa, if not slightly before Stephen Paul's.

He knows One Piece inside out and is exactly the guy that should be translating the series.<br><br>The problem is - he's got to keep up with the continuity that he's been left.

Are you going to leave One Piece threads?<br><br> Oda stripped away everything about Rebecca that made me love her character so much and made her into yet another damsel in distress who can’t fight and needs to be saved. Oda sacrificed Rebecca’s agency and dignity in order to give everything to her father—her father got to avenge Scarlet’s death, her father got to protect Rebecca yet again. I do love Kyros, but I utterly hate how terrible Rebecca’s treatment has been this arc. We were promised so much with her and given nothing. <br><br> I’ve got a few more things to say. First, I’d like to preemptively remind people that everything about what happened to Rebecca was a choice on Oda’s part. I’ve been told multiple times by people that it makes sense for all this to happen because Rebecca’s too weak to fight against Diamante. But Oda is the one who decided how strong Rebecca would be. He decided for her to not even have a sliver of her father’s strength and that Kyros would fight all by himself. I explained this before (here).  <br><br> Second, we have already had Rebecca’s character before. A 16 year old pacifist princess with a dead mother and pink hair whose strength is attributed to her NOT fighting. Hmm… why is that so familiar…? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, I'll just find it even more hilarious.</br></br>  <br> She broke every promise she made and fell short on every goal she had. <br>nope, there's literally not a single promise she broke nor a singel goal she didn't reach. Yeah she wanted to win the tournament and get the mera mera, but what for? Right to defeat doffy. Doffy is deafeated, Diamante is also defeat, she has her father back, so there is no need for her to be fed up about not getting the mera mera, because all the primary goals came true. There is literally nothing that suggest that she failed in anything that her character was meant to be.</br></br>  <br>They declared the fake news about Doflamingo retiring and then left the island. In the last chapter Sabo said that they have turned around and coming back to the island.</br>  <br>That's cool to know. I'll probably read the translated chapters each week when I remember to then.</br>  <br>You're living your life correctly. I don't think I'd find the power in myself to overlook or even enjoy such heresy though.</br>  <br>I gave him a strawhat.</br>  <br> who is Trafalgar Law </br>  <br> LE SANJAY IS BAD MAY MAY <br>Fuck off back to reddit.</br></br>  <br><br> You're living your life correctly <br><br>Touma pls, but yeah I just laugh as whatever happens someone will be butthurt. <br><br>And worst case scenario, it's another walking pair of tits, thanks Oda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the Reddit consensus?</br>  <br> sanji's real dream is becoming queen of the Okama's </br>  <br> nor a singel goal she didn't reach <br>By herself ?</br></br>  <br>You should read everything, not just two lines. Perhaps you will understand better.<br><br> Also, the narrative of the story doesn’t validate the idea of pacifism. Sure, Kyros defends the idea aloud on the basis of her honoring her mother’s wishes and staying beautiful… but in the actual narrative course of the story, there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br> Diamante NEEDED to be cut down. Violence was absolutely necessary in this situation, and thus the very idea of pacifism–refusing to fight regardless of the circumstances–is invalided. <br> Rebecca is only able to be praised for not fighting because her father picks up the slack. If more people on the heroes side had Rebecca’s “beautiful” pacifism, they would all be dead and the villains would win. In One Piece, pacifism is a virtue only enabled by having other people fight for them. On FIshman Island it had some merit because the arc had larger themes about not passing on hatred, but there are no themes or plot elements in Dressrosa that give actual weight to the idea of not fighting utterly monsterous people like Diamante and Doflamingo. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how Oda handles him after this arc.</br>  <br>Sabo literally said they were *coming back* to the island. So they weren't here.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> implying you are not that tumblrina advertising her own blog </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Sanji is a bad character because he acts dumb are wimmin. <br>That's just Oda's latent homosexuality unconsciously coming through in the writing.<br><br>Sanji's best moments are him being a bro. He takes care of Chopper and Usopp better than any of the other characters.</br></br></br>  <br><br> responding </br></br>  <br>We saw when they arrived to the island and they hadn't left before bird cage.<br><br>Surely they didn't go there just to deliver fliers and run errands.</br></br></br>   When this arc started out, Rebecca was set to be a major player. She was the “undefeated woman,” who was so good that no one had laid a hand on her in the Colosseum (a convenient way for Oda to design a female gladiator with no scars and no muscles and the same face and body as Nami and a dozen other women in OP). She was a serious contender for getting the Mera Mera no Mi, and made incredibly moving declarations that this time she would not need saving–that this time, she would protect Soldier-san! Then what happened? What happened after Oda created this inspiring character with a brutal struggle and an incredible drive to protect the man who raised her? <br><br><br>His post isn't underrated since I saw it written many times.<br><br><br>I am not her but what if I am?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What reason would they have to stay?</br>  <br>That tumblrina doesn't need me to advertize her blog, it's popular enough already.</br>  <br>Probably because there was a battle going on they could influence in the direction they wanted?</br>  <br> By herself ? <br>does it matter? She got everything she wanted. It wasn't her goal to slay diamante. It was her goal that he gets what he deserves. Sh edidn't want to kill doffy to say "kek I killed the king", but to save the island. And both happened.<br><br><br>Everything you post is retarded and goes against rebecca's character.<br><br> there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br>Yeah and they were defeated.<br><br> Diamante NEEDED to be cut down. Violence was absolutely necessary in this situation, and thus the very idea of pacifism–refusing to fight regardless of the circumstances–is invalided. <br>Nope both wrong. Even if diamante had to be defeated, there was no reason to force rebecaa to act out of her character and be violent.<br><br> If more people on the heroes side had Rebecca’s “beautiful” pacifism, they would all be dead and the villains would win. <br>But rebecca was the only one that was her quirk/personality/individuality, so your argument is invalid.<br><br>  but there are no themes or plot elements in Dressrosa that give actual weight to the idea of not fighting utterly monsterous people like Diamante and Doflamingo. <br>Her parents fucking wishes. It's like you didn't even read the arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I am not her but what if I am? <br>Then you should fuck off back to tumblr</br></br>  <br> and made incredibly moving declarations that this time she would not need saving–that this time, she would protect Soldier-san! <br>Oh shit I had forgotten all about that.<br>It's depressingly hilarious in retrospect. Oda really screwed up bad with this whole subplot.</br></br></br>  <br>True. As far as I'm concerned, less screen time would be a good start.<br>But I am hating the ope-ope immortality horseshit regardless.</br></br>  OTP reminder.  <br> Yeah and they were defeated. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly and didn't get the point.<br><br> Nope both wrong. Even if diamante had to be defeated, there was no reason to force rebecaa to act out of her character and be violent. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly and didn't get the point.<br><br> But rebecca was the only one that was her quirk/personality/individuality, so your argument is invalid. <br>You are interpret this sentence in the wrong way, so your argument is invalid.<br><br> Her parents fucking wishes. It's like you didn't even read the arc. <br>You didn't read what she wrote properly because you are convinced that I am the one who wrote everything. It's like you didn't even read anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> does it matter <br>It's the heart of the problem, son. See </br></br>  <br> CP0 participated in the battle <br>'Kay, now I know you're baiting.</br></br>  <br> yfw law dies against kaidou <br> "D-don't worry mugiwara, I already made you immortal when I saved you back at marineford, that's why I would die either way after three years from then" <br>I would literally fly to japan and assasinate Oda</br></br></br>   Well, first she only advanced through D-block because Hakuba took all the competition out for her, something I defended at the time. I still think that it was impressive on Rebecca’s part, because she withstood Hakuba’s attack when no one else could, however that was the highlight and only achievement she has had this entire arc. Now, let me repeat again something I’ve said in the past: <br> “The one I’m hoping for most is for Rebecca to be the one to fight Diamante. I absolutely love Rebecca’s character, but it’s frustrating how little she’s been able to accomplish this arc. All she did in the finals was hit Diamante’s shin with a blade-less sword (seriously Oda, why the hell did you have her walk into the finals with a sword with no blade?), get smacked in the head, have to get protected by Bartolomeo, and then cry while Diamante taunted her about how he killed her mother. If Rebecca doesn’t waste Diamante’s ass this arc, then that was a lot of abuse thrown at her character without anything then accomplished by her to show for it.” <br> “If Rebecca doesn’t waste Diamante’s ass this arc, then that was a lot of abuse thrown at her character without anything then accomplished by her to show for it.” <br> And look what’s happened now. Not only did Rebecca NOT waste Diamante’s ass, she cried and screamed for her father to come save her and didn’t even try to fight. <br><br>So I won't.<br><br><br>Exactly, this subplot became nonsense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it doesn't. <br><br><br>Nope I already proved everything you posted wrong you retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say they did. You asked what reason(s) they could have for staying.<br><br>They obviously didn't participate which brings me back to what I mentioned first which is what they did their time there. They didn't need to send the premier spy agency to the island where shit is about to go down just to hand out news.</br></br></br>  <br>the last we saw of them were them walking along the street past Law &amp; Co. and that's it. And Sabo made it clear that they left the island before the Bird Cage happened and are now turning back after hearing the news.</br>  <br> Same DF <br> Same introducing scene ( we 'll talk after luffy , now we don't have the time) <br> Literally the same words in the last chapter <br>Literally things the author purposefully put in to create parallelisms you dumb fuck. How can you not tell, unless you really are retarded and think Oda didnt create these similarites on purpose?<br><br> Same personality <br>Fuck off. You know this isn't true.<br><br> Both are under the order of a very strong man. <br>Right because Ace and Sabo are the only ones right?<br> Same Haircute <br>You forgot that they're also both male, and have two arms and two legs! By your logic the scar on Sabo's face alone should be a key indicator that Sabo and Ace are two completely different characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Same personality <br> Fuck off. You know this isn't true. <br>But it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd fund your trip.<br>But I think Luffy may die young after all.</br></br>  <br>I'll have to disagree on that. It matters for story consistency. But it's perfectly fine if Rebecca, storytelling quality, or both don't matter to you.</br>  <br>You didn't understood anything and didn't get point. For example, <br> Yeah and they were defeated <br>You implied that you believed that she complained about Diamante not being defeated, when she actually complained about Rebecca fighting properly.<br>In other words, you lack reading comprehension skills. You didn't get any point at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto's rankings fluctuated pretty frequently when things started to get shitty.</br>   I read all of this with nothing but a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach–not because of any dread for Rebecca’s life, but because my fears that Oda had spent this entire arc having Rebecca get abused and humiliated only for her to get saved again in the end without ever once accomplishing anything on her own came true. <br> Once again, Oda developed an incredible female character and then shoved her to the side and said, “Sorry, you don’t get to be strong enough to fight. You’re here to get saved.” This is Punk Hazard all over again–where Tashigi valiantly took a stand against Vergo and Monet and called Zoro out on his sexism and then proceeded to get torn apart and had to get saved by the same person who doesn’t even view her as a threat worth taking seriously. <br><br><br>They matter.</br></br></br></br>  Can somebody post some Dellinger?  <br> anyone who doesnt share my opinions must have shit taste <br>Oh a tripfag. Why am I not surprised.</br></br>   This is a battle manga. The ability to fight for your beliefs is incredibly important to validating characters’ beliefs and in giving them agency. But here, Rebecca didn’t even TRY to fight. She didn’t show her ability, and she didn’t even show bravery. She was just there to be as helpless and pathetic as possible so that Kyros could save her. Rebecca was possibly my favorite new character this arc, but Oda has done a damn thorough job of reducing her character to empty promises and failed potential. <br> God forbid that Kyros fight Diamante in order to avenge his wife alone. God forbid that REBECCA be the one who fights for the sake of the mother she lost, god forbid that Rebecca fight like she promised to protect her father. THEY AREN’T EVEN FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE. INSTEAD OF WORKING TOGETHER TO DEFEAT DIAMANTE, THE SECOND KYROS SHOWS UP HE TELLS HER “YOU NO LONGER NEED TO FIGHT.” No–Rebecca isn’t as important as Kyros, despite having every bit as central a character–it doesn’t mater enough for Rebecca to show any agency this arc. She’s just been there to be abused and get saved. <br> That is all Oda has done with Rebecca’s character–have Diamante and the Colosseum crowd insult her, humiliate her, beat her, make her cry, make her run in fear–all without Rebecca turning things around and showing a single scrap an accomplishment of her own. </br></br>  <br>Wow, I expected much more bullshit and headcanon but in the end this article is more an accumulation of facts.<br><br>Good read indeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>well obviously reletivly young. id say 40s</br>  <br> You implied that you believed that she complained about Diamante not being defeated, when she actually complained about Rebecca fighting properly. <br> In other words, you lack reading comprehension skills. You didn't get any point at all. <br>You are writing things that were never mentioned in anything you posted retard. Look here <br> &gt;Also, the narrative of the story doesn’t validate the idea of pacifism. Sure, Kyros defends the idea aloud on the basis of her honoring her mother’s wishes and staying beautiful… but in the actual narrative course of the story, there are enemies who NEED to be defeated. <br>Nothing suggests that Rebecca has to be the one, it suggest that there are enemys she probably has to fight as she also almost fought diamante. An dconsidering that it would have been shit writing if she had ignored her parents wishes and helpes kyros/fought alone. YOU are the one who has no reading comprehension and doesn't even read what he posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They like the One Piece animation as well along with the fillers <br>And how the fuck do you know that?</br></br>  <br><br>stop copy pasting your fucking tumblr essay in this thread</br></br>  <br> This is a battle manga. <br>that doesn't mean that everyone has to fight nor that fighting is the only way to archieve yur goals, therefore your whole argument is moot.</br></br>  PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY COPY PASTING TUMBLR POSTS AND DEFENDING THEM. WHETHER THEY HAVE MERIT OR NOT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. FUCK OFF BACK TO TUMBLR AND NEVER COME BACK. STOP REPLYING YOU FAGGOTS.  <br>ratings? reviews? The fact it's super popular over there?</br>  I hope the next arc has no women in it. I don't want more arguments.   people think sabo was actually at loguetown <br>kill yourselfs</br>  <br> nor that fighting is the only way to archieve yur goals <br>But that's exactly what it means.</br></br>  <br>yeah, because conis is fighting allday</br>  <br> You are writing things that were never mentioned in anything you posted retard. <br>You apparently didn't read the second sentence and also didn't realize that what I posted was one part of many posts. You lack reading comprehension skills.<br> Nothing suggests that Rebecca has to be the one, it suggest that there are enemys she probably has to fight as she also almost fought diamante. An dconsidering that it would have been shit writing if she had ignored her parents wishes and helpes kyros/fought alone. YOU are the one who has no reading comprehension and doesn't even read what he posts. <br>In other words, you didn't read the dozens of lines explaining everything about why Rebecca should have fought and about why it was wrong for her not to. You dismiss everything with just three "nothing suggests that", which is an invalid argument. You prove my point : you have no reading comprehension skills and doesn't read properly what other people post.</br></br></br></br>  <br> next arc Luffy will resolve things with Kaidou through diplomacy and a meeting around a table discussing politics and alliance and treaties. </br>  <br>I never saw anyone mention that anywhere but it's not that farfetched.</br>  <br>We should discuss Rebecca together, she's a very interesting character.<br><br> I’ve seen other posts too that express positivity for Rebecca, but I really think that Oda did an utterly terrible job with her. It’s not the I don’t like Rebecca–in the first half of the arc she was my favorite new character–but Oda just treated her so so so horribly. This is something I’ve written about before here, here, here, and here. In the first half of the arc I was crying over how much I loved Rebecca and Kyros’ relationship (see this post), and because they were set up so beautifully it made Oda’s ultimate treatment of Rebecca that much more disappointing.  <br><br><br>No. People can reply if they want to reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> explaining everything about why Rebecca should have fought and about why it was wrong for her not to <br> explaining <br>Nope that was retarded shit and wishful thinking with a pile of headcanon. Rebecca fighting seriously would have shitted on her whole character until then.<br><br> You prove my point : you have no reading comprehension skills and doesn't read properly what other people post. <br> I-if I write it often enough people will think that I have a point <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah damn I should have known that Rebeccafag is behind all this tumblr posting</br>  <br>You, you understand me.</br>  how many months until rebecca becomes a banned term  <br>when you stop tripfagging</br>  <br> Nope that was retarded shit and wishful thinking with a pile of headcanon. <br>In other words, you are dismissing everything she wrote with "it's retarded shit and wishful thinking".<br>Thank you for proving my point.<br><br> Kill yourself <br>The point has been explained by everything she wrote. On the other hand, you proved that you are trying to make a point without giving proper arguments.<br><br><br>You missed my second post, I implied I was this person.<br><br><br>When you stop insulting him every time he posts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JOHJ</br>  <br> giving her character some significance by fighting instead of crying for help and running away, and not shitting on the goals she set for herself at the beginning of the arc would have been shitting on her whole character <br>Oh okay then.<br><br><br>Pointless, it would just be replaced by Rbecca or something.</br></br></br></br></br>   My problem with the take that Rebecca should be lauded for “fulfilling her dream without breaking her principles” is that it makes it sound like she found a way to accomplish something while taking a more difficult route to honor her beliefs. <br> That is not the case at all, since Rebecca accomplished nothing of her own doing and TRIED to break her principles but only didn’t because she failed at every turn. She TRIED to fight Diamante. She TRIED to get the Mera Mera no Mi to KILL Doflamingo. She WANTED to protect her father like he protected her. <br> Did she do any of those things? No, because she failed at every single one. Rebecca didn’t decide not to hurt anyone. Rather, she didn’t WANT to hurt anyone because that’s what her mother taught her, but when she was afraid for Kyros’ (as the Toy Soldier) life she resolved to FIGHT and PROTECT him because protecting the one who raised her was more important to her than anything. <br> But instead of actually doing anything to help him, she failed when she tried and was only protected yet again by him. And then, after failing, everyone praised her for honoring her mother’s wishes even though she tried to go against them but was simply too incapable to do so. <br> Her honoring her parents’ wishes not to hurt people was the result of her failing everything she tried to do, not something she voluntarily accomplished herself.  <br><br><br>What do you think of that? Do you agree?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In other words, you are dismissing everything she wrote with "it's retarded shit and wishful thinking". <br>It literally is wishful thinking because she demands that Rebecca has to fight although Kyros the difference in strength between Diamante and Rebecca and Rebecca herself say otherwise. Therefore your whole blogpost is a pile of shit-tier headcanon.<br><br><br> giving her character some significance by fighting <br> I'm a marinefordbaby who wants to see everyone fighting, it doesn't matter if it makes any sense, hell why didn't Leo took on Doffy all alone to prove his point? <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus the last thread was so good, rip.  <br>Why can't there be a character like that? In reality isnt it pretty realitic for a sixteen year old girl, who is a pacifist in nature, to act the way she does? We had a fifteen year old princess who was pretty fucking stong-willed and actively put herself in danger in alabasta, why cant there be a princess who's the opposite and shows fear? There are a lot of fucking characters in one piece, whats so bad about having multidimensional characters?<br><br>And, no Kyros didnt fucking force her to have pacifist ideals. If you've forgotten already, Rebecca was the one who said she didnt want to fight when Kyros was trying to teach her how to yield a sword to defend herself. I personally dont like Rebecca's or King Riku's characters because I hate their hyper-pacifist ideals, but shit, I'm not gonna sit here and change their characters just so they'd fit the idealistic characters I WANTED them to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Shhh, don't talk to me, just because I agree with everything that tumbrina said, it doesn't mean I have to get on board with your latest attempt at trolling/shitposting.</br>  <br>rebeccafag BTFO</br>  <br>Real thread<br><br><br>Dear anon, if you encourage this cancer it will only grow worse.<br>The op won't post in the other thread because it rapes his position that Sabo's amnesia was an asspull/bad writing.<br>Don't let him keep spamming ops.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm here for this.</br>  <br>recbecca fag the autistic tumblr landwhale ruins every one piece thread she posts in</br>  <br>kill yourself you retard, don't make more threads, I don't want mods to start deleting them fucking cancer</br>  <br>Everytime Rebeccafag appears the threads go to hell because there are inconvincible retards who keep responding to her shit</br>  <br>I guess doing it before doesn't do shit.

I am sure they did something else on their time on the island</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It literally is wishful thinking because she demands that Rebecca has to fight although Kyros the difference in strength between Diamante and Rebecca and Rebecca herself say otherwise. Therefore your whole blogpost is a pile of shit-tier headcanon. <br>On top of mentioning only one of the many points she made, you are writing exactly what she contradicted. She criticized Oda for making Rebecca so weak, and she didn't write just one sentence like you did. You lack reading comprehension skills and should read properly everything she wrote.<br><br><br>This is for you<br> Oda has created a number of really amazing and fantastic women that I appreciate a great deal. I love Nami, Hancock, Vivi, and Robin, and the important and well created roles that they play in the story. However, then there are characters such as Rebecca and Tashigi, who I like a great deal but who I feel are treated very poorly in the story because they are made to be too weak to actually accomplish any of the things they try to do and instead are constantly failing and being protected by others. There are lots of things about the women in One Piece that are incredible, but there are also things that drop the ball. Whether it’s the lack of physical diversity (0 women with battle scars, 1 dark skinned woman, 1 woman with muscles), women often being mocked for being old or unattractive, women being outnumbered over 4 to 1 by men, or the lack of fighting that women get to do in the series. One Piece is far from a perfect series when it comes to it’s treatment and inclusion of women, even if we wish it was.  <br><br><br>If you agree with me then how can you say I am shitposting?<br><br><br>He isn't me.<br><br><br>What about you discuss properly instead of insulting? I am open to discussion.<br><br><br>It's because of you.<br><br><br>People can answer if they want to.<br><br><br>You got tired of reverse trolling and decided to reverse reverse troll by calling me a reversetroll.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They left the island before the Bird Cage happened.</br>  <br>out numbered 4 to 1 by men, so realistic to pirates and navy standards than?</br>  <br> it doesn't matter if making a female gladiator nicknamed the undefeated woman, who set up goals not to be saved and save the person important to her instead, fight, makes any sense <br>Well okay then.</br></br>  <br> You lack reading comprehension skills and should read properly everything she wrote. <br>And you still didn't posted anything "contradicting"<br> Kyros' wish <br> Diamante being 100 times strionger than Rebecca <br> Rebecca's personality <br>Hell there is nothing that contradicts these things. Making her fight would contradict them. Your blog post ist shit deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> undefeated woman <br> I completly ignore that she always dodged in the fights until her enemys were defeated on their own and create a headcanon-rebecca inside my mind who always slays her enemys cooler than Zoro does <br>Good for you</br></br></br>  <br><br>STOP REPLYING</br></br>  Disregard Rebeccafag, post cute pictures.  <br><br>Or fucking discuss the series like the last thread.<br><br>All the Void Century stuff, that was great.</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh diversity <br> muh stronk wimmin <br> muh muhsiodjinny <br>once again i am reminded why tumblr is such a fucking cancerous shithole</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but what if there is a legit reason Kyros had her never attack? She could easily be a weapon like Shirahoshi.</br>  <br> implying someone skilled enough to dodge isn't skilled enough to strike <br>You're retarded.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Same personality <br> Fuck off. You know this isn't true. <br><br>It is you dumbass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What void century stuff ?<br><br><br>Pffffft.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And you still didn't posted anything "contradicting" <br>So it's as I say, you lack reading comprehension skils.<br> Hell there is nothing that contradicts these things. Making her fight would contradict them. <br>You still hasn't understood any of the points she made.<br><br>By the way, thank you for replying to me even if you don't understand anything, at least you're proving that you're not an idiot ignoring people just because you don't agree with them.<br><br><br>People answer if they can.<br><br><br>What's wrong about that? Tell me why you don't like Rebecca and don't want appear to be strong.<br><br> Even if this change in tone is the case, I still feel hugely disappointed with what happened to Rebecca’s character. I can appreciate that Kyros didn’t want his daughter to fight because he knows what it is like to live with blood on your hands. Kyros did carry a massive amount of guilt for many things throughout his life and I can feel for him that not killing and not fighting is something he desires for his daughter. However, that doesn’t change that things only worked out that way because Rebecca failed everything she tried to do. She wanted to protect her father and she failed. She wanted to fight against Doflamingo and she failed. Against Diamante all she did was fail, run away, and beg to be saved, and despite her eventually getting some resolve back the story gave us no indication that she wouldn’t have just failed again if she tried to fight in the latest chapter. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>Kyros never tought her offensive techniques though, because Rebecca said herself she does not want to hurt others</br>    <br><br>Well there was discussion about the VC and Shanks and Buggy.<br><br>There was another about Mariejois being built on FI and consecutively the Tree Eve etc.<br><br>It was great, then this thread happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> filename <br> not rebecca01.jpg, rebecca96.jpg or rebecca101.jpg <br>You damn goofed, faker.</br></br></br>  <br> Not him but what if there is a legit reason Kyros had her never attack? She could easily be a weapon like Shirahoshi. <br>this headcanon is literally cringeworthy now.<br><br><br>No I implied that she does not WANT to fight you fucking retard. Making her fight on her own accord while estabilishing that she is not like that would literally destroy her character and make her a plot point. She wouldn't be a character anymore.<br><br><br> You still hasn't understood any of the points she made. <br>Nope you still proved nothing. I literally listed all the points against your theory here  and you continue with your "hurr durr you can't read"-meme instead of proving anything, therefore proving your autism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point. Oda wanted to show how fathers have to be overprotective according to his patriarchical culture. Rebecca wanted to fight properly and tried to, but Oda refused to make that happen. He even gave her a harmless sword.<br><br><br>This is for you<br> What if Rebecca HAD fought against Diamante and HAD protected her father, but upon having the chance to kill him couldn’t do it and put down her sword because she she wanted to honor her mother’s memory and didn’t want to have blood on her hands. How fantastic would that be? Kyros would be able to feel deep appreciation for the woman his daughter has grown up to become and it would be a beautiful way to honor Rebecca’s promises of helping her father and still keep the theme of keeping her hands clean of blood. But instead Oda chose to trample all over Rebecca and have her only remain clean through a series of ugly failures where she broke every promise she made and accomplished nothing. There could have been so many ways to resolve this fight while keeping the same themes and not treating Rebecca like dirt. So while I can have appreciation for the idea of Kyros wanting Rebecca not to stain her hands, I have no respect for what Oda did to Rebecca’s character in order to make that happen. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No I implied that she does not WANT to fight you fucking retard <br>But she did, see </br></br>  <br> The fact you said probably shows it hilariously ambiguous to what they were doing <br>Its not <br>jesus christ</br></br></br>  <br> He even gave her a harmless sword <br> She chooses a sword that adds well to her personality and principles <br> Oda DESTROYED HER <br>Hang yourself<br><br><br> protect =/ fight and slay every possible enemy <br>Are you 12?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, it wasn't that good, didn't bring anything new to the table/that I didn't know at least.</br>  <br>keep crying that your fanfiction did not come true, it is amusing</br>  <br>i think it's because he was positive he was safe.<br><br>what happened to post-timeskip ussop? fucking running away from the tontattas was the biggest character regression ever</br></br></br>  <br>I took this picture from the tumblr.<br>I deleted my files.<br><br><br>So it's as I say, you prove my point. For example, she explains with dozens of lines why Rebecca should have fought despite Kyros's promise, yet you keep repeating that Kyros's promise goes against your theory without realizing it's the opposite. You lack reading comprehension skills. Also, since you don't know that autists can be intelligent, it also proves that you are full of prejudice. Read everything and maybe you will understand better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cancerous <br>why?</br></br>  <br> fucking running away from the tontattas was the biggest character regression ever <br>wasn't this because he forgot about Robin?</br></br>  <br><br>It was amazingly good compared to threads like this really. <br><br>Whether it is known or not, at least they were being discussed instead of this shite.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MORE DEEP <br>lewd</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't know. He still has a bit too many 'cowardly' moments than I'd like.</br>  <br> For example, she explains with dozens of lines why Rebecca should have fought despite Kyros's promise <br> A character should act while ignoring her own personality and people she loves to make my headcanon come true <br>yeah no</br></br></br>  <br>Read everything written on http://calgaras.tumblr.com/post/116<wbr>370411817/hello-d-i-read-your-ask-a<wbr>bout-why-rebecca-isnt<br>It explains everything. I already copy/pasted what she wrote, tell me exactly what's wrong about all the points she made.<br><br><br>You claiming there is a fanfiction when there are only explanations show that you do lack reading comprehension skills. Read more carefully.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> protect =/ fight and slay  <br>I hope you're not pretending to have read more than a single manga, that being One Piece, when you can write such an inane statement. Hell, even reading One Piece alone should prevent you from writing shit like this. You're a fucking disgrace, hell, you're worse than Rebeccafag because at least this guy is only pretending to be retarded.</br></br>  <br>Read everything. Rebecca wanted to beat Doflamingo and to protect her father.

She wanted to defeat doffy when she forgot her father and wanted to JUST help the strawhats when she remembered her father.<br><br><br> a character should act in accordance with the goals he set for himself <br> FIFY. <br>Yeah she got her father back and knew that people would defeat Diamante and Doffy as Kyros and Luffy promised her. There was no reason left to fight for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice godwin's law, but no, that wasn't me.</br>  <br><br>the dwarves pretty much kidnapped him, so it wasn't after listening to their resolve and trust on him that he decided to risk his neck for them.</br></br>  People keep forgetting that Rebecca regained her memories of her father and then changed on an emotional level which is natural and understandable.  <br>Hitler wasn't edgy though</br>  <br>i think this was best explained in that he was facing two scary enemies, one had the fucking ability to turn people into toys. he was also solo, since Robin was toy'd and the tontattas were fodder.</br>  <br> Nope you simply lost the argument <br>I'd gladly say it if that stopped you from spewing bullshit like you're the next prophet but sadly that isn't the case.</br></br>  do you think Kaido is the second division commander that Ace replaced? He could have been Moria's rookie rival before joining WB.  do you think what franky said in the third panel had any effect on Sanji?  <br> I have to have the last word even if I say senseless retarded shit <br>Kill yourself, manchild.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Oda has created a number of really amazing and fantastic women that I appreciate a great deal. I love Nami, Hancock, Vivi, and Robin, and the important and well created roles that they play in the story. However, then there are characters such as Rebecca and Tashigi, who I like a great deal but who I feel are treated very poorly in the story because they are made to be too weak to actually accomplish any of the things they try to do and instead are constantly failing and being protected by others <br>And I'm saying why the fuck is this a bad thing. There are a lot of characters in one piece, like there are a lot of people in this world. Some are weak, some are strong. Some can fight for themselves and are strong-willed. Some cant, EVEN IF they're strong-willed. <br><br>You could say the same shit about male characters in OP. Oda made some fantastic male characters but also some shitty ones. Why the fuck did Oda make Zoro so badass but shit on Sanji's character? Why wasnt Law strong enough to fight his own battle? Why did Oda have to make it so that Luffy had to save him? Why are there so many typical pervy male characters in OP when there's other males that arent?<br><br>If you already acknowledge that there are strong female characters in OP then your problem is that you just dont like it when the opposite is shown to be able to exist in that world. Which seems ridiculous with the amount of characters OP has.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It could have also been crocodile. He honestly seems to be on most of their levels. Whitebeard commanders have been pretty disappointing.</br>  <br> Why wasnt Law strong enough to fight his own battle? Why did Oda have to make it so that Luffy had to save him? <br>U wot? Luffy was not strong enough to beat Doflamingo alone as well. Law would not have beaten Doffy without Luffy but the same is true the other way around.</br></br>  still_better_than_fate_threads.png  <br>the tumblr cunt won't listen to reason or logic.</br>  <br> talking and posting like a fat dyke <br><br>Those speaking patterns are too exact to be fake, a real landwhale cunt is here.</br></br></br>  <br> "Do you think she's weak?" <br> "Don't worry, she has strong guys with her" <br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br><br> 1 chapter every week </br></br>  <br>the irony is that both, chopper and brook are joke characters at this point and therefore jobber</br>  <br>Law had personal history with Doflamingo, is an extremely popular character, and has power of his own to rival Luffy.

It's like you didn't read anything.<br><br>Most people on these threads ignore me because they know they can't win against me since I am right, but they used to reply with wrong but logical arguments. However, you keep repeating things that have already been contradicted and you don't even address any of the poits. You dissmiss dozens of lines with things that have already been proven wrong. It's like talking to a parrot. Even  said that you're "a fucking disgrace" and "retarded" because he understands that you have no logic.<br><br>I already know you are the same new person as yesterday who kept misunderstanding everything, samef*gged and kept spouting buzzwords without knowing their actual meanings, but I wanted to see you if you were just tired. You are apparently like this all the time, so I am sorry for you, but it confirms that you are underage. You using buzzwords without even looking for their definitions (you even thought calling someone a reversetroll meant calling oneself a troll) is enough to prove that you aren't even willing to use proper arguments. I know you want to feel like an adult by going on a site for adults, but you don't have to try so hard. Try to improve your reading comprehension skills first on more normal sites.<br><br>I have to go outside to eat with my friends, it's my last vacation day.

This changed after she regained her memories.</br></br>  <br>Rebecca is by far better than her tbh.</br>  <br> Yes the jesus fight proved that he is as much of a child as Ace was. <br>He got mad but he was nowhere near Ace's hot-headed reaction to someone simply badmouthing Whitebeard. Whitebeard wasnt even dead at that point. <br><br>And even then, Sabo made it point to state that he's gonna move on and not cling on to his regrets. He seems way more level-headed.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know if I'll have enough free time to come back.

Oda being all pretentious about "Give a damn about Sabo! He's only the OTHER brother of Luffy who was never referenced to ever have existed on the spot after Ace was killed and had amnesia FEEL SORRY FOR HIM!!"<br><br>That makes Sabo a bag of shit for a character. Him inheriting Ace's powers also doesn't do him favors in being Ace Lite.</br></br></br>  <br>ok.</br>  <br>Even worse is people pretending he isn't some pseudo ace replacement.</br>  yfw Sabo and Shanks will die just like how Ace and Whitebeard die because Luffy's brother dies with a Yonko, always.  <br> cancerous <br>Certainly the most unneeded.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, you're almost as annoying as the Rebeccafag. If people like his character and inclusion than so be it. I'm not pretending shit, I can acknowledge he's a replacement for Ace as Luffy's brother, but fuck off if you think people need to agree with you that he's a carbon copy of Ace's character.</br>  <br>The only thing getting mad over is how Baby 5 got White Knight Faggoted by Echiro Faggot Oda. He can't stand seeing a beautiful woman seriously get crushed and brutally defeated. So he had her turn good and be a waifu (is it any different from what he did with Boa Hancock?).<br><br>Anyone else despise Oda's Traditionalist views on life that reflect in his work? It makes one wonder. Has he ever in his life SUFFERED at the hands of women? Like say get falsely accused of rape which destroys his image? Or maybe he'll get falsely accused of domestic violence. Because the man sounds like a simp or if not that too ignorant of female nature to the point he puts pussy on the pedestal.</br></br></br>  <br>See you in a few years when Sabo becomes relevant. I love how people seem to think this is the last time we're gonna see Sabo and that Oda had no reason for keeping him alive.</br>  <br>Then I am not talking about you. I don't care if you like sabo. stop being defensive. I just hate people we have in this very thread trying to convince themselves he wasn't cooked up to replace Ace.<br><br>Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, women are useless for anything but sex and being cute so who cares?</br>  <br> Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit. <br>I never felt like this is the case even once</br></br>  <br> I never felt like this is the case even once <br><br>Oh okay ^_^</br></br></br>  <br> Not wanting to fuck up or beat on his female characters <br> Suggesting he got traumatized by women so he's getting back at them. <br>Shouldnt it be the opposite?<br><br>And we have an MC that gives no fucks about punching pretty girls in the face (Vivi back in alabasta). And he explained Baby 5's obsession with men as a fucking mental defect. I'm pretty sure he doesnt think women wanting to devote their lives to men like her should be a norm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot your redpill home, please do go retrieve it.</br>  <br> ^_^ <br>when will you finally kill yourself?</br></br>  <br>No you go back to (name of generally disliked community) for (disagreeing with my opinion)</br>  <br>You know it's true.</br>  <br>I ate the ope ope ^_^</br>  <br> Diminishes Ace's death by quite a bit <br>Definitely not for me. And not for Luffy either. Just because Sabo is alive that doesnt change the fact that Ace is dead and Luffy was there to witness it.</br></br>  For someone who has never seen the movies what's the best way to watch them?<br>Just go sequentially? Are there any I should not bother watching?</br>  <br>Go watch the 4, 6, 10 and 12.</br>  <br>Anything besides Baron Omatsuri, Strong World and Z is shit and worse than any filler.</br>  <br>Even if you think it doesn't diminish it for luffy and his growth you have to admit it sucks that whenever a popular character dies, it could easily be remedied with another character to replace him.<br><br>Luffy now has an older brother with the fire fruit for the fangirls again. It would be like if Kubo killed off hitsugaya then introduced another shota with the ability to control ice and people go "what...? he definitely isn't a hitsugaya clone!!"<br><br>Cmon man<br><br>I don't know if it was Oda or the editor but I could have went without Sabo.<br><br>Or if you are going to introduce Sabo don't have him eat the mera mera.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy punching Vivi was so many years ago and such a glitch in the system that it counts for nothing. After that Oda made sure he would NEVER put Luffy in a situation where he will land a punch on a pretty twat.<br><br>But let's talk Oda. As a man he's obviously a chivalry douchebag. He sounds like the kind of man who if he got his wallet's ass raped in divorce court he would be happy and consider it a blessing that he was fleeced. Many men around Oda's age aren't exactly seeing pussy with rose tinted glasses. Yet his behavior is off for a man from his gen.</br></br></br>  <br>More like the opinion of an autistic virgin manchild who wants to fit in on /a/.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>only the 6th movie is worth watching, skip the rest.</br>  <br> t would be like if Kubo killed off hitsugaya then introduced another shota with the ability to control ice and people go "what...? he definitely isn't a hitsugaya clone!!" <br>This isnt a good comparison cause you're completely ignoring the characters' relationships. Sabo inheriting Ace's fruit is symbolic in nature. He ISNT just some random shota or guy that came in was introduced with the same power. If you cant see the difference, then I dont know what to tell you.</br></br>  <br>I don't even remember which ones I saw, but Z, Strong World, 3D2Y, and the alabasta one were pretty good. Could there be more though</br>  <br> But let's talk Oda <br>no, you seem obsessed and autistic.</br></br>  <br>The symbolism is even worse. Luffy was supposed to be losing his older brother. That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. There will be consequences. He lost his older brother.<br><br>But now everything is A-okay he now has an older brother again. One that was never mentioned before in 500 chapters.</br></br></br>  <br> That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. <br>yeah and that is why he told everyone to wait 2 years, Sabos introduction did not change shit about Luffys growth</br></br>  <br>i thought he had lost them both, which was worse. He got 1 brother back after he overcame his issues</br>  <br> That's what was supposed to be what caused him to grow up and realize he can't just run head on into the new world and everything will be okay. <br>That's what Sabaody Archipelago was for.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off tripfag, you can't even understand what's going on in a kid's book</br>  <br> He can't stand seeing a beautiful woman seriously get crushed and brutally defeated. <br><br>Literally "I am not even reading this manga!"- The post<br><br>Who is Robin? (vs Croc and Enel)<br>Who is Monet? (vs Zoro)<br>Who is Tashigi? (vs Vergo)<br>Who is Baby fucking 5 (against Franky)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Look through thread <br> An actual fucking tumblrina posting <br> Wah wah, why isn't Rebecca strong <br> Wah wah, why do you want to appreciate men, what about THE WOMEN? </br></br></br>  <br> Luffy punching Vivi was so many years ago and such a glitch in the system that it counts for nothing. <br>This is every SJW's argument. Counter-examples? Doesnt count because of reasons hur durr <br><br>We've seen Vivi, Nami, Kalifa, Ms Doublefinger, Bonney etc get fucked up pretty bad. Luffy punching Vivi wasnt the only example of violence towards women. I was just stating that Luffy, our main protagonist, gives no fucks when it comes to fighting men or women. That's his character and I've seen no change in that. It's not a glitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One that was never mentioned before in 500 chapters. <br>It's funny that people keep harping on this when the exact same thing happened for Ace and Garp.</br></br>  <br> But now everything is A-okay he now has an older brother again <br>Nice projecting tripfag</br></br>   you will never fuck Saber with your BBC <br><br>Why even live?!</br></br>  <br><br>you're thinking of old men</br></br>  What ?

Do you leave it as 'onigiri,' since the food is Japanese in a Japanese setting, and so in context the viewer can know what it is? Do you call it a 'rice ball,' since it's made of rice and it's somewhat circular, although 'onigiri' means 'grasp?' Or do you completely 'localize' it and call it a jelly-filled donut?</br></br>   jelly-filled donut <br><br>What the fuck?</br></br>  "Jelly Donut" isn't a localization, it's just bullshit.<br><br>Rice ball is what we call them in English, so either that or Onigiri if you have a weeb audience.</br></br>  Onigiri in subs, manga, or LN, rice ball in a dub.  <br> What are the 1990s? </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vWg<wbr>xH2KG4ts</wbr>  [ ]</br>  The Japanese have borrowed a plethora of English words, to the point where create English terms that aren't even used in English (or in America, anyways).<br><br>What we in America call a 'salisbury steak' in Japan is called a 'hambahgah.' If the word 'HAMBAHGAH' is spoken loudly and clearly, should the subs simply leave it as 'hamburger' or should they say "Salisbury steak?"<br><br><br>Summer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the most well-known localization of all time.</br>  <br> What we in America call a 'salisbury steak' in Japan is called a 'hambahgah.' If the word 'HAMBAHGAH' is spoken loudly and clearly, should the subs simply leave it as 'hamburger' or should they say "Salisbury steak?" <br>Salisbury steak is hambaagu. Hamburger is hambaagaa.</br></br>  <br>Pretend you're a bong and call it hamburger.</br>  <br>I prefer "Hamburg steak." Although it's a slightly different dish from Salisbury steak, it makes more sense as a translation of the Japanese word and Japs probably don't know the difference between the two anyway.</br>   a 2-3 year old Nip baby (if they still exist) <br><br>5 star post.</br></br>  <br>pretty much this, it should be as close as possible to the original name but shouldn't sound retarded when spoken, pretty much like honorifics</br>  Why is it called a rice-ball when it's clearly a rice-triangle?  <br>who the fuck doesnt know what onigiri is</br>  There are only rough equivalents for honorific suffixes: -san, -sama, -kun, -chan, etc. It may be proper for to adults to call each other Mr. X and Ms. Y (X-san, Y-san). However, -san is commonly used between students, and even in Britain kids don't call it other Mr. X and Ms. Y, just X and Y if not their first names. You can't localize two students calling each other '-san' since no such convention exists in anglophone countries.<br><br><br>Nips suck at English anyways, and subs mix the two anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>Rice ball makes sense. When I make onigiri at home and eat them at home, I call them onigiri, because the people I'm talking to know what they are. If someone randomly asks me what I'm eating after seeing me eat one, I'll call them rice balls because I don't assume they know what they are. They obviously don't if they're asking. <br><br>Likewise, you shouldn't assume your audience knows Japanese things just because they're watching Japanese anime. They obviously don't speak Japanese or they wouldn't be downloading subtitles. Onigiri would be weeb subs, a special kind of stupid that's kind of cute. <br><br>Jelly doughtnut is jut plain retarded, unless you're actually going to edit the footage to make it into a jelly doughnut.

You're just making your own arguments look more and more retarded. I hope that's the point.</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, the weeaboo "translation" doesn't translate at all, but since it's a JAPANESE food in JAPANESE cartoon usually in a JAPANESE setting, calling it "onigiri" wouldn't be out of place, and the viewer (assuming they're not retarded) can tell from context what an ONIGIRI is.</br>  <br>And 'onigiri' isn't a name/propernoun?</br>  <br>No one is arguing that you aren't a cute stupid weeb. <br><br><br>That's correct.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No one is arguing that you aren't a cute stupid weeb. <br> saying this after trying to show off your shitty japanese <br><br>Anyway it would be onigiri in restaurants, so it's stupid to change it. I've never heard anyone say "rice ball"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With such shit art, the fonts and translation must be similarly shitty.</br></br>  <br>90% of the time there's no reason to not translate it to rice ball. <br><br>In fact there's only two scenarios where I'd leave it untranslated.<br><br>1: the show is steeped in Japanese culture, so leaving cultural foods and other things with their Japanese names would be an aesthetic choice to add to the atmosphere. Doing this, you are basically opting to make the subs less accessible to EOPs for the sake of making an artistic choice.<br><br>2: it's a series I've read the source material for and I know there's a puns later on that make use of the Japanese names of food, including Onigiri. In this case, I'd probably err on keeping the Japanese names of food items to make translating the pun easier because I'm not good at localizing puns. <br><br>The important thing in translation though is to be consistent. Don't switch between terms, and don't mix and match Japanese and English terms for similar things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have very very VERY rarely seen onigiri drawn in such a way that I would be able to tell what it is just from looking. Likewise, characters very very VERY rarely talk about the onigiri itself in any sort of way other than calling it FUCKING OISHII IN MY MOUTH so there's no context to tell that it's a palm-chaped blob of rice, or that the darker thing is a piece of seaweed, or that it usually has some sort of filling.<br><br><br> showing off <br><br>Okay then. I guess not being as retarded as you are is showing off now. I don't even speak Japanese. I know a few words here and there is all. That doesn't mean I can't explain why English subtitles should contain English words.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    I tend to translate nearly everything, except for stuff like "onii-chan" because that's just too cute.  <br>  I don't even speak Japanese <br>Yes, that is clear.<br> That doesn't mean I can't explain why English subtitles should contain English words. <br>It's also clear that you don't know English. or realize how many "English" words are actually from other languages.</br></br></br></br>  <br> or realize how many "English" words are actually from other languages. <br>Please stop talking.</br></br>  <br>That's a pretty childish way to try to get out of a lost argument.</br>  <br>What do loan words have to do with this? If the word is a loan word, then you obviously wouldn't need to translate it because it's already an English word. Onigiri is not such a word. Just because you use it all the time at restaurants because you're a fucking weeb trying to show off to the sushi slave doesn't suddenly make it an English word. <br><br><br>No one lost any argument here. Not even you. No one made any. You're just being stupid and saying a bunch of stupid shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Based commie.<br><br><br>But it's true. Even simple geographical terms like "mountain river valley" aren't even native English, it's from French&gt;Latin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty selective about referential pronouns when I translate. I also tend to leave "onii-chan" in, cause like you said it's cute, but because the English equivalents sound stilted to me. <br><br>But I don't have the same isuse with translating Kaa-san and tous-an to mom and dad. With oji-san I can go either way. I think oji-san sounds better than "uncle ____" personally, but since I speak Japanese my opinion is skewed.</br></br></br>  How is this not fucking illegal? <br><br>He took a beautiful, budding tomboy and with a wave of his hand made her become a normie vanilla slut.

They wanted to bring the VA PS2 game over here, but Prince got all huffy about Gold Experience and Araki wasn't willing the change the name back then so we didn't get the game.</br></br></br></br>  Did Josuke ever use Crazy D on [Spoiler]his meaty D?[/spoiler]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=30i<wbr>QrFL7U4c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>My sides are smashed.</br></br>  <br>Reported for defiling Josuke's purity.

What's the consensus on part 5? I can understand people not liking Giorno as much as other JoJo's because he only really got good development and shows of personality early on and essentially did nothing afterwards but I feel the last third or so of the part really made up for it.<br><br>The epilogue with the marble ball is honestly one of my favorite parts of all of JoJo, I thought it was absolutely genius. What do people generally think of it?<br><br>Also, one other question which I'd like as minimalistic answer as possible as I don't know the full details yet but  I'm aware of the universe reset in part 6 but only that there is one and not any details. Does it leave a bad taste in your mouth when you read it? Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The wryyy at the end fucking lol</br>  What are the chances of a Part 4 adaption? When do you think we'll know?    <br>They'll tease with a TBC arrow on the last BD and then debut a trailer at Jump Festa in december.</br>  Oh shit, it's Alternate Dio time, isn't it?  Homosexual pastor arrived  <br>You feel really wrecked anon, but the next universe is still JoJo. Part eight is wonderful (part seven is too) and honestly part six has one of the coolest character arcs for the main JoJo. I'd start it after a break for a day or two though.</br>  <br>Oh, you misunderstand. I forgot that he can't fix himself.<br>I didn't mean anything lewd, but any guy would tap the chance to magically make his dick bigger if he could, even a decent guy like Josuke. You know that's a guy thing, and Josuke has his "dudebro" moments, too.</br></br>  <br>Gay priest<br>Queer padre<br>Fag cleric<br>Homophile preacher</br></br></br></br>  <br> ORAORAORA WRYYYYYY <br><br>Are you shitting me?</br></br></br>  <br> dudebro moments <br><br>Josuke's half-English, ya dummy. He knows it's not all about the pussy game.</br></br></br>  <br>How did he get out of his hiding spot, grabbed the corpse and got out of sight in just 9 seconds or whatever?</br>  <br> in just 9 seconds <br>It's 5.<br> How? <br>Because it's Dio. <br>Dio seconds aren't the same as Earth seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, that's another element for basically all parts: JoJo is never really a guy who goes around, even though he could.<br>That goes for lots of other characters, too.<br><br>Man, JoJo plays in a too beautiful world.</br></br></br></br>  Guys, help.<br>as far as I remember, the 'agreed' most shit part was 5, right? because 5 manages to make me drop it pretty well.</br>  <br> JoJo is never really a guy who goes around <br><br><br>I actually really liked part 5. Sure, Giorno's uninteresting, but Bruno, the rest of the crew and the fights were all spectacular.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not admitting Joseph is a black sheep of the family, but the cool kind, not the "ignore that fag" kind. </br>  <br><br> Black sheep of the family <br><br>How is he more of a black sheep than Josuke or Giorno? He's one of the most JoJo. He's even one of the few that are called JoJo and one of the few with the last name Joestar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, I think he embodies the JoJo personality more than the humble Englishman or the autistic Japanese delinquent. Him being a slut is his only bad trait.</br>  <br> one of the few with the last name Joestar <br>3 Joestars<br>2 Kujos<br>2 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If part 5 gets an anime and we get it, Golden Experiences name may not change.</br>  <br>Warner Bros. owns Prince, don't they?</br>  If you stab someone wearing an Aja'd Stone Mask with the Arrow, what happens?  <br>Yes, that's why. <br><br>Although I don't know if that means the movie division can freely use his copyright, does it?</br></br></br>  <br>Or the games, for that matter. It'd be strange to see the anime using Gold Experience and a new JoJo game using Golden Wind.</br>  <br>I don't think it counts for the games, because Bamco would still have to negotiate with WB, since WBG doesn't publish the games like they do the anime.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the Stone Mask and Arrow are basically the same thing except the Arrow is a more "complete" version as it gives a Stand.</br>  <br>It doesn't work that way. Whether they could or not, there's no way they'd prioritize Jojo over not potentially irritating such a big name artist.</br>  <br>So if the Aja'd mask turns Pillar Men into the Ultimate Lifeforms, does it turn humans into Pillar Men?</br>  <br>What happens if someone uses the Stone Mask twice?</br>  <br> the Stone Mask gives stands <br> the Arrow turns people into vampires <br><br>imagine the possibilities</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 Joestars<br>3 Kujos<br>1 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna<br>1 Kira</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy has Stand as long as he's wearing the Mask. <br> Slams Mask onto his face, activating it by breaking his nose. <br> "Come on Fine Young Cannibals!" </br></br></br>  What would MiH Requiem do?<br><br> HEAVEN ON EARTH! </br></br>  <br>He wouldn't need it.

Vanilla Ice is the user. Also, Cream isn't really a punch ghost.</br>  <br> 5 highest <br>Yeah nah</br></br>  <br> Also, Cream isn't really a punch ghost. <br>It's more of a "Fist shaped holes in the User" ghost</br></br>  <br>You're autistic, anon.</br>  <br>Oh look it's Vanilla Bait.</br>  <br>I'm not the one who replied to a retarded part ranking</br>  <br>To be honest Part 5's my least favorite. <br><br>It has an interesting start, but to me the story started falling flat after they defected from the Boss' side. It took some of Part 3's elements where they spent the rest of the time trying to reach a certain place while the Villain kept sending stands to fight them every new chapter and it just got old for me real quick. <br><br>The group was great, especially Bruno. Honestly he really held up the entire part for me. I feel like Giorno's even more of a boring protagonist than Jotaro. The villain is easily the worst one in the series. And then the whole final arc where Araki just said fuck it and started killing random members and the whole body switching bullshit, and then the ending with Giorno winning by plot convenience thanks to the Arrow. <br><br>Not to say it doesn't have its highlights, there's a ton of great moments in part 5. But it just feels like one of the weaker parts to me.<br><br>  It also got some points taken off for treating my boy Polnareff like that. All he wanted was a peaceful life.  <br><br>As to your other question, the universe reset was a weird but nice ending in Part 6. Some very slight spoilers that don't matter in the long run but   The universe at the end of Part 6, and the universe that takes place in Part 7 and 8, are different ones.  <br><br>You'll understand it more when you finish part 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Why does Araki always pair up Giorno and Jolyne in his art?  Do you think Josuke ever found out about his secret admirer?  So, most important SC question<br>  OVA Voodoo Kingdom or Anime Voodoo Kingdom?<br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bPmlT<wbr>jjwsME</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=raOO9<wbr>8pwvnc</wbr>  [ ]<br/></br></br></br> </br>  <br> tried to fuck his stand <br>Is he the representation of /a/ if we had stands?</br></br>  <br><br>I feel the complete opposite. It starts off slow but keeps gaining steam and getting more and more bananas. It's easily better than SC.</br></br>  <br>Why does he shrink?</br>  <br>Original Voodoo Kingdom is much better. If you're going to do a MAD you might as well make it original instead of a bootleg version of one that already exists.</br>    <br> Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. <br><br>That's not how the reset works.</br></br></br>  <br>The new one is shit because it doesn't have DIO saying ZA WARUDO. Fuck that.</br>  http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Part_VII<wbr>I:_JoJolion<br>Go to the Chapter section<br>Look at the Ultra Jump titles<br>Now compare them to the Volume titles<br>So much wasted potential. Never forget.</br></br></br></br></wbr>    What is his name again?  <br> eros is inevitable between Josuke and Yasuho <br><br>Is this romance eros or sex eros?</br></br></br>  <br>fat ass</br>  <br>jumpin jack flash</br>  <br>Oasis</br>  <br>All of them dying through natural means would be the same anyway. To me it honestly doesn't make a difference. At first I was devastated like you were, but I thought logically and came to the conclusion that it doesn't really mean anything or make a difference. What matters is what had happened in the past.</br>  reminder that Jolyne killed in cold blood a normal, non stand user human.  <br>You become a double vampire and/or a double ultimate lifeform.</br>  <br>I'd have killed him too shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</br>  /r/ing the "Dick is good in your mouth, but have you tried the word of God?"    <br>Gimp Gelato</br>  <br>Requim stands aren't the normal stand's ability on crack. All requim is, is whatever the user needs at that moment.<br><br>Silver Chariot Requim didn't have the ability to stab things really really fast.</br></br></br>  Is JoJo a meme manga?  <br>Danke, I had lost my image</br>  <br>No, I'd say you're a year too late to say that.</br>  <br><br>For the life of me I can't remember. Who?</br></br>  (Keep in mind I'm only like halfway through Part 5)<br><br>Why is Mista the best Part 5 character?<br><br>Also why is Mista the one that goes out and does fucking everything in part 5 (so far that I've read) but is relegated to being a background character?</br></br></br></br>  <br>her lawyer</br>  <br><br> Lawyers <br> Human <br><br>Knife-eared cunt had it coming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, she straight up strangles him and causes him to crash his car.</br></br>  <br><br>Every Passione member except Fugo carries their weight.</br></br>  <br>He can't use Crazy D on himself you twat.</br>  <br>Okay, I suspected I just wasn't far enough in and that seems to be the case</br>  <br><br>Mista is great and all, but he's one of the least helpful members. Defeated less enemies than Narancia, Giorno and Bruno and wasn't crucial to solving the mystery like Abbachio.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame he dies.</br>  <br>As I've seen so far it really feels like he's the one with the any initiative, as he goes out first, does shit, then gets fucked up because everyone else is waiting around or trying to catch up, regardless of how many people he's defeated, however I've only read about halfway so I'm sure this will change, it just really sticks out for the first half to me<br><br><br>It's a shame I don't care about spoilers</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a shame I don't care about spoilers <br>I'm bullshitting, don't worry. I can't really remember who dies, as well.</br></br>  <br><br>this is my favorite jojo meme</br></br>  <br>Narancia, Bruno and Abbachio die. Giorno, Mista and Trish are the only ones who survive, while Polnareff becomes a turtle. Fugo lives too, obviously, but you don't see him at the end.</br>  <br> Gio is so boring! He never really expresses himself! <br><br>Not saying this is you, but do people just skip the first 3 chapters where it outright says Giorno is eerily serene as fuck, and how many parallels it shoves in your face that he's basically "Dio gone good"?<br><br>Of fucking course Giorno is going to stick in the background until the very end,  that's exactly how Dio was in Part 3 god damnit anons use some critical fucking thinking </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio wasn't the main character of Part 3 and his mystery was the whole point of it.</br>  Post your favorite "Oh SHIT" moments in Jojo  <br><br>I think a lot of the problem is the bad translation as well. Apparently there's a lot of quirks in the way that each character speaks that is completely lost in the translation. Despite that Part 5 still has my favourite supporting cast. Passione Clan aint nothing to fuck with.</br></br>  <br>I never got why DIO needed to be so mysterious. We all knew who DIO was in part 1, the mystery was just his stand.</br>    <br>Congratulations, anon! You're almost realizing the the point! Just a little more thought and you'll finally understand the entire point of Giorno's character and why he wasn't at the foreground 90% of the time!<br><br><br>That too. In the Japanese text, Giorno sounds EXACTLY like Dio, and talks just as formal and polite as he does. Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell".<br><br>Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you just posted it. Jolyne getting turned inside out, the moebius heart, Pucci massacring EVERYBODY and SNAILAGEDDON are all up there. Part 6 was just one baffling moment after another. <br><br>And of course pic related and SPACE RIPPA STINGY EYES are golden.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked that mysterious. It made it feel like a completely different Dio. <br><br>Dio in part 1 was cunning and mostly an asshole, For the moments we saw Dio in Part 3 he was more mysterious and intimidating. Especially since everyone in Part 3 kept hyping him up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can someone post Weather Reports subsequent pose?</br></br>    <br>Talking about this?</br>  <br> Him being a slut is his only bad trait. <br>Trufax</br></br>  <br>Pucci casually walking down the side of sideways Kennedy Space Center in the middle of the C-Moon fight.</br>  <br>Y'know, translators should play around with fonts more to give each character their own voice. I didn't like how a translator note actually had to point out how fucking annoying Magenta Magenta was supposed to be when he could have written his lines in  Comic Sans .</br>  <br>Yeah I get that, I just kind of preferred when he was more involved in Part 1, as opposed to Part 3 where he really only had DIO's World to shine.</br>  <br><br>jojo has ruined me for other manga/anime. i'm not as satisfied with things that don't have constant posing.</br></br>  <br> Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series. <br>We already get this with Jotaro though, and Jotaro is prominent in many parts that Giorno's personality seems even more basic.</br></br>  <br>Fuck man I really wish I wasn't spoiled on this when I was reading Part 7. The World coming back would've been a legit shocking moment</br>  <br>Imagine being a Jap in 2010 or whatever and opening Ultra Jump and seeing that. I would've shat myself.</br>  <br> Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell". <br><br>I wonder why.</br></br></br>  <br>Same, but it was still pretty hype to read. Animefags will never experience this  because SBR will never ever get an anime. </br>  <br><br>I hated part 3 Dio. Trying to be mysterious when there is no mystery is frustrating and dull. We know all about this character. Putting a shadow over his face is not making us forget anything about him. Part 3 DIO spends his time doing nothing and then coming out of hiding to job to a hero who only has indirect beef with him. <br><br>Part 3 DIO is the worst fucking villain despite being the fucking best in Part 1. PB Dio is great because he actually has a lifelong connection to Jonathan and a strange brotherly love and respect despite it all. There is an actual conflict developed. He has NOTHING to play off of against Jotaro. Worst villain, worst Jojo and worst showdown. When you take away the poses and one liners there is nothing of substance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the one! Thanks man.</br></br>  <br>I can understand why you don't like him but<br><br> Part 3 DIO is the worst villain  <br>You have read Part 5...right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Diavolo <br> Worst Villain </br></br>  <br>Nah SBR will get an anime in 2025. <br><br>  And the corpse's identity will be changed to Hesus Bhrist.  </br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 DIO is a fucking disgrace. Part 1 Dio is one of the best villains of all times. DIO is just completely devoid of personality and intellect. He's generic.</br>  <br><br>Part 5 is way fucking better than part 3 because there is an ACTUAL FUCKING MYSTERY. We don't know why the Boss is or that he's even the villain. This comes at the cost of character development, but at least it had intrigue. Part 3 had neither.</br></br>  <br>The moment I realized that Pucci's stand is affecting the whole world, simply because Araki decided to outright show it instead of putting up some news report.<br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. </br></br>  <br>I don't think the name Jesus Christ is copywritten.</br>  <br><br> Why <br><br>*who*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how everything part 6 looks nothing like florida</br>  <br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. <br><br>In any other part you might've been right, but not in Snail Ocean.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think everything about the end of SO is gold. Every part after, I dunno, the green baby maybe? Or after the courtyard shit. <br><br>But especially every time we saw the rest of the world that wasn't the main cast dealing with the accelerating time. Fucking Rohan Kishibe.</br></br></br>  <br> never saw any of the other JoJos reacting to it <br>At least we got to see Rohan pissing off mangakas.</br></br>  <br>Diavolo's not a very good villain.<br>We knew from the very beginning he was the villain because of Giorno's plan to overthrow the boss.<br><br>Also <br> Why did he suddenly decide to now try to kill his daughter instead of much eariler if he's that paranoid about his identity <br> Why not send Doppio out to retrieve Trish and kill her yourself to save all the trouble. <br><br>All we know about Diavolo is he's paranoid about people finding out his identity. We don't know why, or what caused this, it just is. Even then there really couldn't be any big payoff to who The Boss was. That could only work if we had met Diavolo earlier in the story but didn't know he was The Boss. Finding out The Boss is someone we don't know isn't shocking. Just a bit interesting to see what he looks like.<br><br>Diavolo's just not a very good villain comparing him to the other Jojo villains. He has a motive but we don't exactly know why. We barely know anything about him other than Doppio and being paranoid. And he doesn't even have any memorable lines from Part 5.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After the muslims getting asshurt about the OVA having the Quran, they may not want to take any chances.</br></br>  <br>This whole time we've seen that Diavolo is insanely paranoid, and in the final battle he was given a brief moment to retreat. He could've lurked in the shadows, send more assassins, maybe throw some rocks or poison Giorno's drinks.<br>But no. Instead, we got a "muh pride" moment from fucking Diavolo of all people.<br>Enjoy your constant not-death, fucker.</br></br></br>  What was up with that teasing Giorno bullshit in Stone Ocean? They talk about how Dio's sons are gathering and Florida and then it goes <br><br>"But what about Giorno Giovanni? Perhaps he is already here...."<br><br>That got me hype thinking we were gonna get a cameo. But nope, nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't retreat because he could never get to be the mafia boss again</br>  <br><br>Does that little mention prove that Heaven's Door literally nullified MiH for Rohan?</br></br>  <br>Because then there would be four of Dio's scion and Mista would've freaked out and killed everyone.</br>  Hey doc, add this to the "jojo out of context" folder  <br>Nah, it was just a reference to the fact that Rohan is fucking insane when it comes to making his mangoes. As demonstrated in Part 4 many times.<br><br>Didn't Araki confirm somewhere that Rohan didn't even notice the universe change because of his manga or something like that? Dude loves his job/art.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody was affected by MiH apart from the people in the main cast who died.</br>  I know it's only just starting but Part 8 feels like "a lot of nothing happening" to me. It just feels like nothing in it is really solid and the fights are fairly boring.<br>Am I the only stupid fuck who thinks this? The pacing is great but the content feels really empty.</br>  <br> Four sons <br>Dio's pullout game is weak.</br></br>  <br> the fights <br> reading Part 8 for the fights <br>This isn't DBZ, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but no one cares what christians bitch about.</br>  <br>I think it's great. But I like detective things so I guess it's not for everyone. It's Gappy figuring out who he is, not villain of the week constant action bullshit. If anything Part 8 has made me dislike the other parts a bit more.</br>  <br>It's a little bit of a change from previous parts, because the plot so far seems to be less about defeating enemies and more about solving various mysteries (but especially WHO AM I)<br><br>Speaking of Jojolion, I suddenly realized that Jobin looks like one of the special spiky fruits. I don't know what to make of that fact however.</br></br></br>  <br>That would've been perfect</br>  <br>One of the best parts of JoJo for me has always been how those rascally stand users will get out of trouble using their wits and smarts.<br>It isn't about the fights but it's not just the fights, every confrontation feels boring in multiple ways. The best part of part 8 so far was the beetle battle and it would have been better if it was more detailed, it felt like an easy win.</br></br>  <br>Bring Dio back</br>  <br>I've seen better battles with beetles in a bottle.</br>  You know this show isn't have bad if you imagine that this character has autism.  <br><br>Lain?</br></br>  <br>why autism; PTSD is self-evident.</br>   have   <br>He could of fixed that. Or you can just fuck have.</br>  <br>Dude, the girl is suffering from a mental breakdown and has enclosed herself in this delusion of a normal school life as she cannot handle reality. But she seems pretty stupid but innocent stupid. The world isn't suited for people like her...it's just too sad to watch.</br>  she's just pretending to be retarded  <br>She's been pretending to be retarded since the school burned down. She genuinely lost her shit for months prior to that though.</br>  i still find it really hard to believe no one from the track team was fast enough to get away, they werent even swarmed  <br>And how exactly does that help?</br>  <br>Maybe some got away, they just, you know, ran away from school for some reason? Maybe the zombies were super athletic?</br>  <br>  Maybe the zombies were super athletic? <br>That's actually a possible zombie scenario - for a short time the infected have superhuman strength/speed that can tear their own muscles and break bones, which (also rot) makes them slow shambling type.</br></br>  You do realize she's a but confirmed for it right? Like this last episode basically showed that she was off even before the zombie outbreak.  <br> imagine <br>She was a bullied friendless weirdo who was failing her classes. The zombie apocalypse is the best thing that has ever happened to her.</br></br>  <br> imagine <br><br>Even though she does have delusions because of PTSD, she definitely has autism.</br></br></br>  <br> story talks about complicated psychological disorders <br> too stupid to look up which one it might be <br> lolololol muh autism </br></br></br>  <br> have bad </br>  <br> have bad <br>You know this thread isn't half bad if you imagine OP has autism.</br></br>  <br>Autists are disgusting and should be killed.<br>They are gross, shitty things without soul and no emotions.<br>Therefore she can't be autistic.<br>Fuck autists. Slaughter them all.</br></br></br></br>  I thought she was schizophrenic  <br>It's the endless question with anything zombie related, how could they blind-side everyone during the outbreak.<br><br>In this particular case, a single zombie making its way in a locker room full of unsuspecting students is enough to get them all.<br>There weren't that many people on the tracks, mostly zombies, so it might just be the injured runaways we see getting finished off.<br><br>Also the number 1 trope about zombie movies being that nobody knows shit about zombies, they could get bitten by the injured people they were carrying., or while trying to fight them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boy the first episode really took its time playing with the mascarade that everything's fine.<br>The manga keeps it short and sweet so we actually get a surprise, but this was drawn out to hell with the dog bullshit.<br><br>Also I don't know how I feel about Lesbian being here from day 1.<br>Did they think it'd be too boring with a group of only 4  hue  people?<br>Is this just a lazy way to not have to draw the mall segment and keep it in school as much as possible?<br><br>Still pretty nice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was so they don't introduce a new main character mid-season.<br><br>They're going to flashback to the mall thing instead. Her friend is in the OP and everything.</br></br></br>  <br>For a filthy secondary who went in knowing nothing about the series, the first ep was pretty good for me.<br>I thought it was a really boring show that I was going to drop until the last few minutes, then I was "wait what"</br></br>  <br>you're implying people didn't just manage to leave the school<br><br>also it's implied first wave zombie virus was able to spread through other means</br></br></br>  <br> Anon why don't you watch this SoL, you like cute girls doing cute things right? </br>  <br>Even if you could escape from school, you're still surrounded by zombies all around in the town/city/country. You're fucked either way. Once you take away our social organization and our infrastructure, humans are literally naked monkeys.</br>  It's been a while since I haven't been spooked by an anime, in this last episode I thought that  we would see Megu-nee getting horribly chewed up right away, so I was anticipating the scene in horror   <br>At least the dog chasing scene provided us with hints that something is not 'right', so it's actually not pointless.<br>Well, I admit that the scene is a bit dragged out, but I have no problem with it.</br></br>  <br>If the anime keeps its rythm, we should get camping next episode,  then after that they'll start dropping heavy hints about Megu-nee </br>  <br>The sheer amount of different hints is actually kind of impressive.<br><br>It's also kind of hilarious though how many of them can be dismissed as "because it's moe anime"</br></br></br>   why didn't xyz <br>It's fucking zombies. You will always have to suspend your disbelief because they were never a good concept to start with.</br>  <br>But we've seen that zombies are pretty lethargic from the get go. See when Megu-nee watches that video on her phone the undead folk are moving pretty slowly.<br><br>It is beyond me how they got rekt like that. A fucking Ayaya runs around with a shovel killing zombies, surely police or jsdf could do something about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Only "virus infected" zombies aren't a good concept. The really real undead ones are.</br>  Just read a bit of the manga<br> Holy fuck, the dog was fake too? </br>  <br>He's alive in the anime. For now.</br>  <br>No, it's real.</br>  <br>But the dog is  dead  no?</br>  <br>It's dead in the manga but not in the anime. We'll see how it goes.</br>  <br>We got camping this episode, though. Next episode will be about Kei apparently</br>  <br>Nope, he's in a flashback right after Lesbian joins the school-life club.<br> He's already bitten when they find him, so he doesn't stick around long. Megu-nee uses him to study the transformation. <br>He'll probably go down the same road.<br><br>It's hardly a spoiler since such is the fate of dogs in anything zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>School Slice of Life nowadays stands for Taking the Lives of Schoolgirls One Slice at a Time. Those tags make me prepare for the worst.</br>  <br>Really? Most dogs I've seen just fucks off off screen once shit hits the fan, and conveniently have zombies ignore animals.<br><br> At the same time I can't even remember the names of those movies, so they had to have been terrible. </br></br></br>  Why is Kurumi being scared so damn boner inducing?  <br>Perhaps they just think there's something wrong and get too close trying to help before its too late.</br>  <br>Senpai please.</br>  <br>RAAAAAAAAAAAAPE</br>  If zombies end up going where they remember/count as important, wouldn't a secret hideout be ideal?  <br>She's boner inducing either way.</br>  <br>I, for one, am happy that good fanart of her finally arrives.</br>  <br>I love this face.<br><br>The face of absolute  confusion .</br></br></br>  <br>You know, speaking of the outbreak this episode, just how long is the incubation period supposed to be? People were turning right away here, but Kurumi held out all night until Miki got back.</br>  <br>Seems to be different for different people.</br>  <br>Sensei and that one guy at the mall held out pretty long, maybe it happens based on how much blood they lost?</br>  Shovel is the best action hero.  Why is Yuki so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  Enough with the fucking GG generals  <br>Well, Megu-nee was surrounded by zombies and likely bitten more than once, same with most other people during the inital outbreak, at least I assume, considering how nobody knew what was really going on.</br>  <br>might be different for each person<br>nastier wounds might accelerate the process<br> People were turning right away here <br>you don't know about that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more cute you are the more time it takes.</br></br>  <br>So Kurumi is immune after all?</br>  <br>This is my favorite so far.<br><br><br>Quiet, Yuki is a good girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi's senpai turned within minutes.</br>  <br>I want to rape Kurumi!<br><br>And I want to be raped by her.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you take in the time it takes to get in the building and climb all the way up the stairs?</br>  So, do we know yet if Shovel has become Alice from Resident Evil?  <br>If you stick your dick into a zombie, will you become a zombie as well?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  So after reading the manga.  It's pretty clear that Kurumi's going to die. The only questions are when and where.   Too bad about the censor.  <br><br>Yeah, the guy in the mall lasted maybe half a day between the initial bite and then turning in his sleep.</br></br>  <br> Sudoku in order to prevent the others from having to kill her. </br>  <br>What about watching her get raped?<br><br>http://nijie.info/view.php?id=98357<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Then why didn't she turn immediately?</br>  <br>Not entirely. She gets the Dreaded Japanese Cold instead of turning.</br>  <br>Obviously because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm never going to understand people who think that all currently unresolved problems in a story will just continue indefinitely and never be solved.</br>  <br>It's using typical zombie tropes and ignoring biology. The infection takes about 12 hours to kill you and bring you back as a zed, but if you die during the incubation period for any reason you also immediately come back as a zombie.</br>  <br>Careful not cutting yourself with all this edge</br>  <br>Future Dead Characters.jpg</br>  <br>Senpai didn't die.</br>  <br>Why do zeds want to kill people anyway?</br>  <br>So all she needs now is some chicken soup and good night's rest?</br>  How are the Gurashis ranked in terms of popularity?  <br>Especially since it's not uncommon in a story like this that the person in the clearly most vulnerable position will actually come out fine.</br>  <br>It wasn't actually that long, Lesbian went down there as soon as she came back and didn't take very long.<br> The night was tensed because we didn't know if it worked. <br>Being apparently virus based, it's bound by physiology.<br>If it's a small wound that's immediately treated, it'll take a while to kick in, whereas it'll act much faster one someone with multiple or deep bites. Or dead with no immune system to fight.<br><br>On that note, it seems there is a period after the virus takes over where they are still alive and can recover or do stuff through sheer will,  like when Megu-nee went down to the basement. <br>It's also possibly the period where they are the most agile and dangerous.<br><br>Guys remember anime watchers are lurking so spoiler your shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he did. He died of his wounds and immediately turned. Or do you expect me to believe that the infection killed him in less than 20 mins?</br>  <br> I'm hungry but <br> I'M HUNGRY BUT </br></br>  <br>In Japan?<br>Yuki &gt;&gt; Kurumi &gt;&gt; Miki &gt; Rii &gt; Megu-nee</br></br>  <br>Given that's what the scene showed, yes.</br>  <br>Japan shit taste confirmed yet again</br>  <br>Source?<br>Didn't think so</br></br>  <br>Fucking hyped for this scene <br><br> I LOVE YOU. WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR? </br></br></br>  <br>The virus wants to spread.</br>  <br> Not using Slice off Life <br> missed opportunity </br></br>  <br>So many zombie rape doujins</br>  <br>Then why don't you find your own sources, asshole? I guarantee you'll get the same results. But of course you won't you lazy fuck.</br>  <br>He was unresponsive until he turned so he was probably dead.</br>  <br>I dun fucked up. Sorry.</br>  <br>Fanart is overwhelmingly of Yuki and Kurumi</br>  <br>my god thats worse than the zombie virus</br>    <br>There didn't seem to be too much blood loss, unless he stained half the school red while they were getting to the roof.</br>   playing video games in the middle of a zombie apocalypse <br><br>Living the dream</br></br>  <br>Where the scans at?</br>  <br>Have the uni girls eaten and/or raped them yet?</br>  Why is Mii-kun there from the start?  <br>Now this is what I've been waiting for.</br>   mfw reading about megu nee <br> mfw how kind she is <br> mfw all the predicament <br><br>i need a vodka</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only at fighting games, it seems.</br>   I should have expected a incompetent helicopter pilot, these fucks ALWAYS have to appear in anything zombie related.   <br>I dont know, i'm just following a random nip's twitter account. He usually uploads pics that we'll never see scanned.<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br>  <br>when are they gonna start killing humans</br>  <br> remote strapped to controller <br>She a badass progamer</br></br>  <br> Actually he did the right thing given his situation. </br>  <br>   I should have expected an infected helicopter pilot <br><br>There you go</br></br></br>  can someone tell me wtf that helicopter pilot was doing.  <br>Them getting all friendly with the uni girls isn't a good sign. Something's going to go down soon enough for them with those uni girls.</br>  <br>That's a default control scheme for Splatoon.</br>  <br>Someone post that picture explaining the helicopter part for blind people</br>  I'd share my hard tack with them.  <br>The implication was that he was infected and that the infection requires regular injections to keep controlled instead of just being cured with one shot</br>  <br>Crashing, evidently.</br>  <br> He lost/was losing control of his body due to the virus. </br>  <br>That Mi-kun though<br> why are all my senpais such bakas </br></br>  <br><br> He's still incompetent because he should've stayed his ass on land if he was infected. </br></br>    <br>Crashing the helicopter with no survivors.</br>  <br> With no survivors. </br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Good enough for me.<br>pls share</br></br>  <br>I bet that's exactly what the author want's you to think while nothing ever happens and they keep doing SoL antics with the occasional shit going down.</br>  <br>Someone get this cathead out of here</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br> Maybe Randall CO. was sending infected pilots out to prevent healthy pilots from getting infected, maybe he was the only pilot available and they had no choice, maybe he was trying to keep the fact he was infected secret and had to keep doing his job in the meantime <br><br>There's a ton of possible explainations if you think just a little bit</br></br></br>  <br>Does it show any indication of what they're actually playing? It'd be amazing if they were actually playing Splatoon.</br>  I don't mind fanservice at all, but that was just ridiculous. Why didn't she show up straight in her pantsu.  <br>You're a squid<br>Now you're a dead</br></br>  <br>They're called bloomers</br>  <br>Your first two explanations just end up marking multiple people as such. <br><br>And your last explanation just makes him seem even more retarded assuming he has a clear understanding as to what's going on.</br></br></br>  <br>That'd be nice, but for how long do you think they could stay at uni then? They did stay at the school for a good while, but they had to eventually move out. The uni girls and the guys, who were chasing them before, could be a good enough reason to progress the plot further and make them quickly "graduate" uni.</br>  <br>If you're fine for 2 weeks until you need another dose of serum, there's not really that much of a risk sending infected people out. There was only a problem because he relapsed then and there.</br>  <br>Aren't those bloomers<br><br><br>We don't know how the "cure" works.<br>If Shovel's foreshadowing is to be believed, we might be dealing with a Zombrex situation.<br>In that case, the pilot could have run out of doses and tried to get back home or not realize he was at his limit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worst*</br>  <br>The mangaka does play splatoon so it could be a direct reference</br>  <br>Words of wisdom.</br>  <br>The uni girls have been introduced pretty ominously, shit is going to go down one way or the other.<br>They may be cannon fodder so we can have our quota of death without hurting the core roster, or they could be planning something sinister like using the girls.</br></br>  <br> I love you why why wont you open the door <br> No this isnt what i should be doing im hungry but.. <br><br> I wonder if i'll ever see them again. <br><br>im not ready for the anime to reach this scene....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What dastardly things is she planning now</br>  <br><br><br>We aren't in the 80s, nobody would wear such short panties nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>How dare they rank Rii in anything but last place.</br>  <br>They're going to formally introduce the concept of half-zombies.</br>  <br>Why is there such a distance between Yuki/Kurumi and Miki?</br>  <br>And yet 90% of anime still have them.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Y'know, because it's an university here, there are various kinds of guys here." </br>  <br>I still dont understand why there's no copilot.<br><br>plothole?</br></br></br>  <br>Or further evidence that they're severely low on manpower.</br>  <br>Kurumi and especially Yuki were the poster girls for the anime. They had people cosplaying the two girls at events and whatnot. They've also had the most screentime and development in the anime, and in my opinion, are the most interesting characters both personality and design-wise. But yeah, Kurumi has double the amount of fanart as Miki does on Pixiv.</br>  <br>He just wanted the naked lolis all to himself.</br>  reading the manga was a mistake<br>now im depresed<br>i just want cute girls doing cute things with megu nee ;_;</br></br>  which girl is gonna score the first non zombie kill  <br> Megu-nee already did. </br>  <br>i just wish there were more chapters out</br>  <br>I was gonna say Kurumi but maybe Rii is going to do it and it'll take her over the edge from broken to shattered.</br>    <br>wouldnt mind if Yuki is first to cap a motherfucker</br>  <br> Sweat drop on his helmet </br>  Imagine if pilot-kun was fapping when that unfortunate relapse happened  <br>"What the hell did I just fap to?"</br>  <br>Holy shit it all makes sense now. The chopper went out of control because he was fapping to the thought of a naked lli paradise.</br>    <br> wouldnt mind <br>I want this to happen.</br></br>  <br> Sees clothed high school girls instead of the naked loli paradise he was promised <br> Gets so mad he crushes the message, his medicine and crashes his helicopter in a kamikaze move </br></br>  <br><br>Any girl is likely to kill someone at this point.</br></br>  <br>Turns out she picked up the gun Miki threw away and has been keeping it ever since</br>  <br>picked up the gun that mi-kun threw away<br>caps those no good delinquents</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how it would turn out now that she's not delusional. Would she break down like the time with the zombie? Maybe she can keep her feelings at bay until they get to safety before it dawns on her what she really did. And maybe she'll completely break and revert to an extreme delusional state where she smiles and waves at her friends in the club while still covered in his fresh warm blood.</br></br>  <br>We were wrong the whole time. Someone should edit that image for blind people to reflect this new profound knowledge.</br>  P O S T <br>P T H E<br>O T R A W S<br>S H A<br>T E W <br> S</br></br></br></br></br>  Kurumi please my boner  <br><br>helmet dudes kills one of the crew. Yuki becomes full edge and start maniacally laughing as she executes them</br></br>  <br>I want her to bite me with that fang.</br>  <br>After the rooftop scene establishing it as unacceptable, I doubt any of the main cast will.</br>  <br> Post pthe otraws sha tew s <br>Poor Anon has run out of serum ;_;7</br></br>  <br>they talkin bout the manga dude its obviously gonna happen soon</br>  I actually like her character but I wish she would wake up and smell the cheese already, It would be better seeing her cope with what's actually going on instead of this rainbow land she's placed herself in.  <br>She has short moments of clarity and PTSD fits, be patient.<br>They are becoming more and more frequent</br></br>    <br>I'm pretty clearly also talking about the manga given that the scene with the gun is months away in the anime, and also stop writing like a retard.</br>  <br>And all that goes out the window when one of your best friends is about to be killed.</br>  <br>That was probably just one of her bullies</br>  <br>Oi, lelouch, Fuck off</br>  <br>Fuck I can't believe I just noticed her hat fell off when she snapped out of it.</br>  <br>There are different strains of the virus. I'm guessing the outbreak at school was an airborne strain since people turned way to quickly and shut went down with minutes. People immune to the airborne virus then got turn through bites which have a different incubation period. Though if Senpai was bitten, then I'll accept that it could be different for different people.</br>  <br>does her hat always fall off when she flips her shit?</br>  <br/>  <br>Yuuri is best girl.</br>    <br>Her fucking hat is the source of delusions.</br>  <br>Someone is going to draw Rii's hair getting fucked one day.</br>    <br>I don't think I could bear to see that</br>  <br>The one time she was wearing it was in a dream.</br>  <br>I must be delusional from sleepiness because I laughed at this stupid thing for 15 seconds straight.</br>  <br>Yes please, hair fetish is a great thing.</br>  <br>tis but a ruse</br>  <br>Not enough hair fetish doujins have hair brushing scenes</br>  <br>looks like shes a mad hatter.

Given the current pace of 12 chapters a year, we'd have enough material in less than two years.</br>  <br>Man I remember the threads back then<br> NO YUKI YOU DUMB SLUT </br></br>    <br>Are those really their eyes or is it a bullshit purikura filter</br>  <br> makeup </br>  It's disturbing to see how Kurumi loves her "Senpai".<br><br>She shall never have such attachment for me who is a disgusting nerd, and far from jocks like "Senpai".<br>Actually, nobody on the earth will love me like that, being lovesick and talking about that with her sensei.<br>I can never be a "Senpai", who is loved by a cute kouhai like Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just buy a shovel and keep it in your bed.<br><br>Your imagination is all you need.</br></br></br>    <br>Make yourself the jock she'd want you to be, poor nerd. Getting in shape isn't that hard, you just need a little dedication.</br>  <br>Well she's dead/dying anyway</br>  <br>SHOVEL AYAYA IS FINE<br>SHE WON'T DIE</br></br>  <br>Maybe you can identify with her instead, who likes attractive people she'll never have?</br>  <br>10/10</br>   Doujin of Kurumi getting gang raped by zombies never <br> Zombies' cum infected Kurumi made her futa </br>      <br>I want to practice with her all night long.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Aren't they just running shorts?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Practice what?</br>  <br>Gymnastics. I'm going to make her an Olympic medalist.</br>  <br>SHOVEL JUSTICE.</br>  <br>I don't think she would be interested in that.</br>    <br>What do you mean? It's the most effective way for her to stay in shape. Plus the extra flexibility will give her better handling of the shovel.</br>  <br>It'd be useless since she's gonna go  rigid  soon.</br>  Reminder Megu let all her students be eaten right behind the door.  <br>Well that explains why only 4 people survived.</br>  <br>I bet Megu was the one who bit Senpai and turned him into a zombie too.<br><br>i'm glad she's dead.</br></br></br>  <br>She did the right thing. I still wonder who the other girl was though.</br>  <br> right thing <br>Depends, if they were all running there cornered then I say she didn't do the best choice, if they had zombies mixed in then maybe it was.</br></br>  <br> I'm just pretending to have PTSD </br>  <br> Left to Right </br>  <br>Chances are at least one of them were infected. So it's either save three girls now or be responsible for the death of a dozen people later.</br>  <br>There's a movie that has a scene like that. I think it's called contracted</br>  <br>Otaku are dumb. They don't want to be the little girl, they want to fuck the little girl.</br>  <br>As long as she isn't  frigid .</br>    <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The students were pobably getting assaulted by the zombies, opening the door may have let infected people or zombies get on the roof, leaving the Gurashis trapped.<br>Megu-nee did what she could, and that's saving those three girls and herself. If the principal wasn't a fucking selfish, incompetent idiot, then he would have started evacuating the teachers and pupils to the shelter and everything would have been fine.<br>Scratch that, even the fucking shelter was only designed for 15 people. They were all fucked from the start, Megu-nee did nothing wrong.</br></br></br>    <br>Shelter was obviously just for the staff but the principle was a pussy and went there alone it seemed. Then hung himself out of guilt.</br>  <br>Where is she putting that shovel?</br>  <br>You know these threads isn't have bad if you imagine that these OPs have autism.</br>  <br>Not you again. Are you so sad that there are not Shirobako threads at the moment?</br>  What if Yuki was a zambooble the whole time?    I think I'll pick this up, seems kind of Higurashi-like.  <br> Ruu is the only one who's real </br>  <br>It wasn't the whole time. She got bitten when she accidentally went home.<br><br>She ate all her friends because she loved them so much.</br></br></br>  <br>It really isn't, aside from the contrast cute things / horror which is hardly rare<br>You still should</br></br>  <br>They can't all be imaginary.</br>  <br>I can't look her the same since she didn't brush her teeth in the first ep. I'm convinced that I can smell her.</br>  <br>They might become "imaginary" eventually in anime-original end.</br>  <br>I knew this zombie apocalypse slice of life was missing something!</br>    <br>You forgot that the gate is already broken down.<br>Wonder what the reason for them going to the mall was in the anime? I mean, the school store still has supplies.</br></br>  <br>Rii's voice in that moment was so perfect.</br>  Post more dog.  So how the fuck do some dumb slow-ass corpses cause an apocalypse?  <br>The same way they do in every apocalypse. Somehow.</br>  <br> the school store still has supplies <br><br>Don't they only eat udon and hardtacks because they run out of everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder about that too. Also, will Megu-nee go with them? <br><br>If she doesn't, how will they cover her not driving the car without revealing she's already dead?</br></br></br>  <br>Panic, lack of medical preparation, hiding bites, and people usually grouping together in enclosed areas.</br>  <br>1) they aren't always slow<br>2) surprise effect<br>3) high density of population in japan<br>4) zombies following their pre-death travelling patterns, rather than staying in one place</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the zombies that cause it, it's the humans that react to them. They see some dead fucker in the street and panic the fuck out until they crash into a gas station. You also have the paranoid fucks that think some people are infected when they really aren't. Also, the government quarantines and cleansings will often target protagonists, so that's bad too. Overreactive government leaders are tempted to nuke the shit out of a country as well, only to find out that the disease has spread throughout the world.</br>  <br>Zombie only has to scratch you to win. You have to bash it's head in to win. <br><br>The difference in effort required gives them the edge.</br></br></br>    Can't wait til some sort of anti-hero appears and fucks the shit out of Kurumi in the most terrible way.  <br>What Raws? Arent we up to date?</br>  <br> wii u in the zombie apocalypse <br>Subtle.</br></br>  <br>New chapter today (or yesterday, whenever)</br>  Place your bets:<br>Is Mika evil?<br>I say no.</br></br>  <br>Brilliance at work.</br>  <br>That's why you run from the motherfucker and let the guys with the guns get him.</br>  <br>What if Owari no Seraph is happening in the same world as Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  Is this Kurumi's favorite video game?  <br>Which one's Mika?</br>  <br> not knowing Idolmaster <br>Out, scrub.</br></br>    <br>I'm talking about the uni girl.</br>  <br>This makes me wonder, would any of them play Rebuild given the chance?</br>  <br>The military would need time to actually deploy all over the country and take the necessary mesures, enough times for zombies to turn a few malls and train stations into undead nests.<br>That said, it's like mecha. A successful zombie apocalypse is extremely unrealistic even if you have zombies that can run, the virus would need to be extremely volatile for it to work (wich is how Gakko Gurashi's virus works actually, the virus was extremely volatile then mutated to become "bite only"). It's a genre that relies heavily on suspension of disbelief and rule of cool.</br></br>  <br>Which uni girl?</br>  Can a mangafag confirm a suspicion I'm having?  Megu-nee is dead, isn't she?   <br>No, she isn't.<br> I'M SO HUNGRY SO WHY WON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR </br></br>  <br>No.<br> ...maybe. </br></br>  <br>Last cut of the episode show where she is  as a zombie .</br>  <br>He's a /k/ guy.</br>  <br><br> fgsfds </br></br>  <br>How can you not tell which one I mean when I call her Mika?<br>You DO know who Mika is, right?</br></br>  <br><br>What are you talking about?<br>In the manga she's perfectly fine  being a zombie </br></br></br>  <br> Zombies can write? </br>  WAKE UP MEGU-NEE  Maybe I am late but I think this makes the idea of an airborne disease the only possible one. Track-and-field run a lot, sweat a lot, and breathe a lot, I exclude water transmitted because she would have noticed that.<br>She didn't get the zombie virus because she wasn't running and doing cardio increases her lung capacity and efficiency. Maybe it's all bullshit though.</br>    <br>I am looking forward to that day.</br>  <br>I don't. I even went back and reread chapter 37. No one calls anyone Mika. We haven't gotten their names yet.</br>  <br> Nope, that's actually a mistake of the anime. She was only writing in the staff room, they found her diary with the secret manual.<br>She turned just before getting to the shelter, and her will was transmitted to her zombie self, wich kept on going and is now roaming inside.</br> </br>  <br>Anon, The track team were infected first, because they have club activities next to the entrance, where zombies can wander in. <br>Nothing airborne about it.</br></br>  <br>It's a nickname, you tard.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br> Or perhaps... </br></br></br>  <br>Track team should easily outrun a zombie, so I don't think that's the reason. Plus she didn't see the cause, just the results.</br>  <br>I thought that might be the case, so I went to look in the archives, but they're down right now.</br>  Do I go with DDS or Vivid?  <br>Why would anyone run away from an injured, staggering, fellow club member? This isn't America where you can get sued for administering first aid.<br>The same reason Shovel dragged her senpai to the roof, people don't run away from someone in distress, they try to help.</br></br>  <br> Track team <br>I guess their luck ran out</br></br>  <br>Nah man, the cuts to black and the muting while keeping the shovel scrapes was the best part of the episode.</br>    <br>Fuck you, Carlos</br>  <br> Why would anyone run away from an injured, staggering, fellow club member <br>Because they are trying to eat me alive.</br></br>  <br>It becomes the touching story of a group of children helping out a autistic child survive the zombie apocalypse.</br>   all these people who haven't read the manga and don't know that Yuki is the most sanest one  <br><br>Is there anyway for all secondaries to kill themselves?</br></br>    IMO I like how Megu-nee and the dog are alive in this version as vs the manga, makes it so us mangalords have something new to look forward to  <br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134661<br>Vivid has the meme-master fnord doing "translation". Basically avoid that unless you love commie-style meme-subs.<br>Get HS or DDY.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Ignore them. They're just zombieposters.</br>  <br>In all Gakkou Gurashi threads in the past 7 days, the word "Mika" turns up only once, and the way they talked about a "punished Mika" I'm pretty sure they misspelled Miki.</br>  <br>Did they come at you with a knife and fork? Perhaps it was a pair of chopsticks?<br>How can you tell what they wanted when they can barely grunt?</br></br>  <br>The dog is dead?!</br>  <br>You're literally retarded and incapable of understanding a simple reference. Do you really not know about Idolmaster? At all?<br>The Uni girl looks like Mika from Cinderella Girls.<br>That's the joke, you fucking normalfaggot zombietard.</br></br></br>  <br>Um, anon...  I think Megu-nee's just as dead in this version as in the original. </br>  <br>In the manga Yuki finds him and they realize that he's been bit so Megu-Nee has to kill him but she can't so she just let's it run away, but then it comes back as a zombie</br>  <br>The dog looks fine to me.</br>  <br><br>Gotcha thanks.</br></br>  <br>Ah, see I don't play Idolmaster, so I didn't know about it. So you're talking about the one in the middle in that case.</br>  <br>Idolm@ster is shit, and idolfags are the worst type of cancer in the whole industry. Love live is twice as shit.</br>  <br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT <br><br>We have no confirmation yet that anyone is real besides megune and the hat girl.</br></br></br>  <br> everyone has watched my shit show ur a retarded normie hurr durr </br>  <br><br>looking quite healthy</br></br>  <br>For now.</br>    <br>Nigga, they got the dog on a lead now. The dog lives in the Anime.</br>  <br>what even is that effect?</br>  <br>Aww shit, I hope people make these kind of gifs when shit starts to get real.</br>  <br>Google deep dream or something.</br>  A  best   <br>Sorry your waifu is one of the shitty new E-tier idolmasters.<br><br>Idolmaster used to be good.</br></br></br>  <br>Do they sell leashes at the school store? What don't they sell there?</br>  <br>Satan eyes</br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit, the asspain in here.<br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2SPOOKY<br>SOMEONE HOLD ME</br></br>  <br> She is and there is hints all around. For example Yuki knows that m̶e̶g̶u̶-̶n̶e̶e̶ Sakura-sensei canìt leave the school.  </br>  I hate to sound like a filthy newfag, but I don't usually read manga.  Where is a good place to download the chapters of this?   <br>nyaa?</br>  <br> he even brought his own condom <br>Mii-kun is such a nice guy</br></br>  <br>See <br>They sell everything. Buckets, Bleach, and Baloons.</br></br>  <br>He takes responsibility and protection seriously, he's a good boyfriend to Yuki.</br>  <br>Mangaupdates and begin your hunt.</br>  <br> Yuki <br> not Kurumi </br></br>  <br>crack domdomsoft and rip them from batoto or whatever other scan site that isnt shit</br>  New chapter when?  <br>But could they outrun a track team zombie?</br>  <br>Already. It hasn't been scanned yet though.</br>  <br>Wait so there at a different school in the beginning , or does that happen later?</br>  <br>they're track shorts. Watch some sport, lots of people wear them to run in</br>  <br>That happens later.<br><br>Maybe you should avoid these threads if you're not going to read the manga first. Spoilers abound.</br></br></br>  <br>"MangaTraders"<br> Or is mentioning that too much spoonfeeding? </br></br>  <br>Thanks for the heads up, I might have spoiled a few things but nothing that seems too major of a plot twist, I might pick up the manga later because I like the idea behind the series but can't recall if I've seen something like it before.</br>  <br>Not that guy but didn't it die? I remember getting an email years ago since I had an account.</br>  <br>Yuki becomes a zombie.</br>  <br>You're a good man. Thank you.</br>  Kuso scanner    <br>Googled it, now it's .org and not .com anymore. Is that the real deal or just a fake pretending?</br>    <br>Oh right, I forgot some faggots made a clone. I'm talking about a certain other site.  Search the archive regarding MT </br>  <br>What website is this? MangaTraders looks totally different.</br>  <br> no mustache on bear <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Homu's girlfriend.</br>  <br>it's the dank super serekt manga download site</br>  Just watched the first episode of this. It was cute. I had happiness going on inside of me but the red text on the board and the grave in the garden took it away... and then there was time for it to come back. The end was pretty good and powerful but I feel like they didn't need to show zombies. A zombie apocalypse is kind of boring. It would have been better to just show that the place was trashed, and leave the rest to the imagination.  <br>Found it. Thank you.</br>  <br>off not of<br> Kill yourself </br></br>  Fuck this manga<br><br>Everything doesn't exist ;_;</br></br>  <br><br><br>Found it. Thanks. Been missing MT ever since it went down.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty obvious man, just look at her clothes.</br>  <br>She might not be real, but she's unbearably cute.</br>  <br>LOOK AT THE FUCKING RIBBON</br>  <br>Literally Bebe-tier</br>  <br>Oh you.</br>    <br>  12 chapters/year <br>wait this is monthly ? fuck</br></br>     Also if you are listening to MAD's then you'll notice the term "cat-hat' gets thrown alot around as a placeholder for the phrase in pic related   <br>  of </br>  <br> of </br>  <br>Those shovel shovels.</br>  <br>What's cat hat1?</br>  <br>I'm going to assume it's the same pic without Yuki.</br>  <br>Not really. Yuki is fixed and now Yuuri only sees Ruu, nothing else.</br>  <br><br>Where's Rii?</br></br>  <br>In the madhouse.</br>    Any of you have links to chapters 36 and 37?
