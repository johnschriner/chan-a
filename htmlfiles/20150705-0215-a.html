This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>where is this from</br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>    <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>neo-/a/ loves niwaka gaijin friendly not-anime type shit</br>  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

I don't see why this isn't stickied in /co/ but in /a/.</br>  <br>Fucking Oli</br>  Thank you, based Trigger, for saving anime once again.  <br><br> devil "the boner snake" dante <br> abdullah al-moushari </br></br></br>  how much did the russian state orchestra donate to the kickstarter?    <br> for saving anime <br>You mean cartoons.</br></br>  <br> ban evading <br>You need to leave.</br></br>  Which witch would you tie up naked and throw tomatoes at?  <br><br>I just realized yesterday it's a portmanteau of egg-friend</br></br>  <br> Jesus Gomez </br>    <br> implying <br>If this is considered anime, then so is whatever the french, koreans, and chinese make as well.</br></br>  <br> Kyonko <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop </br>  <br>It's a common spic name. They pronounce it "hey-soos."</br>   Harry Potter reference for your new anime <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br> dem short shorts <br> not fanservice <br>Sure thing, normie, I'm going to fap.</br></br></br>  <br>actually not that unusual , a lot of Hispanics name their kids Jesus for one reason or another.</br>  <br>Footjob, sumata, leg lock</br>  New torrent plx  <br>No, just confirmed for gaijin pandering.</br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Trigger, you can't back your own show</br></br>  <br> gg fansubs </br>  <br>huke too?</br>  Did anyone upload it to mega?  <br>This is my first reply to this cancerous thread and I'm ban evading.<br>If this is anime then why you faggots don't let me have a √îban star racers thread in /a/. This is the same shit. take your cancer back to /co/.</br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Did Don Francisco appear in the credits?<br><br><br> koreans, chinese <br>They only do outsource work.<br> the french <br>It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Devil "The Boner Snake" Dante <br><br>holy fuck, I don't know why I laughed so hard.</br></br></br>  Hopefully i like to think the some ~4000 people who backed it enough to get a copy of the film simply wanted a way to watch it more outside the time frame of it online. Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  The fuck is this girly moe shit? I heard it was made by Trigger so I excpected something awesome and manly like KLK. Fucking false advertising moe bullshit.  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar. Safe to say they love each other very much.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Best girl. I'd fund LWA3 if we got more of her in it.  <br>Is that Shigeru Miyamoto with a wig?</br>  Based. Fucking. Trigger.<br><br>That sakuga everywhere. Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.   The sequel was just as good as the first one <br>based trigger</br>  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's one of those magical times where /a/ actually agreed on something</br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

It's not even western enough. It's more of a mix of both.<br>We like Japanese anime and manga, but we aren't all wapanese here, you know.</br></br>  I'm actually a bit upset now because Mandy was so great and now we'll never see more of her.  <br>People not liking LWA2 is a strong overreaction that is always mandatory when a large amount of people are hyped over something.<br><br>They will whine and whine about it because they can't stand people being happy.<br><br>This has happened with every show that generated large amounts of hype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets make TWELVE kickstarters! Lets do it!</br></br>  <br>I cannot comprehend people not liking it</br>   For the second time a "big bad" gets BTFO by Shiny Chariot move <br><br>How was Shiny Chariot not OP as fuck? No one seems to respect her, but she had the most OP as fuck wand, constantly took on huge "ancient" bullshit.<br><br>The power levels in this anime make no fucking sense.</br></br></br></br>   you try to fuck a slavshit <br> she farts and kills your boner </br>  <br>Yes anon. You should be able to buy it.</br>  <br>Because they didn't backed up the kickstarter</br>  <br>SUCY Best magical Egyptian dancer.</br>  <br>But that is Atleir.<br><br>Did you think the potions and food and bombs you make in Atleir can't be used in combat?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the Mahou community excommunicated her and pulled a pic-related.<br><br>Didn't work out as well as it hoped, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She put on flashy shows for Muggles which was frowned upon by the witching community. Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>akko becomes the new shiny chariot that's it</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana always</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality. It would break everyones budget.</br></br></br>  The wallpaper makes a lot more sense now.  http://i.imgur.com/XfS1BQH.jpg  <br>You can.<br>But that would probably take 5-10 years to finish.</br></br>  <br><br>Just use JDownloader.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

So where's the website where I can jerk over my name if I backed just 20 american euros?  <br>These designs are extremely anime-like; you won't find a western cartoon that looks like this unless it's directly influenced by anime. It's not "westaboo" it's just traditional anime aesthetics executed well.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure. Now Akko sounds like Hime to me rather than Hime sounding like Akko.<br><br>I guess that's what happens when a show runs for an entire year VS. a single OVA</br></br>  <br> so he at least knows that he's not white <br>Animators only do line art, you know?</br></br>  Team Sushio  <br>This works because it's short and there was large pause between 1 and 2.<br>If this ends up normal 12+ anime series you'll get your usual load of QUALITY, cliches, filler and inane shit.</br></br>  <br>Do we need more though?

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  When is Trigger going to be considered part of /co/?<br><br>When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/?<br><br>You can't really watch the latest LWA and think it's animu, can you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple. We need some other rules.  :^) </br>  <br>I'm no doctor but you might have legit autism Anon</br>  <br>Do you really not see that you just answered your own question?</br>  They sure put up a fun show.  <br>A lot of TTGL's episodes made /a/ go nuts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're not getting it. Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

It still had enough of a Japanese vibe to stay distinct, the sex humor alone set it apart. It's not a very good show, but it's anime.<br><br>LWA is in line with early 90s Disney movies, and loses all of the Japanese vibe in an obvious attempt to appeal to American children. It's not up to scratch with the material it's ripping off, and it's a cartoon.</br></br></br>  <br>Got to give the hets some bait since we all know witches reproduces hermaphroditic-ally.</br>  That was even better than the first one.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic. Dude's a big Tezuka fan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know you're desperately trying to defend your children's cartoon, but man, you're reaching.</br>  Plots for LWA3?<br> Amanda steals something unexpectedly dangerous </br>  <br> loses all of the Japanese vibe in an obvious attempt to appeal to American children <br>Yeah it's definitely American children who are backing anime projects on Kickstarter.<br><br> ripping off <br>If you liked LWA you would have said it's a homage to something, or inspired by something.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it. Either that or you're a shill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me /a/, LWA e-mail is apparently spam.</br>  <br>Tattun and at least Wakabayashi went to Pixar for multiple days before the con.<br><br>They almost certainly are doing something for them.</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop will never get a 1080p BD release with smooth 60FPS animation </br>   <br> I cannot refute this claim because I know nothing about what LWA originates from! <br>Thanks for continuously showing how little you know about anime.

It's easy to spot stuff that's ripping off 90s Glen Keane-core Disney (John K calls it "Cal Arts style") and LWA is not even fucking close.<br><br>It's not like they even attempted and failed, the two styles are worlds apart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> LWA The Chalice of Flames <br>Akko is mistakenly entered into an inter-school witches tournament and must battle other witches to the death.</br></br>  <br>that fucking kamina smile</br>  <br>Busterbeam stop.

My name is in the bottom few lines and I donated 2k.</br>  Clothes with this badge on Trigger's website when?  <br>I mean a self-employed shill who, instead of outright telling people that anime is shit (as people did in the past), tries to spread disinformation and fear, uncertainty and doubt. While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about? LWA2 had an upskirt butt shot with NO panies. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;7570485 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just puffy clothes.</br>  <br>Did you forget about me?</br>  claimed  <br>Brad Bird will save western hand-drawn animation, I hope.</br>  I never watched the first one and I think KLK is mediocre.<br><br>Should I try it just for the lolis?</br></br>  <br> and "furry" is not a sexual orientation. </br>  <br>Westaboos<br><br><br>Probably</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can watch cute girls do cute things for hours. Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2? Really, was there a single moment where you even considered the possibility of more than one outcome to a scene?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Looks like a dirty mongoloid or eskimo.</br>  <br>watch the first one then watch the second</br>  <br>fuck I meant to link <br><br>TRIGGER SURE HATE SEXUALIZING YOUNG GIRLS</br></br></br>  <br>What did LWA to upset you anon</br>   <br> watching a sequel without watching the prequel </br>  <br>Yeah, that black void sure is arousing.</br>  <br>There's no difference between Kiki and LWA girls, stop talking bullshit.<br>I sexualize whatever the fuck I want and there's nothing you can do about it.<br><br>For pantyshot to not be present in an anime with cute witches doing cute witches things is a disgrace.</br></br></br></br>    <br> &gt;watching a sequel without watching the prequel <br>I was of course asking about both.</br></br>  i like Trigger and these OVAs quite a bit but this thread is gone bananas...why this much hype ?  <br>Looks like an old man. Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it. The manga ran in a seinen magazine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty slow for a sticky if you ask me.</br>  <br> I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one. <br>You don't seem to get my point. When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy. It's like watching something you've already seen, and know all the lines to. How is that fun for you?</br></br></br></br>  Gao!  Dinosaurs doesn't sound like that.    Misuzu love is alive and well!!<br><br> ;_; </br></br>  Best key girl    I'm still salty Key wasted like 7 episodes on the other girls.    <br><br>Me too. Misuzu arc was definitely the best one.<br>Although, they had a VN to adapt...and I'm guessing that Tohno and Kirishima fans to exist...somewhere</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still salty because of the movie. I was so hyped for it and they even licensed out the TV show in order to make PR for the upcomong movie and it ended up being rushed garbagecant.</br>    <br>I agree, the movie was pretty bad.<br>I liked Misuzu's alternative character design, though.</br></br>      <br><br><br>I liked the movie.</br></br></br>  <br>It was watch-able (by Toei standards, at least). But besides how rushed it was, it also had way too much lens flare, just like the Clannad movie.</br>  Misuzu a cute.    I'm the sort never cries to anything, sometimes I get pretty teary but thats as far as it goes. To this day, AIR is the only thing that's ever actually made me bawl like a baby, and I just don't even like thinking about the story because it makes me depressed. Was the anime much happier or something? I don't really get why anyone would want to think about it.  <br><br>Yukito never really "wins" in the anime. Its actually kinda sad compared to Clannad.</br></br>  <br>Yukito actually destroys everything by being turned into a crow and never to be able have kids or pupils anymore to task them of carrying out the mission to save Kanna.<br><br>The millenia-old mission died with the stupid MC.<br><br>This is what crushed me the most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, the anime adapted Misuzu's route as it is...so, no happy endings for Misuzu.<br>I remember when I read the VN for the first time. It didn't hit me at first, but that night I cried my sleep.<br><br><br>I heard that Key took on a lot of feedback from the playerbase that Air was too sad. So they gave Clannad a happier ending. Or so I heard.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>He saved Kanna though. To break the curse, you have to make sure Kanna/Misuzu experiences love or happiness and he does that. Those 2 kids are hinted to be Misuzu and Yukito.</br></br>    <br>The curse was only particially lifted, IIRC, as Kanna only experienced a small bit of happiness. She will still be reborn into children that will die early, but at least these children wont be forever alone anymore for the few years they have on earth. And this is the end-stage of that mission, since noone will be there anymore to carry on the task of lifting the curse completely, since the MC turned into a crow.<br><br>It is implied that the children in the end will also have merely a short life, but at least they will be together.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel the complete opposite. I mean, I know Misuzu is the main girl, but come on, we barely got to see the other girls at all. Air needed to be two-cour.</br>  <br><br>I wish Air got a remake, like Kanon did.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, that sounds retarded. How does Yukito not have cousins who also who the mission? Likewise you would think Kanna would be a folk tale.</br></br>  I'm not sure if I should watch the anime again or read the VN again. <br><br><br>No, it was great the way it is. If it had benn 2 cour it would have been drawn out since there isn't really much to the other girls in the VN either, at least from what I remember.</br></br></br>  she is fucking ded LOL XD  <br>The funny thing is that, in the Air anime, I was kind of hoping for something similar to Kanon. In Kanon, Ayu was clearly the main girl from the start, but the other girls (particularly Nayuki) still got decent screentime. In Air, you barely get to care about the girls other than Misuzu.</br>  <br><br>There was barely anytime to know Misuzu.</br></br>  <br><br>There wasn't, but still, it didn't feel right.<br><br>That being said, it was Tatsuya's first project, and adapting a VN into a linear storyline must've been very challenging.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The series could have needed a few extra episodes. Not necessarily two-cour, but the Air anime felt too short.</br>  <br>Probably something like that but still as someone who read the VN I'm satisfied with the anime. Since the ending is what makes it great, at least for me, it was nicely executed in the anime.<br><br>Also is there a different torrent on nyaa, I only have the uguu one.</br></br></br>      Why is she so perfect?      Moonknives is an amazing artist. His art has a very cosy, warm feel.<br><br>He also likes Key and Cardcaptor Sakura, which is nice...</br></br>   it's summer <br> it's hot <br><br>Muh obligatory viewing of Air is just around the corner ;_;</br></br></br>      <br><br>Every time I hear cicadas, I think about Misuzu.</br></br>        <br><br>I always rewatch Kanon when it's winter.<br>I only rewatch it because it had a happy ending, though.</br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eZ5<wbr>E1euk54k</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>The Air OST was really great. Natsukage's my favourite track, though.</br></br>  <br><br>I liked the movie too and didn't find it that "rushed". Sure on its own I don't think it's good enough (let's say to make someone discover Air) but for someone that already knows Air via either the anime or the VN I thought it was pretty good.<br><br>The Clannad movie on the other hand was awful, and this is coming from someone whose favorite anime/VN is Clannad.<br><br>Speaking of OST, the ÔΩûCornwall summer mixÔΩû version is my favorite. Hands done my favorite song featuring Lia.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bAh<wbr>ejPXWwTc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Air is far from being perfect but it's always had this bittersweet summer feeling on me. I love it. Anyway sorry for typing so much I felt like sharing and I'm lonely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. I think people who've read the VN tend to appreciate the VNs more.<br>KyoAni did a wonderful job lining up a lot of the shots, for example, with the VN backgrounds. It's an extra layer of meaning you won't get just by watching the anime.<br><br>I think the Clannad movie messed around with the original storyline too much. Sunohara was also made into a really serious character, when he's better off as a comic sidekick.<br><br>Air makes me think about cicadas and orange sunsets. Thanks for sharing, by the way!  You will always have anonymous by your side :3 </br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>That and jumping straight into the After Story arc might have ruined a lot of things for people who started with the movie (I'm sure there are some out there). Makes me feel sorry for them.<br><br>e-eto,  ano... ////// </br></br></br>  Only two hours to go, anyone else expecting some fun?  will mirai be in this episode?  <br><br>You mean her? No. She's not in the line up of characters. In fact from what I hear, she's introduced MUCH later. Given that this is a J.C. Staff show, we'll probably see more than one cour/season.<br><br>BTW what is the name of this character?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody knows her name. I actually made a thread on /a/ asking her name, but it got deleted. Last I heard, she was going to be in the show.</br>  <br>No clue, since I can't read moon.<br>But if that is her, I have the first four LNs here and she doesn't appear on a single illustration. So I doubt we'll see her in the anime.<br><br>I believe her first appearance is, just like the cover says, in volume 8. Didn't see her on the other samples at all.</br></br></br></br>  I'll just go ahead and post everything I have.    what the fuck is this about?    <br>If no fun SJWs ran the world and 4chan fought back.</br>    <br>Who do you think runs 4chan?</br>  <br>Picked<br><br><br><br><br><br>UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>juice</br>    OPs picture is erotic.          <br>yes please</br>                                    Neetball, right?

Which is why Fusion resorts to turning people into cards afterwards, they can't do any actual damage to the people with the monsters, just buildings and shit, and I think most of the dimensions don't give two craps about ruining their own world, outside of Synchro with the Tops/Slums and that's just more economic than anything.</br>  <br>Hypothetically, if something like Dyson Sphere were ever summoned, it'd probably just be scaled down since there's only so much power you can jam into one duel disk. Like Daibak size instead of their actual size.</br>  KEK<br>You're alright Sawatari.</br>  <br>Wait so for this entire series of duels, couldn't they just realize that they're using styles of summoning and decks that are completely foreign to the City? And does everyone think that hair color and style is completely changeable within 5 minutes or something?</br>  <br>I bet Reira's hair changes color depending on what monsters he summons.</br>   Yuuto could have lived and had another ally if he got Yuugo's name correct in their first meeting   <br>Yuto only existed to praise Yuzu and give Yuya DRXD.</br>  If only Dennis wasn't who he actually was, his facade persona is amazing. <br><br>That's not how Shun would describe him</br></br>  Ruri better have some god-tier character design for them to be stalling her appearance this much  <br>How detailed would you like her card to be?</br>  <br>Super detailed, with an effect, It should make Vennominaga look like god damn speed warrior.</br>   Kurosaki on the D-Wheel <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  Yuto~<br>Shun~</br>    <br>Manga when?</br>  Aw man, seeing Crow again makes me want to see Yusei again so badly. Probably not a good idea storywise but still  <br>don't trigger that one autist</br>  <br>Shun laid down the second biggest smackdown in Yu-Gi-Oh! history, with Jack beating an army of criminals still at first.</br>  <br>I want Sawatari to lose every duel, until the last 3 episodes where he has to have the final duel with Yuya and wins, passing the EGAO torch.</br>  Bumping with Ruri.  <br>Does Yuzu have no shirt on in that?</br>  I want a Ruri and teach her how to duel properly.  I want a Shun to teach me how to duel properly.  <br>You can get out with forbidden chalice + raigeki/dark hole in first hand. Add "cannot be targeted".</br>  <br>Only if you're teaching Yuzu. Serena and Rin would likely punch you or scold you for teaching them.</br>  <br> Talking shit about Rin <br>She's too cute and fluffy to be able to hurt someone. Yuzu is just a mean bully that hits people with fans even after they gave them clothing and shelter.</br></br>  Is this a Ruri?  <br>What the fuck is wrong with her arm.</br>  <br>I'm sorry for your condition Yuugo. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll be with your Ms. Rin soon.</br>  <br>What else would you expect from Batman?</br>  i finally caught up in the series so i can shitpost here<br>why is  sora  best</br>  <br>Because you have bad opinions, Fusion scum</br>  I hope the next opening is sing by  Yuzu's VA.   <br>Fuck no, I hated the ED by her and Masumi that blasted out without warning just when shit was getting good. You see Gon doing cool shit and then suddenly IMA MUNA ODORE YUME CATCH</br>  <br>g e t f u c k e d x y z s c u m</br>  <br>Cute and makes the best faces.</br>  who is the best yuzu and why is it rin  <br>YUZU<br>YUZU<br>YAMERO</br></br></br>  <br>The Yuzu cosplayer isn't actually Yuzu's VA. Yuuna Inamura is a much better singer.</br>   trying to get back in the TCG/OCG after all this time <br> try out the AI on YGOPRO <br> The infamous Qlis I've heard so much about <br><br>Are they suppose to be that broken? I can only imagine how ridiculous Nekroz is, jesus christ, they have a full field of monsters with 2-3k attack by like turn fucking 2-3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because he's the real love interest</br>  <br>There is no best Yuzu at this point</br>  <br>Fusion Ruris are the best Ruris.</br>  <br>Serena is the best Yuzu, the best Rin, the best Ruri, and the best girl.</br>  <br>I thought the first ED were Yuzu and Masumi and then Yuya and Reji wanting to be the perfect in the next.</br>  <br>Yuzu is the best Yuzu. Fight me.</br>  <br> Implying it's not the same case with Arc of smile <br>A "cheerful" opening doesn't hurt too much, but next ED should be more dramatic or something.</br></br>  <br>The Yuzu is just a cosplayer, not her actual VA.</br>  <br>nah<br>they have 1 that isn't even that good but it's summoned by tributing a monster that prevents you from special summoning as long as they control that ritual monster<br> new banlist is coming out soon so no need to worry <br><br><br>i wanna cuddle with him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>Well I got my ass rinsed by AI Qlis just trying to remember how to play, which is probably some of my problem, but still, was not expecting that.</br>   new banlist is coming out soon so no need to worry <br>Not if I have anything to say about it.</br>  <br> no fun allowed <br><br><br>the AI fucking sucks too<br> i got back into it recently too, don't worry<br>it's easy to learn shit and get back into the game</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope so, been trying out a few random decks that seemed cool just to see how they were. I think I'll try Raid Raptors next, hopefully I wont let Shun down.</br>  <br>How steeled is your resolve?</br>   Shivers retardation still makes its way in across dimensions <br>I hate everything</br>  <br>Very, I'm determined to make rule over this children's card game.</br>  <br> Chronos is getting SHIBERU from the Lancers <br> they remind him of Judai <br><br> I loathe Shiberu with my every being </br></br></br></br>  where's the best place to watch the anime  Alright I'm finally at Episode 62. When's the next episode going to be broadcast?  <br> Sunday </br>  <br>On your computer dummy.<br><br>Sunday.</br></br></br>  <br>Boku no Google.</br>  <br>I like to watch it in my living room , on the couch personally</br>  How did the dub adapt SHIVERS?  <br>It's probably the one thing left unchanged.</br>  <br><br>Sounds goo- and there's the shower scene<br>What was I doing again?</br></br></br>  I can understand why everyone's mad at Yuya for being in "muh Yuzu" mode but my soul cries each time he looks/sounds depressed about her.  <br>Yuya needs to realize she's fine. All she's doing is staying in a strange house in the slums with a boy who rides a motorcycle and runs from the police while she wears his ex-gfs short shorts and takes showers around him.<br><br>I mean, it's just a phase Yuya, I'm sure she'll grow out of it, she's being taken good care of though.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, he's sort of right, having the banlist last a specific limited amount of time isn't a good idea.<br>It's best to gradually make changes when needed without being hindered by a calendar</br></br>  <br>That's because you're turning gay. Just accept it.</br>  <br>It got a little silly this episode with the whole willing to abandon his other friends for her and having hallucinations about her.</br>  <br>All he needs to realize is just how stupid Yuugo is, and I think he'll stop being mad. <br><br> turning <br>Yuya had me go bi from episode 1, Shun was the icing on the cake. Serena and the other Ruris are perfect counterbalances though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You wanted Sora dead now you like him? kek</br>  Best YTAS episodes go<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OSq<wbr>kRU8V2iA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'm not stupid, I'm Yugo</br>  <br>I think you're confusing him with me, I'm about to finish catching up right now. I stopped using the terrible grammar after people found it annoying. <br>And yes I still want Sora dead.</br></br>  <br> And yes I still want Sora dead. <br>Why would you want a character who has zero relevance dead? When he beat Shun he literally resigned himself to irrelevance until the final season.</br></br>  <br>changes without timestamps will just alienate the playerbase.<br><br>At least every 3 months you can expect your deck to get kill instead of any day from today.</br></br></br>  <br> Loses to a nameless generic cop <br> Now challenges 3 nameless elite cops <br>What could possibly go wrong?</br></br></br>  <br>If there wasn't a set date to change the banlist, the "economy" of YGO would crash because players wouldn't know whether or not a card will remain un-hit for a certain period of time. Cards that are worth $50 would suddenly drop to $5 because they would lose an inherent value in possible playability.</br>  <br>The fact that he'll be back is enough.<br><br>Alright I'm calling BS on that sign captcha. That last one wasn't even a sign, just a square shaded brown.</br></br></br>  <br> implying cutlets are steak </br>  <br>Nothing, it's just as planned. He's losing on purpose to help everyone else out. <br><br>Also Synchro is the strongest dimension and Reiji wouldn't have had him along if he didn't have potential. He's gonna end up doing something great and get fucked over for it eventually.</br></br></br>  <br> Synchro is the strongest dimension <br>ZETSUBOOOOO</br></br>  It always makes me laugh that there's this one Sawatari fangirl/boy in this thread  <br> one <br>Nice joke.</br></br>  <br>More than 1 person has good taste here you know</br>  <br>What episode was this from?</br>  <br> Sawatari fangirl/boy <br>Sure.</br></br>  Does anyone else think Crow is just as unlikable in here as he was in 5ds?  <br>But he's like Gamera, friend to all children</br>    <br>Doesn't change the fact that I hate his voice, deck, attitude, or design. <br>God I hate Crow.</br></br>  <br> Not BUYING BLACKWINGS </br>  So did anyone else play Duel Accelerator or Duel Evolution?  <br>The less he does and the sooner he goes, the better.</br>  <br>What's wrong with his voice?</br>  So, today's manzai is Yuzu complaining a lot of things about being entered into the Friendship Cup, and how Yugo keeps saying "Don't worry about it!". That's about it.<br><br>But like I said in the last thread, I'm not able to upload screenshots due to shit internet quality. I mean I have screenshots, but it's KeyholeTV since that's the only program that's working with me in this country. My usual stream program requires fast internet connection since they're all in HD.<br><br>Full script translation will come later though as usual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with his voice, attitude, or design?<br><br>I have no idea why you hate his voice when Crow's seiyuu is literally sex. He can be retarded but he's also a nice guy. If you don't like him because of that instance in the previous episode, realize that he's been in jail before, 3 times going by his marks, and he didn't want Yuya or any of his friends to get hurt after they had broke out.<br><br>And the only thing in my opinion stupid about his design is again, the three marks. They are all over the fucking place.<br><br>I think you just hate him because you hopped on the bandwagon in all honesty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoever they are I hope they are prepared for what's coming to them.</br>  BAHSAHKAH SOUL?  <br><br>Didn't Yami call one of his cards trash or something? I'd like to see Yusei try to do something about that</br></br>  <br>MONSTAH CARDO!</br>  <br>Rin a shit. No reason to like her right now other than 'muh pretty girl'.</br>  <br>It'd be funny if Jack did accel Synchro in front of a huge crowd and they inserted Aporia with a ZESTUBO face in the middle of the background.</br>  <br>That fucking Macbook kills me every time.</br>  <br>Jack doesn't Accel Synchro, he's going to double tune out Vylon Omega.</br>  <br> Accel synchro  <br> Not BURNING SOUL <br>They are both advanced forms of synchro summoning anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> not double accel tuning </br>  <br>Jack's burning soul has been extinguished. Haven't you seen the OP or what?</br>  <br>He's isn't going to preform either he will just spam RED DEMONS DRAGON repeatdly.</br>  <br>He said they were useless and he couldn't use them, not exactly trash cards. Which he couldn't use them, it was just a bad hand.</br>  <br> Implying there's anything in this world that's useless </br>  Today's manzai:<br><br> Yuzu: Am I really going to enter the Friendship Cup!? <br><br> Fusion: That's right! Winning through this tournament and fighting against Jack isn't just a dream anymore!  <br><br> Yuzu: But I don't even know this 'Jack' person! <br><br> Fusion: Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: I also don't know how to do riding duels! <br><br> Fusion: Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: But! What if the Security catches us and sends us to the Prison Camps?! <br><br> Fusion: Umm, well....Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: You should really worry about it, even just a little!! <br><br>Image source from maxut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Jack makes Yuya cry </br>  <br>Yugo has completely forgotten about Rin.</br>  <br>YUGO JA NE YUUGO DA!</br>  <br>He's killing the fruits off one at a time. First Yuto and now he's about to destroy Yuya's will to live by NTRing him. <br><br>Rin is old and busted, Yuzu is the new honest, they're Yugo together.</br></br></br>  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>I'm gonna fuck that citrus.</br>  <br>yuuya pls.</br>    <br>I want to brush her hair.</br>  <br>Being this cute and sexual should be illegal.</br>    <br>Yuuuuuto?</br>  <br>How the fuck would Shun get Yuya and Yuto mixed up..</br>  <br>PTSD from seeing Ghost Yuto by Yuya. <br><br> finally get word captcha <br> 262 <br> Instant Fail and back to Street Signs, Pasta, and Hamburgers <br><br>Lovely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way everyone else managed to originally.

This entire prison arc could have been avoided if they looked at decks. <br> tfw I push my glasses up in the same way and have the same love for scarves  <br>Now if only I could be a tenth of the duelist</br></br></br>  <br>Yuto ;_;</br>  <br>Jean-Michel figured out that Yuya and Selena weren't the fugitives he was looking for by them using Fusion and Pendulums. He didn't care to tell any of his team anyway, and wanted them captured for their summoning methods.</br>  This is not a hate post.  <br>;-;</br>  <br>Technically, seeing what Selena uses wouldn't matter since he hasn't seen Yuzu's deck anyway.</br>    My pathetic grandpa's deck has no cards, Kaiba    <br>I push them up the same way friend. <br><br>Serena is acceptable but Yuya suddenly busting out not Speedroids, should have been enough before Pendulum, unless he did it Turn 1, I don't remember, if so, ignore my dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuto coming back when<br>Ruri being revealed and saved when</br></br>  What kind of movies do you think the Yuus would watch?  <br> Never ever </br>  <br>Yuya: Comedy and adventure<br>Yuto: Horror and  romance <br>Yugo: Action and sci-fi<br>Yuri: Thriller and drama</br></br></br></br>  <br> romance <br>Is that where all the stuff he did with Yuzu came from?</br></br>  <br>The leglocking is my favorite thing about that image.</br>  Yuuto~~~  <br> Yugo <br>What does fusion have to do with this?</br></br>  <br>Reminder that the tomato don't care about his nakamas and would betray them for the citrus.</br>  <br>Yeah but with a lip bite like that, I just wish  I was the citrus  </br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>That just makes him Judai, but not gay. Or maybe still half gay because I'm pretty sure Yuya'd still want the citrus even if she was a boy.</br>  <br>When will Pegasus appear in Arc-V to shill new Toons?</br>  <br>It makes a little more sense than Johan since Yuya's known Yuzu most of his life, rather than like a month.</br>  <br>I don't know why Serena's in a combat stance but it looks hilarious.</br>  Why is he smelling the citrus?  <br>Pegasus' dub VA is appearing at Nats to shill new Toons.<br><br>So is Marik's dub VA.</br></br></br>  <br>He's like a T.

Is this kid cheating?!"<br>"Well, the system doesn't say it's cheating, so..."<br><br><br>Flame Wingman was his ace because of its OTK properties. It's also his favorite monster. Then they added Neos for fuck-who-knows and he dropped Wingman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The fact that they are supporting more magicians and odd eyes monsters makes me think Yuya really will ditch his performapals one day.  <br>Yep<br>Flame Wingman, way cooler than fucking Neos</br></br>  <br>He still used Flame Wingman quite often after Season 2 but most of the time it was fodder for Shining Flare Wingman</br>  <br> implying Yusho doesn't use Magicians <br> implying Yusho isn't about to show up after the 75-mark </br></br>  <br>something is wrong yusei is showing emotions.</br>   tfw godly revolutioning with my raptors <br> tfw opponent destiny draws <br> tfw Mirror Force or Raigeki <br><br>Every time, every time. I'm sorry I've let you down Shun. ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Skyscraper worked in both battle phases back then and Elemental HERO Blazeman and King of Swamp and Elemental HERO Prisma were thinks, Heros would of been some broken motherfuckers.</br>  <br>Not every episode can be an Ebina episode, anon. Even if they should be.</br>  <br> by far the worst though <br><br>That's not literally transforming into an egyptian prince and somehow drawing 5 pieces of Exodia</br></br></br>  <br>I just wish that the main duels didn't look like shit.</br>  <br>He got shit for it in episode 2 and wasn't in control when everything got pendulum'd. But what I still don't get is that the others who talked him down for it don't really question or care about where they came from in the first place, only that he used them.<br><br>Both Synchro and Standard reacted to Pendulums like they're merely seeing a new fashion trend despite summoning methods being a big deal.</br></br></br>  Hey guys remember that one duel where Kaiba was about to kill himself because Yami took control of his BEUD?  <br>Blazeman is still used in some decks at the very least.</br>  <br> Elemental Hero Prisma <br><br>At first I thought this was a manga card until Jaden used it literally once the entire saga against Yubel</br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty hype seeing yuuya go<br> negated ;) <br>like a pro</br></br></br>  <br>So is Prisma, only it's Destiny Hero and Dark Magician decks. That's the beauty of heroes, If they can't find a place in their archetype they can find one elsewhere. Well except, Captain Gold, that poor bastard. Nobody will ever play skyscarper.</br>  <br>But that worked because of the Millennium Puzzle, you knew there was twisted magical stuff going on and Exodia falls in line with that. Arc-V was just Yuuya pulling stuff out of thin air due to pure willpower because he's the main character.</br>  <br>Jean Michael seems pretty interested in the new summoning methods he's seeing, and Chojiro thought it was merely something new that's caught on since he's been in prison<br>Crow was the only one that seemed weirdly not bothered by it</br></br>  <br>He`s probably not bothered by it because he will never stop getting new BURAKU FEZAS</br>  <br>Wait so Yugi is allowed to pull bullshit because of the puzzle but Yuya's pendulum/D R A G O N S don't get a pass?</br>  <br> We used to think that it was the pendant power then Odd eyes possesing Yuuya and later thanks to mieru we now think it was some darkness. <br><br>How will this ride end?</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably just Arslan Senki conditioning me, but I'm just glad that there are still passable to good looking episodes here and there. It's when the QUALITY is a feature of pretty much every single episode that it starts to wear on me. <br><br>5D's Pre WRGP was also in production during the time of the BBT movie, and the animation fell apart even worse at times than with Arc-V.</br></br></br>  <br>Crow was probably spying on their duel against the Security when they first arrived from afar, so he'd have known.</br>  <br>I'd argue that the appearance of Pendulums is what let the viewers know that something's up with the pendant in the first place, rather than exposition dumping about it within the intro. The mythology stuff takes a backseat to most everything else in Arc-V, unlike DM where it was the main focus.</br>  <br>Shit I just realized<br>We're like 60 episodes in and we STILL have no idea what the fuck is up with the pendant</br></br>  <br>I mean Yugi had a thousand year old Egyptian mystical artifact change him into a different person before he enacted his moves, Yuuya just got into a tight spot and reflected on himself a bit.<br><br>I suppose I can agree with this, but I'd add that the pendulum necklace itself has thus far had barely any importance outside of "muh dad." I mean Yuzu's bracelet has done loads more at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>And we will probably be kept in the dark until after yuuya dad shows up in the last arc</br>  <br>It swung in Yuya and Yuto's combined mental space, so it probably has something to do with the Yus.</br>  <br> Yusho is the big bad <br>How butthurt would Yuuya be?</br></br>  <br>That's what happens when there's no space dolphin or a Shadi to explain all the magic stuff for the main cast.<br><br>But that also means there's no mystical guide pushing a quest onto them, so the stuff like the Lancers trying to find allies, preventing Standard/Synchro from getting their shit pushed in by Academia, and any other goals are more personally motivated.<br><br><br>The pendant is what allowed pendulum cards to appear, and any glimpses we have so far about the mythology behind Arc-V (the magicians and the Yuus' dragons) are all related to the pendant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>liking nekroz for reason other than how good they are is suffering</br>  <br> not wanting to fuck Shurit </br>    <br>It just means that Yuya is actually from Fusion and is possessed by Yuri's Dragon or he ate Yusho and now Yusho is mad pissed.</br>  <br> Yuuya just got into a tight spot and reflected on himself a bit. <br>Other than the glowing Pendant where obviously the Pendulums came from, it might not be that obvious, but Yuya was indeed possessed when he was pushed to that tight spot.<br><br>He was chanting the exact same words when he was doing Pendulum Summoning in Edge Mode. When he's possessed, he calls his monsters slaves or servants and uses a pronoun to refer to himself that's a bit archaic.<br><br>Also he didn't remember any clear details at all just like when he went Edge Mode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Skyscraper 3 that's treated as Skyscraper and broken as fuck maybe?</br>  <br>Serena-sama, do your homework.</br>  Why is Shun so best?    <br> The Yuus and Ruris don't have real parents <br>At least Yuya has Yoko, and Yuzu has Shuzo. Yugo and Rin are orphans, and Ruri was likely adopted by the Kurosakis. I wonder about the rest.</br></br>  <br>He just is.</br>  <br>FULL ZETSUBOU</br>  <br><br> The Fruits and Ruris are kids of past series characters <br><br>That'd be cool actually.<br><br>Probably like Yugo and Rin and just orphans. Serena was probably an orphan Leo found and he promised that she could be important and useful one day, Yuri probably was just some shit kid orphan that wanted to cause problems, Yuto was probably an orphan that Ruri befriended and Shun accepted it and they became friends eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  /a/rc V has good taste in boys  <br>At least they aren't Judai</br>  <br>On a scale from 1 to Aporia, how Zetsubou we talking here?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fUw<wbr>3tO0zEAE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127559656 <br>Please fuck off.</br>  <br>It's alright, Judai was the first cool kid hanging out by the school yard and then doing sweet prince of persia shit in venice and blocking DBZ dragon blasts.</br>  <br>Ignore and report.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127559656 <br> One Piece <br> One Piece tripfag <br><br>You're what's wrong with the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece is fine, no need to start shit and antagonize and obvious shitposting tripfag regardless of what he's tripping about.

Why isn't he the main character?  <br>He's not as cute as Yuuya</br>  <br>He will soon become the main character once he fully cucks Yuzu from Yuya</br>  <br>Because we already had Yusei as an MC once.</br>  <br> assuming Yuya would ever do anything interesting or morally grey <br><br>Nah.</br></br></br>  <br>Because ARC-V is fun but not very good.

But it was the case of not thinking fully of the consequences when he asked if he could join Crow for the escape plan.<br><br>But when he was reminded by Crow of treasuring his friends, he did played with the idea of abandoning them just so he could save Yuzu.<br><br>Well, it's probably one of those foreshadowing cases if the idea is going to be used.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why rhyme when you can look cool not doing it?</br>  <br>Yuya is going to do eventually.

Need to balance things out. Yin and yang and all that.  Just give it to me, animators </br></br>  <br>You know, I find it weird how in 5Ds, Zexal and Arc-V burn strategies are portrayed as "not really dueling","cowardly" and "unsportsmanlike", even though back in GX Flame Wingman always won Judai duels with Burn with nobody complaining</br>   tfw can whip Nekroz decks with RR <br> tfw get whipped by SatellarKnight and Qliphorts <br><br>Hmmm...</br></br></br>  <br>If it's a burn effect that involves the battle phase, or if the BP is still a main part of the player's strategy, then it's all good.</br>  <br>As has been pointed out before, YGO often has a double standard when it comes "bad" playstyles.<br>If a good character does it it's OK. If a bad character or a good character whose embraced/posessed by DARKNESS then it's bad or cowardly.<br>Burn, mill, lockdown, alternate win conditions, "sacrificing" monsters among others are often unfairly demonized unless a good character does it</br></br></br>  <br>That depends. I remember Anna's Gustav burn being considered pretty aweosme and not cowardly at all.</br>  Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the cutest Yuu of them all?  <br>There is a reason Judai never won King of Games or Dueling Champion.<br><br>A lot of people in DM gave no fucks one way or the other, they were all cheating, sacrifice shit, alternating win conditions, burning, etc. Granted DM was the start and nobody had any idea what they were doing really.</br></br></br>  <br> and doesn't even need action cards or pendulum summoning to win duels. <br>He doesn't need them because he's got a motorcycle, anon.</br></br>  <br>Yugo, just look at the face of pleasure on himself and his new bitch.</br>  <br>Yuto</br>  <br>In DM, Yami was furious at Arkana for sacrificing his Dark Magician for Ectoplasmer and Arkana received "karmic justice" because that move powered up Yugi's DMG.<br>And when Yami was posessed by Orichalcos, the fact that he was sacrificing his monsters to burn with Catapult Turtle was suposed to indicate his corruption.</br></br>    <br>I killed one of Yu already, I'm going to kill Yu by taking Yuzu and making her mine.</br>  <br>I think its more intent than anyone else. If you use burn to bitch out in taking an opponent head on ( Which Anna didnt do, she was still straight up with her dueling) or sacrifice monsters without appreciating and honoring their sacrifice (as Arcana and Oricalcos Atem did) you're wrong<br><br><br> ABANAI! </br></br></br></br>  How will Yuya get a D-Wheel?? does the friendship cup just give one out for free?  <br>And abandon Ms. Rin? Tsk tsk, Fusion!<br><br>Now that you mention it, I wonder when DDDDDDD will get his own D-Wheel too.</br></br></br>   Wow I'm not even trying and I'll beat you Shun <br> Okay I'll try and beat you for sure <br> Okay I'll go all out now you're dead Xyz scum <br> Wow I lost  <br> Obviously because I didn't go all out even though I said I did <br> Rematch but only after weeks of prep and with backup <br>Get shit on Sora</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugo...Da, also I'm gonna get all the Ruris and make the Ultimate Citrus Fruit Smoothie out of the rest of Yu and the Ruris. <br><br>Don't forget that the duel took place over like half a day, so he had to stall as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Did it actually 12 hours??</br>  Is Shuzo really Yuzu's father??? He couldn't even tell the difference between Yuzu and Serena  <br>Well he only saw Serena at a distance and they are supposed to be identical in the anime.</br>  <br> Is Shuzo really Yuzu's father??? <br>No</br></br>  <br>Is Yuzu really Yuuya's soulmate? She couldn't even tell the difference between Yuuto and Yuuya</br>  <br>All Ruris are soulmates to all Yuyas anon. You can do mix and match and they'll all still lust after each other.</br>  <br>Well I'd assume so, I mean the day/night cycle did turn outside of the duel system too.</br>  Ruri a shit  <br>It's a rental</br>  <br>Late, but sure.<br><br>The characters are all pretty one-note so far. The conflict between XYZ and fusion looked like it could be deal with in an interesting way, but so far it's been presented as totally black-and-white and kind of boring, which is unusual for a YGO show. Yuya's subplot about being possessed is extremely boring because he has zero agency in it.<br><br>The plot moves really slowly; it's been 60 episodes and the story hasn't really moved all that much. Yet at the same time, so many things feel very rushed and don't pack the emotional punch that they should, like Yuto's death or Sora's, well, anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which series do you think is best then? DM? 5Ds?</br>  <br>Not him but I feel every Yu-Gi-Oh has it's flaws even the orginal source material. Each series has a good premise but Zexal had terrible excution, the orginal manga was about dark games with a little Egyptian myth sprinkled in early on that grew into a much bigger story, 5D's had the best setting and could have been the best Yu-Gi-Oh to date if the crap that went down doing production didn't happen, GX is just a crazy acid trip and by far the most enjoyable but still has a shit ton of plotholes, and Arc-V as some have said moves very slowly and we just want to get to XYZverse and Fusionverse already. In other words, the best Yu-Gi-Oh is different for each personal so there is really no best Yu-Gi-Oh just person favorite.</br>  <br>The anon who posted it originally, and basically what  said.<br><br>I love YGO, but objectively speaking, none of the series are exactly well-written. I'd say probably the one with the "best" writing is the first half of 5D's, but my favorite is definitely GX. It was silly as fuck and severely misused a lot of its supporting cast, but it at least pulled off some interesting things for a card game show and a lot of the character growth was quite good by the end.</br></br></br>  Found my new wallet.  <br><br> Complaining about Arc-V pace then saying GX is best <br><br>simply ebin.<br><br>Besides that I ENJOY most characters in Arc-V, I just can't say the same about past series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post some Kallen.  How much 'till we actually see DA PERFECT again?  <br>Less than 24 hours.</br>  <br>Less than 23!</br>  <br> and a lot of the character growth was quite good by the end. <br>Most characters didn't really grow or develop at all.<br>I prefer Arc-V's character arcs</br></br></br>  <br>That looks like a purse.</br>  <br>The difference is that the first two seasons of GX didn't have a plot to pace through. They were basically card game slice-of-life, which isn't necessarily better but it means it was aiming for something entirely different. Once it got to the season with actual story, season three, it was actually very tightly plotted.<br><br><br> Most characters didn't really grow or develop at all. <br>They did. That was the entire point of the last season.<br><br> I prefer Arc-V's character arcs <br>What character arcs?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   http://ygorganization.com/noteyeof<wbr>thetiger/</wbr> <br><br>Beast-Eyes is next Jump Promo. I'm OK with this, it's not a card that's "needed" in any deck, and no deck needs to use 3 of them, so it doesn't really screw Europeans. Jump promos should never be too good or essential for a deck to work (still mad about Frighfur Tiger).<br>Besides, odds are it'll get reprinted in the Master of Pendulum structure</br></br></br>  <br>Oh,  again.<br><br>I also would like to point out that I deliberately only said I enjoyed GX the most and that it didn't mean it was the "best," so. Nice reading comprehension there.</br></br></br>  <br> That was the entire point of the last season. <br> last season. <br><br>That's the problem.</br></br></br></br>  http://ygorganization.com/igknightk<wbr>ouitten/<br><br>Another Igknight with the same damn effect.<br>However, I'd like to point out the flavor text<br> The lone woman among the Igknights who is coddled by her colleagues. Even though her prized weapon take down her allies more often than her enemies, none of them complain about it. <br><br>Konami clearly isn't putting much effort into getting girls to play the game</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>It was not a promblem at all.</br>  <br>Why should they?</br>  <br> Even though her prized weapon take down her allies more often than her enemies, none of them complain about it <br>Shit nigga, that's moe as fuck. <br><br> &gt;The lone woman among the Igknights <br>Reminds me of Burstinatrix's original flavour text. Maybe if the archtype goes on for long enough they'll add another chick and erra it to be<br> The first woman among the Igknights <br>like Burst did</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because money?</br>  <br>The last season highlighted their growth, but it came before it. Characters like Shou and Manjoume, for example, grew a lot throughout the series. Even though I fucking hated Shou.</br>  <br>What is she doing with that severed hand?</br>  <br>Money isn't everything.</br>  <br>doesn't help season 2 most of them were just brainwased and season 3 they were busy dying heh.</br>  <br> Money isn't everything. <br>We're talking about Konami here, to them everything is money</br></br>  <br>They like quality products.</br>  <br>They definitely got shelved in season 3 (in favor of the transfer students, who are more interesting anyway), but most of the side cast had some focus in season 2.<br><br>But GX's side cast isn't really its strong point, I think everyone can agree on that. For me, Judai's character arc alone was good enough to really elevate the series as a whole.</br></br></br>  <br>How exactly is casual sexism "quality"?</br>  So we are basically in agreement that, regardless of how you feel about the source material, this was an indisputably shit first episode? Good, I'm glad we cleared that up.  <br>Every single show this season other than Working S3 is indisputable shit.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  The source material was shit in the first place. A-1 of course managed to make it even shitter.  <br> they randomly change the uniform to something easier to draw <br> mfw </br></br>  <br><br>It is pizdets, comrade.</br></br>  <br>I disagree.</br>  <br>No anon you don't understand, the new uniform better fits with the terrain inside the Gate and thus lets the operators operate undetected. It's definitely not a case of budget.</br>  <br>It's made all the more blatant by virtue of them using the flectarn for all their advertising.<br>Such as the OP itself.<br><br>The only scenes with flecktarn were the cafeteria, and frankly it was shit, they just used a single image and cut it to the right shape.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first episode was indeed shit. And I actually enjoy the source material.</br>   people saying first episode is shit <br> I find nothing wrong with it <br>What's so shit about it?</br></br>  <br>No, you're a faggot.</br>  <br> source material <br>So how are the novels?</br></br>  <br>Better than the manga adaption, although I enjoy that too.</br>  <br>Nothing really happened, not even during the invasion. It just set things up but it felt really awkward and honestly pretty rushed.</br>  <br> pretty rushed <br>That's because invasion part and Itami's stuff prior to that was stretched out as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the Itami stuff prior to the invasion should have been shortened down. The invasion also lacked impact. I don't want to sound edgy, but a few more brutal deaths on-screen would have served to make it feel more threatening and give it a bigger impact. It felt stretched out but nothing actually felt like it happened during it.</br>  Yes, but should I watch it. This is one of the shows I'm on the fence about this season.  <br>It wasn't even rushed. They just deliberately didn't focus on it. Never even explained what Itami was doing with the police as he never pulled the whole JSDF routine and shouted orders.</br>  <br>I meant everything after the invasion felt rushed.</br>  can't wait for more fire support and erected nipple  <br>Give it the 3 episode rule like with everything else.</br>  <br>I never said otherwise. Just posted an example.</br>  I thought it was okay the sudden rank of 2nd LT was silly but then again this is a show where a gate drops out of no where in the middle of Japan full of goblins dragons and ogres so meh.<br><br>OST sounds promising though, MC being otaku might make it bearable, I was expecting some alpha normie MC.</br></br>  Animation was shit (all the budget was on the military equipment). <br><br>Character designs were awful. Only good thing in the manga was the girls and now they look terrible.</br></br>  <br>So we are basically in agreement that, regardless of how you feel about the OP, this was an indisputably shit first post? Good, I'm glad we cleared that up.</br>  I don't really get the complaints that the first episode was nationalistic. Literally nothing happened in that regard except that, I don't know, the empra let the civilians into the palace? There's nothing nationalistic about people with guns blowing the fuck out of things still using swords.<br><br>My main complaint is that it was fucking shit. I feel like the MC is a super fucking insert character - he's an otaku man who ends up "saving countless civilian lives" by yelling at them to run the way everyone is already yelling. Then he tackles some roman fucker who fell off his dragon and kills him. All the while he's asking himself "teehee, I sure hope they don't close the stores before I buy those doujins ;)" For these reasons the police let this civilian run around with them and get him a decent position in the JSDF.<br><br>I mean what the fug. This is almost as bad as SAO, but at least I can believe a chuuni faggot can become #1 MMO man EU.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MC being otaku might make it bearable <br>It's like you want me to hate you.</br></br>  <br>If by "sudden rank" you mean he went from a nobody to 2LT then you're wrong, he was already a high rank in the JDSF.</br>  <br>Yeah, Itami never really did much other than stab a guy and stand there talking to the cops yet he was celebrated as a hero.<br><br>I get that they wanted to create some mystery as to who Itami really is but they fucking show him as a JSDF officer in the opening and promotional material so what's the fucking point?<br><br><br>Nigga he was already a JSDF NCO at the very least. He's a trained soldier, which is why he could take down an armed opponent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, man. For something like a mass panic few on-screen deaths works fine. Someone's head flew there, someone and their baby crushed here is good enough.</br>  <br>It feels like they cut corner and budget there.<br>You can't really feel the scale of invasion and casualties that happened.</br></br>  Anyone able to identify the tanks they were using? Sure as fuck wasn't the Type 10. Turret looked too forward like a ghetto T-34.  <br>Would you rather have action man MC cause I wouldn't.<br><br><br>Oh it makes sense then.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nigga he was already a JSDF NCO at the very least <br><br>Oh, nevermind then. That makes this waaay more bearable.  Still a bad episode though. </br></br></br>  <br> this was an indisputably shit first episode? <br>Aside from a few budget shots of dragons flying around, it was a fat lot of nothing.</br></br>  <br>Yes, this was one of the worst first episodes I have seen in a while. The animation wasn't even outstanding, so the rest of the series should be even worse.</br>  I just want to appraise everyone of my chief concerns over GATE, which based on this thread seem pretty relevant:<br><br>- There may not actually be any cathartic violence. You may have noticed during the invasion that it cut away every time someone was about to get hurt. Itami shanking a dude was a good start but keep in mind it was as close to offscreen as it could be without actually being offscreen. I had concerns that censorship would be heavy before this screened and Ep1 has not helped.<br><br>- Haremshit dialled up past current nominal limits set by the anime. As it is an anime, exaggerating the haremshit to somehow create extra dollars is likely. Ep1 also did not help with this given they fucking inserted a scene where Itami precognitively hallucinates about the girls he's going to meet beyond the gate, which frankly changes the tone of the series significantly since there are now implications that Itami is magic. And also that this is an adaptation of a VN instead of a manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oops, meant to say past the limits set by the manga. The Manga is as haremshit as I am willing to go.</br>  <br>The anime did a terrible job at explaining that he was already a soldier. I can imagine how if you haven't read the manga or LN you'd think he was just given the 2LT rank out of nowhere.<br><br><br>The only relatively brutal death was that one guy getting his stomach sliced open. They actually showed that.<br><br>Also don't forget that they made the girls look much cuter than the manga. They don't even look like the same characters anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he's an otaku man who ends up <br>I don't understand how you can omit the fact that he's military when he constantly brings up how he does it for the paycheck to support his hobby.<br><br>Also, he's JSDF special forces ranger.<br><br> "teehee, I sure hope they don't close the stores before I buy those doujins ;)" <br><br>It's an event he was looking forward to. Also, some places still continue business even after horrible shit goes down.<br><br><br> exaggerating the haremshit to somehow create extra dollars is likely. <br><br>People have been saying this ever since it was announced. They're going to do it to drive focus away from certain right-wing parts and increase merchandise revenue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling they were trying to go for a bait and switch by making it seem like the MC was your typical self insert otaku protagonist then reveal he was actually a super elite opr8tor but managed to fuck up the reveal and made him seem a gary stu.</br>  This will become the new AoT/SAO because muh violence and army in anime. Mark my words.<br>Time to embrace the upcoming flood of normies loving it.</br>  <br><br>Well, no need to give my opinion on the first episode, seeing how you already said everything I was going to.<br><br>Well, you did miss the whole Japanese riot cops going after the invaders with their clubs and shields and going "ARREST THEM!", which should have been mandatory to include.</br></br></br></br>  <br> emoticon <br> SAO <br>You're only here to troll, aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Itami shanking a dude <br>Going from playing mobages and obsessing over the doujinshi event to offing soldiers in the most cold blooded way was ridiculously jarring.</br></br>  <br>I just can't get behind Rori's retarded downgraded dress, and let's not even talk of Lelei's "kawaiii uguuu" face.<br>What the hell happened to the serious, down-to-business sage?</br></br>  <br> The anime did a terrible job at explaining that he was already a soldier <br>I guess they expected the OP to do the job for them.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Pretty much this. It's like reading the synopsis of the show, then watching the same synopsis stretched over 20 minutes again. It was a lukewarm, unfocused episode which didn't even know what was it trying to convey.</br></br></br>  <br> Plays mobage where he kills fantasy shit <br> "It's jarring to see him kill fantasy shit" </br></br>  <br>No, that honor goes to Classroom Crisis.</br>  <br>Yeah that's the impression I got too but they fucked it up hard. Especially since the mystery was already void because of the OP.</br>  <br>Do you think soldiers are always on edge and in kill mode 24/7? No, it's like a switch. Training kicks in.</br>  <br> video games define reality <br>So many potential murderers around us.<br><br><br>Congrats at missing the entire point.</br></br></br></br></br>  I can't remember, did the source material actually go into all that much detail as to what Itami actually did the day of the invasion to be named a hero?<br>'Cause the show sure as hell did an unconvincing job of why he would be singled out as a hero.<br>From my vague recollections of the manga, didn't they mostly leave it up to the reader's imagination exactly what he did?</br></br>  <br>The problem was that the anime made an awful job at explaining that he was actually a soldier all along. In the manga at least he started barking out orders and organizing the evacuation of civilians while his JSDF buddies moved in to push back the invasion. He felt like a proper officer even if they didn't explicitly state it.<br><br>Here they just made him feel like a bumbling idiot who shanked a dude and talked a bit to a couple of cops.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;video games define reality <br>It was a tongue-in-cheek jab at what he'll be doing later. Same as with all the fantasy anime wall scrolls and figs in his apartment.</br></br>  <br> made the girls look much cuter than the manga <br>It took me a while to realize who they are. What the fuck, man.</br></br>  Waiting to see Ruris sexual advances animated.<br>My D can't wait</br>  <br>They just look like generic moeblobs now. Where's my sadistic hardass?</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Holy shit how embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't have a point. You arbitrarily called it jarring despite it being the normal, expected result of a huge massacre suddenly breaking out in the street.</br>    Did he suddenly get a military rank? <br>I didn't get that part at all</br>  <br>Your D might be waiting a while. My money is on them not even putting it in, for normie appeal.</br>  <br>Who the fuck is ruri?</br>  <br>The manga kicked off from the moment they have established a base of operations on the other side and in-depth studies of their society. Itami's stuff was brought back as a vague flashback of maybe one page at most. He was only irritated when they talked about it, but in the flashback shots he seemed like a proper soldier in civil, giving proper orders.</br>  <br>Battlefield promotion.</br>  <br>STB-1.<br><br>The SDF uses outdated equipment because no budget.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. He just got promoted to a junior officer. He was probably a senior NCO like a Sergeant Major or something along those lines,</br>  <br>Already explained in the thread.<br><br>Seriously, are people just accepting that a random otaku has combat experience?</br></br></br>  <br> You arbitrarily called it jarring  <br>Are you a complete retard?</br></br>  <br>Since it was terribly explained, he's a Special Forces ranger with training leagues ahead of your average JSDF soldier. He was most likely an NCO prior to the invasion and was bumped up a rank to 2LT for his supposed heroics, which the anime once again didn't show properly.</br>  <br>Ah. Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>Really now?</br>  <br><br>No, that's a prototype model.<br>The production model is the Type 74.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah they really should have left out a good chunk of this episode. <br>It should have shown the Gate appearing and all hell breaking loose, then some sort of news footage reporting on the aftermath and eventually moving onto a report on Itami that leads into his award ceremony where he's doing the Otaku lament in his head of not having gotten his swag.<br>that way you save the glorious modern military ownage of fantasy forces for the actual counter-invasion on the other side of the gate where it'll be more impressive.</br></br></br>  <br>The better Oreimo.</br>  <br>Thanks, did they even show that in the anime.<br>I didn't catch that at all.</br></br>  I'm going to reserve my hopes for this anime until they show the battle with the 120,000 otherworld soldiers against the JSDF using mortars atop the hill.<br><br>If they manage to make it look nice and not shit. I'll keep it on the watchlist.</br></br>  <br>Nope, but even the manga doesn't tell you he's actually SF until after they get through the gate.</br>  <br> he was already a high rank in the JDSF <br>How the hell did he menage that? he was just a lazy Otaku.</br></br>  <br>First episode did an absolutely terrible job of establishing him as a member of the military prior to the invasion. They were obviously trying to lean on the joke of an Otaku in the military but pushed way too fucking hard on the Otaku bit.</br>  <br>It was shown. The goddamn newspaper and the news report said a JSDF officer was being promoted or something along those lines.<br><br>Also, this thread reeks of idiocy.</br></br></br>  <br>So in order to make sense of anything, I'm going to have to read the LN/manga? Its shaping up to be this seasons Yahari and were only one episode in.</br>  <br>He's not very enthusiastic about his job, but he does it well.</br>  <br> People voicing their complaints is idiocy </br>  <br>Holy shit, is that middle girl supposed to be the big boobed soldier of Itami's squad? <br><br>I was actually liking most of the design changes for the elf and sorcerer, but they fucked up with the princess and the soldier.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the entire point that he works in the JSDF to get money for his lifestyle?<br>And of course a hire rank gives you a higher pay, so he'd be incentivized to do so.</br></br>  <br>I want to believe it's not her but who else would it be?</br>  <br>Well he just don't want to be kicked out and i think most of his career is build by coincidence.</br>  <br>Don't listen to him, he's picking at straws to shit on the anime.<br><br>His training isn't revealed until much later. The did fine for the first episode. It was always meant to be a reveal that he was a soldier.</br></br></br>  <br>In the manga (and I assume in the LNs) Itami was promoted to !st LT, which assumes he was already a 2nd LT.</br>  <br> The lazy but brilliant slacker otaku MC <br>Oh fuck, not this archetype.</br></br>  <br>Nigga I actually explained that you don't get to know he's actually an SF soldier until later. I'm not trying to shit on the anime, but with so many people asking the same questions they obviously did something wrong in how they explained that Itami is actually a soldier.</br>  <br>Complaining because you didn't pay any attention to the episode is idiocy.</br>  <br> slacker <br>There's nothing implying he's a slacker. From what anime shown us, he's competent, skilled, but he just prefers being a neckbeard over his job.</br></br>  <br>I thought something seemed wrong with his promotion.</br>  I like the music<br><br>Loli with PTSD makes me boners</br></br>  <br>He's widely acknowledged as a slacker and at most an average soldier (although an average japanese soldier is apparently tiers above any other nation).<br><br>He got his position and prestige through coincidences and his close relation to the other world's inhabitants.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah he's not that bad. When he's in uniform and on the clock he does away with the unenthusiastic otaku routine and acts like a solider.</br>  Reminder that cop took out a dragon rider with a shitty snubnosed .38.<br>He should be the MC.</br>  <br>That feel when Ami or Mami wrecks you're shiznits.</br>  <br> dragon </br>  While it does have less gore it doesn't detract from the episode. The only things they didn't portray right were the death toll of the victims and Itami's being a soldier. I know the director was going for the shock value when a random otaku suddenly took control of the situation, but the audience completely missed that.<br><br>With that said, does showing every facet of combat down to the lowest detail of the invasion help? No it does not. The episode was setting up everything for the conquest inside the gate instead of trying to impress first time viewers who might be 12 years old since they need gore and action to really be immersed like the retards they are. Pacing would suffer a lot because they're trying to build the base of the premise of the show, yet you middle 20s nerds want more gore just because you'll feel the levity of the situation. What, you can't feel it through context clues? You can't understand if you're not explicitly shown?<br><br>Then I feel sorry for you for not ever knowing if a vagina exists since you nerds never seen one personally in your life.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le wyvern meme </br>  <br>Complaining about complaints you didn't even comprehend is idiocy. Stop with your shitty baits.</br>  <br>It went so well until you started throwing out insults.</br>  <br>He's a trained ranger so he's not exactly an average soldier. His career is almost entirely right person at the right time though yeah. It's not like success is handed to him, he just kinda does what he thinks is right and it usually works out for him.</br>  <br>If they were Gate dragons they would have suffer much more, animeonlyfag</br>  <br>The dragonriders use Wyverns though. Actual dragons in the series are much, much larger.</br>  <br> The anime did a terrible job at explaining that he was already a soldier. <br>The anime tried to pull this useless tactic of surprising you that his job was being a soldier which was why it wasn't mentioned outright at first.</br></br>  <br>It does not have any meaning to use Type-10 against an enemy, which's civilization level is same as the Middle Ages. The old equipment is rather effective.</br>  <br>This ain't reddit. Go back there if you can't handle the heat kid.</br>  <br>Yeah but it's pointless since as has been said in the thread already, the OP shows that he's a soldier anyway.</br>  I liked the toned down gore.<br>I'm also hoping, if they get that far, that they cut out the rape scenes. <br>It adds nothing, it's just a shitty plot device to make you 'hate' the big bad. If you can't come up with any other way to make me dislike the baddies other then 'lol rape' then you are a hack writer and in the wrong business. <br><br>The only thing I disliked was the blue haired mages character design, what the fuck ? She's a moe blog now? She was more of a stern kuudere in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  First episode didn't realy show why Itami become a "Hero", in the manga he tell the police to evacuate the citizens to the palace and organize with the police a defense line .  <br>You mean you read everything until the end? Because the insult was at the end.</br>  <br>The only thing there is to comprehend is you came to the thread purely to shitpost. You probably didn't even watch the episode.</br>  <br>It wouldn't have been so bad if they dropped some hints as to his military profession but they just leaned so damn hard on the otaku that when shit went down it just seemed weird when he started trying to be competent.</br>  <br>Gate makes a clear distinction.</br>  <br>Trying way too hard.<br><br><br>He seemed like he had some good points early on so yeah I did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the manga the Japanese intelligence guy really hammered in the point that Itami was pretty bad. He graduated officer training at the bottom of his class and only made it through ranger training by keeping his head low and depending on his comrades.</br>  <br> I liked the toned down gore. </br>  <br>The rape and slavery is there to show how different their world is from ours, not just for pure shock value.</br>  <br> Stop doing things I don't like and find offensive  <br>Keep Crying Bitch Nigga</br></br>  <br>The intelligence guy practically exists to talk shit on Itami though. He's not exactly a non-biased source.</br>  <br>But rape is just as, if not more common in Japan</br>  <br> And after Itami's subordinates went out of earshot, saluted Itami and said that he respected him for playing the slacker among the hardworkers. <br>He's hyper competent he just doesn't show it in an obvious way.</br></br>  <br>Considering the toned down gore is a byproduct of trying to appeal to a larger preteen audience, there is literally no way that the rapes will stay.</br>  <br> I liked the toned down gore. <br>No. The whole theme is military and war. People die when they are killed and they are killed all the time in war. You can't have war without violence.<br> I'm also hoping, if they get that far, that they cut out the rape scenes.  <br>Yes. That's just an awful plot tool to establish an objectively evil character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true, just this morning I saw a girl getting raped on my way to work.</br>  <br><br> Then I feel sorry for you for not ever knowing if a vagina exists since you nerds never seen one personally in your life. <br>3DPD is called pig disgusting for a reason. Go back to your normalfag site.</br></br></br>  With 2 cours, will they get to the prince bringing in Noriko?<br>It's a pretty moving scene with the analogies to taking the offspring from a lion. Only part where NIPPON STRONG isn't grating.</br>  <br>I know right? It's the absolutely worst, not enough men around.</br>  I'm neutral to the toned-down gore. It doesn't really matter to me, since it's just something I'll see at the beginning and not matter anymore afterwards.<br><br>For the succeeding fights though especially Italica, I better see slain humans and demihumans.</br></br>  <br>First episode covered 30 pages of the first chapter.<br>I imagine episode 2 will finish chapter 1.<br>There is a LOT of filler, I expect the TV series will end after the arc where Rori kills all the americans.</br></br></br>  Look you might think the gore is a bit on the nose but seriously I would never have read GATE in the first place if it weren't for the catharsis of millions of roman soldiers being exploded by attack helicopters, and now that I think further on it, I may not actually have cause to watch the anime without it either. The personal drama in Gate is a far cry from being able to carry a series. As is the plot even, unless it was executed better.<br><br>This is a series that may as well only exist to set up fuggen sweet battles, and failing to depict said sweet battles in a way that is visceral, or for that matter coherent (See the other issues with episode 1 relating to Itami not actually doing anything useful) is basically a failure of premise for the show.</br></br>  <br> NIPPON STRONG <br>Ultimate humanitarian good guys who will always find a way to help those in need.</br></br>  <br>No he said something like <br>even thought everyone think he's lazy and a good for nothing, he can't get so far only through luck.<br>In the manga and LN there wasn't any time where he was a bad soldier.</br></br></br>  <br> It adds nothing, <br>It's impossible to take your post seriously. This is a visual medium. 0/10, and why did you put a space before your question mark?</br></br>  <br>A switch that's set on a hair trigger and can accidentally be set off at any time by the most mundane things. It's a fairly big problem with US forces. Want to PSTD a US Soldier? Leave a bunch of trash lying around and watch as they try not to freak out because their brain automatically assumes everything is a bomb.<br><br>Of course JSDF isn't experienced in actual combat so this probably doesn't apply to them.</br></br></br>  <br> He got his position and prestige through coincidences <br>Oh, so like actual military? The only way you'll get through promotion boards at higher levels is save the earth or suck an inhuman amount of dick.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't he also imply that Itami plays the role of the friendly slacker to keep morale up?</br>  <br><br>Interesting, that kind of lowers my respect for the writing then.<br>It really is just a power fantasy for Japanese otakus then.</br></br></br>  I love the American butthurt this series provides.<br>Feed me more of your tears, patriots. <br><br>Cant wait for the JSDF to out play and kill all the chink and murrican soldiers.</br></br></br>  <br>that and to make it easier to approach and talk to him. Which works, he pretty much gets the repuation amongst the gate-world people as the guy to talk to if they have a problem they think the JSDF can help with.</br>  <br>Interesting, I didn't know Japanese otakus liked fantasizing as someone working for their country's military.</br>  <br>I think it's more "it doesn't really matter what your hobby is, a soldier is a soldier."</br>  <br>that was the thousand year loli though.</br>  Yeah this was a very weak first ep. Are the nips not allowed to show blood anymore cause I assumed it would be far more bloody  ITT: Sad autists complaining about every show while bathing in their own shit filled diaper.<br><br>I swear you guys have no friends because you always ruin shit with your negative attitudes.</br></br>  <br>The drama with the little girl was unneeded, bad rythm focused too much on Itami's otaku antics and not the crisis itself. <br>Bullshit vision of the main girls in a desperate attempt to build hype, wich was once again unnecessary. <br>Uniform change, time skips all over the place.<br>And why are they so shy with the violence ? Military and warfare are among the main themes of this work, if they try to censor everything it's only going to look lame.<br><br>It was really bad, I wish they focused more the gate's appearance and their discovery of the world beyond it rather than fatherless loli and "muh doujinshi", we understood that Itami was an otaku the first time, right at the beginning, there is no point in rubbing it in our face during the whole fucking episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But its subtly mentioned at the start.<br>Why so salty?</br></br>  <br> Aww, boo bloo /a/ hates AOTS </br>  So how do officer ranks work in Japan, because in order to get promoted to 2nd LT you'd have to have been a Master Sgt/ Sgt Major or something and get selected for OCS, which by that point you probably wouldn't even WANT to do, unless it's like the Navy and he was an Insign for like ten years or something. I'm just really confused as to how he jumped into an officer rank, because I'm assuming he wasn't before.  <br>I'm not, I got it just fine, but if this many people didn't then they clearly did something wrong with how they presented it.</br>  Noticed this when browsing manga. <br><br>Tell, are there any more wyvern ridding winged hussars in this?</br></br>  <br>What about that was salty?</br>  Which GATE would you penetrate, /a/?  <br>Kurwa.</br>  <br>The first half of the show was establishing Itami's background and deeds together with the invasion.<br><br>The second half was Japan seeking approval from its people to send soldiers through the gate as well as preparing all the needed equipment and logistics for the mission.<br><br>It's really not bad. Better have a solid foundation for the show than to go your way and get countless flashbacks to why they did it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hard so say. That elf does things to my dick but im also a lolicon.</br>  It's like none of you read the pre-release press interviews.<br>It was already stated that the violence was going to be toned down and there would be a greater focus on erotic fan-service. The elf's VA confirmed there was even going to be a beach episode which she found 'embarrassing' to work on. <br><br>And guess what, I am okay with this. Why would I want to watch the same story I have already read when I can get original content of the characters I love doing cute things? <br><br>I look forward to this show pandering to my desires, whilst I continue to read the manga for the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ja pierdole.</br>  <br>I'm here to satisfy my military boner, not my waifu boner.</br>  <br>Manga Rori</br>  <br>Yeah about the girls, who the fuck are those two supposed to be ? It's been a long time since I read the manga, but damn where is the big-breasted rambo chick ?</br>  <br>They could easily get past there if they skip unimportant parts and go with quick pacing. It's not clear whether this episode is the pace they're aiming for or whether they just wanted to end on the cliffhanger, though.<br><br>Looking back at the manga version, they really did cut out a lot more of the invasion than I remembered.</br></br></br>  <br>He was already meant to be second lieutenant . After the invasion he was supposed to be promoted to first lieutenant but anime changed it.<br><br>He has done a lot of training.</br></br></br>  <br> Beach episode. <br><br>Dropped, unless they got GOOD mermaids.</br></br></br>  <br>Ne he deosn't play it, he IS a friendly slacker but he tells his surperior that every team need someone play this role to increase the hardwork of others.<br><br>You guys seems not to understand his character and to be honest the manga and the first episode didn't realy show it.<br>Even thought he is lazy they didn't said he is bad only that he is "mediocre" and "barely accepted", he doesn't do anything more than necessary and to pass.<br>The secret agency guy knows Itami doesn't come so far with luck alone when Itami said he was from the PSIA.<br>Itami isn't a super soldier but he still have talents that make him a good soldier like how he avoids danger and make plans how to kill the dragons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Originally, all of them. With the shows new SAO art style, I'm not sure id be interested in any of them.</br>  <br>No no, I think this show might be interesting, however my AOTY will be monster girls son.<br><br>You guys are always salty about a lot. But if you talk shit about monmusume I will fgt you 1v1 IRL.</br></br></br>  <br>Right there. In the middle.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Fucking gate up to be loli-shoujo shit really marks the end of animated features as we know it.</br>  <br>Mermaids?</br>  <br>Probably the latter. They could have achieved the same ending with different content too.</br>  <br> original content of the characters I love doing cute things <br>They're barely even the same characters at this point.</br></br>  <br>Okayado is a hack writer who doesn't know how to create conflict worth shit and just keeps adding new shitty characters and more "hilarious" harem antics that we've seen billions of fucking times before yet people automatically give it a free pass because "muh monster grills".<br><br>Also, his art is shit and the VAs are absolute garbage for the adaption.</br></br></br>  <br> Okayado is a hack writer who doesn't know how to create conflict worth shit <br>Ok<br><br> and just keeps adding new shitty characters and more "hilarious" harem antics that we've seen billions of fucking times before yet people automatically give it a free pass because "muh monster grills". <br>But I like this.<br><br> Also, his art is shit and the VAs are absolute garbage for the adaption. <br>The art is great and the VA's sound great.<br><br>Also, my opinion weighs more then yours because I am a supercool guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, that's not her.<br> If it is, Im dropping this shit. <br><br><br>People like it for the hot guns on fantasy action.<br>Cutting on the violence and fights to add pointless drama with pointless characters is fucking stupid.<br>The design changes is even more stupid. And Im okay with erotic fan-service, but a beach episode ? Really ? Why do they need to step so low ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> People like it for the hot guns on fantasy action. <br>Stop projecting<br>I like it for the cute girls and harem antics, I don't give a shit about tanks or guns.</br></br></br>  <br>Who else would it be? Short, with short hair and big boobs next to a taller girl with long black hair. It has to be her.<br><br>I hate it but I can't think of anyone else it would be.</br></br></br>  Character designs are horrendous. geez  <br>Okay that makes sense. I don't know why they would change that...</br>  <br>It's a comedy series based on 12 brothers each with a different monster girlfriend. Of course with the serialization of the work certain things were changed like making it a harem. There's also frequent polls on which girl to add next. Not saying that there shouldn't be conflict(there is) but it's not going to be what you expect or even want and honestly most of that shit in harem series are terribly executed. Artstyle is subjective.<br><br>And yes, his free pass is monster girls because its becoming mainstream which is a horrible thing.</br></br></br>  <br>The "luring sailors to their deaths" mermaids.</br>  <br>The beach is a sidestory.</br>  <br>He is 33, so he's had enough time to get established as a careerist.</br>  <br> negative attitudes <br>It's hard to be positive when watching poor quality shows.</br></br>  <br>Those are sirens.</br>  <br>And I like it for the military wank which is far less prevalent than a harem anime.<br><br>It's understandable to feel a little cheated when a big presence of the source is turned into a background theme.</br></br></br>  <br>Gothloli's tight little gate is the best gate. The elf is only good for mindbreaking.</br>  <br>Aren't in some mythos they're fucking ugly as sin?</br>  <br> AOTY will be monster girls <br>The manga is already a shitty TLR clone with monster girls as the main gimmick.</br></br>  <br>Yeah well I'm here for the military boner. I want guns, tanks, and soldiers doing soldier things with cute girls on the side.</br>  I just want to see 1000 knights get rekt by an attack helicopter tbh  <br>Yes, something akin to harpies.</br>  <br>In some, in others they can be quite beautiful.</br>  <br>No, sirens are plants that screams when you pull them.</br>  Hibike Euphonium Season 2 Confirmed<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/655<wbr>17</wbr></br></br>  Nakamura is Hibike`s producer <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=16973</wbr></br></br>  <br>Is this legit? I can't into moon. Can anyone confirm this?</br>  Since Pony Canyon is willing to do S2, its question of time.  <br>He only said „ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ though.</br>  <br>It just says Nakamura said he wants to do S2.<br><br>Hardly a confirmation.</br></br></br>  It's just the producer saying that he'd like to at Anime Expo. We already knew that.  <br>Its legit, but does not mean its in production. Just means Pony Canyon (one of Producers, doing all music publishing for it and stuff), is willing to go for another season. So its up to KyoAni if they`ll want it (which they likely will).</br>  <br>Dreams don't come true unless you wish them out loud.</br>  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN, you're truly the patron saint of second seasons.  <br>Thanks god</br>  <br>If the producer wants another season and knowing KyoAni wanted to do it in the first place I'm now hopeful for it to happen. Inshallah before Winter 2016.</br>    <br>Its just one of 3 producers (the one responsible for music sales). Shirobako should have taught you its not that easy.</br>  <br>But anon I can't get enough of the Kumiko. I really want to belive a 24 episode season 2 is happening. And that's the announcement they're having next KyoAniDo event.</br>  <br>It's obvious that there will be a second season. I doubt they'll confirm anything anytime soon though.</br>  Euphonium was AOTS no contest, so I'm hoping for more.  Looks like Euphonium might be AOTS for another season.  Please make it 2 cours and 1 movie as a finale  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN  <br>It's not confirmed. Learn 2 Moon before you post threads like this you tard.</br>  <br>Thank you based oboe-chan.</br>  <br>the quads demand s2</br>  Hibike feels like the kind of show kyoani typically does 2nd seasons for.  Wheres the KyoAnus sticky?<br><br>Oh wait , there has never been one.<br><br>KEKkai Sensen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You fucking SHIT OP, My hopes and dreams gone in a instant.</br></br>  <br>Not gone, just unconfirmed.<br>Probably not even decided by kyoani yet.</br></br>  Here's the video.<br>http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6612<wbr>3452</wbr></br>  Hell yeah  <br> Minute 26 <br> Some feminist bitch complaining about male dominated band clubs <br> Didn't even ask a question <br><br>Holy fuck America get your bitches on a leash already.</br></br></br></br></br>   clickbait the OP <br><br>Do you have a job at Sankakucomplex?</br></br>  Didn't the anime sold like shit?   „ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ <br><br>OBOE-CHAN WILL SAVE US.<br><br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni standards, kind of, but sales-wise it did okay. 6k isn't really impressive but many anime can only dream of such sales.<br><br><br>If only. The world needs more Hazuki.</br></br></br></br>  And so the baiting continues.  <br>Quads confirmed S2</br>  How would you improve season 2 to make it sell even better? I found the show boring until episode 5.  <br>Make it focus either exclusively on het or yuri. Don't make the show row on two rivers.</br>  <br><br>More marching band too.</br></br>  ÂêçÂâçÔºöÂêçÁÑ°„Åó„Åï„ÇìÊäïÁ®øÊó•Ôºö2015Âπ¥01Êúà01Êó•<br> <br>4ch„Åß„ÇÇË®Ä„Å£„Å¶„Åü„ÇÑ„Å§„ÅÑ„Åü„Çè<br>„Åù„Çä„ÇÉ„ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ„Å†„Çç„ÅÜ„Å≠<br><br>What does that jap say about us?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> okay, we will try. </br></br>  <br> THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN </br>  <br>I've literally never heard that idiom before.</br>  <br>Neither will happen.<br><br>Shuichi has even less presence in volume 2 than he has in volume 1.<br>Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei.<br><br>If they wanted to give a conclusive romance ending, they would either need to increase Shuichi's screen time and advance the romantic plot faster, or they would need to drop Reina's love for Taki-Sensei. And since they're deliberately making it ambiguous to mess with fans, they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 1's romantic aspirations were nil. The western viewerbase really wanted to make it a horserace with winners and losers, and the show never tried to do that. Now if they stick to the novels going forward, it will be a singularly developed romantic relationship and no one will get btfo except shipping faggots.</br>  <br> It's obvious that there will be a second season </br>  <br>I'd rather poast a BuK</br>  <br>it was also cheap to produce<br><br>didn't KnK sell even less while also being expensive as fuck to animate?<br>and it still got two movies god damn</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Who gives a shit about romance in the first place?<br><br>all I want is pic related and some good fucking drama</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well. <br><br>God the threads are gonna even be more shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who gives a shit about romance in the first place? <br><br>Probably 90% of the people watch this show.</br></br></br>  <br> Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei. <br><br>Let's not forget that most of her presence even in this season was anime-original. I doubt they're going to double back on that especially now she's gotten popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it feels good to be part of the 10% that doesn't<br>I love the themes, the music ad characters<br><br>don't really care who ends up with whom</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair no one will if some fags didn't ship and derail the thread with their delusion on the first place.</br>  <br><br>No shitstorm will happen if Kyoani stops putting fuel into the fire. I like how they made Reina relevant early in the story, but the obnoxious yuri pandering needs to stop if they don't plan on yuri-end.</br></br>  <br>Good, good.</br>  <br>That's true, they'll probably add more anime original scenes in season 2, like they did in season 1.<br><br>But the thing is, adding Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait". It was done because Reina is the second most important character in this part of the story, right after Kumiko.<br><br>Season/volume 1 is about Kumiko and Reina. Kumiko experiences a lot of character growth because of Reina - she learns to stand up for herself, she realizes she loves her euphonium, she realizes she also wants to become special. All of this happened directly because of Reina. So giving Reina more screen time in the first half of the anime where she had almost none made sense since it made the pacing of the story better and the episode 8 scene didn't come out of nowhere.<br><br>Season/volume 2 is about Asuka, Oboe-chan, and Oboe-chan's friend. Even Kumiko isn't a really important character here, and all Reina scenes are basically "muh Taki". If they were going to add strong yuri scenes like the ones from episode 8 or episode 11, Kyoani would have completely new, important plot points, and not just change things up like they did with e.g. second audition.<br><br>The only way I can imagine Reina playing an important role in season 2 if they decide to include an anime original plot about her slowly getting over Taki-Sensei. But I don't believe Kyoani would do something drastic, especially considering they added even more anime original scenes focusing on Reina's obsession with Taki-Sensei in season one than there were in volume one of the novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait" <br><br>Changing a cheek poke to a finger slide down towards lip isn't bait? And the other 'super intimate' moments in the show? Please this is Kyoani we're talking here. You wish it wasn't yuri bait, but it is.</br></br></br></br>   mfw finally we couldn't know why Asuka was acting weird   <br>It gets explained later in the story, S1 didn't get that far. Go check the archive, spoileranon explained it.</br>  Do you watch anime on windows or Mac?   not using glorious gentoo   <br> he fell for the gentoo meme </br>  <br>Television</br>  <br>On a monitor.</br>  <br>I watch on ios through anime freak.</br>  So Rakudai has just been confirmed for October airing same as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. How can they allow carbon copies like this to exist in the same season?   Ripped tights. <br>Yeah I'm choosing right.</br>  MC in both walks in on girl changing at the very start.  <br>Both FeMCs are tsundere fire sword wielding girls, who proceed to fight MCs to kill after he seeing him changing.</br>  <br><br>Yep, I'm avoiding.</br></br>  Both MCs are special snowflake sword wielding with best swords kills faggots, have no magic abilities like the usual and next to no mana. Have a limit on their powers than they can undo for about 1-5mins that makes them god teir.  MC and FeMC becomes partners<br>School tournaments<br>Battle shounen <br><br>I read though all that's translated of both of these and don't get why this happens.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Left has better girls.</br>  Insest is bad, hopefully they'll get this out of the anime.   be retard shonen MC <br> fight with tsundere girlfriend your whole life <br> die <br> reincarnate as other retard shonen MC <br> do it all over again </br></br></br></br>  So at the end of the day, all I have to work with is character designs?<br><br>Since right looks hotter. I guess I'll pick that instead.  Oh who am I kidding? I'm going to pick both up anyway. </br></br>  <br>Essentially Work Break?<br>MC is basically reincarnated as a retarded shounen MC that fights with tsundere girl friend and it was the same in his previous incarnations as well, literally.</br></br>  <br>Rakudai has a better overall main girl and actually has them kiss.</br>  <br> So at the end of the day, all I have to work with is character designs? <br><br>You have manga<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/gakus<wbr>en-toshi-asterisk-r8058<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/rakud<wbr>ai-kishi-no-eiyuutan-r11615<br><br>You have light novels<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Gakusen_Toshi_Aster<wbr>isk<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Rakudai_Kishi_no_Ei<wbr>yuutan<br><br>You have Asterisk City's PV <br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>lwceg<br> retarded naruto run at the end. <br>No animated PV for Rakudai yet.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Both FeMCs are tsundere fire sword wielding girls <br><br>You forgot to add they both are foreign country princesses.</br></br></br>  <br>Both MCs are also the lowest rank and fight the highest rank in their respective school early on and win too.</br>  <br> Rakudai has a better overall main girl <br>Yeah... but no... Asterisk City's FeMC is better and more nobel.</br></br>  <br>Dude, don't insult shonen MCs.<br>Harem MC are their own thing</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry you have shit taste. I like the fact that Rakudai's main girl actually pervs out a bit on HIM instead of going full fucking violence all the time.</br>  <br> full fucking violence all the time. <br>Nobody actually hits the MC for comedic violence in AC though. There is some shouting but thats about it.</br></br>  <br>I just like the fact that Rakudai has the girl being the pursuer. It's refreshing.</br>  Do we really need to shitfling amongst one another as to what generic magical academy harem LN is better? What does it matter?<br>If you're going to watch one then you might as well watch the other one as well.</br>  I know it's not grea...<br>It's bad. But how exactly? And how much more so than the other two? Thoughts?</br>  <br> And how much more so than the other two? <br>Not much actually.</br></br>  Everything after Tobi's reveal.<br><br>Holy fuck did they drop the ball</br></br>  Shounen are shit get over it.  You can't expect a weekly serialized battle shounen to be good for 16 years.    <br>Which reveal?<br>That he is the puller of the strings or that he is Obito?</br></br>  <br>So... I don't have to give in to my friends and try to get into them? Whew.<br><br>No, I mean<br><br>Yes, this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The reveal itself was good, but the rest of the war arc after it was a complete fucking clusterfuck, and the constant Rin spouting made him look like a pedophile.</br>  <br>But there wasn't anything special about it. They just sort of showed it and enlarged the dialogue and shit.</br>  <br> I know it's not grea... <br>Why are you typing like that?<br>Sage and report.</br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah i missed out the 't'<br>t<br>there, you happy?</br></br></br>  <br>m8 just announcing who Tobi was was glorious. I remember that day, all the asshurt, laughs, and so on. It was beautiful. Fuck it even trended.</br>  <br>Not him but I agree, you should fuck off.</br>  <br>yeah you're right. I remember one of my friends getting all up in my face like "I told you i figured it out like a million chapters ago".<br>But i'm just saying. It didn't do much to set itself apart by doing it in a, i dunno, different way?<br>but your point still holds.</br></br></br>  <br>The editors made Kishimoto write in Sasuke which ruined the entire series. JIraya's death was retarded.Too much build up to stuff everyone knew was going to happen.<br>Gaiden is good though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah shit like this is what im talking about.<br>Also, if i may, Naruto becoming a total 'chosen one', when he was supposed to be just a kid working hard to get to his goals.</br></br>  <br>J-man's death was one of the best moments in the series. The whole Pain arc was good until the very end.</br>  <br>I disagree. Jiraiya was built up to be THE GUY, and he was killed off how? I don't even remember. It was him getting blindsided or something.<br>The point is, he was supposed to be sent off with a lot of manly tears and Naruto getting all pissed off and crap. I'll admit the whole death scene was pretty realistic, but it felt out of place in the midst of all those over the top deaths.</br></br>  <br>The aftermath ruined any impact his death had. Pain could literally resurrect everyone EXCEPT for him, it just left me with an awful taste in my mouth.</br>  <br>his body was literally miles under the ocean.</br>  it should have ended with obito defeat without madara being able to fully resurrect<br><br>and the constant that always fucked up the series was the whole friendship faggotry bullshit <br>it always annoyed the living shit outta me</br></br></br>  <br>That explanation would make sense if Pain's actual ability to resurrect people made any sense.</br>  <br>But dint Nagato sacrifice himself? So how did he get back?</br>  <br><br>I'm confused.</br></br>  <br>the manga had ups and downs but I think that is still readable up to the clash with Pain.<br><br>Naruto VS Pain was the last part that I really liked and after that the manga gets worse without end, until the final war that was horrible.<br><br>I dont like the Gaiden chp, but i like Narudad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. End of story</br>  <br>Everything after the wars starts goes from bland to completely mind numbingly tedious, boring, awful, and all the other bad synonyms.</br>  why did neji have to die like such a bitch  <br>this is literally what happened. He went out with manly tears, and Naruto getting all mad.</br>  Pain had too much of the whiny teenage bullcrap.<br><br>Just watch the Chuunin exams and skip everything else.</br></br>  Jiraiya's death was a great moment. It was a mentor, it was predictable that it would end like this.  MOD !!!!!!!!!!!!  jiraiya's death was good , if you want to read a manga with no death go to read one pisse . Jiraiya did his job , and kishi gives him a good death .<br><br> OP : naruto become shit when nagato brings everyone back to life .</br></br>  <br> Just watch Hunter x Hunter and skip everything else </br>    <br><br>I really don't know what you saw there, but to me it was kind of uneventful. I liked how Naruto got all depressed afterwards, and Shikamaru comforting him. But not as much to forget that Naruto's surrogate dad actually got kind of silently written off. According to me of course.</br></br>  <br>  naruto become shit when nagato brings everyone back to life . <br><br>yes, that was a bad move. Rather, Do not kill all those people, but overall it was the swan song of the manga.</br></br></br>  <br> I really don't know what you saw there <br><br>Mentor, in all stories, used to guide the hero.<br><br>It is compulsory in all good stories that they die. why? because a mentor is one who gives advice and if it remains on the scene, the hero can continue to rely on him. This why mentors die, it serves to force the hero to rely on himself and what he has learned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh I was okay with it, well Kakashi and Hinata at least.</br>  <br>I actually liked how the reveal and his subsequent flashback were handled.<br>He and Madara cooperating but scheming against each other also set a good dynamic for what then we believed was going to be the final arc.<br><br>The problem was literally everything else that came after it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One Piece <br> Jojo <br> HxH (if it counts despite being on hiatus most of the time) <br><br>You have to be either a good writer or a good long term planner to pull off a long running series, Kishi is neither.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh. I wanted to talk Naruto because I watched it with a lot of devotion years ago. And when I watch it now and read the manga, I kind of feel embarassed about the whole thing.<br>I've heard people talk really highly of HxH, I thought it was just another shonen with a really strange looking MC that's about friendship and love. Turns out it isnt. Is it better than FMA or FMA:B?</br></br>  <br>Togashi is a good writer and Oda a long term planner, but let's be sincere here, Araki also lacks both skills, yet somehow makes things work out fine. This only makes Kishimoto's case worse.</br>  <br>Yeah i think i get that. It's just the sudden tone shift of the series from ridiculosly overblown hero moments and shit to a grim and low-key death. The staple flashback is the only thing that seemed to fit.<br>Yeah and then it bounces back to being very upbeat very soon.</br></br>  <br>There was a shit ton of grim deaths in Naruto. Ever since part one. Hiruzen, Itachi, Asuma, Kisame, etc</br>  <br>Yeah but werent each one of them preceded by a shit ton of epic blow-stuff-uppy megajutsu fights?</br>  are any of the movies other than the last and road to ninja worth watching?  <br>Sorry, we'll go make more Fate and Dragon Ball threads instead.</br>  <br>Fair point, but Araki is blessed with a lot of creativity and was smart enough to structure the series in a way that keeps it pretty fresh.</br>  <br> Oda a long term planner, <br><br>unpopular opinion , and you can prerare your meme bait if you want, but I HATE literally the artistic evolution of Oda. I hate his confusing way to portray the pages of his manga, i hate his abuse of "close-ups face" of the characters for everything . I hate the banality of his direction for the action scenes. I hate the overabundance of balloon. This page sums up everything wrong that Oda became.<br><br>I really liked his style in the beginning, now has become illegible and confusing as well as terribly static.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you go guy</br>  <br>J Mans fight was the same.</br>  <br>What? I may have to rewatch it, now. But I don't remember him being extraordinarily awetastic though.</br>  <br>literally everything after chuuni exams</br>  <br>Madara and Guy were gonna save it, but all those bullshit asspulls didn't let them</br>  <br>I don't really hate it, but I do prefer his art and page organization from CP9 and before than how it is now.</br>  <br>Yeah Guy, right? I kind of cried when he said his springtime of youth had ended. Best use of a character thats been mostly comic relief for what 700 chapters?</br>  <br>It's funny because if anyone should have died in a blaze of glory during that entire clusterfuck of an ending, it was him.<br><br>Instead, Neiji bit the bullet in the most contrived, anti-climatic way possible because forced drama demanded it, and it just so happened Naruto had yet to become Ninja Jesus to save his ass the way he saved Guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah whats up with that anyway? He says he can do "anything". And he brings back people from the dead and whatnot.<br>Why did it have to be so stupid? No im really asking why.</br></br>  <br>It's Kishimoto, man. He was literally rolling with it at that point.</br>  <br>With what a die and a cheatsheet for plot?</br>  <br>Has he got anything else that's good? Anywhere he gets it right? Anything you recommend?</br>  <br>Hinata didn't actually die though, just horribly wounded.</br>  <br>pissed me the fuck off</br>  <br>What, that she didn't die? Fuck you she's best girl.<br><br>That said, everyone else who died in the Pain arc should have stayed dead. I was shocked to see Kakashi go, and after there wasn't an asspull an episode or two later I honestly believed he was gone. He even had that little afterlife scene where he was talking with his dad. Shit was touching, and then it was all invalidated.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I just hate her don't mind me I just do.<br>But Kakashi going had to happen sometime. Instead Jiraiya takes his place. I was shocked too to see Kakashi near the fire just chillin with his dad and shit, but I quickly convinced myself that hell come back for a short round of ass whooping and then die for good. Well i guess he did come back.</br></br>  <br>When the pen first touched the paper.</br>  <br>okay im gonna need something better than that to work with.</br>  <br>When Kishi first had the idea to draw a manga about ninjas with magic eyes.</br>  <br>Well for me it jumps the shark at Naruto being everything Kishimoto was trying to tell us he wasn't. He's a little shitter who's going to become the Hokage through sheer will and determination only he's ninja Jesus.<br><br>And then there's the whole mess of Shitpudding and what Akatsuki's ambition was. Can you explain to me in one line what their goal was and then, in another, how the story went about portraying their actions of said goal? Because I sure as fuck can't.<br><br>Then there's the usual "It's popular so it's shit"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>whoa ninjas wid magic eyes except NOT<br>His first idea was something like a wizardry or sorcery manga. And he slowly kind of stopped with the crystal balls and all that.<br><br>Yeah not in a single line just like you cannot sum up Les Miserables in a single line jk lol</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah not in a single line just like you cannot sum up Les Miserables in a single line jk lol <br>Ayyy lmao<br><br>Although you do bring up another thing that makes Naruto bad, the fanbase. You asked me to explain to you my gripes with the series and when I do you completely dodge them.</br></br></br></br>    <br>JoJo doesn't count since it changes settings and characters every part, and even then it has it's problems.</br>  Madara's Wild Ride was almost a redeeming point in the series, had Kishi devised a way for Nardo and the Sauce to beat him in a Jojo-esque way that is kinda sorta convincing and just barely plausible.<br><br>Of course, he decided to take the pussy way out and just write Madara out, and then throw in LE EPIC FINAL NARDU VS SAUCE FINAL BATTEL XD.</br></br>  <br>I f you think about it the concept was shit from the very beggining. The fact that it was shounen didn't help the case. But even if we disregard that, I would say that the manga turned complete shit after the revival of the vilage in the Pain arc. Call me edgy, but the fact that Naruto was a manga where people used to die, moreover people who you cared about in a certain way, was one of the strongest points of the series. The problem is that at the end Kishi got scared and decided not to change status quo. The result was a confusion.<br> He made a terrible clusterfuck and wasn't able to deal with it. There were dozens of character with their own plot line which Kishi neither have time nor desire to deal. Because of that, in my opinion, we recieved abssolutely safe ending which keept the status quo.</br></br>  <br>Too bad it's a money maker for JUMP and they want to milk it.</br>  <br>Hey man, I dint intend no offense. Im not exactly a Naruto fan either, but it was a pretty huge part of my life when i was younger. So I just wanted some help to put my feelings in the right place. I'm sorry if it seemed like something else.</br>  <br>Gotta raise the stakes and show that shit got real but the villain is already powerful as fuck so we gotta make the villain kill someone not important.</br>  <br><br>Sauce leaving the village basically killed all of the potential for cool stuff to happen. There were some good moments here and there, but it never really got back on track</br></br>  <br>Remove all Uchiha except Itachi, Madara and Shisui.<br>No Stupid fuck Kaguya which could have litteraly been made up within the final few months and pretended it was all planned.<br>More Ninjutsu and Ninja stuff then wizard fireballs.<br>Naruto learning more then just shadow clones and Rasengan<br>Kakashi using more Justu then just Raikiri and being 'the coppy ninja' just like his 1st Zabuza fight showed (Did he coppy any actual Jutsu after that fight? or was it all pre coppied)<br>Sasuke can stay, but only if turned Fem. and with that have Sakura become Bi to make shit interesting and give her a character<br>i could go on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Sharingan stopped being about copying jutsus as soon as the Mangekyo Sharingan was introduced, which was when Itachi first came back to Konoha with Kisame. Soon as that happened, the series went full DBZ I HAVE GREATER POWER THAN YOU mode.</br>  <br>exactly.<br>asside from....the Water wave and water dragon jutstu. not a single other one was coppied using Sharingan</br></br>  <br> I f you think about it the concept was shit from the very beggining. <br>Really? I kinda like underdog stories where the MC just has to go through life with pure willpower, show everyone that he isn't just another piece of shit and not have anything handed out to him. The latter is where kishi failed.</br></br>  <br>The concept of magic ninjas</br>  <br>#1 - Um, I can understand the Sasuke hate, but what about Obito, the kid version?<br>#2 - Yeah, I agree.<br>#3 - Wasn't Ninjutsu literally ABOUT wizard fireballs?<br>#4 - Yeah, I have a bad feeling he(Kishimoto) wouldn't be able to handle even more techniques.<br>#5 - I kind of liked that Kakaashi was somewhat of a few-tricks pony. It made me actually think about how he was going to deal with situations, unlike Sasuke or someone, who can just Eye ex Machina out of any shit they find themselves in. Though doesn't help that Kakashi himself joined the club later.<br>#6 - lolwut<br>#7 - I'm really intrigued by #6, please do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sausage did copy Lee's Taijutsu due to Kakashi copying it himself. That's about the extent of it. Right after that came Itachi's invasion, and thus the total drop of the Sharingan's original purpose.</br>  <br>or the 3rd Hokage. said to have mastered 1000 jutsu. litteraly only used a fireball and mud wall. then just blasts in the shinobi war. Which didn't even make sense to me. as combining 3 elements is supposed to make a Kekkei Genkai, and the only reason Kakashi didnt have one was because it was... too difficult?<br><br>Also how the fuck could no one else learn wood style? Yammato make it sound REALLY simple. earth in one hand, water in the other.</br></br></br>  I'd be more interested in knowing how it's so fucking popular.  <br>Well, as 10-12 years old kid I fucking adore this shit.</br>  <br>You're really questioning the logical consistency of Naruto? I thought it was just agreed that it was just a shitfest of random ideas that somehow tell a barely coherent plot.</br>  <br>As in anime or the plot in entirety?<br> supposedly, CC2 games' story modes are the superior option </br></br>  Still better than Bleach, which is just shit.<br><br>We all loved to hate on Naruto, myself included, because of its fanbase and popularity, but it didn't truly become shit until the last arc, the great shinobi war thing. It just became a massive clusterfuck. Bringing literally everyone back from the dead is awful narrative tool. The power levels went off the chart and shat on the previous 10 years. It became way too predictable and generic. Nothing really made sense. It was just a clusterfuck of shite. Also it really shrank the world, the Naruto world became very small and very shallow. Compare this with the first few arcs where the world felt massive, full of the unknown, with lots of depth.</br></br>  <br>#6 turn Sasuke girl, and you get rid of litteraly every homo overtone and Naruto seemes more justified in wanting to save 'her' other then it seeming Homo. Making Sakura Bi makes it turn into a interesting love triangle, having lesbian elements that are more then 'sisterhood' that her and Ino have.<br>#1 Obito as a kid didn't even make fucking sense, it was supposed to coppy Naruto's Generation and be just like him and Sakura, but it wasn't. the Anime clearly fucking showed that Rin was with him from the start and deeply cared about him, which would have litterly gotten into her pants when she realised how much of a prick Kakashi was and how if it wasn't for him she'd be dead. Kisi FORCED THE FUCK out of her 'liking' Kakashi, when it seemed to be more of an admiration of his skills</br></br>  <br>#1 - Yeah, you're right, although it would make the Uchiha clan a bit less diverse.<br>#6 - lowut<br>#7 when?</br></br></br>  <br>OP asked where it went wrong, i gave my opinion. fuck man, its like you didnt even read the thread</br>  <br>In a sense, it suffered because of its immense popularity and unrealistic expectations of grandness which was never the original intention. Hmmm.</br>  <br>#6 its not fanfiction or anything, its just how i think itd be more interesting. that and itd show an actualy competent Female character other then Granny Chiyo<br>#7? if you mean when did it show the Rin Obito Kakashi stuff? back in the Gaiden bridge shit, and litterly every eppisode of the ninja war. flashbacks through the FUCK</br></br>  <br> Still better than Bleach, which is just shit. <br>Bleach is self-aware shit,Nardo was a highly pretentious nonsensical bullshit.</br></br>  <br>Hey I meant what I said. I actually thought that concentrating on finding plotholes and such on Naruto would be a total wasted effort.</br>  <br>#6 - I do think it would make sense, in a less nonsensical universe. Naruto's characters are so two-dimensional that it's really awesome just watching a clash of pure ideals. I just watch it for the idealistic babble, I think I get off on it even though it's kind of overwrought.<br>#7 as in more ideas you have that would make Naruto better when???</br></br>  <br>Okay, you don't count a ninja who could barely pull off a wind ball in his hand and now can blow up planets changing a setting? Comparing the last arc of Shippuuden to what was before it is like 2 completely different Shonens</br>  <br>Oh, I'll check 'em out. Thanks.</br>  <br>This. I kinda hate that chosen one and child of prophecy bullshit.</br>  <br> Sakura become Bi to make shit interesting and give her a character <br>Turning someone bi gives them character now? Fucking /u/ fags.</br></br>  <br>Naw, it's really good when done right, like in...<br>helpmeouthere</br></br>  <br>idunno, more issues to bitch about maybe.<br>But all shit's tight when done right.</br></br>  <br>Sakura is litteraly only 2 things anyway<br>1.Sasuke<br>2.Healer<br> Does giving someone more character traits give them more character traits <br>Wow anon. fucking wow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's not like other anime have their ninjas be realistic with their KATANA STRIKE FOLDED 1000 TIMES CUT THROUGH THE WORLD AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, I'd kinda count that as ninja magic. And besides everyone agrees that the DBZ energy spam fights are some of the biggest problems naruto had so you have a point.<br><br> Bleach is self aware  <br>Isn't this worse? Supposedly you know what the faults are in your manga but you still keep doing them, like why?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The moment it premiered.</br></br>  <br>They even gave Jiraiya a different sendoff in ultimate ninja storm 2.</br>  <br>But she's also a rival to Ino, bitch to Naruto, a goody-goody student to Kakashi, a dependable subordinate to that one girl with the pig, an exemplary disciple to Tsunade, a daughter to her parents(presumed)...<br>I could go on, anon.</br></br>  <br>Sexual preference isn't a character trait. If you turn Sakura lesbian and sauce into a girl but leave all the rest then absolutely nothing about sakura changes, she's still a massive unlikeable bitch. You'd only turn Naruto into an even bigger idiot for like a dyke.</br>  <br>Really? Is it more rewarding than the anime death? Now I really gotta play this shit.</br>  <br>But when the social backdrop changes it actually works to create a major driving force in the character's thought process.<br>I don't know if I'm making sense, but in Naruto's setting, Sakura being a repressed homosexual could make a lot of difference.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B2C<wbr>WPFJCqfE&amp;t=19m0s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Here it is if you want to see it. It's a little bit more rewarding.<br><br>If the timestamp doesn't work it's at 19 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> KATANA STRIKE FOLDED 1000 TIMES CUT THROUGH THE WORLD AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT <br>I think is's totallt fine as far as ninjas being ninjas and don't fight in open battles and destroy landscapes. Something like most of chunin exam would be fine.</br></br>  After the exams<br><br>First 2 arcs are great. Still shonen shit but a nice read and set up. It just gets weaker and weaker after there (with some good bits) and then just into real dumb</br></br>  <br> Isn't this worse? Supposedly you know what the faults are in your manga but you still keep doing them, like why? <br> faults  <br>Bleach was always about fights with huge swords,stylish appearances,epic reactions and never had any actual plot to begin with.There is nothing to fix,unlike naruto.</br></br></br>  <br>Making her bi means Ino/Sakura when Sasuke ends up with Naruto.</br>  <br>That is just a good plan.</br>  <br> But when the social backdrop changes <br>That's assuming it would. We have no idea how people in the naruto world view gay people because there are none as far as we know. Also making Sakura sexually repressed doesn't excuse her extremely bitchy behaviour, mostly because she already is sexually repressed.</br></br>  <br> Making her bi means Ino/Sakura <br>Ino deserves better though.  I wouldn't mind ino/1010 </br></br>  the problem with Naruto right from the start lay in the fact that the main character was boring, unlikeable, and uninteresting.<br><br>This just wasn't quite as much a big deal when he was still treated as relatively irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Around the time he was learning sage mode Naruto truly became center stage. Everything was about the chosen one. And then you realised you didn't really give a damn about Naruto himself, and it all fell apart.<br><br>It was still bad right from the beginning though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, it's all I ever wanted it to be. Thanks!<br>It totally trumps the manga death, which I just felt was really OOC for the Perv. The thing about the frogs remains the same I suppose?</br></br>  <br> right from the start lay in the fact that the main character was boring, unlikeable, and uninteresting. <br>this isn't a bleach thread<br><br>Seriously I don't like Naruto but he had way more going on than strawberry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh heh I just realized Ichigo meant strawberry.<br>What were they going for with that? I mean not like 'naruto' had something going on for him too though.</br></br>  <br>he has orange hair which is sort of like red.......<br><br>That is the most interesting thing about him which says a lot</br></br></br>  <br>Most of it is the same, plus there's a monologue cutscene afterwards I think. <br><br>The games are probably the best way to experience the story in my opinion, even if they did change some things to make time for the manga to finish.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4qi<wbr>Fchj6BBc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>but they probably won't anymore seeing as how the next installment is gonna cover up to 700.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At it's base, Naruto started out as a coming of age story. He signed up to be a soldier for hire, without really knowing what that meant. The world was supposed to be big and relatively cruel for a shounen, and he had to grow up to meet it halfway. <br><br>But he didn't grow up. The world shrank to meet him. He became the child of destiny, his village was made to be the only one with any importance, he had powers thrown at him without having to actually learn anything or play according to the system everyone else was subject to, and his hard decisions were reduced to "but it'll just work out!" and the villains accepting that. He fell so far from the source concept of stealth and pseudo strategy that the time skip became unsalvageable. <br><br>Kishimoto never had to make the series smart; he just had to make it feel smart. Somewhere along the line he gave up on even that, and it shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah i get your point. But everyone was aware of Sakura's infatuation with Sasuke. Even oblivios Naruto. But if its something that's looked down upon, won't she act much more reserved and morose, than just bitchy?</br>  <br>I like Bleach because of the wild ride Kubo has us all on. <br>Yes, you get the clusterfuck of powers, asspulls, nonsense and such, but because Kubo makes it work in a funny and lighthearted kind of way (at least to me it is like that).<br><br>Ichigo is a bland character, I agree, but for me Ichigo is just the main plot point, the other characters and their wacky schemes (Aizen), make Bleach good. The threads on /a/ are just the icing on the cake when a new chapter releases. Uncovering all the details of Kubo's Wild Ride: The Manga are what I like about Bleach.<br><br>If you just read it for the fights and logical consistency then Bleach will suck ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will they continue with the series with original content, or to milk it?</br>  <br>Yeah, agree with you totally. Especially that last part which I believe is why some people don't like Death Note, even though it was smart ENOUGH.</br>  <br>Naruto himself was pretty likeable at first, or sympathetic at least. But then like you said, everything became about him, and it was just awful. Aside from how he became the centre of the universe plotwise, it was beyond annoying to hear characters constantly singing his praises and sucking his dick because he helped them or changed them or some shit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yCD<wbr>7UYR-ziQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Well I doubt they'll come up with much original content, even if they did make a filler game to bridge the gap between 3 and 4. Though it is Naruto, so they'll probably milk it like DBZ games.</br></br></br>  fuck off<br/>  <br>Well to be honest, he wasn't even a sympathetic character. All scenes that showed his isolation were mirrored by scenes showing his determination. So we kind of see him in an 'it's-all-going-to-be-okay-nothing-<wbr>to-worry-about' light.</wbr></br>  <br> Tits, art style and Aizen are the only thing good about Blarch. Dropped it after they canned Aizen. <br><br>Kishi's wild ride with red herring, cuckoldry and romance tops Kubo ride, for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the DBZ games were fun, even though a bit broken IMO. I hope it turns out that way for Naruto too.</br>  <br>Pherhaps but that's all just assuming. Being gay doesn't necessarily affect your character. The only thing that would maybe change is the fake love confession. I wouldn't see a lesbian do that, but then again I wouldn't except any real girl to do that either.<br><br>In the end Sakura's biggest problem is Kishi's ineptitude as a writer really. Turning her gay wouldn't change that.</br></br></br>  <br>It is not a wild as people make it out to be. It is just unsatisfying reveals that usually end up ignoring old ones which then just become side lined</br>  <br>Am I the only one who was annoyed by his isolation in retrospect?<br><br>Like surely they should of gone "Well this kids parents were important and he is stupid powerful now, lets make sure he is trained right from a young age and has a good life." But no, everyone just forgets what actually happened and is mean to the random kid</br></br></br>  <br>After the Zabuza arc.<br> Cool villain. <br> Actually intimidating characters. <br> philosophical monologues on what it means to be a ninja. <br>Everything turned to shit past that as it was chosen to follow the dbz power level formular.<br>This is true for any shounen, first couple of arcs are decent new and fresh.<br>Around the 3rd to 4th arc it all goes to shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope this doesn't happen with hero academia.</br>  <br><br><br>But that is just it, Bleach is as good or satisfying as you make it out to be.<br><br>When I read it, I expect wacky schemes and convoluted shit with nice tits and asses, and that is exactly what I get.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The series wasn't so much about him as it was about his obsession with Sasuke, and the Uchiha. In fact, I think that the Indra shit was just introduced so that Naruto wouldn't become as irrelevant as the rest of the cast.<br><br>There was a point in time that you hadn't seen him in the story for over a year. During that time Sasuke was the MC and the story continued to be about him and the Uchiha with Naruto becoming more and more irrelevant. Anything that was introduced about Naruto in part II was just dropped into the story and never built upon.</br></br></br>  The series started to go down the drain towards the end of the chuunin exam/Konoha invasion arc. The moment the Akatsuki and Itachi were introduced is where the series suffered this harsh tonal shift in its themes. Just the existence of Itachi threw a big fucking wrench into how the series combat and "power levels" worked and unfortunately screwed the balance of everything.  <br> So... I don't have to give in to my friends and try to get into them? Whew. <br>Jesus christ learn to form your own opinions you fucking pleb.<br> My friends want me to get into this  <br> I will probably have to try :( <br> Hurrah! Some random anon on the internet told me it is bad!  <br> Now I don't have to give in to my friends! <br>Grow a fucking backbone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah mostly, turning her gay is only going to make matters worse with another layer of poorly developed awkward.</br>  <br>I kind of got the message that nobody other than a select few knew of his parentage. And they thought because of the fox it's also best not to mess with him or risk revealing too much lest others mess with him.<br>That said I'm not going to defend this incredulous plot any further. I think you're with me there.</br></br>  <br>It's just one of those weird thing sin retrospect. I'd thought he'd be treated more like the avatar (as in last airbender avatar)</br>  its just the same generic shonen where everything works out in the end with no serious consequences<br>it started out so promising because the main character was actually a fuckup and not a mary sue chosen one and had to actually work for his abilities, and even then he didnt always win</br>  <br>HEY... I'm not going to pay attention to what you say cause you're just a "random anon on the internet", okay? So I'm going to go ahead and listen to the other guy.</br>  <br><br>I almost feel like originally he was meant to be some random kid who was unlucky enough to get the Fox put inside him and all the hints about the 4th Hokage were just red herrings.<br><br>But considering Kishimoto stopped giving a shit in part 2 I think he decided to just give the fans what they expected/wanted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that the generic Shounen is actually supposed to be at least a bit poignant and issues have to be dealt with delicately. Naruto is the most boisterous and shoddy thing I've seen.</br>  <br>It would actually be pretty awesome if Naruto was just an unlucky shit who got fucked over. Would help push the whole work hard bit</br>  <br>Yeah, just that all this hindsight is getting me worked up over what it's turned into.</br>  <br><br>That's one of the things that got dropped so hard during part 2. Remember Neji's speech to Naruto during their match and how fucking terrible and depressing it sounded? Turns out Neji was 100% right. You can't beat fate. Naruto turned out to have a powerful bloodline, famous powerful parents and was a child of prophecy. Part 2 just shat all over the themes part 1 put forward.<br><br>This isn't even going into it's terrible portrayal of friendship, personal responsibility and forgiveness or whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad that happened. I really thought Itachi was a promising character who was like a breath of fresh air to the series. Just too bad...</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Bleach is many things but self aware it is not.</br>  <br>Yet One Piece has done this and I am sure Pirates are not suppose to be able to do this either. <br>I don't wanna break a OP vs Naruto fight loose but why should get OP away with this but not Naruto?</br></br>  <br>I think OP is just as cancerous as Naruto but the thing about OP is that it doesn't take itself as seriously as Naruto. Since the beginning it was about FUN and ADVENTURE so the out there stuff doesn't looks so bad since that's how the OP world was from the start. Altho recently I feel like OP is starting to take it's story more seriously which might be a problem if Oda forgets the original appeal of OP was the FUN ADVENTURE shit and not DBZ power level fights to save the world.</br>  Was Sand Invasion Arc the best and last best Arc?<br> Hokage Fight <br> Leaf Jonin kicking ass <br> Shikamaru genious Strats <br> Summoning Jutsu <br> First tailed beast intro <br> Seeing 1st and 2nd Hokage </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Became about power levels and lineage rather than effort <br> Stop actaully being ninjas <br> Sasuke wasn't a girl </br></br></br>  <br>Anyone got the /fit/ dude doing the Squat with the 'Somethin aint right" face? looks same as Naruto here</br>  <br> Hokage Fight <br>If the fights in shippuden had been more like that it wouldn't have been so bad. What happened Kishi? The jutsus were big but they weren't country destroying level, but they were enough that you knew that this was the big leagues.</br></br>  <br>The thing that annoyed me about Naruto's isolation is that it was never really elaborated on beyond the bare basics needed to give him a sob story.<br><br>The most important question is: who raised him? Who dressed him and fed him?</br></br></br>  Mods what the fuck. Why was this trash not deleted yet?<br><br>Check em.</br></br>  /a/ would u like if i made a manga and posted it weekly? I promise I'll plot out the entirety of it first in order to maintain consistent plot, good character progression, good male/female ratio, what say you  <br>What about that Darkness Jutsu Tobirama used on Sarutobi? was so overpowered. litteraly blinded your opponent. and his water Jutsu was off the charts. yet in the war he did nothing but FTG spam like a bitch</br>  <br>Let's try again.</br>  One of the things I hated most about the series is that the main villains are described as an 'organization', and yet they're really just a gang. And compounding on that, the more you learn about the individual members and the convoluted schemings of the higher ups... the less their motivations make sense.<br><br>Why the hell were they even working together when you get right down to it?</br></br>  <br>I think the Hokage paid a nurse to do it untill he was self sufficient, the leaf village didnt really have Foster care, and i doubt anyone would feel safe looking after the deamon fox baby as well</br>  <br><br><br>Jaraiya died because he was the mentor. The mentor always dies...that's the trope.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the real reason it's not delved into is that Kishi realised it'd give Naruto an emotional connection and mess with his poorly implemented isolation background.</br>  <br>Fuuuggg</br>  <br>It's covered in the games man, when it goes over each memeber of the Akatski's enrolement<br>Kakazu-Money<br>Hidan/Deidara-Safety and freedom<br>Sasori/Orochimaru- Science n shit<br>Pain/Konan-Moons eye<br>Itachi-Spy<br>Kisame-for the lolz</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it became all about Sasuke considering the book was called NARUTO.</br>  <br>The fandom loves to either say it was abusive aides or he's been on his own since he was like 6.<br><br>Really the Hokage should've been able to look after him due to being a living weapon, OR<br>OR<br>Train Naruto himself to make sure he could control Kurama</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, worst part of Naruto was them hiding the Truth from him. Fuck what minato thinks. letting a kid be alone is not good for a Host, did they even have an Anbu on him when he was a kid? incase he lost controll or some shit?</br>  <br>Nice dubs. I would like to order a few for myself.</br>  <br><br>I think this entire element is the most glaring evidence that the series wasn't properly thought out ahead of time.<br><br>Oh yeah a few major elements were thought of, but no consideration was given to how they operated or affected the story as a whole. Kishi came up with a skeleton plot and then threw shit at it until it congealed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It seems that he probably had ANBU watchers, and can you really trust a kid in saying that he isn't the 4th's son<br> Literally telling the Oonoki that the son of their Hitler is still around <br><br>Naruto could've been the Leaf's strongest ninja by teens if he bothered to be trained<br><br>check 'em</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>awful shit tier. one piss is just as bad. bleach is /a/'s favourite. though /a/ is tsundere for Bleach.</br>  <br>Just what does one have to do to get dubs around here?</br>    Anyone see the latest Naruto epp?<br>Kakashi as a fking kid, even before the white fang killed himself. took out 2 Chunin solo, while his dad watched. THE FUCK</br>  <br> No Boruto thread mod message <br> On a thread objectively discussing how shit Naruto is as a series. <br>Do you even reading comprehension brah?</br></br></br>  <br>Realistically, if no one bothered to take care of Naruto then he would have been mentally impaired. I know that in the story he's not supposed to the smartest person ever, but he would have had development issues. So even though I understand that having someone take care of him growing up would have given him an emotional connection, but I can't just ignore the huge plot hole that it creates. <br><br>I think him having Gaara's backstory would have been a bit better, because Gaara still had sibilings. No matter what he still was a little brother. Like, if Naruto had a caregiver who was abusing him and then tried to kill him and the caregiver was put to death, publicly, then I can see more reason people would despise him. <br><br>Also, the fact that Kakashi barely interacted with his teacher's kid makes him look like the biggest fucking asshole ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all shit but One Piece is like a comical cartoony turd that makes amusing sounds, while Naruto is just a dark, squishy mess that burns your asshole when it's finished.</br>  Check em  <br>Yeah, that shit was crazy.</br>  <br><br><br>FUCKING CHECKED</br></br></br>  <br>Was Kakashi still in Anbu fooling arround with Yammato back then? i know Minato put Kakashi on Kushina while she was preggers, but nothing afterwards i think.<br>Do theese villages take having a walking nuke seriously or not?? i dont fucking get it. al it takes is a mental breakdown and they can escape. or be kidnaped</br></br>  <br>I forgot to check yours. Nice dubs too.</br>    <br>Also, it begs the question of why did Obito wait so long. Naruto could have been convinced at 5 to leave the village. Like, if you were on par with the 4th Hokage why even bother waiting so long? Nobody knew it was Obito that unleashed the 9 tails. He could have returned and everyone would have been happy that he was back. Then he could have taken the little kid out of there. <br><br>The real problem with Naruto is that, as others have said, Kishi didn't plan a lot of shit out and ended up creating huge plotholes as the story progressed. Also, editors are at fault for not catching them either.</br></br></br>  <br>Today is not my lucky day.</br>  Okay, one last time before I give up.  <br>Go back to [s4s] and learn from the masters</br>  <br>I can't believe this shit.<br><br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it was just another shonen with a really strange looking MC that's about friendship and love. <br><br>nigga body parts get blown up in the show like it's nothing</br></br></br>  <br>Oh in that case is it too gorey like say Tokyo Ghoul? I dint like that by the way.</br>  <br>I say that the way Naruto disregarded some of its earlier themes was bad.<br><br>The theme of hard work was one which got tossed aside. Naruto at the start, Rock Lee &amp; more showed that hard work &amp; determination can overcome talent. Naruto vs Neji showed this. Now we have super-talented Sasuke gaining powers out of nowhere.<br><br>Since the timeskip, how many techniques did Sasuke ACTUALLY learn through hard work rather than it being handed to him? Mangekyo Sharingan? Yes. EMS? His Sharinnegan? Exactly. Atleast Naruto struggles for his crap. He had to train for Sage Mode &amp; use the power of friendship. Sasuke's more or less "I'm an Uchiha so shower me with power-ups"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your constant Naruto threads you fucking faggots.</br>  <br> hard work beats talent is a major theme of naruto <br> he only wins fights because of the fox and because he has the soul of some ancient super ninja or shit like that </br></br>  <br>Nice one.</br>  <br>Thanks. Didn't notice that, also<br> Gets triggered when people shit on Nardo <br>Man, go get better taste in anime. Or go to reddit if you like the shitstain that is Naruto so much.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>HOLY SHIT I GOT DUBS!<br><br>FUCKING FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying this isn't a stealth Nuruto thread <br><br>Nice try Narutard.<br><br>Check em.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stealth?

And if you check, the only posts I made are replies to you. Go on tard, crosscheck my IP.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The difference is OP was never particularly realistic and always had an element of bombastic absurdity in everything it did.<br><br>Naruto actually started out fairly grounded and low-key. It was Ninja using magic but it wasn't especially over the top. Go reread The Third vs Orochimaru fight and look how underwhelming it is visually compared to some of the later fights in the series, even the later fights of part 1. And that was meant to be the very best of the best fighting each other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. And Nurutu threads are not allowed when you have nothing new to discuss by the mod's words.
