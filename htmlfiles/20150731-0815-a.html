[   power is "he can't die" <br><br>So just a typical One Piece character, huh?<br><br>Did he really think concrete would kill him? Motherfuckers go through solid walls all the time in this series.</br></br></br></br>  Bump  <br>Only a flashback devil fruit can kill him.</br>  <br> Did he really think concrete would kill him? <br>after falling down thousands of kilometers? maybe</br></br>  <br> Ivankov turns him into a woman <br> Kaido becomes a mother <br> ??????? <br> DEATH </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a difference between going through solid walls, and falling 10,000 meters into one.</br></br>   claims he can't die <br> has giant scar <br><br>go back to who ever did that to you</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Usopp could survive that fall.</br>  <br>I'd say kaidou is sub bear king in terms of design. Really, really bad.<br><br>Why are op fans so defensive? Kaidou looks like shit. This isn't bait.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>Immortality=/=Invulnerable</br></br>  Kaidos introduction was lame. Really fucking lame. I expected him to be full Brutal Rampage mode, especially if he's gonna live up to "Hundred beasts Kaido".<br><br>I mean, I tought he was gonna be all bloodthirsty ruthless maniac, instead he's suicidal and sick of his life. What the hell?</br></br>  <br><br>It might've been WB - which is why he was so pissed. <br><br>That's why he wanted to go to MF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ivankov can pierce his skin </br>  <br>'Tis but a scratch.</br>  <br>It was technically a flashback when he jumped off the sky island. He was really serious.</br>  dat delicious Nami, it really has been too long<br>Thank you Oda</br>  <br><br>Kaidou is probably top now, but BB is still a fucking tank, so is Zoro too I guess.</br></br>  So since Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base, how bad do you suspect the new mouse girl will affect these threads, the outside opinion of one piece/fan base, or any other variables that you can think of, anon?<br><br>Also what's the best panel in your opinion?</br></br>  <br> go back to who ever did that to you <br>One is from Whitebeard and the other is from Roger so...</br></br>  <br> still trying this hard </br>  <br><br>Why are you fucking trying still?</br></br>  <br>I think the logistics and efficiency of this method of suicide are secondary to the ridiculous idea of jumping to your death from a sky island. It makes for powerful visuals and gets across the idea of suicide without being contrived. And this is One Piece, ideas like jumping down from a high place to kill yourself in a spectacular fashion fit the tone of the series but Kaido trying to rip his own head off or reaching into his ribcage and crushing his heart hardly fit.</br>  <br>???<br>he is a giant with long hair and some tattos<br>why he's design is bad?</br></br></br>  <br>She's actually wearing a shirt for once.</br>  <br> suicidal and sick of his life <br><br>really nigga</br></br></br>  <br> Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base <br>Are you serious? One Piece has been popular as fuck with fujos ever since Sanji joined.</br></br>  Kaidou wouldn't die even if he was killed  <br> So since Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base <br>who are Zoro, Sanji &amp; Ace?</br></br>  <br>He can't if the one who did that was Roger or WB. Heck, maybe that's the reason he tried to stop WB going to Marineford.</br>  <br>Anon you can't expect them all to be a super tough coolguy. Kaido has a really emotional and soft side to him despite being the strongest pirate ever, can't you see the complex nature of his duality? ;_; <br>One Piece is truly the citizen kane of manga.</br></br>  <br>Why is Rebecca on that island?</br>  <br>I got you fam<br> &gt;&gt;/FateGeneral/ <br> &gt;&gt;/TokyoGhoulGeneral/ </br></br></br>  Why didn't they just chain him with seastone and throw him out into the sea?  So Kaidos nickname "Hundred Beast" isn't related to his DF but rather than he's as strong as Hundred Beasts, or something?  So which new nakama will join Luffy to fight Kaido?  <br><br>Maybe he has gills.</br></br>  <br> dat bellybutton <br> dem vagina bones </br></br>  <br>finally a skirt again</br>  <br>I expected a lot more that a some henchmen looking huge bitch for a fucking yonkou.<br><br>His shadowy image that looked nothing like him looked more menacing.</br></br></br>  <br>Fear the worst</br>  <br> Army of Zoans <br> Island called Zoo </br></br>  <br>Why is this meme so stale?</br>  <br>He might not even have a fruit power, and he may not even be able to drown.<br><br>I'd be pissed as fuck if I were chained down at the bottom of the ocean for eternity. He's probably able to just try and walk to shallow water, if that's even something he can do.</br></br></br>  <br>He ate 100 zoans.</br>  <br>Baby gets crushed in Kaido's vagina while (s)he is giving birth, Kaido doesn't become a mom.</br>  <br>you forget dem thighs mang</br>  <br><br>I wish Ivankov turned me into a woman.</br></br>  <br>How can a skeleton cushion your fall?</br>  <br> first time since the timeskip she has actually worn a shirt, not just a coat over a bikini. </br>  From the last thread, BB is no longer the best tank in one piece now whe have seen Kaido?   he has the Ope Ope immortality  <br><br>How react, /co/?</br></br>  <br>Nami's just being a passive-aggressive dick as always</br>  <br>So what you're saying is you've only been here long enough to experience the Dressrosa fujo shit.</br>  <br> cerberus zoan theory pic <br>Retard</br></br>  <br>an afro can.</br>  <br> /co/ </br>  <br> /co/ </br>  <br>Well, they introduced it to the story. Might as well do something with it.<br>So either someone has Ope Ope immortality or someone gets it eventually.</br></br>  <br>Does /co/ like One Piece?</br>  Maybe he can't die, but can he be persuaded by the power of friendship, every shounen protagonist's main weapon?  <br> /co/ </br>  <br><br> /co/ </br></br>  <br>wut? i just get a pic for the internet, take you autism pills before posting.</br>  <br>Yeah. One Piece is very westernized.</br>  <br>Nah. Luffy has a goal: beat the Yonkou. This ain't Naruto man.</br>  <br>Oh, well they can't be too bad then</br>  <br>Calling it now, Kaido is a Bleach-tier hybrid. Explains why they call him the strongest creature.</br>  <br> /co/ </br>  <br>Why you posted a retarded pic, anon?<br><br>Non retard people don't post retarded pics.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. It's one of the few shows on Toonami we like.</br>  <br>Luffy is more characterized by generally not giving a shit than he is by a desire to bring out the good in people</br>  <br>Goddamn, Mangapanda is fucking awful.</br>  So Kaido is trying to imitate Whitebeard, right? Whitebeard was probably the only guy alive stronger than him and he managed to kill himself by getting caught up in a huge war, so now Kaido is trying to do the same.  <br> shows <br>Isn't the dubbed anime somewhere in the vicinity of Thriller Bark right now? That's around the point where they say fuck you to pacing and start adapting one chapter per episode rather than two</br></br>  <br>fuck off you piece of shit</br>  <br> off by one </br>  <br>and kicking the ass of bad guys</br>   has a favorite island <br> wants to die <br><br>These sort of absolutes and extremes never make for decent story telling</br></br></br>  <br>I want to kiss that cutie</br>  <br>You mean extremes like<br> Wants to be the king of all pirates <br>?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Bc suicidal people turn around the world before doing it or after every fails?</br></br>  <br>elaborate</br>  <br>People in toonami threads already hate the pacing and fIller, and because some of them are too stupid to read the manga or at the very least even marathon the anime, they don't really hold OP in very high regard. Couple that with the fact that then anime started airing during the Long Ring arc, it doesn't have as many fans as it should.</br>  <br>pretty sure brook has the immortality fruit.</br>  <br>sorry but you have to settle for kissing your computer screen</br>  Poor Sanji. His first appearance in well over a year, and it's completely overshadowed by Kaido.  <br>he does /fit/ and ate over hundred beast for proteins and gains (just look how ripped he is)</br>  <br>jesus christ<br>brook has the reincarnation fruit, fucking stop speedreading</br></br>  <br>Your logic is stupid. You think depressed or suicidal people don't have favorite things? It's not even a possession, it's a location.</br>    <br> The last Ope user probably cursed him into living forever with it before Kaido killed him. <br> Kaido's been alive since before Jaya got launched into the sky <br> Got super strong trying to get buff enough to kill himself </br></br></br>  <br>oh GOD<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>  Just because you can't die doesn't mean that you can't be defeated.<br><br>Luffy will bind Kaidou up with haki rubber arm (after powerups) and will only let go when Kaidou acknowledges defeat.<br><br>They spend a hundred days and a hundred nights together before Kaidou admits defeat.<br><br>Then they spend a hundred days and a hundred nights partying, because Kaidou has found the will to live through Luffy<br><br>fuck I'm so cheesy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reincarnation <br> a walking fucking skeleton <br>the man came back to life, you fucking retard, how the fuck is that not a form of immortality?</br></br></br>  The whole narration part but especially <br> allow me to repeat myself <br><br>Is this bad niggastream translation, or is this the confirmation there really is an external narrator telling us this luffy's and this generation's history?  it's Usopp </br></br></br>  to me he seems more like the guy who wants to test his limits or see if he has any at all. He doesn't seem actually suicidal in a depressed way.  <br>Look like Avalo Pizzaro from BB Crew</br>  <br> They spend a hundred days and a hundred nights together before Kaidou admits defeat. <br>Don't let the fujos hear this.</br></br>  <br> not showing his legs <br>please not another buff mofo who skipped leg day</br></br>  <br> Oda <br> not the pied piper of anatomy </br></br>  <br>The fruit is called the Yomi Yomi no Mi - Yomi being the land of the dead in japanese mythology.<br>The official translation uses Revive Revive.<br><br>It's established that the user is given one extra life, though. That's the main use, the other soul-themed techniques don't have anything to do with immortality either.</br></br></br></br>  Why don't all DF users wear floaties? Bunch a dumb niggas. Really all these people on boats need life vest, you can have adventure AND safety you know..  <br>  he is still standing in the hole he made when he fell <br>Confirmed mach 20 speedreading fgt.</br></br>  <br>are you trying to bait or something? <br>he has the yomi yomi no mi <br>the name and function has been told already, there is no fucking secret</br></br></br>  <br>he wouldn't be a skeleton if he found his body faster<br>next time he dies, he's really dead</br></br>  <br>He plays a flute and people's arms and legs follow him into a river and drown?</br>  So is Kaidou the guy that got immortalized by the previous ope user? Neat.  <br>the point is that his legs are not shown wether he stands in a hole or not</br>  <br>No, their arms and legs follow him and then he feeds them to a rat army.</br>  <br>Well do you see legs in Kaidou's picture?</br>  Why doesn't Kaidou eat two devil fruits just to see why happens if he doesn't care about living?<br><br>Why doesn't he just launch himself into space and float around until he stops thinking?</br></br>  <br>That's not how ope inmortality works.</br>  <br>I'm well aware, grants the user a second life. It's another form of immortality. As it grants him the chance to still be alive and interact with the physical world, which we haven't seen anyone else do it until brooks introduction. <br><br>can't see how you can skill a skeleton, but whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>How much of his skeleton would you have to crush before he dies?</br>  <br> suicidal in a depressed way. <br>you are wrong he is clearly japanese in design and soul so after so many humilliating defeats he want to commit suicide<br><br>thats all  you dont see it because you are a dirty westerner  <br><br>also king of jobers right here relevating smokersan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> can't see how you can skill a skeleton, but whatever. <br>by crushing his bones into dust<br>didn't Brook say something like that at FI?</br></br></br>  <br> Why doesn't Kaidou eat two devil fruits <br> Kaido of 100 beasts <br>He ate 100 zoans niggah</br></br></br>   there are people that believe the theories people say here <br> they think it is cannon  <br> they don't even bother reading the manga  <br>release day cancer is really an eye opener</br></br></br>  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br> Kidd&amp;Co get spanked <br> THEY JOIN AND GO FOR SHANKS <br> BIG MOM BOUNCES IN TOO <br> THE HIGH PREIST KEEPS CHILLING </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ope immortality should just be the ability to bodyswap permanently once you start getting old and sick.<br><br>Anything beyond that is hack writing</br></br></br></br>  <br>s-sorry anon senpai</br>  is there something i have skipped reading? when did sanji, nami, Brook and momono at this Island? what have i forgotten/skipped?  Kidd, Apoo and Hawkins will get defeated by Kadiou off screen and you all know it  <br> can't see how you can kill a skeleton <br>Fucking him to the point where he's nothing but dust comes to mind. It's an interesting thought, though. At what point would Brook be considered dead and his second life done at this point? If he's just dust, does his soul still hang around?</br></br>  <br>Well, it is the ultimate devil fruit. And oda kept shoving more retarded shit onto it, I just started assuming the worst.</br>  <br>that's the thing, you can't kill a dead skeleton.</br>  <br> 10000meters <br>It's 10km dude, he didn't drop from the moon.</br></br>  <br>Catrina is Big Mom and Shirue as shanks</br>  <br>There is something that keeps bothering me. Why is he talking about Whitebeard now when the dude has been dead for 2 years?</br>  <br>As Caesar said they escaped from Big Mom and then sailed ahead to Zou as planned, Oda then skipped how they got involved with that furry chick and how that got them into trouble with Kaidous underlings.</br>  <br>He is really old. 2 years is a short amount of time for hi,.</br>  <br>He heard it from Urouge probably<br><br>It's not like there's a fucking mail service to the secret cloud islands.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe because whitebeard was the only one strong enough to kill him</br>  <br>Every time Kaido would try to suicide,he'd get a call from Whitebeard telling a death joke.<br>Now he kinda misses that asshole.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he has been falling for 2 years</br>  <br>Remember his crew was asking where he was? Maybe he's been absent for a while.<br><br><br>Or maybe he's just complaining because he died and now he's bored.<br><br><br>Either way Basil looks like he shat himself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perfect bait, man</br>  How the fuck was Sanjuan Wolf inprisoned? He is bigger than entire Impel Down.  <br>oh i see, i thought i had skipped something. thanks mate!</br>  <br>whitebeard's death was broadcasted, while blackbeard took over whitebeard's territory. In fact, why doesn't Kaidou ask blackbeard to kill him?</br>    <br><br>I understood that Whitebeard suggested Kaidou to jump from the sky island to kill himself and obviously it didn't work.</br></br>  <br>sweet</br>  <br><br>Mistranslation, the original line is closer to "Damn that Whitebeard... going and dying when I can't..."<br><br>Probably just bitches about Whitebeard dying every time he fails at suicide.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give him a break. he's still in shock for letting his favorite fuckbuddy die. When Kaidou and WB had sex, whole new world was shaking.</br>  <br>Nah, I've been /here/ since Water 7, I'm just &gt;implying these threads have never been so bad before. :^)</br>  <br>You have to be 18 to post here.</br>  <br>nope, still not funny</br>  <br>He's jealous of Whitebeard cause he got to die in a battlefield, so he's been getting ready for a huge war with Doffy so he could die like Whitebeard did. Doffy was on the ride since he wanted to see Kaido wreck the shitty world because of his hatred for CDs and plebes.</br>  <br>Still a good oc.<br>To be honest, I expected Kaidou to be a boring guy who had nothing to his character except for strength. I'm glad I was wrong. His hobby is suicide. Fucking suicide. The guy just keeps fighting everyone and everything in the hope someone will actually kill him. That's cool as fuck.<br>It's even cooler when you compare this guy to that other guy from fairy tail who have the exact same character concept and character motivation. Clearly shows the difference in talent betwen Mashima and Oda.</br></br></br>  <br>That makes a whole lot more sense.</br>  <br> broadcasted <br>Go on. Where was it broadcasted to.</br></br>  anyone noticed that the skyisland in this capture is carried by fucking balloons  <br><br>Maybe Oda wanted to get back at Mashima for ripping off him so many times.</br></br>  <br>uhh Sabaody??</br>   one piece is about furrys now <br><br>DROPPED<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you cannot possibly be fucking serious.</br>  <br> It's even cooler when you compare this guy to that other guy from fairy tail who have the exact same character concept and character motivation. <br>??</br></br>  <br>Doesn't take much to beat mashima at writing,even a 7 year old could do that</br>  <br>Speedreader fucking go and stay go.</br>  <br> THE HIGH PREIST KEEPS CHILLING <br>and I want to see Big Mom already, don't give two shits about Kaidou.</br></br>  <br>Probably zeref</br>  <br>Chopper is a furry from the very beginning.</br>  <br>Kaidou forces the Kidd alliance to join him.</br>  <br>Zeref, nigger</br>  <br>Oh right. I forgot about Zeref. Thanks.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>SS &amp; GOMAD</br>  <br>uh ok?</br>  <br> Still a good oc <br>no, since Kaidou is not edgy at all and whoever made this oc is another faggot who does not know the true meaning of this word</br></br>   Shit. I survived the fall in One Piece. <br><br>Jesus Christ, really?</br></br>  So momo's description of a pirate at his first meeting clearly depicts Kaidou.<br><br>Any guesses on the connection between the three samurai and Kaidou. Other than the fact they're all obviously from Wano.<br><br>Also remember Momo ate the fruit after they already set out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it's not like " immortal being so sick of immortality that will try to die in every possible way" trope is any original</br>   introduce new attractive subordinate of Kaidou <br> Kaidou arc lasts for 100 chapters, stuff happens <br> He falls in love with his subordinate along its course <br> someone, luffy or Kidd lands a fatal blow on Kaidou, probably with the help of law who can "deactivate" immortality thanks to his fruit <br> i wanted to live, just a little bit longer... <br> &gt;that subordinate was drake <br>It's coming. The new OTP.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kaido probably had the Op Op fruit used on him to grant immortality. This probably happened around the same time Cora-san broke into that place to get it for law.  <br>Momo is Kaido's son or grandson.</br>  <br>yes, he certainly was still in one piece</br>  <br><br><br> forgetting it's release day <br>Why is the fruit that can make someone immortal only worth 5 billion berries?<br><br>you would think it would be priceless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>True.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Yes. To Sabaody.<br><br>Not to the secret cloud islands a scant few have any clue about, and vice versa.<br><br>Dumbasses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5 billion beri is the highest price for anything introduced in OP so far.</br>  <br><br>The 5 Billion is probably for the Ope Ope on the basis of what Law has done.<br><br>Maybe the Immortality Operation isn't so well known about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you post has nothing to do with the other posts.</br>  <br>you goddamn fucking imbecile</br>  <br> The strongest man in the world, no fuck that, one of the fucking Yonko is dead <br> Another Yonko hearing it for the first time in 2 years <br>How fucking stupid can you really get?</br></br></br>  <br>So only people at Sabaody know about Whitebeard's death?<br><br>The whole fucking world knows, you retard.</br></br></br>  <br> He wants to die. <br> He can't drown himself. <br><br>Does that mean he has no devil powers?</br></br></br></br>  why do people assume that the immortality from the ope ope is being invulnerable?<br>why do people talk about theories of one piece when they don't even read it properly?</br>  <br>He could still drown himself</br>  <br>also you're really fucking claiming Kaido has been on that island for two whole years? He got up there a few chapters ago you dipshit</br>  <br>It has one single dog-girl thing and you think its all about furrys. You were DROPPED on your head as a child.</br>  <br>there's always been an external narrator</br>  <br>because many of these faggots skipped arcs and/or speedread through it</br>  <br> they don't even read it properly? <br> expecting much from a group of people who read shonen. </br></br>  <br>We don't assume, we're speculating.</br>  <br>The transmissions were arriving at Sabaody first. Then, they were repeated with the rest of the world. <br><br><br>The delay is unnoticeable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it mean he can't gain devil fruit powers? If he actually tries to kill himself eating more than one fruit would be a pretty good way of doing so.</br>  <br>OH FUCK<br>this legit made me laugh</br></br>  <br>has he tried falling off stairs?</br>  <br>Pretty sure it was even stated to be just eternal youth. Eternal Youth =/= immortality.</br>  <br>You know what I want? For Luffy to never defeat Kaidou.<br>I want Luffy to have a good fight really give it everything he has. But in the end I want him to fall and for Kaidou to slink back into the mists, sated. Then maybe a cover page arc where Kaidou is touring the globe on his own, free to pursue his glorious death after the Strawhats have torn his empire down (hey they've gotta walk away with some kind of win). I think this'll teach Luffy that he doesn't have to beat everyone to be Pirate King; that sometimes making allies and coexisting with others is the better route to take. Plus I like the idea of Kaidou living out the rest of his life as an undefeatable monster.</br></br>    <br>Even if Kaido is a devil fruit user<br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink to the bottom <br> give no fucks <br> get bored and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's a FUCKING HOBBY<br>he knows he can't die and hasn't been close to for a very long time<br>he's now testing a few stuff for the fuck of it<br>probably no one gave him the chills of a good fighting so he's bored as hell</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been wracking my brain and I can't think what Kaidou could want with Momonosuke. The only thing that comes to mind is that he's secretly Wano's ruler and we're getting another "pirates stole muh country" plot.</br>    Kaidou long lost brother is Avalo Pizarro. <br>  Got captured on purpose to find him. <br>  Sustain torture and execution to find his &gt;beloved brother. <br>  Fail to find him (never sent to Impel Down &gt;cause we know the only people that &gt;escaped it are Shiki and Luffy &amp; Co). <br>  Decide to kill himself cause despair <br>  Doesn't work cause bearing torture and &gt;shit made him immortal. <br>  Decide to keep trying to kill himself anyway &gt;cause he's bored </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we're one the same boat. I get a bit further by saying I don't even want Luffy to defeat Akainu, at least not by himself, but that's just me.</br>  <br><br>If you anons are still here, the manga is called Angel Densetsu. The beginning is quite good but after some time it gets boring with the same concept over and over agian.</br></br>  <br><br> still forcing and samefaging to shill your own OC <br><br>Please go back to tumblr or apforums, or some place that accepts people younger than 18 posting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>my point exactly</br>  <br>Avalo is not Kaido's brother but a Kaido's wannabe.</br>  <br> fags.jpg <br><br>oh wow</br></br></br>  <br>look up oni oni theory. very convincing theory that his fruit is a demon king oni</br>  <br>  wanting to see a landwhale <br><br> Fuck off back to tumblr cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet brook is getting a raging  Boner </br>  <br>it would just keep happening for ever and ever</br>  why doesn't this retard just jump in the ocean? he's a devil fruit user right?

Just google what immortality means. Brooke can die therefore he is not immortal. Saying that he is is the same as saying that someone brought back to life in a hospital is immortal. No they're not they just got am extra shot is all.</br>  <br> pretending to respect fur fags and hate innocent people to stir shit <br><br>No, when you are retarded and want to fuck balls, you don't dress like a ball, leech from your family and keeps showing everybody you know that you like to fuck balls. That special snowflake mentality that bred so many queers and animal fuckers is the reason why mentally ill can't receive proper treatment and ruin people's lives. Of course you are just a kid trying to be a troll without knowing how, which makes you actually much worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not actually autistic enough to go to such length just for the sake of shitposting, but I fully understand you might need to keep yourself deluded on that matter for the sake of being able to shitpost in peace on your favorite men only safeplace.<br>And I don't live in a third world conservative autistic shithole so my whole family is aware of my penchant for manga, hell my mom knows I read homoerotic shit.</br></br>  <br>Whitebeard was the strongest MAN<br>Kaidou is the strongest CREATURE<br><br>So yeah, going by that he's the strongest pirate in the world.<br><br>However, that title may be not because of his actual strength, but because of him not being able to die<br><br>We just don't know enough yet</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't whitebeard also a pirate?</br>  <br> Whitebeard <br> Shanks <br> Crocodile <br> Mihawk <br> Garp (or perhaps Dadan)? <br> Vegapunk (not yet introduced, but damn, he had a huge impact on the world) <br> Dragon? <br><br>Not sure if I reached 10, but oh well</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rayleigh is Luffy's mom <br>Ivankov turned her into a man</br></br>  Is Kaidou blind, looks like he's got scars over both eyes In the first panel and Oda is still holding his face back to some extent  <br>But he was defeated 7 times already.</br>  <br> leech from your family <br>That's another matter entirely.

At the preset he's unbeatable, but in the past he wasn't. He just never died</br>  <br> trying this hard <br><br>You see, that's why you lurk and stay on a site the more you can bare before trying to troll and shitpost, then it can actually work instead of sounding like you are an autistic newfag<br><br>protip: even tumblr infested places like /co/ laugh at horse-fuckers and don't whiteknight them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if he's like One Piece's Kumagawa? He "fails" at everything, but leaves chaos and destruction everywhere?</br>  <br><br> implying </br></br>  <br>That's harjudin you friggin imbecile. Don't go spouting your infectious head Canon everywhere</br>  <br>maybe it's an apforums newfag? Isn't that place a cesspool, I wouldn't be surprised if they also breed horse-lickers there.</br>  <br><br><br>Well, Kaido certainly is up to some "I'm starting the biggest war" business and stockpiling his forces with Smile.<br><br>It's too early to tell and we're grasping at straws, but if that's the way it's gonna be, how will Drake work into the "Oz" theme? I don't remember a dinosaur in the movie.</br></br></br></br></br>  This whole suicidal thing with Kaidou is so weird...<br><br>Are we supposed to get the image that he is so strong, he can't kill himself?</br></br>  <br> edge meme <br><br>I think the only board underaged enough to keep this is /v/, but I'm not sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Please no.</br>  why doesn't he just fight shanks. there's a fair chance he would die  I completely forgot they still had Caesar. How long ago was it that we saw the other team last anyways?  Why hasn't he simply solo marched on marineford or Mariejois and piss off Akainu and the holy dragons? They'd want him dead for sure and would do anything to kill him, especially if he does something to instigate them more than usual.<br><br>Hopefully this and the drowning method will be answered within the following month.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's the point.</br>  <br>Why're you getting so angry about an image, anon?</br>  <br>people kept bringing up that it was two years so oda showed us what happened</br>  <br>i think about 1 1/2 year</br>  Once again /a/ proves it cannot comprehend a comic for children  <br>He already did?</br>  <br> explaining why a meme didn't work <br> angry <br><br>I'm helping you jim, you need to accept good criticism, even if you want to be a memester.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is so strong Whitebeard and Shanks could'nt kill him.<br><br>They totally were able to kick his ass in tumble-war though</br></br></br>  <br>600 days to be exact.</br>  <br> implying <br>it is chapter release day anon, the day when the underaged horde and cancer from every other shithole flocks to /a/, it always gets better around Saturday</br></br>  <br>underrated</br>  <br>I'm not the original mememaster, I'm just asking. I guess some people found it funny.</br>  <br>Why doesn't luffy stretch to the grand line?</br>  One Piece... is so boring now.  <br>What are you even on about? I mean, it's not a particularly funny picture but there's no reason to be so mad about it. It's just a fucking joke, and you sound pretty understand yourself since you seem to think that it's making fun of Oda's writing when instead the point is obviously to deconstruct the character concepts and equate that to your stereotypical original character do not steal. Which is funny because the traits described by the dumb fucking meme are totally the sort of mary sue badassest dude alive traits you could see affixed to some 12-year old's original character. The point is that the context makes it work and Kaido comes across as genuinely badass because there's world building and hype behind it and the introduction lives up to it despite individual shit being objectively silly, which is pretty much what One Piece excels at. God damn.</br>  <br>doffyfag detected</br>  <br>I found it funny</br>  <br>December 2013</br>  You guys are retarded. Kaido doesn't know Caesar creates devil fruits. If you sell drugs do you tell your customer about the guy who made them?  <br> ... <br>oh, and your baiting skills are seriously lacking</br></br>  <br>I can't wait for nightmare luffy vs rumble ball kaido</br>  test  <br>Grow some balls a little and learn to counter or debate properly instead of resorting to lame quips.</br>  <br> writing a wall to defend a bad misused meme people disliked <br><br>edge meme being misused was already weak a few years ago. Now it's 2015, someone still forcing it, and on unfunny pics is like someone tatooing "underaged faggot" on his forehead. Sorry if it offends you, but that's how it looks here, I'm sure your next OC dunut steel will work better.</br></br></br>  <br>I think people are jumping to conclusions that Kaido is a man repenting for his sins and wishing at all times to die. MS says "This man was searching for a place to die" and shows him jumping off sky island as the only indicators of suicide, and proceeds to say how he was defeated, tortured, survived executions, and caused destruction.<br><br>I feel like it'd be more accurate to say he enjoys brushes with death, or he's testing his limits, or would accept death if it was possible but it simply isn't and he regularly checks to see if his "curse" of immortality still works. If he just wanted to die and couldn't because of his strength, there'd be no point in him amassing a crew, stockpiling smile, and maintaining authority in the New World. He'd just have to attack the Marine HQ nonstop until he is killed in battle or defeats everyone there is alive - no crew increases chances of dying.</br></br></br>  <br> .png </br>  <br>I tried :^)<br>It's okay, I needed to take a break from 4chan anyways.</br></br>  <br>Yes, give me rhino men</br>  <br>Nice nami pepe.

He wants to start a giant war just for fun</br>  <br>as I said nice paintskills, using 4chanX for a change almost got me</br>  the old design is so much better  The fact that he has been defeated and captured many times does not help the hype, he is just an intimidating punching bag. Maybe after all that beat up he became the strongest.

I don't remember it.</br>  <br>Last episode dumb dumb</br>  <br><br>Why is this Haruno?<br>I don't know anything about LNs, so is it a common thing to have mysterious monologues that are later revealed to be a character from the story?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, read the memorandums.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5057196<br>1. Iroha<br>2. Komachi<br><br>Good taste anons</br></br></br></br>  <br> even Yukimom is above Sagami </br>  <br>In my opinion, the first memorandum is the hardest to figure out. I believe that it belongs to Hayama.<br><br>The second one belongs to Hayama and the third one undoubtedly belongs to Haruno.</br></br></br>  <br>First memorandum is Hachiman, second is Hayama, third is Haruno.<br>They reference the books when they all meet up after shopping for Yukino's present.</br></br>  <br><br><br>but in the first they say they start reading, then the second they continue reading the same book.</br></br></br>  Is spyro dead? Did Yen Press get to him?  <br>First memorandum mentions someone picking up and reading "No Longer Human."<br>Hachiman is reading it in the last chapter and afraid of continuing to read it knowing how it ends.<br><br>Second Memorandum quotes "Run, Melos!" and Hayama does the same.<br><br>Third Memorandum mentions sympathizing with the Tyrant King something Haruno does, and also questioning whether genuine things exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Haruno  <br>The three monsters are similar. They are highly perceptive and can easily see through people, It's not surprising that they have comparable thoughts and problems.</br>  SPYRO WHERE ARE YOU??!<br>I NEED MY YAHARI DOSAGE FOR MY AUTISM.<br>PLEASE SAVE US FROM THE JEWS!</br></br>  Why can't 8man be loved straight one fucking time? Is it so hard to add a girl to a series who says I love you the way you are with your fishy eyes and fucking attitude? Why the fuck, why in the unholy fuck, is this shit filled with girls like hikigaya-kun you deadeyes hehehe fucker or hikki you are really disgusting! Or senpaiii how can I get to suck hayama senpais coooock? Watari you fuck. Just add a cute honest girl to this shit.  <br><br>The first ends with him saying there were previous afraid, but decided they need to continue the book.<br><br>The second mentions both books, and how they kept re-reading them.<br><br>The third says they don't know how many times they've read them.<br><br>Plus the titles seem to be a continued sentence.<br><br>That seems like a progression of a single person. Sorry, I'm not sure. Is this kyakka site not good?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what is the crisis these teenagers are facing?<br><br>Haruno walked in the room and was like "hey ya'll niggas suck" and everybody got sad and shit. What? I don't get why shit got real in that scene. Everything got so real it became a goddamn comedy.</br></br>  <br>Komachi exists but he doesn't have the balls to go through with it.</br>  <br>The main autist of the story is friends with two totally hot chicks that may or may not kill themselves if they don't get the D and he's going to have to pick one of them.</br>    <br>Because 8man himself is a cynical asshole, no one would love that without getting to know him first.<br>And once they do know how he is it's a fucking minefield with him, he doesn't believe words even if someone says them straight to his face.</br></br>  <br>Haruno is just pushing and pushing wanting Yukino to react.<br>She wants her to get mad and stand up for herself.<br><br>Look back at S1 how happy she looked whenever Yukino would tell her to fuck off and how she would do things for herself.<br>This Yukino doesn't do anything, she just stands there looking down, taking whatever she keeps throwing at her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason why I don't think the first memorandum is 8man's is due to this line:<br><br> In that book, it felt as if I was getting dragged to the surface, as if my true nature that I was still continuing to hide to this day was getting exposed. <br><br>Unlike the protagonist of No Longer Human, 8man is capable of revealing his true self to others and he is not forced to uphold a facade. Hayama on the other hand fits that description perfectly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is pointing out how they are dancing around their feelings for each other to keep things from falling apart despite their supposed decision to be genuine with each other.</br>  <br>He's the only left who has read that book aside from Yukino, but I don't think that's her.</br>  I don't know guys. I still think theres only one author, and you didn't even look at her because she pretended not to know the book. But I'm no expert. Gnight.  <br> Yui <br> reading such a depressing book <br>Is something wrong with her.<br><br> Night Anon. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>And I love it when 8man said that Iroha's problem will eventually become his problem. Such siscon.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck everything</br>  <br>When he told his little sister he loves her, she literally told him to fuck off and she doesn't feel that way.

</br>  She takes her member out, tracing down Yukino's skin with her other hand, she can feel the muscles beneath tense and ease.<br>She pinches and pulls on Yukino's pajama bottoms and slices open a circular hole.<br>She feels a pocket steam rush out and finds a translucent string had formed between her thumb and index finger.<br>She licks her fingers clean, pushes Yukino back, and snaps a couple of pictures.<br>She slaps her cock around Yukino's cleanly shaven pubic area and hits her clit, making Yukino wince.<br>She asks if Yukino is a virgin and she nods again.<br>She congratulates Yukino on having her virginity taken away on camera because most girls don't get the opportunity.<br>She focuses on Yukino's pained expressions as she enters her.<br>She warns Yukino, if they don't cum together she'd get punished.<br>Of course, Yukino finishes first, after giving up on holding back for 3 minutes.<br>She rips the hole wider, puts yukino's legs upon her shoulders, and transfers Yukino's fluids to her ass with the tip of the strap-on.<br>She guides the tip in, grabs a hold of Yukino's ankles, and uses her whole body weight to pin her legs at the sides of her head.<br>She lets go of one to start filming Yukino in this pile-driver position.<br>She forces the rest of the strap-on into her and basks at the sight her little sister exhaustively trying to take the pain.<br>Yukino quickly goes limp and Haruno goes crazy.<br>Haruno let's go of the other leg to fiddle with Yukino's clit.<br>Yukino begins to convulse again.<br>Haruno stops and holds onto her waist to increase the force of her thrusts.<br>Yukino orgasms and loses control.<br>Haruno raises her hips up higher to watch her sister wet her own face.<br>Post double orgasm Yukino's clit is quite sensitive and shows when Haruno teases it to the point Yukino is screaming.<br>Haruno makes her cum for the third time with her mouth and makes sure Yukino tastes the juices left on her tongue.<br>She takes a couple of more pictures of a broken Yukino laying in her juices, tucks her into bed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Senseifags are the worst <br>Probably an Irohafag excersising his sense or irony.</br></br>  <br> Gratuituous attack to Irohafags <br>Yukinofag right?</br></br>  <br> smoking <br> drinking <br> sport car <br><br> pure <br><br>more like she going to bar and having ONS every night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, Yukinofag.</br>  <br>From what we've seen she spends her time alone in public places and Karaoke bars then runs out crying when she sees couples.<br>At night she gets drunk alone in her own room/house.</br></br>  <br>You'd have been right if you only said this<br> tits <br> overworked <br><br>She is genetically superior for looking so young and surviving the ravages of tobacco use on the skin.<br>Only someone with shit taste wouldn't want to help her carry on her genetic code.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so it's not every night<br><br>I correct my statement, it should be  Every weekend when she can't stand the loneliness anymore </br></br></br>  So usually I'm an anime-only fag, but goddamn do I want to dive more into this series.

I’mma pretty darn sure I’d fall for her first trap had I been the same as my pure and younger self, ya know…? <br><br>Re reading 10.5 chap 2 again, this sentence remind me of that spoonfeeding + secret cookies scenes. Like with sensei, 8man sure likes using convenience excuses to "avoid falling in love with" them. I wonder if Iroha is revealed to like him instead, how would he react to it? Freak out and get in full denial mode? Nandatte and "you are just joking"?</br></br>  <br> N-nice one Isshiki! Hayama will sure fall for you this time. Now if you excuse, I am busy thinking about Komachi and Chiba </br>  <br>Then how about Iroha just processed and gave him a kiss, how would 8man react to that?</br>  <br> Nice to know that you're practicing for Hayama! Now if you would excuse me I need to go write a beauty sonnet for the next time Yukino blinks at me </br>  <br>I just want you to know, even when I'm a day late to the threads, I'm always cheering you on, Good Irohanon.</br>  <br> T-this reminds be of when I had Komachi in my arms when she was 3, I lost balance because of a small earthquake and our lips end up touching. Don't worry, this was an accident, no tongues involved, but you should be more careful from now on, although it would totally work with Hayama. And Chiba handles earthquakes pretty well, I'm pride of being a Chiba citizen, brb buying MAX Coffee </br>  <br>10/10 completely resembles 8man's thought.</br>  I think 8man should help Yukino fix her problems sexually. That way she would get romantic development while also gaining the ability to deal with her identity issues.  <br>I think 8man should help Yukino by fucking Haruno in front of her.

So we gentlemen (not like you just want to trashing Iroha) respect his wish and wish him good luck.<br><br> Because no other people would like a disgusting fujoshi. </br></br></br>  <br>This is why Iroha x Zaimokuza is so much better.

If Hayato can't be who he wants to be at the very least his sacrifice should be recognized; he needs a friend whom he can confide and be genuine with.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, what a poor and tortured soul, let's all feel bad for the edgy Hayama cunt.</br>  What if Yui had an ahoge?  <br><br>Taken from his memorandum<br><br> That maybe if it was this book or that maybe if it was that person who was unusually more sensitive to the evils of people, I thought, perhaps, they might find me. Perhaps they might see right through me. <br> Yet, despite looking at the things that were so close to me, despite seeing right through everything else, I was the only one who wasn’t looked at. <br> It was so much more painful than being admonished and being looked down on. <br><br>It's quite sad actually, he knows he's always been in an endless cycle of self-deprecation. He knows he's helping other people to keep an altruistic image but he wants someone to call him out for it.

It's like Yukinofags wanting Yui to be there to be the third wheel for Yukino x 8man  <br>It's just that inferior girls need to share a thread.</br>  <br>Who has the image of Yukino saying that if she's the 3rd wheel then she'll leave (from Ep 13, aquarium date)</br>  <br>True best girl incoming.</br>  If Hikki and Yukinon knew each other as kids I bet she would have bullied him calling him Hikifroggy.

What is a "coming of age picture?"  <br>If Hikki and Yui knew each other as kids, Hikki would probably confess to her and  she would reject him nicely ;_; </br>  <br>So she would be the source of his trauma to nice girls</br>  can we just appreciate all girls and not hate anyone? it would be such a waste to hate on these beautiful human beings. also someone has such a wallpaper for yui?  <br>She probably would have called him that but not in a bullying matter.<br>She didn't have the capacity to bully back then.</br></br>  <br>unless he saves her dog</br>  <br><br>It was always going to end like this.</br></br>  <br>How would Sable orchestrate the YuiHikki ship if they knew each other as kids?</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Please some kind Irohabro make a collage of her like this</br>  Why does Yukino end most of her sentences with "kashira"?  <br>It's like a english "right?".</br>  <br>He wouldn't even try because he knows childhood friend could never win</br>  Do we know exactly how old the characters or do we only know when their birthdays are?  <br>If we assume that it's happening at the same time as us, we can assume they're born from around 1996-1998<br>I'm not sure about specific ages though</br></br>  <br>It makes her cute.</br>  <br>Birthday + the grade they are in are enough to know their ages</br>  <br>some of the birthdays are on the oregairu wiki</br>  <br> Hachiman 16-17 <br> Yukino 17 <br> Yui 16 <br><br> If these ages were set during the early volumes then wouldn't their current ages be Yukino being 18 and Yui 17?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Hachiman does mention Yukino being the same age as him during Destinyland, it could be that she's the oldest in the club.</br></br>  <br>yes, Iroha's is exactly 8 months 8 days apart from 8man's.</br>   8man's working part time at a restaurant while going to college. <br> Hasn't seen the club members in several years. <br> "Yahallo!" <br> Turns around and sees Haruno <br> They start talking and she starts teasing him about how he's become boring <br> The next day she's back and they continue exchange banter <br> this repeats every day he has work for the next month <br> one day she doesn't come in. <br> 8man thinks she must finally have gotten bored with their conversations  <br> She's waiting for him outside after he gets off of work <br> she tells him he's taking her on a date <br> they get dinner and Haruno mentions in passing how everyone she knows is getting married <br> she drinks to much <br> 8man takes her to her apartment and is about to leave <br> She grabs his sleeve and asks him to stay <br> he tries to make an excuse to go <br> "Is it because I'm a dried up old onee-san?" <br> 8man tries to say something <br> drunk Haruno sloppily kisses him, mostly missing and kind of licking his cheek <br> 8man pushes her back and see's she's starting to tear up. <br> for the first time he see's Haruno not as a calculating manipulator but as a lonely unmarried woman in her late 20s <br> he ends up following her into the apartment <br> Haruno tries to drunkenly kiss him more <br> they collapse onto her bed <br> she passes out before anything can happen <br> 8man's about to sneak out but sees an invitation to Hayato and Yukino's wedding <br> he understands Haruno's behavior and what leaving would mean to her <br> he goes back to the bed and falls asleep embracing Haruno </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek.<br>Yui is the oldest and Yukino is the youngest.</br></br>  <br>Do you have any actual evidence of that aside from Yui asking if he prefers older girls?<br>We have no numbers.</br></br>  <br>Yui is older than 8man and Yukino<br>That's why she said 8 would be good wit older girls while Yukino agreed with Iroha that he liked hem younger</br></br>  <br> Isshiki’s really only about eight months away from me and three months from Yukinoshita. <br><br>8man says this on Vol. 11 ch. 1<br><br>So that means that this is how it goes:<br><br>Iroha: 4/16/2015<br>Yukino: 1/02/2015<br>8man: 8/08/2014<br>Yui: 06/24/2014</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess that makes sense then.</br>  The only thing Krillin ever accomplished in Dragon Ball Z was having sex with an android  <br>thats more than you did</br>  <br>Well she was the 2D sex dream of an entire generation, and he fucked her.</br>  <br>She fucked him.</br>  <br>Living proof that it doesn't take much to be a great man.</br>  <br>truly a hero</br>  <br>He accomplished more than Yamcha</br>    He became the strongest human.  <br><br>True</br></br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>He was able to get to the semi-finals in two of the tournaments. <br><br>He was also able to kill the most saibamen. <br><br>Can't think of anything else</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Tien is the strongest human. He was stronger than krillen throughout dragon ball, and in Z he has king kai training, held off 2nd stage cell, and is always off training while krillen chills out with roshi. <br><br>Don't give me that triclops shit either. It doesn't matter why he has 3 eyes he's still human species even if he's a different race or has a mutation or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>He also killed Cell.</br>  <br> Tien is the strongest human. <br>Not according to Toriyama and SJump</br></br>  <br>I know right. He was laughing pretty hard when krillen showed up to the games.</br>  <br>so the animal mans are also humans ?</br>  <br>Krillin is stronger, but Tien is an alien.</br>  Krillin repeatedly saved other Z-fighters. Gohan would be dead, Goku would be double dead for the second time, Piccolo would be dead again, etc.<br><br>Although he never really beat anyone he was far more use than practically anyone else.</br></br>  i read tien is human but a hybrid from third-eye-clan  <br>Fuck what toriyama says. He's played it fast and loose since day one. If he said puar was stronger than god goku tomorrow that might make it canon but it still would make no sense in the actual context of the work and story mechanics established. And superman can lift 200 quintillion tons with one arm and the flash has attosecond reaction time too, right.</br>  <br>Fucker could grow extra arms<br>That ain't human<br>No fucking way Chiaotzu is human either<br>Freaks of a feather flock together I guess</br></br></br></br>  <br>and Goku would never have become a super saiyan without krillin  or at least not for a while, assuming he somehow survived the fight with Frieza without going SSJ </br>  <br> Not according to Toriyama and SJump <br>Toriyama has never said that Kuririn is stronger than Tenshinhan. He did once in an interview casually go along after someone else said that Kuririn is the strongest human, but come on, Tenshinhan is a minor character that easily might not have been in his mind.<br><br>Look at his actual work. Most recently, Kuririn almost gets killed by Freeza's soldiers during the forest part of the battle in RoF, beaten up and thrown on the ground, and had to be rescued by Gohan, while Tenshinhan had no problem at all during the battle in spite of getting tired towards the ending.</br></br></br></br>  found this http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Th<wbr>e_Top_Earthling_Tournament</wbr>  <br>I don't have words for such stupidity. Take a remedial biology class, faggot.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Go watch/read Dragonball, fagets. Tien is human. Not even animal-man. Just human.<br><br>Toriyama said Krillin was stronger though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>krillin is so virile he impregnated a robot</br></br>  <br>Show me where it says he's alien or anything other than a human with 3 eyes.</br>  <br> Using the Japanese names </br>  <br>do you think krillin ever kicks out roshi for the night when him and 18 are having sex. i bet he'll be playing with his dick</br>  <br> Tien is human <br>But all evidence implies the contrary.</br></br>  <br> I can't grow extra arms. <br>Not enough training anon. Do you even lift?</br></br>  <br>Oh, but all that flying and shit was normal human behavior for videl, krillen, etc. It's called a technique and there's all sorts of whacky shit that happens in dragonball chalked up to a special move.</br>  <br> Go watch/read Dragonball, fagets. Tien is human. Not even animal-man. Just human. <br>The Tenshinhan is descendant from the three eye race thing comes from the Daizenshuu. Most of the extra backstory information in the Daizenshuu came from Toriyama, although that bit specifically isn't outright said to come from him. Still, it sounds way too random to have been made up by Daizenshuu's editors.</br></br>  <br>I'm not North American, those are the names used by my county's dub too.</br>  <br>Chi focus vs some reptilian like/equivalent limb growing thing<br><br>Care to try again?</br></br></br>  <br>Flying is caused by Chi.<br><br>Can Chi turn into solid matter and make arms?</br></br></br>  <br> it turns out Puar is a god of creation or something but got severe amnesia and forgot how to pack a punch <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just to get this straight, are we considering Tien human or not? Although the dividing line for what a species is can be hand wavy, we need to pick some dividing line and saw whether or not he's human. At first I figured he could probably breed with humans and have kids that are potent, but Saiyans can do that too so we can't use that logic  plus Tien will never have kids .<br><br>Can we all agree that Tien and Krillin are in 1st or 2nd or 2nd and 1st place for strongest human-looking thing that lives on Earth that isn't a Saiyan? We could also go by merit, right? Krillin got an essentially no work powerup on Namek, did Tien ever get one of those? Or did he just work himself? That isn't to say that Krillin wouldn't do the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Krillin is human.<br><br>Krillin can split into multiple people.</br></br></br>  <br>Krillin and Tien are probably the two strongest not-saiyans born on Earth.</br>  <br>Tien is definitely human. Krillen vs. Tien is up for debate, but Tien is and always has been human.</br>  <br> Can we all agree that Tien and Krillin are in 1st or 2nd or 2nd and 1st place for strongest human-looking thing that lives on Earth that isn't a Saiyan? <br>There's still Piccolo and the Androids.</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly Krillen saved many Z warrior's lives and, his most consistent contribution, was buying time. This basically led to victory in every Z arc except for Buu.</br></br>  <br> take a biology class on animals that don't exist <br><br>also if you took a biology class, you should have learned that there are different ways of classifying species. If the animal man had an "animal/nonhuman" parent and a human parent  first of all the fact that they could successfully produce offspring is amazing , and if they produce fertile offspring, that is one way to classify a species. There are otherways I'm sure but I don't know them</br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean worldwide names. Only USA used bullshit like "Krilin". Seriously, what the fuck?</br></br>    <br>What evidence? List it specifically so I can tell you exactly why you're full of shit in a tidy fashion.</br>  <br> using chi to speed up and control with great precsion the cell division process a billion fold to sprout extra arms <br><br>there, a bullshit worthy explanation</br></br></br>  <br> ARMS </br>   no one ever remembers this       <br>Maybe they thought Kuririn would be more difficult to say than Krillin  which for me it is </br>  <br> please krillin don't fuck up <br> fucks up <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good merciful heavens, her hands!</br></br>  <br>It was a technique, Krillin and Piccolo can also use it.<br><br>Tenshinhan's friends love plagiarizing his more useful techniques, save for his Kikoho, because it sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing different about tien from the other humans is his 3rd eye. How is a single mutation enough to classify as a different species? Race, maybe if there's a lot of 3 eyed people wandering about because of inbreeding and passing the gene around enough, but not a species. There have been human beings born in real life with 3 eyes, 6+fingers, tails, etc, but scientists wouldn't say they aren't human.</br>  <br>Namekians can do it because they are fucking lizard alien people.</br>      <br>He shoot it while Vegeta had his back turned to him, it was the perfect opportunity, too bad Vegeta's mind's eye was too strong. But it wasn't his fault that it missed.</br>  <br><br><br><br>A bald midget is married to that. <br><br>What is it with anime girls falling for the guy after he saves her?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They should've plagiarized the Kikohou too. Shit's crazy powerful and can be spammed if somehow a single one of them fails to utterly annihilate the enemy</br></br>  <br>Cyborg you retard, a cyborg.</br>  <br> http://vocaroo.com/i/s13j0Ri5ikQQ </br>  <br> It was a technique, Krillin and Piccolo can also use it. <br>And aren't you thinking about the copies (and even so that's anime only)? I don't think Kuririn or Piccolo ever used multiple arms even in the anime.</br></br>  <br>And he couldn't even do that right. She wasn't actually an android.</br>  <br>russian?</br>  He also accomplished getting one of the freakist AA2 cards I've ever seen.  <br>Regardless of his relative power level compared to the other characters he is one of the strongest humans in the universe. <br>That alone is a pretty decent achievement.</br></br>  Remember when Yajirobe was the strongest human? Too bad he's a fat lazy piece of shit.  <br> Yugoslavian. </br>    <br>eh, close enough<br><br>I'm a slav myself, too. I can recognize other slavs.</br></br></br>    <br>I like how he has no fucking back story or explanation at all yet he's somehow on par with Goku and Tien when he's introduced as a random guy in the woods.</br>  <br>What was she then? A cyborg?</br>  <br><br>Goku actually says that he's the strongest person he ever met, so he was even physically stronger than Tenshinhan (although didn't have any special techniques at all, so likely could lose in a battle).</br></br>  <br>They didn't use tri-beam either, but ofcourse they could have learned it. The reason everyone doesn't just start growing 4 arms and using that technique is probably because toriyama thought it was too stupid to pass around like he did with solar flair and the kamehameha.</br>  <br> anime girls falling for guy after being saved <br> what is shonen <br>Excellently written women</br></br></br>  <br> Midget <br>The term you're looking for is "manlet."</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Yamcha the only person to actually capitalize on the fact that he's stronger than everyone on the planet barring the other Z fighters? I mean, he was basically cheating but got to be a rich baseball player who fucked hot bitches every night.</br>  <br>If not him, Frieza would not use his double kienzan and cut himself in half, keeping Goku long enough on planet to explode with him still on it.<br><br>He possibly kept Vegeta and Nappa from destroying Earth long enough for Goku arrival. Yes, I know he wasn't the only one, but if he were not there, Gohan would be dead before Goku would get there and they would be long time gone.<br><br>He fucked 18.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, but had goku stayed too long after killing freezer in some other way he would have lived through the explosion, acted like he was going to suffocate for a minute and had a laugh after he realizes he could breathe in space.</br>  <br>Then what should we call Goku?

The last week was the hardest one for the group in years (I lost my credit card, Paypal without funds, my PC crashed and it is still broken). Very well, I'm writting this just to let you know that our website is online again, and we'll still scanlating Prison School, but please be patient 'till the weekend. <br><br>That weekend is already past.

Manga is where its at and the sources are dying one after another.</br>  <br><br>At least grinding all those Kanji can help a bit with Chinese.</br></br>  <br>What if hes right</br>  <br>I can't hear you.</br>  I want to tell Hana she's beautiful and go on a date with her.  <br><br> having a waifu for each seperate anime <br>fucking disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>And then I'll excuse to go to the restroom and she insists to go together.</br>  <br><br>Kinky. She will probably develop a fetish for having sex in places where people might run into them. After all, that's what happened every time she interacted with Kiyoshi.</br></br>  How are you supposed to not get a boner to piss while is staring at it when you are unzipping?<br>Just look at her turned on lewd face.</br>  Anime-only friend here, so how pure are the girls in the manga? They don't fuck or anything, r-right?  <br>There are no pure girls except for Cake-chan<br> But Hana is still a best </br></br>  <br>In which she had gay sex with Kate</br>  <br><br>You should go back to watching slice-of-life moe garbage if you care about "muh pure waifu" characters.</br></br>  <br> Cake-chan <br> pure </br></br>  <br><br> turned on lewd face <br>nope, seems like you're totally missing the point of this character</br></br></br>  <br>She's the purest you can get in PS, but she's kinda tame in comparison with the rest</br>  <br>I've didn't progress too much on the manga, wanted to check it before starting the anime.</br>  <br>I...

Miia's family life includes doing all kinds of fun activities in and around the house. Cerea's family activities are just walking around a grassy field. Because she's a fucking horse, with a fucking horse pussy.</br></br>  <br>loliconder</br>  <br> don't worry about betrayal, brother.

It seems like there jealous or something?  <br>I don't hate her, I love her personality. Her body is objectively the worst though.<br><br>First of all she's huge and unwieldy. Miia is huge too, but at least she's flexible. She needs a lot of space but it's managable. Cerea needs a fucking stable.<br><br>Speaking of stables, Cerea smells like one too. Snakes don't stink, birds don't stink, non-dead fish don't stink but horses do.<br><br>Thirdly, she is the only monster girl of the main harem you can't look in the eyes or cuddle with while making love. Hell, you can't even fit Cerea in your bed. <br><br>If Cerea were a Dullahan, a minotaur or literally any other kind of monster girl, she'd be top tier. She'd be a worthy rival to Miia and Rachnee (who are the only real contenders in the Darlingbowl).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There jealous anon because she is popular</br>  <br> Rachnee <br>Does she not have the same lovemaking issue as Cerea?</br></br>  <br>Still more flexible than Cerea, also her fun bits are in the front and (presumably) human.</br>  <br><br>Also remember that Rachnee has really great self-control compared to the rest of the girls. I'd half-expect Cerea to accidentally kick Darling in the stomach while he's fucking her.</br></br>  <br>I can't get over the horse pussy part. I don't see much of a difference between fucking her and fucking your average horse. At least Miia and Papi have human vaginas and I've stuck my dick in jello before so Suu is covered.</br>  <br>Whoa, not that anon but what does Doppel have to do with this?</br>  <br>Eh you get used to it.</br>  <br>Why is the to differently colored?</br>  <br>pretty sure she has a human vagina.</br>  <br>Lucky.</br>  <br>There jealous of the centaur master race</br>    No cute Kobold that forces me to get /fit and motivate me through it all   <br> Miia is huge too, but at least she's flexible. She needs a lot of space but it's managable. Cerea needs a fucking stable. <br>Miia is the least manageable of them all. Even coiled she would occupy as much surface as Cerea if not more (look how they had to prepare a special scale for measuring her weight). When walking in a city you should be careful everytime her 7m tail doesn't cause a car accident..<br> Speaking of stables, Cerea smells like one too. Snakes don't stink, birds don't stink, non-dead fish don't stink but horses do. <br>This only has been said by two people (miia and that bitchy brat) who were trying to bully her. That's no confirmation at all. <br><br> She'd be a worthy rival to Miia and Rachnee (who are the only real contenders in the Darlingbowl). <br>If you're so sure about that why are you Miia/rachnefags in such a hurry of throwing shit to Cerea everytime you can?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can always force yourself, keeping in mind that you do it for her.</br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I also don't have a Kobold to motivate me.</br>  <br>Just thought of the worst waifu I could think of<br> I dont really mean that. I didn't mean to insult doppel I was just mad at being called out for being a faggot </br></br>  <br>Wrong thread, you are looking for narufag threads.</br>  <br>Mero in Spanish Inquisition robes when?</br>  <br>The brat wasn't trying to bully Cerea, she was just speaking her mind. She had no incentive to lie, so it's probably true.<br><br>They're not even making fun of Cerea specifically, they're literally just saying that centaurs are a pain to deal with.</br></br></br>  Hello gentlemen, once again here to explore your feelings towards monster girls  <br> insert costanza_shrinkage.jpg here </br>  <br>WHEN I WAS YOUNG MY MOM GOT KILLED BY A SNAKE SO THIS CARTOON IS A GOOD WAY FOR ME TO EXPRESS MY SEXUAL INTEREST IN BOTH PARTIES</br>  <br>Seems completely rational</br>  <br>Miia, aka one and only best girl</br>  <br>How come I want boobies in my face doc?</br>  <br> DAT sexy farmers daughter outfit on Snek <br>Hello /a/a, my name is Anon and I am a   Spider  fag.

Insult me mom again and I'll dig your grave and jam a sledgehammer up yer cold dead arse.</br>  <br>Because you have unexplored hatred towards your father. Motorboating is the first step towards a healthy lifestyle</br>  <br>It all makes sense actually.</br>  <br>And how would that make you feel? Would that somehow resolve your repressed fears of commitment?</br>  <br> birds don't stink <br> non-dead fish don't stink <br>You have no idea what you're talking about.</br></br></br>  <br> shrinkage <br>I find it hilarious how even today, very few women know about shrinkage. I might bring that up tomorrow night at a party, see how many girls know about it. Their reaction hearing about it is always priceless.</br></br>  <br>How come prefer oneesans, doc? I've had no older sisters nor female cousins as I grew up.</br>  Im going to start showing some images and I want you to say the first thing that comes to your mind. Lets start with a personal favorite of mine  <br>Believe me, I fucking hate the smell of fish, but most people like myself only smell fish that's been dead for days. Living fish aren't that bad.</br>  <br> They're not even making fun of Cerea specifically, they're literally just saying that centaurs are a pain to deal with. <br>Yeah, like, every single thread. With a dedication akin to the Polt/MS Smith shitposters. I've not seen any thread without them posting about horse pussy being too loose or that she can't clean her ass, even when that copypasta proving them wrong has been posted to death.</br></br>  <br> dat nose  <br>Auugghhh</br></br>  <br><br>Well today Rachnee moved up the ladder for me.</br></br>  <br>No, it would only make me feel a transient and ephemeral feeling of gaiety and elation, that of which all Mankind blindly pursue before I sink back into depression, knowing that Death is a mysterious horizon of which we can never fully explore, even with all our accumulated knowledge and accomplishments.<br><br>Thank you, Freud. You've given me strength  without insulting me mum. </br></br></br>  <br> that face <br>Terribly drawn.</br></br>  <br>You answered your own question my friend. Your inexperience with such siblings have given you an attraction towards them.</br>  <br>"Who drew that face?"</br>    *Taking notes* As expected, posters are expressing distaste in poor facial art rather the subject in question.<br><br>Glad to hear, that will be 200 dollars</br></br>  <br>I have a onee-chan, and I love onee-chans. What does that mean?</br>  <br> Believe me, I fucking hate the smell of fish, but most people like myself only smell fish that's been dead for days. Living fish aren't that bad. <br>Living fish smell far worse than a clean horse</br></br>  <br>Shit art</br>  <br> Clothes <br>Why</br></br>  <br>It may mean you have violet tendencies toward Cerea fans. Tell me about your childhood.</br>  <br>I don't. I actually kind of like cerea myself. She's not best but she's up there.</br>  <br>There's no sense of tautness in the web lines. Too much slack. The upper breasts are okay, but the rest just looks like the webbing is gentle placed on the body parts instead of applying pressure.</br>  <br>Clothes make anything more lewd than just naked.</br>    <br>because mlp was gay 3 years ago, the japs cant change that</br>  <br>*subject shows no hostility, must converse further to indicate any attraction towards horse anatomy, dodges question about childhood*<br>Ahem! well good show my boy on being so understanding. Now lets dive into your thoughts on best girl shall we?</br></br>  <br>Freud-sama, Freud-sama!<br>I like Mama Miia more than Miia, but think Cerea's mom is shit and Papi's mom is only slightly better than Papi.<br><br>What does this mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Breastgurl</br>  <br> MS Smith <br>Is that the latest OS waifu? I did hear that Microsoft launched some new software yesterday.</br></br>  <br>Miia best</br>  <br>That you are more attracted to sexually open women than conservative ones. Mama Miia does not hide her ambitions and her experience heightens your allure towards her</br>  <br>But Freud-sama, IRL I detest slutty women. I'm also a virgin myself who has given up on women because there are simply no good women left. What does this mean? Shouldn't this mean conservative women fit me more?</br>  <br> I'm also a virgin myself who has given up on women because there are simply no good women left. <br>sasuga</br></br>  <br>Woah there, anon. Don't be such a  neigh-sayer </br>  <br>Cruella De Vil</br>  <br>Freud, I have decided to give all the waifus in this show equal amount of love and adoration, and to show no favoritism at all, even though I know it's impossible. What does this say about me, and what should I do?</br>  <br>A perfectly healthy decision my friend. Your a man who isnt easily swayed. <br><br>consciously yes, but you have repressed subconscious desires of the opposite nature. Your primal instincts are trying to bring out another side of you <br><br>Now then, time for the second image: How does this make you feel?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying my subconcious desire is for a slutty older woman? But my socially conservative conciousness would never be happy with that decision, right?<br><br> Now then, time for the second image: How does this make you feel? <br> Suun <br>I think that's real fuckin' cute, nigga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to that idiot. You show that behavior because of your evolutionary need to continue your family line. She shows that she is a good mother ergo, she is attractive.</br>  <br>Panic, like my butthole is about to get a thick tentacle right up the backdoor.</br>  <br>Surprisingly, 'mangosteen' is the first thing that popped into my head.</br>  <br>That is a normal behavior to something that frightens you. Nothing more or less.</br>  <br>That youre a people pleaser who tries to accommodate everyones needs. Be wary however for this leaves little for you and could be psychologically exhausting. In Kimihitos case this results in about 3 near death experiences daily <br><br>correct<br><br>also correct, and displays your social anxiety<br><br>My old foe, we meet again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that got me to giggle, but i still skip every scene with her in it</br>  <br>Every single one of them cucked their husbands with a cute human male</br>  <br>But Skinner-sama, would a slut truly make a good mother when she can't set a proper moral example for a potential child?<br><br><br>Are you implying therefore that my conflict between my subconciousness and counciousness is why I have given up on women? Or are women really just that shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, you skip all the parts with Cerea in it? Why?</br>  <br>Papi's mom is still married to Papi's dad though. As weird as it may be, Papi's mom is the most normal one. She married, raised her daughter, didn't want Darlings dick and told Papi to pursue the man she likes and get married herself. Perfectly normal by human standards.</br>  <br>I think Skinner-sama is going the direct opposite of Freud, which is to say, go for the conservative ones because they have a high probability to be a good mother.</br>  <br>I find it when my patients come to their own conclusions it makes the healing process easier, because in turn they know what they must do and can stop living in denial. Also the session bills become that much sweeter to cash in.</br>  <br>Lala, definitely.</br>  <br>She seem attached to her husband too. I mean, hell she went that far just to get one picture.</br>  <br>I, personally, fail to see how a mother is more "slutty" than a normal person. You can see from the way she acts that she must care for the child which is also very endearing.<br><br>Hello my old friend.

I'm enjoying it so far. Just thought I'd let you guys knowing I'm cumming to future threads. Yes, I'm that important.</br></br></br>  Gakkou Gurashi!  Use the catalog.  <br>You mean the 500+ thread?<br>Oh, I will link to it for reference:<br/></br></br>  <br><br>Regarding the last chapter  I get the feeling that Ruu is just Rii's delusion? Yes, we saw Yuki talking to her, but both of them are equally insane right now. This manga man, you can't believe what you saw. </br></br>  You forgot the "Miki best girl edition".  <br>Aren't panties supposed to go over the garter?</br>  <br>Nice eights!</br>  <br> equally insane <br>Yuki is literally pretending to be retarded at this point, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>It's not a garter belt. It's more like a pantyhose.</br>  Miki = Rick<br>Kurumi = Daryl<br>Rii = Carol<br>Yuki = Deanna</br></br></br>  <br>Why does the world look like a fucking warzone in this? It's like this zombie plague is infecting windows and buildings too.</br>  <br>They're Zerg.</br>  Zombie-sensei will bite dog, who will then turn and bite shovel. Yuki kills dog with baseball bat to protect shovel. Then things happen like the manga  <br>   I get the feeling that Ruu is just Rii's delusion <br><br>suuuuure</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies spawn sledgehammers and attack things when nobody is looking.</br>      This had some very ugly CG.  <br>Haha memes.</br>  <br>Zombies just fucking hate windows, okay? They see their reflections in them and they're all like, "Oh man, I look like shit." so they smash them in fits of rage, and then they get ladders so they can smash the windows that nobody can possibly reach without one.</br>  <br>The childishness of this image is making me sad.</br>  <br>NO ASS<br>O<br><br>A<br>S<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's a boy.</br>  <br>Nippon confirmed for hiring african americans as translators.</br>  <br> that moment just before she collapses in despair after her lover just left out the door.jpg </br>  <br> BIX NOOD Engrish </br>  <br>Stupid meme.<br>I hope she gets pregnant, so it goes away.</br></br>  Helicopter scene when?  <br>Pregnant with who?</br>  I can't unhear "CHIKAI SUGIIIII" in the OP.  Dat fang  <br>Self impregnation is not uncommon during periods of environmental pressure.</br>  <br> Taroumaru's half-human abominations </br>  What the fuck was with that sappy ED? What was the point of replaying everything we already saw in the same episode and slapping a grainy filter on it?  <br> Taroumaru somehow becomes human   shota  and ends up fucking everyone except Miki<br> Miki rapes shota-Taroumaru </br></br>  <br>Yuribait.</br>  Oh Japan.<br> CD album <br> CD player <br><br>It's cute to see this country resisting the march of progress. It still refuses to consider digital download when muh FLAC is at parity with CD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was outright pointed out that it's old fashioned.</br>    Why do so many people hate sports anime?  <br>They're literally DBZ with uniforms.</br>  Because they've never tried one. They think sports anime are like live action sport casts plus gay subtext.  <br>Because they're asthmatics who can't do sports themselves.</br>  <br>Basically this. Trying to enjoy sports anime as an actual fan of sports is rather tedious. It speaks volumes that you can unironically add Loliball to a top 10 of the most realistic sport anime.</br>  I remember seeing a football (or soccer for the americunts) anime, and they were kicking the fucking balls with dragons and tigers and shit. <br><br><br>if there's an anime that shows how hard it is and how great it feels when you win, tell me</br></br></br>  Too many sport anime with fucking super powers put people off.   karuta <br> sport </br>  <br>Was it Captain Tsubasa</br>  <br>Nah man Yawara! at least is more like if One Punch Man a cute girl talented at Judo.</br>  <br>It was probably Inazuma Eleven.</br>  <br>Reminder that that is just Highschool level.</br>   Free <br> sports </br>  <br>Yeah, this. Isn't there a normal anime like Free? I watched the first season, and was pretty decent. Sure, there were a few homo moments, but it was really nice.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, that's the one. I didn't watch it myself, but have seen it a couple of times here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Slam Dunk and other Inoue takehito basketball manga are pretty good. <br><br>Same with ping pong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haikyuu has flashy animations, but no superpowers.</br>  <br><br><br>You don't know jackshit.<br>I'm not going to argue this point with you. If you are open minded and curious about what you are missing, try Slam Dunk, which may be the best sports manga of all time.<br>I prefer the manga, but I can understand if you go for the anime. Afterwards you are welcome to discuss sports anime on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are don't watch actually good sports anime and end up thinking like <br><br>There are some (very few, but still) incredibly fun sports anime and manga. Slam Dunk is good, Free is good, Baby Steps is good, and I don't know anyone who has read Smash but it's good as well.</br></br></br>  <br>It's<br>Fucking<br>Boring</br></br></br>  <br> put ball in goal <br> interesting to watch <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Free is good </br>  <br>Its much more realistic than Kuruko that's for sure.</br>  PSA: watch Chihayafuru  <br> fight faggots with swords <br> fuck generic sluts <br> interesting to watch <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br></br>  Because they have plebeian taste.  <br>/thread</br>  <br> mad because muh sports </br>  <br>Well, you don't make it ONLY for that part.<br><br>You write about the character relationships, the fun they're having, the training....<br><br>If you can write it well, you'll have a lot of fans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> put money in bank account <br> interesting to live <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he simplified your anime the same way you simplified his.</br>  <br> character relationships, the fun they're having, the training <br> any different than watching espn sports center </br></br>  <br> PoT in a single sentence </br>  <br>The beginning was different.<br>At the start it was a smug shota beating bishonen at tennis with a hint of a girl at the sideline.</br></br>  <br> karuta <br> sport </br></br>  <br>That's what anime is for.</br>  <br>dumb frogposter</br>  <br>First post already hit the jackpot.</br>  <br>Fuck all of those in OP's pic, Eyeshield 21 best sports anime.</br>  <br>I just can't image how is it possible to play PRO level tennis without destroying one big city</br>  Free is about the power of friendship, and that being able to swim with friends is the answer to everything  For anime like kuroko, I watch it for fun. Im not a fan of basketball but rainbow superpower basketball is more enjoyable for me.<br><br>I also like Real which is more of a drama with wheelchair basketball for a serious sports manga. I recommend it.</br></br>  <br> literally every Shonen Jump series ever </br>  <br>Well, the manga at least. Didn't they end the anime before they even made it to the Christmas Bowl?<br><br>Also Kyoshin best team</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't watch the anime, but the Christmas Bowl was shitty as fuck and everything post-CB was even worse.</br>  <br>The trips know<br><br>Free was slice of life, not sports.</br></br></br>  <br> D.gray-man </br>  Free season 2 was a trainwreck of tears and emotions and less about swimming. They just piled anxiety on anxiety for the characters.  <br>Ace of Diamond doesn't really have super powers, rather talents I suppose in specific areas of play.<br>Chihayafuru is pretty normal outside of maybe... really good hearing?<br>And I'm pretty sure Baby Steps is also one.<br>At least nothing along the lines of something like Kuroko no Basket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are fags. Also, tons of sport mange are just battle shonen written by people who have never played the sports they portray.</br>  <br>The only superpower they have in Baby Steps is being able to rethink their strategy in the roughly 20 seconds between serves.</br>  <br>Baby Steps' MC has god eyes and at least one of the other characters has an unexplained bullshit shot  fucking Iwasa .<br><br>It's still not as retarded as Kuroko, that's for sure.</br></br></br>  I actually wish there were more extreme sports anime. Something along the lines of Air Gear. I was never into sports when I was younger but skateboarding and the like was my activity. I still watch x-sports on espn whenever I can.  <br><br>Ah I see. I said pretty sure because I only recently started watching it and people have told me it wasn't anything super power like Kuroko.</br></br>  <br> Air Gear <br> Sport <br> Not Technoable/Pseudoscience porn with T&amp;A </br></br></br>  <br>Why is there still no anime about hockey? That sport is pretty danerous</br>  <br>If you want to get down to it:<br>Superpower 1:<br>Super eyes.<br>Superpower 2:<br>Super learning.<br>Superpower 3:<br>Super girlfriend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But anon swimming is a sport</br>  <br>The best part is that the umpire is often calling them on the time, so it really looks like only 20 seconds have passed.</br>  <br>They hate what they can't understand or be remotely good at.<br><br>Even fucking /r9k/ (old and current) is better at sports than /a/ is.</br></br></br>  <br> Super girlfriend. <br> Didn't even win All-Japan </br></br>  <br>Same reason I don't watch real sports.<br><br>T&amp;A, moe, super powers, etc can't make boring shit source material any less boring.</br></br></br>  <br> Super Girlfriend <br>Well. Okay. I will watch and see what this means.</br></br>  <br>Haha it is 100% "technoable/pseudoscience porn with T&amp;A", but the premise of the show where teams battled using x-sport-esque themes really appealed to me. It was more ecchi than I wanted... <br><br>It's the main reason I watched Eureka 7, I thought hover boards and giant robots, what could go wrong. All I got was some fucking 14 year olds falling in love that had adopted kids that made me want to stab my eyes out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've always wanted to read a Lacrosse manga.</br></br>  <br> It's the main reason I watched Eureka 7, I thought hover boards and giant robots, what could go wrong. <br>You went aboard the wrong boat.</br></br>  It really depends on who the target audience is for the series.<br><br>Keep in mind, sports anime is to fujos what mahou shoujo is to their male equivalents. Played straight, it seems to be designed for one crowd, but it always has a niche appeal with a completely different crowd, so sometimes they create a series to pander to one over the other.<br><br>I mean like, I fucking love Haikyuu, but I could never get into any of their threads without having to deal with "post sexy thighs" shit. It's fucking annoying and completely incongruous with why I'm watching, and for many people that just turns them off to the entire genre altogether.<br><br>If it was only about sports guys being sporty and enjoying sports competitions revolving around how sports work, it'd probably be much more tolerable. But since it's more profitable to give a little fanservice or ambiguity to feed yaoi shippers, the genre as a whole will never change in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> I have literally never watched any sports anime <br>It applies to a small minority of series, do you seriously think everything is Kurobas and PoT?<br><br>Read fucking Ashita No Joe or Slam Dunk or Rookies, or even just pick at random and it will more likely than not be completely superpower free.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Keep in mind, sports anime is to fujos what mahou shoujo is to their male equivalents. <br>Fuck, I was gonna argue this on the basis of being extremely ridiculous, but after considering it I think you might actually have a point. Why did I never realize this before?</br></br>  Probably because they don't like sports irl or they haven't seen one about a sport they're interested in. Although I don't like many sports irl but I still get a kick out of the anime that have good characters with fun interactions and shit.  <br> you might actually have a point. <br>If he has a point, he has to avoid every manga with a predominantly male cast that isn't muscle-max like Dragonball, so basically 95% of all semi-current shonen, almost all shojo and a good deal of everything else.<br>He has no point. He's just prejudiced.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Real athletes aren't all that interesting or likeable.</br>  <br>Neither are fictional ones.</br>  <br> If it was only about sports guys being sporty and enjoying sports competitions revolving around how sports work <br>That would still result in fujos talking about sexy thighs. There is really not as much pandering as you might think anyway.</br></br>  <br>/thread over a comment that has literally no accuracy to it considering sports shounen almost always has an all male cast with no t&amp;a or moe, and super powers only feature in a few shows</br>  <br>Fictional ones are likeable.</br>  <br> or moe <br>I was agreeing up to that point.<br>You I think you have no idea what you are talking about.<br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br> being illiterate </br>  <br>Nah I mean, when you think about it, they both revolve around relying on your friends/teammates, having your former enemies become friendly after a defeat is common, and the uniforms are inherently attractive to the opposite gender. It's more than just one thing.</br>  More important question is  which sports anime has the best boys?   <br> Why do so many people hate sports anime? <br>Because people who like anime generally dislike sports. I like both, so I watch it, but most of the anime crowd gets a kick out of beta characters than alpha ones.</br></br>  <br>HxH threads are basically pure homo-shipping, unless they're used for Pitou worship.<br>They might be a bad example, on account of the fanbase having gone to shit, but actually they are a rather good example.<br><br>Shows that have predominantly male casts that are nice to look at (like Magi, to give another title) attract homo-shippers.<br>If you don't like it, do like me and don't participate in threads that aren't for discussion of recent events. But don't try to pretend it's somehow specific to magical girls and sports shows, because it isn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  There needs to be a wrestling anime(not WWF shit)  <br> They might be a bad example <br>*They might SEEM TO be a bad example<br>Fuck, this omission makes my post looks so fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>With John Cena?</br>  <br>The Boys of Freedom.</br>  <br>I'd watch that, but only if John Cena was the protagonist</br>  <br>Tsuyoseka was great</br>  <br>What you actually mean is why does /a/ not talk about them. The answer is because /a/ doesn't talk about good things.</br>  <br> Tsuyoseka <br><br>Google has no results</br></br></br>  Because OP is a faggot.  <br>Because internet geeks aren't supposed to like sports.</br>  This little shit-biscuit is fucking hideous  <br>You misspelled beautiful.</br>  inb4 upsetninja.jpg  FAT PIG SLUT<br>A<br>T<br><br>P<br>I<br>G<br><br>S<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  kill yourself  <br>I want to pet this animal</br>  <br>What the heck is that thingamajig?</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  front page  Let the memes flow.

Manga doesn't get much more noir than this. Benkei is just another expatriate Japanese arist living in the Big Apple. Or so it appears. As there "diabolical hard-boiled stories" show, surfaces aren't always what they seem. Flashbacks delve into sordid, secret past lives, and old scored, long festering, emerge without warning, asking to be settled. And Benkei's secret? Maybe it's just that he's the only artist in town who isn't having fantasies of being a hitman-for-hire. He is one.
