[ More detail summary for Saekano Vol 8 -- https://magnavalon.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/20/saekano-volume-8-a-new-beg<wbr>inning/<br>Let's start WaifuFag war</br></wbr></wbr>  Megumi a shit.  <br>Really? Any proof to call her 'shit' ?</br>  Eriri a shit.  <br>Well it depends on your perspective who is shit anon-san</br>  <br><br>Eriri is the last boss.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and I hope Boring-chan win when she meet last boss</br>  <br>Do you mean Utaha will crush both of them?</br>  Utaha a shit.  <br><br>Utaha is only a side character now.</br></br>  <br>Character got MC's first kiss, is not side character</br>  <br><br>That was her last act before being doomed to irrelevancy. Read volume 8.</br></br>  Let's do this again. Prove that Megumi is not the best girl. <br><br>Hint:  you can't </br></br>  <br> “…..Yes, it’s alright, Senpai. I will make you forget that woman’s words.” <br> “Sawamura-senpai is the worst… Abandoning Tomoya-senpai like that… She deserves a death penalty.” <br> “A proper punishment is necessary… And so this time, I, Izumi Hashima, shall destroy Eriri Spencer Sawamura… Eri Kashiwagi.” <br> “Nope, everyone who stands in Senpai’s way is my enemy.” <br><br>Based Izumi. REMOVE ERIRI.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  10/10 main heroine    <br>Megumi a shit.</br>  Reminder that Megumi has no romantic feelings for Tomoya. <br>Reminder that the author favors girls who share a past with the MC.</br>  When does the anime stop at ?  <br> Eriri* a shit <br><br>Fix'd for truth.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 4.</br>  <br> still saying this after everything that has happened in volume 7 and 8 </br>  <br>Izumi a besto.</br>  <br>Reminder Megumi is his attempt to redo Setsuna.</br>  <br><br>They are nothing alike. From what I remember Setsuna was super manipulative.</br></br>  <br><br>Setsuna was a bitch.</br></br>   “…….Sorry Aki-kun, this game is shit after all. Can I give up?” <br><br>my sides</br></br>  <br> Megumi cussing </br>  <br> you will never play galges at your room with a girl who's only wearing a sweater </br>  Utahafags be butthurt.  <br>Maybe she will strike again in Volume 9. Let's see</br>  <br><br>Doubted it as she seems more like Eriri's sidekick now after reading volume 8.</br></br>  <br>Utaha FTW</br>  <br><br>Her role now is more like a mentor. Eriri is different, she's the rival and thus has more relevance. Now that Utaha outright gave up on Tomoya, it's more like a love triangle.</br></br>  They should make a VN from this; not the Vita game with shitty A-1 illustrations, but a real VN with Misaki Kurehito's art.  <br> she will never sleep in your bed </br>  <br>I wonder if Tomoya gets aroused by her smell when he goes to sleep.</br>  <br>Megumi a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br> Now that Utaha outright gave up on Tomoya <br>when?</br></br>  <br><br>Volume 7. Right after she kisses him, she says that she gives up.</br></br>  <br>Stop spamming already you autistic shit.</br>  <br>That's just a lie</br>  <br>She knows that Megumi will win and it's futile to keep trying.</br>  <br> First post <br> spamming <br>Stay salty.</br></br></br>  <br> post asking people to prove Megumi is not the best girl <br> ignores it <br> just spams "A SHIT" instead <br><br>As I thought. It's impossible to show that she isn't best girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  Utaha a best<br>Megumi is fine too<br><br>The rest are irrelevant</br></br></br>  <br> ignores it <br>Too bad I'm not that guy you replied to, Megumifag. But if you want my thoughts, Megumi is a boring and dull bitch, with an uninteresting design to match.<br><br><br> Stay salty. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a coincidence, those are my exact thoughts about Eriri.</br>  <br><br>I would appreciate those thoughts if they weren't completely baseless.</br></br>  <br> Eriri and Tomoya are still chummy and made up pretty quick <br> Not a heated argument where they shout at each other aggressively <br>Doesn't this make the old summary pretty biased?</br></br></br>  <br>Good for you.<br><br><br>Whatever helps you sleep at night.<br><br><br>Wasn't it obvious? Those summaries were written by a Megumifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi is still best girl by far. It's too bad Utaha has lost most of her importance in the story, I miss her as part of the group. On the upside, that pretty much leaves Megumi as the only real choice for best heroine in the series. Looking forward to the next volume and the possible catfight between Eriri and Megumi.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, the other summary is also written by a Megumifag.</br>  <br><br>The argument was heated enough that they went from texting to shouting in the classroom. Of course they made up quickly, they're childhood friends.</br></br>  <br> Whatever helps you sleep at night. <br><br>So you can't support your assertion that Megumi is boring. Good to know.</br></br></br>  <br>This. And Maruto writing the story.</br>  <br>Eriri making up with everyone. Whoever said before she took a step back in development needs to eat his keyboard.<br><br>She has no chance, but I'm still going to root for Eriri. She and Tomoya are still cute as childhood friends who cares for one another, as seen in their interactions.</br></br></br>  <br> leave the circle <br> still thinks she can decide who joins <br><br>She's still a bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Izumi put her in her place.</br>  Tomoya need to change his vision a bit.<br> Every heroine has great story so you can't decide which one is the main one. <br>Then what he need is to make harem end for his game.</br></br>  <br>Too many small mistakes in the summary.</br>   Megumi asked Tomoya about the date event for sub-heroine 3 where the protagonist leaved the sub-heroine to chase another heroine while the sub-heroine only smiled in front of the protagonist but got angry after he was gone; she asked him if it was based on a real experience. Tomoya said he didn’t remember any experience like that, and Megumi said it must be her imagination after keeping silent for a while. She then asked if he had anything in mind about the scene where sub-heroine 1 and 2 argued against the protagonist’s complaint; Tomoya said it was just a coincidence. Megumi compared the protagonist to the first point Tomoya explained earlier (“hate”). Megumi then brought up about sub-heroine 4’s final story where she fell sick and the protagonist decided to go to her side even though he had an important thing to take care of. Megumi pointed out that the protagonist’s choice gave her an uncomfortable feeling (this is a reference of volume 6’s incident). <br><br>May as well give the MC the same name and face as Tomoya at this rate.</br></br>  <br>The new game is called Saekano you know?</br>  <br><br>Games without a clear main heroine just won't sell.</br></br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>Over sensitive much? Ex-member who made a successful and good game is concerned with randoms she thought were riajuus joining?</br>  “Ah, talking about Tokyo Line, I remembered! You, what did ‘that thing’ mean!?”<br>“What do you mean by ‘that thing’? If you don’t say it straight out, I won’t understand!”<br>“‘That thing’ is ‘that thing’! See, the one… The one you did with Utaha Kasumigaoka!”<br>“Ah, that was… No, that was, see, ‘that thing’, you know, ‘that thing’!”<br>“If you don’t say it clearly, I won’t get it!”<br>“Putting it like that, it’s actually us who don’t really get it, though…”<br>“Ah…”<br>“Ah…”<br><br>Why can't the japanese just speak clearly? What the fuck is up with "That thing"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eriri is just too retarded to make herself clear.</br>  <br><br>Japanese allows you to omit the subject. That, and awkward translation.</br></br>  <br><br>Ex-members don't have a say in the circle. Simple as that.</br></br>  <br>It's none of her concern anymore. She should stick to her own business.</br>  <br> “If you don’t say it clearly, I won’t get it!” <br>This. Most harem MC might be dense, but don't mean girls has no fault.<br> Poor Ichika </br></br></br>  <br>Very awkward translation.</br>  <br><br>Says who? Just because she left doesn't mean she still can't care as a friend or an ex-member. You guys are just trying to say crap for your own convenience. Eriri at least has a point in that non-otakus really shouldn't be joining a Circle seriously.</br></br>  <br><br>The strange part is how he's so dense. How can he forget an event as important as leaving Megumi on a date?</br></br>  <br><br>Megumi was a non-otaku and did fine.</br></br>  <br>Because the only thing he can remember from vol 2 is Utaha sharing a bed with him.</br>  <br>You would have a point if she wasn't combative and entitled. She acts as if she knows it all and everyone should listen to her. But it backfired when the girls turned out to be otaku, she simply couldn't stand being told so badly and ran away.</br>  <br>So was Tomoya, but that's not Eriri's point. Again the summary leaves out the part where Eriri asks Izumi not to drag her friends into this whole mess. And the girls didn't join not because Tomoya was overly excited in his explanations, but because Izumi and him talked too much about how hard being in a doujin circle is.</br>  <br>Eriri was a bit entitled but the one who was combative was Izumi. And she does know it all because of how difficult making the next game will be. Otakus or not, amateurs just won't cut it at this point.</br>  <br>Megumi a Best</br>  Eriri a shit  <br> Eriri was a bit entitled but the one who was combative was Izumi.  <br><br>Of course she would be. An ex-member was trying to interfere with her plans when she had no right to.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the girls didn't mind how hard it would be to make a game and still decided to work in the circle? Either way, it was ultimately Tomoya's choice to make.</br>  <br>Her case is different. She wasn't a creator and was a model for the main heroine. Besides, she was mostly dragged around by Tomoya before she decide to give it a try.<br><br>Also what   said. <br><br>Although I don't see how she was entitled. Eriri was speaking from experience and holds a belief that amateurs or non-otaku shouldn't be join a Circle. Eriri still has a point. In Tomoya's case he was an amateur, but he's a high tier otaku that knows his stuff and that makes him exceptional.<br><br><br>That's a terrible reason and you know it. Look at the way Izumi's character is changing into as noted by other characters. She's going down the yandere path. It is obvious she is being hostile against Eriri for a different reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her actual belief is to stop more girls from getting close to Tomoya.</br>  <br>OP's.</br>  <br> Her case is different. She wasn't a creator and was a model for the main heroine. Besides, she was mostly dragged around by Tomoya before she decide to give it a try. <br><br>And she did really well. The girls could do programming or some other thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Izumi interrupted a conversation between Eriri and Tomoya and completely ignored Eriri though. And you guys are wasting a lot of energy arguing about what's meant to show that Eriri could have a normal conversation with strangers around. Poor Maruto.<br><br><br>The only people Tomoya would be looking for are some help writers, but he doesn't want to because of his promise to Utaha. Now he doesn't have to because Iori is in the circle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't sound like that at all from context. <br><br><br>Non-otaku going through a similar situation a Megumi shouldn't be a common thing though. But since they are otaku, this point is moot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't be helped. The Utahafag is too slow at writing summaries.</br>      <br><br>I didn't know msnkkan was an Utahafag.</br></br>  <br>He says it in one comment.</br>  <br>Eriri a best.</br>  <br>You are  right. </br>  <br>You are  wrong. </br>  <br><br>No wonder his summaries have been slow. Utaha's been losing relevance with each volume.</br></br>  <br>wrong</br>  <br>Maybe he is not native in English, but let'a thanks him for his summary</br>  No michiru in this thread?  <br><br><br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br></br></br>   This thread is still alive <br>Huh. I could had swore it was heading to fall off the board.<br><br><br><br>Well yeah, of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Eririfag being a shitposter <br><br>What a surprise.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's better than the old summaries. I feel some of the nuances were still lost though. <br><br> “…The part where the heroine sees the protagonist off with a smile as he leaves her for another girl in the middle their date but gets mad as soon as he leaves is original right? It’s not based on an experience right?” <br> “…At the very least, I don’t remember having an experience like that.” <br> “…Ah, it’s fine ~. It’s nothing~. Just my imagination~.” <br> “Katou?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ignores Megumifags for being worse shitposters past and present <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  <br> not only likes Eriri but also hates Megumi <br><br>Epitome of shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> calls out an Eririfag <br> b-but muh Megumifags <br><br>Stop being a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best</br>  <br> Only calls out an Eririfag <br> Doesn't do the same for Megumifags <br>Keep being a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to because I don't retardedly assume shitposters are fans of X girl until they give themselves away. Again, stop being a retard.</br>  <br>I don't understand. Why do they hate Eriri but not Utaha?</br>  <br><br>Utaha did less wrong than Eriri.</br></br>  <br>Just enjoy the show instead start comparing your waifu</br>  <br>Care to explain?<br><br>Izumi is a bitch to Eriri and Megumi can't even name her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Utaha told Tomoya that she was leaving directly. Eriri chickened out and used a text message.</br></br>  <br>They are upset at the way Eriri left the circle. Megumi is just depressed because she can't understand the reasons of Eriri's departure, being her best friend and all. Izumi outright dislikes her though.</br>  <br>Yeah and Tomoya is cool with her, that doesn't explain why the other are anal about her and not Utaha.</br>  <br>Who is they? Only Izumi seems to hate Eriri. She just has it out for Eriri because she is her rival. <br><br>Tomoya is a bit upset, but he is still fine with Eriri. It's like he said, give it some time before he can fully take it all down. <br><br><br><br><br>That isn't it. Tomoya doesn't seem upset by the way Eriri told him of her leave. And Izumi's complaint about Eriri is that she "abandoned" Tomoya. Utaha did the same thing, but Izumi simply has it out for Eriri so she doesn't take take care of Utaha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That isn't it? <br><br>What? Nothing in your post contradicts what I said. Especially for Megumi since she even confronted Eriri about the way she handled her way out of the circle.</br></br></br>  <br> Pretending to be dumb to shitposts made by fans with unbroken history <br> Still pretending shitposts doesn't exist for the other side and shields the side he is on <br>Keep being retarded.</br></br></br>  Who is first girl in this show?  <br>I think you need to re-read my post. You said because of the way she left. I'm saying that isn't it. It's not about the way, but that she did left. Megumi is bothered because Eriri is her friend and for not being able to understand why she left. Megumi isn't a Creator so that's why she doesn't understand. Tomoya seems like he doesn't get it either since he seems himself as someone still trying to be a Creator so he doesn't fully understand why himself.</br>  <br>I'm not pretending or ignoring anything you dumb sack of shit. I'm just calling shit out as I see it, simple as that. If you can't deal with it, then kill yourself.</br>  <br>Irony </br>  <br>Just stop posting.</br>  <br>It's both actually. Megumi questioned Eriri about why she didn't tell Tomoya personally and Eriri explained herself, but when it came to the reasons Eriri just told her that she wouldn't understand. That's the issue left to resolve.</br>  <br> Tomoya doesn't seem upset by the way Eriri told him of her leave <br><br>I dunno, he still has a grudge against Eriri but not against Utaha. I think her way of leaving definitely had something to do with that, though it's more like he didn't like how she planned to cut him off again. If it wasn't for the train scene, Eriri might have avoided him indefinitely.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is her mouth closed with the sound on but her mouth is open with the sound off?</br>  <br>But she told Megumi why she didn't do it personally. I think you're putting it in the wrong context. The issue is that she left, which also is connected to the reason why that bothers Megumi. For Tomoya, he knows why there is a reason (because Creator) and is able to come to an acceptable that made him support Eriri and Utaha for leaving (what he told to them at the train scene). <br><br><br>Let's say perhaps that might be it. But as it stands, it doesn't sound like that is the reason. It could very well be that Eriri is a childhood friend whom he's rather close with, so he expected a bit more when it came to Eriri leaving his side.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But she told Megumi why she didn't do it personally <br>Yeah, I said the same thing in my post. The point is that it was also part of the issue. Now Megumi is bothered because she can't solve the puzzle that Eriri as a creator is in her mind, but it doesn't mean she wasn't bothered by the way she left.</br></br>  <br><br>The way Eriri left is definitely part of the reason Megumi is angry with Eriri. She doesn't like it when friends are dishonest with each other nor does she like it when people hurt Tomoya. What confuses me is why they're having such a hard time Eriri left. It's simple. Eriri wanted to improve as an artist, so she backstabbed her own circle for her own gain.</br></br>  <br>Maybe Megumi is too shocked because her own initial view of Eriri's character was buttfucked so hard by that event.</br>  <br><br>So she doesn't want to admit to being wrong about Eriri's character? That makes sense. She did say that she believed Eriri to be someone who would never betray someone she was close to.</br></br>  <br>My bad. <br><br>So the saying bothered by the way she left refers to the reason Eriri gave to Megumi that lefts chews at her because she can't understand Eriri. <br><br><br>You don't know that for sure yet. It's like not Eriri wanted to hurt Tomoya, you know. And the issue between her and Eriri isn't about dishonesty, but a lack of understanding.<br><br> backstabbed  <br>That is pure misinformation. She didn't threw them under the bus for their enemies' sake for personal gain or something like that. She left as an artist in order to reach greater heights, to improve herself. And she did so after the main completion of the Circle's first game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's like not Eriri wanted to hurt Tomoya, you know. <br><br>But the fact remains that she did, and she did so knowing that it would hurt him. Megumi isn't as forgiving as she looks. <br><br> And the issue between her and Eriri isn't about dishonesty, but a lack of understanding <br><br>But that's what I don't get. The reason Eriri left is very easy to understand. It benefited her, so she left. And she left just after Tomoya got his hopes up that they would be able to create another game together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who objectively has the best chance at winning?  <br>Megumi. The other girls don't even come close to her.</br>  <br> Megumi isn't as forgiving as she looks.  <br>I guess. Her character is developing towards "that" side a bit.<br><br>I think Megumi can't wrap her head around it because she isn't trying to understand as a creator, but as a friend. That makes sense seeing as how she misses Eriri quite a lot.<br><br><br>It's not secret that Megumi is the main girl. Her end is inevitable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ironically, the reason why Eriri leaved the circle is to fulfill his promise with Tomoya to become his #1 after last year's Summer Comiket.  <br>Eriri would've hurt Tomoya whether she stayed or not. She chose what she thought was the best for both of them. What Megumi can't get over is how Eriri could leave Tomoya.</br>  <br>I hope Tomoya will realize that later.</br>  <br><br>As far as Tomoya's concerned, she had already fulfilled that promise, which was what led to her slump.</br></br>  Why did Utaha get so pissed and hurt when Aki didn't want to read the provisional end of the LN she was writing?  <br> explaining basic storytelling elements </br>  <br>But wasn't she already his number one by volume 6?</br>  <br><br>It wouldn't have as hurt as bad. Who knows, they might've found some way to get her out of her slump together.</br></br>  <br>I reckon it would have been worse actually.</br>  <br>It was more symbolic than anything. By asking him to read it early she was essentially confessing to him and saying that his opinion and approval meant more to her than anyone else's and he flat out rejected her.</br>  <br><br>Eriri doesn't seem so secure now that Izumi joined his circle; that insecurity is her source of motivation, though, so it's good for her in a way,</br></br>  <br><br>That's Tomoya and Eriri being out of sync like usual</br></br>  <br><br>Why? Even if Eriri stayed in her slump, Izumi would be there to draw for him.</br></br>  <br><br>In the game they're making, the general plot of the sub heroines is done. What's left is to make the main heroine's route the best of all. It's obvious what they're trying to say here.</br></br>  <br> and they call themselves childhood friends </br>  <br>Simply the best of the best.</br>  <br> I guess. Her character is developing towards "that" side a bit. <br><br>How dark will she get? The most she's done is yell at Tomoya in the auditorium.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet volume 9 will show her darkest side to Eriri.</br>  <br>And that's the most she would do. Tomoya already said that was when Megumi let out all of her feelings.</br>  <br><br>I hope she makes Eriri cry.</br></br>  <br>Both of them will be crying.</br>  <br>This is /a/ we are talking about. Some people never finished high school.</br>  The absolute feeling of comfiness Megumi is giving me makes me hate the wait for more of it.  <br><br>Their friendship felt too sudden though. Not enough scenes of them together.</br></br>  <br><br>Too bad it's going to be mostly drama thanks to a certain someone.</br></br>  <br> Eriri in charge of ruining everything <br>We can't have nice things I guess.</br></br>  <br><br> Blaming Eriri for Megumi's own feelings and fondness for Eriri <br>Okay.</br></br></br>  Would you stick your dick in crazy?

Especially the french kissing is so fucking rare outside of hentai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really was lewd.<br><br>But fuck. I already busted my nut to the Prisma OVA as well as the Herz episode and then this episode comes in to wreck my shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You obviously missed latest Iliya hype.</br>  <br>its really well done imo, gives the show a new direction and a lack of predicatability. i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere.</br>  Would you a Sophia?  <br>Obviously not.</br>  <br> i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere <br>It's like you didn't even watch the ED.</br></br>  <br>you know she is a slut deep down.<br>like mother like daughter<br>no exceptions</br></br></br>  <br><br>Prisma Illya wasn't lewd.

Since wearable tech crashed hard, and since culture fluctuates on a relatively short timespan (~30 years) I don't think any but the most prudish place would actually want to ban dirty words.

I thought she´d go "Oh so that´s what it actually looks like." but she went full on disgusted. I like Anna more that her now. Can´t halfass the lewd.</br>    <br>They're all definitely virgins but maybe she only reacts that way to MC's dick.</br>  <br>Sadly no. Just some straddling. She didn´t know how to use it. Which isn´t surprising, really.<br><br>I´m surprised she knew about french kissing though. Maybe kissing isn´t considered lewd?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/<wbr>210638-remote-control-device-releas<wbr>es-drugs-right-into-the-brain</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> That Vagina Juice <br><br>Damn, the animators must've been diamon hard the entire time they were drawing.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br> I´m surprised she knew about french kissing though. Maybe kissing isn´t considered lewd? <br>Didn't she get kissed before?</br></br>  <br>Toradora got lewd.</br>  <br>I think it comes from the fact that these kids are still a product of there generation. She has never seen real sex before and part of MC really wants to be pure for his lewd waifu. SOX is just as naive as ever one else when it come to the real thing, it is just that the main members know how to explain things.</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>Japanese trip fall kisses don't count.</br>  <br>She dons the knife already in the preview. I don´t think it´ll get really dark though. This is a comedy after all.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I think she liked when their lips met earlier and now she is just a lust beast so she is all over him with her mouth.</br></br>  <br>Frenching is instinct but kisses per se wouldn't be considered lewd, else parents couldn't kiss their children and vice versa</br>  Pixiv isn't as active as I thought it would be for this series.  I don't wanna stick it in anything else.  We finally saw the eel thing but when will the dog mascot show up?  <br>YOU MOTHERFUCKER</br>  <br><br>Yea it was probably her instincts just wanting more. She IS in puberty in addition to all of this after all.<br><br> I actually like lewd making out more than actual sex. Fuck yea frenching. Too bad i see it so rarely outside of hentai. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kind of like a nun giving sex education.</br>    <br> beginning of the episode makes it seem like they're glossing over the kiss to make way for 8 more episodes of status quo <br> episode ends with a rape <br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  I would stick it in like crazy, but just like MC I don't love her anymore.  <br>ahaha<br>ahaHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>You can't rape the willing.<br>A woman can't rape a man in Japan.</br></br>  What was with her logic at the end, repressing everyone even more was meant to make MC hornier?  Which one is the uncensored ones? Hiryuu or Clawhammer?  <br>I can see it happening here in Britain. They've pretty much done everything else, ISPs now record every website you go to for example.</br>  <br>Both<br><br>There was no penetration so i think it falls under sexual harassment.</br></br></br>  <br>She's so sexually repressed that she doesn't realize what she did was extremely lewd, she thought it was just love being expressed. <br><br>So her solution is to ban all other lewdness (swears porno mags and whatnot) so her "Love" is the only thing that persists.</br></br></br>  <br>Both, since they use the AT-X raw.</br>  <br>i hear you guys need a tv license<br>if you buy a tv you need to buy the license too.<br><br>you guys are insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really think so.<br>Imagine a little girl who doesn't know what a penis is. She wouldn't have any reaction to something she knows.<br><br>Kajo knows what a dick is compared to Anna who knows nothing. If Anna knew what dicks were in the first place she would be disgusted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like her. It´s not her fault she got brainwashed. She needs to be set straight though or it will only get worse.</br>  <br> If Anna knew what dicks were in the first place she would be disgusted. </br>  <br>But Anna only wants to "celebrate her love"(sex even though she doesn´t know it) with Tanakuchi. And a penis is basically made for "love" (sex) so i don´t really think she would see it as disgusting even if she knew its actual function.</br>  <br>The license fee funds the BBC.<br><br>You don't need to pay it if you don't watch TV, just home video</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>Hiryuu has the best script and typesetting though. But you'll need to wait a few more days for their release.</br>  My dick is literally diamonds.<br><br>Jesus fuck.</br></br>  <br>post the rest</br>  <br> Episode 5 will be out by the time they sub episode 4. </br>  <br>Why is it it's always the "purest" girls that always turn out to be the sluttiest?</br>  <br>Because they literally have no concept of sex and love.</br>  <br> borderline <br>fuck off she's a slut</br></br>  <br>Repressed Sexuality.</br>  <br>They said they have already started working on episode 4. And the reason why their episode 3 was really late was their editor had his finals.</br>  <br>Enhances the effect, what's so unpredictable about a slut getting sluttier?</br>  <br> vlc </br>  <br>He has a pretty shitty school if he finals are in July.</br>  <br>This is easily the anime i hype the most this season. Let´s hope it stays good and doesn´t fall off.<br><br>The entire scene is in </br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese are already going extinct. Might as well speed it up.</br>  <br>It's always the fucking final regardless of time of the year.</br>  <br>Would that mean that anything that was already crazy would go sane again from your dick?</br>  <br>Because your standards are stupidly wrong in the first place.</br>  So we all agree that yanderes are the best?  <br>This is something that would literally cause a person to blow themselves up for and I wouldn't blame them.</br>  <br>No, it would get worse.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't really matter to me if they're late since they have the best release among other groups.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'm so conflicted on who is hotter.<br><br>I would say Kajo with glasses and braids &gt; Anna &gt; Saotome &gt; Sophia &gt; Kajo with hair down.<br><br><br>Kind of does because I'm America and I want to watch things yesterday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>God the faggot MC's whimpering was so annoying.</br>  <br>What would you be saying if a mystery girl broke into your house in the middle of the night to rape you?</br>  <br>Take it like a man.</br>  <br>I'd be crying because my dream came true. Not only that, but she wasn't a fatty. Though Anna has some sweet Annas.</br>  <br>about time</br>  <br>To be fair it was pretty retarded to leave the door open at night with a letter of invitation pinned to it. Could have been some actually dangerous stalker (male or female) with a weapon.</br>  <br>What are they doing showing someone's crotch in front of hundreds of innocent high schoolers.<br>Do they even think of the children?</br></br>  <br> vacuum suction action asshole <br>What?<br>That sounds like something NASA would develop if they were interested in fucktoys.</br></br></br>  <br>With the force of a thousand suns.</br>  <br> Kind of does because I'm America <br>I don't give two fucks what Murrica wants.</br></br>  <br> personal <br>Nigga u fucked it up.</br></br>  <br>To be fair after that bill passes they won´t have schools for long anymore since no one gets pregnant ever.</br>  <br> typical stupid reaction <br>after this she can't be the best girl, NEVER</br></br>  <br>Literally a body made for sex</br>  <br> yet those hips will never get pounded </br>  <br>If it becomes reality we just make SOX.</br>  i hope mizuryu kei is watching this  <br>And so I squirt<br>Unlimited Juice Works!</br></br>  <br>Yeah they won´t show straight-up sex in the show.

This is a Christian imageboard, of Presbyterian denomination. No Catholic devil pedophiles here.</br>  <br>She's already fallen off the deep end, I don't think it's possible.<br><br><br>Her parent's vaguely told her about love in general so when she finds out that penises are lewd she might kill herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Anna is already leaving enough "juice" on the ground.</br>  <br>Racist jokes are in full productivity nowadays, too. Maybe that's the intention.</br>  Yes, yes I would.  <br>Ironically, Britain is in chaos now.</br>  <br>Why do you namefag? What's the purpose of it?</br>  <br>It´s kinda sad she got brainwashed so much. She was always such a sweet girl who cared for others regardless of who they were.</br>  I just "came" across this on pixiv.  <br>Is it recent? Damn, that was fast.</br>  <br>There's a lot going on in that picture.<br><br><br>She's not going to kill herself. She's crazy. She's going to rationalize it by proving since they fit in each other, that's how true love is formed. <br><br> Which is correct. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's this from? I don't see it in any of the novel scans I have on my computer.  <br> Every country in the world belongs to America <br> Couldn't win Korean and Vietnam wars <br> Couldn't win against ISIS <br>You couldn't own anything even it was hanging under your nutsack you autistic cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  Why /a/, she was so pure. I'm so sad  <br><br> All real life females are like that. </br></br>    <br> you will never invent a gene that stop aging in females and have a world of lolis  <br><br>But I can hope.</br></br></br>  It's love.
