[ Just started the franchise. 20 minutes into My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, and I'm kinda bored. The battle was pretty enjoyable though.  <br>I never liked it, the fanbase has no bearing on it. If I disliked things because I disliked the people who like them, I'd kill my dog because Hitler liked dogs. That's dumb.</br>  <br>When I have people like  over here, it's kind of hard to do so.</br>  <br>If you can't get through 45 minutes of something, you really have issues.</br>  <br><br> legend of galactic homos <br> complex <br> cartoons <br> complex </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You stop watching something because his fanbase? Thats very superficial.<br><br>Make yourself a favor and return to /r/anime.</br></br></br>   Project Hrunting <br> Get arrow that never misses <br> Project and attach Caladbolg <br> Arrow that never misses + nukes everything <br> Project and attach Rule Breaker <br> Arrow now never misses + nukes everything + breaks servant contracts on hit, so if they survive they're fucked <br><br>Why didn't Archer do this and turn the grail war into a done deal? It beats literally everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well you are wrong<br> Well, there are also some of those tough Ancestors that can withstand a direct hit from Excalibur-class attacks, but against those guys that just (emphasis on just; other stats don't match up) have wickedly high HP, Lancer-aniki'd be pretty tough. </br></br>  <br>this is dumb argument, archer can project the blade but not to use the power<br><br>he can project rule breaker, but in his hand it's just a regular blade, you need to "activate" the power to do it<br><br>hence, faker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc doesn't die even when killed, anon. It already happened once. Just because she is killed, doesn't mean she'll stay dead.</br>  <br>Sure, but it's not like as soon as she deactivates it she will get killed by any servant. She still outclasses most servants in close quarters combat, with the exception of Fake Assassin. Her using Avalon in tandem with her skills makes her practically unbeatable, even by Gilgamesh.</br>  <br> &gt;(emphasis on just; other stats don't match up) <br> &gt;but against those guys that just have wickedly high HP <br><br>This only is related to some of them. Not all DA have regeneration high enough but many do.</br></br></br></br>   manipulative asshole <br> secretively using his super power to appear smart and to get girls, instead of saving the world <br> acts selfish and in a comedic manner <br><br>Best premise ever. Why can't more anime do this?<br><br> 10 minutes later <br> gets found out <br> transferred to MAGIC HIGHSCHOOL <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This anime made it obvious how many pitiful edgelords there are on /a/ just looking for some smug motherfucker that gets away with everything to self-insert into <br><br>He deserved all the shit coming to him in the second half after almost killing 2 people, and I hope white bitch manhandles him like the ass he is</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also Is Charlotte the name of the powers like "Alice's" or something else later revealed? <br>Isn't that comet shows at the beginning named Charlotte?</br></br>  It was like watching an entire series in one episode<br><br>If it keeps up this pace somehow I won't even mind it being 1 cour</br></br>  <br>Hmmm</br>  <br>I was actually really happy when that girl dumped MC. His face was priceless<br>While it's entertaining to watch the MC do asshole shit, it's also entertaining to watch him getting what he deserves</br></br>  How big is too big?    <br> Now I've become tits, the destroyer of boners </br>  <br> see a girl in grade 9 whose like 6 feet tall with Double ds and slim figure lookin like some swedish model <br>Bring on the jail</br></br>   the only Chifusa doujinshi is hot but also disgusting as fuck <br>Eh</br>  <br>There's too much difference between 0 and 1, and not enough difference between 1 and 2.<br><br>In real life, 2 is my maximum.</br></br></br>   finally get around to watching pic related <br> download the dual audio version because /a/ always goes on about how good the dubbed version is <br> the dubbed version is fucking awful <br>You lied to me /a/</br></br></br>   how to spot a redditor  <br><br>Even the nips know the english dub was better</br></br>  <br> You lied to me /a/ <br>No, you just have shit taste.</br></br>  The guys didn't lie to you. They just didn't realize that it was nostalgia talking.<br>Cowboy Bebop is so popular that most people watch it before they get into anime, so usually they watch it dubbed just like all the other crap, and not being used to actually listening to the voice quality, they never noticed how much it sucked.</br>  Because a lot of people heard the dub first, so it's what stuck in their brain as the natural way for it to sound, same goes for DBZ and shit. Also dub is better.  <br>Can't wait until you shits have to go back to school.</br>  It's been a year now.

If you become unmotivated you'll eventually run off the tracks. If your ego keeps building these tracks it'll eventually despise your desire to keep going while it becomes exhausted. Despite all that you have to force it to build the rollercoaster.

And the limited animation doesn't help.</br>  <br> listening to /a/ <br><br>watch shit yourself and develop your own taste</br></br></br>  Lucky Stars.<br>The SOL aspect is nothing new, and the art style did not age well.</br>  <br>But i need to be popular by being unpopular</br>  <br>And how do you pick a show, especially one that was aired a long time ago?<br>Face it, more often than not, we pick shows/movies/music/almost eveyrthing based on recommendations and reputations.</br></br>  ITT: We make people read manga with one page.  <br>i'm not like you. i don't shitpost, and i try to avoid venomous individuals such as yourself who won't give anything to people who ask in an acceptable manner.</br>  <br>yes, i second this.</br>  <br>Why does he have holes in his hands?</br>  <br><br>not here though</br></br>  <br>You bastard.

Kobayashi (?) I believe mentions that even a stationary colony would have trouble surviving long-term without Higgs-powered things. There's also the fact that Gauna started attacking when humanity started using Higgs and at that time fucking nobody knew that it was actually drawing them in, there would be little reason to not equip seed ships with the top-tier tech at the time.</br>  <br>That works on the assumption all the nations had the same tech level, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every theoretical sub light speed interstellar travel technology was used.</br>  Is it strange that I can totally get off to just this one image?  <br>Not really.</br>  So MPC-HC is still the best for watching animu?  Use mpv for good quality that "just werks".
