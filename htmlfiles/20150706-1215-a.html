[ How strong are the police shields?  First for best girl  <br>They can take multiple bullets easy.</br>   First for best species   4th for anime rory looks like shit  Riot shields are lightweight protection devices deployed by police and some military organizations. Riot shields are almost exclusively long enough to cover an average-sized man from the top of the head to the knees. Some riot shields are designed to be bullet resistant against low-velocity handgun and shotgun ammunition; however, most are not. They are generally intended to be used in riot control, to protect the user from shrapnel, thrown projectiles, and splash from various weapons such as a Molotov cocktail. They can also be used as short-ranged melee weapons to push back rioters.<br>Riot shields are commonly used for protection from thrown projectiles or blunt/edged weapons, but not firearms. Ballistic shields are commonly known by the brand names "Body Bunker" and "Baker Batshield".<br>The extremely lightweight "Baker Batshield" ballistic shield is popular for police patrol first responders utilizing progressive "Immediate Action Rapid Deployment" (IARD) tactics when approaching high-powered handgun, shotgun or submachine-gun threats.<br>"Body Bunker" ballistic shields are opaque with a small, clear, armored sight window and commonly have a bright light mounted on the frontal surface. Bunker shields are not normally used by riot police, but more often tactical SWAT teams, as they are bulky, heavy, and designed to be used during slow, methodical operations where there is a higher risk of the officers being shot at.<br><br>In short, those shields would have been more than enough for the swords and arrows and other garbage they were up against</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> those shields would have been more than enough for the swords and arrows and other garbage they were up against </br>  <br>Why did the JSDF make her an MP at the Alba FOB again? Wasnt she a mercenary for that invading army?</br>  <br>Agreed,<br>I like the manga version much more<br><br>She's got some that thickness going and her dress looks so much cuter<br><br>The sluttied up anime version is extremely disappointing <br><br>Well I didn't expect anything good in the first place</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>However do take into consideration that the OPFOR inbound on the officers would be highly trained in combat against other shield wielding units. You would do better in analyzing what the officers could wear that would lessen the impact of arrows and stabs/slashes. As a road MP i know we would use a standard vest with a small plate over the center of the chest, and a slash guard as well as a kevlar sheet that sat over the plate. While the plate would stop arrows, the slash guard and kevlar had a pretty low-ish chance of stopping a direct stab.</br>  <br>she was one of the bandits from the destroyed army who attacked Italica, and also had some basic magic <br>0/10 would not trust</br></br>  I thought that the JSDF worked in tandem with the US military forces for things like this?<br>Seems silly to not use the added resources and manpower to roll in and stomp all over shit faster and more efficiently</br>  <br>Rory (spelling? The Death Apostle) snatched her up and made her a deputy or something, then the JSDF made her an MP. And yes, she was one of the sirens in the mercenary army.</br>  <br>Das bait mane<br>They wanter to lure them in and shank them individually like that Seven Samurai movie</br></br>  Just how many different races are there? All of them? I know Hobbits have been directly mentioned.  <br>At this point I'm willing to believe they're all there.</br>  <br><br>Riot police typically wear slash vests, do they not? I thought the fabric was excellent in stopping knives.</br></br>  Why didn't they send unmaned probes?  <br>It's safe to say all of them tbh.<br><br>We've had Lamias, Fish people, a chick with Angel Wings, Dragon People, Harpies, Dwarves, etc.<br><br>Pretty much every fantasy race you can imagine, though I don't think we'll be seeing too much crazy stuff like Elementals or Golems.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This sounds like bad juju...</br></br>  <br>The guy who made this is a giant Japanese nationalist. Manga and Anime are toned down. Just roll with it.</br>  <br>I don't know if the SDF has any drones to play with</br>  <br>There seems to be a continuity error with the shields, earlier they were holding transparent plastic ones but in this cut they seem to have morphed into opaque steel.</br>  <br>How old is the Gate story? Drones might not have been as common back then.</br>  <br><br>They are probably a separate unit. Anyway, the tear gas should be more than enough to really mess with the OPFOR.</br></br>  <br>In a lot of the 4koma's she's pretty comfortable with her job.<br><br>Most of the denizens of the Alnus Town think is paradise, and Rory is her boss after all.</br></br></br>  <br>Its slash vest for a reason. Its excellent against someone slashing at you with a kitchen knife, but we had officers get stabbed in the shoulder and shit because a super thin and sharp pocket knife would dive right through that sucker. If someone tried to take a stabbing weapon BUILT for stabbing, like a gladius, that monster is going to tickle as it passes your spine. However if it catches that nice solid ballistic plate it will just bend and bounce off i would reckon.</br>  <br>It was written when dubya was president I think</br>  <br><br>Drones require a direct line of sight between it and control. Humans do not.<br><br>Human scouts are more reliable and won't get lost as easily.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks fucking awful in this art style, not to mention they gave her disgusting ears on her head</br>  <br> you will never liberate a brother of every fantasy race alongside an angel </br>  You guys forget the enemies are mounted.<br>Riot shields can not protect them from getting trampled.</br>   sending an entire battalion without any Intel into enemy territory <br>I thought this this was supposed to pander to the military fags</br>  <br> Drones require a direct line of sight between it and control. <br>No they don't. At least, not the ones my unit worked with.</br></br>    So these threads will mostly be /k/ and /pol/, right?  <br>Just seems really stupid to wank over the SDF when they are trained by the DOD and US military advisers<br>I mean, when you have the world's most powerful military to back you up I guess it'd be easy to loose site over which responsibilities fall under which group, but the US has explicitly stated that the interests of Japan are the interests of the US, and they will be supported unconditionally in any military or humanitarian time of need</br></br>  <br><br>That makes sense. I would think that the pistols and tear gas would help the police win even with the majority of them having only batons. Those things are heavy and not unlike historical war clubs.</br></br>  <br>In the manga, they handwave it away as the US having its hands full trying to pacify the Middle East (even though theoretically the US military is maintained at the capacity to fight two full scale wars at once and decisively win at least one of them)</br>  <br>Didn't they already send in recon units? Didn't the commander lead the recon mission?</br>  <br>Stop with your /pol/ boogeyman</br>  <br>the guy knows his monstergirls</br>  <br> You will never have scantily clad, frightened beastgirls clinging to every part of your body for comfort during a minor earthquake. <br><br>Why live.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon, let me rephrase that. <br><br>So these threads will mostly be /k/ and /int/, right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The signal was probably bouncing off a satellite or was close enough to the control antenna to maintain enough of a signal not to lose contact.<br><br>A gate in another world is far different than a hill or a couple trees.</br></br></br></br>  What the hell was that pacing?<br><br> Hi, I'm a 33 year-old otak- <br> INTER-DIMENSIONAL SURPRISE ATTACK <br> ELF <br> ORGRES <br> DRAGONS <br> GOTHIC LOLITA <br> OH YEA, I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT <br> SECOND LT <br> LOLI SUFFERING <br> LIFE RETURNS TO NORMAL <br> "BUT I LIKE GIRLS" <br> COUNTER ATTACK </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gate summed up + tits  <br> beastman <br> white </br></br>  <br>I'm willing to bet that the author doesn't know or care how the US military is run or maintained<br>They don't sign his checks, so I don't really blame him</br></br>    <br> the boobs are gonna be toned down and not nearly as big in the anime. <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>I hope they animate the dogfight against the dragon.</br>  <br>the author is former JSDF himself, so I would think he has a slight idea how they operate.</br>   Self Defense Force <br> Invading <br>Uhm?</br></br>  <br>this is the police, as it says on the jackets. They don't exactly have unlimited funding or top of the line hardware, even if this was set at a time when the japanese SDF would be making extensive use of drones.</br>  <br>Did crunchy remove the flags on the soldiers' shoulders too.</br>  <br>Im the MP, btw, and did a lot of riot training out of boredom. A riot baton made by ASP (telescopic) while heavy and long, will lack the oompf behind a mace or a solid oak club with an iron rod filler. And our gear is roughly on par with baseball gear. Some of the more expensive riot stuff, while better and more padded, will lack the safety of steel plate, chain mail, and a jerkin under neath. If some legionary looking mother fucker came running at me, i would whip out my pistol and fire shots while at the run to get him behind the shield, and thats if i dont score a winning hit that goes through their steel overlay over the wood. If subject has been successfully pinned, I would than guess the appropriate response would be to beat that mother fucker while hes on the ground. An anon above said that had Calvary, and if a riot line is being charged by heavy horse, there isnt much you can do except hunker behind your shield and try to trip the horse so it dumps the rider. That and bat his fucking lance away with your shield or riot baton.</br>  <br>the group they are sending through are the one thats getting the intel.</br>  <br>They are not allowed to operate in another country. But since the other dimensions are not recognized as countries, this breaks no laws.</br>  <br>He likely knows an awful lot about how the JSDF operate, but his knowledge about the US Army, Air Force, or Navy is probably lacking to put it gently<br>They might train together, but the US military and the JSDF are very different organizations with different duties and goals. Like I said, the US didn't pay him, the JSDF did, so he didn't have that much motivation to be involved in the US side of things aside from training exercises</br></br>  <br><br>They are allowed to take whatever nescessary steps to defend themselves, including invading another nation and taking over completely. The only nation that has authority to stop Japan is the United States, and if the United States supports Japan, no other nation on Earth can say otherwise.<br><br>The treaty that keeps Japan from having a standing military is not an internationally drafted one. The UN has no authority there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They could send something like a mars walker connected by a cable.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>But why teach them how to operate one instead of just holding a demonstration? Or showing him all the dead wyverns outside the base?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or a fucking RC car by wire.</br>  <br>"pull the trigger, bitch"<br><br>Does not help them.</br></br></br>  <br> The treaty that keeps Japan from having a standing military is not an internationally drafted one <br>It's a self imposed redtrictions mostly, USA wants them to throw in the trash that shit</br></br>  <br>They wanted to show them their weapons weren't magic and just technology that any one could use for some reason.</br>  <br>Didn't it used to be two and a half wars?</br>  <br>That handle must be made of some serious wood.</br>  <br>It was under Nixon. But modern military equipment is expensive yo.</br>  <br><br><br>Sending people with a camera and guns is far easier.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to navigate them, and I'm pretty sure they don't have GPS satellites on the other side of the gate.</br>  Do you think the anime will show that soldier decapitating that woman at Italica?  This show is going to end with the Japs using a nuke, aren't they? The whole point is to show how much future society has advanced in comparison to the middle ages, and nothing embodies it better than this.  <br>How could they even be sure they could go through in the first place?</br>  <br> a1 <br> gore <br>Choose one</br></br></br>  <br>it will probably just show a black blob covered in shadows and heavily imply it</br>  <br>The battalion they sent is basically the recon group, who have to bring heavy armor because there could be anything on the other side.</br>  <br>Yeah, but also very risky. You generally would avoid sending people into a place you know absolutely nothing about if you have other options.<br>For all they know the other side might have atmosphere that's poisonous to humans not adjusted to it.</br></br>  <br>They do. Most developed countries's military have unmanned drones these days. Japan has US's Predator and other US utilized drones on top of their native drone programs.</br>  <br>The show will probably end with the Senate building</br>  Why didn't the empire army close the gate behind them when they got rekt so hard and ran away?  <br> Japan <br> having nukes </br></br>  <br>No, the brown elf is voiced by Hikasa Yoko, so I imagine she'll be in it for a while which might mean the anime could end with the dragon's death and Giselle.</br>  <br>I honestly don't think any of the empire managed to go back through the Gate. They were captured. Which explains why nobody on the other side knows what happened to the first group to invade.</br>  <br>just borrow one from America.</br>  <br>They had no idea their army got absolutely destroyed until later. Every soldier that didnt get killed was taken as a POW so they couldnt go back to their country and say" hey we got rekt. dont mess these guys"</br>  <br> Why didn't the empire army close the gate behind them when they got rekt so hard and ran away? <br>Communication decay. It will be many, many months before the politicians of the Empire ever even hear the details of how outclassed they were, because they have no internet, no video cameas, and the best they got is hand written letters and messengers on horseback.</br></br>  <br>So the backup group just sat there for weeks without hearing from the invasion group and did nothing?</br>  <br> ok Japan, just give up half control of the operation (this means full control) in the new world and we'll take care of the oil. </br>  <br><br>Still didn't make sense to leave the gate completely unguarded.</br></br>  <br>Not really that hard to believe. An invading force might take weeks or months to accomplish what they set out to do back then. And Japan shut that shit down in a day.</br>  <br> months <br>weeks. The gate isnt too far from the Capital<br><br><br>It was stated that there was a small fort built up around the gate. I assume when the JSDF came through they fucked up the people guarding it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enchanted ironbark.</br>  <br>I would hazard a guess that they got some basic intel from captured Imperial soldiers who:<br><br> are being legally treated as terrorists <br> in some cases aren't even legally human <br><br>so they could easily hand them over to the CIA to drug and torture information out of them without running up against any laws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They had a small fortress built near the gate but it wasnt heavily guarded. They thought the people on the other side were "stupid savages" so they didnt see a point.</br>  <br> They thought the people on the other side were "stupid savages" <br>Stupid motherfuckers should really have been tipped off by the skyscrapers at the very least.</br></br>  <br>Still sending people in there based just on what captured invaders say is questionable at best.</br>  <br>They don't know exactly what they are. They just call them towers.</br>  <br> juju <br/></br>  <br> This show is going to end with the Japs using a nuke, aren't they? The whole point is to show how much future society has advanced in comparison to the middle ages, and nothing embodies it better than this. <br>they'll never need to use a nuke. 5000 JSDF soldiers are pretty much the equivalent of a nuke right now to those primitives. <br><br>as has been shown time and again in the manga whenever one of the primitive armies tries to go against them.<br><br>The real issue will be whether japan and the [insert foreign power here] end up in a war over who becomes the next king/queen of the "empire"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can attack helicopters lock onto dragons which are not made of metals and give out no radio signals?  <br> weeks. The gate isnt too far from the Capital <br>You forget the minor issue that the info could not be proven and the claims are too outrageous to be believed. Imagine being told that your army got crushed by supernatural forces, but you have only written letters and no other proof to back it up.</br></br>  <br> leave the gate completely unguarded. <br>Did you miss the part where the moment they arrived on the other side they encountered an entrenched and alert enemy force<br><br>Admittedly a force who should have thought something was up when no messages were sent from the advance party to confirm mission success<br><br><br>Towers which are way too tall to build practically with ancient engineering techniques. We couldn't build them until the 19th century.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragons won't know what it is the first time and stare at it for a few seconds.</br>  <br>infrared homing would probably do the trick.</br>  <br>Heat-seekers?</br>  <br> Towers which are way too tall to build practically with ancient engineering techniques. We couldn't build them until the 19th century. <br>I dunno man, have you seen the Empire capital? It's pretty impressive.</br></br>  <br><br>I thought those were generally designed to lock onto objects with high heat, like jet engines. Would dragons be hot enough?</br></br>  <br>Radar-lock comes from bouncing radar waves off of the target, not reading waves emitted by the target, so those would work just fine. Heat-seeking missiles might work too if dragons have lots of fire inside of them. And there's always having your gunner point the gat manually.</br>  I was kind of sad they didn't adapt this panel here showing the police charging at the soldiers while they were all SQUAD BROKEN.  <br>TV-guided munitions</br>  <br> ARREST THEM </br>  <br>older ones could only lock onto very hot things (like jet engines) but modern sensors are much more sensitive.</br>  <br>There's going to be a lot of neat/important stuff that's probably going to get skipped this season.</br>  <br>or beam riders</br>  <br>And these guys were using magic to bolster their weapons.</br>  <br>A single chopper could pop up from behind a hill and paint the dragon with a laser allowing the rest of the squadron to let loose with a massive volley of Hellfires.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they don't have nukes. Dad's ship pulled into harbor over there once years ago, and somehow they figured out they had some warheads on board. It was a hair's breadth short of an international incident. They do NOT want those things anywhere near them.</br>  <br>It's nothing compared to 1920s NYC let alone 2010s Tokyo.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure ARREST THEM is in the ep</br></br>  <br>but Gate world has literal gods</br>  <br>It's totally not. They went directly from LAUNCH TEAR GAS to the doors opening with relieved citizens on the other side.</br>  <br>Yeah, they really pandered it up with the first episode. Even censored all the gore.</br>  <br>I more pissed about no being any gore at all and getting some mobile game stuff and random precognition instead.</br>  <br>Who haven't really done shit at all, besides Hardy who's been popping up the gates.<br><br>We've only seen two Apostles, and the 2nd one just showed up and got immediately dominated by the JSDF.</br></br></br>  <br>the manga might find a reason<br><br> god threatens japan <br><br> rest of world does not tolerate that shit <br><br> japan uses allies nuke </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently a god threatened Japan <br> Which god? <br> Some god on the other side of the Gate <br> That's not our god, NUKE EM </br></br></br></br>  <br> clocktower <br><br>that is a block down the road from the gate<br><br>that's no victory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Let's be honest, the entire thing is probably going to be a shitshow because of how politicized it is.<br><br>They're probably going to retcon the japanese sex slaves out too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> sex slaves <br>You mean comfort women?</br></br>  What tanks were the JSDF using in the expedition?  <br> No monstergirl titties <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br> Instead of slaves they were all turned into maids.  <br> Sending Itami into a rage </br></br>  <br><br>I was actually thinking about that last night. Rory can regenerate if her parts are stuck back together, but a nuke strike wouldn't leave any parts. Not sure what would happen to her.</br></br>  <br> going to retcon the japanese sex slaves out <br>Ofc they will, this is for kids.</br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_<wbr>74</wbr></br>  <br> water cannon </br>  <br>That's IF the nuke actually does atomize her. Even if she does survive, she's not going to be happy for a while with all the radiation.</br>  <br> ARREST THEM!! </br>  <br>Based on the arc of the water in that picture, they clearly didn't turn up the pressure that high. If they really turned it up, it would have sent the guy flying.</br>  <br><br>Look at that shit.<br><br>A mound of corpses like that takes several dozen people at least, and you can expect they just grabbed the closest bodies. The numbers probably run into several hundreds, possibly thousands.<br><br>And all you get in the anime is what? Thirty flower bouquets over by the Gate during the speech to the troops?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> low pressure </br>  <br><br>The pilots of the F4's pick of the dragon on radar in the manga. They said that it was like a stealth aircraft signature, but they did see it.<br><br><br>A near direct hit would vaporize her. She seems to be immortal but not at all immune to injury. I'm also pretty sure the axe wouldn't survive. She did damage it fighting the dragon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea that scene was the biggest let down so far.</br>  <br><br>Also, the axe would be so radioactive that it would hurt her and anyone near it for a long time, even if it did survive.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I can imagine citizens breaking into tears seeing such unthinkable power. These people are amazed at flashlights. Something like a nuke would truly horrify them.</br></br></br>  <br>But the gods aren't really aligned with the empire, so it's not like Japan is making enemies of any of them. Hell, they have an apostle of one of the gods on their side, so they're more-or-less safe from having to fight gods.</br>  <br>They kinda need to bring that up in the negotiations. The Empire sees Japan as a singular enemy, but they need to realize that Japan is also standing in between them and China, for one. China would have no problem turning the entire area into a wasteland. Pina has already learned that during her visit through the gate.<br><br> still chuckle every time her name comes up <br> Pina Co Lada </br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll probably take out the speech the Fantasy Emperor makes about how he believed a country like Japan whose emperor has no real power must be weak. (probably he misunderstood the actual reason that the emperor was a powerless figurehead)</br>  <br>Do you think there will be a scene where she realizes there is a drink that shares her name in our world</br>  <br><br>What's so funny about riot police arresting people instead of gunning them down?</br></br>  <br>Nukes won't usually atomize something. Maybe if she was close to the epicenter. Otherwise she would suffer horrendous burns, that she can recover from, and whatever fallout there is would have to pass thorugh her system. I imagine radiation's affects are too slow to really harm her.<br><br><br>That's not how radiation works.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think she has actually witnessed any large scale munitions yet. She's heard of them, but never actually seen them. Plus she's too busy being in her fujoshi group.</br>  <br>I want Japan to make it clear to the empire that despite laying waste to their forces, they are themselves a meager force and by no means even remotely as strong as the true superpowers of the world. And diplomacy is the ONLY thing standing between them and complete annihilation.</br>  <br>Her regen might follow the Cell rules though. Even if she's a burnt piece of meat, if there's one cell left she could come back. Of course she would be in screaming pain the whole time. Not to mention she would have to walk out of the blast zone while constantly breaking down and repairing herself. She will not be happy in the end.</br>  <br>The Emperor was weak when WWII started. His generals ran amok because he was weak. They went and started shit with China in Manchuria, then told him afterwards.<br><br><br>Hopefully she finds it tasty. I couldn't keep a straight face around her though.<br><br><br>Yeah, it kinda is how radiation works. Look up the Bikini Atoll tests. Some of the ships were scrubbed clean and returned to service, others were so lethal that there was nothing we could do with them.<br><br><br>Yeah, she didn't see the biggest weapons, but she's got the idea. Japan is pretty small as far as military forces on the world stage.<br><br><br>This. They're trying to play it as cool as they can though, and the discovery of civilian hostages threw a big wrench in that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are probably american and are just used to the idea of cops killing people instead of arresting them.</br>   Itami, are ALL your word's weapons variations on the Rod of Steel?   <br>Arresting people is something you do with criminals and lawbreakers. You do not arrest soldiers of invading armies, you capture them.</br>  <br>The rod of steel design is very effective.</br>  <br> The Emperor was weak when WWII started. His generals ran amok because he was weak. They went and started shit with China in Manchuria, then told him afterwards. <br>Irrelevant. The reason the Emperor is weak at the point in time that the Gateworld obtained their intel on Japan is because executive power lies with elected officials and not with a supposed living god, as opposed to because the country is a lawless and unstable.</br></br>  <br>Does japan have any ballistic missile?</br>  <br> Apollo missions <br><br> "You sent a immense rod to... inseminate the moon?!" </br></br></br>  Will they fix the "ITARICA" on the unit patches?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I'm sure she orgasmed a few times from the thousands of people around her dying in an instant.<br><br><br> Yeah, it kinda is how radiation works <br>No, it isn't. Expose something to radiation, and that object does NOT become radioactive. The radiation left behind from a Nuke is because of the debris from the radioactive material used to make the bomb.<br>That's why simply cleaning something is enough to get rid of the radiation that's coming from it. Of course you can't clean a whole landscape of the stuff, because the debris is everywhere, and mostly dust.<br><br>Her ax would be fine after wiping it down, unless radioactive debris melted itself inside the ax.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh she had a good climax, but the cleanup isn't going to be pretty</br>  <br> Rory's on the patch <br><br>I enjoy this immensely.</br></br></br>  ANIME OF THE FUCKING YEAR.    Am I going to enjoy this if I don't know shit about weapons or military?  <br> naked, charred Rori screaming in pain as she stumbles through a dark hellscape in the aftermath of a small nuke <br><br>would the author want to push it that far?</br></br></br>  We need more anime and manga about the regular militaries.  <br>Relevant because even when the Emperor was in charge, weakness still managed to start a world war.<br><br><br>Ok cheesedick. Explain this picture then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, if you enjoy Bayformers</br>  <br>Not against Rori. Maybe some other Demi-God.</br>  The only good thing about the whole episode was the BGM when they went into the gate. Itami's introduction was garbage, the mobage scene was cringeworthy, the premonition was stupid, the combat was laughably censored.<br><br>Since they're already skimping out on gore we know Rory is not going to have a single good action sequence all season, since they won't let her dismember people onscreen.<br><br>This is going to be one of those adaptations where the only possible worthwhile contribution is the audio.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So seeing as the season will probably end after they return from the Onsen incident, they better not fuck up the Flight of the Valkyries scene at Italica.</br>  The only thing that gets me about this is how they use MY JAPAN SUPERIORITY.<br><br>As if the standing Japanese Army was anything to fear. Made me laugh when they mention the main character was special forces in the manga.<br><br>Overall good enjoyment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they use Rori to locate the god and home in on her signal <br><br> she and the main cast are unaware of this until it's too late </br></br></br>  <br> because even when the Emperor was in charge, weakness still managed to start a world war <br>except that the weakness of the Emperor didn't make Japan less of a threat (like Emperor Malt believed), but more of one.<br><br>It's funny that Malt warned the Japanese something along the lines of "an empire built on military might will collapse" (I guess alluding to the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire?) and the Japs reply "yea that kind of already happened for us"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that strong for those. Those are simple impact and riot shields and really only deflect thrown stuff like bottles and rocks and various shrapnel. <br><br>This is a real bullet proof shield up to IIIa or IV<br><br>http://www.bulletproofme.com/Ballis<wbr>tic%20Shields.shtml<br><br>Very expensive and a lot heavier and different looking</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh, yeah.

Weak leadership can lead to total collapse (e.g. various points in the history of Imperial China such as the Three Kingdoms period, or the fall of the Roman Empire in the West as it was invaded by barbarians)</br></br>  <br>wait, crunchy is censoring stuff?</br>  <br> China would have no problem turning the entire area into a wasteland. Pina has already learned that during her visit through the gate. <br><br>In the manga, China's goal was to quickly transplant chinese citizens into the new world. Those people there would then vote their new country joins China. Voila. All those lands join china officially.</br></br></br>  <br>#lurk</br>  <br>just go to /ak/ if you want to download it.</br>  <br>Nope, I see nothing over ten stories, let alone anything approaching a modern skyscraper.</br>  <br>Wohoo, new chapters this year!</br>  <br>I didnt only use it for Gate. I used it for everything</br>  <br>This reminds me of Muv-Luv Alternative TDA where there is concern that a mass influx of Japanese refugees into Seattle would mean they would have the numbers to elect the Japanese Shogun as the Governor of Washington State. And since Seattle is basically the only survivng major center of population in the US the Shogun's offspring could run for President and win purely on the Japanese vote.</br>  <br><br> Based on the arc of the water in that picture, they clearly didn't turn up the pressure that high. <br><br>They wouldn't need to turn it up very high if they electrified their water cannon. That would turn the stream of water into a long-distance "taser". <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water<wbr>_cannon#Electrified_water_cannon</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After exterminating the natives, no doubt.</br>  <br>The Founding Fathers were actually worried about something like that. It is why the usa president is required to be born on american soil. That way, a foreign power cannot send a candidate over and then use their huge wealth or power to force that candidate into office or cower/kill all the competing candidates.</br>  <br>I really though I would dislike her character, but in the end I really like her<br><br>the anime version looks like shit though<br><br>still, 10/10 would squeeze to see if she squeaks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this shit never was in the manga iirc</br>  <br>If atomic nuclei capture neutrons when exposed to a flux of neutron radiation, they will, as a rule, become radioactive (neutron-induced activity) and then decay by emission of beta and gamma radiation over an extended period of time. Neutrons emitted as part of the initial nuclear radiation will cause activation of the weapon residues. In addition, atoms of environmental material, such as soil, air, and water, may be activated, depending on their composition and distance from the burst. For example, a small area around ground zero may become hazardous as a result of exposure of the minerals in the soil to initial neutron radiation. This is due principally to neutron capture by sodium (Na), manganese, aluminum, and silicon in the soil.</br>  <br> not squeal </br>  <br>I did mean squeak<br><br>squeak<br><br>squeak<br><br>squeak</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, but modern nuke produce little to no radiation/fallout</br>  http://ak-scans.wikia.com/wiki/Gate<wbr>_-_Thus_the_JSDF_Fought_There_Scanl<wbr>ation_Activity<br><br>Chapter 47 spoonfeed</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Don't forget these are GRORIOUS NIHON FOLDED TEN MILLION TIMES GAIJIN PIGGU KILLING SHIELDS OF HONORHABAR.</br>  <br>God, the chapter where that asshole got absolutely fucked up was great.</br>  <br>You're going to have to be more specific than that.</br>  <br> After exterminating the natives, no doubt. <br><br>Natives don't have to be exterminated. All they need is to be disenfranchised such as getting arrested for a felony. Many countries don't allow felons the "right" to vote (such as the usa). <br><br><br> This reminds me of Muv-Luv Alternative TDA where there is concern that a mass influx of Japanese refugees into Seattle would mean they would have the numbers to elect the Japanese Shogun <br>The USA used a variation of this technique in Hawaii. Enough usa citizens populated the island and swamped out the native vote for their prior government. The islands then became a USA state with enough votes. China could use the same tactics on various pacific island countries, but has been advancing population only slowly. Some countries do have a significant presence of chinese nationals and chinese company offices on their islands though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is China we're talking about, not some limp wristed first world nation more worried about reception on their iphones.</br>   nuking Rory <br><br> nuking a future goddess of Love </br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's not quite the case. We can create a number of types of nukes, now that we're familiar with the technology. We've even designed a type of nuke specifically meant to maximize the radiation fallout.</br>  Why isn't the US helping the Japanese? There's pretty much no non-bullshit way the US would not help Japan  <br>You do know China is one of the largest Iphone users in the world right?</br>  <br> Why isn't the US helping the Japanese? <br>They are though. They even said it in the show.</br></br>  <br>Militarily I should have added</br>  <br>You do know that China is a brutal communist dictatorship with the largest standing army on the planet, right?

It's contaminated, not activated.<br><br><br>Warheads designed to maximise fallout seem like an urban myth to me. But it's not like they're hard, take a normal one, wrap it up in as much uranium and cobalt as you can find, ground level detonation.<br><br>What we do have are warheads designed to maximise the neutron radiation burst of the detonation. These are the enhanced radiation warheads, colloquially neutron bombs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely never. It's too volatile a place for any civilian to be there.</br>  <br> NATO <br>They learned from the best.</br></br>  <br>Basically I mean first world people are mostly airheaded idiots who don't pay attention to anything outside little sphere of self importance, while China is out for new territory no matter what. And they're willing to steamroll anyone who gets in their way, including the US. They would swat the inhabitants on the other side of the gate like flies.</br>  <br> hand-me-down equipment <br><br><br> US not having enough troops to send to Japan because of the fucking Middle East <br><br>I don't think this author knows much about the US military despite working with them</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;not squeal <br><br>She's not a pig though. So you can't expect her to squeal.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliv<wbr>erance#Notorious_line</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see why they don't have tourism now. At least in and around the base.</br>  <br>We have no neutron bombs left. The generals never quite got how they worked and never liked them. The idea never took off.</br>  Where the fuck is she?  <br>We didn't have enough troops at the height of the wars in the ME. Troops were being prevented from leaving the military when their enlistments were up at one point.</br>  <br>First appearance should be next episode.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>That's like asking why there isnt tourism on a FOB in Afghanistan. Its a hazardous area full of rogues, mercenaries, and magical monsters that will kill you.</br>  <br>yeah that's my biggest peeve<br><br>oh well, I'm reading it because its military wank and fantasy shit, not because it's weeb wank<br><br> F4s doing gun runs against dragons <br><br>shit, I may actually get into mangas at this rate<br><br>have to say though, 20mm would definitely suck up a dragon, even with scales at 9 on the Mohs scale. Would shatter and/or penetrate and/or cause massive blunt force trauma</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You do know that China is a brutal communist dictatorship with the largest standing army on the planet, right? They're threatening war right now with advanced countries. They'd annihilate some backwater people in another world where they're actions wouldn't even be monitored. <br><br>Brutality doesn't mean overt violence. It's be easy for China to spread measles, smallpox, influenza, and other diseases to the notRoman Empire. If someone got sick with all three at the same time, that should be enough to kill them. That would leave just the chinese people behind to vote.</br></br></br>  <br>But that was, what, the 00s? The novels started in 2010</br>  <br>How can you not understand how they work? The mechanics and limitations of them? The generals don't understand how drones work and how you can't use them in most weather conditions, but we still use them.<br><br>It's just a bomb that kills people, but leaves the structures in tact, for us to use instead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>God damn, ignorant as shit trolls are. <br><br>Of all the US bases in Tokyo, none of them have weapons ready for deployment. <br>There's absolutely no way in hell US forces would have gotten to the palace before JSDF. <br><br>Do you fuckers even know how far Okinawa and Tokyo is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would she ruin a nice pair of oakleys on his face like that is beyond me</br>  <br> implying even modern citizens wouldn't break into tears at the sight of a nuclear explosion on their homeland </br>  if the jsdf can take down that dragon with a heavy gun, are they trying to say they can solo King Ghidorah? Or is this dragon leagues below that?  <br>Is that some other definition of "annihilate?"<br><br><br>Was still going on in 2010.<br><br><br>Yeah, they wanted the big boom, big destruction. Neutron bombs had about a one mile effective range, they didn't like that. Didn't see that need for it when we already had the conventional warheads. We still have those old ones, by the way. China and Russia have never updated theirs, and China was never a part of the disarmament treaties we had with Russia agreeing to dismantle some of ours for some of theirs. China still has all of theirs from the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>realistically we can take down Kaiju as we are now.</br>  What was the point of the mobile game part?<br><br>No really, what did it accomplish?</br></br>  <br>mobile games are popular in japan</br>  <br> water cannon <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qGf<wbr>pMgjYVh0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That mobage are shit.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean anything tho. shields aren't fixed, they are attached to limbs and shit and can absorb impact much better. Now the dude behind the shield is mush. But the shield itself is likely fine.</br>  <br><br>No no, storywise.<br><br>Did it introduce a character? Did it explain a backstory? Did it move forward the plot? etc.<br><br>It did absolutely fucking nothing. Why is it even there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying we can't Tomahawk Gojira to death or just JDAM it into oblivion </br>  <br>To sell the game?</br>  <br>realistically of course if we add all realistic properties including something that size falling under their own weight.</br>  <br>That was a wyvern. <br><br>You will see an actual Dragon later in the series, and it's no joke.</br></br></br>  So where do you guys think next episode will end? Picking up Rori on the road and about to fight the dragon?<br><br>Or finding Tula?</br></br>  <br>I guess it's supposed to further develop Itami as an Otaku. Like we didn't figure it out already. Don't have a fucking clue what the visions were about.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ETx<wbr>mCCsMoD0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Maybe up to when the dragon shows up to attack the people.

You get more destruction by heat/blast wave at higher altitudes but that means you spread the waste further meaning it's less concentrated. You still need a fission "bomb" to activate the fusion core.</br>  <br>The smaller Dragons (Wyverns) are routinely shredded by AA fire and such.<br><br>The larger, more mature dragons like the Ancient Dragons and their offspring are significantly more durable, but they do eventually get downed by a hefty amount of combined arms.</br></br></br>  <br>They were trying to cause a sonic boom over the capital to scare them.</br>  <br>What the fuck kind of jets are they flying to need to use afterburners to get past Mach?</br>  <br>which is illegal.</br>  <br>Ideal pacing would be ending with picking up Rori. <br>Finding Tuka would be way too slow, that would mean they spend an entire episode on a Humvee heading to the elven village.</br></br>  <br> japan gets to conquer an undiscovered and effectively defenseless territory that isn't governed by international treaty or law <br> giving a fuck about civilians </br></br>  <br>Depends on the rules of engagement.</br>  <br>Next episode seems to indicate they'll show some of the fight though based on the title of the next episode.</br>  <br> NOT giving a fuck about civilians <br><br><br>This is true</br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't conquer it, although they do setup a puppet government with Japan holding the upper hand.</br>  <br>They're flying F-4EJ Kai but I don't think the writer was in the JASDF.</br>  <br>Why would they care about them?

It's under "review". Past that I don't know.  <br>Just a repeated reminder from the manga that the Empire is crippled by the lack of Internet. JSDF finds it frustrating that the Empire Nobles were entirely ignorant about how fucked they were, as such it was impossible to get a peace treaty signed because the Empire still don't know how weak they actually are. The JSDF is trying to get a peace treaty and the Empire still thinks there is room for negotiations... All because the Japanese diplomats acted far too humble and, yes, diplomatic. It made Japan look weak and gives the Empire politicians false sense of security.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, it was 24.</br></br>    <br><br>Thankyou!</br></br>  D'aaaaaw  <br>Also perfectly fine.</br>      <br>Ahaha, this poor guy.<br><br>Trying to be all serious diplomat and getting betrothed to a loli.</br></br></br>    <br> poor guy <br> betrothed to a loli <br>What?</br></br></br>    <br><br><br>Who is this little whore again?</br></br></br>  So hypothetically speaking, would a legion of ancient Rome like infantry be able to deal with a single tank? <br>I don't really see what they can do to it besides a direct hit from a insanely huge catapult with a huge bolder.</br>  <br>This loli has plans</br>  <br> The look on their faces  <br>They act like they never saw a lolicon before.</br></br>  <br>The little girl that bugged him at the Garden Party.<br><br>He was kind to her because she's a relative of a big Pro-War Senator.</br></br></br>    <br>she's the daughter of a high ranking noble Sugawara entertained during one of the initial meetings between Japan and the Empire's nobility.

With enough infantry support that come with a tank they would be able to deal with a legion.</br></br>  <br>No, unless they wait for it to run out of fuel, ammo, or do what you just said. But even then there's no way they'd even think of letting it run out of fuel and ammo since they're probably wouldn't even know what it is</br>  <br>Too bad she's going to  suffer misery <br>Her primary role will be to antagonize the fucking prince further, as if he needed any more.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>    Will delicious big brown tits wyvern goddess appear in the anime? <br><br>Gate is 2 cour right? How much of the manga (or LN, not sure which is getting the adaption) will they be able to cover?</br></br>    <br> Will delicious big brown tits wyvern goddess appear in the anime? <br>Wih 2 cour they will definitely cover the dragon battle.

Eat healthy and fucking exercise, otherwise you'll gain it back. <br>Fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. It's there first IP specifically for older people and men, I think.<br><br>I'm hoping for Plasma and Shiganz scales between in the 1/6-1/8 range.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it aired at night and had some pretty lewd humor and themes. It doesn't really go anywhere but it's fun and rewarding for the music and art if you're thinking of checking the series out.</br>  <br> there <br>Dammit.</br></br>  <br><br><br> I'll only do it for 1,5 - 2 months maybe, no more than, then I'll pick a healthier diet with exercise too included, thanks for your advices, this time I won't reply anymore since I have already derailed the thread long enough </br></br></br>  <br>The price was 2,7 million right?, I wonder how less it could be if they were mass produced, I could pay up to 10000 bicks, not for this figure though.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would pay a very very large amount for a good, life size Rom, but not a house deposit.</br>  I want Rozen Maiden figs where do I get the best quality? $$ is not an issue.  <br><br> not posting the real lewd version </br></br>  <br>Do you have 400K?</br>  <br>no..<br>but I can save up</br></br>  <br>These ones aren't that expensive.</br>  <br>forgot the link http://ekizo.mandarake.co.jp/shop/e<wbr>n/item_s-1573320.html</wbr></br>  <br><br><br>What's the point if they don't even look like the character they are supposed to be?</br></br></br>  <br>Because these are dolls, even more the first one is part of the super dollfie line, the DD ones are more closer in general.</br>  If I knew hobby Japan was gonna make Anime Expo a thing, I would have saved so much on shipping just buying from their booth.  <br>And now I need to cancel all my preorders from NY since they opened preorders for the U.S. Thank god Hobby Japan.</br>  <br>How does preorders for those work? You fill a request on site and pay later? Pay at AX and receive them later? Wait till next AX?</br>  They were selling extra limited items they had for 5 dollars. Not sure what this one came with before. It was good to check their booth everyday because they just put up new stuff.<br><br><br>They opened a site let me get the flyer.</br></br></br>  <br>The mat was sold by itself, not part of any limited set.</br>  <br>who cares anyway?</br>    <br>Cool, I was wondering about it.<br><br>Also, Momo is a barbie.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br> that tiny hank hill ass <br><br>At least she's representative of a real Japanese woman, then.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't NY auto ban you if you try to cancel?</br>  <br> anorexic sonico <br><br>No, no, get this off my screen, god dammit.</br></br></br>  <br> healthy Sonico <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>She actually looks really good there.<br> Really really good. </br></br>  <br>On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being milk chocolate and 5 being dark chocolate, how dark is your skin?</br>  <br>Not sure but hey, those prices for the US are dope. At the booth they said they plan to get all hobby japan items available for order, but the site is still kinda new. I think they saw how many Japanese figure companies were killing it in the US and wanted some of the business. Native did really well and they are more than likely to come back next year. My hopes is that AX turns out to be pre Wonfest status.</br>  <br>They are only sightly better than BiJ's though, and most likely will use sea shipping so expect to get your figures way later. Still, a nice alternative for HJ exclusive stuff.</br>  <br><br> no hips <br> waist barely goes in <br> stick legs <br> flat ass </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh elins </br>  <br><br>I'm guessing this is for America only? Oh well, I subscribed anyway.</br></br>  <br>No one must know my terrible secret.</br>  <br>Looks like it from the company handling the distribution.<br><br>Hopefully it's international though and they ship from Japan, otherwise BiJ and NY will be way cheaper.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, my hopes aren't high. Whenever I pre-order from European sellers stuff takes an extra month too which stops it being worth while.</br></br>  <br>But also less fat</br>  <br> mfw this is already gone on BiJ and NY </br>  <br>Wait and hope for the best, previous Aniplex figures have sold out and then go up again a few days later.</br>  The biggest form of scumbaggery at AX. Vendors clogged up the line for Goodsmile, buy stuff, and resale 2 times the price the same day.  <br>Welcome to every con ever.</br>  <br>That's how it works, seller B buys from A at cheaper price and resells for profit.</br>  <br>Get fucked nigga.</br>  <br><br>And its a good example of why its not worth bothering with most dealers.</br></br>  <br>Precisely, which is a good example of why most cons are utter shit.</br>  <br>Goodsmile at least prepared enough 2-star Mako Nendos even with this shit going on.</br>  <br>How do people manage to paint skin like this, it's fucking amazing.</br>  <br>fuck off, at least they're supporting the industry.</br>  <br>Ancient chinese magic.<br><br>And airbrushes.</br></br></br>  <br>James you're a fat fuck aren't you?</br>     Baccano novels licensed  <br>Guess I'll be buying localized for this first time.</br>  <br>My dick needs this.</br>  <br>Thats retarded logic.<br>You're implying if those scalpers didn't buy them all up to resell them, no one else would have bought them, they would have just sat there, no one who actually wants them for the sake of actually owning them would have bought them, nope.</br></br>  <br>Running drogas for the cartel keeps him fit.</br>  <br>I'm a little girl</br>  Plain as fuck.  <br>That tongue</br>  <br>I never said that, I said that they help the industry by buying and PO, not that they would buy the entire supply to resell as you implied, and yes it's better for the manufactures to sell their items faster, than to lower their prices.</br>  <br>I don't like her face. Looks too uguu, just like the sculptor's Sonico.</br>  <br>What the fuck is going on with her mouth?</br>  <br>I still can't stand that fucking bra(it's too tiny), for some reason it looks awful when the breasts aren't big enough.</br>  <br><br>Leave him be, he is Mexican, it's not like he can own more than a figure or two.</br></br>  <br>That is literally one of the only two good things about this fig. The other one being her opened shorts.</br>   just ordered this <br> havent even seen queen's blade <br><br>fucking pirates man, sento pirate when</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Denim shorts and bikini top is literally my favorite thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Or a few dozens, just as anyone who has been here for more than a few days might know.</br>  <br> bikini top too small <br> shorts can't even button up <br>She just seems fat.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Am I the only one who thought it was Female Luffy?</br></br></br>  <br>She's wearing undersized clothes, obviously.<br>If you look at that and think 'fat' you really should talk to a professional.</br></br>  <br>Except they would never have to lower their prices in the first place and still sell out. Those resellers are leeching off the industry.</br>  <br> not liking skinny girls <br>That Sonico reminds me a bit of the old illustrations.</br></br>  <br> If you look at that and think 'fat' you really should talk to a professional. <br>Hurr, so edgy.</br></br>  <br>So glad I managed to find her for pre-order after BiJ sold out and I thought all hope was lost. Mio and Ritsu looking best though</br>  <br>pleb taste. might as well buy nude figures</br>  <br>Since I forgot about it, I did think of it as female Luffy for a second, which they should make.</br>  <br>I was in that line for 3 hours for Mako...</br>  http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/crim<wbr>inalizing-cartoons-how-the-law-is-d<wbr>ealing-with-anime-child-pornography<wbr>-in-canada?utm_source=vicefbca<br><br> this pic <br><br>im off <br>how does it feel to live in a shithole of murrica?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  Kill bootlegs.  <br>Why does her buttcrack go so high?</br>  <br>More 7th Dragons, I know they're already crafting the molds for III</br>  So as I was cleaning my figures I moved my old cumrag and saw a bunch of silverfish come out of it.<br>Does anyone know if silverfish can harm the pvc on the figures?</br>  <br>I'm glad I live in the land of the  sorta  free.<br>At least the sentencing isn't really harsh for illustrated works.</br></br>  <br>They can't, they will fuck up your books, clothes and figure boxes though</br>  <br>Yes they eat the grease from your fingerprints by scraping it off with their sharp tongue and can cause scratches to soft materials like plastics.</br>  Should I do it? This would be the last box for the series, the other two are already uploaded.  <br>I was in line 4 hours to get into the exhibit hall when they decided to say "Fuck it" and let everyone rush in. Because of that I had to wait another 2 hours in the GSC line. I got magical winter miku for 50 and 2 makos for 90 dollars.</br>  <br>these painted plus a scale of best boy</br>  <br>At least it's not bed bugs.</br>  <br>This is why I hate Canada sometimes.</br>  <br> cumrag <br>Why do people do this? Just cum into the toilet, or a tissue or something disposable.</br></br>  <br>I can't handle a wonfes. So much stuff. So little money. I'm really hyped for Gatchaman nendos</br>  <br>Gross</br>  <br> Just cum into the toilet <br>You can't be a male if you think this is possible.</br></br>  Do anons have any idea of where I can find stock of old GKs? Specifically this Volks kit of mai waifu here? The closest I've come is Hobbyfan, but it's not actually in stock there.<br><br>Am I just delusional?</br></br>  <br>More or less, if you don't run down the streets acting like a faggot, no one cares about you. Keep slaves in your backyard, have more guns than silverware, hop on the internet and ask strangers for sex, just don't let anyone see you and you'll be fine.</br>  <br>I'm a male and it's possible.</br>  <br>What are you trying to say? You can't cum while standing up?</br>  <br><br>Toilets are disgusting, for starters. To add onto that, I can't aim my ejaculation perfectly into a toilet like I can with urine. It would get on the wall and on my hand.</br></br>  <br>No, you're just retarded.</br>  <br> Toilets are disgusting <br>And?<br> It would get on the wall  <br>Aim down.<br> and on my hand <br>Wash them when you're done, like you should be doing anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least I'm not disgusting.</br>  <br> Toilets are disgusting, for starters <br><br><br>And cumrags are not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are beyond disgusting, a fucking cumrag? Seriously? At least toilets are regularly cleaned and have flowing clean water at any time instead of a piece of cloth with your dried semen.</br>  <br> Cumrag <br> Silverfish <br> Not disgusting </br></br></br>  <br>My number one hope is Sidonia scales that aren't Ena Hoshijiro.</br>  <br>I cum into a toilet sitting down nigga.<br>Comfy as fuck and i can shit right after.</br></br>  <br> fapping without your computer <br>What the fuck are you doing anon<br>Also it takes me like 30 minutes to fap, and fuck if I'm gonna sit on the toilet for 30 minutes</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>How do you get rid of those things?</br></br></br>  <br>Cellphones and tablets exist you know, and in a different note, so do disposable tissues.</br>  <br> Not having a smart phone <br>Start at your computer and when you're ready to go take your phone with you into the bathroom and let er rip.</br></br>  <br>You burn your house down</br>  <br> Toilets are disgusting <br>Meanwhile, you have an old cumrag sitting in your room with bugs in it. Also, you're supposed to clean your toilet once in a while.</br></br>  What's your grail?<br><br>This is mine. No matter where I look, I can't even find it on sale. The last sold listing on eBay was 4 years ago, and it sold for around $500.  :( </br></br>  <br>You think this faggot cleans anything if he has fucking bugs crawling out of his cumrag?<br>I feel sorry for the people who could've been the owners of whatever figures he owns.</br></br>    <br> 30 min to masturbate <br><br>what the fuck man, why does it take you so long? also, you can bring your tablet/cellphone to the toilet</br></br></br>  <br>I wish it only took me 30 minutes.<br>I get so picky it takes me hours to fucking fap just because I can never decide what to finish off to.</br></br>  <br>I'm male, and I exclusively cum in the toilet or in a trash can.</br>  <br>My penis has a high angle of attack which makes it almost impossible for me to aim down into a toilet.<br>Also wiping your dick on tissue is terrible because it doesn't get it completely off and it leaves tissue residue all over you.</br></br>  <br>I want him too</br>  <br>Combine large amounts of ammonia and bleach. Silverfish hate the smell and should leave within few ays.</br>  <br><br>I'm not the guy who keeps a cumrag.</br></br>  <br>Do I mix them together anon?<br>I want to make sure the silverfish leave.</br></br>  <br> doesn't want to sit on the toilet for lengthy periods of time <br>Where the hell else are you gonna read books and stuff?

Glad I never took that job in Toronto and stayed in the US.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can bugs masturbate?</br>  <br>I meant stand and ejaculate into the toilet, like peeing standing up.<br><br>That's not disgusting in the slightest, especially compared to what you said, or sitting on a cumrag and infesting one's house.</br></br></br>      <br>Search for the doujins by Chiba Tetsutarou at sadpanda, enjoy.</br>  <br>You're able to masturbate so I'd assume so</br>  <br>What is it?</br>  <br> That's not disgusting in the slightest <br>Except that you're looking at and smelling the place where you shit and piss.<br> especially compared to what you said, <br>I didn't say anything. Remember, I am not the cumrag anon. I prefer using a tissue - not a paper towel or napkin or toilet paper - a tissue, and flushing the dirty tissue. Or just doing it in the shower and letting the water wash the cum away. If I ever used an old sock out of desperation, that thing would be thrown away immediately. There is no reusing cumrags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want a Maria figure.</br>  <br>I have opposable thumbs. Bugs do not.</br>  <br>There is no difference between using the shower and toilet.<br>You pretty much outed yourself as a dirty nigger who doesn't clean his toilet, please leave.<br>Also<br> standing to cum </br></br></br></br>  <br>My thumbs work together in harmony.</br>  <br>Go wash your hair in your toilet then.</br>  <br> He's never humped the shit out of his pillow before <br>Wouldn't recommend doing it often because supposedly it'll fuck up your dick if you do it too much, but it can be done.

This pose it great.  <br>I have a few fatties.</br>  <br> Being this retarded <br>Do you understand context faggot?<br>There's no difference between using the toilet or shower for cumming.<br>Just fuck off, you're so unbelievably stupid, you should've just shut the fuck up instead of replying with that shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You said sit on the toilet whilst ejaculating into it. So yes, you did say something.<br><br>The fact that that is how you interpreted the idea using the toilet is jarring.</br></br></br>  She has a cute butt. Is this girl any good? I haven't gotten around to watching Nisekoi but I want this scale.  What's your experience with goodyjapan and toranoana? Are they the best option for tora?

If you buy figures because they are hot or have cute asses or whatever you're seriously stupid. It's like buying porn magazines and sticking them to your walls.</br>  <br>Okay</br>  god damn im so fucking tempted right now, but I just bought and pre-ordered a shit load of figs right now.  <br>Okay</br>  <br> It's like buying porn magazines and sticking them to your walls. <br>You mean, like normalfags do?</br></br>  <br>Everyone is best girl except marika.</br>  <br>Not a footfag but i'm partial to the sneakers and almost no clothing she's got going on.</br>  <br>But they still charge you a 250Y bank transfer fee, no? That's 750Y. <br>BiJ goes flat 500, 2you4 is 180/300 with free repacking. Not that you need repacking anyway.</br></br>  Double peace signs came with the 2-star Mako nendo. Oh, the many possibilities.  <br>Toranoana items usually come packaged in paper envelopes though, that's hardly enough for international shipping.<br><br>Also, BiJ Charges you 500Y for repacking on top of those 500y</br></br></br>  <br>Because there are no figures of original characters, right?</br>  <br>I own her, she's absolutely adorable, do it.</br>  <br> 2you4 <br>They charge 180Y per item for repacking. On top of the base 180Y</br></br>  <br>Fuck, now I have to buy that solely for the double piece signs</br>  <br> That paint blemish on her white uniform <br>Good thing mine doesn't have that or else my autism would always haunt me whenever seeing that.</br></br>  <br> implying that USA is free <br>people have been convicted for obscenity charges and under state laws</br></br>  <br>disgusting</br>  <br>Actually, both the alternatives you mention have higher fees once you consider repacking.</br>  <br>man i love butts, even if there plastic<br><br>shit sometimes the plastic ones turn me on more</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't exclude it from being stupid. You're just a horny fuck that collects statues of porn. It's the worst kind of figure.</br>  <br>I'll take anything over blemishes on a figure's face.<br>That little spot on my akarin is nothing.</br></br>  TFW you can manipulate Yuya into doing anything you want by saying "Yuzu."  Why can't I have a near insane, unbelievably cute, tomato haired boy to make me feel like the most special citrus across all the dimensions<br>Yuzu you have no idea how lucky you are</br>  Ruri~   Yuya cries in the middle of his duel with Jack <br> Jack walks over and executes this again <br>I'd be laughing and crying at once</br></br>   Literally the same as LDS' Center Court   <br>Yuzu is being well taken care of by Yugo, he's given her more than Yuya ever could. <br><br>Well Reiji has had to have been to the other dimensions to even know about Xyz and Synchro, Heartland, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>So the Friendship Cup is entirely done on D-Wheels?</br>  Yuya is being held back by his devotion to Yuzu. It lets Reiji manipulate him, and it lets Jean Micheal manipulate him, and it'll probably let Yuri manipulate him. <br><br>It's a problem, and it's pretty hard to overcome. Not even Yoko could convince him to give up that goal. <br><br>But how can Yuya be free of this devotion to Yuzu?<br><br>If Yuzu joins the Lancers, then it's just another liability to exploit. If Yuzu gets captured, then its just another yoke for Reiji to use on Yuya. <br><br>If Yuzu gets carded, then the universe collapses and we have a full BAD END.<br><br>The only hope Yuya has of being free of Yuzu is for Yuzu herself to turn him against her.<br><br>In other words, she'll have to play the Villainous Heel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I will only do the laughing part if it happens.</br>   Arc-V S2 ends with the revelations of Yusho working hand on hand with Leo <br> "It´s just a way to bring EGAO for everyone, Yuya" <br> They explain that making the Yu´s was a mistake and they only bring chaos <br> They made the Ruris instead to suppress their power <br> It´s revealed that Yuri already has control of his power </br></br></br></br>   Dimension laid to waste <br> Sister kidnapped <br> Partner literally erased from existence <br> Has to see lookalikes of his sister constantly <br> Both lookalikes use fusion of all things <br> Has to see lookalikes of his partner constantly too <br> DDDDDDD keeps using Heartland as a stage <br> LDS team up against him <br> Those knight people team up against him <br> stalled for the rest of the day in a duel he didn't give a shit about, then blown down the stairs <br> Obelisk force team up against him <br> fell into Synchro alone <br> conned into underground dueling <br>It's like whenever the writers want something bad to happen they say "it's okay, use Shun, he can take it"<br> &gt;Accepts all this with no regrets in the hopes of finding his sister </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They also shill him the most. Fair trade.</br>  <br>I'd be laughing and crying at once even harder if Reiji "keikaku doori" Akaba punched Yuya in the stomach for losing to Jack. Especially considering Yuya tried (and failed) to punch Reiji before.<br><br>Now imagine if Reiji punched Yuya in the stomach, on live-national TV, while Yuzu was watching... how angry will Yuzu be if she found out that Reiji punched Yuya, and/or the fact that the Academia/Battle Royale thing was indirectly his fault because 2000 damage penalties and not intervening himself.</br></br></br>  <br> him <br> not Reiji <br>Reiji is literally above and beyond writer's pet at this point, he probably actually exists and is writing himself into the show</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. After this tournament Yuya and Yuzu will reunite. They'll rescue the Ruris together. Reiji will die from diabetes.</br>  Reminder that everything was according to keikaku.  Hey does Mono do batches or have a website? I got a new laptop and have no way to transfers my old subs over. I dread having to redownload everything.  <br>You a chick anon <br>Im sure anyone anon in here would like you to be their Yuzu<br>Dont give up hope</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji seems like the person who'd have a balanced diet though. Sora is the number one candidate. <br> Shiun'in Sora <br> Shun in Sora <br>Oh my</br></br></br></br>  I wonder how long the Friendship Cup will be.  What are the chances of Yuya beating Jack?<br>5%?</br>  <br>I'm just a skinny little boy anon, I have no chance ;_;<br><br>0% normally, but since Reiji's betting on it I don't know how to feel</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Reiji betting on Yuya beating Jack after the Friendship Cup?<br><br>The upcoming duel is just an exhibition match</br></br></br>  <br>Impossible, he's gonna lose for sure but gonna give a good fight.</br>  <br>0% it is</br>  <br> Reiji is literally above and beyond writer's pet <br><br>Are we talking about the same guy who would have lost to Barrett in episode 40 had Barrett not misplayed? To be specific, Barrett could have crashed his Fusion with Temujin, summoned back the materials, attack with both materials for 3500 damage, then Reiji's Covenant would burn 1000 LP and he would (kinda) get OTK'd.<br><br>Let that sink in: Reiji, the main rival, almost got OTK'd by a fodder character, and the only reason he didn't was because of a misplay. I don't think Kaiba ever came close to losing like that in a one-on-one duel, Manjoume maybe but I doubt it, definitely not Jack, and Kaito only has one loss to his name.<br><br>Shun is UNDENIABLY the most shilled character in ARC-V. Even his duel record speaks for itself since the only duels he didn't win was getting BTFO by Sora (in their rematch, after Shun won the first one) and the duel with Dennis was interrupted, and that duel tried to hype the fuck out of Shun by handicapping him to 1000 LP for no reason other than to make him look good.<br><br>On a positive note, I am very certain that Shun will be carded by Yuri once Academia realises that there are two Ruris in Synchro Dimension. Even more so if Yuri's first on-screen duel is fodderising Shun, then going after Serena. I expect Yuri will suceeed in capturing Serena but Yuzu won't be captured for some reason. Either Yuri is satisfied with just getting Serena, or whoever goes after Yuzu (probably Sora) will fail either due to getting wrecked or because he don't want to hurt/capture Yuzu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiji only agreed to the exhibition match, but whether or not he thinks Yuya has a chance against kingu in that match is unknown</br>  <br>Stay assblasted Sora</br>  <br><br>JACK ATLAS IS HAPPENING<br>HE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING<br>I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally I just want to get back to the Yuya Yuzu traged- er, romance. Yes, romance.</br>  <br>Shun duels more.</br>  63 subs when  <br>We all know Reiji's getting focus in the endgame.<br><br>Shun will get carded in part 3. Probably inches away from Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun will get carded in part 3. <br> Shun will get carded when both Sawatari who jobs whenever he's given the chance and Gongenzaka my ace monster is Benkei. </br></br>  <br>Don't you remember Zexal II? Everyone's going to die, except for Reiji, Yuya, and Yuzu, and then Reiji and Yuzu will die too.</br>  <br> Shun will get carded in part 3. Probably inches away from Ruri. <br>Pls no<br>I'm pretty sure Yuuto's soul would literally break Yuuya as soon as he hears of it</br></br></br>  <br> Don't you remember Zexal II? <br>No because Zexal is medicare trash.</br></br>  <br>Staying Alive~ Staying Alive~</br>  Guys do you have any gifs/webms of duelists smashing the cards on the disc? I love this shit.  <br>Fucking Kotori. Why did you get to witness Shark's death? You didn't do anything!</br>  <br> Don't you remember Zexal <br>No</br></br>  <br> Don't you remember Zexal II <br>No, I stopped watching around the time Vector revealed himself to Yuma.</br></br>  <br>What's that?</br>   even the hippies made a cameo   <br> Don't you remember Zexal II? <br><br>What is a Zexal? What is a Heartland?<br><br>Zexal was the worst YGO series and no, Zexal II was not significant enough to change that. It had the worst MC, the worst main girl, and the worst rival. The only reason it doesn't have the worst bro is because Sho has that title. At least Shark was pretty cool.<br><br>When people imply Zexal was any good, what they really mean is "just Shark, Kaito, III, IV and Vector were good". IMO, Vector is overrated considering he is literally Bakura 2.0, which is fitting since Zexal itself is a shittier version of DM.<br><br>The "everyone dies thing" was retarded since it was done at the end but they revived EVERYONE so it rendered those deaths completely worthless. It would have been better to leave Kaito and the others dead since it would have more of an impact.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KONMAIIIIII<br>WHERE'S MY CARLY AND SHERRY ?!<br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inb4 the helmet prevents Yuya from recognizing Yuzu</br>  I actually didn't expect a council that's a whole tier higher in authority over Jean, since Godwin was the de facto ruler over Neo Domino  <br>Yo Bob Page what's up</br>  <br> since Godwin was the de facto ruler over Neo Domino <br> Godwin was in Yliaster. <br> Yliaster were the true masterminds. <br><br>Honestly, I saw this coming considering how insignificant Godwin was compared to Aporia's embodiments in terms of authority. I wasn't expecting that there would be five though, I was expecting it to be three purely to draw parallels to Lucciano, Placido and Jose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if there will be this many cameos when we get to Academia.</br>  <br>Is that motherfucking flame manipulator?</br>  <br> Carly <br> Ever coming back <br>Ha.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it does not seem to be fucking any mothers</br>  <br>IIRC, isn't the director of ARC-V also the same person who did 5Ds? So unless he happens to be impartial, I think we'll get cameos but not as much because of possible 5Ds director bias.<br><br><br>It is. Dungeon Worm however, gets the glory of taking on a filler god card which was so insignificant. Especially considering Team Ragnarok came after Team Taiyou and the Aesir Synchros made Zushin look like shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Though is the mother trying to fuck the Flame Manipulator?</br>  <br>I remember Yliaster, but besides the white tuxedo man, they never made a direct appearance in the first 64 episodes and left everything about the city to Godwin until after he died.</br>  This episode made me realize QUALITY Shun is actually really cute in his own way   Reiji walking through the front freaking door <br>Based</br>  tfw thinking of Yuzu  If I have any real issue wih this episode, it would be having the weakest 'BRAVE CLAW REVOLUTION' segment out of them all.<br>No good eye movement, lazy hand trigger</br>  <br> yuzu <br>I think you mean sawatari</br></br>  <br>Don't worry Yuya, it's not like you're karmically destined to kill your waifu or anything.</br>  This jii-chan has eyebrows almost as fancy as Aporia's  <br>FTK-tari is going to go down before Shun is.</br>  <br> tfw can't hold him tenderly </br>  <br>She doesn't even know Yuya is alive. It'll probably be a relief when she sees him on tv<br><br> And then a nightmare when he gets crushed by the King. </br></br></br>  I am so glad Tokumatsu became pat of the group for now  <br>He'll be part of the power trio in the end, mark my words</br>  <br>Why is the dude behind him high? God, his eyes.</br>  <br>Damn, he even towers over Gon, and it's not like Gon is small</br>  <br>Yeah but he's not currently on Arc-V since he's working on Symphogear</br>  <br>Gon ain' that tall, especially with Getas off</br>  <br>Having a deck that combos being really Japanese with /m/ seems to make you huge.</br>  <br>Wouldn't he simply be working on two shows at once? What are you supposed to do if the director isn't available at all?</br>  <br>Gon's height is inconsistent to be honest. He's not usually that short.</br>  <br>I wonder if they ever duel, if they'll actually use the Timelords<br><br>This can't be just a coincidence, right?</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love that Riding Suit holy shit it's so sleek</br>  <br>Man Shun is pissed off at whatever is to the right<br>Akaba looks like a model but I think Reira wants to murder the viewer<br>And of course Yuuya's just asking for the biggest hug imaginable</br></br></br>  <br>Him and Sawatari add comic relief which is nice</br>  <br>Shun: "just turn off the camera already"</br>  <br>The assistant director<br><br>And I think anon meant he's paying more attention to Symphogear than Arc-V as of right now since Symphogear GX is new and Arc-V has already been set in motion</br></br></br>  <br> Cute Yuya slowly turning hot <br>Hmmm</br></br>  <br>Yeah, his size seems to hover between 2-3x Yuya's size</br>  What if Jack lets Yuya win?  <br>Wrong. Reiji isn't the writer's pet. It's Shun. Why do you think he gets to have the coolest of duels ever since he got to Synchro? Kamishiro, the headwriter, also writes most of the episodes he's been prominent in.<br><br>Nips don't really like Reiji that much. Shun is the most favorite due to how he's easily meme'd. Even he seems to be the animators' pet, especially the Nips animators.</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC Yuya and Yuzu are the most popular characters, with Sora in third and Shun in fourth.</br>  <br>That would be anti climactic. Jack probably has a lot riding on his unbroken winning streak, even for exhibition matches.</br>  <br>He won't. The reason for the Friendship Cup is to win and fight Jack Atlas to become the new Duel King. People don't know who the hell Yuya is and otherwise don't care for him just like Yusei. They want to duel Jack because fighting him is like a dream come true to a lot of Commons.</br>  <br> Shun has basically been leashed by Reiji for the entire series so far <br>The guy controls everything. He said it himself- he'll never play something he won't win.</br></br>  <br>Sora was second until he lost all screen time. I bet the Xyz scum did this to him.</br>  <br>Yuzu was more popular than Sora even before the Synchro Arc started<br><br>And the Synchro Arc so far really didn't give Yuzu a lot to do. She's been off-screen for most of it.</br></br></br>  So is Jack going to be the cold hearted guy from the beginning of 5Ds or the developed guy towards the end (or at least the end of the first half)?<br><br>I'm glad, Sora was always worst boy</br></br>  <br>Sora's popularity has been going down though ever since Synchro started. He's being slowly replaced by Shun.<br><br>Yuya and Yuzu are a given since they're the main protagonist and main girl that does something other than Yuya.wav.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Heck even the latest duel was just an excuse for another Shun saves the day.</br>  <br>Its funny that Sora became LESS important after beating Shun, whereas Shun was the writers pet.<br><br><br>Yuzu is the main female of ARC-V, therefore she is expected to be more popular than Sora. If she wasn't, I would have been surprised. Though Sora started becoming irrelevant after his first lost to Shun, and became even more so after getting his revenge. This will probably continue to be so now that Yuri is around, though that didn't stop Shun overshadowing Yuto.<br><br>Also female characters tend to get more fanart than male characters unless its the main protagonist or its a really feminine guy (e.g. III). IIRC, the main female tends to be the 2nd or 3rd most popular character in each YGO series, except DM where Anzu and Mai were basically the only females who appeared more than once.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon is only 14. Just imagine how huge he'll be in a couple of years</br>  <br>Cold hearted<br><br>He even looks like it in the opening and preview</br></br></br>  <br>  I will never have my own kawaii Yuzu <br>Life is suffering<br>Why even live</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sick of Shun. Why can't someone else save the day or do something cool.</br>  <br> I will never have my own protective Yuuya <br>Continued existence seems pointless</br></br>  <br>So long as he stays away from Yuzu duels I'm fine with him.</br>  <br>Are you kawaii anon im into kawaii</br>  <br> not wanting to be saved by the most revolutionary man <br>You are awful.</br></br>  We need more adult Arc-V characters, someone get on it.  <br>  Mother of Ra  <br>now thats a milf i'd marry<br>  implying im lucky to get my own Yuzu hahahaha good one </br></br></br>  <br>Maaaaaybe <br><br>Nothing stands in the path to his Ruri  which is why Ruri will obviously be a villain </br></br></br>  <br> a bunch of middle to high school aged teenagers <br> a bunch of street rat young adults <br> and then old man Chojiro <br>And I thought the Lancers were a motley crew before</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya you're cracking a bit, calm down man.</br>   Shun is surrounded by two Ruris that both use Fusion <br> Shun runs into the real Ruri who has been brainwashed and uses Fusion <br> Shun thinks it's Serena who has betrayed <br> Shun battles her and ends up killing her <br> Only as she lays dying the brainwash breaks and reveals she's Ruri and not Serena <br> Shun goes on a homicidal suffering rampage <br> It will only end with his blind bloodlust getting carded </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fanarts-wise in pixiv, Sora was popular than Yuzu. Although they're always at a close fight. But back before Yuzu.flac, despite Sora and Yuzu having a close gap in fanarts, Sora does usually win. After that, Yuzu closed the gap and proceeds to have more than him. Even Shun is closing the gap against Sora.<br><br>If this keeps going with no cool Sora appearance, Serena might close the gap between her and Sora too by the end of the year.<br><br>Whilst Shun is the writer's pet, Serena would be the animator's pet. Right now, they're both seem to be like Nips favorites next to the obvious Yuya and Yuzu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Shun would just spontaneously commit suicide upon realizing that he killed his sister, heaven forbid that ever happen (please no)</br>  <br>  Maaaaybe  <br>Im sold anon</br></br>  <br>I want this to happen. I would be laughing the whole time.</br>  <br>The suffering of Shun is my favorite thing about these threads and I love Shun. But lets be realistic this is YGO, it's the children's equivalent to Gundam, suffering must happen. <br><br>He must continue on, to get revenge on the bastards who caused this.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu's passed all of the Zexal girls in fanart on Pixiv now, so she's doing something right for them. She's actually only got Ruka and Aki left to pass now, if I remember right.</br>  <br>Sora pls leave permanently<br><br>Shun's suffering only adds to his best boy status (though that title's shared with Yuuya)</br></br></br>  <br> Yuri is compelled by his dragon to be evil and threaten the Ruris <br> Yuya will eventually absorb Yuri <br> Super Egao 4 Mode activates at that time, and Yami Yuya fights his waifu </br></br></br>  Why is Serena's deck made entirely of waifu material?  YAMEROOOOO  <br>Holy shit he has big ears in edge mode</br>  <br>Because she's a girl in ygo. Only girls ever exempt from this are Aki and Ruka.</br>  <br>Yfw when Yuya will say <br>Shine!</br></br>  <br>Because <br><br>Fighting Xyz by moonlight<br>Winning duels by daylight<br>Never running from a real fight!<br>She is the one named Sailor Rena!<br>She will never turn her back on a friend<br>She is always there to defend<br>She is the one on whom we depend</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only girls ever exempt from this are Aki and Ruka. <br><br>Why forget Yubel's deck and to a far greater extent, Anna's deck? Clearly Anna is the crudest, strongest girl because her deck contains no waifu material and is focused on the manly, phallic Train cards. That and her personality.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Serena is the typical tomboy with a girly girl side that gets upset when she's not spoiled with sweets and cute pets. It's why her deck is cute pet waifus, cats, rabbits, etc.</br>   rewatching DM <br> completely forgot that Bakura even existed early on <br>Why don't I have any recollection of this guy in the early series? I knew he existed but the entire time I thought he was off screen. Lo and behold he's right there watching all these battles with the rest of the gang kek</br></br>  <br>New Moonlights when.</br>  <br>Sorry, I forget that characters not named after numbers existed in Zexal all the time.</br>  <br>Never. <br><br>Probably the set after BOSS or BOSS, the one that's after DOCS.</br></br></br>  is this game good? should I play it?  <br> BOSS <br> Not BROS </br></br>  <br>Here is the new Moonlight. ;) </br>  <br>When she duels Yuzu in the tournament.</br>  <br>Pls no<br>Who will I cheer for<br>Man the entire tournament is going to be a rollercoaster of emotions</br></br></br>  <br>Well either one works really. <br><br>You cheer for the best Ruri, Serena.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu will finally have a reason to use Schubert again. Hopefully they at least save that hype for the second round.</br>  <br>But my Yuya will be sad if Yuzu doesn't win<br>And<br> implying there's a best Ruri </br></br></br>  <br>Piss on Yuya, he's ready to let everyone else die for Yuzu, Yuzu is ruining Reiji's glorious and stupid ass plans. <br><br>Serena a best Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have any actual dueling in it, but I found it pretty fun</br>  <br>But anon Yuzu is all part of Reiji's plan, how else would he have gotten Tomato to Synchro?</br>  You niggas ready for the RETURN?  Jean's voice started to sound a lot like Reiji's.<br>Script when btw.</br>  Is Pot of Greed still banned?  <br>The card, but not the pot.</br>  <br>May not get one this week.

It's such a weird omission. <br><br> Here's your script faggots: http://pastebin.com/vfcDHr30 </br></br>  <br><br>Turns out we do have the script<br>http://pastebin.com/wqFG1FJM</br></br></br>  <br>Script is up on NAC actually. Just needs someone who can post the script on pastebin though.</br>  <br>Reiji tried to use Yuzu as the carrot on the stick, it's only fitting that everything go to shit because of that.</br>   Yuya: More importantly, we have to find Yuzu…   <br> Yuya: Yuzu… <br>DEAR GOD HE'S BECOMING KOTORI</br></br>  <br>Thanks. I take it they never did episodes 1 and 2 and just started with 3?</br>  <br>Way too cute</br>  <br>Mono? No. But the first two are subbed by NAC IIRC.</br>  <br> SAWATARI-SAN: Lance Defense Soldiers <br>In other words, we’re Duel Soldiers selected to fight against the Academia..<br> Tokumatsu: Soldier? You? <br> Jean-Michel: HAHAHAHAHA! <br>  SAWATARI-SAN: What’s so funny!?  <br><br>Sawatari is a shit, even Synchro Dimension knows it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So we're agreed that the only way Yuuya will beat Jack is through some hack absorption of Yuugo right?  <br>I see. I originally had NAC's subs but they didn't have a batch.

Is no one subbing Chaos Dragon or Joukamachi no Dandelion? Both first episodes have been out for days. It's not that I was particularly looking forward to either one, it just tickles my autism if I can't at least check out every new show of the season.<br><br>I suppose I could watch the raws, but my nip isn't quite good enough to really get everything.</br></br>  fansubbing is fucking dead son.<br>Personally I blame the jews.<br>My nihongo isnt 100% either but we might aswell start now considering its not gonna get any better.</br></br>  <br>Not even CR? Damn that's sad.</br>  <br>CR is falling apart lately. They've been losing ground to competitors.<br>Daiz warned them, but the CEO didn't listen.</br></br>  If it doesn't get HorribleSubs then nobody subs it.  Both shows have been picked by Funi, who's late with a shitload of shows this season. CD has some subgroup working on.  <br> fansubbing is fucking dead son. <br><br>Sad but true.<br><br><br><br>Yeah I figured at least CR or Funi would do them. They still might I guess, they often delay new stuff at the beginning of the season. Maybe they are still figuring out who is going to get what for the less hyped shows.<br><br>Don't even get me started on the more obscure stuff I was hoping to check out, like Kurayami Santa, or the Salaryman short. I doubt we'll even get raws for some of those types of things. <br><br>Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's usually like this at the beginning of a season. Both are picked up by Funi and Chaos Dragon also has DDY (01 @ Edit/TS).</br>  <br>Your best hopes are probably with commie.</br>  <br> Both shows have been picked by Funi <br><br>I can't decide if this is good news or bad. At least we'll get subs, but they will be abysmally bad ones, and no one else will do them.<br><br>Why is Funi getting everything this season? It's a shame. If they're going to go big and grab up so many shows they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels. <br>When has that ever happened?<br>If anything they'll get worse as their awful translators get overworked because fuck if they're going to hire more.</br></br></br>  <br> they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels. <br> streamfags <br> caring about quality </br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be fine with that. I get why Commie gets a lot of hate, but I don't care about some slightly overdone localization or a meme here or there if I'm at least getting some fucking subs for the less popular shows. My nipponese is good enough that Idon't need to have honorifics and shit in the subs, I can hear them. Sometimes Commie is great when they actually do something seriously. When they are just fucking around and memeing they are bad, but better than nothing.<br><br><br><br>Again, sad but true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thank god  spanish  speedsubs still exists  http://fansubdb.com/wiki/Summer_201<wbr>5<br><br>Funi is always late for the first episode.</br></br></wbr>  <br> Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake. <br>He picked that one up and released the first episode already, but he also mentioned delays for the next few episodes since he'll be in moonland for a while.</br></br>  <br>They don't have to bother because they don't have any competition.<br>I'm still hoping some group will pick up some of their shows like Ranpo Kitan or Prison School.</br></br>  <br> Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake. <br><br>Good news. A heroic fansubber (Mori) has done Wakako-zake.</br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br> 15 results <br> Crunchyroll <br> 24 results <br><br>Funi's creeping up. This does not bode well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   simulcasting gobbles up everything <br> fansubbing dies apart from CR rebrands and BD groups <br> everyone gets complacent as the years go by with their lightning fast releases of shit <br> eventually the gravy train slows down <br> it keeps slowing </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm an uncultured burgerclap, but I've considered trying to watch spicsubs. I picked up a little Spanish here and there, and it's an easy language. Took Latin in highschool so that helps.<br><br>Really my time would be better served improving my already semi-conversational moonspeak though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thank you based Mori</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;eventually the gravy train slows down <br>Why would it?<br>Their business model is cheap (all the work they need to put in is write up a few subtitle scripts) and has a huge audience (1% of the English-speaking world?).<br>It's not something that will slow down ever, now that it exists.</br></br></br></br>  I'd rather watch raws than Funi.  <br>I wish ISIS would bomb Funi's offices.</br>  <br> If it doesn't get HorribleSubs then nobody subs it. <br>Welcome to /a/. I would say "enjoy your stay", but really you need to fuck off and die.</br></br>  <br><br>I greatly enjoy memesubbing too, Mori and that Anon who banesubbed Gatchaman might be the saviors of fansubbing. I wish they worked on more memeshows.</br></br>    <br>What did Daiz say to them? Who is competing with CR? Only one I can think of is Netflix but they get old shit</br>  <br>Tried what? I'm being honest here.</br>  <br> What did Daiz say to them? <br>He told them they can't get control of the market if they went with the exclusive rights business model.<br>They said they were going to do it, and now they are losing more and more titles to funimation.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon tried to provoke a hostile reaction from people who are happy that Wakako got subs.</br>  When will Funi die? They're pure cancer.  I want to watch this qt already.  <br>Why are they cancer</br>  What I don't understand is how people still pay for Funi when CR exists. Not to say that CR is good at all but Funi is so dogshit that CR is better just by not being complete incompetent shitheads.  <br>My only complaint is that they darken the colors on all their shows, sometimes to the point where you can't tell what's going on (Bahamut). I can't fault them for hard-subbing their streams, though. Anons who take issue with the mere existence of English anime dubs might also count producing those as a sin on Funi's part, as if English dubbed anime wasn't what got them into Japanese cartoons.</br>  <br>They charged money for their Nourin sub.</br>  <br> darken the colors on all their shows <br>Why do they even do this?</br></br>  <br>They're both bad anyway</br>  <br> darken the colors <br><br>Why even fucking bother with this? Whats the point?</br></br></br>  Fansubbing has been dead since CR became popular. We're living in a time where no one except CR subbed a Tomino Gundam show. How in the fuck does that even happen?  <br><br>It's not deliberate. Their colour range gets fucked up by default, so you just have to manually fix it. Takes two seconds with MadVR.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is my best guess. Perhaps someone has an answer in the archives.</br>  Are Underwater and DDY the only ones subbing summer shows so far?  <br> How in the fuck does that even happen? <br><br>When the show wound up being shit.</br></br></br>  <br>How do I do that in MPV? Or, rather, what exactly should I be trying to do to fix the color range?</br>  <br>Because the R1 subs are good?</br>  <br>The problem wasn't CR. It was G-reco.</br>  <br> commie did a thing. </br>  <br>Also Glitch and Mori. FFF got Classroom Crisis subbed today as well.</br>  <br>The answer's pretty obvious</br>  <br>Changing the output level does not fix the awful colors. It makes it a little better but it's still complete garbage.</br>  <br>FFF and Commie also released stuff.</br>  <br>You can't really trust FFF. They either release shows quickly or end up several weeks behind (Nisekoi, Hibike etc.). I'd rather just stick with HS. <br><br><br>Vivid is doing Durarara right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>why would you go with FFF for Nisekoi</br>  It's been 10 years since this ended and nobody subbed this series besides the first two episodes  <br>Durarara, NNB and Gakkou Gurashi apparently.</br>  <br> mfw those Psycho Pass releases </br>  <br>why don't you sub it</br>  <br> You can't really trust FFF. <br>As true as that is, it doesn't really follow as a response to "FFF has released subs for a summer show."<br><br>I'd hope Vivid is on DRRRRRR, but it's hard to tell with their standard radio silence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I'm just telling you about some shows FFF has subbed.</br>  Somebody please pick-up Dandelion.  <br>CR didn't sub it iirc tho<br><br>HS had to rip from some Aussie anime streaming service that got official subs</br></br></br>    <br>But I'm THAT Anon and I didn't try to provoke any hostile reaction. With being honest I meant I like their memesubs.</br>  <br><br>Every group is really slow at the weekend, has been like that for a few seasons now. It used to be the other way around.</br></br>  <br> Is Underwater the only one subbing summer shows so far? <br><br>Looks like it. I know Commie released Symphogear but I'm not watching it so I don't care.</br></br></br>  DameDesuYo just released Working!!! 10 seconds ago.  <br>Funi needs more "-Couldn't read this part, but she's saying something about food-" and obvious translation errors.</br>  <br> mfw when gg used to release CG subs in like 4-5 hours on Sundays <br><br>rip in peace gg</br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708393</wbr> <br>kek</br></br>  <br> The torrent you are looking for has been deleted for the following reason(s): <br> Web source video is limited to 1280x720p or source resolution, whichever is lower. <br>SASUGA CARTEL<br>Seriously, fuck Daiz and his fuckbuddies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss those times</br>  <br> literally wanting to download eye cancer <br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Do Funi not get scripts for the simulcasts?<br>CR are confirmed to.</br></br>  <br>It's simulcast, who gives a shit?</br>  <br>touche</br>  <br> eye cancer <br>Where?</br></br>  <br>I hope they don't, otherwise that would make them even more incompetent.<br>the only reason I can come up with for their subs in shows like Norin is that they weren't able to get a script or see the episode before making the subs.</br></br>  <br> Note about the script.

They're huge enough faggots.</br>  <br>Nice /pol/.</br>  <br> why not <br>Probably because they're not as dumb as you</br></br>  <br>Nice /v/.</br>  I don't know why groups like FFF even bother picking up like 8 shows when they can never finish them. Did they finish a single show that they picked up in the Spring? <br><br>What tremendous fuckups.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much describes /a/ in a nutshell.</br>  <br>I'd and most of the other staff would quit if that happened.</br>  <br>stop trying to shift the subject commie dev, i know your trying to make people ignore your shit fuck off</br>  <br>You just wait.</br>  <br>I fucking hate commie and never use their releases in the first place. I'm just getting tired of FFF's bullshit.</br>  You will never watch more than 26 episodes of Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo with subs  <br> commie devs trying to shift the blame to FFF so people ignore their shits </br>  <br><br>Commie is an amazing subgroup, look at how they finished Yahari while FFF hasn't even gotten halfway.</br></br>  <br> literally a commie dev <br>And I wondered why this thread is so shit. Pls go and stay go.</br></br>  <br> mom look I posted it again! </br>  <br>They finished Danmachi</br>  <br>Herkz is drowning in his own unwarranted self importance. It doesn't help that almost everyone on NT trips over themselves to suck his cock and worship him like a deity.</br>  <br><br/></br>  How do I encode like Commie?  Watch Herkz whine about this thread on twitter and how everyone's picking on his shit infested group.  <br>does that include you</br>  <br>I stopped downloading FFF for danmachi after they fell 2 weeks behind. I didn't care enough about the show to get quality subs for it anyway. <br><br>Still waiting for them to finish DxD Born and catch up on Rinne.</br></br></br>  <br> Watch Herkz whine about this thread on twitter <br><br>Why would I do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for Cthune to finish Rolling Girls because I refuse to watch anything funi makes.</br>  <br>Well, they seem to have realized that picking up that many shows is dumb and only added three shows to their schedule this season, so maybe they're getting a better grip on how much their group can handle.</br>  <br>They dropped Rinne</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Keep trying Commie dev. FFF is bad but not as shit as your</br>  <br><br>Name one thing bad about commie. <br><br>Protip:  you can't. </br></br></br></br>  <br> and catch up on Rinne. <br>They officially dropped it because it's translator is still missing or something like that.</br></br>  <br>They are Commie.</br>  <br>Fuck. I stopped checking their blog and IRC for updates because they never tell people anything anyway. Last time I went there they were throwing a hissy fit over people bugging them about DxD so I just said fuck it and put the show on hold for now. <br><br>Now I have to settle for whoever HS ripped Rinne from.</br></br></br>  <br> catch up on Rinne. <br>I have bad news, anon.<br><br> Due to members of our staff leaving or going missing, along with other staffing issues, the following shows are hereby dropped and will not be completed: <br><br> Kyoukai no Rinne </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Communism must be eradicated.</br>  <br>Surely being in such an important position of running a major torrent site means he's getting paid handsomely right? <br><br>No way he does it for free like 4chan janitors right?</br></br></br>  <br>I got one<br> &gt;commie </br></br>  <br>herkz is one bad thing about Commie, as demonstrated in this thread.</br>  If nothing else this thread is convincing me to go do my Anki reps.  <br>Memes, overlocalization, unnecessary le epic typesetting jojokes.</br>  <br>More like Eien's dead and he typesetted almost every show FFF did</br>   still waiting for Daiz to finish Rinne no Lagrange   <br>At least they're not scanlators.</br>  Thank god we still have HorribleSubs  <br>You nigger, I fucking hate commie. I even bothered to download non-free uncommied subs from AB to avoid their cancerous meme subs. <br><br>I swore off Commie years ago, unlike you dumb pieces of shit who still insist on using them and lying about how "no they're actually good for ______", because of shits like you they've managed to continue on for years where other groups have withered and died. <br><br>FFF was, for a long time, my favorite group since UTW went tits up. They had good quality encodes and typesetting and did a lot of shows. But they've become too unreliable, and they are increasingly bitchy toward people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They officially dropped that a long time ago.</br>  <br><br>Nothing wrong with memes. Take Yahari, it's full of memes and is better for it or else we'd be stuck with a bunch of shitty TL notes.</br></br>  <br> I swore off Commie years ago, unlike you dumb pieces of shit who still insist on using them and lying about how "no they're actually good for ______", because of shits like you they've managed to continue on for years where other groups have withered and died. <br><br>Are you talking about me? Also nice autism commie dev, go back to Rizon already</br></br></br>  <br>I too enjoy my dank and epic maymays in my chinese cartoons!</br>  <br> Cthune <br> not Commie </br></br>  <br>You people call any localization attempt a fucking meme.</br>  <br> Nothing wrong with memes <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with scanlators?</br>  <br>FFF became Commie tier with muh epic maymays since the 1st season of Yahari.</br>  <br><br>Well shit. Looks like FFF is going the way of UTW. <br><br>Vivid still only doing like 2 shows a season and I haven't seen anything from Asenshi or Anime-koi in months. Did Caffeine pick up anything?<br><br>And what about that new group? Chyuu? Seems like they sputtered out during spring too.<br><br>More "missing staff"? Is somebody abducting fansubbers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> redirecting <br>Nice meme</br></br>  If FFF is the face of fansubbing then it should die because of how unreliable and awful their translations are. CR is fast and usually the best translation out there. Only times I will opt for fan subs if it's vivid doing it  <br><br>What was the Japanese line? Chances are it was a perfectly fine localization.</br></br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>Nice meme.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you guys are happy, this shit was tedious to write, especially since they wrote a whole goddamn scene around the senpai-kouhai thing.</br>  <br>Fuck off cunt. Go suck Herkz cock.</br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? <br>Yes, CR.</br></br>  <br> what's wrong with a group of idiots who actually think they own any part of what they translate and have the gall to put watermarks on scanlations so people come to their site to read it so they can make revenue off someone else's work <br><br>Gee I wonder what's wrong with them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Commie devs kill yourselves.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck off I haven't download commie in five years, you go suck his cock memelord.</br>  <br>They don't know Japanese or English</br>  <br>They're the most territorial asswipes on the face of the earth</br>  <br>Commie is almost as bad as Funi in my eyes, stopped downloading them long time ago.</br>  <br> mfw gullible idiots actually paid UTW over $5k in donations </br>  <br>People have lives, you know</br>  <br><br>I bet you downloaded HS for Yahari you faggot.</br></br>  <br>Massive drama queens.</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  Commie devs I know you're in here please sub Joukamachi no Dandelion.  <br>Nice try, Commie dev</br>  <br> watching harems <br><br>No, thanks, I have standards but I can't expect that from a cummie dev<br><br><br>NO FUCK OFF, this has potential tob e AOTS I don't want them to ruin it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more than j-drama subbers?</br>  <br> Commie <br> subbing anything that's no already released by HS </br></br>  <br>I wouldn't know, anon. How bad are those?</br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? </br>  <br> in my eyes <br>Are you blind or something?</br></br>  <br>How did they sub Symphogear yesterday?</br>  <br> moving the goalposts <br><br>Fact of the matter is that Commie had the best subs for Yahari.</br></br></br>  <br>Or GoPrincess Precure for about 20 odd episodes so far.</br>  <br>Symphogear GX</br>  <br>fuck off they at least released a lot of AOTSs unlike other faggots who steal your money like FFF and Commie.</br>  <br>They still were shit.</br>  <br> Did Caffeine pick up anything? <br>No and I wouldn't expect much from them. They have been slow for months and dropped half of their spring projects.</br></br>  <br><br>No they weren't. Name one way they were wrong.</br></br>  <br>The salt is real</br>  has there been any recent reliable and consistent fansubbing group other than commie?  <br>Don't join a group if you can't commit. Don't make people depend on you and then leave them high and dry with no recourse if you suddenly bail on them. <br><br>Main reason I only do rogue translations here and there wherever I feel like it is because I hate being nailed down long term, hate depending on shitty people who can't work to a time table and slack off on the job. <br><br>I've been around the subbing community long enough to know it's mostly arrogant twats whose main response to pressure is to shirk their job entirely until they feel like coming back to it. I've seen people beg off their end claiming family problems then I see them playing TF2 on steam when they haven't been on IRC for 72 hours. <br><br>FUCK fansubbers and their "lives".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   this much commieshilling itt <br>Utterly deplorable.</br>  <br>HorribleSubs.</br>  <br>They're gonna die after this season anyway</br>  <br>Retarded shit like this, for instance.</br>  <br>No why would I be salty? I donated them about U$S 200 (because I can do it) and they subbed my favorite shows, I have no <br><br><br>didn't they die already?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Giving fansubbers money, giving anyone money when they normally provide for free, is a surefire way to make sure they stop working.<br><br>It's one thing to pay them on commission, another to just give them free money for existing. It's like with patreon. Pay the artist money to exist, suddenly their output stalls. Wow what a coincidence.<br><br>That said at least UTW's skeleton crew managed to do F/SN this year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vivid, which is basically another Commie</br>  <br> steal your money <br><br>How can someone steal my money when I never donated anything to any subgroup? Next time, don't be stupid enough to give money to retarded subgroups.</br></br></br>  <br>More like Funi just put in more money and made better deals with the japanese companies than CR. Though it doesn't matter when CR has been grabbing the better shows so far, plus they grabbed NNB Repeat and Monster Musume at AX two days ago.</br>  <br><br>Not a subbing error.</br></br>  At this point now I ask nothing more than CR subs slapped on CR video debanded or BS11, with typesetting and song translated.<br> CR FR is so much better than CR EN.<br>Also can someone rip Gangsta video from CR FR and upload it?</br> </br>  <br>Good thing they're not all like that</br>  <br> That said at least UTW's skeleton crew managed to do F/SN this year. <br><br>They still haven't released the last episode though.</br></br></br>  <br>yea but they hardly do any shows</br>   tfw too stupid to learn nip  <br><br><br>rip</br></br></br>  <br>DDY, which is saying something cause I can remember when people sneered at their releases.<br><br>Also Vivid is pretty reliable. Their Amaburi subs were kinda shit and too Commie-esque for my taste, but normally they are a very good group that actually releases pretty quickly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's gag anime that only panders to homos. <br>No one's going to fansub it and HS won't do it because there's no official english subs to rip off.</br></br>  <br>That's true, DDY is consistently bad.</br>  <br> I donated them about U$S 200 <br>I didn't think retards like you regularly posted here</br></br>  Well at least Funi have Dandelion cause that looks pretty fun, God knows why they wait a fucking week to release it though.<br><br>Funi are actually the worst company.</br></br>  <br>sup Herkz<br><br>what le epic memes will we get next?</br></br></br>  <br>Herkz pls go.</br>  <br>Maybe. The people I worked with were mostly free agents like me so maybe that's why they were free, cause they're all lazy shits.<br><br>I'm telling you though, I almost want to just apply for a job TLing for CR or Funi or whoever will have me at this point. I'm tired of working with lazy shitheels.</br></br></br>  <br>FUcking newfag you weren't you here when the donation drive happened, a lot of us gave them money, there were capped threads and all</br>  <br>There was another season?<br>I used to love the original back when it aired here on TV.<br>Damn it, why did you have to build me up and immediately put me down?</br></br></br>  <br> a lot of us <br> us <br><br>Nah nigga that was just you and your group of idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Commie devs <br> not shilling themselves <br>They are amon us anon</br></br></br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>DDY is bad compared to who? Who is left that is better than them? That's what I mean. Years ago there would have been lots of options to put DDY way down the tier list, but now their only competition are groups that drop everything or fucking Commie, so DDY somehow ended up being a top tier group in 2015.`</br>  <br><br>Are you niggas serious? The only "good" release I've seen from them was Noragami (and even then it was simulcasted, the OAD they subbed was horrible).</br></br>  <br><br> guy who knows Japanese vs random anon off the internet <br><br>Gee I wonder whose opinion I should trust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> giving fansubbers money <br>That's like willingly paying for a CR or Funi membership.</br></br>  Commie devs are just butthurt the Yahari gravy train has ended and they are back to being irrelevant. CR really threw them a bone last season releasing that a day late.  <br>Herkz, plz stop your working butthurt</br>  <br> dicksucking herkz vs anon <br><br>Gee I wonder who I should trust</br></br></br>  <br><br>I would pay for CR if it meant killing Funi.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, nobody believes DDY is any good, but the memecartel is here so we have to attack them.</br>  <br> top tier <br> DDY <br>This thread just gets better and better</br></br></br>  <br> highhorse attentionwhore faggot vs based anon <br>Solved this for you.</br></br>  <br><br>No one gives a shit about Yahari beyond the people in their general. Commie was always irrelevant.</br></br>  <br>No giving fansubbers money is even worse than that. At least CR or Funi are "official" in the sense they actually pay the nip companies some sort of fee. Paying a fansubber is like paying some retarded tranny on tumblr because muh oppression.</br>  <br> my uncle works at gg and they are coming back in the fall <br>I sense epic bait here.</br></br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with knowing Japanese?</br></br>  <br>He doesn't.</br>  <br>They can't improve a simulcast release, that's just how bad they are and whenever they are in trouble (they need to put a lot of effort into a show) they end up falling behind or dropping it, just like every other fansubbing group, the difference is that they suffer from ESL editors and an annoying lack of QC.</br>  <br>I watched the raw and I'm not gonna lie when I say the frame rate and terrible 3D in Chaos Dragon hurt my eyes.</br>  <br>Again: name a group better than them that's still active.<br><br>The only ones that aren't total shit are slow as fuck and whatever they don't drop they are weeks behind on. <br><br>DDY releases consistently and has watchable subs, I put their TL quality at about equal to CRs. And considering they are releasing some uncensored stuff that's censored by CR and Funi, that makes them the best option.</br></br></br></br></br>  Thank god i speak spanish  <br><br>He's an editor, obviously he knows Japanese.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why groups like FFF even bother picking up like 8 shows when they can never finish them. Did they finish a single show that they picked up in the Spring? <br>nope</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what he wants you to think.</br>  <br> the difference is that they suffer from ESL editors <br><br>This, Maria was practically unwatchable (and they even fell behind there).</br></br></br>   mfw people actively wait for commie subs over CR    being EOP   <br><br>Does that make it better? They were still the ones who did that retarded thing.<br>Commieapologists should seriously be rounded up and shot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah their QC is bad their TL becomes shit if they don't have a better script to copy off of, but what other options exist if you want subs in a timely manner? <br><br>I'm actually asking for options here, cause all the groups I used to depend on are gone.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you have some touhou to play?</br>  <br>Vivid. Also, I highly doubt you know Japanese. Even if you did, why bother talking about fansun groups?</br>  <br><br>How the hell are you supposed to edit subs without knowing Japanese? All of commmie's subs have lyrics translated, even the ones with CR as TL and herkz for the rest, so of course he has to know some Japanese.</br></br>  <br> he actually believes this <br><br>His job is to take a decently translated script and then add some dank memes for "localization". That's literally all the faggot does. <br><br>If you don't believe me, compare releases from other groups with the same translators but different editors. You will see none of the cancer memes that's prevalent in Comeme subs.</br></br></br></br></br>  not watching dubbed<br>whats wrong with you</br>  <br><br>Just turn off the subs or go to the alternate sub track that they probably provided.</br></br>  <br><br> "B-b-but they did that one anime without any fooling around so that makes them good" <br><br>Absolute trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br> FFF said they are going to do Noragami OADs <br> Noragami S2 is going to air next season <br>FFF still hasn't released the OADs.</br></br></br>  <br> in a timely manner? <br><br>That's the problem here, with shows where you would really need a fansubber they tend to drop the ball.</br></br></br>  <br> vivid <br>Two shows a season, usually popular stuff with lots of alternatives. And when they proved to be the only real choice for a show (like Amaburi) they fucked up majorly.<br><br>I generally like Vivid but they don't sub enough to be relevant to the scene at large.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? <br>They went and joined ISIS</br></br>  <br><br>It still says a lot about their mentality and what kind of people they are that they would think that it would be a funny thing to include.</br></br>  <br>I just want a subgroup that takes HS subs and puts it with a decent video encode. Commie used to be good at that before they went full meme</br>   yfw herkz is in this thread RIGHT NOW   <br>Also, my Japanese is so-so, I normally only do doujin/manga translation. I don't dabble in fansubbing because I'm not very good at translating by ear.</br>  <br>Gasp.</br>  <br>You don't need to need japanese to edit an english script, what the fuck are you talking about?<br><br>Just try to compare a song translated by commie with a litteral translation, you'll a lot of thing unrelated to the song in it just for the sake of the flow  or the memes .</br></br></br>  <br>why hasn't someone done an automated rip of the subs from HS and mux it onto a raw</br>  <br>Do you even know what an editor does? Hint: They don't translate.</br>  <br>I don't see why they wouldn't be relevant when they've almost always provided the best release for the shows they do.<br><br> they fucked up majorly <br>I'm gonna regret asking, but how so?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eat shit, this is the best comedy anime<br>Certainly better than that Gintama trash<br> No one's going to fansub it <br>But subs for the first two episodes have been released</br></br></br></br>  <br> OCR for funi's subs is not 100% accurate <br> HS' rips still manage to look better than every public raw <br> need to find .ts <br><br>Why or how would you plan to do that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why make claims of TL accuracy?</br>  <br> Both shows have been picked up by Funi <br>Looks like I'm going to be watching Dandelion raw.</br></br>  <br><br>I've seen shows where CR was the TL and herkz did the rest. Sure the lyrics had liberalizations, but they were way too close to the original meanings to be made-up bullshit. Commie has always sucked for song lyrics, Yahari's OP was especially bad and had nothing to do with herkz.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying attention and donations are not the currency of fansub drama queens </br></br>  <br>Obviously he's not gonna do it because he's lazy scum.</br>  <br>You're free to not donate them and ignore them.</br>  <br><br>Do you really think all they do is sit back and insert memes? They still need to know Japanese to make sure the English meme is an appropriate fit for the Japanese meme.</br></br>  <br>Because I'm not deaf and I can tell when something is mistranslated in the subs. My ability is such that I would have to listen carefully to translate the whole thing without mistakes, I can't just listen casually and then translate instantly, I would have to listen, consider, and then carefully phrase my translation. I would be slow as shit at translating anime. But I could do it.</br>  So, question, why are we talking about fansubbers again? If you hate them so much why do you guys keep giving them attention? They all are lurking in this thread and laughing at us on IRC. Is this really what you guys want?  <br> Nirvana and Geico "references" <br><br>This shit is worse than memes, actually.</br></br></br>  If CR did something Steam-like and let you download anime from their system and watch without the filtering of their web player, would you get a CR membership?  <br>I'm not seeing any discussion of this thread in any of the staff chans I'm in.</br>  <br>Because it's easier to bitch about subs than learn moon.</br>  <br>It's what I want. These threads are gold.</br>  <br> HS' rips still manage to look better than every public raw <br> need to find .ts <br>That's why you spliced in a public raw and put onto the FUNi subs, deband it, inverse upscale it and then encode.<br><br> Also can one register a new account paypal with 0 cash in it, just for the sake of CR free trial? I wanna rip some show and CR give one month of trial because of Japan Expo. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger this happens every couple of months. Just roll with it.</br></br>  <br><br>It's what you get for watching Yahari, the definition of a meme anime.</br></br>  <br>Because they only do 2 shows. Out of like 50 shows going on at any given time. And those shows often have other subs available. So they don't provide a large amount of translation, they don't provide speedy translation, and they don't provide exclusive translation, the only thing they have to offer is superior quality.<br><br> I'm gonna regret asking, but how so? <br>They started fucking up in the episode where they wore the Kanye suit. They wrote themselves into a corner regarding honorifics and verbal tics and went fulll Commie defending their choices.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be honest here, I was always interested in fansubbing but I don't have the time nor the attention span necessary so I can't help but being interested in the guys who sub my shows.<br><br>The problem is that I ended up hating them after a while and they all are big jerks, or should I say big herkz? Hehe.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>But by doing this you keep feeding Daiz, herkz, Xythar and whoever ego. Why do you like giving attention whores attention?</br></br></br>  <br> It's not that I was particularly looking forward to either one <br>Your action state the opposite anon<br>Quite desperate</br></br></br>  <br><br>Daiz, at the very least, has done a good job so far and deserves the praise.</br></br>  <br> laughing at us on IRC <br><br>Yeah I'm really hurt that people who do something for free (i.e. no monetary compensation) are laughing at me for shitting on their meme cartel</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz.</br>  <br>Daiz has gone on record saying he doesn't care about fansubbing and only does it because legal options are inferior to the service he can provide for free. <br><br>That's why he takes any legit job he can get in the industry, even if it's working for Fakku.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with xythar? He seems pretty chill.</br>  <br>Then why are you giving them a good time?</br>  <br>Memesubber from the memecartel.</br>  <br>Because I'm having a good time shitting on them.</br>  <br>Because the resulting drama is tanoshii. You know how some people like watching soap operas? This is my equivalent of that.</br>  <br>But they are like little kids, the more you shit on them the more they'll memesub, you're not helping any cause and keep giving them the attention they are craving for. It's like responding to a tripfag.</br>  <br>You're an idiot. You need to grab shows like Gangsta and Arslan to keep the normalfags subscribed.<br><br>Your AOT pleb won't see NNB repeat or Monster Musume and go "I WANNA SEE THAT". They see those and go "creepy japanese bullshit xD"<br><br>From a business model they fucked up. The audience that brings in the money won't want those shows and the audience who would be watching them are downloading HS and Commie rips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My point still stands. Stay mad herkz</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> I happen to be an expert in the dankest of maymays </br>  who else uses kissanime subs here?  <br>I do, they are usually fast to put their shit up and I'm free of memesubbers.</br>  <br><br>That's right, I know Japanese and have studied Japanese memes. My power over memes is twice the power of yours.</br></br>  <br>SJW</br>  When you say Fansubing is dead, do you take into account memesubs such as Commie? because those are alive and well.  <br>Feels good to live for memes.</br>  <br> kissanime subs <br> kissanime <br> subs <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  I'm tempted to try and do Joukamachi, but I'm going to wait until episode 2 to see if Funi do actually do it.  <br>Is he a real SJW or "he has a reasonable opinion on a spectrum of issues and I'm mad because he said something opposite to my opinion" SJW?</br>  <br>Are you going to Bane sub it?</br>  Who is the head honcho of commie?  <br>The latter</br>  <br> because those are alive and well <br><br>I'm glad.</br></br></br>  <br>herkz</br>  What would you say is the download split between CR/Funi rips and fansubs is these days? 80/20?  <br>SJWs aren't known for reasonable opinions, anon.<br>That being said xythar is a lot of things but unlike the other anon I doubt he's an SJW.</br></br>  <br>No but I type in a very English way so it might set some people off. <br><br>If I do end up giving it an attempt I'll just post the sub file on /a/ and just time it to ohys raws.</br></br></br>  <br>95/5</br>  Is Doremi the best fansub group now? Timely releases, decent translations, no overly fancy bullshit, still alive, etc.  <br>Give me Bane memes bruv.</br>  <br>I'm poking fun because anons especially on /v/ and /pol/(and hell, people on /a/ do it too) like to call everyone that disagrees with them an SJW.</br>  <br>If you're an idiot, yes</br>  <br> and just time it to ohys raws <br><br>Cool, the video quality I needed.</br></br></br>  <br> ohys raw <br>I don't like this meme</br></br>  OP here. I didn't realize this would turn into one of these UN Summit on the State of Fansubbing and the Meme Cartel threads that we seem to have to collectively shit out every month or so. I just wanted to know if some shows would get subs or not. I suppose the drama is rather entertaining though. <br><br>For the people ITT who actually work for a subgroup, do you guys actually see companys like CR and Funi attempting to recruit fansub group members for paying gigs with them? Do you know people who have taken jobs with one of those companies, or with some other one like maybe Netflix, or a manga localization operation like Fakku or Viz Media or whatever?<br><br>Do they get paid well? Do they telecommute or actually have to move somewhere? Just curious really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So... You have no idea what it is, then?</br>  I'm surprised CR didn't get anything this season<br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/lineup</br>  <br><br>Or leopard raws, I haven't downloaded that one to check. It's not going to look decent anyway.</br></br>  <br>90/10.</br>  <br>CR is filled with ex fansubbers.</br>  <br><br>It's well-known that CR and Funi hire fansubbers. Obvious choice really, between doing it for money and doing it for free anyone would do it for money.</br></br>  <br>Yes I do, it seems like you're getting overly defensive now though.<br><br>To explain again, there are two types of "SJW" in this world. The crazy fucks that are actually SJW or the "They have a reasonable opinion but I'm calling them SJW because they disagree with me and I'm mad" SJW.<br><br>But anyway, it's a useless buzzword now so what the fuck ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>no wonder they are the best subs</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sure, I mean fansubbing is the obvious talent pool from which they would want to hire, I'm more curious how much they get paid and whether they work from home or have to move and go in to an office or whatever. Like do they make a decent living?<br><br>My moon isn't quite good enough to translate anime by ear yet, but I've done a little work on manga scanlations here and there. It's fun, and I would be at least somewhat interested in doing it for money some day given the opportunity, if it were actually worthwhile.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt they make much money, but anything is better than being a NEET. Working for them also kills your passion, imagine being forced to translate Glasslip.</br></br>  <br>I care about fansubbing as long as it gives me something that legal options don't. It's never been deeper than that, though - I don't believe in bullshit like "fansub magic" which makes fansub releases always better than legit ones no matter what.<br><br>And I wouldn't take any legit job in the industry, it'd have to be a position where I can actually do something that matters in terms of digital distribution. FAKKU provides that.</br></br></br>  <br>The master memesubber is here.</br>  <br> bringing up FAKKU when it isn't even part of the discussion <br>The jew strikes again.</br></br>  <br> imagine being forced to translate Glasslip. <br><br>THE HORROR<br><br>Yeah, probably better to just keep improving my nip abilities for my own pleasure on my own time and maybe working on a manga here and there as a hobby. I guess there's probably no way a CR translator makes as much money as most average normal professional type (college required) jobs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CR pays peanuts for their translators (who are basically all remote contractors) - you can actually make a better hourly wage as a timer there (provided you're fast enough). Other companies may pay more, but I can't say for sure for most of them. Generally speaking you can expect the pay to be pretty low though, AV translators tend to have it pretty rough from what I've gathered in general.</br>  <br> If it doesn't get HorriblySubbed then nobody subs it. <br>Tragic</br></br>  <br>Read the post I was replying to, genius.</br>  <br><br>To be fair, he's done a great job.</br></br>  -1  <br>Here comes the bald faggot.<br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>hi daiz</br>  <br>Nobody summoned you. Leave.</br>  Man, everyone hates on Daiz so hard. He's kind of a faggot but he's not so bad. Underwater were the only ones to sub Sidonia. Even if there was a meme here and there, I'm thankful for that.  Why doesn't /a/ just make their own group?  <br> What do you think most of the fansub groups are? </br>  <br>Because it'd be filled with memes.</br>  <br> implying /a/ has the knowledge or motivation to fansub <br>It's way easier to just bitch about existing sub groups than to try making a new one</br></br>  <br> implying /a/ has the knowledge or motivation to fansub <br>But it seems that, out of every board, /a/ is the one that produces the most content, I'm sure a few people here could get together and make a group that only subs shows that aren't getting subbed.</br></br>  <br>Again, </br>  <br/>  <br> Why doesn't /a/ just make their own group? <br> Imagines the thousands of people bitching about how shitty their subs will be. </br></br>  <br> times badly <br> get paid more than translators </br></br>  <br>People from many sub groups are from here.<br><br>Making an "official" /a/ sub-group isn't a good idea. It would either propably die fairly quickly like most of /g/'s projects or result in useless drama before dying.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't believe in bullshit like "fansub magic" which makes fansub releases always better than legit ones no matter what. <br>It's not really magic. If you can get something of roughly the same quality for free for very little effort, why wouldn't you take the free option? Until legit subs provide a substantive advantage over fansubs, fansubs won't go away, and I don't that will happen as free is hard to beat.</br></br>  <br>That's why CR also has AOT and Funimation has HyperNep and Shinometa. Because they only cater to normies. Good job.</br>  where's my karaoke  <br>This is all I want from my subs.<br>And nice typesetting. Not that barebones white block arial shit CR puts out.</br></br>  <br>Could be worse, could be yellow subs.</br>  <br>True. Those are much worse.</br>  <br>You still get them sometimes.</br>  <br>I still don't understand why it's "a rule" that Funimation and CR have to use either white, yellow or green subs. Everyone, even the late Geneon, had to follow this rule.</br>  <br>The first aqua lion episode hasn't been subbed either</br>  <br> 2015 <br> still relying on subs and not learning japanese </br></br>  Just do it yourselves you lazy fucks.  <br>Nah, SJWs stick out like a sore thumb because they are offended by everything, especially disagreement.</br>   commie is fine   <br>I watched my first raw yesterday (DB Super).

There was a thread on it a while ago  </br>    <br>Nah, he made it pretty clear to her even after she confessed her love for him as a man that he only sees her as his cute sister but that he would never abandon her or leave her side. He said he'd try to see her as more than his sister but makes no guarantee. In his head, no matter how much they've been altered genetically so that even their kids won't have defects, he says the fact that we are brother and sister from the same parents doesn't change. He can't reconcile this fact and he isn't capable of romantic love thus far.</br>  <br>Yet he doesn't because he only sees her as a sister. He can really fuck any girl he wants really with as many that like him in the series. Mayumi practically offered herself in a hotel room to him, he just undressed her quickly and left.</br>  <br>Why is he holding a silly toy gun.</br>  <br>not be a faggot gary stu</br>  <br>He can't post translations on BT</br>  <br>He teases him about it for sure:<br><br>The wheel fell out at the same time. The barrels fell and guns displaced. Armorplate peeled of all at once. These all happened in the same time at the 4 tanks.<br><br>Fuel leaked from the engines.<br><br>It ascended to the sky and vaporized prior to ignition, as it mixed and diffused tothe atmosphere.<br><br>“Good work”<br><br>“It doesn’t make me happy tobe complemented by you”<br><br>Towards Masaki’s cold attitude, Tatsuya smirked wickedly.<br><br>“Should I ask Miyuki to complement you?”<br><br>“Do-don’t joke around! It’s not the time for that!”<br><br>Masaki was upset about an interesting thing.<br><br>“At any rate, let’s go! Zhou Gongjin is escaping.... It’s him!”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Tatsuya extended his ‘eye’ towards the direction of Masaki’s sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is that psychopass... just kidding  <br>That's because he knows that he already belongs to the Miyuki.</br>  <br>Not in the way she wants. Tatsuya isn't her doormat, he clearly runs the show and Maya knows it.</br>  <br> Adopted grandson.  </br>  <br>Wait he undressed her? So he got her down to her underwear or nude and just said "no thanks" and left her there thinking they were going to bang?</br>  <br><br> Not in the way she wants. <br>He hasn't realized that yet. It's only a matter of time.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, got her down to her underwear and roughly threw her in bed then left. The next day she complained that he undressed her too roughly.</br>  <br>That's how hard she lost, huh? Not even surprised. That explains why Mayumifags are so mad.</br>  <br>If he hasn't realized it in 16 volumes, he isn't going to realize it any more than he has. He's got limited emotions and he already said he'd be by her side and never abandon her. As far as he's concerned, he's complying with her wishes and doing what he wants at the same time. He's happy seeing her as his cute little sister, he doesn't need anything else. And she's fine as long as he never abandons her or thinks she'd abnormal. Really, their relationship hasn't changed one bit since the beginning. Read the translations for volume 16, despite their engagement, they have remained the same. It's others who are perceiving it differently. <br><br>What I don't get is why Maya announced him as her son to the TMC. Isn't her ex going to know that's a load of bullshit?</br></br></br>  Cut inside  <br>Wow Tatsuya is a gives no fucks dick and Mayumi is absolutely pathetic</br>  President ends up with him right? Not that Jumanji scum  <br>Jumanji is based as fuck</br>  <br>"I can't hold my liquor much, but I'm the type who remembers everything" <br><br>Tatsuya wanted to flee that place in that very moment. Unfortunately for him, he understood that he couldn't do that in such situation as a man . <br><br>"…though I feel that you don't have to be that rough" <br><br>Certainly, he did shove Mayumi to the bed roughly. However, could he be blamed because of that? He questioned himself when he recalled. Yet, to say 'you're the one who want to strip to your underwear' be a king cobra grade boomerang. <br><br>Mayumi was still looking at Tatsuya shyly. <br><br>In this very awkward atmosphere, it was a mental hard work to send Mayumi back to the nearest station to go home, while Tatsuya waited at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We aren't sure who ends up with who at this point, though wouldn't surprise me if her father makes her engagement to Juumonji official next volume.</br>  He can't stop being a fag long enough to fuck his sister that's for sure  How can such an old man make such a great LN?  <br>Ok so she was coming on to him while wasted and wanted to ride his baloney pony and he didn't want to take advantage of a drunk chick who wasn't his immuto</br>  <br>He's a 58 year old chuuni. Some just never grow up.</br>  <br> tfw his new editor made him drop the public transport system of the future </br>  <br>I don't think he would have slept with her even if she was sober. And he doesn't want to fuck his sister either. He was in Kyoto on a specific mission, he has no time for silly grills and their whims.</br>  <br>Not a chance, it's still going strong as of the latest volume. Public transport end is one we can safely say will happen.</br>  <br>He got a new editor?</br>  <br>that's what i heard from 2ch</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Updated to reflect the loss then.</br>  <br>I think his old editor was the Oreimo one so we have no clue about this new one.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was the man who helped our lord and savior with the Oreo. Pretty much confirms to me that Miyuki won't be winning.</br>  <br>Mahouka will turn into a wholesome family values LN about what it means to be a true patriot.</br>   Kirito smacks tats a little <br> He straight up breaks the game code <br>Calm down nigga</br></br>  <br>Is that what happens in the crossover?</br>  <br>Yeah, Tatsuya was pretty upset he lost and wanted a rematch with the Blackswordsman.</br>  <br>Doushio~</br>  <br>What did Tatsuya think would happen? He can't beat somebody in a video game, he's a total scrub, that's one of his only weaknesses.</br>  <br>Don't forget Kirito's VR reflexes are the best in the world save for Aids-chan. Kirito can reflect whatever magic bullshit Oniisama can throw his way right back at him, at speeds that would make Accelerator and the Flash jealous.</br>  <br>I guess Tatsuya really doesn't like to lose either. He admits right before that he sucks at fighting with weapons.</br>  <br>Transform into a magical girl</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>Magical Lyrical Moon Prism BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL ACTIVATE and make it double!<br>Now you can't get it out of your head.</br></br></br>  <br>Be an actually interesting and likeable character</br>  he cannot beat demonbane  <br>Onii-sama is the greatest.<br>He is made out of pure thoughts and righteous anger.<br><br>Now lets listen to some quality music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sEb<wbr>4yh1tObM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>In all fairness Mayumi was rather rude this entire volume and acting like everyone owed her something to help her out, I don't recall her thanking Miyuki or Ichijou for their help in the Nakura investigation. She was being too forward and pushy with Tatsuya and that clearly didn't sit well with him.</br>  <br>I have seen the light. Sasuga Onii-sama.</br>  Is the scene where Tatsuya admires Jumanji body the funniest scene?  <br>Will she shit bricks when she learns that he's Yotsuba?</br>  <br> translations for volume 16 <br>NANI?!?!</br></br>  <br>You're late, translations for both 15 &amp; 16 are available albeit not edited and checked.</br>  <br>Will her father shit bricks when he learns that Maya has a "son" when she was supposedly infertile after his sorry ass couldn't protect her in Dahan? <br><br>I think that Mikihiko, Honoka, and some others at 1st high will be the mist shocked. Erika already guessed they are Yotsuba, Masaki pretty much figured as much even though Tatsuya denied it, and Mayumi already thought he was a Yotsuba "extra" so probably not as surprised. The big surprise seems to be their engagement.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuya commenting on other guys is always hilarious, but nothing beats that Juumonji scene, even the manga kept it.</br>  Here is the Google Doc for volume 16 for those interested.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9<wbr>Ij40wbH06gR2dBT3dmTFRVT2M/view</wbr></br></br>  <br>http://www.docdroid.net/file/downlo<wbr>ad/15irx/15.pdf<br><br>Unedited 15, there's a part that is missing near the end, I'll repost that part here.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>chapter 9 part 2 mahouka v15<br><br> Tatsuya headed to a hotel, smaller than CR hotel where First High students stayed, but inconspicuous. It was a hotel that was frequently used by Kuroba-ka for work purposes.<br> “Good afternoon, Tatsuya-niisan”<br> “Tatsuya-san, we have expecting you”<br> Fumiya and Ayako was waiting for him in the lobby.<br> “I’m sorry for asking you to come all the way here”<br> “No, the case was originally brought to us after all”<br> <br> “We can’t keep talking while standing up like this, Tatsuya-san, why don’t you sit?”<br> Ayako welcomed Tatsuya to the sofa. After Tatsuya was seated, Ayako sat at the opposite end of the table, while Fumiya brought in some drinks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was wondering if it was allowed to eat or drink here, before he noticed a 3H wiping another table. No, it was a business type ‘Humanoid Servant’, it was similar to the type found in the aircraft which was called “Servanoid”. Since Tatsuya determined that it was not a problem, he received the drink without refrain.<br> Ayako expanded sound barrier. There was no warning against unauthorized use of magic. Seemed like this hotel was not only at the level of Kuroba-ka’s work, like what he had been told, but also completely modified for the work of Kuroba--- no, Yotsuba.<br> “This will do, and. Tatsuya-san, here are the things that you’ve requested”<br> “The bike is the same model with the one that Tatsuya-san has been using. It is parked in the parking lot”<br> “The clothing is stab-proffed and also bulletproof, do you want to change into it?”<br> “Boots, gloves, and helmet, all of the combat requirements are fulfilled”<br> “how gracious….”<br> They put much more effort than he expected, Tatsuya was about to laugh. Of course, he didn’t actually laugh, since he knew what the 2 of them think about him seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you. I’ll use them well”<br> Hearing this response, Fumiya and Ayako showed a really happy smile.<br> “Then, we will guide you to your room”<br> Ayako put down her tea cup and rose. Fumiya stood and left the drink at the table, hence Tatsuya followed him.<br> The change clothes that were prepared was really fit into Tatsuya’s body that it felt creepy. Tatsuya wanted to ask, where did they get his measurement from, but in the end he decided that it’s best not to ask, so it stopped him from asking.<br> “How far have you narrowed it down to?”<br> Tatsuya asked about the hiding place of Zhou Gongjin.<br> Hayama had been sharing the information that he got on Monday to Kuroba-ka. Based on that information, Kurobas had been investigating around the hideouts of Zhou Gongjin this week.<br> “We are almost certain of this”<br> “I see, as expected of Kuroba. Then?”<br> At Tatsuya’s question, Fumiya showed a slight hesitation.<br> “That, it’s hard to believe, but….”<br> <br> “JSDF, Uji second supply base. There is almost no other place to shelter him in this area”<br> In place of Fumiya who couldn’t speak about this so lightly, Ayako answered him.<br> Tatsuya failed to say, ‘no way’.<br> “I see. It is indeed quite a hideouts”<br> After he wore an antiglare, Tatsuya move to take the communication console.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>* “Thank you. I’ll use them well”</br>  <br>Sweet. Been looking for that for a while.</br>  <br> “Fumiya”<br> “Yes-”<br> After being called with a hard appalling voice, Fumiya answered with a louder than necessary voice.<br> This voice was evidently showing that Tatsuya’s feeling had reached a critical level. Since Tatsuya was not able to have high level of strong emotions, the moment it reached a certain stage, he would show it as an non-emotional intention on the surface.<br> The treachery of national defense force, was way over his tolerable limit. Since the rebels was attacking Miyuki in Okinawa, he was especially intolerate against betrayer.<br> There was a phrase called ‘nukeba tamachiru mizu no ha. It was a representation to say that Japanese sword would shine coldly eerie when it was sharpened. Tatsuya who lost his feelings in anger, was reminiscenting on this phrase.<br> “Is it possible to do external communication?”<br> “Please wait for a second”<br> Fumiya outstretched his hand beside Tatsuya, and keyed in the security code in the keyboard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a doc or something so I can insert missing text?</br>  <br> Tatsuya was prompted by Fumiya, sat down in front of the console.<br> Tatsuya entered the complex code. He waited for about 5 seconds before a female officer appeared on the monitor.<br> “Tatsuya-kun, what’s wrong, suddenly?<br> Tatsuya entered the code for emergency calls that are assigned to Fujibayashi’s own line.<br> “Lieutenant, I’m in Kyoto now”<br> “I see…”<br> With only those words, Fujibayashi seemed to understand him.<br> “Did you find out?”<br> She intentionally omitting words in her question, Fujibayashi sighed in the midst of resignation.<br> “I have an idea of Zhou Gongjin’s hideouts”<br> Tatsuya did not share the information from the traditionalists at Kiyomizu Temple and Mt. Arashi to Hayama only, he also shared them to Fujibayashi. It was a serious crime for this country’s army to assist Zhou Gongjin who led the foreign troops in this land. Tatsuya could not afford to avert his eyes even if he’s asked to. Tatsuya was going to use that.<br> “Where is it?”<br> Fujibayashi showed a painful expression in response to Tatsuya’s straightforward question.<br> “The military police is scheduled to be dispatched. Special lieutenant Oogura must not intervere.”<br> “This is not subjected to the military rule of secrecy. Fujibayashi-san, where is Zhou Gongjin? You’re part of Kudou-ka who promised for cooperation, please answer me”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “… he’s inside the JSDF, Uji second supply base. Tatsuya-kun, leave the rest to the Armed Forces. Even if it is you, you won’t be left unexcused if you trespass on the base”<br> “I understood. See you”<br> “Tatsuya-kun!?”<br> Without clearly saying what he ‘understood’, Tatsuya cut off the communication. Additionally, he locked the line via the console.<br> He looked back, behind hime Fumiya and Ayako had seen his exchange with Fujibayashi with rounded eyes.<br> “Support is cut off. How about the plan?”<br> “Start at sunset, and we get into the base”<br> Fumiya who just regained his sense answered Tatsuya.<br> “How about the intrusion path?”<br> “We’ll enter proudly from multiple gate. It is not a big problem to overcome such a plain fence.”<br> “of course, we have to have someone to standby by the gate”<br> “We don’t have the number”<br> Tatsuya stood up while glaring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The background for that card makes it seem so. The other wedding cards cards have clean background like this one.</br>  <br> “Fumiya, Ayako, I will get someone to help us. I might not be able to enter the base on time, but I will do so if the time allows me to”<br> “understood. Tatsuya-niisan, the communication device will not be connected at that time”<br> “Tatsuya-san, becareful”<br> “Fumiya and Ayako, you too, don’t let your guard down”<br> “Yes”<br> “Of course”<br> After hearing their repies, Tatsuya proceeded to the bike that had been parked at the park lot.<br> He immediately recognized the bike. However, he rode the bike in the different direction than what was shown by the arrow.<br> The west sky had started to color red. Not much time until the start of the operation. Tatsuya called Masaki while riding the bike, he used the radio interface from information terminal that was charged in the helmet.<br> “Shiba? Do you have something?”<br> For masaki, a phone call from Tatsuya seemed to be a surprised. On the other hand, Tatsuya might show a similar reaction if he receive a phone call from Masaki. Since he knew that himself, Tatsuya did not say anything unnecessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh damn, I haven't been reading since like v12. Are the volumes before this translated too?</br>  <br> “Ichijou, I narrowed down Zhou Gongjin’s hiding place”<br> “Really!?”<br> “Yes, where are you now?”<br> “Nearby Kamigamo Shrine”<br> As Tatsuya thought, he came. Third High usually come in the day of the thesis competition itself, not a day before. However, Masaki should have come earlier for preliminary inspection when he considered last week’s situation.<br> “Let’s meet up at the southwest entrance of Uji Park at 1700”<br> “1700? Understood. I will be there”<br> Masaki probably thought that there was no more time. However he understood immediately the meaning of the specified time. Despite the unfriendliness of their communication, he still immediately took action.<br> He would be a formidable adversary, but a reliable ally. He understood well that Masaki was a good man, that was why Tatsuya preferred to contact him.<br> (I should hurry up myself)<br> It would be awkward if Masaki managed to get there on time while he’s late. Tatsuya increased the speed of the bike.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's it from the part that was missing from the docdroid file.</br>  <br>Everything is now translated except the side stories.</br>  Don't mind me, just oniisama TL leader here. Shamelessly shilling for new members.  <br>You're reading too much into these cards. There's also a Miyuki and Masaki card that isn't just a Masaki card so take it however you want. There's also also a Lina one card and a Masaki alone card.</br>  <br>Is there a google doc for them?</br>  <br>For the side stories? No.</br>  <br>No the main volumes</br>  <br>Who all is working on the translations? Aren't there 2 people doing 16? <br><br>I'd be happy to apply to edit and fill in translations where needed as long as it's not through that fb group.</br></br></br>  <br>There is but it's not edited and anons here posted the cleanest versions available.</br>  <br>That's fine. just an email will do, or you can contact me on jcafe forums. I am Mknr_Rec and you can find me in the novel shoppu thread.

The day the second semester for the year <br>2096 ends.<br><br> Merry Christmas! <br><br> February 25 <br><br>You might want to check the raws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what is this crossover?<br>a manga or what?</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 16 does some crazy shit with the plot. there's a reason the community exploded on its release.</br>  <br>where can I read more about it, mate?<br>or you mean here? if that's the case I guess I can check the archive.<br>But I need an answer to the whole Miyuki not sister thing before I start checking the archive and get tired before finding a preper answer to my questions.</br></br></br>  <br>You can read V16 like anon posted here </br>  <br>There's this one. Don't have screenshots of the Lina one right now.</br>  <br>Can Shiki kill him?</br>  <br><br>If you're fine with spoilers then I'll just explain.<br><br>Miyuki is a genetically modified magician like Minami. Unlike Minami however, she had the divine luck of not having any genetic defects whatsoever despite heavy alterations. Though Miyuki's base material are the same as Tatsuya's, they have been changed to a point that they are genetically strangers.<br><br>Basically, they're siblings, but science has made them blood strangers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a work in progress. Though prior threads have translated the important explanation pages, they are not part of the Google Doc yet.</br>  <br>To summarize, she is his sister, same mother Miya and father Tatsurou. However, Miyuki was a test tube baby unlike Tatsuya and she was genetically modified to have a magic meant to be his limiter. Their aunt Maya says that she's a perfect masterpiece unlike Kudou's Minoru. Also that due to the extensive genetic alterations done to Miyuki, her and Tatsuya genetically are more like cousins so their children wouldn't have any defects. Of course, this is all coming from Maya so you can either believe her or not, some people are still questioning her motives because it seems too perfect, too soon. Time will tell.</br>  Tatsuya can do 2 things destroy all matter and rebuild all matter.  <br>can he kill himself?</br>  Why did this woman arouse Tatsuya-kun? She is just a horny bitch that is deceiving Tsugu-aniue.  <br>Unless the matter is already dead or has run out of psions. Or it happened more than 24 hours ago. There are limitations to his Regrowth.</br>  <br>Erika go and stay go, you ginger bimbo.</br>  <br>She reminds me of Maki the actress. She's supposed to be so beautiful but actually looked like shit. Somehow Mari turned him on yet a Mayumi in her underwear didn't. Miyuki and Minoru are both supposed to be otherwordly beautiful but they look about average. Erika is supposed to be less beautiful than Minoru. In conclusion, Satou has horrible shit taste or the illustrator isn't paying proper attention to the story.</br>  <br>You know, Tatsuya may just like tomboys.</br>  <br>Oh I read the summary on wikia<br>Firstly Tatsuya duels Kirito but when he is about to lose he uses his power to destroy the game world<br>In their second encounter he uses his incredible math ability to get out of their predicement.<br><br>In other words Kirito is a better player than Tatsuya, being on the upper level, while Tatsuya is a hack.<br>I think Kirito = Shirou and Tatsuya = a serious Gil, fighting in UBW sounds like a good simulation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hmm interesting But still it doesn't make it okay morally though.<br>Thanks based anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Gil(Tatsuya) is fated to lose in UBW(game world) but uses EA/Decompose to get the fuck out of it.</br>  <br>I think he likes mature girls and Mari is a more serious and responsible girl compared with Mayumi or any of the 1st year girls. Suzune too but she's almost too serious like Katsuto.</br>  <br>Miyuki is the most beautiful of the lot.</br>  <br>Masaki pls.</br>  <br>Are you saying she is not? Then should I wait for this blonde bimbo that Tatsuya told me is as beautiful as his sister?</br>  <br>Yeah there were 2 cards for the last week of the wedding event. The Masaki one with Miyuki already posted and a Miyuki one with Masaki, didn't bother to save them but if I come across it again I'll post it. The Lina and the rest are in the archives from the first week of the event.</br>  The imouto is always the best girl.  <br>Tatsuya is overall more powerful but Kirito is more skillful.<br>Kirito can beat him unless Tatsuya activates his God mode where he can destroy anything and everything.<br>Also give Tats enough time and he can catch up to Kirito's level easily as well.</br></br></br>  <br>See, even Tatsuya can appreciate that other beautiful girls exist.</br>  <br>He likes girls with toned bodies. Reminder that Mari is one of the only female with enough grip strength to stop him. He might have been aroused by Mayumi but it was not described, he still lost his shit and ran like a puppy, when Tatsuya gets aroused it disappears in an instant.</br>  <br>There is only one Masaki and Miyuki card, the other ones are Masaki and Lina.</br>  <br>Touma literally has a jobber aura built into his powerset. You cannot beat him as long as you are living your life one bit incorrectly.</br>  <br>Miyuki looks plain, many girls are prettier and hotter.</br>  <br><br>Tatsuya often finds himself admiring Miyuki and admits to himself in V16 that thinking of Miyuki that way is like dancing on Maya's palm.<br><br>Also the reason why Tatsuya was aroused by Mari is because of her perfume, if you her magic you should know that she manipulates the mental state with mixes of pheromones and scents.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirito wins by merit of his game stats and the Incarnate System. Tatsuya is actually the better fighter, but Kirito is much faster.</br>   Upon seeing that he had been unable to keep up with the elimination of his magic sequence, Tatsuya set his decomposition to target the dynamic structures causing the fluctuation in air density. <br> The interference potential trying to create areas of high air density and the interference potential trying to prevent high air density both struggled for supremacy. <br> As a result, Katsushige’s magic ended up misfiring. <br> “Wha—!?” <br> An astonished voice escaped Kanata’s throat. <br>The difference between Katsushige and the Tsutsumi siblings was that he did not end up backing down just because the magic he was good at had been blocked.<br> Katsushige, now completely a part of the battle, cast his next magic to attack Tatsuya. <br>However, the localized, violent updraft that suddenly arose prevented Katsushige from further attacking.<br> The violent gust that arose against Katsushige’s center of mass was the result of a magic that was invoked in the skies above him. <br> The wind being gusted up in a vortex right above Katsushige was being cooled by a sharp decrease in pressure as it condensed the moisture within it into fine particles. <br>The decrease in pressure was due to nitrogen, of which nearly 80% of air is made, simultaneously liquefying in large volumes.<br>It was Miyuki’s “Niflheim” at a high altitude where Katsushige’s interference potential could not reach.<br><br>Why is Miyuki such a shit, she cockblocks even interesting fights.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dance on, Big T. Dance on.</br>  <br>Admiring her because she's beautiful, not because he's interested. He was aroused by Mari, plain and simple, it's not because of a perfume, it's not even written that she was using it.</br>  So she goes around campus wearing that perfume. I wonder how many students happily accepted being taken to 'detention' by her.  <br>This is a drug and that's when she is fighting.</br>  <br> Kirito is similar to a cheater faggot <br>color me surprised.<br>well still it wouldn't be a fight if you don't give Kirito something to depend on.<br>Kirito is a good player but Onii-sama is like a super-genius God.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't.</br>  <br>Tatsuya states that only after he caught a wiff of her perfume did he notice such a change. Odds are that she wears pheromone perfume to snare men to do her bidding. Erika is wary of her for a reason.</br>  <br><br>“There’s no need to worry about genetic abnormalities of our future children either”<br>“Why, is that so?”<br><br>Miyuki who was facing down in a gloomy face, rose her face ang fixed her eyes at Tatsuya. The white skin above her neck was not covered by the hitoe had made Tatsuya involuntarily wanted to look away. However, thinking so would mean that he was walking in Maya’s palm, so he regained the calmness in his mind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And well SAO is more popular than Mahouka and you can't make Kirito look bad, right.</br>  <br>This is bullshit. Erika is a jealous brocon, that's all, Mari is not a bitch who would use pheromones on her body to ensnare men. Tatsuya got aroused by womanly smell, it happens IRL , she was not using a perfume.</br>  <br> womanly smell <br>Yeah about that, have you ever popped a boner from smelling roses anon?</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with wanting to look away from your sister when she is clothed like that, it's not the first time it happens anyway and he reacted the same to other girls in a similar situation. He doesn't see her as a woman.</br>  <br> Thinks smell of a woman and roses are the same <br>I had forgotten I was on /a/.</br></br>  <br>No there are 2 cards from the 2nd week. The Lina solo and Masaki solo (with George) are from the 1st week.</br>  <br>Dude, it's her perfume he smelled, not her sweaty, musky cunt.</br>  <br>Lina solo and Masaki solo have them placed in the same room with the same furniture.</br>  <br>In the same SAO Crossover Tatsuya pretty much sees Miyuki naked and plops her on the bed after she passes out. When she tells him my body belongs to onii-sama he's like what in the world is she thinking, and leaves. He's not aroused by Miyuki, he can objectively think she's beautiful without any sexual stimulus. It's just like complementing someone.</br>  <br>Just seeing a naked body won't do it for Tatsuya, his other thoughts were overwhelmed by the danger to Miyuki's safety. In a given situation he will become extremely ill at ease and flustered.</br>  <br>It's not said that she was wearing perfume and you don't need to smell a woman's cunt to be aroused by smell. Morevoer, it's not only the smell but the combination of all this which aroused him.<br> With her head partially lowered with a pair of upturned, almond-shaped eyes, and in addition to that, a faint, sweet scent drifting toward him, Tatsuya became conscious of his own sexual excitement. <br>Basically, Mari is a semen demon.</br></br></br>  <br>With Tatsuya's hand in the picture of Lina's. The ones with Miyuki are in the same setting too with the sofa so it doesn't mean much. It's just a card game. I don't expect the LN will end with any pairings to be honest or a wedding, just an open end.</br>  <br>There was no danger, she passed out in the sauna and she was waking up in her room, safe and sound. You're really desperate to find Tatsuya being aroused by Miyuki when in truth he never sees her like that.</br>  <br>She had a heat stroke and there was an immediate need to have her cooled down. When he sees her later in his room he's more relieved that he's okay and befuddled that she's accusing him of something. As far as I can tell that was the one and only time Miyuki yelled at Tatsuya.</br>  <br>He can't lose.</br>  <br>Everyone has a smell, it's not uncommon to find your girlfriend's scent as arousing or like to sleep on their pillow because it smells like them.</br>  I read chapter 16 and it said miya was the one who made tatsuya to destroy the word for her sister? Was the translator on shrooms or some shit? <br><br>Had no idea that head was married a lowly guardian. The fuck is he thinking with all those semen demons available.</br></br>  <br>He was confused by her vast misunderstanding of the situation. She thought he took advantage of her and then said but I don't mind, take advantage of me any time, my body belongs to you. Tatsuya was like what in the world is this sister or mine thinking, silly girl. The idea never crossed his mind and he left before she could embarass herself any further.</br>  <br><br> Traditional Chuuni with a lifetime's experience for maximum stu <br><br>Pretty much</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did a bunch of people bail on you or something?</br></br>  <br>You mean Miya? Miya was rather frail and not in the best shape to have children, the clan found an easily manipulated man with a large psion pool that they could pay off and dispatch as soon as he fullfilled his duty. Miya was supposed to be the single one, not Maya but the Dahan incident changed things around.</br>  <br>He can't bypass accelerator's barrier.</br>  <br>Nah, just two TLs who have started school again. But not to worry, it's not an awful lot that remains to be TLd. We need editors and TLCs to finalize the project, we don't have any dedicated TLCs at all to be honest.</br>  <br>wtf, is this a doujin? The art looks like trash</br>  <br>Tatsurou was not easily manipulated at all, he was given no choice yet still kept his old crush as a mistress, alsp he may be a distant relative of the Yotsuba. More on that, it appears that descendants of the founding families Shiba and Shinonome were reintroduced into the family in the latest generation.</br>  <br><br>I meant this part<br><br> However, that was not Miya-san’s true feeling. Yet, we were not aware of that until the month of her delivery, less than a year later. <br> Miya-san’s real wish was to retaliate the world. The thing she wished for was for an owner of a power which could overturn the world. To destroy the world which hurt Maya-san, and the world which hurt Miya-san. <br><br><br>Actually now that I think about it the spoiler was that Maya wanted big t to blow up the world which is true. But it was Miya who wished for him to be that destructive correct?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maya says that the wish for a world destroyer was hers, but it was Miya's mental interference magic that made it possible. From the looks of it, Miya didn't want this to happen, but her sister's thoughts won out in the end, which is a large part why Maya considers Tatsuya her son.</br>  <br><br>How do you feel about that other guy posting his partial volume 16 translation. Did it perhaps, fluster you?</br></br>  <br>Not like they really cared about him having a mistress. From what I can tell, having a mistress is pretty common for the numbered families considering all the arranged marriages. It was hinted that Koichi's 2nd wife, Mayumi's mother, may have been his mistress too before she became his wife and Mayumi. That might explain the distance between Mayumi and her brothers. The only happy, intact families we know of are the Kitayamas and Ichijous.</br>  <br>Are you sure? I don't remember seeing those. This page http://lostzero.gamerch.com/ has the cards listed for each event and gaccha. At least it doesn't look like it's missing any, only the most recent gachhas.</br>  <br> Decomposes the barrier. <br>Accel's barrier is not multilayered.</br></br>  <br>No, I'm fine. We had expected something like this to happen, we knew that the FB group was gathering funds to pay for a translator. We still intend to finish our version, if the fates allow it.</br>  <br><br>Oh so people actually paid for it. Explains a lot. Do you see your group breaking up after this volume? <br><br>Well tbh I honestly expected you guys to dismantle early on but I'm impressed you got not one but 2 volumes nearly done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Accels barrier isn't something you can decompose though.</br>  <br>Gram Dispersion.<br>Why would his barrier be impossible to decompose?</br></br>  <br>Tatsuya decomposes concepts backing the world, actually the only thing he does.</br>  <br>And there are plenty of magics with vector shit and stuff. Mahouka magic is reality warping, Tatsuya even said that Masaki's Bias Release had no vectors originally. A good systematic magician would crush Accel. Vector reversing barriers are common stuff there.</br>  <br>Thanks for all your work. I hope you will continue for 17.</br>  <br>All members have contributed and without their efforts none of this would be possible, but the main TL has been an absolute champion of the group. She is the one called Y in the progress docs. I can't tell for sure what will happen. We do keep in touch and even the members who have gone back to college say that they will continue working with us when they can, albeit due to a busy schedule it'll be very slowly.<br>We had no plans for V17 in the first place, initially it was only V16, but on the insistence of several members we picked up V15 as well and played with the idea of doing the SS as well.</br></br>  Don't you guys get bored of this LN?  <br>Shoot actual bullets from his gun.</br>  <br>Actually for things like mental/magical constructs he's more likely to use dissolution. Dispersion is used to dismantle magic sequences mid-cast.</br>  <br><br>So you guys did it  for free? </br></br>  <br><br><br>Actually Maya was the one manipulating Miya MCA by using twin resonance to create Tatsuya - destroyer of worlds, more than destroying the world she also wishes someone powerful enough to make everyone in the planet miserable as she wishes full retribution, Tatsuya is also able to do it, last novel clearly states that Tatsuya is able to make the entire world his enemy and win against the whole lot of armies on it alone .</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, absolutely.</br>  <br>Gram Dispersion is Decompostion magic anon. The other is Gram Demolition.</br>  <br>She was not. Maya is just retarded.</br>  <br>That's decomposition for magic, Tatsuya decomposition is tailor made for targets he wish to decompose the magic sequence used to decompose cars is different from the one used to decompose human body and so with magic sequences.</br>  <br>Maya actually said it but her story also matches with Mitsugu story</br>  <br><br>I know about gram dispersion. However for things without a magic sequence Tatsuya uses dissolution to scatter the magical powers of the object. He uses dissolution to destroy shikigami spies among other things. It is such that Miyuki who specialises in spirit magic will instantly notice it if he uses dissolution.</br></br>   Read volume 16 to see ayako's crying section <br> That's exactly where the TL stopped <br><br>MOTHERFUCKER</br></br></br>  Pound the Mayumi pussy.  Miyuki is a goddess  <br> dissolution to scatter the magical powers of the object <br>Actually Tatsuya uses several different means to destroy magic scattering magic power is jus one of them destroying directly the concepts building the magic sequence is much more efficient but more showy, with gram disperssion he is able to create an wide area negating all magic by instantly decomposing any magic sequence before event change happens.</br></br>  <br>we are talking about onii-sama here<br>he is such an OP character that only someone like Gil or Arctype Earth could defeat him.</br></br>   some people seriously think Miyuki won't get the oniisamadick   <br><br>Fuck I hope ayako has a chance this shit is killing me inside miyuki is pig disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Maya is also insane and I'm inclined to question her version of the story until further confirmation. I don't even think Tatsuya bought it, I'm sure he'll be finding out more later or looking into it further.</br>  <br>Miyuki won't be getting anyone's dick. I find it funnier that people think the author is going to have any semblance of a romantic resolution in the story.</br>    <br>They fail to realize how eager Tatsuya is to make her happy. When he says that he can only see her as a sister for the moment, that's him worrying for her, not trying to escape responsibility.</br>  <br><br>This. Omniisama isn't getting in a relationship with anybody because that would make it slightly less acceptable for other females to fawn over him.</br></br>  <br>I don't recall it ever being his obligation to have fuck her either. Fuck =/ protect which is what he said he'd do, as well as never abandon her, in whatever way that may be considering his eye is on her even when they were in different cities.</br>  <br>Oh you can expect Miyuki to start marking her territory and driving off orbiter hoes in the coming volumes. Not that she'll need to since Tatsuya only has eyes for her, but she's going to shoot down cock thirsty females left and right. Starting with the Saegusas.</br>  <br>If the author plans on milking the series and perhaps making a sequel about their college years or adult life then there isn't going to be any major pairing ending for either Tatsuya or Miyuki. You can make more money dragging it out.</br>  <br><br>Well that shit went public so I doubt she will have to. IIRC, people were avoiding them back at school. Mayumi is probably disgusted. <br><br>Only thirsty motherfucker left is masaki who will try to petition the marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Truly grateful for the effort you guys put into this. I honestly thought I would be waiting for 2019 to read it and that the fandom would slowly die off.</br></br>  <br>Mayumi sank her own ship in Kyoto via her own immaturity. Honoka and Lina still remain contenders. Tatsuya only seeing her as a sister remains a huge issue that you seem to ignore as if it's nothing. Tatsuya isn't someone that can just cast aside his own morals just like that.</br>  <br>Mayumi is distraught and I think the school is more concerned with them both being Yotsuba top dogs, specially Tatsuya who is publicly recognised as the son of magic Satan.<br>The teachers suspected that he was hiding his powers previously, now they have their confirmation and depending on how much more Maya is intending to let the public know they'll come to fear Tatsuya a lot more than they fear Maya.</br></br>  <br>You forgot that Lina is also coming back in V17 and it was already foreshadowed by Miyuki that she would be a great ally to Tatsuya.</br>  I feel like /a/ would have enjoyed this a lot more if they watched it as a comedy like some of us did.  <br>You mean Masaki's father because Masaki is too shy to get involved in drama without getting dragged into it.</br>  <br>Mayumi is still in the race, Kyoto was actually a step in the right direction for her. Had Tatsuya paid attention to her he'd be Tatsuya Saegusa now and not Tatsuya Yotsuba. Honoka seems to be going down the lesbian consolation route and Lina is getting shipped off with Masaki as Miyuki's replacement.</br>  <br>Masaki is such a beta faggot.</br>  <br>I think it's a combination of both them being engaged siblings and Yotsuba.</br>  <br>Them being siblings is probably the part they have the least issues with. After all they never acted like siblings and they have been publicly announced as cousins</br>  Would Touma be able to defeat Onii-sama  <br>He's not very good with people or being social but he's pretty good at fighting and killing people. I'll give him credit for being competent in battle and figuring out Zhou's MI magic. He worked well with Tatsuya and Tatsuya clearly thinks enough of his skills to trust him.</br>  <br>Ugh no, they were already slightly disgusted by their behaviors previously but it was more accepting because it was always denied and played off as a joke. Now the joke has become reality and they will be disgusted.</br>  <br>No, Tatsuya would break his neck and that would be the end of it.</br>  <br><br>He is but he's a good guy. I just hate masakifags really. Either way Tatsuya doesn't want to fuck his sister and masaki is probably Onii-sama approved.</br></br>  <br>I hate all xfags. I'm just in it for the public transport.</br>  <br><br>really? you wouldn't be pleased from seeing one pairing happen?</br></br>  O N I I - S A M A<br>N<br>I<br>I <br>-<br>S <br>A <br>M<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Masaki will die in the battlefield like a true magic CoD fag.  <br>People were in disbelief of them being siblings before. If they're taking distance now it's because they're big and scary Yotsuba main house members. The girls will fear Tatsuya because of Miyuki and the guys won't even try to compete for Miyuki because she only has eyes for Tatsuya who neither of them can come even close to.<br>Why do people not expect Miyuki to start setting up barriers now that Tatsuya is legally hers'? Before she would only send out occasional bursts of cold air, now she's going to send a fucking blizzard at you if you make eyes at Tatsuya.</br></br>  <br>They are all pretty one-sided and sort of happen for dumb or coerced reasoning instead of development. But I suppose if I had to pick one, I hope George gets to marry his loli.</br>  <br><br> maya just helped enable this behavior further <br><br>why<br><br>ON another note I wonder what maya would have done if tatsuya truly refused</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyuki is a lady and she wouldn't act like psycho bitch or else Tatsuya would frown on it. You guys act like she's impolite to people.</br>  <br>He can't, that's why she had this plan cooked up in the first place. Tatsuya has no concept of happiness aside from Miyuki. He will do anything to make Miyuki happy as long as it does not end up hurting her.<br><br>Miyuki is actually quite the bully.</br></br></br>  <br>The only bully in the story is Erika and Maya.</br>  <br>Yeh now they look super edgy from normalfag point of view.</br>  <br>Miyuki is not a lady Maya rightfully says it in front of Tatsuya and hes the only one to deny, lats volume showing how much Miyuki is mentally ill.</br>  <br>How the fuck is Mayumi still in the race? What in the world can she do that she hasn't already tried? I think that asking a guy to dinner and then your hotel room and reminding them that they had promised to dig in before is about as much as she could have done. She's pulled out all the cards. She accepted defeat when she told him she'd forget about that night.</br>  <br>Maya never says that, stop making things up. Tatsuya is the one to call Maya insane.</br>  <br>Next vol is about magic clans battling about one drop of Tatsuya semen, last attempt to get Tatsuya will happen by political coercion.</br>  <br>Mizuki and Mikihiko are pretty normalfag. As is Shizuku and the rest of 1st high. Shizuku already warned Honoka about it.</br>  <br>How do you know</br>  <br>She is very much in the race when she makes Miyuki think that something did happen that night and then runs off with a huge grin on her face.<br><br>No what he said is true, Maya said that Miya raised Miyuki to be a perfect lady and to not pay Tatsuya any attention so that she would not one day unintentionally fire her MI magic at him in jealousy. She says that in that regard Miyuki is a failure, but perhaps there was no such thing as a perfect lady in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Suck ya dick.</br></br>  <br> Still thinking Mayumi can pull a clutch <br><br>/a/ pls<br>Mayumi is done.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there anything he can't do? <br>use those silly serrations to cock the non-existent slide on his not-gun?</br></br>  <br>The Saegusa didn't object to anything, the rest of the clans seem more focused on undermining the Yotsuba power than worrying with Tatsuya. Ichijou father just seems concerned about marrying off his son. Mayumi already has two fiance candidates. Frankly she can't even wear the proper attire for hiking in the woods, I'll be surprised if she has any candidates left. People act like Mayumi's genes are the shit or something when nobody wants, Tatsuya didn't even give a fuck about being her bodyguard he dragged along someone else to worry about her ass. That's how much of a fuck he gives about Mayumi. He clearly states he only helped her because Nakura led to Zhou.</br>  <br>What are your predictions on ayako? Is she cooked?</br>  <br>Ayako has a purpose, what exactly I'm not sure but everything in this story has some kind of hint and purpose so her noticing Maya's intentions is going to play a part. So then I guess no, she's not done.</br>  <br>If either Honoka or Mayumi tried to jump on Tatsuya's dick I don't think he'd be able to hold them off.<br>Actually I sort of want Honoka to be Tatsuya's first, just so she can later die and take Tatsuya's virginity with her to the grave.</br></br>  <br>Vol. 17 is a decisive vol. For all Tatsuya x XXX.<br><br>So either they accept they can't win against Miyuki or Tatsuya has someone he likes or someone Tatsuya really cares about dies making Tatsuya promise never to love someone(Erika or anyone of his friends). It's pretty much decided.</br></br></br>  <br>What I mean is that Miyuki has never behaved unladylike because she knews Tatsuya likes maturity and girls to act like ladies. So she isn't going to throw a public hissyfit because that isn't going to jive well with Tatsuya. She acts how she acts to please him. Tatsuya doesn't act like a dick for the hell of it. <br><br>If Mayumi confesses, she's going to get the same answer as Honoka.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck with that. Mr. Emotionless Robot for 16 volumes is suddenly going to love someone? Yeah not happening.</br>  <br>Well Miyuki's ladylike personality is shit bcuz Erika showed up.</br>  <br>Dude can't take a "what if" scenario?</br>  <br>Mayumi is a troll and I appreciate her efforts to at least rustle Miyuki's feathers but she has a few problems to deal with. Number one being her own father and the fact that she went behind his back to avenge her bodyguard.</br>  <br>Actually she does and Tatsuya reflexively denies it, he is clearly being emotional there unlike he is 99% of time.<br>"..Miyuki is a lady she only loses her control because the [Vow](sealing magic)", but leaking her feelings so easily is the real source of problem, I like Miyuki but she is far from lady she is little girl, Ayako by contrast is at least 10 times more refined and lady-like than her .</br></br>  <br>Not sure you can put Erika and "lady" in the same sentence. Erika is a total bro though.</br>  <br>be the MC of a nonshit show</br>  <br> The Saegusa didn't object to anything <br>Yet, the first and fastest to object was Ichijou Gouki probable to save face from his son, who lost in miserable way.</br></br>  <br>Lol bruh. Erika is a "lady" even though she doesn't show it her harem gets boner every now and then. Tatsuya(Satroll) likes to comment on this kind of scene often comparing Miyuki and Erika.</br>  <br>Well she is just more laidylike than Erika but you know Erika acts like a man most of time</br>  <br>Fuck his sister. He has yet to prove me wrong.</br>  <br> miyuki threatening to freeze the entire student assembly to death because some hapless soul happened to say that Mayumi was gunning for him <br> miyuki going full what the fuck did you say about my oniisama in vol 1 when Hattori tried to belittle him <br> Miyuki giving Shippou the deathglare in vol 12 when he called Tatsuya a weed <br> Miyuki bullying Honoka when Pixie blurted out her intentions to Tatsuya <br> "ladylike" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't really lose when you never did much to begin with, at least Honoka and Mayumi tried something. Masaki is moreso helped by everyone else around him, which begs into question that is he even that motivated. His father is just being a typical TMC parent finding someone to marry their kid off. There aren't that many choices for him. The Saegusa are traitors who conspired with Zhou and the Kudou did the same and also worked with Sakai, the guy they already didn't like. The Yotsuba while sinister and questionable at least aren't traitors. So I suppose I can understand his wanting to form some alliance via marriage. The Juumonji and Itsuwa have boys and we don't really know of anyone else that's a female TMC magician.</br>  <br>She is more like a little kid and the author seems to be purposely portraying her as such, as she battles with her 12 years old alter ego herself and loses the argumentation.</br>  <br>That's actually pretty brilliant anon, never saw it until you so eloquently reminded me of her monologue to her mirror self.</br>  <br>Nah, more like Tatsuya would humiliate him, add him to his list of fawning groupies, and then use his incredibly convenient anti-magic powers to break the Yotsuba clan's hold over him.</br>  <br>The Yotsuba don't have a hold on him any more, it's Miyuki that does because if she ever dies so does everyone else.</br>  <br>I understand that Tatsuya has nerfed emotions and can't love anyone else, byt why the hell can't Miyuki. Is she stuck in 1st grade and all the other boys have the cooties? It's pretty illogical considering she didn't even like Tatsuya until later in life. There's no damn good reason for me as a reader to give a fuck that hurr durr can't imagine anyone but Tatsuya. That's pretty contrived and stupid. Arranged marriages happen, not like Mayumi wants to marry the gorilla but she isn't acting like a big drama queen about it. No, seriously why should I give a crap about what Miyuki wants or doesn't want in the zero. The author has given her zero personality and development outside of being a worshipping doll plot device.</br>  <br>Tatsuya is more or less unlike to think objectively about Miyuki and Myuki loses the ability to think while she is near Tatsuya, sometimes it feels like she reverts to her 12 years old self while she is near Tatsuya, sometimes she does intentionally as clearly stated in early novels, maybe she wishes to roleplay the little sister forever.</br>  <br>Tatsuya can tell that she's immature and needs to grow up though, he can make determinations about her that aren't biased. He acts in her best interest. Miyuki is an eternal child who is going to have to grow up. Not sure who to blame here for how she turned out, the Yotsuba, her father or to an extent Tatsuya himself.</br>  <br>Sometimes it gives me the impression that Miyuki is just fitting in as Tatsuya treats her like 6 years old kid, previous volume made it even clearer</br>  <br> Next time we're alone, lets fuck <br> is alone with her <br> doesn't fuck <br>onii-sama is a faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayumi needs a better man, see </br>  <br><br>look at the camera and urge the viewers to apologize for Japanese war crimes.</br></br>  <br>No one got this reference. I am sad now.</br>  <br>Lel</br>  when is the next volume out  <br>Next month I think</br>  <br>August 8.</br>  <br><br><br>Very nice. Probably the most anticipated chapter right?</br></br></br>  <br>It's game of clans + Lina, I'd say so.</br>  <br>Cover page should be out on today or tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well I thought everyone was waiting for the reactions from tatsuya being a Yotsuba since the blooms gave him a hard time</br></br>  <br>Sort of past that at this point, people sort of suspected already. The Bloom Weed thing stopped being relevant after the first couple of volumes.</br>  As far as I can see /a/ agree this was a really good episode, which is a good thing.<br><br> Nice animation <br> Nice designs <br> Following the LN (at least for now)  <br><br>Now what are the studio going to do, rush the entire LN like retards or do a good adaptation with 3 volumes in 12 episodes? or maybe 24 episodes with the actual 5 volumes?<br><br> Use spoilers, /a/tards cry too loud </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  LN summaries where? i cant force myself to deal with the shitty writing the translation provides  It's one cour.   Unique setting <br> Good designs <br> Not harem <br> Not ecchi <br> Decent direction <br><br>This is the fantasy I've been waiting for.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now what are the studio going to do, rush the entire LN like retards or do a good adaptation with 3 volumes in 12 episodes? <br>Well, their last work was Rail Wars.</br></br>   Nice designs <br><br>it's chunni as fuck, the most unoriginal design ever</br></br>  <br> chunni <br><br>Try harder.</br></br></br>  <br>Only Fremy looks chuuny.The others look like from a normal fantasy.</br>   PA Works last summer <br>Glasslip<br> this summer <br>Charlotte<br><br> Passione last summer <br>Rail Wars!<br> this summer <br>Rokka<br><br>Both studios went from making last summer's absolute shit to the best shows this time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> charlotte <br> best anything </br></br>  <br>Rail Faps was terrible but seems like the studio knows that and finally get something good as Rokka.</br>  <br> or do a good adaptation with 3 volumes in 12 episodes? <br>2 volumes you mean.</br></br>  <br>Is not like Charlotte is good, is the same as Inou Battle just even more edgy.</br>  <br>That's not going to happen, is a LN adaptation in the end.</br>  Mora is my waifu.  <br>But she is taken.</br>  <br>S&amp;W did that, I can hope.</br>  <br>And Mondaijitachi.</br>  Chamo is best girl.  <br>PA Works made  2014 AOTY  in between though.</br>  <br> AOTS you mean. </br>  <br>Itll most likely be 2 volumes with 6 episodes each. This is a good though though.</br>  <br>Useless house husband please go</br>  <br>Season 2 any day now.<br><br>Theres enough material for like 4 more seasons too.<br><br><br>Its very possible and by the pacing of the first episode, highly likely</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is actually very useful.</br>  <br>Oh? How so? His wife wears the pants, protects the family and everything else. Hes just her moral support if anything</br>  <br> Moral support <br> Helps her as a Saint of Mountains and sometimes is the one doing her job <br>How is he not useful?</br></br></br>  I was extremely sad when I learned of   Nashetania's betrayal. I had hoped she and Adlet would become sexy power lovers   <br>There's Fremy for that.</br>   MC is not some Buff powerlevel shonen Protag  <br> MC is a crafty/smart fighter <br>I am hoping he doesn't do major asspulls and I am gonna love this story</br></br>  Goldoff best boy.  <br>Considering what happens in vol 5 it would have not worked.<br> No chances </br></br>  I hope this gets rushed.  Just discovered who seventh is and i gotta say the whole plan kinda is an asspull.  <br> just even more edgy. <br>How so?</br></br>  <br>but   bunny is the most attractive by far, i wouldnt even be mad if a bunny good ending got asspulled  </br>  <br>In what way? All the hints were there all along and it all made sense.</br>  <br> Charlotte <br> the same as Inou Battle <br>Please don't compare a good looking and good dynamic show to that tensionless, bad looking piece of shit.<br><br> token loli <br> best anything </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fremy's design looks like shit, bunny all the way/  <br>Why?</br>  Adelt past is not as interesting as I thought. He was just a village boy with muh revenge complex. Boring.  <br> implying </br>  <br>Play the game.</br>  <br> Bunny  <br> Attractive <br> A cheap whore who sucks demon's dicks  <br><br>What's wrong with you anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too much Mexico, dropped.</br>  <br>its only the first episode, then they are in forests/mountains/wastelands.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  <br>He's doing the job Hachiman wishes he had. He also manages the Temple Head work when Mora's out</br>  <br> murrican detected <br><br>I bet you want shit full of fatties and hamburguers.</br></br></br>  <br>Cheap whores can still be visually appealing.  Probably. </br>  <br>not that I've read the LN, but my gut tells me you'll come to regret that.</br>  <br>Mora is top tier wife and mother.</br>  <br><br>Did you not watch Bahamut? <br><br>It was a surprisingly solid anime with good animation, good designs, a decent story, no ecchi, and a good direction. It also had a great ending that closed up all the loose threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she is both. how do you not find bunny sexy as fuck</br>  <br> As far as I can see /a/ agree this was a really good episode <br>Nope, it was generic LN pandering shit</br></br>  <br>What tier party member is she? That Guy or nakama?</br>  <br>Big spoiler ahead.  Daughter was taken hostage tier. </br>  <br>"That Guy" is Goldof.<br>The nakama is Hans.<br>Mora is the reliable mother character.</br></br></br>  I couldn't help dropping it because the MC really annoyed me<br> look at me I'm the strongest guy in the world I'll even show you <br> uses underhanded dirty tactics to beat them <br>what a cunt</br></br></br>  <br>Muh honor, muh fighting fair when the fate of humanity is in risk.</br>  <br>So, "I think we can all agree we regret ever meeting each other" tier?</br>  <br>Past halfway the story got pretty weak.</br>  <br> i will prove i am the strongest man in the world by beating you <br> i beat you therefore i am the strongest man in the world <br>whats the issue?</br></br></br>  <br>Monk healer tier.</br>  <br> Monk healer <br>TL note: Literally "Useless Slut"</br></br>  <br>Nice copy paste, now go back to your yahari thread.</br>  <br>Easily manipulated useless crybaby slut*</br>  <br>That'd be a paladin who for some reason multiclassed into monk and specialized in potion making despite there being a cleric in the party.</br>  <br>Shes more of a Monk Druid hybrid who also seems to have a bit of bowman abilities. Shes got farsight and can manipulate sound while in the mountains.</br>    <br>Notbad/10</br>  <br>Surely you meant read?</br>  <br>Accurate.</br>  <br>Needs more hips.</br>  <br>fujoshit right?<br> dropped </br></br>  <br>Heres your reply.<br><br>The only thing this has to do with fujoshi is the best girl's voice actress.</br></br></br>  <br> Being this retarded and newfag <br><br/></br></br>  <br>She's more of a monk with strength up self buff, cure, mountain birds eye view and mountain echos.<br>Chamo is mainly just summoner without the magic circle<br>Rolonia is whip warrior with heal as well</br></br></br>  <br>Chamo also can ingest anything. Literally anything.<br><br>Rolonia is also a berserker with the way she fights</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, forgot how she could swallow things up and it becomes part of her. Wonder where and how she got those first Jyumas from<br>As for Rolona, can you really call her a Berserker though? It's not like she's uncontrollable, just sprouts weird lines</br></br>  <br>She goes into a state of frenzy like flipping a switch anytime she has to fight. Otherwise shes a useless meek winy twat.</br>  <br>How much of a mystery element is there?</br>  <br>The whole setting</br>  <br>A lot, and that's why the LN is pretty good.</br>   I'm the strongest! <br> I'm the strongest! <br> I'm the strongest! <br><br>Holy shit kill me please. <br><br>Anyway, rabbit girl gave me a reason to continue watching. Let's hope the other characters won't be retarded autists like the I'm-the-strongest guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the first big twist in the tale.<br><br>There's only supposed to be six yuusha, but seven show up. Is someone faking it? Are they an enemy?</br></br></br>   http://cacatuasulphureacitrinocris<wbr>tata.tumblr.com/post/123249490266/k<wbr>onoha-hiden-chapter-eight-translato<wbr>rs-note-im</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br> http://cacatuasulphureacitrinocris<wbr>tata.tumblr.com/post/123265802236/k<wbr>onoha-hiden-epilogue-translators-no<wbr>te-i-was</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>And with these it looks like the Konoha Hiden has been fully translated. And it ended on such a friggin sweet fluffy way too.</br></br></br></br>  .<br>Hyuuga Hinata’s thoughts had wandered over to a place beyond the sky again.<br>Neji nii-san…<br>Glancing out the waiting room’s window, she could see the blue sky free of any clouds.<br>I’m getting married.<br>She whispered those words inside her heart, and turned to look at the young man standing next to her.<br>Looking at the intense look on his face, her heart started thudding despite herself. Even though she’d always been looking at him, just being with him like this made her pulse rate pick up like it had the very first day she’d met him.<br>Naruto’s unflinching eyes were looking at the Hokage Monument, the faces of previous Hokage carved into rock.<br>Or rather, to be more accurate, he was looking at the carved face of Namikaze Minato. His dad.<br>Just looking at him as he did that, Hinata felt so full of emotion, her chest could burst.<br>Ahh, she thought. Right now, this second…<br>Standing next to the person she loved like this made her feel unbearably happy. She was so happy, she couldn’t even hope to express it with words.<br>This moment is bliss. Hinata thought, simply, honestly.<br>As she did, maybe he noticed she was looking, because his eyes turned to meet hers.<br>Hinata’s face turned red. She ended up fidgeting a little.<br>He gave her an embarrassed grin too. The serious look on his face turned into another one, innocent like a young boy. She adored every single one of his facial expressions.<br>Her father Hiashi and little sister Hanabi entered the waiting room.<br>It was almost time.<br>Hinata took Naruto’s arm, and held on tight.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Uzumaki Naruto and Hyuuga Hinata.<br>Their wedding ceremony now begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon</br>   thumbs up on his own wedding photo <br> his house has a balcony with a view of the giant ass statue of his face <br>how fucking arrogant is this little shit</br></br>  <br>They really should make at least an OVA of this</br>  <br>more like 1 hour special episode</br>  <br>I still am in utter belief that fucking Naruto, one of the shittiest, managed to somehow redeem itself with its ending. I had so much anger and animosity towards it, but all I can feel is a bittersweet happiness at how it ended. God bless Kishimoto for having the best taste in ships.</br>  <br> they fucked that night </br>  fuck off  <br> Kurama watched the whole thing <br> Probably took over one of the Naruto's Clone and sandwiched her with Nardo </br></br>  <br>Is Pierot retarded enough not to do it?<br>The Konoha and Shikamaru Hidens are the only ones I've read, but they would make for some actually good material to make, instead of botched and sorely disappointing exam arcs.</br></br>  <br>iirc exam arc was they did back when shippuden was a thing but arc was scraped/unfinished so what they did is they continued the arc right before gai vs madara fight to gain time <br><br>also SP is huge NHfaggots and i bet they would make anime adaptations of at least 2 said books</br></br></br>  <br>My problem is that when you take something potentially interesting and useful for world/character building and make a half-assed mess of it not only are you producing some shitty filler, but wasting an opportunity for someone decent to do a good job of it later.<br><br>Skipping stage 3 in particular was truly stupid, almost as bad as promoting fucking everyone and even giving Neji a double promotion for kind of saving the Kazekage's life, but not promoting the MC for doing way more than that. It's fucking stupid.<br>At least stage 2 could have shown characters really grown and taking charge at the right points, but instead what we got was jobbing against joke characters and never really having a decent fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Naruto shopped Sasuke into this wedding photo later.</br>  <br>I don't think he knows how to computer much, he merely uses it to shitpost on ninja /a/.</br>  <br>newfag here, are these novels canon? were they made or supervised by kishimoto?</br>  <br>I think they are written by his assistants or something.</br>  <br>I dunno, but at least whoever write them seem to care more about the non Naruto and Sasuke characters more than Kishi does.</br>  <br>It supposed to be bridge between part 2 and 3</br>  <br>Is there actually going to be a part 3? Couldn't they at least wait 20 years like Dragon Ball did?</br>  <br>Gotta milk the dead cow while it still warm<br>And about dragonball theres still time to liquidify the bones and make milkshake</br></br>  <br>Nah. Only Sakura cuts herself and Sasuke into photos together.</br>  <br>Look at this smug cunt, marrying the man of her dreams and having a wonderful family.</br>  <br>He saved all sentient beings. He's entitled to some arrogance.</br>  <br>btw movie isnt released yet fujoshits already started to draw shit like this<br> tfw we probably get borumitsuki doujin before naruhina </br></br>  Do you guys like cute stuff?<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/vItnC</br></br>  <br>Where's that guy who always talks about lolinata and shotaruto?</br>  <br>right here<br>Naruhina a shit<br> ShotarutoLolinata the best <br>also Orochimaru, Madara and Shizune best waifu<br>gotta sleep</br></br></br></br></br>  I like the new ending.  <br>Pretty dick move not to invite Orochimaru and Kabuto</br>  What does everyone think Keith will have to say this month?  Please tell me Annie is unfrozen in the next chapter  He'll say:  no Eren, you ARE the Titans.   Ymir and Historia are the best shingekis in this terrible series.  <br>ur spoiler doesn't even work kiddo..psh</br>  What are the chances of any one of BRA surviving?  I love Annie.  <br>Zero, no one in this series is living to the end  since the world is obviously ending </br>  <br>Reiner would probably die.</br>  <br>No, MC and MC's girlfriend are best shingekis.</br>  <br>I always thought they might die a death where they redeem themself. Then again I think BRA working with humanity would be kind of boring.</br>  <br><br>Shipperfags are cancerous</br></br>  <br>Fuck off EHshitter.</br>  <br>So what would be a good fake spoiler?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>People usually only react to fujobait characters dying.</br>  <br>That one was a good one. Many Tumblrshits started killing themselves because of it.</br>  <br>I agree but it's not that bad.</br>  <br>Then the EMfags got mad because they recognized it from an EM doujin.</br>  Why was Tokiomi so shitty? Why did he follow the strategy Archer told Rin when they first met? Did he really think locking himself in the basement and being a total pussy towards Gilgamesh would make him win?  <br>Saber is Takeuchi's origin. She was there from the beginning</br>  <br>If Shirou's origin is sword, what is Shiki's?</br>  <br>How many people are in Shiki and Shirou's harems?</br>  <br>Rape</br>  <br>I'll eat a kilogram of my own poop if it's not murder</br>  So this is like SAO but with tanks?  <br> You mean she's fucking retarded and calls his dad because she's wrong in the head? <br>She got better, now she just calls him father because she got used to it.</br></br>  <br>No. It's like Apocalypse Now but with YAMATO DAMASHII instead of FREEDOM.</br>  <br>This is why I can't take all the people whining about the "nippon stronk" vibes seriously.</br>  Do they comment in the LN about how similar everything is to stuff in Earth's history?  <br><br>How the fuck is that possible to pull off?<br><br><br> my favorite anime is Evangelion <br>Huh, never thought of that. I'll keep that in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, the new BBCPEX having a Remix Heart story mode thing made me remember this thing actually existed. It is any good? Did Mai ever get his body back, or did they at least fix his taste buds?<br><br>If they didn't at least do that, they said the only thing he could eat before was Noel's cooking, and because of her doing everything in the games and not being able to tend to Mai, good to say Mai's a dead person.</br></br>  <br>Celica's gonna die in the next game, and while Ragna certainly reacts positively towards her, he's never shown anything beyond platonic affection towards her or literally anyone else. Not to mention, her image keeps overlapping with his foster mom. Because they're the same person.<br><br>As for Tsubaki and Jin, eh. It could really go either way. Because the thing with Tsubaki is really of tertiary importance to Jin's character. His primary conflicts are with Ragna and that whole Power of Order thing. They'll probably reconcile, but based on how these things usually tend to work out, their relationship will probably end up open-ended.<br><br>It'd be too abrupt and intrusive for Jin to have spent three whole games have absolutely zero interest in love or romance and suddenly hitting it off with Tsubaki in the fourth game. There's this thing called "literary pacing", you see. Jin is certainly affectionate towards Tsubaki, but having him suddenly open up to the POWER OF LOVE is just plain excessive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Mai needs Noel to eat, and I'd kill the father and call it 'tough love', the bastard did TRY TO KILL MAI WITH AN ASSASSIN.</br>  <br>Prioritizing saving those that can be saved makes sense. It's not as if Ragna doesn't care about Saya, but at this point it makes sense to try and save others first considering the situation.<br><br><br>I'm sure that they can come up with some excuse that will let Celica live. And while Ragna hasn't shown interest in romance, he has shown particular affection towards Celica, which could potentially develop to something more. <br><br> There's this thing called "literary pacing", you see. <br>Please don't patronize me. Jin does care pretty deeply about Tsubaki and this had already been demonstrated. His default attitude towards other people is loathing, but he did everything he could to save Tsubaki. Hell even Hakumen had shown that he cared about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And while Ragna hasn't shown interest in romance, he has shown particular affection towards Celica <br>You do know that her image overlaps with that of his foster mom, right? The very first time he meets her, he's all "Wait, I've seen this smile somewhere before". <br><br>Also, caring about someone and falling in love with them are two entirely separate things. Jin has shown absolutely no capacity for the latter in the entire first three games. Just because you care for someone does not mean that you're gonna marry them. That's just shippingfaggotry. <br><br>Someone like Jin, who's shown absolutely no capacity to fall in love with anyone so far, suddenly going "Yeah, this is the girl I wanna spend the rest of my life with" is way too abrupt. He cares for Tsubaki, but the current Jin lacks the capacity to go from "familial affection" to "romantic love" in just one game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And the age difference didn't stop Ky. <br>Not gonna lie, Ky and Dizzy is the only fighting game pairing I give a shit about.<br>I guess it is that feeling of Ky loving what once he hated the most, gears. Also, the age gap is great fuel as well.<br>Ky went from NO FUN ALLOWED Lawful Good Crusader, to husband of an outcast.</br></br></br></br>  I'm never letting this die  <br> &gt;movie original ending where Yukino wins right after the genuine speech </br>  <br>Tobe and Hayama are on a American football club and Cunt is ace quarterback</br>  WHERE IS THE NEW EPISODE OF YAHARI?  <br>So what now? This is the first time that`s happening to one of light novels that I`m reading. Do I have to purchase the novel from their website?</br>   <br> Yui is cut half way through the movie so regular people don't get confused </br>   Shame. she has the best design out of the CVs.  <br>Because Atago is in more doujins, therefore, is more recognizable.</br>  <br>Kagerou.</br>  <br>Someone seems to be missing in this pic? Isn't there another sister that occasionally shows up in a wheelchair or something?</br>  Akashi is olev  <br>Kiyo's pretty popular and is starring in some recent mango.</br></blockquote>]
