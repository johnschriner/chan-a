He's one girl only.<br>Also, Anna could be a major pervert and a cock slut, but it's OKUMA's cockslut. She wets for him because she's in love.</br></br>  <br><br>It's Tanukichi and Anna, together, informing Sofia, who expects that something is wrong, but hitherto was unaware of Tanukichi's relationship with Anna, that there's a problem. Anna informs her mother that, to her, Tanukichi is the most important thing in the world, and that she loves Tanukichi; this profession of love surprises Tanukichi, not because he is unhappy but it's the first time she's saying it, simultaneously informing both him and Sofia. <br><br>It doesn't say she's pregnant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If this pregnancy rumor is true, that's quite the change of mood for a lighthearted comedy. It's pretty doubtful in fact</br>  S O X  <br>I find it hilarious that no one on /a/ can read Japanese.</br>  <br>The pregnancy stuff was made up because 90%people in /a/ can't moon. The kanji used for pregnancy 妊娠 is nowhere seen in that text. <br>For what I can see, is just Anna telling her mother that she's in love with Tanukichi, that he's the most valuable thing for her. Shit is that Tanukichi can't aswer shit because she had Kajo (I think?) in his mind too.</br></br>  <br><br>Read it again<br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr>..</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. How did I miss that? But it doesn't say she's pregnant though, it says that pregnancy is considered garbage or stuff.</br>  <br>So do you just not know Japanese or what?</br>  <br><br>Collusion! fuck you guys!</br></br>  <br>Line please? can't fuckin see it</br>  <br>13th</br>  <br><br>Nevermind, I found it. It doesn't say she's pregnant, they are talking about pregnancy. It seems that anon got confused and got shimoneta fandom mad.<br><br>She's not pregnant. Okuma can't decide if he likes Kajo or Anna, Anna wets for him and turns to be more pervert than Okuma and Kajo together.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That isn't Anna saying she's pregant you dumbass. It's wonder if the reason for Anna's recent emotional instability is a result of her being pregnant. <br><br>It isn't. It's because she loves Tanukichi, and she hasn't been able to admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Be she does admit it at the very last, but Tanukichi is the one undecided.</br>  <br>And at the end<br> アンナ先輩、僕は――― <br>It seems that Tanukichi, like us, wants the Anna but at the same time wants to suck Kajo's dick</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why can't he fuck Anna while simultaneously taking Kajo's dick in the ass?</br></br>  <br>because even when he's a pervert, he's 1 girl only</br>  <br>Well I don't mind at all if he gets both. I'd love to see a menage a trois.</br>    <br>She likes him. So?</br>  it's pretty clear that he will end with Kajo <br> being this dense </br>  So Anna being pregnant was just a mistranslation and we went mad for nothing?  <br><br>Yes, they were saying if the reason she was emotionally unestable was because she was pregnant.<br> trusting in a <br>is your fault</br></br></br></br>   Still not Hiryuu   <br> secretly <br>too late</br></br>  You fags ruined it. Of course she is not pregnant, they did pregnancy test and it was negative. Also Ayame confessed to MC in front of Anna in vol 9, fuck you.  <br>See you next week!</br>  <br>whats his reaction? How did Anna take it? I can see Anna dont giving a fuck but he is spilling spaghetti everyone</br>  <br>Speculating you mean?<br><br>Yea I never fully trust /a/ but I thought that as a prank was too much elaborated and in the face to pull it off for such a not-so-popular anime, but as a dumbass I forgot Hanlon's Razor and didn't think about /a/ simply being dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you really thought this would last? Also, where I can find Vol 9? I wanna read that cuck</br>  <br>Read this </br>  <br> secretly </br>  <br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr></wbr> <br><br> With it has become emotionally unstable that it was allowed to pregnancy to the bottom of the obscene waste . <br>w-what</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isnt this Reverse Cuck? Doesnt Cuck require a white dude getting his GF banged in front of him?</br>  <br>I was correcting him by saying that the characters were actually speculating</br>  <br><br>Read the whole page, anon. Anna isn't pregnant.  even says it's a misunderstanding.<br><br>The reason Anna has been recently distraught is not because she's pregnant, but because she's soberly, but firmly, come to the realization that she loves Tanukichi.</br></br></br></br>  Anyway, with that business out of the way, he can get down to getting best girl pregnant instead.  <br>Tell us more of that confession, please.</br>  <br>I don't know, I bought them.<br><br/></br></br>  She's perfection.  <br>She isn't lewd because she doesn't know what lewd is.</br>  <br>Translate please. I'm about to Iku Iku! here<br> Anata no [unreadable kanji for me] ga daisukiyo! </br></br>  So this thread just proves that /a/ don't know how to read moon at all ?  <br>She also isnt pure by that reason. You can only be pure if you atleast know whats lewd is, choosing to be pure is what truly perfection. Anna and all these guys arent really pure, they just dont know any better.</br>  <br>She just discovered what lewd is at the very end of the episode.<br><br>And she doesn't even know what it is yet. It's her first time feeling it.</br></br></br>  S<br>O<br>X</br></br>  <br>S<br>O<br>S</br></br></br>  <br>wait, i barely understand moon but did just Takunichi likes her back? I can see a "Honto ni yokatta ne! sayonara! bye bye!"<br>She's relieved or something? Anna a cuck?</br></br>  <br>I can see Anna not giving a shit. " Oh you like him too? Well guess we are rivals now, k thx bye, i try raping him anyways."</br>  <br><br>it says <br><br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> haremshit <br>DROPPEEEEEEEED</br></br>  <br>And then she leaves right? Why she leaves after confessing to him?</br>  <br>This is also the point of the story if you want to find a social critique into it</br>   tfw no english translated LNs   <br><br> "Tonight's special is a big, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br><br> Orgy end <br> three people <br><br>You'll need more than that. We'll need Saotome, Goriki, and Fuwa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not the whole school </br>  <br> the anime will never get here <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Who a fairly basic love triangle makes it harem?</br>  <br>She is maximum overlewd?</br>  <br>Jesus fuck, this lewd Anna thing is really going places in these threads.<br><br>Will the anime actually go that far?</br></br></br>  <br>For sure she will try to rape Okuma in his apartment</br>  <br><br>Even the flies?</br></br>  <br>Harem requires at least three unique characters to have romantic feelings for the lead main character.</br>  <br>Was that the context of the next episode preview?</br>  Well, that's how this shit usually plays out, isn't it?  <br><br>Here's all of it if anyone wants it:<br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" <br> "... But for now, farewell, at least for a while." <br> Takunichi, flustered, asked himself what, what has she gone and said this time?  <br> "Kajō, who in;"  <br> Anna, to his side, screamed... Terminally and completely cutting through Takunichi's response. <br><br> I omitted the fact that Kajō' inserts "hooters" into her sentence, as it ruins the emotion of the scene. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br> implying there isn't another character that likes the MC </br></br>  Why don't nips just have sex  This wouldn't be half as boner inducing without the heart pupils. I don't even know what's it about them anymore, but the mere mention of it makes me hard in no time.  <br>It isn't even about heart pupils for me, it's just irregular eyes in general. Then again, eyes have always been my primary attraction feature ever since birth, so it's not surprising that variance in them makes me diamonds.</br>  <br>Especially the flies.</br>  <br><br>Scientist girl exists. not!Mirai exists. pic related exists</br></br>  <br>wait thats the police chick in the first episode.

It's actually the plot of the next episode, so the anime WILL make that far at least. Even the cookies, that happen the day after</br>  <br><br>It still uses Funi's shit tier scripts. Hiryuu is the best choice.</br></br>  <br>Two is enough.</br>  <br>Hiryuu is so late though, 4 days later than the other subs. EP3 isnt even out yet. They are fine for archive saving but if you want to watch the show with /a/ they are too slow</br>  <br>Incorrect, two is a love triangle. Different genre, different target audience.</br>  <br> pic related <br>I hope it's her. I love when shows break serious girls.</br></br>  <br> Secretly </br>  How did we get that far without mentioning the COOKIES?  <br> What if she is secretly the lewdest one of them all? <br>You just need to watch the Opening to figure it out</br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck. Is this where the series gets serious?</br></br>  <br>But if MC loves another person who doesn't love him and there are two other characters who love MC?</br>  <br>Refer to <br><br>"Rare exception: If the lead main character is romantically interested in them, they are automatically included by default, albeit with an asterisk."</br></br></br>  <br>I wondered if Anna likes sex a lot why her mom doesnt like sex or she is hiding something?</br>  <br>I'd ask why she has a daughter to begin with</br>  <br>The morality law was only implemented 16 years ago. It's only Okuma's generation that's completely ignorant.</br>  <br>Yes but she and her husband were the one that pushed for these laws. If she hates sex so much and considers it dirty, how does she have a daughter at all?</br>  I don't even watch this show, I'm here exclusively for the Mirai-like  <br>faggot</br>  <br>Maybe they noticed Anna's slutiness as an infant when she wouldn't stop touching herself and pushed the laws to protect her?</br>  <br>She probably won't even appear season. She came out in volume 8 of the LN. the last episode concluded volume 1 I think.</br>  <br> concluded volume 1 <br>not yet, probably one or two more episodes.</br></br>  <br>This could be an interesting plot about shit parenting</br>  <br>She is.</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br> Anna with a wig. She is in SOX mode </br>  <br>You can remove the collars?</br>  <br> the father is   Tanukichi<br/> <br>crisis adverted, then. I would be pissed if there was some  NTR busines  going on.</br></br>  <br>The hottest design<br><br> I was expecting her to join SOX at some point but I never figured out it was her in that pic, I would have expected standard panties on the face </br></br></br>  <br>Their society leaves little time for anything other than work.

Stop spreading false spoilers.</br>  <br>WHO DO I BELIEVE NOW</br>  <br><br>- Anna isn't pregnant<br>- Anna isn't a man<br>- Both Anna and Kajo confess their love<br>- The show is shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me. She's a new character, and her name is Annie Brown.</br>  <br>With that one, Anna and Kajo we're officially entering harem territory then?</br>  <br>ANOTHER CLONE ADDED TO MY LIST!</br>  <br>But Anna isn't pregnant</br>  <br> preggers <br>Proven false.</br></br>  <br><br>You've never seen the chart, have you?

Hopefully Okuma gets some of that Annas from Anna.  <br>well he's getting some of her love honey soon</br>  <br><br>huh, so Anna will prove to be truly sexually perverted, depraved even. While Kajou only likes dirty jokes and is open and the mc was raised on dirty jokes and pretty fucking open. ahh shit Anna is a no go. kajou best girl confirmed even plot wise it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Is this actually confirmed to be Anna?</br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  <br>The collar is different. so I don't think so</br>  <br>damn, the image has been around for days now and still no one has confirmed who she actually is. Shame. NewMirai best Mirai.</br>  <br>This is most certainly not the world The Boss envisioned</br>  <br> days <br>Try months. This shit is OLD.</br></br>  <br><br>I found out her name!<br><br>It's  Ranko Okuma </br></br></br></br>  Will she ever find the secrets of procreation?  <br>I've seen this image around for months now.<br>Didn't even know she was from this series until a week ago though.</br></br>  Please. I fucking bow my head down. Don't make this another main girl wins shit. Please, it's so damn cliche and the main girl is so fucking ugly, I never asked for this.  <br>She looks like she is pretty close.</br>  <br> Okuma? Is related to the MC ?</br>    Well tips to the guy who wrote it and i get what he's trying to say, the only problem he exaggurates the censorship in Japan way too much.<br>No one forces you to watch japanese porn anyway, you can watch chinese there's hardly any difference.</br>  <br>But Anna is pregnant<br><br>Were you not present in the last thread or not read the first few posts of this one?</br></br></br>  <br>Japan fucking hates China and would never masturbate to any porn they'd produce.<br><br>Not that they can, because porn is banned entirely in China anyway.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah Kajo's design is pretty shit. Every time I see her hair it triggers me because it looks like she's going bald. <br><br>Need MC get some of those Annas from Anna.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Japan hates Korea too<br><br>Doesn't stop them from frequently having their popstars on their TV shows nor stops kpop from topping nip music charts all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Post a trans faggot</br>  <br><br>I didn't even realize it's the same. I just saw a piece of fanart on pixiv of her and then looked it up to confirm. We won't know since she's a late character unless we get another cour or future season.</br></br>  <br> fanart  <br>POST IT</br></br>  <br>Ranko is Tanukichis's mother, it's not her on that cover.</br>  <br>What fucking garbage are you spreading<br><br>That person is clearly Anna</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51563549</wbr></br></br>  I wish Anna had gotten pregnant. That episode would have had the best threads of the year.  <br><br>That fanart is defo not based on Anna. New character confirmed.</br></br>  <br>It would have been one hell of a shift for a show like this to take.<br><br>I want to see that version too.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you serious<br><br>The original picture is Anna cosplaying as MIrai from KnK<br><br>It's not a new character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did someone do this with Anna?</br>  <br> 7 hours and 48 minutes ago <br>Still no Hiryuu.</br></br>  <br>Collar is different tho. And Anna doesn't wear glasses.</br>  <br> Anna doesn't wear glasses <br><br>What part of <br> cosplay <br><br>Don't you understand</br></br></br></br></br></br>  any links for the full ed?  <br>How do you explain the collar then.</br>  <br> casually not mentioning the fact that the collar is completely different to Anna's. </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I read in some other thread here that this new character's name is Annie Brown. Not sure if it was a troll tho</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tbh given that they have the cellphone in order to suppress the collars it's not impossible to be there a way to change collar for a disguise<br><br>still unlikely despite the uncanny resemblance with Mirai</br></br></br></br>  <br> Annie Brown <br>Yes, that's her name.</br></br>  <br>American?</br>  <br>I don't care who she is. ALL I WANT IS MOAR.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br><br> implying Yuzuki couldn't have decided to have drawn a different collar <br><br>The person looks exactly like Anna if she were to cosplay as Mirai, how do you explain that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sameface.</br>  NEAT  <br> lol you know what I feel like doing today? Drawing a different collar on Anna just becuase i feel like it. No one will care or anything. It'll be cool, what a great idea, I hope the loyal fans don't mind.  <br>No.</br></br>  <br> implying artists don't change things about their characters especially when they're making them do shit like cosplay <br><br>Are you retarded or something, just because you'll get your panties in a bunch because her collar changed doesn't mean Yuzuki gives a shit</br></br></br>  <br>The  wiki  lists Ranko Okuma as a different person.</br>  <br>ITT people who think the artist has to cater to their every whim and never do anything that they want to with their own characters</br>  <br>Sure thing, friendo.</br>  <br>also Nadeshiko Kajou is likely , making her Ayame's nee-chan</br>  <br>Hahahaha good one! XD</br>  <br> wikipedia <br> a site literally anyone can modify <br><br>i like how there's nothing written underneath either of those entries</br></br></br></br>  <br>I known there is a reference in this poolroom, I have seem this miltiple times, but honestly it went over my head,<br>Can someone explain it</br></br>  <br>b-but I don't wear panties, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Find all the JAV covers involving a swimming pool</br>  <br>Google jav pool</br>  <br><br>Kajou wanted Tanukichi to run away, while she delays Anna. She tells him that she will definitely find an opening and soon catch up with him. She puts a lotion all over herself, so for a while she has an upper hand in that fight. Anna tells her that it was a mistake to entrust Tanukichi to her and that she wants him back. She says that Ayame betrayed her not only once, but twice. She was Setsugen no Ao and she stole Anna's beloved. She thinks that Ayame is somehow deceiving Tanukichi. Ayame tells her that there is nothing to return. She thinks that, because unlike Anna, she didn't do anything ecchi with Tanukichi, she only gave him 10 yen chocolate on Valentine's Day and passed it as a joke. Then she decides to confess to him through PM call(that fragment).</br></br>  <br>I don't have any, I'm just reporting other claims.<br><br>On the other and Annie's name popped up the same time Anna's drama began.<br><br>Especially reporting a part in which Anna asked Okuma who was the most important person to him end he couldn't respond because he was undecided between Anna, Kajo and "Annie" and I was like "wtf who is this".<br><br>Then maybe it is all made up and some decide to peg the name on that picture for shit and giggles</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will the manga be translated  <br><br>Ohh, I get now, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>get it*</br>  you can find that pool even just by searching "that pool" on google  <br>Yeah Google seems to confirm people think she's called Annie brown.</br>  <br>So we have Anna in a fit of jealousy and Kajo beating each other?<br><br>I dig it</br></br></br>  Anna or Kajo?<br><br>Who would be a better wife?</br></br>  <br>Tanukichi should just give them both the D.</br>  <br>I'll take Anna.</br>  <br>Is she a political threat to Anna presidency?</br>  <br>Kajou for me</br>  <br>Slavs make better wives.</br>  <br>He for sure is going to give it to Anna.<br><br>Or more appropriately, she is going to take it from him by force.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing beats jav if we are talking about 3dpd</br>  <br>kajo</br>  <br>If I had a son with Ana do you think she would try to rape him? If so then Ana.</br>  <br>Anna.</br>  <br>But main girl is Ohoho this time. She's is literally as good as it gets as far as main girls go.</br>  This is literally the first show where I want the main girl to win.  <br><br><br>You are thinking too small. The orgy will encompass the entirety of Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>poll pls</br>  <br>Kajo<br><br>She has a great sense of humor. Everywhere we would go, we would be the life of the party.<br><br>She's also fairly blunt and to the point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She has some shit hair though.</br>  <br>I like both her hairstyles.</br>  <br>You have some shit hair.</br>  <br>Kajo</br>  <br>I know, it's the shit</br>  <br>both of her hairstyles are great, and she actually has a realistic hair color.</br>  <br>Anna would be a depraved slut until the day she is truly satisfied, and by then, she will have your child  oops <br><br>Kajo would be a fun little rocket, but would eventually mature and the jokes would stop. She'd say that they are for kids and that in her youth, she had wild dreams and had fun with it, but now it's time to grow up. <br><br>In terms of longevity, Anna would definitely make a husband happier. Kajo would be a great deal of entertainment, but would eventually just stop.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br><br>There are way too similar between this anime and MGS V.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GJV<wbr>xPAiB7as</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I first heard SOX, Metal Gear was the first thing I thought of.</br>  <br> WORDS THAT KILL </br>  OP sure is a slowpoke  So which release best release? Horriblesub is censored garbage  <br> censored <br>wait there is a group that releases an uncensored version? already?</br></br>  <br><br>Hiryuu and Clawhammer use the ATX version which is less censored. The only difference is that there aren't as many of the censor stickers. A lot of it is censored intentionally as part of the joke</br></br>  This thread is too confusing. I'm just going to forget it ever happened.  <br>Just how is it confusing to you?</br>  Is the manga/LN picked up yet? The anime is only 12 episodes...  <br>Apparently her name is Ranko Okuma.<br> Only know this because of a pixiv tag </br></br>  Well, apparently Okuma Ranko is the name of the MC's mom.  <br>Read that at the MC's character introduction in aniwotawiki: http://www49.atwiki.jp/aniwotawiki/<wbr>pages/30519.html</wbr></br>  <br>So she's his freakin mother? What a tweest</br>   hiryuu STILL not done <br><br>WTF???</br></br>  <br>Dunno if that blond girl and MC's mom is the same person though, since the name Annie Brown is also there on the wiki.</br>   tfw manga isn't translated   <br>Only the first 2 chapters of the manga was translated and only a few selected paragraphs from the LN.</br>  <br>No way that blond girl is his mother.

It's not inconceivable that's his mother. She does look way too young though.</br>  <br>anyone have this gif ?</br>  I can't wait for Anna to be corrupted  <br>It's a harem LN so it's probably his non-blood related sister</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This is Omura ranko, MC's mom. The blond girl is Annie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How is she so hot? Why do I want to do terribly lewd things to her?</br></br>  <br>Because she'll get flustered when you make lewd advances but still try to keep up.</br>  You wake up in shimonetaverse, what will you do?  <br>Rape everyone.</br>  <br>That looks like the female cop mentioned earlier from episode one.</br>  I must say I'm a bit disappointed.<br>They're doing La liberté guidant le peuple, but their liberté of the sexual revolution actually shows less skin than the original.</br>  <br>Webm alright?</br>  <br>If I keep my knowledge of the birds and the bees, I will demonstrate the knowledge to Scientist-chan. Then I'll look for Background Character-san, the one with the two antennas, and slowly corrupt her.</br>  <br>What wiki?</br>  This show is  Kuroko on head retarded.   <br><br>Kajo. Sex with Anna would be hot but she'd think nothing but sex and probably abandon her kids for kinky nympho sex.</br></br>  <br>Can't you tie her to her children by teaching her the joys of incest?</br>  <br><br>Anna should calm down a bit after getting the D, so I don't think her raising kids will be a problem.</br></br>  <br><br><br>"I was born in a small city. I was still a child when we were raided by perverts: foreign perverts.

First three eps were ok. But I don't have much time this season so just "ok" won't cut it. I was about to drop it halfway through the third episode but dat ending and this thread convinced me to give it 2 more episodes to stand out.</br>  Anna's mom is there too. I hope she gets some lewd moments  <br>Well things are going to get more interesting from this point on. Especially now that Anna has awakened her lewdness.</br>  Does the Tanuki stick it to Anna, or is just her one way lewdness? What's the farthest this kid goes with any girl sexually?  <br>He's still in love with Anna even up to now in the LN but he's gradually liking Kajo as well.</br>  What the fuck Hiryuu, you are way too late and nobody even cares about Fate Illya so just drop that shit and get back to us already.  <br>so is hiryuu not doing subs anymore? Who're the go to group for uncensored now?</br>  How do we fix Shimoneta?<br><br>Besides making Kajo have a dick.</br></br>  <br>Clawhammer uses the same video source as Hiryuu.

Perhaps the title of densest material on earth should go to you.</br>  <br> but that braid and glasses look does it for me every time. </br>  <br><br><br>am i the only who who thinks she looks like shit in the thick glasses?</br></br></br>  <br> waiting for hiryuu </br>  <br>This, also a threesome end. Fuck everyone is so sexually repressed in this that it'll probably just be one huge orgy.</br>  Episode 3 was everything I wanted from this adaptation.  Giving more depth and personality to Megu-nee was fucking brilliant.<br> I love you all SO WHY WON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR <br>Is gonna hurt like bricks.</br></br>   next episode is the bestgirl episode <br>Hype.</br>    Is this lewd?  Post Rii-san  <br> I'M SO HUNGRY, SO WHY WON'T YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR <br><br>I don't think I'm ready to see that after getting more development for Megu-nee.</br></br></br>  Does it follow the manga? First episode was annoying as hell.   Yuki only started enjoying school because all the ones who bullied her died    humanizing Kurumi more by expanding her crush on senpai <br> making Megu-nee a real character instead of a flat-ish twist on chapter 3 <br> giving real depth to Yuki by making it so that she was bullied in school <br>Thank you, based manga writer.</br></br></br>    Do I really have to use the HS release?  <br> humanizing Kurumi more by expanding her crush on senpai <br>How did it expand on her crush at all?</br></br>   got to see day zero in detail <br> got to see Megu-nee and Yuki before the attack <br> Yuki wasn't as energetic and was bullied <br> Yuki confirmed not to know any of the other members before the attack <br> Kurumi confirmed not dating senpai <br> this fucking scene <br><br>Now THIS is how you do an adaptation if you're not doing it 1:1. I just wished they showed the other girl that was on the roof that ran away when she thought Megu-nee was going to scold her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[stupid noises]</br>  <br> Kurumi realized her lust for blood that day </br>  <br>It's not funi, so it's at least tolerable</br>    remove dog  I dunno, when I was watching during the livewatch thread, opinions were not so favorable.  <br>Screams of sex</br>  Pretty glad to see the anime doing it's own thing. I feel like I might have blown through the manga too quickly when I first read it so I never got the impact a lot of people claim to have. The anime is definitely giving a different enough experience that it's hitting all the right points, even if I have a general idea of the upcoming story details.  <br>Not sure why, it was the best episode so far. Great direction, good art, backgrounds and atmosphere are spot-on and the expanded writing was very nice.</br>  <br>I don't see why. I've been one of the bigger critics of the first two episodes but I fucking loved this one.</br>  after see ep 03 I have again a doubt megu-nee is realy here or just in yuki head?? &gt;&lt;  <br> I feel like I might have blown through the manga too quickly when I first read it so I never got the impact a lot of people claim to have. <br><br>I feel the same too. At least, there's the new chapter coming anytime now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Everyone was just panicking because of all the changes.</br></br>    <br> yfw the moment when the shovel came down </br>  10/10 VA work.<br><br>Now if only Crunchy didn't look like dogshit.</br></br>  after see ep 03 I have again a doubt megu-nee is realy here or just in yuki head?? &gt;&lt;  <br> It was at that moment Kurumi lost her virginity to shovel-kun <br> Yuki saw it all <br> All the blood <br> The rough pounding in and out <br> In and out <br> In and out </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kurumifags   So how are yurifags handling the confirmation of Kurumi's heterosexuality? <br><br>Are they pulling the whole "bisexual" thing again despite the fact she only shows romantic attention towards men?</br></br>  <br><br>Because the pacing is starting to seem like they're not gonna adapt graduation and are gonna have an anime original ending.</br></br>  <br>I'm not weir/d/ enough for this.</br>  Skinship.    <br>Is that Komeji?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>At worst it will end in the episode in which Yuki suffers a break down after killing a zombie with the mop.</br>    <br> Are they pulling the whole "bisexual" thing again despite the fact she only shows romantic attention towards men? <br>It's a zombie apocalypse and most men are rapist assholes. That doesn't leave Kurumi many options, and lately she's getting pretty close to Miki.</br></br>  <br>Because<br> WAHHHH NOT 1:1 ADAPTATION <br> WAHHHH THEY DIDN'T [insert anything from the manga] </br></br></br>  <br>No skinship she says.</br>  <br>Aren't all the girls straight?</br>  <br>I pray this will be scanned.</br>  <br>Go away please.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice, but just a tad too large?</br>  <br>That's what graduation is. The rate they're going they're not gonna make it that far, despite it being a natural ending point.</br>  meguu-nee is really here or just yuki head? after EP 3 I have a doubt again...

There's the four instead of five people remark, there's everyone going "oh, Megu-ne's here?" after Yuki says Megu-ne's here (something they wouldn't say if they could actually see her, there's the way Miki talks about everyone really liking Megu-ne which indicates she never really met her, etc.</br></br>  <br> CD player <br><br>Does this show take place in the early 2000s?</br></br></br>   Megu-nee backstory <br> It wasn't even in the manga <br><br>Today was a good day</br></br></br>  <br>yeah... ;_; but I knew I wanted hoped she was still alive although I suspected that not</br>  <br> coming to /a/ for an adaptation of an airing series <br>Either read the manga or it's your own fault.</br></br>  <br><br> opening threads on an adaptation of a manga everyone's already read <br><br> kurumi_posing_like_costanza_with_b<wbr>aseball_bat.bmp</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  If it was so urgent, why didn't her mom just call her?

If Lerche keeps this up, this just might be AOTS.      <br>Which ones are sluts?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> marrying = being a slut <br>You're doing it very good.</br></br>  <br> commits herself to one man <br> slut </br></br>    <br><br> implying </br></br>  <br><br>Shovel. She wants to hold hands and get married with boys. Fucking lewd.</br></br>  <br>But Yuki isn't a slut</br>   Megu-nee hears her mom get attacked <br> instantly forgets about her mom dying right on the phone to help put a locker in front of a door <br><br>NOT ONE TEAR WAS SHED</br></br></br>  <br><br>I said best, not worst.</br></br>  I wonder if she thought of her school days when she said this.<br><br>Fuck, and seeing Yuki before the zombies hit makes me wonder if Yuki actually prefers things the way they are now in the manga than they were back when everything was normal.</br></br>  <br>Nah man, that was another staff member inside the school.</br>  <br>That was another teacher in the staff room. Were you browsing /a/ while you were watching, or something?</br>  <br><br>Given her reaction to Shovel taking care of business for the first time, I'm pretty sure she would prefer not being in a zombie apocalypse, hence her delusional escapism.</br></br>  <br>Miki Kurumi yuri doujins when?</br>  <br>Based author and Lerche. The silent cuts when shovel went full psycho gave me chills.  She should've gotten a bit more bloodsplattered though. </br>  <br><br>My point still stands! NOT ONE TEAR!</br></br>  <br>Miki is pure though, what are you talking about?</br>  <br> tfw you realize that Yuki is the mastermind behind the zombie incident </br>  <br><br>I said best, not second best.</br></br>  <br> Kurumi's face is full of horror <br><br>But that fang cracks me up. Damn.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I don't know what makes you think shovel slut is the best. I eagerly await the day she turns.</br>  <br>I know you said best, that's why I said best girl Miki isn't a slut</br>  <br>Why do you think all her classmates bully her?<br>She's the biggest slut in the school.</br></br>    Guess I'll rewatch this episode, since people keep saying it's good.  <br> School bullies not so tough since being zombied. </br>  <br><br> wanting justification for why the one girl who actually kills zombies on a regular basis is best <br> suggesting instead that the biggest liability, brainproblems-chan, is somehow best girl <br><br>0/10 would not survive with you in a zombie apocalypse</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you too</br>  <br>But that's Rii now, not Yuki.</br>  <br>Stop bullying Yuki</br>    <br>Anon, she wants to party with drunk college guys.</br>  Yuki's gone from my third to my second favorite.  <br>The most erotic faces</br>  <br>I will not accept this slander against best girl</br>  Hat Yuki or no hat Yuki?  Is this seriously the best adaptation of the season? Paint me surprised.  <br>I really hope she gets some sort of specific role in the group. Right now she seems to be a little bit of everything.</br>    <br>use the right font next time.</br>  <br>Best adaptation since Clannad.</br>  Someone say best girl?<br><br><br>Toughest question I've faced in a while.<br>I like both.</br></br></br></br>  Insanity Shovel When.  <br>No hat is better but I wouldn't mind saving hat Yuki.</br>  <br>She's a lesser Kurumi.</br>  <br>She'll take over Kurumi's role once the latter bites the dust.</br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth</br>  I don't remember all this shit in the manga<br>Is it all original? If so they're doing a pretty damn good job</br>  Hmm what series was it where the guy had his waifu zombified and he had her chained up but still loved her.<br><br>Might not have been an anime though. Shaman King maybe?</br></br>    <br>Also a lesser Rii, shown when she was able to help keep stock of everything. And a lesser Yuki, shown when she was able to help Kurumi out mentally a couple of times.<br><br>I don't think she's really cut out to be Kurumi's replacement, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait to see her breaking apart.</br>  <br> senpai had Rii on his left and Kurumi on his right <br><br>Too bad the cards didn't play right.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the partys sanity core, also the partys backup fighter</br>  <br>it was that teacher with brown hair and glasses , the one that speaked to megumi before watching the "accidents" in TV</br>  <br>I'm not wrong.<br><br>Bookkeeping isn't something they need to do anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>I can think of half a dozen zombie series with that trope.</br>  <br>Only straight girl?</br>  <br><br><br>Shaun of the dead</br></br></br>  <br>Sankarea<br> Just because I was looking at it today anon. </br></br>  <br> She's the partys sanity core <br>That's Yuki, keeping everyone sane</br></br>  <br>Ed sure was a cute waifu.</br>  <br>Kurumi had a boyfriend, Miki wants to get drunk with older boys.</br>  <br>She's the male MC in female form.<br><br>Prove me rong.</br></br></br>  <br>This is a bad memory as well. Senpai wasn't actually bitten, he reached for Rii's chest and Kurumi went crazy.</br>  The comfiest anime of the season  alongside with NNB repeat   <br>She didn't want to, she was too pure and didn't understand what was going on.<br><br>Thankfully, based Kei saved her from having her purity ruined</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you m8</br>   Yuki says it's sad they're going to be graduating but Megu-nee won't will have to stay at school because she's in fact already dead. <br> Yuki enjoys school now that her bullies are dead <br> that flashback <br><br>I'm on the fucking edge of my seat. And I still haven't finished it. AOTS confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br> Kurumi had a boyfriend <br>Proven she didn't this episode. Senpai probably liked her back though but was too beta to act on it.</br></br>  WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU  <br><br>Any sane survival party would've thrown Yuki in the trash by day two at the latest. They literally have to be cute Japanese girls in order to be the one demographic on the planet polite enough not to cut off the mentally ill dead weight during a survival scenario.</br></br>  <br>Why was he even hanging out at the school? He already graduated</br>  <br> Senpai kept coming back to the high school even though he graduated just to be around Kurumi <br> He wasn't confident enough to ask her on a date </br></br>  <br>You forget these are japanese school girls, not jaded battlehardened fat neckbeards like ourselves<br><br>Yuki keeps them from going nuts, like Rii is right now</br></br></br>  <br>He went back for his kouhai's pussy</br>  <br>I wouldn't, she's an important  A S S et.</br>  <br>Apparently it's not uncommon for graduates to visit their old club and kouhai.</br>  <br><br> H-Hey, Kurumi, I was in the neighborhood and just thought I'd stop by so you could kill me after I turn into a zombie and have a definitive turning point where you leave behind your childhood innocence and become a pro survivalist... I mean, if you want to that is. I-It's OK if you're not into that, b-baka... </br></br>   You'll always be the same Megu-nee, no matter what the reason <br><br>DEEP</br></br>  <br>I've seen sankarea, that's not it at all, in sankarea she retains all her human qualities despite being a zombie and basically the only thing that changes is that she doesn't need to poop, it's retarded.</br>  <br>Maybe they didn't throw her away because she's a human being and their friend. I don't blame you. You clearly haw no friends, so it's difficult for you to empathize with their situation.</br>  <br> Miki <br> pure <br>If Kei hadn't stepped in she would probably have fucked him.</br></br></br>    <br>Miki would never have stooped to such impure levels</br>  <br><br> You clearly have no friends <br><br>At least I'll be alive after the zombie attacks go down, bleedingheart-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in sankarea she retains all her human qualities </br>  <br> muh nakama </br>    <br><br>People still buy a lot of CDs in Japan</br></br>  <br>S-she's just being l-lewd..!</br>  <br> Kimono <br> garterbelt <br>Fuck this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That was your fault and you know it</br>  <br><br>No, since Megu-ne has a smart phone.</br></br>  This is looking to be an original anime ending.  And I'm alright with It, they are doing all the tricks to perfectly wrap it up in 12 episodes.   <br>I got spoiled too anon, feel like shit right now, but just a few moments ago, while watching the opening for the episode, I realised how little she appeared in it, so it was kind of a giveaway</br>  <br><br> tfw they finally make it to randall labs Yuki turns on everyone and escapes in a helicopter </br></br>  am i the only one that is picturing the cast singing "who do you voodoo bitch"?    <br><br>yes now please go back to /v/</br></br>  <br>The shitty guy was trying to take advantage of her innocence</br>    <br>I'd have tried it, too.</br>  <br>Sure</br>  Which "this is the best adaptation ever"fags are worse: GG or MonMusu?  <br>I love this, yurishit is getting annoying</br>  <br>Time for a ciesta.</br>  <br>and you too because you know what he's talking about</br>  <br>Both fanbases a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>GG is actually good, so MonMusu.</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>Gotta have the token straight character. Everyone else is pretty gay so it's okay.</br>  Since this episode was not in the manga are anime only fags not secondaries anymore? I'm tired of being treated like shit in these threads because I can't read manga  I thought they were running on power off a generator? Why are they just now talking about not having electricity? I got confused as to whether or not the camping scene was supposed to take place only a few days after the attack, or the present, which seems to be a few weeks after.  <br>Here comes the typical "the others like something a lot, they are cancer because I am a hipster/contrarian". This was your free reply.</br>  <br>Solar panels. It's been cloudy lately.</br>  <br>You're still a fucking secondary.<br><br>Solar panels on the roof. What would a generator run off of?</br></br></br>  <br> because I can't read manga <br><br> What? why? </br></br></br>  <br> because I can't read manga <br>That's your own fault, you filthy secondary.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, anime only pleb.</br>  <br><br>Ok. I'm an anime-only fag so I guess it was explained in the manga.</br></br>  <br> cant read manga <br><br>Get a load of this pleb</br></br></br>  <br> getting <br> gettING <br>It has been for a long time anon, you just haven't been paying attention. Around the time /u/fags stopped being fat neckbeards and started being fat lesbians, it got bad. Then it became less about the cuteness and purity and was appropriated by deluded people with an agenda to push.</br></br></br>   mangafags are on the same level as anime only fags now <br>How can Lerche be so based?</br>  <br>It was explained in episode 2, you're just blind.</br>  <br>Yuri isn't about cuteness and purity? Must be missing it then.</br>  <br>To be fair they didn't show that it was cloudy and rainy a lot recently in the anime so it still doesn't explain why they were out of power.</br>  Megu-nee really ins't cut out to be a teacher she has less presence than Akari, I generally felt sorry for her when they left her out of the camping prep  <br>The first episode was still shit outside of the reveal. This episode made up for it though.</br>  <br> I can't read manga <br>are you actually retarded or something?</br></br>  <br> Around the time /u/fags stopped being fat neckbeards and started being fat lesbians, it got bad <br>The problem is everyone thinking that groups are some sort of hivemind on the internet. There are still cute yuri fags just as much as there are agenda yuri fags</br></br>  <br>Hey give her time to rest in peace, she's clearly dead tired from protecting them from the zombies.</br>  <br>Thank you, now I see I'm just dumb and cant remember shit from only a week ago.</br>  <br>To be fair, yes they did.</br>  <br>She's  no longer alive. She's a zombie that is going to bite Kurumi later on when they decide to get supplies from a secret basement prepared for the situation of infection. </br>  <br>If only I could have been there to protect sweet Megu-nee.<br> And then dick her. </br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>Megu-nee is the best girl.</br></br>  <br> I generally felt sorry for her when they left her out of the camping prep <br>That's cause she's dead, Jim. How often do you include dead people in your plan making?</br></br>  <br>Well she is the only adult in the group so I guess she does have to bear the responsibility ot keeping watch but I don't think it's safe for her to sleep in a separate room, in all the shots so far we see the girls sleeping together but no clue as to where Megu-nee spends the night</br>  <br>I used the wrong words then, my apologies.<br>but seriously, fuck yuri, literally, so they stop being dykes and give in to dick workshipping</br></br>  <br>Anon please...</br>   Yuki being bullied <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes you manga only lords have spoiled that for me since ep 1 but I think this anime adaptation is different, she is alive so far at least as well as the dog which I'm told is a zombie pet that they keep in the manga</br></br>  <br> screenshot from a flashback </br>  <br>She is a great girl, but I just can't fap to the dead.</br>  <br><br>Get a load of these guys. I honestly can't tell if you're trolling or are just a blind anime only fag.</br></br>   was watching the episode <br> flashback was awesome, was excited as fuck <br> shit was over quickly and it went moe <br> me thinking "let's hope they're not gonna spend the whole second half on moe only" <br> episode ends shortly after, still focusing on Megu-nee <br> mfw episode flew by without noticing </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not alive. You're a retard. And no they don't keep a zombie pet.</br>    <br> which I'm told is a zombie pet that they keep in the manga <br>It's not, read the manga.<br> she is alive so far at least <br>How fucking blind can you be? This has been the least subtle foreshadowing ever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first chapter's worth are the last pages too.</br>  <br>She really does wear a stupid hat though.</br>  <br> There are still cute yuri fags just as much as there are agenda yuri fags <br>Yes but you can't separate them anymore, if you allow one then you allow both, so they should keep their shit on their containment board.</br></br>  <br>But why was she wearing the hat if the other girls kept snickering behind her back?</br>  <br>I'd have taken her as my gf during college days.</br>  yuki will eventually die, right? I mean, in her state she is pretty much dead weight.  <br><br> But why was she wearing the hat if the other girls kept snickering behind her back? <br><br>Her solution to all problems is avoidance. She just pretended she wasn't being bullied by not paying attention to them.</br></br></br></br>  The main reason why Evangelion is so successful is because it omnipandered to audiences more than any other Anime in existence.  <br>wat</br>  <br>Sure mann whatever that means</br>   omnipandered <br><br>That's a new one, but I understand what you are trying to say<br><br>As much as people like to meme that he's a hack a large portion of the success falls on the combination of Anno's superb direction and his fragile emotional and mental state<br><br>It was really good but not for the reasons viewers expected, it took everyone by surprise and became infamous for it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's just because it's fuggin cool as fug and a lot of people appreciated that at the time.<br><br>The whole mecha and waifu thing was a good invitation for a lot of people</br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1547<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn <br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1546 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Kongou.

Made a gif lol.  <br>Requesting Riders Medusa and Astolfo making out.</br>  <br>So why cant there be one drawthread then exactly?</br>  <br>why would you use your talent for something this evil...</br>  <br>Very nice. Love that process.</br>  <br>There could be, I wouldn't care.<br><br>At first I wanted mostly to draw waifus, not because I'm bad or hung up on cute girls, but because I wanted to make waifufags happy<br><br>But so many of them are evil, antisocial, scheming cunts, I got over it<br><br>Might as well mix it all together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't know what to request for the weekend and I don't understand why I'm making this post since none of you faggots are going to give a decent suggestion.  <br>What makes waifufags and regular requesters so different in terms of personality that there is this need to separate them?</br>  <br>Very nice.

A lot of these anons have waifus from more obscure series that don't get to see new images of her just by checking a few pixiv artists' pages.

Since they haven't fixed it you need to say why it's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  /r/ing girls in gags, please  <br>I tried. Hope this is fine?</br>  <br>New colorfag here. How do you choose your colors so that they fit with each other when you're shading?</br>  <br>Is 4chin kinda broken to anyone else? some images won't load</br>  <br>Do you really think they fit or are you being sarcastic? (It's too late, I can't tell)<br>Anyway, I can't really explain how, like I don't really have a specific method.I just randomly throw them together until I think it looks ok. <br>I do color on one layer most of the time, if that helps?</br></br></br>  Question for drawfags. Does someone not rerequesting after you said it's okay to rerequest make you feel good? Or do you feel indifferent to it.  <br>It at least makes me feel better than when someone rerequests but it could have several reasons other than OP being satisfied with your drawing so I guess it's nothing to be happy about.</br>  <br>That forest is absolutely beautiful  I really like the addition of the deer . Thanks a ton</br>  <br>I was being serious. I asked because I really like the way you painted the skin for the person and the shark, even though it's got a blue here and a purple there, it all seems to fit together. I was kind of curious as to how that works together, because it looks really good.</br>  <br>It's never happened. Because I'm better than average, for one, and second because anyone who ever actually rerequests gets anally raped by other requesters.<br><br>Because I generally put effort into my deliveries I would be annoyed if it did happen, because the only reason I could imagine for someone to do it is to purposefully offend me.<br><br>If I was terrible I'd be a little sad but not offended.</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting this scene with Mimibro-tan and Mimi.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/K8NW9qT.jpg<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/HfaN4FO.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are some good colors</br>  <br>Thanks a bunch then. <br>It's blue-ish at some parts because I color in the whole artwork with a color like blue and purple first, lock it and then just use a brush that smudges the colors well to color and shade. It's easier to keep it all in the same color spectrum this way, which automatically makes drawings look more harmonic altogether.<br>Link related: http://livepaintinglessons.com/gamu<wbr>tmask.php</wbr></br></br></br>  Give advice and/or tell me that i'm shit<br><br><br>got a tumblr/DA?<br>it's to give you credit <br><br><br> Happy Hanukkah </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that his mom?</br>  <br>Do you feel the same when it's an open request?</br>  <br><br>Delivered.<br>I've been working on this during my breaks, I hope you like it.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's his girlfriend.</br>  <br>Looks pretty good for just flatcolor. Is it going to stay like this or are you gonna add more shadow/lightning?</br>    <br>That is meaty.<br><br>Hope this means we get some chubby lolis later.</br></br></br>  <br>Noice. Not a fan of the fingernails though.</br>  <br>It's absolutely stunning anon, those feathers are just magnificent to look at too.<br><br>Thank you so much</br></br></br>  <br>Noooooooooooo.</br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br><br>The feathers are just a brush with some overlay effects tho... But I'm happy you like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really timid with the lighting. If you're going for rim lighting at least up the contrast. Also make it bigger.</br>  <br>Not sure what you mean by "open".<br><br>Like, "draw your own interpretation of X"?<br><br>Nah, I wouldn't care. More people who do that, the less of a faggot I feel like for trying it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot, anon. I still don't really get it, but I'll look around and see if I can find anything besides that link. <br>I've just been coloring in base colors and then gradually darkening the shade like a gradient.</br></br>  <br>In general, a child's body isn't that different from an adult's, especially in anime. Heads are generally bigger, and they don't have developed shoulders and waists yet, but the other proportions are about the same.<br>In your drawing, her head's not actually connected to her spine. Her arm and leg bones are inconsistent in length, causing her to look lanky also.<br>I hope this helps.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks m8!</br>    There's nothing wrong with girls being big and soft!  <br>I hope you choke and die on a double dipped corndog ycake.</br>  <br>Is there a way to rotate the shape?<br><br><br>It is going to stay like that unfortunately. I just wanted to get something done for the day.<br><br><br>It was not meant to be rim light. But I can see why you thought that.<br> Also make it bigger <br>I was messing around on the size but it felt like I was making it too large and I was not digging it. <br>Also thanks for the advice!<br><br>Anyone know a program, or website, or something that can let me mess with light interacting on random objects?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking health </br></br>  <br>You're just as bad as footfags.</br>  S3 and OVA hype  SAKI SAKI SAKI!<br>OI!

Snow or the Dragonkin would be in the OP category.</br>  This the LN thread? Picked up Risou no Himo Seikatsu and Slime reincarnation, finished reading all of the latter.<br><br>Not liking what Himo is becoming and the later parts of Slime reincarnation were downright terrible.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and "japanese military isn't OP in Gate, their guns are".<br><br>Giovanni isn't "OP" his stand is.</br></br></br>  <br> liquid magic metal <br>So he is a master gunsmith that can get millimeter accuracy when making parts?<br> magic <br>Oh wait, now everything makes sense</br></br></br></br>  <br>what do you expect from a Hentai artist? he doesn't want to explain everything hes not good at it</br>  <br>What do you mean? How so?</br>  Would it kill Japan to make a fantasy that isn't a self-insert wankfest?  <br> Giovanni <br>Literally who?<br><br>What you said is correct though.<br>Even without going into requiem GE is already OP.<br>Jotaro and possibly Joseph is the only OP Jojo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  BTW how is the GATE Anime? someone told me its stupid, should i watch it?, or should i just read the manga/LN  <br>No idea, maybe someone from Soldat's party or the author is derivating from the WN. If there is a point to do so, it's this volume.<br>Or that girl who became his nanny later? But she should be older.<br>No clue.</br></br></br>  Anyone here is reading the Marginal Operation LN? im reading it in wordpress but the translation is slow.  <br>Dear anon, if someone has an OP tool, and that someone can and does use it, then that someone is considered OP.<br><br>Just like countries are considered superpowers as long as they have weapons of mass destruction, even if the country was literally made out of scrawny nerds.</br></br></br>  <br>Its magic in the sense that it takes the shape of the object you're thinking of when you're holding it. It has a few drawbacks and takes him a while to get rid. <br><br><br>Yes, a modern military is going to curbstomp an ancient roman military. You're also talking about events where the Not-Romans haven't sent out their better units. They have Dragon Riders taking out Helicopters later.<br><br><br>Artist=/=Author<br>He's just doing the illustration.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, too bad but damm the artist konw how to make the characters,</br>  <br>Hmm, i didn't expect that well, this is the first time i know of it, i expected it to be the same as the manga an hentai artist tried to make, kinda funny to think about it</br>  <br><br> The man who wrote kino's journey. <br><br>I don't even know this kind of pain existed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least say it's his knowledge that's OP.</br>  Picked up.  <br>He IS a gun otaku, and his first productions had some issues too. If youre just trashing the bit that was in the ln then youre just a retard, not that means the ln is spared from being "just another ln".</br>  <br>No, they still make fantasy without that silly self-insert stuffs.<br>Examples: Rokka no Yuusha, Overlord, and what this nigga said</br></br>  As someone asked before what are some good LN to read, i picked the one of the survival spider and this one of harem and guns but i want more  <br> Overlord <br> not silly self insert <br>Hahah.</br></br></br>  <br>That'd be just beating around the bush. He's OP, no two ways around it. It doesn't matter if he's OP because of his knowledge, weapons, bloodline or super amazing training he received as a kid.</br>  quick /a/ create an LN title about something that happened to you<br><br> I'm trying to clean up dog shit in my backyard but spiders keep getting on the handle of my shovel?!?! </br></br>  <br> I can barely eat 1 meal each day?!?! </br>  <br> It's a nice day outside but I'm about to play Way of the Samurai 4 on PC? </br>  <br>At least he isn't OP because of super special power.</br>  <br> I want to watch anime but shitposting on 4chins is more gratifying?! </br>  <br>I tried to complete the captcha but the images arent what google ask me to choose!</br>  <br>But I just read in the thread that he can control liquid metal.<br><br>That's rad and OP as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who can do magic can, IIRC.</br>   LNs   <br>All the people he makes guns for are better than him though.</br>  <br>What are you trying to imply?</br>  <br>It's a magical metal anyone with magic can shape, and one you shape it into something, you can't reshape it again. He bought a shitton of it so he can make some guns.</br>  <br>Ainz is weaker in 1 vs 1 than most of his guild and probably a lot of players, that doesn't make him not OP.</br>  <br>What about just Ns?</br>  <br><br>Yeah liquid metal is just a magic tool that takes a shape when you apply magic to it. MC spent years working out making a gun with it.</br></br>  <br>Its a simple magic and the liquid is heavy, expensive and not really a great space saver. He cant do much since his magic is shit.</br>  <br> I Feel Like Watching Prison School But I Already Masturbated!? </br>  <br>Let me clearer then, Lute's only claim to fame is his ability to make guns. All his other abilities are shit tier even with all the training he's done to try to make up for it.</br>  <br>Having a marketable skill makes you OP.</br>  <br>He is only OP because of circumstances, which is everyone else that exists is much weaker than him.</br>  <br> I try to get a job but I keep watching Chinese Cartoons!?!? </br>  <br> He is only OP because of circumstances, which is everyone else that exists is much weaker than him. <br><br>A lot of Gary Stus are only OP because the writer made everyone else an idiot on purpose. Kirito also.<br><br>But note that I'm not calling Ainz a gary stu, only OP. For some reason you guys seem to have a massive allergy to the word OP and automatically treat it as a negative trait and try to rationalize it in every way possible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to remember why Kirito got his twin sword skill.</br>  <br>Yes he also has plot convenience and "luck/good genes" but everyone else is also an incompetent idiot to help make him shine.<br><br>Other examples of LNs with everyone in the universe being very stupid just to make MC seem smarter when coming up with normal ideas : Zhan Long and LMS. <br><br> "H-He actually thought of using a healing class with damage skills!? Impossibru how did he think of it?" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momonga-sama isn't a gary stu, the only bitches that love him are Albedo and Shaltear<br><br><br>He got it cause he is faster blah blah blah but only him was the only one whit it, you know about the fact that he got his personal harem? he got the most beutiful bitch to be his GF, it doesn't matter in what videogame he enter, he will always be a fucking gary stu and only one person was better than him, and even so if im not wrong it was from the game</br></br></br></br>  <br> Momonga-sama isn't a gary stu <br>Yeah, that's what I said.</br></br>  <br>yeah and i was going to say alot more but i stopped to say the stuuf about kirito.<br><br>He isn't really one but he is in the line too close, it doesn't matter that he is weak, that's just his way os seeing the things, right now he if wanted could destroy that world little by little</br></br></br>  <br> I should be working right now but i'm wasting my time on an american imageboard instead?! </br>  <br>Fantasy characters get modern guns? Isn't that part of what happens in GATE?</br>  <br> "Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?" <br> cute spider <br>I was planing to pick up thinking it had a sentient cloud as MC, dammit.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm Trying To Finish Ocarina Of Time For The First Time Since I First Played in 1998 But The Mummies In The Shadow Temple Do Way Too Much Damage And Remind Me Of Why I Stopped Playing The Original! </br>  <br>It's complete shit</br>  <br>git gud</br>  <br>That seems like there will be new content, or at least expand in the adventurer days or dragon subjugation parts</br>  <br>I can't help it, the Redead scream triggered me as a 9 year old and it still does to this day</br>  Death March anime when?<br> Bunch of cute girls in love with him <br> Goes out of his way to fuck prostitutes instead </br></br>  <br>What's with the huge number of fantasy mc's that are strictly anti-lolicon anyway?</br>  <br>Death March's MC was a mid to late 20s guy. He likes women his age, not kids.</br>  <br> Lolicon is a disease <br>I suppose the same reason we're seeing a WILL YOU ALL JUST HAVE CHILDREN ALREADY message permeate.</br></br>  <br>Authors don't want to write about cute girls but their editors won't let them not<br><br>Also, pedophilia is wrong<br>Being attracted to 2D little girls as a 3D person is fine. 2D adult on 2D little girl is gross</br></br></br></br>  Will reading this in the original teach me gun lingo?  <br>only if you feel like dropping a JDAM on a school or something</br>  <br>I am arguing with my team leader on why I should use this internet signal to browse 4chan, as I lay down inside a M1126 Strykers' drivers hole in the middle of NTC.</br>  What's the story of Mushoku Tensei? Thinking of picking it up if it's interesting enough.  <br>Horrible worthless person gets reincarnated into another world and resolves to actually make the most of his second chance.<br><br>It's a lot more interesting than it sounds.</br></br></br>  <br>Is he a super special snowflake or only good because of his wits?</br>  <br>He was born with magic potential and he trained it like crazy so he is super strong in that way but fighting strength really isn't that important to the overall story.</br>  <br>Nah, not enough Light novel volumes yet. I don't think so, anyways.</br>  Why are all these LN protags pretty boy fags?  <br>I would probably read it.</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei is about the growth of a person. It has action, waifus, and a plot. <br><br>But I think the ultimate focus is on Rudeus/the main character. His thought process which is laid bare to you every step of the way. You end up watching his character progression from a lowly neet to a proper man of that world.<br><br>I think the ending scene showed it really well when(warning actual legitimate spoiler)  in Hitogami's final talk with him, Rudeus had his new body instead of his old one. <br><br>The main story/plot that kicks in down the line is pretty much a spoiler. What can be said is the premise which is a basic gifted reincarnation story.<br><br>While powerful and gifted with our modern education, he ends up making mistakes. Many which he regrets and keeps himself from growing conceited. It has all the stuff an otaku would like, but it also had very solid writing for the main character's growth which I appreciated a lot. He actually reflects on his past life and his mistakes from that time a few times from that story as well. <br><br>In comparison, Naofumi from Tate no Yuusha's character progression was from optimistic youth to jaded and pessimistic near instantly. And he pretty much stayed that way the entire time. He always remained something of a gentle caretaker as well even if he was tsundere about it.<br><br>A lot of reincarnation/transported series just kind of gloss over the character's development like that actually. <br><br>Lute just decides to make guns to make it big. Hajime just went from bullied to CoolEdge McGee Railgun. Rimuru the slime just sort of started city making upon being asked and never really stopped though I guess that's because he was originally a very compliant Japanese Businessman.<br><br>Rudeus is different. He carries his regrets and actually reflects. Actually thinking about it, it's a main theme of the story considering the title. He got another chance and truly made the best of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who else Kawakami here?  <br>Some of us are.<br><br> Hexennacht manga ant size cover. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Do these publishers have any standards to what they will put out with their name on it?<br><br>How hard is it to get an LN published?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you not read OPs post?</br></br>  <br> Do these publishers have any standards <br>I like to think some of them do.<br><br> How hard is it to get an LN published? <br>Write a web novel in Japanese, get very popular, enter the web novel in a light novel contest.

Just like Hime.    I have a question /pc/:<br><br>Would you support next year's All Stars movie being done entirely in CGI if it meant that every Cure would have a speaking role?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Watching Haru no Carnival made really pissed with all those silent Cures.</br>  <br> I thought having Nagisa address Hikari only to have her cut off my Mepple was cold, but hilarious </br>  <br>yes if they made it movie length (90 minutes or more) as even in the early all stars the older Cures didn't get many lines.</br>  <br>Every cure having a decent role in a short film is a pipe dream at this point. There are just too many of them any more and lots of them probably don't even want to be voicing cures forever.</br>  <br>Only if it will have good combat scenes. I love first All Stars DX.</br>  <br>I think that's more important to me than them even speaking to be honest. If they could all get some love in the fight animation aspect, I wouldn't mind a lack of voices much.</br>  <br>I don't really care about it. Give me good hand-to-hand combat and beamspam against lots of giant enemies.</br>  <br>I just wish other groups got as much love from the animators/storyboarders as Nagisa and Honoka do for instance.</br>  <br>They managed to get all of them back last year for the 10th anniversary, I'm fairly certain most if not all of them would accept coming back one last time if it was exactly that, one last time.<br><br>Basically go out with one last All Stars movie, giving every cure screen time and speaking roles, and then end it with all the cure's except the current team saying their final farewells. From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe like a few teams even, but yeah ALL of them is just getting to be too much. My favorite group is the Max Hearts, so you know, I tend to get a lot of fanservice, but even still I think it would be best if they limit it to a few groups per movie, probably the current and two before or something. Maybe do another ALL of em crossover when they get to 100 cures or something, assuming everyone is still alive.</br>  <br> From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it. <br>I'm conflicted about this. On one side, this is undoubtly better, both for the writing and the budget. But on the other side, how else could I see Nagisa and Honoka being awesome, hearing Tsubomi's lovely voice, and watching Erika being Erika again?</br></br>  <br> hearing Tsubomi's lovely voice <br><br>Imagine being the person having to break the news to Mizuki Nana</br></br></br>  <br>I hope they become best friends and partake many wacky shenanigans and copious amounts of screentime.</br>  <br>Isn't she really famous though? Probably just being able to put her name on posters helps sell tickets. I'd bet she shows up in crossover movies until she literally can't anymore for physical reasons like being dead.</br>    was this typeset?    Usually I'm a real sucker for girls who are good with kids. I fall for kindergarten teachers all the time. But Nao never really played this angle up much outside of a couple moments and presumably the rest of this focus episode, huh? Too bad. It's already super cute.  December webshop exclusive.  <br>The only angle Smile cures played up was their retardation. Outside the single character episode they got near the end.</br>  Well this was kind of unexpected, but pretty funny. I thought they'd magic themselves some music skills but I guess they just pretended.  <br>Why did Sailor Moon get 2 figures?</br>  <br> creating merch for fan cures <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>She has 4, actually.</br>  <br>This look isn't too bad for Doremi either.</br>  <br>Did they just pretend that? I haven't seen it in a while, but I know the voice actors formed an idol unit called Maho-dou while the series aired, so I thought it was meant that the ojamajos actually could play as a band. It's shown that Hazuki does play violin, and Doremi does play piano anyway. Also, Onpu sings and Ako plays harmonica at least. They're different instruments sure, but I used to play sax in school and making the jump to my little brother's keyboard was easy enough and after school I picked up guitar because saxophones were too expensive. <br><br><br>Doremi is super cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This mother fucker.<br><br><br>They pretended to play to a karaoke background.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Sailor Moon in that picture is actually Nephrite (a villain from season 1) in disguise as Sailor Moon - which I find to be kind of a waste of a figure, since he only wore that disguise in one episode. I'd rather have a Naru figure.</br>  <br>I want her mankai manko.</br>    <br>Zoisite. Nephrite was the dude.<br><br> I think. Haven't seen it since I was a babby. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm boring. I like all the ships Toei actually pushes and don't really care about much else. Nagisa x FujiP made for ADORABLE Nagisa moments. Hime's little crush on Seiji was adorable too, but then the date with Megumi was even better for me.</br>  <br>Ah. ANd here I thought the face was just fucked up as a shoutout to Crystal or something. Clearly I know nothing about sailor moon, but that's actually kind of cool they'd make a figure for something like that. I hope Precure will get the same treatment in another 10 years.</br>  <br>Zoisite is a dude too. They just made him female for the dub.</br>  <br>Well shit.</br>  <br> that's actually kind of cool they'd make a figure for something like that <br>No it's not, they're only doing it because it's cheaper to re-use the same figure with different colors and face decals than to make something new.</br></br>  <br>And the same with Fisheye</br>  Cure Sunshine would have been much better if she didn't have the long hair,.  <br>Oh, but you're so wrong.</br>    <br>If you mean every cure except Rin, sure</br>  <br>Something like gdgd Fairies? Sure.</br>  <br>That reminds me I need to watch the second season of this. The first was wonderful.</br>  <br>I also wish Minarai Diva was subbed.</br>  <br> From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it. <br>I don't see why people think this would somehow be good. Look at New Stage 1. <br><br>The other Cures only appear in the opening montage and then near the end of the final battle, and yet it was one of the worst All Star Movies, in spite of the Smiles and Suite being the only Cures around during 80% of the movie.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Haruyama makes Kirara like 50 times more sexual than she already is, it's a dangerous amount of sasuga to be able to make</br>  <br>I'm surprised that Kirara's hand isn't on Towa's butt.</br>  <br>There is usually a contract that the company needs to use the current seiyuu for future representative for the same character regardless the excuses (i.e:Aya Hirano for Haruhi). If you want to have all the voices, you need to pay all the precure seiyuu. Note: there is a minimum sum for a contract (union things), it doesn't mean the company can pay very little if the line is short. Now, you can imagine the cost if all precures have their own voice</br>  Why do you guys watch a magical girl show    There is unrest in the forest<br>There is trouble with the cures<br>For the purples want more screentime<br>and the pinks ignore their pleas.</br></br></br>  Wait... we have forgotten one thing.<br>How could other students not notice Towa's elf ears?</br>  <br>Because?</br>  <br><br>Isn't it usually hidden behind her hair?</br></br>  <br>Kirara clearly understands what is to be done with elves.</br>  <br>I'm afraid I don't understand the question.</br>  <br><br>I don't know anymore.

Also, it's cute and fun.</br>  I want her  <br>For le what? Good thing I didn't pay attention to French in high school. Why did I even pick French when German was an option? Never thought it would come in useful watching subtitled chinese cartoons though.</br>  <br>Only if you like Commie sub</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm really regretting using them, but not enough to bother redownloading episodes. <br><br>What's a "Despairvil" supposed to be anyway.<br><br>All of this is a distraction from the more important topic of how much I want to fuck a french cat.</br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why Kirara does not want Pafu to dress Towa is that she wants to strip Towa by herself  <br>A very sad one? But no, that is actually more important, I agree. I also would nyani her until she was sore.</br>  <br>WE'LL NEVER GET TO SEE THE ADVENTURES OF TAIYOMAN</br>  <br> I want to fuck a french cat <br><br/></br></br>    <br>When's the last time her human form appeared, I'm getting withdrawal symptoms over here.</br>  <br> Why did I even pick French when German was an option? <br>Why would you pick either unpopular language when Spanish or Portuguese would take you to much more interesting places, with more sunshine?<br><br>Picture related, it's sunshine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like brown people, or warm weather.</br>  <br>Why would you pick any language other than superior Nihonese?</br>  <br> I don't like brown people, or warm weather. <br> 90° in Berlin. <br> Germany is full of Arabs. <br>You are too dumb to live.<br><br><br>That's a good question.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. You may have noticed already but Smile staff didn't really care much about Nao. They strung her around doing little things here and there but never nothing substantial unlike everyone else until the very last end where it's far way too late for you to start caring. And even that episode clearly has less budget and effort on it in comparison to everyone's else episodes.<br><br>My theory is that the staff didn't treat Nao as well as everyone else on purpose because they did not want to overshadow their obvious favorite in Akane because "durr they are both tomboys hurr" like so many idiots here on /pc/ also parrot.</br></br></br>  <br>Man you fucked up because the strongest sandniggerland places in yurop are France and the UK.<br><br>Also, Spain is a shit. It's the ass of Europe and Spainiards are the spics of it.</br></br></br>  <br>The things i would do to Miss Shamour.</br>  <br>I thought the Slavlands/Russia were the ass of Europe.<br><br>I guess Europe can have two asses.</br></br></br>    <br>France isn't any better off.</br>  Oi, I didn't want to choose a language based on wanting to go to that place. German just sounds cool. French sounds fucking gay.<br><br><br>The cutest Dalek ever.</br></br></br>  <br>France and Germany are both fine.<br><br>YOU are fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi looks like she was drawn by  Tom Preston  there.</br></br>  <br>Okay now, that reminds me of something only very tangentially related, but does anyone remember some Toei Phil animator having a breakdown on social media about criticism of Crystal's art? I was trying to find that earlier and couldn't get the right combination of keywords I guess. I swear it's in the archive somewhere though.</br>    <br>http://moritatakahiro-waifuuuu.tumb<wbr>lr.com/</wbr></br>  <br>Yes, that's the one.

I couldn't honestly tell you what it is that makes me like it so much; my best guess would be that a lot of magic girl series have a sense of the absurd to them that really appeals to me.</br>  <br>Kind of makes me wish I were a buyfag. I have a real soft spot for Ayumi.</br>  <br>I have a hard spot for her.</br>  Would you play Twister with Yayoi?  <br>I did notice that actually. And I didn't like this episode as much. Very rarely in precure the bad guys go too far for me to enjoy myself. I start to feel actually troubled instead of just excited you know? Made me cry when I saw Nao's face here. Those eyes, man. It's all my fault, I shouldn't have deflected it! One thousand years later, it gets blocked. Even though I know its going to work out because it's a kids show, it's a bit too much for me when they do things like this. I think a lot of viewers probably really like it though.</br>  <br> Hime Hover Hand </br>  <br> I don't like brown people, or warm weather. <br><br>You're missing out, nigger.<br><br>Little brown Cures are the best.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hawaiian <br><br>NO thanks.

At the point I'm at in GoPri it's working perfectly.</br>  I want to engage Towa.  <br>It's admittedly a more flattering profile from the side, but really? Is there more of her later or something?<br><br><br>They really did brush up against something like it in Fresh, where they were clearly good friends, good enough that they didn't need to do a "I'm jealous because she's spending so much time with heeeer" episode, and that was nice.</br></br></br></br>  But not before I go out with her.  <br> but really <br> No, not really. <br> But I do think she's quite fetching. </br></br></br>  <br>I really hate that the thing about three ancient precure went fucking NO WHERE.</br>  <br>I agree, but she's dug in and there isn't a good approach vector. We should wait for reinforcements or bait her into attacking our position.</br>  I don't watch Pretty Cure but I came to post this:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/SnFl787Mr04  [ ]</br>  Cute little throwaway gag. I hope this doesn't mean they'll be doing a combine-power-finisher for all of them. But since there are three artifacts (and two more non-Heart cures to do it with), I guess that's a distinct possibility.<br><br><br>.... ooooor maybe they don't do the other artifacts? That'd be sad.<br><br><br>Yes yes, she's very lovely for a conehead.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where should it have gone?</br>  <br> Oh fuck, I'm sorry I didn't mean to spoil it <br><br>The ancient artifact subplot DOES go somewhere and show up again, it's just those three precure aren't mentioned with the artifacts.<br><br><br>Maybe a little history as to how they got those artifacts or how they used them would be nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> I hope this doesn't mean they'll be doing a combine-power-finisher for all of them. <br><br> That would have been so much better than the constant Royal Straight Flush .</br></br></br>  Cure Empress a cute.

Some of the seasons have it go on for 20-odd episodes, and considering they're some of the longest stocks around, almost anything gets old. To this day I think Heartcatch Orchestra is the only one I actually enjoy sitting through.<br><br>Having to cycle through individual spotlight episodes over and over so that they could use each finisher would be annoying too, though.

The Early Stone Age includes the most basic stone toolkits made by early humans. The Early Stone Age in Africa is equivalent to what is called the Lower Paleolithic in Europe and Asia. <br> The oldest stone tools, known as the Oldowan toolkit, consist of at least: <br> (...) <br> • Sharp stone flakes that were struck from the cores and offer useful cutting edges, along with lots of debris from the process of percussion flaking  <br>That said, depiction of Japanese women in Ukiyo-E paintings show that while they could shave, it was still considered socially acceptable not to.

Since it's also said that she "returns to the villa" I'm guessing it's the latter.

Weirder that it's not actually a jikochuu.<br><br>And funny that they were actually kind of right when they said they could beat the Precure any time they wanted, they just weren't trying.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Leave him alone -roma.</br></br>   world is ending <br> despair <br> suddenly pink <br>You know, fair enough, I suppose this happens every series, but usually it's 20 episodes later. And it feels odder because it's hard to feel like Mana actually grew into this, since she's usually just won because she finally felt like it.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a huge dokifag and even I think that scene was terrible, from conception to execution to contribution to overall context of the show. <br><br>That said you're about to hit a bunch of really good individual episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>Mana doesn't really grow all that much in Doki.<br>She starts the series as the happy prince and ends it as the happy prince. Nothing ever phased her for more than two seconds except Regina getting Aced.</br></br>  <br> she's usually just won because she finally felt like it. <br><br>Thats how precure works though, as long as they have enough friendship and love they will always win.<br>Its not like they need physical training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was the precise point when "Mana sue" became a thing on /pc/ by the way.</br>  Oh, oh wow. I don't know if I've actually seen it before, but this line has taken on quite a different meaning now. That idea that came up yesterday about them granting their whole power to different people would've added an interesting layer to this, but that would require a very different pink, I think.<br><br><br>Well, I actually thought the despair bit was good, but it was pretty easy to see what was going to happen and it's not terribly satisfying (other than giving you the happy ending). It's a nice build-up to what should be an important emotional turn, but this is pretty much exactly the same nature of let-down as Ace.<br><br><br>Sooooort of, but not exactly. Yeah, their power is pretty much only about the will, but I think the expectation is that they learn things about themselves and about the power of love and friendship as they go. Some growths are more massive than others - like Blossom - but if they weren't stronger or more confident, they usually learned something very important about one another that got them through that key moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh shit, badass Bel. That's something I can get excited about.<br><br><br>No surprise there. She's really not completely awful, but the equivalent moment in other series might have been her friends dogpile-grouphugging her, them realizing they still had each other, and turning around that way. Hibiki (and to a lesser extent, Nozomi) took huge strides ahead of their respective teams but still managed to make you feel like they wouldn't be there without them, but Mana feels more like a jaded solo cure in the making.</br></br></br>  Hey, sure, let's see where they go with this Happy Prince thing.<br><br><br>Your comment fits nicely here, I'm actually kind of curious what they would do with it. The actual story is sad, of course, and they won't do that, but that takes a lot of its weight. It's like if they did The Little Mermaid if she survived and lived happily ever afterwards. How shit would that be? She never has to be truly unhappy or anything, but there's not really much sense of sacrifice if she just gets sick once. I guess they could do some sort of horrible martyr story where she actually ends up surviving even though everyone thinks she's gone, but those are awful.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Oh shit, badass Bel. That's something I can get excited about. <br> Hey, sure, let's see where they go with this Happy Prince thing. </br></br></br>  <br>I think that might even be the last time they even mention the happy prince plot point.</br>  Aguri has a point there, I think I agree with her.  What the fuck am I saying?! <br><br><br><br>I love all the awkward replies that come after I mention how I'm looking forward to anything in this series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There isn't much left to say after this episode.</br>  <br>Honestly Aguri is right more often than she's wrong. She's just bad at conveying criticism in a way that's likely to be taken seriously.</br>  Today's Kurumi Erika she gets high on you<br>The space she invades she gets by on you.</br>  <br>The D in Doki is for disappointment.</br>  Doki's overt overall message is that it's okay to be selfish.<br>And that's something I can get behind.</br>  Oh. This is going to happen every episode now?<br><br><br>That's... something, I guess.<br><br><br>So I'm learning. It's actually not that heartcrushing, thankfully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Doki is just the anime version of the sword of truth?</br>  <br>Makopi and Alice are in position</br>  <br>It looks nice when you see it like that, "on paper", but the execution was so sloppy as always in Doki, by the end of the episode you are left with Mana getting instantly (within the same day) better, which makes it look like she wasn't even that ill to begin with and during the whole series the students really do nothing for her, we're just informed by Ugly that "her love was repaid" by them, but it's in fact always Rikka and Charles, and even then it feels like Mana is keeping them around because she like them rather than because she needs them. The students just did their work, after being scolded, for once and that was about it. Truly, Ugly was right and they are just human failures, but they must be human failures so that Mana can look even better in comparison.</br>  <br> Doki's overt overall message is that it's okay to be selfish. <br><br>As long as you are Mana.</br></br></br>  <br>The message was more like "everything will be okay as long as you have Mana on your side, if not, you fucked".</br>  <br> &gt;world is ending <br> &gt;despair <br> &gt;suddenly pink <br>mana.exe</br></br></br></br>    tfw you realize the music in this scene is a remix/arrangement/cover of ganbalance de dance.  <br> lesser cures praying to Mana-sama </br>  <br>GoPri is the secret anniversary season.</br>  <br>It is certainly better than the anniversary season.</br>  <br>HaCha killed Precure.</br>  <br><br>Suteki sugiru!</br></br>    <br>When is Haruharu going to hold hands with Kanata and muse aloud about her lunch for tomorrow?</br>  <br>this includes the transformation theme?</br>  <br>I want Hossh- <br>Hang on a minute.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't want you, she wants sweets</br>  <br>That's not the ost, its the vocal album.</br>  <br>Well, I can't say she doesn't have good  taste </br>  When's the OST?

At least make it 2015/07/23 you idiot  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  I'm staying in this thread until it dies  Glorious final form Yukino is inevitable, it will just be a matter of time.  <br>You mean objectively best girl.</br>   nobody would like a copy pasta.   Remember to keep hydrated, brothers.<br><br>いろはす～</br></br>   no one killing that fucking cunt <br>What happened?</br>  <br>Yukino is best girl. BEST GIRL.</br>  <br>Reminder that Yukino Yukinoshita is objectively best girl.</br>  <br>Threads are way too slow.<br>So I'm done with the cuntkilling, now I just post Irohasu and TL Iroha stuff when they show up.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Coca Cola shill</br>  <br>Reminder that you're objectively wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1. Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pan-san girl a best.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit. Yukinofags are literally Cuckinofags.</br></br>  <br> yui <br>  - even 8man called her a slut <br>  - penguins and fish </br></br></br>  <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>This one is backwards, she was cold towards Yui for placing value on losing her virginity early.</br></br>  <br><br><br>nice samefag</br></br></br>  <br>hey cunt killer, I think you're too hard on the cunt. I had a dream where it was revealed the true nature of the hayato and indeed he is a more miserable individual than anyone in the oregairuverse.<br>probably the one that needs the most love and sympathy of anyone, especially of someone that is his mental equal AKA 8man and not some retard like Tobe or idealizer like Yumiko</br></br>  <br>Yes, someone sweet like Iroha would be perfect for him.</br>  <br>You mean moeblob Yukino.</br>  <br>I think you mean Yui, she is the Y girl after all</br>  <br>Indeed, Iroha would have definitely been a great support for Hayama. He should've said "fuck you" to his group and accept her confession ensuring that he would at least live his own life for a bit. Aside from the issue that he would surely get NTR'd by 8man he would've at least been happy. Funny thing though, if he had to balls to really be himself he wouldn't need Iroha, or anyone for that manner.</br>  <br>why yukino has bulge</br>  <br>Too bad moreblob Yukino is dying soon, Hayama was cucked again by 8man</br>  Brothers?<br><br> I have not forgotten you my brethren. Ch. 2 tl when? </br></br>  <br>Extremely puffy vulva.</br>  <br>Too bad she doesn't love him  romantically . And Miura recently is just trying too hard it might be backfired.</br>  <br> she doesn't love him romantically <br>so she likes him platonically as friends? I didn't know their relationship was that sexual already</br></br>  <br>Haven't been in these threads lately, but I drop by every now and then.<br><br> http://imgur.com/a/VuMzL </br></br></br>  <br>What? There's nothing sexual about it. You said it yourself it's platonic.</br>  When will we see cookie man?  <br>It's just a small crush.<br> Like Yui or Yukino toward 8man </br></br>  <br>I actually finally figured out who the cookieman really is. It took a while be here it is.</br>  <br> Yui <br> Least slutty <br>naaaaah</br></br></br>  <br>I'm Hayama?</br>  <br>You are? Well I'm sorry to say this but that means I'm here to kill you.<br><br>Don't resist, I'll try to make it as quick as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe it.<br>I always knew I was Zaimokuza.</br></br>  <br>Me?</br>  <br>I didn't know Yui liked homeless NEETs with drug problems</br>    <br>I remember you brother. Thanks again for sakicolor.</br>  alone-end when?    <br>She should fuck 8man in front of Yukino<br>I'm sure she wouldn't mind, Yukino only likes him platonically after all<br>Haruno should also say how 8man prefers her over Yukino and talk about how 8man fucks her, that will make Yukino glad that her sister found someone genuine</br></br></br>  What would happened to your dick if yukino turned yandere?  <br>Adorable. It's too bad I don't take sluts.</br>  <br>She would rely on Haruno or Yui to help her do something about it.</br>  <br>A yandere? Well it looks like my work isn't done yet. Fear not citizens, this beast's reign of terror ends now! No more innocent lives will be lost, justice will prevail!</br>   Final scene <br> 8man confesses to Yukino <br> "I-I love you too..." <br> Goes in for a kiss <br> Suddenly stops <br> Yui in the backscreen <br> She has a gun pointed at Yukino <br> Yukino has a hole in her chest <br> Dies, a tear goes down her cheek <br> Helpless 8man stares at the scene, astonished <br> "I love you, Hikki..." <br> Scene ends with a BANG and a black screen <br> "15 years later..." <br> Christmas Cake Yui gets out of jail <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck the yandere out of her</br>  <br> Series ends with an uncensored shot of Yui pooping all over Yukino's grave <br>DEVILISH</br></br>  <br> Guns <br> Japan <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd watch this</br>  <br>If she forcibly rapes 8man my dick would be 11/10</br>  Context: After Haruno teased 8man about being his girlfriend in front of Orimoto, 8man rejected her description of their relationship and this happened:<br><br> “Aw, you’re no fun.” <br><br> After she said that, Haruno made a pouty, sulky face. I was thinking how I’d like to poke those cheeks of hers, but there was no way I could do that and I shrugged my shoulders instead.  <br><br>How do you think she would have reacted if 8man had poked her cheeks? <br>Would 8man still be a virgin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 15 years for double homicide <br>unrealistic</br></br>  <br>That'd be incredibly autistic of him. Maybe he could pull it off he did it in a playful manner, as in adding a retort along with it. But suddenly poking?<br>extremely autistic.</br></br>  All I want is for 8man and Yukino's cynical banter to escalate into wild sex.<br><br>Is that too much to ask?</br></br>  <br>Would new Yukino even continue to insult him?</br>  Posting best doujin  <br>Not in Japan.</br>  <br> During those 15 years 8man happily lived his life out <br> having survived his near fatal encounter he ends up at an hospital <br> Iroha visits him everyday <br>  due to being in the hospital he couldn't graduate on time <br>  spends his final high school year not as Iroha's senpai but as her equal, though Iroha still calls him Senpai </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but it would be much closer to flirting than before</br>  <br> Is that too much to ask? <br>Yes, because Yukino would just lie there as a dead fish. There would be no "wild "sex".</br></br>  <br>8man has dead fish eyes, and women don't need stamina if the guy is dominant</br>  <br>you're confusing "dominant" for "could have just bought an onahole"</br>  What would happen to your dick if orimoto turns yandere and kills every girl around 8man?  <br>No, THIS is best doujin.</br>  <br> dead fish meme <br>Yukino doesn't have the best stamina but that doesn't mean they can't have wild sex before her stamina runs out. She lasted long enough in the tennis match</br></br>  <br>I don't know what you mean by "wild sex" but she'll definitely leave his back with some scratches.</br>  <br>Best fanart, presented by the 8 himself</br>  Why is Hayama the happiest and the most  genuine  when he interacts with Hikitani-kun?  <br> Yui with fangs <br>Fangs only belong on Komachi, off yourself right now</br></br>  <br> single homicide <br><br>I was reading through some mass-murder serial kill shit from Japan, some of these guys clearly had mental problems and had criminal records with time served.<br>These mother fuckers literally got slapped on the wrist for rape, assault, and attempted murder.<br><br>In Japan Yui would probably get sentenced 2 years, then placed into psychiatry ward and released 6 months after it's deemed she's sane.<br>Then she'd go and kill who ever is on 8man's tip a week after.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the judge had any sense he'd let her off without even that much. Serves those bitches right for touching her Hikki.</br>   8man makes a request to the service club <br> Yui and Yukino watch with hopeful, curious eyes anticipating his request <br> "I...I..." <br> Their eyes widen and become teary at the thought. Could this be the next step to deepening their relationship? Becoming something more genuine? <br> "I want to ask for your help. I need to confess my feelings to Saika." <br> The room becomes cold. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How destroyed would Watari's social media be if he went with that route?</br>  <br>Not too bad, as bullshit endings go it would at least be better than Iroha.</br>  <br>He showed them what he wanted.</br>  <br> Hikitani-kun <br>Triggered. I lost it when Ebina suggested dating and then continued saying Hikitani.<br><br>Hikio is miles better.</br></br></br></br>  who /8-manWizardEnd/ here?  <br><br>The gods have made their will known.</br></br>  <br> 8man <br> WizardEnd <br> implying   Yukino won't screw him once then disappear from his life forever. </br></br></br>  <br>If the judge really wanted to dispense justice he'd sentence 8man to 5yrs in a womans prison for not fucking all these girls throwing themselves at him  or until it has been deemed he is rehabilitated.</br>  MAX Coffee  <br>Yukino already has a monopoly on the MAX COFFEE™.</br>  <br>He's taken.<br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's his main supplier, fueling his addiction.</br>  <br>You can deny it all you want but it's the truth.</br>  <br>She gives him coffee so he can fuck his kouhai with excess energy, huh?<br>Yukino is not that bad after all.</br></br>  <br>The grave of this fucking cunt</br>  <br>3/10 for effort, but the one from the guy who actually bought a can of MAX Coffee and a bottle of I Lohas was actually good.</br>  <br>That's a cute fanfiction.</br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way Yukino would keep buying it.</br>  <br>They need their fanfiction since they know it's the closest thing they'll ever get to tasting victory.</br>    <br>Right?<br>Yukino "The Doll" Yukinoshita actually doing something out over own will.<br>Unbelievable</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno makes my dick so hard</br>  <br>How autistic is she?

As a yukinofag myself, I don't know where the rest of the yukinofags are getting their confidence/smugness from. Even spyro, the biggest yukinofag and the "real" primary of the series (since he reads the LNs in their native language), said that a yukino end seems unlikely and that a friendship ends is a lot more plausible after vol. 11.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Her black hair was long and straight, her pale skin seemed to shine, and her delicate limbs were slender and lithe. Her large eyes and alluring lips widened in surprise. <br> The word “godly” fit this girl like a glove. One could also interpret that to mean her beauty could wipe out this earth on a whim. <br><br>Yukiroha is a danger to the universe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Hayama sure is lucky to have a harem even Yukino loves him.</br>  <br>I think they're just having fun.</br>  <br> one guy's opinion means that he's right <br>Yui's own VA said she didn't believe she would win. Not exactly comparable because she's not a primary, but still, a single person's opinion doesn't make a difference at all.</br></br>  <br>Why was Iroha disguised as Yukino kissing Hayama disguised as 8man there?</br>   You'll never be buttfucked by Haruno   <br>So they can pretend to be with the ones they love after getting cucked.</br>  <br> So they can pretend to be with the ones they love <br> Hayama homo for Hikki <br> Iroha yuri for Yukino <br>You sure about that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be "with", not "to be".<br><br>Iroha wants 8man.<br>Hayama wants Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>RIP AND TEAR</br>  <br>spoiler:  It's cookie girl </br>  <br>My dick</br>  <br>so much disguises.

Zombina's never had any color in the manga.</br>  <br>Because the green was a random colored thing made by FwPA or some colorfag. The red is the real color. <br><br> Pic related </br></br></br>  <br> secondary <br>are you people just using that ironically now?</br></br>  <br> implying I would miss out on an opportunity to "experiment" with Suu </br>  <br>Here's the Hex code for her skin, C5CAF2. Go tell me that it isn't primarily blue.</br>  <br>Sorry man I made that last night when I was drunk. I probably couldn't think of anything for her or the lizard</br>  <br>You're gonna need a bigger desk for those maouse pads.</br>  Your favorite two girls are  making out, who are they and wat do?

I'm going to have to teach them who's boss man.    <br> sit with Lala in her room listening to Christian Death and the Sisters of Mercy <br>Y-yes.</br></br>  <br>It's fine, Anon.<br><br>Just wondering.</br></br></br>  I find green girl the most attractive monster<br>Probably because she has the most human looking body </br>  Assumimg 12 eps, endcards would be<br>Lamia<br>Harpy<br>Centaur<br>Slime<br>Mermaid<br>Spider<br>Dragonewt<br>Devil<br>Dryad<br>Dullahan<br>Leaving 2 endcard spots wide open.

He ended up keeping the colors for Manako and the multiple skin colors and eyes of Zombina and went with his own idea for the rest.</br>  <br>probably not going to be subspecies of zombies or dopplers</br>  <br>I wish they handled this part better in the anime, we never got to see sexy Papi belly up close like we did in the first episode.<br><br>Papi tummy best tummy.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyclops: 4 variants of Manako all using their text descriptions to hid their faces.</br>  <br> picking anything but "work in a lab with Suu as your chemical waste disposal unit" <br><br>It's like you faggots don't want to do SCIENCE!</br></br></br>  Ok, looking at the stalker points and how people on 2ch/niconico reacts to MonMusume seems like the adaptation is very popular. If Lerche is going to adapt like 20 chapters of the manga that leaves at least 15 chapters away and if the BD-DVD sales goes well we can think about a second season I guess.  We can all agree Zombie and Fish are worst.  <br>No fish is second best</br>  <br>Considering how well the series is doing I'd say a second season is basically guaranteed.</br>  <br>Murderfish will continue to be worse girl unless something in the newer chapters makes her somehow redeemable.</br>  <br>lets not get cocky</br>  <br>I checked a poll on Nico page and they said Monster Musume is like an Idol franchise.</br>  <br>I love how the print ads for the anime said <br><br>"They said it was a niche! They said it was a minor hit" They said it was only for maniacs! Well, we've sold over a million GNs and now an anime version is confirmed!"<br><br><br>Why? Seriously, Her low-grade insanity aside (they all have it basically), I like her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating on Zombina </br>  <br>Only way she'd redeem herself is if she dies saving the rest of them.</br>  REMINDER<br>8<br>DAYS UNTIL THE FULL MOON.<br>Protect you homes and yourself. Always be prepared. Always be alert.</br></br></br>  <br>is that bad?</br>  <br>But I want to get cocky.</br>  TF are you there? can you please translate or doing a summary of what the VA's said here?  <br>I wonder if a full moon has a greater effect on canine based monstergirls?</br>  <br>I'm still disappointed nothing happened on that Blood Moon we had.</br>  <br>And this one too please.</br>  <br>Zombina is great.</br>  <br>But she can't be worst girl  because Miia is the worst girl. </br>  <br>That means Monster Musume is getting very, very popular and japanfags loves it. If he studio doesn't make an S2 or explode this on OVA's and stuff to sell is because they are retarded.</br>  <br><br>Well, you say she is the SUUperior Waifu</br></br>  <br>Listen here you little spic.</br>  <br>Suu?</br>  <br>how are the bd sales?</br>  <br> crab man's panic goes into overtime when they ask him for a second season </br>  <br>Not me, I find that kind of attitude childish.</br>  <br>I just want to make love to giant Suu.</br>  <br>Non-existent until September.</br>  I'm the only one who can't stop looking at this image? Miia looks so beautiful.  <br>I want to terrorize tokyo with giant suu</br>  <br>We have the stalker points, is on the top 5 of the highest reservations.</br>  <br> ear the same color as her skin </br>  <br>how often do the top five of that get second cours?</br>  <br>Throw monitor in garbage then unless you can unfuck your screen's color.</br>  <br>It really is a beautiful pic.</br>    <br> hating Zombina </br>  <br>is that kojima in the center</br>  <br>Junji gets all the bitches.</br>  <br>Darlings va</br>  <br>Did anyone ever ask Crabman if Miia's name for Darling is inspired by Lum?</br>  <br>So this is what a 3D harem looks like.</br>  <br>Purest of the purest.</br>  <br>I can't wait to get this</br>  So when will the #35 translation be available?  Anyone pre order the BDs from Animate? Ill be using BiJ as a forwarder.  i just realized<br>how is darling still alive after a full moon with all seven of the girls around<br>does he have like a secret man cave<br> "break in case of heat" </br></br></br>  <br> not posting Crabman's interview too </br>  <br>I preordered the one from tora but I might just get both. That Rach poster is too good</br>  So are we getting Polt?  <br>Just translate this one</br>  <br>READ<br>THE<br>FUCKING<br>MANGA</br></br></br></br>  <br>I summarized it yesterday, and TF did a page-by-page summary last thread.<br><br>Want the summary again?</br></br></br>  <br>Just let the faggots learn to use the archive anon.</br>  <br>for the last time NO</br>  <br>Roshi blew up the moon</br>  <br>picture of crabman fucking when?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>Darling just makes them all go to bed early.<br><br>Probably has to lock up Suu though. Doubt she sleeps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm all caught up you dumb autist.<br>It's been like well over eight months since I started reading it monthly like the rest of ya'll.</br></br>  How does one mate with Suu?  <br>Just put it in anywhere you want</br>  I have no idea why I'm enjoying this series so much.  <br>just stick your dick anywhere into her</br>  <br><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traum<wbr>atic_insemination<br><br><br>I don't even think I could do that. It'd just be copy/paste.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>all frames in that part of the OP are a miracle of the universe</br></br>  <br> Lying about reading something <br> Being this retarded secondary <br><br>Stop trying to fit here faggot, if you really read the manga you would know how Darling avoids death every time. <br><br>Now fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except suu has no internal organs or anything and is amorphous</br>  <br> 11 females <br> Miia, Cerea, Papi, Suu, Mero, Rachnee, Smith, Tio, Zombina, Manako, Doppel. <br> no Lala <br>my smile and optimism: gone</br></br></br></br>  <br> do you really think i was being genuine with my question; did the lack of punctuation and non-sequitur writing style not tip you off<br>You have my condolences. </br> </br>  <br>I think he knows that Darling avoids death every time, yeah.<br>I just think maybe we should see that in a chapter.<br>We know he survived having 3 horny girls in his house once. Let's see him do it again with 7.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it's the same retard calling everyone a secondary if something upsets him</br>  <br> not able to make a decent argument <br> I-I was pretending! <br><br>C´mon retard, can you be more pathetic?</br></br></br></br>  Would Rachnera get upset / give you a weird look for squashing a household spider?  <br>No because she's not a spider</br>  <br>Nigger, the answer is simple.<br><br>  He survives thanks to Lala, who was actually stalking him all the time. That was explained long ago but animeonlyfags doesn't know that and instead of reading the manga they just come here and throw retarded questions. </br></br></br>  Daily reminder that you cannot come up with possible scenarios that deviate an inch from the source material, just for the sake of some interesting point/talk/discussion/fun/possibili<wbr>ty/etc without being called secondary, this is serious business.</wbr>  <br><br>Read the OP retards, you're not allowed here.</br></br>  <br>She'd probably kill it first, spiders can be pretty territorial.</br>  <br>Spiders regularly eat other spiders. They have little care for each other even when it could be a potential mate.</br>  <br> Catches a spider in her web. <br> Awkward face. </br></br>  <br>well, she gets kinda touchy about how her looks scare humans, and killing a fucking spider for no good reason might be a little upseting for reminding her of that fact.</br>  Give me your best images of Tio  <br>her limbs are far too skinny</br>  <br>Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her.<br><br>I don't think we've seen a full moon since the first one, but assuming things have been going on long enough for a second to have happened, it's probably safe to go with 'everybody goes to bed early that night'.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask Hound for that, but since he becomes a boring faggot I think he's not able to do that anymore.</br>  <br> Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her. <br><br>It's retarded Lalafag headcanon</br></br></br>  <br>You too have my pity anon for not being able to diffrentiate the genuine from the facetious.</br>  <br>Lala was a little tsun about that, you can notice the reaction and how she blushes when she said that.</br>    <br>I almost feel like you made that yourself.<br>Just chill, man.<br>If a question is easy to answer, it's easy to answer.<br>If it's complicated, yes, you can tell somebody to read the manga to find out, because it'd take too long to explain.<br>I think the main rule to have is to <br> JUST<br> TAKE IT EASY. </br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather get sweaty all over and let Suu do as she pleases.</br>  <br>anon the manga already went over the issue<br>papi has no problem eating poultry, <br>mero has no problem eating fish<br>they simply do not see these things any more similar than a human a rat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or carryover headcanon from the orginal comics</br>  <br>try reading the mang<br>a before posting</br></br>  <br/>  Is Lala purple or that tint is used just to convey she's really pale?  <br>Not the same anon but someone explain that pretty well the last thread.<br><br>The deal with secondaries is how they come to these threads and start asking things they can easily get from reading the manga, even in one day you can rush all the 34 chapters translated but they don't do that, instead of that they go full rampage and start a chain of shitpost every single time or even create new threads talking shit about MonMusume because they get BTFO from here. <br><br>The hate against secondaries is very justified, try to check Jitsu or GATE threads as a good example of what I'm talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Seems pretty clear she's not keeping him alive from where I sit. Or did you think he was saying that her NOT saving him is retarded lalafag headcanon?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Congratulations, you're retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but in those cases you can justify it because they're food. In the other situation you're killing it because you're grossed out. Hence why she would feel weird about it because she shares similar traits. But most likely it's a non issue, but it's fun to speculate I guess</br>  <br>This fucking guy.</br>  <br><br>The original post quoted the passage saying Lala doesn't help him, followed by saying that it's retarded Lalafag headcannon</br></br>    <br>Okay, so you misunderstood him. To me, at least, it seems pretty clear he was saying 'Lala saves his every time' is retarded lalafag headcanon.</br>  His quarry will never be settled  Isn't this the giant that Swallow cuts in half?  RIP in pieces golem bro  ;_; <br><br>The Red Dragon was too jelly of your superior CGI.</br></br>  Eykha &gt; Meryl &gt; Happy Merchant &gt; Lou   https://d.maxfile.ro/jveqdgjshc.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br>Onii-chan no ecchi!!! <br>On a scale of 1 to 10, how lewd was this OVA for you?</br></br>  <br>that leg subbing that everything</br>  I like FSN more for several reasons. <br>First is the fact that major characters even besides Shirou still have some character development. Even if they don't have much spotlight or detailed backstory, they still act differently each route and we can understand their logic. Each major character also reaches some kind of conclusion, like Lancer,Caster or Fake assasin. Compared to this characters in Fate/Zero are much more static. They have pretty much predefined roles and don't act outside of them. Story does not answer important questions concerning conclusions for characters, like how Gil changed from being somewhat reasonable to the way he was in FSN, or how Kiritsugu managed to regain his faith in ideals after final breakdown. There are implications, but no clear answers. For a work with such good cast F/Z does much worse job in displaying changes in character.<br><br>Second reason is actual war and actions of the participants. In FSN each "faction" tried their best to find the most effective strategy to deal with opponents. Even if everyone was an amateur or just a kid, Nasu put some thought in their actions outside of battles. Compared to this Tokiomi, Kariya, Kayneth left everything to their Servants and expected to win effortlessly against any enemy Magi. I expected much more of them as they don't have an excuse of being a kid or being unprepared.<br>Even Kiritsugu's actions are questionable. He wants to fight dirty by killing all masters, and yet he summons most honourable servant. He still tries to kill all masters, without regard that servants can still find different master or just have independent action. No one mentions that killing Ryunoske before dealing with Caster was probably his biggest mistake. For a professional he has very crude methods.<br>So overall Fate/Zero is good but FSN still has some merits that Zero pretty much omits</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing that's not Julian or his Papa pretending to be him?</br>  <br>We're talking about magical lesbian lolis here, not Zero.</br>  This show is borderline hentai<br>What the shit</br>  Crystal may be over  for now , but we can always have a Sailor Moon thread.  New episode later thread.<br><br>Hamilton a cute.</br></br>  <br>Actually the Empire just didn't want to loose more troops as they lost their military advantage when they got wiped out at Ginza, they knew they couldn't beat the JSDF, they gathered the allies and sent them to their deaths so they would also loose their military to the JSDF.<br><br>That's why the empire didn't show up during the slaughter of the allied empires.</br></br></br>  <br> he didn't watch GuP </br>  <br>Well, the vassals lost 120k from 300k and almost all nobility, including kings.<br>Either way it was good for Emperor.</br></br>  <br><br>the claw marks are obviously by persia, he probably fell on her after he got slapped by bozes and ended up grabbing boobies.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually the Emperor still had troops but he didn't send them because he wanted to get rid of his enemies.</br></br></blockquote>]
