What does /a/ think of Charlotte, AOTS?  <br>Dropped it after the first episode. I liked the first 12 or so minutes, but by the end I could tell I would not like the plot going forward.</br>  <br>they make a fool of him; he got his ass kicked, lost any chance to get the bitch and got expelled (actually just transferred) from a prestigious school where he was respected by everyone.<br><br> where he's going to fuck his student council harem and instigate forced drama. <br>hopefully not, we will see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is LiSA in it?</br>  <br>Cuck is no longer chan exclusive.

It can get much worse.</br>  Umineko has shit art anyway. Thank god they're changing it.  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>Tech doesn't, and there are strong periods of regression. The space in between was marked by barbarian incursion, fracturing of the old empire, wars, black death, and generally a lot of suffering and shit. I don't see it in the setting though. If they had the economic and social infrastructure as well as cultural background to produce the kind of royalty as described, then by all rights development should have been rapid.</br>  <br>Read the prologue to the 1st volume.</br>  <br>See, this is the issue. Any discussion would necessitate spoilers.</br>  <br>me on the left</br>  <br>I didn't know anything about this before starting watching. I cannot believe how good this first episode was, specially the direction and the score, plus really well animated, and the characters for the moment seem great.<br><br>I never jump to this AOTS, but if this continue this way is probably going to be the case.</br></br></br>  No one hyped for Overlord? It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> 2 days left </br></br></br></br>   inverse sao clone <br> mc and his harem are the evil guys <br> mc and his harem hunt down humans <br><br>I think we got ourselves the AOTS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't even read fucking manga, get the hell out you shitter.</br>  The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game which is quietly shut down on its last day. Our protagonist Momonga decided to stay until the last moment in his beloved game and wait for the force logout. Unexpectedly, the server did not shut down and Momonga is stuck in his skeleton body and got transferred to another world. "The powerful Overlord" needs now to discover a new world and face the continuous challenges. <br><br>Having no parents, friends, or place in society, this ordinary man strives to take over the new world the game has become.<br><br> people denying this is not SAO 2.5 </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>MMO is only like first half of first chapter in Novel, then its just fantasy with some references to original game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what else had potential until about an episode or two episodes in?<br> SAO </br></br>   Durarara x2 Ten air day <br> no thread <br><br>Come on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a masochist.</br>  <br><br>He really was enjoying the situation:<br><br>  Izaya's heart was fluttering with excitement, like that of a child on the day before an excursion. <br>  The injury to his stomach throbbed in sync with his rising heartbeat, but even that pain was only serving to spice up the situation even further for him right now. </br></br></br></br></br>  This episode just proved that Izaya is fucking insane.  I really loved how they showed flashes of what everyone else was doing, just as Kadota said that world balances out. Though I can't shake the feeling a fuckton was skipped because of it, it was still a great scene in my opinion.  <br>liking a horrible adaption series to a LN that shares the same world as baccano!</br>  Are they really a lesbian couple. Or the girls just can't have boyfriends because it would anger those who have them as waifus?  <br><br>You don't even watch this show, so why are you even in this thread?<br>Go back to your UFO thread or /pol/ and troll there until mods finally ban you.</br></br></br>  <br>Highly likely I will watch the show in the future cause the actiony bits look pretty cool.</br>  <br><br>Ah, so your problem with yuri really can be boiled down to "homos are icky". I realize /a/ is the last place I should give people the benefit of the doubt, but really?

Opinions?  <br>She should have won the Yuutabowl. Her interaction with Yuuta was much more interesting than Rikka's.</br>  <br>But Rikka was slated to win, and I think Mori Summer is better off with Deko.</br>  <br> But Rikka was slated to win <br>Which is why I said "should have".<br><br> I think Mori Summer is better off with Deko. <br>No, that's boring.</br></br></br></br></br>  She is blessed.  <br> boring <br>That's your opinion which I disagree with.
