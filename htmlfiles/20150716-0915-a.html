[ You're waifu is cute and I hope you have a nice lifetime together.<br><br>Does your waifu watch anime/read manga? If so, does she have any specific genres she likes?</br></br>  <br>I don't have a waifu</br>  <br>She likes shoujo manga a bunch.<br><br>But that's about it. The romance is better between Yunocchi and I anyway!</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP!<br><br>She enjoys reading manga and actual books as well. There is actually quite the selection of reading material at her friends' "base". Not sure on what genres she prefers though.</br></br></br>  <br> Does your waifu watch anime/read manga? If so, does she have any specific genres she likes? <br>I think she would enjoy anime or manga. She rather wouldn't be an anime/manga otaku, but she should enjoy entry level stuff.<br>I think she might like romance and music related things.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, OP.<br><br>She's only seen using her TV to play videogames, and she doesn't read much, outside of magazines and school textbooks. Having said that, I could see her potentially getting into an action-oriented series, if she ever started.<br><br>What does you're waifu commonly wear during the summer months? Is there anything you'd like to see her try on?<br>Kagura normally wears shorts and a t-shirt/tanktop.  I'd love to see her wear a skirt, outside of her school uniform, or summer dress. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: generic sluts  <br>you're itt</br>  <br>Mai is never shown watching anime or reading manga. I do not think that these are available to her at all.<br><br>In the summer she wears her summer school uniform, shorts and a tanktop or a bikini.</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't.</br>  Has your waifu ever interacted with her past self or with a representation of it? If not, how do you think that such an encounter would go?<br><br>(Mai did the latter when she was reflecting on and struggling over her identity. It went well, and she was able to make peace with who she is.)</br></br>  <br>Nah, don't sell yourself short, pal.<br><br>You're a tremendous slut.</br></br></br>  I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  Is your waifu happy with the size of her breasts? What do you think of them?  <br>Thanks! I do too.<br><br>I don't think she has done either, and she doesn't really read that much.<br><br><br>A summer dress would be nice.<br><br><br>She doesn't have any problems with them.<br>I think they're perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  slowest waifu thread fivever<br><br><br>she envies no woman, her confidence is too high for that</br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu a cute too.<br><br>She likes manga/anime that are adaptations of vidya, but i could give her some reccomendations.<br><br>She would wear a skirt or some shorts if we would go on a trip.<br><br>But if we're on a date, then some light dress, those made for summer.<br><br> ITT: good waifus <br>ftfy<br><br>Considering she is around 17 yrs, it wouldn't be much trouble.<br>She would just ask herself why she is here.<br><br>I want to kiss my waifu on her  midriff <br><br>She is a bit shy about it.<br> Her breasts aren't the reason why i fell in love with her but they are nice, since we can do some other lewd things together <br> Also very helpful to feed our children <br><br>Would your waifu drink beer?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not anime/manga, specifically. She's a voracious reader, though.<br><br>Something simple but not too revealing, probably.<br><br>Well, her past had a lot of pain and misery for her. I think she'd try to tell herself that it gets better, but she has to try.<br><br>Yes, she doesn't have any problems.<br><br>Well, she did drink wine once. She can't HD her liquor very well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, nothing's ever shown about her life before her first year of high school.<br><br><br>I think she's okay with them, despite Tomo's constant teasing about her womanly figure.<br>Personally I think they're  miracles of the universe. <br><br><br>I could see her trying it, out of curiosity. It's not something she'd do on a regular basis, that's for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you OP, it's my aim to do so.<br><br>Erica reads books but no manga in particular.<br><br><br>A vest and pantsu, sometimes even less. Nice and breezy! There's nothing specific that I'd like to see her wearing due to the wide variety available in fan art.<br><br><br>Nope. It would be very weird but also fascinating, although that could apply to anybody meeting their past self. I think she would use the opportunity for mischief, if anything.<br><br><br>Yes, for the most part. She has only exhibited boob envy for one girl (Hanna), while being secure about her body around anyone else. I love her petite bust as it falls well within my preferred size range, a.k.a. built for speed!<br><br><br>Absolutely. She prefers spirits or wine though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, she is indeed a qt.<br><br>Misao does watch anime/reads manga, so far seems like she likes action stuff and some SoL.<br><br><br>Uh no, could see it being very awkard.<br><br><br>She is, she has her breasts, and i freaking love them.<br><br><br>Maybe, i'm sure she would try out of curiosity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd have to ask her creator because she's a fictional character</br>  <br>She dodges those mediums as they are childish to her. It's a black and white point of view, but it's how she is with most things anyway.<br><br>Regulations force her to wear her uniform at all times, barring phys ed. Wouldn't mind seeing hot pants coupled with a spaghetti strap top during the summer time.<br><br>She doesn't care. As for me, her flatness is still hypnotizing to me to this day.<br><br> beer <br>I just can't see it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What is your ideal date with your waifu?  <br>dinner, then going home and banging maniacally like rabbits in heat</br>   Does your waifu watch anime/read manga? <br>She is hardcore otaku.</br>  <br> Does your waifu watch anime/read manga? If so, does she have any specific genres she likes? <br>She doesn't.<br><br>  Is there anything you'd like to see her try on? <br>Pic related. It has grown on me.<br><br> Has your waifu ever interacted with her past self or with a representation of it? If not, how do you think that such an encounter would go? <br>No and I think that it would be interesting to say the least.<br><br>No problems with them. I think they're perfect for her.<br><br> Would your waifu drink beer? <br>I can see her drinking it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/URU2jjyK<br><br><br>She doesn't like to admit to it, but she seems fond of mecha to a certain degree. Wouldn't mind getting into a discussion with her regarding certain series, though.<br><br>She likes to keep cool for the most part, but it varies. If she wants to look pretty, then she can pull a summer dress pretty good. At the same time, she looks pretty comfy in shorts too. And that's before getting into her swimming attire...<br><br>Only in artwork and song.<br><br>She does get irritated at times, but only because of the attention she gets because of their size. From both men and women, no less. At the risk of getting stabbed with a fork, I find them quite lovely.  ...and that I wish to nestle between them. <br><br>She has on occasion. She gets quite...touchy-feely if she has too much, though.<br><br>A nice night out to her favorite restaurant, and/or a trip to a nice movie, followed by some alone time between the two of us.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he hasn't spoken to her creator </br>  <br>Mai doesn't seem to be particularly concerned with the size of her breasts, though some of her less endowed friends are jealous of her. I think that they're the perfect size.<br><br>We don't see Mai drink alcohol. I guess she might avoid it due to being underage.</br></br></br>  <br> What is your ideal date with your waifu? <br>Probably a movie or a walk in a park.</br></br>  <br>Thank you, OP. <br><br>Don't think so, no, on account of probably having no exposure to the stuff. I like to think he'd enjoy comfy SoL series.<br><br> <br>The same robe he always wears, evidently. He did wear a cute polo shirt in one of the promo arts, which I think looks pretty good on him. Pic related. <br><br>There's not any specific summer-y clothes I'd like to see him in  (aside from a Speedo, which I got a very cutelewd drawing of recently) , just more casual outfits in general.<br><br><br>Sort of. He didn't exactly interact with himself, but his exchange with Maka in his inner world really opened the door to a new life for him. <br><br><br>So do I. People say the noses in SE look weird (which they kinda do), but I think my husbando's is really cute. <br><br><br>I know Crona isn't too happy with his figure overall, but I love it! He's fine just the way he is.<br><br><br>Contrary to the Corona pun-related images out there, I doubt it. Maybe, maybe once or twice to try it. <br><br><br>Dinner and a movie, getting home before 8:30 :^)<br><br>Jokes aside (although that wouldn't be too bad of a date), we'd go walking somewhere -maybe at the mall, maybe around the lake(s)-  holding hands  and talking, just doing that typical lovey-dovey couples stuff, enjoying eachother's company. Then we'd have a light dinner at a restaurant nearby (I'd cover the tab, being the chivalrous gentleman I am), then head home for some cuddling, and possibly lewd. <br><br>Nothing fancy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A dinner and a quiet restaurant, a movie, and then a peaceful walk in a park together.</br>  <br> Nice to see you in the threads again, if you're who I think you are. Welcome back! <br><br><br>I'd say going to a beach or water park, or going to an arcade with her would be a lot of fun. Just spending time with her in general would be amazing, really.<br><br><br> Azuma did a signing a few months ago <br> in Japan <br>Maybe some day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I hope you do to.<br>She does read books but I don't know how often.<br>I assume a far amount as she is quite smart.<br><br>I've seen her in a summer dress, every one looks good in a summer dress. I'm not to fussed when it come to what she wears.<br><br>Shes not happy, at all. She wishes for far bigger boobs. Personally I think any bigger would just make her top heavy.<br><br>She would drink it once, get drunk and during the hangover she would regret everything, she hates mornings enough as it is, she would never ever drink again.<br><br>A nice meal with a huge dessert only to go home to relax and end up falling asleep together.<br><br>Whats your waifu's biggest flaw, if she has one that is?<br>Her most evident flaw is what I love about her, her grumpiness and sleepiness.<br>If I had to chose something to get her to improve upon it would be her lack of communication. She never seems to talk to anyone about how she's feeling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't claim to have gone to Japan. Mine came to Vegas for a con recently.  I was nervous forgot to ask her birthday. </br>  <br> Has your waifu ever interacted with her past self or with a representation of it? <br>No<br><br><br>I guess not. However they are absolutely perfect for me. Large enough to be soft and nice to fondle but small enough to look cute and innocent.<br><br><br>No.<br><br><br>First we would go to the beach, play in water, sunbathe, walk around. When it gets a little cold, we would go find some place to eat, preferably casual restaurant. Then we would go back to some place at the beach where we could be alone and look at sunset while holding hands, kissing and whispering sweet nothings. It would be nice if we would stay until stars show up and stargaze. If I've not done that before, it would be wonderful occasion to propose to her, obviously with genuflection.<br><br><br>Sundress.<br><br><br>Shyness, timidness.<br>They make her even more perfect for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hello everybody.<br><br><br>She likes the horror genre and prefers to read<br><br><br>I don't think she is but I'm fine with them tbh<br><br><br>I don't think so, I think she prefers wine.<br><br><br>Going to a expensive Casino.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yomiko's seen reading a manga volume in the R.O.D manga at one point but I don't know if she has a power level or anything, The Paper's talk about Urusei Yatsura at one point so they'd probably enjoy manga more.<br><br><br><br>I doubt Yomiko changes into anything other than her scholarly outfit which she normally wears, I'd love to see her in a bikini especially if we go somewhere like the beach.<br><br><br><br> Has your waifu ever interacted with her past self or with a representation of it? If not, how do you think that such an encounter would go? <br><br>They'd talk nonstop about books and which ones they should read, would be a funny sight.<br><br><br><br>I think she might be a little oblivious to them but she doesn't seem to mind them at all,  I absolutely adore them, perfect for using as a pillow too <br><br><br><br>Probably more of a coffee or tea person, I think it'd be interesting to see what Yomiko would be like drinking but I don't think she'd do such a thing.<br><br><br><br>We head to the bookshop, we both browse through the rows upon rows of books then I buy whatever she picks out, afterwards we get coffee to take out then head to the library and discuss lots of things, as it draws to an end we take a walk through the park where rest on a bench there I will rest my head on Yomiko's lap as she reads me some Byron, Shakespeare sonnets or Rimbaud. We head home after that and indulge in some love passionate love making.<br><br><br><br>Yomiko's has too much of a good nature and is a little trusting of others but her Biblomania is also her biggest strength and biggest weakness.<br><br>Did your waifu awaken any fetishes within you after you met her? For me it was megane, never really used to like glasses on girls but I've slowly grown to love them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did your waifu awaken any fetishes within you after you met her? For me it was megane, never really used to like glasses on girls but I've slowly grown to love them. <br>I have grown to love tomboys.</br></br>  Do you defend your waifu over the internet?<br><br>I myself think it's amusing to see a lot of people getting salty over her.</br></br>  <br>Thank you<br><br><br>Misao is too childish, something that i find very qt but others find kinda annoying.<br><br><br>Schoolgirl Uniform, short brown hair, FANG, genki girls.<br><br><br>Yes, i've derailed threads because of it sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why thank you OP, you have a cute waifu too and I wish the same for both of you.<br><br>I'm pretty sure she does, but I'm not sure. Maybe I could get her into my favorite genres like mecha and action adventure. <br><br><br>She usually wears her normal outfit, her bikini, and usually whatever she feels like wearing. <br><br><br>No<br><br><br> I want to kiss her all over her body. <br><br><br>I'm sure she is, and I'm perfectly happy with them too. <br><br><br>Yeah, but probably only on special occasions. <br><br><br>A nice walk through the park or city. Then when we get home we can have some fun together. <br><br><br>There's nothing wrong with her in my heart. She's perfect to me and always will be. But if I had to point one thing out is that she has a very hard time waking up in the morning, so that could be improved on. <br><br><br>I love her headphones. <br><br><br>yes<br><br>Does your waifu have any pets? If so how many. And if she doesn't have pets, would she want one? Sonico has about 4-6 cats I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her aloof nature. She's a difficult person to read, at least in my opinion. I find that I'm terrible when it comes to reading others.  Took a test where what I thought were angry/disappointed eyes were actually eyes signalling lust/affection  While I have my own reasons for keeping to myself, I can only begin to speculate why she does the same. I can only hope that she'll eventually trust me enough to open up to me at least every now and then.<br><br><br>Fingers. Definitely fingers.  The first dream I ever had of her involved me pressing sensual kisses along the length of her fingers. Made strange by the fact that she was dressed as her Seven Sins character, who just stabbed several people to death. <br><br><br>I know I should, but considering the nature of her material, there really is no need. I just take solace in the fact that her hatred of the fanbase gets more and more justified.<br><br><br>Just one. And it is adorable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would invite her to walk on the park, then we get near the store and buy some new vidya. After that we would go eat something fancy and then go home and talk about we did today.<br>Then the lewd starts and we make love all night.<br><br> pastebin <br>That was so romantic to read.<br> I'm blushing so hard and my heart is skipping fast. It's amazing. <br><br>She got an amazing strength from her mother, and i know she would be twice as strong as me, and that's good. But what i would want to improve is that i want her to be the best she can be and be more secure, because she is an amazing girl with lots of potential.<br>Like i always say:<br> You don't know how good you can be, until someone tells you how good you are. <br><br>Well.<br> I'm a man so obviously i love her breasts, but now my dominant fetish is waist figure and midriffs, but i still love her womanly figure, like her hips and legs too.  <br><br>I do, especially on the D-frag threads.<br><br>She doesn't have any mascot.<br>But i like dogs, so we can adopt one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt she does<br><br>yep</br></br></br>  <br> Whats your waifu's biggest flaw, if she has one that is? <br>Rage and how stubborn she can be.</br></br>  <br>His susceptibility to his mother's threats and intimidation is definitely his biggest flaw, but it's a learned one. I'd say his second biggest issue is his utter lack of self worth, and that's something I really want to help him to change.<br><br><br>Nothing in particular. I have grown to love every single inch of his body though.  And my interest in omo has only increased. <br><br><br>I'd like to start, but I still can't help but see it as a waste of time. Fighting against a tidal wave of stupidity, basically. <br><br><br>No. His last encounter with a cute small animal did not end well. If we were to get a pet, we'd have to sit down and discuss it first, make sure he can  deal with  it and all.  Cats are awesome, you're waifu has great taste in pets. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai had difficulty opening herself to others due to her father keeping her isolated and teaching her that she shouldn't trust others as well as eventually casting her out. Because of that she feared that others would reject her if she opened herself. Though by the end of her manga she was able to overcome this issue and gain the acceptance of her friends.<br><br>I guess that Mai made me like somewhat bigger breasts than I had before discovering her.<br><br>Yes. Some people like to insult or spread misinformation about Mai, so I will try to present the truth so that her image isn't tarnished to those who are unfamiliar with her.<br><br>Mai has no pets and she doesn't seem interested in animals like some of her friends are. I don't think she'd want to have any.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her self loathing and anxiety. I want her to be happy and confident about being the amazing, beautiful girl she is.<br><br>Long, dark hair.<br><br>I think she'd like a cat, although I could see her with a dog as well. Any loving and cute animal, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, I hope so too.<br>She probably doesn't have time to watch a bunch of stuff, but I could see her watching /m/ shit.<br><br><br>She either wears her Enforcer suit or something with a skirt. She looks cute in anything.<br><br><br>If you count Alicia as her past self.<br><br><br>She's fine with them. I think they're fine.<br><br><br>She would probably try it.<br><br><br>Going to a nice restaurant and coming back to spend the rest of the night together.<br><br><br>When she's determined to help someone she sometimes goes in without thinking about herself.<br><br><br>Twintails, thighhighs, and capes.<br><br><br>I wouldn't really consider Alph a pet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's you're waifu's favorite season?  <br>She does! While her favorite is Stardust Witch Meruru, she seems to have watched a few other series. Her favorite genre is mahou shoujo, or really anything moe that includes imouto characters.<br><br>Kiririn is a girl who doesn't let the hot summer days stop her from looking fashionable!<br>Her summer attire usually includes tanktops/regular tops and short skirts/shorts, but she wears dresses sometimes as well.<br>I'd really like to see her in a lolita dress, even though that's more of Ruri's thing.<br><br>She doesn't seem to show any real opinion on them. I think they're absolutely perfect, just like every part of her!<br><br>Maybe later in life she'd go out for a drink with friends, but I can't really see her drinking beer.<br><br>Shopping deito to Akiba or Shibuya 109, spending lots of money on each other and then ending it with a nice dinner and  cuddles at home. <br><br>She has a short temper and can be quite arrogant and stubborn at times, but those flaws make her who she is and I find them endearing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to link to  to answer<br> Does your waifu have any pets? If so how many. And if she doesn't have pets, would she want one? <br>Nope. No pets. I think maybe a cat is what she'd go for.</br></br></br>  Are there any awful youtube videos featuring your waifu?  <br>She's not the sharpest tool in the shed, shall we say.<br><br><br>It's okay, I'm sure I'd be a nervous wreck if I ever met him as well, or her VA.  I doubt Azuma would answer my questions about her anyway. <br><br><br>I wasn't a fan of tanlines before I met her, now I love them.<br><br><br> that picture <br> Plz. <br><br><br>I feel it'd be a waste of energy. The general opinion of her is quite positive anyway,  albeit sometimes a bit depraved,  so there's no real need to do so.<br><br><br>She doesn't. She'd most likely be a dog person, knowing how she treats cats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the same outfit she always wears<br><br>I'm sure she is content with them. I know I am<br><br>she is flawless<br><br>None</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Deer season<br><br><br>"Upotte! Masturbation Scene"<br><br><br>she has me<br><br><br>of course<br><br><br>bondage and femdom</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How polite is your waifu?<br><br>(I'd say that Mai is very polite. She's respectful and helpful towards others and she will readily apologize if she inadvertently offends someone.)</br></br>  <br>I don't think she dislikes either, but I don't think anything was specified, or it's just not coming to mind.<br>That said, she might have an interest mech/robot anime/manga, and action.<br><br><br>Just her normal sailor outfit, though in some official art(albeit not in the game), she wears a summer dress, and I think she has other clothes but is just shown with that one.<br><br><br>I don't think she has, and I have no idea how it'd go really.<br><br><br>As far as I know, she's fine with it. I find it cute.<br><br><br>I don't know, leaning on the "probably not" side.<br><br><br>Can't really say. One seems the more ideal at first, then another seems really nice.<br><br><br>Eh, I'm not sure. There's a few flaws(Was fairly depressed and continued to stay in a pretty down mood for a long while, perhaps a bit naive(?)), so I can't really say.<br><br><br>Not exactly. Perhaps imouto-like characters since she's such a sweet girl, and the "onii-chan" is too much to handle.<br>Striped underwear/legwear.<br><br><br>I really don't give a shit what some retard over the internet says, unless he says it directly to me. I don't waste my time with scum.<br><br><br>Almost every video.<br><br><br>Nepgear is pretty polite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No pets.<br><br><br>Summer!<br><br><br>More than i'd like to know.<br><br><br>Very polite, she is a nice and honest person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't have any ideals in mind for our dates, as we like our lazy nights in. To keep dates fresh and fun, we mostly improvise but I'll also have a backup plan in mind.<br><br><br>Objectively, her laziness. We share that trait and I love her for it.<br><br><br>Femdom and  CBT. <br><br><br>Only if the confrontation somehow involves me. I can't be bothered otherwise. The time is better spent with her.<br><br><br>None. She likes animals though.<br><br><br>Spring!<br><br><br>Probably. I don't seek that stuff out.<br><br><br>Erica has decent manners but she's very casual and easygoing. Never obnoxious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say winter.<br><br>Probably, but I don't care enough to acknowledge their existence. <br><br>She very much doesn't like talking to people she doesn't know, but she's standardly polite for a Japanese teenager when doing so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's very polite and friendly.<br><br><br>Yup, she's in love with the cats,  even though I'm more of a dog person. </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br><br>Her standard wear, but she has an umbrella to keep the sun off of her.<br><br><br>Aside from a  nightmare , no.<br><br><br>That sounds like a really cute idea!<br><br><br>She's quite pleased with them,  as am I .<br><br><br>She might try it, but I'm not sure she would enjoy the taste. She likes sweeter things.<br><br><br>Just finding a quiet spot to chill out and be together in peace.<br><br><br>She's a little...clingy, I suppose. She definitely likes to keep an eye on the people she cares about, if you know what I mean. She can also be a bit too direct at times, although I personally find both of these traits endearing.<br><br><br>I'm far too romantically shy for those sorts of things, but I suppose maybe  big sweaters  and  shoulders .<br><br><br>She doesn't, but I could see her liking something small and cute, like a rabbit. Well, a smaller rabbit anyway.<br><br><br>Winter, easily.<br><br><br>Probably. I don't want to know.<br><br><br>It very much depends on who she's talking to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sleeping and highthighs.<br>She doesn't wear highthighs but her friend does and I tought how good she would look in highthighs.<br><br>No one has straight up insulted her but if they did I would defend her.  Because I'm a faggot <br><br>She has no buts but I think she would get along with a cat. If we lived together we would definitely have a cat.<br><br>Winter as the days or shorter.<br><br>I haven't found any yet, luckily. There probably are some.<br><br>Shes ruse and very blunt. She just likes to say it how it is. Although she will apologize to the people she cares about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she isnt</br>  <br>she is polite<br><br>I think it's time to post swimsuits</br></br></br>  <br>Chihiro loves manga! Specifically of the shoujo variety. Her favorite is called "The Persimmon Tree Left Behind!"<br><br><br>School Uniform. I'd like to see her wear a Yukata to the summer festival!<br><br><br>Chihiro doesn't make any comments on her breasts, but I think  they're just the right size <br><br><br>Not likely.<br><br><br>Just being with her, talking to her, and holding her, really.<br><br><br>I used to, but then I realized those who go after her do it to get a reaction out of me, so I stopped. For those that simply don't like her, I just respect that their tastes are different and move on.<br><br><br>No pets, but she likes cats.<br><br><br>Unknown, but if I had to guess, Autumn.<br><br><br>Chihiro is fairly polite.<br><br>Do you have a favorite line of you're waifu's? My favorite from Chihiro's is<br><br>"So please, for this moment, think only of me." When I first heard her say that, my face was flushed!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Ok~<br><br><br>Her whole 3 second rule shenanigans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>best team. I don't even need to say anything else.</br>  <br>Thanks OP, your waifu a super cute as well!<br>As to your question, I'm not sure if anime exists in her world, but judging by her tastes in books, she may like ecchi anime.<br><br><br>She's rarely seen wearing anything other than her white blouse and blue skirt, but sometimes she wears a summer dress. I'd like to see her wear her school uniform again because I really liked the design.<br><br><br>Yes, her past in the Tower of Heaven has made her wary of her feelings and as such he keeps them closed off from other people. But gradually she is learning to count on her friends more.<br><br><br>I think she's knows she's sexy, and I think so too.<br><br><br>Of course, but I'd try to limit it. She's the angry type of drunk!<br><br><br>Sitting underneath a sakura blossom tree, having a picnic together.<br><br><br>I feel her biggest flaw is that she is always trying to do things by herself, always trying to be the hero, which doesn't always work out for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  She doesn't wear highthighs but her friend does and I tought how good she would look in highthighs. <br><br>Your post made me swap my figma Saori's legs on to Hana. She looks good. I recommend it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wouldn't say it awoke my fetish, but she definitely boosted my masochism fetish.  <br><br>Not anymore. While the second season was airing and stuff, I was in the threads defending her a lot, but now it's just pointless and does nothing but piss me off.<br><br> Being a pet for my lovely Kiririn! <br>Joking, joking. If she were to get a pet, I could see her adopting a cute, tabby cat.<br><br>Summer or winter, probably. That's just a guess since it's never said.<br><br>With the exception of MADs and whatnot, I'd say pretty much every single youtube video with her is terrible.<br>I don't really spend much time looking for them, though.<br><br>At school, with her model friends, and at work she's incredibly polite and helpful.<br>With anybody else, she's super tsun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you see your waifu when browsing /a/ or 4chan in general?<br><br><br>She has a cat named Boris<br><br><br>Probably Winter.<br><br><br>I don't even want to search for them tbh<br><br><br>Very polite, but there are times when she goes nuts  it's pretty cute </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, huh?</br>  <br>Definitely summer. It's the best time of year to go swimming, after all.<br><br><br>There's a few, but I dare not speak their names.<br><br><br>She has good manners.<br><br><br> "Help? Help?! HELPUMEEE!" <br><br><br>Here's the most recent one I've saved.  Based Sharkbro. <br><br><br>She'd rather spend her free time playing videogames or exercising.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She seems fond and more festive around summer, but there's something about seeing her playing in the snow that warms the heart.<br><br>Much obliged. It's been in the making for a while, and I'm glad you enjoyed it so.<br><br>I can think of a few.<br><br>Surprisingly refined, actually, though she can just as easily turn this respectfulness on it's head. For the most part, though, she is quite respectful and polite.<br><br>Fair enough.<br><br>Hard to pick just one... Though a particular lyric comes to mind: "I promise the truth is there. I want to be a sweet girl. Honest feeling."<br><br>I think it's bad enough I hear her voice even when I'm not browsing 4chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like so</br>  <br>Whoops, completely misread that question.<br><br>I do, yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah a lot. I used to like pretty hardcore stuff but after I've fallen in love with her they stopped interesting me. Now I love things like vanilla in missionary or lotus, pantyshots, bandaids in various places, embracing and looking deeply into each other eyes etc. All of them apply only to her though because I'm exclusive to her anyway.<br><br><br>Only when I'm provoked. I'm not a type of person who goes to /e/ to yell at everybody to stop sexuallizing his waifu.<br><br><br>No. I think she would like to have a rabbit.<br><br><br>Summer. She would enjoy warmness and brightness.<br><br><br>Of course. Having such a great amount of nice things comes with a price.<br><br><br>Very polite and respectful.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I think I'm more open to femdom because of her. Pic related is an image of her in military uniform which was a fetish I didn't realise I had until I saw her in it.<br><br><br>Of course, but I also have to accept that sometimes what they are saying is true too. That doesn't make me love her any less though.<br><br><br>Well Happy is like the guild pet that everyone looks after.<br><br><br>I think she likes winter best because of the snow.<br><br><br>Erza has a sort of strict personality, using formal phrases sometimes, so I'd say she is quite polite. She is also respectful to the guild master's wishes and treats everyone as friends until otherwise proven.<br><br><br>"We don't die for our friends, we live for our friends". I think this sentence truly shows the importance of friendship in everyday life.<br><br><br>Only in other FT threads</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br/></br></br>  So many samefag posts to report.  <br><br><br>"Thanks... for hanging out with me."<br><br>Maybe, actually.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spring and summer. <br><br><br>Sonico is so beautiful.<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no really good ones of her on her own.<br><br> tfw you can't afford them <br>I will get one of every girl in anglerfish team even if I die.<br><br>"Can humans even wake up at six in the morning" This quote hits very close to home.<br><br>I haven't got round to going ham on chrome. I've done my desktop and am about to start my phone.<br><br>i just wanna talk about my waifu, i never come on these threads so i just like to get it all out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone read out the dialog of some awful fan-made comics featuring Mai that had been posted on Deviantart. The result is pretty bad:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yuA<wbr>e3INw6D0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>OK.<br><br>"I am me!" That was the point that Mai was able to accept and make peace with herself. I was happy that she was able to overcome her past trauma and manage to be happy the way she is.<br><br>I don't use plugins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think it's time to post swimsuits <br>Gotcha, boss.<br><br> Do you see your waifu when browsing /a/ or 4chan in general? <br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no pics of your waifu in a swimsuit or bikini <br><br>Godammit.</br></br>  <br>Sure.<br><br><br>Probably one of these:<br> To you who sobbed as you looked at me who was troubled yet smiling, I say: “Welcome home!”. Because yesterday and tomorrow as well, there is a place here for you to come and say “I’ve come home!” <br> I'll sing, sing, sing to you! Even if it's just a wish carrying my love. If it someday becomes a dream come true, I'll sing, sing, sign to you! <br> Honey; I love you, I say it aloud. May my wish reach you. Ah.. Honey take me there someday. I'll be waiting for you for long; May your dream last till that day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about a specific genre, but I think she's a fan of anime and manga. She enjoys Japan, its culture, etc so she must have seen a few anime or read some manga at some point.<br><br><br>School uniform, but for the times she's gone to the pool she's worn various bikinis. She looks great in any outfit, I'd love to see her try on some casual summer stuff.<br><br><br>Nope. Not any times I can think of.<br><br><br>She's proud of her body. She's got no cause for concern about how she looks, which is how it should be because she's absolutely gorgeous.<br><br><br>I think she's too fancy for just run of the mill beer. Maybe something a bit fancier would fit her tastes.<br><br><br>When it comes to her Peerage she gets incredibly hotheaded or rash if they're threatened. It hasn't caused any lasting damage but I could see a villain using that to their advantage.<br><br><br>Not especially, though there is one.  Trichophilia, a fetish for hair. <br><br><br>She has a bat familiar, if that counts as a pet. It's seen a few times, doing a few menial tasks, but other than that it's out of the way.<br><br><br>Probably, but I don't look at stuff like that. I'd rather not make myself angry if I can avoid it.<br><br><br>Very polite. She was raised to be the next heiress for their the family name and thus knows how to conduct herself with social grace. Even outside of formal occasions she's very polite and friendly.<br><br><br>I use AppChan and have her on the right.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>casually used gratuitous violence, but that mostly stems from her being able to undo it on a whim.<br>so while forgivable, it would still be an extremely unpleasant experience.<br><br><br>she has a puppy that she loves very much, though it hasn't come up in anything that has actually been translated.  it doesn't fail to make my heart skip a beat <br><br><br> over-stimulation <br>surprisingly I'm still not really too much into most types of femdom though<br><br><br>Although she does for sure enjoy swimsuit weather a lot, I'm thinking winter oddly enough. <br>She'd force snowball fights constantly, and now it's a little terrifying to think about those long canadian winters with her.<br>even if she didn't put ice in them or something, the bruises would be reaaal<br><br><br>most of them are pretty bad but I found the cringiest abridged series done by people with no acting skills and bad microphones.<br><br><br>she is surprisingly polite a lot of the time, but she is also often very blunt and can be very casually rude.<br> great compatibility here I think <br><br><br> THE MALE ERECTILE TISSUE CAN ABSORB MORE BLOOD WHEN STIMULATED AND BECOME AS HARD AS A PIECE OF METAL <br><br><br>sometimes people still make threads but they're not that common these days as the series is fairly old<br>her series does pop up in all sorts of strange places I don't expect it though, like on brewing websites<br><br><br> not really <br>bullllllllllllllllll shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Might be spring.<br><br>Not that i know, but there was one fandub, but they tried so i wouldn't consider it awful or bad.<br><br>She is very polite and helpful to some people if they need it.<br><br>Pic related is the only one i have about swimsuits in my phone.<br><br>When she blushes a lot, i know it's not a line but i love it!<br><br>Well, uhh.<br> She is posted in that "sweaty unwashed" threads.   But i got a fetish on sweat too, but still pisses me off a bit. <br>But other than that, i don't know.<br><br>You gotta search on japanese sites too, anon. But you gotta search with her name in kanji.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it really fits her.<br><br><br>Too many things to fit in one date.<br><br><br>She's gone a bit too far in not losing those she loves.<br><br><br>Not really.<br><br><br>No, and i don't think she'd be against having a pet.<br><br><br>Not very.<br><br><br><br>Yep.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bullllllllllllllllll shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit <br>I don't see her the type to come to 4chan.

It sounded really cute and awkward when she said it.<br><br>Can't really comment on that when she's got official art of her in it, both in the anime and LN.<br><br>If anything, she pandered to my currently-existing ones.<br><br>She's a fujoshi and she can't dance all too well, but I love her all the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How relevant is your waifu in her series?  <br> when </br>  <br>thanks for my new kuroko desktop background anon</br>  <br> Ryuko is Carnac <br>Congratulations, you have now got that in my head.

They do grow a couple centimeters post time-skip though. <br><br><br>Walking around an aquarium/park. I just want to see her lovely smile as she points out all the cool stuff to me.<br><br><br>She's not very conversational towards people who aren't her close friends.

The only ones this group really needs are Kurumi(Combat/Scouting/Vehicular Control/Resource Acquisition) and Yuki (Morale/Navigation/Planning). Yuuri used to do Resource Management, but it's not really needed now. At least Miki's trying to learn how to drive.  </br></br></br>  <br>It's up to date now, and it seems to be new chapters monthly.

It should start to sell now or it might not even go over the manabi line. Madoka too started to dominate rankings after ep 3 when Miami got charlotted.<br><br>I know but anime is not bad at all.

Also I hope Lerche let her kill a few zombies, some of those assaults were really violent.</br>  <br> 1343226516938 <br> not "not this one retard" </br></br>  <br>Grisaia was 2 seasons ago</br>  <br>They are high school girls, ergo almost grown up.</br>  <br> little girls <br>They are 18.</br></br>  <br>I think it's some sort of berry.<br><br><br>Agreed, you can never have too much shovel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If anyone,  Kurumi  is going to kill herself.<br> &gt;discovers a hanged man in the basement<br> discovers the pistol <br> goes to the closet where Radio-chan is </br></br> </br></br>  <br>Flesh doesn't look like that.</br>  <br> they're not middle schoolers <br>Fuck Japan and their babyface drawings.</br></br>  <br>I think that Miki killing Kurumi is far more probable.<br>It will be the sign of Miki assuming the shovel work.</br></br>  <br>I doubt she'll kill herself in the standard sense, it seems more likely to me that she'll kill herself by going out of her way to protect the rest of them. As she's nearly done a few times already.</br>  I hope the university girls aren't up to something bad, the poor girls have had enough already.  <br>You sure about that? Try remembering the first chapter. If something is nice at the start, it's going to be a fucking hellhole the next second.</br>  <br>They're  cannibals. <br><br>Alternatively, they're working with the guys in bike helmets with baseball bats, maybe to rob other survivors or something.</br></br></br>  <br>They are clearly plotting for something.</br>  <br>At the best, they'll be indifferent and told them to leave. <br> <br>This is totally plausible.</br></br></br>  Is the manga weekly or monthly?  <br>Because the beta males dies pathetically and the whiteknights is whiteknighting so hard that they died lefting the girls.<br>The alpha male? Don't worry they survive and probably already been rescued.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>That is, if her "Plot Shield" isn't expiring until the end or at least until she found the antidote (which is less likely).<br> Besides, A lot of people is worshipping Kurumi right now, I doubt the author would kill her in a way as mainstream as those (except if he/she wanted a riot) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monthly, releases on the 24th according to Wikipedia</br>  <br>She won't kill herself though<br>She's not a coward</br></br>  <br>Thanks. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>Lesbian rape dungeon.</br>  <br>Same, it's really grabbed me</br>  <br><br>What if she does it so that her friends wouldn't have to?</br></br>  <br>Dude's probably going to kill her in the most suffering way possible, then ease the pain with the greatest healing ever known.</br>  Do they even masturbate?  <br>There can't be an healing if best girl die. If she die, it will be a downfall into abyss.<br>But I doubt the author will kill her.</br></br>  <br>They're eighteen, they most definitely do.<br>Now, the frequency is debatable, but I believe Miko shlicks the most out of the four main ones.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br> With the shovel, though. </br></br>  <br> best girl <br>I agree; there's no way Yuki can die. Kurumi's fucked though. <br><br><br>She's been alone for months out of pure spite, so yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, they're 17-18, combine that with constant stress due to the situation they're in, they need to evacuate the stress, probably by masturbation.</br>  <br>Remember, anything can happen depending on what the author is thinking. There's even a chance where they'll be raped until the bikers saves them or something.</br>  <br>Why only Yuki and her delusions wear blue uniform?</br>  <br><br>And everytime something shitty happens, it turns out to be just fine the next second.<br><br>Just have faith.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A better question would be...Do they masturbate together?</br></br>  <br>"Flick The Bean" Ring.</br>  <br>Have you not seen the image floating around? It's the inverse of the green on the other girl's uniforms.<br><br><br>Kurumi certainly doesn't, transfer of bodily fluids could pass the infection. She probably has to do it in a tent.</br></br></br></br>  <br> everything that has happened to Rii-san recently <br>Fucking no.<br><br><br>Perhaps their school has more than one color of uniform they can wear?<br><br>Also, when you think about it, child-zombies aren't actually very common in zombie apocalypses, for whatever reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're already past that, haven't we? (The crossbow and the bikers). But then again, this manga is full of plot twist so I can't really predict what's going to happen next. The best case I can think of is that either the uni is going to be raided or the zombie will attack for no reason, and someone is going to die.</br>  How someone explain to me wtf you're all talking about? I watched that entire first episode and there's nothing but a bunch of moe girls doing moe thing in school. It's like, zero originality whatsoever. Is this the /a/ equivalent of the fingerbox? Cause you just look dumb.  <br><br>But she found a loli in the end, seems about right to me, even if it happens to be an imaginary loli.</br></br>  <br>  watched that entire first episode <br>  nothing but a bunch of moe girls doing moe thing in school <br>  Cause you just look dumb. <br>Try to actually watch the last few minutes or read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I watched that entire first episode <br>Clearly you didn't</br></br>  <br>Watch it again, backwards, at 0.5x speed</br>  <br>The university's a collection of small groups of people surviving against one another. Rather than zombies to worry about, it's the thought of other survivors murdering you and stealing your shit that's the biggest problem.<br><br>Crossbowfaggot is an example of this; he's too paranoid to trust anyone, and it's probably gotten to the point where it's a lot safer to shoot first and ask questions later.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm already self inserting as Rii-san's husband in my imagination.<br><br><br> She's still more useful than Rii-san. <br>Not at all. Being less crazy is not the same as being more useful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still, doesn't mean they can't worry about the zombies. Like i said, anything can happen. A typical zombie story moment is when the MC is visiting a crowded place, sooner or later it will be overrun by zombies, like the MC has some kind of a fucking zombie magnet. But other survivor going to fuck shit up is more likely, and like i said, someone is going to die.<br><br>On the other hand, I'd like to see more of the outbreak's background, some bonding between the girls and maybe a fucking bitchslap to Rii so she wakes up.</br></br></br>  <br>Rii did it a lot before I'd assume.</br>  I'm actually really liking the OP after understanding the double layers.<br>It suits the tone of the early manga and is catchy.</br>  New episode tomorrow lads.  <br><br>I hope it's better than the first one.<br><br>Hopefully the fun and suffering is better balanced.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If anything, they should do something with Miki, not Rii. She has nothing going for her character right now (all of her issues were quickly solved at the school), and does nothing special for the party unlike the other 3 (aside from being smart). I think the author is setting her up to kill Kurumi after she turns, though.<br><br>Rii can be delusional for a few more chapters, Yuki was delusional for a good 20+ chapters anway, and there are more pressing issues like Kurumi or the bikers.<br><br><br>Kurumi schliked to her Senpai every night, infa100%.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will the dog die next chapter?<br>He needs to go quickly, so the can advance.</br></br>  <br> MC is visiting a crowded place, sooner or later it will be overrun by zombies <br>Could be covered by Miki's flashbacks, since that's pretty much what happened to her.<br><br>The thing that scares me the most about the anime is the ED. It's implying that everyone but Yuki's going to die, which hasn't happened yet. Maybe the mangaka's foreshadowing the ending of the manga in it?</br></br></br></br>  How far do we think the Anime will get? The "graduation ceremony" would be a good end point, but it'd be a bit a push to fit everything up to there into 12 episodes.  Stop shitting on Rii, she's really useful with all the chores she does and only a little crazy that has not hurt anyone yet.  <br> that has not hurt anyone yet. <br>Except it nearly got her a bolt to the face. She's only still alive because Kurumi attained superhuman reflexes. They're no longer in a safe environment, so being even a little crazy's going to get you murdered, especially in a place like the university where apparently everyone's at each other's neck.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking the same, the graduation ceremony would be probably the best end. Otherwise, where can they stop?</br>  <br>Everyone has done dangerous stuff before, Yuki has screamed a lot attracting attention, Kurumi decided to experiment her new powers near the truck, etc.<br><br>What pisses me off is that at the first mistake Rii-san made, everyone started labeling as shit or useless.<br><br>Unless something actually bad happens, people should calm the fuck down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miki's doing nothing because there's nothing she can do at the moment.If the author is really trying to that, it might happen after Rii is done with her delusions.Having 2 personnels having a heavy mental breakdowns isn't really a good way to survive.<br><br>Besides, like  said, her delusions can potentially kill the others if she's going to do something stupid.<br><br><br>Most of them actually has a good reason to begin with, while Rii's looks like something out of a "How to suicide in a zombie apocalypse book".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree some people are being a bit harsh, but she would've killed Kurumi and has only gotten more unstable since. She's an accident waiting to happen.</br>  <br>Yuki's delusions were really dangerous too, don't kid yourself, she could've also killed the others doing something stupid, they just got lucky, and Yuki delusions kept them sane at least.<br><br>Rii-san's delusions only caused danger to herself recently, it's really unfair to say that only Rii-san has been dangerous, everyone has done silly stuff before, except maybe Miki.<br><br>And there was no good reason for Yuki shouting before, only place where it really helped out was the fire drill. Kurumi was being really irresponsible too when she went wandering to test her powers around the truck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuki has screamed a lot attracting attention <br>Yuki also found Miki and has provided substantial emotional and psychological support to the group.<br><br>Kurumi at least knows how to handle zombies, and was able to take out the ones Miki accidentally attracted.<br><br>Rii's become as broken as Yuki once was, without even being able to distract her clubmates from the horrors of their reality as Yuki was able to. Her delusions are self-centered, and it's basically the only thing keeping her from killing herself at this point. She spends more time taking care of an imaginary friend than she does doing anything potentially useful, and she's unable to do anything else until she gets a heavy dose of reality in the same vein Yuki did and hopefully that won't lead to her breaking completely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Back then, if Kurumi turned into a zombie (which was happening), someone would've had to kill her, as harsh as it is, Rii's judgement was the correct one back then.<br><br>Of course, her delusions are potentially harmful to the party, but we've yet to see that, which is why I think people should stop shitting on her, after all everyone has got into some kind of trouble and you don't see people shitting on them.</br></br></br>  Evil rapist cult when?   but she would've killed Kurumi <br>No shit, retard. Anybody would have, and should have killed a potential zombie in the works. Kurumi showed restraint, and it almost got her killed in the process. Yuuri showed no restraint until the last moment, and and Miki not showed up with the vaccine when she did, there's no guarantee Kurumi would have been able to stave off being a zombie anyways. <br><br>I know its sad seeing our character almost die, but be rational when it comes to these characters. It's not like Yuuri had some desperate desire to kill Kurumi. She was losing her mind just holding the knife alone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Now is more likely than ever.</br></br>  <br> She spends more time taking care of an imaginary friend than she does doing anything potentially useful <br>She still drives, cooks and does chores, which is what she has always done, how is she doing -less- useful things now?<br><br> Yuki also found Miki and has provided substantial emotional and psychological support to the group. <br> Kurumi at least knows how to handle zombies, and was able to take out the ones Miki accidentally attracted. <br><br>I haven't denied Yuki's or Kurumi's usefulness, point is that they also have done dangerous stuff without people shitting on them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Steppen King's The Standard </br>  <br> people shitting on them. <br><br>Are people honestly shitting on Yuuri? Most people seem to hold the simple observation that she's lost her mind at this point, and is a hindrance to the group. Which is pretty much an undeniable fact. She's turned from an asset to a liability. Until she gets her shit back together, she'll still be a potential problem to everybody. <br><br>I still love Yuuri and I want her to get it together sooner than later, but we're at the beginning of Yuuri's second suffering arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kurumi was handcuffed, and Mii was getting the medicine. She should've consulted with Mii before doing anything rash.</br></br>  <br>Calling it now. <br><br>There will be a totaliarian survivor group led by a charismatic strongman, who are revering the outbreak as the second coming of jebus, buddha and ameratsu etc.<br>As an ritual of initiation, they will infect new members and 'slaves' they have captured with the <br>omega-strain of the virus in an attempt to mindcontrol them for their world conquest plans.<br><br>Ah, and they will attempt to rape our heroines. Especially Rii-san, who is seen as healthy and fertile venus, with a high potential of giving birth to semi-zombified super-soldiers.<br><br>And Mii shouldnt have thrown away the gun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She thought she was turning.<br>I doubt they have the full grasp of how long it takes to change, so she probably thought it was too late</br></br>  <br><br> Most people seem to hold the simple observation that she's lost her mind at this point, and is a hindrance to the group.  <br>Have you been reading past threads with people calling her worst girl and shit? She's hardly an hindrance too, considering she hasn't made any trouble yet. Even when other people got the party into some kind of trouble, nobody ever called them shit.<br><br> Which is pretty much an undeniable fact <br>Except she still helps as she did before, which is something most people conveniently ignore in these threads. The only undeniable fact is that she's losing her mind.<br><br> Until she gets her shit back together, she'll still be a potential problem to everybody.  <br>Yeah, the point is that she still hasn't been such a big problem.<br><br> second <br>It's still the same arc, if you're talking about Ruu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi's handcuffs are irrelevant. A zombie is still a zombie. All they would wind up with if Kurumi turned into a zombie is a room with their friend's corpse in it anyways, only they would have to run the risk of getting bit and infected themselves. Miki's medicine search wasn't a guarantee, but an assumption. They didn't even know if she was there on time, much less if it would even work. <br><br>Yuuri's stress-induced mania was entirely justified. Harsh, unpleasant, and undesirable, but justified.</br></br></br>  <br>  Yuki delusions kept them sane at least <br>Which is why i said it's for a good reason. But even though sh'e still delusional, she can at least see the reality.<br> Rii-san's delusions only caused danger to herself recently <br>The crossbowfag says otherwise, might be even worse if Kurumi wasn't there.Rii's delusion is like Yuki's, just more twisted.<br><br>  no good reason for Yuki shouting before <br>This. <br><br>  Kurumi was being really irresponsible too when she went wandering to test her powers around the truck <br><br>Okay, this was actually pretty accurate so <br>I won't bother saying anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so she probably thought it was too late <br>I agree that her intentions were good, but it was still a rash decision that would've been bad for the group in the long run, even if Kurumi starts turning again in future.</br></br>  <br><br><br> watching the end <br> moe girl talking to other moe girls <br> walking in corridor with moe girl friend <br> sees open window, closes it <br> episode ends <br><br>Clearly you guys have no idea what you're talking about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay delusional, Yuki.</br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about</br>  <br> Muh crossbow <br><br>That's not really a fair comparison. Some paranoid lunatic in the middle of a post-apocalyptic society with an itchy trigger finger would have shot at anybody who was holding anything. He almost murdered a girl holding a teddy bear because "SH-SHE MIGHT BE A ZOMBIE TOO! THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME!" <br><br>Yuuri's delusions are about as harmless as Yuki's were, they are just in a far worse location to have them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rash? Yes. Unwarranted? No.<br><br><br> I agree<br>Yuki didn't cause any trouble because she was in a relative safe place and hadn't encounter anyone dangerous from the outside world.<br>For the most part of Yuuri's craziness, she has been fine up until that one part.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuri's delusions are about as harmless as Yuki's were, they are just in a far worse location to have them. <br>Not him, but the location is exactly the problem.<br>Babysitting the teddy bear in the school would have been inoffensive; however, they are not in the school anymore, she playing the mother is extremely dangerous.</br></br></br>  <br> Which is why i said it's for a good reason. But even though sh'e still delusional, she can at least see the reality. <br> This. <br>Those were not good reasons for all the trouble Yuki made, they were good side effects, not good reasons. Yuki wasn't being delusional on purpose before like she is now.<br><br> The crossbowfag says otherwise, <br>But anon, it's exactly why I said "only caused danger to herself recently": I was talking about the crossbow. Or do you think the guy was only stopping them because of Rii? If it wasn't because of of her delusions, he would've still aimed at them, only that he wouldn't have shot (probably). Being shot is the only bad effect we've yet seen from her delusions, and it amounted to nothing, people should stop being so harsh with her.<br> <br><br> Okay, this was actually pretty accurate so  <br>I have been pretty accurate.<br><br>This , pretty much. I'd even say that Yuki's delusions were even more dangerous, they just had better luck with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   mfw watching this episode <br><br>I mean I read the synopsis, but I still didn't really believe it until that classroom scene, fuck.

That's low. Some anons here spend $500 a month on buyfag shit. <br>I recently found my  waifu  and will only buying shit of her for a while. <br><br>I'm already running out of space and I just started a year ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't know you could do that. <br><br>There are some exclusives I also want, so I'll give it a try.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck you're retarded.</br></br>  <br>http://www.fromjapan.co.jp/title/ch<wbr>arge#pur<br>Other proxies do it too.

I decided I'm gonna buy them anyway, thanks anon.</br>  <br>You should have spent some money getting gifs from somewhere other than tumblr instead.</br>  <br>I'm hoping we get a Shara alt-color.</br>  <br> Standfoard Encyclopedia of Philosophy <br>ma nigga</br></br>  <br>This right here.<br><br>She looks even better than the original.<br>Best of all, I can get yuri romance with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jFg<wbr>_8u87zT0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xfzztwkz<wbr>2uvxsjv/AADYp66sGJs-1SUUsmkRhqmOa?d<wbr>l=0</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>What kind of name is 'Pile'?</br>  <br>Maybe a pseudonym?</br>  <br>So i got an answer for my inquiry.<br>The Base fee will be 5000 and additional 2000 per hour. Kinda sucks that they will charge the full amount of fees even if they dont get her, but i guess thats just the risk for wanting something so limited.</br></br>  <br><br> Racing Miku 2014 <br><br>Fuck you GSC. At this rate she wont ship before fucking 2016. This is bs. It was hard enough that she was delayed to July<br><br>ftfy</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They aren't birthday related, just based on card illustrations from the mobile game "School idol festival".</br>  The illustrations amiami sends are getting worse and worse.  <br>Why not just wait until she pops up preowned? <br>even if she climbs in price, surely it's cheaper than what you're paying in fees.</br></br>  Best tweet ever, sasuga hobbysearch https://twitter.com/hobbysearch_jpn<wbr>/status/621250432464064512</wbr>  <br>There will be only 300 available. I dont really want to take the risk of having to hunt her down for maybe even a way higher price.<br>She may not go that high but i hopefully think that this is the better solution. Ofcourse i have no way to know but i think its worth to take that gamble. And when i actually pay more through this way then i just fucked up and will know better for the next time.</br></br>  <br>And on second thought its kinda exciting to have a nip go to a event for you.</br>  <br>Just think about it as wage. 2000 jpy per hour is fucking nothing.</br>   you will never be a born in nip and easily get a lot of money from filthy gaijin that is PAYING you to visit a local event (which you were going to visit anyways) <br><br>Why is this world so cruel?</br></br>   release date 16th <br><br>It's time.</br></br>   delayed <br>What a shame</br>  <br>Fuck off weeb.</br>  <br>What color are her pantsu?</br>  <br>Seems fine, although I wouldn't order a nendoroid from amazon if it has a known bootleg.<br><br>Check MFC to see if it has a bootleg, if it doesn't then i'd definitely order if the price is right. <br><br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>41763 - Yours has a bootleg, but if you have common sense and order from a Jap and not a Chinese dude, then you should be fine.</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>from the thumbnail I thought that cat was accessory</br></br>  <br><br>so much this</br></br>  Best couple just arrived<br>21€ customs fees ;_;</br>  Are things on amazon.jp less 8% of the displayed price?  <br>That's pretty wide.</br>  <br>Where did you see the wonfes exclusives?</br>  <br><br>sounds like german zoll</br></br>  <br>I'm cool with this. Between Zebonsakura Twins, IA/VT Crystal and Racing Miku all being delayed my month was going to be ballocks. that should make it slightly less stingy.</br>  Does anyone know a good place that prints phone covers to order?<br>I already have fukkireta as my ring tone but i feel like that doesn't unleash my power level enough so i need a lewd anime picture on my phone</br>  <br><br>People like you are the fucking reason weebs exists</br></br>  <br>How does that make any sense?<br>I mean i'd understand being called a weeb but that was just confusing</br></br>  <br> weebs are the reason weebs exist <br>deep</br></br>  Well GSC just charged my credit card for her. So hopefully soon I'll get her. Too bad they'll never released the rest of the girls so I'll never have a Nendo of best girl, Itsuki.  <br>Later this month I'll get her as well. Why are Nendoroids so addictive?</br>  <br> wanting to reveal your powerlevel </br>  <br>French Douane</br>  <br>Why didn't you undervalue?</br>  <br>yes</br>  i struggling with myself to preorder this beauty. i'm just wondering that i see her rarely in other preorder and also a bit surprised why she is still available for preorder. does anyone know the reason for it?

They have some sort of plan for the series, considering the LNs and shit, so more figures in the  distant-ish  future aren't impossible.</br>  <br>My god.<br><br>I can't wait to see the Ryoubi one. Yozakura won a poll for one so she is getting one now. I hope amiami puts them up soon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I have a shit tier pillow.

And that isn't exclusive to English.</br>  <br> Wasn't aware about how nazi were the european customs before today <br>That's in the guide.</br></br>  <br>I thought those are hobbystock exclusives</br>  <br>They usually get out up on amiami though don't they? I've seen the mousepads and Dakis available on there before, hobby stock is just credited as the maker. I hope to god it goes up, I want Yozakura shit.<br><br>I just checked, amiami has sold all the dakimakuras made by YAEGASHI nan. Hobbystock is credited. http://slist.amiami.com/top/search/<wbr>list?s_keywords=Senran+pillow&amp;pagem<wbr>ax=15</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  Where can I find oppai mouse pads? The guide doesn't say much about them.  <br>Get a girlfriend and tell her your fetish is to have her cosplay and use her as a mousepad.</br>  <br>maybe the guide doesn't answer this question. but google does within seconds. amazon for example sales them. (even if they dont have that much</br>  <br>She wouldn't neatly on my desk next to my keyboard.<br><br><br>I saw that, but I was under the impression that Amazon should be avoided. Or was that only for figures?</br></br></br></br>  Today's delivery is magician Sonico prize figure. As good as can be expected from a prize fig, so plenty happy with her.  <br>On the shops listed on the guide.</br>  <br>Any plan to melt it?</br>  <br>No, I prefer my Sonicos in non-melted form, personally.</br>  Do you ever use fortune to decide whether or not to buy something you're on the edge of? <br><br>For example, using evens for yes and odds for no in your post number?</br></br>  <br>No. If you're on the edge about a figure you shouldn't buy it.</br>  <br>No, that's stupid. If I'm not 100% committed to something I don't buy it, period.<br><br>This way everything in my collection is a 10/10 and I have no regrets, no buyer's remorse and don't turn into one of the fags who tries to sell off all his bandwagon shit in 6 months.</br></br></br>   exclusive wallscroll bonus on a full BD set bought on toranoana <br> it's not even listed on their site, not even the BD set <br>Now how would someone get this other than living in Japan as a japanese citizen?</br></br>  <br>read the guide</br>  I got my figure delivered on Monday yet just received my ransom note from ParcelJews.<br><br>Since they made a mistake and wrongly delivered the mail before I paid the tax and clearance fees will there be any legal repercussions from ignoring the letter and not paying?</br></br>  <br>well i would say for figures you have to be way more cautious because of bootlegs. for oppaipads this shouldn't be that of a big issue. But if you find a shop that is willing to customize the pads or have a bigger sortiment - i'm willing to learn about as the most i've seen so far are just full with characters that i dont care about.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Nah.</br>   they'll never make mouse pad with an onahole attachment   <br>Never say never.</br>  <br>I have tape, mousepad and a Tenga<br>$10, thanks</br></br>  <br>not with that attitude</br>  <br>...bruh</br>  I just bought this wall scroll (pic related) but apparently it doesn't come with any hanging rods for some strange reason. Where can I find these or whats an easy solution so I can hang it up? Just use a wooden dowel of some sort?  <br>Stick it up your ass.</br>    <br>No, seriously. Shove it up your  google ly boogley anus.</br>  <br>Do you actually have it in your hands, or are you just going by the picture?</br>  <br>I have searched it up and found a couple solutions I just thought I'd find other alternatives on here since I usually find some things exclusively on /a/ compared to anywhere else, thats all.</br>  <br>Shove it up your /a/ss.</br>  <br> this won't come equipped with one </br>  <br>Sticking it up your ass is a pretty valid /a/ opinion, if you ask me.</br>  <br>Why would you want that? You'd just get your semen stains on it.</br>  <br>Because sometimes you just want to fuck your mouse pad you know?</br>  <br>A hobby store might have something close enough to work. If you're just going by the picture like that other guy asked then it probably does have them or it has a string on it instead of hooks like the scroll I got.</br>  So did prime day get any good deal or what?  <br>Maybe you could force it.</br>  Just ordered her. I'm honestly surprised she's not sold out. There's nothing glaringly wrong with her that I've overlooked is there?  <br> There's nothing glaringly wrong with her <br> he doesn't know </br></br>  <br><br> not getting best Shinobu <br><br>why anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the fucking dress doesn't show her ass like it did in the prototype? Get real, nerd.</br>  <br>That's what happens when two figures that look almost the same get made. Most people order one, and if there isn't a huge difference like griffon - alter, the orders will be split between them.</br>  Enjoy the fifteenth of July.  <br>It's missing the Hikage one and a variation of Homura I believe.</br>  <br> he thinks it's about that </br>  <br>Her face looks very derpy there.</br>  <br> can't even see her ass, armpits and the space between dress and armpit <br>Koto isn't lewd enough.</br></br>  I got my rumic world box set.  anyone??<br><br>goddamnit Shirou, you looks cool as fuck</br></br>  <br>Do you happen to also have a picture of the white muramasa mousepad? the big one with the thighs</br>   fake a paypal payment summary <br> customs asks for a screenshot or pdf of the order summary from manda <br><br>Th... they won't actually go looking for it in sold out items, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>I have her and let me tell you: you really don't want to display her without the hat.</br>  <br>Why? You mean why I faked the payment summary? To avoid VAT of course.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Why does he look so young and skinny? I hope there will be another Archer fig announced at wonfes</br>  <br>There's a seam line where the bangs come off to swap faces. It's honestly not that noticeable but it seems some people are getting autismal over it.</br>  <br>It's not white but there is this one</br>  <br>How is this a mousepad again? It would be very uncomfortable even for casual browsing, let alone serious work or god forbid, some real gaming. Fucking crazy japs.</br>  <br><br>Keep dreaming. His route had to be animated twice for him to get a shitty figma, shitty RAH, shitty Nendo and that scale. Also, you really don't want "muscle" Archer, that's the route both the fima and RAh took and it took fucking horrible, it doesn't translate well to 3D at fucking all.</br></br>  <br>seems the only white thing I remember was the strings. thank you anon.</br>  <br>Like every oppai mousepad then.<br><br>They aren't designed for conventional use.</br></br></br>  <br>How much for that cat?</br>  <br>Cmon anon, don't leave me hanging. You think they'll realize?</br>  <br><br>They need to stop making mouse pads and just make them hangable foam posters or something. It always bothers me how the weird shapes forces the picture to be awkwardly cut off, especially when the arms are above the head.</br></br>  <br><br>Even if they do announce one it would release July next year at the earliest.</br></br>  <br>Normalfags have no idea of the figure's actual value so i'd say you will be fine. I mean it even says the item is damaged.</br>  <br> 2k <br> Opened <br><br>For that price I'm fairly sure you're going to be getting something broken. Amico have her for minimum 6k rank B/B, for Manda to be selling it at 2k it must be worse than C/C.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Never mind, didn't read the chain post.</br></br>  <br>Oh dear.</br>  <br><br>Two anons who don't read.</br></br>  <br>Oh</br>  <br>you too anon</br>  <br>What's the point in owning one then?</br>  <br>Never stop doc</br>  <br>Well, if you thought it's real then it must be a good fake.</br>  <br>Where can I still pre-order it? Been looking around forever.</br>  <br>They can be, if you put them in an oven at 400 for ten minutes.</br>  <br><br>Not really. It's not rare to see those prices for a figure beyond broken, but customs are not going to know that, plus, even if that anon tells them that is broken they can just see from outside the box that is not true. Most of the time whenever someone tries to outsmart customs by putting prices ridiculously low it backfires them and they end up paying whatever customs think ti's worth, and that's usually s fucking lot.</br></br>  <br>Looks kinda fat.</br>  <br>She's completely perfect. I have several Shinobu figures and this is best one.</br>  Another one for the collection  <br>Customs in my country ask for screenshoots/pdf/whatever too even if the bill is right on top of the box just so they can fine you if you lie to them, take care</br>  Still fucking upset that Yen Press isn't going to be doing a one-volume hardcover release of the Rebellion manga<br>Still fucking upset that it's not already out. I should own it by now.</br>  <br>I hope to fuck it gets delayed then cancelled just so I can see you suffer</br>  <br><br>Careful with that edge.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I didn't notice until now.</br>  Cow has a sale on?  What are the odds of her getting another figure? Otherwise I'll just get this one...  <br> that face <br>Your cat is so sick of your bullshit, anon.</br></br>  <br>Pretty good chances she'll get another one, if you're not satisfied with that one then at least wait for wonderfest for announcements.</br>  <br>You forgot your tab that says "gay sex with hats on."</br>  <br>he also has 3 Upotte tabs</br>  <br>Sorry, I closer one anon. <br>Is Upotte worth watching? I have the tab open because I was planning on watching it.</br></br>  <br> Pretty good <br> original IdolMaster is 3 times more popular yet they barely got anything </br></br>  <br>its pretty good make sure to watch the lewd OVA as well</br>  <br>Watch: no.<br>Read: yes.<br>Unless you like the XEBEC body type, in case you should watch the OVA.</br></br></br>  <br>Love you.</br>  <br>I'll read then watch.<br><br>Alright thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It's very cliche, win battles through hardwork and friendship. Only appealing aspect is the gun theme</br>    <br>Looks like shit.</br>  <br>Disgusting</br>  <br>How awful</br>  <br><br>This geniunly made me laugh</br></br>  <br> cat thinks it's a bird <br> pounce on it <br> breaks in half </br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't seem that bad in a technical sense. It just looks like she's from some old obscure OVA.</br>  Sorry for slowpoking, but Manda is doing some sort of campaign? Free shipping if you pay with PayPal? Is it only for Auction site?  who do I contact to get the art for this?  <br>and this</br>  <br><br>Seems you already have it.</br></br>  <br>the original image before it was encoded into video and had text plastered over it</br>  <br>Oh, well, then you can probably forget about it.</br>  <br>No, you're an idiot. There's no shipping added because they haven't calculated it yet.</br>  <br>Don't BDs come with creditless EDs?</br>  <br>Is this your first anime? Wait for the BD.</br>  <br>How fucking new are you?</br>  <br><br><br>I can't be fucked waiting</br></br></br>  <br>Better kill yourself then</br>  <br>Tough shit mate.</br>  <br>what are my chances of being reborn after the BD has been released or as one of the artist</br>  <br> you're an idiot <br>It is an ad campaign on their site, genius.<br><br>http://mandarake.co.jp/campaign/201<wbr>5/paypal-2/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you click the blue button it takes you to the auction part, if you click the red it'll take you to the normal store, so I assume it's for both. Also, the horrible google translation hints that it's only on one/your first order during the campaign period which last until the end of the year.</br></br>  <br>Well, shit, that's embarrassing. Sorry.</br>  <br>I wonder if its worldwide or japan only.</br>  <br>I just sent an email to ask. I also asked if there was a weight limit or something like that because I want to buy some heavy stuff, and free shipping would be amazing.</br>  <br>If it is worldwide, I hope its not free SAL shipping, I have two packages from RSAL that I have no idea where they are.</br>  <br> Kill yourself <br> Reborn as a Japanese girl <br> Grow up to be a teenager <br> Molested on a train while commuting home from school <br> Go home and cry in your room <br> Get on computer and burn through your anime backlog <br> Open BD file for Charlotte <br> See ED, think the picture is cute <br> Make it your wallpaper <br> Hard drive crashes the next day <br> Spend weeks trying to recover everything you lost <br> Walking home from school with your boyfriend <br> A Japanese truck appears out of nowhere and threatens to kill your boyfriend <br> You push him out of the way and get hit <br> Wake up in heaven <br> God laughs because this all could have been avoided if you just waited for the fucking BD </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are random people welcoming me to MFC?  <br>Because they're faggots.</br>  <br><br>Welcome to the real world.</br></br>  <br> kill yourself <br> reborn <br> get killed by truck <br> go to heaven <br>Hang on a sec...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only get one second chance</br>  <br>Yokuso to /buyfag/ I hope that you will find that this site has many things to offer collectors like us.

Is Manglobe doing a good job? What do you think of the OP song?<br>It might not fit the tone of the series too well but I like the untz.<br><br> You can talk about the manga too, I guess. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no i don't like fujoshit</br>  I like the op. Sure, one can argue that it's generic pop but it's good  <br> trips <br> edge meme <br> fujoshi meme <br> gore <br> moeshit <br> akame ga kill <br> black lagoon <br> female author <br>With this we have all the regular shitposting done with. Let's actually discuss the anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't care for the songs. <br>The show's okay. I'm looking forward to seeing a main plot pick up, now that we've got some sort of big bad behind the scenes.</br>  <br>fuck off Barafag</br>  <br>I like it so far. The ED is really good and I can't remember what the OP is.</br>  <br>The opening is really good, visual and song.</br>  what if Alex sings the ED?  <br>Nico is too moe</br>  gaaaaaaaaaaaay  Just saw this, I thought this was an anime original. Fuck.  <br>what's wrong with it being a derivation?</br>  <br>It's by a women. It's degeneracy to watch something whose conception was by a walking vagina.</br>  This anime ain't for pussys if you like gay Shonen crap or moe shit then this anime ain't for you  <br><br>Not that, I'm very prone to spoilers I thought I could participate in gangsta threads so I'll be taking my leave.</br></br>  So who is Alex gonna end up with?  <br> anime original <br> threads full of speculation, funposting about the wildest theories, everyone is on the same ride <br><br> derivation <br> hey guys I just watched this and <br> READ THE FUCKING MANGA YOU SECONDARY SHITTER OH BY THE WAY THESE GUYS ALL DIE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT ANYMORE <br><br>I can understand his disappointment. Watching series with /a/ is the best fun you can have here, but only if you're all on the same page.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She fucks Emilio</br>  <br><br>No hope for a proper discussion in /a/ for this series then. Anime original posters are leaving nothing but shit posts</br></br>   'Gangsta' that look like soccer players <br><br>no</br></br>  <br>This threads has been really calm so far though.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4929248  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128117888 <br/>  <br>Adaptations of manga and LNs tend to end just as you're getting to really like the show and the plot looks like it's going to get interesting. Of course, their goal is trying to get you to pick up the source material after all, so it's only natural they'd do that. <br><br>So yeah, if I had been that anon I'd have been majorly disappointed too.</br></br></br>  Fuck you /a/, you didn't warn me enough about deaf moe.  <br>Both dudes are pretty moe</br>   that other Gangsta thread <br>Christ. The reverse trolls really are going to town on this series.</br>  <br>It's always these kind of series that get trolled to death. Just ignore it, sometimes they'll lose interest after a few weeks and you can discuss the stuff with the ~10 - 50 fans it has.</br>  <br> How have you all liked that adaptation so far? <br>Well enough I suppose.<br><br>  Is Manglobe doing a good job? <br>I think the art style was adapted just fine but the animation is lacking. Sometimes the faces look a little off. I looked back through the first few chapters and noticed they kind of skipped chapter two, but I don't think what was left out couldn't be thrown in later. I thought Worick's explanation of the dog tags was awkward.<br><br>Also I'm worried that the art will be mostly serious face. There are some bits in the manga that are light-hearted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not shitpost to give your opinion on the series, and the series is bad in every single aspect, of course if you like it nobody give a shit about it, but next time learn how to start a thread if you don't want fun in your thread.</br>  <br> Worick's explanation of the dog tags was awkward <br>Yeah, as someone who knew what they were because of these threads, but hadn't read the manga, I was wishing that he'd get the fuck on with explaining it instead of dancing around the subject, and when he finally did, calling them a different "race" seemed like a very weird way of putting it.</br></br>  No stream<br>sorry folks. No one is interested in streaming it.</br>  <br>Waiting for Manglobe quality drop. Sucks, since it's looked awesome so far.</br>  <br>Like, so good I'm taking pictures of some guy's ass just because of the detail.</br>  <br>Anon...</br>  <br>UBW and Yahari were good rides and they are both adaptations.</br>  Shitposters will stop caring so the threads will be better from now on probably  <br>So is this homo? Do girls like it because it's homo?</br>  <br>If all you have to discuss after two episodes is how many shitposters there are then it doesn't bode well for the rest of the show.</br>  <br> female author <br><br>Fo' sho?</br></br></br>  <br>Seems like there are still some left.</br>  <br> 2 unique posters actually talking about the series <br> they talk about butts and shipping <br>Every fucking thread, at least give thanks to the shitposters to give something to talk about.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to cuddlefuck Nico.</br>  So HS has 480p of Gangsta 03 up, how long till Underwater releases it?  <br>1080p is up</br>  <br>Can confirm.</br>  <br>Funi doe, I Underwater's uncensored softsubbed releases are better.</br>  <br>Ill compare them later</br>  So Nicolas murdered Worricks family and they are best friends now?  <br>Worrick's family hated him and (I'm sure that) by the time his dad got around to doing what triggered Nic the feeling had become somewhat mutual.</br>    https://d.maxfile.ro/qigxsmxdal.web<wbr>m<br> audio version </br></wbr>  can a prostitute be moe?  <br> 1080p </br>   funishit   Is this episode early? I remember it releasing it later last week or is my brain turbocucking?  <br>Funi's oficcial anouncement and schedule says they release on saturdays. <br>Underwater are making fansubs for this, released one day after the japanese broadcast.<br>But it's already been two times that Funi have released the episode early for some reason (last week was on thursday. This week, on Wednesday)<br>I don't know what's going on at Funi</br></br></br></br>  <br> and the series is bad in every single aspect <br>are you gonna explain about that boi? i swear if this is about fujobait shitpost again...</br></br>  Waiting for Daiz's release.    <br>Funimation? Need a goddamn vpn for that.<br><br>As usual with funi I'll wait for the inevitable bluray rip.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, respect those whores.</br>    <br> 1.02mb <br>Can you stop that? Thanks.</br></br>  <br>I hear you anon.<br><br>Consider Claymore. Or Berserk. Or Twelve Kingdoms.<br><br>Adaptations that stop in the middle are EVIL no matter how good they are.<br><br>Though I did pick up the Twelve Kingdoms light novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you when Sabo confirmed his own death?<br>Also Fujitora a best thread  Secret Rebecca a irrelevant thread </br>  <br>A traumatizing flashback could take all his goofiness away though</br>  <br>I thought Fuji meant that it's perfectly fine that he has to quit being marine thanks to this</br>  <br>he's  hot </br>  <br>That works both way. Either he just wanted to hear akainu saying "you won't set foot in any naval base in the world" or "bring strawhat's and law's heads."</br>  Am I the only one who feels the comedy from early One Piece has disappoeared? There used to be genuinely funny moments that weren't just silly faces.  Ok i think i might have fucked up a bit. I dont know if anyone can help me, but i while back i was browsing /a/ and was looking for a new show to watch, and i came across Fate/stay unlimited blade works, i stupidly watch both seasons and when i came back to /a/ i realized this show is like the 5th installment of the series ( or the 5th grail war? ) <br><br><br>Did i fuck up? is there a particular order i should watch them in, if so what order? Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know what the true Crimson Moons goals even were? He responded to the Earth's cry for help but rather than just straight up helping and offering himself as a model for the true ancestors , he asked to live on Earth in exchange. Hell, CM wasn't even described as actively protecting the environment from humans, he just wandered the planet challenging random people and plotting to take over the earth for himself,making allies,etc.</br>  <br>They call it a dream. But many things in the Nasuverse are called dreams without actually being dreams. CCC, the Alices, to bring some examples.<br><br>Archetype takes over Arc's body at the beginning, and she wouldn't need to do that within a dream as seen in KT. When Arc shows up in the last battle Archetype asks her whether she has a tendency to sleepwalk, then Arc responds that's her line, which suggests when Arc is sleeping Archetype shows up. <br><br>Tatari? There is not a single reference to Archetype being a result of Tatari. That's not how Tatari works in the first place. It was for the night because Arc is going to wake up at dawn.<br><br> If something being the strongest was all that made a type <br><br>I said before that she is the Earth itself incarnated. Did you play her route?<br><br> What does the girl have anything to do with Arc? <br><br>Nasu said she IS Arc in that universe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rather than giving answers the newest material raises more questions. AE mentions something in her epilogue, about how CM would be disappointed about his goal not coming true.</br>  <br>You must first read DDD and Notes, the chinese fan translation.</br>  <br>Exactly, if I'm not mistaken AE was referring to his disappointment that the Earth would not return to its former state before humans (AE was going to kill herself and take everyone with her just a moment ago afterall) but if he wanted it to return to it's former state...Why didn't he just TRY TO DO THAT the first time while he was on Earth rather than wandering the Earth and playing around?</br>  Ebina's episode (episode 02) in almost 4 hours, get in.  <br>He must be getting told all the time in other shows based on adaptation that he want to relieve the feel himself as one of the elitist this time.</br>  I'm reading the manga and quick question, are AC bills in Japan really high or something? It seems a lot of them complain about how expensive the AC is.<br><br>While my electricity bills aren't exactly the cheapest thing on the planet, I've never been concerned about the AC all that much.</br></br>  <br>He should just tape her in Hamster mode and post it on the internet.</br>  <br><br>Stay buttblasted, secondary scum.</br></br>  <br>GIVE ME BOTH OF THOSE CREATURES</br>  What is love /a/?  <br>is when the dick become hard?</br>  Mashiro a shit.
