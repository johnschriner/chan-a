[ Would you brush your sister's teeth /a/?  <br>Of course you would</br>  No because i don't even talk to my sister much also i have no plans to do lewd things like that either since that's disgusting.  <br>No, but I'd brush yours.</br>  <br>My teeth? But anon, I'm a boy!</br>    <br><br>sound<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter to me. As long as there is a hole that needs to be brushed by my rod of justice, it will be brushed.</br>  I still wonder what happened to Oral Hygiene Bro  <br>I don't have a sister but I've brushed my dog's teeth. Does that count?</br>  <br><br><br>Do they end up fucking in the future?</br></br></br>  I don't like my sister very much  I do actually, since she still can't do it herself without eating the paste..  <br>That could either mean you're going to have sex with her<br>Or you're going to kill her</br></br>  <br>I can't brush an ant's teeth, dude.</br>  <br>but you can brush your aunt's teeth</br>  I don't even brush my own teeth.  <br>That's fucking disgusting. How do you kiss other people? Don't your teeth hurt/bleed?<br><br>That is if you're telling the truth.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never kissed anyone. My teeth are fine save for a few cavities which don't bother me all that much</br>   Doing things for other people  <br>No thanks.</br>  <br>No but I sure as fuck would for Karen</br>  <br>I suggest for long term health that you begin to brush your teeth gently. Once they stop bleeding from regular brushing continue with regular flossing.<br><br>Start visiting a dentist if you have the money or if it's covered by your job.<br><br>You're doing yourself a favor man, your teeth are so important.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. Araragi just walks Crab home gently.</br>  <br>I honestly never did figure out what the fuck that was supposed to mean. Is it supposed to be something about a conversational style?</br>  <br>arafagi has shit taste though</br>  <br>Which is why Monkey gets Bee all to herself!</br>  Kinda off topic but how important is to wear your retainers after having braves removed?  <br>Honestly I always figured him for some sort of paranoid schizophrenic</br>  Best Monogatari coming through.  <br>Yes but not with a brush</br>  <br>*second best</br>  <br>Me too. Damn, I need to know</br>  <br>I wonder if Kaiki has a cute butt.</br>  Already have  <br>Why would I?</br>  <br>That's fucking cute as shit.</br>  <br>very<br>if you don't your teeth will just go back to being crooked and all that shit you went through wearing braces in the first place will have been for nothing.</br></br>  <br>It's entirely dependent on how long you had your braces on for. I wore my retained for only a couple of months, it's been a year now and my teeth have been fine. <br><br>Problem is though, if I want to put my retainer back on the pain would be intense. Enough to make a pansy like me to tear up a bit. Just make it a habit and wear it at night. Don't be stupid like me.</br></br></br>  UPDATE FROM HYGEINEBRO WHEN?  <br>What happened to the toothpaste?</br>  <br> mfw I've been wearing my retainers every night like faggot dentist said but my teeth have slightly moved still </br>  <br>As someone who has a sort of obsession with teeth, I must say this makes me cringe. Take care of your teeth if nothing else. You will regret it so fucking much in the future, even if you have a healthy diet.<br><br><br>Very. Your teeth will revert. I think I'm currently supposed to wear them at night only, but my shit ortho hasn't instructed me to so I still wear them 24/7. Wait until your ortho tells you to wear them at night and then do so. Problem with me is that from wearing them so much, they get loose and out of shape, which is what I'm dealing with. Follow your ortho's instruction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Knocked her up.</br>  I mean, I do remember you douchebags from my dreams, it's just that my dreams are never particularly coherent and all involve the same basic themes, which are being chased around empty buildings or forgetting to turn in assignments at school, etc. You know, kind of like the same sorts of dreams everybody in the world has sometimes. The only thing that's different for me is that my dreams tend to be nightmares more often than not  <br> You will regret it so fucking much in the future, even if you have a healthy diet. <br>That is, if you don't take care of them, I should say.</br></br>  <br>Yes, if my sister was Bee-Chan</br>  My sister is 3DPD, so no.  Does /a/ want to have their teeth brushed?  <br>That obviously goes without saying.</br>   mfw Imouto resting her head on my shoulder at the family reunion today <br>Shit was akward.</br>  <br>Why would she?</br>  is Koyomi affectionate with his mom too? Does he have a huge Oedipus complex with her?  <br>I don't know. <br>First time it happened in years. <br>I just tried not to blush. <br>This just adds to the list of accidently wearing my T-Shirt after shower, showing herself in pantsu multiple times. Hanging out in my room when she's bored, trying to get information about my sex life</br></br></br></br>  <br> That is, if you don't take care of them <br> a few cavities which don't bother me all that much <br>DOUBT Âè£</br></br></br>  <br> Knocked her up. <br>Bull fucking shit, I haven't seen the dude in years</br></br>  <br>Lol.

Endless pain, increased when eating teeth breaking, cutting you, falling out and much more.</br>  <br>I was quoting the retard anon. I brush every day and go to the dentist every 6 months.</br>  <br> So how far did you go with the girl you had last year? <br>Do you think I'm gonna tell you?<br> Hehe, I'm also gonna tell you how far I went so far  <br>Silence <br> C'mon, tell me  <br>Let me guess, you didn't do anything so far<br> you got me there, anon-kun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of sister doesn't swallow her brother's toothpaste</br>  <br>What the fuck how do I read this post?</br>  <br>Oh.

I don't know, because Gero is a fucking genius? Why do you /v/-tier faggots take DBZ so seriously?<br><br>Also, Android wasn't that much stronger than Frieza.</br></br>  <br>Frieza went from ssj level to super saiyan god super saiyan level by training for 4 months.</br>  <br>I dunno, how much stronger was Cell compares to Frieza?</br>  <br> Android wasn't that much stronger than Frieza. <br>I though Trunks couldn't defeat the androids, but he killed mecha Frieza pretty easily.</br></br>  <br>Earth has better miniaturization technology than Freeza's empire (they had no equivalent to the capsules). So making better prosthetics isn't really surprising.</br>  <br>I don't know. How did Bulma make a shrinking watch?<br><br><br>It didn't exist at the time.<br><br>Freeza doesn't do more than what he thinks is necessary. He honestly thought that he was stronger than Goku on Namek and that his cyborg body would still be stronger than Goku later; both of which he was wrong on. Why didn't he train for another week to master Golden Freeza? He's a lazy motherfucker compared to Goku.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Frieza exists to prove a point, that he is the strongest natural villain.<br>Cell was an android, and Buu was created with magic.<br>Frieza was just a ridiculously strong prodigy who never thought to train.</br></br>  Super powerful androids from Earth? Who could have possibly seen this coming?  <br>I still think that Cell was the most dangerous of all given how he had the potential to become stronger just like the saiyans or Freeza, along with the power of regeneration. Meanwhile the villains after him (Buu, Baby, Super 17, the Dragons) had a fixed (if vast) amount of power.</br>  <br>Right, but like Vegeta with his pride, he thought his Perfect form was unbeatable. It wouldn't make sense for a supposedly perfect being to train.</br>  <br>That's pretty ironic given how, if you think about that, having infinite growing potential looks like the trait only a perfect being would possess, and a perfect being would push said perfection to its limits. <br>The z warriors were lucky as shit.</br></br>  <br>Why would the Vegeta psyche overcome the Goku psyche?</br>  Is creayus the most dedicated and loyal artist?

Was it not supposed to be released a couple of days ago?  <br> I was only pretending to be retarded </br>  <br> becoming you're waifu <br>Now that's doing it right.</br></br>  MORE PORN  <br>I fucking love the Alexander.</br>  <br>It's not bait.</br>    Creayus is amazing, but when you think about it, if anybody deserves eternal devotion and art, it's CC      <br> symmetry <br> black-white contrast <br>Simply the best.</br></br></br>    <br>Goddamnit <br> It looks like she's spreading shit out of her ass </br></br>    CC and Lulu is probably the best OTP of any series  (besides ichiruki )  <br>How can you say you love if you won't even eat her shit?</br>      <br>CC still enjoys the earthly pleasures so sex would probably still feel good. The fact that she can still regenerate means that she'll never get fucked to the point of boredom.</br>  <br>Does she regenerate her hymen everytime?</br>    <br>I don't know. It actually feels like if she didn't, I'd be feeling weird about it, like "What's wrong with this eternally hot 500 year old woman? Why the fuck is she a virgin? Something wrong with her?" kinda thing.</br>  <br>The dance seen with the shaking boobs was good too.</br>  <br>She probably no longer has a hymen. She had years of using the Love Me Geass until she got killed. I don't think she reverted back to her virgin self.</br>  <br><br>My first thought as well.</br></br>        <br>Actually I think the guy who posted the youtube video is just a summerfag.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure that's great and all if you ignore that her Geass destroyed her ability to love</br></br>  <br>I've always dreamed of what being Rei in Mogudans doujins would feel like.</br>  <br> her Geass destroyed her ability to love <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>Sorta.</br>  <br>Her Geass was all about getting loved by all. After so much love shown to her, she grew numb to that emotion.</br>    <br><br>until she met Lulu</br></br>  All this talk makes me really hope they got something planned after Akito    <br>Love isn't sex. Sex is a physical function of the body. You can enjoy sex even without love.</br>  <br><br> Literally an Asuka clone, not even a clone, IS ASUKA </br></br>    Lovely.  <br>Pretty much this. But I wouldn't want to meet with her batshit insane ex whom she only let to fuck her to manipulate him.</br>    <br>Pretty awesome this</br>     mfw there is no kallen only artists like creayus with CC       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127303505 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127303416 <br> deleting your post to put a spoiler on a barely even /e/-tier image <br>Why bother?</br></br></br>    <br>I really don't know, I would censor it, but I decided against it since as you said it's barely even /e/-tier, so I decided to just put a spoiler on it when reposting it. <br><br>Also /a/ is an extremely Christian friendly board these days, and it's also Summer, that's why I considered it.</br></br></br>  <br>not that guy, but can't ever be too safe.</br>  <br>What are they doing?</br>  Speaking about Code Geass, that alternate ending doujin was best  <br>Kissing, obviously.</br>  <br>Lulu spilled some tea on his lap and CC is cleaning it up.</br>    CC has basically the perfect personality for a gf.<br><br>None of the retarded delusions and expectations that most women hold. <br>Jesus, why can't real women be like her.</br></br></br>        Never heard of the artist before but that's some dedication given to a single character. <br>Is C.C. her waifu?</br>    <br>There's plenty of level headed people around, anon.<br>You can't seriously hope to come across anything even remotely as perfect as a fictional character in meatspace, though.</br></br>    <br> C.C. as the best starter. <br>Nice</br></br>            <br>Yes, of course. She's shown some of her C.C. and Lulu merch on twitter before.<br><br>She also made a nice daki of C.C.</br></br></br>        <br>Why doesn't she draw stuff with C.C. and a cute 2D version of herself?<br><br> That's what I would do. </br></br></br>  <br>She's just that dedicated to the ship.</br>      <br>Must be nice being able to draw your waifu doin all kinds of cute stuff. Maybe one day I'll start doing it for my waifu since she really needs more fanart. Though I suppose drawing on pc with those tablets is kinda expensive.</br>    <br> Akihito <br>Would there be a controversy if that were actually his name?</br></br>  <br>whos your waifu? maybe she already has more fanart than you think</br>    This girl/woman drawing CC and Lelouch is cute, but a bit creepy, in a way.<br> She is most likely fat or ugly or both </br>  <br>There is, it's just that there isn't much that I like. If I want to start drawing her I'll probably should just use a pencil and paper at first anyway.</br>  <br> thinking drawing animu will be that easy <br>Aww, to be that young and cute!</br></br>  <br>She had a picture where you could see her face (cosplay of ) before she deleted it. She looked pretty cute, definitely not fat.</br>  <br>Goddamn, I thought that the artist being pretty was impossible. Anyone save the pic?</br>  Alright time to build my CC folder  <br>I actually used to when I was still in school but that was long ago but I always had a bit of a knack for drawing.</br>  <br>No pic, but it only showed some of her face and I'm sure it was photoshopped to hell. Not a good indicator of what she really looks like.</br>  <br>I asked the same thing earlier, I can't be the only person who insta-saves everything from her twitter. In case it helkps anyone narrow it down, she posted it between January 28 and February 16.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gangbang doujins!</br>  Why haven't you guys started drawing for you're waifu?  BEST thread.<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>What about them?<br><br>I don't think CC would be able to be mindbroken in gangbang since she's already had so much sex, all the faceless men are just amateurs.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying they're pretty hot and should be in any anon's collection.</br>      How does Shi-tzu have so much god-tier high quality art            I-I think I need to watch Code Geass again.    <br>I have it all downloaded. Should I also rewatch it?</br>      <br>If you wish. Most people already have.</br>      <br>I hope /a/ does some sort of webcast or weekly rewatch to celebrate the 10th anniversary</br>    <br><br> hey kid wanna /cc/? </br></br>    <br> that realization that CC did that with Mao </br>        <br> to celebrate the 10th anniversary <br>No way; you are shitting me.<br><br> Original run October 5, 2006 ‚Äì July 28, 2007 <br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  JIBUN WO   tfw we won't have another TV series by Taniguchi     <br><br>In general terms, he just did Maria. That was fine. <br><br>Of course, Taniguchi might eventually make a Code Geass movie but that's uncertain.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Maria is an adaption and he's not the author.  It doesn't count </br>  I love CC but wholly dislike Lelouch. Is this normal?  <br>Maria was pretty different from the manga. It does count.</br>  <br>No. You are an unusual person.</br>  <br><br> he doesn't worship for the true king of brittania </br></br>  <br>Yes, it's normal. I also love CC, but could care less for Lelouch.</br>  <br>I think it's odd since he's what made the show so entertaining</br>        <br><br>It's even stranger when you realize he and C.C. had some pretty nice banter with each other. Compatible personalities even.</br></br>  <br> ChaikaChaika </br>  <br>Getting called a dirty virgin and being told to sleep on the floor and sulking like a little shit is not nice banter.</br>    <br> dirty virgin <br>Implicitly, maybe, but nothing that literal.<br> <br>She does tease him a lot, but it's not so unilateral as time goes on.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Pillow: "That smell"</br>      I want fuck c.c's ass  <br>I just now C.C is supposed to represent her ass cheeks.</br>    <br>Exactly....</br>  <br>It fits.</br>          Thanks for the pictures Anon, time to see All Code Geass. See ya  <br>One is spreading cum on their ass and the other, shit</br>    <br>what shit she's cosplaying here?</br>  <br>TYBC</br>  <br>Isn't it Black Dog? He's been drawing Sailor Moon doujins for more than 20 years already.<br><br>I think in one of his afterword panels, he was ranting that his eyesight was getting bad these days as well.</br></br></br>  I want to tongue C.C.'s butthole  <br><br>It smells like five day old melted cheese</br></br>  <br>I love cheese</br>    <br><br>I can imagine Lulu plowing her ass so hard.<br><br>They are canon OTP in the show anyway. Kallen got cucked so hard</br></br></br></br>  What's this doing on page 10?  <br><br>because Code Geass ended 10 years ago and the normies don't have CC as their waifu</br></br>  <br><br>Their loss...</br></br>  It's a shame we didn't get to see CC pilot the Lancelot some more.  <br><br>half of /a/ are jew cucks who fap to lolis and not glorious pizzabutt.</br></br>    Creayus' doujins are so underrated, they rarely get scanned <br><br>This is just criminal.</br></br>  Or even just the Akatsuki.  Or the Gawain.  <br>Gawain was GOAT Knightmare.</br>  <br>Agreed</br>    I haven't seen anything Code geass in ages since the finale years ago on /a/<br><br>Can anyone fill me in what happened since then? I saw /m/ talking about it and I'm so fucking lost. Is there a new season or something?</br></br>  <br>There are some OVA movies about the war in the EU between R1 and R2.</br>    <br>It was too good looking for this world, fucking hell why are most flying knightmares such ugly abominations.</br>  <br>It's the only Knightmare that made flying look good. Everything else should've stuck with rollerskates.</br>  <br>We had the Gawain-based Gareths in R2. They weren't as cool though.</br>  <br>Oh, that makes sense now<br><br>Here, have a custom C.C kamui for Fire Emblem Fates I made. No accessories or facial marks yet, they seem too hard to choose from so I went vanilla</br></br></br>  Are there any specific screenshots anyone wants me to post?  <br> Seedlet </br>  Why do I still think of C.C. as pure even though she's had sex with probably hundreds of men?<br><br>I'm typically a purityfag but I would marry C.C. in a heartbeat. How does she do it</br></br>  This guy's been pretty dedicated to Stalker Girl from Amagami.<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>499426</wbr></br>  <br>Because you expect it from someone who's lived for 500 years.</br>  <br>She is a loyal waifu; she has been with other men because she's older than 5 grandmas.</br>  <br> Jesus, why can't real women be like her. <br>I used to legitimately ask myself this question during and after Code Geass ended. I came to terms that it just doesn't, and it does suck but that's the beauty of 2D. At least that exists</br></br>  <br>Ass.</br>  <br>There might be some new Code Geass next year so be ready for that. Emphasis on might.</br>  <br> tfw women will always be shits when they are beautiful and ugly hags by the time they get a clue <br><br>Youth is wasted on the young. C.C. is a drop dead gorgeous 500+ year old, of course she is perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she will never cuck you. She has lived longer than any other woman in the world and would not be impressed by petty bravado or a big dick, she had become so jaded about living that she yearned for death.<br><br>That's why it's so much more significant when she chooses you. The man she chooses is the man who could protect her smile.<br><br>Truly the purest waifu known to man.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't have a waifu, but if I did it would probably be C.C. I'm also not an immortal witch, but if I were I'd totally give exiled princes magic powers.  Dick status: muh.  <br>no it was ufotable</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Do you think that they are going to combine Speed World - Neo and Cross Over?<br><br>Maybe by materializing ramps they could use those ramps to jump on the platforms that float in the air, and they could get action card by grabbing them while the are drving. past them.</br></br>  <br>Yuya would have no chance of performing motorcycle stunts, even on AUTOPILOT. Now Jack, on the other hand...<br> STANDBY </br></br>  <br>Jack with kids is always adorable for some reason. I really wanted him and Carly to have kids for that reason alone.</br>  Monmusu thread. Discuss.                <br>Cute as fuck<br><br><br>I don't like this one, Papi isn't retarded. She just forgets things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The real question is, what would she play? For some reason, I imagine her playing the handbells.</br>  <br>Triangle, cowbell, clapping, singing "la la la" or the song that never ends</br>  Just a little over a week.  <br>Oh shit, even more new images? Is that all of them?</br>  <br><br>I will never get over how cute this is.</br></br>  <br><br> Papi isn't retarded. <br><br>That's pretty debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When is going to air the ATX version?</br>  <br><br> Animated-Miia actually has the proper amount of length and mass to her tail. </br></br>  <br>From July 7, every Tuesday 24: 30 ~ repeat broadcast: every Thursday 4:30 p.m. to 17:00 „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄevery Sunday 20:30 to 21:00 „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄevery Monday 8:30 to 09:00</br>  <br>GET HYPE</br>  <br>Miia best cuddler</br>  <br>Can't wait for animeonlyfags and people claiming waifus to start flooding the threads.</br>  <br><br>We've waited so long for this day, someone to take the pain away. No fan will ever have to say, we'll never get an anime!</br></br>  <br>Papi signing would be cute.<br> Because I'm Papi! <br> Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof! <br> Because I'm Papi! </br></br></br></br>  Zombina's the best  <br>For some reason I think Miia would fit a lot better as an idol singer than a DJ. I really can't see her as a club music or hip hop kind of girl.</br>  Anyone knows what does it says here?    <br> Current points <br> World/overall rank <br> Papi(or your girl, for others) rank. <br><br>Below that is world top three, followed by your girl's top three.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hnnnnggggh</br>  <br>Yoj got brain problems, son.</br>  <br><br>Miia's cute little efly-ears almost look a little too narrow and pointy in these screen-shots compared to the Manga.</br></br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>I hope it will be as funny as the manga.<br><br><br>I would choose Lala if she were available. It would be even better if the other girls outside the harem were available too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I would need even more accounts.</br>  <br>A drawfag should draw Cerea with the Megamilk T-shirt on. Blushing of course.</br>  Why does papi's ass fluctuate in size like someone's panic paper bag?  Did anyone find where the web shorts are on the nip site?  <br><br>Is anybody else disappointed that Cera doesn't continually produce milk, unlike the Minotauress?<br><br>I totally wouldn't mind milking her if she were my waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm o'k with her not having milk all the time. Just means you can only milk her at special times(when having new born Centaur baby) PLus it makes it more special when the baby goes to sleep and you get your fill of milk strait from the tap.</br>  <br>Human milk tastes horrible and I assume that since she has human breasts she has human milk.</br>  <br><br>Cathyl also has human breasts and they say her milk tastes amazing.</br></br>  <br><br> Human milk tastes horrible <br><br>......How would you know that?.....</br></br></br></br>  <br>Experience</br>  <br>Mero said it was thick. Since Mero knows lewd I'll take her word for it.</br>   Tio, sweety, you can't take the dolphin home.

The animated PV we've seen doesn't look as bad as the initial key visual, but it still is nothing compared to the manga.</br>  <br>What is this, please explain in excruciating detail.</br>  <br>The truth is she's a  Dumpire </br>    <br>AND SEXY POSES!</br>  <br><br><br>It's not JUICY enough in detail. It needs more OOMPH.</br></br></br>  <br>How about you just start reading. Here's a good introduction chapter:http://kissmanga.com/Manga/<wbr>Jitsu-wa-Watashi-wa/Vol-004-Ch-028-<wbr>-Let-s-Go-Grab--Em-Limited-Editions<wbr>-?id=204308</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> hair down <br>I need more of this in my life</br></br>  <br>Why, and yet again, why not</br>  <br><br>Miia's tail length vary scene by scene<br><br>calling it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many images do I have to post before you start reading?</br>  <br>WHY'D YOU TELL HIM THE SOURCE!? IT WAS FUN TO TEASE!</br>  <br>Shit. I thought he knew and wanted reasons to read it.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>But l know now, it was all part of my master plan.<br>I bet nobody remembers this was a monster tiddies discussion. Papi best grill. That is all.</br></br>  This thread is suffering from a serious lack of best girl.  <br>I've seen so much Cerea that I forget that she always has it in a ponytail<br><br>Girls with really long, straight hair are my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>She has two pony tails.</br>  <br>You have goo taste anon. <br><br>Oh shit. You are right.</br></br></br>  <br> goo taste </br>      <br> goo taste </br>  So all Shirou needed is a girlfriend and he couldn't have become Archer?  Pretty much.<br><br>A girlfriend, and get someone pregnant. Shirou would never hurt a child by abandoning someone. If you play Heaven's Feel, he pretty much abandons his SEIGI NO MIKATA shit.</br></br>  No, he needed a girlfriend who realized something was wrong with him and actively tried to fix him.  <br>No, all he needed was the sense to read the fine print and thoroughly reflect on it before entering into a deal he couldn't opt out of.</br>  <br>Or maybe a psychiatrist?</br>  <br>Those don't exist in anime.</br>  He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA. He needs someone to take some of the pressure off of him and make him reflect on his own life.  <br>They do, faggot.</br>  <br>Accidently deleted this.<br><br>It is the same way Shiki needs Mikiya to be her limiter as shown in movie 2 and 7.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think they exist in anime or japan, period. Neon Genesis Evangelion's plot would have been fixed easily by a decent child psychologist/child care specialist by giving Shinji and Asuka attention and care.<br><br>Shirou however, is a tough case. No psychologist would have detected any problem for a while, he just looks like like a hardworking, decent kid.</br></br></br>  <br>A waifu will save your laifu.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter what or are you some kind of braindead moron?<br>The point is that he's not going to break down anymore.</br></br>  <br>Wait I thought he did become archer he just didn't hate it</br>  <br>He won't become Archer, he'll surpass Archer.</br>  <br>Eh, yeah pretty much. Though he needs a top tier level waifu, if they are too low level he might just drop his ideals and join a life of mediocrity.</br>  <br>Super Saiyan Archer!?</br>  <br>What if you lack both waifu and life? Will you become some kind of revenant and wander the Earth forever?</br>  <br> Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter <br><br>They are saying he is going to go down the same/similar path but in a way that will not cause the world to contract with him. Hell Shirou at this point is a shit ton stronger than Archer was at his age by the fact alone that his hair is not white. He is going surpass Archer.</br></br></br>  * The very final scene<br>It's a scene that you'll understand if you review it again, but it was easily misunderstood so here's the excerpt from the script.<br><br>Wasteland scene<br>"After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland.<br>Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt.<br>Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking).<br>Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope.<br>Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait.<br>The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance.<br>(To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)"<br><br>He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point.<br><br>From Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be differences - it's an alternate world obviously - but he will still become a counter guardian and be bitter about his decision or want to do things differently.</br>  <br><br> that will not cause the world to contract with him <br><br>What does that mean?<br><br><br><br>Where further is there for him to even go? If he just becomes a counter guardian again, isn't that a dead end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Emiya is such a beautifully constructed character.<br>Nasu really got lucky writing this guy.</br></br>  <br>HF is crap.</br>  <br> He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA <br><br>That girlfriend died not long after his HGW was over.<br><br>Many suspect that this "girlfriend" was Ilya. Ilya is fated to die a few weeks after the Holy Grail War whatever its outcome which fits and also how Archer acts towards Ilya in F/SN and how he reacts whenever she is in trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>You have to create a contract to become a Counter Guardian. There's basically a point where Shirou will have to say yes or no to living an eternity going around killing people.<br><br>With the knowledge he gained from Archer though, he might not.<br><br> Where further is there for him to even go? <br><br>Shirou is already miles ahead of Archer in terms of abilities. Literally over a decade if you want to go by source books. With Rin there with him, he can do a lot better than some guy wandering around aimlessly with no power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those weren't real psychiatrists, they were escaped mental patients hiding from the law.</br>  Did archer just fucking retain his memories and debunk World Material?  <br>No, the point is that he is resolved to continue his ideals despite knowing and readily admitting their limitations and discrepancies.<br><br>Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian.<br><br>UBW Shirou can happily go after his ideals safe in the knowledge of what their conclusion could be and with support from Rin. Its highly likely he will end up surpassing Archer and could arrive at an entirely different end entirely.<br><br>The Shirou who reached Avalon in last Episode is strongly suspected to be Fate Shirou, who pursued his ideals whole heartedly didnt become Archer, so why would UBW Shirou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he won't. His end MAY be tragic but it won't be one that results in him becoming a CG. Why the fuck would Alaya try to contract with him with the fact he is going to go down a path preventing that from ever happening.<br><br><br>Shirou will be much stronger than Archer was when he was alive and be able to do more than before thus eliminating the need of Alaya to show up and try to offer him a way out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's brain problems aren't even something that can be recognized as even remotely realistic in the first place.</br>  <br>Oh shit he did. Fate is ruined.</br>  <br>That he did.<br><br>I think Nasu pulled his writing together after completely scrapping the original F/SN story (Fate/Protoype) and arrived at the Shirou and Archer duality.</br></br></br>  <br>You're crap</br>  <br> Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian. <br>He did, he only became bitter about it AFTER he became a counter guardian, holy shit it's absurd how many times I have to explain this to you fuckers.</br></br>  <br>Thats what I said you silly fuck.</br>  <br>I don't know about Shirou, but my case was one of those situations where I would be instantly killed if I ever got a girlfriend or a job :/</br>  <br>Survivor's guilt is a legitimate medical diagnosis that falls under PTSD.</br>  Can Shirou just pull UBW out of his ass whenever he wants now?  UBW Shirou/Archer will be fine as long as he avoids becoming a counter guardian.  <br>Yes he has Rin support.</br>  <br> A psychiatrist <br> help Shirou <br><br>Shirou is a level of crazy that I highly doubt even exists in real life.<br><br>He is so utterly mind broken from his sense of self and ego dying in the fire just moments before his body would have died, had it not been for Kiritsugu.<br><br>Im not sure what a Psychiatrist could do to help him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The more important question is, Does shirou actually need to do the chant to summon UBW or is that just show boating?</br>  <br>Survivor's Guilt is but ONE aspect of how fucked up Shirou is in the head.<br><br>The man literally lost his sense of self. By all rights he sould be a vegetable but he latched onto something and made it his purpose.</br></br></br>  <br> Start chanting UBW in England <br> Everybody are having a giggle on his bloody broken English </br></br>  <br>I think he needs to at least do the abbreviated chant.</br>  <br>Fortunately, every single one of the HUGE number of people who were literally, legally, and morally required to kill me in that situation seemed to have forgotten about that for some reason</br>  <br>Damn</br>  <br>Words are powerful and give meaning to what is being created/used. Reason why Servants say the name of their NP when they use it.</br>  <br>Then they burn him at the stake for having a RM</br>  <br> Gil: GATE OF BABYLON!!! <br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>That reason being, I am, in fact, an actual member of ISIS, and Arabic technology is extremely powerful</br>  <br>They won't burn him at a stake but he'll probably be captured and experimented on for having a RM.</br>  <br>As long as he stays hooked up to Rin as a mana battery, yes.<br><br>Not that he's ever going to need it again. Rin-powered projections are more than enough for most non-magus human enemies. It's unlikely he'll ever actually up against something at the caliber of a servant again.</br></br></br>  Why can't Shirou trace mana and magic circuits for himself.  <br> Does shirou actually need to do the chant to summon UBW or is that just show boating? <br>Yes, it's actually an 8 line incantation.<br>It's the same as Rin's german mumbo jumbo.<br>Archer apparently got it down to 2 or 3 lines after becoming a servant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them do. Berserker says nothing yet he has his. It depends on the weapon/magic. UBW needs it to create it from within him and make it a reality.</br>  <br>Yes. And if he continues as Rin's pupil, he will be able to manifest UBW on his own prana supply after a few years.</br>  To be honest, there's no way in hell it's ending well. Yuzu and Yugo have become friends, and I'm sure he's going to teach her how to ride a motorcycle, which is like a +10 relationship modifier. <br><br>Yuya and Yugo will fight, they'll both go berserk because LOLDRAGONS, and Yuzu will end up traumatized and/or injured. <br><br>That's assuming none of the other lore comes out, but I'm sure it will. Worst case scenario the entire city gets destroyed by the dickass gods and goddesses. Fucking Yuya and Yuzu, they ruin everything. Leo was right.</br></br></br></br>   capture Shirou who teared King of Heroes a new one <br><br>Top kek<br>He is a shitty mage but one of the best combatants in nasu verse that are human</br></br></br>  <br>Tracing is heresy, it ignores the equivalent exchange rule.</br>  <br>GoB isnt something that you can "power up". Its pretty static.</br>  <br>As far as humans go he is top tier. Only top tier combat specced mages or Dead Apostle Ancestors could ever touch him, and DAAs aint even human anymore.</br>  So when does Shirou learn about broken phantasma's and when does he start using a bow?<br><br>Also can Shirou/archer make all the projections in UBW broken phantasma's?</br></br>  <br>He still becomes acher. Did you even watch the damn serie.</br>  <br>Shirou is worth too much as something to study to just burn at the stake. He would just get a sealing designation.</br>  <br>Looks like Nasu just got<br><br>B U S T E D<br>U<br>S<br>T<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats what I said.</br>  <br> He still becomes acher. Did you even watch the damn serie. <br>Did you?<br><br> People think Nasu is that cruel of a person <br>He isn't Uroburchi</br></br></br></br></br>  is this chart correct? I'm might be forgetting some of the pre-order only routes but besides that this is all of them, right?  <br>I know. I was expanding on what you said</br>  <br> thinking the world of mages is weak <br><br>The Mage Association and the Church has some strong enforcers/executions. Kirei is considered low tier in the grand scheme of things and even he would be an extremely hard battle for Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good retcon.</br>  <br>So he'll get frozen instead of getting burned.</br>  <br>Yes, they can.<br><br>All they do is overload the NP with prana. Its simple and brutally effective, if you have NPs to spare.</br></br></br>  Imagine if Luvia ever found out the shit that went down in Fuyuki.<br><br>She would pay Rin anything for Sherou's seed.</br></br>  <br>World Material is now uncanon. <br>DEBUNKED<br>E<br>B<br>U<br>N<br>K<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Knock that autistic shit off.</br>  yeah but why no cool long ass fights :(  Wait.. in London, it is okay for a pupil to bang his teacher?  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes. <br><br>Where else would she go when she is low on mana?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's London.</br>  <br>kill yourself please</br>  <br>God I will never forget the stream thread.<br><br>Everyone flipped their shit as people were expecting the normal true ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Truly not exploiting the system to bring her guy with her.</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br> expecting the worst Japanese in the world to have any sense of shame or decency </br>  <br>Agreed. It's better this way.</br>  <br>I cried, shit was amazing. Took me a whole day for it to sink in.</br>  <br>He's a CG not a heroic spirit <br><br>He's like Arthur in fact UBW was supposed to be a direct contrast where Shirou is alone on a hill just like Saber and both come to understand and accept their decisions</br></br></br>  <br>So what now CGs retain memories?</br>  <br><br>BD's when? I actually held myself back and haven't watched UBW at all cause I want to enjoy it in BD quality.</br></br>  <br>Maximum Over Archer</br>  <br>October I believe.</br>  If Shirou makes a contract with the world to become a CG, would that mean there are two different Emiya Shirou in the Throne, or do they fuse into a Super EMIYA?  <br><br><br><br>This reminds me of this Mexican girl I met in the mental hospital here who was legitimately convinced that she could get anyone to do anything for her, because the ENTIRE STAFF was playing along with her. Frankly, this makes me feel terrible whenever i see it. We literally drove a LOT of people actually insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It really was a great fucking ending. UFOtable continue to show that they fucking love the source material that they are adapting and it isnt just buisness.<br><br>I mean it had Glastonbury, Rin and Luvia's TM April Fools Wrestling, Waver as an Adult. It was 10/10.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what's the deal with Waver? He just work there now?</br>  <br>By the way, this isn't some sort of coded language, I'm talking about an actual, real live Mexican girl in the actual hospital here in Seattle</br>  <br> October <br>Fuck. Oh well, I waited all these months, I guess I can wait a few more.</br></br>  <br>Yes that's what Extra's Archer is.</br>  <br>So when I tell people "you are mentally ill, seek help", I'm NOT joking or exaggerating in any way.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>Just watch it now, nothing to lose.</br>  <br>Yep. He is a teacher there.<br><br>As a magus, he is low tier and completely forgettable. As a teacher of other magi he is one of the best.<br><br>Its a constant source of frustration for him. He is shit but he excells in making people born with natual talent and big crests even bette.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where the hell did Archer just retain his memories?</br>  <br>After the credits.</br>  <br>And thats why we call him Waver Cuckvet.</br>  <br> That girlfriend died not long after his HGW was over. <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>One of Rin's "flashbacks" where she see's Archer's past.<br><br>She states that he had a lover but she died not long after the HGW.</br></br></br>  <br>They always have. Saber remembers the 4th HGW.</br>  <br>Nasu magic is done by self hypnotism/suggestion, and the chants are the requirement.<br><br>Supposedly, more chants= bigger magic.<br>Meanwhile, magics from the crest can circumvent chanting.<br><br>Shits from F/SN though, who knows how many Nasu retconns or exceptions have happened since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to have sex with Caster's laser beams.  <br>Saber is not a CG though</br>  <br>Enuma Elish nigga.</br>  <br>She never says she dies not long after the HGW, his girlfriend is not Illya.</br>  <br>Saber isn't a normal Servant stupid.</br>  <br>She does say that, though.</br>  <br>The Saber in this wars is not dead.</br>  <br>Nope. You can show me, but I am not remembering wrong.</br>  <br>Where? If I remember correctly she only mentioned the girlfriend once, in this part:<br><br> He had friends and a lover. <br> He lost all of them, and he was cornered by the ideal he pursued. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sabe<wbr>r_%28Fate/stay_night%29 wrong, then?</wbr></br>  <br>Except CG's are a form of Heroic spirit in the throne of heros...</br>  <br>Shirou is already so good at archery that he only misses if he wants to. If he gets better he'll create the Tsubame Gaeshi for bows.</br>  <br>Saber is not dead and not a official servant so rules don't apply to her fully.</br>  <br><br> Shirou is a level of crazy that I highly doubt even exists in real life. <br><br>That is pretty much never true when you talk about fictional mental illnesses. While fiction is rarely precisely accurate when it comes to representing mental conditions, and it has a tendency to make things more colorful than they are in real life (e.g. split personalities, which simply do not exist in real life), fiction has a weird tendency to lowball how severe and crippling disorders can be. Shirou can walk around, speak coherently and intellectually, clearly recognize his surroundings, and generally behave like an average human being in day-to-day life, which puts him way, way ahead of your average long-term patient at a psychiatric facility. He demonstrates odd symptoms for his condition, which would make diagnosis a bit tricky, but it is well within the ability of a qualified therapist to help him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but it is well within the ability of a qualified therapist to help him. <br><br>No it isnt, simply because fundamentally he sees nothing wrong with what he is doing.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this scene going to get expanded in the BDs?</br>  <br> a lengthy summary that is practically headcanon <br>Yes, it is.<br><br>Her contract with Araya resembles a counter guardian contract, but it never got to that point.<br> Fuck, I regret this shit <br> Time to fix it <br> I know, I'll get the grail! <br> Give me chance(s) to get the grail, World! <br> Gets summoned into every contest or quest with a grail on the line, in her flesh and blood body <br> Happens to fit as "Servant" Saber for this event, gets Servant specific traits <br> Didn't obtain grail in F/SN, gets convinced by Shirou in most routes to GIVE UP HUNTING THE GRAIL <br> Contract breaks, she moves to Avalon instead of the throne of heroes <br><br>She never became a heroic spirit, and never became a counter guardian, because it simply never happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn you Ufotable.<br><br>I wanted to save money on the BD Box but then you show this when you buy from you directly.<br><br>I HATE PROXIES!</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was in the VN and was the same scene? The point is that he'll only keep his answer until the next summoning.</br>    <br> She never became a heroic spirit <br>She does in HF.</br></br>  <br><br>It's within their ability, anon. That is to say, they could do it given the opportunity, which would assume circumstances or his own volition caused him to go into therapy.</br></br>  <br> Im not sure what a Psychiatrist could do to help him. <br>give him happy pills</br></br>  <br>IIRC though Nasu said she was able to get around it in HF also.<br><br>Don't remember the direct quote</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone is "qualified" to deal with magical PTSD that de-souls someone into a machine.<br><br>You'd have to go way off the textbooks by that point, and that makes most of the paper qualifications guaranteeing 6 years of studying psychiatry? Useless.<br><br>An experienced psychiatrist could be a different matter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What do you get when you buy directly?</br></br>  <br>The storyboard book and I remember seeing a book for the 1st half BD and it was huge.</br>  Holy shit I want to hug her  <br>For every episode? Oh god fucking damn it UFO.</br>  <br>Nah.<br>Nasu likes his cause and effect shit, and the prerequisite of becoming a heroic spirit is obtaining the grail to fulfill the contract.<br>HF's Saber is more likely to simply hunt for the rest of eternity for the grail, until simply no more grails pop up. Then she waits for eternity. ;_;<br><br>Alternatively, due to multiverse faggotry, simply having those few possible routes where Saber gets persuaded out of chasing the grail, means that it is inevitable for a Saber that reaches every possibility for the grail.<br>Practically fanwanking by this point, but Last Episode DOES suggest the possibility.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LOS! LOS LOS LOS!</br>  <br>Every episode for the 2nd cour.<br><br>If you want the first half you have to search online to buy it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Going off textbook is one of the basic skills that a therapist is expected to have. It's an exceptionally lucky break when a patient actually does exhibit symptoms close to a textbook description. Rest of the time you're just lucky to get within the ballpark. Hell, at least Shirou's issues can all be traced to a single traumatic event, most patients don't have conditions nearly that convenient.</br></br>  <br> Every episode for the 2nd cour. <br>Well there goes my money.</br></br>  <br><br>Found the book</br></br>  Now its over Im getting a real urge to go back and rewatch Carnival Phantasm  <br> means that it is inevitable for a Saber that reaches every possibility for the grail. <br>Wait what?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, that's large.</br>  <br>Dealing with a soulless faggot bordering autism is way off the textbook.<br>Sure, diagnosing and categorising it is possible I guess.<br><br>Good luck treating it though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HORIZON BIG</br>  <br>Worth it for sure.</br>  <br>What do you mean by buy directly? aniplex japan? ufo's storefront?</br>  <br>Araya promised Saber the opportunity to compete for EVERY instance of ANYTHING named the holy grail, which is capable of granting wishes.<br><br>I meant,<br> inevitable for a Saber that reaches out for every possibility for the grail </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's really nothing preventing you from effectively treating somebody exhibiting symptoms like Shirou's aside from his own willingness to submit to treatment. Curing his condition completely, that's another matter, same with any other patient, but treatment is always an option.</br></br>  <br>Is this like a special preorder for aniplex/ufotable directly?</br>  <br>Didn't she obtain the grail in HF? Didn't she also gain a human body like Gil?</br>  <br>Ufotable store online.<br>https://ufotabln.temporarydomain.ne<wbr>t/ufoshop/index.php?main_page=produ<wbr>ct_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=356</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh, I wonder if a Saber managed to do it.</br>  I wasn't around for yesterdays threads, what were the reactions to the worm apples like?  <br>F5 to take screenshots, anon</br>  <br>I thought they were meant to be bunny shaped.</br>  <br>Not possible because she sucks and fails every time, probably.</br>  <br>Well she wouldn't be Saber if she succeeded in things most important.</br>  <br>I'm sure Saber manages eventually. But I'd rather her come to terms with herself</br>  <br>Getting swallowed by Sakura's gaping hole does not count as obtaining the grail, nor causes similar results as Gil's bath in fate zero.<br><br>For one thing, her wish wasn't granted. That defeats the purpose of the contract she signed.</br></br></br>  <br>Secondary here, I think they are a cute couple.</br>  <br>Her wish was to get the grail and she got it.</br>  <br>He needed a girlfriend who wasn't Ilya, who'd die before she could save him.</br>   What other reason do I have to live <br><br>We all know that feeling Seiba</br></br>  <br>Will he ever have babies?</br>  <br>But she needs to become Dark Saber for Heaven's Feel!<br><br>What are the chances HF gets a movie trilogy instead of one movie?</br></br></br>  <br>Higher than 1 movie</br>  <br> What are the chances HF gets a movie trilogy instead of one movie? <br><br>It is inferred that Ufotable is made up of HF fans and they are going to be the first/only people to ever animate the route. Odds are in its favor for more than 1 movie.</br></br></br>  Fate route please Takeuchi you have to do something.  <br>Maybe, if he ever remembers Taiga or if the Archibald loli ever goes dere for him.</br>  <br>or save her waifu before she gets strangled.</br>  <br>I want it so bad.</br>  So in the Good end does Rin take Saber to see her grave?  <br>I meal literally, exactly what I said. Just some girl I met at the hospital who had played too much of this "game"<br><br>What's "it"? I don't know what you're talking about. My reference point is usually Futurama season 10 and all of Archer on netflix</br></br></br>  <br>deen</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>I wouldn't doubt it will be eventual. They showed Arturia the girl in episode 20 so it is likely.</br>  <br>I mean just to be sure you understand, I don't have some exhaustive map of every single show in the universe, so I can't exactly just guess what you're talking about when you say vague things like that</br>  <br>But it was shit</br>  <br>Why would he ever fuck Taiga? He hates Japan and the Japanese for being such a dense culture. And he never comes back; he just imports JRPGs.  I bet he played Demons' Souls. <br><br>And the Archibald girl will fuck some other super-magic circuit mage, as per tradition.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its going to happen.<br><br>There were too many things hinting at it in the last few episodes, and the final episode was really heavy on the hints.<br><br>I wouldnt be surprised if UFOtable give us a heavily re-tooled Fate route as the "climax" of their F/SN adaption.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's all that Seiba deserves </br>  <br>His girlfriend was not Illya.</br>  <br> willingness to submit to treatment <br>That is the key issue in this case. Its not denial that he has an issue, he can't see it as an issue. Magic is crazy man.</br></br>  <br>I mean frankly, I can easily speculate about what you're talking about, but I don't intend to just up and take away every last shred of peoples human dignity like that, because I have NO IDEA what the blowback for THAT would be at this point. It would probably be very bad.</br>  <br>Saber deserves the best</br>  <br>HF is being remade to have Saber as the heroine.</br>  <br>I mean, there could LITERALLY, and I mean LITERALLY be an actual nuclear explosion somewhere in the world, maybe here in Seattle. Teleportation is an alarming ability.</br>  <br/>  <br>Thanks Takeuchi!</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>I completely agree, Castah!</br>  <br>Fate is the most popular route in japan, yeah? Eventually, it might get it's own OVA's or movies, or perhaps they're saving it for another 10 years so they can make another adaptation. Adapting all three routes so close together would be killer, or a little too much depending on who you're asking.<br><br>UBW is my favourite route, but I think Shirou and Saber are the cutest couple.<br><br>Let's be honest though. Fate doesn't bring anything unique to the table other than the Shirou and Saber romance, and Saber gets plenty more focus. But everything Fate addresses will be at least touched on in UBW and HF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I don't mean "someone will get mad and launch nukes at me", I mean this is an AUTOMATED SYSTEM. I HAVE the ACTUAL NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES. Do you get it?</br>  <br>How did UFO handle this part? I dropped it because I didn't like the adaptation but then I heard anons saying they did the Gil fight and the end really well.</br>  <br>Why do I feel like I've seen this exact post before</br>  <br> But everything Fate addresses will be at least touched on in UBW and HF. <br>A bit in UBW, but HF pretty much just has Alter. Saber only gets her story properly resolved in Fate.</br></br>  <br>Saber not being a normal heroic spirit gets covered in her route.</br>  Episode 24<br>1000000000000000/10<br><br>Episode 25<br>‚àû/10<br>All was forgiven</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HF has nothing on Saber besides a color palette swap and her going mute.</br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br> Let's be honest though. Fate doesn't bring anything unique to the table other than the Shirou and Saber romance <br><br>See, thats where you are wrong.<br><br>If they trimmed off all the info dumping and world building, changed Shirou's initial attitute towards Saber from "you cant fight cos your a girl" to "I cant stand the thought of anyone else fighting for me" and then add in lots of extras i.e. fully flesh out Saber's rule, show us scenes of Saber and her knights, her relationship with Lancelot, the loss of Caliburn, the gaining of Excallibur, the loss of Avalon and then the full battle of Camelann complete with Morgana and Mordred fuckery and they could make it amazing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, maybe I'll pick it back up.</br>  <br>What did you drop it for?</br>  <br>Fate brings a lot to the table that the other routes don't. Fate also has the best Gil.</br>  <br>You make a good point. If they could somehow add in the GoA info, flesh out Saber's background complete with reworked Arthurian lore, I would absolutely love it and possibly purchase it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Regardless, does this theoretically mean there might be two EMIYA in the Throne? One is the Counter Guardian Shirou we know and possibly the other is the Shirou we see in the various paths of the Fate games (or just UBW) who might have risen high enough to become a full Heroic Spirit?<br><br>Or am I just being a filthy, ignorant secondary.<br><br>I'm just wondering, if Shirou's doomed to always end up as EMIYA, where does all that gained experience he keeps giving himself going, he just seems like such a weird case that it feels like, in some semi-logic, EMIYA should have accidentally created an experience feedback loop.<br><br><br>I think the real problem is that, from an outside perspective, Shirou would be seen as "functionally insane", he seems to be living a fairly decent life, and without the Grail War or getting mentored further, he probably would have been a fairly normal if altruistic and self-sacrificial member of society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and then add in lots of extras i.e. fully flesh out Saber's rule, show us scenes of Saber and her knights, her relationship with Lancelot, the loss of Caliburn, the gaining of Excallibur, the loss of Avalon and then the full battle of Camelann complete with Morgana and Mordred fuckery and they could make it amazing <br><br>Yes. YES. This would be great. Merlin fuckery as well in needed.<br><br>As is Last Episode at the end as the epilogue. If Last Episode is as good as the UBW epilogue I know I will be crying bitch tears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate + Garden of Avalon + Last Episode<br>Fund it</br></br>  <br>How the hell did you even come to that conclusion?</br>  <br> Proper Arturia backstory <br> complete with Lancelot, Gawain, Guinivere, Merlin, Morgana and Mordred <br><br>Holy fuck yes please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They need to fix the Berserker fight.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about the Fate route in general. I'm starting to think everyone believes the only difference between the routes is the amount of screentime each heroine gets.<br><br>No, everything in Fate except for Saber's entire story is pretty much re-told in the successive routes, and with Ufotable's F/SN adaptation, there is no surprise from Gil being from the previous war, Kotomine being an antagonist, Shirou's father, Avalon, anything at all.<br><br>Saber is best girl, but beyond her getting a proper conclusion, is there any point?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Somebody please fund this. Takeuchi please. We need you.</br>  <br>Not to mention Fate is a better sequel to Zero if that's what Ufo were aiming for. Gil keeps his characterization, Saber's still the main heroine, Illya does more than get cardiac surgery and Kotomine doesn't job.</br>  <br> Fate + GoA + Last Episode + Whatever else UFOtable fancies throwing in htere <br> cut down on the infodumps <br> expand on the battles <br><br>FUCKING FUND IT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hannibal could fix him very quick</br>  <br>She's the only one Archer remembered with sorrow.</br>  <br> Saber is best girl, but beyond her getting a proper conclusion, is there any point? <br>More Saber screentime, of course</br></br>  <br>Aw man, this sounds much better. Especially changing Shirou's reason for not wanting her to fight, fits with the rest of his character more and is less stupid.</br>  <br>This actually sounds amazing.</br>  <br> Or am I just being a filthy, ignorant secondary <br>It's complicated but no, unless Shirou pulls off some crazy stunts in his life and has many different tales of legend each radically different from the rest, there's just one EMIYA Heroic Spirit.</br></br>  <br>What about Saber? He always seems to look at her with a tinge of regret of not saving her.</br>  <br><br> getting to see Arturia and Modred's interactions <br> getting to see Gwain in all his shittalking glory <br> getting to see Merlin being history's best troll <br> getting to see Lancelot in his prime and then his conflict of interest between Arturia and Gunieverre <br> Getting to see the cute interactions between Arturia and Guinieverre <br><br>I fucking need this in my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GuiniverexArturia yuri <br>Not sure if want.<br> inb4 the /u/nwanted </br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind a 2-or-3 part arc about the knights of the round table in the middle of my Fate adaptation!</br>  <br>That would be so fucking sweet</br>  <br> &gt;Getting to see the cute interactions between Arturia and Guinieverre </br>  <br> Kotomine doesn't job. <br>Kotominefag? He's an eye-sore, so we don't care.</br></br>  I want to see Lancelot talking shit to Gawain.  <br> mfw UFOtable have exactly this planned and they are letting us arrive at this conclusion by ourselves from their light hints scattered throughout the UBW adaption <br><br>UFOtable.

A bit much to take in. Hope you guys are happy, I guess? </br></br>  <br>But derailing the show.

More Saber is always welcome.</br>  <br>Thank you for explaining, I apologize for the spoonfeed.<br><br>So, the earned experience from each cycle just kind of disappears and no matter how far or skilled a Shirough might get, when they become a counter guardian is all resets, right?<br><br>Yeesh, no wonder he's so angry.<br><br> Learned UBW ten years earlier than Archer <br> Legit kicked Gilgamesh's ass and saved Illya in this UBW route <br> Saved Saber, Rin, and Sakura with my gained magic skill <br> Saved a crapload more people without killing someone <br> Didn't lose hope <br> Gaia still nerfs me back to Failure!EMIYA power and strips me of my happy memories/good experience <br> Such is life as a Counter Guardian. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tmitter adaption never<br><br>I would happy if we got that instead of Carnival Phantasm season 4.</br></br>  <br>Is death from moe possible?</br>  <br>Unfortunately it seems Gawain was her only source of meals.</br>  <br>Kirei's a good villain in Stay Night<br><br>Don't be salty, Kerry.</br></br></br>  <br>Or both!

If anything, it'll tie in FZ, UBW and presumably HF anime nicely.</br>  <br>Wait what, really? That ruined my dreams then. Oh well, maybe Gwen's attempts would've been cute</br>  <br>Or they could just do those AS the sequel to CP.</br>  <br>Guinne was her best friend though. She loved her like a sister and she was one of only a very few people who she could actually talk to normally, without the whole "King" thing getting in the way.<br><br>She saw Lancelot as a close friend too. She entirely supported Lancelot's love for Guinne, however she could never say so due to their positions.</br></br></br>  <br>This. I just want my cute little kishi ou to be happy.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I began laughing and got a small tear in my eye when they actually fucking adapted the TM Rin v Luvia Wrestingling April Fools from years ago.<br><br>That was fucking fabulous.</br></br></br>  <br>No you didn't.</br>  <br>okay, now instead I'm imagining Saber and Gwen being 80's teenage airheads when they hang out. Hair spray is everywhere, posters of White Snake and Vanhallan on the walls, the radio is blaring musicm and they're both wearing something over tights with leg warmers.</br>  <br> ponytail Rin <br>Pic related</br></br>  <br><br>But it is canon that Shirou would lose against high tier mages like Bazett.<br><br> Dengeki Hime 10/2006 - Fate Dream Battle Round 5 - Bazett vs. Shirou  <br><br> Nasu:With this time's battle, since we're working off the assumption that Shirou "has trained/is operating himself to the max", people might think that this might end up being a good fight, but m'lady Bazett's a trained professional specializing in anti-magus battles. Technique, experience, and battle power. Against someone like her whose superior in all those regards, even with a "Broken Phantasm", Shirou's disadvantages are still not going to change. And you see. She's ruthless. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only good Saber is a bullied Saber.</br>   TM giving us GoA recently <br> those little hints throughout UBW towards Fate <br> that epilogue at Glastonbury <br><br>The Fate route will receive an adaption. Mark my words.<br><br>It will be announced shortly after the HF adaption. It will serve as UFOtable's climax to their adaption of F/SN.

You wont shake my views.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier just to look over the archives?</br>  <br>So is this going to be on the BDs and it was cut or what? Because all the secondaries are misunderstanding.</br>  <br> &gt;Emiya is such a beautifully constructed character <br> &gt;Nasu really got lucky writing this guy. <br><br>...Can't tell if joking or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you disagree but I'm not joking. He's my favourite fictional character.<br><br>I understand we will never agree, so let's just not get into it.</br></br></br>  <br> ... <br><br>Fuck off back to reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>take ur meds, anon...</br>  OST 2 when?  <br>Not if he tames her first, sexually.<br>She probably saw Dat Bar too, for that matter.</br></br>  <br><br>I laughed the whole episode.

But most likely yeah.</br>  <br>DID exists in the real world, dude. Its not really the way popular fiction depicts 'split personalities', but its very much real, if rare.<br><br>Shirou's just neurotic and has a cocktail of personality and anxiety disorders. A psychiatrist could probably help him, if Shirou was willing to go to years and years of therapy.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought CGs retained their memories? Like how he remembers killing the metric fuckton of people as a CG while summoned as Archer. I'm honestly not too sure myself, though.</br>  <br>Hopefully, that was a badly cut scene.</br>  <br><br><br>I find it hard to believe they skipped out on something that important, and yet devoted 40 entire seconds to this sunset scene.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a beautiful scene. It doesn't show much but you know what is happening.</br>   Including El-Melloi Waver and not even hinting at how incredibly how silly he is   <br><br>Kerry would just ignore Saber.

So no extra footage for 25?</br>  <br>Holy fuck UFOtable you teases</br>  <br>Not opening it but I can already hear it in my head and I am laughing</br>  <br>Re-upload somewhere.</br>  <br>There will probably be footage added to a lot of episodes, but the stuff about there being extra Luvia was talking about the BD booklet of all the shit Nasu wrote that they couldn't fit in the anime and also was a joke.</br>  <br>I know I'm late as fuck, but no they can't. UBW drops the mana/prana requirement for tracing, but doesn't cover the cost of dropping so much mana into something that it explodes.

Its weird when your hometown is even mentioned in anime, let alone the characters actually fucking go to it.</br></br>  <br>Since series typically decline with each addition do you think Fate would still end up selling less than UBW or would Saber's popularity make it even with UBW or surpass it?</br>  <br>October with the BDs...</br>  <br>Unless someone registered to do a Fate doujin and have not produced anything yet odds are slim as fuck. They can still do it if they want but trying to get 1 done in just 1 month and printed is a lot of work.</br>  <br>Thank you based Takeuchi.</br>  <br>No, and yeah I'll switch back just been too lazy after X broke months ago.</br>  <br> Ilya and Shirou/Saber interactions <br><br>Holy fuck I forgot all about that.<br><br>A Fate remastering by UFOtable could be fucking amazing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you see them? Did you go get that free Saber plushie they left in her grave?</br>  <br>What if he was talking about  Emperor ?</br>  <br> Since series typically decline with each addition <br><br>Im not sure you comprehend how much the nips love F/SN.</br></br></br>  <br>H-have you been to Arthur's grave before?</br>  <br>An animated Fate/Extra would be sick.</br>  <br><br>Your Emperor is false.<br><br>There is only one Emperor and he is our shield and protector.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but I might go and take a Lion plushie and place it on the spot that marks Arthur's grave in Avalon (yes, we have a place called Avalon)<br><br><br>Well, its a place that marks it. It isnt actually his grave or anything</br></br></br></br>  <br>This makes me wonder if any hardcore Saberfags have ever left Fate stuff at his grave.</br>  <br>I would feel bad for the Arturia fans but seeing Nero animated would too great to pass up.</br>  <br><br>They have.</br></br>  <br>Clones are not allowed.</br>  <br>I wish I lived where you live</br>    <br>I can only imagine the locals' confusion.</br>  <br>Pics? It must be confusing for people going there for the history, seeing seemingly random anime girls at the grave.</br>  <br><br><br>Heard you guys had quite the party over the weekend.</br></br></br>  <br>Its fucking goregeous and lovely. Those scenes with Shirou and Rin on the grassy hillside overlooking the countryside isnt just artistic merrit. The countryside around here is as lovely and scenic as it comes.<br><br>I love it all. Except this weeked. Glastonbury festival fucking ruins everything. Fuck that festival.</br></br></br>  <br> gilgamesh is shirou's son <br>wtf?</br></br>  <br> not putting it over the body </br>  <br> Glastonbury festival fucking ruins everything. Fuck that festival. <br>What's wrong with it?</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Aren't there rules against that kind of shit?</br>  <br>You should see the state it leaves the local area in.<br><br>Im just being a bitter local, really.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think this is correct. If Archer loved Ilya then he would have at least reacted to her.</br>  Predictably, there's already art of the grave.<br><br>Shit, all this makes me mad Grand Order won't feature the human characters. It's clearly a "fuck it, let's have fun shit happen" game already, why not feature the masters as well for extra interactions?</br></br>  <br>It really is lovely, fellow Somerset-fag</br>  Who else is Saber/Archer here?  <br>Is it true there are only white people there?</br>  <br> Queen <br> Ever doing housework herself </br></br>  <br>Still haven't lost hope here!</br>  <br>Those guys look like they have their own problems.</br>  <br>The actual routes have weird enough shit in them, the cut routes are even wilder and the joke routes are absolutely bonkers.</br>  <br>Yep. Contrary to /pol/ belief and shitposting, most of this country is white with the non-whites being pretty nicely quarantined in certain areas in the big cities.</br>  <br>Who knows. <br>But UBW Shirou's story really bears a lot of similarity with what Archer reveals in EXTRA.<br><br> Got through HGW <br> Became a vigilante <br> Traveled the world <br> Had a lover and a friend <br> Lover died <br> Friend betrayed him <br> Drowned in his ideals and died <br><br>Many speculated that his girlfriend was Rin as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think it stays lovely?</br>  <br>No, it's actually got one of the largest remaining populations of native americans.</br>  <br>The funny thing is the grave is probably a sham.</br>  <br><br>B E S T<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So? Even if it isn't real, that doesn't discount the history and myth of the place.</br>  <br>Couldn't have been Rin. Rin saw into his memories, and knew he had a lover. Pretty sure she would have said something if it was her.</br>  <br>Because UBW Shirou becomes Archer 2.0 with no CG contract.</br>  <br><br><br>The problem with Shirou is that he's, for all intents and purposes, right. He's got hardcore ego problems, but he's also a total chuuni.<br><br>A chuuni with magic powers and the tools to live out his chuunibyou. This is more immediately dangerous than his lack of self; as Shirou literally has the power to become a superhero (reinforced by his future self, who goes right back to being content after getting his shit kicked in).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what? It's a sham most likely made by another king trying to get money from idiots. It's kind of a slap in the face to Arturia.</br>  <br> probably <br>We found our King buried in a parking lot, it's definitely a sham.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't Rin. It's established that, if EMIYA had been with Rin, she would've been able to rein him in.</br>  <br>It marks the historical/mythological place he is said to be buried, rather than being the actual tomb.</br>  <br>  she would've been able to rein him in. <br>Can't do that if you're dead.</br></br>   UBW Shirou won't enter into contract with Alaya <br><br>Says who? He'll probably end up doing the exact same shit. He'll think he'll be smarter about it this time but he'll end up in exactly the same place. It's FATE</br></br>    <br>didnt the waver novel mention that the new saber clone is keeping watch of the real grave or something</br>  <br>A sham, you say?</br>  <br>Considering Brenin Arthur was most like a celtic chieftain, whereever his gorsedd was, it's probably in Wales.</br>  <br> Says who?  <br>Have you ever tried saving the same file with the same name</br></br>  <br> Says who? <br>Nasu.</br></br>  <br>Glastonbury abbey is where the legend mentions him getting buried, and since Arthur is fictional anyways, it's not like they made up the gravesite.</br>  <br>That's not how FATE works you mong</br>  <br> Says who? <br>Nasu. <br><br> Q: During the last part of Sakura‚Äôs route, Shirou was saved by the tiny bit of residual mana in Rin Tohsaka‚Äôs pendant. Also, it seems like Rin knew about the difference in residual mana between the thing he got back from Archer and the thing he was holding, so could Sakura‚Äôs route be the one in which Shirou becomes a Heroic Spirit after all? Or could you tell us the route(s) in which Shirou doesn‚Äôt become a Heroic Spirit? <br><br> A: I‚Äôll just say now that he doesn‚Äôt become a Heroic Spirit in any of the routes, but the possibility is still present in all of them as well. Basically, the probability of it happening is almost zero. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sheepshaggers wanting mythology this bad </br>  <br>You're the idiot for caring about a shitty cheap smartphone game in the first place.</br>  <br>1. Nasu<br>2. Archer only entered the contract because he thought it'd mean he'd get an awesome job of saving people even after he died. He got to save people, but it wasn't an awesome job.</br></br>  <br>Somerset isnt far from Wales and would have likely included Arthur's land at the time.</br>  <br> have to go around killing towelheads after playing with their kids </br>  <br><br> That's now how fate works <br><br>http://dictionary.reference.com/bro<wbr>wse/fate<br><br> that which is inevitably predetermined; destiny </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>And it amounted to nothing, because he could never stay and do more than snipe criminals before returning. He was just more axle grease for a machine that never stopped.</br>  <br>Though its amusing how UFOtable had Archer get summoned in to kill people who were pretty clearly ISIS insurgents.</br>  I am going to blame that horrible after credits ending for all the secondaries thinking UBW Shirou becomes Archer.<br>It was so badly handled that Nasu had to release this not long after<br>God damn it.</br></br>  <br>Britons weren't confined to Wales/Cornwall at the time, the whole backdrop of the Matter of Britain is the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons.</br>  <br>Nasu probably opened a newspaper one day, saw who were the most advertised bad guys currently and then told ufotable to animate Archer killing muslims. I can see that's how it happened.</br>  <br>Looking at it again, with that as reference, it makes sense mostly.</br>  <br>Operation remove britbongs?</br>  <br>Of course but without that reference there's going to be confusion, as seen in the past threads.</br>  <br> implying Tohsaka doesn't want a future Archer hubby and is going to intentionally make Shirou go down that path anyways <br>pls</br></br>  <br> husband and wife CG team <br>Oh my</br></br>  <br>heh, marriage is for chumps anyway</br>  <br>Exactly.<br><br>pic related<br><br><br>Are you fucking kidding me? SASUGA UFO<br><br>Holy shit, Nasu gave them all that and then they came up with that garbage?<br><br>Miura, NEVER FUCKING AGAIN.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Waver <br>Oh fuck, I was wondering who that guy was.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;husband and wife CG team <br>Doesn't this sort of apply to Scathach and Lancer? Or was Lancer too much of a manwhore?<br>I mean, after all, Scathach canonically gave Setanta the Shonen H treatment.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems they had some time constraints but who knows really, have to wait until BDs.</br>  <br>Only if you completly ignore what the adaption was hammering into your head during the entire second cour.</br>  If Shirou still somehow manages to fuck up and become a CG, we already know what Rin will do.  <br>   I bet he played Demons' Souls. <br>Not in 2003</br></br>    AKARIN!  <br>Diejubu ?</br>  <br>She's fine guys daijoubu!</br>  <br>She's not sleeping, she's broken.</br>   Yurus <br> lolis <br>Stop.</br></br>    <br> implying this show doesn't expressly pander to pedophiles <br><br>kek<br>e<br>k</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't pander to pedophiles at all.

The former, obviously, and as you can tell from every picture of tomato in this thread, she's pre-pubescent.</br>  <br> She's prepubescent <br>There it is. I was trying to pinpoint what exactly you were wrong about. <br>The yurus are clearly pubescent as they have begun breast development and they have womanly hips.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Jesus christ you are incredibly delusional. You could not convince any normal person that she wasn't pre-pubescent.</br></br></br>  Thread already ruined by normalfags.<br><br>Good night</br></br>  <br> 13 years old <br> prepubescent <br>ok then buddy</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's almost like puberty isn't entirely determined by age. Where exactly are her breasts and "womanly" hips?</br></br>  <br>The normal american maybe. Their knowledge in this area is just barely ahead of Africa's.  You know, the place where they think rape cures AIDS. </br>  <br> isn't entirely determined by age <br>No, but it's directly correlated by age. You realise failure to enter puberty for girls by the age of ~14 is a medical issue?<br><br>Nice troll brah</br></br></br></br>  <br>under her clothes anon. Do you not know where breasts and hips are?</br>  <br><br><br><br> Trying this hard to deny your pedophilia <br><br>Degeneracy at it's finest. The only people that you could get to agree about this with you are japs, sand niggers, and other western pedos. <br><br>Just because the show calls her 13 doesn't give her pubescent features. Point out a single pubescent feature on tomato.<br><br>If she had breasts or "womanly" hips, you'd be able to tell. Particularly since some of the others are clearly in the midst of puberty, the prepubescent nature of tomato is incredibly clear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So was this a yuru thread or a loli thread?  <br>It was normalfags /pol/ tier thread.<br><br>Loli thread is here<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Look at literally any side shot or a shot of her in shorts/pants.</br>  <br>I think it's a debate about pedophilia.</br>  <br>Oh naisu.

Why do you think I was baiting that faggot over here?</br>  <br> implying that i care about unashamed pedophiles <br><br>It's drawings on the internet.

Christ time flies</br>  <br>I HATE IT</br>  So how would the grail war have turned out if Bazett actually participated? If paired up with a non-shit servant, wouldn't she destroy everyone?   Lancer <br> Shit </br>  <br>Cu/Bazett team would be OP as shit<br><br>they would be beating up masters and servants by night and fucking like rabbits by day</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nope. Bazett is the ultimate kill stealer and Cu wants to have a fucking good fight.<br><br>Cu would be pissed at fuck for Bazett using her kill stealing NP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In a straight up fight she'd have a good chance at beating the other Master/Servant pairs but would have a pretty hard time against Herc. <br><br>If she took out Shirou though, she would have no way of beating Gil. Cu is a great Servant but he's not gonna a semi-serious Gil even with Master support.</br></br></br>  <br>Especially with Cu giving her buffs</br>  <br>just because she has Fragarach doesn't mean she has to use it<br>I'm sure they could work something out</br></br>  <br> team luck of the Irish <br>They're pretty much fucked.<br><br>Remember that Fate is an underdog story. Bazzett+Cu is pretty much 2nd top dog after team BAHSAKAH. They'll job so hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bazett and Cu would probably win against everyone except Berserker and Gil.</br>  So, did Bazett have a sad goodbye with Avenger like all the other servants had with their masters in the novel? Well except RIder/Sakura. Rider always dies early except for Heaven's feel and Sakura's cuckoo for coco puffs in that route.  <br>They are good against team rape and team tsundere.<br><br>Against team idiot is problematic if plot armor kicks in.<br>Team waifu wins if they decide to turtle.<br>Team BAHSAKAH is problematic since Gay Bulge can only do much. Killing Illya is the only way to win at that point.<br>Team REJOICE is pretty much auto lose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Bazett has a forceful personality and wants to be on the front lines and isn't content to just sit back and watch.</br>  <br>RANSA GA SHINDU</br>  <br>Have you ever seen how Bazett acts during those rare moments with Cu, She ping pongs between being starstruck and being crude strong girl.</br>  <br> So, did Bazett have a sad goodbye with Avenger </br>  <br> If she took out Shirou though, she would have no way of beating Gi <br>How exactly would Gil counter Gae Bolg?</br></br>  <br>Not being in range of the Gay Bulge melee.<br><br>Gil might be stupid, but he's not that stupid enough to fight a non-nerfed Cu.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought HA was a shitty fandisk non-canon game with slice of life bull shit that was never possible in the original novel? This looks like some suffering.</br>  The important question is  does Baz swing both ways? When Avenger teased her and asked if she was a lesbian I didn't hear a "no"   <br>It's canon, and it does have a lot of slice of life, but there's a serious story behind it.</br>  <br> Bazett casts 1 v 1 me faggot to Illya <br> Illya gets fucked up <br> Berserker fades <br> ??? <br> Profit. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't hear a no when he asked if she was a virgin either.</br>  <br>Slice of life stories are written by guest authors, can be vaguely taken as non-canon or Carnival Phantasm-tier. Main story is pretty serious shit, with Avenger, Bazette, and Caren.</br>  <br>Actually, if Bazett and Cu were not betrayed by someone who wasn't supposed to even be a Master in the war (Kirei), they had a stupendously high chance of winning the 5th HGW.</br>  <br>well that much is pretty obvious. There is no way in HELL Baz is a non-virgin</br>  At this moment... I am euphoric  <br>There is no god, simpleton</br>  Anyway, have you ever heard of this thing called "fiber optics"? It's like magic, but with lasers  <br>that was epic</br>  Oh ok, have you heard of a thing called a "wireless network"? It's like magic, but with, like, radiation or something  Oh yeah, have you ever heard of "putting someone inside a fully reflective mirror ball"?
