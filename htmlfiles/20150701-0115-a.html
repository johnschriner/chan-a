But I was curious when you mentioned I should go to batoto and not to mangafox.</br>  <br> I hang out a lot here and for years even but I'm not that interested in those kind of things. <br>  I'm not that interested in reading my manga with quality non scaled down images.  <br><br>That's what I'm reading</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would watch.</br>  <br>well besides the credit thing, batoto uses uncompressed images which are higher quality</br>  Mystery anime set in a slightly different world where abandoned ships floating around like this are much more common:<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Ba<wbr>ychimo<br><br>Follow the adventures of a crew of scrappy salvagers that roam the seas finding ghost ships, looking for loot and (sometimes unwillingly) learning more about the vanished crew and stuff.

He at first reciprocates, but when he finds out about her secret, he begins to reject her because she sees her as dirty, used goods, whichever you prefer. <br><br>No healing meme, no ambiguous ending.

They all pass out at the same time every night and wake up immediately as a completely different person(sex, race, age are all possible variables.) At night they run around enjoying their "other" side. Most people don't want their other side to be discovered, so there are a bajillion hiding spots to pass out in scattered throughout the school.<br><br>Enter main character, he's a chump that doesn't change at all when he passes out. A bunch of people bully him at night because of it. He gets fed up and decides to figure out the secret identity of every single member of his school, and publish it before the end of the year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Make it the MC a stealth master and we are game.</br>  This is an old one, but since it still hasn't been made...<br><br>At the start of the series, an army is besieging the castle of some noble in generic fantasyland. <br>The daughter of the family manages to escape through a hidden passage while everyone else is butchered. She's found by a gruff mercenary with a dog who's getting too old for this shit. Learning who she is, he decides to take her to some nobles who had been allied with her family for ransom money.<br>They're later joined by a sleazy archer dude, and then there's bonding and hijinks moments as they try to stay ahead their pursuers and others who might want to make money off of the sole heir of a noble house.<br>In the penultimate episode, the archer dude sells them out to the enemy, and they're taken to be executed.<br>At the very start of the last episode, they're both executed and the traitor takes his money and leaves. The rest of the episode consists of flashbacks to the moments he bonded with the noble girl and flashbacks to his younger sister, who had fallen ill.<br>When he finally comes back home with the money to pay for her treatment, it turns out she's all better and she runs to meet him with a big happy smile on her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Done and done.<br><br>I also had this idea that his daylight crush is one of his worst tormentors. Also half way through a group of the more intelligent students find out what he's doing and form a posse to crush him at all costs before he finishes his book of identities.<br><br>The series starts slice-of-life and gets more dramatic near the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would watch and buy the blue ray anon.</br>  <br><br>Wait a minute. People need sleep. How does this work?</br></br>  <br><br>I would watch it, then rage impotently at the ending.</br></br>  <br>How could you rage at a happy and healthy imouto welcoming her brother home?</br>  <br><br>They're abnormalities(superhumans I guess?) gathered from across Japan that never sleep. Hence the supernatural tag at the top of my first post.</br></br>  <br> questioning anything in anime </br>   ctrl+f 'a boy falls in love with a girl. Unable to confess' <br> none found </br>  <br><br>I, uh, kinda bonded with the noble girl and the gruff mercenary over the course of your shortass description.<br><br>I'm impressionable and dumb, sue me.</br></br></br></br>  I reckon this could get a decent anime adaptation.<br><br>The third part could make for a decent mindfuck ending every successful SF anime seems to have</br></br>  <br> sue me <br>I would if it got me the kind of money to make this thing.</br></br>  <br>Nobody its judging.</br>  <br>Main character is a five hundred year old vampire.<br><br>He just wants to be left alone. He works a shitty night shift job as a security guard at some warehouse, so he can pay rent and buy blood on the black market since hunting people is too much of a hassle.<br><br>One night a group of goth kids (its set in the 90s when they still existed, shut up) break into the warehouse to have some fun, and run into him just as he was having his midnight snack.<br><br>Rest of the series are them idolizing him and trying to become his followers and get him to convert them while he's trying to get them to leave him alone and not reveal his identity to public.<br><br>SoL/Comedy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The MC is the hero,the mentor, the villain and the love interest due to multiverse and timetravel motherfuckery.  An elderly gentleman is laid off work due to the recession and he's unable to find a new job. He begins to spend his time getting pissed at all the damn hoodlums in his neighborhood, and finally gets together with a bunch of other men in similar situations to form a vigilante group, wearing simple masks.<br>They proceed to stalk out the hoods in their area, then strike when they're alone and defenseless, sending them in the ICU. Because one of them is a former cop, they're able to this perfect crime without leaving behind any evidence, and so this becomes their calling in life. It's basically Death Wish, but with more goofy outfits and less guns.<br>Extra points if their victims are foreigners, so they can be extra xenophobic.</br></br>  <br><br>Hilarious, your protagonist kind of reminds me of a mix of several characters from American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Are old vampires balls to the wall overpowered in this universe? Or is their strength more or less consistent at any age? Is there absolutely no shonen-shit fighting in the entire series, making my first question pointless?<br><br>AOTS contender for sure if done right.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>pottery</br></br>  <br> Not anime, but you should watch What we do in the Shadows </br>   The tales of a 30-something year year old present day trucker <br> He has a waifu and kodomo but is on the road most of the time <br><br>Japan has truckers, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, they're the leading cause of waifucide.</br>  <br>What'll happen to the kodomo?</br>   MC works on a hospice <br> falls in love with a patient with cancer <br> the relationship begins to crumble as she gets pregnant but they decide to do an abortion <br> they get married for the sake of it <br> she eventually dies, but no one other than MC really cares about it <br> his life is falling apart, has to change jobs because he can't handle to stay there <br> has nightmares with her every night <br><br>The suffering would be glorious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where's the obligatory pasta?  A two season series: the first season revolves around the hijinks of an journeyman wizard who travels around a fantasy world, collecting rare ingredients for potions and old ass relics for weird rituals while not being allowed to have sex or else he loses his powers. He ends up with a harem, but never fucks any of them. At the end he finally turns 30, gets his cosmic powers and tells them all to fuck off.<br>The second season has him as an evil overlord who has gone mad from his blue balls, and one party of female adventurers after another tries to overcome his defenses and rape him to remove his powers, only to be captured and sent to the dungeons to be raped by Orcs or something.</br>  <br>How is this going to end in any other way than with the MC killing himself?</br>  An anime about the dubstep scene but everyone is girls.<br>Skream is the protagonist and a little girl.</br>  <br>What if I turn one of your ideas into a webcomic and make money? Will you be mad, /a/?</br>  <br>At least let us know beforehand so we can feel good about having been a positive influence on something.</br>  <br>Unless you're a Japaneseman it's gonna be shit.</br>  <br><br>I'd be flattered, not like I have the balls to do anything with my life anyway.</br></br>  <br>Well, the album ends just as I said, with him beginning to move on but not being able to shake her out of his mind.<br><br>There is a whole "subplot" about a similar thing happening to her when she was younger, so maybe he could start slowly but surely going insane like her, ending with someone falling in love with him, just to complete the loop.</br></br></br>  <br><br>/a/ the anime.</br></br>  <br>Harems were created by corporate people so they can sell more merch. You're better than that.</br>  <br>I couldn't figure out and ending for it though.</br>  <br><br>I think it would be hilarious if he turns into that world's equivalent of Sauron, and an alliance of all the good races has to band together to take him down. Fuckin' normies, man.</br></br>  <br>Sure, just namedrop the board,get some rep for ya.</br>  <br>Switch that to daughter and you've got Usagi Drop, before it went wincest that is.</br>  Some white folk end up crashing in the tropics, where they encounter several warring tribes or savages who have been living in isolation for thousands of years and practice cannibalism. The survivors use their understanding of engineering and science to build mechas to intimidate the primitive and superstitious peoples, who begin to treat the mechs first as monsters, when their villages are robbed of food (the whiteys can't hunt for shit) but later submit and worship them as gods, giving them tributes.<br>It's smooth sailing until the mechpilots go mad from power and each leads their own tribe to war against the other.</br>   Typical mech anime <br> Giant demons vs human &amp; angels <br> main character is fighting because "muh dad" <br> Fight, fight, fight  <br> Humans and verge of victory <br> Angels pull a wrestling heel turn and want to purify the world due to the wars damage. <br> main character meets cute demon girl <br> tag-team mech pilots and now have to unite humans and demons. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br>Fuck this manhwa<br>Fuck this world<br>I'm not crying<br>Fuck you</br></br></br></br></br>   shonen shit fighting manga, high school setting <br> douchebags fight each other for dominance, each side bitch that they're banging grants them a super power <br> main character is a virgin /a/ lurker, he realizes his 2D waifus also grant him powers <br> ascends the ladder of his high school, gathering more waifus as he solidifies his wizard status <br> becomes king of his school <br> second arc, inter-high school tournament <br> MC fights through several grueling battles, protecting his virginity from saboteurs, and is ultimately crowned champion.

Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.<br><br>But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.<br><br>Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE.<br><br>Now with its own OP: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4NS<wbr>hEKYoPXw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>I wish I could enter an endless recursion of time.</br>  a sissy southern cuckboy is in love with his familie's negro buck slave. the cuckboy confederate gets impaled on the negroid's BBC and the anime is him trying to pleasure the rape ape by having a good sissy anus and taking his BBC deep inside his throat  <br>I have an even better idea.</br>  <br>Well,what about Warhammer40k,the anime?

Only the equivalent of dolphins and dragons.</br>  Is that all the Tsukihime? I was told they changed Arc and Ciel's design again.<br><br>I disagree.<br>The skirt sucks but I think she's fucking adorable.</br></br></br>  you faggots know that takuechi stated that they not gonna do h scene anymore, mahoyo didnt get either  <br><br>It's not going to be translated into English ever.

That's it, if it ever manages to come out.  <br>That paper he wrote in F/Z must have been the basis for his teaching standards then, considering it was about how mages dont need to be born into strong families to be strong</br>    <br>Unless they want this to sell as poorly as Mahoyo did, they should have H scenes.</br>  <br>Fate is good.</br>  <br>what the fuck?<br>Like, seriously what the fuck?<br>Who thought this was a good idea?<br>I've been waiting this long for a stripped down VN from 2000 with designs I mostly don't like<br>I'm done with everything, fuck it all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> personal real-estate of that size and design in Japan <br><br>Yeah right.</br></br></br>  <br>It ranges from shit to ok at best</br>  <br>Most of the big VN companies end doing this at one point. That way they can go more mainstream.</br>  <br>Wait for the kickstarter.</br>  <br> poorly <br> was 7th most selled VN 2012 <br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Because the end couple is Alice and the boy.<br><br>And their romance will be tragedy since it was already spoiled by the complete material entry on Alice.<br><br>And Mahoyo is suppose to be a trilogy but Nasu is a lazy ass since I highly doubt Mahoyo Part 2 and 3 is ever gonna come out,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ, they sure made the mansion bigger.</br>  <br>Mahoyo had other issues<br><br>Like not having voices at all</br></br></br>  <br>all you would need is lots of money to buy the land</br>  <br>What is this?</br>  This will be shit how do they expect me to enjoy the adventures of Rapeman if he won't even rape anyone in it?  With the setting be replaced with a contemporary one?  <br>It ranges from shit to pretty fucking awesome.<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>   No h scenes <br>what's the fucking point</br>  <br>Poorly compared to Fate and Tsukihime, right?</br>  <br>Nothing about H-scenes has been mentioned you troublestirring faggot.</br>  <br>He is still a really average mage though.<br><br>But he is number one in the list of people the female students want to fuck, so I suppose it's good.</br></br></br>  How can they remove the scenes?  they're pretty fucking important for kohaku/hisui's routes   <br>Maybe he force-feeds his victims hard boiled eggs instead?</br>  <br>Only due to Nasu's threats of canning the game if it didn't get enough preorders, newfag.<br><br>Mahoyo had a shit reception once everyone played it.<br><br>Nasu spent too much time showing off the VN engine rather than spending time on the story.<br><br>Seriously, all the Mahoyo hype was the so called super special VN engine from Type Moon like anyone gave a shit about their new VN engine in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you. I'm right, you're wrong.</br>  <br>Remake means they will rewrite the game, so don't expect it being the same because it will not.<br><br>It was even said that they will change some DAAs.</br></br></br>  Who hear /GotMotivatedTo ResumeLearningJapanese/ so they can be fluent enough to read the remake by the time it comes out?  The glasses honestly just look really wrong on him. They look like extra fluff. Hell 2 of the faces have his eyes actually looking into a space the glasses's rim occupies.  <br>Key still does sex. TM isn't nearly as big as Key in VNs.</br>  <br>It's not like they're copy pasting the scenario. Probably.</br>  <br>No anon. Never forget that:<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>Kohaku was forced to clean Makihisa's floors really well to ease his pains. After a while this broke her. Also include something about spoiling a movie.</br>  <br>It had a shit reception the first day due to haters. Right now in EGS it has a good rating.</br>  <br>Shiki's old glasses really weren't that old fashioned.</br>  I liked the round glasses better  <br>Well since he's the protag you won't have to see him that often<br>And aside from the fun CGs, in most of the action CGs he'll probably have his glasses off so even then it wouldn't be that big of a deal</br></br>  <br> Magica Disclosure <br> Master TV <br>Naaasuuuu</br></br></br>  <br>But anon.<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>If I start now how long would that give me? 10 years?</br>  <br>Key has sex sometimes, but Clannad was All Ages and that was their big hit.</br>  <br>understandable. So his situation is kinda like Shirou then, after surviving the holy grail war i would imagine the respect he gets at the tower is on par with being a great mage.</br>  <br>Going to be practicing kanji tomorrow, this update has given me hope again</br>  <br>AquaPlus and KEY are bigger mainstream VN companies than Type Moon and they also actually release VNs while you can't say the same thing about Type Moon.</br>  <br>And Clannad is their greatest seller and it does not have sex. Your point?</br>  <br> proper BG artwork <br>God damn it Nasu, get your shit on Steam or something already.<br><br><br> Takeuchi sameface strikes again <br>When will he stop drawing the same characters?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Type Moon still has multiple projects going on, and it's not like Nasu isn't doing work. He wrote the screenplay for episode 25 of UBW.</br>  <br> Shirou with black hair and glasses <br>Really, Takeuchi?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm going to miss the eerie looking kinds-mono color picture backgrounds.</br></br>  <br> Nasu <br> Steam <br>dont give him more reason to make things worse, if he got releases on steam his lazy meter would sky rocket</br></br></br>  Is this an anime or visual novel remake?  <br>This. I don't know what to think about these kind of things.<br>muh atmosphere</br></br>  Keep posting OP, I'm already at the edge of my seat<br>PLEASE respond</br>  <br>Aoko didn't make them. She stole them from someone with better aesthetic sense.</br>  <br> and it's not like Nasu isn't doing work. He wrote the screenplay for episode 25 of UBW. <br><br>In between his playing Bloodborn you mean</br></br></br>  <br>something about Girls work?</br>  <br> She stole them from someone with better aesthetic sense. <br>from dirty red<br><br>VN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Grand Order is also supposed to be coming out in July, and he wrote for that too.</br>  <br>Do you think Takeuchi will made Anime by himself? <br><br>fuck me</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> playing bloodborn <br>that's totally work related though, hes doing story research</br></br>  <br>Fine, just dont expect anything from Nasu wheh Dark Souls 3 is released.</br>  <br>It's dead anon. Let it go.</br>  <br><br>Touko wouldn't make such generic looking glasses.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Shirou can't let anyone at the clocktower know about UBW as it's a forbidden magic and if they find out they'll either seal him or dissect him for study.</br>  <br>It's okay though because Bloodborne is short as shit with the DLC being a ways away so I'm sure he's fine.</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Shit, I forgot about Dark Souls 3</br>  I didn't read Tsukihime. How many did I lost?<br><br> How long is it? </br></br>  <br>Change them how?<br><br>Like he knows they'll never show up otherwise so he's tossing them into Tsukihime?</br></br></br>  <br>Except it is common for students to assassinate each other so why would Waver want the attention of female murderers?</br>  <br>This kills the servant.</br>  ANIME WHEN  <br>it's one of my favorite VNs of all time. First time I read it I was fucking obsessed with it for months. I powered through it in like 3 days</br>  <br>Never!<br>I want to believe.</br></br>  <br>I heard TM stuff is pretty difficult, so good luck with that.</br>  how much would you recommend playing the VN before watching the anime? I dig the overall setting of Tsukihime but am a little bit tired of VNs because I overdid them in the last months. so should I rather <br><br>1. read it right fucking now because it's awesome<br>2. watch the anime<br>3. read it leater (maybe never) don't watch the anime <br>4. wait for the remake<br><br> please help, I don't want to be secondary scum </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In rewriting the story. The maids are still there but the story as a whole and the routes will be rewritten.</br>  <br>It's pretty not that good</br>  <br>not in your lifetime</br>   WHERE IS THE CHAIR REDESIGN   <br>I guarantee it's within 2 years of the remake's release.</br>  <br>There is no Tsukihime anime.<br><br>That's all you need to hear.</br></br></br>  <br> before watching the anime <br>No. Read the VN at your leisure but don't watch the anime.</br></br>  <br><br>Shorter than Fate by a longshot, but still very long. 15 hours or so for full completion.<br><br>If you liked Fate, definitely check it out. Just remember that it's very, VERY dated (hence why it's getting a re-make in the first place).<br><br><br><br>Same. Probably the second VN I ever read after Yume Miru Kusuri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>There is no Tsukihime anime.</br>  <br>The "Tsukihime anime doesn't exist" joke is there for a reason, anon</br>  <br>1<br>When you start reading it you'll be engrossed with it and keep going through each route.<br>I couldn't STOP reading it when I first picked it up</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> There is no Tsukihime anime. <br>that pretty much says everything, thanks guys</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the VN at some point since there isn't and likely will never be an anime, and the remake may or may not be better or as good as the original.</br>  <br>It is said he can get all his students under his banner and reach a power shift in the Clock Tower if he wanted.</br>  <br>Stop spouting shit without a source.</br>  <br>No? They've said multiple times they still aren't sure on whether or not to go all ages or not because there are some integral parts that take place during those "sex" scenes.<br><br>On top of that<br> Vampire story <br> No blood <br><br>Sure thing pal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty. Did Takeuchi make that?</br>  <br>Why not do both.</br>  <br>I don't know about that much, but i was just meaning the fact that surviving the holy grail war earns you respect.<br><br>Im going to finish reading the VN some time soon, but i was wondering if F/ST realta nua is the right one to have, i dont know how to get to the menu where it shows what endings you have gotten.</br></br></br>  I can't believe just a small set of images can make me so giddy  <br>But he doesn't because he is ultimately apathetic which makes Waver a piece of shit in the end,<br><br>Students wouldn't need bodyguards if Waver actually acted like he cared.<br><br>But Waver isn't the teacher from GTO.<br><br>He only cares about his Japanese video games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will it be voiced?  <br>In the last GO interviews they said they will never put sex again in their games.<br><br>Still, that guy does not mean what All-Ages in VN means. It means no sex, blood is fine.</br></br></br>  So nothing on Heaven's Feel?  <br>It's on production now. We would have to wait until Comiket or something like that for more info.</br>  <br> no more nasu sex scenes </br>  <br>It's been cancelled. ufotable are moving onto Hollow Ataraxia for more Luvia goodness.</br>  <br> nothing on HF <br>Sakura has worms. More at 11.</br></br>  <br>no fuck off wormslut</br>  <br>luvia has like 2 scenes in ataraxia</br>  <br>Do you have the quote on that?<br><br>It's a big book so maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>Ataraxia will never be a thing with UBW selling less than Zero, sorry.</br>  <br> PE<br>RU<br>SO<br>NA</br></br></br> </br>  <br>Thank god.</br>  <br>You don't want to imagine what if feels like to stick your dick into a variety of different deep-sea creatures?</br>  So this is the twink that beats two DAAs and rapes most of the cast?<br><br>Quit holding out and post the Roa and Nrvnqsr redesigns.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad for Nasu. If he doesn't feel comfortable writing sex scenes they shouldn't include them.</br>  <br>Oh Jesus.</br>  <br>fuck !</br>  <br><br>The only Luvia you will get is the Drama CD with UBW BD Box II and Lord El-Melloi II Case Files.</br></br>  <br>There might be, wait until the whole thing is posted, if it's posted.</br>  <br>I feel like there are going to be 100% less sharks in the remake and that's sad</br>  <br>I can't envision him being insane enough.</br>  <br>good one</br>    <br>I think odyseus is a safe bet</br>    <br>Then why did he make them have actual key plot elements half the time? Fuck the true end in KT is primarily more sex with Len.</br>  <br> and Lord El-Melloi II Case Files. <br><br>Anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>something like this</br>    <br>Hopefully there is something in here. I at least want an update sometime before winter.<br><br>Luvia in literally two scenes in HA, one of which I think is over the phone.</br></br></br>  <br>Supposedly Takeuchi is the one who wrote them. Or at least outlined how he wanted them to go</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> thick-framed rectangular glasses <br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br> Fuck you. </br>      <br>Because that's how eroge is. He was still uncomfortable with it and it was Takeuchi the one who came up with the actual ideas for the scenes.</br>  <br>Why are all the melty blood designs so perfect</br>  <br><br>in the next 100 years</br></br>  <br>[citation needed]<br><br>Nasu is not uncomfortable about sex, at all. Read Fate/Extra CCC.<br>Nasu is self-conscious about his ability to write erotica.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> UBW needed to sell over 100k for HA to happen <br>I really want to see it animated too ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit he looks so washed out compared to melty. How did I not realize this immediately.</br>  <br>RAIDAAA</br>  <br> not knowing who Shiki is <br><br>fucking die you secondary scum holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What is these?</br></br></br>  <br>It was mentioned in BL by the guys who actually translate and give the information, so it's probably true. Still, they did not know if it was a joke or not.</br>  <br> UBW needed to sell over 100k for HA to happen <br><br>It's going to sell 70k in Japan alone. It's going to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Not being uncomfortable about sex doesn't mean that he does not like writing it, at least when Tsukihime was being written.</br>    Fuck this shit, I thought that was Oreki from the thumbnail and Hyouka s2 was announced.    <br>He looks just like neo-Ciel.</br>  <br>Fuck you we've been waiting 7 years<br>7 YEARS</br></br>  <br>Who's this fluid druid?</br>  <br>I'd love to see the scan.</br>  <br>please don't use double negatives, that hurt to read</br>  <br>That fucking retarded archer design.</br>  <br> wanting a second season of a shit series instead of a well deserved remake </br>  <br> thickrimmed instead of huge round granny glasses <br>Takeuchi going wild with the designs, I can hardly recognize him.</br></br>  <br> That fucking ahoge <br> fucking glasses <br> What is his persona again? </br></br></br>  <br>Probably a good thing. Shiki has always looked like shit.</br>  <br>laid back delinquent</br>  <br>But anon they're not redoing the CGs and the sprites. They are going to rewrite every fucking line. Shiki won't be even a rapist anymore. How can you want that to happen?</br>   Arcade's skirt and intakes are gone   does anyone have that screenshot of shiki raping kohaku ?  <br>So be it, at least he'll have a personality.</br>  <br> which one? </br>   beeing this hyped <br>you guys can wait 3 more years for the villain designs</br>  <br>Damn, he looks extremely moe.<br>Wouldn't his field of vision be different with those glasses though?<br><br>Give him grandpa glasses like Mikiya has, it would be fashionable nowadays.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol, that one bad end from the Ciel route</br>  <br>3 more years of replaying tsukihime, kagetsu, and melty</br>  <br>ORT</br>  <br>But Shiki isn't meant to have one. How the fuck am I supposed to self insert as him if he has a personality?</br>  He got the same treatment Shirou has gotten. Kawaii ass face and thicker super fluffied hair.  There is a Chibichuki chapter somewhere in this book and a lot of artist have featured manga and artwork in it. Will a please get it posted?  TOHNO GLAND STRONG AS EVER  <br>I like it, better than the old VN design. I still prefer the manga design though.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yLK<wbr>3B7SySFs</wbr>  [ ]  IMPORTANT POLL<br>http://strawpoll.me/4784295</br>  <br>I was completely fine with all the other designs, even Ciel's who looks completely different. This on the other hand is way too much.<br>Shiki's not the same without his trademark giant circle glasses</br></br>  <br>are you shit talking about prisma fluffy shirou</br>  <br>He probably does who Shiki is, he's just saying that his redesigned just looks like a black haired Shirou. It's just a bad case of same face, which Takeuchi has always had an issue with.</br>  <br>But it's great?</br>  <br>THE HYPE IS REAL HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Arcuied is not the same without her skirt, either.

The double negative is required for the semantics of the statement that that post is making to work properly.</br>    <br>Everyone is gay for Shiki no matter what their sexual preferences may otherwise be. That doesn't count.</br>  <br>Nasu should threaten him to not let him draw more sabers if he keeps doing those awful sidemouths</br>  <br>this is old</br>  <br>Why exactly did Shiki decide to carry his expensive fruitknife with him again?</br>  <br>Fuck off bot.</br>  <br>No that's new.

That's why the Tsukihime remake is taking so long, because he doesn't give a shit about it but feels like he needs to throw the fans a bone.</br>  <br>That would require Nasu to stop playing Souls games using Saber builds while Takeuchi watches.</br>  <br>I'm only noticing differences in the hair. Shiki's is longer and has a little ahoge.</br>  <br>don't forget the eyebrows.</br>  <br>It looked better in monochrome</br>  <br>It might be easier to tell if their noses didn't look exactly the same.</br>  <br>I don't think arai gives a shit. So we either wait until someone else picks up the magazine, or hope that he decides to scan a couple more pages.</br>  <br>which already makes him a different person</br>  <br>Shiki's features are softer. Shirou's eyes are larger and his chin is a lot more pronounced. They have the same nose but that's because Takeuchi only knows how to draw a curved line.</br>  <br>Is it just me, or does Shiki's new design remind me of Potter Kun?</br>  <br>They look pretty similar to me. They're just positioned differently because they're making different expressions.</br>  <br>If she's a demon/vampire, why would she need to change bodies?</br>  <br>She still has a zipper in those.<br><br>Maybe she is just masquerading as a human and she has to change bodies for some unexplained reason.</br></br></br>  <br> Fate on Steam <br> Saber emoticons <br> Servant cards for badges <br> Profile background with gears <br> &gt;Achievement for finishing Sparks Liner High <br><br>Want.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disappear.<br>This shirt is an eyesore.<br>This shirt.

It's not like this is the first.</br>  <br>I know many people who bought a game on Steam after finishing a pirated version of it. Hell, I would probably buy it myself as well. Count more than half of Beast's Lair and ledditors. Fate is still not popular among normies and Naruto kids, and remember this chuuni writing and autistic worldbuilding would apply to them. We're probably talking Sonic levels here (with creating own Servants and whatnot).

When did it become a flip variant?<br><br> I first thought it was a flip variant when i read the VN, but then they showed how it looks like. </br></br></br>  Translation installer when?<br>MESSAAAAAAAGE!</br>  <br> Wasn't hit knife in a sheath? <br>Yup, it was an old fruit knife.</br></br>  There might be some invisionfree regulation I'm not aware of so I'm posting this here just to be on the safe side.   Alright. One turn is divided into a tactical phase, command phase, and enemy reaction. <br><br> In the command phase, you draw five random cards made up of a random selection of quick, arts, and buster, with the corresponding Servant illustration on them. Picking cards from among these is basically the equivalent of commanding the Servant illustrated on that card to perform the corresponding action.  <br><br> Tactical phase is when you make some preparations, for example, using skills, or Master skills as back up and healing, and Command Spells.  <br><br><br> Now there are five cards per Servant for a total of 15 cards in a deck. And you can basically chain types of attacks together.  <br>But I don't really care about the specifics. <br><br> Now the Ascension thing we saw in the earlier images was basically some form of Servant evolution. If we can some certain items, we'll be able to ascend them to a higher level of existence, and there are apparently four stages of that, with the visuals changing. <br><br> So we have the normal Nero, and then by ascending her we get the Nero with the special arm armor she had on in one of those cards. That's apparently her final evolution also. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Akiha let Shiki have the knife if she didn't want him to know about his past?  <br>I've actually never read Tsukihime. Should I do it now and then compare the remake with the original version or wait for it and play it without CGs hurting my eyes? I'm more interested in the plot and lore than H scenes, so it doesn't really matter for me if they replace them.</br>    <br><br>Could've sworn when he first got it he thought it was a carved iron bar. Why have we got a wood handle now?<br> I think the metal handle would've looked better. </br></br></br>  <br> ingame netplay isn't the greatest. <br>That's what CCCaster is for.<br>Anyway<br> mfw Steam-supported online MB HD </br></br></br></br>  So a few new images have been dribbled forth. I'm jaded enough at this point to just want to ask:<br><br>So what?<br><br>TM has been teasing us with images for years and years now. When are they actually planning to release the game? For the 20th anniversary? 25th? 30th?</br></br></br></br>      <br> Melty netplay program <br>I was referring to CCCaster. I would be worried a steam release would somehow fuck it.</br></br>  <br>Does that mean that Miyamoto will get an actual armor if you level her up?</br>    mfw no crossover shenanigans with Shiki and Mikiya  <br>you mean less</br>  <br>Rider TOO STRONK</br>  <br>from typemoon ace 10 ?</br>    <br>lewd</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>So, are those the only pictures we got?<br> tfw no Arcade </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>probably, there are a lot of featured artist with short manga in it and a chibichuki chapter</br>    <br>so where Arcueid?</br>  <br>There is also text pages but nobody can read runes.</br>  <br>17th anniversary, referencing Shiki splitting Arc into 17 pieces</br>  <br> So what? <br>I'm still a rockstar.</br></br>  <br> tfw no Shiki, Shiki, SHIKI and SHIKI meetup in Ahnenerbe </br>  so where is this page?  <br>I-I recognized Takeuchi's name!</br>    <br>Never. The game will be cancelled in five years after being pushed back multiple times in favor of more Fate projects.</br>    <br><br>What the fuck is going on?</br></br>  Another one?<br><br>What was wrong with the previous adaptation?</br></br>  <br>So you've come this far already?<br>But don't get complacent, you slob!<br>It's only the beginning!</br></br></br>  <br> HARD   GAY </br>  <br>New season of CP never</br>  <br>T-There's still hope! Don't give up!</br>  Is someone scanning the whole thing?  <br>I will, anon. Hell, thanks, I got some motivation from that post.</br>  <br>It's a remake of the VN.<br><br> What was wrong with the previous adaptation? <br>What wasn't wrong with VN would be easier to answer.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you find out Haruhi is voiced by Ryougi </br>  <br>Minamoto, not Miyamoto.</br>  FUCK I CAN FINALLY POST<br><br>FUCK YOU NOTMOOT</br></br>   implying they won't make a new anime to promote the vn <br><br>Based Aniplex and Ufotable.<br><br> Been trying to post this for the last hour ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>But she is not.</br>  <br>Class affinity will also play a major role in the game, so for example against a powerful Lancer boss, you'd compose a team of Servants in a class that would have an advantage over Lancer. <br>Not all Heroic Spirits will have alternate classes, but the ones that fans probably would have wanted to see will be in the game.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for girls work</br>  <br> Nero  <br> only saber <br>BTFO Nerofags</br></br></br>  <br><br>I miss intakes and the skirt.</br></br>  <br>Fujioka, not Suzumiya.</br>  <br>ALL OF MY YES. Since the first time I saw him on the VN i knew that Arihiko will be the best Bro.</br>   Anyway, the other major thing is that it looks like we'll be having a FGO TMA magazine released on the 10th. <br> 160 pages for FGO, more Servants, interviews, more gudaguda order, OP animation materials, prologue drama cd,download code for the game, posters, blahblahblah so on. </br>  <br>So Archer Heracles will probably be a thing. Maybe we will get Archer Karna too.</br>  <br>Kohaku did it behind her back.</br>  <br>I'm reading it, since this thread is almost kill and to attentionfag more, I'll make a new thread and summarize it. <br><br>Wait a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>Launcher</br>  In which we discuss the OST<br><br> mfw Genuine <br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/qscipeuiik.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  fuck season 2  This season had some pretty good piano tracks in general  That entire episode was like watch 2 really hungry polar bears going after a signal penguin.  Something something cunt something alpha something captain  Such an overrated series  <br>Give me more sad/somber pieces like this from S1 and S2 /a/.<br><br>I need to get in the mood to write my shitty novels.</br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/scllcaqpom.mp3<wbr></wbr>  <br>Its pretty much entirely sad piano tracks.<br><br>Not a bad thing really.</br></br></br>  Now that's alpha.

I felt like S1's monologues were more memorable.  <br>8man got worse overall as a character in s2, and I didn't even like his antisocial loner act in s1.</br>  <br>S1 was much slower and actually had time for him to monolouge. S2 was rushed</br>  <br>They're more memorable because he was a twat back then (if you're talking abour Youth is a Lie and Bear speeches)<br><br>As he grows as a character, we dont get those monologues anymore to reflect his growth</br></br></br>  <br>He gets a whole lot less full of himself in S2, and ditches his "being a loner is better anyway" bullshit. <br><br>I suppose the monologues were in tandem with that.</br></br></br>  <br>the batman memes were real in S1. S2 was just melodramatic as hell with no relief.

S2 8man is quite above average.</br>  <br><br>I liked as a drama piece, but there needed to be some closure to it all. I know this is based on a novel series but fuck, the cast just got their baggage out then cut to black. <br><br>Now who knows if we'll ever see the rest animated. We'll most likely learned what happens a year or so from now, in a late night thread that dies after 100 posts. Like so many other series we used to like but lost track of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Given the polls people have been posting in these threads and that Yahari girls and 8man have been dominating them I imagine it will be pretty good.</br>  <br>He's said he's average looking aside from his eyes. Meaning he's probably not really.</br>  <br>You are the type that values hard workers who can effeciently manage resources and adapt to difficult situations on the fly.<br><br>Except that's not Iroha. If that was then she would have been able to handle being President much better than she did in the LN.</br></br></br>   「..ヒッキーならそ、っ言、っと思つた」 <br><br> 由比ヶ浜はにっこりと優しく微笑んだ。その瞬間つつと滴が頰を伝う。俺は<wbr>どうだろ、っ、無様な顔をしていなければいいんだけど。</wbr> <br><br> 俺と由比ヶ浜はお互い顔を見合わせて、小さな頷きを交わしあ、っ。 <br><br> 俺と：^の願いは目には見えない。けれど、たぶんその形はほんの少しずれ<wbr>ていて、びったりと重なり合いはしないのだろ、っ。</wbr> <br><br> だからといつて、それが一つのものにならないとは限らない。 <br><br> 吐き出した分だけ、見えてきて、どこかでつながれる部分がきっとあるので<wbr>はないかと、そんなことを想って俺は雪ノ下に視線をやった。</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Shit, cutest Irohafags' delusion</br>  <br>Except for the fact that the LN has repeatedly stated she is actually a very hard worker and good at her job once she gets the motivation. The problem wasn't her skills as president, but her confidence in the role since she was only a freshmen giving orders to people who were older than her.<br><br>This was a pretty obvious fact that was, once again, repeated multiple times by various character (8man, Sensei, Yukino). So I don't know how you managed to miss that.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the difference between the two manga adaptations?</br>  <br>What the hell man, why does Tobe look so good?</br>  <br>Translate?</br>  <br>My big takeaway from this: holy shit manga Tobe is gorgeous. If I were to switch teams I might actually take him over Totsuka.</br>  This series is just an angsty boku wa tomodachi<br><br>Reminds me of the inner problems that characters felt in Eva. Except in EVA they were well done and resolved. they were subtle at first, then clear. This is just roundabout pretentious bullshit. Every character in this story is just like those guys who kept stalling the Christmas planning.<br><br>Is it just a shit adaptation? Are the LN any good?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>   Prologue 2: The nonsensical ramblings of someone’s memorandum. <br> &gt;There’s something I want. <br> &gt;No matter how much I rack my head over it, I could arrive at only one, permissible answer. But mysteriously enough, it’s accompanied by an echo of ambiguity. <br> &gt;That’s why, I actually don’t have a tangible understanding of what it really is. <br> &gt;However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br> The day Yukino confess to 8man loudly in public is the day my heart gave out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just realized that there's no LN illustration of Rumi's front. Ponkan8 and Watari, please.</br>  <br>I suppose it's not a matter of missing it, but forgetting it entirely. Nevertheless if she proves to be a capable president then the argument I made previously would no longer be applicable.</br>  <br><br>What's going on between Yui and 8man here?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit Tobe</br>  <br> Every character in this story is just like those guys who kept stalling the Christmas planning <br><br>Oh gee I wonder why put the Christmas planning in the story</br></br></br>    <br>Pretty neat.</br>  <br> Yukino, Yui, and 8man only ones always pictured <br><br>Iroha is totally going to win guys.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that's the art from every volume right?</br>  <br>Yes, why?</br>  <br><br><br>Okay so I'm not gay for thinking it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 5 and 6 was when Ponkan8 evolved.</br>  <br><br><br>Fucking gays</br></br></br>  <br>yes you are, but this place is full of them</br>  <br> by far the best character in the series, after the MC <br> introduced very late <br>Why is this shit allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>It isn't, the best character is the second one on that list.</br>  <br>This pathetic piece of shit?</br>  <br>She can make her mistakes, she's still young.</br>  <br>Young or not, she turned into the most cringe worthy character of the entire show.</br>  Nude filter Pls  <br>Man, I wish volume 7 was an episode longer.</br>  Why does Yukino have to be the one to confess her feelings to 8man? Why can't he confess his feelings? <br><br>To that effect, why does Yui have to also? He feels as strongly about both of them as far as Im concerned.</br></br>  いろはす～  <br>Who's more beautiful? Yui or Yukino?</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be Yukino, for all we know Hachiman could try asking her a third time, but this time a different question.<br><br>He could confess to Yui, but with her it's the thing where he has doubts, he may not see her as a nice girl anymore though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui for most of S2.<br><br>I'm not happy about it.<br> Haruno is better looking than both of them </br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha</br>  Iroha winning would solve all the problems, even if it means hurting people.  <br><br>Are the Yukino and Hikki ones the only one with a guitar?</br></br>  I want to marry Yuigahama Yui!    <br>Still dont understand why the designer didn't give Yukino straight hair instead of the dishelved mess she has now.</br>  <br>I post earlier and we get quints</br>  <br>Definitely my favorite though the genuine one is good too.</br>  <br>Yui used to have that punk rock bitch look.</br>  <br>She sort of still did when she went shopping for Yukino's birthday gift with him.<br>She had some cross earrings and a choker.</br></br>  <br>At least we tried.</br>  <br><br>Yui's yuis.</br></br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>I sort of miss her old look.<br>Must be the expression.</br></br>  <br>She looks more delinquent than Saki in that pic</br>  <br>Why is she holding piss in her hands?</br>  <br>How does 8man associate this expression with a nice girl?</br>    <br>Her scarf look plain and old, poorfag confirmed.</br>  <br>Most fanboyish picture ive ever seen</br>  <br>No, NO. <br>Just no.<br>Fuck that was so cute.</br></br></br>  <br>He called her 'bitch' in S1</br>  <br>That was "bitch" as in "slut".</br>  <br>Muh heart is not ready</br>  <br>Whatever</br>  <br>Asked for and delivered, fellow Yuibro.</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/qscipeuiik.mp<wbr>3</wbr> <br>No more Iroha : the song.</br></br>  <br><br>Because she didn't appear in the last episode despite appearing in the OP again.</br></br>  <br>Yui play smartphone, Yukino and 8man reading book.<br>Iroha only stare at 8man :(</br></br>  <br>Yui, both inside and out.</br>  <br>Iroha  can't afford a chair. </br>  <br> chair leg shadows <br> human shadows <br>Oh the quality.</br></br></br>  <br>I think  she cant even buy a book to read so she keep reading 8man's book. <br><br>Poorfag.</br></br></br>  <br>There are chairs right behind her.<br>She's just too lovestruck to pay attention to that.</br></br>  <br>That's a  cheap blow anon </br>    <br>She also  can't afford a cup for tea  either.</br>  <br>Someone, photoshop her a middle finger</br>  <br>Isn't he reading Only Human?<br>She's in for some shit.</br></br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br>i only have this</br>  <br>Satan have spoken so it must be true</br>  <br>Just caught this post at the bottom of the last thread, and I have to disagree about Yui and 8man being a boring teenage relationship.<br><br>It would probably be more like your idea for how the idea for 8man/Yukino would work in reverse, with Yui constantly chipping away at 8man as he tries his hardest to act like he's all kuu- no -dere.</br></br></br>  <br> she only has 4 fingers </br>  <br>yes, that's how many fingers people have, anon.</br>  <br>Yet two 9/10 knock outs are in love with him.

To keep things going they'd have to pull some fresh conflict out of their asses first.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The truck driven by Iroha for her part-time job for Yukino's family. <br>For maximum drama effect.</br></br>   yfw when the service club gets disbanded temporarily because of all the drama. <br> Yukino starts becoming more independent, Yui starts becoming more assertive, and we don't get much of Iroha because she doesn't have an excuse to hang around 8man. <br> No one is at the club (it got disbanded). <br> However, 8man remembers that he left one of his books in the club. <br> He goes to get it and finds a familiar face. <br> It's   yumiko <br> she wanted to make a request regarding hayato. <br> although reluctant at 1st, he accepts her request but states that he is going to be the only one able to help her in her request. <br> Yumiko and 8man start spending time together and they find their relationship organic and fresh due to the fact that there is no romance drama between them. <br> As they get more comfortable with each other, they find that both of them want a genuine relationship. <br> The closer she gets to know 8man, the more she realizes that hayato is a cunt and is only using her to keep other girls away from him. <br> She declares that her relationship with the cunt is the furthest thing from a genuine relationship. <br> She thanks hikio for his help, and apologizes for ending her request so suddenly.  <br> She stops talking to hikio because her request ended. <br> Yumiko falls out of love with the cunt and is now just friends with him and her cliche. <br> There is no more tension in yumiko's group because there is no more romance drama on her part <br> However, something is still prickling in her heart <br> The service club opens shop again and it seems like everyone in the club is doing better than before. <br> The main three girls seem determine to aim for 8man with no minori 2.0 bullshit and no pretense. <br> The three girls await 8man’s arrival at the club but someone else shows up. <br> yumiko formally asks the club to help her ask 8man out because they are the people closest to him. <br> that's how volume 12 ends and we are left with another cliffhanger. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she hadn't met Zai yet. It was only after the school newspaper thing that she began plotting to marry a Light Novel author.<br><br> yfw this is how Watari makes a pass at his kouhai through the novel </br></br></br>  <br>Well, since the love triangle was resolved all that needs doing is Yukino's development and an epilogue.</br>  <br>id be fine with this</br>  <br>man fuck your meme, I thought I had another Yuibro I could throw more lewd at.<br><br>Ahh well, here it is anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> It's not a harem <br>I'd be totally fine with it though.</br></br>  <br> the love triangle was resolved <br>What? They agreed to have one with them going after the prize and not shying away from their feelings.<br><br><br>Please Yuipost more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a Irohafag I would be ok with this as a alternative to Iroha end.</br>  How is Saori Hayami so perfect for Yukino yet so garbage at every single other role she's ever done?  <br>Haruno, the cunt, Komachi as freshmen, Iroha, Yumiko, and so on. It's not like he hasn't got more issues to tackle</br>  <br><br><br>This is my favourite Iroha fanfiction now</br></br></br>  <br>She's autistic so she can relate to Yukino?</br>  <br>Literally the only good thing to come out of Gay Vampires: The Show.</br>  <br> Never being welcomed home by this <br> Pure suffering </br></br>  <br>seconding this. her performance as Smugnoa is a gift.</br>  <br><br>I would TEEN PREGNANT her so hard.</br></br>  One more after this and I'm calling it. It's quarter to noon in yurpoor time, so I should probably get some sleep already.<br><br>The next will be the lewdest yet though, don't worry.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the Yui.<br><br>I wish I had a Yui GF.</br></br></br>  <br>If I was 8man we'd have a baseball team by the time Yui and I hit 30.<br><br>And here's the last one. Spoilered to protect the eyes of the innocent.</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno / Yukinoshita family - will get solved together with Yukino's issue<br>The cunt + yumiko - irrelevant at the moment<br>Komachi as freshman - no issue atm<br>Iroha - depends on what her role really is. If she is meant to be part of competition for the 8inch, then she will be addressed in final arc. Otherwise, no issue.<br><br>So there you have it, there aren't that many issues need to be tackled anymore, unless WW deliberately create new conflict to lengthen the story. For now, only 3 problems left: yukino's issue, fixing 8man personality and find him his genuine thing, romance between major players. All easily done within 2 volumes, 1 if WW is fine with rushed ending</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Yui's promise date. 8man still want to fulfill it with just two of them.</br>  <br>It has been so long, that people probably forget about the context behind the promised date.</br>  <br>That belongs to the "romance between major players", though. It may very well be the final big event during which he profess to her (or reject her if it's not Yui end)</br>  I get the impression after watching EP 13 that Yui would not accept a confession from 8man.  <br>Stop that, anon</br>  Regarding the OP, why the hell did they not keep the first version from S2E1. Shit was so much better<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZqM<wbr>6EnzkUTY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>And Yukino must still give her cookies.</br>  <br> Haruno / Yukinoshita family - will get solved together with Yukino's issue <br>Yukino with Yukinoshita family, but don't forget Haruno has her own issues<br> The cunt + yumiko - irrelevant at the moment <br>At the moment, but from the screentime they have had, it would be weird for Watari to completely forget their issues<br> Komachi as freshman - no issue atm <br>Atm, but WW can still create some bullshit problem like he did with Yukino and her dependency issues<br> there aren't that many issues need to be tackled anymore,unless WW deliberately create new conflict to lengthen the story. <br>Which is what he would do if he wanted to keep milking the series</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It contained too much of the previous season</br>  My dad works at nintendo and 8man dies thanks to truck-kun.  <br>I actually liked a lot of the shots from the second OP, my only real complaint was it gave shitposters fuel with the "muh ideal replica" line timed with a Yui scene.</br>  <br>So this is confirmation that it's Irohafags that keep spamming k-drama shit over and over again?</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/pthbbpcvbp.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>I always thought the "ideal replica" line refers to 8man and Yukino's idealized images of each other.</br>  <br>You do realize that if Iroha ever gets a drama arc that 8man solves, she's going to win, right?</br>  <br>probably but these are shitposters we're talking about.</br>  <br>I got a feeling she would give her cookies to 8man after 8man and Yui heard her request in volume 12.<br><br>Well put that aside i kinda curious how main trio interacting each other after 8man pretty green light inevitable love triangle happen between them.</br></br></br>  <br>8man pretty* much</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/pthbbpcvbp.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br>Thank you, sir.</br></br>  <br>Irohafags do mostly have a hateboner for Yahari no longer being a romcom, but as far as I know the kdrama complaints only come from one or two guys who've shown no affiliation.<br><br><br>More specifically, Iroha needs an arc where something puts a major strain on her relationship with 8man, and he says something to her that's the equivalent of his message with the genuine speech: that he cares enough about having her in his life to work through their problems.<br><br>Even then that only means she's finally in the race for real.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Old 8man didn't want genuine.<br><br>Yui end is genuine end!</br></br>    <br>Yukino's memorandum show how to be genuine became important to her.</br>  <br><br>Of course this could have come from the copying her heroes/ones she loves. Who really knows if her want for genuine was originally her wish.</br></br>  <br>I never understood why some think that suffering is required to 'enter the race', that's not even a requirement for what 8man wants.<br>It's merely a possible consequence for him and others.</br></br>  <br>Brothers!</br>  <br>I'm don't think 8man being potty-mouthed is fitting in that situation.</br>  <br>Shut up, you are irrelevant. Move on</br>  <br>Blame FFF subbing it like that.</br>  <br>I would have liked for her to not have been introduced at all and that other characters would have gotten more time to shine, like Saki, Sensei, Komachi. Heck, I'd take learning more about Hayato's group over Iroha being crammed in so many scenes.</br>  <br>B-b-betsuni</br>    <br>Original  genuine  OP. Is it foreshadowing?</br>      <br> other characters would have gotten more time to shine, like Saki, Sensei, Komachi. <br>They got 7 volumes to shine but didn't do shit, while Iroha just needed vol 8 and 9 to be more relevant than any of them (appart from Komachi)</br></br>        <br><br><br><br>Why does she look like she's going bald in S2</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cancer treatment.</br>  <br>Because she is. Hair loss in women is a tragic problem going ignored all too often.</br>  <br>I want more Miura VS Saki.<br><br>I bet the show will be much more interesting if Yui and Yukino being replaced by Yumiko &amp; Saki.</br></br></br>    <br>I really don't want this to turn into yet another harem, but SOMETHING happening would be nice.</br>        <br>Her bangs just looks awful</br>   tfw Saki will never confess to 8man and get rejected   <br> file name <br>Now that we know that Iroha is a poorfag, there's just no fucking competition anymore.<br>Sorry, Saki.</br></br></br>    <br>Saki is still 10 times better and more genuine than Iroha can ever hope to pretend to be.</br>      <br>Even if it's true, she has less than a tenth of her screentime</br>  <br> implying the anime matters </br>  <br>That's just your take on a character that exists just for the hell of it.</br>  <br> Implying it isn't the same in the LNs </br>  <br>Can I sexualize both?</br>  <br>Have you even read the LNs? Saki gets regular chapters throughout which are almost always cut from the anime.</br>      <br>So Hayato end confirmed?<br>Sounds like a must-buy, no more like a must-gay!</br></br>  <br>Hayato fucking all three girls before going on to become rich while 8man gets his own NHK adventure? Yes.</br>      <br><br>Totsuka confirmed</br></br>  <br>You mean the filler scenes where 8man tries to remember her name?</br>  <br>Who the hell cuts her hair?</br>    <br>Ah so that was what's wrong with her in S2. I didn't notice it  because her lack of appearance </br>  Irohasu~  <br>She does<br><br>She doesn't want to take away from her family by paying for a haircut</br></br></br>  <br>A girl better than you could ever be, little boy</br>    <br> and ditches his "being a loner is better anyway" bullshit. <br>Only after "I want something genuine" and when Hachiman realized he clung unto an ideal self of him.</br></br>  <br> Saki doesn't want to take away funds from her family <br> Iroha wastes money on lipgloss and perfume so she can hang out with random boys </br></br>    <br>Saki and 8man are objectively the best choice of couple, but Watari is too much of a pleb to go with it</br>  You know all this "try to be genuine" is kind of retarded.<br><br>All of them actually try so hard to be someone that they are not just so they can keep the service club alive.<br>There come a point where they realize it just isn't working and there aren't just meant to be together when all of them are just suffering right now.<br>Why can't they just be themselves and be happy? All these searching for X is kind of stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BLAME SENSEI</br>  <br>That's what is going to happen in the last volume, retard<br><br>Realizing that your way of living isn't quite right is very common in high school dramas</br></br></br>  <br><br>Their fault for listening to someone in her 30s that is still single</br></br>  <br> Listening <br>She forced them.</br></br>  <br> Why can't they just be themselves and be happy? <br><br>Huh? Wasn't that the point? Didn't you hear/read any of 8man's monologue?</br></br></br>  <br>Sensei did nothing wrong</br>  <br>I am talking about Yui and Yukino.</br>  <br>Because 8man would have been so much better off completely alone <br><br>He now has a decent shot with 3 girls and a small chance with a few others. He's become less of an edgelord and can hold a normal conversation with 99% of people.</br></br></br>  <br>But Yukino doesn't even have a JIBUN WOOO</br>  <br>This. Too much drawn out drama.</br>    <br>Yukino has some plot related reason and is a legitimate autist<br><br>Yui is just a cock hungry moron</br></br></br>  Yui's mum is clearly best girl.  <br><br><br>Haruno ending is for real.</br></br></br>  Who /yahallo/ here  <br> like Yui except older and can actually cook <br><br>Yui should kill herself for being so inferior</br></br></br>  <br>I won't say what she did was wrong or right, but she definitely responsible for all things that happened. Also while sensei like new 8man, Haruno said that the new 8man is boring, so i hope for some clash between them in the future.</br>  <br>Haruno</br>    <br><br>this bitch is a darkness midnight evil motherfucker, if she goes for 8man she will win</br></br>  <br>Well, I'll agree with you on that, sir</br>  <br><br>it is shit but you cant stop watching it because it feels like we're owed a fucking resolution to everything, is this how smackheads feel?</br></br>  <br> basically begging him to be with her <br><br>but she fucking keeps not asking him out or telling him, Yukino literally stepped off at the penguins to let it go down, but Yui DIDNT DO SHIT</br></br></br>  <br><br>WAKA FUCKING NAIYO WITH ALL THIS SHIT<br><br>FUCK THIS SHOW</br></br></br></br>  <br>Age and growing up will mend that and also ensure some very big boobs</br>  <br>Is Haruno autistic?<br><br>She goes outside just to attack people.</br></br></br>  Where did you guys get the OST in the first place? I don't see it up on Nyaa.  <br>She'll still be dumb as mud though.</br>  <br> Original genuine OP. <br> Temporary genuine OP <br> Foreboding </br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't want Yukino to be a fake replica, he wants the real Yukino. He's willing to struggle, cry etc. to achieve that. Throughout the series, Hachiman has been jumping through hoops just to, not only get closer, but also stay close to her.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she has nothing else to do</br>  <br> needing to read into an anime-original OP for "foreshadowing" <br><br>Small pickings for Yukinofriends.</br></br></br>  <br>Aging won't fix her being inept at every womanly skill imaginable</br>  <br>She's great at spinning bowls though.</br>  <br>And giving boobjobs, r-right? That's gotta count for something.</br>  <br>Platonically, of course.</br>  <br>she has natural talent</br>  <br>Playing video games, watching anime ect, ect.</br>  <br>Sure. I guess we'll find out in volume 12.</br>  <br>We've known since 9 though. Genuine has never been strictly romantic. He feels the exact same way about Yui.</br>  <br><br> 8man decides on a friendship route, with a promise to meet up in the future with Yukino and Yui <br> Distance causes their relationships to drift apart <br> 8man takes a job as a wage slave and finds little excitement in his life <br> Then on one afternoon he gets a new manager and sees Yumiko walk in <br> All day and evening is hell for him, and worse yet he's dragged to the local bar after work of all times to "celebrate" his new boss <br> As people from work stream out, Miura gets more drunk and confides to 8man that Hayama was a cunt, and just kept her around to keep other girls away <br> Saki being the owner of the bar, gives 8man a knowing look, and although he gets free drinks in her bar, he never drinks more than one glass, and has to escort Miura's drunk ass back to her place. <br><br>Perfect setup for a what if, for other characters to shine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sensei is cute!<br><br>Cute!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which, the "studying abroad" thing seems like a pretty huge flag that the club is going to go their separate ways in the end.</br>  <br> yfw it's Yui that study abroad </br>  Anyone has that pixiv image with Yukino throwing max coffee away?  <br>I thought Yukino already studied abroad. Or went to middle school or whatever.</br>  <br>IIRC She spend elementary in japan, junior high overseas, and then return back to japan for HS<br><br>Though my memories are quite unreliable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yahallo'ing yui's gooeys.</br></br>  <br><br>Yui told 8man to go follow Yukino when that happened in the LN.<br><br>And people tell me Yui wasn't trying to sink her own ship to save Yukino's.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With Iroha specifically, if some form of drama was to revolve around Iroha, I can only envision two plausible scenarios:<br><br>Ostracization: Iroha become truant from Sobu High after the bullying escalates and potential rumours surfaced about Iroha started by the girls. Hachiman visit Iroha at her house and have a heartfelt conversation that he understand what it is like to be alienated and alone and he'll prevent Iroha school life from becoming what he experienced himself. So, the result is a school event and at the school event drama unfurls where neither Hachiman nor Hayama can resolve it but Hachiman geared the resolution where Iroha expertise came into play and is at the forefront to resolve the drama. Iroha cascades her cute act in front of the girls and they are appeal to perceive Iroha differently from before.<br><br>Idolatry: Iroha did mentioned she admire "Haru-san-senpei" and Hachiman ruminated if Iroha did become like Haruno he'll prevent that from happening. So, I can envision Iroha receiving advice from Haruno and Iroha did what Haruno told, resulting in Iroha jeopardizing her presidency. Hachiman discover Iroha took advice from Haruno, Hachiman mindfuck Haruno until Haruno suffer from an existential crisis and save Iroha plus her presidency.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohas arc is finished already</br>  <br> idolatry <br><br>Haruno stop messing with highschoolers' life, she's not your sister</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Iroha is nearly as important as you want her to be.</br>  <br> The moment they fell in love with each other. </br>  <br> with each other </br>  <br>It seems pretty likely that, if she's been abroad once, she'll probably do it again for college. In recent developments she's changed her career plan to follow the club, but that's treated as part of her dependency issue and will be developed on.<br><br>Then again her original choice was following Haruno/her mother anyway, so the most likely outcome is for her to choose something different from either side once she finds "her own path". Either way the club being able to stay together after highschool seems pretty unlikely, this is a coming of age story after all.</br></br></br>  So who will Yui's cop out bf be when Yukino wins?<br><br>I'm hoping for Saika, so she has to live in a marriage where her husband is a homosexual.</br></br>  <br>8man's too caught up in his autism to be in love with anyone now, let alone way back in season 1.</br>  <br> The cookies man  of course</br>  <br> Idolatry: Iroha did mentioned she admire "Haru-san-senpei" and Hachiman ruminated if Iroha did become like Haruno he'll prevent that from happening. So, I can envision Iroha receiving advice from Haruno and Iroha did what Haruno told, resulting in Iroha jeopardizing her presidency. Hachiman discover Iroha took advice from Haruno, Hachiman mindfuck Haruno until Haruno suffer from an existential crisis and save Iroha plus her presidency. <br>The sad thing is that I can totally see this happening. Fuck you Haruno</br></br>  <br>I thought it was pretty hilarious when Iroha says she'll have "Yukinoshita-senpai" teach and it turns out to be Haruno she was referring to.</br>  <br><br>Well, clearly. The novel itself is at least one or possibly two more volumes from completetion. I was only theorizing an outcome IF Iroha did have drama.</br></br>  <br> 8manxYuki <br> YuixSaika <br>This is going to result in 8man cheating on Yukino with Saika, while Yukino cheating on 8man with Yui at the same time.</br></br></br>  <br>Hayama end confirmed.</br>  <br>Hayama cucking Hachiman into despair is the only good end.</br>  <br>Hate sex when?</br>  <br>There was that theory that Yui and Yukino are both actually in love with Hayama and only like 8man as a friend<br><br>That would be the ultimate ending. To find out that the real harem belonged to the popular nice guy all along.</br></br></br>  <br>* Hayama x Yukino study abroad confirmed</br>  <br>Why do people think that going abroad is the only way "she chooses something for herself"? She can still choose to go for liberal arts or sciences or whatever, as long as she makes the decision for herself.</br>  <br>Obligatory reminder that this was more genuine than anything 8man or Hayama have ever said to either of their cliques.</br>  <br>"study"</br>  <br> I don't like you <br>What is that? The 4kids sub version or something?</br></br>  <br>Hayato: Hachiman, no homo, but I want to fuck your boypussy.</br>  Thinking of watching pic related. I hear it's pretty good. Thoughts?

It loses the air and lightness if it sits too long on table before it is eaten. It would collapse on itself and become a stodgy mess. That's why souffles are always served straight from the oven and eaten immediately when served.<br><br>His souffle-style egg probably lost its airiness when sitting on the table/counter waiting to be selected for consumption. Thus, losing attractiveness. Food is eaten first by sight, smell, and even sound. The mouth is the last to eat. His eggs done in a souffle-style would have collapsed and lost its airiness before people could get a taste and experience the unique selling point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her mom is a nord IIRC.</br>  <br>ah ok, that makes a lot of sense thanks<br>it's odd that he didn't think of that happening though.</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese/Danish, LeDouche.</br>  <br>There's no E10 in their area. They're going to job to the Aldinis because they can't work together.</br>  <br>Well, that's true (I'm still not sure how he wasn't aware of the souffle's shortcomings in a buffet setting). But if you had paid attention to the OP, he'll improvise by flipping multiple souffles simultaneously.</br>  <br>I skip the op because I can't stand the singer's voice</br>  <br> they can't work together <br>And how sure are you they wouldn't get their act together once the heat is on?

What did you think of Planetes? I really enjoyed it. Made me laugh and made me feel really down. I love the OP, but I feel the ED is a bit weird after the way some episodes end.  Give it uo.<br>moot is not going to come back.</br>  <br>Everyone knows that</br>  Possibly my favourite anime of all time.  <br>I wish they'd do a NA blu-ray release</br>  Made me want to go into space.  <br>Well, congratulations.<br>You are in space.</br></br>  There were some amazing moments and some parts I thought were kind of a mess (the last arc was heavy on that). But overall I enjoyed it, the high points were worth it.  <br>You know what I meant assface, actually going away from earth into space.</br>  <br>Sadly, I don't think it's ever going to happen.</br>  <br>If it's getting out of the gravity well, then sure, you're facing a lot of trouble. I'd sure like to do the same, but at the same time I wonder if it'd actually be worth it, at our current technological level.<br>It's hard work getting up, it's hard work getting down, and you can't stay there for too long. (ignoring the financial aspect)<br>In that light, it might be more practical to emulate with VR + air cushion.</br></br></br>  <br>The current ISS astronauts are there for an entire year</br>  <br>It's not healthy even though they keep up a regular workout.</br>  <br> The american astronaut has a twin brother who is also an astronaut. They are going to compare him to his brother when they come back. He's 50 too</br>  How did we go from this...  I watched not too long ago and I was a bit disappointed after the years of people hyping it up. Still liked it, just expected more.  To this?  Probably the only hard sci-fi anime series ever.<br>Also very gud.</br>  <br>Yelling is the most popular form of communication : the show.</br>  <br>I've seen a few people mention this and I don't get it. They don't yell that often and it's always well justified.</br>  <br>the manga is arguably better</br>  <br>Only David's JoJo can top Planetes in the yelling department.</br>  <br>I don't like the way the manga handled Tanabe very much. I think it's the pacing, but the relationship just kind of happened like it was on a schedule. Jumping straight from 'here they are meeting for the first time' to 'LOOK HOW CRIPPLING THIS SEXUAL TENSION IS' didn't exactly sell it for me.</br>  Unpopular opinions time:<br><br>I liked the show. Liked most of the characters.<br><br>Hated the protagonist.<br><br>He was an arrogant, selfish, depressing arsehole, and he never grew up at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unpopular opinion </br>  <br>because it ruined the show for me<br><br>most dont seem to think he was that bad</br></br></br>  <br> most dont seem to think he was that bad <br>Pretty sure half of Planetes fans got fed up with MC bullshit. I sure did.<br><br>Anime orignal Laurel and Hardy suck ass too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think he should've fucking begged Tanabe for forgiveness. He was the cunt of cunts towards easily the best thing to ever happen to him. The shit she went through because of his (granted, space-PTSD invoked) callousness towards her was ludicrous. She loved him with a purity few will ever experience and it was more than likely her first time ever putting her heart out there like that.<br>Well, at least he improved.</br></br>  <br> Pretty sure half of Planetes fans got fed up with MC bullshit. I sure did. <br><br>Reckon? I don't see that in these threads. I often see people excusing his behaviour with muhspacePTSD and muhshittyexperiences.<br><br><br>Improved? Barely.<br><br>I think the whole thing was handled poorly by the show, and eventually by the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You copy?  What did everyone think about this scene?  <br>COPY THAT</br>   I like the dub   <br>What if the coffin fell down against the daughter house</br>  <br>It's pretty freaking good.</br>  <br>Ai kopi!<br><br>I liked it. Tanabe was out of order, but people get way too hung up on that. They also miss the point that she actually had no way of chucking it into the atmosphere. Physics doesn't work like that.<br><br>I do too, what frustrates me is the lazy as fuck mixing. Undub has cool details like digital interference on the radios, as well as better general leveling. It's also worth noting that the dub changed a couple of sound effects and even a track or two. Go rewatch the rocketcockblock in both, it really makes a difference.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are there literally 0 figures made for this show? I want my space suits  <br>I agree, I'd love one of the debris suits. They're probably my favorite piece of technology design ever. Those helmets, man.</br>  <br>You should watch more scifi.</br>  <br>He's right. Hard sci-fi make for pretty slim pickings.</br>  <br>He is wrong.<br>He didn't say there aren't many. He said Planetes is the only one.</br></br>  <br>Re-read his post.</br>  <br> [Probably] the only hard sci-fi anime series ever. <br> the only <br>Do you have difficulty understanding English?</br></br></br>  <br>He qualified his statement with 'probably'. He didn't say 'literally', anon.</br>  <br>Probably doesn't mean "there's others". It means he wasn't sure about his statement, and he was right to be indecisive because he was wrong.</br>  <br>Furthermore, your use of the word literally is funny.<br>Literally means that it's exactly what the words say. That is not mutually exclusive with probably, which quantifies on a different level.<br>Things can be described to be probably literal.</br></br></br>  Maybe we should talk about Planetes in this Planetes thread.  <br>What planets would you travel to if you had a spaceship and cute pilot?</br>  <br>Not really Planetes.</br>  Please read the guide before asking questions.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>at least this one was not made 40min before the old thread died</br>  Damn that looks fantastic. Is that a GK?  These threads have literally turned into reddit/tumblr.<br><br>How do we fix it?</br></br>  <br>Remove swordshit.</br>  <br>It is. I hope GSC's is as good.</br>  <br>I think we have bigger problems. As in, fatter.</br>  <br>Go back to telling Mikushit and homoshit to fuck off.<br>Even less than a year ago, attitudes were so different.</br></br>   FREEing <br>Guess I'll wait for post release pictures.</br>  <br>How about not metashitposting in the third comment?<br><br><br>It probably won't be. I suspect it isn't going to be the damaged version, for one thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Start posting more Pochaco perhaps?</br>  <br><br> implying metashit is better <br><br>Just stop and post figures.</br></br></br></br>  <br> comment </br>  <br>you are part of the problem</br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with TR.</br>  <br>Post more lewd figs and even more bath loli</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thread already made shit by metaposters.

Do you think they will turn out alright?!? I heard their levi figure was aids but i have hope    Thank you mister postman.  <br>Don't respond to generic everybody replies, nobody reads questions. Or tell them to fuck off. <br><br>We seem to go on a cycle of some faggot posting <br> Post your preorders <br> How do you make your money <br> How many dicks have you sucked <br><br>And people give countless responses every single time. Nobody cares about any of these questions, it just fills the thread up with nothing. We went for a good period last time were anybody asking for people to post their preorders would be told to fuck off, now people respond because they've found websites that make them all pretty instead of being the mfc thumbnails. Christ, I've checked the profiles of some of these faggots and I can understand why Stalker-anon does what he does, because it's always an 18 year old girl or some mfc-blogging faggot. <br><br> I can't believe I'm responding to one of these questions myself. I want to die. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm crazy for Miku figs so I doubt that I'll be able to give you a fig of the year without much bias. But if consider other characters.

Don't like it? Stop fucking responding.</br></br></br></br>  Just had this bunny arrive today, got her for 5.5k including shipping from the HS sale.  <br> tfw you will never be stalked </br>  <br>I hope the next sword nendo will be Kasen.</br>  <br>The shoes look so fucking big.</br>  <br>Only the kuroneko's ones</br>  <br>This is easily going to be my favorite figure forever.</br>  <br><br>That's a really great figure, shame it's a GK.</br></br>  <br>Also no nipple.</br>  <br>I prefer Alter's version, even with the faded colours</br>  <br>I hadn't even noticed. That's oddly disappointing.</br>  <br>Several artbooks. I made the mistake of using Sal, now I just have to hope my package arrives before I leave for vacation.</br>  Anyone pre-ordering?  <br><br>That's a very unpopular opinion.</br></br>  <br>You sure? I don't think even my sisters had shoes that big compared to their feet.</br>  <br>Her breasts don't look as big as they're supposed to be in that picture. Needs more meat</br>  <br>I liked that it was more detailed, especially her clothes. MF's feels quite flat.</br>  <br>Enjoy your broken figures and figures that look nothing like the protype. Most of their figs turned out shit. At this rate they heading towards griffon territory.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but Alter's has better shading and detail. Look at the cape for example.<br>The pose is less interesting, and the colors seem to be an issue, but everything else about Alter's is better.</br></br>  <br>Those tits need some gravity or a tighter wrapping.</br>  <br><br>Only people who missed pre-orders believe that.</br></br>  <br>But the hair color is wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>The only thing Alter did better was the boobs, everything else is worse on her; the pose, the colors, and the art style.<br><br> I still bought it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I certainly fit that bill. Don't even know why I waited to order her. Now I have to hope she doesn't balloon on the aftermarket.</br></br>  <br>Best IS</br>  <br>I understand you weren't here before that aired.</br>  Ugh amazon.jp increased the shipping rates for figures internationally. USA is now 1.6k per 1kg of weight (up from 1k to 1kg of weight), Europe is now 1.8k up from 1.2k to 1kg of weight.  Friendly reminder that checking your EMS tracking page every 15 minutes doesn't make your package show up any faster.  Just paid for Mordred and the FE:If N3DS cover plate which i was lucky enough to see back instock yesterday.  <br><br>That blows. Should've ordered stuff I wanted earlier</br></br>  <br>Fuck. I guess this is goodbye for me.</br>  <br>Check the archive. There's about 4 pages between 2011 and KLK, and over 75 pages between KLK and now.<br>The early 2014 ones are almost exclusively KLK.</br></br>  <br>Best taste</br>  Will NY stock the aniplex+ Rin?  Who ready for this month?  <br><br> IS <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>Still the best deal around I believe, between the japanese sales tax reduction and the fact that they use a 'cheap' shipping weight. IE dark angel olivia is only 1.7kg weight shipped (~2.7k yen), as opposed to some place like amiami which would add a ton of packaging and crap and it would end up being like a 3kg package and you'd have to pay 5k+ for ems.<br><br><br>Pretty much.. I was going to order like 20 figures and noticed the shipping was like 28k and it seemed off even though I have like 6 1/4ths in my cart.. did a little math and decided to check out amazons shipping fees page where I noticed the increase in price. It's not a big deal, but it is a little annoying.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br><br>I don't want to pay $100 now for something that won't be out for a year, mr shill.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br>Can't they range ban this fucking faggot cunt already?</br>  New Buyfag here, I bought a Super Sonico Campus Life figure at a recent convention.<br><br>I've since pre-ordered Junai Kajitsu Shii Kiya Cover Girl Natsuiro Shoujo "Manatsu-chan".<br><br>Don't really know what I'm getting myself into but I like it.<br><br>Been wanting to get into figurines for a while now, I read the buyfag guide ages ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd choice.</br>  <br><br>She's there now, but you can't order her.

But I will limit myself with lewd figurines.</br>  <br><br>All harems are lazy and mostly shit, but IS is especially terrible. Just vapid wish fulfillment trash.</br></br>  <br>i didnt want any lewd figures but when i got my first lewd one i was hooked they really get my dick hard</br>  <br>It's between that and Alter's Beethoven. But I am not counting out wedding dress Saber or the Maiko Kyouko and Sayaka yet either,</br>  <br>I would get some tame figures but I'm not up-to-date with anime.<br>Most of the good figures for shows I watched before are gone.</br></br>  <br>what did he post?</br>  <br>I too, can't wait for best IM@S.</br>  <br> what did he post? <br>shill link</br></br>  <br>Heh, I do too, but what usually ends up happening is either the figure sells out or the price never drops lower than I expect it too .. and eventually sells out. Worst case scenario, the price increases.<br><br>The mika jougasaki figure just sold out, I watched it suddenly have a '20 left in stock' notice and some jackasses on amazon bought up the rest of the stock in like 5 minutes. It makes sense to do, but it's pretty lame. Once amazon is out of the way they can resell all the figures they bought for 1-2k profits or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Referral link shit</br></br>  <br><br>I never really got the point of reselling figures outside of exclusive stuff. The profits are marginal unless you have some kind of middle man cutting the shipping/fees. <br><br>Even the exclusive/long OOS stuff doesn't exactly fly off the shelves. Sure it may be worth 30k, that doesn't mean you're gonna get that much immediately if at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki <br>mah nigga</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well fuck me, finally a good looking Rias fig. I thought it would never happen. Embrace Japan isn't a great maker, but they're recent stuff has been better.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I believe the shipping fees inside japan are cheap. There used to be a 1 figure order limit on items for international customers, (don't know if it has changed) so I doubt someone from the USA or whatever bought them all up. <br><br>It was probably just some japanese person or business that felt that buying 10-20 of that figure at 7,800 yen was a good deal and there was profit to be made eventually. I mean if they posted on other amazons and stuff they could probably sell to stupid people for pretty big profits. They could also post on amazon.jp because the price will likely go up. The cheapest sealed version of that figure is now 10.8k, the people bought up the 1-2 cheap ones by 3rd party sellers going for 9k and 10k. Could potentially give pretty good returns, but as you said, your money could be tied up for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>See: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;119163536 </br>  Quality is ehhhhhh  <br>Fuck off to tumblr, landwhale.</br>  <br>I agree with them for what its worth.

Featherine hit her head and turned into Hanyuu, basically. <br><br>Hanyuu was responsible for Rika looping back and time over and over, but didn't orchestrate the events of her death. She was an irresponsible douchebag, but not malicious.</br></br></br>  <br> that spoiler <br>So time is different for Hanyuu/Featherine? Since Seacats take place after Higurashi, you'd expect Featherine to come after Hanyuu</br></br>  <br>I think it's supposed to be that Featherine existed, became Hanyuu, then turned back. Either that or Hanyuu branched off and became a new memory.<br><br>It's vaguely referenced in EP8 when Lambda muses about how once, in the past, Featherine took heavy damage to her memory disk and it created a bug in her existence.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you ask him if he thinks he would ever do anything Umineko-related again or if he's washed his hands of it completely? I still dream of that fandisc he promised years ago but never delivered on.</br></blockquote>]
