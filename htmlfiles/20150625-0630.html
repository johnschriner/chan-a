[ Reminder that 1995 and up is not "le 90s kids", it's millennials. 95 is not "the most underrated birth year", it's deservedly hated. Gen Z killed anime by popularizing moe.  When I grew up in the 90s, kids still played with Lego, played outside without fear of pedos kidnapping them, and acted like kids 'till they hit 14, like they should. Much more family-friendly and wholesome, less degeneracy. We had great anime like DBZ, Sailor Moon, Gundam Wing, Lupin the III, and Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as very good cartoons like "Dexter's Lab" and "Courage the Cowardly Dog"  But then, starting with the turn of 9/11, and certainly by 2008, I noticed kids were declining in quality. They liked to dress up as girls and wear makeup. They played outside less and became couch potatoes. They loved Spongebob, a sick, twisted, perverse, flamboyant character who signed the posteriors of mucle men and ripped his underwear during a concert. They started playing shit like the Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Anime went into decline, with total and utter shit like "Naruto", "One Piece", "Yu Gi Oh", "The Prince of Tennis", "MAR", "Idaten Jump", and "Code Lyoko". Not to mention the shitty cartoons Gen Z grew up with: "Squirrel Boy", "My Gym partner is a monkey", "Camp lazlo", "Miguzi", "Back to the Barnyard", "Kappa mikey", and "Tak and the power of juju".  There was also a huge shift in personality. When I was going to school we only caught the tail end of that whole 'self esteem' movement that turns children into self centered asshole who expect the world to be given to them. 95 and up, that shit was entrenched from the first grade.        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan - Mangekyou Sharingan techniques like Susanoo and Amaterasu - Super Strength - Great Medical skills - Chakra Chains - Healing Bite  Which of the two will be better?                     </wbr>   I dunno, but Sarada should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.    HAHA THIS FAGGOT. TRY HAVING AN SAUCE AS YOUR DAD AND CUCKURA AS YOUR MOM    So, its all quiet on the spoiler front?    tfw Mitsuki took a bite of gum-gum    Why do you all believe that Boruto can use Chidori? It makes much more sense that the is using Rasengan with Raiton.    Orochimaru does that stretching thing all the time why does no one make luffy jokes about him.       but [Sarada/Himawari/Naruto/Hinata/Shik<wbr>adai] should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.</wbr>     No wonder no one replied to that. Naruto is not in the title and there isn't a naruto picture.    Because he only stretch his neck and puke himself all the time    0:28  Konohamaru confirmed being Sarada-Mitsuki-Boruto sensei      Because in the trailer when lightning appears around his hand the typical sound of chidori is heard.  There are many raiton jutsus and none sound like chidori, so that's why it seems boruto will have both the rasengan and the chidori.      Don't forget the Uzumaki chains in case she turns out to be Karin's daughter.    And you can tell which one of these two threads the mods will delete.    How does Naruto's kid get snake shit and chidori?    Doesn't really look like either. He doesn't have a chakra ball in his hand and the lightning is all around him rather than lighting up his arm/hand. Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?    Sasuke trained him.     - Chakra Chains   - Healing Bite  Karen is not her mother.       Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin  Ain't fucking happening. He may be a cheeky shithead, but he is not snake-user tier edgy. When she grows up Sarada could pull a neat snake lady act with that summoning contract, though.        It most likely his own technic - a combination of Sasuke's and Naruto's favorite moves.    Yes she is did you even read Gaiden?     Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin   Toad Summoning    Sage Mode   Super Strength   Great Medical skills   Chakra Chains   Healing Bite  I didn't see any of that shit in there            It looks nothing like a rasengan.    Does he not know that his father is an orphan?    I can't figure out why his eyes seem strange to me    That's dark history He's a sweet summer child     His eyes a lighter blue than Naruto's, probably due to Hyuuga genes.    Doesn't he know that his teammate grew up 12 years without her dad or that Shikadai is in the exact same situation as him?    It should easily be Salad Because she's Tsunade with Sharingan  It will be Burrito Because he dripped out his dad's penis.        Quote's wrong. He actually says:  "This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!"   He'd be a real class-A shithead if he threw Hinata under the bus like that. Threw her like he did his sister's cake.       It's the same color as Naruto's. They just look weird because of the actual decent animation.    Shikadai's mom isn't a doormat   Did this character have any purpose other than being typical evil fujobait? I just finished it and he made no sense at all despite all the wasted screentime. He didn't even contribute to anything as everything he did was a waste.  He was the most popular character.  Show was literally about Slaine.   The show was literally about him. Are you fucking stupid?   The story was about Slaine.  he was a plot device and also so heavily plotarmored nothing remotely bad happened to him for slaughtering people. feelgood ending.  this points to him being the main character.    You can change Ass with a talking shit, and nothing of value would be lost. She's a great plot device in that retrospect.   You can stop trying anon, nothing will change the amount of love he gets    That's a picture of Slaine, the one you're talking about is Inaho. Don't mix them.   I was never convinced that Slain was a bad guy. The development was awful.  He could have been a good character, but they decided to just make him a really shitty Char clone.   Well I doubt he went to jail for being too good    Eh, the whole plot of S2 was pointless. The show should have ended with Inaho just killing Saazbaum as a generic monster of the week and war ending. Slaine really did do nothing worthwhile.     I'm not trying to justify his actions, he clearly massacred a lot of people. It's just his decent to 'villain hood' was weak and unconvincing.     As shit as Eggboy was, at least everything he did wasn't pointless and stupid    Typical landwhale    He got some sort of character arc in S2, but it was really sterile and dull. You could remove it completely and literally nothing would change.    The director(?) basically stated the the whole purpose of the show was to break Slaine down to nothing, a.k.a reset to "Zero"  So no, he doesn't.      He was a shittily written character who had potential  Like everything else about the show     To be fair you could do the same with Slaine and Inaho too. They all have the personality of a wet blanket.     implying that if somebody has good taste he is a landwhale   My fucking sides, trolls are really desperate in these threads      AZfags Circle jerk Thread   Holy shit, Fuck-off you fucking cancer.     That doesn't answer OP's questions. But if  is true it explains it. But makes it even more baffling. Guess there's no point really thinking about bad characters from bad shows anyway. Writers must not even have known what they were doing.    Meant to quote      liking a character from A/Z   liking a fuccboi   good taste   being a hambeast   Kill yourself promptly.        As expecting from a disgusting pile of shit    Very well then   Did this character have any purpose other than being typical evil fujobait?   Yes, Inaho and him were the protagonists, but more focus was put on Slaine's progress and change as a character.    I just finished it and he made no sense at all despite all the wasted screentime.   That's your own opinion, you were probably cheering for Earth side and their focus of the story and didn't pay much attention to moon base characters.    He didn't even contribute to anything as everything he did was a waste.   He kills Trillram and prevents him from telling Saazbaum that the princess is still alive. He saves the lives of the Earth team in the fight with Femiane. He saves Saazbaum and the princess and gains political power through Saazbaum. He keeps a good relationship with Lemrina and convinces her to trust him so he can still deceive everybody about the princess. He becomes a count and defeats another count in a duel, thereby gaining a landing castle and another kat for his subordinate.   There is no point in discussing taste anon, especially with a person who has bad taste like you.   making assumptions about people on the internet  You can imagine me however you like anon, in the end you can't know anything about me and I can heartily laugh at you.                     And boy did Slaine was broken down.   What was the point of THIS character?    he bumps a dead thread full of shitposting from page ten     That's because he's in jail or custody of Inaho.     That's your own opinion, you were probably cheering for Earth side and their focus of the story and didn't pay much attention to moon base characters.  I wasn't cheering for either. What moonbase "characters"? The manservant even blander than Inaho? The pink princess whose character solely exists to be another angsty plot device? Slaine, who is as sensible and congruent as he is happy? All of them were pointless just as much as earth side. None aside from Slaine had any character arc. And his was lazy and inconsistent.   He kills Trillram and prevents him from telling Saazbaum that the princess is still alive. He saves the lives of the Earth team in the fight with Femiane. He saves Saazbaum and the princess and gains political power through Saazbaum. He keeps a good relationship with Lemrina and convinces her to trust him so he can still deceive everybody about the princess. He becomes a count and defeats another count in a duel, thereby gaining a landing castle and another kat for his subordinate.   And you realize this *entire* sideshow meant nothing? His wild princess goose chase just led to this shit extending to another pointless season of nothing because he acted the fool. When everything could be resolved in one season if he didn't. I don't think you can process how fucking awful and useless the entire 2nd cour was.        He's the main character.   It was a bad show, I say it in every thread, even though I'm a Slainefag. It was really, honestly bad. The setting was lacking, the characters were plain, the good end and the princess were forced. The OST was decent and the animation not bad.   And you realize this *entire* sideshow meant nothing? His wild princess goose chase just led to this shit extending to another pointless season of nothing because he acted the fool. When everything could be resolved in one season if he didn't. I don't think you can process how fucking awful and useless the entire 2nd cour was.   Yes, but he did contribute and he did do something. If you say that entire sideshow meant nothing that means every loser never amounted to anything. He didn't conquer Earth and he lost, but that doesn't mean he did nothing.         He kills Trillram and prevents him from telling Saazbaum that the princess is still alive.   Except not long after even Cruhteo and Saazbaum figure out FROM HIM that she is.    He saves the lives of the Earth team in the fight with Femiane.  Good lotta help that was when he shoots first and asks questions later.   He saves Saazbaum and does a lot of other bullshit  So basically he's just another character who is a walking drama tool making irrational decisions. And you wonder why OP asked what was the damn point?              liking a fuccboi  Wasn't that Inaho? Slaine we know was hetero, while Inaho can't get enough of Slaine's dick. He acts like a jealous and possessive boyfriend in the latest CD drama.      The OST was decent and the animation not bad.  Are you retarded?     No. You are not funny doing this every thread and you are not fitting in.    Everything that he did do, served no purpose but to artificially prolong a boring, badly written show. In the end, it made no sense and had no point. Imagine if in the end of code geass, lelouch failed, died or went to jail. What was the point of following him? There would be none. And it's not a bad thing to have a story like that. But here, it was simply aggravating to get through, because the entire base of the show is simply war = bad, peace = good.  The ending rendered everything we had to get through with the faggot meaningless, so, what was the point? There really was none. It's a shame when it could have been good.     It's a slainefag, what do you expect?   Fuccboi doesn't mean what you think it does.        Except not long after even Cruhteo and Saazbaum figure out FROM HIM that she is.  How does this disprove anything? Goddamn you're an idiot. Saaz knew that the princess was alive even before then and Slaine told Crutons that she was alive, killing the dude just made him easy to frame.   Good lotta help that was when he shoots first and asks questions later.   And what does this have to do with anything?    stuff   Dude, you're wrong. There's no argument here anymore just you being asspained.              The ending rendered everything we had to get through with the faggot meaningless, so, what was the point?   The point is that Slaine will rise again. War changes people but, as long as they live, they can become who they really are again.  Everything on the show was orbiting around Slaine. He was the one who gave the princess those ideas, because those are Slaine's real ideals. The conflict was Slaine vs Slaine using a bunch of empty characters while Slaine is on route to becoming himself again by 24.5.         Slaine is a villain and a bad person   m-muh Aoki said he's just mindbroken and a good boy   Aoki said Slaine and Inaho are both MCs   AOKI IS A FAGGOT M-MUH MAGAZINES   Always so much backpedaling in Slainefag logic.         You sound mad, anon.     I can't respond like an intelligent human, so have some shitposts.  What can you really expect from this fanbase.   Saaz knew that the princess was alive even before then and Slaine told Crutons that she was alive, killing the dude just made him easy to frame.  Except no one was framed, what the fuck are you even typing? Slaine went through torture to not let anyone know, and then spills it because he's a fucking idiot. Which renders his actions again pointless.        Get your ears checked. Ain't even mad, I'm amused.     and then spills it because he's a fucking idiot   He didn't spill it out. Crouton figured out she's alive and Slaine taunted him saying she'll finish him off.       Except not long after even Cruhteo and Saazbaum figure out FROM HIM that she is.    Well this was just plain stupid and it made all of the torture he endured pointless. But the point was that he did try to act and stop Trillram and talk to the king about the princess. Slaine tried, and Aoki decided that Slaine should fail.   Good lotta help that was when he shoots first and asks questions later.  So what are you even trying to say here? He decided to help them immediately to gain their trust, he didn't have time to say much before Inaho shot him down. Was he supposed to talk mid battle?   So basically he's just another character who is a walking drama tool making irrational decisions.  And you wonder why OP asked what was the damn point?  You can't even make a good point. Give up please.              Except the show simply ended with him in jail crying. The entire second season was just there for no reason.    Whatever you say.    It's the only way they can get by. Denying and being selective when the only end is pain.    Compared to what? Inaho's stuff was even more boring during Season 2. Basically monster of the week bullshit and he beat all opposition using basic physics like he always did.  Hell, it seemed like Slaine's plot was at least going somewhere.      And guess how a dunce like Crouton figured it out? Oh right.   I want these shitposters to go away.  Stop shitting on the dead corpse of a show. You are not making a point, you are not changing the opinions of Slaine's fans, you are just circlejerking.  It was a bad show, leave it dead. You are just embarrassing yourself with all these bait posts and lost arguments.       It ended with him smiling and having his pupils back. The ending with the three birds flying were meant to be symbolic of the three of them reuniting and flying together one day.  "Fragments of the Rain" addresses the matter of the real Slaine and how he'll keep flying low for now until his wings are dry. Both the princess and Inaho are waiting for his improvement.      You sound disappointed, here's a reply to make you feel better.    Because he saw that Femianne's Kat was destroyed and he assumed only someone with Aldnoah could do this.  Did you watch the episode?          waaaah waaah the OST and animation were shit and you are a retard if you think they were good   waaaah waaah Slaine is so loved and I don't like that   Anons, it's a bit embarrassing to watch you.           So what are you even trying to say here? He decided to help them immediately to gain their trust, he didn't have time to say much before Inaho shot him down. Was he supposed to talk mid battle?  That instead of not being an overemotional faggot, he got riled up and tried to shoot who he he just saved for more pointless drama and misunderstandings.    You can't even make a good point. Give up please.  And you can't even respond through your slainefag tears. Stop responding if you got nothing to say and wasting time.       Are Slainefags in jail like Slaine but with a computer to shitpost from? Their replies are always the same and it's a weekday.    desperate enough to quote every post to get a reply  Here you go for your effort.     I highly doubt anyone cares about slaine's sad fans. They have enough to deal with considering how he ended up. It's like kicking a wounded kitten.    I want Tumblr retards like you to go away. You don't belong to this board, stop trying to fit in.     seriously quoting, resounding with ironic shitpositng   Slainefags are always so insecure.     It's literally the same five faggots each thread. They have a sickness and butthurt that will never go.    Not all of them. That one has been shitposting the past threads trying to be ironic but it always comes off as pathetically insecure. It's making other Slainefags look bad, it's embarrassing.    You are so precious. Inaho shoots Slaine in that episode, please rewatch it before making statements.    trying to fit in by calling out tumblr  This is delicious anon, try more.       Reminder to Slainebros, stop replying to obvious crossboarders from animesuki.   I'm waiting patiently for the new gakuen aldnoah cd drama rip, to have more headmaster saazbaum.     Compared to Slaine killing one dude and automatically getting everything to fall in line? Compared to that lazy, piss poor rise to power? And then having banal conversations with the wheelchair girl and the shitty angst soap opera?  I can understand hating the earth characters. But the entire thing was fucking shit.      Aoki wanted Slaine to be something like Godfather or Carlito's Way, Start up pure but ends up being dragged into criminal activities. something like a tragic hero. A character that tries to get something in hand but fails and end up being attached to misfortune. He wanted to show us that Slaine was immature and delusional about his ways and has to pay for it. and yes he is the other MC.     didn't they mention that peace between earth and mars was possible because of Slaine death? they needed a common enemy, and Saazbaum wont do the job because he is mars noble and that would make it all mars fault.       I'd appreciate it more if the slaineshitters reeking of tumblr went back home.     posts a Tumblr gif with a fucking watermark on it   acts like a retarded crossboarder   doesn't even know how to save images from Pixiv   thinks she's fooling anyone saying she's not a crossboarder who started browsing /a/ 4 days ago and didn't even read the rules   This is on a whole new level embarrassing.         I'll appreciate more if shitposters like you would go back to animesuki or MAL.    I'd ask you the same question. The entire torture scene was rendered pointless, like everything Slaine ever does, because he helped him figure out she was alive when he laughed, when he should have kept his mouth shut. If only he died so people wouldn't have to deal with a second season of him continuing to be terrible.     You're not getting anything in threads like these except shitposting and Tumblrina circlejerking. If I had the CD or anything else I wouldn't post it now, there's no point when there's these shitposters killing the threads. Wait a week or two until they leave.       posts a gif saved from these threads   has been here for 5 years   watched the show while it was airing and in threads since then   do you even browse pixiv   tfw am male   Please do me a favor and stop trying to fit in.I proved my opinions to be right ever since the show aired, you are free to have your own opinion. The threads were nice a few weeks ago when it was about the extra materials, but in the past week a few persistent retards showed up, at least show the decency and sage your posts.             Inaho shoots Slaine in that episode  After Slaine shot first because he's an antsy retard.  slainetumblrinas in charge of watching the show        Everyone who doesn't like my fujobait is from MAL or animesuki!  Maybe some people just have enough taste to not like characters from shit shows, you goddamn hambeast.       Just because opinions are triggering you doesn't make them shitposts. Either argue back or leave them be. Or head back to a tumblr hugbox.     It's making other Slainefags look bad  I can assure you the fanbase has gotten a terrible rep since episode 12 and beyond for the faggotry This  doesn't make it any better, true          implying we can't see if you saved it from the threads or not   not knowing the rules, posting the inferior version  and pretending to be here for 5 years   not knowing how to use Pixiv   not saging your posts and trying to blame it on someone else   pretending you're male when your attention whoring proves otherwise   being so eager to embarrass yourself like this in public   Are you a masochist? Seeing how you've been persistently shitting every thread you must be one.           I haven't been in the threads since the finale and I am stunned they are up to the exact same antics like broken records. But more tumblr-like than before. If only they could get arrested.     If they're invading our threads maybe we should invade their tumblrs. It's not like they need them if they're using our threads to post their retarded shit.     What is this about? The Aldnoah AU High school? It was bought by the people who attended to Extra day.    asking something seriously in a shitposting Tumblr thread   Really?      Why the fuck did you bump this thread from page 9 when you could have made a new one? Fuck off.    That sounds like a good idea.     implying all people who disagree with you are the same person   implying I'm not saging every single post   saying I'm female while my dick states the opposite   You can think of me however you like, I give up on talking to you. I replied to shitposting with shitposting, you are no better.          Stop talking like an underage faggot and trying to fit in, go and spam their hambeast blogs with shit if you want to, you don't need approval.     samefag pls go      backpedaling on your posts after you realized you fucked up   not even able to defend yourself   still replying because you think that's going to make you look better when all it does it make you look more insecure   not knowing when to shut up after you lose an argument   Really embarrassing but you've got no one but yourself to blame. Maybe you'll learn to lurk the fuck more before you post next time.  And stop bumping this thread. Everyone knows it's you posting those fanarts.           Seriously kill yourself slaineshitter.                    fanart fagging   Holy shit get yourself a room, you faggots are pathetic. I wish I could report these threads.       You can. Report the OP.      It's not really rule violation. just a shitty thread.          I repeat  not knowing how to use Pixiv          A shitty thread is rule violation.    OP asked a legit question tumblrina.   Pokemon has great girls, do you agree?  I love all the girls.  Except Misty, who was kind of a bitch.  Iris was a bitch too, but damn if I don't love her design.      Yes, so which should I jerk it to today?   Skyla    Don't think I've ever done it to her actually, so okay.    There should be a roulette for this, it's hard as fuck to decide who to do it to sometimes.    They are all extremely fappable.    gen 5 hast best girls. The best being the bun girl with the leggings.      TFW most pokemon doujins are furryshit   Why     I just wish the artists didn't give the girls watermelons instead of breasts. THat-s fucking disgusting.     TFW only played XY because my custom Serana     you played as the superior and cutest color serena, right?   CORNI TIME!!  if corni was a bit tanner with everything else she do be perfection.   just imagine her spat's tan line.       she sees your dick       Wanting a furfag or better, a lucariofag       her spats and midriff make my dick hard though   she also has the fluffiest canon vag     she flashes you with her spats                     dem comfy pajamas  Are we autosaging?       Whoops, guess not.           where my /vp/oreons at   Probably at /vp/   <br/>  Most of the best girls are gym leaders.  even the background characters are cute!  I want to be a Pokegirl     he has read 'that' doujin       *hasn't.    Hilda has the best ass, so her.    Or Dawn.     tfw no Rosa anime    Why do pokègirls always dress like sluts?   They are extremely fappable.    Twinbuns girl looks god tier      May is the probably on of the best looking trainers     Probably the best thi g to come ouf of BW           10 (TEN) YEARS OLD          Sometimes when I look at pokemon girls, I feel the need to replay/play all the pokemon games again  But I won't do that      I always do.       back to your containment board, autistic manchild.      Good taste   No one here likes Sabrina?        not posting best boy    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113964  Yes     POST HILDA         You will never lose a battle and have to pay with your body        that pic where the lass does     Best girl will never be animated    didn't even appear in the anime   replaced with a shitty nigger loli  No wonder BW is easily the worst series        Only best boy deserves the best girl. Not Ash.   Reminder that Serena was voted the best on /a/.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr>      I think they made the right choice. I wouldn't want her to be sullied by Ash and his losing streak     The only exception is Hilda, she's 14-ish   Cynthia a best  Needs more doujins.   Right on.     As hard as diamond   Especially the participant of kalos queen competition or whatever the name is.    Game Serena is something like 16, while ORAS May is canonically 12. The whole 10-year-old protagonist thing only ever applied to the anime; the game versions have always been older.   Best girl, why doesn't anyone remember her?     he hasn't read Chibikko Bitch XY 1 and 2       YOU probably wouldn't walk for weeks - she's definitely a ravager.     read them both. Thats why is said MORE. Get your memes out of here.     Go on.    I really really like this picture     Just the way I like it.    Quick reminder that the Pokemon anime is still shit because it still focuses on Ash and Pikachu losing every league.   Seriously, how hard could it have been to make Ash the aged mentor to the XY protagonist? Maybe make him an Elite 4 member who travels around a lot?     Not after the shit pile that was Best Wishes. Maybe next gen. Hopefully next gen. At least let this Ash retire in peace. If it absolutely positively needs to be an Ash in the starring role, then just switch to a different one courtesy of Hoopa.     This. You also can easily spot an anime-onlyfag or a Genwunner when they mention the whole 10-years-old shtick. I'd say the very least, they're 12. Leaf comes off as that age anyway.      Most people have never read the manga either and don't realize that everybody actually ages as the story progresses. Ash is the only oddball in the whole franchise, he more of an anomaly. I wonder if Ash even exists at all      It was mostly in jest, but I agree there are those who still think so.  And just look at those proportions.       sabrina a qt3.142. Can Sabrina read minds with her psychic abilities?    anon have you not seen b2w2's promotional trailer?    Same with May, I know there are ten year olds with developed bodies(I saw many of them in my school at fifth grade), but in all honestly twelve is the borderline to being considered a young adult or a full fledged adult in certain societies.   <br/>   I love that image. It show how slutty Rosa and how pure Hilda.       pure   those shorts   Nah they're both sluts.        Ash got blasted with so much shit that he's a minor deity at this point. He will never age. He will never die. He will roam the Pokemon world for all eternity. His body will always be exactly 10 years, 10 months, and 10 days old.     And he will always have the brain of a 10 year old - he will never learn, he will always job.     since Black and White, the protagonists have all been AT LEAST 14 which is legal in Japan.   though I do guess perhaps ORAS might still be different since remake and all that.       I bet they would have been great in any anime      Nah I know, I've played every game to date, and watched the anime.    I wish they would have gotten May's original design and her pure waifu personality on or/as.  it also has great pokemon  Pokemon was a mistake   Nah, even a 10-year-old can learn. In fact, they're irritatingly good at that. Ash did a pretty good job of dealing with Fairy-types with a Fighting-type in his latest gym battle, so clearly he's figured something out about not jobbing. Who knows, maybe he'll find a way to grow up some day.  Maybe it'll work too well and he'll become a giant. Maybe he'll end up building a turbolaser to resurrect Pikachu and spend the next 3000 years atoning for it.     Speaking of the anime, has anybody gone back and started rewatching the series from the beginning all the way through?     Ash becomes AZ   Sasuga.       someone needs to slow this down     Or a webm so I can pause it.     Nah, the first season is bad. Ash is a total faggot. But I'd rewatch Orange league.     dat puffy vag    The purest  Why is she so under-appreciated?    Because Sky Battles are shit, she didn't deserve this.       You're not wrong, but at the same time, I would think there'd be more fans regardless of game mechanics. Even the freediver was pretty simple to battle, and she's just as under-appreciated.   Serena is waifu tier   Cute or sex?       you will never be forced to call him master and obey his every command     Underrated post    sex    My nigga.    Minbreak.    You disgust me.    My dick!    You shouldn't do mean things to White.   Post best pokemon  vanilla  doujins.   I want to violate her.     Shut it, kid.     Only recently did I take note of how stupidly nubile Rosa's body is. I never understood why people liked her until I saw the good shit. My fucking God, when I die bury me in that ass.  May=Rosa&gt;Hilda&gt;Green&gt;Dawn&gt;Silver (or whatever that bitch from Gen II is named)      I wanna show her my dick.   Should I pick up the pokemon adventures manga?  guess i'll start with the best villian   yes. much better than the anime counterpart    http://exhentai.org/g/339759/ab4dac<wbr>1618/ http://exhentai.org/g/533163/7b2844<wbr>b039/</wbr> </wbr>   Sugimori mastered the fine art of drawing cute girls. Gamefreak should make a game focused around that and cash on it. Only creatures, no pokemon.  I want her milk   Breeding material     hating based Kris     Yes. It's different from the game and the series. http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>02067 Some guy uploaded the first 13 volumes in good quality.</wbr>       Yes.   What a qt.   Kindergarten teacher    Holy shit   what pokemon would you fuck   also a slut        No pokemon, but gijinka yes.     That's not stupid sexy Domino        <br/>    My favourite movie, and favourite bad girl.        I want her to step on me    <br/>   Damn I wish TR weren't such a joke in the anime. Poor Giovanni.     They were good in the beginning       that Serena       For all of like 3 episodes.     You have the right idea.    First 2d waifu.   Nobody ever mentions the female Ranger.  Oh well more of her for me.      implying you can have more than one waifu   implying a waifu can be anything other than 2D      this TR was never good.  now shut up and post Jessie in outfits that aren't her usual shit one.      Rangers are sluts.    Or Crystal, even. I remember many nights of fapping to her bike spats years ago, to that cover on that volume of Pokespe.    Imagine those biker thighs leglocking you.    I'm still mad she's not in the remakes.     putting your dick in crazy  reminder everyone confirmed to have touched that vag is dead.     I remember that. When she dropped her skirt during her introduction, it raised my oak.    It was the nineties, man. I didn't know the rules. My devotion was an ignorant one. I treated her wrong and I lost her.     implying Ruby won't pound the curse away     That's anime logic. Notice in the games that there are clearly trainers younger than 10. There's no rule that you have to be 10 in the games, which makes protagonist ages a bit more vague. Only ones I remember hearing confirmed are that Red is 11 in Gen I, and the Gen V protagonists appear older than other protagonists.    This edgeventures we're talking about, he'll probably explode into a flurry of blood and gore the moment he touches the lips.    The anime just says you need to be 10 to be an official, licensed trainer. There's been plenty of younger kids in the anime using Pokemon owned by others in battle.    All the females drawn by this artist have great hips and thighs, that's why pokegirls are so fappable.     not keeping zinnia as your side waifu for when you need breaks from mays pure loving     tfw you will never a pokegirl    May and Brendan are confirmed 12 in ORAS XY's protags are said to be "the same age" as 16 year old Emma (which doesn't necessarily mean they're 16, but somewhere around there)     got a bigger version of that pic? it'd make a good desktop background.     Shit, I really want to get all the games from gen3 onward and carry my team through all the games, for the experience of it.  But I know I only say I want that and if I do it, I'll end up suffering.  I hope there are more top tier girls in the next game.      The best.    you will never stick your head up there    Roxie is the cutest pokegirl!     When ash dressed like the last one?        She will never call you a worthless pig while you lick her feet      AG    Nah that's the biggest I could find.    breh? I thought I was the only one    She was pretty nice towards everyone other than Iris.    Best pair.     My brains hate her. My heart doesn't give a shit. My dick would lift mountains for her.          Conflict of the peneart     She's an unlikable bitch but damn was her body made for steamy passionate sex.     https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/1565050</wbr>      There's no way I'm the only one.  Mile-high club when?   Not even best yuri pair.    now voiced by Kei Shindo   How does this make you feel?    Why did Iris have to be so shit in the anime?   Nah. Rosa x Roxie just makes sense.       I think the same thing     Is this canon? huahua   Nerdy looking school girls are great.   I don't see how, but okay.    Me too.     no    her midriff does things to me      on related note, is it true that terufuu is dead?   They start having sex on the next page, anon.    he hasn't drawn shit in a long time. last thing he did was korrinaxashxserena    Well it makes much more sense than pairing two people who have never met.    she will never be your teacher    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm   0 votes   </wbr></wbr></wbr>      She looks like a spoiled ojou.    i don't know     pokeshipping   sense      That's not nerdy, that's slutty.    I want to spoil her with my dick    but candice is pure, anon.    Because otherwise, any new pokegirl would have been way too much of a downgrade. Like going from /a/ to /v/.    Fair enough.    Would this not be the perfect wife? A cultured, classy, fashionable, stern yet warm woman?    I liked the one from Pokemon Platinum the most.  Something about her just triggers me really hard.     Why was Misty so much better in the manga?   Do tell, anon.   MY DICK IS DIAMOND  Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   wkwk  Will Gainax deliver?  I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  Please let them remain together in their universe even after the alien and their powers have gone, Gainax!   Like I said, I'm lactose intolerant.     3 hours left     You mean 6. 7,5 until HS.   Hopefully we will get another kissu.   one episode left     KinMoza and SB69 are over   Pleiades to end soon   Etotama and DanMachi will follow too  It it not an end. Just a transformation.        DanMachi will follow  It's not all bad news then.     Danmachi was good.    Good for what it is perhaps, but that's not saying much.    It really wasn't.    Danmachi is just a LN advertisement. The booty in it was good though.    Hestia could only keep me going for four episodes before I dropped it.    Good.  So i can marathon the shit out of this in the mid-seasons week of nothingness.       not being white    Both excited to see how it ends, and sad that it's ending. Somehow this series felt like Gainax really put a lot of heart into making it.   I can't be the only one doing a marathon rewatch before the finale, right?     1 hour 25 minutes remain    I want Gyate Gyate of the Houkagos.     There's no time. I'm re-watching Aquarion and Symphogear.    Until what? It's 80 minutes left according to anichart, but in previous threads, images start appearing 4 hours from now, and HS is out one hour after that.    So is anichart wrong?    Yeah.    Zettai! I've actually done it throughout the past Week because of Work Schedule.   Nanoko's song is so beautiful. So glad I downloaded the singles for the OP and ED.  Where's the stream? Yucie and Neet are dead for me.    Preview https://<span>youtu.be/QEGqRYax6Lk  [ ]   inb4 ends with Subaru opening a door    a fucking black hole   Minato and Subaru together   I'm getting hype.      So 1 hour or 3 hours till it airs? Can I marathon it in time?    3 hours, but you won't have enough time to marathon in   Dat parallel universes. Dat fountain.   I think anin has enough time as long as he is not planning to watch the livestream and wait for subs instead     The spaceship appeared  So the earth is fucked? Inb4 time travel.     3:30 until it airs, 5 hours until subs. You can make it. Just don't get distracted and don't check the thread.       Okay thanks anons.   Enjoy your finale          You are in a car advert thread.   The OST is out today.  It's a shame the characters look washed out.   Hestia is the worst part of Danmachi and not what makes it good.   Reminder: by buying banana milk you are a filthy Bananaraffe xeno scum and you should be purged.   The animation looked way better in the pilot too. Wish they would have kept some of that fluidity in the show     flavored milk  Straweberyy is meme flavor tbh.      meme flavor  What does it even mean?    Futaba thread?   Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.    Yes    /sp/ pls.   volume 2 cover   The weakest part of this show is definitely the animation and art, which is a pity because it means the limited staff cannot fully portray the vast magnitude and grandiosity of the distances and celestial objects that the characters experience.  For example, while pic related was a great moment in the anime due to timing, dialogue and voice acting, it was just a few simple pans of a plain empty landscape and a starry sky, nothing even close to the level of fascinating alien geography that the concept art shows.  Due to the awful budgeting, this is actually one anime where I'm thankful that the staff chose to use extensive CGI for action cuts. Seeing the (3D) characters fly in dynamic ways with interesting choreography is a great distraction from the stasis and lack of movement in the 2D sequences. Had they chosen to animate solely in 2D for the flight sequences, the tragic lack of budget would have been a lot more egregious.        When was pic related used again?    Leaked art. It was the episode with the supernova.   Subaru is subarashii.  Just a reminder we have 7 contestants. Someone  probably Aoi  will be alone, or third wheel.  Okay /u/, riddle me this. We know why prez looks like a blue titty, but how come girls other than Nanako see him as that?     /u/      /u/     Why don't you fuck off and stay there?      Come on lads, it was a joke to instigate giggles.  So, any ideas why? It would make sense if Subaru made the drawing, or if Nanako is actually the protagonist.        Before Nanako gave him his form he was formless. So after she gave him his form everyone sees him like that? It never said that they all perceived his appearance differently.    Yeah, but how come they all see him the same way. It was kinda implied that everyone sees him their own way.     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form which everyone sees him as.  It would be weird if everyone saw him differently then how would it work when they squeeze him and stuff?      Is there more?     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form  He was a shota before he met with Minato, who gave him that form? The alien asked Nanako to give him a form so it is not automatic.       It'll probably be explained this episode who made him into a magical boy -- what I'm saying is get ready for TIME TRAVEL SHENANIGANS    I meant the link where you are getting them from nigga   My theory is that the aliens are actually just future human children in a flux state of possibilities.  I love you guys. I love this show. I dont want it to end.   tfw I will not be able to watch season finale with /a/ because I have to go out with IRL friends  Life is suffering.   GET IN HERE ONLY 5 +60  MINUTES LEFT    Fuck them.   Can't watch until later cause of morning shift, but I'm so hype.  the cutest   Absolutely.    Nah, she is for sex.     Not watching it with your IRL friends  Get some friends with taste.     Absolutely.    She is for sex and then taking responsibility.     My weebest friend moved to another country for works. My other friends are nerds with whom I share other nerd fields of interest, but not this one. It's not that easy. I can't watch anime 'cause I have to go to a fantasy fair     Spoilered and saged for blogspot.     Pretty sure the soopa speshul MC with the soopa speshul unique ability that makes him soopa powaful is the worst part of that garbage. Also he has a soopa speshul hair color just because it will make girls like him.  Actually the setting might be the worst thing.      You need to be over 18 to post on this site     having friends   not being faithful to /a/   You slut.

Who the hell is that?    That was beautiful  Even that random garden guy from last episode was relevant again     How can Minato be cuter than Subaru and every other girl in the show?    Aoi's girlfriend from Subaru's world Watch first episode     What a ride it was      What's with the character development?    Aoi finally gets her yuri ending     Probably the different versions from Subaru's world. Tomboy Itsuki looks lovely.         Itsuki getting tomboy hair  I'm actually fine with that.   Nanako in ponytail  IS IT NEXT HOUR YET?        adsoluting discusting brrrrr....    Just so you guys know, Pleiades won yesterday in "favorite anime this season" thread.   And there go the sales, looks that sponsored shows don't need to hide behind subtext having proper funding and not care about BD sales.  But then again making the guy more girly looking that any other girl in the show gives me mixed signals, especially if the girl acts like a guy should here...  Maybe more shows sponsored would mean more development in romance.       That was a good run Well, see you in the few years when next gainax original show will be aired Hope we all be alive until then     Fuck off tripfag    mostly subtext are romantic than avarage romance but just because they are both girls people here fixed just a bait   It was pretty damn good.

And you felt that comment was relevant because...   What does this mean?  It means 存在の耐えられない軽さ   A pleasure of being cummed inside.    dVlU   That Haru is the only one who isn't a leg spreading slut.   It means you need to kill yourself.   It means  stop making Free threads, faggot.    Nagisa a slut, Rei and Makoto fags who can't into sex, Haru a prude, Rin a pure that doesn't wanna get involved in lewd activites.      Rin a pure     His body is slutty but his personnality is that of a virginal angel.    That doesn't make sense.   I didn't watch the series, so can you tell me if we should expect the Free! movie to be another kyoanus masterpiece like disappearance and tamako love story? Or is the source material shit?   Think harder, and you'll realize it adds up actually.      his personnality is that of a virginal angel.     Hey, now. Rei spreads majestically.     Or is the source material shit?  Here's your answer.     Is that supposed to be him in high school? He looks a lot younger    It'll probably be shit.   What does this mean?   The source material is alright, will be made better by KyoAni is they continue their tradition of making better movies than series.

A problem with that, faggot?   What's your favorite Free! doujin?    women who are drawn to husbands like their fathers   acknowledged her future husband by doing the same thing she did with her daddy.      Every RinHaru doujin.    It doesn't look pleasing visually and Sousuke deserves better than an autist. He deserves to win his waifubowl.    Will Sousuke make a proper woman out of Haru?    Freud would be touched.    You just have a shit taste, that's okay.    3deep5me    How deep does the fist goes?    You just have all the shit taste and that's not okay.

No wonder you like, you can't follow common sense either          ideologically  Shirou has no ideology.     But you DID judge it you hypocritical shit.

OP shitposting with best Nice koi  Fuck off. But yes Shirou's logic is absolutely retarded, and while I liked him when I first played the VN I hate him now.      Shirou has an ideology, a rather shitty one He wants to save everyone, in doing that he doesn't lose anyone, but he's gonna lose them anyway, because you know?

There is absolutely nothing about it that doesn't make perfect sense.   I don't think I was ready for this.  Inb4 Tomoya Taking to his dad was saddest part.     Not the sunflowers field scene  Anon...      What's sad is that all these beautiful moments that mad Clannad good are retconned by the own story's magical glowing reincarnation dango. Should have ended with Ushio healthy, maybe hint at Tomoya and Kyou going out.       both seasons frequently foreshadows this   characters even talk about it   People flip tables when it happens like it came out of the blue   Also, if you got made over the dragon balls "reviving" Nagisa and Ushio then you need to  read the VN          I guess that would have been a nice ending too, but I was so damn sad when Nagisa died, not because she was a especially likeable characer or anything, but because of how devastated Tomoya was when she died, that all I wanted was to see her alive and with Tomoya and Ushio.    The balls of light were a big part of the VN, apparently. The anime just casually talked about it.     It would've probably made for a better story, not explaining about the girl and the robot in the anime didn't help either.    It doesn't matter, it's still fucking shit. In the VN, you have to work for the ending with multiple playthroughs so you have to see the sad ending before you're rewarded with the good ending, the anime adaptation just comes off as an asspull. It doesn't matter how much it's foreshadowed when you kill off the little girl and then immediately bring her and her mom back to life. Nobody watching the adaptation is going to understand there's like 4 different timelines explaining that shit from just watching the anime.  Cry porn is stupid anyway, so who even gives a fuck.     Whole show would've been better if they cut out all the robotxushio shit and cut the retcon ending. End it there or do this   Good show though I cried a bunch.       It doesn't matter how much it's foreshadowed when you kill off the little girl and then immediately bring her and her mom back to life.   Nobody watching the adaptation is going to understand there's like 4 different timelines explaining that shit from just watching the anime.   do you even understand what you're trying to say or are you just typing hamfisted shit to make your argument sound more convincing.  This is perhaps the greatest bait I've ever seen in a long time and I doubt you're even aware of it.         I thought the point of the ending was the fact clannadman took back what he said about regretting Nagisa cause of the shitty hand he's been dealt the past couple years.  So even though he's crying in the snow over his dead daughter cause of a shitty decision to let her walk in the freezing snow (really), he's now wishing that if he could go back in time to relive his life with a different outcome, he'd still choose Nagisa, something he wouldn't have thought of before.  And then he is granted a second chance at life with the woman he loves.  At the end, it's not necessarily the goal that really mattered, but the journey it took for clannadman to realize he never regrets Nagisa and he truly loves her.         All they had to do was not kill Ushio. The whole "not regretting Nagisa" thing was easily manifested in his love for their child.     I like to believe the people who got mad over the ending is a vocal minority of maybe 3 people     All this except Tomoya and Kyou dating. Fucking shipperfag, Tomoya will stay loyal to his waifu.      That would've been the case if not for the fact there was a scene that explicitly shows Tomoya finally taking back what he said about regretting Nagisa after Ushio collapsed in the snow and MC fell into an emotional breakdown.  Though, letting your sickly ass daughter walk in the snow is still fucking stupid. I have no idea what possessed MC to make that decision.       I absolutely loved the ending, but my opinion may be biased because I marathoned the secuel in a single night. But I honestly can see an ending like this  working out perfectly. However, all the Illusionary World stuff played an important role throughout the series, so it would be hard to just ignore it at the end.    Only stupid people enjoy a perfect happy ending like that. All the fucking emotional journey that leads Tomoya to be the man he is at the end of the show was for nothing. Shit writing.     It was more of an adaptation failure than a writing failure.     Personally I think they handled it pretty well, considering the fact they had to condense a VN of that magnitude down to something that's completely linear.  I don't think any other studio in that time would've done any better a job, so I'll take it for what it's worth.  VN over the anime though, for sure.         Yeah I know, but I just think they could've moved that "no longer regret" scene to, maybe the sunflowers? Or some point afterwards, just a positive scene with Ushio that doesn't involve the MC fucking killing his kid in the snow.    People move on, they showed some chemistry when he took Ushio to school.   This is probably true, the anime leaves the impression that all the development for himself and his father is wiped away. I'm not sure what they could have done to rectify that.        People move on  Stop forcing your logic onto others.      Not seeing the blatant death flags   Deus ex machina undos it robbing the scene of any impact it could've had   b-b-but muh feels  You have the taste of a tumblr faggot.       The execution of what was foreshadowed was fucking terrible, what's so hard to understand? It's like K-On foreshadowing the universe is going to be destroyed by a giant turtle with the Ton-Ton shit and when it happens it's still stupid as fuck. Sure there's some shitty foreshadowing you can point to to justify the shitty ending, but that doesn't stop the whole thing from being shit.    It would be absolutely selfish of him to deny himself a chance at happiness with her. It would also be selfish to deprave Ushio of a mother figure growing up. Tomoya being able to move on and not regret Nagisa doesn't conflict with becoming romantically involved again, and Nagisa wouldn't want him to never love someone romantically again just because she's not alive anymore.    It was more than 5 years after her death, he and Kyou were shown to have chemistry in the past as well as when they meet in the future. Not that hard to believe.     Utterly disgusting. I don't think I'd ever be able to do something like that after going through what Tomoya went through. The lightness with which you're able to say that is shocking.      Try living a life and paying attention to the show, waifufag.    Says the shipperfag.   Play the shit prequel  What are your thoughts on heart pupils, /a/?  I don't know what's worse: that the gooks made a cartoon with 8 near-identical episodes, or that I actually watched them.   It was a social commentary on the rudimentary and passive lifestyles of young Japanese adults.    Did it need that many episodes to make the point?    Yes, otherwise it's impact would have been dampened.    GOOKS ARE KOREAN  IF YOU'RE GOING TO INSULT THEN DO IT RIGHT  DON'T TRY SO HARD TO FIT IN        What are Japs?

No.      They deserve it. They've had all the time in the world to make clear they want to be more than friends, but they never make a move. They don't "own" the MC just because they saw him first, they're seriously shit tier girls.    realistic  Really? All the people I've known are married usually start off with them being early romances, sometimes as early as grade school.  blog   And it always hurts when the childhood friend loses         Childhood friend has had years to confess   Has spent that time friend zoning herself instead   Childhood friends have only themselves to blame for losing.      Except that usually in reality, it always the MALE who has a crush on the FEMALE. Whereas in Nippon pop culture it always the other way around.    Childhood friend is rarely best girl. But it hurts so much when she is and she loses.     love a guy since how long   do fucking nothing because you think you have all the time in the world   lose to the first assertive slut that shows up   wonder why you lost  Yeah. No.       is pic related ? looks comfy to be a drama      Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her  Tsunderes always win anon.        what anime, friend?    Interesting, in my case I pretty much don't know any couples like that, neither do my parents I believe. It's pretty rare for a romance to begin that early and survive all the ups and downs of puberty and beyond that follow.    Except that usually in reality, it always the MALE who has a crush on the FEMALE.  Says who?  And it's not always the other way around in manga either. In harems of course it's that way because the male is the protagonist.          childhood friends  Either act or go home. You wait, you lose.    I still hope.    All the people I've known are married usually start off with them being early romances, sometimes as early as grade school  Do you know like, one married couple?      Childhood friend that has loved MC since forever   Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her   Childhood friend disappears for 70% of the entire story   "Bitch" gets developed and is lovable   Childhood friend comes back at the end of the manga and wins  Yeah no, fuck you.         sauce pls ?    What manga is this? Google and iqdb are being shit.     Tsunderes always win    These childhood friends wouldn't have this problem if they made a move earlier    Dagashi Kashi    No childhood friend can compare to the perfection that is Himari.  Suigintits was pretty fucking close though.    have 10+ years alone with the MC where you have literally no other female competition   a couple new girls come along and one of them manages to win him in a few months   Oh the poor childhood friend. If only she had had more time to do something about it.       Girls getting NTRd needs to happen more often.    implying Himari isn't a childhood friend by definition as well     If you've known the MC for years and nothing happened, you've pretty much lost before the competition even shows up.    Man, you guys really don't know what love is. It's not about someone that's been there for you, that's just simple fucking friendship. It's about someone you want to wake up to and live the rest of your life with. Childhood friend or not it doesn't matter, it could be anyone.     Actually, 4 of the bitches from his harem are childhood friends. How do you even manage to meet that many girls, spend years of your childhood in their presence while none of them met before the MC turned 16 while each of them is unrelated to each other?   Usually when there's a high childhood friend count there's several siblings involved, in this case there was none.       If the author could write well he wouldn't be doing shitty otaku pandering harems.   Man, the girls in Dagashi Kashi are just great.   What?        Himari was more like his childhood cat.  Same thing, I guess.   You will never have your best furry friend come back as a hot chick         This is why it's terrible. I don't mind if childhood friend loses to someone properly nice. But to a tsundere? Fuck that shit.    Silver isn't tsundere you dumb idiot.   Childhood friends DESERVE to lose. There's nothing that makes me happier than a lazy, entitled chilhood friend losing hard and bawling her eyes out. Get fucked, bitch. Should have taken the initiative ages ago.   The childhood friend losing effect is so strong, even someone as active as Manami lost in oreimo.  Manami created a gap between Kyousuke and Kirino, kept Kyousuke's self-confidence in check so he doesn't attract attention(and love rivals), made him love normalcy, which is what she excels in.    The girl who changes the MC's life tends to win since that's the direction of the story that writers usually want to write about. Childhood friends who stick around with the MC for a majority of their lives usually signify routine while the new girl brings change.  Also, they should have confessed when no one else was in the running if they really wanted to get together with the guy. The only pitiable ones are those that confessed, got friendzoned and have to watch the guy fall for a new girl while supporting him.     More like the author ran out of ideas, needed a villain and made Manami a bitch to glorify another bitch.    The retcon bullshit again, fuck off.    all these people hating on childhood friends for taking too long   Oh yeah like none of you have ever missed an opportunity because you thought life wouldn't change. Lord knows /a/ and 4chan in general are just the epitome of ambition and productiveness.     That's because they have to lose. They need to learn from experience.    Because female tends to mature faster than male. So when the time come, the female childhood friend already looks like a woman to him while the female still sees him as a  faggot .  It really is not a rare case. Ever wonder why there are so much female childhood love interest who doesn't win? The author's little self-vengeance kicked in.        Wouldn't 4chan knowing regret from that make them more qualified to judge? They knew they made a mistake, they regretted it and dealt with the consequence by living with the failure so they're more likely to not throw a pity party and pretend the girl should have won. It's not unconditional pity and it's not spitefulness.   Reminder that Silver was the objectively best girl  Likes JoJo   Has a banana phone   elder god tier hair color   wins   isn't orange         They hate childhood friends precisely BECAUSE of that.    This doesn't apply right? Hand girl wasn't tsundere.    Hotaru is superior    No, I was implying that the tsundere actually lost.     You can't hate someone for making the same mistakes you did just because you happened to make them earlier.     Says who?    Says me faggot.    Seems like we have a tough guy here!    I don't blame other people for being more productive than I was, though. If I had the advantage of an early start at something and still did worse than someone else, that's all on me.    You bet your ass bitch boy. Now you better stop having different opinions about japanese cartoon characters than me or we're gonna have some trouble.    I can if I hate past me, which I do.    Female Childhood friend finds a new boyfriend and MC sees it because MC is a betafag   Everyone shouts whore, NTR, and calls her slut.   The exact thing happens again but the to the opposite   Everyone blames the female childhood friend.       You know when she started losing? When she stopped wearing ZR.    Otaku fantasies don't include gender equality.    I don't think people would complain if the guy got with a girl and the childhood friend got over it. That's fair game. And usually, people consider the MC the stupid one in that case.    They're all faggots because they didn't aim for a harem end.   MASTER SAYA   MC gets thrown into a coma before he or his childhood friend could confess   Waits for him several years to wake up   MC wakes up   Finds out girls started pity dating some other guy until you wake up   She eventually falls in love with the guy   MC's heart gets shattered after waking up from the coma  You all know which one I'm talking about.          I don't think people would complain   You're funny anon.  You know there's a reason girls in VNs absolutely NEVER get on with another male when the MC doesn't choose their route.(Unless it's a masochistic/NTR VN) There have been plenty of cases of otaku boycotting and burning down entire series because of a female heroine having a relationship with someone else.          people call sluts sluts  WOW O W       I honestly don't,    insecure otaku please go    Normalfag pls go, being on any dick but my dick means filthy whore.     You know there's a reason girls in VNs absolutely NEVER get on with another male when the MC doesn't choose their route  I can understand them throwing a shitfit if you are forced to see them being all lovey dovey and her getting fucked while you accidentaly run into them or something but just her ending up with some other guy?     It's not girls fault your dick is too small for them to even find.    Yes.  Why would you think any different of otaku. You should know they're among the most petty, insecure, pathetic people in the world. They're like /r9k/ and /jp/ combined, in much greater numbers.      This is why I have a hard time playing VNs, because I played one, went through every route and realized that if I pick any one of the girls, all others life are a shitfest because I won't be there for them.  I know they're imaginary, but still. It ain't fair.        my face when playing White Album 2 CODA  I wish Setsuna would just fall in love with another guy so she could finally be happy and leave it all behind.     You should incredibly butthurt.     You should incredibly butthurt.     I couldn't play more of Grisaia becasue I tried trice and ended up un Michiru route all the times. I understand your feelings.    I meant 'sound'. The effects of 24 hours of no sleep.    At least it is not Yume Miru Kusuri.    Long night of desperate attempts at trolling and shitposting neetboy?   We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     Are you a girl?    Kotori doesn't mind that too much, so long as he spends time with her as well. Mana already treats Kotori as the youngest sibling of the 3(though the reason for that is kinda funny).     woah, you guys sure are edgy and hardcore XD      Toha didn't know about the workd iirc, even Yoshino was familiar with it.     Do you think I'm from Animetsuki, saw the discussion yesterday thruthfully speaking, didn't even know there was a website like that. Alright, not gonna argue with you. I'm leaving already. </blockquote>]
