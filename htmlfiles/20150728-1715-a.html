[ Why is Enjoy so inspirational?  I FOUND RURI!  Because he's an old fuck still having fun unlike us.  why is yuya so bad at dueling?   KATTOBINGA ORE   For what purpose  <br> that quality </br>  <br> Secret <br>TREWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAART</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yuma had an even worse record.</br>  <br>Petdeckers have had the privilege of cheap cards for too long, enjoy your 20 dollar Toon Kingdom</br>  <br>Can't have old cards becoming relevant now can we.</br>  <br>I don't fucking care about Toons but soind that to Red-Eyes, I can accept Flare Metal being Secret but this is just bullshit, so fuck you.<br>And if you are reading this Trewart, I hope you be preparaed because we will find you and beat the dcrap out of you you gucking maggot pioece of shit.</br></br>  this tread is only for Selena/serena pics.  <br><br>No you don't understand. The Monarch guy was SHIT. This was his deck. I don't even know what the fuck he is trying to do with this deck. He can't summon a single monster in his deck on his own. <br><br>From </br></br></br></br>  <br>As I say before, I only finish in the frontal hole, but Serena is the only one who I would dare to finish in the back hole.<br> But if pic related happen I am not taking responsability </br></br>  <br>There is a reason petdecks are cheap, because they're petdecks. <br><br>Are you going to tell me that Minverva, a card that should be used in every Lightsworn petdeck being exclusive is good too? Exclusives and unnecessary rarity changes are stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Delete this<br><br>Wow, what am I even looking at? I guess that explains why he was tag dueling. I mean, I'm not the best at deck building myself, but I have no idea what I'm looking at honestly. My brain hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> And if you are reading this Trewart, I hope you be preparaed because we will find you and beat the dcrap out of you you gucking maggot pioece of shit. <br> Yugioh players <br> Actually doing anything and not accepting Konami dicking <br>They wouldnt do it if they couldnt get away with it everytime</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is what a butthurt write </br>  <br> Exclusives and unnecessary rarity changes are stupid <br>How are they stupid? The playerbase votes with their wallet and accepts it, causing Konami to make mad bucks. Why would they do anything else?</br></br>  <br>The OCG also doesn't deal with this shit and KoJ still gets mad amounts of money for cards, the TCG just does things to get even more money and not give two shits about the game unlike KoJ.</br>  <br><br>The fuck does he need all that draw power for<br>What does he want</br></br></br>  Haven't been in the threads for two weeks. Anything interesting happen besides the Crow thing?  <br>Ancient Leaf means he's only playing Tags and he's planning on Tributing his partner's monsters, or drawing into Storm Forth.</br>  <br>People need to stop thinking big multinationals are their friends, if people want a change they need to actually make a stand and adjust their buying patterns. Nothing will get better if Yugioh players keep acting like bleating sheep</br>  ENJOYEE<br>ENJOYEE<br>ENJOYEE<br>YOUR LIFETIME!</br></br></br>  <br>no i will never delete that pic her reaction is too cute...soon this will happen.</br>    <br>Red-eye suck nuts just like your mother, best set is this...soon we'll have more support.</br>  <br>KoJ rarity creeps all anime cards instead. They don't have the problem of people not buying the new pack unless it contains the next meta deck. Also, Japanese players had to deal with the DT stuff, like Trishula being ridiculously expensive.<br><br>Western players have nobody but themselves to blame for the powercreep, when sets like JOTL and CROS fail hard because they don't have broken cards.</br></br></br>  Best Yugioh protagonist. Prove me wrong<br>Protip:  You can't </br>  <br>Fuck you :v</br>  <br> Prophecy <br>I bet you prefer whore bitches cardfus from archetypes than things that really matter like Red-Eyes</br></br>  <br> No more Speed Spells in Riding Duels <br> all those faggots saying "If you want Speed Spells go watch 5Ds" <br> nobody likes Action Cards <br> Action Cards in Riding Duels <br><br>HAHA FAGGOTS ENJOY YOUR "MUH NO SPEED SPELLS" NOW<br><br> B-But there's no speed spells cuz you can't print them, r-right? <br><br>LOLNOPE<br><br>I WISH I COULD COLLECT EVERY MOMENT THESE THREADS WERE BTFO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So when are we all gonna duel to find out the Kingu among us?  <br>He only summoned his kawaii cardfu once<br>shit/10</br></br>  <br>What the fuck does that even say<br><br>I can't believe someone actually got paid to make this and now it will be mass produced</br></br></br>  <br>You don't put Action Cards in your Main deck, moron. And they are an existing mechanic.<br><br>There was 0 chance of them introducing a new mechanic just to stroke your nostalgic dick.</br></br></br>  <br> Books <br><br>I bet you actually stay silent in a library, faggot</br></br></br>  <br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br><br><br> There was 0 chance of them introducing a new mechanic just to stroke your nostalgic dick. <br>But they brought back Riding Duels to stroke nostalgia dick, it would have been a good idea to add something to them to make them not boring</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did someone said Books?</br>  <br>Well fuck, I've ordered two boxes of Clash of Rebellion and now it turns out the Red-Eyes XYZ will fight for the spot in the boxes with the fucking Egg. How it costs to order a playset of this things in Japanese? I'm more of a local/casual player anyway.</br>  <br>you mad that Red-eyes took this long to gitgud? but it doesn't change that fack that you're still a faggot.<br><br>yes i do because people are reading, something you cant do on your own.</br></br></br>  <br>And it doesn't change the fact that you are just a waifufag and metawhore faggot at the same time.<br> GET WRECKED </br></br>  <br> /jp/ </br>  <br>Riding duels are not a mechanic. They are normal duels, except they ride bikes. There's nothing to explain.</br>  <br><br>There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds. But the writers duped us and instead of using Speed Spells, they chose Action Cards.<br><br>Slimy fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br> reading <br> in a fucking public location <br><br>This makes absolutely no sense<br><br>How did you get to the library? Your car? Where do you sleep at night? Your house? <br><br>Why choose to go to neither of those places, in the comfort of your own area, instead of at a public place?<br><br>People who actually read at the library are hazards of life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise but are even cheaper because you don't need to draw them and those don't rely on Speed Counters to activate.</br>  <br> There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds <br>As opposed to regular spells and traps? At least Angel Baton led to skilly as fuck plays</br></br>  <br> reading comprehension <br><br>I was talking about the title of the card, asshole</br></br></br>  Greydles are fucking stupid<br>That is all</br>  <br>NTR-V<br>T<br>R<br>V</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w4w<wbr>q5_5dUhE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Masked Hero players are angry virgins </br></br>  <br>So is your mom.</br>  <br>What's wrong with being a waifufag anon? I literally made a deck with mine and the Red-Eyes cards in CORE set thanks that they are Lv 7, but after this I have to search another alternative, if you don't like it, don't buy it, I for sure am not gonna waste money for Konami and their rarity fetish, so I just stick with other ideas.</br>  <br>Does anyone have videos of duels where people are losing or do lose and throw a fit?<br><br>Neckbeards getting mad at a card game would be hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>When the opening of the season replaced the Action Duel thing with the Riding Duel, I had hope that we would get a break from them. I don't know about you guys but it kinda kills tension for me most of the time when a guy can always get a card that bails him out just by reaching offscreen and pulling one. At least resources have to be used with situational stuff. I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum. I just wanted a break from Action Duels.</br>  <br> I was talking about the title of the card, asshole <br> What the fuck does that even say <br><br>No, i'm pretty sure you just didnt make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> OP 4 will never be done by Nona Reeves <br><br>Kill me.</br></br></br>   tfw I read the script now and Gongenzaka has Pendulum <br>Now I can expect something for Yuzu right?</br>  <br>She still has her generic Pendulums.</br>  <br>They've both had Pendulum since the Championship.</br>  <br> Now I can expect something for Yuzu right? <br>No. Gon is working for Reiji who gave everyone Pendulums. Yuzu won't have Melodious Pendulums for now at least.</br></br>  <br>The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot.<br><br>I think you are just being retarded and reeling me in with this b8</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji probably just walked into her room and handed her new Pendulums. He does whatever the fuck he wants.</br>  <br> I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum <br>Why? They don't even treat Pendulums like they are half Spell Cards in the anime.</br></br>  Tadaima  <br>There are no Kingus among us, we'd all scrub out against each other and just draw constantly.</br>  <br> Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise <br><br>Not really. Speed Spells work just like regular spells just that they a little more restricted. <br>Speed Spell and Speed Counters were great because contrary to their name they slowed the game down and both player had to built up their counters before doing the big plays. Meanwhile Arc-V duels don't last longer than three turns for the most part</br></br></br></br>  <br>All could have been resolved if he was there instead.<br><br>I bet Chojiro could bring Sora's EGAO back.</br></br></br>  <br> I just dropped by to say hello and hope you ENJOY your stay at LDS' very own Maiami Medical Function </br>  <br> The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot. <br>Oh, so I was right the first time then<br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br>The English version of the card isnt even out retard, all we have is CAC version and the shitty scans Konami just put up</br></br></br></br>  <br>jokes on you, i dont local/tourny i just enjoy spellcaster decks. and i dont see how that "wrecked" me in anyway only thing i wrecked was your mom last night faggot.</br>  <br>Activating a Pendulum in the Pendulum Scale counts as activating a Spell Card.</br>  <br>That would be Serena's room he's going to walk into, not Yuzu's. And Serena won't be using those Pendulums for a long while, just like Shun-niichan.</br>  <br>This really looks legit</br>  <br>Pendulums become Spell Cards in the Scale Zone, it's like this in the anime too. Spell Destruction can easily ruin Pendulums.</br>  <br>there are very few videos but they are in the pits of youtube....</br>  <br><br>They could've easily made an exception rule for pendulums.</br></br>   Gogenzaka getting sent into a labor camp <br>He's probably going to befriend everybody there just like he did in prison, won't he.<br><br>It'll be hilarious if Gongenzaka is actually the one to end up uniting the Commons against the Tops.</br></br></br>  If I was Dan Green I'd learn whatever I could about competitive YGO, then enter tournaments under a pseudonym. Then once I sit down to games I'd mindbreak them by detailing every play I make in full Yami voice.  <br>Serena probably wont ever use them honestly, she's too prideful to Fusion. Besides what would her Pendulums even be, Moonlight Silver Crane and Moonlight Brown Raccoon?</br>  <br> just like Shun-niichan. <br><br>R-Ruri?</br></br></br>  Recently I was watching Monster Musume because I wanted to start watching ecchi anime, and after the third episode, I just though about how a Yu-Gi-Oh! harem ecchi anime would be and what monsters would appear, big points if Dark Magician Girl is just support Ms. Smith tier instead of one of the girls. Whaddya think?  <br>I say you should leave this place before you get your ass kicked and carded.</br>  <br>They'd be broken then. It'd be a lot harder to get rid of them and you'd almost certainly have to use certain monster effects to get rid of the Pendulums as opposed to the actual monsters on the field.</br>  <br>More like Yuya will make her pendulums though the magic pendant to give as a gift to her after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ and then finally Pendulum. And Yuya goes in reverse gaining Pendulum first then XYZ/Pendulum then Synchro/Pendulum and then finally Fusion/Pendulum.</br>  <br>Are you Shun or Sora? If you are Shun you can be part of that show with 4 Ruris. If you are Sora leave please I don't want fusion scum near me.</br>  <br>If every episode is a beach episode then sure, I'm down...maybe cute date episodes too.</br>  <br> after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ <br>Not too long ago you guys were sure as sure she'd learn XYZ during the championship arc. Maybe its time to accept Standard people learning multiple summoning methods (besides Pendulum) will mainly be reserved for Yuya and Reiji</br></br>  <br>Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it. Everyone else has their reasons for their specific summoning methods. <br><br>And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  I have a feeling that Masumi and Yaiba will be sent to Synchro as back up at some point.<br><br> And Masumi will Xyz Summon Gem-Knight Pearl </br></br>  <br>I doubt that will happen, but boy it will be popular.<br><br> cute date episodes too. <br>I ship Yosenju Kamamitachi (3) with Harpie Girl and Harpie Dancer so if something like this happen it will be perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rock up to your local <br> agree to duel some guy <br> you both sit down <br> IT'S TIME TO DUEL <br> wait what the fu- <br> I PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it <br>He seems to be more the Advanced summon guy than anything, he even did it with Yosenju<br><br> And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means. <br>We can be pretty sure Rin hasnt, and hopefully Ruri hasnt or Shun will cry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ooh, and Yaiba could pull out Invoker.</br>  <br>We have to find out if she Synchro summons when it is her turn in the tournament. If she does then it is a good likelihood of her learning all summoning methods. The irony is that the timing would fit since right now soon there will be a Synchro booster set, followed by a XYZ booster set and if the pattern follows a Fusion booster set announced soon after that.</br>  <br> other guy spends 5 minutes playing solitaire <br> declares his attack <br> mirror force <br> starts raging <br> MIND CRUSH <br> silence all around <br> Dan just gets up and struts off proud of himself </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High Speed Ruris.  <br>As a big Ecchi fan, that will be the best thing ever. Besides the classic ones, I think that they can put monsters that don't have anime or manga appearances based on<br> Level <br> Rank <br> Summon Method <br> Extra Deck <br> Ritual <br>And I think that Rituals will be either the most bullied for being non-Extra Deck or the most difficult to date because of their non-Extra Deck, but they will be the most worthwhile in both cases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, Sawatari is a lot like Yuya honestly, I could see him slowly starting to incorporate the other summoning methods.</br>  <br>Konami needs to release his archetype first though.</br>  <br>Multiple summoning methods is portrayed as a really highly skilled thing, Yuyas only able to do it because DRAGONS. I love Shingo, but I dont think he has the skill for it</br>  <br>At this point anything is possible. We really haven't seen much of the Underworld Troupe, besides that it's Pendulum. Hell, it could just be a pure Pendulum deck with a Pendulum boss.</br>  <br>not just dragons anon don't forget Yuzu</br>  <br>Before being stuck with troupe, he did study and incorporate new strategies (monarch deck, pendulum strategy with Yosenju), so him picking up stuff is not impossible.<br>With the scale 1-8 pendulums, 2500 Ace and ENTERTAINMENT DUEL focus, he is pretty much trying to be Yuya, so he could copy that too</br></br>  <br>Hiiiii</br>  <br>Sawatari has skill, he's just dumb and arrogant, like Serena. He clearly knows how decks and cards work outside of his first appearance/duel which he fucked up, everything after that he's been pretty on point and look at his deck now. <br><br> Pendulum <br> 2500 Ace <br> Entertainment Dueling <br> Bugging Yuya in the Manzai and trying to be his friend <br><br>He's trying to emulate Yuya, after seeing Gon Pendulum Synchro, I'd imagine he'd want to get even stronger himself and prove that he's not a weakling and holding people back. He's going to have that one amazing moment in Academia where he just goes off, but still fails in the end due to keikaku by Yuri or Dennis or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   &gt; Black Stone of Legend is a secret rare <br>YAMEROOOOOO</br>  <br>yuya a cute!</br>  <br><br>I want Sawatari to step his game up so badly, but even after repeatedly getting BTFO he thinks he's good, so he'll never git gud ;____;</br></br>  <br>What if he actually did lose on purpose though? We'll never know, like why do kids love cinnamon toast crunch?</br>  <br>But we still don't know what all of his new Underworld Troupe deck is like.</br>  <br> World where you can summon (by a big price) your monster and be with you <br> Level and Rank are usually rivals unless they have the same numbers, also numbers don't have any effect whatsoever <br> Normal/Non-Effect monsters and Effect monsters don't get along very well <br> There are multiple copies monsters in the worlds, but you can only summon 1 monster, and it have to be one that you opened in a booster (there are exceptions) <br> Monsters that you summon in real life depends on this: <br> Any Main Deck monster other than Pendulum and Ritual: they can get along very well with you and be bros <br> Ritual: the most hardest to summon because you have to Tribute something (though not necesarily lifes as a Hungry Burger was summoned using 6 burger found in the trash), and still will appreciate/support you/love you forever because you sacrifice something for them, depending on the genre/type/attribute they could be the best ones for anything, even better than Xyz in many cases, but you need to develop your relationship with them <br> Fusion: usually the more easier in some cases but not so worthy, because they were summoned using more than 1 monster, they almost always have some different personalities, but if you learn to deal with it, they are like the Main deck ones <br> Synchro: the most interesting ones as you can bring any Synchro monster with different monster and anything can happen, if you bring a Tempest Magician with an Effect Veiler she can get some breast complex <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br> Pendulum: literally newcomers and people need to wait for more information. <br> fuck my autism </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we do, we know they're funky and sassy</br>  <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br>I sense some butthurt</br></br>  <br>Ritual master race reporting in.</br>  <br>Are ritual Red-Eyes better than Xyz spam the whole field?</br>  <br> XYZ spam <br> in front of Lord of the Red <br>That would be fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Uhh isn't Flare Metal dragon not destroyed by card effects while it has Xyz?? Also Return of Red-Eyes still summons a Red-Eyes even when destroyed</br>  <br> not using both <br><br>I love having Lord of the Red, Flare Metal, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, and Azure Eyes Silver Dragon all on the field. I hope Red-Eyes get their own Synchro.</br></br></br>  How can I ENJOY the card game when my favorites archetypes are expensive, Konami-kun?<br><br>I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid. There is any other good cards on Clash of Rebellions which may become Secret Rare too on TCG?<br><br>Also, I miss Future Fusion/Dragon's Mirror combo to summon 2 FGDs.</br></br></br></br>  So when will Academia ruin the Friendship Cup? Before Yugo beats Yuya or when Dennis reveals he is a traitor like Jack?  <br>Archfiend Black Skull Dragon seems too slow with Red-Eyes fusion and has no protection</br>  <br> draw red-eyes fusion <br> use it to summon ABSD right away <br>It's pretty fast. And it's a pet deck, who cares if it doesn't have protection on it. It's meant for  fun .</br></br></br>  <br>I really love the design of the Xyz Red-Eyes.</br>  <br><br>But what I'm saying i that the anime doesn't treat them as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>Was that confirmed or are you just saying that?</br>  <br>When I mean slow I mean you can't summon/special summon anything else but yeah your right this deck is meant for fun</br>  <br>I'm going off the fact that no cards that have been used so far that target, negate, or destroy S/T's have been used on Pendulums<br><br>Also, even though the character point out "So Pendulum cards go to the Extra Deck" no one has made a remark like "So Pendulum card are half Monster half Spell?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari couldn't have used Cricket Close in his first duel with Yuya if the Pendulums weren't treated as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure it does</br>  <br>Ah you're right, my apologies then.</br>   TCG will never make mill viable   <br> What is BA <br>Hot garbage that somehow still manages to live<br> What is Diamond killing any and all mill decks <br>The reason why BA is hot garbage</br></br></br></br>  So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right?  <br>So, if I have an Herald of Ultimateness, will he be like, my most perfect attorney?</br>   Stratos still banned for 10+ seasons in murrica, while its not in Japan <br><br>Someone please do jihad on konami or murrica</br></br>  <br> he summons HoU <br> he always get in trouble because he is your typical bad luck brian "law version" <br> tfw he can be declared not guilty in every courtroom but he tries to be lawful till the end even if he sucks at it. <br>I actually love this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of Monarch's biggest issues is ratios between themselves and fodder. Looks like he focused solely on monarchs and tributing his partners' monsters in a tag duel like a real scumbag.</br>  <br>Someone needs to fire Tewart</br>  <br>Do you not know what mill is?</br>  <br><br>No he didn't. He did exactly what he would have done had he not realized that. It's just to make Gon   and his butthurt fans   feel better about losing. Otherwise he'd go on and cry the next episodes about how he failed to avenge Yuya</br></br>  <br> I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid <br> Trying to be hipster for a deck that was used in the original anime <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <br> So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right? <br>Gonfags are so delusional. They dont even understand the character they keep defending if they think that's something he'd ever do</br></br>  <br>KoA's evil truly knows no bounds.</br>  <br><br>It's not real Gonfags. It's just buttmad Crowhaters pretending to be Gonfags. You'll notice that every character wins will suddenly have an obnoxious "fanbase" that wanted to see their character win. Heck I bet even fucking Shinji will suddenly have a rabbid and butthurt fanbase when Crow wins against him next round</br></br>  Who will card ENJOY? I bet its that traitor Jack or Bennis  <br>Of Black Stone in Japanese? Like 200 yen. A playset of Ultra Flare Metal Dragons is about 900 yen. Although it'll be like $10 and $40 respectively for Burgerland.</br>  <br>  Crow <br>You mean Tsukikage?</br></br>  Reminder this will play at the last episode at the very last scene of Arc-V<br>https://<span>youtu.be/DRSxtqO9ajc  [ ]</br>  <br>I can see it now<br><br> HE HAS NO RELEVANCE WHY DID HE WIN <br> WHY IS HE EVEN A LANCER? <br> HE'S A FUCKING BODYGUARD NOT A FIGHTER <br> ninjas riding motorcycles <br> SHINJI WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT <br> WHO EVEN USES NINJAS ANYMORE? THAT WAS SO ZEXAL <br> I HOPE HE GETS CARDED </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean after Shinji beats Tsukikage and Crow and Shinji face off in round 2</br></br>  <br>I was talking about the stone. $10 bucks sound reasonable.</br>  <br> Implying it won't be Passionate Duelist Arc-V version because you know Yugi is going to be tied up in all this shit </br>  <br>Me, I misread and thought you were talking about if Tsukikage won</br>  <br><br> Enjoy is now a permanent member of the cast <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br>Nah I prefer worst ED to be played instead</br>  <br>Nah he was just happy he lost to someone with purpose and someone with guts to make sacrifices (aka Crow losing LP on purpose) to make better gains.</br>  <br><br>On the other hand Yuya shouldn't have been able to use misdirection wing if Pendulum cards count as Spell and trap cards. <br><br>Speaking of misdirection wing I wonder when Yuya will use it again. It's one of his most powerful cards and Reiji needed serious bullshit to get past that</br></br></br></br>  Have me, Shun  YUZUUUU I AM COMING JUST FOR YOU  <br>I'd wait to see if it's a bust Secret. Although Kinka-Byo is fucking $7 and the Critias cards did get stupidly high.<br><br>I hate importing OCG singles because it's always scalped. I'd rather just buy boxes from AmiAmi if they had any. CORE sold like lightning compared to DOCS.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, but that ending is so bad</br>  <br><br>I love how there's people who act like Gon lost on purpose when he did nothing of the sorts while the entire episode revolved around how Crow wasn't even paying attention to the duel implying he would have had a much easier time winning had he played serious from the start. (Shinji points out that Crow made a rushed start, implying his opening move wasn't his usual playstyle, Crow kept looking at the audience every 5 seconds and he even points out himself how he should have put his monsters in defense position)<br><br>Gon had absolutely no way of winning this duel at all.</br></br></br></br>  Ending of Arc-V will involve  Yuzu dumping Yuya's ass for irrelevant Masumi   I thought Gon vs Crow was gonna be a two parter.<br>Looks like we'll get Shota NTR instead</br>  <br><br>Was it confirmed that it's bracket system? Or are pairs randomly determined after evety round?</br></br>  <br>INSIDE YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>It's probably random pairs, look at the reactions of Yuya, Yuzu and Dennis, no one knows who is vsing who.</br>  <br>Shut up Masumifag, go back to Tumblr writing shipping fanfics.</br>  <br>Considering what Dennis said about all technological forms of communication being scrambled across dimensions, do you think Best Dad and company are watching the Friendship Cup from Standard with Mieru's Crystal Apple Uranai Baba-style?</br>  <br>But we get unrestricted RotA in place, which helps more decks out.</br>  What happened to mono?  <br>mono is kill</br>  <br>Too busy playing fighting games and getting aids to sub children's card games.</br>  <br><br>YGO EP066 Status: <br>Script/Timing - In Progress<br>QC - <br>Uploading -<br>(65 is on the backburner to be finished after 66)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will never be ready for this episode, holy shit.  <br>Protip: It never gets better.</br>  <br/>  <br>No, definitely. The remaining five episodes are all very good, but 59 is the high point of 5D's, for sure.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the quality of the series.  ;_; </br>  <br> Something in heaven was killed. <br><br>Jesus christ who the fuck named these decks? It's as fucked up as crazy Aki's deck names.</br></br></br>  <br>Well on the other hand consider Lucciano's decks. I tend to think he and Sora could have been great friends.</br>  So I believe long ago I told this thread that Majespecters would be the next level degenerate scum. Look how they turned out.  <br> I played my first Majespector opponent during the day the update was launch and I was sincerely surprised at how utterly ass devastated the guy I dueled was when I beat them with my Jack Atlas deck<br><br>I've never built a deck before and to see it do so well is rather uplifting</br></br></br>  <br>My  dick! </br>   Still no Abyss, Belial or King Calamity on devpro <br>I can't kingu to this</br>  So /a/, what old card would you like to see new support. I vote for my nigga here  <br>Lmao isn't devpro supposed to be faster at updating than percy?</br>  God, I just want to see Yuya and Yugo duel each other already. Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon vs Clear Wing Synchro Dragon is just too hype.  <br>I just want them to go D R A G O N S on each other</br>  <br>Seiyaryu. My cardfu back in the day.</br>  <br>I want to see new Magnet Warrior support</br>  <br>Thunder Dragon</br>  <br>You could always play...ARG format pff. <br> people were actually ok with losing 3 bubbleman to get fucking stratos. </br></br>  Anyways as badass as Gon's new synchro looks I hope it does more than get HUGE though maybe his deck will become more pendulum focused since that was a pretty high power combo for anime. 5k!!!!!  <br> Lmao <br><br> ... <br> pff. </br></br></br></br>  Shun is shorter than Reiji, what a manlet.  <br>I actually want Tsukikage to win now.</br>  <br>How tall is Reiji, exactly?</br>  <br>pshh...nothin personnel...kid</br>  <br>He's not winning. Did you forget the scene in the OP? It's the only one bar Reji confronting Leo and Yugo vs Yuya that hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>It's happened. Tsukikage was protecting Reira from Security.</br>  <br>If the scenes in the OP are anything to go by, Yuya, Yugo, Yuzu, and Crow will advance, while Gongenzaka, Serena, Tsukikage and Sawatari will drop out.</br>  <br>Not stated, I'd say 1.78 at most.<br>Have a Marco sensei.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for my LDS rocket.</br>  <br>Waiting forever.</br>  <br>Can he ever catch a break from his winning streak?</br>  <br> Serena will lose </br>  <br>you know mad chimera did shoot a rocket at Blaze falcon in sora vs shun 1</br>  Why can't you be more like /dng/, /a/?  <br><br><br>How about you fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tag Force 4 was a special game.</br>  <br>EGAO World hatsudo</br>  <br>She'll have to lose eventually if we make it to the end of the tournament. The only question is who defeats her. I'd like to see her duel Yuzu, but Bennis will probably take her out.</br>  <br>Is it bad to get an erection from the names of decks?</br>  <br>nigga those Aki deck's names IIRC</br>  <br>Explains why I have a throbbing erection, then.</br>  <br>You're likely right. Fusion nuts seem to be into keeping a clean win record and always going back to defeat who beat them before. Hmm, I kinda want this because they could show us what card Dennis planed on using on her before he noticed the obelisk force.</br>  Tell me /a/ what cards do you want to see cameo's of? Mine would be pic related.  <br>Fucking hate that fucking card.</br>  why did they choose to put the worst elements of 5d's into arc-v?    I can't for them to leave Synchro Dimension and we never see Crow again until he lays the finishing blow upon the final boss because Konami thinks everyone loves Crow.

He could.</br>  <br>Parts 1-6 is Jonathan's whole genealogy of heroes and everything about their adventures described as simply weird and bizzare. Part 7 onwards just takes it to a whole new level of bizzare</br>  <br>How? Both of them have the ability to instantly defeat people by punching them, so I'd say they're about evenly matched.</br>  <br><br> aggression and attacks completely negated <br> greatest defense in whole of existence <br>If it's a matter of speed then it might be different.

That quick synopsis is immediately more gripping than any other part's. Especially part 8's lolamnesia plot.</br></br>  <br> That Jolyne <br> That Gay Priest <br>Was Pucci trying to be DIO?</br></br></br>  <br>Shigekiyo<br>didnt even check the wiki, though I dont know his last name</br></br>  <br>Did you just finish reading part 4 or something?</br>  <br>Yangu. Shigekiyo "Shigecchi" Yangu. <br><br>His arc was seriously one of my favourites. I also play him occasionally in ASB.</br></br></br>  <br>i think part 8 is pretty good</br>  <br> I also play him occasionally in ASB. <br>I hate meeting people who use him. He's the most annoying character to fight.</br></br>  <br>Nope, I've just started Part 7, finished PArt 4 about 2 months ago, just remember the character, didnt like him, but I know his name, he was there for a while</br>  <br>Shiggy is one of the most memorable parts of part 4 for a lot of people. Harvest pulled off some really creative stunts, like gathering leaves to disguise Fatty as a bush.<br><br><br>How the fuck do you get him to work in ASB?

It would be interesting if the next jojo is  another Alt DIO who happens to be a joestar and his jobro is Pucci. </br></br>  <br>I just spam level 3 harvest projectiles, sometimes switching to the low version, so they have to low block. <br><br> shoot <br> "HARVEST" <br> "HARVEST" <br> "HARVEST" <br> shoot <br> "HARVEST" <br> "HARVEST" <br> "HARVEST" <br> and so on <br><br>Also, never ever put him in defence mode<br><br><br>I main Fugo, but play Giorno or Baoh when I want to win</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a tie between Diavolo and Pucci for me. Diavolo is really cool to play and as I like trying to set up Made in Heaven as Pucci.</br>  <br>Its that time of the month<br>when the jojo generals get MiH'd</br></br>  <br> Pucci </br>  <br> Why is using C-moon so satisfying? </br>  <br>i really don't think were getting another Dio even as soon as next part.<br><br>Seriously, SBR showcased everything about the guy from a tyoe of vampirism to major oanels from PB to Giorno to The World just for good measure<br><br>To say Araki could focus on other not yet SBRd characyers would be an understatement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whenever someone uses tubby I have to use Koichi or Iggy due to the lower hitbox, plus Koichi's underpowered GER counter is pretty good</br>  <br>How many times do we have to say that it's BtD, not MiH?</br>  <br>How do you get either of them to do any damage? I legitimately don't understand how King Crimson works in ASB, and Pucci sucks until you get C-Moon, which is near impossible. At least in my experience.</br>  <br>Kosaku Kawajiri, actually. I just love when I can work out a way to hit BITE ZA DUSTU</br>  <br>I don't often have a chance to play (I don't own a PS3, but I found the game cheap and use my college's gaming club to play) but I've found Pucci to be the most fun, trying to set up "Maiden Heaven".<br><br>Those fucking name changes. Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>The gay part is a memetic thing based off his relationship with Dio.. He's better called Pucci though because that's a cool name.</br>  <br>"Oh no, something that I cannot possibly touch is falling towards me, what do I do! If only I could freeze it in place somehow!"</br>  <br>I main Johnny, once I can use the GGA and get Tusk Act 4, it's pretty much over even if I missed<br> Golden Nail Bullet <br> Down the Hole <br> CHUMIMIIIIIIN Follow <br> CHUMIMIIIIIIN appear  <br> Bullet shot from behind <br>Johnny is a bitch to play against</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does Pucci and Jolyne have to do with Part 8?</br>  <br>can you seriously not deduce the point?<br><br>The Villain and Hero of a previous part are now friendly</br></br></br>  <br>Johnny and Diego were never friendly.</br>  <br>With King Crimson a lot of his best attacks are charged punches that break through block and take a few seconds. I found that Erasing time a lot helps you to jumo behind an opponent and Pound them with a punch as soon as time erase ends. With Pucci I use Whitesnake's rush that instantly cripples the oppontment and you're able to do it twice in a row without them being able to do anything. Whitesnake also has his illusion counter move.</br>  <br>I main Kousaku because BtD is the best GHA</br>  <br>No, he's saying that SBRverse Jolyne and Pucci will be friendly.</br>  <br>I'm I the only person who mains a Hamon user in this entire thread?</br>  <br>true<br><br>they did both try to kill Valentine though, and Diego tried to rely on summoning Johnny to get the job done</br></br></br>  <br>Any more jump covers with Jojo characters?</br>  <br>Whitesnake has some ok combos if you're not getting a chance to yell at a baby.</br>  <br>If we ever see them. Hell, Giorno had a SBR version of him before she did.</br>  <br> "HAMON WAS A MISTAKE" </br>  Emporio, use Weather Report  <br>Giorno had a SBR version?</br>  <br>I main Hol Horse, like any sensible man.<br><br> Babyyy~ </br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>kek<br><br>did DIO know about the cross universe destruction thing though?</br></br></br>  <br> I main Hol Horse <br> Narancia is a better keep away character. </br></br>  Why doesn't some intelligent, resourceful stand user stab himself and his stand over and over again with the Arrow to give themselves an ultimate stand? I realize this has to be pre-SBR, with corpse parts and everything, but still:<br><br>Only villian who got (self)penetrated multiple times was Kira.<br><br>Well, there's DIO and his finger, but still.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point. Maybe not? I don't remember.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone else knows about it, and there are only a few arrows out there.</br>  <br> his stand over and over again with the Arrow to give themselves an ultimate stand? <br><br>thats because the arrow chooses when it happens.</br></br></br>  <br>*Am<br>also, Jonathan is great at melee combos, though his range game isnt all that great other then Sendo, which still takes a while to cover good distance, and Luck and Pluck</br></br>  <br>Not with Hol Horse's long fucking arms he's not. Hol Horse can grab a bitch from next week.</br>  <br><br>In the Born This Way chapters.<br><br><br>No, because there was no such thing yet. Alt Diego knew though because Valentine told him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi Oi  <br><br><br>I'm assuming no just so him being scared shitless and his death would make more sense, but the only way to know is look at the context and I'm too lazy atm</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hol Horse can grab a bitch from next week. <br>Not without "lil bomber " Volavolavolainghis ass.<br>Also.<br>"Jonathan and Narancia in rush mode"</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mista in rush mode. <br><br>Can KQ get in rush mode??<br> DAMEDAMEDAMEDAME </br></br></br></br>  <br> Aye Aye, Suh! </br>  <br>Why did they make the pilots so fucking menacing? For what purpose?</br>  <br>I thought they were making fun of somebody in that panel/timeframe for trying to fuck with Iggy?<br><br>That might also be why they had shitty attitudes. They had to put up with Iggy.</br></br></br>  <br>No, because apparently he's slower.<br><br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been trying to get better with Joseph, Jotaro and Josuke <br>But still use Johnny and Jo2uke the most</br></br>  <br> Can KQ get in rush mode?? <br>No, I tried this with both KQ and Whitesnake who do have Rush attacks but when they clash with ORA that they parry off of it. It's stupid cause both stands can Spar with Punch Ghosts.</br></br>  <br>Fuck finally I can post again!<br>Are you the type of people who just sped through the manga when the sc anime came on, and ignored all the extra details?<br>Because if you look at the manga covers Valentine's posture and weight actually does slowly change, meaning that he probably was working out the whole time</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when Kira was surprised by how fast Star Platinum was, even though its speed is standard for Stands that can rush?</br>  <br>To make the reader think any of them were the back up.<br>Similar of why the crusaders were laughing at the Sun.</br></br>  <br>But even so KQ has stood it's ground against Crazy Diamond and Whitesnake could rush against Stone Free in the manga. They have Jonathan being able to punch away bullets in rush mode.</br>  <br>Shouldn't Echoes Act 3 rush as well?</br>  <br>It has a rush move. But I think it's in the same class with KQ and whitesnake.</br>  how do I make friends?  <br>He never saw any stands before that point except for harvest and atom heart father</br>  <br>by showing off those quads<br><br>also leave 4chan</br></br></br>  <br> Ill be ur friend anon </br>  <br>[Gravity]</br>  <br>With those quads...<br><br><br>Also question.<br>Why were pucci's knives a big deal if stone free was shown to be just as fast as star platinum, and both stopped a bullet and redirected a volley of them early on in part 6</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>『GRAVITY』</br>  <br>Jotaro was a well regarded knife punching expert   didn't you read part 3  </br>  <br>The knives where thrown during Made in Heaven so they were also sped up. Jolyne wouldn't have been fast enough.</br>  <br>Because Pucci was speeding up time for non-living things and they'd be going really fucking fast once time stop ended.</br>  <br>Get quads.</br>  <br>Jotaro paternal instincts kicked at the worst moment possible.</br>  <br>But doesn't made in heaven effect only nonliving objects. At the time wasn't the sun a spinning disc in the sky, which implied years were passing in milliseconds. If this is the case shouldn't the knives rust away before they even hit her?</br>  <br> Araki logic <br>he'd give an excuse like "since Pucci had touched the knives recently they were still considered part of him" or less likely, "Pucci blessed the knives", or "SUTANDO POWAH"</br></br>  <br><br>okay sounds good let's meet up somewhere and have a cool party</br></br>  <br>Because fuck you that's why.</br>  <br>F U C K<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>Y O U<br>O<br>U</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would the knives rust that fast at that point? The sun didn't start doing that until after Pucci killed everyone. But still, it;s Araki.</br>  <br>I'm just fucking with you guys, there's a lot of shit that doesn't make since in this series and they honestly make everything better</br>  <br>Im down, we can talk about jojo and jerk off to femdio</br>  <br>  Araki loves you Spiggy  </br>  <br>Years is an exaggeration, time wasn't going that fast until after Gay Priest had killed Jolyne and friends.</br>  any news on part 4?  <br> Wanting friends </br>  Anybody have any good non pucci Jojo reaction images, mine are a~~~~~ll gone  dear jojofags, can you please fucking kill all of your secondaries than insist on plugging epic jojo references into everything and derailing thread discussions on other boards? thanks.<br><br>sincerely, a loser fag that's mad on the internet</br></br>  <br>Post those threads.</br>  <br>Post Links.</br>  <br>Yeah we'll take care of them for ya</br>  <br>I do it to cuhrayzee game general every now and then, its fun</br>  <br> good non pucci Jojo reaction images <br> non Pucci <br>Fuck, my jojo reaction Folder is so small compared to my Gay Priest folder.</br></br></br>  <br>That's like blaming /mlp/ every time some uses a horse pic to derail a thread</br>  <br>You're slacking.</br>  <br><br>I'd rather not further derail discussion in this thread or the others, sorry, but you guys wouldn't have to look far.</br></br>  <br><br>the parts in jojo I like the most are when the main gang are talking to each other about the enemy stand</br></br>  <br> fuck off spooky </br>  <br> ask us for help <br> tell us to find it <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Wamuu, Kosaku, and DIO mostly.</br>  <br>I know but, people keep making more Pucci's now that I have to collect.</br>  Is Carera Kars or Yukako?  <br> You just made it worse. Now anons will go out to try an find those threads and will fill them with Gay Priest. </br>  <br>Neither as far as we know. Just a passing reference.<br><br><br>Before Pucci became big, we had lots of Speedwagons and the usual Dios.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither she's her own person<br><br>btw what do you do named citizen</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to know what about Cars you see in Karera.</br>  <br>the first 3 letters</br>  <br>Its probably just me, but when I was reading through SBR I thought Hot Pants was Pucci's counterpart</br>  <br> Before Pucci became big, we had lots of Speedwagons and the usual Dios. <br>Those aren't posted as often now since Gay Priest took over. I'd have to go to the archive and look them up.</br></br>  <br>That was fucking awful. Someone posted that stupid meme in a thread about stuff that happens only in anime and not in real life just because OP's picture was of Giorno..</br>  <br>well, it was more to address any people in this thread that do this shit, rather than actually derail discussion even worse. i know only jojofags aren't guilty of it, but it's been pretty prominent lately.<br><br>  have the colored scans been translated yet? </br></br></br>  <br>no idea check paste bin. The only chapter that's fully in color is part 6 i believe</br>  <br> OP's picture was of Giorno.. <br>This is how it always is. As soon as Jojo is mentioned in any thread on any board.<br> THIS JOJO THREAD NOW </br></br></br>  <br>theres a fuckton of Pucci</br>  <br> Someone <br>I will shamelessly admit that that was my doing.</br></br>  <br>She's Pucci if he took responsibility for his actions but is unable to carry the burden of them.<br><br><br>Even though the thread derailed into talking about Japan's backwards ass culture and something about Clapistan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>;^^^^^^) <br>I meme and make terrible videos,<br>I only use this trip if other people do, or if I want to mess with the mods on non-blue boards</br></br></br>  <br> Both join the church due to guilt over causing their siblings' death. <br> Both end up hanging out with a Dio. <br> Both are A+ waifu material. </br></br></br>  <br>More importantly<br> both are bad memes </br></br>  <br>People get a little overenthusiastic. <br><br> And also most people hate coming to this shitty board as well, so they take any excuse they can to talk about anime on other boards.  <br><br>Can you blame them?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking nice</br>  <br>got a youtube channel of those terrible videos?</br>  <br> bad memes <br> Gay Priest <br> Bad </br></br></br>    <br>I think a better word is forced.</br>  <br>Yeah but they're really badly done because I am inept about using Vegas pro, and the one video I had that was "decent" was done infinetely better by someone else</br>  <br> forced <br>Yup. It fits, and just so happens anons are accepting it and spreading it.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Jojo is such a plot hole filled manga, the fans can't even decide what happened. And it is such a straight forward story. How can such a simplistic story have so many plot holes?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Jotaro's combos in a nutshell</br>  <br>Yes I can blame them. This general is fine and even then, there's an infinite number of other places you can discuss it on the internet without further increasing people's hate for you.</br>  <br>Araki has memory problems along with working on a weekly manga at the time.</br>  <br>cuz araki does what araki wants, common sense be damned</br>  <br> simplistic story <br>That jumbled mess is not simple.</br></br>  I hope you memers will at least buy Gay Priest's figure.  <br>Araki is 2000 years old man, he bound to forget things when he doesn't get fresh virgin blood</br>  <br>Jojolion is the only complex one so far, sometimes the fights can be a mess, or the fighting can be confusing, but the story is always simple.</br>  <br>The complexity of Part 6's story along with all the confusing bizarre crap that happens near the end may have been the reason why it had low sales at the time.</br>  Post your Best boys.  <br>Part 6 could have been GOAT if they just changed a few things</br>  <br> This general is fine <br>lmao i think gay fucking priest would like a word with you</br></br>  <br>I don't have any pictures of Kira, Wekapipo, or Aishou</br>  <br> Kira <br>Step it up.</br></br>  <br> Kira, Wekapipo, or Aishou <br>These boys are indeed best.</br></br>    Gay priest is a shitty meme. He's not even GAY    <br> He's not even GAY </br>  <br>Hah! You can't fool me<br><br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gay priest <br> not even GAY </br></br>  <br>How would that even work?</br>    If you met Cameo and wished to fight DIO, would the resultant DIO-golem be able to stop time?  <br>Avdol's golem didn't seem to have his Stand or his fire powers so no.</br>  <br>Hol Horse didn't know dio's power,so there's no way cameo would do anything like that</br>  Why does Gay Priest swim here?  <br><br>Motherfucking Bruno.<br><br>ARRIVEDERCI~</br></br></br></br>  <br> not gay <br>Then explain this shit.</br></br>  <br>Pucci isn't wanting it in that picture, which questions your logic.  Also, edit. </br>  <br>Well someone ignored what I said here </br>  <br>ARIARIARIARIARIARI ARRIVEDERCI!<br><br>God, I love that.</br></br></br>    <br>Pic related</br>  <br>Explain this then.</br>  <br>god damn it, now I need to add another thing to my Pucci_ folder</br>    <br> opting for your crotch to be facing the other guy <br>Bretty gay/10</br></br>  <br>That's just Johnny and Gyro at a costume party</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Explain this then.</br>  <br>Now if we're talking about homosexicals THOSE two are the suspicious ones.</br>  <br>How the fuck else are you supposed to carry someone in that position? You realize if he had both his legs wrapped around an arm, facing away, he'd still be like a really gay koala.</br>  <br>That's just Illuso trying to save Pucci</br>  Can someone actually explain this?  <br>He's that autistic.</br>  <br>same everytrthing</br>  <br>Given what was shown in canon they'd be bi at the most</br>  <br>You honestly can't deny even this?</br>  <br>But why is that relevant enough for two pages other than Pucci's autism?</br>  <br>Bisexicals, homosekshulls, either way they touched balls a lot</br>  <br>It's funny how there's more art of Johnny and Gyro together than those two together.</br>  <br>Enough, you have angered the bus, anon</br>  <br>Pucci and DIO's love is pure. Gyro and johnny is smut fuel.</br>  <br>What about Jotaro and Kakyoin? Polnareff and Avdol? Jotaro and Josuke? Jotaro and Jotaro? Giorno and Mista? Narancia and Fugo?</br>  <br> the bus <br>Oh fuck! I'm sorry.</br></br>  <br>Too late, Speed King has been swapped with Epitaph<br>Enjoy your fate</br></br>  r8  <br>All of those are pure, except maybe Narancia and Fugo</br>  <br>It's alright</br>  <br>Jobin's stand finally has a name?</br>  <br> Jotaro and Jotaro <br> pure <br>wut</br></br></br>  <br> Jotaro and Kakyoin? <br>Jouta happened.<br> Polnareff and Avdol? <br>Pol got NTR'd by Joseph<br>  Jotaro and Josuke? <br>Jolyne happened.<br>  Jotaro and Jotaro? <br>Jotaro happened<br>  Giorno and Mista? <br>Pure<br> Narancia and Fugo <br>Pure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>New target aquired, that's not a pizza that's Tsurugi</br>  <br> Jotaro and Jotaro? <br> Jotaro happened <br>Excuse me?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it was revealed in a tankobon, name suggest that it speeds up particles, and the song fits Jobin pretty well<br><br><br>The bus is confused</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you're to late. 『TIME FOR HEAVEN』</br>  <br>I've seen a lot of porn of Jotaro fucking different versions of himself from different parts</br>  <br>Is there a problem with this?</br>  "..."  NO NOT AGAIN  "Hey, Hey!" <br><br>Unaware of your returning consciousness you hear a familiar voice.</br></br>  STOP IT  "Wake up, Anonzaki-kun!"<br><br>Sakura...Chiyo?<br><br>You recall the name of the girl before you and slip back into unconsciousness for a long two seconds.<br><br>Sakura Chiyo; You relied on her on several occasions to meet your deadlines.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh baby  <br> it begins again <br>HOLY SHIT NO.</br></br>  Wait, what happened in the last one?!  "..."<br><br>Your eyes open again. Almost fully conscious, you get up from your bed. Your heart rate picks up and you start breathing at a fast pace. <br><br>"Sakura...-chan?"</br></br></br></br>  Oh god no.  <br> Red ribbons <br>A-are we safe?</br></br>  <br>Is there a key word I should use to find the blue thread in the archive?</br>  "You worried me so much Anonzaki...<br><br>I've been calling you for two hours!"<br><br>You start to feel bad even though you have no idea what happened or what's going on, habitually bowing your head in apology. <br><br> You try to ignore the weird feeling that something is off in this room but it continues to bother you. <br><br>"Sorry..." You tell her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you find the last one, somebody posted a bunch of links to all of the ribbon threads.</br>  Not this again, please  What the hell happened in the previous thread?    Now i'm curious  "I am really, really glad. I didn't know what I was going to do if you hadn't woken up." The way she looks at you with those eyes made your heart pound even faster. "I am truly really happy." She continues with that enticing expression on her face.<br><br>"I apologize for worrying you..."</br></br>  <br>Everyone died inside a dream inside an idea. Then everyone died.</br>  <br>CANT WAKE UP</br>  <br>What if I can't find the previous. <br>Maybe I just need to search more</br></br>  <br> Alien Skeleton in the background </br>  <br> skellington in back  <br>2SPOOKY</br></br>  You thought your panicking heart was going to stop if she had not stopped looking at you with those eyes. <br><br>Her back turned to you, the room began to feel a bit cold. <br><br>What is this change in atmosphere? <br><br>"Anonzaki-kun, the truth is..." Sakura Chiyo says with a low, almost monotonous voice. <br><br>The truth is...?<br><br>My eyelids began to feel heavy as if bricks were tied to them. What she wanted to say and all the things I thought, my mind was not able to process them at the time--yet, why did I start to feel regret?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DO NOT FACE THE SKELETON PLEASE!</br>  <br>I literally put "ribbons" in archive search and found it. Try harder.</br>  Right before you completely fainted, you gathered all the power in you to stay awake and tried to force your eyes back open.<br><br>But it was too late.</br></br>  <br> Blue ribbons <br>Our goddess is back!</br></br>  <br>HERE WE FUCKING GOOOOOOOO</br>  Oh shit, here we go.<br><br> Every time I find one of these threads, I always wonder if I missed one of them. </br></br>  <br>SHIEEEET</br>      please... make it stop  <br>Ah fuck not again</br>  <br>BLUE IS DUBS, BLUE IS TRUTH</br>  Please send help!  <br>Now my dear friend<br>Now for your sins<br>You're to suffer<br>Here it begins</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're dead boys, hug your imoutos and tell them you love them</br>  <br> STOP</br>  "Aghhngg...I'm alive..." You tell yourself in a sense of relief. <br><br>Huh? I'm not in that white room anymore.<br><br>"Ohhh, Anonzaki-kun! You're awake." You hear the sound of shuffling feet and in front of you again is Sakura Chiyo.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Blue </br>  <br>GOD PLEASE NO</br>  <br>BLUE<br>I couldn't have chosen this future. <br>This must be hell</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck fuck fuck, I see a faint hint of blue.</br>  "Where am I, Sakura-chan?" <br><br>"In your living room of course. You fainted again from fatigue and I had you carried back here.<br><br>..Sorry for not laying you on your bed. I was too...embarrassed to go in your roomwith us two alone and you not awake."</br></br></br></br>  What the fuck is this shit and why is everyone making such a huge deal out of absolutely nothing?  <br>Is it me or i see a faint blue there</br>  <br>S̠̯T͢Ò̳͇͈̠̮̼̹P̶͈̠̟̝͖̙</br>  <br>EXTREME CAUTION</br>  <br> I was too...embarrassed to go in your roomwith us two alone and you not awake. </br>  <br>When will summer leave?</br>  <br>if you don't like it, you don't belong in this thread.</br>  <br>Look more </br>  "Well anyway, Good Morning! I prepared breakfast. Let's go let's go!"<br><br>Just like that, Sakura Chiyo had you in her palm and led you to the kitchen table.</br></br>  <br>Wait wait are we small now?</br>  <br>You shouldn't post unless you've been here for at least a year.</br>  <br> this will never be you </br>  <br>No, she's a giant.</br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't be surprised. Anything goes here.</br>   this thread   <br>It's a terrible story that all the Nozaki fags ate up and have kept going for a needlessly long time.</br>  <br>It will be over soon.</br>  Yandere alert? Yandere alert.  <br> all the Nozaki fags ate up <br>I have been in every single thread and  I didn't even watch Nozaki. </br></br>  <br>It's fucking awful. It's also very possible, and I'm glad, that I missed these awful threads before.</br>  <br>This land is ruled by terror and doubt.</br>  <br> Reddit faggot detected <br> Being this newfag <br><br>Kill yourself piece of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You should fix that </br>  "You don't remember why you were in the hospital?!" Sakura is seriously taken back by this while you don't feel anything but the content in your stomach after the delicious eggs and toast breakfast she made for you. <br><br>"I can't believe it, are you actually a baka Anonzaki-kun?"</br></br>  NO I THOUGHT THIS EVIL WAS OVER WITH  <br>I highly doubt that. Shirobako and nozaki both got these threads, and if you've never seen them, I highly doubt you've been here for more than a single season.</br>  <br> I might, some day. It does look good, I just skipped that season. </br>  <br>AM I IN HER PALM OR IS MY HAND IN HER PALM<br>How could she cook me small food</br></br>  <br>I don't want to know, I don't need this.</br>  <br>Not him but these threads don't last much longer than a day or two and are rarely consistent. What kind of assumption is that that everyone has seen them unless they're newfags?</br>  <br>its actually incredibly funny. I found myself pausing it, to get all my laughs out between scenes.</br>  <br>Somehow you have to be new to find awful threads boring. You got be man.<br><br><br>Fuck, it's almost like I don't browse /a/ every minute of every day. Threads aren't up for long and there's no denying that this shit is bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why are you stil here shitposting?</br>  <br> Implying responding to a question by telling someone to kill themselves isn't shitposting. </br>  You stop for a moment to let her walk ahead of you, <br><br>"No, I'd like to believe that I am not in fact an idiot." <br><br>Ever since we were alone in the all-white room at the hospital, I've been feeling anxious but it is almost shaken off instantly by her.<br><br>This is going to be a long walk to school.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm scared.</br>   You can pick the blue ribbons, and you wake up in your bed with no memory of what happened <br> Or you can take the red ribbons and see just how far this rabbit hole goes </br>  <br>Its like looking down the long walk to the gallows.</br>  But who was eyepatch Chiyo?  "Agghh..." Your head begins to hurt.<br><br> There it is again. </br></br>  <br> Ribbon is blue <br><br> Ribbon is red <br>2spooky</br></br></br></br>  <br>What... What was it that you wanted to tell me at the hospital chiyo?</br>    What the hell is going on here.<br><br>Someone fill me in</br></br>  what month in 2014 did the blue chiyo posting start so i can go back to the archive and follow it  <br>2 chiyos at the price of one  and your life <br>i don't see a problem</br></br>  <br>Oh shit, I finally got it. DON'T YOU SEE? It all makes sense</br>  <br>It's here. <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125948<wbr>881/#125948881 <br><br>Since everyone else is such a dickbag about simple things I went and found it myself.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>"Teach a man to fish..."</br>  We're in class. I try not to notice but Sakura has been turning back to look at me from time to time. <br><br>That beautiful face of hers...<br><br>I'll pretend to fall asleep.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a thread. I hardly think giving people the link to the backstory of this BS is gonna end in /a/ being any more flooded with summer that it is.</br>  <br>w-where are all the other kids</br>  <br>You're right. I've kinda been a jerk for no reason, to be honest. Too much time here, I suppose.</br>  Wh-Whaat?!  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12594<wbr>8881/#125948881</wbr> <br><br>Teaching involves more than being a total cunt.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I am from the RTFM school, but we at least slap people with TFM when we don't answer them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING CHANGELING SKINWALKERS</br>  <br>Someone listening to reasoning? <br><br>On this board? <br><br>What the fuck is going on, I want my old elitist snob /a/ back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, I'm a jerk and I'm sorry. Not even sarcastic, I don't want to act this way. I already found the link in the archive, yet I didn't post it.</br>  Sakura doesn't have the same gym period as me. <br><br>To be honest, gym was over for me twenty minutes ago. However, I decided to stay back by myself.<br><br>I'm going insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going insane. </br>  <br>Brain damage causing color blindness</br>  <br>But who damaged the brain?</br>      <br> You don't remember why you were in the hospital?! </br>  <br>Probably  purple chiyo </br>  Against the cold corner of the empty gym I hugged my knees. <br><br>If anyone found me like this, I would be the laughingstock of the school for quite some time. <br><br>"Oh man...--Aaagghhh!<br>Again?!" My head flinched with pain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck</br>  The rider never ends, doesn't it?  <br>Oh no</br>    "I COULDN'T PROTECT HER!"  <br>Dear fuck, not the dumpster.</br>  <br>YAMEROOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>AAAAAAAAAAA</br>  "Everything, everything was my fault!"  <br>NOT AGAIN</br>  <br> blood stained knife </br>  <br>Here we go again</br>  <br>Well, at least it's not an axe?</br>  "Up until the very end...it was my fault..."

It was never good.  <br>It was okay-ish.</br>  It was good up until the inevitable point where Naruto is revealed to be chosen one/child of prophecy etc.  <br>This. I was super hype about this anime since I was young. The manga ending was so rushed to finish at 700. There's filler for days in the anime, I can't see why anyone would love this. <br><br> EPISODE 7,302 <br>Today we will see what Shikamaru does in his house when his dad isn't home for board games.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;being apart of big 3 <br> never good <br>kill yourself right now</br></br></br>  <br>Average up to snake butt. <br>Possibly a contender for worst written manga wen it come to everything after.</br></br>  I'm of the mindset that it would be goodish if every action wasn't met with 4 minutes of expositional dialogue explaining what very blatantly happened on screen. <br>If all the fights were re-cut without any of the flashbacks and stuff, it would be much more enjoyable. <br>I'm actually kind of surprised it hasn't been done already.</br></br>  <br>It was never good, you just had shittier tastes back then. The side characters did make the Chuunin exam arc pretty enjoyable, though. It was all downhill from there.</br>  <br>I stop watching the original at episode 100 or something, it was fucking boring and reptitive at that point<br>Did I miss anything good?</br></br>  <br>The big 3 refers to the 3 most popular animes in the Toonami lineup that made Anime popular in USA. Doesnt mean they are good now.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>what? I don't give a shit to spoilers, tell me</br>  <br>is this fucking bait</br>  <br>Pretty damn good.</br>    <br>Manga or anime? Filler hell makes a difference.</br>  <br>Asuma dies</br>  can we use this thread to continue the last one that just died?<br><br>do you guys think we'll get something after the boruto movie or it'll be done forever?<br><br> i admit i'm gonna miss it </br></br></br></br>  <br>cant tell if serious.</br>  <br> big three <br>Do you mean Cowboy Beep-boop, Samurai Shampoo, and Evangelion?</br></br>  <br>the best arc in the series and about 100 episodes of filler</br>  <br>Not really, no. It could have been salvaged by someone skilled and capable, but that's not much.</br>  <br>Jiraya dies, Asuma dies, Naruto parents, Minato's revival, Kakashi being best, Sakura getting shit, kyuubi being moe, Hinata winning the narutobowl and Sasuke being a fag.<br><br>Honestly you didn't miss much.</br></br></br>  ;^) <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DSx<wbr>mSwkepWs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I kinda want a SOL series but I know that's impossible so I'd rather see it dying. Fuck if I ever have to endure another 10 years of shit writing.<br> There's not enough Hinata being greatest mom/waifu </br></br>  <br>The Big 3 is Black Clover, BnHA and OP now.</br>  I like how we can have over 5million fate/oriemo threads but not a single naruto thread.  <br> Black Clover </br>  Went to shit after the Rock Lee vs Gaara fight, was a 6/10 before  <br>It was so good though<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=16KH<wbr>VqOntNE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  I enjoyed it aside from Naruto's idiocy and the stupid monologues. The Chuunin exams were damn tense.  <br>I always loved that Sasuke/Orochimaru fight episode in the Forest of Death.</br>  If we're using this as a continuation from the last one, I'd like to note this is probably the only time I've actually wanted a new generation story  <br>1-220 was certainly way better animated than Shippuden. <br>Valley of the end battle (128-135) looked pretty good imho.</br></br>  fuck off  <br>Shippuden has Kakashi vs. Obito, Hinata vs. Pain, and Madara vs. the Alliance for top notch episode animation though.</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't like Naruto, But I have to say that it was WAY better before Shippuden.</br></br>  <br>Yes it was a 10/10 manga until the end of the chuunin exams<br><br>The arc where they go recruit Tsunade was okay, nothing special.<br><br>Sasuke's rescue arc was where the series died. It totally lost direction, became about bringing Sasuke back instead of Naruto's rise to Hokage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you dumb?</br>  <br>this isn't about gaiden or the movie so...?</br>  <br>Shippuden was good to a point. I think a lot of people forget that.</br>  <br>With all the other shit on /a/ naruto threads daily are not desirable or necessary? Please tell me what is necessary and desirable on this board.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128689279 <br>That's wrong. The part 1 anime is the biggest reason why the fuckoff guys exist. The transition to part 2 is what killed the show. You had fans turning to detractors because of that tedious and fuck long filler</br>  <br>And that point was Pain reviving everybody.<br><br>Or the 5 Kage summit arc. Either one</br></br></br>  <br>Man, I can't even hate that one episode of Naruto vs Pein. <br>I know it gets shit on a lot here, but it makes sense in motion.</br></br>  <br>Stop giving idiots with no reading comprehension skills attention. Report and ignore.</br>  <br>Says the Narutard burthurt he can't have his 24/7 Naruto generals anymore.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kXh<wbr>AGO4IE8Y</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>The first series still has the best-animated episodes, but Shippuuden had more consistently good episodes at some point when some talented animators joined the in-house staff.</br>  <br>The description is vague enough that mere snippets of something new can be new material.</br>  <br>It is indeed wacky, but the episode was full of great animation as well.</br>  <br>neither of those are even close lol.<br><br>you mean to say SAO,AoT and Fairy Tail.</br></br></br>  <br>Please stop giving them attention. The point of that mod post was to stop the general Boruto threads. We have had Naruto threads before and this is a discussion about the series, not unlike the countless discussions about other series on the board. Nobody's being cancerous, so there's nothing to complain about. Report all shitposters, ignore all shitposters.</br>   /r/ing a good torrent for The Last. Can't find a good one anywhere. It was released July 22nd right?   Remember when it was explicitly stated that the Byakugan was stronger than the Sharingan?<br>I miss those days.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128687294 <br> mah Sasuke  <br><br>It's shit anon</br></br></br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that newfag Narutard.<br><br>Your cancerous tumblrshipping was never welcome on /a/.</br></br></br>  That's what I've read on /a/.<br>Unlike most of these hypocrites though, I've never seen a second of Naruto.</br>  I stopped watching after the Neji and Naruto fight.<br>Still love Rock Lee.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128689892 <br> The animation in OG Naruto is much more charming. <br>What do you mean by 'charming'?</br></br>  <br>Literally no one cares.</br>  <br>STOP<br><br>REPLYING</br></br></br>  I feel like the science guys in the boruto movie are a prelude to a much bigger conflict. If they do a TV series, I'd like them to tackle this,  <br>It was never that way. Kakashi only states that the Byakugan has superior vision in terms of magnification, since the Byakugan can see Tenketsu and the Sharingan can't.</br>  <br>from what I recall, isn't hinata's range like 10 or 5km or something?</br>  <br>She identifies the flames of Amaterasu from Sasuke and Itachi's battle from 10 KM. <br><br>I wonder what the diameter of Konoha is.</br></br></br>  <br>i liked naruto more than shippuden but then again its been forever since ive watched it and i never even finished it</br>  No, it was good when he was copying HxH in the exam arc and it was good in the first half of the saske rescue arc. If the series had ended after the sand village guys ended their respective fights and just had naruto and sasuke just die from a sudden heart attack it would have been a great series overall.  <br> two main characters had the sharingan <br> a mini boss and a love interest had the byakugan <br><br>The sharingan was always going to end up stronger. Heck, Kakashi calls the Uchiha Konoha's strongest clan of the village in one of the very first chapters.</br></br></br></br>  only the first zabuza arc was good, everything after was shit  I watched all of it subbed years ago. I like the Laughing Shino episode and the rest of the filler arc.  The Chunin Exams was by far the best part. Rescuing Sasuke was okay. Shippuden I dropped after a while. I think Orichimaru was living in someone's mind or some shit. That was just too stupid for me to continue.  <br><br>go to nyaa nigga</br></br>  <br>oh god that avail sound was too much</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128691532 <br>you heard me</br>  <br>It's the SAME guy everytime, like jesus, do you browse the whole day? That is unhealthy.</br>  <br>honestly it was good for what it was<br><br>a simple unique battle manga with cliches here and there but that is expected of jump comics at the time<br><br>then it started getting retarded really fast<br><br>but in my opinion I forgave kishi for everything after hinata won. I'm not even a shippingfag but the tears produced were the best I've ever seen off a manga .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's got mental problems.</br>  Reminder that Naruto humiliates his son in front of everyone.  <br>Proof.</br>  <br><br>Enough.

No, and fuck off.  <br>2dank</br>  Assuming you don't simply say that it was always bad, can you pinpoint the moment(s) where the quality dropped most sharply?  naruto literally shits hit pants in the ova. fuck off naurto shitters  <br>But those shows are trash</br>  <br>Literally every dad in Naruto was awful to some degree</br>  <br>Shikamaru's, Kakashi's, Guy's</br>  <br>I wouldn't say good.

That's like some guy buying a lamborghini and telling you he doesn't care about materialistic stuff.</br></br>  <br>It was alright before shippuden yeah.</br>  <br> be Neji <br> be right about destiny <br> some punk-ass faggot claims you're wrong <br> decide to tag alone to show him you're actually right <br><br> 8 years and 600 chapters later <br> give up and just die, ain't nobody got time for this shit fuck everything <br> like 2 chapters later it turns out you were completely right all along <br>great going</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This exactly.</br>  <br> well animated and with good choregraphy <br> Naruto vs. Neji <br><br>You couldn't have picked a worse fight to mention along side your praise of the series' choreography.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy DARKNESS only because everytime it got pushed, Saskue got his ass handed to him.</br>  <br>If more filler had Shikamaru in it, the anime probably wouldn't be bad</br>  <br>Naruto was still kinda right thou, Neji used that argument to tell people who weren't good at things that they never would be and that they should just give up.</br>  <br>He never said Neji and Naruto's fight was well choreographed, you just wanted to find an excuse to use that .gif, dumbass.</br>  <br>Eh, Naruto was right in the generic "work hard, dont give up" sense but the faggot wasnt exactly some average Joe becoming great through perseverance or whatever.</br>  <br> mangareader </br>  <br>I never said that he said it. I was just pointing out the unfortunate juxtaposition.<br><br>And yes, I have literally gigabytes of retarded pics which I look for every opportunity to post. That's beside the point, however.</br></br></br>  <br>no, if the anime had more shikamaru, his character would have been ruined as badly as anyone else's in that filler-ridden hell</br>  <br>Fuuuuck Rock Lee should have been the main character. This should have been the main series.</br>  Shippuuden could have been a whole lot better without the Sasuke and Uchiha dickriding.  <br>This is probably the truth. I just need to show my appreciation for him since it's not often I get to do that.</br>  <br>Now all that's left to do is watch The Last and the Bort movie.</br>  <br> Rock Lee should have been the main character <br><br>I- yeah I have no objections to this</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> that .gif <br>You know the both of them ripped it off from an old kung fu movie, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You've got the scenes mixed up, the kung fu movie one was with Sasuke.</br>  <br>A series where Sakura is less austistic and goes for Lee instead of the sauce.</br>  <br>Rock Lee honestly should have gotten Sakura. He was the best person to her while Sasuke tried to kill her multiple times. Although he's too good for her anyway.</br>  <br>The whole reviving everyone thing was the point to drop it completely. It was just that bullshit.</br>  <br> watch <br>I haven't watched Naruto since 2008.<br><br>Subs for The Last are out, btw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only said "watch" because those 2 movies are 100% canon.</br>  man... you guys hate on some stupid shit  Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br><br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br><br>Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But we know Lee/Sakura will never happen because Kishimoto is a huge Saucefag.</br>    <br>Dear God you must truly hate this anime to your core,<br>did Natuto beat you and batter your mom when you were a child or something?</br></br>  <br>How new are you?</br>  <br> mangapanda <br> shitphone <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well did he??</br>  <br>still not getting any solid answers from you elite mangaproz</br>  If you never found Rock Lee cool, you're either a liar or full of shit. Or both.  <br> mangainn <br> mangapanda <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128695507 <br><br>It's a copypasta you fucking newfags. Having you in Naruto threads just makes Narutofags look worse.</br></br></br>  Hunter x Hunter is better    <br>Just admit Naruto threads nowadays are shit from the start.</br>  <br>Take it easy guy, its just the internet</br>  <br>Fuck off shitphonefag</br>    <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128695507 <br>AHHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHA, THIS PLACE IS FUCKING DEAD, THAT SHIT WAS IN A FUCKING BANNER FOR YEARS. SAVE US MOOT.</br></br>  <br>Naruto threads are the most civil as they've been for 8 years. You see how you can sit down comfortably right now? I still need to use a donuts after the horrible ass rapings we received for years on end.<br><br>There was a time that the chemo was so fervent that even One Piece would get blasted just for the crime of being in the same magazine.</br></br></br>    <br>Wich one is better? Rock lee vs Gaara or Ichigo vs Byakuya, they are very similar.</br>  <br>Ever since the mods decided to delete Naruto threads while keeping One Piece generals up, yeah.<br><br><br>You're embarrassing yourself, newfag.</br></br></br></br>    <br>10/10 - Hinata winning<br><br>The tears were delicious</br></br></br>  Thread got this far, and people still aren't discussing the plot of the new movie that was revealed.<br><br>Despite it being revealed just yesterday.</br></br>  <br>Incomplete projects get an F by deafult.</br>  <br>wrong</br>  <br>it was. <br><br>in the past couple of threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Lee v Gaara made you feel pretty hard at the end instead of having victory via evil mode, so I say it takes it</br>  <br> inb4 bait <br>Gaara vs Lee because at least initially the fight wasn't based on muh asspull powerups. <br> Byakuya talks up Bankai like it matters at this point <br> supposedly takes 1000 or so years to obtain, if at all <br> random-ass fake Shinigami gains it in days </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was already discussed in some other Naruto thread.</br>  <br>This thread pretty much started out as b8. I'd be surprised if it survives the night.</br>  Oda praises Naruto, what now?<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/05/<wbr>04/exclusive-eiichiro-oda-and-masas<wbr>hi-kishimoto-interview-from-naruto-<wbr>book-of-lightning/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Never forget</br>  <br>If there's one thing I liked about the original series is that power levels weren't all over the place. Besides the occasional Naruto taps into the Nine-tails, there were not really any asspulls.<br><br>Also Sasuke Retrieval Arc is the best of all time and Shikamaru was the best character.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Oda even has the time to read nardo <br>Literally just being polite.</br></br>  <br>Shikamaru will always be anti power levels<br><br>His son doesn't fall far from the tree, as Boruto despite having a lot of talent gets stuck against him pretty quickly.</br></br></br>  <br>Two shitty shounen authors, who cares?</br>  <br>If you enjoyed Naruto, it's because you're too young to have grown up with Dragonball Z, and that show had a LOT of problems. Naruto and shows like Naruto (like Bleach and One Piece and other "shonen" anime) are crap that people get invested in because they drag out story lines, making you invest more and more time into it until you get some kind of resolution. Then a new enemy appears, another carrot gets hung in front of your nose, and you go for it like a moron. Rinse and repeat. <br>Now, I can forgive a lot of this type of crap because there'll usually be some cool fight scenes or something ridiculous to make it worthwhile, but with Naruto, you're taking something cool (ninjas) and combining it with a bunch of insufferable children and terrible character designs (and that's saying a lot considering the other "shonen" I'm comparing this to).</br></br>  There's a "surprising" number of people who "hate" Shounen in this thread  <br> I'm so done. Like, so done. My soul has died. Is that what depression feels like? Holy mother of dragons. <br><br>Some of these comments are hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>I always appreciated the fact that Shikamaru got to be the only one to be promoted Chunin through his display of knowledge and skills even though there were people like Sasuke and Neji who at glance seem stronger.<br><br>I kind of hope Shikadai manages to beat Boruto in the Chunin exams in a similar fashion to his dad.</br></br></br>  <br> people get invested in because they drag out story lines <br>I'd argue that with Naruto and Bleach it's actually the opposite; suckering you into liking them immediately, then people without the ability or willingness to consume media critically can go an extraordinarily long time without noticing that the series they fell in love with has gone to shit.</br></br>  <br>I thought it was good until the 4th War arc. But the ending redeemed that all for me too so I have a pretty fond memory of the series. It was good for what it was as an entry level shonen.</br>  So is everyone in agreement that Naruto is a bad father?  <br> I kind of hope Shikadai manages to beat Boruto in the Chunin exams in a similar fashion to his dad <br>He wins, kinda.<br><br>Burrito cheats with a science device and daddy catches him, so he's disqualified.<br><br> Good thing, too. If he actually fought fairly Shikadai would probably be dead because invisible Rasengan is some shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bort pls</br>  <br>Shikadai wins<br><br> Boruto gets trapped by shadows briefly and tries to resort to cheating, his dad interrupts the match to disqualify him for cheating and Lee announces that Dai wins. Dadruto says he'll talk about this shit when they get home, Boruto says if Naruto had time to talk to him this wouldn't have happened in the first place. </br></br></br>  <br> 2/10 - Sasuke vs. Itachi <br><br>What? That was an actual good fight and the twist afterwards that Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No one cares, tumblrshits.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to use the scene in chapter 700 where he spends time with Boruto painting the Hokage mountain instead of going to the Kage meeting on time as the example?</br>  <br> twist afterwards that Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype <br><br>this was about a big a twist as tobi = obito, friend</br></br></br>  <br>Oda and Kishi are best friends, and contrary to popular belief Naruto did have some well written parts at times.</br>  <br> Implying that there aren't people on /a/ right now who flipped their shit over Naruto pairings. <br><br>/a/ isn't as pure as you think.</br></br></br>  Naruto went to shit the instant it ran out of stuff to rip from HxH  <br> Itachi was actually doing good was pretty hype too. <br> mindfuck your bro into being the ultimate edgelord <br> good <br>fucking kishi</br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto did have some well written parts at times. <br>Yeah but don't tell anyone or you'll trigger shitposter-kun </br></br>  <br> Naruto did have some well written parts at times. <br>Yeah. It's just that later on he kind of shit on those same well written parts. <br><br>everything else was lifted from HxH.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't know about the movie <br> Burrito didn't throw the cake. nardo did, because he sent a clone to his daughter's birthday party and it popped. He also makes his son address him formally, neglects him to the point where getting his father's approval causes him to cry, and confiscates his headband in front of the entire ninja world because he cheated in the exams - which he only did so papa would notice him. Burrito even says that he'd be happy to receive a lecture since he'd actually be talking to him. </br></br>  <br>You saw all that coming? Kudos to you I guess. Tobi = Obito was blatant as hell after that Kakashi backstory was published but we had never really been shown the good side of Itachi until Sasuke's talk with Tobi.<br><br><br>Well Sasuke has always been an edgelord, it wasn't surprising to see him take his brother's intentions the wrong way, plus it was kinda necessary to get Naruto to save him since it was always his goal to rescue Sasuke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No... no. It really wasn't very hype at all. The whole thing still relies upon retarded logic.<br><br> To prevent a "civil war" which will causes many people on both sides to die and which will make us seem weak in the eyes of the enemy nations and potentially provoke them to attack, we will per-emptively kill everyone on once side including non-combatants and tell the enemy nations that a single person did it during one night and wiped out the entirety of our most prestigious magic eyeball bloodlines. This will avoid death and not make us seem weak. </br></br></br>  <br>Other than the Chunin Exams mirroring Hunter Exams and Kurapika's revenge what else did he copy from HxH?</br>  <br> He also makes his son address him formally <br>Ha ha, he makes him call him "Hokage-sama"? What a douche.</br></br>  <br>It was good for one arc.</br>  <br>beginning 7/10<br>bell test 8/10<br>zabuza 9/10<br>chunnin prelims 7/10<br>Chunin finals + sand invasion 8/10<br>Itachi returns 6/10<br>Tsunade 5/10<br>Kakashi Mask 8/10<br>Get sasuke back 9/10<br>Filler bullshit 1/10<br><br>Shippuden beginning 7/10<br>Rescue gaara 8/10<br>Return of Sasuke 5/10<br>Ninja zombies and some guy named sora Filler - 1/10<br>Shikamaru vs hidan 8/10<br>3-tails and guren the crystal lady Filler- 3/10<br>Itachi pursuit 5/10<br>training and vs. pain 9/10<br>Naruto meeting cloud ninja 2/10<br>Kage meeting and Sasuke's infiltration 5/10<br>Turtle Island + naruto training 7/10<br>Ninja war - varies between fights but mostly 3/10<br>Obito reveal and fighing obito and madara - 5/10<br>Kaguya - 4/10 <br>Final Naruto vs Sasuke 9/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it wasn't necessarily clear earlier that the village put him up to it, but it was pretty clear all along that the uchiha were a bunch of treacherous if not outright evil fucks, and the constant goading about sauce needing more power/eye hacks was fishy from the moment it was revealed.</br>  <br>Bell Test / Ball Test<br>Weird mix of high-tech (dot-matrix computer displays) with a fantasy setting which was mostly dropped after the Chuunin Exams.<br>The "dangerous world" setting where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests, which was mostly a dropped after the Chuunin Exams.</br></br></br>  Wait so are there spoilers of the entire Boruto movie or was it just like a 30 min sneak peek kinda thing?  <br>Entire movie</br>  <br>Apparently the entire movie. Don't take internet word as law though.</br>   One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach have characters with connections to the moon   <br><br>Ah alright. How exactly does Boruto cheat with the device anyway?</br></br>  <br>Wave arc was good. Would have been better if the "elite genius" Sasuke had stayed dead from Haku, in order to show the real stakes of doing missions.<br>Chunin exams were also alright, but Sakura really should not have survived it. Her death would have shown kakashi to be a flawed teacher, as well as serious'd Naruto the fuck up. This would have made room for other, more interesting, characters.</br></br>  <br> and madara <br> -5 <br>Fuck you, nigga. He was the only enjoyable part about all that nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br> Weird mix of high-tech (dot-matrix computer displays) with a fantasy setting <br> The "dangerous world" setting where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests <br>Oh yeah because none of THOSE things were ever used before HxH</br></br></br>  <br> How exactly does Boruto cheat with the device anyway? <br>Apparently it allows the user to use any jutsu and all 5 elements excluding kekkei genkai, even if they aren't ninja.<br><br>nardo banned its use from the exams because muh hard work. A sleazy Jew talks Burrito into using it, even though he's only using him as a marketing gimmick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>For some reason I added ''-" to certain arcs. Didn't mean to do that. <br><br>fighting obito and madara was 5/10 for me not -5</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I was too young to realize it when first reading it like 7 years ago.</br>    <br> where society is okay with children competing in lethal tests <br>Only in ninja villages where it's there job to do that kind of shit. The population of Konoha is only a fraction of the population of the Fire Country.</br></br>  <br>Or at least it was. Nowadays nobody really knows how the politics of that world work.</br>  <br>Some Shill gives Boruto a device that can instant cast any jutsu without any effort automatically, trying to use Boruto to promote it because Naruto said they couldn't use that shit in the exams and morally he's a bit against it since it takes away any actual effort the kids might put into their training. It becomes the ultimate crutch that excuses them from ever learning.<br><br>People always scoff at this shit, but Naruto did put in a lot of training all through his life, he did work to get where he was before they started going "Destiny, destiny, fate fate" near the end of the manga.<br><br>When Boruto is caught cheating the shill jumps out on stage with cameras trying to shill harder about how this device can do anything.<br><br>This device could easily be worse than any human nuke. Anyone including non ninjas would be able to cast forbidden shit with ease with this bullshit, the world would start to see some problematic shit go down if this catches on. Naruto banned that shit in this case for a reason. <br><br>He's fine with Konohamaru using it to demonstrate various family techniques for the kids, but this guy is trying to shill it to say that hard work will never matter anymore and is pointless.<br><br>You can't use it during the exams, since its an entire point that you're supposed to be testing your own abilities, not the abilities of the machine. Its like bringing a calculator during your math exams.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that image  <br>You know something is bad when even the LOL SO RANDUMB AND KAWAII XD crowd is making fun of it.</br></br>  <br>Who is the Bleach one?</br>  The Kakashi vs. Obito fight was good. I never saw any of Shippuden besides that one 3 minute fight though.  I think it was pretty good up until the end of Zabuza arc  <br>It's still a pretty neat device though.<br><br> Also, a bunch of science assholes who got caught in Sauce's dimensional portal accidentally revive Momo by showering his corpse with ninjutsu, which he converts into chakra pills and eats to revive. </br></br></br>  <br>Damn, then again it is getting close to its official premiere date.</br>  <br>They're notable mainly in how they're similarities with H×H that were discarded simultaneously with the end of the Konoha Hunger Games.<br><br><br>You have to admit there was a sudden shift away from violent themes afterward. The Zabuza arc and the Chuunin Exams had major themes of a dangerous world. Afterwards, we got nothing but cop-outs, suicides, heart attacks, and Disney Deaths.<br><br>In comparison, Hunter × Hunter actually maintained a level of integrity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Souds pretty solid.<br>Can agree with that, would give Sauce vs Best Boy bigger score though.<br><br>Still, can agree.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then again it is getting close to its official premiere date <br>You mean today?</br></br>    So honestly speaking is Shippuden even going to end? Or will they animate the novels too and even add in SoL filler?  <br>Which is why Naruto didn't ban it entirely, just during the exams for the most part.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Do you think the US would be a world power if we banned nukes? Even if we don't use them, everyone else will. Naruto is literally setting his village back decades.<br><br><br><br>According to the spoilers I read, Bolt uses the gauntlet to preload Mass Shadow Clones. Then Naruto punishes him for cheating. Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything ends, anon.</br>  <br>oh I meant to say its nationwide release which is in August.</br>  People say it went to shit when the exam arc started but really it was during the tail end of it. The series had some good ideas and some solid characters but the plot got way too convoluted and went entirely in the wrong direction. <br><br>Fight at the waterfall was cool though and Tsunade was hot.</br></br>  <br>I saw it when I was like 13 and it first came to toonami<br><br>it was neat, all about being sneaky and shit<br><br>but after a certain point it stopped being clever and turned into dragon ball Ninjas</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Afterwards, we got nothing but cop-outs, suicides, heart attacks, and Disney Deaths <br>You have no idea how refreshing it is to learn that nardo and his son actually straight-up murder the big bag in the movie. No TnJ, no sob story. Just vaporize the fucker.</br></br>  <br>    Momo <br>Who</br></br>  <br>Seeing how much money SP made off of THE LAST box office, and BD sales will be released later tonight you can bet they'll keep making more Nardo. I've seen THE LAST constantly go out of stock on Amazon, I'm kinda excited to see how much it will sell.</br>  <br>Ninjas are essentially mercenaries but are (supposed to be) loyal to their village, and the village is loyal to their country's Daimyo.<br>But apparently the ninjas are also the country's standing army?</br></br>  <br> Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally <br>Shadow Clone =! Mass Shadow Clone<br><br>He also uses the Raiton we see in the trailer and a Suiton during the 2nd portion, but nobody catches on.<br><br>He's a real cheating son of a bitch, or in other words, a sneaky ninja.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That seems broken as fuck, I'm not surprised by it being banned. <br><br>Boruto's power levels are already pretty high compared his classmates. How was he convinced to use it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Says the tumblrshit </br>  <br> Which is retarded, because it's not like Bolt can't use Shadow Clones naturally. <br><br>You're not getting the whole crutch aspect<br><br>Bolt is already a genius nin, he didn't really need to use this shit, yet he still did because he wanted to guarnatee the result in a panic when he could have fought hard to secure it himself with his own power.<br><br>He had all the ability naturally, but when push came to shove he used a crutch rather than putting the work in on his own. Yes he can already use shadow clones, but he still ended up using this for a reason. If you have the means to do it easily, compared to having to work out the problem on your own with math, you might sometimes cheat even if you don't need to do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was alright up until the mass resurrection at the end of the Pain Arc. Coincidentally, that's around the time where I dropped the series wholesale.<br><br>Lucky me, huh?</br></br>  <br>Bolt used the gauntlet while captured by the Shadow Binding.<br>Naruto noticed something was off and Hinata confirmed it with her Byakugan.</br></br>  <br>I also saw it from Toonami. I followed it much further into the series. What really turned off was the raw amount of filler was disgusting. Hundreds of episodes of filler. After the filler before shippuden I swapped over to the anime. What I liked about it was that people died all the time, important characters that never would return, however when they started magically bringing everyone back to life thats when I quit because it was a bunch of garbage that people could just die and be reborn again effortlessly</br>  <br>Shill approaching him and giving it to him under some false pretenses.<br><br>Naruto praises Boruto when he hears he passed the first part of the exam, so he holds onto the cheat device because he wants the attention. If he keeps winning then dad will keep looking at him for now.<br><br>It sound one sided here or there, but the movie does give a feeling for both Naruto and Boruto's view points here. Both of them have some meaning why they did what they did, even if they both fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How was he convinced to use it? <br>Jew-kun preyed on his fear of disappointing his father. Which sounds silly, I know. After all, he's a genius prodigy.<br><br>Problem is all the faggots around him never give him his dues because he's the son of nardo, so he's expected to be God's gift to the world.<br><br>Couple that with his already shaky relationship with his dad and you can see why he took the bracelet even if he didn't really need it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr durr u have to earn it for yourself <br>Meanwhile, every other village is going to start training their kids with ninja gauntlets from age 4. The Leaf is going to send their kids out with nothing but hard work against enemies their age who are able to create tsunamis and level forests.</br></br>  <br> Lucky me, huh? <br><br>Nah, sounds like you were just so put off by that plot twist that you assumed everything after is shit, and feel you're still entirely in the right without wanting to look into it, because "Surely I'm right"<br><br>Final arc is definitely worth seeing for a few reasons, like Madara.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why don't we love Tsunade?  <br> Implying the other Kages arn't faggots like Nardo. <br>You know they are.</br></br>  <br>Not to mention you have to ask yourself how these retarded no magic plebs are in charge when Madara could casually pick up the continent and drop it on their heads. <br><br>How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show? It makes no sense. <br><br>Furthermore, if the ninja are all descendants of moon MILF, then where did the normies come from?<br><br>The more you think about it the less sense it makes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   214 replies   <br>If you cut out the filler it is decent</br>  <br>It got progressively worse afterwards, by orders of magnitude. Terrorist Darkness-is-too-Strong I-Have-Canonical-Brain-Damage Sasuke was painful to read. The Great Ninja War was as Part 1 and Part 2 up to the Mass Resurrection, and it was just... so much stupid shit. Too much to quantify.<br><br>And the end? Complete clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  Has Viz announced a theatrical release date for Boruto?  <br>dyslxeia conifrmed<br>its 241 repiles</br></br>  <br>why not just skip the filter?<br><br>doesn't the filler start at like episode 120 then from there to 220 its just nothing but filler then shippuden starts?</br></br></br>  <br>too old</br>  <br>If you take away the guantlet from enemy ninjas, they'll be weak shits who have never trained a proper jutsu in their lives and can't do shit on their own without their iphone's working as a calculator for them.<br><br>Its a generation where no one is going to know what to do the second you take their device away, they wouldn't have trained worth shit because they have something to rely on entirely like this.<br><br>If you teach leaf ninja to simply disable the enemy gauntlet, then effectively the enemy will have lost out right there because they're that shit relying on it.<br><br>Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A clusterfuck would imply you could not follow the plot. The plot was very easy to follow, it was just very stupid.</br>  <br> implying this sort of technology isn't posing a danger to the whole power structure of the world <br> implying in a society of people whose economy depends on secrecy and assassination the scientists and all devices would not get disappeared incredibly quickly <br><br>As for the cheating angle, think of it this way: Bolt managed to smuggle a gun into a martial arts competition, and people are upset he is disqualified when it is discovered he uses it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I came back and checked it out after I heard about The Last. <br><br>I was right. I'm hopeful for the new gen, though. Might take a few good years to ruin them. <br><br><br>He only banned them from the exams, not wholesale. At least I don't think. Honestly it'd be a great support tool in an emergency. Cast a few freebies while you use the rest of your chakra intelligently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even better that some of those replies are from people who want this thread to die</br>  <br> Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world. <br>Yeah, the Big Five. The little villages are still probably fuming at their lack of representation.</br></br>  <br>Yes but that would actually take effort since I would have to look up what episodes are filler.<br><br>And it sucks when an episode is 90% flashbacks but there are one or two new important scenes in the episode.</br></br></br>  <br> Not to mention you have to ask yourself how these retarded no magic plebs are in charge <br>The position might be hereditary considering there general incompitence<br> How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show <br>Loyalty to Royalty?<br> Furthermore, if the ninja are all descendants of moon MILF <br>They're not, Tony Romo just gave everyone the ability to use chakra</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure someone has done it and you can just google it.</br>  <br>Fair enough. The Itachi Massacre retcon is a clusterfuck, but I guess in this case we were all too aware of every stupid thing that was occurring.</br>  <br>Why are Oda's emotional faces so shit?</br>  <br> Meanwhile, every other village is going to start training their kids with ninja gauntlets from age 4 <br>Forget that. In a world where any old pleb can suddenly cast a fireball, who needs ninjas? Get a couple thousand of the fuckers, put 'em in a straight line and tell them to bomb the everloving fuck out of whatever's on the other side. <br><br><br>Shizune is better.</br></br></br></br></br>  The filler arc is great and one of the best parts of the series.  Only time I'd say Naruto is good is when someone else praises SAO, I'd tell them Naruto is better than that shit.  <br> How are these fuckers mercenaries and not running the show? It makes no sense. <br>The best speculative answer to that is that they don't think it's worth the effort. Better keep the muggles 'free' and happily powering the economy so there's plenty of opportunities for them to make dosh hand over fist and have far more comforts when not on missions than your average peasant ploughing the rice field.</br></br>  <br>Oh, you poor, poor thing. Better not check the archives. There's dozens upon dozens of archived threads all about Nurudu. <br><br>And that's just in this month alone.</br></br></br>  Holy shit : I just realized WHY Boruto likes Sasuke as a master.<br><br>He doesn't treat Boruto like hot shit or expects him to be a prodigy. Sarada has to basically argue Boruto's part just so Sasuke will stay his master.</br></br>  <br><br>I see. It's kind of like pottery where he's the opposite of Naruto coming into the Chunin exams. Naruto had nothing to lose and everything to prove and he was at the bottom of the barrel. Burrito fears for proving himself in front of his father to get his attention and he's the prodigy of his class.<br><br>Kind of shitty of him to take it but then again his relationship with his dad is pretty shitty as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this little shithead kid went to the moon and fucked the bustiest chick in his village <br>Not gonna lie I just saw The Last and it made me feel</br></br>  <br>What exactly stops these people with guantlets from loading their beyblade yugioh card launchers full of really big jutsu and sneaking up on the hidden leaf village like a casual user and literally flipping the entire mountain and the village and the wall over on its head?</br>  <br>Worked slightly better when it was actually Oda drawing it. I think it's supposed to be a little fucked up and disturbing.</br>   Naruto actually fucked a vagina <br> For hours </br>  <br> Also the other villages aren't enemies anymore. They have regular meetings of friendship and are keeping togetherness between the villages as the highest priority in the new world <br>You mean like Kumo, who were spending their "peacetime" building a doomsday weapon and neglected to tell the other nations about it?</br></br>  <br>Maybe you shouldn't check the archives because it is all about you getting wrecked, Narutard.</br>  <br>kek, sounds like iraq<br><br> no guys I swear we aren't building nukes, just making free cheap electricity! </br></br></br>   Bee fucking DIES <br><br>Poor Bee, well hopefully his little halfie son will make a good container.</br></br>  <br> Sarada has to basically argue Boruto's part just so Sasuke will stay his master <br>It's a good thing she was stalking them and happened to notice the massively overpowered invisible Rasengan Burrito used.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck<br>No fuck this you're trolling me this isn't real<br>Wu tang forever</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares if they die, dieing stopped mattering after they brought everyone back to life and dead and back to life again</br>  <br>We don't really know the specifics of how the thing works, muggles/Lee might be incapable of using it.<br>Also it's a well established system whereas the device is clearly something new.<br>Should there be a revolution of some sort (Why against the ninjas anyway? If anyone's doing any oppressing it is the feudal lords and samurai.) you still have plebs with all the reflexes and aim of an out-of-job accountant, downtrodden peasant or highwayman, so power or no they would get fucking obliterated.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just another weapon, which will ultimately be useless against a trained ninja if you aren't one.<br>So what if you can now toss fireballs? You're not as fast, strong, or stealthy as a shinobi.</br></br>  <br> Forget that. In a world where any old pleb can suddenly cast a fireball, who needs ninjas? <br>Sure, for basic protection or traditional warfare. You still need ninja for covert sneaking operations.</br></br>  <br>Nigger, this entire goddamn movie is pottery. Pretty pottery. Well-made pottery, but pottery none the less.</br>  <br>He's alive in the epilogue.</br>  <br>Doesn't take a trained shooter to fire off a cannon</br>  <br> he fucked it enough to get not one but two kids  <br><br><br>If I'm wrecked then how is this thread still up?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love that sexy obaa-chan. She's serious when she needs to be and sweet when she wants to be.</br>  Man Naruto, you can TnJ a fucking Uchia out of going DARKNESS but you can't spend enough time with your kids to make sure they don't develop fucked up complexes about you.  <br> die <br>Nigger, please. Momo probably ripped out 99% percent of that shit and B used the excuse to go start a rap group.</br></br>   All these people who were hyped about Kakashi's face <br><br> No one genuinely interested in how Tsunade really looks after all the toll Mitotic Regeneration took on her body <br><br>I know she'll probably look really ugly and wrinkled as hell judging by the few panels we got of her arms but I still want to see what she looked like.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kek </br>  <br>Do you know how to operate a cannon?</br>  Isn't there supposed to be an announcement in a day or so? Do you think they're going to announce  more Burrito ?  <br>sorry I forgot the precursor<br><br>tippy top shelf kekaroony toony</br></br></br>  <br>They were fine until he became Hokage.</br>  <br> Do you think they're going to announce more Burrito? <br>It's on the 7th and goddammit  I kinda hope they do. </br></br>  Hey can any one tell me if this is a good idea, I watched the original naruto series up to like episode 90ish but got bored. I still want to experience the series however, I'm thinking about reading the manga and then looking on   youtube   for the fight scenes. Either that or skip around in the anime. What do you guys think?  <br>same way you operate a musket</br>  <br>    He also makes his son address him formally <br>I rather like that bit and wish there was more drama founded on something feasible for the characters.<br>It makes perfect sense for Naruto to demand proper decorum, yet he forgets that Bolt is fundamentally similar to him and how he used to treat both Hokages at his age.<br>Bolt, especially if he heard of his dad's antics, would think that this is stupid and nothing but parading authority to distance him further, feeding into his butthurt over Naruto having to spend so much less time with his family since having become Hokage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that the "secret" thing? Where are they revealing that at?</br>  <br> halfie son <br>please, anon, that kid looks like an octoroon at most</br></br>  <br>just read the encyclopedia dramatica version of it.

Pretend Asuna is out too. If you want more, read random fanfic--it's probably better.</br></br></br></br>  A good fucking laugh at how trash it is.<br><br>Watch it with some friends and laugh at how unbelievably stupid Kirito is or how the show slowly spirals into the worst animated show on the planet.<br><br>So bad it's good.

Typo?</br></br></br>  <br>It's a sao thing.</br>  <br> alicized <br>ehhh</br></br>  <br>expect deus ex machinas everywhere and for the gary stu MC to get the girl. Then laugh as the plot nosedives even harder because the author fucks up by rushing the plot instead of properly worldbuilding the only thing that had any promise in the series, which was the setting of Sword Art Online.</br>  <br>roll</br>  <br>What does that facial expression mean?</br>  <br>As expected of jew.</br>  <br>Mountains of incredible porn.</br>  <br>You clearly don't watch enough anime then.<br> You can start deeping yourself deeper to the shithole by watching Danmachi </br></br>  <br> Is that a... penis? </br>  It's not bad, though it gets progressively more fanservicey as it goes. Storywise it isn't too bad though, and while the characters are pretty generic shonen tropes the characterization and writing itself aren't too bad.<br><br>All in all, it's not a bad show. Not great, but worth watching imo. It deserves neither as much hate, nor as much praise it gets.</br></br>  <br> it's not bad <br> it isn't too bad <br> aren't too bad <br> it's not a bad show <br><br>SAO apologist please.

He went "edgemaster" on a sidestory that didn't make the anime.<br>One where he parties with another beta tester to clear a early game quest and the other guy just tries to leave him to die and get the loot.</br></br>  <br> He went "edgemaster" on a sidestory that didn't make the anime. <br> First Day <br><br>Wait, how?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>tbh that's gay af</br>  <br>Rell</br>  A decent amount of semen. I don't remember exactly how much, though.  <br>smh fam p rude imo</br>  I'm watching it again right now actually. Pacing is all sorts of fucked but if you're looking for something entertaining you're in for a good show. If you're looking for something to think about and dissect this really won't be fun as its a nightmare when you start thinking about it.  <br>oops</br>  <br>The Aincrad arc isn't bad but it gets a lot of hate for a lot of bullshit reasons.<br>Fairy arc is shit though.<br><br>GGO is bretty good and even a lot of people who hate Aincrad don't hate it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>boing</br>  <br>Surat Taha [20:14]<br>Indeed, I am Allah .

Let alone defeat him. And I’m not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. I’m not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either. Hell, I’m not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano’o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.  <br> battle shonen <br>wrong thread autist</br></br>  <br>Hirano is too busy with evil Jesus to make another Hellsing.</br>  I'm pretty sure that Enel can just create enough volts to kill all the souls in Alucard at once.    <br> name one character that could beat him <br>not<br> name one character from a slice of life or edgy angsty teenager drama show or entry level anime with less than 100 episodes that could beat him </br></br></br>  She gets some really OP cards by the end of the manga, also Clow could easily kill Alucard.  <br>Are his eyes towards his nose or something?</br>  <br> childhood rape <br>She's a bit late for that.</br></br>  <br>Mr. infinity.</br>  Inferno Cop.  <br>The explanation for Hellsing beating Alucard was Alucard wasn't as strong back then due to the Hellsing organization experimenting on him but his old form was stronk as fuck anyway so Van Hellsing was still likely a complete and utter badass. <br><br>But I sorta doubt Van hellsing being completely human since Anderson was a regenerator before he turned into that tree thing and alucard still considered him 'human' so it's all ambiguous.</br></br></br>  <br> Go to rape kiddy vlad <br> "This is a male only boyslut young woman, please try next mosque!" </br></br>  <br>Last time I checked vlad's desire was being beaten by humans (namely: You don't go monster mode. Regenerator is OK he knows he'll squish you easily. Going treemode is NOT Ok.) so he kinda and sneakily jobs.</br>  <br>It was like 4 guys who took down Alucard. <br>I don't remember if they were named.</br></br>  didnt the neko guy who looked like a girl made alucard disappear?  <br>I'm pretty alucard absorbed Schrodinger (Neko guy) and became omnipotent or some shit.</br>  <br>Didn't Integra's father beat him?<br>That's why he's loyal to the Hellsing's</br></br>    <br>*omnipresent<br>He is not omnipotent but has reality warping powers</br></br>  How can you kill something thats neither real or not real?  <br>Madara?<br><br>Are we talking about THE madara uchiha?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually while we're here, would Imagine Breaker do anything to a vampire like Alucard?</br>  Flash  <br>don't start this shit again in this thread.</br>  You can't "kill" Schroedinger Alucard because non-existence is a valid state for him <br><br>His offensive power is limited though</br></br>  <br>he can certainly beat him, but not kill him.</br>  <br>Imagine Breaker is exclusively defensive. Since Alucard has no passive barriers or the like, I would assume not.</br>  <br>what</br>  <br>Alucard has nothing to dispel. Imagine Breaker is useless against characters like him.</br>  <br> can't even make a penalty kick <br> beating alucard <br><br>lol no</br></br></br></br>  I wish I could dislike people to death. That way every faggot that starts powerlevels threads would be in hell by now.  <br>His son.<br><br>Its his destiny.<br><br> Integra is D's mom.

How fast? The world is a frozen puppet show and the Flash is moving every particle one by one.  <br> Nero <br>He only has 666 lives while Alucard has millions</br></br>  I mean Alucard is technically an Homunculus if you think about it (he can kill him the same way he killed Lust and almost killed Envy). <br><br>unless you're talking about Schrodinger Alucard who technically doesn't exist</br></br>    <br>Weakest bait of the year.</br>  Literally any character that can throw Alucard into space.<br>Jojo already gave the answer to how to stop immortal beings more than 25 years ago.</br>  <br>He exists as long he believes he exists. You could beat him if you talk him into thinking he isn't real. It could work as long he doesn't decide he should just attack you.</br>  <br>bobobo is always the answer.</br>  <br>Unlike Cars, Alucard could improvise propulsion in space from his millions of lives. He could just split off inner lives and throw them in the direction of his momentum to slow himself down and then eventually start propelling himself back to Earth. Schrodinger Alucard would just stop being in space and be on Earth again like it was nothing.</br>  MEoDP is the perfect counter to his immortality and given how much Alucard loves to give his opponents the first hit he's fucked.  <br><br>One Vampire killing vampire against another vampire killing vampire.</br></br>  Beat him in a fight? I can name several.<br>Kill him? No one comes to mind.</br>  Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Alucard?

Because he is now everywhere and nowhere at the same time so it's impossible to kill him post absorbing Schrodinger.</br>  <br>In the book it Van Helsing, Harker, Quincy, and I forgot the doctors name.<br><br>Doctor stayed with Harkers wife.<br>Helsing killed the three vampire girls who hung around Dracula (They didn't have a name, but you can call them the Brides of Dracula)<br>Quincy (An American) and Harker tracked Dracula down, Quincy &amp; Harker first hurt him by stabbing him and then finished him off by cutting his head off and putting garlic in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  maybe Tohno Shiki, definitely Ryougi Shiki.  <br>Naruto could talk him into accepting death if he needed to.</br>  Yugi could just challenge him to a shadow game, then if he doesn't follow the rules of the game he'll die.<br><br>And I think Master Roshi could beat him, the fucker blew the moon and can catch bullets.</br></br>  <br>Guts could do it. That sword has counters Alucards strengths</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Tohno be able to?</br>  <br>I doubt he's that easy to talk into losing his own existence.</br>  <br>His greatest desire is to be beaten by a human, so it could happen.</br>  Any touhou character actually  <br>Those tiny dots on his glasses look like eyes</br>  <br>Maybe.

Even straight girls and gay boys want to fuck Lala</br>  This episode    <br>Just like my shoujo manga.</br>  RL fan works are pretty much ded now.<br>Makes me sad.</br>  <br>Pripara confirmed irredeemable garbage</br>  <br>I wonder how the koreans are going to take PP.</br>  <br>That girl looks like a boy.</br>  <br>I've been wondering that for a long time.<br>The Chinese and Koreans seem to really like PR.<br> A part of me hopes it flops and proves the japs have shit taste. </br></br></br>  Oh come on.<br><br><br> Spoiler <br>Same here.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder /ai/  I couldn't watch aikatsu all day yesterday because of this    <br>It's better being like that than limiting yourself because it's a show for little girls.</br>  <br>They understand, too bad it couldn't save the series.</br>  Crossover when  <br> Tsubota: Everything isn’t Jin’s fault though. <br><br>JIN DID NOTHING WRONG</br></br></br>  <br>Kanon surely loves to ride Ruby.</br>  EVERY 1 IN 2 LITTLE GIRLS  <br>One in two girls what?</br>  I got to the end of Fancy Lala. The ending was bittersweet as these things usually are - but it felt like the show ended short. All that backstory could have been explored a little. Still, it was okay, but it fely like everything it covered was done so half-heartedly.  <br>Has a PP account.</br>  <br>/pc/ on suicide watch</br>  <br>one day /pc/ will become idols just like us</br>  <br> tfw Ultraman <br>Not surprising considering how shit Ginga was, but it's still sad.</br></br>    <br>Jeez why do they even bother with Ultraman<br><br>Also<br>  Power Rangers </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see PP there.</br>  <br> almost everyone who watched that show is here. <br><br>I'm not. I just saw the OP and got nostalgic. I'll go back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/pc/ now.</br></br></br>  <br>Momona is so cute.<br><br>Gonna finish Lady tonight. Or at least try to.</br></br></br>  <br>the last few episodes were a ride, I hope you enjoy it</br>  <br> yokai watch <br> that growth <br>I can't wait to see it crash and burn in burgerland.</br></br></br>  <br>And thanks to you it's almost.<br><br><br>Indeed, I doubt it would have the same impact it had in usagiland over here.</br></br></br></br>    Best support doll.     tfw we're winning   Just kill me now.    <br>Is time for despair?</br>  <br>Always.</br>  <br>http://www.e2046.com/product/Renjoj<wbr>i+Beru/23322/</wbr></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I have no experience painting figures.<br> Just gendums. </br></br>  <br>Same, but we need to try brother<br> I sure will </br></br>  <br>Truly horrifying</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/1lf85WJ1utA  [ ]<br><br>I'm afraid.</br></br></br>      I was very worried how the animation would turn out with a new animation director and one tenth the animators of a regular episode; they even cut down the number of in-between animators to two, not even Toei usually go that far!<br><br>The episode's animation turned out to be excellent (the still frames at least, I felt there wasn't as much movement as usual), and better than many other episodes with 30 animators.</br></br>  <br>Do big friend Japanese like PP, or is it just little girls?</br>  <br>Big friends and little girls like PP, while Christmas cakes and not-so little girls loved PR.</br>  ;_;  <br>People have been saying this for at least 2 years.</br>  Am I the only one who thought "AWAKEN MY MASTERS" at the end of PriPara 55?  <br>You and every other jap on twitter.</br>  <br>Are you actually looking up the credits in advance? It's not like there's any decent 2d in Aikatsu, except for some parts in S1.</br>  <br> Nothing decent </br>  <br>So damn hot.</br>  <br>why is this allowed</br>  <br>I want her to call me honey.</br>  <br>For Precure I keep quite good track of the animation directors and some individual animators, but for Aikatsu I only keep track of the scriptwriters.<br><br>In this case the animation director did character designs for some Precure seasons before and I wanted to see if his style came through (no): http://anidb.net/cr12911</br></br></br>    <br><br>It's nothing compared to this.</br></br>  <br>Miyabi's new look really suits her.</br>  <br>It's pretty bad but I've been so focused on the legs that I didn't even notice the exposed navels until this time around.</br>  <br>Exposed legs, navels, armpits. Nono has a kind of self-contained ZR that is amazing.</br>  <br>It's really interesting that they're putting in two new characters at once, both from the same place and with the same brand.</br>  <br>Looks like they want a slice of the bigfriend pie</br>  The second season lacks conflict.  <br>I don't like these, they look like extras. Those hair colors are too normal.</br>  <br> Aikatsu <br> conflict <br>This isn't PR</br></br></br>  <br>More of this is needed or my blood will turn to sugar.</br>  <br>Since when have aikatsus looked like such sluts</br>  <br>At least as far back as Mikuru</br>  <br>As of next season. But Spicy Ageha stuff has gotten close to Dolly Devil's level of lewdery.</br>  <br>Go rewatch RL.</br>    is aoi reset now?  <br>I weigh it up by watching the post-apocalyptic science-fiction dystopia ARIA.<br><br>A big problem with Aikatsu is that there is no grimderp backstory hidden between the lines: Nothing indicates the Aikatsu system is powered by Cthulhu or that it slowly eats away memories, Tiara does not seem to want to destroy Starlight Academy out of jealousy, and none of the characters are even beaten by their parents.</br></br></br>    <br>Nice.</br>    BDs never.  <br> We'll never watch the full performance of Over the Rainbow <br>Thanks PP.</br></br>  Akari.  <br>She will be my bride.</br>  <br>キュパコン when?</br>  <br>I'd rather have a Fuwari.</br>  <br>It's in the movie.</br>    <br>Does include Hiro doing Mugen Hug? This is important.</br>  <br>I want Akari to look at me with disdain.</br>  <br>Of course. I believe the performance in the movie has things that weren't in that special DVD.</br>  <br>Now I'll wait for the BD of the movie, I don't even have hopes for subs of it, unless a kind anon translates the PR parts.</br>    <br>I can stand her disdain, but not her disappointment.</br>   du du wa do it <br> ballet <br>why?</br></br>  <br>To show off the shiny new water reflection effects.</br>  <br>no wonder<br>was thinking of how it looked fancy as hell</br></br>    akari co. sucks dick at making hats  <br>Akari can't do anything right.</br>  <br>SHUSHUTTO SPARK!</br>  <br>Those look perfect to me. How else should strawberries look?</br>  <br>Ichigo gets off on humiliating her friends like that.</br>    <br><br>I never woulda've thought Aikatsu could deliver this level of sexiness back in the days.</br></br>  <br>Ran came close to those levels a few times.</br>  <br>Risa is just an evil looking Ran. Her outfit isn't all that different from Ran's original one.</br>  I'm gonna jizz from excitement  <br>Ichigo is already a strawberry</br>  litterally who  <br>I don't know why you guys are freaking out over their costumes. They're about the same level of exposing of the things worn before (just look at all of Ran's exposed belly in  )</br>  <br><br>Yes, but fishnets are sluttier.</br></br>      I need to know who the three best idols are for a business meeting.  <br>Shion, Kanade, and Snowflakes.</br>    <br>hello</br>  How are you planning to celebrate Aikatsu's 3rd Anniversary in October?  another yuru yuri thread  First for best ass.

I miss the fatties too. </br>    Sakurako is cute and I love her.  best cock  <br>best cock</br>  <br>Still prefer the initial designs for the most part. The chapters in the first volume also had a greater range of emotions displayed by each of the characters compared to latter volumes where they are more or less set in their own archetypes a bit too much.

Their shirts are different for some reason.</br>   you'll never hug your waifu from behind as she cooks you dinner   <br>You mean the little zig-zag pattern above the face? Yeah it seems kind of like an unnecessary change, but not enough to be that big of a deal. Are TYO's animator's afraid of animating zig-zags, you think?</br>    <br>All of them have changed designs except for Chinatsu. She has different sandals, though.

The whole OVA felt more like a SoL than a scene-by-scene comedy. I'm kind of worried about this new studio taking over the series.  <br>I really like the music, though. It is a shame how even the manga is more active. The OVA uses a lot of wide shots where they show an entire room, and everyone stands there.</br>  <br>Akane best sister</br>  <br>Muh nigga</br>  Here's another PV, not sure if someone already posted it before, I don't seem to find it, at least not in this thread.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=10&amp;<wbr>v=hXB79JRMKUM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>That's the OVA isn't it?</br>  <br>I think it's for the Nachuyami + OVAs coming this August. Well, in the video says the first one's coming on August 20th.</br>    <br>I dunno, it felt pretty comfy to me, which is fine for an OVA in my opinion. Is this same studio doing season 3? Not sure if that'd be the best decision.</br>  <br>Why isn't this a thing?</br>    Chinatsu a satan  <br>Can she be stopped!? Who will she rape next!?</br>  <br>Because tits are literally Himawari's only memorable feature.</br>  <br> ______Check under your bed_____ <br><br>But Akari doesn't have even that</br></br></br>  <br>but a cute satan</br>  <br>Exactly, if she did Himawari would be rendered useless</br>  <br><br>Does this look like the face of Satan?</br></br>  <br>But I want them to trade. Himawari can be useless.<br><br>Yes. You know devil is trying to tempt people and often appears in for of a beautiful maiden.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm surprised no one's ever done a joke where one of her fluffs came undone and there was a horn underneath.</br></br></br>  <br> beautiful maiden. <br>Well. At least we agree on that.<br><br><br>Don't encourage it</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> for you </br>  <br>Thumbnail looks nice.</br>  Just finished watching season 1, can Chitose and Chizuru die already???  <br>No, they are eternal</br>  <br>I don't think they should die but they definitely overdid it with Chitose's fantasies. She's the only one I don't ready like honestly. Chizuru isn't a big enough character to really care about but I don't like her much either.</br>  <br>This. They are the worst characters in the show. The only ones I dislike to be honest.<br>Ayano on the other hand...</br></br>  <br>I only dislike Chizuru. Chinatsu is an evil bitch but sort of relevant for character dynamics. Chizuru isn't just funny.</br>  <br> Chizuru isn't just funny. <br>Right, she's also an interesting characters that turned out to be plenty likable in the manga.</br></br>  <br> Interesting <br>She just drools</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking manga you stupid dumbass.</br>  <br>It's not like it contains huge amount of character development</br>  <br>Just do it you cunt.</br>  <br>I've read it, and it does not contain huge amounts of development</br>  <br>I'll show you huge amounts of development</br>    <br>L-lewd</br>  <br>Do it faggot, I bet the things shown do not feature a lot of Chizuru</br>  <br>  L E W D  </br>  <br><br>2genki4me</br></br>  So, did that anon draw Akari for her birthday?  <br>I like it.</br>    <br>Happy belated birthday Akari</br>    <br><br>I didn't know Hitler wore a crown.</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, that is shirt is the Genkiest thing I've ever seen.</br></br>    <br>In Kyouko's defense I like that shirt too  moreover because it was picked by Yui  </br>  <br>i'd wear it</br>  <br>weeb</br>  <br>yes, and?</br>  <br>It's bad for your health</br>  <br>It was obviously a joke don't be so uptight. We're all weeb here</br>  <br> not showing off your power level through clothing </br>  <br>I actually do but I'm sort of autist that's subtle about it</br>  <br> tfw little brother uses a t-shirt with his waifu on it and leaves the house with it </br>  <br>who's his waifu?</br>  <br>nep nep<br> at least he has good taste  </br></br>  <br>i want a nep nep shirt. where can i get a nep nep shirt?</br>  <br>your brother sounds like a chill guy<br>where'd he get the shirt from<br> i want a kyouko shirt </br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't really remember where he got it sorry</br></br>  <br>you're a disappointment.</br>  <br>anon you're a dissapointment</br>  <br><br>Hivemind aside you can literally have one custom made so why does it matter?</br></br>  <br>name 1 good site that lets you print anywhere on the shirt<br>and isn't fucking expensive</br></br>  <br>Fuck me if I know, but I have custom made shirts since the 90s and that's even before I had Internet. It shouldn't be that hard to find</br>  <br>doing it again tbh.<br>5am now.</br></br>  <br>Sleeping at night is overrated from what I hear tbh  3 am here, gonna stay up until 10am  </br>  <br>went to bed at 2pm yesterday. probbably the same today.</br>  Dancing on the corpses of her enemies  <br>I don't see how you can dislike Chizuru but not Chitose. She's just like her sister but with less appearances.</br>  <br> best girls fighting ironically <br>Truly the golden age of Yuru Yuri.</br></br>    <br> Chitose's face <br>What expression is this?</br></br>  <br>cummies</br>  <br>It's uncontrollable lust</br>  <br><br>Source?</br></br>  Ive been looking for rum raisin Häagen-Dazs to no avail. I need to taste it so bad.  <br>O-open up, anon.</br>  <br>th-that's lewd</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>I can never find it in the US, had some a few years back when visiting my grandma in China, I don't like raisins but it was delicious.</br>  <br>I agree, no one would ever want to knock her up.</br>  <br>Has anyone here ever taste it? <br>I mean, besides China.<br>I live in the land of the bean and I have never seen it. I can´t say much for the states because I only visit Arizona and California.</br></br></br>  <br>A-aaaaaaaah~</br>    <br>kaaari~~n</br>    <br>Can't even dress properly, she really is useless.</br>  E-Excuse me, Chinatsu?   HYPED FOR OVA 2!     <br>C-can we expect subs faster than nachuyachumi?</br>  <br>what an awful screenshot</br>  <br>I don't think we can, but we'll definitely release the WIP version.</br>  <br>Well that's better than nothing I suppose</br>  <br>What's more concerning for me is  we still can't find a .ts provider  for the OVA. It's been a while since I'm in the fansubbing loop.</br>  <br>I'm not really into the technicalities of fansubbing but what's a .ts provider?</br>  <br> Not posting the better version </br>  <br>Someone who captures "transport stream" files from Japan for us to use in encoding. It also gives me the freedom to use whatever encoding settings I want. Unless  you're all fine using Ohys-Raws. </br>  <br>I'm not in the habit of downloading and watching raws so I can't really comment on their quality and it's not like I can speak for every anon here but I believe most of us just want to see it as soon as possible</br>  <br>Well of course. Me (LL) and Bakkin will start as soon as we find a random raw and provide a WIP version for those who are eager to watch.</br>  <br>Of course as long as it's at the very least 720p</br>  02 is still canon edition    <br>He had enough in door to summer.<br>Probably the only time he's been decent.</br></br>  <br>Thing is Daisuke getting development would kind of make it more obvious that he isn't cut out for the role of leader, nor is he really useful.</br>  <br>02 he had nothing. Same with Miyako. <br><br>Honestly Hikari and TK should've been instead of him.</br></br></br>  <br>Miyako is a strange case in that she's better when she's in the spotlight, and the one episode where she is allowed to act like a character. However, I once heard a rumor that originally Miyako did have a different personality meant for exposition but then Seki wanted her to be more like Seki's idea of Mimi and Sora (keep in mind Seki thought that Mimi was a kogal and that Sora being a tomboy was just a phase).<br><br>Everyone was a better leader than Daisuke, even Iori.</br></br></br>  What is this face trying to convey?
