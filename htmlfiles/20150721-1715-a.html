Titor is a fraud.</br>  <br>Didn't he make some accurate predictions though?<br><br> And did anyone use his tripcode lately? </br></br></br>  <br>One could argue that he came from a timeline in which those events did transpire, but our timeline managed to avoid those through some major branches.</br>  Just finished watching Steins;Gate today, OP. Great series, you'll enjoy it.  <br>Don't discount time travel so readily, you troll.</br>  <br>The best has yet to come</br>  <br>retard</br>  <br>The fuck, when I watched it I almost dropped it when they started referencing all that bullshit.

It's gonna get better.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lYX<wbr>vo3w4_YE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> EVERYTHING WAS PLANNED. <br>Yeah, now that I think about it.<br><br> Geji-nee in C;H <br> time warps in the infamous essay in C;H <br> S;G uses VR Tech <br> R;N uses cast members of C;H and S;G as well as technologies of it <br> C;C is a direct continuation and those fucking Rikishi-Seals have been in Shibuya since 2009 in the real world. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was really, really slow and responded to that without looking at anything else in the thread.<br>ARG stands for Alternate Reality Game, by the way.</br></br>  <br> that much spare cash <br>They'd both be coming out on Vita and/or PS3. You can get either of those second-hand for cheaper than $50 now. It'd probably cost more for both games than it would a console to play them on.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit wait, Geji-Nee in C;H? The same one from R;N? I vaguely remember reading something about Geji-Nee, but it didn't seem all that important.</br></br>  <br>Are you unable to read the picutere?<br>Silverfish-sis -&gt; Geji-nee.<br><br>It was all planned from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Silverfish-sis", as seen in that anon's screencap, is a mistranslation of "Geji-nee".</br>  <br>Onoe naked in fetal position is something I need more of.<br><br><br>I wonder, how long will it take for Chaos;Child to get as much attention as Steins;Gate?<br>Or will it be forgotten like Chaos;Head?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some threads ago someone hint about di-swords' form factor.<br>Could they assume another form that is not a sword?<br>As I know, without having played C;C, is a result of an accelerated biorythm, usually originated from really bad situations and a sword is a form to hurt</br></br></br>  <br><br> It was all planned from the start. <br><br>For what purpose? Or does C;C explain it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you think smelled like an ARG?</br>  <br>Well, Rimi's Di-Swords look like an angel's wings.<br><br>So there might be some variation but it will always form a sword.<br><br> For what purpose? <br> To make money for 5pb. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaos;Head anime is still loved by casuals who know no different, and was pretty big for a while after it aired. Hopefully, Noah's official release will revive its brief popularity, thus shining light on C;C.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't aware that they could have other forms in the first place. Is that a fact or just speculation?</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but it's speculation, every Di-Sword we have seen thus far was, well, a sword.<br><br>With the exception of Rimi's, whose sword look like an angel's wings, as described by Taku.<br><br>He describes each sword in detail, and you can guess a lot of the character by the description of the sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just speculation.<br>If one can violently change biorythm by other means than torture, mental stress, trauma.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I figured that much. If Di-Swords are direct projections of the subconscious, then they'd reflect the wielder. I just wasn't really sure how much I could pull from the sword designs. Take Taku's for example, it could mean anything from being 1 dimensional and focused to not having any embellishments. Designed for a single purpose maybe?</br></br>  <br>It's unimportant now. Just a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Imagine a Gigalomaniac, who is sexually aroused to the max, about to fuck his girlfriend, unable to find a condom.<br>In his excited and aroused state of mind, he sees something at the edge of his vision.<br>He tries to grab it, and pulls out a  Dirac-Condom .</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what I should think about his straight and long Di-Sword.<br>I really have no idea what it could possibly mean, yet I'd like to think that it's the simplicity that makes it the best.<br>Maybe I can agree on your "single purpose" statement.</br></br></br>  Time travel exists, in that time dilation exists due to excess of gravity. Unfortunately you can't go back (from our current understanding of physics) but only forward from the present, you just age at a slower rate in the form of seconds to minutes.  <br> not   Dira-Condom </br>  <br><br>It's a sad limitation. What about light from stars and that sort of thing? Aren't they reaching us from the past?</br></br>  <br>Di-Sword is short for Dirac-Sword.<br>So, it should be  Di-Condom. </br></br>  <br><br>You're speaking of the Doppler effect. It's a good read, I suggest checking out the wiki page for if. It's technically not a form of time travel, just radial perspective as we move from the relative source.</br></br>  Anime onlyfag here. Hated Chaos;Head but loved Steins;Gate. Should I watch Robotic;Notes and wait for Chaos;Child anime?  <br>Chaos;Head anime was horseshit. Read the VN.</br>  <br>You should forget everything you know about Chaos;Head, then read the VN, hell read the VN either way.</br>  <br><br>You mean this?</br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag reporting in.<br><br>R;N started off pretty good but it slipped up near the end. It won't be nearly as good as S;G but it might still be entertaining for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed here, Chaos;Head's VN was a wild ride.</br>    <br><br>I thought the Doppler effect was related to sound? Or is it for anything wave based?</br></br>  <br><br>Please for your own sake read the VN. The anime adaptation of C;H is awful. The R;N anime was mediocre. Not great, but it ties some things together for Sci;Adv later on in the future so it's good to know about.</br></br>  <br>I think he means the name of a book</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppl<wbr>er_effect<br><br>Pretty sure it's this.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> giant Upa <br>Mayuri must be behind this.</br></br>  I fucking swear S;G fans have got to be even more autistic than any long running shounen. Fact  <br>How?<br>Purely talking about on 4chan of course, almost all anime fans anywhere else are autismo maximi.</br></br>  <br>how mad do you have to be to post this</br>  <br>Welcome to the sciADV thread, shiposter-kun!<br>Now get the fuck out</br></br>   I'd get infected if it meant living in bliss forever, who wouldn't?     <br>Shit, meant to quote </br>  <br><br>At least this roleplaying feels nostalgic</br></br>  I don't even like Rimi, but that goofy-ass smile she has here melts my heart.  <br>He knew what an IBM 5100 was used for before really anyone else did I think<br>But other than that his predictions were wrong, unless, by telling us what was going to happen he prevented the events he said were going to take place.<br>Who knows, its probably all bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>I love Rimi, she is the best girl.</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely watch Robotics;Notes. Just don't expect anything as amazing as Steins;Gate, but in the end you should enjoy it anyway.</br>  <br>Would you fuck Rimi? If so, how? This is a very important question pertaining to how much you really love her.</br>  <br> fucking your waifu <br>This has to be a trick question.</br></br>  <br>Of course the only way to fuck Rimi is to   give her a good tender hand holding.  </br>  I watched this anime and never knew the john titor thing was real. But this makes this post even more mind boggling   <br>I don't seem to get it, nothing of it will happen, what do you mean by that?</br>  <br>I just googled John titor, its a real thing. What the hell; I never realized those were real things. Welp, fuck. I thought you were just sitting me</br>  <br>The whole idea behind SciADV is taking real unexplained events/theories/tales and weaving them into a story.</br>   timeline stuff   <br><br> Not knowing about John Titor <br> Not knowing about the IBN5100 <br> Not knowing about C/SERN <br> Not knowing about Lifters <br><br>What have you been doing with your life?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you're from @channel.</br>     making signs for Japanese city level in a game <br> typing random shit into google translate <br> start using anime references <br> "Did you mean: El Psy Kongoo ? <br><br>THIS IS THE WILL OF STEINS GATE!</br></br></br></br></br>  As expected of the Committee.

Albeit a purple one.</br>  <br>Yusei has a burning soul for Stardust and his bike, Yuya for Yuzu and entertainment.</br>  <br>It's anime, so you gotta remember height is weird. He's probably only like 5'7" like Yusei.</br>  <br>That would mean the Yus are fucking midgets.</br>  Anyone playing with Greydles?<br><br>Are they as ayylmao as everyone says they are?</br></br>   Yuya is probably listening to Bonnie Tyler's total eclipse of the heart and Scorpions still loving you in his hotel room while clutching a picture of Yuzu in the fetal position while he cries   <br>Remind me, Kaito is the Galaxy-Eyes faggot, right?</br>  <br>When did Yuya become Shun?</br>  <br>They're like 5'3", so yeah they kind of are. Shun is probably somewhere in between Jonouchi and Kaiba though honestly.</br>  <br>Shun is probably busy listening to push it to the limit while he has flashbacks to Heartland, Yuto, and Ruri, that's probably what was going through his head during his duels with Sora, push it to the limit.</br>  <br> Shun is probably somewhere in between Jonouchi and Kaiba though honestly. <br>If he is the same age as Yuto and Yuto is the same age as Yuya then Shun is pretty high for a 14 year old</br></br>  <br>Shun is probably listening to Braving! and Challenge The Game.</br>  <br> Shun has Fusion genes <br> Sora has Xyz genes <br> Perfect explanation for why Sora is a manlet and the true reason why he liked Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon <br> Also explains why Shun cards people the way Academia does and why he trusts Serena even if she was from Academia. Even if she is a Ruri, she is the Fusion Ruri and should be considered worst girl in his mind.   Even though Serena is ARC-V's best girl. <br><br><br> Purple <br> Purple = Fusion <br> Armityle the Chaos Phantom is a Fusion Monster <br> Armityle is the combination of Uria (Slifer Red), Hamon (Ra Yellow) and Raviel (Obelisk Blue) <br><br>yfw Yuri (or Leo) has a Fusion whose appearance or effect is as retardedly bad as Armityle. The boss monster which was somehow inferior to the three monsters needed to make it. Especially when you look at the TCG/OCG Armityle.<br><br>At least the anime version of Armityle had this weird effect of giving itself to the opponent, then banishing every card on your opponent's field except itself, and then it returns to your field.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri's ace is probably Something Something Fusion Dragon, so it'd be safe to assume that the retardedly-bad-effect fusion monster belongs to Leo.  And to the entity that arises when the Yuyas finish eating each other .</br>  <br>Here ya go, everybody pretty much matched up, Kaiba/Jack obviously too tall to be shown.</br>  <br>The first word in the name has to be Violet.</br>  <br>been testing with it.<br>definitely broken as shit, main weakness is majespecters.</br></br>  <br>The space cancer kind of stunted his growth.<br><br>Reminder Haruto is 13 yet looks 8.</br></br></br>  <br>Shun is most likely Reiji’s age which is 16.</br>  <br>That little fuck is the same age as Yuya and all his friends?<br><br>Fucking what</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya is 14, but yeah, poor Haruto.</br>  <br>That would make Shun/Ruri twins if they were the same age. Shun is probably older, he's either 15, just before the cutoff of the Junior Youth, or 16, and Reiji was just like fuck it, Junior Youth for you instead of youth faggot.</br>  <br>I meant Yuma</br>  <br>Are you serious?<br>Holyshit</br></br>  Enmaryuuoh Red Daemon Calamity / Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity<br>Dark Dragon / Synchro / Effect<br>LV12 4000/3500<br>2 Tuners + 1 non-Tuner DARK Dragon-Type Synchro Monster<br>(1) When this card is Synchro Summoned: You can activate this effect; during this turn, your opponent cannot activate card effects from their field. Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. (2) If this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to that monster’s original ATK. (3) If this card is destroyed by your opponent: You can target 1 Level 8 or lower DARK Dragon-Type Synchro Monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that monster. <br><br>Kinda eh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still goes down like a prom date in front of Castel ;) <br>Konami please.

Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. <br>So can you chain Quasars effect to negate?</br></br>  <br> just not on the turn its summoned <br>Lets be real here, 9/10 times this card isnt going to make it through your opponent turn</br></br>  <br> Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. <br>No because it doesn't start a chain. Only way to stop it is to negate the summon.</br></br>  <br>So Solemn Warning/Rai-Oh/Stardust Warrior?</br>  <br>Reminds me of some boss from some Final Fantasy game</br>  <br> 2 tuners <br>  weak negation  <br> 4000 atk instead of 4500 or 5000 <br><br>above all else the two tuner requirement is what kills it. Poor synchros, they will never ever beat Xyz.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Space cancer pretty much froze their ages at 14 and 8.

Why not keep them separated and create gates from one to another so people can go back and forth. Thus making your world 4 times bigger and quadrupling resources instead of dividing them.</br></br>  <br>To rule them, of course.<br>Easier to rule dimensions if you only have to pay attention to one.</br></br>  <br>Can't manage 4 different dimensions<br><br>Better to combine all four worlds and govern one single body instead of going through the hassle of keeping track of all the shit and gossip and politics and teenage trends like playing cards while riding skateboards in four different dimensions</br></br></br>  <br> Wanting to rule an overpopulated world. <br><br>Enjoy famine and misery in your kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Fusion dimension logic, they think anything fused is better</br>  <br><br>So like since all the cities overlap, where would the people who lived in Synchro, XYZ and Fusion live when they enter Standard?<br><br>Will Leo just be like dunno lel I rule now thx bai?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The cities and various locations are obviously going to position themselves where they don't overlap, probably through some bullshit Spell Card Leo uses. <br><br>If the theory is true that each dimension was originally all together into one single dimension, they'll go back to how they were</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't the earth be 3 times bigger thanks to fusing the dimensions?</br>  <br>No. you're just overlapping them, you're not placing them side by side.<br><br>Currently the world is 3 times bigger because it's not fucking just 1 dimension.</br></br></br>  <br>that's how villains work!</br>    No really, what the fuck was her name?

She's a lot more relatable than any of the other characters and, in my opinion, is just as funny as anyone else.</br></br>  Is the show going to pick up where it left off during season 3 in that the characters will still be 14?

So are they gay or straight?<br><br>I don't like this show because I want to have sex with the animated girls in it, I watch it because it's funny and cute.

For example, your favorite yuru a shit.</br>  <br>Just because I use an Akari image, doesn't mean she's my favorite yuru</br>  is it just me or is it super cute when any of the characters try to speak english? I wish they would do it more often  <br>That line was so adorable I can literally recall it off the top of my head everytime I think of Himawari. I hope Himachan can get more moments like that in season 3, I always feel like she gets the spotlight less often than the rest of the main cast.</br>  Never forget  thread is dead, might as well post Yui      <br>The time loop is in the anime too, what with the school trip being repeated</br>  Chinashit  <br>chinachuuuu</br>  <br>literally worst character</br>  <br>Literally worst taste</br>  <br> stupid pink sex offender being your favorite </br>    <br>I honestly don't know what their names are, but judging by how much thought you put into your opinion it's probably a good one.</br>  <br>Also that one couple where one girl has big tits and the other girl is tsundere probably has at least 1 of the top 2 least interesting yurus.</br>  <br> I honestly don't know what their names are </br>  Mari-chan for president 2016  <br>A contender appears  but they can share </br>  <br> sharing <br>If you insist, but Mari gets 60% presidency</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Mari.</br>  <br>I hope you're not trying to imply that Mari-chan is planning to take advantage of Kaede's generosity.</br>  Awoo~  Why is this show getting slept on so hard? It's the best thing I've seen so far this season and all I hear is people are dropping it.  There's nothing interesting about it  My nigga.<br><br>Classroom Crisis is AOTS.</br></br>   spaceships <br> corporate intrigue <br> gar engineers <br> autism-chan giving no fucks </br></br></br>  <br><br>My fellow african american!<br><br>I like it, episode 3 is great.Kids gotta learn that money isnt that easy to get.How many are left?

The only major issue I have so far is that the opening episode was a complete mess. I'm glad it's finally picking up after episode 3, but I'm not surprised if it people dropped it entirely. It was a risky decision to go with a bait-and-switch, but it definitely didn't pay off in their favor (especially when an anime based on a manga gets more attention for doing a bait-and-switch of their own).  <br>Actually when I first saw it the first thing that came to mind was Creative Commons.</br>  where muh niggas at?  opm nigga reporting  Chapter 102 when  Will she win?  <br>thanks for reminding me. now im hype and will be let down knowing the chapter will not come any time soon<br><br><br>you can't just make best girl and not have her win</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really think ONE will include any romance. You'll have to wait on more doujin (though chances are slim)</br>  And thus it ended, it was a short, but sweet ride. <br><br>Can we discuss it?</br></br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  Fine, spoonfeeding this time<br><br>Magi no Okurimono</br></br>  <br>what is that?</br>  <br><br>Thats not how you start a thread OP.<br><br>Wasted thread.</br></br></br></br>  TELL ME ABOUT BANE  WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK  LOTTA LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>LOTTA LOYALTY FOR A HIRED SHTIPOSTER</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OR PERHAPS HE'S WONDERING WHY SOMEONE WOULD SHOOT A MAN BEFORE THROWING HIM OUT OF A PLANE  <br>AT LEAST (YOU) CAN TALK<br>WHO ARE YOU?!</br></br>  <br>(You)</br>  <br><br>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WE ARE, WHAT MATTERS IS OUR PLAN</br></br>  <br>NO ONE CARED WHO I WAS TILL I PUT ON THE MASK</br>  <br>IF I PULL THAT OFF WILL YOU DIE</br>  <br>IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL</br>  <br>YOU'RE A BIG GUY</br>  <br>FOR (YOU)</br>  <br>WAS GETTING CAUGHT PART OF YOUR PLAN</br>  <br>OF COURSE<br>DR PAVEL REFUSED OUR OFFER IN FAVOR OF YOURS</br></br>  <br>WE ARE TO FIND OUT WHAT HE TOLD YOU</br>  <br>NOTHING I SAID NOTHING</br>  <br>WELL CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GOT YOURSELF CAUGHT</br>  <br>NOW WHATS THE NEXT STEP OF YOUR MASTER PLAN</br>  <br>CRASHING THIS PLANE</br>  <br>WITH NO SURVIVORS</br>  Just one more day until the next episode full of girls after Darling's D.<br><br>Also japanese raws of ch35 never (or if some anon can find it).</br></br>    <br><br>Additional question. Where the fuck ARE the monster girl lands?</br></br>  <br><br><br> Talons are very warm and pretty soft <br><br>No they aren't. They are built for gripping and eviscerating prey.<br>They are also usually razor-sharp on any carnivorous bird.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's funny because that chapter implies "most" monster-girl species have already fully integrated into Human society and do not require homestays, the ones that are being introduced now are the weird outliers.</br></br></br>  <br>Id buy it.</br>  This is the only anime in the Anime of the season competition. It is literally proof of God existence. The greatest anime to be aired. It has plot,action, betrayal, saints, best girls, bunny.<br><br><br>Why aren't you watching the anime of our generation?Why...?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for bunny girl and now flower girl too.</br>  <br>His crap isn't even the focus of the damn show, you autistic fool. He does it to bait other warriors and draw attention to himself, the audience isn't suppose to be baited themselves.</br>  <br>woops meant to say liar<br><br>my question still stands though<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  How many volumes do you think the anime will cover, LNfags?  <br>MC is still cancer though</br>  WHAT THE FUCK IS GINTAMA AND WHY THE FUCK IS IT RATED SO FUCKING HIGH EVERYWHERE  <br> not being a huge weeb <br>Step up your game, mongrel, you are on /a/, not facebook.</br></br>  <br>At least she wasn't in denial.</br>  <br>I only read the VN where she's the least crazy and difficult girl to romance and clearly 2perfect4u.</br>  <br>I am more or less saying that you don't have to be one in order to get the jokes.</br>  <br> tl note to describe a james bond reference <br>literally FUCK</br></br>  ITT soft girls      <br>This is my favorite post in the entire thread Anon. You rock!</br>  <br>Muscle is important in moderation when it comes to an ideal female. It gives the softness shape, gives the plump and feminine appearance, and prevents the appearance of cellulite and to a lesser extent aging.</br>  Great and now the chubby chasers are here. It was nice while it lasted, at least.  Release of the next OST in summer<br><br>Vita game, KanColle event and Comiket in August. <br><br>Smile status: protected</br></br></br></br>  What is your favorite title given to you by your girls?<br><br> Shirei-han and teitoku-dono is pretty nice. </br></br>    <br>Totally normal human behavior kuma. Shame Kiso doesn't have a line about sailing the high sea and pillaging Abyssal convoys.</br>  <br>Shi-rei-kan<br> holy shit, text captcha </br></br>  <br>I want to gulp down an entire bottle of Yuudachi's piss!</br></blockquote>]
