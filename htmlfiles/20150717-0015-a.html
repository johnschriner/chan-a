Didn't Silat and pals break into Griffith's palace?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> COCK GOES HERE.png <br><br>back of the knee maybe</br></br></br>  Any news? The DVD is finally out.  <br>I just hope we get more police/FBI thriller anime, that genre is really lacking.</br>  <br>Damn, wonder how much this will sell. Can we expect EFP numbers at the least? Like around 70k?</br>  PP=GITS done right  <br>But we need more cute girls doing cute things anon! And harems of course or Idol anime #1999999</br>  <br>Do we know who's writing it yet? I hope it's either back to Urobuchi, or someone new. Just please not the S2 guy.</br>  YUGO A BUMBLEFUCK<br><br> goddamn fucking zefras </br></br>  <br>Caring for the main girl<br> Not best </br></br>  When the fuck did this come out?<br><br>WANTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</br></br>  <br>I actually don't mind Yuya sacrificing many things for the sake of Yuzu. Probably the compensation for too much homo in the past series</br>  <br>Wanting to protect your waifu and forsaking everything in the world to protect her are different. <br><br>I'm all for him trying to save or protect her, but he gives no fucks about anything else, Reiji and Crow both have told him to put a lid on it for now and he's still just MUH SADNESS, MUH YUZU!!<br><br>It took Jack calling his entertainment fucking garbage to snap him out of him for a little bit. Thank you based Kingu, his entertainment is garbage compared to yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NEVER<br>EVER<br>Tewart won't let it get released in the TCG, because he's got stupid ideas about iconic designs.</br></br></br>  shouldn't we have the technology to at least build a zaku by now?<br><br>My personal opinion is that if Steve Jobs had lived, he would have become a pioneer in the development of full scale fully operational mecha</br></br>  <br> just shoot the swords at them </br>  Mecha only exists due to the discovery of a new type of material which provides a massive amount of defensive capabilities, or force fields or other such mechanics which negate projectiles from non-mechs, such as AT fields, or just plot armor.<br><br>In reality our offensive capabilities will always vastly outclass our defensive capabilities</br></br>  tell me<br>tell me Composer</br>  <br>Even /m/ knows giant robots for military use would be stupid.</br>  <br> Some guy created a phone creating a mobile suit </br>  and another yuru yuri thread  <br>The manga has exhibited some character development. I just think Sakurako is always going to be limited by the fact that she's borderline retarded.  And Himawari still loves her. That's the love story of the century right there. </br>  <br><br>Of course! Noone can resist Sakurako-sama's charms forever!</br></br>    SakuHima love to brighten the day.  <br>thats just sweet.</br>  Only one day left now and remember Hibiki is not a hero.

They don't pronounce Gairaigo in English but in Japanese, which means you should considere it as Japanese, not English.</br></br>  When did we get previews last week?  js06 translated more shit, come see Touma being perfect.  <br>Plot armor.</br>  <br>touma is demonbane in normal highschooler form<br>thats the only explanation for this shit at this point.</br></br>  <br>Satan confirmed giving touma plot armor<br><br><br>fuck you satan</br></br></br></br>  <br>Satan please</br>   mfw touma is definitely gonna lose someone close to him now    draw a girl <br> call them a boy </br>  <br>Those threads weren't always so bad. It's like anons can't help but self insert themselves into every topic. Even NTR threads just dissolve into 3d shit that has nothing to do with my chinese comics.</br>  <br>Trapfags are more willing than anyone else to share their social media and pictures of their real life bodies than any other fanbase though.</br>  <br>That's a finer specimen of female, brotha</br>    <br><br>What is the problem with MAL? I use it keep track of my anime, is that bad? The only other way I can think of is some sort of spreadsheet program and do the same manually.</br></br>  Outside Umaru is undeniably the best girl.  <br>no</br>  <br>If I make her home made burgers better than any big mac, will she be my wife?</br>  <br>Only if your special sauce is better than the big mac.</br>  <br> girl's name is ebina <br> she likes burgers </br></br>    Episode 2 airs in less than an hour.<br>Who's ready for more of the comfiest show this summer?</br>  <br>The communist invasion has begun, run anon!</br>  <br>I think he's using vaughn</br>  <br>I hope this next episode will be as interesting as the previous.</br>  <br>Vaughn. It's streaming Wakaba now, but russian text is still in chat. I don't give a shit about chat though.</br>  <br>What if Taroumaru is already a zombie and that's why shovel is trying to kill him</br>  If Joseph knew that DIO wanted his blood,<br>why didn't he charge his blood with Hamon, since organic materials keep their ripple?<br>If he did that, he would have insta fried DIO if he tried to suck that blood dry,<br><br>You know what? Why didn't Kakyoin tell Joseph his plan to trap DIO in his stand, so he can pump Hamon in it? <br>Hell, why didnt Joseph try that rope trick he used on EsiDsi on DIO?<br><br>Did Hirohiko Araki want it both ways and have Joseph be around but not act like himself?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, and Kakyoin OVA version is plain bad...</br>  As cool as the Hamon was, the Stands are the coolest shit so I'm glad Araki discarded it. <br>It even makes sense in-universe: with the vampires and the pillar men gone, there is no reason to use the Hamon anymore.</br>  <br>Are there many from part 4? I only have this one.</br>  <br> EsiDsi <br>Dive headfirst into a woodchipper.</br></br>  <br> Jotaro <br> main character <br>Joseph had way more main character potential than Jotaro. So did Kakyoin. And Polnareff. And IGGY.</br></br></br>  Flat thread. Flat thread.  <br>On. /a/ calling virgins.
