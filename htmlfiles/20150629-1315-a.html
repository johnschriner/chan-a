I mean, your family is your family. I can't imagine just picking up and leaving like it's nothing.</br>   Yuru Yuri <br> Yuyushiki <br> Yuuki Yuuna </br></br>  Escaped Aquarius' water trap by drinking it up<br>-- Fuu needed to mankai out of it<br><br>Drove 3 Vertexes out of the barrier solo<br>-- Sonoko needed 20 mankais to do the same<br><br>Why is Gin so based?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was adopted by the Washio family.</br>  <br>That's what adoption means, /a/non.</br>  <br>Well, to be fair Leo is way stronger than any of the others.</br>  <br> YrYr <br> YuYu <br> YuYuYu </br></br></br>    <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>It's not the same thing though. Or at least it wouldn't be for me. Adoption because you have no family or they're dysfunctional and you can't stay with them is one thing. But, what, so you get a better standing in society? For a job? It's still bizarre to me. I'm going to chalk it up to cultural differences.</br>  <br>Happening!</br>  <br>You are likely to succeed if you try.</br>  <br><br>I finally managed to get the cat ver. in game so I could test it and fixed some mistakes and typos in the script, here's the latest version http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>9e5xceax56ffe6/script.dat.</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's a thing in pretty much every society except the modern day individualist West. A man of high status adopting someone as an heir, when the natural ones proved a disappointment, for example -- in those cases, the adoptee would often be an adult with a good track record. Like a CEO hiring in a replacement, really.</br>  <br>I'd hire them.</br>  <br> Drove 3 Vertexes out of the barrier solo <br> -- Sonoko needed 20 mankais to do the same <br>Based on what happened in the Vita game, Leo later fused with other Vertices and evolved to Cluster Leo (Nightmare form) so Sonoko actually had to solo at least 6 Vertices. Remember that Cluster Leo wiped out the entire Hero Club before they were able to trap it in the sealing ritual, and sealing function didn't exist back when Sonoko fought it.</br></br></br>  <br>Leo is broken.<br>I always wondered why that one in particular, is it because the Lion symbolizes kingship and power?</br></br>  <br> the adoptee would often be an adult <br>Yeah, but Tougou was 12 when she was adopted. I guess I'm just more sentimental than Washi.</br></br>  What if the teory about the returned offerings being parts of dead yuushas is correct and Karin last Mankai made her lose her taste and that's why when she met Sonoko she liked soy sauce gelato so much.  <br>She was around 10 years old, she said she was named Washio Sumi during the 2 years of lost memory because of sange.</br>  <br>That would explain why the recovery process took so long.<br>But it's most likely just us and Tougou overthinking again.</br></br>  <br>Karin didn't say she likes soy sauce gelato, she likes soy sauce udon which is pretty normal.</br>  <br>Karin said that she liked soy sauce udon in the first VN so that's unlikely, the soy sauce gelato thing with Sonoko was just a fanart.</br>    <br>Please tell me this isn't all.</br>  Cripple Homura did literally nothing wrong, preventing little girls being sent out as sacrifical lambs forever was sound thing to do.  <br>I clearly can't even with the timeline.</br>  I can't do it anymore.<br>I can't handle the wait.<br>These spoilers/partial scans are making me even more depressed.</br></br>  <br>it is just the last half page</br>  <br><br>I fucked up.</br></br>  <br>I know, I meant not everything he's gonna post.<br>Clearly I was too naive.</br></br>    <br>Do we have identification for which Vertexes were in each of the WaSuYu battles? -- some of the descriptions were fairly crazy, like the Visual Kei Vertex.</br>  Gloomy mood in here.  <br>IIRC they did say the name of eah one after the description.</br>  <br>These are the three Gin drove off.</br>  <br>What I'm meaning is, it was purely a matter of business on behalf of the adopting family. In Wasshi's case, getting a candidate Yuusha into an appropriately high-status family, for mutual benefit.</br>  <br>the image is from somewhere like twitter or so..</br>  <br>1st Battle: Aquarius<br>2nd Battle: Libra<br>3rd Battle: Capricorn<br>4th Battle: Cancer, Sagittarius and Scorpio<br>5th Battle: Virgo<br>6th Battle: Aries, Pisces, Leo and according the the Vita game Leo Starcluster</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And these are the ones from the final battle.<br>The middle one is a wrong illustration if I recall, as they've already defeated that one.</br></br>  <br>http://yuyuyu.wikia.com/wiki/Vertex<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Speaking of which.<br>What happened to Taurus and Gemini?</br></br>  <br>Too tired to translate this half page now but basically.<br> Tougou's the one who found the book, not Sonoko. <br> The diary was written starting from July 2015. <br>Last few sentences<br> So heroes already existed back in the old age huh... What a surprise, right? Yuuna. <br> ... <br> Yuuna, what's wrong? <br> ... <br> Yuuna? <br><br> AD 2015 30th July <br> Everything began from this day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand the motivation for it perfectly. But for me it's the fact that she never seems to miss her family. Or maybe it's just something that's never addressed. Hence what I meant about me being sentimental.</br>  <br>Apparently they are first encountered in episode 5.</br>  At the assembly of the gods...<br><br> Zeus: Guys, I've got bad news. <br> Krishna: What is it? <br> Zeus: It seems that a bunch of the other gods have have gotten together and decided to end humanity for being dicks or something. <br> General uproar among the gods <br> Odin: Whaaaaat? That's not cool, man. I like humans, I like watching them in the shower in particular. <br> Coyote: This fearsome news, Zeus.  <br> Jade Emperor: What we do? <br> Zeus: Well, if we merge our power together, we turn into a magical tree to create a barrier around one island and save the people living there. Everyone else is fucked. Now I know that you all probably want to save the people of your own cultures... <br> Krishna: Japan <br> Odin: Yeah, it's gotta be Japan. <br> Coyote: Japan clear choice. <br> Jade Emperor: Japanese people, master race. My Chinese people smelly and gross by comparison.  <br> Zeus: Okay then, so we're all agreed that the cultures we are from can all just go die, but we'll save at least some of the Japanese? <br> All gods: Agreed. <br><br> Takahiro: And that's how all the filthy gaijins died, and the only culture left was that of Glorious Nippon. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting.<br>Taurus' shape always catches me off-guard as we've seen so little of it.</br></br>  <br>Neat, I didn't even know we had a wiki</br>  <br>Even though the barrier is only around Shikoku, the world inside it is extremely huge, and the only way to leave it through the wall on the Seto sea.<br>I actually only noticed this recently, but Tougou mentions it during the final episode; that explains why they could still see the entire earth after chasing Leo's core that flew up above.<br><br>That could mean there are potentially still people living in other countries inside the barrier. The moment the tree formed, it might have saved most of the world's population unaware that they've been moved into an identical copy of their former world.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They say its only an island, not a continent. But the whole thing is incredibly confusing and inconsistent since its never clear exactly how much of humanity is still alive.</br></br>  I want a S2, if only for the fact that "Stardust Crusaders" makes me giggle.  <br>but there aren't many content in the wiki so please feel free to create new article and complete empty or halffilled sections there.</br>  <br> small but fast </br>  <br>Well, it's hard to imagine a tiny Island in Japan having all that technology while remaining self-sufficient.<br>I guess the tree's blessing is to be taken into account, but has nobody ever tried leaving the island during these 300 years?</br></br>  <br>Maybe some people did and maybe they were never seen again , as in they were eaten by the Stardusts. </br>  The location of where Nogi Wakaba were standing as described, photo taken and uploaded by people from 2ch  Itsuki voice actor's blog about nico live: http://s.ameblo.jp/kurosawa-tomoyo/<wbr>entry-12041357062.html?timestamp=14<wbr>35448527</wbr></wbr>  <br>*correction, not nico live, but the radio live report.<br><br>Also happy brithday for karin.</br></br></br>  <br> True Yuusha <br> Yumi is GOD <br> 80% Human <br>And that's all I can read, Tougou and Karin's are too small to make out.</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone know how many chapters this will be?    <br>Sonoko probably used her 20 mankais to go outside the barrier and destroy all the remaining vertexes. That was why they took another 2 years to attack again.</br>  <br> destroy all the remaining vertexes <br> any of the WaSuYu destroying anything but themselves <br>Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Much better.<br>From left to right, that goes:<br> True Yuusha <br> Yumi is GOD <br> 80% Human <br> YOU WANT TO KILL ME RIGHT?! <br> Juri-san wasn't our friend <br><br> I think I'm missing some sort of inside joke for the last two still </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the guy who obsessively edits the tvtropes page, I might give some life to the wiki since I have a week or so of free time.</br>  <br>Even Karin's VA is for bullying</br>  <br>No promises about the TL quality<br><br>The booklet is quite old, even looking at the censored date,<br>at the very least, it's from before the 99th year of the Era of the Gods.<br>And yet, how could such a Yuusha Record exist?<br>"Yuuna-chan, everyone, come here"<br>Tougou, calls the others before she gets confused on her own.<br>One of the Yuusha Club's 5 Tenets is 'If you're troubled, talk to someone'.<br>And so she showed them the booklet she'd found.<br><br>"Huh... I never knew about this book.<br>'Yuusha Record'... It's got the same name as my diary"<br>"So you're saying it's a diary written by a Yuusha?<br>Weren't you the first generation of Yuushas?"<br>"I don't know, but what's inside?"<br>"Whoa, that's a crazy amount of censorship"<br>"But look at this: The diary starts in July 2015"<br>"In other words, before the dawn of the Era of the Gods"<br>"Wow, my heart's racing"<br>"A concrete description that hadn't been blacked out - [text cut off]<br><br><br>Nogi Wakaba<br><br>"Nogi... Wakaba... My ancestor?<br>If they wrote the diary, does that mean my ancestor was a Yuusha?"<br>"Sonocchi, you're their descendant so you've got the same name as in the diary, right?"<br>"It's not a prank right? You look pretty surprised, Yuuna"<br>"..."<br>"Yuuna, are you ok?"<br>"..."<br>"Yuuna?"<br><br>30th July, 2015 CE<br>On that day, everything ----.<br><br> 'Yuusha Record vol 2' End</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 80% Human <br>What does it mean?</br></br>  <br>20% something else</br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br> On that day everything -- <br><br>God damnit</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if that 4koma chapter where Yuuna time travels and meets Wasshi and her team is turning out to be important...</br>  <br>I thought it was the other way around?</br>  <br>Oh yeah, my bad, it was. It's been a while since I read it.</br>  <br>So it had more purpose than to just generate cute Sumi/Yuuna fan art?</br>  <br>I have never wanted /ll/ as badly in my life.</br>  <br>So Yuuna seems to have entered in some kind of trance after seeing the dairy. Maybe Yuuna is having visions of what happened in NoWaYu.</br>  <br>During the nico lives they would all impersonate Togo's line to the vertex in ep11 in a really hammy way. Don't know about the last one.</br>  I knew I had at least one more Sumi/Yuuna image.  <br>Oh right.<br>That was the line she yelled at Leo to lure it into attacking the tree.</br></br>  <br>Imagine Yuuna giving a massage to young Sumi and Sumi then getting her first orgasm.</br>  <br>You know, Togo was one of the two, along with Fuu that recognized that she was having an orgasm when Yuuna was massaging her.<br>Itsuki and Karin didn't recognize it.</br></br>  <br>In my head I belive that Tougou started to masturbate after she met Yuuna and started to lust for her. Sumi was pure.</br>  <br>Massages don't just cause orgasms. It's physically impossible, unless your "massage" certain parts which I'm sure a bunch of teenage girls would never do.</br>    <br>Or your masseuse happens to be a god. Which is what happened here.<br>Yuuna's Godhand is one of the clues that she is more than human.</br></br>  <br> just the last page <br>What manner of cruel torture is this?</br></br>  <br>nice clit bump shadow</br>  <br><br><br>You people are forgetting that the official story is that everything outside Shikoku has been contaminated by a deadly virus.</br></br></br>  <br>If people can get off solely on nipple play, I don't see why you can't get a similar effect with other parts of the body. Do you even know how orgasms work? Bodies aren't machines that only turn on with specific power buttons.</br>  Has season 2 been confirmed?  Why do you like Christmas cakes, /a/?  <br>You know I do!</br>  <br>I sure love dem.</br>  Can relate to them.  How is she so fluffy?    <br><br> Christmas cakes <br><br>Aren't they only about 22-25? I'm reasonably sure that a Christmas cake properly is someone 30+, a woman in her mid-20s is generally the ideal woman even if retards obsessed with virgins are determined to insist teenagers are best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>all day errday</br>  <br> Not knowing why it's called Christmas cake </br>  <br>If I ask why, will you accuse me of wanting to be spoonfed? I always assumed that it was a term referring to older women, and that referring to 20-somethings as older was just people being retards.</br>  <br>A-am I being detained?</br>  <br>More Kaede</br>  <br>Of course I do.</br>  <br>Christmas Cake: they're called because they're "no good after the 25th". So technically any female character 25 and older falls into this sweet spot.<br><br><br>also, more cake!</br></br></br></br>  <br> All those hags <br> I wanted them all. </br></br>  <br>The Google exists Anon. Use it.<br><br><br> A-am I being detained? <br>With a single shackle around your finger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Christmas cakes are unwanted after Christmas Day, the 25th. Women undesired after the age of 25 are Christmas cakes.</br>  Kinda have too.<br><br>Desperate Christmas Cakes are pretty much all i'd ever be able to get if I find anyone at all.<br><br>I'm not someone a person longs for, i'm someone a person chooses once they believe they can do no better. I am someone that can only be settled for, 23rd best.</br></br></br></br>  Because they're desperate, and willing to settle for me.  Uniforms and juiciest bodies ever.  Because if I was a woman I'd be a Christmas cake and I prefer someone close in age to me rather than someone too young  Why do I still consider them to be "older women" when I'm 25 myself?  <br>Because they tend towards large chests, which I find attractive. And teasing ara ara~s</br>  funny that around the Edo period, 18 year-old women were considered "running out of time to get married"<br>wonder what they called them back then?</br>  <br>Men don't get old, just more resourceful.</br>  <br>because you're not seeing them as older than you, they're "older women" because they're women, not girls<br><br>also<br> You will never have a wonderful Office Lady cheer you on while jewing everyone else in the known universe </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because /a/'s average age is rising and thus their preferences are shifting to older women.</br>  I`m 30 years old, so christmas cakes are relevant to my age. And we need more these girls in the anime.  Office Lady Tsunade, muh dick.  Because I sympathize with their low self-esteem and also find their purity in sexual matters despite their real world experience to be endearing and charming. Also it plays in with my fear of abandonment when most women their age are looking for serious relationships and don't want to fool around any more.<br><br>But it doesn't really matter, they don't exist and probably never will.</br></br>  <br>why would getting older change your preferences in women? Do 80 year-olds fell that women under 75 are too young for them?</br>  Do japs actually eat cake for christmas?  <br>oh fuck god yes they do<br>Christmas in Japan is for eating cake and chicken and staying in a hotel with your bf/gf</br></br>  <br>Not him, but your perspective does shift a little. For example I have a friend whom I've known for a decade, but if I was shown what she looks like at 26 when I was 15 I'd probably see a few flaws, but at the same age as me she's attractive. <br><br>3D aside, does that make sense?</br></br></br>  <br> Christmas cakes are now my peer group <br><br>I guess I can't call it a fetish now. It's more like natural grouping.</br></br></br>  <br>Except for the not-so-few groups of devout christians in the dense population of millions of shinto-buddists, they don't celebrate X-mas the same way/for exactly the same reasons MURRICA does.<br><br>also <br>it's more of a "have fun with friends" celebration, giving gifts  and if you have a special someone, having sexy times with them because why the fuck wouldn't you <br><br>New Years is more the family type get together celenbration time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Going on onsen excursions with Kaede!  <br>Hugh Hefner, still the best 2015</br>  How do Japanese turn every religious holiday into an excuse to le sexy time yet STILL HAVE A BELOW 1.6 BIRTHRATE??<br><br>Oh right, their condoms are pretty high-quality.</br></br>  <br>He is going to kick the bucket one of this days</br>  <br>Did someone say onsen?</br>    <br>Everyday with Kaede!</br>  <br>10/10 would eat valentines boozechoco with</br>  Cakes are one of the many reasons why Im@s is superior to love live. In addition to sexy over-18s/cakes, they also have  delicious middle schoolers  as well.  <br>But that will only make Stan Lee stronger</br>  <br>Is it worth picking up IM@S for Kaede? How is Cinderella Girls compared to the first season?  The not mecha one. </br>  <br>I would also say the stigma on abortion is pretty non-existent, like Russia<br><br>The only thing keeping black America from plummeting into negative growth is the black preachers shouting about how abortion is murder, and they still end up aborting about 1/3 of their pregnancies</br></br></br>  <br>Easier to relate to, they feel more attainable. I don't think anyone would turn down a younger woman, physically speaking. Older women are more mature.<br><br> Then you get one and find out that's a myth and all women are fucking psycho. Christmas cakes are going to be more forward about wanting the D tho on average. <br><br> Also them delicious tits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'll never lick melted chocolate off of that 25yr old body. <br>Unfair is life.</br></br>  <br>Would it be wrong to call middle schoolers "cupcakes"?</br>  <br>More women need to be on long term hormone control<br><br>Birth control changes their chemicals and condoms are not preferred by intimate couples<br><br>Only by cumming inside can you calm women down, and by cumming in their mouths you can make them more feminine</br></br></br></br></br>  They're all wonderful but unappreciated.  <br>At 15 you're too horny to see flaws in anything<br><br>Getting into college-age you begin to appreciate the fact that most girls aren't as hot as you used to think</br></br></br>  <br>This anon gets it.</br>  I want to tell a christmas cake that I'm about to cum inside her as she physically and verbally resists but secretly wants it oh so bad so her resistance is half-assed and she orgasms at the thought of getting pregnant with my seed  <br>My nigga</br>  <br>if you watched the 2011 im@s series, you already know it's an Idol show, so it's basically a slice of life with cute girls doing cute things with good music, nice dance routines and some drama (because it it cant always be SOL all of the time)<br><br>Regretfully, there is very little Kaede (or other cakes) in CG, since it focuses on the Cinderella Project girls (Rin, Uzuki, Mio, Minami, Anya, Ranko, Chieri, Kanako, Anzu, Kirari, Miria, Rika, Riina and Miku), with support of their Producer (the aformentioned TakeP) and the delicious Office Lady Chihiro.<br><br>Cinderella Girls is a new idol project in the same universe with a different group of girls scouted by a 346 productions (a better funded and more established than 765pro).<br><br>It DOES has about the same amount of base characters with a TON of cameos and easter eggs for the mobage fans.<br><br><br>25+ christmas cakes<br>20~25 various assorted non seasonal cakes <br>18~20 cupcakes<br>14~17 various assorted bread based confectionery<br>8~14 cookies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers for the rundown. Presumably there'd be a few episodes with a Kaede focus?</br>  <br>Yeah, however she dressed like a Mormon (because she is one) and still does but now it's not a factor. Those wool cardigans are just all part of the appeal.</br>  <br>I don't think it's actually rising, there's just actually people who have browsed 4chan since early years still around. Average 4chan user is still the little 16-23 year old pissant but old timers have become a thing as traditions and national character develop.</br>  <br>So would 0-7 be cookie batter? Y'all know cookie batter is more delicious than cookies.</br>  <br>Also unhealthy</br>  How easy are cakes?  The bigger question....<br><br>Does /a/ like /ss/ with Christmas cakes?</br></br>  <br>Kaede is more the established idols (in universe) and quite possibly one of the flagship idols for 346 and a bit of a role model for the newbies along with the Happy Princess (Mika, Mizuki, Mayu, Miho and Akane). <br><br>Considering her VA was pretty busy last season, she got a couple of scene in the first season. <br><br>A lot of us MapleFags are hoping to get more puns from the punmistress during S2, but we're not keeping our hopes up since Scamco has their agenda to keep and they seem to want to push Rin really hard down the fandom's throat.<br><br><br>I may need to ammend that list<br><br>25+ christmas cakes<br>20~24 various assorted non seasonal cakes <br>16~20 cupcakes and fancier sweet breads<br>12~16 cookies, biscuits and confectionary<br>8~12 cookie dough<br><br> img captcha cake </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there anything that could defeat Stan Lee at the moment?</br>  <br>How can Kaede still be a cake? She is absolutely perfect in everyway, how does she not have a boyfriend? Is there something that she does that turns them off?</br>  Will Kaede get her own OVA?  Do cakes become milfs the instant they get married?  <br> Ex model turn full time idol <br> calendar scheduled with events <br> IDOLS MUST BE PURE, NO BOYFRIENDS <br><br>being a cake idol is suffering<br>but nothing like a drepressant to keep the blues away</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nope, still cakes until they have a kid<br>like pic related</br></br>  <br>She's got producer so all the guys stay away.</br>  <br>Because I want to be spoiled and loved by an older-sister-type?</br>  Why the fuck am I even a cool P? I literally do not have a single cool card worth using. Every fucking card I get in events/gachas is passion/cute. In top of that, they're usually the cutes and passions I don't even like. It's as if the damn game is actively trying to troll me.  Cakes, MILFs, and tomboys are a best  <br> Christmas in Japan is for eating cake and chicken <br>Did someone say chicken?

So basically 8man regrets that he's such an alpha and all the bitches are fighting for him. Hot damn I never wanted polygamy end to happen more than this anime.   However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br>Is this because it is embarrassing to admit she likes the club or has friends? Or is it she says "love" or "fond of" or "like" to Pan-san about 8man?</br>  <br>geniune spaghetti moment</br>  <br>"wait don't leave I'm literally incapable of functioning by myself"</br>  <br> Are you leaving me alone with that creep? </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127314140 <br>It isn't.</br>  Last episode explained for non autistic anons<br><br> the real thing <br>this is a common juvenile thing. to understand it, read catcher in the rye. the author of this manga/anime probably did as well.<br><br> what was their conversation about <br>yui realized that yukinon is also in love with hachiman. both hachiman and yukinon also realize it. if one of them confesses, it will end the friendship the three of them have, and nothing will be like before.<br><br>as for "the real thing" in this scene: yui actually wants to force the confession, that's why she gave hachiman the home made stuff. she knew then yukinon would have to act on it. that's why yui said that she's not actually a good girl. hachiman realizes this and says he doesn't want a forced confession/forced progress of their relationship this way, he rather wants to play it out naturally (as in real).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read catcher in the rye. <br>Haaa i never would have seen the correlation, this is a smart anon here.</br></br>  <br>I think he knows that them showing their true feelings may drive them all apart. He is aware of the love triangle on that level and he knows he won't be able to choose.</br>  <br>Okaeri</br>  Iroha sexy sounds<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/lktgdfbcbf.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>    poor spyro  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>There's no need to prove it wrong outright, as it simply not being a universal fact makes Iroha end a strong possibility.<br><br>However, there are some of the big hints against it. First is the fact that Sensei herself is a lonely christmas cake, meaning she doesn't present a strong authority in terms of interpersonal relationships. Second, 8man himself makes an argument against her ideology and she doesn't give him a satisfactory answer, that's kind of a big deal for what is supposedly the central message of the story to have been questioned and to leave it completely unaddressed.<br><br>The third, and probably biggest, is Komachi. Komachi is closer to 8man than anyone else and is his biggest source of positive influence, not Sensei. She has pretty much operated independently of this struggle-for-genuineness deal. She's even assisted in "non-genuineness" by becoming a mouthpiece for 8man's desires when he couldn't voice them.<br><br>If Watari decides to go for a more positive final message than Sensei's "you need to struggle or it isn't genuine", then it will in all likelihood center on 8man's relationship with Komachi. Likewise, this would be very good for Iroha as she's the heroine most likened to Komachi, and of course this also ties in with how she's managed to get along with 8man compared to anyone else in the series. (As when he's with her he often acts like he does with Komachi.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he read a book I also read before <br> he must be smart </br></br>  <br>Look at all these worthless stone cutters.

At the same time, 8man is in his second year of high school. In four years' time, he'll be a second year undergraduate at a university. Again, I don't know much about the education of the elevens, but he would be a teaching assistant at best, shadowing Hiratsuka-sensei at worst.</br>  <br>No, you trained your mind to engage in mental self masturbation.

The only way to keep the club together while reaching genuine is for one of the girls to essentially kill herself inside or for 8man to choose neither. Choosing neither leaves Iroha to find genuine with him.<br><br>Unlikely but not impossible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> komachi won't pass <br> Iroha will have personal issues of her own and it's really affecting her <br> the club continues to be broken <br><br>8man is going to suffer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because she wants the same thing. His wish resonated with the real Yukino. The one she's struggling to find. That fact that she has feelings for him also plays a role in it too perhaps. But I think more so it is personally significant to her. It touches on what she really wants herself, when you consider her past. <br><br>She's struggled to make friends, boys who approach her are just in love with her, girls are jealous of her, etc. She can't find her real self and keeps following the shadow of others. So you could look at it as she's struggling to find the "genuine Yukino". Which would if she obtained that also fulfill Hachiman's request.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Coma cheese </br>  Thank God now you shitters can finally stop ruining the board.  <br> commie </br>  <br>itll never change man why even try its slowly becoming the new /pol/</br>  <br> Yui turns out to have breast cancer <br> it was discovered too late <br> She confesses to 8man on the day she dies </br></br></br>  <br>Cry more, faggot.

No the suffering is not positive.

And no, before you even try, just saying "it's related to his relationship with Komachi" doesn't count even as a faint inkling. <br>"That doesn't count" isn't an argument.

Growing up, people never cared for her as much as Haruno (she was always 2nd fiddle), boys who got close to her did so because they had feelings, girls kept on betraying her, Hayama failed her. <br><br>So she fabricated the ice queen personality to cope with her issues. But even bearing in mind, growing up as a kid she had to cling onto Haruno and Hayama because like it or not they were all she had. So she became dependent on them. During this time, she probably developed the idea that she hates superficiality as well since nearly everyone she "knew" never treated her correctly (guys getting close because she was pretty for example). She made the club in order to change people supposedly (but what she wanted to change most was herself)<br><br>FF to beginning of the series. She meets hachiman and they immediate quarrel for the first few volumes (keeping the ice queen persona intact). Things start to break when Hachiman first meets Haruno and he sees right through her. This is important because its the first time she starts warming up to him since there might be someone who understands her and her beliefs-that superficiality is bad (also he won her Pan-San in the same volume so it was a double whammy for her heart)</br></br></br></br></br>  Technically, Miura wants genuine too. Vol. 10 made it clear. She just wants it with the wrong person for that.  <br> Imagine Breaker'd me so hard <br>I'm not even a Yukinofag  Yuifag , <br>but seriously how dare you call yourself a Yukinofag if you can't even like her for who she really is?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha somehow hears that they're going to the aquarium <br> Decide it's a good time to update senpai_blackmail_list.xls <br> Now that's alpha: Yui version <br> Round 2 of the genuine thing <br>What would her face be like?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not even bad compared to the worst of Yahari threads.

There are hundreds of websites for you to talk about your retarded opinions in a "positive" atmosphere. So why the fuck do you keep posting on /a/ when no one obviously gives a single shit about you? No one wants a hugbox here.<br><br>Wear a plastic bag as an astronaut helmet please. Fuck off already.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She probably had some feelings by Kyoto trip and people started questioning her relationship with hachiman. Shit hit the fan with Ebina confession hough because the image she had of Hachiman was shattered (i thought we both didn't like superficial things). This hurt because she thought she knew Hachiman and thus their relationship wasnt "genuine". Stuco arc added more fuel to this fire when he stopped her from being prez (I thought you'd understand) and culminates in her telling him to stop coming to the club in order to stop, what she thinks, is a nongenuine relationship between them<br><br>Genuine speech came, renewed bond between them, and now she finally opens up her "real self" which is currently this dependent moeblob of emotions. Her feelings to him also balloons into love but she has no idea how to act (Haruno mentions this several times in the series)<br><br>So she's searching for something genuine for herself (to change herself) and for Hachiman, probably the only person that she has a deep connection to outside of Yui. <br><br>This genuine request he asks them is also the one thing she feels connects the club as a whole (and her to him) so she is desperately clinging onto it <br><br> Even so, there is something like an answer for us, so I decided to vaguely think of it as the right one. <br> I don’t mean that half-heartedly, because I’m thinking of it as a prerequisite for the answer that should coincide with all our interests. <br> I want to believe that is genuine. <br> Because I can’t believe in anything else beyond that, or even in myself. <br> <br> In truth, I was just being dependent on it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like with 8man he had expectations of her and he can't handle it now.</br>  <br><br>Probably,<br>  I really need to start having these sort of heartfelt emotional moments with senpai or else I'm gonna lose this thing. </br></br></br>  <br>I like the part where some anons think yahari threads are better</br>  <br>Nah, she has the chemistry on her side. Chemistry is unbeatable.</br>  <br>Congratulations you win one point on my misuse of "burden of proof"<br><br>So let me try to put together some concrete proof. Superficiality within the story is depicted as ignoring or hiding inconvenient feelings for the sake of preserving a status quo: this is Iroha's behavior to a T. While she might feel out a new tiny factoid about 8man here and there, she is ultimately held back by whatever logic drives her to conceal her real desires behind excuses about StuCo work and winning Hayama over.<br><br> The story hasn't reached it's resolution, so a new ideological development wouldn't be out of the ordinary. Just because something works on some level doesn't mean it's perfect. <br>Baseless conjecture. There has been no evidence within the story that the struggle for something genuine is anything but positive, and everything about not being genuine is always depicted as a negative. The main characters have shown rocky but positive growth following this course so far. "It might happen" is no foundation for expecting the story to change course so trastically<br><br> And as I said, you have no backing to that claim. You don't even know Iroha's real motivations for asking the questions. <br>It's quite clear- she wants to know more about 8man. The problem is that almost everything she tries to find out about him is through some flighty question about what he thinks Hayama would like.<br><br> Someone who makes claims about the main theme of an unfinished story really has no room to talk. <br>At worst we're equally wrong in trying to draw conclusions about an unfinished story, but that doesn't mean I don't have the preponderance of evidence behind me about what the theme is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's only shallowness.</br></br>  <br>I've only read the Saekano LNs, so I'll only judge the anime, but Saekano is way better than Yahari. More convincing drama, better comedy, and most importantly, way better girls.<br><br>Yahari S1 was passable, but S2's last episode sealed it as trash. Also, Yahari's fanbase is way worse than ours. Look at how they have a 24/7 general that just screams of MAL and reddit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is she talking about the genuine request itself at the end? Or a specific idea of hers for what genuine might mean that she's clinging to?</br></br>  <br> better girls <br>I laughed. Nice bait.</br></br>  Goodbye shitpost general  <br> ignoring or hiding inconvenient feelings for the sake of preserving a status quo <br>If that's the case then Iroha isn't superficial at all. She's actively trying to get into 8man's pants after all.</br></br>  <br>8man constantly getting flustered and his heart pierced by her is shallowness? You sound bitter.</br>  <br> posting the worst Yahari girl <br><br>Right back at you.</br></br></br>  <br>she is the best right now, but saying that she is better than Megumi is laughable</br>  <br> worst <br>Want to know how I know you have shit taste? You like Saekano and think the sly kouhai is worse than recording shoegazer.</br></br>  <br> Saekano <br>Megumi<br>Utaha<br><br> Yahari <br>Yui<br>Iroha<br>Sensei<br>Orimoto<br>Saki<br>Miura</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same guy, but do you genuinely believe that Iroha can win the 8bowl?</br>  <br>Everything in the story is proof. Hayama's clique is not genuine- they despair at the slightest thing shattering their relationship. The way the club behaved after the StuCo election wasn't genuine- things very nearly fell apart and poor Yukino was convinced that 8man had grown to dislike the club and tried to offer him an out. Yui's proposal at the aquarium was not genuine- part of her wanted to be able to live a pretty lie rather than face the truth, but even she knew deep down it was the wrong answer.<br><br>One of the very first developments we see from Yui is that she reveals she respects Yukino for being (apparently) so straightforward about everything, and she wishes to emulate that- genuine as a positive ages before volume 9. The genuine speech itself is indicative of the fact that the three of them hold the others in exceedingly high value- so much so that they are willing to make efforts to be more honest, and their friendship is saved. The aquarium- 8man rejects Yui's proposal and reiterates Sensei's words. They all gain the resolve to do more than hide behind a pretty lie, solve their personal problems and face the truth of their feelings for each other.</br></br></br>  <br> think the sly kouhai is worse than recording shoegazer. <br><br>I really hope you aren't implying she's better than Megumi.</br></br></br>  <br>why is Izumi not on your list?</br>  How would volume 12 8man answer?  <br>She's forgettable, but even if you include her Yahari still has the advantage.</br>  <br> She's my favorite side character </br>  <br>It was my understanding that Saekano was just a giant pile of memes and 4th wall breaking where all the girls loved the MC for no reason at all.<br><br>Do you mean to tell me that the girls are actual characters and not just spectacles?</br></br></br>  Man Irohabros used to be cool when they are not denial.  <br>Expected the worst, hope for the best</br>  <br>Kyoani should anime shit like this.<br>Imagine the quality of euphonium into this, much more attention to detail, better facial expressions, etc.</br></br>  <br>Can?

The shit moon that is Yukinoshit has eclipsed the brilliant sun of 8man's justice and Iroha's sly.</br>  <br> There has been no evidence within the story that the struggle for something genuine is anything but positive <br>Yukino's current state is so bad that her family, which is usually hands-off, felt the need to become personally involved. This is the direct result of 8man and Yui's actions.<br><br> The problem is that almost everything she tries to find out about him is through some flighty question about what he thinks Hayama would like. <br>Wrong. On their date Iroha stresses doing things that 8man wants to, and eating where he likes to, over things that Hayama would do.<br><br> but that doesn't mean I don't have the preponderance of evidence behind me about what the theme is. <br>You have nothing but the statement of a lonely woman which has literally been the single biggest source of conflict in the entire series.

Yukinoshita knows this (hell she even told him the same thing ing Vol 9) and she knows the consequences of her answer being wrong but she has no other choice but to cling to it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wrong. Komachi has been non-genuine on at least one occasion, and Komachi is the single most positive character in the series. <br>Remind me of when she wasn't being genuine?<br><br> This statement is just laughably wrong. No the suffering is not positive. If the same genuine end could be achieved without the misery and tears the club has gone through so far then you would have a strictly better process. <br>Your "strictly better process" is impossible. The same "genuine end" couldn't possibly be achieved without misery and tears because genuine is fundamentally about being honest, and sometimes honest feelings will lead to someone getting hurt.<br><br> "You don't need to struggle for it to be genuine". <br>An empty platitude with absolutely no foundation<br><br> That doesn't count" isn't an argument. You don't get to arbitrarily decide what qualifies and what doesn't. <br>It wasn't an argument it was precluding you from trying to say something to the tune of "it's komachi related" without actually posing a framework for your supposed better way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wrong as expected <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer Hikio too.

Will put in more effort in the next.</br>  <br>At least he has genuine friends now: Eguchi and Tobe's VA</br>  <br>SHIT</br>   people actually think Iroha won't win <br> when Spyro himself was lamenting about vol 11 and has been avoiding translating it </br>  Who /justhereforthedrama/ here?  <br>[citation needed]</br>   Season 3 in 2018   <br>totsuka based on Eguichi</br>  <br>C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER</br>  <br> Its probably going to be Yukinoshita in the end either way. <br>How? She's a ball of issues, and it terms of "looking good" Yui crushed her in volume 11. Not only did Yui did a great work at making Yukino give some steps, but she pretty much held her hand (figuratively) the entire volume and gave her even chances to be with 8man.<br><br>Unless WW comes with some retarded story that would bring drama to Yui's character and make her look bad so that Yukino can help her (and this would be seriously shit tier writing), Yukino has no way in hell to look better in comparison to Yui, since no matter how Yukino manages to handle her own issues, that's it, she's merely getting over her own stuff, unlike 8man and Yui who have actually managed to help other people.<br><br>Unless you just want Yukino to win because she's your favourite girl, you would have to admit her winning would make the ending feel bad, considering how she's barely done any merit to win.<br>And no, before you accuse me of saying that being loved has anything to do with achievements or merits, no, I know it doesn't, but a satisfactory conclusion does.<br>It would look horrible if Yui does this much for her friends and she doesn't get the one thing she wants, whilst Yukino never did anything for others (at least, not intentionally), was nothing but a device for drama and gets to win.<br><br>You would needs some serious twists and plenty of scenes devoted to Yukino redeeming herself and looking good for a Yukino ending to win, and that won't happen in 1 or 2 volumes.<br><br>Mind you, I'm not saying I cannot see Watari forcing a Yukino end. However, if we talk about what a good conclusion for the romance would be, as things stand out now (really close to the end of the story), Yui end is the only ending that would look good to make the story end on a satisfying note.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He thinks it's because of Iroha <br><br>It's because of Yui retard</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm here cause I feel like I've been with the thread so long I might as well be here when it dies for good.<br><br>Or maybe I'm just waiting for something new to start airing to draw me away.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y'all are all shiposters</br>  <br> someone not translating something just because his favorite girl won't win <br><br>Do people seriously do this?</br></br></br>  <br> You don't know what Yukino's mother knows <br>Point granted, but that still doesn't change the fact that Yukino's family has been built up as the source of her problems, not a solution.<br><br> On the contrary, my position is simply that you haven't proven it can't or won't change. <br>No, your position is that "struggling to find something genuine" is fundamentally flawed and thus you are implying that the current theme around which the story focuses is flawed. This necessitates a future shift in the series towards your supposed better solution.<br><br>My statement about your conjecture that it can change was intended as an example of the limited evidence you have provided regarding the nature or existence of a new, "real" theme.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both the club members took a nasty beating volume. Yui using Yukino as a pawn to manipulate 8man lost some points for sure.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I don't think a Yukino end would "look bad" just because she hasn't been able to help other people like Yui, as you argue. It actually would make more sense: if you take into account how 8man is selfless and likes both of them and values their well-being, he's more likely to choose the more needy one, writing Yui off as "she can take care of herself", and choosing Yukino in order to be able to keep helping her fix herself. Don't you think so?</br>  <br>I miss them</br>  <br> implying shs's not a nice grill </br>  <br><br>Not the one you are responding to.<br><br>  she's barely done any merit to win <br>Is it really a matter of winning? I mean Hachiman is going to get with the girl who he loves or is drawn to the most. That being based on how Wataru writes him. That might not be a girl who has worked the hardest to win his affections. Things just aren't necessarily fair that way.<br><br>I still think it's going to be Yukino because in regards to the narrative it still feels to me at least that this entire series has been about driving Yukino and Hachiman together. Even Yui, at her finest such as at the end of vol 11, is only serving as a bridge between her best friend and her love.<br><br>The one who is going to win isn't necessarily the one who "looks the best" from the perspective of readers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Once the animefags stop posting we'll have those old threads back</br>  <br>That's not genuine buddy, that's not even love.<br><br>That's pity and starting a relationship off of that isn't a good thing.</br></br></br>  <br>He loves them both. He knows having both is impossible (harems are things of fantasy). That's exactly why he says "in the end I'll be left with nothing" if he keeps chasing what he wants. Because he doesn't want to choose.<br><br>That implies he is able to genuinely love either of them, which is why he cannot pick one. But should he pick one for another reason, that doesn't mean he can't love them truly. Does this make sense to you too?</br></br></br>  <br>He's married to his kouhai, still Iroha is going to lose.</br>  <br>Yui never used Yukino or 8man. She was trying to draw out an 8man genuine reaction from the situation that Yukino was in. It was for the benefit of the service club's future.</br>  <br>Yukino deserves a better ending than that, once she gets her dependency problem solved I can see Yukino confessing to him but before that it's not going to happen</br>  <br>How do you guys know this?<br><br>He could've just had a 1 night stand.</br></br></br>  <br> he's more likely to choose the more needy one <br>He doesn't want to lead someone else.</br></br>  <br> Is it really a matter of winning? I mean Hachiman is going to get with the girl who he loves or is drawn to the most. <br>As I said, I wasn't talking about whether love is fair or not, but just how a Yukino end would look like to readers (shippers aside).<br><br>Yui has been a great girl, always caring for 8man and Yukino. Yukino, on the other hand, has hardly done anything for them.<br><br>So, even if love isn't fair, an ending with Yukino winning when she never did anything for her two friends would come off as highly unfair, considering all Yui has done.<br><br>Imagine watching an anime about a match between two teams. One team can't get its shit together, whilst the other one has been playing well and fair. At some point you see the other team give the shitty team chances to win, because they're that selfless and nice. Eventually, the shitty team overcomes its issues and wins.<br>Does that sound as a nice conclusion to you?<br>That's pretty much the 8bow if Yukino wins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since we self insert as 8man and Watari made 8man a self insert of himself we are basically Watari so we know everything about him cause we are him.</br>  Now that's docile.  <br>Picking because of dependency is not a good reason. I don't doubt that it's going to be a Yukino end, but "Yukino needs him" is not going to be the reason that 8man picks her.</br>  <br> So, even if love isn't fair, an ending with Yukino winning when she never did anything for her two friends would come off as highly unfair, considering all Yui has done. </br>  <br>I'll restate and clarify then<br><br>to be honest about ones feelings you cannot lie about or hide them<br><br>Revealing the truth of your feelings can sometimes be painful to yourself or others.<br><br>Having something "genuine" i.e. being honest sometimes leads to pain and suffering.<br><br>Given this, there can be no strictly better process to achieve a genuine end. Thus some term of the process must be redefined to achieve the same end, and I happened to choose "honest" as an example.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but that still doesn't change the fact that Yukino's family has been built up as the source of her problems, not a solution. <br>8man is a demonstrated unreliable narrator. He would much sooner implicate Yukino's family for her problems than he would accept that they're the result of his own actions.<br><br>There's a similar problem with the main theme. You claim Sensei's ideology is portrayed as positive (which in itself is subjective), but that's also through 8man's eyes. There isn't a single credible advocate for the ideology among the cast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And that crap wasn't a good ending.<br>If they wanted to follow that route they should have followed the original story rather than adding original stuff.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You need to separate love from merit and looking good.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All this time she was but an empty shell.<br><br>Haruno's a bitch but now I get why she went out of her way to get a reaction out of her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Readers don't start a love comedy thinking that the one who worked towards the love will win. 8man has been writing sonnets about Yukino since the beginning and it wouldn't come off as unexpected at all if he ends up with her. Sure the shipperfags are going to be upset but when will they not?</br>    <br>The LN was shit so it's ok</br>  <br>But we're talking about a fictional story.<br>The aesthetics of the narrative matter a lot, even if they don't hold up in real life. Thus, a particular plot thread - especially the resolution for any part of the story - is expected to look good.<br><br>Unless you're okay with an ending that looks highly unfair for one character, then be my guest. I'll agree to disagree with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well in regards to your football match metaphor, another way to look at is if one team has its shit together and tries it's hardest, while the other keeps making mistakes and blunders, but the second teams wins anyway because it's just plain faster and more talented. Which would be the case if the rules of this 'game' are based on who Hachiman likes the most. If he's just more into Yukino, that's the way it is. And that's how it is in real life too, sometimes no matter hard you try to win someone's affections, they're just not into you as much as they are someone else.<br><br>Having said all that, if you point a gun to my head and force to me pick one to win I still have to pick Yukino. I have NEVER thought Yukino was a sure thing though. And vol 11 has definitely brought Yui and Yukino to a more even footing. However I need to see a bit more to really convince me that Yui has pulled even or ahead.<br><br>I think in the next volume Yukino is going to start addressing her issues. And it's going to go faster than some posters would like it to in order to be true to real life. But Wataru probably doesn't care about that as long as it's still emotionally significant. Yukino's problems are front and center, but the story is still ultimately about Hachiman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to wreck that fucking butt</br>  <br>Nah man, the one who tries the hardest doesn't necessarily win in real life either.</br>  <br> 8man has been writing sonnets about Yukino since the beginning and it wouldn't come off as unexpected at all if he ends up with her. <br>And he's shown jealously when guys approached Yui.<br>He was also shown preventing her from getting a part time job and from joining some other club, because he was afraid there would be things about her he wouldn't know.<br><br>With Iroha he has also had plenty of moments in which he was enthralled with her charm.<br><br>Seriously, the sonnets would only matter if he never showed any interest for the other girls, but he does.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sonnets take a lot more effort than jealousy</br>  <br>Isn't his self insert Komachi?</br>  <br>That doesn't necessitate hardship though, as it leaves open the possibility of a person never actually being harmed by genuineness.</br>  <br>If we go by pure numbers Yukino has gotten the most writing about her. Yes he shows affection to other girls but Yukino gets the most. And thinking a lot about a person or thinking about them more than others leads to love</br>  <br> 8man serves as the bridge between the reader and the author </br>  <br> And he's shown jealously when guys approached Yui. <br>He's also shown denial and disgust at the thought of Yukino liking someone.<br><br>He likes them both to a certain extent but he obviously feels something for the old Yukino at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watari has done everything he can to make it seem like any of the girls can win. He clearly wants his readers to be up in arms over who's more likely to win. It's all pointless because he's going to leave all roads open until the very end.<br><br><br>Just to be clear 8man doesn't legitimately write sonnets. He just goes on incredibly long winded descriptions of how angel like Yukino is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of those thoughts are not on the real Yukino though</br>  <br>Hopefully 8man does try to bring back that Yukino and turn her into the real thing.</br>  <br><br>They're about Yukino though.<br><br>I mean you'd have to be naive to think this doll-Yukino is going to persist until the end of the series. She is going to go back to being someone worthy of his sonnets sooner or later. Genuinely this time I would bet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not wanting a parrot <br><br>What's wrong with you?</br></br></br>  Why does he hate Hikigaya?  <br>Unless you're implying he's not actually narrating other characters words to us correctly too, your argument doesn't hold water. Haruno has foreshadowed Yukino's issues on multiple occasions over the course of the series. 8man is at most the catalyst for change in Yukino, but it's become obvious by now that you blithely refuse to accept the possibility that the current direction the characters are moving in is a positive one.<br><br>For the theme, there doesn't need to be a "credible advocate" because we've seen its impact clearly. All three club members have been moving towards this genuine relationship over the course of the series and their lives have improved because of it- even with Yukino at her current low point she is in a state to actually address some of her problems for the first time in her life.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes but it still means he does think about Yukino a lot and he still does write sonnets about her in vol11.</br>  <br>too  alpha </br>  <br>If the infirmary is any indication they're not very long at all.</br>  <br>No it doesn't, but hoping to win at the odds is not a "strictly better solution"</br>  <br>He doesn't. He relates to 8man more than any of his followers.<br><br>8man is the closest thing he has to a friend and he's jealous of how much freedom he has.</br></br></br>  I guess it is important to consider how Hachiman's really seeing Yukino/Yui in a new-ish light at the end of vol 11 may affect him in vol 12.<br><br>He imposed this "strong girl" image on Yukino and "nice girl" image on Yui, then finally accepted at the end of vol 11 that they were not accurate. Will his internal frame of reference regarding the two change now? Is he going to stop composing sonnets for Yukino in vol 12 and start doing so for Yui? <br><br>Who knows. The author could go a lot of different ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is winning his crush despite being better in every way.</br>  <br>Seems legit to me</br>  <br> muh sonnets <br><br>Physical attraction != love</br></br></br>  what if oregairu was a comedy  <br>Sonnets are but a small part of it but his relationship with Yukinoshita has always been different than with Yui and Iroha. I'm not saying she'll win either but signs do point towards that end<br><br>He always felt a "connection" towards Yukinoshita since Vol 1 and no other girl has ever gotten this monulogue<br><br> As I watched her, a strange feeling suddenly overcame me. She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself.The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. <br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. <br>  It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond.  <br> Then… <br><br>Vol 6<br> Maybe that’s why. Maybe that’s why, whenever we exchange words like this, it always feels refreshing and pleasant. <br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. <br><br>You bet your ass Watari is going to put in another moment like this one. For what reason I dunno but maybe is a precursor to a confession or something<br><br><br>When? That spaghetti chocolate scene in Ep 12?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well in regards to your football match metaphor, another way to look at is if one team has its shit together and tries it's hardest, while the other keeps making mistakes and blunders, but the second teams wins anyway because it's just plain faster and more talented. <br>The problem with your metaphor is that it doesn't look any less bad.<br>Adding to to this analogy that the story is about to end, it would be as if the match is in the final minutes, the team that has its shit together is still giving the shitty team a chance, and merely saying "I'm going to start attacking now".<br>Then in the last 5 minutes the shitty team wins.<br><br>And again, I'm not talking about real life. I've said about 5 times now that I know this doesn't matter in real life, because love isn't fair. But this is a story, and in a story, these things do matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The infirmary scene was one where he was caught by surprise, he only looked at her describing what he saw at the moment.<br>As soon as he noticed her shoulders moving he frantically backed away and looked towards the ceiling.</br></br>  <br>Three club members have gotten into such deep emotional trouble that one's family has to personally step in.<br><br>They've all been through so much drama that a lot of /a/nons are sick of it and haven't even come close to someone like Komachi who doesn't fit in with the theme whatsoever, and Iroha is totally unaccounted for.<br><br>I don't think we're going to get anywhere on this particular point though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lust is literally the closest possible thing to love</br>  <br>Possible but I feel people take things into extremes when dealing with these characters<br><br>Yeah Yui isnt a nice girl but she still is (to an extent because its in her personality)<br><br>Yukino isnt currently a strong girl but we've seen (once in a blue moon mind you) that she can be.<br><br>So I think theres some medium where both statements can be correct</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha wins in terms of lust. 8man's always checking out her lips.</br>  <br> As I watched her, a strange feeling suddenly overcame me. She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself.The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. <br> Maybe that’s why. Maybe that’s why, whenever we exchange words like this, it always feels refreshing and pleasant. <br>But now he knows Yukino wasn't really like that at all.<br>The Yukino he used to admire never actually existed.<br>That's one of the things he comes to terms with in volume 11.<br><br>The Yukino he used to admire was a sham, a mirage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  SYNERGY  Anyone else cringe at Yukino's attempt at an insult here? There's no flare in it and it sounds awkward and forced.<br><br>8man better fix this.</br></br>  <br>Who would ever think she's a strong girl? She can barely function without someone there to help her.</br>  <br><br>  But this is a story, and in a story, these things do matter. <br><br>I can buy that. But it doesn't seem to really matter to writers. The 'most worthy' character frequently doesn't end up with the guy/girl in the end.<br><br>How many times does the childhood friend who has loved the guy passionately her entire life and does everything she can possibly get beat by the aloof long haired kuudere/tsundere that shows up out of nowhere and intrigues the main character?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more like worship.</br>  <br>His attraction to her is not only physical, he enjoys talking to her.<br>Their conversations are always refreshing to him something he doesn't get tired of.<br><br>They also shared something they believed but they've let each other down too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You think Hachiman gives a shit about who is most worthy based on merits. Loving someone because of that (and instead of basing it on feelings) isnt genuine<br><br> Oh Yui deserves it the most. I guess I'll start dating her. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>All you guys have said is that, for you, 8man's mind sonnets on Yukino are, somehow, more meaningful (in terms of romantic implications) than his thoughts for the other girls, without even elaborating on why you think that.<br><br>He's shown attraction to all of them.<br>Not to mention the "connection" he used to feel with Yukino has pretty much been severed now, since he knows Yukino was never the type of person he thought she was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Before recently it wasn't clear that she was this emotionally fragile.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>but also 8man and Yukino are nothing alike at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Komachi doesn't have to "fit the theme" any more than any other side character does. Even Sensei is nothing so much as a mentor/mouthpiece to plant the ideas in 8man's head.<br><br>As for Iroha, I think it's pretty clear that if being genuine and honest is the central theme of the story, then her place is the sacrificial lamb. She will never muster the resolve to be genuine with 8man until it's too late, and her heart will get broken because of it.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't understand the bant do you</br>  <br>He was wrong about Yui too. Guess all those jealousy signs you guys point out goes out the window as well. He had feelings for the nice girl Yui but not the current "I'm not a nice girl one"<br><br>Only fair</br></br></br>  <br>I guess everyone starts with 0 points again</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>It's more like<br> I cherish all you've done for us so I love you <br>8man obviously wouldn't think about it from our perspective. He'd think about the qualities that he loves in each girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah when the LN was getting spoiled I read it more as a "this is true, but.." thing.<br><br>Like<br>  Yui is a nice girl, but on some matters she can be cruel and selfish. <br>  Yukino is a strong girl, but she can fall victim to this dependency trap. <br><br>But it doesn't appear that's how it is. In that scene he seems to be altering his perception of them semi-permanently (until something else affects those perceptions at least). His words suggest he acknowledges that Yukino was never a strong girl to begin with, that was only something he imposed on her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Ironically probably where they're at right now even if the conclusion is drawn from incorrect premises.</br>  <br>Rather than that it because Yui keep doing effort to close their gap make him attached to her unconciously which is shown by 8man possesssiveness toward Yui.</br>  <br> I can buy that. But it doesn't seem to really matter to writers. The 'most worthy' character frequently doesn't end up with the guy/girl in the end. <br>Perhaps they don't, but in those stories the girl who wins at least had some scenes that made her look great throughout the story.<br><br>Yukino, on the other hand, got issue after issue dumped on her instead.<br><br><br>I'm not talking about 8man, but the audience.<br>8man could come out of the closet in the last part of the story, declare he's actually gay and loves Totsuka.<br>That wouldn't make for a satisfactory end.<br><br>I know I'm putting an extreme example there, but my point was to show 8man can feel whatever he wants, but that doesn't make the ending any more satisfying if it doesn't connect with how things have happened in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So Yuifags seem to take the position that Yui in that scene was putting on Hachiman's batsuit and trying to force Yukino to bring her feelings to the surface. A sort of self-sacrifice on Yui's part.<br><br>How do we reconcile that with all the "I'm not a nice girl like you think I am" and "I would prefer a lie". I mean if she's really trying to help Yukino there, then she's still a nice girl. If she was trying to get what she truly wants (relationships on her terms), then that fits more the "not a nice girl" frame for her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You saying Yukino didn't have good scenes? She's the most popular girl for a reason.</br>  <br> He had feelings for the nice girl Yui but not the current "I'm not a nice girl one" <br>Wrong<br><br>1. Yui is still a nice girl.<br>2. The "nice girl" deal was the one thing that prevented 8man from accepting Yui's feelings, because he thought the "nice girl" stuff was an act and thus not genuine.<br><br>Now he knows Yui isn't a nice girl, in terms that there's no act, and thus she's genuine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well we still have 1 maybe 2 or more volumes to go. It might be that once Yukino finds her genuine self she'll start showing the qualities that you're looking for.</br></br>  <br>The "I would prefer a lie" is Yui priming herself for failure. If 8man doesn't intervene as she wanted then she would be okay with them accepting her proposal. The "nice girl" act was never a part of Yui's character since "nice girl" is what 8man uses to refer to girls like Orimoto who acts the same way to everyone and leads him on. Yui's love, however, is genuine.</br>  <br><br>But then where's the proof she isn't a nice girl?<br><br>Or are you saying that she was trying to self-sacrifice but would take pressuring Yukino over that if she could get away with it and just expected Hachiman to not allow her to?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was putting a hint of truth into her methods. Even Hikigaya's own speech to Sagami had a hint of truth to it, though it was not entirely correct.</br>  <br>I think that it's both, in a way. She came up with that "answer" knowing it's wrong. The part of her that wants it to work is the "i prefer a lie" while the rest of her is banking on either Yukino or 8man to refuse her so that maybe she can finally discard her answer and start looking for a new one.</br>  <br>He knows this and has monologues about it when he tried to befriend her again in Vol 6. <br><br><br><br><br>This entire story has been about Hachiman and Yukinoshita finding an answer together<br><br>That vol 6 snippet someone posted was titled "At last, he and she find the correct answer" and dealt with them finally getting over the Yukinoshita never lies subplot.<br><br>Hachiman has always imposed images onto Yukinoshita more than any other character. But the way the story is progressing, its inevitable that these two will eventually find their "true answer" (once Yuki snaps out of this moeblob stage of hers)<br><br>10.5 even suggests it as such<br> Either way, there’s no doubt that the both of us had made the wrong call. Whether it was me, her, or ourselves, we still had yet to come to an understanding. And that was presently like the state of the sky that expanded beyond the window, the sky that belonged to any one person. While you were unable to distinguish between noon and night, the moment you could tell was the moment the color of would change, moment by moment. <br> While answering, I looked at the same sunset. Regardless, it’s likely the color we were seeing were different. Red, pink, or scarlet. Perhaps, vermillion or even dark red. It may very well be orange. But no matter what the color, it wouldn’t have bothered me <br><br>Who knows how the story will end up but theres evidence to show that there might be a satisfactory ending (since Oregairu is about these two more than anything)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good scenes that were relevant to the story.<br>Considering this is a story that centres about a club that tries to help other people, and the story is revolves around teenager issues, good scenes would be ones in which Yukino gets to help others.<br><br>On the other hand, Yukino's "good scenes" came down to her beating that one judo guy, which wasn't particularly plot relevant, or her telling the hand-juggling guy to fuck off, which didn't make her shine either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now i asking you how do you judge someone actually nice person?<br><br>For me it was someone who keep doing something nice but she/he doesn't want to admit it.</br></br></br>  <br> Even Hikigaya's own speech to Sagami had a hint of truth to it, though it was not entirely correct. <br><br>No everything he said was truth and correct, but the way he did it wasn't right.</br></br></br>  <br>If she really want to take 8man for herself then why would she kept pushing Yukino to 8man in this episode?<br>She could've just invited 8man alone.<br><br>It's obvious that she wants Yukino to face her true feeling.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She also told Tobe to leave the club when he started bad mouthing Hachiman.<br><br>But yeah one of the themes of the series is how Yukino's ability to help people is inferior to Hachiman's rotten methods. But even Yui's only real quality scenes she has shown is that she can bridge the gap in the service club.<br><br>It's always been Hachiman doing everything important and then the other two just kind of following along and providing tangential support.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do you anons think the loser will deal with the other girl ending up with 8man? Assuming WW intends for their relationships will last, would one girl have to fall out of love or something?  http://strawpoll.me/4770308  8man just realized what people do when the "nice person" tells you 'no' for once.  <br>Nah, I don't think Yui was putting on any batsuit, but was she did was 100% her own methods.<br><br>What she did wasn't painting anyone in a wrong light, nor was she manipulating anyone.<br><br>Yui made a gamble. She decided to tell Yukino and 8man to just overlook all their issues, and be together. That was a selfish thing she wanted, she would give up on her love, but would keep 8man and Yukino as her friends.<br><br>Then there was also the possibility that her proposal would be turned down, because the former choice was clearly not genuine. That would allow her chasing after 8man, but the state of their friendship in the future remained unknown.<br><br>Basically, her actions came down to communicating, which is what Yui has always done.<br>Notice she even explicitly said the "mutually disarmament" option was bull, but it would be like a nice dream they all could accept. So, no manipulation, just saying things as they are, so that they could talk things about and make a choice.<br><br>So, this was just Yui being Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree. That's part of why I am mixed up about Yui's motivations at the end.<br><br>And I understand that I'm being pedantic here too. If she was truly trying to help Yukino, then that's is selfless of her and I would call that being a 'nice girl'. That's not exactly the same as Hachiman's definition, but regardless he discards that perception of her as well based on what he saw at the end. If she was actually attempting to force Yukino to sink her own ship, then that's where I would say she's not a 'nice girl'.<br><br>I guess just thinking about it right now, Hachiman's perception of what happened wasn't perfect. He may not have seen what Yui was really trying to do, only what she was appearing to do so he says she's "not a nice girl". But that would throw his recalculations at the end of Yui and Yukino into question. In other words, we can't accept his new judgements of the two girls as gospel.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino will have her moment with 8man and then unfortunately leave to go study overseas, leaving Yui with 8man.<br><br>8man will start a relationship with Yui. Although she knows that it was only because Yukino left and that she'll always be #2 in 8man's heart.</br></br></br>  <br> Starts Service Club <br> Weird guy joins <br> Knows every situation in and out and provides effective, but cruel, methods <br> Can't do jack <br> One method was particularly bad, got irritated by it <br> Election request <br> Still can't do jack <br> 8man still solves it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui option <br>What?</br></br>  <br> But even Yui's only real quality scenes she has shown is that she can bridge the gap in the service club. <br>True, but Yui also has the advantage that she's always been nice and she's never brought down drama.<br><br>This, in comparison, makes her look better than Yukino - or, at least, not as bad.</br></br></br></br>  How do you guys watch subbed anime?<br><br>I don't have fast eye coordination to read the lines at the bottom of the screen and watch the anime scenes at the same time.</br></br>  I watch raws. Get good  I watch it once to read the subtitles, then I rewatch it to get what's going on onscreen.  <br><br>Is this actually a legitimate problem people have?<br><br>Your reading comprehension skills should be good enough that you can passively pick up on the words at the bottom of the screen without needing to lose awareness of what's going on, Unless English is not your first language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just listen to music while it's running.</br>  <br>I just pretend I watch anime.</br>  <br> tfw I only watch dubbed anime, muted and lip read <br>Get on my level</br></br>  <br>I have this problem, even if I can pick up on or infer most if it from what I see as subs I worry I didn't read it right so I always pause</br>  <br>Not him but yeah, I'm pretty stupid and have to read things over multiple times in my head to actually grasp what I'm reading.</br>  You don't have to pay that much attention to what's going on on screen.<br>That's why we watch little girl shows. There's little to no action or anything going on while they're talking, except for mouth flaps moving, so you don't miss anything.</br>  That means that everyone else that watches anime is just more used to it.<br><br>I was like that when I started too, focusing so hard on the subtitles. The problem is that every other form of reading asks you to focus heavily on the words themselves. When you read subtitles, reading should become second nature instead of a conscious effort. Watch more and you'll get to that level.</br></br>  Dubs are just better in general if you're in a setting where the actors of both versions are equal quality. You can pick up on subtlety in the voices in your native language, like how "I didn't say she stole my manga" means a completely different thing depending on which word the speaker focuses on. You just can't get that in subs unless the subs italicize/bold the word that is focused on, but subs don't do that in almost any case. There is a reason humans developed speech instead of using sign language, there is a lot of subtlety in voices we pick up on subconsciously, and a good VA gets those subtleties across. <br><br>There are a lot of benefits for using dubs. The only big benefit of subs is just that you can learn the language being subbed bit by bit if you pay attention (and this doesn't change the quality of the show at all, it doesn't matter unless you're learning Japanese anyway).</br></br>  Just read the subtitles. It'll be like reading a book.  I feel like watching anime has contributed quite a bit to how fast I can read. Only time I've had a problem was with Tatami Galaxy, but it's not too fast for me anymore.  <br> We <br>Not everyone on 4chan's a closet pedophile. Speak for yourself.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Funimation shill. Your dubs are garbage.</br>  <br>You can pick up on the subtleties in a language you dont speak, especially one like Japanese</br>  <br> The only big benefit of subs is just that you can learn the language being subbed bit by bit if you pay attention </br>  <br>extract the sub and put them in text to speech, put it on 135% volume and put the anime on 85%</br>  Just read manga  <br><br><br>How do you guys function in real life it takes you 30 seconds to read and understand a single sentence?</br></br></br>  its not actually difficult unless youre a mongoloid. learn to a. read multiple words at once and 2. just pay attention to whats happening and the words at the same time  <br>This. I never get how people can miss a whole episode/movie because they had to read the lines at the bottom and focus on the words more than the visuals I guess.</br>  <br>Autism.</br>  Jesus fucking christ, unless this is Tatami Galaxy or shows with equally as quick speaking, there should be no problem.  I'm not ESL and I never have any problem reading subs. Just sometimes in shows like Tatami Galaxy or Teekyu where everyone talks in light speed.<br><br>Does that mean I'm a genius? Or are just all Americans dumb?</br></br>  <br>I'll agree that dubs are better if you want to understand the background stuff, otherwise; i completely disagree.<br><br>The voice actors have to try and match the mouth flapping with the words the characters actually say so they have to come up with inventive ways to translate the words the characters are saying. It can't just be a direct translation. It's a translation that ALSO works verbally, which means the original meaning can sometimes be skewed quite a bit.<br><br>Dubber's have a lot of skill here but they change up a lot. Also, when they pronounce Japanese words, they fuck up a lot. Usually varying in pronunciation between voice actors.</br></br></br></br></br>  watch the american dub like a true patriot  <br>i also change the resolution to 640x480 so the window is smaller so i have to move my eyes less</br>  <br>youre of standard intelligence everyones just FUCKING RETARDED</br>  <br>I don't even look at the screen.

Check em.</br>  <br>  dubs are a solution and subs are a crutch. <br>No. The original gives you a certain voice pronouncing certain words with certain meanings in certain ways. The biggest issue is that you don't have access to the meaning, and the smaller issues are that you don't grasp all the importance/subtleties of the other elements (like the pronunciations and such). Subs and dubs give you effectively equal access to the meaning. Dubs also allow to understand more of the importance of the other aspects, which subs don't, but in order to do this they deprive you of the other elements themselves, which subs don't. You no longer have access to the actual words, the voice, the pronunciation (you have some form of English analogue to the pronunciation, but it's different in terms of what you hear). It's an inferior reproduction compared to subs.</br></br>  So all Shirou needed is a girlfriend and he couldn't have become Archer?  Pretty much.<br><br>A girlfriend, and get someone pregnant.

If you play Heaven's Feel, he pretty much abandons his SEIGI NO MIKATA shit.</br></br>  No, he needed a girlfriend who realized something was wrong with him and actively tried to fix him.  <br>No, all he needed was the sense to read the fine print and thoroughly reflect on it before entering into a deal he couldn't opt out of.</br>  <br>Or maybe a psychiatrist?</br>  <br>Those don't exist in anime.</br>  He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA. He needs someone to take some of the pressure off of him and make him reflect on his own life.  <br>They do, faggot.</br>  <br>Accidently deleted this.<br><br>It is the same way Shiki needs Mikiya to be her limiter as shown in movie 2 and 7.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think they exist in anime or japan, period. Neon Genesis Evangelion's plot would have been fixed easily by a decent child psychologist/child care specialist by giving Shinji and Asuka attention and care.<br><br>Shirou however, is a tough case. No psychologist would have detected any problem for a while, he just looks like like a hardworking, decent kid.</br></br></br>  <br>A waifu will save your laifu.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter what or are you some kind of braindead moron?<br>The point is that he's not going to break down anymore.</br></br>  <br>Wait I thought he did become archer he just didn't hate it</br>  <br>He won't become Archer, he'll surpass Archer.</br>  <br>Eh, yeah pretty much. Though he needs a top tier level waifu, if they are too low level he might just drop his ideals and join a life of mediocrity.</br>  <br>Super Saiyan Archer!?</br>  <br>What if you lack both waifu and life? Will you become some kind of revenant and wander the Earth forever?</br>  <br> Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter <br><br>They are saying he is going to go down the same/similar path but in a way that will not cause the world to contract with him. Hell Shirou at this point is a shit ton stronger than Archer was at his age by the fact alone that his hair is not white. He is going surpass Archer.</br></br></br>  * The very final scene<br>It's a scene that you'll understand if you review it again, but it was easily misunderstood so here's the excerpt from the script.<br><br>Wasteland scene<br>"After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland.<br>Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt.<br>Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking).<br>Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope.<br>Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait.<br>The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance.<br>(To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)"<br><br>He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point.<br><br>From Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be differences - it's an alternate world obviously - but he will still become a counter guardian and be bitter about his decision or want to do things differently.</br>  <br><br> that will not cause the world to contract with him <br><br>What does that mean?<br><br><br><br>Where further is there for him to even go? If he just becomes a counter guardian again, isn't that a dead end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Emiya is such a beautifully constructed character.<br>Nasu really got lucky writing this guy.</br></br>  <br>HF is crap.</br>  <br> He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA <br><br>That girlfriend died not long after his HGW was over.<br><br>Many suspect that this "girlfriend" was Ilya. Ilya is fated to die a few weeks after the Holy Grail War whatever its outcome which fits and also how Archer acts towards Ilya in F/SN and how he reacts whenever she is in trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>You have to create a contract to become a Counter Guardian. There's basically a point where Shirou will have to say yes or no to living an eternity going around killing people.<br><br>With the knowledge he gained from Archer though, he might not.<br><br> Where further is there for him to even go? <br><br>Shirou is already miles ahead of Archer in terms of abilities. Literally over a decade if you want to go by source books. With Rin there with him, he can do a lot better than some guy wandering around aimlessly with no power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those weren't real psychiatrists, they were escaped mental patients hiding from the law.</br>  Did archer just fucking retain his memories and debunk World Material?  <br>No, the point is that he is resolved to continue his ideals despite knowing and readily admitting their limitations and discrepancies.<br><br>Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian.<br><br>UBW Shirou can happily go after his ideals safe in the knowledge of what their conclusion could be and with support from Rin. Its highly likely he will end up surpassing Archer and could arrive at an entirely different end entirely.<br><br>The Shirou who reached Avalon in last Episode is strongly suspected to be Fate Shirou, who pursued his ideals whole heartedly didnt become Archer, so why would UBW Shirou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he won't. His end MAY be tragic but it won't be one that results in him becoming a CG. Why the fuck would Alaya try to contract with him with the fact he is going to go down a path preventing that from ever happening.<br><br><br>Shirou will be much stronger than Archer was when he was alive and be able to do more than before thus eliminating the need of Alaya to show up and try to offer him a way out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's brain problems aren't even something that can be recognized as even remotely realistic in the first place.</br>  <br>Oh shit he did. Fate is ruined.</br>  <br>That he did.<br><br>I think Nasu pulled his writing together after completely scrapping the original F/SN story (Fate/Protoype) and arrived at the Shirou and Archer duality.</br></br></br>  <br>You're crap</br>  <br> Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian. <br>He did, he only became bitter about it AFTER he became a counter guardian, holy shit it's absurd how many times I have to explain this to you fuckers.</br></br>  <br>Thats what I said you silly fuck.</br>  <br>I don't know about Shirou, but my case was one of those situations where I would be instantly killed if I ever got a girlfriend or a job :/</br>  <br>Survivor's guilt is a legitimate medical diagnosis that falls under PTSD.</br>  Can Shirou just pull UBW out of his ass whenever he wants now?  UBW Shirou/Archer will be fine as long as he avoids becoming a counter guardian.  <br>Yes he has Rin support.</br>  <br> A psychiatrist <br> help Shirou <br><br>Shirou is a level of crazy that I highly doubt even exists in real life.<br><br>He is so utterly mind broken from his sense of self and ego dying in the fire just moments before his body would have died, had it not been for Kiritsugu.<br><br>Im not sure what a Psychiatrist could do to help him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The more important question is, Does shirou actually need to do the chant to summon UBW or is that just show boating?</br>  <br>Survivor's Guilt is but ONE aspect of how fucked up Shirou is in the head.<br><br>The man literally lost his sense of self. By all rights he sould be a vegetable but he latched onto something and made it his purpose.</br></br></br>  <br> Start chanting UBW in England <br> Everybody are having a giggle on his bloody broken English </br></br>  <br>I think he needs to at least do the abbreviated chant.</br>  <br>Fortunately, every single one of the HUGE number of people who were literally, legally, and morally required to kill me in that situation seemed to have forgotten about that for some reason</br>  <br>Damn</br>  <br>Words are powerful and give meaning to what is being created/used. Reason why Servants say the name of their NP when they use it.</br>  <br>Then they burn him at the stake for having a RM</br>  <br> Gil: GATE OF BABYLON!!! <br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>That reason being, I am, in fact, an actual member of ISIS, and Arabic technology is extremely powerful</br>  <br>They won't burn him at a stake but he'll probably be captured and experimented on for having a RM.</br>  <br>As long as he stays hooked up to Rin as a mana battery, yes.<br><br>Not that he's ever going to need it again. Rin-powered projections are more than enough for most non-magus human enemies. It's unlikely he'll ever actually up against something at the caliber of a servant again.</br></br></br>  Why can't Shirou trace mana and magic circuits for himself.  <br> Does shirou actually need to do the chant to summon UBW or is that just show boating? <br>Yes, it's actually an 8 line incantation.<br>It's the same as Rin's german mumbo jumbo.<br>Archer apparently got it down to 2 or 3 lines after becoming a servant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them do. Berserker says nothing yet he has his. It depends on the weapon/magic. UBW needs it to create it from within him and make it a reality.</br>  <br>Yes. And if he continues as Rin's pupil, he will be able to manifest UBW on his own prana supply after a few years.</br>  To be honest, there's no way in hell it's ending well. Yuzu and Yugo have become friends, and I'm sure he's going to teach her how to ride a motorcycle, which is like a +10 relationship modifier. <br><br>Yuya and Yugo will fight, they'll both go berserk because LOLDRAGONS, and Yuzu will end up traumatized and/or injured. <br><br>That's assuming none of the other lore comes out, but I'm sure it will. Worst case scenario the entire city gets destroyed by the dickass gods and goddesses. Fucking Yuya and Yuzu, they ruin everything. Leo was right.</br></br></br></br>   capture Shirou who teared King of Heroes a new one <br><br>Top kek<br>He is a shitty mage but one of the best combatants in nasu verse that are human</br></br></br>  <br>Tracing is heresy, it ignores the equivalent exchange rule.</br>  <br>GoB isnt something that you can "power up". Its pretty static.</br>  <br>As far as humans go he is top tier. Only top tier combat specced mages or Dead Apostle Ancestors could ever touch him, and DAAs aint even human anymore.</br>  So when does Shirou learn about broken phantasma's and when does he start using a bow?<br><br>Also can Shirou/archer make all the projections in UBW broken phantasma's?</br></br>  <br>He still becomes acher. Did you even watch the damn serie.</br>  <br>Shirou is worth too much as something to study to just burn at the stake. He would just get a sealing designation.</br>  <br>Looks like Nasu just got<br><br>B U S T E D<br>U<br>S<br>T<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats what I said.</br>  <br> He still becomes acher. Did you even watch the damn serie. <br>Did you?<br><br> People think Nasu is that cruel of a person <br>He isn't Uroburchi</br></br></br></br></br>  is this chart correct? I'm might be forgetting some of the pre-order only routes but besides that this is all of them, right?  <br>I know. I was expanding on what you said</br>  <br> thinking the world of mages is weak <br><br>The Mage Association and the Church has some strong enforcers/executions. Kirei is considered low tier in the grand scheme of things and even he would be an extremely hard battle for Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good retcon.</br>  <br>So he'll get frozen instead of getting burned.</br>  <br>Yes, they can.<br><br>All they do is overload the NP with prana. Its simple and brutally effective, if you have NPs to spare.</br></br></br>  Imagine if Luvia ever found out the shit that went down in Fuyuki.<br><br>She would pay Rin anything for Sherou's seed.</br></br>  <br>World Material is now uncanon. <br>DEBUNKED<br>E<br>B<br>U<br>N<br>K<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Knock that autistic shit off.</br>  yeah but why no cool long ass fights :(  Wait.. in London, it is okay for a pupil to bang his teacher?  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes. <br><br>Where else would she go when she is low on mana?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's London.</br>  <br>kill yourself please</br>  <br>God I will never forget the stream thread.<br><br>Everyone flipped their shit as people were expecting the normal true ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Truly not exploiting the system to bring her guy with her.</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br> expecting the worst Japanese in the world to have any sense of shame or decency </br>  <br>Agreed. It's better this way.</br>  <br>I cried, shit was amazing. Took me a whole day for it to sink in.</br>  <br>He's a CG not a heroic spirit <br><br>He's like Arthur in fact UBW was supposed to be a direct contrast where Shirou is alone on a hill just like Saber and both come to understand and accept their decisions</br></br></br>  <br>So what now CGs retain memories?</br>  <br><br>BD's when? I actually held myself back and haven't watched UBW at all cause I want to enjoy it in BD quality.</br></br>  <br>Maximum Over Archer</br>  <br>October I believe.</br>  If Shirou makes a contract with the world to become a CG, would that mean there are two different Emiya Shirou in the Throne, or do they fuse into a Super EMIYA?  <br><br><br><br>This reminds me of this Mexican girl I met in the mental hospital here who was legitimately convinced that she could get anyone to do anything for her, because the ENTIRE STAFF was playing along with her. Frankly, this makes me feel terrible whenever i see it. We literally drove a LOT of people actually insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It really was a great fucking ending. UFOtable continue to show that they fucking love the source material that they are adapting and it isnt just buisness.<br><br>I mean it had Glastonbury, Rin and Luvia's TM April Fools Wrestling, Waver as an Adult. It was 10/10.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what's the deal with Waver? He just work there now?</br>  <br>By the way, this isn't some sort of coded language, I'm talking about an actual, real live Mexican girl in the actual hospital here in Seattle</br>  <br> October <br>Fuck. Oh well, I waited all these months, I guess I can wait a few more.</br></br>  <br>Yes that's what Extra's Archer is.</br>  <br>So when I tell people "you are mentally ill, seek help", I'm NOT joking or exaggerating in any way.</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>Just watch it now, nothing to lose.</br>  <br>Yep. He is a teacher there.<br><br>As a magus, he is low tier and completely forgettable. As a teacher of other magi he is one of the best.<br><br>Its a constant source of frustration for him. He is shit but he excells in making people born with natual talent and big crests even bette.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where the hell did Archer just retain his memories?</br>  <br>After the credits.</br>  <br>And thats why we call him Waver Cuckvet.</br>  <br> That girlfriend died not long after his HGW was over. <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>One of Rin's "flashbacks" where she see's Archer's past.<br><br>She states that he had a lover but she died not long after the HGW.</br></br></br>  <br>They always have. Saber remembers the 4th HGW.</br>  <br>Nasu magic is done by self hypnotism/suggestion, and the chants are the requirement.<br><br>Supposedly, more chants= bigger magic.<br>Meanwhile, magics from the crest can circumvent chanting.<br><br>Shits from F/SN though, who knows how many Nasu retconns or exceptions have happened since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to have sex with Caster's laser beams.  <br>Saber is not a CG though</br>  <br>Enuma Elish nigga.</br>  <br>She never says she dies not long after the HGW, his girlfriend is not Illya.</br>  <br>Saber isn't a normal Servant stupid.</br>  <br>She does say that, though.</br>  <br>The Saber in this wars is not dead.</br>  <br>Nope. You can show me, but I am not remembering wrong.</br>  <br>Where? If I remember correctly she only mentioned the girlfriend once, in this part:<br><br> He had friends and a lover. <br> He lost all of them, and he was cornered by the ideal he pursued. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sabe<wbr>r_%28Fate/stay_night%29 wrong, then?</wbr></br>  <br>Except CG's are a form of Heroic spirit in the throne of heros...</br>  <br>Shirou is already so good at archery that he only misses if he wants to. If he gets better he'll create the Tsubame Gaeshi for bows.</br>  <br>Saber is not dead and not a official servant so rules don't apply to her fully.</br>  <br><br> Shirou is a level of crazy that I highly doubt even exists in real life. <br><br>That is pretty much never true when you talk about fictional mental illnesses. While fiction is rarely precisely accurate when it comes to representing mental conditions, and it has a tendency to make things more colorful than they are in real life (e.g. split personalities, which simply do not exist in real life), fiction has a weird tendency to lowball how severe and crippling disorders can be. Shirou can walk around, speak coherently and intellectually, clearly recognize his surroundings, and generally behave like an average human being in day-to-day life, which puts him way, way ahead of your average long-term patient at a psychiatric facility. He demonstrates odd symptoms for his condition, which would make diagnosis a bit tricky, but it is well within the ability of a qualified therapist to help him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but it is well within the ability of a qualified therapist to help him. <br><br>No it isnt, simply because fundamentally he sees nothing wrong with what he is doing.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this scene going to get expanded in the BDs?</br>  <br> a lengthy summary that is practically headcanon <br>Yes, it is.<br><br>Her contract with Araya resembles a counter guardian contract, but it never got to that point.<br> Fuck, I regret this shit <br> Time to fix it <br> I know, I'll get the grail! <br> Give me chance(s) to get the grail, World! <br> Gets summoned into every contest or quest with a grail on the line, in her flesh and blood body <br> Happens to fit as "Servant" Saber for this event, gets Servant specific traits <br> Didn't obtain grail in F/SN, gets convinced by Shirou in most routes to GIVE UP HUNTING THE GRAIL <br> Contract breaks, she moves to Avalon instead of the throne of heroes <br><br>She never became a heroic spirit, and never became a counter guardian, because it simply never happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn you Ufotable.<br><br>I wanted to save money on the BD Box but then you show this when you buy from you directly.<br><br>I HATE PROXIES!</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was in the VN and was the same scene? The point is that he'll only keep his answer until the next summoning.</br>    <br> She never became a heroic spirit <br>She does in HF.</br></br>  <br><br>It's within their ability, anon. That is to say, they could do it given the opportunity, which would assume circumstances or his own volition caused him to go into therapy.</br></br>  <br> Im not sure what a Psychiatrist could do to help him. <br>give him happy pills</br></br>  <br>IIRC though Nasu said she was able to get around it in HF also.<br><br>Don't remember the direct quote</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone is "qualified" to deal with magical PTSD that de-souls someone into a machine.<br><br>You'd have to go way off the textbooks by that point, and that makes most of the paper qualifications guaranteeing 6 years of studying psychiatry? Useless.<br><br>An experienced psychiatrist could be a different matter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What do you get when you buy directly?</br></br>  <br>The storyboard book and I remember seeing a book for the 1st half BD and it was huge.</br>  Holy shit I want to hug her  <br>For every episode? Oh god fucking damn it UFO.</br>  <br>Nah.<br>Nasu likes his cause and effect shit, and the prerequisite of becoming a heroic spirit is obtaining the grail to fulfill the contract.<br>HF's Saber is more likely to simply hunt for the rest of eternity for the grail, until simply no more grails pop up. Then she waits for eternity. ;_;<br><br>Alternatively, due to multiverse faggotry, simply having those few possible routes where Saber gets persuaded out of chasing the grail, means that it is inevitable for a Saber that reaches every possibility for the grail.<br>Practically fanwanking by this point, but Last Episode DOES suggest the possibility.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LOS! LOS LOS LOS!</br>  <br>Every episode for the 2nd cour.<br><br>If you want the first half you have to search online to buy it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Going off textbook is one of the basic skills that a therapist is expected to have. It's an exceptionally lucky break when a patient actually does exhibit symptoms close to a textbook description. Rest of the time you're just lucky to get within the ballpark. Hell, at least Shirou's issues can all be traced to a single traumatic event, most patients don't have conditions nearly that convenient.</br></br>  <br> Every episode for the 2nd cour. <br>Well there goes my money.</br></br>  <br><br>Found the book</br></br>  Now its over Im getting a real urge to go back and rewatch Carnival Phantasm  <br> means that it is inevitable for a Saber that reaches every possibility for the grail. <br>Wait what?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, that's large.</br>  <br>Dealing with a soulless faggot bordering autism is way off the textbook.<br>Sure, diagnosing and categorising it is possible I guess.<br><br>Good luck treating it though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HORIZON BIG</br>  <br>Worth it for sure.</br>  <br>What do you mean by buy directly? aniplex japan? ufo's storefront?</br>  <br>Araya promised Saber the opportunity to compete for EVERY instance of ANYTHING named the holy grail, which is capable of granting wishes.<br><br>I meant,<br> inevitable for a Saber that reaches out for every possibility for the grail </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's really nothing preventing you from effectively treating somebody exhibiting symptoms like Shirou's aside from his own willingness to submit to treatment. Curing his condition completely, that's another matter, same with any other patient, but treatment is always an option.</br></br>  <br>Is this like a special preorder for aniplex/ufotable directly?</br>  <br>Didn't she obtain the grail in HF? Didn't she also gain a human body like Gil?</br>  <br>Ufotable store online.<br>https://ufotabln.temporarydomain.ne<wbr>t/ufoshop/index.php?main_page=produ<wbr>ct_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=356</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh, I wonder if a Saber managed to do it.</br>  I wasn't around for yesterdays threads, what were the reactions to the worm apples like?  <br>F5 to take screenshots, anon</br>  <br>I thought they were meant to be bunny shaped.</br>  <br>Not possible because she sucks and fails every time, probably.</br>  <br>Well she wouldn't be Saber if she succeeded in things most important.</br>  <br>I'm sure Saber manages eventually. But I'd rather her come to terms with herself</br>  <br>Getting swallowed by Sakura's gaping hole does not count as obtaining the grail, nor causes similar results as Gil's bath in fate zero.<br><br>For one thing, her wish wasn't granted. That defeats the purpose of the contract she signed.</br></br></br>  <br>Secondary here, I think they are a cute couple.</br>  <br>Her wish was to get the grail and she got it.</br>  <br>He needed a girlfriend who wasn't Ilya, who'd die before she could save him.</br>   What other reason do I have to live <br><br>We all know that feeling Seiba</br></br>  <br>Will he ever have babies?</br>  <br>But she needs to become Dark Saber for Heaven's Feel!<br><br>What are the chances HF gets a movie trilogy instead of one movie?</br></br></br>  <br>Higher than 1 movie</br>  <br> What are the chances HF gets a movie trilogy instead of one movie? <br><br>It is inferred that Ufotable is made up of HF fans and they are going to be the first/only people to ever animate the route. Odds are in its favor for more than 1 movie.</br></br></br>  Fate route please Takeuchi you have to do something.  <br>Maybe, if he ever remembers Taiga or if the Archibald loli ever goes dere for him.</br>  <br>or save her waifu before she gets strangled.</br>  <br>I want it so bad.</br>  So in the Good end does Rin take Saber to see her grave?  <br>I meal literally, exactly what I said. Just some girl I met at the hospital who had played too much of this "game"<br><br>What's "it"? I don't know what you're talking about. My reference point is usually Futurama season 10 and all of Archer on netflix</br></br></br>  <br>deen</br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>I wouldn't doubt it will be eventual. They showed Arturia the girl in episode 20 so it is likely.</br>  <br>I mean just to be sure you understand, I don't have some exhaustive map of every single show in the universe, so I can't exactly just guess what you're talking about when you say vague things like that</br>  <br>But it was shit</br>  <br>Why would he ever fuck Taiga? He hates Japan and the Japanese for being such a dense culture. And he never comes back; he just imports JRPGs.  I bet he played Demons' Souls. <br><br>And the Archibald girl will fuck some other super-magic circuit mage, as per tradition.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its going to happen.<br><br>There were too many things hinting at it in the last few episodes, and the final episode was really heavy on the hints.<br><br>I wouldnt be surprised if UFOtable give us a heavily re-tooled Fate route as the "climax" of their F/SN adaption.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's all that Seiba deserves </br>  <br>His girlfriend was not Illya.</br>  <br> willingness to submit to treatment <br>That is the key issue in this case. Its not denial that he has an issue, he can't see it as an issue. Magic is crazy man.</br></br>  <br>I mean frankly, I can easily speculate about what you're talking about, but I don't intend to just up and take away every last shred of peoples human dignity like that, because I have NO IDEA what the blowback for THAT would be at this point. It would probably be very bad.</br>  <br>Saber deserves the best</br>  <br>HF is being remade to have Saber as the heroine.</br>  <br>I mean, there could LITERALLY, and I mean LITERALLY be an actual nuclear explosion somewhere in the world, maybe here in Seattle. Teleportation is an alarming ability.</br>  <br/>  <br>Thanks Takeuchi!</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>I completely agree, Castah!</br>  <br>Fate is the most popular route in japan, yeah? Eventually, it might get it's own OVA's or movies, or perhaps they're saving it for another 10 years so they can make another adaptation. Adapting all three routes so close together would be killer, or a little too much depending on who you're asking.<br><br>UBW is my favourite route, but I think Shirou and Saber are the cutest couple.<br><br>Let's be honest though. Fate doesn't bring anything unique to the table other than the Shirou and Saber romance, and Saber gets plenty more focus. But everything Fate addresses will be at least touched on in UBW and HF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I don't mean "someone will get mad and launch nukes at me", I mean this is an AUTOMATED SYSTEM. I HAVE the ACTUAL NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES. Do you get it?</br>  <br>How did UFO handle this part? I dropped it because I didn't like the adaptation but then I heard anons saying they did the Gil fight and the end really well.</br>  <br>Why do I feel like I've seen this exact post before</br>  <br> But everything Fate addresses will be at least touched on in UBW and HF. <br>A bit in UBW, but HF pretty much just has Alter. Saber only gets her story properly resolved in Fate.</br></br>  <br>Saber not being a normal heroic spirit gets covered in her route.</br>  Episode 24<br>1000000000000000/10<br><br>Episode 25<br>∞/10<br>All was forgiven</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HF has nothing on Saber besides a color palette swap and her going mute.</br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  <br> Let's be honest though. Fate doesn't bring anything unique to the table other than the Shirou and Saber romance <br><br>See, thats where you are wrong.<br><br>If they trimmed off all the info dumping and world building, changed Shirou's initial attitute towards Saber from "you cant fight cos your a girl" to "I cant stand the thought of anyone else fighting for me" and then add in lots of extras i.e. fully flesh out Saber's rule, show us scenes of Saber and her knights, her relationship with Lancelot, the loss of Caliburn, the gaining of Excallibur, the loss of Avalon and then the full battle of Camelann complete with Morgana and Mordred fuckery and they could make it amazing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, maybe I'll pick it back up.</br>  <br>What did you drop it for?</br>  <br>Fate brings a lot to the table that the other routes don't. Fate also has the best Gil.</br>  <br>You make a good point. If they could somehow add in the GoA info, flesh out Saber's background complete with reworked Arthurian lore, I would absolutely love it and possibly purchase it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Regardless, does this theoretically mean there might be two EMIYA in the Throne? One is the Counter Guardian Shirou we know and possibly the other is the Shirou we see in the various paths of the Fate games (or just UBW) who might have risen high enough to become a full Heroic Spirit?<br><br>Or am I just being a filthy, ignorant secondary.<br><br>I'm just wondering, if Shirou's doomed to always end up as EMIYA, where does all that gained experience he keeps giving himself going, he just seems like such a weird case that it feels like, in some semi-logic, EMIYA should have accidentally created an experience feedback loop.<br><br><br>I think the real problem is that, from an outside perspective, Shirou would be seen as "functionally insane", he seems to be living a fairly decent life, and without the Grail War or getting mentored further, he probably would have been a fairly normal if altruistic and self-sacrificial member of society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and then add in lots of extras i.e. fully flesh out Saber's rule, show us scenes of Saber and her knights, her relationship with Lancelot, the loss of Caliburn, the gaining of Excallibur, the loss of Avalon and then the full battle of Camelann complete with Morgana and Mordred fuckery and they could make it amazing <br><br>Yes. YES. This would be great. Merlin fuckery as well in needed.<br><br>As is Last Episode at the end as the epilogue. If Last Episode is as good as the UBW epilogue I know I will be crying bitch tears.</br></br></br></br></br>  Weekend waifu/husbando drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to take it easy. <br><br>Thread #6:</br></br></br></br>  Requesting *Hyun-ae in a one piece zipper swimusuit.

If you put lots of time into something, figure new things out (bestwith reference) and really trying to improve then you really will learn something. Otherwise you just get faster at drawing things you already can do.<br><br>You're waifu is a cute though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shhh Puchimasu is sleeping    S3 when?<br>videogame when?<br>CG puchis when?</br></br>  I wuv you, puchis.  <br>WAKE UP</br>  Why does Takane not like Takanya?
