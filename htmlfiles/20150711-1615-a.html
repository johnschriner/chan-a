There's also and OVA and a movie I think.</br>  <br>There's a part 2 and 3 and an ova, or maybe those are the same thing.<br><br>I am so confused.</br></br></br>  Crest comes before Banner. Watch both and become a race traitor.  Does anyone here have a chart of this?  <br>there is crest, then banner, then banner II, then an OVA of banner III. you can read the book for banner IV on baka-tsuki.

I actually afraid they gonna ruin it again.</br></br>  <br>yes, but  was the saddest one I've seen in a while</br>  To be honest I think it's impossible to adapt this manga correctly.  <br> Manchild crying over anime adaptation <br> Calling other posters sad <br>Alright.</br></br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great </br>  <br>Hayate S2 was pretty good and that was JC Staff iirc. And I like Shokugeki.</br>  <br>buy the bd gaijin<br> even at showing this anime at 02:00 in the morning they still censor the shit out of it, well fucking done japan </br></br>  <br>fanservice trash with bad art<br>and dropped</br></br>  <br>JC staff has been pretty good in recent years. They were the studio that did the WIXOSS series and that was incredibly well produced.<br><br>I blame the director for this one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dumb frogposter kill yourself.<br>Fucking cancer of summer.</br></br></br>   Best girl  <br> Kanahana <br>I love it.</br></br>  I think JC Staff did fine on this. The story was totally different than what I thought though. I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following. Instead it is mostly PLOT with S&amp;M shit going on. <br><br>I am not with the whole "let a female beat you up" type thing. Where I come from we slap hoes. Beat the shit outta em.</br></br>  Jitsui wa ep1 WAS good. I am not going to let one shitposter in a Prison School thread change my opinion. It was one episode and the entire adaptation was shit? Fuck You.  im an animeonlyfag why are people hating this  <br><br>You gotta be. Bones is an expert ruining final chapters.</br></br>  <br>read the manga.</br>  <br>Cause they censored it.</br>  <br> I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following <br>read the manga.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with that coloring? Holy fuck, sasuga JC.</br>  <br>the manga art looks fucking shit stop being butthurt because the studio fixed the shitty design</br>  <br>I haven't watched this or read the manga, but the one on the left is clearly better. The one on the right looks like the artists have never seen the manga.</br>    <br>oh okay thought it was about something else</br>  The manga is cheap garbage, so I don't know why everyone is so upset.  <br>It's people who only checked it for the lewdity rather than the story.</br>  <br>my eyes</br>  <br>That's fucking terrifying.</br>  What time does this shit air in Japan?  <br>I think it's a japanese time</br>  <br>yeah one of the most dissapointing first episodes this season</br>  <br>Did they follow this guide?</br>  <br>People got excited because tits. It's also oddly popular, because tits.<br><br>Cheap ecchi shows like prison school aren't exactly made for adapting</br></br></br>  <br>That's a parody image, right? They don't actually all have that exact same face, right?</br>  <br> oddly because tits <br> oddly <br> tits <br>reread the manga, there's nothing odd about being excited over tits</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>By that logic 99% of all manga would be popular.</br></br>  <br>What's with the mold on their clothes?</br>  <br> bad art <br>Thanks JC Staff for making the adaptation so bad even secondaries are put off.<br><br><br> that finger positioning <br>What the actual fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> parody <br>nope<br> sameface <br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>Good thing nobody watches it for that then.</br></br>  Is this going to be like Highschool DXD where HS was censored and some shitty fansub group got the uncensored version?<br><br>Or am I going to have to wait for the BDs?</br></br>  <br>HS is doing Okusama ga Seitokaichou! uncensored so I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility.<br><br>But seeing as episode one is censored I guess they won't be.</br></br></br>  Why does funimation exist?  So is the manga lewd enough on it's own or should I seek out doujins instead  <br> seek out doujins instead <br><br>Should we tell this newfag or let him find out on his own?</br></br></br>  <br>I almost forgot this is Summer.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me.</br></br></br>  <br> Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good, that only means that the source is bullshit. <br><br>I can't stop laughing here</br></br></br>  <br>I have jacked off to every chapter of phs</br>   Prison School adaption is terrible <br>NO SHUT UP! I DON'T BELIEVE YOU<br><br>I don't want to believe...</br></br></br>  Apart from the stupid censoring I liked it.  <br>This looks like they tried to capture the art style of the manga, when it just doesn't work in motion.</br>    <br>i feel like the author includes titshots because it's gonna be labeled as ecchi anyway so why not. The story itself is compounded with friendship and brotherhood but mostly comedic circumstances</br>  Was the author able to continue his Devil Blues manga? Or was I dreaming?  <br>it's a fine adaptation. Personally I think the story is moving a bit too quickly to follow at times, but that's what the pause/play function is for, I guess.</br>  <br><br>It looks horrible, and it's censored to hell, which defeats the whole point of a fanservice show. Pure garbage.</br></br>  are you guys kidding? the adaption was fine  <br>Just wait for the BDs, jesus christ. Did you ACTUALLY think the should would be uncensored? Are you that retarded?</br>  Hey, fucking idiots... News flash! AT-X version will be out in 2 days which will be uncensored. Calm your tits.   fat guy has the smallest penis <br><br>This is discriminating actually<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br></br>  adaptations of shit are shit.<br>this season is fucked.</br>  Why didn't they go for 24 episodes? Because of money?  <br><br><br>assburgers detected.<br><br>by "good," he means "faithful."<br><br>this isn't hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably<br>im surprised this even got adapted in the first place</br></br>  <br>Was it confirmed?</br>  <br>Holy shit, I couldn't een tell that was Andre, I thought it was a close up of Jo until I saw him to the right</br>  <br>Then you could've wrote "faithful" instead of "good" my ipchangingburgerlandnewfriend</br>  <br><br>The censorship is the tip of the iceberg. In addition, Monmusu is airing fully uncensored, and is as graphic as this.</br></br>  <br>Can you elaborate on what you mean?</br>   a shitty manga that only sales because of tits has a shitty adaptation because nippons can't animate the female body properly <br><br>What a surprise</br></br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>But that's a worldwide fact<br>Stay mad fat guy</br></br>  Just like with DxD, they were releasing AT-X versions (uncensored) a few days after. You don't have to wait for the BD versions.  <br>I actually read Prison School so the ugly ass anime is a plus. Secondaryfags won't be shitting up the discussion.</br>  <br> that only sales because of tits <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IMPLYING <br><br>Why don't you, ya know, actually read the manga instead of assuming like a dumbass? The art is godlike and Akira really knows how to draw girls in some sexy ways but the story is actually good and funny, better than most shit out there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Danmachi wasn't a good adaptation. It just looks nice.</br>  <br> inb4 muh muh Tsutomu Mizushima is the best director in the industry, everything he touches is gold. <br><br>People need to stop sucking this dude's dick</br></br></br>  <br>I heard the manga went into more depth on it's mmo/rpg like elements but for a short anime adaption, it's fair to cut that out since they just want to get through the story</br>  The art is probably more than half the manga's charm<br>This is going to suck</br>   &gt;Monster Masume adaptation is godlike  <br><br>It's not hard to please people with shitty harem fan service tastes.</br></br>  <br>You're right but the anime seems better than the source material so far</br>  <br> manga <br><br>It's actually the LN, but it really needed that depth for Bell's character. Without it he's just another gary stu with random asspull powerups.</br></br></br>  <br>Well is hard to be worse than a plotless, fanservice, selfinsert manga.</br>  <br>we don't write to please esl's, faggot.</br>  is there some place good to download the manga  <br>I heard google is a good start</br>  <br>google hmmmm ill have to look into this</br>  <br>I love you anon</br>   Gay Shit Staff  <br>what did you expect</br>  <br>They're usually good at comedy.</br>  I'm only on Chapter 22 of Prison School manga but the art is fucking fantastic, I don't even know if you could copy that over in anime to such details.  It was too rushed. Every character was talking as if it had a stick up of his ass. A good comedy needs fucking pauses,you don't slap every joke after the other.<br> inb4 chapters lax of content <br>They nearly adapted a whole fucking volume of material.</br></br>      <br>Maki a fucking piece of shit.</br>  <br> unironically hating best raibu </br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br><br>Not great.  Anime of the season </br></br></br>  The first episode was great, what fuck are you on about  It wasn't bad at all, it felt rushed but the pace should be slower in the next episodes  Yall have to be kidding me right? Yall actually thought this show would be uncensored? They censor nipples and that's not a big deal. Hell I haven't laugh this hard in a very long time. This show is perfect. JC Staff is on a role. The manga is great the anime is great. Love the adaptation   Light <br> Beams <br>They got us good.<br><br>Also, really uninspired work from the VAs. This is going to flop.</br></br></br></br>  I don't care if it's censored to hell or looks like shit. I'm going to watch it for glorious Kamiya MC and angry bitch HanaKana  <br> uninspired work from the VAs <br>Good post anon but let's try that post again without the dicks in your mouth.</br></br>  Fanservice aside, I think JC staff really nailed the comedy parts. I chuckled quite a bit.  <br><br>Ye I thought it was pretty funny</br></br>  <br>I find it hot</br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br>Good joke.<br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br>Almost had me there.<br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> adaptation <br> Bones anime </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  well /a/?  You faggots made it seem like 90% of the fucking episode was lightbeams and steam<br><br>it was more like 5% of the entire episode. I went into it thinking it would be pure TLR level garbage but now im downloading all the chapters to the manga</br></br>  <br>disgusting</br>  <br>tits don't work like that<br>enjoy staying a virgin</br></br>    <br> Being on /a/ <br> Calling one person a virgin </br></br>  <br/>  <br>I'll have to wait for a fansub to compare, but I'd wager it's at least partially funi's fault, their videos always have fucked up colour ranges.</br>  <br>It's only noticeable in the girl's uniforms, after the first minutes it didn't bother me at all</br>  <br>It isn't watch the PVs. It's just the style they went with.</br>  <br> calling somebody a virgin on /a/ <br>Hello, Summerfriend.</br></br>  <br>I'm a virgin myself but tits don't work like that</br>  Feels rushed. I didnt laugh once  <br> now im downloading all the chapters to the manga <br>Good on you. Get ready for great art and I hope you have a lot of tissues to spare</br></br>  <br>This is not a comedy.</br>  Atleast it's funnier than Gintama.  <br>Those faces are scary</br>  <br>Both have different kinds of humour though, don't they? I haven't watched Gintama but I remember reading the first 4 volumes a long time ago and thought it was pretty funny but I wouldn't say it's humour is anywhere similar to Prison Schools</br>  <br>what is it then</br>  <br>A deconstruction of the ecchi harem genre</br>  <br>it is, my animeonly summerfriend</br>   Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br> Himouto Umaru is Godakobo revival <br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> Shimoneta adaptation did not disappoint <br><br>All this fucking delusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expecting ecchi shit to be good <br><br>LOL</br></br></br>  <br>Compared to the manga? Yes, faggot. Read the manga</br>  I'm I the only one who reads Prison School for the antics and happenings? The tits and ass are a plus but if it were censored I wouldn't even give a shit as long as the story and characters stay likable.   Prison School <br> Shoukugeki <br><br>Why is JC so based?</br></br></br>  <br>It was doomed to fail. There's just no way any animation company would have the balls to do what needed to be done to adapt this spiritually and practically.</br>  <br>No, you're not. I like the characters very much.</br>  <br> 4chan browswe <br> Actual consumer <br><br>NOPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not the only one. I first read it for the tits but was pleasantly surprised by the top tier comedy and story progression. All the characters besides Chiyo are actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Yeah i can't get enough of Andre and his fucking face, it blows my sides</br>   VP beats the shit out of MCs mercilessly <br> "No, licking your boot is too much" <br> She actually backs down </br></br>  <br>this show and manga are SHIT</br>  <br> Secondaries </br>  <br>Is this pic from this manga?<br>I was always curious about this pic but never asked about it before.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  That first episode felt really rushed, It's been ages but didn't they just burn through a good couple of chapters?  <br>No, you're not. I couldn't give two shits. It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people.</br>  <br> Monmusu is airing fully uncensored <br>It isn't<br><br>There is still slight censors</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing.<br>I loved that scene where Kiyoshi has to discreetly pass the phone to the president.</br></br>  <br>It is comfrimed? 12 episodes means is going to be shit no matter how you look at it, they going to adapt around 8 chapters into 1 episode.</br>  <br> It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people. <br> Many are watching just for those 20 seconds. </br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but I'd take Monmusu's unobtrusive censoring method over lightbeams any day of the fucking week.</br>  <br><br>and the colors and apparently the art style, personally I enjoy it even though they change some few stuff I wasn't bother by the censor. <br><br>I'm here for the laughs, the fanservice is just a big bonus for me.</br></br></br></br>  If this is 12 episodes and expected to end at their release boy oh boy is it going to rushed as a motherfucker.  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice </br>  <br>For obvious things like pussy. I still saw nipple though.</br>  For what I read, it's going to air uncensored in 2 days right? Though AT-X been shit for most of series this season, why is that?  <br> secondaries <br>nice meme<br>why dont you go back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think this is? You'd have to be blind to miss the fact that every poster on this site and their dog will watch a show just for a bit of fanservice.</br>  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice <br>You have to be fuking me, I love the series but you don't seriously believe people don't watch some stuff just for fanservice do you?</br></br>  Other than the censoring I think it looks pretty okay. <br><br>Sometimes they look like porcelain but it's not as bad as I thought it'd be.</br></br>  The coloring is actually total dogshit. Look at the clothes, why is it that they can't decide if it should have a fade or not? Same with the faces. <br><br>Also the pacing was really fucking bad. They are going to shove like 80ish chapters into 1 cour.</br></br>  <br><br>Decide already.</br></br>  <br>I know people do, but that's a really fucking stupid reason to watch a series.</br>  <br>Prison school is so over the top in its sexuality that I've managed to completely ignore it at this point and only read it because it's funny as shit.<br><br>I never got the appeal of hyper ecchi anyway since at that point just watch some shitty hentai.</br></br></br>  <br> fucking stupid reason to watch a series. <br>Why is it stupid?</br></br>  <br>yeah so far i fucken love the characters and how they interact cant wait for more eps.</br>  <br>Because wasting your time watching an entire series for maybe a few minutes of fanservice throughout it is retarded</br>  <br>That's not really "stupid", At least no more so than watching cartoons for hours on end each day.<br>Watching anime doesn't really have much pay off anyway just watch whatever the fuck you want for whatever reason you want dude.</br></br>  <br>Those two posts are saying the same thing. Reading comprehension, anon.</br>   ecchi shit <br><br>If you watch this garbage you are the cancer killing anime</br></br>  <br>I really can not for the life of me figure out why they decided to color it like that...why couldn't they just go with your typical fucking flat colors? It would look so much better like that</br>  why do some of the MCs sound so autistic?  <br>It's ecchi with a legitimate good story, good characters, good progression, and good humour. The ecchi is just a bonus you fucking retard.</br>  <br>How does one sound autistic</br>  <br> implying I give a shit about the state of anime anymore </br>   A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br> A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys in an entire school full of girls* </br>  <br>It won't be uncensored on AT-X. It doesn't have the same notice that uncensored shows get.<br><br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6206 (※視聴年齢制限あり※)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>5336 (※視聴年齢制限あり※)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6521</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the rest of you, but after watching the episode I wasn't that bothered by the coloring. I think it looks OK in motion, it's when everything is still that it looks like ass.</br>  <br>It's not god awful it's just a really strange thing to do for seemingly no reason</br>  chaos dragon was better than this shit, the manga of course is fucking excellent but i cannot pretend that this adaptation isnt complete shit  <br>CD is better than a lot of shows: overlord, rokka, prison school, LN harem #2, gakkou gurashi, shimoneta</br>    So, we getting around 8 chapters per episode? And you people worried about the censorship??  If they break out of prison by episode 12 that's around 7 chapters per episode, they ended this episode in the middle of chapter 6<br><br>Which means unless they skip some chapters or something, the pacing will be this fast every episode</br></br>  Honestly I really enjoyed the first episode. It could have been better visually but otherwise I think it did the job well.<br><br>I do have similar worries to a lot of anons with the pacing. I think for the early chapters this breakneck pace is fine, but I think having 5/6 chapters per episode later on could ruin it.</br></br>  <br> I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing. <br><br> Him laughing just because the prez told him to was gold.  </br></br></br>  There were a few funny moments but they've destroyed the pacing so badly. Even basic things like conversations had horrible pacing, nevermind the fact that we're already so far in the story. They're probably planning to wrap the whole thing up in a season.  <br>I was hoping that the ridiculous pacing was just so they could get into the prison quick and start the main story so people wouldn't drop it after the first episode but there wasn't a need to rush Hana's introduction so I don't think that's the case sadly :/<br><br>I'll probably give it 2 more episodes to see if the pacing changes because a few things were still funny in there.</br></br></br>  This really doesn't look anywhere near as good as the manga.<br><br>And it's being censored.<br><br>Honestly I'm not even sure if I feel like downloading.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And it's being censored. <br>What did you fucking expect? When was the last tv anime that had tits uncensored? Are you fucking retarded?</br></br>  While it did feel kinda rushed, the comedy was there and it was really enjoyable. Maybe the fact that I've alredy read the manga influences my reaction to it though  <br>I genuinely don't understand what's so bad about this image.<br>The sameface is atrocious but the rest is above average.</br></br>  <br>The colors and art style look fine though don't they?<br>The censorship is bad but other than that seems fine.</br></br>   it doesn't look as good as the manga <br>no fucking shit, that would be borderline impossible<br>it's still probably going to be AOTS and a contender for AOTY, just because it's still much better than any other anime coming out</br></br>  <br>how about you read the manga, stupid</br>  <br> No Sugita <br><br>I miss Jack.  I miss Nichibros so bad. <br><br>School boys SoL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;School girls SoL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, it looks fucking cheap compared to Danmachi or Souma. It's like JC didn't even care to give it a good budget. It has horrible animation too.</br>  Andres voice is terribad, besides that this is fantastic.  <br>Does somebody knows what happened to Me and the Devil Blues? That shit was amazing.</br>  <br>Well haven't seen it yet, only judging by the pictures posted in this thread but I don't see anything particularly bad with the colors.</br>  <br>what kind of shitty filter did JC use, jesus this looks bad or is this intentional since Prison School is supposed to be a trashy show?</br>  It's awful but Kana Hanazawa  I fucking hope they add all the close-ups to the Blu ray  Fuck, only 6 BDs? So it's going to be one cour and rushed as fuck. Nice knowing you Prison School.  <br>what's wrong with you /a/, this was easily a 10/10 first episode. no, I'm not trying to bait. the manga is 11 or 12/10 though</br>  <br>Pretty much. When I read all the complaints I thought the censoring was much worse, but it was just in the close ups.</br>  <br>Let him learn anon. He must learn.<br><br> Either that or spread the glory of daigo. I swear you just have to pretend veep grew up and wants to fug her kid then this doujin works </br></br></br>  <br>You got that right. Just watched the episode 1, what a horrible pacing like the show was on crack or something. Well young jump adaptions are doomed to fail one way or another</br>  <br>I don't even understand why people are so obsessed with the censoring. The scenes were not cut and will be available in the bd edition later on. The truth is this episode was genuinely funny, unlike most other series where gags are so forced that watching becomes awkward</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>AT-X is another channel or distribution system or whatever that releases uncensored shows. Shows that required the nudity for obvious reasons. <br><br>People are pissed prison school gets censored since it's one of the biggest factors of the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow jc staff do uncensor. So it's great then.</br>  <br>It's just a cheap gimmick, while the fanservice is great, it's not the main reason you should be watching Prison School. It actually has a good story, good characters, and good themes underneath the facade of trashiness it displays.</br>  <br>So people are bitching for no reason then? Just wait like two days if you want it uncensored?<br><br>People are fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing, AT-X will NOT be showing this uncensored for some reason. You literally have to wait for the BDs.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I agree. I read it for the comedy I'm probably gonna watch this censored just so I can keep up to date.</br>  <br>But then why is it being shown on that channel?</br>  <br>I guess for people who miss the initial broadcast on whatever channel it was first aired on?</br>  I enjoyed it. It's been a while since anything's made me laugh an actual laugh.<br><br>I love this guy's voice.</br></br>  <br>Well, that was disappointing, dropped</br>  Why's everyone complaining about the pacing? I didn't see a single thing that was cut from the manga, and aside from not being able to match the god tier drawings it was pretty much on point exactly. Not to mention the fact that I like how it's moving at a good clip. Not much happens per chapter.  <br> I didn't see a single thing that was cut from the manga <br><br>Not yet anyway. How are they going to cram 82 chapters in 12 eps?</br></br></br>  <br>6 or 7 chapters an episode, which the're already doing</br>  <br>Oh and forgot pic</br>  <br><br>This, they didn't really remove anything.</br></br>  <br>Didnt someone say they are doing 6 volumes worth so only 60-70 chapters? Might be bullshit.</br>  <br>They cut that one page that had Kiyoshi surrounded by girls at the opening ceremony<br>That's one of my favorite pages too</br></br>  <br><br><br>They removed some scenes and removed dialogue. They made everything go faster than the manga, so of course it'd feel a bit rushed.</br></br></br>  <br>Without quick pacing it won't reach the ending and/or climax.It won't be good isn't it?</br>  <br> always following the live TL <br> watching this and enjoying it so much <br> maybe the most fun I had from this season chinese cartoon <br> all complaining in this thread <br><br>There will be no way of comfortable discussion on this show, wouldn't it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not an excuse for ruining the adaptation. They should have done 2 cours if they wanted to do it properly. Yamada-kun's anime was rushed too, and in the first episodes it wasn't too bad, but on later episodes it was really shitty, so I expect the same to happen with this. That is, unless it magically is in fact 2 cours.</br>  <br>what the fuck am i looking at?</br>  <br> jitsu wa watashi wa </br>   shit animation <br> shit art <br> shit direction <br> shit pacing <br><br>It's like Im watching Terraformers. When did JC Staff turn into LIDEN Films?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> glorious Kamiya MC <br>Faggot detected</br></br>  When I watched it raw, I thought it seemed to go really fast, but after seeing with subs, I don't feel that it's so fast anymore. It's still really funny and I like the voice actors. Also, I think HanaKana did a great job even though a lot of people bitched about it at first. <br><br>Though, it seems that it's mangaonly people complaining along with a bunch of shitposters. I hope all of you drop it by next week so that the discussion can be a little more bearable.</br></br>  <br>Man this post was priceless.</br>  <br>That's a good comparison, in any case JC Staff is dead to me, just going to finish Shokugeki, after Shokugeki I thought they might be the new heroes of anime, but now I just want to bomb them.</br>  <br><br>What he said. Avid lover of the manga and I think this adaptation is great so far.<br>Fucking /a/</br></br></br>  <br><br>BDs faggot, how did you expect this to not be censored on TV?</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking with you there man, I came for the TnA and stayed for the characters and laughs.</br></br>  prison school the #1 disappointment of the summer <br> im ashamed to even mention the anime and the manga in the same post </br>  I see everyone complaining about the censorship, but is the writing still the same? It was pretty bad, I'm genuinely disappointed that I listened to /a/  <br>Well look at what the cock-a-doodle do fella here has to say. "SOOOOOME PIG" he says. Well all be, kids these days.</br>  Why aren't we talking about how great the OP is?  <br> I'm genuinely disappointed that I listened to /a/ <br>Manga =/= anime<br><br>Just read the manga if you don't like the anime. I promise you the manga is actually really good, both in art and story</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story is the same. The early parts aren't as good though, it gets gradually better.</br>  <br>Is it really that different? I disliked basically everything about it I don't see what difference it will make unless the manga massively differs. Which I don't think it does, since there aren't a lot of complaints about it besides a couple of "it's rushed" ones.</br>  <br>What do you mean by "dislike everything"? Can you be more specific? I honestly haven't watched the episode and I can check back in 20 some minutes but seeing some screenshots it really does seem rushed since some stuff definitely shouldn't be in the first episode normally.</br>  The pacing is off because the manga is slow. You cant even get a feel for the characters in the anime like you can the manga.  <br>The manga sometimes borders the hentai line, the jokes come not as extremely unexpected but it's just so fucking ridiculous it makes you laugh. Give the first 20 chapters a try, or I think around chapter 23(?) one of my favorite moments happens.</br>   Apart from those things, Prison School's first episode is pretty distasteful. It trades on unpleasant stereotypes for both the boys and the girls, uses violence as its primary source of humor, and isn't even particularly well animated <br><br> It has this choppy feel that in moments make it look like it came out of one of the psychedelic sequences in a Ralph Bakshi film or something along those lines. It isn't quite like anything I've seen in anime before, and it's definitely trying to match the animation with the manga's intentionally nasty hyper-realistic style. <br><br>Wow...I hate ANN reviewers. Is it possible not to take things so fucking seriously? Also, Hiramoto's art style is "nasty hyper-realistic." Only a total shit head that doesn't know anything about art would say some bullshit like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> caring about ANN <br>Anon either stop it or fuck off.</br></br>   go on /a/ <br> everyone is shitting on the show for being censored <br> watch the episode <br> literally 5 total seconds of censoring </br></br></br>  <br>Who's subbing this?</br>  <br>Because ann reviewers and almost any reviewer these days are sensitive PC trash that can't take a joke at all and everything is offensive to them, some of them have to be retarded just to keep their job.</br>  <br>ANN reviewers are just as shitty as those reviewers who supposedly "love" Japanese video games, In other words, they constantly slam the very media they supposedly "love". Anything even a little bit racy sends them over the edge.</br>  I didn't expect they adapt it this good.<br><br> KanaHana voicing batshit insane mentally unstable girl <br>That alone made it worth watching.</br></br></br>  <br>Why dont you read the fucking thread vermin<br><br>It's bad because the pacing is shit</br></br></br>  Not trying to be a sjw, but I did found the first episode too much focused on the violence, toning down a lot the humour  <br>Naw man you're not alone. It's amazing to read this manga because of just how absolutely retarded the characters can get in it.<br><br>Anybody who's just spouting, "hurr durr generic TnA manga" are just missing out on a great book and it's their loss so whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck does nasty hyper-realistic even mean? Like too real that it's gross or something?</br>  I just want Meiko and Andre to go back to normal in the manga. Anzu should get more screentime too.  <br>I think it's, genuinely, funny and I really like the characters and story. The suspense is great and it's just a good read. People who don't like it for the TnA have sticks up their ass. Also, Americans tend to prefer violence more and get their panties in a rut when there's sex involved.</br>  <br>The pacing is godlike anon, it only seems fast if you're autistic and can't process things quickly.</br>  <br>I don't even know. The art is beautiful. There's nothing 'nasty' about it.</br>  <br>It means the reviewer is a fucking assclown trying to sound smart.</br>  <br>Nick creamer is a faggot, plain and simple. He thinks he's the shit even though he's a greenhorn at ANN. His taste isn't even that good.</br>  <br>How is this not attempted murder? She hit him on top of his head with a metal rod. He could have brain damage. I like slapstick but this is going too far.</br>     this show is more than just generic ecchi shit guys, really <br><br> everyone dropping due to muh censored ecchi <br><br>lol keep being tools you hyprocrtical fags</br></br></br></br>  Go home.  <br>A dick can be an iny and outy like a belie button</br>  <br> First episode <br> Art style is kinda shit compared to manga <br> Voices fit very well <br><br>I'm pleasantly surprised.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all downhill from here</br>  <br> downhill <br><br>I think their voice actors might redeem it for me.  was there a new chapter this week? </br></br></br>  This pacing WHYYYYYYYYY<br><br>This episode was funny but they cut out a lot of the other humorous bits and it pisses me off. It wouldn't be that bad if it was streteched out to 24 episodes, I mean, we didn't even get a proper introduction to the characters. The first episode to me should've just been the first 3 chapters, ending with them getting caught after peeping<br><br>But besides that, personally i'm not a big fan of most of the voices. They don't sound like what I had in my head reading the manga but i'm not going to mark them off for that.</br></br></br></br>   Shits himself and cuts his hair all for a   fig. <br>Why didn't you guys tell me...</br>  <br>No you little attentionfag, you a special snowflake....stop asking the obvious. People are mad at the censoring because is censoring, if you have no idea about the implications censored works means for future works, then just fuck off.</br>  For what?  <br>Fuck off. Why are mangafags always crying? Holy fucking shit. Just go away</br>  <br>OST is shit, bad animation quality, skipping and rushing around and focusing on the "plot" while forgetting that most of the comedy hinges on tension, and voice actors somehow not trying hard enough.</br>    <br>It was funny, the only bad show this season is Classroom Crisis, and you're a fucking faggot for using ellipses.</br>  <br>truth hurts</br>  <br> They don't sound like what I had in my head <br>Maybe because the voice in your head aren't Japanese</br></br>  This is 12 episodes only right? There's six volumes in the official site, and the last one goes from 11th to 12th episode.    <br>I hope so.</br>  I just hope that the jokes don't come one right after the other like in this episode and give me a second to laugh at what was given.<br>I thought it was pretty funny, but it seems a tad fast.</br>  <br>Because mangfags want their favorites to be done justice just like how litfags cry over film adaptations.</br>  <br> I don't know how to read <br>Summer?<br> I always wanted to say it. </br></br></br>  <br>They ruin if for everyone else by moaning and bitching</br>  <br>No it's the pitches of their voices, the sound.</br>  <br>Their voices aren't deep enough for you? Are you some kind of fag?</br>   I legitimately enjoyed this without reading the manga   <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>It's different for each character. Why would you make that assumption?</br>  <br>This is going to be rushed as fuck unless they're ending somewhere completely different from the boys release.</br>  <br>JC Staff did a good job with Shokugeki, we expected more from them for Prison School, we had too high expectations, and now we getting around 8 chapters stick in each episode, no matter how you look at it, this can't be right.</br>  Ｉ　ｈａｔｅ　ｔｈｅ　ｐａｃｉｎｇ  <br>jo packing some god damn heat</br>  <br>Summer?<br>I always wanted to say it.</br></br>    <br>The anime is 12/13 episodes, and aims to shove 80ish chapters into that count.<br><br>The writing is the same but the pacing is on a whole different planet. The writing is fine but the anime is paced like a pile of shit. The first episode put in like a whole volume of the manga</br></br></br>  This shit is Japan's Animal House.  <br>I'm only crying because they packed so much shit into one episode. Adapting chapters like this cuts shit out that I want to see animated. Why would I not complain about that? I don't cry when adaptions are done right and are very faithful, like JoJo for example.</br>  <br>what did they skip?</br>  <br>Is that TNA Roddy Piper?</br>  It was about as good as I expected<br>Animation was the biggest flaw<br>I'm not too worried about the art because it's unreasonable to expect them to be able to animate something on par with the mangas art<br>Joe best boy</br></br></br>  Anime only fags should fuck off  <br>And? There's nothing wrong with that. It's just sad seeing an adaption that doesn't actually adapt everything in the manga. Still, you had to have seen the pacing issues, right? <br><br> introduction to situation with the boys <br> Kiyoshi getting introduced to Chiyo <br> They begin to peep <br> Kiyoshi is seen by Chiyo while trying to get his phone <br> The boys get caught <br> The boys get sent to prison <br> The boys get pissed at Kiyoshi and Prez realizes they enjoy the pain from VP <br> Introduction to Hana <br> Kiyoshi talks to Chiyo <br><br>It's enjoyable but god damn they did so much</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have the worst taste I've seen in a long time.</br>  <br>Best comment so far</br>  <br>holy shit, this is what keeps me away from the manga</br>  <br>They skipped a lot of build up to certain things which makes jokes funnier. For example The eraser scene. In the anime Kiyoshi simply drops it Chiyo notices it with Kyoshi thinking how he hates his mom for picking it. In the manga it builds up with Kiyoshi thinking to himself about the whole prison situation then how much he hates the stupid eraser his mom picked out, saying how he hates wrestling and such THEN he drops it and then curses again as Chiyo drops it, the joke is funnier when Kiyoshi says he loves wrestling after class because of all the build up of Kiyoshi hating his mom and his eraser and wrestling. That's just one example. Go and read the first 9 chapters of the manga and you'll see what they skipped</br>  <br>Seeing those scenarios written out like that does make it seem a little rushed. I was honestly hoping they would keep the suspense for what seemed to be a mysterious Hana. <br><br>Nonetheless, it got me interested and now I'm going to pick up the manga. Probably what the anime producers want from the japs anyway</br></br></br>  Be quiet now.  <br>Next episode will probably end with kiyoshi pissing on hana if they're doing 6-7 chapters an episode. I can see a ton of content cut if they're aiming for release of the boys ending.</br>  <br>Don't think so, dude.</br>  <br>NO</br>  Why is this anime so fucking terrible?  <br>2 cours is a risky moves. Harem anime has a lot of competitor unlike some other genre. Not saying the other genre is bad but the quantity of harem anime each season is considered quite a lot .</br>  <br>Bad studio adapting bad source material</br>  <br>No risk.</br>  <br>better version</br>  End of the line.  <br>Good thing this isnt harem.</br>  The pacing isn't that bad. Cool your jets.  <br>Good, you'll probably enjoy it more than the anime adaption so far.<br><br><br>I hope that doesn't end like that next episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it not bad?</br>   Watch anime with no expectations or prior knowledge <br> Genuinely find the jokes, characters and voice acting to be charming and funny <br> Know that I can go read the manga at any time <br>Life is good.</br></br></br>   Prison School thread <br> half of it was shitting on Jwww <br>is it really that bad?</br></br>  <br>You can still easily figure out what's going. It's not like they are skipping anything really important from the manga. People already know what's supposed to happen.</br>  <br>Have you read the manga? This is blatantly harem. You must be reading a wrong manga.</br>  <br> I hope that doesn't end like that next episode <br>It will.</br></br>  <br>Don't look at me like that.</br>  <br>I only see 2 girls attached to the mc not the entire female cast.</br>  <br> Main character is interested in one girl while another girl is in love with him <br>You don't know what a fucking harem is.</br></br>  It's not working.  <br>and 1 of them can barely be considered more than friendzone status.</br>  <br><br>Idk man, they've been killing it this year with adaptations. They look like a poor mans IG this year.</br></br>  <br>Friendzone better than frenemies.</br>  <br>Or you must be reading the manga wrong.</br>  <br>  fucking <br>Can you type normally and not sound like edgy teenager? Now google what harem is and lurk more before posting.</br></br>  I really hope we get to see Hana get pissed on  <br>Likely.</br>  <br>Hold holding when</br>  <br>Are you talking about Chyo? Because I think it's fair to say that they like each other, Kiyoshi just hasn't made his move yet. I mean as far as we know Chiyo doesn't interact with any other boys besides the main 5 and she's hung out and talked to Kiyoshi the most and obviously likes him</br>  Read the guide before posting.<br> <br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Ill wait for GSC version</br>  <br>How can both OPs get the guide link wrong?<br><br>I think it's http://buyfag.moe</br></br></br>  <br> mad because they left out the http:// </br>  <br>Unless you're using something from the distant past the http:// isn't necessary.</br>  <br>god damn i've never fapped so hard to a figure before.

This is also affected by box size too.</br>  <br>The best part is the one that made it to the US already is going to be at least twice if not three times the size of the one that's still waiting.

You have to be completely and utterly deluded to think her 1/3 looks even close to decent. Fucking Griffon 1/3s look better.</br></br>  <br>The one on the right looks a lot better. Less fat on that pig and face/head looks a tad rounder and cuter.</br>  Does anyone know the release date for the 5th anniversary K-On Yui Figure? Also, why do they need a whole year between Azusa and Mugi to release?  <br>Are you talking about this one? She's at least 6,800 yen to ship.</br>    <br>What about the 1/3 looks better? Her skin has a sickly grey tinge to it, hair is oddly spiky/sharp, her bikini is too loose and has no detail (way too obvious she's a cast-off), and she was sculpted by someone who obviously has no clue how fat works.</br>    <br>Pochaco would look alot cuter if she wore more clothes.<br>Also  is right about her skin tone being awful.</br></br>  <br>Who dis?<br><br>Who dat?<br> Ribbed sweater fetish here I come. </br></br></br></br>  <br> has no clue how fat works. <br><br>Or gravity. Her breast don't look perfect, but they look like they weight and the bikini is helping them stay in place, but the ones on the 1/3 are like floating there saying fuck gravity.</br></br></br>  <br>oh is that all. my 1/8 figures cost that much to ship i was expecting like 200k lmao</br>  is it normal for there to be no changes in order status 24 hours after a purchase has been made?

No dress can adequately contain pork chops.</br>  <br>The difference to the United States between EMS and RSAL is only like 6-8 dollars. <br><br>I rather pay those extra 6 dollars to get a package in 3 days versus a possible 7-30 days.</br></br></br>  Everybody who is not a porkchop chaser has been driven away by the whaleposting.  <br>I there anyway to preorder this yet? It looks amazing but I can't find anything about it.</br>  <br>Anything in the Eight-Six crate or is just a storage box?</br>  <br> They ruined it <br>What exactly is the problem?</br></br>  <br><br>Alter changed the design of the dress to hide her butt, even though they got people excited initially by showing us a figure which you could see her cute butt. You know, like all of their borderline lewd figures.</br></br>  <br>Did you try reading?</br>  <br><br>They're folding crates, so nothing in them and they shipped in folded form. I'll probably use them to store detailing stuff.<br><br><br>Pretty sure it came from Levitz, but they're not around anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its 8 months between Smoogs and Slutcat.</br>  <br>This is so autistic it's cute</br>  <br>At 2kg it's around $15 difference. If you get a lot of packages it's worth it to use RSAL when possible.</br>  <br>She is still just an unpainted prototype. Usually you can't place a preparatory order until after an item has been painted. Follow skytube on twitter if you don't want to miss any updates.</br>  <br> They're folding crates <br>Oh. That makes a hell of a lot more sense than how I always imagined they were shipped.</br></br>  <br>11</br>  <br>They ship like this</br>  <br>Holy shit that is a whole new level of leg welding.</br>  <br>Autism at it's finest.</br>  <br>I wish I could find something like that locally for storing smaller figure boxes. All the containers I find have rounded edges or wheels so things don't fit nicely.</br>  <br> having expectations is now "autism" <br>The word has lost all meanign.</br></br>  <br>Good idea on the baby clothes m8.<br>Im going to start buying dresses at Goodwill, hopefully I don't get any weird stares.</br></br>  When?  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Fluffy</br>  <br>Getting upset about minor things on a figure that don't actually affect the overall quality or appearance of the figure is fucking retarded.<br><br>That picture bitching about Mikan's bathing suit and how far or not far it might come down to the top of her thigh is pure autism. Especially when you're taking pictures of different quality/lighting/angle.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been staring at my email inbox since the beginning of the month. Soon, hopefully.</br>  Pochaco in a see thru nightgown!<br>Why are see thru clothes so much lewder?</br>  Koto previewed Ougi  <br>After all this pork chop posting I think that I am starting to appreciate her body type. It is a shame about her face.</br>  <br>what the fuck is this for real? i thought she wasn't even a fucking vocaloid or whatever</br>  <br>Agreed. I'm sure Alter's has better production values but the sculpt itself is just not great.</br>  That is pretty big discount.  so he's fucking exclusive but my question is, can a sigle person buy 3 of them or just 1?<br><br>any information about him would be appreciated!</br></br>  <br> i thought she wasn't even a fucking vocaloid <br>How mean.</br></br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>327295</wbr></br>  <br>i was refering to kasane teto, not IA</br>  <br>holy shit, didn't know utau's were relevant at this point since miku is always getting a huge amount of merch almost every month<br>thanks btw</br></br>  <br> no one wants it that's why </br>  <br>It's 5 pieces of plastic that were popular at /m/ 3 years ago.</br>  <br>shit thats cute</br>  <br>teto was born on my birthday, if she gets a scale or a prize figure I kind of want her</br>  <br>Did you just draw that? That's cute, would buy.</br>  <br>Those sleeves look incredibly stupid.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>funny thing is this is probably the type of body my father likes</br>  <br>Fuck you faggot. they are cute.</br>  <br>Buy him one</br>  <br>They're oversized sleeves on a shirt that otherwise fits her perfectly. It looks ridiculous.</br>  <br>maybe after my mom dies</br>  <br>He has good taste in women I see.</br>  <br>They put it back on the front page of amiami 2 days ago so it'll probably be released soon</br>  <br>That's very cute, anon. Nice drawing. <br><br>I'd love to see some figures of Pochaco in cute clothing. Sonico has a few so there's hope.</br></br></br>  <br>even lily has a scale and she's no relevant so yeah maybe teto will get at least a prize just hope for wonfes to deliver</br>  <br>By that logic Alter's Kotori could be released by the end of the month too, since she's back on the front page as well.</br>  Ordered! Thank you for the help earlier anons.  <br>It's just the attachments, not the figure itself.<br>Get the fucking FMCS Deluxe set instead, it comes with the figure, all 40 attachments, and a display stand. I was dumb enough to get one for $80 when they came out, now they're on Manda for $20 plus shipping. And it's a fucking web exclusive, too.</br></br>  <br>Did you order from AmiAmi? How big would they make the box to ship this?</br>  <br> Pochaco will never wait for you to get home so she can help you relieve your pent up sexual frustration  <br>kind of hurts to live right now</br></br>  IT'S THAT TIME OF THE MONTH AGAIN! <br>This month's edition features Pluto! <br>(Also, New Horizon is going to fly by the real Pluto in a couple of days!)</br></br>  <br>The purple and green compliment eachother quite well. I am pleased.</br>    <br>I still do like these, but it would be better if they did the outer scout's henshin rods too.</br>  ITT: Badass MCs.

What did you think?<br><br>Also we get it sourcefags, nothing could ever compare to the quality of your glorious literature.</br></br>  It was good.  <br>Was better than expected. Hope they won't censor the shit out from it as they did with Gate.</br>  All in all, it was good.  <br>ending volume 1 atm, what shit?</br>  <br>Lord of Bones sitting on his ass monologuing. Animating things is hard.<br><br>It was your typical Madhouse level of lame.</br></br></br>  I know one of you fags has the webm of the dark elf kid pulling his skirt down.  <br>Why are you acting like sourcefags are going around complaining. There isn't a sourcefag who didn't know So-bin's art would be pretty much impossible to animate who didn't get the expectations appropriately leveled.<br>Plus there aren't a lot of sourcefags complaining about the pace so before you try to shit things up, do your research properly.</br></br>  <br>Why is it that Madhouse is so shat upon?<br>Because they have made some shit shows? Just like every studio? Why are Madhouse singled and hated for not being perfect?</br></br>  <br> Why is it that Madhouse is so shat upon? <br>Because they're usually very cheap with animation and editing.</br></br>  <br>Ever since they got the OPM anime the amount of haters on /a/ tripled. Popular and 4chan don't go together.</br>  <br>Pretty much this. Even if the anime doesn't look good it still managed to surpass my expectations. Looks okay, there's not much reason to complain. The only thing I really disliked about the first episode was that action scene of when Nazarick was invaded by players. They could have given a small tour of Nazarick with a few flashbacks in between showing how lively it used to be. I would have been more than okay with using stills for those flashbacks.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure every sourcefag pointed out the filler battle was lame though. That is a fault on Madhouse's part no matter how you look at it.</br>  Solid first episode, especially considering the series uses the so easily fallible IRL-to-MMORPG setting.  <br>Your picture is the only reason why I'm watching this mediocre show.</br>  <br>Did he get a boner?</br>  It's shit.<br> I like it. </br>  <br>The battle was lame though, it served no purpose at all. CGI skeletors didn't even look good.</br>  im the only one trying to figure out the mysteries of overlord?  <br>That battle never happened in the source to begin with. Do you not know what filler means?</br>  <br>Idk I guess hes refering to the slime scene?</br>  <br>I know, but filler can be good if implemented right. Like say, for whatever reason they can't get to PA because of pacing issues, but they throw in a filler to show PA talking with Ainz, probably just the two of them.<br><br>It serves a purpose in introducing an important character that otherwise wouldn't be introduced. Fillers can serve a purpose, this didn't, it was bad not because it was filler, but because it was useless and looked lame.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't be so tsun-tsun</br>  It was actually better than expected. 7.510<br><br>Papa Bones seems like he's gonna be based.</br></br>  So this is the new season of SAO, huh. Great.  <br> You know, the fact that Ainz body is that of a normal skellington is really hard for me to accept when his equipment makes him look so fucking huge.</br>  <br>ayyyyyy<br><br>LMAO</br></br></br>  <br>At least Madhouse is generally good at handling low budget without resorting to QUALITY.</br>  <br>Wasn't that completely factually incorrect anyways, showing Momonga using the staff of AOG?<br>And I didn't understand why they would do battle at the dungeon entrance, unless that was all just a spooky greeting.</br></br>  <br>They sometimes greeted raiders at the entrance who they know weren't worth entering the guild.</br>  <br>he's a big guy, for a skeleton<br>Also, episode two is Tuesday right?</br></br>  <br>Sure but without the staff. The last day of the game was the first time Momonga ever touched the staff.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I was just answer your second sentence. Momonga never touched the staff, shit's dumb.</br>  <br>Pretty sure episode one was just a preview episode to lure us in. The fact that we can see the Guardians chatting in the preview for the second episode implies this.</br>   Demiurge <br> Pronounced Demi-ur-gus <br><br>My autism.</br></br></br>  <br>All we told you is that the MMO elements were mostly just a set-up and don't play a major part in it (so you don't have to worry).<br><br>that and the designs would never be as good as the glorious illustrations, but that's asking too much (at least it's not the manga).</br></br></br>  This fucking show.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K2r<wbr>wxs1gH9w</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Does this turn into haremshit? I just want to watch a show about a big spooky skeleton taking over the world, not him groping his followers.  <br>Fag.</br>  <br> What did you think? <br>I think I'm in love with Albedo.</br></br>  <br>Albedo and Shalltear want his dick, I think so does Aura. He daughter-zoned everyone and usually their advances toward him are played for laughs. There's still a lot of him being spoopy skeletor and doing spoopy skeletor things.</br>  <br>Show is good but threads are fucked</br>  <br>It's game over man, game over</br>  <br>Literally beyond super hero anatomy. Average ribcage is about 1.2 heads wide. Papabones is like 3 heads wide.</br>  <br>That ending made me feel some things.</br>  <br>http://crossfade.io/#!/zmtnt7j93j</br>  <br><br>I need more of her.</br></br>  <br>I hope they make a Figure for her. I'll buy it in a heartbeat.</br>  <br>I'd buy an Ainz figure.</br>  <br>orange juicing</br>  <br>Episode itself was fine, but what the fuck was up with the Funi fps going mad?</br>  Reminder that vol.5 translation should be releases today.  <br>well, tomorrow for me.</br>  <br>Should've change her name to Libido</br>    <br> Also we get it sourcefags, nothing could ever compare to the quality of your glorious literature. <br>Finally, acknowledgement.</br></br>  I don't know which one is the worst name: Momonga or Nigredo.  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>well, Nigredo is an actual name. Part of alchemy I think. Fly Squirrel is just silly though, but the Japanese have weird naming conventions anyways.</br>  I might actually read the source material tonight since I won't have a computer on me<br><br>You guys better not be lying about it not being shit</br></br>  <br>You're the only one who can decide that anon</br>  So, is she a fallen angel or a succubus?  <br>Dick has transcended muh.</br>  <br>Neither, she's a semen demon</br>   all of the Overlord torrents on nyaa obliterated <br>Fucking why</br>  <br>It's not like any of them were good or anything.</br>  Does Momomga has a dick or would he has to make one with his magic stick?  <br>Nyaa crashed or something earlier.

Probably would've liked her in a different show though</br></br>  <br><br>Well I guess now I get to be the only one with subs up, prison or no ᐛ</br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>Shitime is that you?</br>  <br>In the flesh.</br>  <br>in a very deep discussion about this atm, would appreciate answer</br>  <br>What broadcasting raws you used, nigga?</br>  <br>So Space Marine anatomy?</br>  <br><br>I guess.</br></br>  <br>Leopard, they didn't have that annoying frame rate shit. On my end, at least.</br>  <br>She's an imp with some other racial levels.</br>  <br>He's probably have to use Wish Upon a Star since illusion magic would only give the illusion of a dick, but not a produce a real one, and I think the illusion disappears once there's physical contact.</br>  <br>Does that mean Albedo is a NTR object, because Mr. Skelleton cant pleasure her ?</br>  <br> Leopard <br>So still ATX's one. <br><br>Guess we're still waiting for BS11 one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry bro, it's the best materials I had on hand ᐛ<br>With any luck, that other group of anons will finish, the good shit will get released, and then we'll have some choice options.</br></br>  <br> Using the ring for something this dumb <br>He only has 2 left, without consuming himself.</br></br>  <br>He knows the spell him self and isn't limited to teh ring. the ring is just free wishes rather than Exp cost</br>  Was getting stuck in the game explained in the LN yet or is it just something glossed over like most ni this genre  <br>Glossed over in the LN as well. The LN does seem to imply that other [Players] were also transported, but at different times and locations. At least 2 of the original 13 heroes that defeated some Demon Lord thing were [Players].</br>  <br><br>right now we know he isnt the first person who arrived and the other players possibly formed the basis for magic and martial arts in the new world but thats it</br></br>   tfw you will never be a skeleton   <br>Again, it's not a game anymore.<br><br>Momonga does say something about how being in his Lich body feels right and feels like that's how he was supposed to be. Could be a "returning people to their rightful place" sort of thing. Like in 12 Kingdoms.</br></br></br>  <br> groping her titties is an important test to understanding what is going on </br>  <br>well, it kind of was.</br>  <br>Got to make sure we aint in the game anymore.</br>  <br><br> weird naming conventions <br><br>It's a fucking videogame<br><br>I named a characters "Jerkins" in WoW once and my friend named his characters things like "Badmiral" and "Manaconda"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it more a fantasy world sort of cross pollinated with things from the game?<br> It seems like it was it's own world just littered with some things that came from the game, probably from people who were transported before the MC.</br></br>  <br>It's wasn't an R-18 game so those kind of actions would have been prohibited.</br>  <br>It was test to see if it was still a game. If it was, the system would have blocked it as sexually inappropriate at least that's what we can infer from his monologue during the groping. <br><br> I want to albedo Albedo's albedos. </br></br></br>  <br> not giving them appropiate fantasies names or names related with their race/class/whatever <br> I find your lack of autism disturbing.</br></br>  <br> no one posts the comic with the skeleton king and adviser making bone jokes </br>  <br>*fantasy</br>  <br>The best part was that it was an RPPVP server<br><br>Fuck the law</br></br></br>  <br>This. Also, its going too slow by like 3 minutes. Im worried that they are going to have to rush the fuck out of the last episodes</br>  <br>Are you telling me that people are going to start hating wanpanman now? That's disappointing, if it does happen then this board is well and truly full of faggots.</br>   Albedo is the fraction of solar energy (shortwave radiation) reflected from the Earth back into space. It is a measure of the reflectivity of the earth's surface. <br>Will this have an effect on the plot somehow</br>  <br>Demonic skeleton infused with death magic, that chin isn't natural.</br>  <br>It's going to be shit because they decided to use Murata's art. There's no chance in hell they got a big enough budget to do it justice.<br><br>The exact same thing happened to the Eyeshield 21 adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>it's quite dashing though</br>    <br> It's not that "albedo", its the alchemical albedo.</br>  <br>Wouldn't people complain if they had used One's art too? There really wasn't any way this was going to turn out well.</br>  <br><br> More info<br> In alchemy, albedo is one of the four major stages of the magnum opus; along with nigredo, citrinitas and rubedo. It is a Latinicized term meaning "whiteness". Following the chaos or massa confusa of the nigredo stage, the alchemist undertakes a purification in albedo, which is literally referred to as ablutio – the washing away of impurities. In this process, the subject is divided into two opposing principles to be later coagulated to form a unity of opposites or coincidentia oppositorum during rubedo <br> In other words, Albedo a perfect and pure waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has she been warm and caring to anyone besides Bone King?</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnu<wbr>m_opus_(alchemy)</wbr></br>  <br>Her lore was that she was a slut but it's not like that affected the npc programing.</br>  <br>So she has at least 15 levels invested in other race or races.</br>  <br> Albedo will never rubedo your dick </br>  <br>We know she's also a succubus at least since that's her current form, and then there's the starfish/gorilla true form.</br>  <br> Albedo is literally a succubutt blackguard <br>It took us decades, bros, but we're finally in the promised land.</br></br>    <br>That's volume 15.</br>  <br>gooood. My collection is growing.</br>  <br>Isn't it meant to look like an Egyptian death mask?</br>  <br>if it is, it's not been mentioned in the TLd chapters.</br>  <br> Process is nigredo -&gt; citrinitas -&gt; albedo -&gt; rubedo <br> nigredo is ugly <br> citrinitas is unknown <br> albedo is beautiful <br> rubedo is said to be the strongest NPC <br>Rubedo must be the fated ultimate waifu then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked the first episode. I really liked the dark fantasy vibe it gives. This and Attack on Titan both do well to craft a dark fantasy to enjoy. I also see that this series is becoming more popular. Overlord is almost the Attack on Titan of light novels.</br>  Is it wrong that I quite like that important (side) characters get offed with no discrimination on which side they are. The MC and his posse are almost impossible to kill. Plus I really dislike deries that do the whole Russian Roulette killing of their main characters. Side characters are fair game. Especially the good ones that get offed. Villains death are a fait accompli so it's the good side characters' death that hit hard. Especially when you least expected it.<br><br>Why am I going on and on about this? Because if rumors are to be believed, our one and only  Gazef  bit the dust in volume 9. How horrifying. RIP in pieces.  Here's to hoping Ainz brings him back. </br></br>  Will the episode previews be removed from the mediafactory channel at some point?<br><br>Very curious.</br></br>  <br><br><br>fallen angel</br></br></br>  <br> I really liked the dark fantasy vibe it gives. <br>It's getting progressively darker each volume. I hope Madhouse doesn't take the comedy route in its adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't be surprised.<br><br>Nigredo is pretty nice once you get past her spiel.</br></br></br>  <br>She is a Fuccubus!</br>  <br>You say that, but its meaningless if they can just be brought back to life.  I wish Shalltear had stayed dead </br>  <br>no, THIS is a fallen angel</br>  <br>*stories</br>  <br>She's my waifu.</br>  <br>Yeah Akame ga Kill was a shipwreck in every sense of the word</br>  <br>Heresy.</br>  <br>The numerous characters that could have been brought back and weren't. It makes sense to try and bring the stronger ones back.  There was no way in hell Ainz wasn't going to bring Shalltear back. Outside of the fact that he needs her, she's like his kid. Which parent is going to leave their child dead if they could bring him/her back? </br>  <br> papa Bones letting his kids die </br>  <br> Imp <br>nandeyanen</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure thye can be revived, MC thought about reviving the girls parents in volume 1 using an item but decided not to</br>  <br>I haven't read the latest chapters, so I can only assume this is secondary talk<br><br>Should have read the manga first, man</br></br></br>  So why is Madhouse putting out two PVs each week?<br><br>Are they actually trying to push this as a product?</br></br>  <br><br>Fine then. Then how about  Kei Sei Koku having a permanent effect and forcing them to kill her or lock her away? </br></br>  <br>fucking kek every time I read Papa Bones.<br><br>Currently in chap 1 of volume 2, any progress between the dickless man and Albedo?</br></br></br>  <br>She tries to rape him eventually</br>  <br>There's progress with Albedo in bed, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>I wish there will be more of Albedo's fanart in pixiv.</br>  I don't get it, the MC is a Mary Sue just like Kirito but you guys love this shit. What the hell is going on?  <br>It brings up how weird it was that the resurrection item he used to  bring back the Lizardman hero-guy  lowers levels to use it, as a penalty.<br><br>In MMOs of any sort, levels are shit as hell to accumulate after you pass the noob stage. Why would Yggdrasil have such a useless item that RES'es you at the cost of hard-earned levels?<br><br>It makes me glad he didn't revive the slaughtered villagers. It could have gotten fucking weird as hell fast (especially if it didn't work).<br> though I suppose questioning items made up for the express purpose of forwarding the plot and "fit" into the setting rather than the other way around is my own idiocy </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you watch a few more episodes before you jump to conclusions you flying faggot.</br>  <br>He's not an angsty teenager?</br>  <br> If even one of the eight greed kings is alive, they can probably solo Ainz </br>  <br> Just got to hit him with that "All goal of life is death" </br>  <br>"ycrem fo slegna sih ton , htaed fo slegna s'rorepmE eht era eW" [True, but she still angels material]</br>  <br>Ainz isn't someone to self-insert to. He also has no special god-powers that were just coincidental to him alone; it was just his PC avatar after being an MMO nerd for years. <br>He's also a fairly pathetic person internally, and more of a side character than his own servants (who, in general, are the real main characters), he's passive (and paranoid as fuck, albeit with good reason).<br>Also, the setting isn't really about a game-world; it's a "real" world that just happens to have a rough physical scenario that has magic as a practical/scientific field, rather than an occult/imaginary one.</br></br></br>  <br>She gets grounded for it.<br><br>Kirito wasn't a goddamned skeleton nor was he a wage slave.</br></br></br>  <br>It's because he's a spooky skeleton.<br>If Kirito was a spooky skeleton, SAO would have been a 10/10 anime. Just try to deny it.</br></br>  <br>Actually, that spell was shit in game because other players carry rez items.</br>  I like how the guy basically wrote a small novel in backstory and then just added "Also she is a giant slut." at the end.  <br>And that sex with Asuna would have become very interesting</br>  <br>like an afterthought</br>  <br>Self rez. Can't rez yourself if you're dead.</br>  <br>"!semem knad eseht hctaC" [I disagree, she is a more of a slutty devil]</br>  <br>Gary Stus are honestly only bad when they're also boring moralfags. Like Kirito, for example.</br>  <br>Overlord's MC:<br> is a skeleton <br> has a hilarious gap between his pretending to be an almighty being and his wage slave personality </br></br></br>  <br>I really liked that bit of artistic direction to make that HUEG character bio (which would be even longer in English, since there's no kanji to abbreviate longer descriptions).<br>Though I'm sort of wondering what sort of man considers it moe to find a gap between "a beautiful, merciful angel of destruction" and "cockloving slut" (which is what "bitch" in Japan translates to).</br></br>  <br> [AU] <br>Is this the best version so far?</br></br>  Why the hell are you guys responding to his bait?  <br>ISIS has the best subs.</br>  <br>It's still got that jittery framerate shit, you probably wanna wait until the good raws are released</br>  Can we guess who Momonga was close to in the guild, other than Peroroncino?  <br>It's something to do. Not even really bait, just something to think on.</br>  <br> Also we get it sourcefags, nothing could ever compare to the quality of your glorious literature. <br>obviously you never read the LNs, they're written about at the level of an 8th grader with Chunni. <br><br>Listen, all the books are is the author fanwanking about the perfect lichking and what he'd do in a world filled with normal npcs. which is be the fucking undead godking of the universe. <br><br>seriously, the only reason why people like this shit is for the decent waifubait in the cast and the enjoyment of watching the MC pwn everything without breaking a sweat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still no raws <br>Why the fuck didn't we get the real raws? Is the Funimation version the only shit available?</br></br>  <br>The backward spelling is confirmed to be a choice of the translator. The actual dialogue is gibberish.</br>  <br>That's it.</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much. It's a fucking tragedy.</br>  <br>Define "boring moralfag"<br><br>Moralfags in and of themselves aren't boring</br></br></br>  <br>We have raws. ATX ones are out and leagues better than Funi but it's still shit.</br>  <br>It's because he's a skeleton, and he's very compassionate when it comes to taking care of his "children", but still willing to do anything that's necessary to protect them and Nazarick. Maybe his questionable lich morality as well.</br>  <br>"tluda na m'I uoy kcuF" [I know, I just find SkyTheWood's dank memes funny]</br>  <br>He is a complete MMO nerd who had played the same game for 12 fucking years and wasted 1/3 of his earnings on ingame shop. He literally has no special talents. He even makes tremendous mistakes.<br>There is a lot to complain about Overlord but Ainz is not one of them.</br></br>  <br>"semem eseht lla dloh I t'nac yhw"[She no longer a slut after having her characteristic changed by Ainz, and only love him]</br>  <br>Did you reply to the wrong person?</br>  <br>Really? What about Touch Me? Or Simmering Teapot?<br>Speaking of, who were the other 2 female members other than ST. I know one was Ankoro Mocchi Mochi but I wonder who the last one was.</br></br>  <br>No I just failed to see the sarcasm because it's 6:47 am and I didn't get a wink of sleep. I apologise.</br>  <br><br><br>So did she realize he has no dick?<br><br>or she already knew?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz also knew Tabula well...I think he liked all the members TBH</br>  DARK<br>ELF<br>BOI<br>PUSSI</br></br></br>  <br>More like she doesn't care.</br>  <br>Touch Me is what Ainz is to the Guardians. The best leader in the world. Simmering Teapot was Pero's sister and love teases her brother and everyone of his friends. I don't think they were that close.</br>  <br>Oh, I wasn't being sarcastic, I'm serious.<br>If Kirito was a skeleton, SAO would have been 10/10 the greatest anime ever produced.</br></br>  <br>He probably had a lot more history with the First Nine though.</br>  <br>I always felt like he was on good terms with Blue Planet</br>  <br>what part of Kirito is a moralfag?</br>  <br>what the fuck, why does she even keep trying then... I mean other than words it's not like he could satisfy her in any other way... his finger... Would mostlikely stab her.... he doesn't even have a tongue... and he's dickless... Ainz is literally the definition of suffering</br>  <br>*the others of the First Nine, I mean.</br>  <br>What a faggot.</br>  <br>I'm sure he was on good terms with everyone but I think anon wanted to know if he was close to them. <br><br>Like if you were underfire in Detroit and called them up for backup, would they come kind of close.</br></br></br>  <br>You're fucking retarded if you think ONE's art should be shown on television.</br>  <br>hey man, in Detroit, it's every man for himself.</br>  <br>Yamaiko's the third female member.</br>  <br>Making protagonist a skeleton would make any anime better.<br>I'm absolutely serious.</br></br>  Is any fansub group subbing this/picking this up?  <br>And you believe that is Albedo's true form? Monster loving is some sick shit Anon.</br>  <br>But Aura is already the best elf.</br>  <br>Maybe bland harem lead or boring nice guy would have been a better descriptive.</br>  <br>I think it's Lucier</br>  <br>Moralfags have little to do with actual morality, but with their trust in their beliefs and confidence that they are doing the "right" thing. They are often the most brutal and cruel people in actuality.</br>  <br>U Funi </br>   this and Six Aztec heroes and Shimoneta all have great first episodes <br> but not nearly enough content <br> starving for more <br><br>I wish I had done like I did last season and ignored all the shows until the third episodes were out<br><br>Of course, I think there are a lot more shows that are watchable this season than last season</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Horriblesubs.</br></br>  <br>Nah, Lucifer's male. I definitely got Simmering Teacup, Yamaiko and Ankoro Mocchi Mochi. I could be wrong though.</br>  <br>Not until she fucks her brother while he's wearing his skirt she isn't<br><br><br>You're fucking retarded if you think they're using ONE's art and not Murata's, faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>ONE's the better artist.</br>  OK everyone, here's a list of characters that can beat Ainz, if they don't have any planning advantages:<br> Shalltear, Cherry Blossom Guardian, Rubedo (explictly), any Eight Greed King, The World Dragon (or any serious raid boss that got tele'd), any World Champion </br>  Patiently awaiting Albedo's  Dakimakura  scene.<br><br>What are some scenes you are looking for?</br></br>  <br>While he's occasionally nice to people, it's either because he sees that he'll get something out of it, or because of his children. <br><br>So far, no one's called him out on it, nor does he cares or thinks about morality unless one of his children notes it.</br></br></br>  <br> Solution Epsilon's tits </br>  <br>Papa Bones giving out hugs.</br>  <br> Do we even know nearly enough about the Eight Greed King or the World Dragon to say that? Other than some unimpressive hearsay I'm not sure those guys are all that tough. </br>  <br>His art fits the comedic parts better, Murata's fits the action parts better<br><br>Obviously the art style is different in Mob Psycho and can't be compared to wanpanman</br></br></br>  <br>I like it because I've always loved Liches, phylacteries and shit. There's no setting where skeleton overlords aren't the shit.</br>  <br>What about his supermagical staff?</br>  <br>This. It would make my year.</br>  <br>The answer is Sebastian.</br>  <br><br>shut your whore mouth you slut</br></br>  <br>It reminds me of old /tg/ when quests weren't shit</br>  <br>Shalltear talking about her memories.<br><br>That shit is interesting yo.</br></br></br>  <br> The World Dragon was the strongest raid boss in game, of course it would BTFO Ainz. It's probably the main reason why Ainz is training the Guardians to fight like a team in the Drama CD. As for the Kings, they would be hundreds of years old by this point and likely started at level 100...they're definitely very powerful </br>  <br>Your so serious I can't tell if you missed the sarcasm or I did.</br>  This gives me the feels. Papa skull doesn't care about saving the world, or conquering it. He just wants to see his bros again. Mock it all you want, but those were some of the best times of my life, rolling with a crew that would take on challenges (PVE and PVP) like a well-oiled machine.<br><br>Character-wise, I think they've really captured the mindset of an OG MMO player. You want to build a reputation and/or a monument to the teamwork and skill of your guild, to inspire both admiration and fear. Players see your tag, and know that you are a bad motherfucker.<br><br>It's neither about being a carebear, or the king of the jerkasses. It's about being a capricious demi-god. You see a lowbie getting ganked and tea-bagged by some newly minted mid-level who just unlocked a fun spell and is feeling his oats...<br><br>Maybe today it's beneath your notice. Maybe the ganker emotes a gesture of nominal respect at you, signalling that he acknowledges his inferiority to his better, and you magnanimously let him live. Or maybe you take offense at his impertinent familiarity, and spend the next hour making him very sad. There are few things more enjoyable than popping your cooldowns and striking someone down in a single massive crit, and sending a clear message that they do not know who they are fucking with.<br><br>That's why Daddy Skeletor holds a special place in my heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to bait </br>  <br> If we are going by OP items, any character can beat any character. Ainz mentions two of the 12 strongest WC items as being capable of destroying either him or his guild in short order </br>  So how hard is her rampage in thieves' hideout going to be censored?  <br>this.<br><br>Also Hamsuke.</br></br></br>  I enjoyed the LN but I hope the next 3 volumes change things up about instead of<br><br> *new character throws everything including kitchen sink at nazerick person <br> nazerick person gloats over their inferiority  <br> new character tries to run <br> dies <br><br>im glad fighting isnt a very big part of the book and its more on world building and such</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For the Eight Greed Kings we know they held guild weapons from vol 7's intermission, one that's dangerous enough to bind a dragon lord (who I believe Evileye compared to Momon in terms of strength)<br><br>So in pure conjecture, the kings got guild weapons that can probably kick Ainz's ass.<br/></br></br> </br>  <br> all that shaking and lewd face making <br>This is more than enough for me to keep watching</br></br>  <br>Remember Ainz is sort of a joke build, not really good for serious play or soloing. He's all cash shop equipment and guild items to cover for his weaknesses. Most people of the same level can probably defeat him with preparation and many can beat him without any special preparation.</br>  <br><br> rampage in the hideout <br> not papa bones hug <br> not solutions solutions </br></br></br></br>  <br> Papa bones isn't a self-righteous jack ass who wants to be a brooding loner. </br>  <br>Since I also have same experience, I kinda understand about Ainz suffering.</br>  <br>Volumes 5-9(at least what I've heard of it so far) deals with Kingdom and Empire and Nazarick politics</br>  <br>Still irrelevant since the Dickless man remains...
