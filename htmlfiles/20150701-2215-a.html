[ What do you do when you run out of interesting anime to watch?  I laugh heartily because apparently I forgot for a moment my enormous backlog.<br>At no time have I ever less than 1 month worth of unwatched stuff on my main HD, in case my internet fails for some unforeseen reason.</br>  Jerk off furiously to the corpses of my enemies.  <br>What genres you like? I find it hard to find new interesting anime in my favorites. I suppose maybe I should try to find something that's still airing so I always have something to look forward too</br>  lower your standards  Masturbate and browse /a/.  <br>I've found nice stuff in just about every genre. I don't often go for romance though.<br>What I really want to get into next though is Tezuka. He's a challenge to me. I got stuck in the second volume of Adolf.</br></br>  <br>I read manga, or play vidya, or draw.</br>  Thankfully I can safely say that even if I dedicated my life to just watching anime I will never run out of interesting anime to watch in this lifetime. You don't even have to lower your standards.  shitpost on /a/  Vidya or twitch or something like it  Just marathoned two seasons of Game of Thrones because i fucking finished my backlog.<br><br>My head fucking hurts.</br></br>  <br><br>This, I don't even watch anime anymore.</br></br>  Fuck off with your rec thread.  I'll never run out of interesting anime to watch because I spend too much time shitposting and fapping on /a/   <br> Game of Thrones <br>Read the LN</br></br>  Hold my hand to the moon looking for answers  Think about where my life went so horribly wrong then force myself to watch something shit  <br>I don't run out of interesting anime to watch because I never watch any of the downloaded shows.</br>  <br>I tried this but AFFC is so boring I dropped the series</br>  I feel like I should just quit watching anime except for like one or two, and devote myself to solely posting on /a/.  <br> tonight you'll finally watch this one fucking show <br> proceed to shitpost on /a/ till 10am </br></br>  <br>Yeah, the series kind of drops off after the third book.</br>  <br><br> that shitty image <br><br>You know it has a BD now?</br></br></br></br>  <br> start watching a show <br> browse /a/ during the OP <br> OP finishes <br> pause show <br> continue shitposting on /a/ for hours <br> too tired to finish show <br><br>Sometimes I wonder if I actually like anime at all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every time.

Arslan too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically. Of course, I browse other sites from time to time, but masturbating and browsing /a/ have become staples.</br>  <br>He said "interesting".<br>Half of those existing anime are steaming pile of shit.</br></br>  <br>Shokugeki is decent, you should watch it<br><br>I'd delete Denpa Kyoushi from your hard drive and do a full wipe to make sure its gone, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, don't insult shit like that. My daily diarrhea is much more interesting than 95% of anime out there.</br>  <br><br>You don't know that.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but your daily diarrhea smells of lilies and can play the bass guitar like an African American.</br>  <br>I fap and listened to sad ost.</br>  <br>I do.<br>I'll have you know that I watched over 20 different show already, so I can tell.</br></br>  <br><br>Thought so.</br></br>  <br>I start watching more anime and read more manga. <br><br>I'm currently about to start this, love the mangaka.

Thank you for confirming it.</br></br>   people actually finished their backlogs or run out of anime to watch <br><br>Welcome to /a/, how is your first week here?</br></br>  I visit my backlog, delete a ton of stuff without watching because I'm not interested in them anymore, then pick something to follow.  <br>Some people have standards</br>  Read manga.<br>This time start from the beginning.</br>  <br>Then fuck off and do something you like instead of shitposting on /a/ about how you don't like anime.</br>  I haven't "run out" out good anime, however I've run out of the ambition to continue watching series.<br>However much I may like it, I find it harder and harder every day to sit down and watch 10-20episodes a day.<br>Weekly stuff currently airing is no problem, but christ I can't into my backlog</br></br>  <br> do something you like <br><br>The only thing I enjoy is shitposting on /a/</br></br></br>  <br> just don't care to put any effort into finding new ones <br>Yeah it's not like I spent hours in search of decent films that picks up my interest.<br>There's many of them but few are worth watching.</br></br></br>  Quick post your backlogs <br><br>Mine is<br> none since I'm fairly  new  here </br></br></br>   love modern slice of life <br> finish every good slice of life <br> only option now is to watch a new genre <br><br>I hate this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>watch moeshit and then post about your waifu on /a/</br>  <br>Find a director you like and watch all their films.

It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>Sounds to me like it will first make a connection between Z and BotG and then take on the new arc. I doutbt they'll revamp BotG and RoF like some anons were saying</br></br>  <br>I wonder how different Universe 6 will be to the main one</br>  <br>The way I read it, seems it takes place after the latest movie. "Continues the with the battle of gods arc".<br><br>Seeing them going to new universes is pretty awesome. I just want Uub to show up one day</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I meant. Interconnect Z with BotG and then make the time skip to post RoF.<br> continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. </br></br>  FoG subs when  <br>In b4 a universe where every character is genderbent<br><br> girl goku </br></br></br>  I just realized a plot hole if Super is going to take place before the epilogue of DBZ.<br><br>In DBZ, Goku stated the main reason he decided to train Uub is so he could have such an incredibly powerful opponent to face. However, since the introduction of Gods of Destruction, there are tons of enemies stronger than Goku for him to fight.<br><br>So unless Goku becomes the strongest being in the entire multiverse within 10 years, the epilogue makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6 <br><br><br>what if uneverse 6 is gt universe</br></br></br></br>  <br>GIANT SUPER DRAGON BALLS<br><br>Maybe that 9-star ball on the V-Jump magazine manga adaptation wasn't a mistake!</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Battle of Gods made it so Goku never meets Uub</br>  Wait so will it be starting straight after buus defeat or after RoF? I don't get it  <br>Uub appeared in the tournament 10 years after the events of Kid Buu. BoG doesn't take place nearly as long as that. His meeting with Uub hasn't been retconned.</br>  <br>If Uub is able to harness his potential, he might potentially be greater than any warrior we've seen yet. It remains to be seen. Also, Goku never explicitly stated that, it's just heavily implied.<br><br>Battle of Gods, Super, and Revival of F take place in the 10 years between Majin buu's defeat and the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, where they meet Uub.</br></br></br>  <br>Both. They'll tackle Buu's aftermath first and then move to post RoF</br>  <br> an angry sexy Vegeta with a hard on for Goku </br>  <br>Would you?<br>Could you?<br>Should you?</br></br></br>  <br>it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies.<br><br>Makes you wonder what was the point of the movies, then.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the epilogue has officially been retconned now since it's stated that Goku hasn't seen anyone else since the Majin Buu incident</br>  <br> it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies. <br>What makes you think that?<br>The series will probably assume you have alredy watched both movies and after the post buu arc it will move to the 6th universe arc</br></br></br>  <br>Making money<br>Raise awareness for DB again<br>Making money</br></br></br>  <br>Only parts of it. Uub still happened.</br>  <br>  Hey Kakarot, after this battle how about you come back to my ship and I'll show you my Big Bang? </br>  <br>We'll still get Uub I think but it'll be tailored to fit into the new storyline</br>  <br>I wonder which universe is Future Trunk's.</br>  <br>Actually the epilogue stated it's been 5 years since he met everyone, which is what's covered by BoG. <br><br>Of course, that means he wouldn't be able to meet everyone in Super, which takes place directly afterwards. And that won't happen.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you? <br>yeah, a girl with the same personality as goku would be really cute<br> Could you? <br>idk maybe? i have a lot of energy but im just a human, not a saiyajin<br> Should you? <br>Probably no, but who cares? i would train and fight with her even if it cost me my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. It'll happen in a similar way, but be altered a bit for the new movies. Pan and Bra will be there too, since Pan was in the last movie with Grunkle Piccolo.<br><br> Bra might end up as the strongest hybrid, thinking about it. Veggie has the God ki, and remember how much stronger Trunks got with Vegeta around? </br></br></br>  Ok so it will take place after buy saga before BotG? I hope they don't re-tell it. Love that movie so much, and what's the deal with this new universe? Are the events of BotG told differently in that universe? Will the 2nd arc take place after RoF? Someone explain this to me for I am stupid.  <br>Do you think you could keep Vegeta away from Goku?</br>  All the other universes being just alternate versions of them would be dumb and lazy.<br><br>Unfortunately that's exactly what i expect they will be.</br></br>  <br>Post-Buu<br><br>Timeskip<br><br>Multiverse<br><br>at least that's sort of what it sounds like to me<br><br>there better not be a mary sue version of Goku's mom thought up by the French in there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see   </br>  <br>there needs to be a variation where personalities are completely changed<br><br>like yamcha is an alpha that actually trains<br>vegeta is a complete pussy that only fights when he has to<br>piccolo is a goody two-shoes who is very open and friendly<br>goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything<br>frieza could be an ally in one of the universes<br><br>just a few random ideas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything <br>Goku and Chi-chi single-handedly repopulate the Saiyan race through their fuckin'</br></br>  <br>Only if she's fit, none of this turning a muscular dude into a small skinny waifu crap.</br>  I really dislike the idea of just slightly alternate versions of existing characters in the other universe. I'm ok with maybe some of the top level people such as the god of destruction and some of the kai's being similar looking, but not the regular denizens of the universe.  Okay, so from what I understand,<br> The two new movies are continuations of the manga and introduce the idea that there are 12 universes <br> Movies/manga universe is the seventh universe <br> Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br> Super's first two arcs are retellings of the two movies with some differences like Champa <br> The third arc is a crossover battle with the sixth universe (notice they didn't specify what universe Super took place in, only that the sixth universe were their neighbors) <br><br>It opens the possibility of there being a GT universe, an Online universe, and other things like that where history plays out differently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt really want them to go to a different universe but after Beerus mentioned thered be 12 universes I knew it was inevitable.</br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>Where was this confirmed</br></br>  <br>So it's after BotG? That doesn't make sense considering goku turns SSJ and not SSJGSS, and discovers Beerus for the 1st time in the trailer, unless it takes place in universe 6? Why is there another universe and why can't they just continue the story after RoF? What's the deal with this multiverse arc and are the characters in each universe meeting each other? Maybe after the events of this multiverse arc, the characters that represent their respective universe go their separate ways and then they continue the story after RoF which would mean RoF already happened, right? It would go like this I'm assuming.<br> After Buu <br> after BotG <br> After RoF <br> Zfighters discover new universe <br> see themselves, fat beerus blah blah <br> work together to fight evil threat <br> characters from universe 6 go back home  <br> they continue the story of the main timeline after that <br>Unless it takes place after BotG and before RoF which leads to all of this shit and THEN whis trains goku/vegeta. Then after that, the next arc takes place after RoF. This multiverse thing seems like filler to me, but I guess it could be fun. Am I close or just being retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>What else is in your ass. Please keep taking stuff out of it, I want to see what else you can come up with</br></br>  <br>what if it's like, just the same kinds of races, but not characters?<br><br>like Saiyans are still around somewhere, but there's no Goku or Vegeta or anything, there's like, maybe some guy, who's sort of an asshole but not, named like, Artichoke<br><br>and there are Namekians, but no Piccolo or Guru or anyone, like maybe there's a dude named Mollus, who is a Super Namekian like Piccolo but talks and acts like some sort of bancho punk dude that flies around space getting into WACKY HIJINKS with his crew of oddball sidekicks<br><br>there are still Earthlings, but maybe they're not complete idiots? Also the champion of the Earth is like, a Luchador Cyborg Bear or something silly<br><br>fuck it, maybe the Tuffles are the race of heroes of the universe? Defeating the Arcosians or whatever Frieza's race was called and helping establish a peaceful galaxy. With space-hobbit science.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 takes place only 6 months after Buu.<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You're just being retarded. Its gonna be <br> Z <br> post buu arc (Super) <br> Beerus arc (Battle of the Gods) <br> Golden Freeza arc (Return of F) <br> Rest of Super <br>Can't you guys even read? Or is that too hard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean after BotG?</br>  <br>if i was the son of the ox queen i totally would.<br><br>she promised me!</br></br></br>  <br>No, because BotG took place 4-5 years after Buu.<br><br>Yes, this means chapter 1 isnt consistent with BoG. Its Toriyama were talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>BotG is like 4 years after Buu</br>  <br>They aren't going to waste 2 fucking arcs re-doing the 2 movies. No one is that retarded.</br>  <br><br>I'm saying this because it doesn't fit in with Battle of Gods and Fukkatsu no "F". Beerus was asleep for 39 years at the start of BoG, which takes place in Age 778. That means he's been asleep since Age 739. Super takes place 6 months after the fight with Buu, meaning it's still in Age 774. Despite this, it shows Beerus awake, and recounting his dream about a Super Saiyan God. Champa and his attendant are also important characters early on in the story.<br><br>If the first arc of the story is the Battle of Gods arc, and the time frame is 6 months after Buu, then that means it's not just an extended retelling of Battle of Gods. It's most likely a different universe to the movies, which were said to be continuations of the manga.<br><br>I'm including Kai with Super only because Super is following Kai's broadcast and is meant to act as its successor/sequel.<br><br>Nowhere did they say that Super is the seventh universe. They only said that the sixth universe is the neighbor to Super's universe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Just think In on of the universes GT lays to be unlocked.  <br>I guess I'd be ok with that but I'd still like slightly different races, idk, I'd have to think about it.</br>  <br>Dammit. I didn't sit through two movies (which were great) just for them to give us a prequel series. Seriously what the fuck.</br>  <br>YES THEY ARE<br>READ THE GODDAMN ARTICLE<br>BATTLE OF GODS ARC<br>FUKKATSU NO "F" ARC<br>MULTIVERSE BATTLE ARC<br><br><br>I know it's Toriyama, but this seems like a rather huge oversight, even for him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that, stop putting words in my mouth and actually read the news article</br>  <br>Wheres dat english subbed frieza movie @</br>  <br><br>If they just make Beerus wait around for 4 years for no particular reason they could still make it 99% the same as the movie.</br></br>  <br>Godku would win that no contest. Super Saiyan 4 is only as strong as Super Vegetto, Godku eclipses Super Saiyan 3 Vegetto.</br>  <br>When the BD come out<br> tfw Im gonna go watch it tomorrow on my local cinema <br>Enjoy waiting anon</br></br></br>  <br>What if the dream Beerus talked about in the trailer is the entire BotG movie and the real events of the dream take place in the new series?</br>  <br>Select theaters<br><br><br>Not to get into power level bullshit, but Super Saiyan God is equal to or better than Super Saiyan 4. There was that one article by Toriyama where he explains the working of the Super Saiyan transformations, and that Super Saiyan God basically draws out all latent Super Saiyan potential, removing the need for further transformations as they only serve to consume more energy. This means that Super Saiyan God is at least as strong as Super Saiyan 4 since the latter is just a further transformation. The only disadvantage Super Saiyan God has in comparison is the time limit, but Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan fixes that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would both be incredibly dumb and incredibly brilliant at the same time.</br>  <br>Thanks for pointing out the obvious. You could of also just say God Goku wins because SSJ4 isn't canon.</br>  <br>Apparently the latest games (Xenoverse and the 3DS game) state that Super Cyan is indeed stronger than any other form, so that's official, if you want to believe it.</br>  <br> equal or better <br>The equal part is a huge exaggeration. That's like saying God Goku is weaker than Omega Shenron, and Omega Shenron is almost as strong if not equal to Beerus which is complete bullshit.</br></br>  <br>How much of a planet buster is godku anyway? For all we know he hasn't fully mastered and unlocked his new forms potential</br>  <br> watching subbed dbz </br>  <br>Its far less of a plot hole than Future Gohan being weaker than the Androids after THIRTEEN YEARS of straight fighting while main Gohan became stronger than Perfect Cell after just 1 year of training.</br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't get to train with his dad,that's the problem</br>  <br>you have to remember one important fact: gohan a shit</br>  <br>He does in RoF I believe<br><br>He wasnt stronger than cell because of his training. He just unlocked his inner hidden power that he wasnt capable of mastering throughout his childhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Its 13 years were talking about. In terms of DB training time that might as well be a million. 13 years is AFTER the end of the Buu saga. And he couldnt beat weakened versions of Androids in all that time even though he beat Cell? Yamcha could probably beat them with 13 years of training.</br>  <br>So super cyan goku is god forms full potential?</br>  <br>He was at least around equal with Cell without even going SSJ2.</br>  <br>But it's his dad. Goku knew what he had to do in order to make Gohan stronger. He knew what would bring out his full potential.</br>  <br>Vegeta became stronger than both the Androids just by ignoring Trunks and punching the air a lot.</br>  <br>Not even close. Cell threw him around like a rag doll. Gohan was far less powerful</br>  <br>Only because Gohan wasnt as into it. He was still obviously above the Androids at least.<br><br> defending plot holes <br><br>Just say Toriyama sucks at writing and be done with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pardon my ignorance, but is "super cyan" what SSJGSS is called?</br>  H Y P E<br>Y<br>P<br>E<br><br>thats some major news right there. <br><br>please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they do something with Uub. I want a human that's worth a damn.  <br> please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters. <br><br>Id be fine with new characters being important if theyre well written. Because lets face it, nobody cares about Yamcha or Chaotzu and that just leaves Piccolo and the other Saiyans who are just less competent copies of Goku.</br></br></br>  <br> and vegeta <br>He never got his chance to shine. If anything, he deserves it more than anyone.</br></br>   yfw toriyama is literally ripping off Dragon Ball Multiverse   <br>I strongly doubt he's ever even heard of it.</br>  <br>I'd rather see Tien, Yamcha, Krillin and maybe even Roshi learn either Kaioken or have Elder Kai unlock their potential.. Or some other new kind of powerup but that might be even more asspulley</br>  <br>I say fuck em.</br>  <br>And completely pointless.<br><br>Wouldn't mind seeing Piccolo do something special since he's the most likeable character on the show.</br></br></br>  <br>no he did it just by screaming while trunks was freaking the fuck out<br><br>...i miss future trunks</br></br></br>  <br>Easily the coolest character in the series. He deserves his own arc</br>  <br>Yeah it's easier to say I guess</br>  <br>DRAGON BALL CONFIRMED UNIVERSE TIER</br>  <br> they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br><br>Toriyama actually wrote this unironically.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd still be miles behind Goku and Vegeta for sure, but correct me if I'm wrong.. Humans/Namekians aren't able to go beyond their base forms power? Where as the different SSJ variants have ridiculous multipliers, to have non-saiyans keep up they gotta have something equivalent to those transformations</br>  <br>Theyre gonna wish Beerus and Whis dead.</br>  <br>Always fucking hated how gt/kid trunks hair never curves when he goes SSJ. It goes straight up and looks more like how he would look if he went SSJ2. Fucking love the curve.</br>  <br>Unless there's a super powerful namekian god piccolo can fuse with like kame and Naaaaaaaail</br>  How come they never split senzu beans in half? Seems like an easy way to heal someone useless without wasting a full bean.  <br>Why don't vegeta and goku beat eachother to near death and just have dende constantly heal them so they can be powerful enough to beat any enemy.</br>  <br>Because a power increase of 10,000 wouldnt do a lot against someone with a power level of a billion.<br><br>Vegeta tried it against Frieza and he still couldnt even touch him.</br></br></br>  <br>But they are now stronger, so the power boost would be way higher than that.</br>  <br>That's why I said constantly. If they did it for 6 months straight, imagine how powerful they'd be. They could easily increase their power level by 100k within 10 minutes.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they did at some point. They just implied that it wont completely heal someone unless its a full bean.</br>  <br> Because a power increase of 10,000 <br> implying <br>Goku went from about 150k to several millions. It scales on your current level.</br></br></br>  <br>Blueper Cyan God</br>  Someone made a timeline image already  They aren't actually going to re-do BotG In show from right, guys? That beautiful scene where goku saves the earth from Beerus' blast, and then Beerus raises his arm making it look like he'a about to<br>Finish goku and chooses not to. such an amazing moment. What would be the point...</br>    <br>In show form*</br>  <br><br>Do you even read or watch this series?<br><br>There are no zenkai boosts after super saiyan.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, saiyans can breathe in space now ! </br>  <br>Was it ever stated that they couldn't?</br>  <br>Yes, actually.</br>  <br>In the latest movie Vegeta dies because the earth was destroyed and Frieza survived despite being much weaker than him because he can breathe in space.</br>  <br>Rabbits can live on the moon anyways.</br>  <br>Next time can you not spoil the movie. It's not exactly out here yet.</br>  <br>Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? Plus couldn't it be possible his God power allows him to be able to breathe in space also?</br>  <br>Wasn't it confiremd in BoG? Beerus said about other gods of destruction in different universes.<br>Get ready for 10 more series about universes and then movie about every universe untiing versus that boss of all gods of destruction.</br></br>  <br> Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? <br><br>When exactly did that occur ?</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely don't expect Gohan to be anything but Yamcha tier and the edginess being pretty much gone. It's gonna be Z Dragon Ball style.</br>  <br>Pretty much any time he goes to King Kai's planet, and even the supreme Kai planet after Buu blew up earth.</br>  <br>I guess God mode does help.</br>  <br>He instant transmissions through space all the time. Buu fight for example, he teleports himself and satan off planet before Buu blew up the earth.</br>  <br>Bardock did it too in the standoff against Frieza</br>  Just finished watching the latino camrip of RoF and I'm hyped as fuck for Super, at what tiime does it air in Japan on Sunday?  <br>Reminder that Broly will be the MC of Universe 6 and will have LSSG.</br>  <br> Broly <br>please no</br></br>  <br>Even though you're baiting, I don't hate the concept of a universe where brolu was never defeated and rampages throughout the universe. Always liked broly.</br>  <br>His fame outshines every other Movie villain, I wouldn't be surprised if he is more known that Beerus. He is always pushed in shit he shouldn't be in. I have seen several game covers where the only non canon character in them is Broly. Just look at the new 3DS game that is coming.</br>  <br>It doesn't mean that it's another dimension with counterparts you know. It's another universe with different characters, races etc.</br>  <br> A universe where Broly has achieved super cyan </br>  <br>No they can't, they never could they can just last longer than a human due to better lung capacity</br>  <br>Instant Transmission is literally teleporting, not actual movement. Its more like moving your body through another plane to get somewhere else really fast</br>  <br><br>What if Universe 6 is FemGokuverse</br></br>  Can anybody else believe how crazy it is this concept of a new series that not even Japan knows what is going to happen?<br><br>This has literally never happened with Dragonball. Every series, movie, OVA, etc. came to other countries much later than when they finished in Japan. All anybody had to do was see a magazine or get a piss yellow subtitled VHS. Even if they tried to guess what would happen, some guy could have that one Japanese friend and they tell them.<br><br>For once in its entire franchise's lifetime, literally everybody will be watching something Dragonball without another country knowing what happens down the line</br></br></br></br>  <br>he died because the fucking planet exploded, not because he couldn't breathe</br>  <br>How much Gohanfags tears can we expect?</br>  <br> i'm born in a time when I can watch any anime at the same time as japan <br> this also applies to dragonball <br> wow,so fucking crazy </br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill a 10 gallon hat</br>  <br><br>Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan?<br><br>Hea a jobber now and will never ever be relevant again NEVER EVER!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan? <br>Because Gohanfags can't stop bringing him up although he's irrelevant as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the movie? Frieza didnt die, and Beerus attributed that thats because can breath in space.</br>  <br>Gohan has been the absolute strongest several times in the past and will continue to overtake everyone else in this new series. Stay delusional vegetafag</br>  <br>So... Wait... What... Will the movies be chopped up and integrated as multipart episodes or will they tell stories that build up into each movie and then just be all "lol plz buy our bluray to see what happens!" and cut to post BotG/"F" arcs?</br>  <br> got rekt by first form freeza </br>  <br> Universe 6.3 </br>  Universe 6. They're all gonna fight their GT counterparts.  <br> fighting moustache leather pants vegeta <br>Oh god the horror</br></br>  <br>God please Toriyama  dont do this. Fat Beerus is lazy enough. </br>  <br> Stay delusional vegetafag </br>  <br>Uhh, okay?</br>  <br><br>Hey, if i had watched the movie yet i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too.<br><br>Face it, Gohan is going to kick ass at one point or another in the new series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was part of Gohans strategy to let Friezas guard down and then Goku came and fucked it up.</br>  <br>So it's GT. Not too bad.</br>  <br> i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too. <br>You mean when the earth gets exploded?</br></br>  <br> cherry pick <br>It's literally the only thing Gohan does in the movie<br>Unless you count him beating Nappa-tier soldiers as proof of him being strong</br></br></br>  <br> That was part of Gohans strategy  <br>Gohan please</br></br>  <br>My balls would go dragon</br>    <br>Its a sound strategy. Stay mad cunt</br>  <br>He was merely pretending<br>Just like Piccolo</br></br>  <br>this is GT all over again</br>  <br/>  Did Frieza call it "Earth's Hell" in the original Japanese audio of RoF too? Because it sounds like he's implying each planet has a different hell and the only reason he went there is because he died on Earth  What are Piccolo's shoes made of?  <br> NEVER EVER! <br>What's a /v/tard doing here crossboarding? GET OUT</br></br>  I haven't followed this since the first PV was announced. Has any new PV stuff come out?  <br><br><br>This meme is almost as bad ad gohan himself</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel you.</br></br>  <br>Ummm all he does is get his ass kicked.

Besides the fact they're re-using Frieza and probably Cell too. Nothing about this seems good except maybe Slice-of-life adventures of Majin Buu  Cont. discussion, and speculation from    want to play Tsukihime in Japanese <br>  CD-DA music doesn't loop on Win 7 (not even on XP, I think), want to use custom music too <br>  EOPs with their patch can just drop files into a folder <br>  I have to install special software, set Tsukihime to work with it and write a custom ini file by hand <br><br> You win this one EOPs.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Best girl.</br>   still no satsuki route   <br>Red skirt looks better, but damn she's still the hottest of the bunch.</br>  <br>Satsuki got 2 redesigns.<br>TM finally admitting she is the most important Tsukihime heroine.</br></br>    <br>Hisui a best.</br>  <br>Her school uniform was always blue and white.</br>  Shiki looks pretty damn good in this one<br><br>Also, <br>That face on top of the page hnng</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like the Arc redesign.<br><br>The only thing that bothers me is the sameface on all the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Arc looks pretty good here too.

Even if he wasn't dense enough to consider it, he's eventually planning on leaving Rin behind to wander the world as a seigi no mikata. They're enjoying their happiness in the short-term while it lasts, but eventually Rin will settle down as a clocktower mage and Shirou will go off to chase his ideal. There's no real future for them, outside of a few meetings here or there.<br><br>This is remedied somewhat in Fate/Extra where it's implied Rin traveled with him, but the UBW epilogue seems to imply otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean you clearly didn't watch the episode<br>Or are you doubting the Word of Rin ?</br></br>  <br>Jesus censor that shit.</br>    <br>Stay mad wormfag.</br>  <br>It's this guy again.</br>  <br>but who is the blue man?</br>  <br>She touched her hand.<br>Hatesex confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Shirou wears a cardigan.<br>Rin wears a polo.<br><br>When did everything change?</br></br></br></br>    <br> UBW Shirou was Archer all along <br>That Shyamalan twist.</br></br>    <br><br><br>easiest bait ever</br></br></br>  <br>After Rin started buying him clothes.</br>  <br>he's finally making the right choices for once</br>  <br>This new bait pics are already becoming useful.</br>  <br>I think it's Shinji<br>don't know why he's there</br></br>  <br>I want to see Rin an Luvia having ravenous hatesex as they furiously scissor one another.</br>  <br>That Nasu was actually self inserting into Tohsaka's anus?</br>  <br> mfw bait </br>  <br>I don't buy that, though. While Rin may be able to make Shirou take value in his own happiness, he's still ultimately going to pursue his ideal. Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS, and he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu, I just don't see it ultimately lasting.<br><br><br>It's never stated, in F/E Archer just says that he was accompanied by a stalwart friend and an understanding lover. Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being in another man's girlfriend's cell phone's contact list </br>  <br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Well that's your bad because this was as close to an author statement as you possibly get without a omniscient narrator<br><br>But it's always nice to see headcanon get crushed by Nasu</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of get where your getting at, but like I feel as though that they both love each other dearly and Rin isn't the type to let go of him</br>  <br>But where is Saber going to get her magic semen?</br>  <br>Is it possible that in addition to having the Mystic Eyes of Petrification, Rider also has the Mystic Anus of Overwhelming Lewdness, which has the power to give anyone who views it lewd nightmares about her?</br>    <br>I feel like they would fight to see who makes the other cum more times, and reinforce their ladyparts to last longer.</br>  <br> 3DPD </br>  <br> secondaries </br>  she is angry because people think she won't stay with Shirou forver  <br>Is green his color?</br>  <br>I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer, and then Rin explains that she plans to settle down at Clock Tower but will travel with Shirou temporarily just to "get stuff out of her system." <br><br>Rin wants them both to have their happy endings, but their paths are different. The entire episode was about Shirou wrestling between settling down at Clock Tower (choosing a path alongside Rin) or becomine a seigi no mikata, the same path as Archer. He chose seigi no mikata.<br><br>There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou is depicted as alone in the symbolic ending. He made his choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu <br>Are you saying he will go back on what he just agreed on, because that's your head canon?<br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Sure ignore what they both agreed on.<br> Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS <br>And she stated she was going to go with him, not seeing her in a symbolic scene makes no difference.<br><br>You really need to stretch it to keep your headcanon going, but that's fine because it shows how concrete the ending was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer <br>I like how you are leaving out that she says that he will surpass Archer, and the symbolic ending shows that. I also love how desperate you are, bending the whole context to fit your head canon.<br><br> There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou <br>Because it's a serious conversation about their future. That agreement is as clear as day, he will pursue his ideal but at the end settle down for their happy ending.<br><br>I am giggling if you aren't baiting, this is a whole new level of sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji <br>I don't really know what to believe though, I mean "a stalwart friend" makes a lot of sense because of Issei's personality, but I can't really see Shirou telling him the truth about mages and shit out of fear of getting his friend killed one day<br>Shinji would make a bit more sense but "stalwart" isn't really something I would see him as, unless he changes as he grows up and stops being an egotistical and vain douche</br></br></br>  <br>It's implied that he will grow in HA.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>kill yourself</br></br>    <br><br>I think Clock Tower Shirou is even more swole than Dadruto.</br></br>  <br>Important to know that the japanese text directly implies a "male friend"<br><br><br> hug/kiss <br>Because they are japanese in a japanese show made for japanese people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh. that's actually kind of interesting considering his character personality. Also because he's a douchebag. and a piece of shit.</br>    <br>The thumbnail mad me think it was Eren Jaeger before expanding it.</br>  <br>Renaming your shit doesn't mean no one will notice.</br>  <br>In HA he wants to leave his house because he knows it's full of shit.

She acted very mellow and very direct in showing her interest in the MCs dick in this UBW thing.</br>  <br>I hope you are a descendant from a major Japanese Yakuza family or you are toast.</br>  <br><br>Not only do they end up together, the bone of Shirou's sword ends up turning Rin full dere.</br></br>  <br>I like to swin<br>Ill swin with taiga,</br></br>  I would fight off a whole yakuza army to be Taiga's man.   everytime I lose an argument online.   <br> her interaction with Shirou she seems absolutely obnoxious and annoying <br>Dude what?</br></br>  <br>She is a shy tsundere.</br>  <br>Surpassing Archer means accomplishing more as a seigi no mikata, not abandoning the path and treating it as a vacation. Rin and Shirou both say flat out that Shirou's result will be the same. Shirou says he can't change his ways. No where does that agreement imply anything like you are saying, it's just Rin's wish for them both to find happiness. <br><br>Stop missing the point of UBW and its theme because of shipfaggotry.</br></br></br>  <br> My headcanon will prevail </br>  <br>Except Shirou saw what would happen and he even admitted it was hell.<br>He will enter the hell, but atleast he will enter hell with his waifu.</br></br>  <br>how romantic</br>  why can't they just cancel fate and do more KnK.  <br>Doesn't print as much money.</br>  <br>waaaaah...???</br>  <br>Doesn't this heavily imply that he will indeed find his answer eventually?<br>Or am I missing something?</br></br>  <br>Nah he fucked all that was said there was wishful thinking.</br>  <br>Even then the episode ended on a very positive note with them both agreeing on a happy end, even Rin who was so opposed to the idea was sure Shirou wouldn't end up as bad.<br><br>Just a few episodes earlier she was screaming in anger at EMIYAs way of life, I find it very unlikely she would let Shirou end up the same way, especially after the promise with archer.</br></br></br>  <br>horribly underrated post</br>  <br>You are talking to that one Sakurafag who absolutly hates UBW and Rin</br>  <br>Why would he just pretend to argue like that, what a meanie.</br>    <br>I take you weren't hear 2 or 3 weeks ago?<br>Before EP 24 he was arguing that Rin only loved Archer than Ep 24 and 25 destroyed that argument so he switched to this</br></br>  <br> Escort explaining mana transfer technique to elementary school girls </br>  <br>I just got around to watching the last episodes now, I was a little disappointed by the first episodes of season 2 which is why I took a little break. <br><br>Now that I'm finished though, I'm pretty satisfied with the adaption, the filler parts were really bad, but the final battles made up for it.<br>The Hogwarts part was pretty damn good too.</br></br></br></br>  holy fuck you autistic shits go outside this board is actually cancer  <br> this triggers people here  <br><br>Typemoonfags are pathetic.</br></br></br>   there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br> she will never be as good as L O N D O N waifu Rin <br>Literally no reason to live whatsoever.</br></br>  <br> F/Z <br>Bad start, good middle, bad ending.<br><br> UBW <br>Good start, bad middle, good ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll get to see the strongest Rin in action, and she gets a lot of development in HF.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>HF Rin literaly doesn't make sense with how Ufotable adapted Rin's adventure in Zero.</br>  <br>What? why?</br>  <br><br>Fate/Zero had a great start. Ur dumb.</br></br>    <br>In the LN Rin completly fails and it traumatizes her so that she decides to not try impossible things anymore.<br> That part actualy neatly set up Rin's mindset for F/SN </br></br>  <br>Watch they will make Rin completely tame compared to the VN.</br>  <br> F/Z <br> Good start, good middle, decent ending. <br><br> UBW <br> Good start, bad middle, great ending. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be one 90 minute RN movie anyway.</br>  <br>Saving Sakura is not only impossible, it brings danger to everyone.</br>  <br><br> good start <br>Maybe if you're a secondary that doesn't know shit about how the HGW works. <br>If you read the VN or LN the first episodes feel incredibly slow and redundant. It'sundeniable that Zero suffered from pacing issues, especially when it was airing. <br>Having to watch five episodes until the series starts to pick up is not a good start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 90 minutes <br>Any source on this?<br>I'm a huge UBWfag, but even I will be disappointed if it's only 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>That's my point, it's hard to develop character with that. Parts will be cut and I am sure her going against Shirou at the start will be cut.</br>  <br>My ass<br><br>But as you see in F/SN before HF and in Ufotable's F/Z Rin has a disposition to try to do the impossible which in the LN was dampened by her failure to save anyone</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love if the movies made the characters harder to relate to, really pulling out all the dark shit they hide. <br>They are magi after all, they live surrounded by death and have to constantly shoulder the burden of really tough life choices, tey should really be as mentally fucked up as the Zero HGW participants.</br></br>  <br> there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br>You retard we have Fate Illya Prisma season 3 this summer season!</br></br>  <br>It's a movie the highest it might go is 120 minutes.</br>  <br> prism <br>I'd rather read Fate route 3 times in a row.</br></br>  <br>Remember how Rin's traits are optimism (F/Z) and perfection? <br>There's a reason why optimism was only present in Zero, her parents death showed her how cruel is the world of magi and that she would get herself killed if she continued to be that innocent.</br></br>  <br>Yes that was added by the Butcher later. It's perfectly fine not to have it and I guess UFO didn't deem it that necessary.</br>  <br>I thought they'd do multiple movies like with KnK</br>  <br>That's not confirmed and it's pure speculation.</br>  <br>Prisma RIn doesn't do justice to her VN/Ufo counterpart.<br>I'll only watch Prisma for the occasional good battle and to see who wins the Shiroub owl.</br></br>  <br>It's going to be hard to keep that with a movie especially when the viewers are coming from F/Z and UBW.</br>  <br>Rin's past was pretty much a blank.<br>Completly inverting what she "learns" from that part of F/Z was stupid.<br>I mean it works somewhat with UBW and Fate but not with HF.</br></br></br>  <br>Her actions are justifiable without that. You are right that they should have kept it as it helps.</br>  <br>Prisma Rin has some pretty okay moments in 3rei.</br>  <br>Shit, we might get this side story this season. Maybe.</br>  <br>There's something incredibly cute about dense Shota Shirou and Foolhardy Loli Rin.</br>  i never see these posted in rin threads and i have no idea why  <br>I think her command seals are on the wrong hand.</br>  <br>Because her command spells go in the left hand. This pic is an insult.</br>  Anime Expo is this weekend. We should get to know about the localized sets for UBW if anyone's interested.  <br><br>idk man it's better than being anatomically incorrect</br></br>  <br>Better than HF.<br><br><br>Prisma Rin has pretty much already won.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There</br></br>  <br><br>How was it impossible when the grail system could have been destroyed, thus eliminating the Shadow and most of the issues the series has, plus she can survive hellish torture even before merging with AM, making getting the last soul jar in her heart an arduous but totally doable procedure?</br></br>  <br>Bitch, get your goddamn shoes off my bed before you get my sheets dirty. Why are you even wearing shoes in what is supposedly a Japanese house?</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br> Japanese house <br> implying it's not her house <br>Why are you in her house anon? Are you a rapist?</br></br></br>  <br>If it's a daki, then Rin is supposed to be in your house. The product is sold in Japan.</br>  So I wonder where she's getting the money from to attend uni?  <br>Money from patents her family owned.</br>  <br>That's where she gets the money for gemstones.</br>  <br>She's not exactly a poorfag Luvia. Unlike you who fucks old fat men and dogs for free.</br>  <br>Patented Kama-Sutra manuals. Geared towards old men.</br>    <br>Everytime I see her name I always end up hearing it said in Kirei's voice</br>  So what was that letter Shirou had in his pocket?  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  <br>Invitation to join the Mages Association.</br>  My additional food portions.  So why is Luvia perfectly okay with flirting with a guy already in a relationship, much less in front of the other girl?<br><br>This isn't HA or Kaleid-verse we're talking about, Rin has been thoroughly jackhammer'd by now and they're even shacking up. Yet Luvia still does it with without a care.<br><br>Who does that?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A slut, that's what.</br></br>  <br>Luvia is a whore.</br>  <br>Luvia wants to cuck Rin.</br>    <br>Luvia isn't going to let some other bitch steal her husbando.<br>You'd a failure as a lover if you wouldn't do the same for you're waifu.</br></br>  <br>This. FAYTON</br>  <br> Ufo counterpart. <br>They fucked up Rin's characterization in romantic scenes, turned her to a generic tsundere, making everything seem like a joke. Only the final episode handled her character well in that regard.<br>Ep 25&gt;prisma rin&gt;ufo</br></br></br>  <br>Go to bed Cooking Priest.</br>  Luvia is an alpha bitch and she's going to prove it by cucking Rin by stealing Shero and showing him pleasures he could only imagine in his lewdest nightmares  <br>Luvia is a strait up bitch. This is the kinds of things Bitches do.</br>    <br> implying Luvia didn't win the fight </br>  <br>no</br>  <br>I think it strikes a good balance of hope and despair - Rin being the source of hope and Shirou still being unsure of himself, but choosing to rely on Rin for as long as he can.<br><br>If you think about it, Fate ended on a very high note too. Then Nasu revisits it years later and basically says Shirou lived a really shitty life before making it to Avalon. UBW is most likely the same, where Shirou is going to live a really fucking shitty life due to his broken nature, but at least he'll always have a home to return to.</br></br></br>    <br> She didn't though </br>  Rin suddenly does this to you.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  Takeuchi confirmed in TM Ace that Grand Order's main characters were designed to be genderbent Shirou and Rin.    <br>Die</br>  <br>I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH EMIYA-CHAN.</br>  <br>There is no indication that Rin won. After Rin punched Luvia in the gut, they continued fighting for several seconds. It then cut to Rin complaining about how Luvia wouldn't go down, indicating that Luvia won the fight.</br>  <br>You not bullshitting?</br>  <br>I want to suck the dick of Rin.</br>  <br>Why would I and it was pretty fucking obvious already.</br>  <br>Just want to make sure. Bunch of idiots have been denying it every time it gets brought up.</br>  <br>King Arthur pleases Shirou for magical energy!</br>  <br>fShirou makes a cuter girl than Rin, but mRin is still not as cute as Shirou<br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br><br>When the guy fucks with his pants on.<br><br>I hate it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guaranteed fucking post limit hit along with posting a Kyoani character so why the fuck not. /a only talks about like 5 things anymore and I can probably list them right now:<br><br>Fate<br>Kyoani shows<br>Shaft Shows<br>Light Novel adaptation flavor of the season<br>Fanservice fetish topics that cycle over and over<br><br>Every other kind of thread pretty much dies within an hour or two.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least we get less naked man-ass that way.</br>  <br>Because mRin doesn't look like Shinji duh.</br>  <br>I never wanted to see this</br>  <br>The question now is, will they fug?</br>  What kind of music is Tohsaka into?  <br> Rin is Shinji and Asuka's child <br>It all makes sense now.</br></br>  <br>maybe the same what tokiomi liked</br>  <br>What did Tokiomi like?</br>  <br>Classical, or oldies I'd bet. She'd only own vinyl, too, but that's just because he wouldn't know how to use a CD player.</br>  <br>It's perspective, but her fingers look really odd</br>  <br> that's just because he wouldn't know how to use a CD player. <br>She would know, those are old as fuck.<br>She would suck at using her cellphone, mp3 players or music streaming sites/apps.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be into jazz and soul, especially with female vocalists because lesbian fantasies and shit.<br>Pre 80s rock and pop would agree with her tastes, and also classical of course.</br></br>  <br><br>I can imagine her listening to some Nina Simone, or even some Carole King or Laura Nyro.</br></br>  <br><br> implying a Japanese teenage girl would listen to American Jazz <br>dufuq. Tohsaka would clearly only listen to classical. Perhaps J-pop as it was getting popular in the early 2000s. Maybe the Beetles and such as well.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be a lot into brit music</br>  <br>Not that guy, but Jazz is surprisingly not unpopular in Japan.<br><br>My old piano teacher toured there with his wife a year or two back.</br></br></br>  Prisma Rin is a qt.  <br>It was a draw anon.</br>  <br> Watashi wa CIA </br>  <br>She seems more of an airhead even though she is suppose to be Rin's clone. My guess is some of her brain went into her breasts.</br>  <br>Really? Bless Takeuchi. Now the idiots who denied it can fuck themselves.</br>  <br>She doesn't even know where babies come from.</br>  <br>Dammit<br><br>Why must Prisma treat Shirou like nothing more than a sex toy?</br></br></br>  <br>She looks better in red</br>  <br>He's pretty okay in 3rei.</br>  <br>Exactly, to me it seems like they replaced Rin's teacher personality for a Rich OHOHOHO airhead. Their similarity is as good as Rin and Sakura's.</br>  Rin with Shirou-mode Archer in TM ace  <br> but at least he'll always have a home to return to. <br>Though I agree that he will have a path that's hard and full of mistakes as Rin said. I do believe she will accompany him on the journey, because she said it.</br></br>  <br><br>Which plush is that, and are there versions of it with Rider instead?</br></br>  <br>Why is it cut?</br>  <br>She said she'll eventually return and settle down, but will still be there for him to return home to. Shirou will most likely go out on expeditions by himself for the rest of his life, or maybe until he gets too old to do so.</br>  <br>Early preview</br>  What a shitty series and fanbase.<br><br>You should all be ashamed of yourself for watching or playing this garbage.</br></br>  <br> She said she'll eventually return and settle down, but will still be there for him to return home to. <br>She doesn't say this. She says that in the end she will return there that doesn't specify when either.</br></br>  <br> Trying to bait franchise that has been around since /a/ has been a board <br><br>0/10<br>At least try</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't the same without the construction noises at the end.</br>  <br> Hotgun wedding. <br><br>And who would be hlding the shotgun in that wedding.</br></br></br>  <br> She says that in the end she will return there <br>So... she does say it.<br><br> doesn't specify when either. <br>Simplest explanation is that she'll wait for him, otherwise she'd say she'll return when he does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I found this if it helps.</br>  <br>You know, I didn't expect to see that again. I really just cropped that out of Ch 9.6 of 2wei.</br>  <br>She was talking about on the context of herself accompanying him, so yes in the end could be the end of his journey too. After that she goes talks about their happy ending implying it's for both.</br>  Did Issei get NTR'd?  <br><br>Issei already has Ayako, he don't need no slut.</br></br>  <br>Nope, she is going with him until the end. She is going to settle down after they reach their happy ending.</br>      <br><br><br>Damn these nips work fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>MTSP Jin</br>  <br>Fuck you to all the people who said it was supposed to Shiki and Sacchin, or that it was Kiritsugu, or whatever other reference you pulled out your asses.</br>  <br>I guess that's one interpretation of it. I'm getting bad EXTRA vibes here.</br>  <br>Extra Archer had several lovers who all either screwed him over or betrayed him.</br>  <br> I'm getting bad EXTRA vibes here. <br>Dude what? EXTRA Archer is Archer not UBW Shirou.</br></br>  <br> Sausage curl is not ashamed </br>  <br>She's a slut.<br><br>Unfortunately for her, sluts never win.</br></br></br>  <br> Airhead slut <br>Worst type of slut. They just fall on dicks.</br></br>  <br>Shirou need to choose between a Gorilla and a Sausage Slut, he'd be better off fucking future him.</br>  <br>I'd marry that gorilla.</br>  <br>I'd impregnate Sausage Slut TBH, but that's cause I'm a sucker for blondes</br>  The best.  <br> Dolphins,Gorilla,Rhino <br>Which animal is she?</br></br>  <br>I also hear she's supposed to be an alien.<br><br>Rin transcends everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Their stories are similar.<br><br> Both traveled the world to fight evil <br> Both had a lover <br>   Lover died, sending him spiraling down a slippery slope </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC updated the stuff about his lover. It turned out he didn't just have one, but several, and they all either left him, betrayed him, or screwed him over in some way.</br>  <br>Oh right. I wonder what's next.</br>  <br>See<br>Even then, how many times must it be said that none of the routes produce Emiya?</br></br>  <br>At least she'll never be a worm.<br><br>Or a fish.</br></br></br>  <br> what is mahi-mahi </br>  <br>I missed one, the latest one is that she acts like a cat.</br>  <br>That's actually been a legit thing since HA. There's a whole scene about it.</br>  <br>If I recall, CCC didn't say those were his lovers. It was kind of a joke and Archer got bitter about it. The main take-away though was that Archer lived a solitary life. Feel free to post a screencap of the scene and prove me wrong though.<br><br><br>I never said it produced Emiya you EOP, just that there are strong parallels.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I never said it produced Emiya you EOP, just that there are strong parallels. <br>So then what the fuck is your point?<br> EOP <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Those cat eyes <br>Hnng.</br></br>    <br>A cute.</br>  <br> So then what the fuck is your point? <br>You just greentexted it, faggot. You were the one who decided to jump into the conversation to insult me for some reason.<br><br> Fuck off <br>It is you, who needs to fuck off by claiming to know what happens in CCC.</br></br></br></br></br>  filthy slut.  <br>She's pure.</br>  <br>I need to go after this scene again, any idea of when is this?</br>  <br>I can't remember the specifics, but it's the one where the cast drinks a potion and starts talking with animal inflections in their voices. Probably doesn't help too much, though.</br>  <br>She sucks old men's dicks for money.</br>  <br>Doujins. She's pure.</br>  <br><br>She gets married in one and tries dating in the other. How does that make her a slut? Hell, she's far more slutty in Fate.</br></br>  is MTSP Jin still going to do another chapter about her?  <br>Raped not pure.</br>  <br>Third time's the charm.</br>  <br>What happened the second time?</br>  <br>Ruined a hotel room.</br>  <br><br>Hotel, fucked up the air conditioning.</br></br>  <br>No news, sadly. See</br>  <br><br>You lost me.</br></br>  <br>Read the scene in HA.</br>  <br><br>And several Doujins also have versions of Ilya as gay. It just seems common to have her that way. Nothing wrong with that.</br></br>  <br>It's not much but there's enough motivation to quickly go through HA again, hope I find it, thanks mang.</br>  <br><br>She's like 50% gay, anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh come on, you know he got most of his audiences from his NTR doujins featuring the Tohsaka ;_;</br>  <br>A slut won in HF and UBW</br>  <br>Everytime I see her name I always end up hearing it said in Luvia's voice</br>  <br>Illya is gay, she only likes Shirou as a brother.</br>  <br> UBW <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Is HA good?</br>  <br><br>Hit and miss. A lot of SoL if you like that sort of stuff.</br></br>  <br>It's alright. It's mostly a bunch of slice of life scenes framed around a small, but pretty solid story .At times, some of the characters can seem out of character though due to a lot of it being written by guest writers.<br><br>Keep in mind, if you like Rin, her scenes fluctuate greatly in quality. She has some of the worst, and some of the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Well she fucked shirou over enough to make him live in an eternal hell as CG in UBW. sounds like a slut to me</br>  <br> Well she fucked shirou over enough to make him live in an eternal hell as CG in UBW <br><br>I think you need to either reread some stuff, or rewatch some stuff.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay I'll try it.</br></br>  <br>fuck now i have to go read and fap to it again</br>  I just want to say aside from Rin I like Sakura. Rin is always best girl. I don't want to romance Saber, I want Lancer instead  <br>I don't hate any of the girls.<br><br>Except Luvia.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin does the exact same thing in HF, even trying to make Shirou kill his innocent girlfriend.</br>  <br>does she even know how to operate it?</br>  <br>she doesn't, that's the joke</br>  <br>Imagine her trying to use a smart phone.</br>  Rin is delicious.  <br>Pro tip: ctrl through any scene that mentions cooking.</br>  So did this scene still happen in the anime universe? We know it happens after the VN.  <br><br>Probably not. Though given that the first time they'd both fuck it would be without the urgency there was in the VN, I think it would have been less uncomfortable for both of them.</br></br>  <br>They certainly seem to be enjoying themselves a few years down the line.</br>  <br>That's what the old men said after she sucked their penises.</br>      Rin!  <br>SUCKS OLD MAN DICK FOR MONEY!</br>  <br>I wish she'd suck mine.</br>  <br>Is Shirou The Old Man?</br>  Anyone got that Fate/Type-moon infographic?    <br>Goddammit anon, why'd you to do it like that. <br><br>You ruined all the hope in a nigga's heart</br></br></br>  <br>That guy's full of shit though and is completely wrong.</br>  <br>Do not fall for it</br>    <br> taking the bait from wormslutfags </br>  Shirou's true love was always Saber.

I had the same problem with Pleiades.</br></br>  <br>Hazuki is their adopted daughter. It's a nice Tuba family dynamic.</br>  <br>It's her purple bedroom eyes. It's like she's about to suck you dry before you even get to react.</br>  Why was Asuka's UFO silver and not gold?  <br>Read the spoilers.</br>  <br>It's  her Dad's UFO. </br>  <br>reminder that Left Fagott is objectively the best</br>  So what's the point of switching to the blue semen demon in the middle of the performance? It kinda ruined it to be honest.  <br>Why would they adopt someone who doesn't even know how to properly take a bath with her Tubacabra?</br>  <br>I wish we got a scene like that for right fagott too.<br>Hottest chicks in the band.</br></br>  <br>So they can teach her together.</br>  <br>They'll impart that knowledge to her in time just as parents teach their children about the world.</br>  That pout.  Smile status: Saved  <br>But Riko and Gouto would already take up all the space. There is no place for someone as useless as Hazuki.<br>They shouldn't have to teach anything to their kid who would already be born with perfect knowledge and love for Tuba.</br></br>    <br>I see it too. I'd do a Vietnam Taki with that shot if I wasn't so lazy.</br>  <br>Why was Flute-chan sad?</br>  <br><br>I'm going to sleep after I finish typing this so don't expect any answers unless this thread is up in 12 hours which I doubt<br><br>  To start off, Mizore is a girl with an inferiority complex and low self esteem. Which is ironic because she ends up playing the most difficult instrument at the highest skill level. But anyway, Mizore had no friends in and a personality that doesn't let her play well with others. She's often described as "too cold" and she's the kind of person that speaks in short phrases. So along comes Nozomi who is the only girl who actually speaks to Mizore and Mizore more or less falls in love with her. Nozomi is the one who invites her to join the music club with her; Mizore's parents buy her an oboe, parents of the year amirite. And things go great, middle school is fun and Mizore plays with passion; however, they get cocky and end up getting Silver during their last year which ends their club time. This cuts Mizore pretty deep for but for reasons that'll be explained later. So then everyone from their school which includes Natsuki and Yuuko decide to go to Kitauji which is a local school. The club there is bad but they planned to pull off an underdog story to Nationals. Until they find out that the club sucks so much that they're all put in B-team while the slacker seniors get to play in A-team. The only other oboe ends up quitting for some reason and this puts Mizore suddenly into the A-team and this separates Nozomi and Mizore. Nozomi who wanted to play and Mizore who wanted to be with Nozomi. Nozomi confronts the seniors and it ends in an argument that leads to everyone except Natsuki, Yuuko and Mizore quitting. Natsuki's reason is Nozomi related, Yuuko's reason for not quitting is that Kaori asked her to stay. Sadly, nobody asked Mizore to come with them. Not even Nozomi whom Mizore considered her only friend told Nozomi to quit with them. So Mizore felt like she was tossed aside and worthless.  </br></br></br></br>  It's over, KyoAni is finished.  <br>Thanks for everything today, night.</br>  <br>Poor oboe-chan.<br><br>Must've been super duper awkward seeing each other around in classes and stuff after the club fallout.</br></br></br>  <br> hibike! Euphonium 2: senpai wars. </br>  Asuka's a bitch, but by god that body. Would plough.  <br>Do these friends not have any interaction outside of band, holy shit. <br><br>Go grab some McWonalds or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Fell in love? <br>With her music right?</br></br>  <br>So much suffering behind those eyes.</br>  <br><br>Fucking UFO-kun gets all the cute girls, lucky bastard .</br></br>  <br><br>   So along comes Nozomi who is the only girl who actually speaks to Mizore and Mizore more or less falls in love with her <br><br>OH BABY</br></br></br></br>   Best part of the series is volume 2 <br> We will never have a second season </br>  <br>The promo art for these two is going to be baity alright.</br>  <br><br>I'd rather volume 3 since it's about Asuka which is clearly foreshadowed in this season.</br></br>  A right cutie. <br><br>Fuck the police (Asuka). Nozomi should be in the band.</br></br>  AH dat melody gives me goosebumps. Made me shed a tear, such beautiful melodies and Reina's playing is EXQUISITE  <br><br>I'm just in stitches imagining Kyoani's 2nd ED. The bait is gonna be off the charts.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Implying KyoAni will not go anime original just to have all cuties play in cast</br>  <br>this one is summarized too much cause I'm sleepy<br> so this cuts to next year where everyone gits gud. Nozomi is actually at the concert as we see in this episode. After seeing the performance, she wants to come back to the club. But before she can come back, she wants to get Asuka's approval. Asuka actually tried to stop Nozomi from leaving, also called her chickenshit for quitting but Nozomi left anyway. So Nozomi wants Asuka to accept that she needs her in the club. But Asuka finds out that Mizore being near Nozomi causes Mizore to freak out so in order to protect the Oboe, Asuka doesn't let Nozomi back in. Nozomi keeps coming back everyday, also hangs out a lot with Natsuki to pass the time. Kumiko ends up talking to Mizore several times and learns more about her. Mizore doesn't like concerts because they put a value on your hardwork, and that the judges can deem your efforts worthless. It's not really the concerts though that she hates but something about herself. Also Mizore's solo is criticized by Taki sensei's friend who came as an adviser. He says Mizore playing is flawless but only because she plays like she is a robot, without emotion. Kumiko later talks to Nozomi and learns about her circumstances too. And Kumiko tries her best to mediate this situation, trying to figure out why Asuka won't let Nozomi back in and what is Mizore's deal. Asuka eventually tells everything to Kumiko after Kumiko confronts her about it, and asks Kumiko can she really tell Nozomi that the reason why she can't come back is because Mizore hates her? Kumiko ends up just asking Nozomi why she didnt ask Mizore to leave with her which causes Nozomi to go find Mizore. And this ends up causing an absolutely disastrous moment where Nozomi is chasing Mizore down the hallway, Mizore just freaking out. Yuuko stops Nozomi and Mizore gets away. Kumiko finds Mizore on the floor of another classroom at which point we find out what the real deal is between them. </br></br>  <br>She's important in the second novel too.</br>  According to some novel readers Hazuki and Midori become background characters and Reina is more of a secondary character after vol. 1. If KyoAni ever makes another season I'd like to still see them hang with Kumiko. Hazuki was already getting friendly with Reina during this last episode.  <br>They are background characters in S1 already.</br>  If I could have your attention please, best girl has a few words.  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Only after episode 8. They were secondary characters for most of the season but not background waifus.</br>  <br><br>   called her chickenshit for quitting <br><br>Absolutely based</br></br></br></br>  Do you think someone at KyoAni got fired after this? How could anyone miss this?  That nothing. <br><br><br>All of this drama.<br><br>Kumiko "helping", shame there's no season two for me to get some popcorn and tea. <br><br><br>It's ridiculous. It's like they fast travel between classes and band, that's it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They did the exact same thing to the animator's hands. After that the industry never saw another case of these hands in a show.</br>   liking faggot <br>go blow one yourself, fag</br>  <br><br>Mizore is emotionally unstable.

Rips might be out this season.</br>  <br>I'm all ears, best girl.</br>  <br>I love Mizore. After I'm done with the book I'm working on I want to read the Euphonium series especially for her. Also for Haruka who is my other favorite.</br>  <br>Haruka is such a good girl</br>  So s2 is happening or not?  So Ribbon, Natsuki, Oboe replaces Asuka, Kaori, Buchou and they become the new big 3?  <br><br>I guess they are putting their everything on the Free! movie.</br></br>  <br>we must break the reed</br>  <br>Nozomi please go, and stay go.</br>  <br>mizore doesn't either<br><br>she probably figures "well, that's how it is I guess"</br></br></br>  <br>ＮＯ</br>  What's her name?  <br><br> wanting this semen demon to leave <br><br>Fagott</br></br></br></br>  <br> poor mans Asuka <br>There's already real Asuka, and the fagotts.</br></br>  <br>Lipstick orifice.</br>  <br><br>She doesn't even look like Asuka more like a Reina clone.

Is there a word for yandere but with violent part replaced with self degrading? Cause that's Mizore. So Mizore doesn't hate Nozomi, she's just afraid to see her. Mizore thinks of Nozomi as the most important thing in her life while Mizore feels that Nozomi is just a girl who is nice to everyone, think Yuigahama. Even so, Mizore was happy with that until the incident that left her behind which left her feeling worthless, which is what her beef with concerts is about. The reason why Mizore has gotten so good is so that Nozomi will notice her. The reason she plays the oboe is because it's the only thing that remains between her and Nozomi. Nozomi is all she has in her life. So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time Mizore who calls her out on her shit. That Mizore thinks of everyone and everything else as nothing to her. That all these friends she's ignoring she considers are worthless to her. Yuuko asks Mizore what she is to her, and Mizore says Yuuko is just someone who is pitying her, which pisses Yuuko off even more and makes Yuuko grab both of Mizore's ears. Yuuko genuinely cares about Mizore, but she's too much of an idiot to see it. Then Yuuko, while still holding onto Mizore's ears, asks Mizore has everything in this club meant nothing to her then? The music she's played, the fun they've had, the suffering they've been through from all the tournaments, the happiness when they made it to Kansai. Mizore finally understands she's her own person and not worthless and asks Yuuko if she deserves to be this happy and starts crying on Yuuko's shoulder when she tells her of course. And then Nozomi shows up at the doorway, dun dun dun <br><br>this scene is actually very touching but I'm too tired to write it in a way that makes it sound good so bear with me here.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with this pic? Because I can't tell at all</br>  <br>You forgot to mention the fact that she's a senior, meaning she's probably older than him.

It wasn't about Reina x Kumiko after all.</br></br>  <br>I will punch anyone who says Yuuko is shit now. She is the best friend you could ask for.</br>  <br>  So Mizore finally can talk to Nozomi without freaking out and confronts her on why she left her behind. Nozomi never thought of it as leaving Mizore behind, infact Nozomi didn't want Mizore to lose her chance to play in the tournament by forcing her to leave just because Nozomi had a beef with the seniors. She wanted Mizore to keep playing because she knew Mizore loved music, whether or not Mizore realized that yet herself but she does now thanks to Yuuko. Nozomi wants to apologize for making Mizore feel like crap up until now but Mizore tells her everything is diejoebu. Nozomi then reveals that she went to the concert to see her, that Nozomi has always loved the sound of Mizore's oboe. Also that she'll be at the Kansai tournament tomorrow too. Then Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants to hear her practice her solo and those two leave together. In the end, Nozomi doesn't come back to the club because Asuka still thinks its better safe than sorry just in case Mizore freaks out again. MIzore dedicates her solo to Nozomi and everything ends out great <br><br>the end  except I skipped most of the actual earlier details like how Kumiko talked to Nozomi at the pool, and how she talked to Mizore at night at band camp but you ge the idea </br></br></br>  <br>She's just going to bed, anon.</br>  <br>Missed your other posts, I don't mind a yes or a no. Does the Rikka girl get more screen time in the future?</br>  <br>Maybe she's in the JSDF, and that's when she always wakes up.</br>    <br>Also does this Christmas Cake have any plot relevance later on as well?</br>  Why were the other schools celebrating if they didn't win gold?  <br>She's way beyond cake.</br>  <br>They're simply under very bright light.</br>  <br>Holyshit this is so gay.</br>  <br>Because not everyone is a tryhard.</br>  <br><br><br>They're happy for kitauji.</br></br></br>  <br>Plus she's three feet tall there, I think.</br>  <br><br>She wears a wedding ring.</br></br>  <br>Silver and bronze got  coupon at WcDonald's .</br>  <br>I just typed up a summary of volume 2 and you could honestly leave out Kumiko and Reina from the whole thing. Kumiko was just an observer for most of this anyway. I shutter to think about how little Hazuki and Midori get shafted.</br>  <br>I'm so happy for you Oboe-chan. You deserve this ending.</br>  <br>Hyouka doesn't have enough source material for another season. Hibike does.</br>  <br>Nichijou.</br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Haruka is really feeling it!</br>  Piccolo chan is CUTE, I don't know what type of braid is that, but it's lovely.  <br>Literally a semen demon.</br>    <br>Thanks novelanon. Did you post any other spoilers besides the Asuka and Oboe backstories?</br>  <br>Brilliant. <br><br><br>Fucking Asuka.

It is soo beautiful<br><br>Them winning not even made me shed a tear even a little</br></br></br>  <br>Wanna bully a clarinet?</br>  Jesus has returned! Hallelujah!  <br>the sun already came up while I was typing this, I'm writing to the end!</br>  <br>it's a pretty easy read, the author purposely wrote it to be easy to understand so her friends would read her stuff.<br><br>Kitauji got gold, not dud gold like in episode 1 but actual gold. You get ranked gold silver copper based on your performance and only a select number of gold can make it through to the next tournament.</br></br></br>  <br>    to hear her practice her solo <br>   "hear" "practice" "her solo" <br>Is this how they call it these days?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you novelanon. Now get some well earned sleep.</br>  <br>Yes I love that part. I'm glad someone made this.</br>  <br>She looks better with that bow.</br>    <br>look at the webm, the color's just too contrast for light effect.</br>  <br>Did anyone else bawl like little bitch when the ending credits came in?</br>  <br> So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time <br><br>Do you know how difficult it is to keep updating my best girl list?</br></br></br>  <br> Is this how they call it these days? <br>Yeah. That sounds... sexy. A little too strange... Oh well, whatever that makes them happy.</br></br>  <br>Because they did get gold, only dud golds. The real gold winner or winners, not sure, was announced later by the judge.</br>  <br>Do we at least get a mention of what the seniors do after they graduate?</br>    <br>backalley</br>  <br>I need to reread her parts but yes she does get a minor scene of relevancy where she calls Kumiko the night before Kansai and tells Kumiko to find her at the tournament. I don't think Azusa is enjoying herself very much. The novel doesn't go any further into it but it seems like they're setting up for some original s2 drama. Because they showed wayyy too many Azusa shots in the ending.</br>  <br>Not much?</br>  <br>She's so fiercely loyal. That could be overwhelming but also really nice to know someone actually has your back 100%.</br>  <br>Stop projecting.</br>  <br>so thats why Oboe-chan the only one doesnt smile<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Asuka, Oboe and Taki Lovestory are all I wrote so far. <br><br>Taki Love Story<br> &gt;Taki sensei's wife is a former student and band member of Kitauji<br> She was also Taki's dad's former student <br> She never took gold though at Nationals though <br> Taki and his wife met in college at the music club <br> cue Everybody Loves Somebody <br> Taki's wife becomes a teacher at another school and their band adviser, Taki is also a teacher but avoids band due to hating his dad <br> Wife is too gentle though so the club never get good <br> cue Clannaids, wife dies of illness <br> Taki goes into mourning for a few years, so depressed he can't even touch instruments.  <br> Taki dad tells him to get off his ass  <br> Taki sensei gets assigned to Kitauji because his dad used to work there <br> Taki's wife's dream was that her Kitauji would one day get gold <br> Taki sees this as a chance to fulfill his wife's dream <br> cue Hibike!

You're scaring the Ruris away Shun, stop it.  why is he so cute? why can't i have one of him<br>PS starting the shun vs sora duel rn, this better live up to the lights out+PJs hype <br>and shun better not job</br></br>  <br>He got caught between dimensions and died.</br>  <br>shun's bedroom</br>  <br>Creating Yliaster so he can fix the dimensions and timelines, or he's off gambling in the tops for bitches.</br>  <br>He's attracting the Ruris towards him if anything.</br>  <br>Nerd doesn't even get to hang with my new cool kids.</br>  <br>Tops City while monitoring the others through Tsukikage.</br>  <br> implying shun won't break down upon seeing all the ruris safe and together </br>  <br> The still shot before the blinding light behind him catches up and explodes him to a billion pieces. <br><br> Cards raining from sky <br> Blackwings </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying shun isn't getting his ass carded by Ruri who is evil as shit which breaks his heart </br>  <br>Shun will finally be able to EGAO for real then.</br>  <br>Has Shun ever actually shown strong desire to keep Ruris beside his own safe? The strongest emotion I remember him showing is getting triggered when they use fusion</br>  <br>that would break my heart too though<br><br> explain to this poor soul what EGAO means </br></br></br>  <br>That's some yubel yandere shit right there, Ruri wants to keep Shun to herself forever.</br>  <br>This is EGAO.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't seem to give two shits about either Yuzu or Serena. The only thing interactions he's really shown is:<br><br> Believing Yuzu to be Ruri and immediately getting gut punched <br> Protecting Serena solely because she protected him <br> Listening to Serena because she said Ruri was likely safe <br><br>Otherwise he gives no crap about the other Ruris, only his Ruri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PROTECT ALL RURIS  <br>Yeah, as a card, in her deck. <br><br> He's not her ace </br></br></br>   tfw manlet bird boy doesn't let you break out of jail to find your waifu   YAMEROOOOO    You will never stop Fusion Shun, never.  <br>Don't know but he needs some screen time I need more DDD's.</br>  <br>He'll beat Jack and become Kingu himself and recruit him into the Lancers so he's around all the time.</br>   the real reason Shun learned how to ride a d-wheel   <br>You forgot<br> Went out of his way to watch Yuzu vs Masumi, despite not playing spectator to any other duel during the tournament. </br></br>  D-hhwheel.  <br>Back on Standard watching Netflix.</br>  i've seen a kurosaki win against you before<br>no matter how cute you are this time around i'll be rooting for it to happen again</br>  <br>Planning a new prank for Sawatari in his Synchro Neet Cave</br>  Honestly I want more Yuya thirsty scenes than Shun's Give back Ruri scenes.  DUSTY  <br>GREEN</br>  <br>KAMAITACHI</br>  <br>ENJOY</br>  <br><br>MANJOUME SANDA</br></br>  REEEVERS KARDOO  DUROH  <br>His thirsty scenes are quickly going into "holy shit kid get help" territory. Nigga was about to abandon his friends to go find Yuzu, and even after Crow told him to fuck off he was still all "THIS IS FOR YUZU'S SAKE!"</br>  When willl virtual reality become a thing so I can play cardgames with Ruri?  <br>How is this virtual reality? This is just strapping screens built in a pair of lab goggles on your face.</br>  <br> can barely see through her shirt </br>  <br>You autistic or somethin?</br>  <br> Plot Twist: Reiji's Dimension Mover was actually rerouted ahead of time to send him right back to his NEETcave </br>  <br> dresses like a slut <br> $300 haircut <br> "girlfriend material" <br>Yeah I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  damn this shun vs sora duel is actually very visually impressive, flight sequence caught me off guard. 8 minutes into episode 34 right now, based shun's traps are awesome  <br> virtual <br> not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so <br>By this definition we should be able to touch things in games.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold onto your ass, it's about to get RUM up in here.</br>  <br>I'll be sure to relay your opinion to the people who have been developing VR tech for the past 30 years.<br><br>Hey guys, Anonymous from /a/ says you can't use that term anymore because you can't touch things yet. Shut it down boys, it's over...</br></br></br>  <br>Well he DID go there in the first place for Yuzu and only Yuzu and didn't really give a shit about any other dimension's problems.</br>  <br>Loved that part.</br>  <br> Implying he didn't want any of his friends to get in trouble if they came along with him </br>  <br><br>Yuya becoming Judai</br></br>  <br>sora is legit becoming scary</br>  <br>But the friends of people who escape go to the prison rape cave</br>  <br>ALRIGHT HOLY SHIT SORA WHAT</br>  Xyz focused decks tend to have a lot of traps, Synchro focused decks tend to have a lot of cards that generate tokens and special summoning monster effects. <br><br>Fusion decks need hand generators like poor areas need guns. There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect</br></br>  <br>Does that mean his friends will eventually act like little fuckers towards him, except Gon who will be the Sho at this situation where he forgives Yuya?</br>  <br>Thats if they were involved in any way of the escape plan, so that's why Yuya waned to escape without telling them</br>  <br>this episode has made me homosexual for shun</br>  <br> There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect <br>Have you seen literally any of the fusion related they've made in the last 3 years? Fuck, that would have been broken when Heroes were the only good fusion deck<br><br><br>They didnt say that, they said that those left behind would take the punishment. They knew who knew who, do you think they'd care about how much involvement they had?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon.<br>Shit was so hype.</br></br>  <br>Fusion Advantage<br>(This card's name is always treated as Polymerization.) Draw 1 for every fusion material used in a fusion summon with this card yadda yadda you guys fucking get it once per turn and all that shit<br><br>Fluffals would love it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE DID IT<br>HE WON<br>BASED <br><br>man same here, that was almost ichigo vs byakuya levels of hype</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome the club.</br>  <br>At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. At best, others like Gon and Dennis notice that something's up and are actually helpful.<br><br>Judai's friends excluding Jim and O'Brien directed all their frustration and blame at Judai for how they ended up while not really trying to help the situation themselves because of the marks.</br></br></br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to watch Shun vs Sora again for the first time<br>And you don't even have to wait for the tracks to be released, you fucking prick.</br></br>  We all know Yuya vs Yuri will be the hypest duel  <br> At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. <br> tfw nobody knows you're the main character </br></br>  <br>Damn Serena looks big</br>  <br> for you </br>  <br> tfw when I first saw this on the preview I thought she would hug him </br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? In-universe, Yuya's treated as another member of the group like all the others, rather than being the leader with hanger-ons clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for Judai. For once the rival is the leader (or he's supposed to be).</br>  Guys who says this?   HANASE HANASE    <br>No, it isn't. It's one of the things I liked when I started watching Arc-V, it isn't all about Yuya.<br><br>but it's still sad for poor little tomato</br></br></br>  <br>At this point of time Yuya has the least screen time out of the protagonists, shame since he's my favourite</br>  <br> Summon Blazeman <br> Add this <br> Activate to fuse Blazeman on field and Shadow Mist in hand <br> Draw 2, add a hero with shadow mist effect and make Nova Master or whatever <br>This card is awfully designed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yoshida will come back and restore the peace  </br>  oh shit what yuto vs sora<br>based shun surpassed my expectations, now i just have to count on yuto not jobbing<br>also damn if i didn't expect sora being evil-ish</br></br>  <br>Wait until Violet Flash is an official card since it helps fusion decks reclaim the lost advantage by drawing for each time you fuse alongside the fact that it makes activating fusion/Poly unrespondable to.</br>  <br> Rampant capitalization <br> Bleach </br></br>  <br>I had forgotten about Violet Flash. Yuri can't get an on screen duel fast enough.</br>  <br> Sora was gonna job. He gets his non-jobbing injections later. </br>  <br>I like Bleach too but don't make yourself look like a fucking retard. This is still /a/ we are on, not /dng/.</br>  <br> not /dng/. <br><br>Thank Ra.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's alright as it is, and I like the kid too. Past Yugioh series could occasionally get annoying about MC doing everything of importance.</br>  <br>GX was very bad about that and nobody will ever surpass the amount of duels Judai had, though I liked Judai, but maybe because the abridged shit gave me a view of him just rapping constantly which somehow fits...</br>  <br>i think one of the reasons why he's so good is because he has such little screentime and the people/relationships around him are fleshed out so well<br><br>i don't spend much time on this board but i guess bleach is one of those triggers on here, i'll shut up about it</br></br></br>  <br>Because Judai actually dueled a rapper in the dub and always talked like he came out of the 90's. I like how his deck now outshines Yusei's in getting out fusions over those synchros.</br>  <br>That's a good thing. Most side characters are treated well in Arc-V. It isn't all about Yuya and that's a thing it has over past series.</br>  Remember when people thought we'd never see Mieru again after her duel or have her cards ever released because it was flip and ritual based?  C A R D I A N S <br>A<br>R<br>D<br>I<br>A<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>M U G E N L O O P U</br>  <br>BUY ALL TWO OF THE CARDIANS THAT WILL GET PRINTED</br>  Son let me tell you about Entermachines  <br>Are you going to lead into an revengence reference?</br>  <br>just bumping</br>  <br>What monster did Hippo set?</br>  Any Ruri figmas out yet?  <br>Only dakimuras.</br>    You just got falsely accused of keeping Ruri captive. Shun has heard the accusation and is advancing on your position. What do you do to prepare?  Can't decide which not-yuya is my favorite, Banana, Tomato, eggplant, ...whatever vegetable/fruit Yuri is.<br><br>still I want Sora to show up again love that guy</br></br>  <br>Buy Raid Raptors and hope I have enough to appease him.</br>  <br>It's called writing a decent main cast</br>  <br>shove him straight into a set of pic related</br>  <br>Prepare Super Poly.</br>  <br>Gekidan Niagara</br>  <br>Yuri is either a Dragon Fruit for the pun or a Plum.</br>  <br>Watch his deck crumble because I don't special summon.</br>  <br>I prepare my  anus </br>  <br>I SUMMON MYSELF<br> steps forward </br></br>  <br>BUY FLUFFALS!</br>  Are Prophecy really so shit they can't hurt anybody? Because I like spellcasters and this is an xyz focused deck.  <br>You can probably fine tune it, but for the most part yes, Prophecy is shit.</br>  <br>They are? I remember people bitching about how broken they were. What happened. flat out outclassed by later sets or ban listed fucked them up good?</br>  <br>Isn't that banned though?</br>    <br>Banlist happened</br>  <br>Miami is in America ;)</br>  <br>And now, the only way they'll be back is if the power gap grows enough to make them a non-threat, their banned cards get an errata that shits all over them or Konami prints more xyz monsters for them like a rank 4 and 3. Sadly, there are no more of the arcana to adapt so they fucked up the ying yang.</br>  <br>This is maiami city tho ;)</br>  <br>We wont be seeing them again unless they start fucking with the power gap too much with Pendulum, which is a possibility, but I doubt it, since it seems they're making efforts to have all the summoning methods relatively balanced as best they can.</br>  <br>Cept fusion, synchro and ritual need a really big fucking buff to keep up with xyz and pendulum.</br>  Xyz is too weak right now it needs This card printed.  <br>Well fusion looks like it's starting to get individualized cards for everything. Ritual they almost never pay attention to outside of Black Luster and Nekroz, and Synchro, Synchro just needs better effects I think. <br><br>By next year I expect due to Pendulum and all the Rank 4 Xyzs that a lot of cards are going to get banned due to dumbass combos. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the next summoning method will be like Pendulum Xyz/Synchro/Fusion where we'll get Synchro/Xyz and stuff like Synchros with Overlay Unit effects and all sorts of things. Could be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  1 week and 4 days until KINGU.  <br>Chojiro will become a Cardian himself in a way  once he gets carded </br>  <br>Bad Shun, bad!</br>  <br>I mean, it's neat to see an ossan be part of the group, even if briefly, but at the same time it feels like he's just gonna die or be sacrificed in some way.</br>  <br>Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes, some way to off set that -2,more cards that fuse based on type and attribute rather than names and if they do continue that shitty trend the name material l monsters need to have effects that are worth it. <br><br>synchros need far more level 5, 6,7 and 8 synchros, <br><br>Rituals need ritual monsters and spells that can actually do shit more than ritual summon the monster and all ritual monsters should have built in protection from spells,traps, monster effects. <br><br>These 3 have a lot of work to do before they could ever be worth anything over a rank 4 xyz monster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but I'll give Konami credit that they are trying to finally start making cards to keep up with Xyz at the very least. It's still gonna be awhile before it's all relatively balanced though. What they ban and don't ban though needs a serious look at sometimes, I feel like they just bang their heads on a table when it comes that more so than anything else.</br>  what is an "XYZ" anyway<br>why is it pronounced "x-sheezu"<br>is it XYZ or XZ</br></br>  <br>Because Exceed wasn't cool enough for Konami.</br>  <br>is just gonna end like Instant fusion splashable in some decks and even better in top decks.<br><br>but I am all for it if konami want us to play some degenerancy.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be the perfect topdecking card.</br>  <br>It means Exceeding it's just shortened to Xyz, because the way the Nips pronounce it is basically ik-seez, or their way of pronouncing Exceed, or X-yeez, it's weird, but Engrish, and yeah it's Xyz not Xz.</br>  <br><br>I see, thanks</br></br>  <br>XYZ variant when?</br>  <br>No problem man.<br><br>Probably for Kaiba in the new movie.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a smile there.</br>  <br>They can't make better Fusions until they ban Shadolls, because it'll just make Shadolls broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Synchros until they ban Quasar, because it'll just make Quasar broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Rituals until they ban Nekroz, because it'll just make Nekroz broke as fuck<br>It's a vicious cycle</br></br></br></br>    <br> Dark Rebellion XYZ XYZ Dragon Cannon </br>  <br> Make Nekroz broken <br> Make </br></br>  <br>No need to be tsun now.</br>  <br>I'm busy Shun go away.</br>  <br>How will making better synchros make quasar broke as fuck?</br>  <br>If there's one thing I know about Yugioh<br>It's that what is broke can be made even more broke if Konami makes the right moves</br></br>  <br><br><br>Guess we better make some new Ritual cards!<br><br>BUY NEKROZ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Busy getting fat?</br>  <br>I'm simply stating they're already at that stage, you don't need to *make* them broken</br>      <br> If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon. <br> Shit was so hype. </br></br>  <br>omg, I read it in his voice...</br>  <br>What happened when MAXIMUM JIHAD?</br>  <br>I cant wait until the day that Shun gets absolutely destroyed, and I mean destroyed, he had a chance in that second duel. <br><br>This place is going to fucking explode.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun gets absolutely destroyed <br>pls no <br>that being said i can't wait until the day reiji gets destroyed</br></br></br>    <br> making memes for a character with literally 4 scenes </br>  <br> R-Ruri <br> W-what about heartulando? <br> Heartland? I've always lived in Academia <br>And then he died</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun is going to go down hard. Reiji probably wont since he seems to be the main rival, he'll at least put up a fight, even if he's going to lose to Yuya or Leo eventually.<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one that brought them to Heartland silly~  Yugo Shokan </br>  <br>Serena is Ruri is still possible.<br>Seriously why are they hiding Ruri's design at this point. Is it just to foster shitty theories like the one I just typed and Ruri=Yuzu? Because come on.</br></br>  <br>It might make sense considering Yuri/Ruri, though I'm curious why Leo only calls her Serena-sama, he didn't say Yuzu-same when telling Yuri to go after her. <br><br>If anybody Yuzu has the best chance of actually being Ruri considering they both have that bird swoop, Yuto said Polymerization doesn't fit her, which is just an odd thing to say regardless of Fusion attacking Xyz, and then you have her mysterious birth and bracelet.</br></br></br>  <br>it's stabilized antimatter monsters</br>  <br>Nah. Ruri is being saved as a surprise. It'll feel like christmas once they show her.</br>  <br>I've been playing around with the unlikely idea that when the girls get to fusiontown, they're immediately mindwiped ala Masumi to believe they're Serena. But I guess with the childhood flashbacks that's not possible.<br><br>(I'm also the loser who keeps saying we won't be seeing Rin in person ever, which is why we get to see flashbacks of her.)</br></br></br>   Rewatching Shun vs Sora <br> Blaze Falcon is taken by Sora <br> Shun starts talking about always being prepared for their comrades being taken before playing Revolution Force <br>Ok yeah, Ruri is definitely gonna be brainwashed or some shit<br>And then Shun will rank her up into a Rank 6 Ruri</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Leo planned the Xyz dimension's destruction, he did not foresee the need for alliances. The Fusion users would sweep through the other dimensions, systematically exterminating their enemies and dismantling the proud xyz users. But the leo's vision was cynical. He did not count on the brave sacrifices the Xyz dimension's heroes were willing to make. After the Fusion's offensive seized the Heartland tower, Leo turned its sights to the synchro dimension,Believing the xyz Dimension was still recovering from its heavy losses, Fusion forces charged into Heartland Academy, where they were caught off guard by the full force of the Resistance's Army. The Resistance obliterated the Fusion squadron and the Battle of Heartland Academy became the Resistance's first major victory in the war.</br>  <br>KATTOBINGU DA<br>ORE</br></br>  <br>The news spread across the City, rekindling lost hopes and re-energizing exhausted defenders. The Resistance Army moved on to defend other battlefronts, but a courageous force of Duelist remained at heartland Academy to await the Fusion user's return. The vengeance of the Fusion came swiftly, elite fusion users army closed in on the Academy grounds to recoup their losses, but Professor Belth Allusis, seven dozen of the Resistance's finest duelist, and four thousand casual's players dug in to defend the Academy's grounds...or get carded trying. The disparity was staggering. An unprecedented Fusion army, fifty thousand strong, descended on Heartland Academy's brave defenders. The defenders were undaunted. With no expectations of survival, they were mindful of their duty.</br>  <br><br>But overconfident Fusion Professors threw all their armies' might into the direct assault and their ground forces fell in droves. For every Xyz duelist who was carded, ten Fusion users were killed. The Fusion professors was forced to call in reinforcements. Despite the defenders determination, their lines were whittled away until only a handful of Duelist remained. They rallied to Professor Allusis for a final stand. Fusion Professor Moff Zellos offered to spare Professor Allusis if he and his brave comrades would surrender. Neither pride nor foolhardiness drove the defender's decision. They were guided by their sidedeck. They had passed beyond the fear of death. Their glorious last stand will never be forgotten. Allusis and his men fell, but not before the Fusion users were driven to retreat. The Battle of Heartland Academy was a draw. The heroes of Heartland Academy inspired bold new xyz strategies that eventually halted the Fusion's advances. In retrospect, though, the Resistance lost too many duelsit in the early days of the war. The execution of the Leo's brilliant strategy was flawless. Survival was the best the Resistance could hope for.</br></br>  So, where the fuck is Yuri? Is he still at Standard? Or did he go back to Academia?  <br><br><br> same guy who kept posting edited Darth Bane quotes </br></br></br>  <br>You kidding? I loved Baneposter-kun.</br>  Yuya has gone full Yuzufag.

They should in no way have had the advantage on Xyz. Makes me curious if GX characters actually are their teachers.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the Fusion dimension trained all their soldiers for war and invasion while Xyz dimension just dueled for fun</br>  <br>Even still they're just using generic decks for most of their soldiers and just trouncing most people. <br><br>That and it's pretty safe to assume that all the DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal characters barring the main characters exist in this weird dimensional rift/alternate timeline, so where are half of them even at? Also how do some characters even work such as say Kaiba? If KaibaCorp exists in Synchro, considering the Duel Runners, then what is he doing? Just retired, and if Kaiba would likely exist, I'd assume Pegasus and all the DM/GX characters exist within Synchro too, unless there is technically a Kaiba in both Standard and Fusion as well and they don't take place concurrently. <br><br>Ya know, I'm just confused by this whole stuff honestly. I know it's meant to just be callbacks, but I'm sure they have to have some type of explanation for it at the very least, I don't think they'd just do it without any type of plan whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>artist?</br>  <br>Do not sexualize my monstah kado</br>  Soon  <br>Already ahead of ya there Standard.
