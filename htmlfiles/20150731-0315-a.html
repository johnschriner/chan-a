Then get let down by HANATE MONSUTAH but it'll grow on you. Have you gotten to the LDS Trio yet?</br>  <br>Go to Toys R Us or Target.<br><br>Also, should I go to the preview event on the first? I just recently got back into the game and have a tradtional/unlimited format Blue Eyes Ultimate deck, and I want to make a Red Eyes deck and a Toon deck. I pulled Lord of the Red's ritual and my friend pulled LotR, and wanted to trade for my comic hand, but I want to build a toon deck too.<br><br>Also, should I buy the new Gold Series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He didnt watch the OVA with the rocket </br>  How would you all feel if when the dub makes to heartland, academia and the city they throw in all these ridiculous referances to the old series like the Obelisk Force talking about Aster,Zane or Alexis or Shun and Yuto using some form of Yuma's catchphrase or Jack and Crow make quips about Yusei missing or something? They already made a reference to Yugi being the king of games in the arc-v dub so far.  <br> let down by HANATE MONSUTAH <br>It grew on me, but song would have been better if the singer's voice were a bit stronger.</br></br>  <br>If you're collecting, you should ALWAYS go to the sneak peek. The pull rates are typically better than from regular boxes.<br><br>Just fair warning, Black Stone and Flare Metal are both Secret Rare, so building Red Eyes is going to be expensive and difficult.<br><br>If you're looking to play seriously, invest in something either cheap and relatively strong (U.A. or Yosenju) or genuinely successful in the meta game (Burning Abyss, Shaddolls, Nekroz).<br><br>Be prepared to buy Singles. Collecting 3 of a specific Secret Rare can take more than an entire CASE, but Black Stone and Flare Metal are going to be relatively cheap as singles because the competitive market is largely going to ignore them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, while I do want to collect I do want to play too. I'll go if I have enough cash to spare since I'm a bit broke atm. <br><br>Another card I want is Mirror Force dragon, but it's already up to ~$50, so I feel like it'll be better to just buy packs and hope to pull it. Problem is Fang of Critias is the same rarity, so I'd need to get lucky enough to pull that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I just started episode 1. I like the idea of all these duel schools kinda like cram schools in Japan. It's interesting. One thing I'm wondering is, with all this solid technology that Arc-V has, can the monsters actually hurt the players when they attack directly?</br>  <br>I actually like Hanate since the Jack v Yuya was the first episode I ever saw. It's subtle but it's got a nice rhythm to it and I like the singer's voice.</br>  In Neo Domino City, Dr. Fudo's prodigy son, Yusei, is finishing his third engineering doctorate, this time with the thesis worked upon conjointly with his fiance, Izayoi Aki, by looking into bio-engineering and how technology can better be manipulated with the Momentum Drive. Young Yusei tends to get too caught up in his work, and Ms. Aki takes it upon herself to interrupt his studies to check his vitals every so often, generally recommending the two go out for a night in Tops, either watching Duel Chasers hunt down dirty hungry Commons, or visiting the skating rink. (This reporter notes that Ms. Aki is terrible at skating, as something about her seems to keep her perpetually off-balance.)  <br>Yes, players do, on occasion, get injured by the monsters. It's also implied pretty early on that Solid Vision with Mass can kill people. In most duels, direct attacks are softened, and when the little kids duel, the action field is softened like a bounce-house to keep them from getting hurt.</br>  <br> so I feel like it'll be better to just buy packs and hope to pull it <br>Thats retard gambler logic. Its that much money for a reason, your chances of pulling some junk rare instead are astronomically higher. Save if you want it that much, or buy something cheaper, trying to cut costs by buying packs never works. The house always wins</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x-5<wbr>xY6ClVeU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I hate these endings. They basically end the show as different people, since they have no recollection of prior events</br>  <br>Honestly, give up on Critias. The pull-rate was throttled to a ridiculous level, and you will spend WAY more than $50 trying to pull him, meanwhile you won't get anything of value from DRL2, and Mirror Force Dragon is going to drop to $5-10 in another month or two.<br><br>Also, Gold Series Return of the Bling is shit. You don't want it. If you got the urge to buy packs, either wait a week for CORE, or pick up some DUEA, NECH and SECE. DUEA in particular, as Dante is one of, if not the most expensive card on the competitive scene right now, and people will trade through the nose to get him.</br></br></br>  <br>Idk, there's some cards in there I like, Paladin of Dark Dragon for one, and the other Legendary Knight/Dragon cards. I already pulled Tyrant Wing though, so that's good.<br><br>I might go to the preview for CORE.</br></br></br>  <br>Paladin of Dark Dragon is VERY easy to pull. So is pretty much everything that isn't Tarotrei, Mimicat or the Dragons, none of which are worth the trouble you will go through trying to get them.<br><br>Unless you are completely unable to go to the sneak peek, GO TO THE SNEAK PEEK! GODDAMN. If you don't get a sneak peek kit, but you buy packs from that set, you are throwing your money away. It shouldn't even be a question you should have to ask. If you play the TCG, you need to go to sneak peeks.<br><br>You might meet some new friends too. The event itself is a lot of fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you play the TCG, you need to go to sneak peeks <br>I wouldnt say that, going to the sneak peek with the intent of making money is dumb, unless you know you'll be able to unload the cards for pre release hype prices. Go if you think it seems fun, not with the expectation of going plus</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I've already got one friend who will most likely go with me. Too bad I probably won't get the mat though. But at least I'll get the preview packs and card.</br>  <br>The mat is a crapshoot, dude. Everyone is on a mostly even playing field, so if you pull one good piece of tech, you can easy-mode your way to the top. They also give one away as a door prize. You've got the same odds as everyone else.</br>  New information about upcoming episodes when?  <br>Well I'll have to modify my deck to be tourney legal, since I play traditional with my friends. Damn shame since I have Chaos Emperor in there.</br>  <br>Unless your shop is weird, you're only supposed to play with the cards you pull from the Sneak packs. You don't need a deck, and you can't use any cards except for what you get in your packs.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Still though, need a tourney deck.</br>  One of these 5 is not like the others.  <br>The one with the clones, or the one with the D-Wheel as a spirit partner substitute?</br>  <br>It's Yusei, his counterpart isn't even alive.</br>  <br>Stat with Cyborg Ninja Baseball. You can build the whole deck for about $20.</br>  <br>I could just find some cards to replace my forbidden cards, but my BEU deck might not really be the best against modern ones.</br>  <br>You'll get blown out of the water. Power Creep is intense in Yugioh. If you want to see how crazy the game is, ccopy a topping Burning Abyss, Qliphort, Nekroz, Ritual Beast, Tellarknight or Shaddoll build, and play it on DN or YGOPro, even just against the AI. Getting up the speed will really help.<br><br>If you want a real life deck that can scrape some wins, then start with U.A. or Yosenju. They're both very reasonably priced, and can snatch wins from the rest of the meta, just not frequently enough to be Tier-1/2 on their own.<br><br>After you get used to where the game is at, then you can start playing pet-decks, because you'll have a better idea of how to handle common problems.<br><br>I still play Fabled, LV and (occasionally) Aliens, but making them playable now is a ton of work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's his bike tho</br>  <br>No Yubel or crimson dragon?</br>  <br>Yeah, I noticed, I played my friend's Masked Hero tourney deck, he killed me on his second turn.</br>  Based Japan<br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=<wbr>/product_id/RJ159607.html</wbr></br>  <br>OTKs used to be a big deal, now they're everywhere, and nobody seems to care. The only thing keeping everybody from rushing OTKs on one-another is the fact that you're expected to stop them, counter them, and OTK on your following turn. Pretty much everyone CAN OTK, but they're still very rare because they're suicidally dangerous.</br>  <br>Ruris are not for lewd.</br>  <br>Well the new pack's Red Eyes support should make a deck more viable. Maybe I'll get a starter deck and modify it. I just don't want to sink in a whole ton of money, and I do still enjoy pulling cards from packs.</br>  <br>It's Judai. All the other characters are with their spirit guides, but Yubel got left out for some reason.</br>  <br>July isn't even over yet dude, you're not getting anything until the 7th at the earliest.</br>  Jack's duel with Yuya<br>Yuya- Pre Red Nova Jack<br>Jack- Post Red Nova Jack</br></br>  <br>Red Scar-Right Nova Dragon with Double Synchro Tuning Summon when?</br>  <br>Sound Duel 4 when</br>  I'm holding my penis in front of my monitor as I post this image.  <br> you will never fuck Yugo and scream BANANA as you cum </br>  <br> you will never rip and tear apart the Ruri's assholes </br>  <br> you will never make love with R  eira </br>  <br>Kuri kuri did more as a helpful spirit guide than Yubel ever did. He's also more marketable than a demonic hermaphrodite.</br>  <br> you will never cuddle with Ruri <br><br>Just banish me to the shadow realm already.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Yubel was never helpful at all, she did want to destroy and rule everything because her childhood crush had long been dead and the reincarnated one had forgotten about her.</br>  <br> you will never rip and tear apart   Y uri's asshole</br>  <br> dat Bloody Tears-like intro </br>  <br> tfw </br>  <br>I see nothing wrong with this image. Fusion scum should be put in their place.</br>  What actually bothers me the most about Synchro is how the Lancers spend so much time walled off from each other. They have this motley crew of contrasting personalities and egos of varying sizes, but they literally put them in solitary cells away from each other. Even a few of them don't have character motivations that extend that far, like Sawatari, there's potential gold in them simply interacting more. If the Lancers have to keep separate from Yuzu and Yugo for plot reasons, why couldn't those 2 be put in different buildings or floors so the Lancers could still see each other? <br><br>There's still some of what I'm talking about, like with Gon straightmanning for Dennis and Sawatari, and Yuya and Reiji butting heads again next episode. But I'd be a lot more forgiving of whatever other issues Synchro has if they simply did more with all these characters they went through the trouble of establishing and defining. In a previous thread someone said that Jack was like Yuya's Reiji for this arc, but why can't Reiji be his Reiji? There's a lot more there than with some guy Yuya's known for ~15 minutes.<br><br>Sorry if this is blogging</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely agreed. Fucking filth.</br>  <br>Doujins  soon </br>  <br>Yuya and Reiji are the absolute Yugi and Kaiba clones of the entire series. He may not really be the truest rival for Yuya but he's a definite foil. Sawatari is more in line for being a rival Entertainment Duel wise, they both specialize in it. Jack is for fan service and him sparring with Yuya is because Yuya is a Yusei stand-in. He's probably going to lose to Yuri in someway anyhows.</br>  <br>I want to bully Yuri while Yuto and Shun laugh in the distance. Also, his dragon is horrible.</br>  <br><br>i also agree, and i would not look at them while im at it after im done i'll just walk out after getting dress and never call the next day.</br></br>  <br>I want to bully Yuri  with my dick. </br>  <br>don't bully the shota</br>  <br>Well that's not what it actually looks like, Yugo's was like that too, it was all glowy white and shit.</br>  <br>Fusion scum most likely have micro dicks. Only superior XYZ Duelists are capable of pleasing their female comrades.  He will never be able to give Ruri the D she deserves. </br>  <br> tfw Yuto will never get all the lewd art he deserves because of   EGAO </br>  <br><br>His hair was made to be pulled and I'm going to pull it.</br></br>  <br>That dragon is pretty lewd.<br> sharp blades and claws <br> long xenomorph head <br> two pronged tail <br>It's a walking death and sex machine. Truly perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I hope you will never get separated again from tomato, Yuzu.  Thanks for the night, though. </br>  Why is Shun so shit? He ruined the whole episode.  Cannot wait until Reiji BTFOs his dad in style during the fusion dimension arc.  <br>Stop posting Sora, we know it's you.</br>  <br>Only after Reiji flips his shit at Reira betraying him for Leo and then Leo whips his ass with D/D/Ds. <br><br>Remember Serena was surprised to see Reiji use them, so it's likely Leo uses them as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing what Reiji says in  could it be that Reiji is training Yuya in facing D/D/Ds because Leo is using them?</br>  <br>Maybe, or he's just fucking with him, whichever. I mean he also did say in their second duel he wasn't even at full strength yet.</br>  <br>I can't wait till everyone shoves Reiji to the ground and just kicks the shit out of him for his terrible plans.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>Reijihaters have no taste</br>  <br>I don't hate him but his plans are awful and he's probably on the edge of going full damage control</br>  <br>The only people that dare defy Reiji are Sawatari and Serena.</br>  <br>Mirror Force dragon wont drop. Look at Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight and Eye of Timaeus</br>  <br> I don't hate him but his plans are awful <br><br>His plans consist of him sitting back and doing nothing for 90% for the time, and later stepping in and claiming everything went according his keikaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget it always works in the end.<br><br>I want to know what the fuck he did in Synchro, did he just kick the door to the Council down, push up his glasses, and say keikaku and that was it?</br></br></br>  <br> hey fags your home is gonna get carded we can help. <br> why should we believe you fucking hipster? <br> BECAUSE KEIKAKU THAT'S WHY! </br></br></br>   be head of security <br> working to subjugate the filthy commons <br> every time you try to enact keikaku, your troops either ignore your keikaku, or you get fucked over by your superiors <br> some random strangers suddenly show up, using never before seen summoning mechanics <br> including one guy who won't stop talking about a 'Ruri' while using a deck revolving around carpet-bombing your city <br> try and take them in <br> your superiors insist they be allowed to play in the friendship cup, even ruining your attempts to recapture them <br> you have no way to enact keikaku with the filthy commons and these strange intruders because of your superiors <br>being jean-michel is suffering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  how things really work in the synchro dimension<br> the king controls nothing <br> the "king" cant change anything <br> King is a empty title <br> the 1% controls everything i.e the corporations do <br> headed by a "council of elders" <br> has an loyal army that takes people away <br> clams that their "friends" with the lower class but its really a sham <br>  force "buy blackwings" to the masses <br>  the only reporter who can do anything is too blind to see the truth <br> the fusion is their ally and they tasked the council to weaken the lancers <br> Reiji really doesnt have a plan. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I have the same glasses as reiji they're just a little more rounded <br><br>It's time, who wants to join my duel school?</br></br></br>  <br>I think Yugi figured out that the King of Games title is fucking worthless. Only Kaiba, Judai, Jack, and a bunch of idiots give a crap about it.</br>  <br>Too bad Jack isn't a Signer despite Scar-Right technically still being a servant of the Crimson Dragon. Maybe he could've used RDA to punch a hole in the corrupt society of Synchro but MUH KINGU is more important.</br>  <br>Me. XYZ scum here.</br>  <br>Crimson Dragon doesn't exist in Synchro, Clear Wing has taken it's place, it even warps too.</br>  <br>Good, gooood.</br>  you're a resident of the Arc-V world. which dimension do you hail from, which deck do you use, and are there any cards you'd have in your archetype that don't exist yet? how would your boss be improved to fit more as a boss?<br><br> xyz dimension <br> using Inzektors <br> have a RUM to turn Exa-stag into Exa-Beetle <br> Exa-stag gets the full atk bonus from equipping monsters, not just half <br> exa-beetle doesn't need to pitch your own faceup card to pop an opponent's faceup card </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god, I was listening to the Padme Funeral music from ep. 3 when I opened this, it fits too well.</br>  <br> Fusion  <br> Masked HEROs <br> Dark Law <br> I don't need to fix Dark Law  <br><br>If I could make any deck though, I'd do Standard and a Gundam or Star Wars theme.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HEROes(even masked HEROes) are already used by someone.</br>  <br>Masked Heroes were never in the anime, nor does it matter two shits about Arc-V, Judai doesn't exist.</br>  <br>masked HEROes were in the manga.</br>  <br> Standard <br> Red-Eyes (Jonoichi's wasn't Red-eyes) <br> Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon <br> I think being immune to card effects and inflicting 500 LP of damage every time they activate an effect is enough of a boss </br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack caring about being King was more of a personal thing to him. I think he wanted to be his own King, one that people can look up to and one with good values as a human being. Not the fake Goodwin King shit where he was an asshole that didn't care about his opponents. Him wanting to be the best in the world at Riding Duels at the end of 5D's was him prepping himself to be a true opponent for Yusei somewhere down the line. Also, he's an entertainer like Yuya but with way more of an ego streak. I still don't understand why Jack has the right to trash-talk Yuya's style when ARC-V Jack is pretty much Fortune Cup Jack IE being an asshole who likes to humiliate opponents and stroke his dick. Yusei and Carly not existing fucked his shit up.</br>  <br> Standard Dimension <br> Madolche Deck <br> Madolche Tordiva (Normal summon to special summon a level 4 madolche from deck) <br> Madolche Mocha-Icevoker (Rank 3 2 monsters, literally just madolche flavored flavored MX-Saber Invoker) <br> Madolche Nights and Tea Break negate and destroy instead of bouncing, work with Choco-a-la-mode <br> Choco-a-la-mode's effect works even on CXYZ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know they were, manga is irrelevant.

I bet she hates him </br></br>  <br>I bet she does.<br><br> Because he always fails to notice her advances. </br></br></br>  <br>I kind of wish it was Dennis rather than Sora in the manga that was teamed up with Sawatari and Shun.</br>  <br>I've been trying to build a Deskbot deck, but does 006 do anything for the deck? I have 3 copies of 005 in my deck for easy access to Infinity and to pop scales, but they don't seem to benefit from Pendulum summoning since you pull them from either your grave or your deck. I also don't get the Synchro monster.</br>  <br>inb4 Dennis is a runner like Yuya</br>  <br> Xyz dimension <br> Lightsworn  <br> Rank 8 Lightsworn that requires two Judgement dragons that can destory all monsters on the field apart form lightsworn monsters and the effect cannot be negated.

It's against the law.</br>  <br>Doesn't mask change only target Heroes? What's the point of that in a BA deck...</br>  <br>Plenty of people do it, not like BA is going to top HEROES, with how easy to can get their masked heroes out, you have to mill like crazy to get Dark Law out in a BA deck or just be lucky, by that point you likely already have everything you need to win anyways, it's pointless. <br><br>Mask Change II</br></br></br>  <br>Mask Change Second doesn't.</br>  <br><br>Ah, I completely forgot about that card, my bad then.</br></br>  <br> Judai could have the best deck out of all main characters if he got Masked Heroes after Edo pushed his shit in <br> instead he got fucking Neos </br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that you lose to your deck  and minerva is a prize card. </br>  <br>I was hoping he'd start using them during his extent as Supreme Kingu, but alas, he didn't. I imagine if he ever got an updated deck he definitely would.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I've found the meme decks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in the TCG.</br>  <br>If only Evil Heroes had a way to search for their fusion card. They'd actually be useful. <br>Neos if also an easy fix, remove the return to extra bullshit and give a good "treated as Neos while on the field or graveyard" card, pretty much Alius without being a Gemini.</br></br>  <br> meme deck </br>  <br>Because he lost? big deal. Yuzu lost to Masumi, Dennis and shat her pants to Yuri.</br>  <br>Judai is the hardest protagonist to beat in tag force special. If he's not fusion summoning via poly he's mask changing</br>  <br>But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together, and then there was that time where he depleted his hand just to give Shun, the guy who shits out his hand in one turn, some Pendulum cards.</br>  <br>Yuya has two pretty cool decks he can use right now. Performapals are great for beatdown players and Magicians are insane right now.</br>  <br> But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together <br>Seriously, all of you are like a broken record. In the end it doesn't matter if Crow talks about his sob story and Gon attacks regardless or whatever. Gon loses because the writers want him to lose. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Such a shame. He and Jaden have new cards I would love to hear them voice those cards.</br>  <br><br>And Crow could would have had no trouble at all if he put his monsters in defense position.<br>What other what if scenarios are we gonna go through?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya might still have a chance if Pendulum Wizard was anything to go by.</br>  <br>What new cards does Judai have?</br>  <br> But he could have easily won if he didn't give Crow time to get his shit together <br>That happens in every single Action Duels where somebody gets saved by a last minute Action Card<br><br> and then there was that time where he depleted his hand just to give Shun, the guy who shits out his hand in one turn, some Pendulum cards <br> Everybody has to step back so Shun can look cool in Tag Duels <br>That isnt unique to Gon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena will be revealed to have a little brother, screen cap this.<br><br> He will be Sora. And then Serena and Shun will be paired, so will be Sora and Ruri. </br></br></br>  <br> Serena and Shun <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Try Mieru, she uses Nekroz.</br>  <br> Ruining the sanctity of Ruriraptors with Crowscum faggotry </br>  <br> That happens in every single Action Duels where somebody gets saved by a last minute Action Card <br><br>Except for Sora the first time he dueled Shun, he had no time, it was set the action card and the duel keep going with you knocked out, or get knocked out and lose.</br></br></br>  <br> Sora with a Ruri <br>sick fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Shun and Crow tag duel FUCKING WHEN</br></br>  <br>Hopefully never.</br>  <br>I don't think Shun does tag duels. He prefers to be out numbered.</br>  <br>He used to tag duel.<br><br>Yuto/Shun vs. Ruri/Shun, yes, he had two duel disks and two decks. Whoever won got to pick what they do. <br><br>Ruri/Shun always won so they got to go watch birds in the park. Yuto never did get to play D&amp;D with them.</br></br></br></br></br>  will best girl  make her first appearance?   <br>Actually wait I take that back he has jumped into a lot of battle royales and has jumped in to help his new comrades so technically it's possible.</br>  Is Yuma the MC with more defeats?  Is there a reason why monosubs didn't release ep.65 and proceeded to ep.66?  <br>She already did. <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>He probably forgot thanks to EVO and thinks he's uploaded it and nobody has told him.</br>  <br>I want to impregnate that Ruri!  And take responsibility.  </br>  <br>Don't we all.</br>   tfw you can't multitask while watching anime because you don't know Japanese and have to read the subtitles to know what's going on.   <br>Why would you want to multi-task?</br>  You should be giving it your full attention anyway. Multitasking is for losers.<br>But you already knew that.</br>  <br> multitasking when watching anime <br>Pleb. If anime bores you so much, you don't belong here.<br><br>Or stop watching shit, you haremfaggotron.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he wants to pretend to be an anime fan because it's the closest thing he will ever have to having an "identity" but he doesn't actually want to watch anime.</br>  <br>I just want to be able to have anime on in the background while I do homework or check text messages and stuff...</br>  <br><br><br><br> ...I wish I knew Japanese ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking anime is a hobby that doesn't deserve your attention <br><br>Like I said, get the fuck outta here.</br></br></br>  <br> not being an one monitor lowlife that has to do with minimising <br>Get on my level. <br><br> Although the most I do is read some shitty LN/WN or work on my own shitty novel </br></br></br></br>   People who only listen to the audio while multi-tasking <br>No. Just pause. These kind of people are the ones asking/complaining about obvious shit in anime threads.</br>  <br>リア充爆発しろ</br>  <br>Don't be a retard work the windows.<br>Can't you work your windows?</br></br>  <br>That's why you watch dubs, anon</br>  Same OP.  <br><br>You cant watch dubs, you watch subs. You listen to dubs.</br></br>  <br>I don't even care, fuck you OP.</br>  <br> namefagging </br>  <br> bumping this shit thread </br>  <br>Bump</br>  <br>You're not fooling me.</br>  <br> Implying you need to put full attention to know everything is still daijobu </br>  <br>That's just great.<br><br> want to watch a show <br> but not watch the screen <br> but not listen to the original audio <br>There are people that do this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how I watched Bebop</br>  <br>This. It's also why people make threads asking if they should watch something instead of just watching it for themselves and why people make threads asking what entries they can skip in a series.</br>  <br>I don't understand why those "should I watch this threads" are made.<br>Aren't the posters apprehensive about being spoiled instantly. <br>I normally don't make or enter threads unless I have finished a series or at least am caught up.</br></br></br>  <br> Aren't the posters apprehensive about being spoiled instantly.  <br>They don't actually care about watching it, they just want to know if it's worth the effort of pretending to for the amount of Anime-Nerd cred it gives them.</br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with understanding Japanese, you're just too retarded to multitask a fairly simple thing.</br>  <br>I didn't know anime had nerd-cred.</br>  I paint my Warhammer figurines by holding them high up in front of the screen, letting me glance at the subtitles at the same time. Step it up OP.  <br><br>Or a more obvious example are recommendation threads that look like<br> I know fuck all about anime but want to get into it anyway <br>Why would someone want to "get into" anime if they've not seen a thing they want to watch? Think the answer is Nerd-cred, that they want to be able to tell people how nerdy and quirky they are?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally what the fuck.<br>"Everything is daijoubu" is the trademark for 90% of conventional media. Our whole lives are built on happy endings, because happy endings mean you can look forward to tomorrow instead of living your whole life like a Jews during the Nazi Occupation. People live on happy endings because you don't want to have hardships happen to you, and when they do, you are FUCKING HAPPY to get out of those. <br><br>Anime is far from being an "everything is always daijoubu" medium. But like all media, it thrives on bringing happiness and respite from the world. If you want to see "everything ends bad", you can watch horror-themed media. But even those feature their share of good ends.<br><br>You need to get the fuck out of your fucking wet dakimakura-ridden cave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dont take this the wrong way Anon<br><br>but from what I hear these are really dark times for the Warhammer franchise<br><br>is it worth picking up now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay.</br>  <br>Anon daijoubo desu ka?</br>  <br>Ah, this is what i thought everytime when watching American TV dramas!<br>I can speak japanese, but my english is very bad.</br></br>  You guys do realize like half of an episode is a static head with a mouth flapping onscreen right?<br>Of course this doesn't count if you're watching action, but even then, you get completely dialogue based episodes in those too.</br>  If you feel like you need to do other things while watching a show then you don't really like the show in the first place.  <br>Yeah but if you talk to people about anime outside of the computer its gross or embarrassing.</br>  <br>I used to know someone who was always saying he was an otaku but actually watched like 15 anime in his life. It's has you said, some people want to be identified as anime fan for some reason but don't enjoy anime.</br>  <br>When you think about it though, those people probably browse other boards where they see anime stuff posted all the time and in the banners and everywhere on the site. It would only be natural to be curious about what would seem like a big part of 4chan, especially if they browse a lot.</br>  <br>It would only be 50% because everything is either a comedy or a tragedy. Thats two halfs bozo.</br>  <br>This. If you only enjoy a hobby when you're doing it the same time as something else then clearly it's not a real hobby. Like how someone who only ever listens to music on the radio couldn't really be considered a music fan</br>  <br>How do you make a thread without an image?</br>  <br><br><br>They want 4chan-cred then. Essentially the same thing outside of meatspace</br></br></br>  <br>Even tragedies have a certain knack for ending in a good or bittersweet way. Rare are the things that actually go full tragedy up to the end, and if they do, they get the official 4chan "edgy as fuck" seal of disapproval.</br>  <br>They might not even be curious about it as a big part of 4chan, they might see a glimpse of something they like or something that intrigues them and want to begin exploring it more.<br>They might think back to when they watched dbz or something as a kid and remember how they enjoyed it.<br>Its a certain innocents away from the jaded superfan.</br></br></br>  <br>Tragedies rarely go into the full tragedy route.<br>The most you usually get is the heroic sacrifice at the end.</br></br>    <br><br>Well it wouldn't hurt if in the end people were just melancholy. They could just kinda be sad that things did not work out the way they wanted it to.</br></br>  <br> anime fans <br> just sad <br>Do you even know how hardcore animefags react upon having their headcannon crushed by the author? "Just being sad" doesn't even fucking start to dent it.</br></br></br>  <br>no like the characters are sad</br>  <br>うん、あるある<br>何でも大丈夫というの方がいい<br>実の日常はずっとあまり<br>思い出させなくてもいいのに<br>現在のことを思い浮かべていて<br>必ず自分は心の中を<br>思い出させられなくてほしい<br>とかと考えていましたんですが</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 04 [720p] <br>It's time.</br>  First for Gurashis have the best butts   SEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

Is it any better in the manga?  It's like she is wearing diapers.  <br>Well, it could be that it's somehow not a 6 inch deep ocean and that she was snorkeling somewhere that's not the shore.<br><br>Just a thought.</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought Yuki's holes in her socks where because they were ripped.</br>  <br>The manga is infinitely times better yes.</br>  <br>Is this especial true with how they manage past and present events?</br>  <br>They'll be all together dancing and eating at the end.  The zombies I mean. </br>  <br>where did the stockings go?</br>  <br>There are only two(?) flashbacks in the manga and it's all about Megu-nee, seeing how the anime is going it's going to be nothing but flashbacks for the next couple episodes.</br>  <br><br>Shovel-chan has the best butt.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jyjytrqxtp.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>   18 years old girl    That soothing ED music <br>Who said this wasn't a healing anime</br>  <br>How did they get away showing this multiple times?</br>  <br>Draw something better then, you twentysomething man.</br>  <br> That ED </br>  <br>Took them off so they don't get dirty while she slicks to the though of Kei.</br>  <br>WTF man.

A PS4, Wii U, and Not-Splatoon game show up in the recent manga chapters.</br></br>    I don't understand, isn't she the tomboy? Why is she wearing a fucking garterbelt?<br> Not that I'm complaining. </br>  <br>It's probably one of those perpetual present-day settings.</br>  <br>I really, really, really like this picture.</br>  <br>I wish to bite her thighs lightly and enjoy licking that area with my tongue.</br>  So that ending some confirmed she died right?  <br><br>Tomboy is shovel, she's just the kouhai</br></br>  I think this is first gakkou gurashi ep that I was disappointed with. They removed the silly boys hitting at Miki at the shopping mall and made Kurumi somehow super competent compare to the rest of the people that fell prey to zombie.  Animation error on the door sign at 10:33. I wonder how they missed it.  <br>yes, that's the joke, congrats on figuring it out</br>  <br>I still can't draw as well.</br>   removing every other character from the mall <br>For what purpose?</br>  What's the purpose of fucking up the timeline like this and filling almost half of the anime with flashbacks?  <br>Shovel is the tomboy, Miki is just a slutty boy.</br>  <br>But the color fading out and Kurumi becoming The One was the best part of the episode.</br>  Interesting.  <br>They finally dropped the ball and it was going so well too.</br>  <br>All it confirmed or me was that they were crazy lesbians for each other. Previously just thought they were friends.<br><br>Also this anime is making me a manga snob. Everything they change is worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Just the stream, downloading the subs.</br>    They need to stop cramming that fucking dog into everything, Jesus.  <br>Their relationship reminds me of those 2 girls from corpse party that were in a similar situation and the other girl leaves and consequently dies too.</br>  <br>But there's a reason audio is better on vinyl and it's not a technical reason, they just fuck it up on purpose on the CDs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudn<wbr>ess_war</wbr></br>  <br>That's no way to talk about Megu-nee.</br>  <br>I wouldn't talk about Megu-nee like that, I love her.</br>  <br>You can't expect every episode to be 10/10, no anime has ever done that before.</br>   Megu-nee suddenly in the car <br><br>They don't even care anymore.</br></br>    <br>I would guess because it's harder to animate and the VA are too expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. The mall episode and the other survivors were the best thing about that entire volume.</br>  I'd let her eat my brain  <br>That's real art.</br>  <br>According to the anime timeline I thought this was taking place before she died or something?</br>  "It was like the ending of the movie we saw a long time ago."  <br> implying all the past three have been 10/10 </br>  Is the anime any good?<br>I read up to 35 the other day and I forgot the anime was airing.</br>  EP3&gt;EP2&gt;EP4=EP1<br>I still love it.</br>  <br>Its death will probably be the last episode or something.<br><br><br>This was the only good part of this episode...but it was so good.<br><br>Did anyone else think the ending was like painfully corny? The song was great but I feel no emotional connection towards 'whats her face' at all so it all felt kind of forced? Like the anime was super aware and cocky that it was creating an emotional scene but it really wasn't at all and just came off as embarrassing.<br><br>Like when a starving artist isn't aware that their art sucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow there.  <br>Yuki pls. The outing was after the Megu-nee reveal and now they're fucking up because they skipped things.</br>  <br> 35 </br>  So when do they eat the dog?  Are the majority of female anime fans fujoshits?  Are the majority of male anime fans lolicons?  <br>That'd make men who read doujins degenerates as well.<br><br>Are you just searching for boogeymen or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone's a lolicon at heart.</br>  <br>Their bishonen basically act like girls anyway. There's not much of a difference.</br>  <br> That'd make men who read doujins degenerates as well. </br>  The life that conquers is the life that moves with a steady resolution and persistence toward a predetermined goal. Those who succeed are those who have thoroughly learned the immense importance of  /ai/ - Idle Activities  in life, and the tragic brevity of time.  JIN DID NOTHING WRONG  Jin ruined everyhting.

I thought this was /ai/ only</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, and some stuff like An and Otoha would get more episodes to be resolved, and they could add Cosmo's shenanigans.<br><br><br> did people in the world know this truth? <br>Of course anon, Jin did nothing wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he's visited here before.<br>That Hiro webm is something I made a while back, I'm 90% sure of it.</br></br>  <br>If you're talking about the writer of the place, yes, he has screencapped some posts of here and use stuff from here.</br>  <br> How to say it, we try hard to make future aniota(anime otaku) who can understand that kind of story. <br>I hope they succeed.</br></br>   Now he’s in PriPara s2 <br>No wonder the show is better now.</br>  <br>They could have had an entire prism king cup and given An a longer story.<br>I hate life.</br></br>  <br>Ito a cute.<br>CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Yeah, a new Prism King Cup would have been nice with Hiro saying he'll win, Itou encouraging Kouji to participate and BURNING showing his FREEDOM to the world.</br>      <br>Who is that boy?</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  RL was nice but I miss season 1 and 2 of PR most of all    <br>The original atsui.</br>  http://www.aikatsu.com/news/news333<wbr>.html<br>How is Madoka so popular? Woah.</br></wbr>  <br> Shion in dead last <br>FUCKING</br></br>   3 years ago   <br>Switch Kokone with Aoi and that's a great top 8, although I don't exactly agree with the order.</br>  <br>ded</br>  <br> Yurika-Sama only #5 <br>This is an injustice.<br><br>Anyone else surprised by how high Seira is? Guess they like her after all.  Seira doesn't deserve the hate </br></br></br></br>  So lewd.    <br>JUST</br>  <br> Hikari not in last <br>MABUSHII WINS AGAIN</br></br>  <br>You should  move on now. </br>  Absolutely disgusting.<br>I think it's actually gotten worse since the last time I checked.</br>  What did Tiara do to build her school and this? Co-found Apple?  <br>Isn't Naoto famous or something?</br>  I love Sophie!  New song was great.  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>More like semen angel.</br>  Done with the second season.<br><br>Pretty bad, too many episodes focusing on concerts instead of exciting Aikatsu like drinking tea and eating cookies. I guess the director didn't put in as much effort as he only did the first episode of this season compared to three episodes in the first season.<br><br>I still finished in a record time of a week, compared to two weeks for 50 episodes as my previous record.</br></br></br></br>    <br>- only girl out of the main group, that never performed on stage<br>- only girl out of the main group, that didn't got her episode in the second season<br>- only girl of the main group, that never got any collection cards, besides bonus accessory, stage costume that everybody got, and PowaPuri costume, which is group related<br>- unlike the girls who got shafted hard, but at least got remembered for being shop mascots, she never was one<br>- she was game guide and default rival like two years ago, so nobody remembers her for that anymore<br><br>Gee, I wonder why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shion, Yuu, and Hikari should join forces and form a ded idol unit.  <br> only girl out of the main group <br><br>Well, way to be wrong right at the start.<br>She is only a minor side character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Yuu put up some fight, ensuring that she won't ends out below Kii and almost topped Hinaki. But Starlight Queens Sakura and Otome along with Tristar Superidol Kaede ending out below DreAcas is downright insulting.</br>  <br>Banrise please go, and burn in hell.</br>  Aikatsu = Saved  <br>Michelle is minor side character, Michiru is minor side character, but Shion was given the position in the main cast, amongst the actual top idols of the academy.<br>After Mizuki left, top stars of the Starlight academy were ever-present Soleil, PowaPuri, and Tristar remnants. The show itself insisted on that.<br>And yet, Banrise decide to push Soleil everywhere, bail out Kaede and Yurika with duets, and give decent relevance even to Otome and Sakura, while actually managing to make all Shion's potential go waste. I will never forgive that!</br></br></br>  <br>Banrise created her, and Banrise can destroy her.</br>  <br>And I can and will hate them for that forever.</br>  <br>They didn't create my love for her</br>  Shion is quite beautiful.  <br>Manji should step it up, and draw more of her. It's been forever.</br>  <br>That Shion isn't half as good as his Nagisas.</br>    Wow, this episode's song was fucking fantastic. It pays not to listen to them on youtube before so I can get the fresh experience in the anime. The episode itself was cute too, and gave some much needed focus to Sumire.  <br>I like Tenketsu, but he doesn't put even half the effort into his drawings as Manji.<br>Also, they are two different people.</br></br>  <br>Stop that.</br>  <br>they seem to have put the list up backwards by mistake</br>    Michiru-sama is too reserved.      <br>Karin pls</br>  <br>Mabushii never dies.</br>  Someone mentioned JoJo references in PriPara's previews.<br><br>Here's one I noticed earlier:<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/bN78-d6V8Ek?t=21m5<wbr>6s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It aired the same day as DIOの世界 その1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a bunch of anons noticed that here and in Japan.</br>  Shion is still number one in my heart.  <br>now shes officially the worst aikatsu and not just the most forgettable</br>  <br> Japanese girls have taste <br>Never.</br></br>  <br>deader than dreaca</br>  <br>If you want to die, just give me your address.  I have SWAT team on dispatch. </br>  <br>ALIVE AND WELL</br>  <br> SWAT leader watch shows for little girls <br>Why this doesn't surprise me?</br></br>  they ruined Shion in her first appearance and there was no going back  She's gonna lose, isn't she?  <br> best girl <br>Obviously</br></br>   shit girl <br> shit show <br>who cares</br></br>  <br><br> Winning is getting together with that massive "savior" autistic faggot. <br><br>If she loses, she wins.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> shit girl <br><br>Yeah, nah, you're a fag. She's not great or anything, but she's far away from shit.<br><br>Also, is it just me or Akira looks like a Moai?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  commie needs to stop being lazy and get this shit caught up. an option besides the totally fucked up looking HS means I sure as fuck don't want to touch HS again.  <br>She isn't green so there might be chance.</br>  <br><br> polygamy end confirmed <br><br>zessica forever BTFO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody cares about that shitty show.</br>  <br>Of course not. You expect stutter girl to win? They never do.</br>  <br> not green <br>no.</br></br>  <br>Hang in there Anon, I'll keep you company.</br>  <br> main girl <br> losing <br>That's not how it works.</br></br></br>  <br><br> main girl <br> not clumsy tits <br><br>I'm warning you, man. Don't do this to yourself. Expect nothing from Logos and you still won't be safe. None of us are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They already showed a promo pic showing all the main Aquarion pairings with THE SAVIOR and Maia as the Logos pair.<br>It's gonna happen.</br></br>  i just realized this is done by the M3 team minus okada who's busy working on gundam<br><br>no wonder why it's so bad</br></br>  Turns out MC is only in love with saving the world  Why? What's wrong with threesome?<br><br><br> i just realized this is done by the M3 team <br>But it isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one will lose. Based Savior Man will save them all with his penis.</br>  <br>are you saying that the director of aria, sailor mon Princess Tutu etc,Junichi sato was the responsable for M3 blunder and he's doing aquarion?.<br><br>I can't wait for okada to kill gendum and people put the blame on the director again</br></br></br>  <br>Maia and MC are posing as couple with Apollo and Sylvia and Mikono and Amata. It's over. She's also listed as main heroine.</br>  <br>No. She's being promoted with chuuni-kun as the main couple. <br><br>Anyone cheering for NotMikono is up for a disappointment.</br></br></br>  i'm more interested in who will win the karanlion  <br> I can't wait for okada to kill gendum and people put the blame on the director again <br>FYI nobody blames Kawamori alone for the evol fiasco, they blame Okada too.</br></br>  <br> winning that half-hamster half-human monstrosity <br>Pyrrhic victory.</br></br>  <br>rude. she's the cutest</br>  <br>hamsters are cute.<br>karan isn't.</br></br>  <br>no she's the best girl and most skilled mecha pilot of her age</br>  <br> hamsters </br>  If you have to ask then the answer is yes  who lose in a threesome?  <br>People actually like this show? why do they keep making sequels? there is just no words to describe the absolute shit this anime is.</br>  <br>Aquarion: the mediocre show that somehow ended up turning into a franchise even though nobody asked more of it.</br>  <br> why do they keep making sequels? <br>Pachinko.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather watch aquarion than the never ending light novel adaptations</br>      <br>Tsutomu, of course. Just look at their interactions in the past episode.</br>  <br>they also keep shoving it to SRW games even though all aquarion are shit-tier units</br>  <br><br>For a moment I thought she was giving the middle finger.</br></br>  <br>Sculpt looks good, but I'm sure Kotobukiya will find a way to fuck this up.</br>  <br>So since it's been improving by the episode from the shitty start, does that mean today's will actually be fun as fuck?</br>  What if Maia isn't Zessica's reincarnation?<br>What then?</br>  <br>What if no one is the reincarnation of anyone from the previous shows?<br>What then?</br></br>  <br>Who the hell was in charge of the designs?</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Karan best.<br><br><br>Stick to AZ<br><br><br>Kawamori isn't in charge so there might be chance.<br><br><br> main girl <br> clumsy tits <br><br><br>Implying one hand won't be enough.<br><br><br> Comiket. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well it does remind me of shin megami tensei series quiet a lot.<br>not a fan of it, tough</br></br>  <br> not wanting that autist to be the savior, the savior of your heart </br>    <br>Maia needs to step up her game in the next episodes because kokone and karan are so far ahead of her in the best girl ranking</br>  <br>Aquarion series have good track record for the main girl to win the aquabowl, like it or not, notzessica is destined to win the aquabowl no matter what the other loser girl do.</br>  <br><br>I like this particular retard</br></br>    Bumping the thread, we need one for the new episode.  New episode when?  <br>11 minutes.</br>  <br>YAMAIDARLINDARLIN</br>   Skintight body suit wearing Loli mecha pilots.   Should I pick this up? I dropped aqua lion about 16 episodes in but I still liked it.  <br>If you liked it, why did you drop it?<br>So far this is similar but hasn't hit the high points EVOL did.</br></br>  starting<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>    Oh, Maia.          UMI DAAAA  <br>Isobe?</br>    FAT    <br> but hasn't hit the high points EVOL did <br>Like best girl losing to a doormat?</br></br>        Who has the best panties in anime?  <br>That's a ballsack.</br>  <br>Don't discriminate anon</br>    <br>フィア</br>  <br>Obligatory.</br>  Panchirain  <br>This.

Asuha  <br>Saeko of course.</br>  <br> They all looked so soft and comfortable <br>Yeah, it was pretty nice.</br></br>      mai waifu        Mio Akiyama<br><br>They are so good, that you don't get to see them.</br></br>    Any good quality gifs?  <br>Nopan is best pantsu.</br>  <br>I was going to say Erica, but then I remembered that they aren't panties so it isn't embarrassing</br>  <br><br>I concur.

How is it less embarrassing?</br>  <br>For the same reason that swimsuits are less embarrassing anon.</br>    <br>How are swimsuits less embarrassing?</br>  <br>I assume because you aren't peaking under something to see them such as looking up a skirt.</br>    <br>was going to post this.</br>  <br>No, it's because they're made of thicker material and  usually  cover more.</br>  <br>this man is a role model</br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>Nice<br>Cute Pantsu&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sexy&gt;nopan&gt;generic</br></br>  Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta has the best panty flashes of all time  <br> plain whites <br>Weak</br></br>  <br>Take your pic</br>  <br> polka dots <br> or animal print <br>I can't choose</br></br></br>  <br>Oh and boyshorts/spats are high level too.</br>  <br>I am watching this series right now, and i'm honestly impressed with the amount of panty shots in it.

Why the fuck should people wait 3 hours for raws when they don't have to?</br></br></br>  <br> Yugi </br>  I have to admit that I was very briefly an Amourshipper, or at the very least a Serenafag, and even to this day I don't hate Serena (I actually like her). I'm just not happy with the way things at /padt/ have gone. In the past, it was full of discussion of various topics. Sure it had lots of Amourshipping, but other topics got their time in the spotlight as well. But nowadays it's just a de-factor Amourshipping thread. It's not wrong to discuss Amour, but when it becomes the main source of discussion most of the time, along with criticizing anyone who even dares to at the very least imply Serena will leave at the end of XY or not believing that Ash and Serena will become a couple, something just doesn't feel right. Hate me all you want, whether it be though my use of a trip, my opinions, or that fetish, but it can't be denied that you guys take Amour way too seriously and are guilty of the same problems as Pokeshippers. You guys keep saying that you are "just going along for the ride" and aren't taking things seriously, but that doesn't seem to be the case if you discuss Amour *and little else* day in and day out. It's not wrong to be a shipper, but please, can't you guys stop making /padt/ a shipping thread? You guys aren't "not being serious" if you hate anyone who isn't a shipper.<br><br><br>This.</br></br></br>  JUST ENJOY THE RIDE  <br>Tl;dr</br>  <br><br>Somebody needs to chill.</br></br>  <br>Mami you seemed to have forgotten, you're a shit and no one cares about your opinons</br>  <br>Don't be a fucking whiner you fucking namefag.

I still remember the movie threads and I remember getting pissed that people were caring more about the (minimal) Amour interactions rather than the more important and more relevant stuff such as plot summaries or box-office performance. Let them discuss Amour all they want, they just need to at least chill about Amour and treat people with other opinions about Serena better. </br>  <br> your crush will never eat and enjoy your homemade dogfood </br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>It's pretty good.<br><br> That thread has exploded with OC lately. Multiple drawfags, and they even scanlated the movie adaptation manga </br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to the part about /vp/ being autistic, not this thread.</br>  <br>Some nigger just has to make a Pokemon thread in /a/ even though he's been told not to. Make of that as you will.</br>  <br><br>Um, no. Shut the hell up tripfag. This is the first time in TWENTY YEARS that there is even a REMOTE POSSIBILITY that Ash might hook up with a girl. We'll discuss it all we want.</br></br>  <br>Based Mami dropping elite truth bombs</br>  <br> box-office performance <br> important <br><br>go talk about how yakaii is killing pokemon somewhere else fag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of it is Mami shitting things up, it's not so bad otherwise</br>  <br>Like a flip you are mami, always cannot be satisfied. That's the reason why your country is shit, you vote guys only to put the blame game on</br>  <br>You're taking funposting too seriously, Mimi.</br>  <br>Serena is cute!</br>  <br>Discuss what you want to discuss. If no one else wants to, then deal with it. That's the state of the fanbase.</br>  <br>I was in the movie threads and no, that's not what was happening. People discussed the movie itself first. When that was done they began talking about that scene. Don't twist facts. People like you are the ultimate shitposter since you only complain and don't try to discuss anything else. Which people will do if you just bring up a topic. Besides, we had the manga adaptation for long and that was discussed a lot. So fuck off with your skewed shit.</br>  I'm just waiting for KoG to get some more trips.<br><br>I would try for trips myself, but I know I'd miss.</br></br>  <br> your crush will never stare at you passionately </br>  <br>qt</br>  <br>HELL</br>  <br><br>You should have more confidence in yourself!</br></br>    <br>And this is why /padt/ is getting hated even by the other threads on /vp/.</br>  <br>why is she such a qt?</br>  So is it safe to say that Serena is a slut?  <br>You mean the /v/-infested threads that hate all of /a/ too?</br>   you will never have your way with this whore <br><br>why live?</br></br>  <br> taking up one post from a spamming fag <br><br>shit example Mami. Besides, the rest of /vp/ is just showderp.</br></br></br>  <br> voter turnout: 38 </br>  <br><br>A wild Doublade appeared!<br><br>Go, Seaking!</br></br></br></br>  <br> your crush will never compliment on your looks </br>  <br>They probably hate it more because Masuda's on board instead of making a new game.</br>  <br>of course</br>  <br>/vp/ is a complete shithole these days.</br>  <br>At least crop porn from GOOD artists.</br>  <br>fuck you ash ketchum</br>  <br>Well, you're right.<br>It's why I barely go on anymore except for livestream threads.</br></br>  <br> last OP was shit edition <br><br>I laughed</br></br></br>  <br>/v/ side of /vp/ is angry because Masuda is busy shipping ash serena instead of focusing on a new game</br>  <br>i now know what it feels like to agree with a tripfag for the first time</br>  <br>What happens when there's no new game. You know, /v/ and what not.</br>  Why did it take so long for the writers to give us Pokemon anime watchers such a good sex object like Serena?    <br><br>Serena knows how get Ash interest</br></br>  <br>ITS TIME</br>    I'm just waiting for KoG to get 3333 so I can go to bed already. :^)  <br> /vp/ is /s4s/ </br>  <br>like this?</br>    <br><br><br>I love how the deviantart links are just plastered on the page itself.</br></br></br>  Guys, why is this "serena" so fucking cute and why is she interested with ash  <br>I so badly want to put my cock into her. Serena is so fucking hot.</br>  <br>http://kisarasmoon.deviantart.com/j<wbr>ournal/Misty-is-Ash-s-only-girl-Sor<wbr>ry-Serena-438232217</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>When she was a child, Serena visited Kanto and went to Oak's Summer Camp. There, she met Ash, who helped her after she got injured. To be precise, Serena got bruised and Ash covered the wounds with a napkin (IIRC). Many years later, Serena continued to have that napkin and waited for the day she would again meet that young boy.</br>  <br> short hair <br>its shit.</br></br>    <br>Fuck off you idiotic tripfag.</br>  <br><br>Just go to bed already.</br></br>  <br>Falling on deaf ears.<br>Who would have thought all the people who used to come into these threads and talk about how they haven't watched pokemon in 10 years would be that much more preferable to the way they are now?<br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still not watching XY <br>Step the fuck up anon</br></br></br>  <br>I feel your pain anon. She is so fucking hot. I would love to pound her ass every night.</br>  <br><br><br>Bed time.</br></br></br>  <br>Is anyone keeping up with this?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Christ.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of this</br>  Based doujin  <br>ash that's fucking lava what the fuck are you doing</br>  <br>Seems contradictory seeing how said person has to alter Misty to be more and more like Serena after Ash keeps doing these things with Serena.</br>  We talk about best bonnie  <br>Well shit, looks like it's time to start masturbating to pokemon again. It's been at least a decade.</br>  <br> Someone actually typed all of that out </br>  <br> why </br>  can somebody tell me if serena is flat-chested?<br><br>it's very important to know...</br></br>   Walk into room <br> See this <br>what do?</br></br>  <br> May I recommend Millefeui? </br>  <br><br> Jessica is better. </br></br>  <br>Why shit on him when he's helpful?<br><br>Otherwise, sure, but when he actually contributes?</br></br></br>      <br> Mami comfirmed Jessicafag <br>You never really left /padt/ did you?</br></br>  Dumping our main subbing sponsor<br><br>http://pocketmonsters.edwardk.info/<wbr>#PocketMonstersXYSubbed<br><br>get all fresh episodes here for free!</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Ash is indestructable.

Apparently, French dub went all out by having Ash say the ribbon matched eyes and it was beautiful like them or something like that. </br>  <br>There are at least three Jessicafags there including me.<br><br>https://archive.moe/vp/post/2379419<wbr>1/<br>https://archive.moe/vp/post/2379422<wbr>3/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>He is literally the only person. <br>At least since lucariopk disappeared off the face of the Earth.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Here you go.

That shit was cancer.</br>  Why are they so perfect for each other  <br>The french probably did that because Serena is French.<br><br>Which is funny, because there is no france in pokemon</br></br></br>  what a qt  <br>Original has Ash compliment Serena's look, English dub has Ash indirectly calling Serena cute, and French dub pulled that shit.</br>  <br>bonnie wont be sleeping tonight due to loud moaning wet dream by serena</br>  <br>Break the handcuffs and escort her to the toilet.</br>      <br>Try not forgot that they're both ten. Unless the series goes in a very different direction, they won't be staying together for long.</br>  Did the circlejerk really have to come to /a/  <br> Try not forgot that they're both ten </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Seems like that's what they're going for.</br>  <br>how the fuck is that even Amour</br>  <br>we know that they are ten, anon<br><br><br>yes its not</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's my issue with Amour as of late, people jump on every single interaction and scream 'AMOUR! AMOUR!'<br><br>Hell I like it and how Pokemon is finally having the guts to add romance elements. However some people take it to autistic levels and get very hostile about it</br></br></br>  <br>This anime needs to end Ash's suffering. It would be good though if he wins this girl too.</br>  <br> not liking cute </br>  <br> not being able to read </br>  <br> Hell I like it and how Pokemon is finally having the guts to add romance elements. However some people take it to autistic levels and get very hostile about it <br>This. Though to be fair, all Pokemon ships since the dawn of time (i.e. Pokeshipping and Rocketshipping) are guilty of the same thing. It's just that Amour has more moments and more blatant moments than other ships.</br></br>  <br>Haven't watch pokemon for years now, what is this.<br><br>How about the children</br></br></br>  When you gents say "Amour", what are you referring to?  <br>what they call ash serena ship</br>  <br> what is this <br>Shipping</br></br>  <br>Literally shipping on a ship<br> inb4 someone posts that 4 mb amour collection </br></br>  <br>What about the children?</br>  <br><br>Because it's pointless to trip in a thread like this, and only serves to seek attention. Fuck off idiot.</br></br>  <br>I don't buy it. It's probably the name of a new series or something.</br>  <br><br><br>What power does pokemon animators have to draw cute shit like this</br></br></br>  <br> Ash's free hand going right for Serena's ass. <br><br>Smooth.</br></br></br>  <br>try searching amourshipping</br>  <br> new Pokemon anime genera on /vp/ uses nurse Serena too <br>kek</br></br>  <br>how about shipping on a kitchen?</br>  <br>Okay, I believe you.</br>  <br>Female animators.</br>  ayy check those abs  New episode just got announced<br><br> XY087: Bonnie Will Take Care of You!
