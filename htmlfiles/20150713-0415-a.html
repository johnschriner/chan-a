[ Pretty nice.  <br>I have the feeling this show is gonna suck something major. I don't know the source or whatever but I get this feeling in the pit of my stomache.</br>  Not enough imouto. I'd drop, but imouto.  <br><br>This is X-Men: the anime. No way it could turn out bad.</br></br>  <br><br>There's plenty of ways. For example, it could be X-Men the anime.</br></br>  Will it be the meme anime to dethrone Steins;Gate, though?  <br>Pretty nice what?</br>  <br><br>While her circumstance makes me sympathize with her, her rationale for doing what she does is terrible.<br><br> guy's parents are sick <br> is born with a supernatural power <br> uses it to make money <br> out of desperation, probably due to the fact that a part-time job might not be sufficient to quickly cover the escalating costs of care <br><br>Nah, fuck that and fuck your parents; do it the legal way and who cares what happens to your parents in the mean time. They might die due to a lack of treatment from no money, but at least no laws were broken.<br><br>She's a pretty good, flawed character; but I can't like her. Her sense of justice seems very hypocritical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst main girl in a while</br>  <br>Seeenpaai</br>  <br>To be fair, after the shit that happened with her mom, parents are probably the last thing that she thinks or cares about.</br>  <br><br>While true, that would imply that she's actually behaving vindictively against someone else while claiming a front of being a good person.<br><br>That's vile.</br></br></br></br>   MC became generic key good guy <br>DROPPED</br>  <br>I don't think she is actively trying to come off as a good person. In fact, if she is, she's doing a god awful job at it. I think she just really doesn't want people to end up like her brother, and will do anything to prevent it from happening.</br>  gif/weebm of imouto chewing please.  They put some effort into the OP animation, pretty good.<br><br>Always nice to watch original animu that people don't already know the story to.</br></br>  <br><br>Schneizel just made an illegal move in chess, so it doesn't make sense that he would say checkmate, he might possibly say check but the use of the term here is wrong. The only way this could be a legal move is if this were blitz chess, also known as "Fast Chess". However, in this scene, it is never declared the are playing "Fast Chess", and neither of the players are using clocks to time their turns in the game. (Source: /a/)</br></br>  The first episode was good but the second episode gave up the plot and twists too fast. Not really feeling it anymore.  <br>I like being able to make predictions with others without sourcefags coming in and spoiling it for us.<br><br><br>  However, in this scene, it is never declared they are playing "Fast Chess" <br><br>Did you watch the scene? Sanic was the one who set up the checkmate; he definitely went fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm liking the voice acting. Sakura was it? She's selling it.  <br>Please kill yourself.</br>  <br>Why is that newfag?</br>  <br>All I can hear is Naka-chan.</br>  <br>That scene flew over your head. She wasn't telling him to stop because what he was doing was bad, she was telling him to stop because he was putting himself in danger.</br>  Wonder if that guy's power is controllable to what layer of clothing it shows or if it only goes down one layer.<br><br>Guy could have made more money blackmailing or starting sexy situations.</br></br>  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <br>I'm wondering how this is going to go.<br>At some point will shit get real, people take over school, start kidnapping people or something?<br>Nao gets kidnapped or otherwise ends up in danger, MC saves her with others help?<br>Or is it just going to be stupid relationship drama, making it another SoL with superpowers just tacked on the side?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's going to be like the second X-men movie where the government raids the school and tries to eliminate all power users from the world.</br></br>    <br>this is awful, wanna bet who gets Key AIDS and dies a tragic full episode drawn out death?<br><br>yep you're looking at her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br> Implying someone died in Little Busters </br>  <br>If anyone's going to get Key AIDS it's going to be the sister. No question about it. Though I'm not really seeing Key AIDS in this one. Will some, if not all of the characters end up getting caught by the evil scientists at some point? Absolutely. Key Magic will save the day though. probably through the comet or the imouto's powers which she'll conveniently obtain.</br>  <br>i would add BBQ sauce onto her omelette rice</br>    <br>REMOVE<br>E<br>M<br>O<br>V<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I always laugh at these dumb faces.  <br>Every single KEY series.</br>  I don't get it, though. Were they THAT poor that the mother just had to give her kids to a fake school?<br><br>How was she ok with scientists mind-raping her kids?</br></br>  <br>I haven't watched the episode yet but fuck them if this is true.<br>Why do japs want this shit? He was better before.</br></br>  <br>Don't care, got dosh.</br>  <br>literally the only reason to watch this show</br>  <br>If my son was a "musician", I'd sell him to a fake school.</br>  This episode confirmed Nao's brother won't be Magneto. That leaves dream guy to take the role.  <br>So, what is her power?</br>  <br>  Charlotte trusting only one person <br><br>That sets up possible big ass "i trusted you" drama in the future if it turns out the person was just using her all along.</br></br></br>  <br>There is always the option to just abandon the parents, because it is their fault they got sick. And parents shouldn't burden their kids and destroy their future.</br>  <br>Puffy vulva.</br>  <br>I hope that doesn't happen because it'd be really cliche.<br><br>Another possibility could be that the person she trusts ended up dying.</br></br></br>  <br>You have a point, her mom outright sold her and her brother for money, while leaving them to their senses, then again she's still a hypocrite, not doing anything to cure her brother now, not doing anything against the scientist with fucking superpowers, etc. Her cutesy act, everything is shit, plus she stops based Yu-sama from being himself, which is a major offender. Bowphoto-kun was based to actually shoot.<br><br><br>Monogatari is the only meme anime in existance, literally. Live with it or deny it forever.</br></br></br></br>  A true friend  <br>I'm gonna go with "the person she trusts is not a nice guy." Somebody like Magneto can be trusted, but he's not a good guy.</br>  <br>Oh boy her bitch act is so annoying! Is this a sign she's an actual good (voice) actress? Arghhhhhhh.</br>  <br>That scene cracked me up so hard</br>  <br>Dream manipulation or dream projection of sorts, something related to that and stars. Probably either super key/useful or outright OP but hard to actually use.</br>  <br>I'm sure he'll suffer.</br>  <br>I got some serious angel beats vibes from that because of how utterly out of place that scene was.<br><br>Normal cafeteria scene one minute.<br>The sight of an invisible bomb going off the next.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanicporter is the shit. I want more him and Yu's scene, no Naobitch needed.</br>  <br>Maeda pretty much recycles his work regardless.</br>  <br> Not wanting more of best girl <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br> ! <br> Arghhhhhhh <br>Stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Plot went to complete shit episode 2. "My friends were fake friends set up by scientists", top tier writing.</br>  <br> out of place <br><br>Its like you magically skipped the part where he uses his power to buy the food and crashes in those tables afterwards. Fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br> serious angel beats vibes <br>Remember that one guy with blue hair and glasses? Same seiyuu.</br></br>  <br> Select the post, fill out the captcha and move on because that's just summer posting in effect. </br>  <br>And of course the evil scientists who do evil experiments on the poor people with superpowers and drive them crazy (how? fuck you that's how it works).</br>  <br>My porn comics are even better written.</br>  <br>Neo-Kitamura</br>  <br> probably either super key/useful <br> super key <br> key <br><br>was that a pun?</br></br></br></br></br>  Wow, I didn't expect to see so much hate, I'm actually enjoying this show quite a good bit.  <br>Won't be surprised when he dies.</br>  <br>Easy to be best girl when you're the only girl.</br>  <br>Wow, aren't you a special snowflake who's afraid of his favorite show getting criticized by others.</br>  <br>Bet/a/s cant handle heroines with strong personality instead of kyoanus moeblobs. Fortunately they are minority.</br>  <br><br><br>Everytime i hear her voice i remember my delicious delicious Hiroha</br></br></br>  <br>It's prognostic hate.</br>  <br>Not like you can handle the heat either, hipster.</br>  <br>Considering she literally begged them, they probably threatened her if she didn't take the deal as well.</br>  <br>Take a dump and re-evaluate your opinion.</br>  <br>It's Key. We're on /a/. Of course it is going to get hate. That being said, I am enjoying it very much as well. I'm personally a huge fan of Maeda, but I can admit that there are flaws in his works, and have no problem criticizing even some of my favorite anime.</br>  <br>Jun maeda did clannad too, anon.<br>Same reason i'm going to drop this, i didn't realize he wrote this anime until this episode.</br></br>  <br> Nah, fuck that and fuck your parents; do it the legal way and who cares what happens to your parents in the mean time. <br>I think you missed the point this episode, which was pretty much about "MY ONIICHAN IS  BRAIN DEAD!"<br><br>She's not telling the guy to stop using his powers that way because it's illegal or immoral, but simply because using his powers will put him in danger.<br>After what happened to her brother she wants to prevent other people from suffering the same fate.<br><br>That's it. There are no morals or laws involved. She simply wants to prevent the same tragedy from occurring again.<br><br>Whether she's got the right to tell other people what to do or not is another matter - for one, she didn't give the guy any alternative to help his parents, and she-s supposed to come from a poor family, so you would expect her to be able to feel some empathy for the guy - but she certainly isn't doing it out of morality or the desire to enforce the law.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you take responsibility, anon?<br>I know I would</br></br>    <br>I don't know who you are.<br>But i will find you.<br>And i will kiss you.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes...YES</br>  <br>If you don't like Maeda's writing, yes it's going to suck.</br>  <br>Archer-kun such a bro</br>  Why did he leave on the lingerie? Another imperfection of powers?  <br>Excellent work</br>  <br>I bet he can only see through one layer of clothes at a time.</br>  Is this  menstrual blood ?  <br>Stop streaming you fucking nigger</br>  <br> not doing anything to cure her brother now <br>It's a psychological trauma. That kind of thing can only be fixed with years of therapy. She might have become a doctor to cure him, but because of her mom that career bath is lost.<br> not doing anything against the scientist with fucking superpowers <br>Relatively useless superpowers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tomato ketchup </br>  <br>Why in English? Why waste time even writing that at all?</br>  <br>Probably out of spite.</br>  <br><br>But it's like, Maeda has actually done good things.<br><br>Air<br>Clannad<br>Kanon<br>Little Busters<br><br>Those were all good.<br><br>Starting with Angel Beats he's started to suck. I don't think he was involved with Rewrite (I think that was Key's new guy), but Jun has really just gone downhill.<br><br>The only common trend is that all of the stories that are bad are not in the normal world with minor supernatural elements, but are entirely dominated by the supernatural (or the setting itself IS supernatural).<br><br>It's taking him out of what he's good at. His settings are terrible and this one is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm starting to get the feeling that MC is going to be the tsundere.  <br>Time out.</br>  <br>AB's prequel LN/manga is nice, anime is eh and then Maeda takes a dump with the VN.</br>  <br>Why must every anime stick to exactly the same character archetype?</br>  <br><br>Well, there's other stupid things too.<br><br>1) Wouldn't there be a camera or a monitoring device in her room? Wouldn't leaving the message be obvious?<br><br>2) How can she sneak out? It doesn't state whether her power had or had not manifested by that point. And they were checking her daily. Did she use her power or not? If she didn't how plausible is it that a little girl could sneak out from scientists who went as far as to hire fake friends? Where exactly does one find 9 middle school girls for hire to pretend to be friends for months?<br><br>3) If she did use her power to sneak out, then the scientists would want her back because they would realize it. Wouldn't they be waiting at the hospital for her to visit him and just seize her then. If it's because of "the one person she trusts" they could just deny involvement. Why are they just letting her go?<br><br>4) Why did the scientists keep her brother alive anyways? They could just euthanize and dispose of him. They didn't exactly care about his well-being. And if you want to cover something up, well, dead man tell no tales. And then how did she even find her own brother? It makes no sense that some government organization would do that.<br><br>5) The worst point. There is obviously a very powerful organization that wants kids with powers. They control the police. But they haven't just taken all the students from that school? If we accept the "trusted person" to be powerful, how come they can only stop it in the school? What is to stop the scientists from abducting students? How come they seem to take it sitting down?<br><br>It's a trainwreck full of holes 2 episodes in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Seems like forced rimance so far <br> "i trusto only one person"  <br> "i dont want anyone to end up like my brother" <br>=fucking annyoing cliche <br> gotta make her brother look as pathetic as bossible </br></br></br></br>  <br>I've read some people say she was deliberately allowed to leave on purpose, in order to  make use of her, by having someone pretend be nice to her, and thus have her gather power users and potential power users in a single place, so that they could experiment with them at ease. <br><br>That's one possibility.</br></br></br>  <br><br>See, that's the problem with people like you. You take Jun Maeda's writing way too seriously.<br><br>Everything Maeda writes has plot holes in it. ClannAIDS, time loops, you name it. If you want to enjoy Maeda's writing, just turn off your brain and enjoy the melodrama.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That would be a totally legitimate explanation that would explain all of my questions. I mean, it'd be cheesy (how would they know she would do that?) but, it makes sense. Thanks anon.</br></br>  The episodes was alright. The whole experimentation thing reminded me of MOON rather than his more recent stuff.<br><br>I'm still not on board about the supernatural setting, but the visual direction and the characters are enough to not drop it (yet).</br></br>  <br>The scientists and the group behind them still operate within legal means, Nao and her brother were not abducted by them and that was years ago. They are not going to raid the fucking school.</br>  The one thing that I can't stand is how she just calls them 'the scientists'.<br><br>It's just the way she goes on and on about "the scientists will get you. the scientists will get you. you have to watch out for the scientists." BITCH, WHAT SCIENTISTS?! Is everyone with a PhD in that country a mustache twirling villain? Do the police just not work anymore?</br></br>  <br>Continuing the fine tradition of Key bros.</br>  <br>They probably were staying there by their own free will. Their family was in big debt, so the brother couldn't have left even if he disliked the experimentation.</br>  <br>You're not a teleporter, dude. You have instantaneous acceleration.</br>  <br>Maybe her memories are faked. Talking like that is a sign of delusions.<br><br>What if these scientists don't exist and her brother was actually fucked up by Girl on the Water? The feather imagery that goes with her in the OP and the way he tore up the pillow makes me think there may be something there.</br></br></br>  Yo.<br><br>This is a nice room.</br></br>  <br>GET CHANCE AND LUCK</br>  <br>Yeah, it's a lot better than your room in the basement.</br>  <br>Yes but why is it so high? All that wasted Space.<br><br>Could have make 2 stories</br></br></br>  It's actually hilarious how deprived of creativity Maeda really is. Two episodes in, and he's already fallen back on the good-old forced drama bullshit.<br><br>This show is still worth watching for the girls, though. Imouto was #1, but at the pace this show is going, Nao will soon be best girl.</br></br>  You know what to do.  <br><br>Tall ceilings are pimp. I bet you live in a little shack.</br></br>  <br> not practically living in your cuckshed </br>  <br>At least it used to be magic or some shit. Now we got unethical scientists who are apparently not bound by the law.</br>  <br>Yes! Yes!</br>  <br> cuckshed <br>Can't imagine how would dat look like.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know why, but every time I see Nao's smug face, I get super turned on for some reason.<br><br>She's got that sarcastic, smug way of talking that makes me want to  pinch her cheeks really hard . Surely I can't be the only one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Surely I can't be the only one. <br><br>Nah, but for it's  wanting to fuck her in the butt .</br></br></br>    <br> That sexy best girl voice </br>  <br><br>I think she sounds a bit deeper in Charlotte. It's closer to her voice in Psycho Pass.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127965452 <br>What's "udge"?</br>  <br>Agreed. During the 1st episode she just came off as an asshole but that scene made my dick diamonds.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127965452 <br> ssuffering <br> udge </br></br>  <br>You started using your dick to think.</br>  <br>What if the scientists are actually magic?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127965452 <br>What a loser. Go on and delete that. I hope you remember this on your deathbed.</br>  <br> started </br>  wait this shit is by KEY? please tell me the main girl gets magic aids or i drop it  <br>Yeah I'd like to pinch her cheeks down there too.</br>  <br>I wanted to give your dick the benefit of doubt, but I alas.</br>  <br>Seeeeeenpaaaaaaaai</br>  <br>I didn't know Iroha was Ayane Sakura until she said "Osoi!"</br>  <br> Monogatari is the only meme anime in existance </br>  <br>Fuck this bitch. I was hoping she would have much less screentime in this episode. I was even happy that they didn't invite her for lunch but after that it went all to shit. I hope she dies soon.</br>  Are they going to introduce orange(s) next episode?  <br>calm that edge anon</br>    <br>I want her to spite me.</br>  <br>I want to kill her. It should have been her that got experimented and not her brother. Fucking bitch.</br>  <br>   Tomato ketchup <br> Not pizza sauce </br></br>    <br>I want to cum inside her, whilst she's invisible.</br>  <br>Who's JEEEEAAAAAN?</br>  <br>Is this a clockwork orange?</br>  <br>That was two seasons ago.</br>  Why the fuck is a key show 1 cour?  <br>Is this darker than black</br>  <br> muh filler <br> muh padding <br><br>You will have to deal with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>13 episodes is the optimal length for anime</br>  <br>That was thirty-two seasons ago.</br>   no ass <br>dropped</br>  <br>Oh, I realized I meant Black Bullet. That was the one with the loli torturing right?<br>But I'm pretty sure that was more than 2 seasons ago.<br><br>What could it be?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To reduce costs and make shitty anime, that is.</br>  <br>And no boobs either, she was young there. Time gave her the needed fat in those right places</br>  <br>The same anime as this semen demon, except it was the shitty third season.</br>   Didn't get to see her lingerie photo. <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>that is what Otonashi would look like if he didn't stop being emo.</br>  <br>mucisians can earn good money if they sell you know.<br><br>she is like Kyrie, enjoying a good life and a new love nowadays.<br> ahaha.wav </br></br></br></br>  <br> strong personality <br>come on now.<br>being a bitch =! strong personality.<br>you don't need to be a shit person to be influential.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hey now, S3 wasn't shitty just because it wasn't as good as 1 or 2. It was a solid 7.</br></br>  <br> The worst point. There is obviously a very powerful organization that wants kids with powers.

Ain't no police gonna track me down.</br>  <br>Yes, but he wrote the most relevant parts in those.</br>  <br><br>Jun Maeda helped out on the scenario for Kanon, but he wasn't the main writer. Jun Maeda usually only writes the main heroine's arc (which also happens to always be the best arc). He had no involvement in Rewrite outside of writing the lyrics for the opening song. <br><br>I can agree to a certain extend that I miss the Jun Maeda stories that had more down-to-earth stories and realistic slice of life scenarios like Clannad and Air. To say he's gone downhill seems silly to me, since is hasn't been long enough for a pattern to emerge. Angel Beats was one show, and while I didn't like it as much as the older shows, I still thought the scenario was very well written, even if the setting wasn't as appealing (this is ignoring all the issues with the pacing and character development). I feel the setting isn't as important as you say it is. Little Busters for example is somewhere in the middle of the two settings, since it's immersed in supernatural, but we aren't aware of it until near the end of the story. I think Jun Maeda can do more supernatural focused stories well, he just didn't execute it properly with angel beats.<br><br>Charlotte is two episodes in so I'd give it more of a chance before judging it, and there's still nothing saying that Jun Maeda won't make write another story that isn't dominated by supernatural elements. Maybe we'll finally get that Fall themed visual novel, since they seemed to stop with the season theme before doing fall.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Definitely, there is no denying he wrote the best parts of Clannad and LB!<br>But VN production is different, it's more intimate and ideas tend to bounce off quite easily and even a character designer can inject his ideas into the mix. It's like how when the main Nitro+ artist left for Propeller, they made action eroge like Nitro+ games even if he didn't touch the scenario.<br>Also trying to experiment with new things might have some effect as well.<br><br>Charlotte should be fine, I think he's used to anime production unlike last time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But VN production is different, it's more intimate and ideas tend to bounce off quite easily and even a character designer can inject his ideas into the mix.

In the manga she looked pretty built. Those arms.</br>  <br> tfw swedens military gender equality policy forces navy to have 50% women on-board </br>  <br>If the show is only about these military guys and girls, not including a goth-loli demi-goddess, a sorceress, and an elf, I think it would be much better.<br>I just want to see modern military wrecking fantasy army, I don't really care about those fantasy girls.<br> That's why I drop this anime </br></br></br>  <br>She's gonna wear human clothes? Sweet.<br>I always loved it in Stargate when aliens wore SGC/Atlantis uniforms and shit (like Teal'c or Teyla).<br><br> And I liked Jack using Jaffa staff weapons, I hope we'll get something similar here too. </br></br></br></br>  <br> women on a ship </br>  <br>They made her generic cute. Even if you go for the "women in infantry" thing it makes her look actually out of place in the anime. She actually looked like an actual soldier in the manga.</br>  <br>Read the Manga, it's probably more up your alley. The anime tried to make the characters cuter and focus more on the girls so they'd sell more figs and BDs</br>  <br> I don't really care about those fantasy girls. <br>Me neither, anon. But this ride looks promising and I'm willing to give it a chance. I just hope for at least some character development, because they really look like a cool bunch.</br></br>  <br>Are the military dudes in the manga relevant?<br>I doubt it because of what this anon said</br></br>  <br> FTL <br>Please no time travel</br></br>  <br>Fairly relevant throughout, although no one really gets any character development.</br>  manga phases out the squaddies completely and MC continues the recon with only moeblobs  <br>They're not main characters, but the Manga in general focuses more on the military aspects that the anime tries to downplay (probably to not send the message "guns are cool" to Japanese kids or whatever)</br>  <br>She looked like a soldier in the light novel art too. I don't know if she was ever on any of the covers for a novel art comparison.</br>  <br>Considering the original design of the prince I can hardly take the novel design seriously.</br>  <br><br>Any pic of them?</br></br>  <br>Tuka looks damn fine, at least.</br>  How could my gate adaptation look so bad when the monster girl adaptation is the best looking anime this season?    <br>I imagine they'll have to if they're trimming out the rape/gore/working girls.</br>  I really liked this part, shame we won't be seeing this old baller again for a while.      <br> That's why I drop this anime <br>It always amazes me what utterly pedantic reasons people will drop a show over.</br></br>      <br>It's gonna be epic the moment they actually need to do anything.</br>  <br>I liked it too, until they had him laugh like a loon, that trope of breaking down gets on my nerves</br>  <br>I see the Japanese really want their empire back. Too bad they'd be vaporized by Chinese nukes.</br>    let's be lucky we even got this to be animated at all. If we tried to adapt Gate in its purest form...    <br>Modern expansion just doesnt work, because the most valuable land is sat on by powerful countries with literal super weapons, best anyone can do is pick on the small nations under the guise of keeping order</br>    <br>They look better than the women on board the ship I'm on.</br>    <br>It would be too awesome for the squints to handle</br>    <br>Now dumping side stories.</br>    <br>That's all I have.</br>  Be honest with me, does this turn to moe moe haremshit? Or does it go towards more politics and world exploring?  <br> Not showing the back cover of Itami's fantasy harem not very happy about Pina hogging Itami all to herself </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> none of the soldierbros appearing on the covers <br>So it was a regular harem LN with 3 magical girls? There goes the character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese military propaganda, preparing the population for World War 3.</br>  <br>we want the moeshit crowd.</br>  <br>Well done, old chap.</br>  <br>warui</br>  i have a feeling the mc is a self insert.  <br>Might as well upload all of them.</br>  <br>what a drama queen.</br>  <br>That's it.</br>  <br>Holy shit, he becomes a Dragon Knight in the end?</br>  <br> Dark Elf with an RPG <br> Sorceress doing the driving <br><br>I'm not sure if that's a good idea</br></br></br></br>  <br>you are missing one from the gaidens.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  How far will the anime will go storywise?

Don't be making bold claims like that.</br>  <br>I hate it when they do it.

Don't worry about it that much, the webnovel is completely not related to the novel/manga/light novel story.</br>  Am i the only one who feels that a bishoujo harem for an old dude it's just wrong and probably wish fulfillment of the author?  <br>Sure. But that's not this show.</br>  <br><br>This thread is making me believe otherwise...</br></br>  <br>And you believe everything people tell you?</br>  <br>Except he does though, Itami might not reciprocate any of the girls' feelings but they all do like him.</br>  <br>I know that but not knowing bothers me<br><br>fuck<br><br>sum it up for me  pls? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its super dramatic after ch 20 or so I was kinda disappointed with the whole Elf's arc.</br>  <br>Two cours anon!</br>  Anyone laugh when the JSDF just blew the enemy army away?<br><br> Army decides to attack at night <br>I was just praying they'd get blown away and it was great...</br></br></br>  <br>Both sad and funny at the same time.</br>  <br><br>No, but official art does not help.</br></br>  <br><br>Like most MCs.</br></br>  <br> Soon. <br>Literally months away.</br></br>  <br> probably wish fulfillment of the author <br>It's almost like the author was an otaku in the SDF himself.</br></br>  <br>afaik no one has translated either the original novels or the light novels.</br>  <br>Besides that conspicuous dickslot they put into her armor design I'm actually fine with the changes.</br>   yfw it's revealed that Risa wants to get back with Itami because   he's hung like a horse.   How many episodes is this supposed to be again? It seems they're moving pretty quickly through the beginning bits.  <br>24</br>  <br> character development <br><br>For some characters, but not MC or the significant JSDF members (MC's division and a couple of others). Although I only read the manga, I imagine he ends up changing a bit  following the gates temporary closure . Kind of unfortunate really, I'd add alot to series if it was one of the focuses (Could swap out the brief politics stuff with it and everyone would be happy).<br>Plenty of relationship development though (for everyone but MC, who intentionally restrains himself like most Harem MC, he comes close to having sex with Rori, but author cockblocks him at the last moment).</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've gone through two manga chapters in the first two episodes, it's not an unusual pace.<br><br>If it keeps this pace, the first 24 eps will end right as they all return from their Japan trip, with ample material left over.</br></br></br>  Does the Japanese army actually have women on the front lines? It seems very unrealistic.  <br>I don't think so. But for a recon unit if might be a different thing.</br>  <br><br>And if they do, are they as hot as Kuribayashi.  And if they are, are they single? </br></br>  <br>Not really, in real life, they would have a military desk job rather than actually invade foreign territory.</br>  <br>cute though</br>  <br>Yeah, but even if it was a recon mission, its still an alien fantasy world.<br><br>If I were in charge, I consider attaching doctors or at least some pathology experts in case any units start getting sick because they caught a new disease that affects humans but only remained in the fantasy world until now.<br><br>Sending women to the front lines of an alien dimension just doesn't make sense at all.<br><br>If a women has to be sent, it should only be nurses or other medical professions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If it keeps this pace, the first 24 eps will end right as they all return from their Japan trip, with ample material left over. <br>That's exactly where I expect it to end. They showed Lelei talking to the Diet and Rory at the resort about to fuck shit up. It's a good place to wrap up a season.</br></br>  <br> Japanese army <br> anyone on the front lines <br>lol</br></br></br>   gate to another world appears <br> rush in and immediately start slaughtering innocents <br>I have no words for how stupid these people are. The scene in episode 2 where they're trying to figure out just what the fuck is going on really pissed me off.

Naturally military does best to keep them in ranks. In a modern defensive warfare, raw muscle is not as important as before anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just realized I typed aids instead of aides and now it's hilarious!!</br>  <br>The plural of humanitarian aid is humanitarian aid, so either way, you're wrong.</br>  <br>Ya, but getting it wrong and replacing it with aids are not the same thing and it still makes sense my sides.<br>Happy I realized the difference now.</br></br>  <br>Their banter over the next few pages was awesome.<br><br> that line about dulled senses </br></br></br>  <br>What a joke</br>  Do the civilizations from the gate ever learn that there are other countries besides Japan?<br><br>I want to see their reaction when they realize that Japan is one of the most pacifist non-threat countries in the world and there are beheamoths that dwarf it in firepower and numbers several times over.</br></br>  <br>Pina has an idea about it, just nothing solid yet.</br>  This episode sucked ass. This adaptation is terrible.  <br>I'll file your opinion under "Shit opinions". Wow, that's a big file.</br>  Will there be more of the bird-girl or her ilk ("sirens"?) than the one in the manga?  Series would be good if it went fullblown invasion lasting half a year with a good amount of losses of the japanese side due to foreign intervention and natural threats IE more dragons, wizards, and aids.<br><br>Or fullblown fantasy harem about Itami fucking the daughters of the leaders of the different racial kingdoms to become the first Japanese President, elected by the power of dick, of the new world.</br></br>  <br> This will never become a reality </br>  <br> Japanese President, elected by the power of dick, of the new world. <br>Through dick, unity?</br></br>  <br>Reminder that this anime does not have a big tits, JSDF womanlet CC fighter and thus is shit</br>  <br>It does, they've just butchered her character design to the point she's unrecognizable.</br>  <br>That is not a Kurebayashi, that is a SHIT</br>  <br>She's wearing camo so they're kind of hard to see, but they're still there.</br>  <br>webms of the massacre where?</br>  remember not to watch HS, terrible banding<br>wait for sushit</br>  <br>Did they get his rank right in the subs?</br>  <br>Hmm, with all this funi shit, I wonder if fan subbing will come back.</br>  Anyone got a gif/webm of Pinya being all flustered? Best part of episode 2.  Fantasy world fucked up.<br><br>Should have sent elephants instead of small sized dragons.<br><br>Even with modern artillery, a charging rampaging elephant is still pretty hard to kill.<br><br>Fantasy elephants would be 5 to 10 times larger than our elephants as well.<br><br>Also, Fantasy Hippos would be scary to face as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Even with modern artillery, a charging rampaging elephant is still pretty hard to kill. <br>I don't think you appreciate the munitions they were sending downrange buddy</br></br>  <br>No send in fantasy scorpions, spiders, and snakes wrapped in blankets with the black plague.<br><br>Or prostitutes with stds.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, Fantasy Insects would be a nightmare as well since the only thing stopping Insects genociding Earth is the fact that oxygen levels keep them small sized.</br>   mfw obliterating fantasy savages,   <br>It's the anime. Their is no massacring. Just destroyed land.</br>  <br>aw, why did they take away the togas?</br>  <br>Because it's A-1 Pictures and they don't like gore/violence/sexual things.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't anime Pinã look like LN Pinã?</br></br>  <br>That's her Knight armor. They exchanged stupid sculpted tit plates for cleavage windows. It's an upgrade.</br>  <br><br>I would have sent giant centipedes because those fuckers move fucking fast.<br><br>Just imagine fantasy centipedes.<br><br>The Japs would piss themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is bullshit</br>  <br>and somehow every character except kuribayashi gets my dick hard</br>  <br>I'd be surprised if they showed any rape. It's the only thing that gets my dick hard.</br>  <br>If you notice the first episode the only part that shows any form of death is when the MC stabs a guy and they pan out so you only hear that generic death sound.</br>  <br>Even if that was so, LN came after the manga or novel.</br>  <br>Where's big titty girl? Wasnt she a sargeant?</br>  <br>Actually, it seems she looks like that in manga too. Its her battle attire. They just gave her one design.</br>    <br>She is the brown-haired girl.</br>  <br>Damn moe shit in anime ruining characters.</br>  <br>If you mean the one with a close quarters combat badge, its the Genki middle schooler with brown hair and her arm up.<br><br>The Anime continues to ruin characters</br></br></br>  Is it common to erect barbed wire that fucking far from your base?<br><br>Like that barbed wire was at least 2 to 3 miles away from the Jap's base.<br><br>Is this a common thing to do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a boob window on that knight armor, the design on the chest plate makes it seem like it in the manga.</br>  <br>Yes. I mean, depends on a couple of factors, but that's not that strange.</br>  <br><br>It's so satisfying to watch.</br></br>  <br>and concertina wire will fuck your shit up. I was kind of looking forward to watching the soldiers try to deal with it, but they skipped over it.</br>  <br>The anime is literally ruining everything. The atmosphere is completely fucked during battles. The director can't into mood. Plus cancer faggots keep saying that the anime is good.</br>  I hate anime Rory.  <br>Congrats.</br>  <br>they literally have one fucking job, and that's doing the Italica Siege right.</br>  <br>Why is it pedantic to drop a show because it's not going to be giving him the one factor that interests him about the concept?<br>He wants to see modern military strength wreck medieval armies and magic and dragons and shit, not get that interesting stuff shoved to the background in favour of pandering and fantasy girl harem antics in the army.</br></br>  A-1 ruining everything once again.<br><br>I feel so bad because the source material is quite good.</br></br>  <br>  how dare someone enjoy this show! <br><br>I don't like it either, but simmer down bud</br></br></br>  <br>Fucked up flecktarn meets woodland, the camo.</br>  <br>their one job is to ruin gate.</br>  <br> good-looking character slutified to sell figmas <br>Into the trash immediately.</br></br>  <br>I'm just enraged everytime I think about this anime. It's one of the few animes I wanted to enjoy and looked forward to. I also can't stop watching it and being even more enraged.</br>  Dragons are pretty tanky.<br><br>Not one Jap brings back dragon scales for scientists to analyze despite the fact our scientists study shit like spider webs to learn how to make better armor and shit.<br><br>I thought Japs were Monster Hunter fans yet everyone of them don't care about monster loot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But they managed to get Itami's troll attitude just right.</br>  <br>Imperial tamed wyvern aren't dragons and yes, they collected samples</br>  <br> Not one Jap brings back dragon scales for scientists to analyze <br>Do we know this for sure? How do we know the story just decided not to explicitly focus on this aspect?</br></br>  I wanted more slaughter and mainly questinoing, the raw power of apache, shilkas, tanks and artillery.<br>I think they are trying to conserve this and use it to make a battle later even more epic.<br><br>Funny thing is I started watching Owari no Seraph, just because of that one scene with Apaches.<br>Thank god at least GATE gave me something to enjoy, that is not a gay shonen anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF <br> Apaches <br> shilkas </br></br></br>  <br>It's the vehicular diversity, that the Japanese crave for so much.</br>  <br>The JGSDF operates both Cobras and Apaches.</br>  <br>Yes finding a decent voice actor and just needing to copy lines from the LN or manga, i'd hope they'd get something right.</br>  <br>The Italica Crisis will probably be what you want.<br><br> Fairly large chopper group absolutely fucks up an army of marauders raiding a nearby town. </br></br></br>  <br> yfw they cut it down to a few helicopters and no gore </br>  <br>Probably be CG choppers destroying the ground around the enemy making them jump and disappear without a trace except for like 1 or 2 for visual effects.</br>  <br><br> yfw they cut it down to a few helicopters and no gore <br><br>I'll probably drop it right there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that's going to happen right?</br>  <br>thank god</br>  <br>It's more about a far more advance civilization interacting with a far less enlightened one. The manga put more focus on the nobility being inhuman and amoral by our modern standards.</br>  <br>The manga and light novel is about politics and world exploring while the anime is going to be about moe moe haremshit with the side plot of politics and world exploring.</br>  <br>You should expect another edit in the future.</br>  <br>Well, considering the Emperor scorched earth everything between Alnus Hill and the capital, locals shouldn't have too many warm fuzzies for him either. All they might know is that there's an army of green uniformed men who could squash 'em like bugs. Might as well make nice to 'em.</br>  <br> SAO, good first episode <br>Seriously though, there's "good self contained pilot" and in GATE's case, it's "build up of anticipation for next ep". Given the source material, they're gonna have to structure things differently from a conventional anime.</br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>I doubt that the military is very popular. If any of them come from the villages, they're most likely seen as traitors, willing to oppress their own family and friends for a paycheck. If some of them get shot up after being drafted, they'd probably get more angry at the belligerent empire for putting them in that situation than at their enemy who stands a chance of ending this bullshit altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their's no build up because the director can't into mood. Seriously the anticipation is destroyed because of this. Feels unnatural. It's like instead of blowing up a balloon and popping it, the person sticks a needle while the balloon is still being filled up.</br>  <br>does it kill you to post the back cover?</br>  <br>Well, except there hasn't been any fantasy girls yet. We get a "vision" in ep 1 and only just saw the elf at the very end of ep 2. And he's saying he's dropping it because there's too much pandering.<br><br>Meanwhile, the actual anime focuses way more on the combat and slaughter than even the manga. Granted, there's a lot of discretionary shots.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. Take for instance the scene with the doctor/whore. It wasn't focused on before because it wasn't pivotal to the main story and there's only so many aspects you can talk about. But yeah, seems the ministry of health's involved.</br>  <br>Here you go anon. I got that picture from Amazon so it only had the front cover.</br>  <br> Most of Pina's female knight order died <br> Bozes was one of the lucky few to survive and was later happily married to Tomita and had a child together <br><br>If only the other knights had the same luck as Bozes.<br><br>Seem like Pina is busy with the Empire's 'grand reopening'</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Short hair still betrays her childhood friend because the D was too good. </br>  <br>Go away Stephen King</br>  How can you guys watch this? The lack of gore makes it so tamed compared to the manga.  <br>For me it's more about the military and the wow factor of the natives. I could watch this trope forever.</br>  <br>I'm not really sure what gore would add. Then again I read the manga so even if its not show implicitly, in my head I still get the full picture. <br><br>Maybe anime only people do end up missing something. Still, I'm not sure it really is all that important, unless people want gore just for gore's sake.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm with you on that. Love that shit. But I don't like how the anime doesn't do the action justice.</br>  <br>It would die out pretty soon. You need to ration it throughout the show.<br>If you keep massacring them and they will still get surprised, it will start getting ridiculous.<br><br>That's why they toned down the initial fights in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4cx<wbr>yltqgt4E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Your reaction to this guy?</br></br>  <br>He's an idiot like always.</br>  <br><br>Not clicking the link. <br><br>I really don't care what some probably obnoxious youtuber thinks of Gate. If you want drama centered around random blogs and videos, head over to /v/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste that's what.</br>  <br> Rory wants the dick <br>I thought she just wants his soul</br></br>  <br>She's already made a couple advances towards Itami.<br><br> One at the onsen, when she tried to relieve her arousal from the fighting by seducing Itami. <br><br> Another was at the PX, when she was trying to get Itami drunk so she could have her way with him, but Yao interrupted. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   One at the onsen, when she tried to relieve her arousal from the fighting by seducing Itami.<br/> <br>you mean the kidnappers shootout?</br></br>  <br>Yep, she gets all worked up, and there's only two ways of relieving it.<br><br>One of them is killing people.</br></br></br>  <br>If only more people were like you, anon.</br>  <br>Why doesn't she just relieve herself by masturbating?</br>  <br> that shit taste <br> that retardation <br>I don't know why I watched it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she didn't want to masturbate and did want to fuck Itami.</br>  So considering the developments in the recent chapters, what are the odds of Rory ending up with mc?  <br>In fact, some of them actually have more developments than Itami himself. <br> <br>Kurata and his catgirl fetish lands him a catgirl girlfriend, and he is seen in many situations interacting with monstergirls<br><br>Tomita serves as Itami's right-hand man in most situations, mutually falls in love with one of Pina's knights, and marries her. He becomes the first interdimentional marriage between the two worlds. <br><br>Furuta actually develops a bond with one of the prime antagonists of the story, and become her light in the shadows. Unfortunately it does not end well for both. <br><br>Kuribayashi and Kurokawa both have lots of screentime, especially Kuri. Kurokawa's role as voice of reason and abuse of Itami is a running joke, as well as Kuri's bad luck getting a man. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>She also did this, which amused me</br></br>   morons who read only 40% story think they know how characters are developed <br><br>The manga is only through with 2 out of the 5 books for fucks sake, stop talking like you know everything</br></br>  <br>She's not very shy when it comes to Itami.<br><br>I mean, the first thing she does when they meet is sit on his lap.</br></br></br>  <br> Three dead people on cover <br><br>Why <br>Why do they do this</br></br></br></br>  一番初めの画像はコーヒーの分量だ  <br>I thought she just teased him: "This is what you missed"</br>  Is this a modern representation for the Mongol invasion of the Roman Empire?  <br>Are you implying defending your borders from marauding armies are the same thing as invading the whole fucking world?</br>  How old is Itami?  <br>MAN GOD MACHINE</br>  <br>33 at the start of the series, 37~38 by end of gaiden</br>  <br>there are no Finns in this though.</br>  <br> female soldiers <br>Fucking dropped.</br></br>  <br><br>I always found odd that MCs are either 13-20 or 30++<br><br>It's like the 20-30 age gap is mostly ignored.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that firing a gun is far from the only thing a soldier needs to do.</br>  <br>Assuming they didn't give the women any special treatment and they managed to get through the necessary training to qualify as soldiers, there's not much wrong with having them serve.<br><br>While it's true that the vast majority of women simply aren't up to the standards of most modern-day forces, if the few of them that can meet the standards do, then good on them for overcoming their inherent disadvantages.</br></br></br>  <br>You got triggered.</br>  <br><br>There are women who are physically fit and can handle military service.<br>Not a lot of them, but it's not impossible—it doesn't require lowering the standards of the military at all; just weed out the people who can't handle it. We do this for men trying to join the military too.</br></br></br>  <br> There's no MCs in their 20s <br><br>Just off the top of my head, these are all anime airing in 2015<br><br> Gintama <br> One Punch Man <br> Denpa Kyoshi <br> Utawarerumono 2 <br> BBB (Likely, Leo's age isn't stated) <br> Young Black Jack <br> Monster Musume <br><br>It's not as rare as you might think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well, pretty much this, i always complained about the whole ''stronk womyn in the army'', but i mainly complained because many armies lower they standards to let them pass, if they manage to pass the same test as the men's then i don't have much of a problem, but the problem of that is that suddenly they would be way too few women making all the special expenses just for them like sanitaty supplies for example an unnecesary extra bother, also i once read from a irak veteran about how they tend to disrupt the unit cooperation and how the rest of the unit end up ignoring procedures when a women falls injured or is about to get captured, they try to help them way more desperately in situations where if it were a man the one injured they would proceed like their training tells them to</br>  <br>This is incorrect, most of the named characters did survive. <br> <br>Survived: Pina, Bozes, Vifeeta, Hamilton, Panache (traitor), Gray<br>Died: Norma, Shandy, Suissess<br/></br></br> </br></br>    <br>The empire is a lot bigger than you think. <br>This isn't some stereotypical medieval french nation, this is like a Roman Empire combined with Mogols level of territory.</br></br>  <br> having problems with Kuribayashi Shino </br>  <br><br>Half of those animes are obscure and in the other half MCs are drawn like (and act like) teenagers anyway.</br></br>  <br> Monster Musume <br><br>Kimihito is actually 18.</br></br></br>  <br>The last thing they needed to do was intercept a Russian submarine, violating national waters in the Baltic, the Finns dropped depth charges on but they dropped electronic signs in the water saying that "welcome to Sweden: we're gay"<br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>15/may/13/swedish-peace-group-troll<wbr>s-russian-submarines-with-gay-defen<wbr>ce-system</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>   Shit character designs <br> Censored with a lot of good scenes left out already when it's barely even started <br> Awful animation <br>How can they fuck up an adaptation this bad?</br></br></br>  <br> implying Gintoki and Saitama are obscure, and that they are drawn like teens <br><br>Can you try harder than this?</br></br></br>  <br>He join after looking for work awhile after uni.

The name is so huge, not a single Japanese citizen is ignorant of the name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But most of the Order are mostly unnamed and died</br>  <br>Yeah but who cares about cunts with no name or character development. They're just numbers, like the soldiers that died in this episode. With boobs.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh but they do, the only reason that they look old to you it's because you are probably kids.<br><br>And you mentioned the popular ones not the other half.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's A-1, what did you expect?</br></br>  <br>Just watched the two episodes out for this. So far it's 10/10. I want to see the Emperor get #rekt, and more badassery like the commander who just wanted to shoot an arrow.</br>  <br> ALL DAT FUCKING SHIT TASTE </br>  <br>If I were on a mission to recon and negotiate with savges, I'd want to have as many cute, young, friendly looking women with me as I could.<br><br>It would help breaking the ice, as they showed on episode 2.</br></br></br>  Does this ever turn into something other than a one-sided massacre? What does king Dipshit think scorched earth tactics are going to do against mechanized infantry with access to roads?  <br>Yes.<br>Right, the King is supposed to know exactly what vehicles are as soon as a foreign invading force crosses the gate. Good job.</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking manga. It's great.</br>  <br>Well, the anon  you just answered to may have said something stupid, but its also true that with such losses being suffered the emperor should at least be more wary, try to know more and stop sending armies until he knows more, yeah okay, in last chapter the armies he sent were those of his vassal states as to weaken them so they don't revolt, but he should have already realized there is something extremely wrong when with such numerical advantage they still haven't achieved anything, haven't read the LN so it's just deduction but it looks like the emperor is so useless and delusional that he thinks all this it's his subordinates fault and that it will be fixed eventually through the raw military might of the empire</br>  <br><br>Then what's with all the harem/otaku pandering vibes in the OP?</br></br>  <br>Gotta amp it up for the sales and self-insert factor.</br>  <br>Making accurate report of any kind was an impossible task in BC time. He only knows his men were defeated but has no idea as to why.<br><br><br>It's one sided massacre but with a twist. <br>A modern army is organized to defeat another modern army. What this implies is JSDF does not have the capacity to occupy the enemy territory, thus unable to end the war. They cannot go roman style and just butcher people but without that, they end up looking after millions of people. <br>The real war in the field of diplomacy, social engineering and getting money somehow as real wars always are.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Making accurate report of any kind was an impossible task in BC time. He only knows his men were defeated but has no idea as to why. <br>exactly what i meant, with those numbers he should realize something's wrong<br>exactly what i meant, even if he doesn't believe the reports of metal monesters and stuff he should realize there has to be something</br></br></br>  <br>It only happens during downtime(even then its not much) though with the changes they'll be making I won't be surprised if they dial it up a few notches especially if they still want whiny leftist netizen bux.</br>  <br>He sure knows but it's either you kill or get killed. Letting your enemy clean up your domestic concerns like rebellious vassal states is no bad either.<br>I have to say the author's portrayal of the gate world is too grime though. The real romans were brutal but the gate world savages and the empire are worse to the point they would likely rot to death.</br></br>  <br> exactly what i meant, even if he doesn't believe the reports of metal monesters and stuff he should realize there has to be something <br>Here is something you had to realise; something got lost in the cultural clash. The Emperor assumed that if the JSDF was truly that powerful, they could have attacked the Empire's Capital straight away. Because that's what he would have done.<br><br>JSDF didn't try to invade and conquer because they didn't have the mandate and also they don't want to deal with rebuilding a crushed society. But that concept is alien to the Emperor. The Emperor assumed that the only reason the JSDF is still camping around the Gate, is because they are not as strong as they seemed. The Emperor mistaken JSDF's reservations as a sign of weakness.<br><br>The Japanese representatives behave diplomatically and speaks softly.

It will be too late when we learn what these cryptic symbols mean.  <br>No one knows, some anon claimed last thread that she's a slut for a ton of dudes and is used as hell but I have a hard time believing that.</br>  <br>He was supposed to draw the symbol for おまんこ (vagina, pic related) but got too excited and drew the map symbol for power plants. Another explanation I've heard is that 発電所 (power plant) and 自家発電 (private power generation; slang: masturbation) are similar.</br>  <br>The prim and proper ones are always raging sluts anon. Especially ones with apparent super human strength. She fucking kicked a iron door down in one kick.</br>  <br>I'd be okay with that.</br>  <br>The symbol MC drew on the field was a map symbol for "Power Plant", 発電所.<br>After some intense googling, I found out that 自家発電 or Private power generation could also mean Masturbation.<br>Power is generated at power plants, so he might be insinuating to the fact that the entire school is a masturbation ground or something.</br></br></br>  It means infinite!  <br>Ayame pregnancy test edit when</br>  <br>It's total bullshit.

The concept is a simple one: dolphin hits an enemy diver with a CO2 dart that injects him with compressed nitrogen, diver has an embolism, and diver is dead. It’s a very efficient and extremely hard to defend against. <br><br> I recently phoned two of my former colleagues who are still on active duty and asked them if they could confirm the rumor, and neither could. So I asked myself the question, did the US Navy EVER consider CO2 darts with regards to harbor anti-swimmer defense? I was shocked to find open source evidence that appears to admit that yes, they did. <br><br> ...The dolphins would have their simulated CO2 system attached to their nose, they would then ram us in the chest cavity to simulate the injection. The dolphins could kill just with this force alone (we had to dive with special padding) but the idea was to recover the bodies and any intelligence. <br><br> I actually saw one of the heavy gauge needles that attaches to their nose along with the harness and CO2 containers that were positioned just behind the head. They’re incredibly smart mammals and not pleasant to dive against.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>There's a book about dolphin-human sex written by a former SeaWorld employee.

That's literally all that's happening here.</br>  <br>I imagine the CO2 is the propellant for the dart, which injects the nitrogen.</br>  <br>Except that's not what I'm talking about. There's a very common archetype of girls who tell lewd jokes or act perverted, but once they're in bed they're shy and embarrassed just like any other girl, instead of down to fuck or genuinely interested in sex because otaku can't handle their true nature being like that. Always gotta have that pure girl underneath.</br>  <br>If you're not talking about anything in this thread, then why are you talking in this thread?</br>  <br>I'm talking about specific character archetypes, which these girls fall under.

Still was a blast marathoning this its nice seeing normal people in a normal setting, maybe slightly cater to our interest by working in the same media.</br>  Not OP; I originally avoided it because I had dropped all their older shows before. I don't know if watching it all in one sitting affected my thoughts, but it's now in my top 10 favourites.  It's better off to marathon the show in one go.  <br>You should try glasslip, a fine work by PA.</br>  <br>fuckoff</br>  <br>What? It was comfy as shit. Glassblowing and shit.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, but ive already seen that</br>   moeblobs making anime <br>Immersion broken, dropped after ep 1</br>  Well shit, I guess I'll download it now.  Who here bakuman?  Shirobako was amazing. Easily AOTY 2014.  When is the last BD out? I need to rewatch.  <br>Because you're new to /a/?</br>  <br>just in the middle of rewatching shirobako, introduced it to some normalfag friends and they all love it.</br>  <br><br>I was the same. Felt to jaded from Assrip to believe in PA works but Shirobako restored my faith. Their show this season looks great so I hope they continue their streak.</br></br>  This show was simply legendary, and Writer-Chan's side ponytail and glasses is quite possibly the most glorious thing I've ever witnessed.  <br>You're an underage retard from /v/ with shit taste?</br>  <br>Cause you're a shiro-BAKA</br>  It's fine, the threads had too much bullying in them anyways.  I cried bitch tears when  Zuka-chan got a role.   <br>This thread needs more side-ponytail-chan.</br>  <br><br>Best looking girl, at least.</br></br>  Tarou is such a glorious bastard      <br>I hate that little animation loop she has on that sequence.</br>    http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/658<wbr>29<br> No S2 <br> No movie <br> No OVA <br><br>（SHIROBAKO二期とか劇場版は）ないですね。<br>二期を作れるくらいのネタはあるけど<br>監督が何年も先までスケジュールが埋まってるから、頼みたくても頼めない。<wbr><br>今は企画の可能性を考えてもいません。OVAでも難しい。</br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>    <br>You should address her as diesel-san.</br>  <br>Because you're one hell of an idiot.<br> Not watching everything when a new season comes. <br> Does not have the technique to tell if a show is good or bad from seeing the OP only. </br></br></br>  About halfway through the show. I'm enjoying it but it's starting to hit a little too close to home.<br><br> looking for work <br> job burnout <br> questioning your future <br><br>It feels too real ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>    It's my AOTY for 2014.

It's one of those good shows that is just forgotten. <br><br>All the Bakos are great, but Ema and Aoi the best.</br></br>     mfw S2 never   Because you don't believe in Mizushima killing it every time..  What ever happened to the donut schtick?  Was FUNNY STORY lazy or just stupid?  <br>He had a job to do and he was doing it. His higher ups wanted the author to get that next chapter done and the only way he knew how to get things moving was to cut him off from distractions and leave him to focus until he made a breakthrough.<br><br>Funny Story was essentially doing the same thing that Musani did to the director when he wouldn't finish the storyboards for Exodus. It turned out to be the completely wrong approach and a good editor would have known that, but funny story was a blithering corporate yes-man, so of course he didn't know any better.</br></br></br>  I missed it when it was airing because the title sounded cute and the thumbnails for the OPs of the threads always looked cute. Same reason I missed Pleiades.<br><br>It's not like I hate cute either, it's just that there's so much of it that it becomes part of the background.</br></br>  <br>But episode 1 was just the setup. I was expecting it to suck ass because "cute girls making cute anime" but it turned out so much better than expected.</br>  <br>how can a man's dick be safe from those hips??</br>    I want to live with Diesel san.  I want to make Ema a single mom.  <br><br>Enjoy ep23</br></br>  <br>Because watching stuff while it's airing is dumb. Just wait till it's done and meanwhile watch older stuff.</br>  <br>only normalfags watch this, this shit is boring as fuck, and i really want to slap the mc</br>  <br> not watching it with /a/ </br>  <br>and now he's back to having to fallback on his shitty freelance photographer job because he's easily expendable due to the nature of this job and somebody having to pay for this.</br>  <br> Aoi will never smile at you mischievously </br>  <br><br>Good they know who best of the best girls were</br></br>  <br>what if I have keyframes?</br>  <br>His job was to facilitate communication between Musani and the author, not cut the staff out of every decision and fuck them over at every opportunity. He was supposed to know what needed to be communicated when. Sure the author can't be bothered for every little thing but clearly some back and forth is needed. Funny Story just lied to both parties so he could fuck off to the golf course.</br>  <br>I never doubted her for a second</br>  <br>But if you don't watch it while airing, you don't get to be in threads in progress.<br><br>I imagine /a/ Shirobako threads lost their shit when literally Anno saved Christmas but I wasn't around to see it and archive searching is a piece of shit. I imagine they also had threads where they pretended the Third Aerial Girl's Squad is a real anime but I never was in those either.</br></br></br>  bako and cross ange had some of the best threads I've been in on /a/  <br>You also missed the threads where people thought Hiraoka was Yano's ex and the shitstorm in Twitter that caused the staff to come out and state they never had anything.</br>  <br>Dammit, Cross Ange. I never picked it up because the threads about the first episode were all toxic shitposting about whether the heroine had a rod shoved into her spine or her vagina and just never paid attention again, even when they were going on about WHERE WERE YOU WHEN MAGNETO WAS BORN</br>  <br>You missed out.</br>  <br>All I know is that it was allegedly the closest we've had to Geass R2's balance of stupid and fun in a long time, after Valvrave and Guilty Crown were mostly just stupid and not fun.<br><br>But I still haven't gotten round to it because my backlog is a mile long and the threads are over anyway.</br></br></br>  I love Mii-chan!  <br> No chairs for Diesel  <br> Bullying her because she's the youngest  <br><br>Disgusting</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Mii was real, you guys can get married in the US now.</br></br>  <br>m8 first episode threads were gold</br>  <br> Not Tatami Galaxy the superior work </br>  <br>He really killed it with Another.</br>  <br> these hips <br> male <br>Bully, stop</br></br></br>  <br>It's still around 8 months until everybody starts considering it a shit</br>    <br>Lord have mercy.</br>  <br>You fucked up.</br>    <br>Has this motherfucker explained how he does these yet</br>  <br>It doesn't look any different</br>  <br>This is acceptable.</br>    <br>Content aware scaling.</br>  <br><br>Thank you very much; now I too, can be cancerous.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942466 <br>I regret nothing.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942849 <br>I want to shiro those bakos.</br>  <br>The cutest girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127942849 <br>That doujin was hilarious.

Also wondering whether Naoto is actually Ragna or not now since  it might endanger muh Rachel x Ragna ships if Raquel=Rachel theory is true ;_; <br><br>Also some source says that this is actually the last installment of BB (maybe from twitter or something?).</br></br></br>  NAOTO?! How the fuck? He shouldn't exist! He seriously shouldn't exist in this time frame!  <br>I'm positive they will explain it with some bullshit anyway.<br><br>Also he seems to be important to the plot so having his story to be done in the main game is better than finishing it in the novel where not many people read it.</br></br></br>  <br>Parallel worlds. <br>There's your answer.</br></br>  So will this be the sixth or seventh time i've bought this fucking game  <br>Technically this is the 4th installment storywise</br>  <br>I'm just so fucking tired of BlazBlue at this point</br>  <br>Maybe they simply haven't announced Mai yet and will do so later. Or she might be added to the console release. It's too early to conclude that she'll be DLC.</br>  <br>Guilty Gear is back.</br>  <br>Rachels new portrait makes her look so damn cute now.</br>  <br> Also some source says that this is actually the last installment of BB <br>I sure hope so. I had my fun with it but it really needs to be put to rest.</br></br>  <br>Mori has said that this installment will conclude Ragna's story. That doesn't necessarily mean that it will be the final game of the franchise.</br>  <br>We'll see them later, I assume Hibiki and Nine are mostly finished as we know there was data for them in CP and a few quotes. But the real kicker is that TERUMI AND HAZAMA ARE ALIVE! How the fuck are they alive? What the fuck does this picture mean? Mai,Kajun and Jubei better be shown soon</br>  <br>Yes. BB has been going on too long, unlike other fighting game franchises.</br>  <br> implying we won't get an extended version at some point </br>  <br>So chances are that Naoto guy is going to be the new MC or something?</br>  <br>God I hope not. He was such an annoying faggot in Bloodedge Experience and here it seems like all he wants to do is destroy Murakumos.</br>  Reposting from /vg/ thread https://twitter.com/tapioka_kana/me<wbr>dia . They also have translations of the trailer<br><br> rip ragna ;_; </br></br></wbr>  <br>They literally had plat and hazama stab each other and fall into a fucking lake. Those were the least confirmed deaths ever.</br>  <br>I think that Mai will be in the new game at some point. The fact they included Remix Heart in CPEX was to a large extent in order to introduce her (and Kajun) to the people who have only played the games, sort of how CP introduced Celica before she was made playable in CPEX.<br><br>Hazama and Luna never died; only Terumi and Trinity did so. Maybe they left Terumi as a playable character but he won't be in the story mode. Or perhaps he could appear in flashbacks to justify having him in.</br></br></br>  <br>Other series had better long-term planning than BB. BB has been a mess throughout it's relatively short life.</br>  Call me when the Extend is out.<br><br>Jesus christ, they're actually worse than Capcom with how often they're releasing shit. At least Capcom eventually decided to use patches.</br></br>  Where's my Alpha?  <br> Half of the cast <br> New game has new waifu nobody asked <br> Baiken never <br>Ishiwatari can choke on Mori's dick for copying him so much now, in the past was the reverse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For someone who hasn't read the LNs can you elaborate on this theory?</br>  <br>All I want is Anji, is that too much to ask?</br>  Will Ragna finally get his well deserved happy ending this time?  <br> Ragna <br> Happy Ending <br>Choose only one option.</br></br></br>  Maybe Mai won't be in the new game, if they were hyping her up to be playable in CPEX, you'd think she would be in the reveal. Maybe Mai's shitty taste-buds and lack of Noel's cooking did kill her.  <br>Maybe Ragna will die and then Kokonoe will do what she did with ν-13 and pull his soul out of the Boundary and stick it into an old Murakumo unit. Thus producing the α-1 Murakumo that Mori has designed. Female Ragna could then live happily as Noel's, Makoto's and Tsubaki's new BFF.</br>  <br>No need to worry. Mori has said that Mai's adventures will continue and has drawn what she looks like at the time of the games.</br>  <br> Mori in charge of designs that don't look like shit <br><br>Why hasn't anyone put him in his place.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai is totally not gonna be playable now that we have Hibiki channeling Sho Minazuki with his two swords.</br>   Kohaku Hibiki <br> Not using Kohaku or Hibiki's moves. </br>  <br>Mai fights with a sword and parrying dagger rather than two swords though. And she also has her grimoire that might give her additional abilities.</br>  <br>God, I have an urge to bully you. /asg/ was right.</br>  <br>Just play leo. it's pretty much the same.</br>  <br>I don't even have CPE yet wtf.<br><br>Hype for nine though, that's fuckin sweet~<br><br>nine vs kokonoe mother daughter battle song when</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai's moveset consists of cooking and kissing.</br>  <br>Also I doubt Mai's in the game when someone who hasn't been hyped at all or even known to people who only play the games is confirmed playable in the reveal, and Mai is not.</br>  <br>I want Mai to cook for me.<br><br><br>The console version won't even come out in Japan until 2017 and in the US until even later. CPEX will be the latest version for a fair bit of time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> her <br><br>That's still a man, even with magic sex change.</br></br></br>  <br>Just like Noel is still underage and Rachel is still a little girl. This game is kinda offensive when it comes to basic human biology, For fucks sake there's even bestiality and incest in it. Why isn't it rated AO or M?</br>  Reminder that Mai is a tranny and to filter autism maximum maiolev  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Mai was after all the protagonist of a 2 hour segment in BBCPE and also provided a system voice, which has been a first step for other characters along the path towards being made playable. And there was a phone strap of her being released alongside two other girls who are pretty popular and already playable. Considering the exposure Mai has received, and the fact she has an established fighting style and that a design for her after graduating has already been revealed.<br><br>Plus, there are a number of possible reasons for Mai appearing in the game. Mai's noble house was specifically mentioned in CP as being the only one that hasn't allied itself with Kagura, so she may be needed to help get the Hazuki family on Kagura's side. Another possibility is that her power which lets her read thoughts or memories could be of use to the protagonists for some reason. And of course she's a warrior so she could also help in that.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet Naoto had none of those things, and he's playable while she is not.</br>  <br>You know if youre sexually attracted to Mai that means youre gay right?</br>  <br>I'd say that you are jumping the gun. Just because it hasn't been announced that she's playable doesn't mean that she won't be.</br>  <br>But Rachel isn't human and Noel is Noel.</br>  <br><br>If they're showing off two nobodies that are going to be part of the main cast now, Mai will most likely be Day 1 DLC. <br><br>Amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's better to adopt a wait and see approach. No need to jump to conclusions.</br>  <br><br>It's not exactly jumping if they're willing to show off characters who have had no prior exposure to the series, but yet here they are. Face it, Mai will be DLC.</br></br>  I just want Ragna to have a happy ending, is that so much to fucking ask for.  <br>Technically Nine hasn't been officially announced either. And I doubt that they'd release a new version of the game with just 3 new characters. I remain optimistic.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br> And I doubt that they'd release a new version of the game with just 3 new characters <br><br>Do you know what company you're even talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>They've never done that except for EX versions</br>  <br>No kidding, Full price for just fucking Johnny and Jack-O in the new GG xrd game is disgusting.</br>  <br>I'm glad they are still sticking with 2D animation</br>  <br>CS had 4 new characters, CSE had 4 extra ones, CP had 5 new characters and CPE 3 extra ones. I doubt that there will only be 3 new characters in CF.</br>  <br>- No price has been announced yet<br>- There is a third new character that hasn't been revealed yet<br>- They will most likely add new characters for the console version like ArcSys does with pretty much all their games</br></br></br>  <br> They will most likely add new characters for the console version like ArcSys does with pretty much all their games <br>man i love dlc characters from the start</br></br>  Does the PS4 version of BBCPE look that much better then the PS3 one? <br><br>I'll probably grab either one when it hits bargain bin prices</br></br>  <br> CPE 3 extra ones <br>Let me stop you right there, Lambda 11 does not count as an extra character.</br></br>  <br>You mean Nine?</br>  <br>Sin is unlockable and Elphelt was a free download for a month.</br>  <br>I was refering to Kokonoe, Terumi and Celica.</br>  <br>When she had a different fighting style and move set, yes she does.</br>  <br>That's like saying Ken doesn't count as an extra character.</br>  <br>I was talking about Xrd. Nine is obviously the arcade boss that will be a timed release on arcade and available on console right away. Going by their past behavior you can expect the console version to have the three new arcade characters, one console unlockable character, one free DLC character and one paid DLC character.</br>  <br>Graphic's the same. Only loads so much faster.</br>  Is it going to be PS4 exclusive?  <br><br>This isn't an anime.</br></br>  <br>What pattern? That never happened in Continuum Shift. We got 3 at the start, 1 unlockable and 1 was time released DLC with the other 2 coming much later.</br>  Is Naoto someone I should know?  <br>I meant Arcsys pattern more than BB pattern, it's close to what happened with BBCP, P4AU and Xrd</br>   [m.3.3.w]_Working!!!_01_[1080p][05<wbr>684217].mkv</wbr> <br><br>It lives! m.3.3.w fucking lives!<br><br> Just an excuse to have a Working thread. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't all working threads just Yamada threads?</br>  <br>Wow legit, I remember their subs being the best for the previous seasons, hopefully it's the same staff.</br>  <br> m.3.3.w <br>Woah. This decent fansub group is still alive. Downloading.</br></br>  <br>Why would I wait an extra week for these subs?</br>  I was amazed Inami didn't lay a finger on anyone last episode  <br>Reminder that Yamada a literal shit.</br>    <br>You shut your filthy fucking whore mouth</br>  <br> Yamada still a shit </br>  <br>Character development.</br>  <br>I want to rub Inami's head. But she'd just punch me.  She's also not real.  </br>  I want an episode where Inami accidentally punches and kills a male baby then gets arrested.  I missed the old fansub groups in our time. SS-Eclipse, Ayako, m.3.3w, Mazui, Shinsen, etc.  <br>I thought /a/ didn't like eclipse.</br>  <br>Dunno about that, they're just pretty slow as fuck.</br>  <br>I miss Mazui.</br>  <br>What about Your Mom? That was the meme cartel of those times.</br>  Remember when Popura was the main girl in this show?  <br>it getting better since Yamada appear</br>  <br>No, not really.</br>  <br>no</br>    <br><br>She should hurry up and get written out of the show</br></br>  <br>Loving every meme.</br>  Will we get to see Souta's sister have hot makeup sex with her ex next episode?  <br><br>S1? Yeah, it wasn't that great. Ever since S2 Inami stopped being Narusegawa v556 she's stolen the spotlight.</br></br>  <br> m.3.3.w <br>Literally who?</br></br>  こんやがやまだ！  Despite her many flaws, I find Inami very cute. Cute, would sex, hard.    <br>She had the most development after Izumi, who managed to take a walk outside without dying.</br>  <br>A lot of these characters have had character development. Ironically enough, Poplar doesn't have any development. She's just cute.</br>  <br>Welcome to /a/. Please don't stay long.</br>  <br>She do manage to write on the damage report, it's a great improvement.</br>  <br><br>Isn't it nice? A show with real development that's not a sudden change but also isn't stagnation. I almost didn't think it was possible.</br></br>  <br>You mean episode one? Yeah, that was an okay episode I guess.</br>  <br>Why? Half of season 2 was her not punching anyone at all, and the other half was barely any punches at all.<br>Pay more attention.</br></br>   Look through my folder <br> Noticed [gg] used to sub the second season <br><br>Those were good times. I always went with [gg].</br></br></br>  Quality animation!  <br>Gah! fuck whats wrong with her eye?</br>  <br>The things I would to do to female Yamada would get me arrested in every Western nation on earth and probably a shot at parliament in Russia.</br>  <br>Yamada seems ready for buttfucking.</br>  <br>Just saw it, I'm really happy they are still around for Working.</br>  I wish male Yamada go more screen time or at least was treated better.<br>He's a pretty cool guy.</br>   m.3.3.w <br><br>Can't say I cared for their subs</br></br>  <br> opening dead fansub sites <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I fucking loved m.3.3.w<br>I remember times with their subbing Kimikiss.<br>Good old times.</br></br></br>  WanWan or PanPan?  <br>PonPon</br>   inami still best girl <br> new episode soon <br>wonderful</br></br>  <br>She's not best because she never had any competition.</br>  <br>Like who? Other than the main couple the other characters stay pretty much the same. Well, I guess some also have their background elaborated on if that counts. And yeah, Poplar is a mascot character.</br>  beach ep when  <br><br> inami  <br> best <br>Since when? Yamad and Popura have always been superior.</br></br></br></br>  Lads, I think I want to ejaculate on her beautiful visage.  So many best girls.  <br>Yamad is best Muslim!</br>  watched and enjoyed the entire episode one and didn't realise that this is a third season. Is it like that with the previous ones? How much Yamada is there?  <br>They had the best subs for both previous seasons.<br>There isn't a real reason to wait a week for them anymore, (especially when people have been spoiled by simulcasts and FFF is doing a very good job this time around) but I guess it's kind of nice that an old school group came back from the grave for this.<br><br>I particularly won't mind waiting for them if only for nostalgia's sake.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yamada shows up halfway through Season 1 I think. So there's about 1 and 1/2 seasons of Yamada.<br><br> But Yamada a shit </br></br></br></br>   32 minutes until episode 2 airs   3 minutes.

It's been a long time since I've seen this series.</br></br>  <br>Are professionals somehow perfect now?</br>  <br>Not mad, just stating the obvious</br>  <br>That's a rookie mistake, "professional" subs shouldn't have something like that</br>  <br> defending CR <br>Oh, I forgot, it's summer</br></br>  <br>It's literally missing just one key register.<br><br>I can't believe how much people whine about tiny typos in professional subtitles that they don't even pay for in the first place. Did your brain somehow fail to understand the scene because it said "Yoko-san"? Because if it did, I think we have more important issues at hand than the missing K.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice try Daiz</br></br>  <br>soon. He even manage to make her punch him willingly</br>  <br>So every typo is forgivable because of you understand things because they're implied?</br>  Is anyone else feeling a bit underwhelmed by the third season so far?    <br>Yes? You make it sounds like the subtitles are the most important part and not understanding the scenes.</br>  <br>Nigger what? Eclipse were speedsubs.</br>  <br>You're being a little bitch.<br>Would you rather wait longer for the new episode so they can triple check it just for you?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>    <br>You must've started watching anime this summer if you think this is worth whining about.<br><br>When it comes to anime subtitles, this is just a fucking drop in the bucket. We've had to deal with a lot worse stuff for decades.</br></br></br>   fighting over subs <br> not using the raws <br>Fucking plebs</br></br>  <br><br><br>Daiz pls</br></br></br>  webm when?  This doesn't look like beer.   people is actually defending crunchyroll <br><br>I know they're summerfags or newfags, but still is fucking sad</br></br>  <br>I would rather them be competent enough to not make these simple fuckups in the first place, especially since they're getting paid for it.</br>  <br>Are you saying that you have never made a typo and you are in fact paying for a Crunchyroll subscription?</br>  <br> dirty talk </br>  <br> he called me summerfag! <br> no you're the summerfag! </br></br>  <br>I've never been paid to make a typo.</br>  <br>Are you saying you work for Crunchyroll and you're the one that made the typo?</br>  <br>I hope someone is paying for you to be a whiny bitch on an imageboard. Otherwise this isn't really a good way to spend your time.</br>  <br>First episode was kinda slow as per usual but this episode was amazing. Did you even watch it?</br>  <br>So you're the one that made the typo? What a faggot</br>  <br>I hope someone is paying you to shill for CR.</br>  <br>Says the guy that's bitching on an imageboard about people bitching on an imageboard</br>  <br>No, I never make typos. I am in fact perfect.<br><br><br>I would love to be paid by Crunchyroll for posting this. That seems like the easiest job in the world since it doesn't even require advertising Crunchyroll.</br></br></br></br>  <br>entire ending or just the part with Yamada?</br>  <br> enjoying the chapter <br> suddenly ed starts <br> is it over already <br><br>I haven't felt like this in a long time, I need next episode NOW</br></br></br></br></br>  DDY are legitimately the best subs for this. M33W were surprisingly bad, mostly because of incosistencies with the kohai-senpai scene and just poor editing in general. FFF were a little stilted though not bad, but considering DDY have a localised track and are more likely to release on time why bother.  <br> on 4chan <br> being perfect <br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>I can't drink beer and have never seen it. So I just assumed that was accurate but is that really not what it looks like?</br>  1 &gt; 3 &gt; 2<br><br>This is fact</br></br>  <br>DDY subs are usually the best choice for any show these days. Well, it's not like there's a lot of choices.</br>  <br>Beer doesn't stick to the sides and look so viscous. Anyone would guess they're looking at an empty beer mug though.</br>  <br>Anyways, here's the part with Yamada.</br>  Inami is  hot <br><br>But damn, only one episode of Working a week isn't enough. Think I gotta rewatch the first two seasons.</br></br>  <br>I like how she faints while standing.</br>  <br>I under stand the first pass out but the second eludes me, did she faint again hearing the dirty talk Yachiyo was spewing?</br>  <br>I think she was still out of it since her close encounter.</br>  <br>She hasn't cooled off from overheating.</br>      <br>Still like the second ED better. Nothing beats Yamada and Soma egging on Takanashi with tambourines, also Poplar shaking her assets.</br>  <br>I think that might be the closest a dude has ever gotten to her without getting a punch in return. Does Inami not take the bus or the train to school? This is Japan after all.</br>  <br>She takes a shortcut, where she met Kirio.</br>  I was thinking this episode was pretty slow but then the next thing I know it's already finished.  <br><br>She takes shortcuts through seldomly travelled back-streets to avoid as much human contact as possible whether it is for school, work, or everything else</br></br>  <br>It was closer in S2, see <br>She has been fainting with Takanashi for a while now and resisting with others as was shown in ep1.<br><br>Also she says "chika~" here, i.e. "he's too close", not "chikan".</br></br></br></br>  <br>How did she not recognize him? Is he that different lookin' without the glasses?</br>  <br>Just like he didn't recognize any of the girls.</br>  Feels weird to be legitimately excited for a show every week.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127940699 <br>It's pretty funny how you managed to download this 3 times while trying to download other things.</br>  We need to go wider. Also, it's odd that Katenashi's parents were divorced despite their family seems normal and all.  So whose subs of the 4 groups are:<br>The memest<br>Have the least typos and grammatical errors<br>Have the best type setting<br>Most accurate</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss AFK.</br>  I always thought Souma was way more sadistic than that.  <br>I thought their father was dead and that Kazue was the divorcee?</br>  <br><br> Wide Poplar <br><br>Just as I expected from someone voiced by Asumi Kana<br><br>Actually if you remembered S1  that their father is dead and it is Kazue aka the oldest that was divorced </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yamada of the world.

I want to know who will voice Muranushi and Kamakura.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her real name is Mitsuki. She's Youhei's twin sister often times referred to as the Mashiba twins.

Why they bothered to add two extra bloody tracks just to keep Popura as a name alternative is beyond me.   opened her eyes for a second <br><br>ayy</br></br>  <br>She did the same before, when Satou talked about some ghost in S1 (that one time Yamada told Yachiyo the one Satou liked was her, Yachiyo freaked out and then Satou made up some silly story about seeing a ghost behind Yachiyo).</br>  Yamada of warudo  Kuronyan desu.  Oh J, Yutanpo and Natsume, you guys are dead but I'll watch Working in memory of you.  <br>This is one of those times i want a image to be a crop but it's not.</br>    <br>Do kids even know what fansub is these days anymore?</br>  <br>Kids these days don't have to deal with Hong Kong translated fansubs from 3 dvd disc $30 bootlegs.</br>   liking yamada <br>literally the worst girl</br>  I want to spoil Yamada.  <br>the reason i have almost stopped watching anime completely</br>  I want a standing paizuri from Poplar.  <br>Manager could go either way. She might have fucked someone in her gang just because she felt like it.<br><br>Kazue was married, so she's not pure and Kozue is a slut. Izumi and Nazuna are as pure as the driven snow.</br></br></br>  Why are the fansub leftovers this season only subbing shit simulcasted by CR, but almost none by FUNi?<br><br><br>I don't miss Shinsen. They picked up shitloads of stuff and dropped over half of all after a while.</br></br></br>  <br>sometime</br>  <br>She's Henchperson #2. Kozue is dating Henchperson #1 (apparently).</br>  <br> Manager could go either way. <br>Doubt it, given her personality I doubt she even cares about sex.<br><br>But yeah, the only non-virgins in Working are Kazue and Kozue. Well, Haruna (Otoo's wife) is very likely non-virgin as well.<br><br>I'm not mentioning the mothers, because those are blatant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kozue is dating Henchperson #1 <br>She's just pestering him, so that he marries her.</br></br>  <br> Doubt it, given her personality I doubt she even cares about sex. <br>Agreed, but I could easily see her idly waving her hand towards a henchman and going, "Oy, get over here and fuck me."</br></br>  What does this bear remind me off?<br><br>I swear this bear has appeared in more than 1 shows.</br></br>  <br>I can see her prostituting herself for food.</br>  <br>Daisy had a cameo in SxS if that's what you're thinking of,</br>    <br> It didn't. <br>Yes, it did.<br> 全7巻 *3,938 --,--- サーバント×サービス <br>It's not enough for a S2, especially compared to Working. There won't be anything, because the manga ended and on the same event that Working got S3, SxS got nothing despite being newer.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Editor here, script's been done for a while, it's just waiting on TLC and QC.<br><br>  Why they bothered to add two extra bloody tracks just to keep Popura as a name alternative is beyond me. <br><br>Basically because we couldn't come to an agreement on whether to use Poplar or Popura. I prefer the former, leader-kun prefers the latter. It doesn't matter for this episode because nobody calls Taneshima by her first name. Honestly the honorifics shit is more tedious, but we do it for you. &lt;3</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like leader-kun is daft<br>Usurp his throne</br></br>  <br>Any chance DameDesuYo does the BDs? Or are you just going to leave it to tlcatlc6?</br>  <br>I have no idea. leader-kun fucking loves this show though, it's his baby. So maybe?</br>  <br>It isn't, and they do</br>  <br>Do any of you guys translate manga?<br>If you do, could you pick up the one for Working?<br><br>Japanzai has pretty much dropped it, and the anime has skipped several things.</br></br></br></br>  <br> skipped several things <br><br>Isn't it just a 4koma? Those things have plot?</br></br></br>  <br>It's a 4koma, and though they don't have "plot" they do have some very nice and funny moments, and there's plenty of character and relationship development as well.<br><br>Not to mention the anime doesn't adapt the story in order, and thus things flow a lot nicer in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Sickly shut ins are cute</br>  This season's really fucking great so far. It reminds me of what Tadaima did for Minami-ke.  <br>Fortunately, Takanashi likes her that way.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  Walk along the street find this, what do?  Y-Y-Yeah...  <br>penis in pooper</br>  <br>Grab a cart and take her home, naturally.</br>  Those lips are ready to be kissed.  <br>That's just an act.

Almost rape all the time. Plus there's plenty of room for some kinky roleplay. This is my fetish.</br>  <br>By the end of the series, he treats her too kindly to be the type likely to do anything to her against her will. With her fainting spells and anxiety attacks, I imagine it would take several years before they can work up to having sex. Maybe not until their wedding night.</br>  <br>It's not that it's against her will, she has been quite willing right from the very beginning, but exactly her willingness to do that combined with anxiety and other reactions that makes it hot.<br> Inami-san, I have read about a new way to treat your androphobia. Shall we try it? <br> T-takanashi-kun nara... ii yo... </br></br></br>  <br> T-takanashi-kun nara... ii yo... <br><br>Does that mean "It's okay because it's Takanashi-kun?"</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much, but "nara" is more "if".</br>  <br>Okay thanks!</br>  <br><br>I for one couldn't care less for honorifics but bringing that up usually causes shitstorms around here so eventually stopped. Either way, GJ so far.</br></br>  why is moenami so moe? she fucking fainted. and its confirmed she IS hot as fuck!  <br>Praise the lord for honorifics and death to "B-Bro".</br>  <br><br>Weeb scum please go and stay go.</br></br>  <br>Before I watched this, a friend showed me the OPs first. I genuinely thought this Inami was a cross-dressing boy from the start.<br> Still the best </br></br>  I just started watching this, Inami pisses me off and i want Poplar to win but it doesn't seem likely. Yamada possibly a best.<br><br>Also the naming for the seasons is fucking retarded</br></br>  <br> Poplar to win but it doesn't seem likely. <br>Win what?</br></br>  <br> Poplar to win but it doesn't seem likely <br>Takanashibowl?<br>Only person in the running is Inami and the water flea.

I'm going to marry Haruharu!    I want to undress Towa.  Haruka is a unique and interesting character in her own right who even now continues to fail and work hard to overcome that and achieve her dream.  I really can't bring myself to like Minami no matter how much I try. She's quite honestly, boring as fuck and it's easy to tell that even the staff itself does not care about doing anything with her.<br><br>Maybe they will do something with her in the future, but by them, I'd be way too far for me to start caring.<br><br>One is supposed to want to see more development or an end of a character arc during those stages, not to want for anything to be done with the character itself.</br></br></br></br>  If anyone says anything bad about Mana in this thread I'm going to cry.  <br>I'm so glad Minami got the short end of the stick instead of Kirara.</br>  <br>Funny faces don't make you unique or interesting unless you're Erika.</br>  I want to like Gopri, but I know Kirara's not gonna have much screeentime or relevancy to the overall plot other than being the yellow cure.  <br>Mana a shit. A SHIT.</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Last thread was kinda too heated, so I waited until this new thread. So, today has a pair theme with the following pairs being the attention: Mushiban &amp; Sirloin  (what the hell is this kind of name?) , Momozono Love &amp; Aono Miki, Kenzaki Makoto &amp; Davi, Tsumugi &amp; Zeke, Pafu &amp; Aroma.<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-11?<wbr>lang=en<br>http://togetter.com/li/846033?lang=<wbr>en</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erika wasn't very interesting asides being comedy relief.</br>  <br>We are literally getting a Kirara + Towa arc just now. I'm not sure what more else you fucks could want. Be grateful because had this been another series none of the girls but Haruka would have interacted with Towa in any meaningful way.<br><br>At this point I'm still amazed people bitch and complain about muh screentime and muh relevancy for non-pinks after 3 fucking years of Precure being PINK, PINK, PINK.<br><br>Maybe things will change next year now that that chucklefuck of Shibata will probably finally be gone but just in-case mentally condition yourself to pre-emptively like next year Pink the most. You'll get all your screentime and relevancy that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but it means that it will have the classic archetypes that little girls like, there are literally no cure that isn't an achetype, the important is the execution.<br><br><br>That is your opinion.<br>Personally I never liked the genky archetype and I love the silent introvert girl archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arc </br>  <br>Yes, arc. If you had bothered to read the spoilers you'd see it's like 3 episodes of nothing but Kirara + Towa.</br>   the redemption of kid with huge chin <br>how</br>  <br>Kirara and Towa are roommates. With Towa being the second most important Gopri Cure after Haruka that means Kirara is sure to gain more relevance than she currently has.</br>  <br>I love how she chases after her childish dream wholeheartedly, and puts in the effort necessary. Unlike what people guessed at the beginning, she doesn't keep jumping from thing to thing, and is focusing on mainly violin and ballet, not tennis or tea pouring or whatever. I like how much she values her bond with Kanata, and how last episode when she wanted to save Towa, it wasn't because of some sense of justice or wanting to fight against Dyspear, it was simply because she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata. I like her antics and clumsiness, and how she doesn't immediately win everyone over. Does she share traits with past pink cures? Of course, that's why she's the leader, but it's her specific personality and combination that makes her Haruno Haruka.</br>  <br> she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata.  <br>I liked this part too.</br></br>  <br><br>Even the Crimson Chin admitted his wrongdoings.</br></br>  Favorite silly Precure fanart? I really like this one, the way the skin is drawn looks very soft and smooth. Like a marshmallow.  <br>What? Smile gave good screentime to Miyuki, Yayoi and Akane; only Nao and Reika got shafted. Only DD and HaCha's second half were PINK PINK PINK.</br>    Fresh: KANPEKI and Animal Girl get shafted<br>Hearcatch: Itsuki gets shafted after Moonlight joins<br>Suite: Kanade gets shafted<br>Smile: Nao and Reika get shafted<br>DD: There are characters not named Mana?<br>HaCha: Everyone but Hime gets shafted in the first half, everyone but Gumi gets shafted in the second half</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like this one.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>This.<br>What makes Haruno good isn't her super original archetype, but the way she has been handled.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>This is completely unrealistic</br>    <br>Oh wait, I missed the word "silly". If so, this one.</br>  I know an easy way for a young girl like Towa to earn some money...guehuehue.    <br>Which shafted Cure hurts you the most?</br>  <br>I was about to get mad thinking you thought her suffering was silly, but then I saw you posted , which is cute.<br><br> Peace signs <br>Can't stop associating it with hentai, though the art is high quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>White.</br>    Some nice one-draws today.      <br>Nao and Reika.<br><br>I'm still mad about no NaoRei episode. God, I fucking hate Yonemura so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Rikka and Minami.</br>  <br>Hime.</br>  <br> Hime <br> shafted </br></br>    <br>I want to impregnate Reika.</br>  <br>We all want.</br>  Reika is top gang bang material.

Did they handle the bad guy switching sides thing better than in Fresh?    <br> everyone makes a big fucking deal about Kayano <br> after she starts going to school nobody really gives a shit </br></br>  <br>What makes this way more bearable than HaCha's/Ace's make up?</br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>I wouldn't say better than Fresh. But not a terrible blunder either. Interestingly enough she seems to be the Yellow's companion rather than the Pink's.</br>  <br>She's a toppu moderu.</br>      <br>Ace had nice looking make up though.</br>  <br>I'd shaft Nao and Reika if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Kirara x Minamin confirmed.</br>  <br><br>She learned from the best.</br></br>  <br>But the spoilers say it's actually Kirara x Towa. I'm confused.</br>  <br>Kirara aint no one-woman gal.</br>   lez-baba   <br>Thank you for posting my favorite GoPri daily.</br>  What would you teach Towa in modern world?   no elf jokes pls   <br>sex</br>  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside.</br>  <br><br>Do you think that they don't know how to make love in Hope kingdom?</br></br>  <br>camwhoring</br>  Wow was there ever a lot of bile during the livewatch.  <br>I mean. Maybe.<br><br>Towa and Kanata are clearly from different parents. Maybe they were adopted from a neighboring kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing I missed it then.</br>  <br>I guess it's the one time of week there's a real risk of it looking like /a/ in here.</br>  <br>Don't kid yourself. This shithole isn't any better than /a/.</br>  <br>I strongly disagree.</br>  <br>you were probably one of those douchebags stinking up the thread last night, weren't you</br>    <br>Why are suffering Precure so arousing?</br>  <br>Because you are bad person</br>    <br>It's okay, anon. I'm a bad person too. Let's just stay inside and make sure society doesn't have to deal with us too much before we die, okay?</br>    <br>gross</br>    <br><br><br>Shut up, nerd.</br></br></br>  <br>Lots of All Star stuff, just things between the Cures of various series.</br>  <br>Good thing I was there to fight the shitposters.</br>    <br>I like how most of those fairy dolls are about the actual size they would be save for Sharuru who voices Haru Haru.<br><br>How much for a sloppy one with that make-up on?</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to fuck that cardboard cutout of Cure Honey.</br>  <br>I really miss when Hime was the star of HaCha</br>  <br>Hime did everything wrong and was undeserving as a main character. Why would you open the box of all evil?</br>  <br>We all do, anon. I think maybe she charged my happiness too much and broke it so now it's leaking all the time and making me sad.</br>  <br><br>I really want to fuck that Towa kig.</br></br>    <br>Hah. I totally see it.

Power of all*! Precure Eclair Espoir!). <br> If you put the individual dress-up keys (sold separately) in the center, the respective finishing move voice plays. <br> 8 game modes to play with the music, the keys and the other toys (perfumes, crystal rods, violin). <br><br>*I'm aware this sounds rather horrible in English, but that's literally what it says, it's not "the power of us 4", or "the power of everyone", it's literally "the power of everything/all"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruharu a cutest pink!<br><br>I like this kind of thing, art of civ form and cure forms together.</br></br></br>  <br>Improved?

Also Waikyou Shenshoujing has a pretty nice route too.</br>  Where's radiant force  <br>It's the screen that comes up while it's loading the song before you actually start.</br>  <br/>  <br>I don't understand this meme.</br>  <br>Is that from the first one? Or maybe my install is fucked since I see nothing but a white box while the song is loading.</br>  <br>Yeah, first game.</br>  <br>NO I WANT IT NOW</br>  <br> that pic <br>I don't know what's going on, but I think I like it.</br></br>  <br>Opposite day.</br>  <br>Hotblooded Miku would be pretty great.</br>  <br>Initially, Iguchi was supposed to voice Hibiki.</br>    <br>I want to suck Miku's honorary member.</br>  <br>She's the most breedable geah.</br>  <br>Then get ready to be cucked by the sakimori </br>  <br> Not being able to self insert into either of them </br>  Is it just me or the sound quality on G-Beat kind of awful?  <br>Just you.</br>  I-I'm evil guys, seriously.<br><br>Stop laughing at me!</br></br>  <br> cucked <br>Stop this shit nigga, there's an /a/ equivalent that was used long before this meme became a thing.</br></br>  <br>Carol if your alchemy is so great, why didn't you revive your father?</br>  <br>I want to invade Carol's privacy when she's in the bath.</br>  Why is alpha Maria so hot?  <br>Alchemists never learn. Fists and swords will always prevail in the end.</br>  <br>That's why she has the throne and impractically large hat, isn't it? She's trying to compensate for looking like a little girl.</br>  <br>If you mean the tv version the CD is glorious.</br>  <br>I want to kneel before her throne, so I can look at her pantsu.</br>   "why didnt I get any inheritance! At least that bitch got a quest to destroy the world" <br>Classic bikkie</br>  <br>Is there a rule somewhere that says Alchemists have to look cute as fuck?</br>  <br><br>pretty sure it's a /int/ meme from a gathering of English /int/ users looking to meet up at a bar. They all completely missed one another and the whole thing was autistic as fuck. Spaghetti everywhere.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's like a frilled neck lizard or some other animal that makes itself look big.</br>  <br>They fix their broken faces with alchemy like witches</br>  <br>Isn't it a /fit/ thing? One guy posted pics of ass, another guy said "please be in london"<br><br>Turns out it was a trap.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it from /fit/?</br>  Why Little Miracle -Grip It Tight- is so good?<br>Reading the letter while listening to the song almost made me tear up.<br>It can be the best Hibiki song as for now, it is the one that has most emotion in.</br></br>  <br>Usually I don't like her clean versions that much since they are not as hotblooded as the ones used in the show but damn I fucking love this one</br>  <br>Bikki your father is probably still alive in Thailand fucking cute lady boys.<br><br>Dying Wishes don't come from people who are alive</br></br></br>  <br>Really lad?<br>The meme goes like this: if someone is or posts a picture of a girl/feminine man, you might say something like "please be in london" or "please be in san francisco"<br>This is eventually simplified into just typing the name of the city eg. L O N D O N<br>This means that typing london in capitals implies the post it replies to is in some way attractive as a girlfriend<br>It originates from /sp/ and /int/, the patrician's choice in meme boards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>my bad, I always associated it with some screenshot from /int/ which used it. In retrospect, I guess they were referring to the /fit/ thing in that thread which is where I got my wires crossed.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought /tv/ was the meme board</br>  <br>It's from /fit/ where a tripfag thought a dude posting was a girl and said pls be in London. It's old as fuck.</br>  <br>Oh no a lost child!<br><br>Every board is a meme board apart from the ones you go on.</br></br></br>  <br>/tv/ is the forced meme board.</br>   previews only come out a few hours before the next episode <br>Still hurts but at least there's a non-stop hype build-up before the show.</br>  <br>/tv/ has only a single meme that is popular on other boards, which is admittedly the strongest meme (killed at least 250 people so far) but boards like /int/, /sp/ and /fit/ have more widespread memes such as LONDON or the nation of sweden.</br>  <br><br>Symphogear has almost reached the point where it's in perpetual hype. If you could generate power from Symphogeah hype, you could power a nation. Honestly? We're just getting started, wait until the drama kicks in proper. We're in for a ride and come the last three episodes we're probably going to break our post limit records.</br></br>  <br>Did it kill more? I only knew it killed 150 from the crash with no survivors.</br>  I didn't know I was watching Kamen Rider Ryuki  <br>I can't wait honestly. Even if I was a bit disappointed with Ep2, I'm looking forward to the next episode and onwards</br>  <br> radio show, then the previews, the actual episode and then waiting for subs <br>Endless ejaculation.</br></br>  I want to see Genjuro kick some doll ass.  Did ogawa shoot the bullets out of the air?<br><br><br> nolan's dignity </br></br></br>  <br>You've been watching Kamen Rider the entire time, you just haven't noticed.<br><br>Symphogear can technically go on forever because there's a ton of different magics and artifacts around the world.</br></br></br>  <br>He shot their shadows.</br>  Question, what song is playing during the shuttle scene in the first episode?  <br> Reminder that Ogawa-san is the MC.  <br>Is Symphogear actually a harem series??</br></br>  <br> Even the courage not to cry or the [courage] to stand <br> Can become love worth crying over <br><br>guys I am scared</br></br></br></br>  Will Genjuro take the role of Hibiki's daddy?  <br><br>Following a similar pattern to season 2 to be honest. Expecting shit to keep up with the first episodes quality was always unrealistic.<br><br>Episode 2 was alright, it expanded on a few things and did some symmetry with last season (a villain telling Hibiki that she couldn't possibly understand her pain, and Hibiki hinting that she understands their pain all too well).<br><br>I expect we'll have ups and downs as always, with at least one fucking amazing moment, lots of forced drama, plenty of good moments to balance it out and generally just a crazy ride.<br><br>Not sure they can top Ver silly faces for villain tropes though. Ver silly faces made all the dark moments fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that one fucker that didnt believe when I said it was release already</br>  <br> forced drama <br>Anon please. <br><br>But yeah I expect to have lots of ups and downs. Hopefully it tops season 2 and maybe 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>RADIANT FORCE</br>  <br>To continue the alcohol fueled sexual abuse? No thanks.</br>  <br> lots of forced drama <br>Anon....</br></br>  If the big bad is not Hibiki's father I will eat my sweaty socks.  I know I'm late, but we're Symphogear A's now, right? It's always fun when the good guys get to steal enemy tech when it's usually the other way around.  <br>Right before he sacrifices himself to Dainsleif so that Hibiki doesn't die after using it.</br>  <br><br> denying forced drama. <br><br>Come on, Anon. Don't tell me you forgot the whole episode 7 bullshit from the first series? You know where Miku just decided Hibiki keeping state secrets about saving people was enough to throw her friendship away.<br><br>I love symphogear but sometimes they contrive shit for the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do Ver shitters always have the worst opinions?

I wanted someone to hold... <br> Somebody's large hands to praise me (It's okay) </br></br>  <br> It's just the songs that are wrong. <br><br>What is the main point to Symphogear?</br></br></br>  <br>I am so happy this didn't turn into symphogear strikers</br>  <br>What? That has been an integral part of Miku's characterization. She regrets Hibiki having to fight.</br>  <br>Forced drama is still a meaningless buzzword that can mean anything. <br>I thought that was an annoying moment too, but they're teenage girls and it was part of Miku's character.</br></br>  I like this sex hair doll.  <br>Yeah, I totally wouldn't mind if we got a new cast next season if the story with the ones we have now ends satisfyingly enough. Then when we get enough geahs we could get a big crossever.</br>  Did she escape from the Strike Witches universe?  I want the Noise to show up and fuck up these fake Noise.  <br>Commie best fansub group</br>  <br> Hibiki and the new girl have the same father <br>Nope, Hibiki's father is a bum, not an alchemist. He left because he got bullied at work until he quit. <br><br> Chris will use the naked loli's new weapon and have implied yuri with her <br>No, she will be Chris' imouto. <br><br> Tsubasa will become useless like Maria so they can sympathize and have more development with each other <br>No, Maria will become useful like Tsubasa so they can princess carry each other. At the end they'll announce they're going to tour America for a while.<br><br><br> Kirika and Shirabe will save the day half the time <br>No, they will have to argue their way into fighting again.<br><br> Genjuro will also do something awesome at some point <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127974588#p127978723">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is harem actually a genre for those with patrician taste?
