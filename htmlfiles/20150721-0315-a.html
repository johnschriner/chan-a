I ended up liking fucking Nao more than you, in the end.<br> Sora's main competition <br> Bows out gracefully <br> Defends the twins relationship to Kozue <br>Maybe some megane's aren't totally bad</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the VN, she helps Haru realize he needs to love Sora.</br>  <br>being this guy must have been one hell of an experience</br>  <br>If Nao had ended up winning due to Sora giving in to an illness or some shit, i think I would have been okay with it.<br> Not like I would have been truly okay with something that kills the imouto off, again. I had enough of that shit with fucking Kana Imouto </br></br>  <br>honestly if it werent for my mother's meals and proximity to college i would've moved out too</br>    <br> They couldn't go full blood related back around the time Kana was made. I got mad enough to knock shit over around my room when they revealed that NBR shit. I just pretend it didn't happen. </br>  <br>KI was my first VN ever, and fuck me, i was wholey unprepared for the fuckign suffering I was about to experience.<br> ending's come around <br> MFW there is actually no happy ending, in the single ending where Kana survives, she drops you and leaves on her own </br></br></br>  <br>rip ped </br>  <br>recursiveFixPoint.jpg</br>  <br> Finds Haru's phone in his desk <br> Goes to his house to return it <br> Hears strange noises that sound suspiciously like a little sister squeaking her brother's name in ecstasy <br> Flips her shit, opens the door without being invited  <br>fuckin rude as fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> OHB is a true hero. <br>who?</br></br>  How do I get my onee-san to sleep with me?  <br>Seeing her so bootyblasted in the anime was hilarious. A shame it's anime original and she ends up being ok with incest in the VN.</br>  <br> incestfags will try to deny this </br>  <br> not knowing based OHB <br>There are actually a few anons running around that did something about their infatuation with their sister. We had car accident anon run away with her across the country, but we never heard from Ring-pop anon again. Kind of sad.<br>Pic related is ring-pop anon<br>Link is OHB's story<br>http://pastebin.com/90nWJGPt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was the result of multiple generations of incest, scrub.</br>  <br>Wait, last I heard about the car accident anon was he didn't know what to do. He ran away with her?</br>  Inchou a best.<br><br>Haruka na Sora is better simply by having her route.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. They beat feet across the country when she was well enough, and started a new life somewhere far away from everyone they knew. Wish i had saved the thread.</br>  <br>Holy shit, I need to read this.</br>  <br> each point for incest is basically a rewording of every point <br> incestfags can't be this delusional </br></br>    <br>fuck off normalfag</br>  <br> no matter what version it's in, Sora just doesn't give any fucks when they get caught <br>Fucking 10/10 waifu, shame she's only Harusexual</br></br>  <br>That scene had such trippy music and Haru's mind just shattering at what is happening. Good thing Nao was there to snap him out.</br>  <br> friend leaves their phone behind <br> bring it to their house <br> enter out of concern after hearing someone scream instead of running off <br> "rude" </br></br></br></br>  <br>She clearly knew what was going on from the look on her face, but, unlike Nao, she hadn't been considering the possibility of the twins fucking, so she flips her shit.<br>And Sora wasn't really screaming, she was moaning really loudly.</br></br>  <br> walking in on someone when it's obvious they're fucking <br><br><br>You'd make a shitty friend</br></br></br></br>  <br>How did Haruka Na Sora end? I heard something about marriage between the twins, and new routes for Kozue and the christmas cake.</br>  <br><br>Seeing these two side-by-side is actually really creepy.</br></br>  You can say whatever you want about YNS, but fuck me, the anime had fucking god tier music. Bruno Wen-Li shone like a fucking star here<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lJh<wbr>i8tX-RP4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'm looking very hard in the archive but no luck yet.</br>  Reminder that big sisters are made for big love  <br>last time i checked that wasnt true</br>  <br>A scream of ecstasy and a scream of pain can sound rather similar, you know. Weigh the pros and cons:<br> Friend is hurt <br>You've saved their life like a bro.<br> Friend is fucking <br>"Sorry man."<br>"No worries."<br>Leave. No harm done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>onee sans are always used goods though</br>     you will never discover your imouto touching herself while softly squeaking your name <br>Why even live</br>  <br>And yet they're still the best</br>  <br> Haru masturbating to Sora masturbating to him <br>We must go DEEPER.</br></br>  <br>He definately had the opportunity, but instead he fagged out and almost threw up.</br>  <br><br><br>Is the anime version worth the time or is this one of those VN or nothing type scenarios?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime is pretty solid. The final arc is fairly rushed, but overall it's a good watch. And pay attention to the music, it's fucking amazing.</br>  <br><br>God created only 2 people<br>We are the product of incest<br>Incest is bad <br>Let's kill God</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both worth watching as the scenario is different enough to warrant seeing both.</br>  <br>The anime is omnibus like Amagami so if you just want to watch Sora's route it's only like 4 episodes.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks, I'll start with the anime then jump into the VN after Grisaia</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Sorry man." <br> "No worries." <br>Except we're talking about women, and that's not how it went down at all.</br></br></br>  <br>That was such a bittersweet VN. I hated that I loved every heartwrenching moment of it.</br>  <br>But they would only have X chromosomes...<br>So there would only be gir-<br>Well. Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless the friend is catching you in the midst of delivering the fuck to your sister. And if the friend is in love with you, and, unlike the other friend who came with her, has no idea of what you two are doing.<br>I like how Nao was just "ehh. Guess i lose. Good luck"</br></br>  <br> ring-pop </br>  <br>Bad genes, don't try blaming it on incest.</br>    <br>best girl</br>  <br>That's not true at all and you don't have a single fact to support it.</br>  <br>  reading OHB story with  music link </br>  <br><br>Read the manga too, all three mediums are different enough to warrant seeing.<br><br>Akira is practically psychic yo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  You can actually get your girlfriend to call you onii-chan <br>that's a big pro</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously, this scene was great in the VN and manga, sad it was cut from the anime.</br></br>    <br><br>The one major problem with the manga is that the TL needed a bit of editing because typos are fairly frequent.</br></br>      <br><br>Psychic shrine maidens with a psychic cat, that shrine is magic.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128320450 <br>Can second this experience.

Got a job, got games, got animu, content in being alone, but then these fucks come in and remind me of shit Im missing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Westermark <br><br>Westermark effect wouldn't even apply in Yosuga no Sora as they were separated in childhood.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128333728 <br> This is /a/.

Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Westermarck effect doesn't ever apply because it's bull.</br>    <br>Even gay incest?</br>  <br>Man and woman, siblings only.  Disgusting homo shit </br>  <br> Mutant Babies <br><br>This only happens if your family have the recessive genes that cause things like down syndrome or other disabilities.<br><br>Obviously you and your sister have a very high chance of sharing these genes, being blood related and all, so you have a high chance of ending up with a fucked up kid.<br><br>However if you don't have those genes everything is completely fine barring random mutation which takes many millions of births to even occur.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't even understand what the fuck happened in he latter portion of this series...</br>  <br><br>Stealth yandere is what happened and proof that the Megane is shit unless she is Nao.</br></br>  <br> if this imouto don't calm down I swear to God I'm gonna purify the fuck outta her </br>  <br> b-but Megane isn't shit <br> Megane attempts to destroy a Modulus which aren't even in production anymore <br><br>Fuck Megane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No need to be so rude, straightfag</br>  <br>Your faggot shit reminds me that my Imouto was a fujoshit too.</br>  <br><br>These anti-piracy ads are getting pretty serious yo</br></br>  <br>Imoutos are serious business.</br>  <br><br>Go smoke some more weeds Kozue.</br></br>  <br>NOKIA</br>  is incest punished with death sentence in some countries?  <br><br>Name of the band is giving a big hint.</br></br>  <br>I believe so.</br>  <br>I certainly hope so!</br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br>That's not a very nice thing to say.</br>    <br>In Germany, at least, it only counts as "real" incest (and thus prison time) if you have penis-in-vagina sex. As long as you and your sister stick to oral sex and anal, you're OK. In the same vein, homosex incest does not count as real incest and is not punishable by law.</br>  <br>I don't feel like taking a screenshot just to prove you're wrong.  Trying to find car accident anon saying he fled with his sister in the archive has drained me  Have a Kirino.</br>  <br>Isn't she his cousin?</br>  <br> states <br> countries <br>Pick one retard</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm American and I think you're a douchebag for thinking America is the only place on Earth.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but 2D.</br>  <br> Parents get no potential grandchildren/continuation of legacy <br> Flips the bird to human history and all the men whom helped build it. <br><br>2D or Not, yuri incest is scumtime as FUCK.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought you guys recently decriminalised sibling incest.</br>    <br>No, the government's ethics committee recommended that. Doesn't mean the govt has to listen to them.</br>  <br><br> Pick one retard <br><br>I picked one already you illiterate shittard.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Posting that flag is now considered a terrorist act anon, we are taking a cue from the Germans and are now pretending that the less savory parts of our past never occurred and we are blaming all bad things on a flag.</br></br>  <br>What if science babies are an option?</br>  <br>I'm really growing tired of this world and what it has done to my Imouto.</br>  <br><br>What did the world do to Kirino? Her series is over and barring whatshisface going back to it there's nothing anyone can do to ruin it.</br></br>  <br>I worry about this sometimes, I worry that the author will go back and ruin their ending.</br>  <br>If anything he'll make it even better.</br>  <br>Sequels have a tendency to spoil everything.</br>  <br>And most cases those who are incestfags doesn't even have siblings.</br>  <br>But I have an onee-san and  she knows I'm a siscon </br>  It is getting a little old to be honest. Kind of loses its taboo appeal when it seemingly gets shoved into everything.  <br>I disagree, that's like saying maids and miko are getting old and tired.</br>  <br> 3D sister not dead last <br>Looks like you don't have one, do you?</br></br>   Hearing Haru walks by her room. <br> Turn on the lights. <br> Do it loud. <br> Calling out his name. <br><br>Sora is pretty crafty in her own arc, Isn't she?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pick one retard <br><br>Okay. I pick you.</br></br></br>  <br>Is everyone with a mother/father complex also an orphan?</br>  sweeeet i like incest vns and doujin, but not any anime, so im not a degenerate  <br> Yosuga no Sora <br>wait this isn't /e/</br></br>  <br><br>Shhhh...anon. Not too loud.</br></br>  <br> mfw still having more webms </br>  <br>Well, I'm sold.</br>  <br>How'd she take it?<br><br>So that's the last from Ring-pop? I hope he made it and started living the good life.</br></br></br>    <br>  you are degenerate. <br><br>/pol/ on everything.<br>The day /pol/tards are removed from /a/ will be a great day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I say we remove a politics board all together and add a religion board to contain christfags</br>  <br><br>I somehow feel that the lesbian side of it is more degenerate than the incest part.</br></br>  <br> made it clear in subtle and indirect ways that she knows and does not feel the same, but she doesn't if I wrap my arms around her and rest my head on her shoulder</br>  <br>Anyone have a screencap of that one /a/non who impregnated his older sister?</br>  <br> Haven't watched a show <br> Lurk more <br>I don't think you know what that means</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's probably the best outcome if you got rejected. At least you can still act like bro and sis.</br>  <br>What. I have a visceral need for this now.</br>  <br>Sorry anon I lost my screencap when my hard drive got fried but I hope someone else has it</br>   incest is bad <br>Because we should have the right to tell consenting adults what they can and cannot do<br>Being human is suffering</br></br>  It's so fucking stupid that people try to police who I can and can't fuck. If I want to fuck my sister, and she wants to fuck me, then why should you care? My motto is, if you aren't killing, destroying peoples shit, stealing or raping, do what the fuck you want.  <br>No, you're the one that doesn't know what it means faggot. Saying &gt;hur dur just because I didn't know who Lelouch was because I haven't seen Code Geass doesn't mean I'm a newfag, is bullshit. It's common knowledge, you'd have to be new as fuck to not know who Lelouch is, and in the same capacity you'd have to be new as fuck to not know Satsuki and Ryuko are sisters. It's common knowledge because it's absolutely everywhere<br><br>Fuck off and lurk moar fag.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fundamentally right attitude, but you might fall prey to viewing things in way too simplistic ways.<br><br>Some things can be very indirectly harmful. (I'm not implying that incest is one of these.)<br><br>Sometimes so indirect that the only link is the fact that you contribute to a culture-wide mentality which harms some people you never knew existed, or harms them in such a way that even they themselves think is normal and acceptable (because they're also living in the same culture) so even they don't speak up themselves. For example this is the case with cultures that see sex as something inherently aggressive and such, calling it "fucking" etc., thinking that penetration defines sex. Women enjoy clitoral stimulation most, not sex. A very large number of women can't regularly orgasm from sex, because they and their partner both have no fucking idea what they're doing and think the woman should reach orgasm from being ruthlessly penetrated.<br><br>A less indirect example is /a/'s constant half-joking glorification of rapist attitudes, especially towards little girls. Recently some idiot in a loli thread suddenly started talking about how he'd like to fuck his 9 year-old sister. No matter how many people yell "2D only!" it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill <br> Common knowledge <br>When did shit series become common knowledge, anon?</br></br></br>  <br> it won't keep these people from taking part in these threads and feeling like their behavior is being endorsed and cherished. <br><br>Fucking this. The "darkest corner of the internet" that is the 4chinz laughed and ridiculed other peoples' closet homosexuality, pedophilia, and autism. You used to expose your own retardation for other people to laugh at. And you would do the same for others. Now, it's become a hugbox and anyone who has a disagreeable attitude toward their "muhwaifu" and "muhloli" circlejerking is branded as a "normie". <br><br>Ironically, the loli fetish is becoming one of the most casual fetishes out there with an astounding number of tags in most boorus. And your average kid on LoL talks about having Janna as his "waifu". The average /a/utist is the true normie with an elitist facade. Fucking disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe when it aired and there were five threads for it at any given time?</br>  <br>The motto is for most situations, I don't have a particular ideology so I take social issues one at a time to form an opinion about. I can't put every single thing I have an opinion on in one motto, anon, that would be silly.</br>  <br>So you visit shit threads?</br>  <br>The only things that get spoilers are new events in the source materials, and info in the shows on simulcast. Spoilers aren't used that much because if you really don't want something spoiled you will watch said anime and not be on /a/. If you want to avoid spoilers don't go on /a/</br>  <br>mom x daughter incest is the purest form of love</br>  <br>I visit /a/, that's my point. You'd have to be deaf, dumb (and I don't mean mute either), and blind to not know these things.<br>lurk<br>moar</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like Kill la Kill and never visited threads. It's not like OP has always unavoidable spoilers. The fact you think shit series is so impactful everyone on /a/ should know it makes clear you have shit taste, and makes me very sad.</br>  Did you ever confess to your sister, /a/?  <br>I wish I could anon, but if I did and she said no I would probably kill myself, not even joking.</br>  <br>are you actually in love with your sister</br>  <br>I don't have a sister ;__;</br>  <br>No sister. I like incest as a fetish and have no compunctions against it in real life but I'm not feeling anything towards any of my relatives.</br>  <br>I wish I knew how to help.</br>  it's fine if it isn't vaginal<br>or atleast in germany it is.</br>   love my nee-san <br> confess to her <br> calmly states "Not with me." and leaves <br> pretends it never happened the next day <br>I guess that's the second best outcome you can hope for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I don't really know, I've never really loved anyone that I've dated, they've all been shallow and I think I only go out with most girls I do out of my desperate fear of being lonely. I know that I love my sister in a brotherly way and I care about her a lot, so maybe I'm mistaking regular brotherly love with romantic feelings.<br><br><br>It's okay, I'm beyond the point where I can be helped now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Ririko isn't canon </br>  <br> dated <br>get out normie</br></br>  <br> Brotherzoned <br>Sorry to here that anon.</br></br>  <br>It's the purest form of giving me a boner</br>  <br>If you don't like koikishi purely kiss episode 2, then you are confirmed homosexual. Regardless of stance on incest.</br>  <br>No, you.</br>  <br>I can't believe I read the entire pastebin<br>Was kind of nice story, somewhat wrecking to read as a neckbeard in a world where love is reserved for objectively better people.</br></br>  <br>Should've done it 7 years ago as it is far too late now.</br>  I watched pic related with my younger sister once neither of us realizing what it was. We only got thru episode 1.  <br>you blew your chance faggot</br>  <br>Better than that poor anon who got kicked out of his onee-san's house who he was living with and eventually she forgave him.  I wonder if he raped her afterwards. </br>  Incest? Yes, i like it. <br>The purest form of love.</br>  <br>thanks for reminding me of something i will never experience<br>those stories are beautiful</br></br>  <br>Now stop posting.</br>  <br>I'm sorry your sister is so fucking ugly. Mine is quite beautiful, so like any sane person I masturbate to her regularly.</br>  <br>What makes it pure?</br>  <br>I've never actually seen Raildex.. is this something he consistently says in almost every episode, or is this just some meme?</br>  <br>I can only vow for twincest, but it's the fact that it's a love between the closest people that loved each other since birth and not polluted by social standards (in fact it goes against it).</br>  <br> not polluted by social standards <br>Tip your fedora harder, please.</br></br>  <br>im autistic and my parents arent siblings<br>checkmate atheists</br></br>  <br>In what sense? And are we still talking about anime on /a/ or real life?</br>  My big sister was my first kiss. She'd always been incredibly affectionate when she was drunk, cuddling on to me and cooing, "You know how much I love you, right? You know how much I love my little brother." One of these times she pecked me on the lips. I followed her and we ended up making out on the couch for half an hour. I was 14, she was 23.<br><br>Easily the hottest and most heartpounding moment of my life. If I'd been braver I might have made something of it. She's married with a kid now, so I lost my chance. I still masturbate thinking about it.</br></br>  <br>There'a nothing wrong with social standards you degenerate fuck.

Not close to all of it of couse.<br><br>People do choose others based on their social standing, money, popularity, how attractive the person is in the general standard instead of going through what would make you, as an individual, happy.</br></br></br>  <br> it's a human "creation" after all <br>KEK<br><br>read the bible sometime, kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There'a nothing wrong with social standards <br><br><br>2/10 bait harder</br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't the right place to talk about it, but I don't believe anyone is 100% beyond help.</br>  <br> sister is really pretty growing up <br> only 5'4 <br> she gets to about 13-14 years old <br> grows enormous titties <br> D cups <br>They can't all be perfect I suppose</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not that anon, but social standards have usually not formed out of ass to harass and confine people. Stop being edgemaster.</br>  If you put ketchup on eggs you are a degenerate.<br><br>If you eat natto you are a degenerate.<br><br>If you prefer strawberry panties over striped panties you are a degenerate.<br><br>If you eat rocky road ice cream you are a degenerate.<br><br>If you drink non-American beer you are a degenerate.<br><br>If you're left-handed you are a degenerate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this isn't the place but it still felt good to get that little bit off my chest anyways, there's no /inc/ board for me to post about my sister so I don't really have an anonymous way to talk about it.</br>  Where can i find a 100% save for the Yosuga No Sora VN? I don't want to waste time on the other routes and it looks like im locked out of the imouto route until i do so.  <br> normie reaction image <br>Why am I not surprised?<br><br>You're the kind of sheep who would have gladly burned Jews in 1940 Germany, shot blacks and gays in 1950 Murrica, and would sell his 12 year-old daughter to a 50 year-old fuck in 2015 Saudi Arabia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> People do choose others based on their social standing, money, popularity, how attractive the person is in the general standard instead of going through what would make you, as an individual, happy <br><br>You have very sad outlook on life. Not only do you try to preach about how life, happiness and love work despite being very subjective, you also have most likely formed these opinions detached from society, believing a computer in your mom's basement gives you superior analytical sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you'd feel better jerking off with the rest of the non-conformist degenerates on Reddit?</br>  <br> not formed out of ass to harass and confine people <br>Neither it did to help people find happiness. And it does comes from a time when segregation was indeed the standard, and it was the faith and not science that decided the rules.</br></br>  <br> reddit <br> non-conformist <br>Since you equate "non-conformist" with "edgy," I guess I should have expected this level of idiocy from you.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that "degeneracy" is a kafkatrap fallacy.<br><br>http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122<br><br><br> I don't have an argument so I'll just insult him </br></br></br></br></br>    When will we return to the days of degeneracy being celebrated on 4chan?  <br>It seems you believe things can be perceived as black and white. When we are talking about society and rules, I bet you think Nazi Germany and oppression. On the other hand, society and norms are necessary for modern life, and the reason why you comfortably sit posting on your computer.<br><br>Very existence of society makes it possible for people to find happiness. Granted, happiness could most likely be found in a different environment, but so far human history has not reached these environments, as lack of order has mostly caused said oppression and instability.<br><br>Saying happiness cannot exist under rules and norms is ridiculous, even though you don't have firsthand experience of said happiness.<br><br><br>Yeah, it goes both ways. The fact you have not found happiness does not mean the happiness doesn't exist. I think it is ridiculous to classify modern life and relationships existing only for benefit. Right now you are stating "happiness does not exist because I say so".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Crossboarding scum please leave.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well. If you can't figure it out on your own, then find the person you trust the most and seek advice. Be totally honest. Include the weird incest and suicidal bits. Work through it togther. You can figure it out.</br>  Itt: overrated anime<br>I'll start<br> felt like a poor man's dumbed down version of evangelion </br></br>   felt like a poor man's dumbed down version of Utena   when people get so defensive about this I cant help but wonder how albino they are from sun deprivation.

Fula fula was so good.<br> How does this season stack up against the past 4 seasons? <br>Nothing stands out and last season was a little more entertaining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JwWw OP is growing on me, but yeah Soma's first ED was too good to be topped</br>  <br> Watching <br>Gangsta, Charlotte, Rokka No Yuusha, Bikini Warriors, Okusama Ga Seitokaichou, Classroom Crisis, Ninja Slayer if you count leftovers<br> Favorite Show <br>Gangsta, most interesting so far<br> Least Favorite <br>Shimoneta, not clever, unfunny, and generally stupid. I can't bring myself to drop it for some reason though.<br> Dropped <br>Prison School and Monster Musume until BDs. Does anyone know if Triage X BDs are out? I've put that on hold because of censorship as well.<br> Picked up because of /a/ <br>I'm considering the show with the trap with the nice butt, but if the premise is boring I may put it down again.<br> Best Girl <br>Wakana Ui, Nancy Lee<br> Worst Girl <br>Kajo Ayame, hot, but the humor of a grade school student thinking crass humor is 'cool'<br> Best OP <br>Nothing worth mentioning yet<br> Worst OP <br>Gangsta, besides the hot girls<br> Best ED <br>Shimoneta, the funky OST is my favorite aspect of this so far. The dancing is fun to look at too<br> Worst ED <br>Not sure yet<br> How does it stack up against past 4 seasons <br>I preferred them over this but this season isn't totally crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -What are you watching? <br>Akagami<br>Charlotte<br>Drrr<br>Gakkou<br>Gate<br>Imas CG<br>Jitsu wa<br>Joukamachi<br>NNB<br>Shokugeki<br>Sore ga Seiyuu<br>Umaru<br>Wakaba Girl<br>Working<br><br> -What is your favorite show so far? <br>Wakaba Girl<br><br> -What's your' least favorite show so far? <br>Classroom Crisis<br><br> -What have you already dropped? <br>Chaos Dragon, Classroom Crisis, Overlord, Rokka no Yuusha<br><br> -Did you pick up anything due to a thread on /a/?

Anime is coming out next season I'm pretty hyped  <br>Me too mate but I really want to know who's going to voice Saitama. Depending on who they choose it could be amazing.</br>  <br>Um.<br>They revealed who's voicing him like months ago. It's Makoto Furukawa.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. I hope not for a very very long time and it must be against the absurd last boss man of the anime when ONE decides to finish it.</br>  Are you expecting next chapter to be Metal Bat vs Senior Centipede &amp; flytrap monster, or tournament shenanigans?<br><br>I hope we get more Metal Bat, last chapter alone would feel like a pointless tease.</br></br>  God fucking damn it OP, actually thought 102 was out thanks to your damn thread.  <br>It would destroy the joke, thus the only way to do it is by the very end of the manga when the joke is not needed anymore.<br><br>My guess is he will get depowered somehow (maybe God does it?) and then has to fight with normal human strength. Of course he will somehow win but then decided to live a normal life again.

He likes to look on Kaworu's penis.<br>Asuka is in puberty and almost dead.<br>Rei is a puppet.<br>The Ending was horrible. Bad. I mean who were all the people and organizations?<br>There are soome episodes with showing minute long loops or even worse a picture for minutes...<br><br>Everything else was fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu's a multi-billion year old alien of questionable gender, so it's only kind of gay!<br><br>Shinji's definitely a cake eater, though. Only the oldest of cakes will do.</br></br></br>  <br>He's bisexual. Honestly, Shinji didn't seem to care for who he was intimate with, so long as someone expressed any inkling of love or affection to him he would be putty in there hands. <br><br>Plus I don't think a hardline homosexual male would jack off onto a comatose German girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah he was just desperate, he wanted Auska the whole time but she was only on Kaji's dick. Kaworu is an ugly creep, Shinji has better taste than that.</br>  <br>Why the fuck does it matter?<br>When you watch shit like Toradora you don't ask if Taiga is straight, do you?<br>The important thing is that Kaworu and Shinji loved eachother to the point where gender and sexuality were irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>since when did /a/ become /tumblr/</br></br>  <br>tumblr would be the last to say that whether a character is gay or not doesn't matter.</br>  <br> Kaworu is an ugly creep <br>Anon..</br></br>  <br>Reminder that bishie boy is actually an evangelion</br>  <br>I prefer his shota form.</br>  <br>No, and if you think Anno pulled a "deus ex gay" then you completely misread shinjis character. <br>  I bet you think he's a pussy who won't gitr too, right?  </br></br>  <br>He is ugly as shit man</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br><br>Anno himself is a gay</br></br>  <br>Anon..</br>  <br>This is correct.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tF3<wbr>c3SrgnAk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I don't know about that. I'm 100% gay and I'd beat off to a crippled Kraut bitch. Chicks in agony are turn-ons to me, it's what vile cunts like Asuka deserve.</br>  <br><br>Hate to break it to you but if you're attracted to a female in any context you're not 100% gay</br></br>  <br>Asuka looks like a man anyway</br>  <br>Almost every Child has the same face, but different hairstyle. Shinji and Asuka have the same face!</br>    <br>I'm sorry you have such poor taste</br>  <br>Anon..</br>  <br>Not even him but anon you might be fucking blind. Might want to get that checked out.</br>  <br> those eyelashes </br>  <br>Fujoshi are known to have bad taste.</br>  <br>I think you may be fucking blind to think that ugly muppet looks good<br>But hey I'm not into distressingly long yaoi chins and terrible hair</br></br>  <br><br> terrible hair </br></br>  <br> it looks like an electrified mop <br> he looks like a drug addict </br></br>  <br>Literally the ugliest "bishounen" ever. If you're gonna be a fag at least choose good looking boys.</br>  <br>Where is that pic from? Nadia looks nothing like Shinji in most of Sadamoto's art.</br>  <br>He's right though. What the fuck is that.</br>  <br><br>Anon..</br></br>  <br>He only looks weird in some pics like OP<br>Most of the time he's quite pretty, even some of the staff has said as such. Nip guys fucking love him too</br></br>  <br>They're just being closet faggots, they'll get over it eventually. Everyone else knows Kaworu a qt.</br>  <br>NO<br><br>STOP IT<br><br>OH MY GOD<br><br>Not because there's anything wrong with being gay, but because making a big deal out of being gay and having the entire story be some kind of gay thing is completely uninteresting compared to much, much better possibilities that are unrelated to being gay at all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not gay because Kaworu is a girl</br>  <br>He looks weird in all pics.<br> dude who designed him <br>Of course he ain't gonna admit he's ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess you're just baiting at this point, but whatever; I have an excuse to post Kaworu being sexy.</br>  <br> liking that frog face <br> telling others they have shit taste </br></br>  <br><br>his face really isn't sexy tbh but that's more an art style issue than his own fault</br></br>  <br>Is that a dead animal on his head</br>  <br> Kaworu <br> ugly  <br>Still going? Do you secretly want people to keep posting Kaworu pics? That's what it's starting to feel like here.</br></br></br>  <br> He only looks weird in some pics like OP <br>So like in 99% of this ayy lmao's appearances</br></br>  <br>At this point I'm convinced they just want us to post Kaworu so they can fap.</br>  Kaworu has no gender, fujoshits.  <br>Even better</br>  <br><br>igiari</br></br>   tfw no more Sabagebu!

Checked out the airsoft related show from this season. It's not particularly good or too funny but between the hotblooded MC and this dense fucker it has its moments.  <br>if the manga gets canceled it'd be because the manga is doing shit</br>  <br> all the girls have short hair <br>Is this some sort of fetish hybrid anime</br></br>  <br>I think it's still going on, but there's no one scanlating it right now.<br><br>Uh, anon, there's only one girl in that picture.</br></br></br>  <br>duuuuude what</br>      <br>She's in heaven now.</br>  <br>Subs literally never</br>  <br>Not proper subs but anon subs yes.</br>  <br>There are.
