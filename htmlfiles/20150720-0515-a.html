They sure did the MLs justice in the movie amirite? <br><br>I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  Unrelated to CG but I just want to say.<br><br>I love Makoto.</br></br>  So TakeP appeared on the second day of the 10th live.  <br> Side-M anime when <br><br>So WHEN is it?</br></br></br>  <br>I love saturated tumblr gifs</br>  <br><br>She is so perfect.</br></br>  <br>http://yaraon.blog109.fc2.com/<br><br>I'm looking but I'm not seeing.</br></br></br>  <br> I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds. <br>That's going to be funny.<br><br>But I have a feeling A-1 will get third time lucky.

Now it's just out of tradition.</br></br></br>  <br> That image is missing her 200/100 and 300/100 reactions <br> good. </br></br>  <br>Too bad</br>  <br> We wait for some years until she grows older. <br>No, it's best to declare your love for her as soon as possible to prevent her from being an exploited cog in the idol industry.</br></br>  <br>It's been pretty good so far.<br><br>The problem with CG is that it has no real established story or lore before the anime. The anime adapts a setting of the CG-verse that can do justice to details in the mobage and keeps things fresh. The anime differentiated CG to the point that it's no longer a clone of 765 except with different idols through a more corporate setting.<br><br>You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight. <br>Fuck, you got me.</br></br>  Now that Million Live anime is confirmed can we agree that CG was shit?  <br>CG and 2011 were shit. The only good iDOLM@STER anime is Puchimas.</br>  <br><br>Nope. CG and ML is shit. Puchimasu too. <br><br>Only good im@s is vanilla 765. Also, Side-M.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Love Live is better, you faggots</br></br></br>  <br>I like the CG anime, but mostly due to the backstage scenes<br><br>The second half is still just starting</br></br></br>  ML isn't even close to airing and the shitposting has already begun.<br>Can we just talk about cakes instead?</br>  <br> 2011 anime <br> not shit <br>Fuck of, quinternary.</br></br></br>   It's a penis. A penis!   <br>she then rams it up Miria's bum</br>   ML anime announced <br><br>wow~</br></br>  <br> can we agree that CG was shit? <br> was </br></br>  <br>Your shitty cake meme was never funny.<br> Now CG is obsolete just like its idols.</br></br>  <br>Source?

Literally half of the tweets with the 10th Live hashtag is about the ML anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  If you had to pick 7 ML idols for the ML anime to focus on who'd you pick? <br><br>My picks</br></br>  ML is literally the Love Live of idolm@ster  <br>Stop shitposting, Jal</br>  <br>Haruka, Chihaya, Miki, Iori, Yayoi, Yukiho, Makoto.</br>  <br> Megumi <br> Shiho <br> Kotoha <br> Konomi <br>Mah nigga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for the new /@/ threads here without all the CG cake retards.</br>  I better not be the only one who thinks CG character designs are 10x better than Original/ML.

Somebody just summarize things for me tommorow.</br></br>  <br>What does this even mean.</br>  million live anime confirmed!!<br>they showed the PV in the second live!!</br>  <br>ML designs &gt; CG designs.<br><br><br>Million Love will kill Love Live.

In all honesty, most likely. But is a ML anime confirmed? No, not yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I can't wait to see her genkiness.  Man, I really liked CG.  <br>Too bad for you, it's going to die now that ML's getting an anime.</br>  <br>I really liked CG threads.<br><br>I hope this shitposting isn't permanent.</br></br></br>  <br>I love CG too</br>  <br> it's going to die <br>More like the ML anime is an attempt to keep ML alive.<br>Million Live wishes it had the userbase that Mobamas does. Or that it generated nearly as much revenue.</br></br></br>  True Blue  <br>Why do so many people hate CG but love the 2011 Anime? They're both good but CG is clearly better.</br>  With ML anime is /@/ finally making a comeback?<br>I missed you guys.</br>  <br>/@/ goes in </br>  <br>2011 anime is a lot of people's introduction to iDOLM@STER. Just like how I have a soft spot for Ace Combat 6 DLC and the Live For You OVA, they'll have a soft spot for the 2011 anime.<br><br>Both have terrible animation outside of the concerts and a few select scenes every other episode. They're okay shows, though.</br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>It's just an animated PV. The actual anime announcement will probably come next year. <br><br><br>Vocal asspained people on 4chan doesn't exactly equate to "so many people". Both series had it's share of fans and haters.

A good fan of CG, if not Idolmaster in general, loves all types of idols.

All I can hope for is that the ML anime is planned properly so that it actually has animators. Deremas is such a disappointment visually compared to the original.  I want her to guest appear so badly. Who's a good seiyuu that can do cute Engrish?  <br>What?</br>   Ranko is so autistic she has to perform by herself because she couldn't function in a group <br><br>lol</br></br>  <br>She's actually really, really avant-garde. Just you all wait until traditional Japanese garb becomes chic. All the fashion mags will be like, "Tell us your secrets, Sae-sensei!" "Okay, minna-han."</br>  I want to see a mindbreak doujin where she goes insane after seeing too many copies of the album left on the shelves and then feverishly throws every single one in a basket and buys them all for like $2000 <br><br>eventually she'd kill herself too</br></br>  <br> lots of copies left <br> has to buy them <br> suffering <br>hasn't this already been implied at least twice for Dookie?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To whom are you referring?</br>    <br>The latest episode reveals that it was her Mom who bought the multiple copies seen in her house.<br><br>Uzuki buys a few CDs too, but she gives them away almost immediately.</br></br></br>  <br>MOAR</br>  <br><br>I messed up, this was meant to accompany my post. Gomenasai .</br></br>  <br>No. No lewd thoughts, please.</br>  <br>She's clearly asking for it</br>  <br>It doesn't show enough skin.

You know, the one where Yui died of an overdose.</br>    Happy Birthday to the WindSurfer Idol  Julia &gt; Natsuki.  <br>Hell yea<br><br>I disagree, but I respect your opinion</br></br></br>   seeing your favorite idol get animated and hearin her voice <br><br>It's like God appearing before you.</br></br>  <br>I'd use the SR+ I have of her if I was a passion P.</br>  <br>Which one is the ghost?</br>  <br>I use it anyway, she's got a decent attack and I lack good blue cards</br>  <br>10/10 would take to the festival</br>  <br>why is she so sexual</br>  <br>I got a whole crew of cool SR+ cards, so I don't really need it.

There were apparently two sets of PVs shown.<br><br>I'll be honest. I'm confused.</br></br>  <br>from /@/<br> The ML anime announcement is for a full blown anime. There were two separate announcements. They first crushed everyone's spirits by showing a really short clip of animation then announcing that it was for the new CD series, not an anime, then they showed a pv for an actual ML anime with a lot of different scenes. </br></br>  <br> actual ML anime with a lot of different scenes. <br>I want to fuck Shizuka.<br><br>But I hope for a lot of Minako</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need to see the ho hime animated.</br>  New episode is up.

Nao have reached the maximum level of irony, even higher than [s4s].  To be honest, I have mixed reactions from this episode, but leaning a little more towards negative. Everything that happened from the phone incident up to the confession scene was a deliberate excuse to force Yusa to transfer at Hoshinomi Academy, but Taka's antics were hilarious enough to save it for me. Here's hoping next week will get better, though.  <br> grown-ass man <br> being threatened by tiny nippon teens </br></br>  <br> grown-ass man <br> being threatened by tiny nippon teens <br> nippon teens with fucking super powers </br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the part where he got trucked into a wall by the megane kid?<br><br>Dude probably lost all feeling in his legs.</br></br></br>  The new smug Queen.      I WANT TO FUCK NAO  <br>You wouldn't be able to satisfy her.</br>  I am from the future. Imouto's power is the ability to make the most delicious food anyone has ever eaten.

How much will you cry when she inevitably dies/is transformed into a zombie after becoming a test subject, /a/?  <br><br>I'm sure the school also protects her. She'll be fine.</br></br>  I just wish this wasn't Key shit. You have such great potential in the main 3 characters, but it's all going to be tears and rage in about 2 weeks or so.  <br>who do you think will die, then?</br>  <br>She'll be okay. <br>There is no way Maeda could kill that cuteness.</br></br>  <br>Depends on how well they portray her suffering.</br>  <br>Anon pls, it's inevitable</br>  That scene where Nao's bro was being tested reminds me of that scene from "a clock-work orange" tbh  <br>How could you kill something that doesn't exist in the first place.</br>  <br>I think she'll end up referencing stars in her dying scene and it will last about half an episode<br><br><br>It's going to happen anon, you should start preparing yourself emotionally already ;_;<br><br><br>I didn't really get that vibe, but that's usually what they "pay homage" to in these kinds of scenes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128287280 <br>wtf are u doing</br>  <br>It's been summer since around 2011, get used to the heat.</br>  <br>she is a fucking bitch</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Ug<wbr>ebzq3juE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, I usually dislike that sort of stuff (because I've seen it 200 times already), but I'm finding this show really  fun  for some reason.</br>  <br>So I guess as long as the Yusa is alive, other members are able to come back and save the day even if they're killed.</br>  Has anyone decrypted those subliminal messages hidden in the OP?  <br><br>Kill yourself, yurifaggot.</br></br>  <br>the 1 ep because the MC was based but now he is just a background character</br>  <br>Wondering if this might be true. such as if their older brother/ whatever that was shown had the ability to create another "person" (imouto) at the cost of his own life fading away.</br>  <br>That ability can summon someone other than her sis too?</br>  <br>We'll have to wait for imouto to die to find out I guess.</br>  <br>Do you want to get yourself spoiled, anon?<br><br> Spoiler: the cutest girl dies in the end in a 20min death scene   probably the imouto </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe, they didn't say her ability only limited to her older sister.</br>  <br>If you mean the MC's imouto then it's fine. I don't give a shit about that annoying nano desu.</br>  <br>But Nao is the cutest.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, this episode was really poor and uninteresting compared to the last two. I think it's because they're deemphasizing Yuu as the protagonist and putting forth Nao. I suppose that they could want to get in her characterization early because she's the heroine and she's supposed to be affirmative to us, but honestly I don't even like her that much so far and I'm just waiting for her to melt into deredere like all Key heroines do.</br></br>  <br><br> cookie-cutter characters <br> none of the characters are actually copies of any other character or fit neatly into one stereotype <br><br>It's okay not to like the show, but don't be retarded.<br> inb4 hurr durr the mc is rurush </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was not believing it but after:<br> Omelette says "Nice things will happen!" <br> MC erases it <br>He is setting up the flags of his damn sister, now that is some evil shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  <br><br>Even though he could have her beat herself up, she could still just turn invisible and beat him back and since he wouldn't be able to see her, can't retaliate. The only option would be to make retaliation impossible, ever. Man, imagine if he'd decided to possess her when they were waiting in front of the train and he just had her jump out in front of it as it was pulling in.<br><br>Ah, but they're going to end up fucking sooner or later, so I guess such a scenario is pretty pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Raising a flag for Nao is troublesome and challenging, you should be able to understand her situation first and deal with her multiple personalities. If you can't, then she wouldn't open up to you.</br>  <br><br>Wow, shit, where'd that bishoujo come from? She looks way better.</br></br>  <br>I think you're safe then, anon. She probably won't die because her power is probably what they'll use to get tears out of us after the cute character dies</br>  Just started ep 1 and I'm at the halfway mark. It's so bizarre. It's like watching Code Geass on super fast speed. All of this confidence. All of this smug. Gone. What's so good about an anime if the trainwreck happens ep1?  Reminder that she does it with the dog  <br> Raising a flag for Nao is troublesome and challenging <br><br>You fuckin' with me? As far as Key heroines go, Nao is easy as fuck. You don't even know Lunatic Mode.</br></br></br>  <br>Impending suffering.</br>  Threadly reminder for evil scientists  <br><br>That's what a lot of viewers are asking, actually. Most people are waiting for Yuu to become based again. It's not even that he has to be an asshole, just that he has to be a sly motherfucker.</br></br>  This episode's ED sucks  <br>What? Akane was easy to capture because Kotarou was her bodyguard AND she knew him from the forest incident YEARS ago. Yuu is Nao's bitch at the moment, and he can't do shit. That's a huge difference.</br>  <br> sly <br><br>He was a total idiot. Anyone sly would have made sure to get scores less than perfect, especially when powers are apparently not kept in secret.</br></br></br>  <br>Why can't he use his powers, possess bulletnigga, and impale inviciblebitch down a hill?<br>Two birds one stone</br></br>  what a dick  <br> What if I actually got my head out of the gutter for five seconds? <br>You'd die.</br></br>  <br> easy to capture <br> laughing Kashima.jpg <br><br>Hope you like  living in The Zone from STALKER.   As long as its with Akane, I sure do. </br></br></br></br>   best girl is introduced <br> she's already dead </br>  <br> especially when powers are apparently not kept in secret. <br><br>Apparently most people simply don't know about the powers.<br><br><br><br>He was just embarrassed. It's not like he hurt her feelings or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Presumably because scientists might come to rape him afterwards.</br></br>  Is this show the Plastic Memories of Summer season?  <br>Imagine if he possessed her when she had to go to the bathroom and just let it go in her panties.</br>  <br> trainwreck happens ep1 <br>what trainwreck happened episode one? episode one was pretty much 100% of mc being based (really wish he didn't completely changed on episode 2)</br></br>  <br>No. MC was based until he got beat up by a girl. AND dumped like a little bitch. At least Code Geass managed it 12 episodes before that happened.</br>  <br>yeah, sort of. I'm finding this one kinda bearable (I didn't even got through the first Plastic Memories episode) because I'm not 100% sure of who will die and how it will be. I'm also liking the humor in it a lot more.<br><br><br>Oh, you're right. I forgot that happened in the first episode as well. He still was based for ~80% of the first episode, though</br></br></br></br>  Hope this will get better now that all the characters are introduced. MC has been boring for the last 2 episodes because the focus has been elsewhere. Once we start moving into whatever the actual plot of this thing is and the MC starts doing more than just blindly following Nao, I can see it maybe becoming something good.<br><br>I do like Nao though.</br></br>  This is new  If Misa possessing Yusa can still use pyrokinesis, that means powers are a function of the soul rather than one of the body and the genes, right? So why then is having a sibling with power make one more likely to also have power?  <br>Welcome to few days ago.</br>  <br><br>soul genetics</br></br>  <br>maybe souls are more similar withing family members, kinda like normal genetics<br><br> or maybe because anime </br></br></br>  <br>It's kinda funny that she only cares about the camcorder rather than getting rekt like that for once.</br>  <br>I was thinking it could be related to how humans use their brain</br>  <br>i'll ban her from the kitchen.</br>  <br>What if genes determine that you have one, but soul determines what you have? There's no conflict in that case.<br><br>But it would also mean the MC can't use somebody's power if he possesses them.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Of course, the MC so based. Sure, 100% agree with all of you.<br>He's very different and clearly not the same as those light novel adaptation where the MC got a good looks, a calculating mind, and wicked sense of humor.<br><br>definitely original, and not pandering, and cannot be self inserted, since he's not a beta faggot (based on /a/ said).<br>Pretty refreshing, if you likes all those NON-shitty LN adaptation, or NON-forced drama triangle love romcom, which is the best genre in chinese cartoon.<br><br>And this is the best MC because the personality and wicked sense of humor, and nihilistic really do like me, and the viewers. Definitely not pandering though, they just know what the viewers want.<br><br>Really based guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is he even the fucking MC at this point?</br>  Not a real PA Works Original...<br>When's my next Shirobako, Hanasaku Iroha, Tari Tari, Nagi no Asukara.<br><br>Glasslip was the only PA Works Original I hated</br></br></br>  <br><br>How so?<br><br>Nagi no Asukara was also a collaboration.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean all I said was that he's not doing fucking anything on his own in the last two episodes, which is pretty retarded for any character. In episode 1 he clearly had some kind of agency of his own and doesn't seem to right now. Nice strawman though.</br>  <br><br>i kinda got the impression it had to do with the neural makeup of the individual. i mean, having powers run in genetic pools doesnt mean they all have the same ones, right? just that they architecture for the brains are encoded genetically. so her being possessed, she takes on a different neural makeup. and yes, the way the brains set up is genetic. <br><br>then again that all sounds like a bit of a stretch. probs just the author fucking up, and not realizing until too late or ever.</br></br></br></br>  This is going to be shit because of it not being 2 cour and I am going to be very upset about it  <br>Indeed, it's probably KEY MAGIC</br>  <br>Give it some time, man. He's MC, he's bound to get some spotlight, in fact, he'll win the end game.  The sanicbro though, he'll get nothing. </br>  <br>Wait for the VN.</br>  <br>That was incredibly unsettling. Why the fuck was recording that dude so important when they basically just fucked him up anyway? I honestly don't think i've been more suspicious of a cast in any other show i've watched.</br>   all these side characters having heavily emotional moments shoved into the end of mediocre episodes this week <br><br>Japan pls stop teasing me</br></br>  <br>So it's Chaos;Head?</br>  <br> muh "everything needs two cour" <br><br>Literally a faggot. Im glad based Maeda decided to ignore such minority again. It means he will never acknowledge those fags that were crying about AB not being two cour.</br></br></br>  <br><br>ha rekt</br></br>  <br>Not everything needs 2 cour, but the majority of character driven series do.</br>  <br>Charlotte is not character driven though.</br>  <br><br>It's not too much to ask for an MC who has agency of his own and characteristics that are typically reserved for antagonists, even if he doesn't use them towards villainous ends, you know.</br></br>  <br>There are far more rushed one cour series than there are dragged out two cour series.</br>  <br>It definitely seems like it will be. The powers are tied to emotion and it has already shown a lot of emotional scenes.</br>  Who's the best PA Works protag? Hikky's got my vote!  <br>It's a KEY show, it will be character driven. Go raise your powerlevel, please.</br>  <br>The most popular and successful originals are one cour more often than not, probably because no one likes needless padding.</br>  <br>庶民 or I guess 俄か is better for the meaning you want.</br>  <br>That second word means "sudden," doesn't it?</br>  <br>she's recording to show to that trusted person, but of course she doesn't record when she's using her own powers.</br>  <br>When you hover over it, eh?<br><br>And yes, that's the original meaning, but nowadays it's a slang for a newfag pleb fan of something.</br></br></br>  What would you film if you could get to hold of Nao's camcorder?  <br>It's just a normal camcorder, so it would do the same thing my current one does and sit on a shelf untouched</br>  <br>my dick</br>  <br>People embarrassing themselves in public.</br>  It's all the fault of those unfortunate users of the MAL naofag fanatics, now they want to spread their delusions and hallucinations in other users<br>naofag are all retarded MAL users<br>Do not feed the troll tho MAL</br></br>  I knew coming here was a mistake.   hey if people find out about you they'll turn you into a lab rat <br> let's use our magic fucking powers in front of normals all day and night </br>  <br><br>Come back with Their delusions and hallucinations pro MAL his retarded.<br>anime Key<br>Written by Maeda<br>will turn Visual Novel.<br>The story always turned and emphasized in its protagonists.<br>Should be one of the last episodes que slut will have some prominence until it breaks, and support the protagonist of the stick, like all other key heroin, have certainty that he will only eat it once and discards, Yu does not like Tomboy, provavelmte it will end with Yusa is Best Quality anime girl.<br>MAL is trying to spread their delusions and hallucinations in other forums<br>certainty</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What choice do they have?

The last two episodes were fine, but nothing spectacular, then this episode was just a clusterfuck. We knew that red haired cunt for like half an episode, why even bother making an awkward confession if we don't care.<br><br>I hope that now that they got the main characters that it will get more focused. I'm trying hard to like this show.</br></br>  <br>The purpose of the confession was build Misa's character and to cut all ties to her past now that she "came back" thanks to Yusa. <br><br>Next time pay attention instead of complaining about every single detail, shithead. Or you can drop the show, literally no one will miss you in the threads.</br></br></br>  <br>I just hope that we're out of this "saving people from abusing magic" crap and move to the actual plot of the mystery albino guy and the comet plot which has been shoved to us from the start.</br>  Nao forgot to tell MC that when they lose their powers, they will turn into vegetables like her older brother. It had nothing to do with the experimentation.  <br>I can get that, but it seriously awkward how they did it. I mean, as soon as it became clear that he was gonna confess to her I had to pause the show. Having these emotional moments only works if we actually care, and I have no idea anything about these people since they had about 2 scenes together before it. It could have just as well been done with them saying goodbye, perhaps getting watery eyed. Not just confess then drop the character</br>  She has a recording fetish  <br>was meant for<br/></br>  <br> I would have cared more if they showed to us how did she get killed from riding a motorbike in 50-80mph, most likely they bumped to a japanese truck or get thrown away to the edge of a sharp turn.</br>  <br>I think he hit a bump and she fell off backwards.</br>  <br>I dont care for redhead boy but I care for Yusa (and Misa) who will be recurring characters and the latter came as assholish to anyone but her sister BEFORE that scene.</br>  nao is literally the only reason to watch this show  <br>I enjoyed tjhat part, I think I enjoy cute girls getting punched in the face in general.</br>    <br>Yeah don't forget to quote anon.</br>  <br><br>Funny you should say that because she's also the number 1 reason people drop it.</br></br>  <br>She's shown a few times now that she doesn't give a shit about herself</br>  <br>That's not sanicbro.</br>  <br> Speed-kun will never be your bro <br>Why bother living?<br><br>And with that said, Nao is great too. Heroines with strong personality are great even if bet/a/s pretend otherwise</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love Nao. Her voice, her smugness and protectiveness.</br>  Who the fuck's Charlotte?  <br> Who's the best PA Works protag? <br>Miuna.</br></br>  If the imouto suffers for even ten seconds I will fucking murder everyone.  <br>Provide photos for authentication.</br>  <br>my cunt ex girlfriend<br><br><br>rip world</br></br></br></br>  <br> Heroines with strong personality are great <br><br>Because the stronger they are, the hotter it is when they break.<br><br>Don't you see? That's why strong women exist. To be broken, just like any other bitch. It's just more satisfying when greater effort is put into it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nao is already broken</br>   Hey you can't use power for bad purpose! <br> Use it for personal gain everyday, for something simple as getting food <br><br> Holy shit a person we chased just backhanded our girl and are running away into a dead end <br> Ram him into a wall so hard the wall cracks and he pukes blood <br> Nigger you better tell us what you want or you gonna die <br><br>Are we watching this anime from the villian side or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me, OP. I actually marked this anime to watch, but I didn't realize it started yet.<br><br>Now I got 3 episodes to catch up on tomorrow.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I can tell the problem with kids abusing their powers is that they get found out and captured. Using powers at school isn't a problem.</br>  <br><br>No she isn't. She still has plenty of hope. She's giving it her all, in fact! Even if she doesn't care about herself, her care for others, even in spite of her inherent mistrust, is in full bloom. Her absolutely narcissistic messiah complex totally contradicts the idea that she's truly broken.<br><br>But the thing about that is... Hope is a wonderful thing, but it's also a terrible burden, because it means you have something that can still be taken from you. The more you hope, the more you're setting yourself up for inevitable disappointment. Even if the outcome is alright, if you hoped too much, you can still be unsatisfied in the end. But if the outcome is bad...<br><br>The higher up it is dropped, the worse the crash will be. Hope is the best spice to bring out despair.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> trying this hard to be 3deep5me </br>  <br> no piss on her skirt or on the ground <br> no shadow on her <br><br>you had one job japan</br></br></br></br>    <br>The thing is they still use their powers in public when they go to capture other peoples with powers, to the point of harming normal people. What is stopping anyone rom reporting it to someone else? And where did archer go?<br><br>I still don't know how and why is staying in that school is better than anywhere else, maybe they will explain that in later episodes. The show still have a ridiculous amount of plotholes.</br></br></br>  <br>Most likely case is a mixture between some further plot point and the usual anime "it doesn't count as a plothole because we don't mention it" treatment</br>  <br> why is staying in that school is better than anywhere else <br>Hoshi no Umi is a haven because being under their wing pretty much makes you safe from being a target of experimentation. Nao explained this in ep 2<br><br> muh plotholes <br>The subtitles, read them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What fucking language is this?</br>  Has anyone a theory already why are they only safe from the Scienetists in the Star Ocean Academy?  <br>The scientists are actually the good guys.</br>  I like the show. I just wonder when Nao and Yuu are going to  hold hands   <br>Nao already said why. The school's benefactor protects them.</br>  <br> The school's benefactor protects them. <br>Fucking Charlotte, how does she do it?</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gB5<wbr>qUxR6ch4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Nao is so cute in the Opening</br>  Does anyone have a webm of megane opens the classroom door and sonic booms away?  <br>Protects them how?<br>Those scientists would have had some major financial and political backing if they were able to do what they did.</br></br>  <br> implying what I said was deep <br><br>It's not deep at all, Anon. That's some fucking middle school level pessimism bullshit right there. No, here's something actually meaningful:<br><br>Humanity isn't evil. Humanity is a victim. It is not at all clear if the biological form of consciousness, as so far brought about by evolution on our planet, is a desirable form of experience, an actual good in itself. If one dares to take a closer look at the actual phenomenology of biological systems on our planet, the many different kinds of conscious suffering are at least as dominant a feature as are color vision or conscious thought, both of which appeared only very recently. Evolution is not something to be glorified. One way out of countless others to look at biological evolution on our planet is as a process that has created an expanding ocean of suffering and confusion where there previously was none. With each new advancement, the suffering grows deeper, more complex, and more ubiquitous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dudeee</br>  <br>We don't know yet. Maybe the benefactor has an extremely strong power and the scientist are just scared to mess with him? I suspect the benefactor is that guy with the white hair and glowing blue eyes in the OP and that he's yu's older brother</br>  <br>Her name is Nao. And fucking is exactly how she does it.</br>  <br>So Nao is a Alien?</br>  What's wrong with this child?  <br>I don't think Nao is the one protecting anyone at this school.</br>  <br>There's enough cancer in that post to make a second season of Shigatsu</br>  <br> Magneto <br> benefactor <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Is it just me or does she look really scary. I mean in the show she is super cute but just looking at the stills. Her eyes give me the vibe that she is just about to kill me</br></br></br></br>  <br>This post gave terminal stage cancer</br>  What are these Differences in the Opening from Ep 2 and Ep 3 are meaning?  <br>Which shithole commie speaking country are you from?</br>  <br>Every sunday, when there is a break from school, Nao meets up with the scientists. They all sloppily gang bang her, filling her with semen like the semen demon she is. In exchange, the scientists leave the school and the students alone.</br>  <br>You could add MC guy stumbling across it and accidentally using his power to experience the gangbang from Nao's point of view<br><br>That's a plot I can get behind</br></br></br>  <br>They're just dropping vague hints about the plot in the OP. Like "time leap", time travel is basically confirmed guys.</br>  <br>Nothing, PA just added some nifty visual effects.</br>  <br>Time travel was confirmed the moment they showed that watch in the OP.<br><br>Fucking time travel.</br></br></br>  <br>/r/anime would really like you, probably upvote your post to the top too.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind betting edgy MC-kun knew Nao and friend before the first episode but doesn't remember it for some reason. He'll get back his memories, realize something tragic, and then save his imouto</br>  <br><br>This... This isn't what I was getting at guys....</br></br>  <br>My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.</br>  <br>Time Travel is the most dangerous Power you could get..</br>  <br>Taste a bit stale, /a/non</br>  <br>epic meme bro!! xD</br>  <br> fucked up <br> just go back in time <br>u wot m8?</br></br></br>  <br><br>How the fuck could you even fight them without prior knowledge of what they all can do? Even fully armed it would be tricky, especially Speedbro. <br><br>I really wish some of you would think before you post.</br></br></br></br>  <br> time travel <br> can't choose which time to travel to </br></br>  <br>All powers in the show don't work properly so it will be nerfed a lot. Possibly it can't be activated willingly or something like that.</br>  <br>Well i think the Scientists would try everything to get a Person with this Power.. so she would not even be safe in the School from these Guys</br>  <br>Remember the powers are not perfect, you could end up in a different point in time than expected, maybe decades before in the past or in the distant future</br>  <br> time travel <br> can only go back one second <br> occasionally goes forward one second <br> can't even za warudo </br></br></br></br>  She's going to  die   <br>I'm ok with that</br>  <br>I doubt she is actually going to die, but she will definitely end up in life threatening danger. Which will force MC-kun into some rushed one cour character development</br>  <br>My Bets are on her. She has the Time Travel Power</br>   you'll never have a qt caring imouto scolding you because you got home late   <br>and she will go back in time and become the MCs mother?</br>  <br>And then forward in time and become his wife</br>  <br>OH FUCK... but this would destroy the Universum</br>  <br><br>You should check out Predestination . It's literally that.</br></br>  <br>I don't have any sexual attractions towards my relatives either, freak.</br>  <br>True<br><br>It's more anime style to make it turn out that every single being ever is imouto and imouto is actually god</br></br></br>  <br>I don't either. I just want to pet her and make her happy in a strictly platonic way.</br>  <br> Imouto was born as Kanye but went back in time to marry herself after she had a sex change. Then she gave birth to kanye and imouto before traveling back to her time to defeat the top evil scientist who was actually her all along . </br>    <br><br>Seems more brain than soul-related if you ask me.<br>When the scientists screwed around with Nao's brother, it was after his head got all messed up that he could no longer use his power.</br></br></br>  <br>She dips the ends of her hair in a tray of dye so it soaks upwards like celery.</br>  How many machines will rape imouto before this ends?  <br>I'd like to think this anime is about Kanye &amp; Iroha's adventure after 8man &amp; YY graduate.</br>  <br> Misa controls Yusa's body </br>  <br> Miuna <br> protag </br></br>  You think we will already get doujinshi at summer comiket?  <br>I AM A GOD DESU</br>  <br>Noname landfag pls</br>    <br>I admit, I chuckled.</br>  <br> two tampons <br><br>This is way too lewd for me</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aC3<wbr>D2CGBQKo</wbr>  [ ]    <br> Nosebleed <br>So she's confirmed to have KeyAIDS?</br></br>  <br>Nosebleeds in anime symbolize excitement and arousal.</br>  <br>what if she just had a normal nosebleed?<br><br>or what if  her magical power is not having a vagina so she bleeds through her nose instead </br></br></br>    <br>Charlotte a cute. A CUTE</br>  So about those two posters they showed us earlier that Maeda said were related in a way but different aesthetically?  <br> ? <br>That wasn't a question.</br></br>  <br>Shit i need to go to sleep</br>  <br>the eyes</br>  <br>What are Yuusa talkin about?</br>  <br>best part of the episode</br>    <br>yeah, that was pretty stupid</br>  <br>Ohana</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128296896 <br> Fire rapes people. <br>lel</br></br>  Is there anything she can't do? It's nice to see an alpha female.  <br>She is basically the better version of Yurippe</br>  <br>She can't fucking ban you.</br>   cute   <br>That punch was only meant to show that to be honest<br>They wouldn't have made him punch her just because</br></br>  <br><br>I want to taste her juicy clots.</br></br>  <br> Slap <br>Anon, that's a full on punch</br></br>  <br> white pantsu <br><br>Slut.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn better picture tava in 2ch.net<br><br>It is not for nothing it Nao is called a violent bitch.<br>Here she is angry.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>I tired</br>  <br>Then go to sleep.</br>  <br><br>The panties it was dirty, Nao does not cleared well your ass.</br></br>    <br> Lemon Cider </br>  <br><br>It is a violent and annoying bitch.<br>It is the opinion of the Japanese.<br>Read 2ch.net wires.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My bad. Should have named that Touma.</br>  Charlotte - Episode 3<br><br>「恋と炎」 (Koi to Honoo)<br><br>“Love with Flames”<br><br>With great power comes great responsibility. Or does it? Someone should probably tell Tomori that…<br><br>If there’s one thing that’s for sure, it’s that for all of Tomori’s supposedly benevolent intentions, there’s a certain disconnect between her goals and the actions she takes to achieve them. One could argue for the use of all necessary force given what’s supposedly at stake, but when you’re rocket tackling people into walls and stepping on their broken ribs threatening to kill them to obtain information, it makes you wonder when she cross the metaphorical “line”.<br><br>The fact that she’s essentially posing as an amateur detective is starting to reek more of recklessness and irresponsibility more than anything, and it seems like there’s a giant danger sign hanging here if I’ve ever seen one. Just last week she was almost shot by an arrow—one barely avoided due to Takajou’s quick thinking—and this week she literally runs straight into a punch. The gradual escalation here, and the revelation that some people could hold more than one type of power makes me wonder if they’re setting things up for a rude awakening, and it certainly be interesting to see if that does happen and what the end results of that will be—especially if the stakes are as high as she claims them to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is Charlotte?  <br>It's the virus.</br>  <br>ZHIEND vocalist</br>    Bitches get stitches.  What do people like about Nao? She's just a violent asshole that ruins the fun of other people and tears them away from their friends and classmates to keep them close to make sure they don't use their powers, just because she's jealous that they get to have fun with their powers when her brother couldn't.  <br>She's smug and cute</br>  <br>Her personality leaves much to be desired but she's cute. A CUTE.</br>  <br>Calm down Yuu</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pDC<wbr>7b6ffy6k</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br><br>I'm pretty sure the official site release that it was only her older sister who she could channel before it even started airing. Due to the nature of her power, only those who are in tune with Yusa would be able to use it anyway since Yusa doesn't control it.</br></br></br>  What's stopping these scientists from taking these children with powers just because they go to a different school? Did I miss something or has it not been explained yet?  <br>It seems like they don't just pick them up from the streets but rather pressure their parents or something.</br>  <br>MAL? ANN? In any case it's better than some of the retards here.</br>  <br>It's either their benefactor is powerful or the school is a honeypot.</br>  <br> What if I actually got my head out of the gutter for five seconds? <br>i think we all need that power.</br></br>  <br>cool vid bro</br>  Dropped  <br>He could possess the parents of the student council kids and sign their children away to the scientists, leaving him free to use his powers however he wants again.</br>  ok    <br>No.</br>  <br> implying she's going to live for that long </br>  <br>I don't see it.</br>  <br>Same expession, dark hair, purple eyes, pink hairclips?</br>  <br>  definitely original <br>Of course, who cares, I mainly got tired of moral-preaching MC's anyways faggot-kun</br></br>  <br>No one cares of course, don't you see I'm agreeing with you? Being different is so cool, right? So fucking cool, just for the sake of being different. Who cares about story plot, who cares about character development, who cares about realistic-balance character?<br><br>What matters is that the MC should be different, because it's cool.</br></br></br>  Just got an idea. If Misa can use her power while possessing Yusa, can MC combo his power and jump from person to person?  <br>Christ, you and that faggot who can't speak English are the worst part of these threads.</br>  <br>She's a cute bitch.</br>  <br>Hey, I'm just expanding what that fag posted. Don't blame me.</br>  I'm ready and looking forward to the anger when there's no romantic subplots at all in this show.  <br> maaya uchida uses her zero voice for misa <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>It'd be surprising but at this point I don't think anyone really cares. Did anyone watch Angel Beats for the romance? It was more like an addition to the friendship plot. That's also how Little Busters! is.</br>  who the fuck is charlotte?  <br>Me.</br>    <br><br> his face <br><br>Its look like his dreams were shattered</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's upset because she's wearing a magic skirt and can't see her panties.</br>  <br><br> She jumped through space and time to fuck the young ceo </br></br>  <br> definitely original <br>nobody said it was original, it's just  fun . I mean, fuck, this anime is already clearly ripping off x-men, MC is clearly based on lelouch and the story is shaping up to be exactly like everything else key has ever done.</br></br>  Is this a comedy? Am I supposed to be laughing now?  <br>And they're teenagers, it's obvious they use it for their advantage somehow. I think the problem with MC was that he used it a bit too much and for more important stuff than just getting food<br><br> Using powers at school isn't a problem. <br><br>It is. Glasses-kun said in the second episode that he'd go on the camera blindspot to get food.<br><br><br>It was also retarded how Nao instantly went "yup, we beat him down if our super powers xD" to a completely unknown when questioned about the guy who was chasing Yusa. After she spent the whole second half of the second episode talking how much she doesn't trust anybody and MC shouldn't even joke about the possibility of getting caught and shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Nao such a fucking hypocrite? What happened to hiding their powers? They used them in front of a lot of people. What happened to not abusing your powers? They just threatened someone to obey them. I guess it's okay though because muh special friend that runs the school apparently protects them. I hope the twist is that they're being fooled and Nao has unknowingly been working for the enemy all along to gather people with abilities.  <br>I'd rather have some corruption thing, with her willingly handing over every student to them in exchange for more dicks.</br>  <br>Because Nao is under protection, and she knew from context that red head was likely hiding Yusa. Again, the point is that they can't let it out to the "public" where the scientists might find them, but he was not public, and they had just as much power over him hiding Yusa as he could have over them. You actually have to think if you want to understand this anime.</br>  <br>at least you will never have a imouto that dies tragically by episode 12/13<br><br><br> and she knew from context that red head was likely hiding Yusa <br>he could very likely be chasing after her as well<br><br> You actually have to think if you want to understand this anime. <br><br>Ehh... it's really not that deep.<br><br> you're probably trolling though, so whatever </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not trolling faggot, but I am annoyed in general at all these people asking stupid questions. There are still people who actually think that Nao is moralistic and not pragmatic. That's absolutely retarded.</br>  <br> There are still people who actually think that Nao is moralistic and not pragmatic. <br><br>I don't think that and I still don't see why you would say stupid shit to the redhead. He could very well be working with the guy you just beat up and pretending to know where Yuna is. It was just dumb.</br></br></br>  Do you think Yusa also got spitroasted by these two just like when Misa was alive?  <br>Ok, so say red head was actually their enemy. They could just as easily take care of him and whoever he brings along in the same way they take care of all the other people. I think it was a calculated risk.</br>  <br>I mean, they follow him to his hide out right afterwards, what if they got there and there was like, 50 other people wanting to gangbang Nao? Maybe even someone with powers that works for "the scientists" as well?</br>  <br>She clearly wasn't living her life correctly.</br>  <br>Touma doesn't backhand.</br>  <br>That wasn't her pantsu though, it was the inner side of her skirt.</br>  <br>That's BR shitposter.</br>  Would this be a better crew than the current strawhats?  <br>It would steamroll opponents far faster. Sanji replaced by Sabo as the token blonde strong guy, Kyros replacing Brook as the old guy with a sad long past, Law replacing Nami as the sex appeal, and Bellamy replacing Chopper as the weakling mascot character.</br>  I'd want Brook and Sanji back. I don't care if their gags got annoying, I like them.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128297818 <br>Good riddance.</br></br></br>  You'd think Law would cover himself properly like Robin when he sleeps. I guess he's had enough bad influence that he just morphs into the other Strawhats. <br><br>I also like how Usopp just crawled into Luffy's bed.</br></br>  It's basically the Strawhats but much better.<br><br>So, yes</br></br>  <br>i think it's a call back to how he slept as a child from his flashback with corazon. mouth open with same posture.</br>  <br>Who is the guy sleeping next to Kyros?</br>  <br>Bellamy</br>  <br>Christ, I can't even tell if his mouth is open or not.<br>Makes sense though<br><br><br>Binami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well there's a close up shot of him pretty soon after</br>  <br>Turns out I'm super retarded this week. Who knew.<br><br> Thank you Anon </br></br></br>  the ultimate master ruseman  <br>no worries</br>  Do you think that this crew could be more entertaining than strawhats ?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128298093 <br>Such a shame Sabo has already left.</br>    <br> ruseman <br>Say the truth is not a ruse .</br></br>  Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji will always be the original and the only Straw Hat Pirates for me.

Even his crewmates are yelling at him to move the fuck on but he STILL wont listen. Didnt he learn from his mistake of going after BB when he was told not to? Pretty much spat on everyone's face that came to save him, allies, crewmates, Whitebeard, Luffy. And the person he was defending ended up dying in the end because of it. <br><br> sabo a superior brother </br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br>Not the first time.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br> having a crew without a cook and a watch guard <br><br><br>Tell me how are they going to survive the seas without Usopp and Sanji?</br></br></br></br>  <br>stupid Ace.

I'm not saying it was out of character or anything. We've already seen him blow his cover at a freaking marine base cause he overheard someone talking smack abt WB. It's still fucking selfishly dumb of him to not keep his emotions in check in that kind of situation.

It is in topic.<br>You're just afraid I might summon Rebeccafag back with this kind of subject, and I do agree that the thread kind of turns to shit even without him when the subject is touched upon, so I didn't plan on discussing this too much.

I don't want Urouge to join BB because they would have to job him real hard </br></br>  <br><br> implying he wouldn't kill BB and form the true Fallen Monk Pirates </br></br>  <br>Kuros has two legs?</br>  Isn't Urouge the weakest supernova though? Or is it another case of bounty =/= power?  <br><br>Urouge is Urouge.</br></br>  <br>it is not, as a matter of fact, you are discussing your different views about the meaning of the word 'misogynyst' which doesn't relate to one piece at all, and if someone uses it in a way that doesn't appeal to you to define a character you have no real reason to bump in and start or engage into a completely pointless discussion that involves SJW bullshit and such. These threads can get already bad staying on topic, let's just not discuss this kind of shit further shall we.<br><br> also as you said there's a chance we might summon HIM, now that would be the death of the thread </br></br></br>  <br> looking at a rock is cute <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't noticed they weren't there.

Doffy might have been an evil person, but Roci had to die after what he did. Doffy had to do it as the head of the family.<br><br>I wonder how he actually felt about Law leaving, too. He saw a part of himself in Law and was hoping the kid would help fuck up the world with him.

Like blowing a house away, because he tripped and afterwards rebuilding it with his men and asking for forgiveness or something, that would be cool</br></br>  <br>one more batshit insane admiral? I can live with that.</br>  <br> Like blowing a house away, because he tripped <br>so Admiral Corozon</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301995 <br><br> is forbidden <br><br>Because of discrimination laws, social laws are a different thing.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302066 <br>Dude just leave him alone. Bothering someone because they can't find ain't cool man.</br>  <br>No, I meant destroying it willingly. Like imagine a cute rabbit going around and trips and suddenly turns into a demon destroying everything in sight and afterwards turning into that rabbit again. That would be pretty nasty for anyone.</br>  <br>Green Bull should be different from the other admirals, so...<br> Aokiji: Lazy Justice, chill personality <br> Akainu: Absolute Justice, a zealot and a manipulator <br> Kizaru: Unclear Justice (whatever the fuck that means), acts like a stoner but is pretty ruthless <br> Fujitora: ??? Justice, a gambler with a keikaku <br>I think it'd be good to have a corrupt admiral who makes shady deals and turns a blind eye to his subordinates' crimes. Green Bull's justice could be "fight bad guys with their own methods".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br><br>I'm not the racist one, I'm just talking about law.<br><br>It is socially forbidden, I'm not arguing otherwise - but there's a reason social laws don't exist, only social norms.<br><br>Discrimination laws on the other hand, exist and are feasible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302148 <br>Are you a 3D grill?<br>Do you really bleed from down there?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br>Can i rub my dick on your armpits?<br>That's my fetish...</br></br>  <br>man, that would be awesome.

I don't care if that person was racist,fascist,taoist or misogynist don't assume anything about them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always though Fujitora was blind justice<br><br>Either way I'd rather have something like Lost Justice, someone who has the position without having a goal. Like akainu telling him to do something and he does, but only that and nothing more than that. For example if he has to catch doflamingo, he catches doflamingo, but wouldn't capture anyone related to him. That would probably open a lot of new problems which would be cool I guess.</br></br></br>  <br> that fucked up word <br> He <br>this is actually getting funny now, you should seriously consider writing satire</br></br></br>  Based mods.  shitposter-kun got banned it seems.  <br>It's either Impel Down or death unless he gets rescued. <br><br>If Doffy is ever going to be rescued, who's going to do it? The story "implies" that Monet and Vergo are "dead". I know it's debatable for people about Monet being dead, but that's what the story has so far.</br></br></br>  What if green bull was a woman? We've seen zoro and luffy attack women as long as sanji doesn't fight green bull it could work.  <br>Won't know till he's introduced.<br>Personally, I doubt it.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry if I get offended because everyone assumes all anons have penises on 4chan.</br>  <br>His bounty was that because 108 is a significant number, he's probably as strong as the others, I'd say at least stronger than Killer, Zoro and Bonney. Maybe Bege too.</br>  <br>Are you retarded??<br>Or do you not know that breaking social laws can put you behind bars in America?</br></br>  <br>With how Dressrosa is completely destroyed, the crew isn't complete, everyone is very injured and Fujitora is already there with CP0 coming to the island, I can't see how they'll be able to party. They probably would have to do it in the ship once they leave with whoever.</br>  Seems like it's safe again.<br><br><br> Search for "bread trafalgar law" on ff.net. .

Am I going to have to post more Luffy/Zoro pictures ?  <br> Do you ever hear black people laughing like that? It's only Mexicans. <br>Now THAT'S racist<br><br><br><br>DO IT<br>O<br><br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was nice but then some racist anon had to ruin it.

I thought it was something some mexican anon put together from some old comedy show he liked or something. I just read the subtitles about anons thoughts on Dressrosa and laughed at Sanji/Rebecca jokes.  <br>For your information I'm black</br>  <br> I will never acknowledge those other literally who faggots that tries to blend in the Straw Hat culture. <br>Choppa joined the crew like two years into the manga, he's practically been around since the start.</br></br>    <br>It's not racism retard.

Has Franky ever showcased a love for animals?  <br>How tf do you know that? Or are you just tryin to sound smart</br>  So why exactly is it that Zoro became such bros with Luffy ? Can he just sense Luffy's potential ? Or is he drawn to his strength ? I know Mihawk said that Luffy can turn people into allies and what not but likewise Urouge has said that Zoro is not the type to follow others.  How can anybody like ussop? Weakest, stupidest, ugliest, pussiest Strawhat, god i hate him. How can the fucking sniper be allowed to be the weakest member? ridiculous.  <br>Wow it's like you're adolf hitler himself.</br>  <br>Is Law afraid of bread or something?</br>  <br>That's because Akainu is his bitch. Just look at this glorious motherfucker.<br>But to be serious for a moment, I didn't really get the admiral vibe from Fuji at all. Whenever the other 3 showed up, you knew shit was about to go down. Not so with him for some reason. At least for me.</br></br>  <br>His accent, and he's talking about paella. I investigated, and he's called El Risitas, he's from Sevilla, Spain.</br>  <br> speedreaders </br>  <br>Now you do. The anime may have downplayed it a little, I don't know. But I remember being mega hyped when "Zoro" appeared in Impel Down.</br>  <br><br>He's a Spanish comedian.</br></br>  <br>That's Hitler-sama.</br>  <br> gets BTFO <br> HURR DURR HITLER SAMA <br>just Fuck off already</br></br></br>  <br>I used to think the same, but the fucker just grew on me. He is smart and creative, he can be brave and kick ass when it counts, his VA is awesome. And his lies come true!</br>  <br>He doesn't like it. He's willing to fight Luffy and a monkey in order to not eat it.</br>  <br>Your probably a cracker aren't ya</br>  I feel like all the shitposting in this thread is done by like two people.  <br>said the racist.</br>  <br>Usopp is awesome. A ton of people used to hate Usopp which made me appreciate him even more and I'm better for it.</br>  <br> investigated <br>Your not a detective fuckwad</br></br>  <br>Where have you been the last couple years?<br> select all hamburgers <br>Christ I'm hungry.</br></br></br>  <br>Been reading since Skypeia.. don't think he's gonna "grow on me" if he hasn't already.</br>    <br>I think sometimes people take bait just because they;re bored too. And there's probably lots of bored people here. All it takes really is one dedicated master baiter.</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me in the least.</br>  <br>Spanish and Mexican are the same friggin thing dumbass.<br>It's like saying Caucasian and slavic</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo forced him to eat a bread made of his dead parents when he was a child to prove his royalities.</br>  <br>Same. Must be something about Logia Admirals.</br>  <br>Why can't people just post nice pictures when they're bored or something?<br> When I'm bored I post homos </br></br>  <br>I=What was your reaction to Sogeking and him trying to bait Lucci and him fighting Perona and defending Zoro against Kizaru and Kuma and him sticking up for his Captain in PH and God Usopp ?</br>  <br>Because not everyone likes a guy and a girl in the same pic. It's just not right to look at. It's socially and universally unacceptable. If your gonna post something there shouldn't be a female in it.</br>  <br>Did you get that vibe from Aokiji's introduction ? He was impressive but I think Fujitora's meteors might rival that.</br>  <br><br> Spanish and Mexican are the same friggin thing <br> Caucasian and Slavic are the same thing <br><br>Who was calling who racist again?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this usopp's island?<br><br><br>Sure, just like British and Americans, or Portuguese and Brazilians</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128297818 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128298093 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128300438 <br>Top fucking kek the faggot<br> hates bellamy <br> likes bellamy <br> is the "will rebecca join"-shitposter <br> is the transgender Femanon <br><br>Seriously giving this 12 year old a ip range ban would make the op threads twice as good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously don't know the definition of racist.</br>  <br><br>Racism is discrimination against race.</br></br>    Anyone else love it when Luffy gets really pissed off ?<br><br><br><br>Yea, pretty sure it's Usopp's village.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Idk, you never met bro's you just hit it off with? Friendship at first sight? Instant bromance? Happened to me twice as a grown man, the friend that introduces you always get mad jello too.</br>  <br>Age doesn't really matter on this site</br>  <br>I don't really know why its like this. I know Fujitora is a fucking beast, but for some reason I just don't feel the same way about him as I did with the original 3.</br>  <br> Age doesn't really matter on this site <br>I wrote moot an e-mail just now, you should read the rules.</br></br>    <br>Finally a normal person in this thread. I'm tired of everyone posting girls. Not everyone likes that shit. Can you post some moar btw? Please</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be "discrimination" just prejudice. Not all racism is bad, Asians being better at math for example.</br>  <br>A lot of times I don't remember how I became friends with someone. It's as if we ''just were'', you know ? And I don't think I've had anyone connect with me that quickly and deeply that quickly. Then again, I'm not Luffy/Zoro nor am I in a manga so that's to be expected. I don't know, it's just kinda interesting to think about.</br>  <br><br> age doesn't really matter on this site  <br><br>Global Rule 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it can be prejudice.<br><br>In which it is still racism - I'm not talking about good or bad here, more 'is' and 'isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Physical age doesn't mean Jack shit. You could be 10 but in reality you have the mind of a 22 year old</br>  <br>As I said read the rules.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't matter what you 'think', it's the rules.</br></br>  <br>Might be because Fujitora kinda showed his ability a little more than the others. All the others were just Monsters and they left the scene. Aokiji almost killed Luffy, rekt Zoro and Sanji. Kizaru wrecked everyone, Akainu was having a whale of a time. Fujitora just kinda did something, laughed and did his own thing.</br>  <br>Rules are meant to be broken bruh</br>  <br><br>Don't whine if you get banned then.</br></br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>The small arc before Sabaody was amazing.</br>  <br>Who cares if it's the "rules". Those stupid rules just block off this site from getting better members</br>  <br>I hated Sogeking, stupid coward should of just admitted he fagged out over Merry (the whole saying bye to going merry thing, was the worst part of OP for me, and made me really hate Ussop) everything else was eh. I'm just a shallow dude, and his nose fucking bugs me.</br>  Fuuuuck, so much camaraderie  <br>So you admit to be underage?</br>  <br><br> underaged b&amp; <br> better members </br></br></br>  <br>And as I'm saying right now <br>Just Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Fuck off feminazi</br>  <br>I think it's a bit of everything.</br>  <br>read the rules first</br>  <br>That's most likely it. I guess I've not yet seen him do the same crazy shit the others did.</br>  <br>Being a feminazi is better than being a tripfag</br>  <br>Yea, it was kinda refreshing and shit was hilarious.<br><br><br> I'm just a shallow dude <br>Well, at least you said it and not me. To each their own, I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br>  can a mod just delete this thread please  <br>You know it's tru</br>  <br>Not me, when i meet a fellow good looking dude (to help me pick up sluts), that's way to cocky, and has a sick sense of humor like me, we insta best bros.</br>  <br>Sorry Billy just cause you don't like some thing doesn't mean other people feel the same way</br>  <br>I admit to being a better member</br>  <br>and with this you admitted to be underage. Thanks.</br>  <br> tripfag <br>well at least I'm not a homophobe like you</br></br>  <br> Sovereign Haki <br>This is the one thing that kinda irks me about the Coloured ones. T-Steak was like an Admiral something or other in the translation. <br><br><br>That's pretty normal, I suppose. But still, him yelling at Akainu was fucking badass,</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: racist,feminazis,fujoshit and autists  <br>I say " racism is prejudice."<br> No, it can be prejudice. <br>huh? duh, that's exactly what i said. are you not good with reading comp? The "good or "bad" was just extra fyi i threw in there.</br></br></br>  <br> moar <br>Do you have a problem with fucking spelling?</br></br>  <br>Ah, I guess it's a personality thing. I'm not extroverted all that much so I guess it takes time for me to be actual friends with someone. Oh well.</br>  <br>Whoa I'm sorry bruh I guess I'm not allowed to use slang on the interweb</br>  <br>I would usually agree, as anything is better then trip-cunts. but feminist are even more annoying scum.</br>  Zoro's so based  <br>You men are all the same</br>    <br> I'm not extroverted all that much <br>Me neither, but i wanted people to like me, especially bitches, so i learned to fake it. It is incredibly mentally exhausting though..</br></br>  <br>I really miss Sanji's interactions with Zoro. I feel like after the timeskip we've seen way too little of them.</br>  <br>fuck off to tumblr where you belong</br>   monstertrio will never get a panel like this again <br><br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>lel, Not true though, while i may be a disgusting evil asshole at least 20% of the dudes i know are upstanding, plain ole nice guys.</br>  <br>You don't say. I wanted people to like me too but I decided it's not worth it. No point in putting up a different mask every time I hang out with my 'friends'. <br><br>Or I was just too lazy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Calling yourself anonymous is overrated.</br></br>  !!!!!!Post your sexiest heart pirates!!!!!!!  <br><br>The original point was that it wasn't racism.<br><br>I assumed you were the one who was responding to me, hence the 'no it can be prejudice'.</br></br></br></br>  this thread is literal shit   ZOROOO <br><br><br>We got a fair amount in Punk Hazard. Obviously not in Dressrosa but that goes without saying. I'm sure it will come back in Wano when Sanji makes fun of Zoro's swords or some other stuff.<br><br><br> never <br>Yea, no, they definitely will have a panel like that again.

Also he was controlled by doffy in last chapters cover. Where do we go from here?</br>  <br> putting up a different mask every time I hang out with my 'friends'. <br>I don't make the effort to act sociable every time I'm with my friends, only for first impressions, and when we go out and meet strangers. They don't seem to mind the difference, except when I'm just to tired to pretend to be outgoing, and we're around some hot bitches and they wanna get laid. Then they get a little but hurt I'm not being a good "wing man" but they get over it.</br></br>    <br>I disagree, they are implied to be the best. Sanji was outright the best cook on the baratie, Nami has some kind of ability to predict weather (shown) and the ability to literally control it</br>  <br>Pfft, as if. Oda confirmed that Buggy would just run away like the shit God that he is, if his whole crew got trapped in the Bird Cage.<br><br><br> same coat as Donflamingo <br>I don't think Doffy owns the rights to fur coats, Anon.

But I don't have the devil fruit lol</br>  <br>I thought Oda just confirmed that he could freely enter and exit.</br>  <br>Huh. Well, as long as it works then I guess there's no problem, right ? Keep being you, whenever you can bruh. Enjoy the bitches, as it were.</br>  <br>O: You're right, he would--.<br><br>Even if you put him in the bird cage with his crewmates, he'd still escape by himself!<br><br>Buggy is no God of mine, I tell you.</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that this is considered one of the best films of the century and it's put on the same pedestal as In the Mood for Love and Mulholland Drive.  only chads think this  Tell us something we don't know.

As a result a lot of money was made on a fairly uninteresting Chinese Cartoon Film that isn't even the best work from it's creator.</br>  <br>In the mood for love has a beta MC.</br>  <br>That applies more to Frozen than SA.</br>  <br>I'm honestly not a big david lynch fan.<br><br>Coffee and Cigarettes might be good if you're into moeshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say it's comfy and cool. It was extremely wistful, bittersweet and contemplatively yearning. It's a really great film: cinematography, music, characterization, acting, story, setting. I'd recommend it especially if you were   in the mood of love (i'm serious)) </br></br>  <br>Whats the problem? Its a great movie and I think its great that an animated feature gets that kind of attention. I think true fans of this medium would be glad that anime get recognized in some level as something legit. People think all anime is something like pokemon and dragon ball z since thats all they've ever seen.</br>   Miyazaki <br> hack <br><br>pick two</br></br></br>  <br> change into an entirely different character for no reason  <br><br>There are plenty of reasons why this happens in Lynch films. Sorry you have to use your brain somewhat. Watch it again after you've finished high school.</br></br></br>  <br>...kind of a lateral move<br>Also,  GIDF pls </br></br>  I've seen every ghibli film (and other films miyazaki has made) except for My neighbors the yamadas, pom poko and when marnie was there.<br><br>And the best movies are always by takahata. Kaguya, grave, and only yestersday are all the most emotionally impactful movies.<br><br>The worst films are earth sea and ocean waves. My personal favorite is Only Yesterday.</br></br></br></br>  I'll never understand why Ghibli characters are so damn pure to the point of perfection, and single-minded. <br>It's like they just follow a straight path towards the ideal ending without ever second guessing their own actions.</br>  I wouldn't say the film is the best, but the scene with the train is probably my single favourite scene from any anime.  <br>it was nice and clean fom beginning to the end<br>it's like having a pure consciousness, never used</br></br>  When are western film critics going to start championing Mamoru Hosoda?  <br> Except for the girl on girl action. <br>Pleb confirmed</br></br>  <br> it's put on the same pedestal as In the Mood for Love and Mulholland Drive <br><br>I don't understand as well, those two movies are shit.</br></br></br>  /a/ not liking Miyazaki/Spirited Away makes sense now that I know that they hate Mulholland Drive as well.<br><br>Shit taste.</br></br>  <br> doesn't make sense <br>Literally 2deep4u then. It makes perfect sense.</br></br>  <br>hmm, this isn't to say that they don't make they're own tweaks but keep in mind that they adapt written works too. Another thing is that they're films are primarily targeted at a young audience who can't handle heavy moral quandaries left right and centre. The young audience needs at least one graspable agent of goodness.</br>  <br> they're <br><br>oops, fuck me</br></br></br>  <br> It's a really great film: cinematography, music, characterization, acting, story, setting. <br><br>Yeah, a snorefest that goes nowhere.</br></br></br>  <br>The only movies accepted on /a/ are made by the the holy trinity of meme-directors, that is Nolan, Tarantino and Del Toro.</br>  I like Spirited Away, haven't seen the other two, are they any good?  <br>I don't think /a/ really hates Spirited Away. It's just that it's incredibly popular in the west and among normies.</br>  <br>yay for me.<br><br>and you're the epitome of fun and delight.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother unless you're looking for a film to put you asleep, it's pretentious and 2deep4u.</br>  <br>There are no Ghibli characters like that except Nausicaa.</br>  <br> muh small world </br>  <br>Well, I did watch Angel's Egg. Not one of my favorites, but definitely worth a watch.</br>  <br>most of The films are meant to be for children for one. Secondly, the innocent and pureness of the characters really fits the animation style and storytelling style of the films.<br><br>But not all of the films are like this, such films as the wind rises and kaguya has some complex characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Who would want to fuck a loser who can't grammar?</br>  <br>If you like Angel's Egg, you'll be fine to watch In the Mood for Love.

Everythings good. <br> Second episode airs. Now everyones read the manga. <br> The threads become manga threads, filled with spoilers. <br><br>The fuck is up with this shit? It happens every season. The only thing I'm able to watch with /a/ are original anime, or anime based on some LN that nobody has read, and even then, faggots usually pull up illustrations from the last novels, for some god damn reason.<br><br>Isn't there something we can do about this shit? I really wanted to watch Gakkou Gurashi with /a/ but I keep getting the show spoiled by pages and discussions when I enter the threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is why you should only watch anime-original.  <br>and kyoani LN adaptations</br>   get used to spoilers <br> read the manga <br> leave </br></br>  Every show is just "read the manga." Maybe some people don't want to and just discuss the anime based on limited information that has been given.<br><br>Shit like "fucking secondaries or anime only fags" is embarrassing but I guess some use it to feel some sense of superiority knowing they know what happens in the anime and the other Anon doesn't.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch showing his shit taste and opinions as usual.</br>  This anime speaks to me.  <br>you should just kill yourself then, no need to burden others</br>  <br>On a spiritual level</br>  What does it say?  <br>It tells me I don't need to feel bad about not having a job and being 26 because I can be like Umaru-chan! She's cool and cute.

Outward everyone thinks I'm a well-mannered, nice and reliable normal dude. But then I'm home become a degenerate.</br>  <br> remove subs <br> crop background <br> PROMOTIONS </br></br></br>    <br>Because they don't want to portray NEETs right in anime, it'd be too real for their audience.</br>  <br>There's a NEET in this anime?</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>When's he finally gonna fuck his little sister's friend? <br><br>I'm serious, he'd get the cutest fucking girl ever and he'd be sticking it to that selfish bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah cause it's really glorifying that lifestyle isn't it. Except the fact she's not opting out of life. She's athletic and does well in school. <br><br>Japs already have a bunch of people that work too much and never relax, maybe showing them something that has someone who can work hard when it's needed but slack off and be happy when they have that opportunity.</br></br></br>  Would you?  <br>Even though her happiness means being a burden to basically everyone around her? <br>Doing well in school =/= doing well in life. Outside of school, she's practically a vegetable.</br></br>  <br>Her happiness is a burden to her brother. Who guess what, works too hard and rarely relaxes. That's about it. <br><br>Also she's what a 14 year old girl? School is pretty damn important, what do you think she should be doing extra?</br></br></br>  <br> what is NHK </br>  <br>I'm not saying hobbies aren't important, but acting like you're 5? Constantly throwing tantrums to get what you want? Basically having an umbilical cord attached to your computer or television? That's in no way healthy, and it certainly shouldn't be panned off as "cute" or "endearing"</br>  <br>high-functioning autism is still autism</br>  <br>Feed her?<br>Her mouth is drooling, she must be very hungry.</br></br>  <br>Well, she's been having some character developments in the manga, so I guess this is kind of normal for teenagers. Heck even we used to leech on our family at some points of our lives (before adults anyway), didn't we?</br>  <br>I don't remember screaming at my parents for video games, no.</br>  <br>Some kids are good, some kids throw a tantrum just to get what they want (then get bored anyway), Umaru is just one of them. But with her intelligent and friends around, I doubt she would leech her brother for the rest of her life.</br>  <br>It's not exactly like she's an endearing character though when she's in that mode. Cute, maybe, but that's just the way of modern anime. <br><br>The girl does the best in her class, she's athletic enough to beat a swim team member at swimming, she has friends. <br><br>What she does outside of school, while immature, is to an extent fine, if her brother allows her to get what she wants by acting like that, then it's as much his fault for allowing her to live that way. To her it could be a norm. <br><br>I'm not saying it is healthy, but it appears that she'll still succeed in life and more than likely grow out of the stuff she does now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5's speak truth</br>  <br><br>Or be in Australia. We get government giveouts easily. Especially if you say you're abo.</br></br>  <br>again though, the character is being paraded around as cutesy and "charming". At least in No Life, No Game (equally awful) they didn't sugarcoat how much of a degenerate the main characters were.<br><br>I'm not claiming the brother isn't at fault- it takes an enabler to create that kind of terrible person. <br>I might have liked the show if they firmly established her wanting to get better by episode 2. Then I could forgive what she does a bit more because she'd actively be trying to be a better person in the background. At least then I have something to root for and be invested in. But the baseline the show sets overstays its welcome waaaay too long.<br><br>That anon here, if only truth were so easily defined as quints.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these normie losers being butthurt because they have to slave away working all day while i get to sit at home doing things I enjoy while living very comfortably  <br><br>Haha, sucks to be you losers.</br></br>  <br> If this is how she unwinds she will not be ready for adult life at all<br>Spoiled children are messed up in the head</br></br>  <br><br><br>Nobody is stupid enough to think this shit is acceptable. It's a fucking anime, just because you find it cute in the anime doesn't mean you think it's acceptable in real life. <br><br>Not to mention her character is literally impossible. Being perfect at sports and getting 100% in everything while also lazing around at home. She does study a lot, but we hardly see her play sport.<br><br>You're taking this shit way too seriously. This is a comedy anime. Have you read Hoozuki Aneki? It's similar in it's execution</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Penta speaks truth<br> Check em' </br></br>    <br>welcome to the NHK</br>  <br> Trying too hard to fit in </br>  <br>That they even try to make this behavior seem cute is disgusting. That people would find this behavior cute, in any context, is disturbing.</br>  <br>Not enough dank memes</br>  <br> stop liking what I don't like <br>I don't even like Umaru but fuck your retarded mentality.</br></br>  Best sub?  <br> just because its cute in anime doesn't mean it's acceptable in real life <br><br>Yeah look at gay couples and lesbian couples, and harems and pedophiles. All portrayed very purely and not at all acceptable in the real world.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to eviscerate that thing.</br>  <br><br><br>And others in this thread: <br>Most otaku think this not only to be acceptable, but are outraged how some would think this (minus having a big brother) is not how one should live. No exaggeration here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please learn what an otaku is you newfag.<br><br>Otaku =/= Hikki</br></br></br>  <br>I am absolute not saying "stop liking things I don't like". I'm actually ASKING you to invite me to your way of thinking. So far, I haven't been presented with adequate persuasion. I'm not so naive to think you shouldn't enjoy what you enjoy- rather I'm begging you to convince me that I'm wrong about this media.</br>  <br><br>They just never grew up. <br><br>Really they never have to go through growth in their personality because they go out of their way to avoid hardship. That means criticism and ploys to make them actually do things or think new things usually go out the window. <br><br>They never go out of their comfort zone, they never challenge themselves, they refuse to do anything new. <br><br>They're outraged, but not in the way that someone proactive would be outraged. They're not aiming to do anything about it, they're OFFENDED that someone would think to do something like that. They get defensive because if they accept that to be the norm. Someone might force them to do something. <br><br>It's what a lot of people on this board do. /a/ has a lot of people not willing to change even if it's just small stuff, it speaks volumes of your maturity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are pretty far gone.<br>You remind me of my Parents saying that gta makes children violent</br></br>  Is there no onein this thread which enjoys this show without some SWJ bullshit  <br>I don't understand how you equate my saying "this character is a degenerate" with "watching this show makes you a degenerate". I never said that, and if I somehow led you to believe that I did I sincerely apologize because that was not my intent.<br><br>I'm actually at odds with SJW.

It's a gag manga, it intends for you to find the girls cute, and laugh at the interactions between the characters with Umaru's dual/triple personality being a vehicle for that as well as being wish fulfillment. <br><br>I dropped NGNL and I don't remember what happens.</br></br></br>  NEET lifestyle may be nice for a moment but I don't know how you can handle it for more than a few weeks. You just turn into a larva riddled with bad habits and don't take advantage of the massive amounts of free time available.  <br>What made you think that we send people back to /v/ because they're NEETs? <br>We send them back to /v/ because even a monkey can tell how they post and the retarded discussions they bring. <br><br>Also, /a/ is not a NEET board, /a/ is a board to talk about anime and manga.</br></br></br></br>  I'm educated and have received training, but I'm still stuck with my minimum wage part-time job.<br><br>So does that make me a NE?</br></br>  <br>Do they love you that much, they are paying for their child's whims? Or they just let you live in the basement and spend minimum amount of money to keep you alive?</br>  <br>I've stopped trying to make sense of it.</br>  <br>In school? Not a NEET.<br>Have a job? Not a NEET.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't a guard position in a monitor center an ideal job since you just literally have to sit in place and wait for something to happen?</br></br>  <br> /a/ is not a NEET board <br>but anime is a NEET medium</br></br>  <br>They just pay for the extra food/utilities I take up, nothing more.</br>  If you're in college for a non-STEM field, You are a Psuedo-NEET  <br>Wouldn't there be a camera watching you though?</br>  <br>A lot of things can be a NEET medium if you're dedicated enough.</br>  Why do NEETs get triggered and start dumping cartoon CP so often?  <br>This. Anything else than STEM is high school with more freedom and useless education.</br>  it speaks to all of us here even if we like it or not  <br> STEM fields <br>*tip</br></br>  <br>just live in germany, if you don't find a job you willl get free money. You will have to write several applications per month and if someone offers you a job you are forced to take it though, but that never happened to me before.</br>  <br>but anime is largely only watched by NEETs, only ~10-20% of anime is non-NEET anime.</br>  <br>Enjoy your useless education</br>  <br>They're retarded and actually think it makes people go away from his board. Or maybe they just want this thread deleted</br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I'd think.</br>  NEETing out is fun, but it stops being fun if you NEET out every day.<br><br>variety is the spice of life</br></br>  <br>This scene was so good</br>  <br>Not even I have as many piss bottles as her</br>  <br>I don't even know if this some triggered NEET or triggered employed anon.<br><br><br>Have you ever had any thoughts about changing your lifestyle, any remorses?

Actually, I get money from playing in random places, so some of my spending is payed by moi. The rest of it(food, water and furnishing) is from their pockets. Sorry if this didn't make sense in English, my brain is kinda foggy now.</br>  <br>NEETs are like 2 orders of magnitude more likely to be pedophiles than nonNEETs, at least on 4chan</br>  <br>And that's why diapers are superior.</br>  Too bad this douche is posting nsfw on blue board.

No wonder half the cast wants her.</br>  LN where   MC will have all the girls wanting his dick even Kajou. <br>It's gonna happen isn't it.</br>  I demand a picture of Saotome from the ending.  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Well, probably not honesty. <br>Hyouka doesn't really have the hots for the MC it looks like. She just REALLY wants to know how babies are made for the sake of biology.<br><br>Otome has a thing for Anna and will probably end up with Gorilla-kun by the end if he doesn't end up a fag for the MC<br><br>Right now it just looks like Pure maiden with a semen demon inside her and Super Lewd main girl<br><br><br>Someone will post a better version but make due with this for now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does someone have smug reaction faces from this episode?  <br><br> Kajou, Otome and Anna femdom <br> Kajou, Anna and Hyouka female rape <br> trap Tanukichi <br> reverse trap Kajou <br><br>I don't think it matters, because they are writing themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delectable, thank you.</br>  <br>Shimoneta is one of the most popular shows airing this season, of course its going to get doujins</br>  <br>The only thing that comes to mind honestly is slut carnivore.</br>  <br>Vagina heart eyes</br>  It's finally time.  Why do so many people shit on this show? It's decent at the very least.  <br>No, it isn't.<br>It's extremely unpopular on pixiv and also unpopular on 2ch<br>Where are you getting this claim of popularity from?</br></br></br>  <br>You mean Anna want it in her ana.</br>  <br>because 90% of /a/ have shit taste, so they hate good shows like this one.</br>  <br>Her succubus blood awakened, now she has to live of semen.</br>  <br>It's decent at the very best.</br>  <br> and will probably end up with Gorilla-kun by the end <br>Please. Tiny girl with BigMcLargeHuge makes sets off my kokoro.</br></br>  <br>Because some anons insist it's AOTS.<br>I wonder if they are actually the same anons, calling it AOTS to stir shit up and then joining in to call it shit.</br></br>  I want her to fuck me with that expression.  <br>And you just gave me a boner I was completely unprepared for.</br>  <br>The love triangle is set.</br>  <br>I want her to hump my table</br>  <br>From another anon from another thread<br>I think it was a Joukamachi or Gangsta Thread? not sure, anyways the point is that i concluded that since they have a pretty strong Pixiv scene , they in return should get good ammount of doujins. I was declined, saying that pixiv is mostly just teenagers and doujins going by populartiy and sales. You cant just compare pixiv sizes and conclude x amounts of doujins. <br><br>Judgind by activity on threads, i'd say that GATE and Shimoneta should get the most doujins but i dont have any statistics on it. Its mostly observation and experience on my part. What do you think should get the most doujins from this season?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually fapped to that scene.<br>Was I the only one?</br></br>    <br>Given whatever I see in the catalog, I can pretty much agree<br><br>It's a bit messy, I'll admit, but still entertaining<br><br>Off-topic but what other animes this season are people calling AOTS?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice image taste</br>  <br> botnet browser </br>  <br> Kajo will never facefuck you under the table with her cock </br>  <br> botnet </br>  <br> Goriki, passu! <br> Goriki, catch! <br>I think Funi is doing it on purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>Most likely not.<br>Here's to hoping she does more table humping and other dirty jokes that just comes off as erotic than funny.</br></br>  I want a lolihat.  sex when?  <br>I don't understand why the table humping makes me rock hard.</br>   That voice <br>welp, time to mute</br>  <br><br> bubble effect is supposed to create the illusion of nudity by covering all visable clothing <br> we can tell that this isn't the case, and that they are completely naked <br><br>my<br><br>fucking<br><br>dick<br><br>this show is so perfect</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You want to self insert.</br>  <br>You should use an equalizer  to make her voice louder </br>  <br>I'll insert my penis in your anus if you know what I'm saying.</br>    <br><br><br>But, but, chrome..........</br></br></br>  <br>She reminds me of non-non abit. a horrible VA attempting to imitate non-non that is.</br>  <br> welp, time to fap <br>FTFY you flaming faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>There seems to be a tumor pressing on the part of your brain that affects hearing.</br></br>  <br>Are you homosexual?</br>  <br>Pretty sure it's a pussy.

Have it yell constantly at your groin?</br>  I need a webm from that scene. Now.  <br>here</br>  <br>None. She's too pure for that.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot, mate.</br>  <br>Its a whole new subgenre of bubble effect, where the characters are actually nude, but rather than using the bubble effect to emphasis skin via covering clothes, it emphasizes it by BEING the clothes! It could be even greater than normal bubble effect, as it allows for any variety of bubbles without worrying about covering clothing up</br>  <br> Satomi Arai's smug voice <br>Perfect</br></br>  <br>Hey fuck you Scott</br>  <br> /v/ </br>  <br>You easy nigga</br>  FUCK YES!<br>He's slowly but steadily falling for SexyKajo</br>  <br><br> Having to wait for more than a week for awakened semen demon, tender femdom, and cooch cookies <br><br>So this is what hell feels like</br></br></br></br>    <br>the only thing im worried about is the drama and pervert terrorist doing terrorist things will happen in later episodes<br>at least that was the LNfags says</br></br>  <br>why not get both?</br>    <br> drama and pervert terrorist doing terrorist things  <br>No fun stuff?</br></br>  Anyone still got that table humping webm from last episode?  Nooooo!!!  <br>I doubt it, Anna has that slutty aura, like she'll just want to suck cock no matter the person while Kajo looks more like the "Lewd on the outside but pure on the inside" type.</br>  Goddamn, those adorable tiny hands. The Satori Arai voice and old man speech make her even better. The only annoying thing about her is the fact that she was thrown at Goriki's face and became her hat, which will lead to people pairing them and posting that picture of the hamster with a banana yet another time. Please don't let this happen, I'm tired of it.<br>Oh and for fuck's sake Funimation, what the hell is up with all the stupid localization in your script for this show. It's making me go as low as wishing Commie subbed this.<br><br>Also, hello there, ultraboner.</br></br></br>  <br> Kajo's perspective on sex and love <br>She's the truly pure one, anon. It was only a matter of time.</br></br>  <br>here</br>  <br>Bless you anon</br>  <br> Satori <br>And this is what I get for not doublechecking my posts when I'm this tired.</br></br>  <br> what the hell is up with all the stupid localization in your script for this show. <br>They're called dubtitles. They're using the script for their upcoming dub instead of translating the Japanese dialogue.</br></br>  Don't mind me I'm just posting a picture of acorns.  Anna is prime example why having a daughter is a nightmare.<br><br>Cute, sweet being until THAT ONE DAY when she turns into cock slut.</br></br>  <br>well it looks pretty indecent to me</br>  <br> this is part of the opening for each episode <br><br>Nigga did you not see gorilla-san's face when he saw MC.

Hiryuu might also not have the terrible Funimation localization as well.</br>  <br>Are all girls best girls in this show?<br>Damn</br></br>  I know what will happen.<br><br>MC's fetish/drive is purity that is why he has been chasing Anna.<br><br>Now that Anna went turbo slut, he will gradually start to crumble.<br><br>Then he will see that Kajo is all bark and no bite to save the society and in reality she is super pure and prude when it comes to real thing.<br><br>So end game will be best girl Kajo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love corruption to lewd and all but she goes down too quickly.<br>I want to see her struggling between "morality" and lewd thoughts.</br></br>  <br>clawhammer for the fast. Hiryuu for the better quality 4 days later. HS is bad but watchable but not in shimoneta. the extra censoreing is killing me and i strongly advice to stop watching HS for shimoneta</br>  <br> single-cour LN anime <br> end game <br>No one's hooking up in this show.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant less censored than funi/horrishit like they censored handjob gestures and shit like that. but I guess all raws are without it so gonna wait for BDs prolly.<br>just like every other fucking show<br>every god damn season</br></br></br>  <br>The problem here is she doesn't know what lewd thoughts are. She isn't just pure because she steers away from lewdness, shes pure because shes completely clueless to anything sexual, even basic bodily functions or the effects of puberty. She's an animal basically, that has just been awakened to the pleasures of the body, without even knowing. Shes running on pure, raw, carnal instinct.</br>  <br>To struggle she would have to understand what is happening.<br><br>She is a huge slut without the knowledge of what is sex/pleasure.<br><br>So when MC kissed her she went overdrive and wants to reenact this pleasure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The gestures aren't censored on AT-X, for the most part that I remember at least. There's still a few stickers here and there, however, and the audio is still censored.</br>  <br>For some reason I would be really okay with that.<br><br>Female sex seems pure in comparison to hot dickings.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that you think hot dickings isn't pure, it's just you don't like the idea of your daughteru being dicked by some shitty punk or asshole.</br>  Is this an adaption from the mango/LN?  <br>Yeah, maybe that.<br><br>Fuck I am going to lock her in a tower and just send her HDDs with anime on it</br></br></br>  Hiryuu worth waiting for? Archiving/watching funi releases makes me want to vomit my intestines.<br><br>Then again everything I watch releases fucking wednesday for some reason which also seems to be when hiryuu releases.</br></br>    <br> She grows up to be a filthy, disgusting fujoshi </br>  <br>Since I'm pretty sure we all know the answer as to what's in that test tube, there's the obvious followup question.<br><br>From where (of from who) did she get it?</br></br></br>  <br>How else, she squeezed it out of mc</br>  <br><br>What would she want with a duck? All they do is quack and dance ballet...</br></br>  <br><br>Cream-pie</br></br>   entire society centered on protecting people from anything with the slightest hint of lewdness <br> accident happens <br> people become super ultra turbo sluts 2015: arcade edition <br>Excuse me jap gubmint, but I think there might be a flaw in your plan</br></br></br>  <br>I think Clawhammer and Hiryuu are both uncensored, or at least as far as it gets.<br><br>Not sure which one makes the better subs though.</br></br></br>  <br>and thats why its so good.</br>  <br>so the least uncensored version is hiryuu?</br>  <br>Damn, those must be some real perky nipples.</br>  <br>Until BDs.</br>  Is it just me or hiryuu is really shit, they fucked up a lot of things. Like fucking funi got more shit right than them. I'll stick with clawhammer for now I guess, so much for the blue.  <br>b-but i don't use Chrome</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br>How big are the censorship differences anyway? I've seen the mushroom paizuri pic, but I can't really think of anything that was censored that I'd particularly care to see.</br>  <br>Clawhammer does their own script too?</br>  <br>I doubt that will last for more than two episodes max</br>  <br>How am I supposed to go on living now that I'm painfully aware that Kajo will never forcibly facefuck me under the table with her cock until she cums down my throat? Hold me /a/, it hurts so much.</br>  <br> drama <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Love triangle between MC, Ayame and Anna</br>  <br> raws <br> picture is subbed <br>HOW????????</br></br></br>  <br>Senketsu Subs + Ohys AT-X RAW. all clawhammer does is combine them and post it. TS looks a little ugly, but at least it isn't comeme</br>  <br>If I hold you  I might facefuck you under the table until I cum down your throat.  <br><br>Would that take the hurt away even a little?</br></br></br>  <br>you're forgetting Artists and Gorilla. this is turning into a harem.</br>  <br> Love triangle drama <br>Why can't we have a regular lewd comedy that doesn't feel the need to throw in some romance crap. This kind of shit only derails things.</br></br>  <br>Remember, they list what doujins are being released on Comiket.</br>  <br>I'm just sad that Hyouka isn't part of it.</br>  How do we fix Shimoneta?<br><br>Besides removing Kajo and making Anna the MC, that's obviously a given.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>By removing you</br>  <br>Especially when Kajo is so literally perfect and has fun interacting with MC. Anna is just a moeblob for him to fawn over and I can't see turning lewd making her any more fun..</br>  <br> remove all censoring even though it's   part of the comedy within it <br> add English dubs <br> Okuma voiced by a girl <br><br>MAL, /v/, /a/, /tv/ and /u/ approved show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> making her lewd <br> fun <br>Pick both.

Someone is stalking Tanukichi. The plan was that Tanukichi writes a note 'I accept you' and puts it on his door and if anything bad happens Ayame will intervene. Saotome hides in a closet so she can see and draw everything. The stalker was actually Anna, She kisses him and plays with his dick. He didn't even pop a boner. At the beginning Ayame told him that she is Anna's best friend and will help them get together. There is no drama.</br></br>  <br>Stop typing like a fucking idiot.</br>  <br> If they made the teletubbies, one would get hit by a truck, another will be forced to accept an arranged marriage, third will die of common cold and fourth will kill itself since it was in love with the other 3 <br>But anon, this would make the teletubbies actually good.</br></br>  <br>also trying it out as well</br>  <br> u <br> lil <br>Go away.</br></br></br>  After seeing a bunch of people asking in threads for a couple days now I decided to do this little edit. But since I'm illiterate with computers it took me good fucking 20 minutes and I fucked up with the subs because I noticed them only when I split each frame.

CIA says "I'm CIA", as if the organisation is his name, instead of something sane like "I'm from the CIA".

It has a large standing army that needed to be kept occupied. There was a portal, scouts claim the citizens on the other side don't appear to be armed. The Empire went and did Empire things.<br><br>The Empire had no choice, they have so many soldiers that they can't support them via taxes alone. And they can't just disband them as then they become bandits or rebels. Once you have an army you basically have to keep sending them out until they shrink to a manageable size again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A mischievous god open the gate to nipland<br>NotRoman Empire being Empire and decided to invade<br>???<br>Profit</br></br></br></br>  <br> and how does technology do against magic guys <br>In Gate magic is quite powerful. But it is a scarce resource and under-developed. And non-divine beings have very limited magic power, thus it is not practical to use them in the army.</br></br>  <br>ah sounds kinda like how ancient Rome crumbled<br><br>so does technology do well<br><br>I guess they can't send planes or something through the gate or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They can send planes but anything reliant on GPS is fucked (since the sattelites aren't there)<br><br>So they mostly use old equipment (and still steamroll the not-Romans)</br></br></br></br>  <br>The empire must have been retarded to get into that situation.</br>  <br> so does technology do well <br> I guess they can't send planes or something through the gate or something? <br>Even Roman technology is superior to magic.

It didn't need to constantly conquer new lands to keep functioning. The western half of the empire collapsed because it allowed barbarian tribes to move in while retaining their political organization and military structure with just a promise to serve the emperor. This was due to military weakness on the empire's part. As a result it was easy for them to simply declare independence and carve out kingdoms of their own.</br>  <br>This guy knows what's up.</br>  <br>Set of images leading up to that point.<br><br>It doesn't even show the dragon breathing flame.

These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD. Previously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome. <br><br>ASD can be associated with intellectual disability, difficulties in motor coordination and attention and physical health issues such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. Some persons with ASD excel in visual skills, music, math and art.<br><br>Autism appears to have its roots in very early brain development. However, the most obvious signs of autism and symptoms of autism tend to emerge between 2 and 3 years of age. Autism Speaks continues to fund research on effective methods for earlier diagnosis, as early intervention with proven behavioral therapies can improve outcomes. Increasing autism awareness is a key aspect of this work and one in which our families and volunteers play an invaluable role.<br>SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SO YOU ARE THE ONE AUTIST WITH YOUR IROHA PICTURES AND SCREENCAPS FUCKER!"!! <br>How fucking angry must a human being be to actually write this.

I agree that it looks jarring at times but it is getting better and hopfully Sunshine will reap the benefit.<br><br>The reason for not going full CG like Aikatsu because people want to see their idols looking great in 2D during close-ups. Some of the most beautiful shots in LL are those close-ups while original im@s in comparison has 2d but mediocre + low frame rate close-ups. <br><br>When LL actually has full 2D animation during Arise's performance, it's better than anything A-1 can muster in im@s.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See . Just ignore them, they're obsessed with shitposting about LL.</br>  <br>Yes, now let post some Harasho!</br>  <br>Bring over some goodness to /a/<br>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u<wbr>/107422505/dream%20sensation%20enco<wbr>re%20animation.mp4</wbr></wbr></br></br>    ITT: fanboy wars <br>I liked both CG and LL. Both are good and both have their retarded moments.<br><br> I fucking hated the 3D models in LL, at least Cinderella Girls had the decency of animating their choreography and not use 3D models out of nowhere. </br></br></br>  While exploring a Dungeon, you find a Captive Dark Elf, What to you do?  <br>[ALL FICTION]</br>  <br>But Siegried was actually one of the more reasonable and non biased members of the Order of the Flaming Rose.</br>  <br>Anyone reasonable knows that elves are a disease</br>  <br> Siegried <br>Fuck you too F key, you punk bitch.</br></br>  <br>But they're a disease that can be used for cheap prostitution and housekeeping. Train them well enough and they can even make good nursemaids for your pureblooded children. I suggest letting your son lose his virginity to one of your loyal elf retainers so that he can practice for his wedding night when he marries a good, noble human girl.</br>  No overlord thread? Papa Bones won't be pleased about that<br>   :D </br>  <br>:D</br>  <br>Rolling for Rock Star character fighting with the power of music.</br>  <br>http://crossfade.io/#!/zmtnt7j93j</br>  <br> daily overlord threads <br>animefags please leave</br></br>  <br> Dante <br> Sense of Justice: 100  <br>wut</br></br></br>  So I thought about something: Should we make a /a/ approved font pack together? We could start with the redhawkscans/imperialscans font pack/list and then go further  <br>I think that's rather random, at the least I didn't notice any kind of pattern yet.</br>  <br>They only really show up at the weekends though</br>  So how's the process to get HQ raws from a raw provider?  <br>Well firstly your raw provider should have a scanner and now how to use it.</br>  <br>They pop up often during the week but don't last. They last longer on weekends.</br></blockquote>]
