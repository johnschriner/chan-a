NNB was the most well-executed iyashikei anime since ARIA, and it had its own unique charm to it with some unusual scenes for the genre owing to its rural setting. GochiUsa is literally a KinMosa clone. That's not to say it's bad, as I like it, because it's fucking kawaii and I love me some kawaii nigga, but it's not something special and unique like NNB.</br></br>  <br> No Nichibros <br>Shit POWER RANKINGS list</br></br>  <br> NNB unique <br>It's just your average SOL about schoolgirls, the only unique thing about it its the rural setting.<br> GochiUsa is literally a KinMosa clone <br>Did you even watch Gochiusa? it has nothing in common with the shallow characters of Kinmoza, and its setting is obviously more unique.<br><br>But is not like I hope you understand when you have shit like GJ-BU over YnS or Gochiusa.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> ACTUALLY expecting a random anonymous on /a/ to watch plotless SoL for a reason other than cute girls </br></br></br>  <br>This is fake.</br>  <br>noone remembers hyakko</br>    <br><br>It was fun.

I was having a really shitty day and I watched this and it just brightened it right up. Is it bad that I feel kind of sorry for Ren chon because of how small and shitty her school is? That entrance part where they sang made me feel sad.  <br>I really disliked Hyakko.</br>  <br> Ranking SOL <br>Shit taste</br></br>  <br> that entrance part where they sang made me feel sad <br>Me too. It had a really melancholic vibe. And showing all the scenery while they sang just made it feel even worse for some reason.<br>Not a healing moment.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>For real? I thought it was nice and soothing. Obviously they will miss out on a lot of things but they get a much more unique school experience compared to the other 98% of nips.<br>Those stills were fucking beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good luck trying to be better than the best 4-minute anime of all time bitches.</br>  <br>Please, Teekyuu is way better.</br>  Hold on, I thought this was a sequel but this is an alternate universe to the first Non Non Biyori season?<br><br>I mean, I doubt I could ever have enough Non Non Biyori but... why?</br></br>  <br>It's an endless eight type of thing. Like Yuru Yuri they are always stuck in the same year.</br>  <br><br>Why did this never get a full-length tv show?</br></br>  <br>Working S3 is native 1080p. With someone on Twitter saying that KyoAni is working on 2.5k for their next movie.</br>  <br> Shit is hard to get through. <br>Watched it in a day<br><br> have fun actually sitting down and watching it these days <br>I watched it very recently for the first time and really enjoyed it.<br><br> ika musume at the bottom <br>Ika Musume is mostly bland.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Unfortunately for NNB, it doesn't matter if it is native 1080p until we get the bds. CR's 1080p stream is still shitty bitrate.  <br><br>Are power rankings still a /sp/ only thing?</br></br>  <br>I still don't comprehend what mental glitch the makers of Re-Kan suffered from to make their show as low-res as possible.<br><br><br>This SOL power ranking has been existing for years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it actually or is this conjecture based off the first episode? It seems more likely that it was just setting up the next few episodes or it's going to show the other things that happened throughout the first year.</br>  <br>That's what I got from this too. I don't remember seeing Renge's entrance ceremony before. I expect this to mostly jump around the timeline showing things we haven't seen while throwing bits in we have seen previously to give us context.</br>  <br> KyoAni is working on 2.5k for their next movie. <br>The Free! prequel?</br></br>  <br>Really? Why? Show was harmless at worst, I liked a lot of the characters.</br>  <br><br>The only thing accurate on any of these stupid lists is the first spot, everything else below ARIA is subjective.</br></br>  <br>Well that was lovely, not as good as aiura but still great.</br>  <br>Knowing how small events ended in Hidamari and then watching the lead up made them even more sweet and comfy, especially the one of Yuno drawing the exhibition piece, when we already knew she fell asleep at it and didn't finish it, along with what Miya drew.<br>I don't remember there being a lot of missing pieces for NNB to do this with though.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, just everything bothered me about it. The voice acting, the characters and the fucking last two episodes that seemed really out of place.<br>I still ended up watching all of it but I hated myself for doing so.</br></br>  <br> watched 6 cours of boring ass anime in one day <br>Suuure.</br></br>  That song, the greenery. Bliss  MY BODY IS READY<br><br>MY SOUL IS READY<br><br>LET THE HEALING BEGIN</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni's OPs and EDs are in 1080. The rest of the shows are below that.</br>  <br><br><br> [citation needed] </br></br></br>  Do you think it was meant to be intentionally confusing about when this episode takes place? There are numerous things that indicate that Renge and the others have yet to begin the initial school semester but despite that, almost everyone took some time to realize it wasn't after the first season/OVA.  <br>You must be pretty fucking retarded to not realize.</br>  What is this expression trying to convey?<br><br><br>You're just stupid. I knew almost immediately because they weren't in Okinawa and Hotarun didn't show up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him but I didn't realize Hotarun wasn't there</br></br>  <br>Source is a blog that gets posted here. And quite often mind you. You should know that.</br>  <br> because they weren't in Okinawa <br><br>The OVA didn't really make it feel like they were ever going to show them physically there.</br></br></br>  <br><br> the non nons go to okinawa <br> they get raped by american soldiers </br></br></br>  <br>If that was the case, people wouldn't argue about the source resolution in this thread.</br>  <br>Dude, it's not 1945 anymore.</br>  <br>Wait, non non biyori got an OVA?</br>  <br>It was instantly made very clear that Renge hadn't started her first year of school yet. I'm surprised anyone was confused.</br>  <br>Nii-san wins a trip to Okinawa and they spend the episode preparing for it. Yes.<br><br><br>There were quite a few posts that showed utter confusion about it. I was misled at first but it didn't take long to figure it out.</br></br></br></br>  This is fucking boring.  <br>Why was she so lewd?</br>  <br>It is technically true but not anymore.<br>https://ultimatemegax.wordpress.com<wbr>/2015/04/24/photography-and-resolut<wbr>ion-of-anime/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>yeah well, that's just like your opinion, man</br>  <br>Aria is the best if you plan to use it to go to sleep, shit is crazy boring.</br>   climbfus not SoLOT4ever   <br>It wasn't clear to me at first, but it was pretty clear after that. I am a little bit slow.</br>  Am I the only one that realized this?  <br>same here. Not to mention, It's been such a long time since I last seen the show, that it took me a while to remember where it left off</br>  <br>oh shit...</br>  <br>I understand now.</br>  <br> trying this hard <br>Get back into the oven, jew.</br></br>  <br>Great. A fucking cancerous Toronto faggot shitting up another NNB thread.<br>Go back to /v/</br></br>  <br>It would appear our 576p expert in the thread has been BTFO. According to Anibin even the original NNB season 1 was 720.</br>  <br>They can save the Okinawa trip for the later half of the series, that arc should already be finished in the manga.</br>  <br><br>http://anibin.blogspot.de/2015/04/1<wbr>_28.html<br>Not that anon but i think it says Hibike is animated in 1699x955.5 (OP and ED in 1080p).</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Did you even bother to read the blog that I posted.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Why is K-on! always so high on the list?

I swear to fucking Christ you are worse than lelouch.</br>  <br> tiring <br>See anon, that's your mistake.</br></br>  <br>My problem with NNB is real people dont act that way in the country side. Way to innocent.<br>For example children are taught and shown to kill farm animals for an early age. <br>Family punishments are generally harsh, there's like no caning scene to the point they have bleeding marks.<br>There are no male point of view.<br>Its just cutesy delusional shit imo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I wanted realism, I'd watch a documentary.</br>  <br> cutesy delusional shit imo. <br>Is this your first day watching anime?</br></br>  Isn't every anime slice of life? Every anime is a slice of peoples life. Dragonball is Gokus slice of life.  <br>That is implying that what he is saying is indeed true. I don't know where he comes from but what the country side I grew up we never learned to kill animals and family punishments were not specially hard. I do think his point of vue is outdated.</br>  <br><br><br>Like i was saying these shouldnt be called "slice of life"</br></br></br>  <br>Do you even know what slice of life means?</br>  <br>Considering he uses "imo" he's obviously new here.</br>  <br>I dont know, you tell me?</br>  <br>Best healing anime, K-ON is the best SoL</br>  <br>K-ON is fucking horrible.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure Slice of life means depicting protential real life (coming of age) situations, scenarios and experiences in anime.</br></br>  <br> K-ON <br> remotely good <br><br>I want you to kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>realistic, look it up too. definitely fits the definition. if you want a dramatic horror, go watch higurashi</br>  <br><br>I-i liked it.</br></br>  any other groups subbing this or do i have to subject myself to horriblesubs  <br>Don't worry, it's one of the best SoL around.</br>  <br><br>Your opinions are wrong</br></br>  <br>ok, komeiji</br>  <br> only one person has ever liked k-on <br>okay</br></br>   Ctrl F "Clannad" <br> 0 results <br><br>You all make Ushio cry.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, no results for Hyouka.<br><br>/a/ confirmed for shit taste  if it hadn't already beenconfirmed thousands of times before. </br></br></br>    <br> Clannad <br> SoL <br>You are so stupid it hurts.</br></br></br>  <br>It is SoL though.<br><br>A SoL show can have fantastical elements within it, it's called Magical Realism.<br><br>That's why Nichijou is SoL despite having robots and talking cats and why Chuunibyou is SoL despite epic imaginary magical girl battles.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hidamari that low <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br> epic </br>  <br>I believe the word fitting here, since that was clearly what the characters themselves were imagining them to be.</br>  <br><br> unironically thinking Kinmosa was good tier SoL </br></br>  <br>GochiUsa was average, I don't understand all the hype.</br>  Technically, all Anime is Slice of Life.<br><br>Some lives are just more exciting than others.</br></br>   haven't watched most of the shows mentioned in this thread <br>My backlog hurts</br>  It is for me, Nothing comes close to it.<br><br>The sensei of SoL's.</br></br>  <br>GochiUsa was sexy as fuck</br>   ctrl f <br> mushishi <br> no results <br>It is a sad day.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it's not a SOL?<br>It has supernatural elements, it doesn't take place in the world we live in.

It was just a group of girls living this life on this other planet.<br>You could say it's the same with Ginko, but every episode revolves around this supernatural being and drama arises from it in every episode and that's just not SOL.</br></br>  <br>It is slice of life.

I'm pretty ignorant in terms of setting up this shit.</br>  <br> Is this really a DxD thread? <br><br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br>https://imouto.my/madvr/<br>http://haruhichan.com/KCP <br><br>Use imouto's guide, it's highly comprehensive. There are a few good tips in the download thread itself, too. <br><br>Rule of thumb: change your madVR settings while playing a random anime, Ctrl+J to open the display statistics, Ctrl+R to reset them. Every thing you change, play a little (in full screen if they are upscale settings) of a demanding sequence (high bitrate) (usually openings and battles work best) and check the dropped frames, delayed frames and presentation glitches. It's normal to have a couple dropped frames when you first play, skip or change from windowed to fullscreen, but if the numbers keep rising steadily with just regular playback, you have reached the limits of your video card somewhere and gotta dial it down a bit. The trick is finding the best config your card can handle without dropping frames.<br><br>On your reducing brightness issue, madVR probably handles that better without you doing anything, but there are more image enhancement settings you can use.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The silly DxDfag cant accept the fact that his threads are total shit.</br>  <br>This look like a DxD thread to you? Also, why the fuck are you implying that? DxD threads always go into shit posting sooner or later.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will try not to fuck up anything.</br></br>  <br>Note that recent madVR has SuperRes, which is better than NNEDI3 (IMO) and uses much less GPU resources.</br>  <br>I'm using it, but it's a setting for further refinement, not the upscale itself. I noticed better results using these SuperRes configs together with NNEDI3 upscaling than without.</br>  <br>Just make sure to throughly uninstall all your codecs and reboot your PC before switching over and installing KCP.</br>  <br>But if you don't have monster SLI setup (I have no idea how much headroom you have at 1080p, I just have a 2560x1440 monitor which makes those upscalers pretty expensive.), then Jinc+SR is much better than just NN3.</br>  <br>Single GTX 980 slightly overclocked. Zero dropped frames after a whole episode of Coalgirls's encode of Kara no Kyoukai with NNEDI3 32 neurons upscaling and 64 neurons image quadrupling. I reached my video card's limit with 32 neurons upscaling, using 64 on it too got me about a frame dropped every 3 seconds.</br>  THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR ANIME MACHINE  <br>Hm, GTX 770 here, I can do 32/16 ok. I couldn't spot a difference between 32/32 in an A/B test and 64/16 is too slow for my card. Jinc+SR gives me very nice results, though it does seem to depend a lot on the source. It looks gorgeous on Hibike for example.<br><br>(NNEDI3 32/16)</br></br></br>  <br> i had a script that would rename things vlcsnap-blahblah and convert them to like 25% jpeg quality. it was lol </br>  <br>(Jinc 3-taps AR + SR)</br>  <br> notvlcsnap <br>Wow anon you sure fooled me.</br></br>  <br>You are running it on 1440p while I am on 1080p though, so you lose in there aswell.</br>  <br>Fillers ruined the season.</br>  <br>Thank you for this. I recently bought a new computer and have had a real bitch of a time trying to set up MPC to get the best visuals and audio I could.</br>  <br>videogames are rendered in real time so super sampling can work, they essentially render everything at a higher resolution and downscale it to your screen.<br><br>for videos they are prerendered and in the case of modern anime its 720p or 1080p. "super sampling" doesnt work because there is no information to sample, a 1080p video has the same amount of information at 1080p as it does as 1440p</br></br></br>  <br>Do keep in mind those settings are specially crafted with anime in mind, it will generally work fine with 3dpd movies and series, but you may get performance hiccups or some other small issues.</br>  <br>I am well aware, I used to closest analogy most well known to people. It shares similarities in that it renders the target media at a higher multiple of your monitor's resolution, then downscales it to increase sharpness.<br>I should probably have gone with the analogy of 'if you zoom in a jpg photo, it looks bad, but if you zoom out and make it smaller, it looks better'.</br></br>   neurons <br>How pretentious</br>  <br> That fang. <br>HNNNNNNNNG</br></br>  <br><br>A good way of explaining it is: Instead of taking your existing image and increasing its size, what it does is instead trying to come up with a larger image that when downscaled gives the original one. This is slower but produces better results.</br></br>  <br>Yo, I got a lower end laptop (2013 stock Dell). The guide on Imouto is obviously meant for computers with HD monitors and really good computers. <br><br>Does anyone have any good settings for a 1366x768 laptop.

What now.</br>  <br>Just like I said, Ctrl+J, change a config, play a little of anime. Check for dropped frames and keep rendering times below 40ms, preferably below 30ms.<br><br>Instead of using double chroma/luma and NNEDI3 stuff, you'll just use Lanczos or Jinc (Jinc is a little heavier). Try all pixel shaders. Keep sharpness high and artifacts/aliasing/ringing low. Keep chroma's sharpness equap or smaller than image's sharpness, never higher. That's pretty much it.</br></br></br>  <br>How about using the anti ringing filter?</br>  <br>Always good but check if it impacts your performance too much. Just keep an eye on frame rendering times and dropped frames.</br>  <br>Does the MC actually fuck anyone? If not, I have no reason to pick this up.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't.</br>  <br>alright thanks.

Look when Kurumi touches Yuki's face with both hands or when Miki touches Kurumi's cheek. And her wounds have been healing (though where she was bit is still bandaged), so we know she's not undead or anything quite yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Well she was in the process of turning into a zombie and that usually means dying. Losing body heat is usually pretty bad too and can easily be lethal. But I guess her body isn't really dead, since she obviously didn't completely turn.</br>  EVERYBODY SAY<br>TOMODACHI DE<br>YOU NE</br></br>  <br> A new GG thread, just as I'm heading off to bed <br><br>In the same boat, I hate it!<br><br><br>She was in the process but she never fully turned nor died, so really its impossible for her arm to be "dead".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not entirely sure our two resident shovelfags aren't in fact the same person</br></br>  The second episode is called Memories, just like the manga.  <br>Hopefully the shitposters will meet their daily shitposting quota before either of us come back.<br><br><br>Just remember, I'm the better one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully they go back to the manga's plot from the anime-original first episode. It was better before Miki showed up.</br>  <br>So I guess that means they'll probably extend the SoL part of chapter 1 to last the entire first episode to have the shocking reveal at the end of episode 1?</br>  <br>W-what are you on about, I'm me!<br>I think.<br><br><br>So, a megu-nee episode?<br><br>Any news about the ED yet? i wanna know if its dark or not already.<br><br><br>Just remember, i was here first and am in fact the better one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It was better before Miki showed up. <br><br>Good I'm not the only one who thinks this.</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br>the wounds are healing and shes doing less shit overall.<br>i legit believe what happened is if you for some fucked reason survive the zombie virus you gain zombielike traits but you actually are still alive.<br>essentially she got the bonus's of a zombie including zombies leaving you the fuck alone, but you don't go quite full zombie.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How can you hate Miki?<br>I'm a massive shovel fag yet i see nothing wrong with Miki.<br><br><br> zombielike traits but you actually are still alive. <br>Well considering the deflected a crossbow bolt with a fucking shovel I'm willing to believe this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, according to people that watched the preview at the screening it's an extended version of chapter 2 of the manga with shovels reminiscing about track boy and how she eventually had to kill him as a zombie.<br><br><br>Yes, the first episode is an extended version of chapter one that ends with the same shot of the destroyed classroom and the zombies wandering outside the school.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't hate Miki. I just preferred the atmosphere and plot before she showed up.</br>  It doesn't even matter if her body is dead or not, because dead little girls are top-tier waifus anyway.<br><br><br>With Rii breaking they now have two mentally fucked people in their group of 4. It's not looking good for them. I'm afraid Rii's hallucinations will get them into deep shit.</br></br></br>  <br> No, according to people that watched the preview at the screening it's an extended version of chapter 2 of the manga with shovels reminiscing about track boy and how she eventually had to kill him as a zombie. <br>Whoa, what? I didn't hear about this. I thoght they only previewed episode 1. Do you have a summary link like that evernote one for the first episode?</br></br>  <br> No, according to people that watched the preview at the screening it's an extended version of chapter 2 <br> Yes, the first episode is an extended version of chapter one <br><br>So they're never going to reach the graduation like that, unless this is 2-cour.<br>I like that they seem to take their time with each chapter, but what would be a logical ending point for 12 episodes then?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh great just everyone wanted, more about shovels dead crush that has zero relevance whatsoever!<br><br>At least it'll keep the yuri fags away.<br><br><br> top-tier waifus <br> using waifu as a word for best girl <br>Stop it.<br><br>Also yes it's very likely that Rii-sans about to break down, and someones going to get hurt because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean the second episode preview; you know, the kind you get after every episode in anime?<br><br><br>But the best scenes and moments have all been after Miki showed up. They greatly amped up the psychological drama elements of the story since the author has been using Miki's normalcy as a counterpoint to the other 3 girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've made it very clear Yuki is fine now.</br>  <br>Nah, only chapters 1 and 2 are extendable. Chapters 3 and 4 should be a single episode since not much happens in them; they can be combined into a single "Teacher" episode.</br>  <br>She was always fine, just pretending. She was clearly aware she had to run from zombies.</br>  <br> using waifu as a word for best girl <br><br>I didn't intend to. Remilia is my one and only waifu but a lot of other undead little girls are great characters too and make great waifus for other anons.<br><br> Oh great just everyone wanted, more about shovels dead crush that has zero relevance whatsoever! <br>Honestly, I'd rather have them do this than rush through the story at 2-3 chapters per episode.<br>The mangaka is directly involved in the anime production, right? I have faith that the anime-original scenes won't be too bad then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What caused Yuki being fine now though?<br><br>Also didn't Yuki still speak to her hallucinations of megu-nee when the girls got the big RV?</br></br></br>  <br>She is pretending even harder than before, the other girls had to remind her of Megu-nee a few times.</br>  <br> I didn't intend to. <br>I see, sorry its just it ticks me off when people do that.<br><br>Also just in case you couldn't tell   the reason it focusing on her crush pisses me off is because Kurumi is my waifu.  <br><br>Though yes the mangaka is involved, though having faith in lerche is kinda pointless. We can only hope for the best.<br><br><br>The started not being completely delusional once she remembered that megu-nee died.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How dense can you be?</br>  <br><br><br>Yuki was always fine - probably. She was clearly sane when she hid from the zombies and she was sane when she took the bat to defend Ri.<br><br>And the other girls had to remind her of Megu a couple of times.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe it was something like she was half sane half not. It was like Megu-nee was created as a stopper to her delusions and helped act out her sanity. <br><br>Or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br> I mean the second episode preview; you know, the kind you get after every episode in anime? <br>So were you there or what? I don't remember seeing stuff about the second epieode preview beyond the title.</br></br>  <br>Pretty dense probably, I read through most of the chapters in a single night and I was tired.<br><br>I understand that Yuki is getting better, but I probably missed a catalyst for her getting better. I guess I kind of expected her to find the corpse of the megu-nee zombie or something for her delusions to end.</br></br></br>  I love Rii-chan  <br>It stopped in that scene where the girls were in the toilets and yuki passed out.<br><br><br>I love Shovel!</br></br></br></br>  <br> when she hid from the zombies <br>Do you not remember when Yuuri said "she'll be fine, megu-nee is with her"? Yuki's subconscious is protecting her, but she isn't fully aware of it. Or at least this is how it was towards the beginning of the manga, when that line was said.</br></br>  <br> Yuki was always fine - probably. <br><br>I'm really not sure, they've shown her run off a few times to go into empty destroyed classrooms to pick up things that weren't there or speak with other students who weren't there. None of the other girls were around, so why would she do it if she was sane?</br></br></br>  <br> that scene where the girls were in the toilets and yuki passed out. <br><br>I'm not sure I remember that scene. <br>When did Yuki pass out? The only toilets scene I remember is the one that led to megu-nee dying.<br>You mean Yuki was perfectly aware of megu-nee being dead the entire time, from the very beginning? That seems a bit weird to me, maybe I should reread a few parts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This page.</br>    Sometimes I wish I wasn't infected in a zombie apocalypse just to see how I would react. Would I stay sane or go full retard? I need to know.      <br>You'd go full retard pretty quick if you were alone. With panic, fear, lack of communication, and all that. I'm sure most people would, actually.</br>  <br>The thing you forget is that /a/nons aren't like most people. We're already alone, and others panicking and afraid won't change too much.</br>  Why do bad things happen to good little girls, /a/?<br>This is terrible.</br>  Threadly reminder to please not let the threads become shit once the anime airs  <br>/a/ would go insane from all of their favorite anime and manga getting canceled then because the authors died.</br>  <br>Because once the bad things go away everyone feels that little bit happier!<br><br>  not in this case though ;_;  <br><br><br>Not much we can do, the people here now may get outspoken my all the anime only fags.<br>And we all know how retarded they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Suicide's always an option.</br>  <br>   not in this case though <br>But daijoubu.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes just knowing going insane is a bad idea is enough to keep you sane.</br>  <br>And then we all hop on the slide again.<br>Why do we always get on that slide.</br></br>  This anime is basically madoka with zombies.  <br>I want everything to be daijobu for her and the others, but I can't see it. She's not actually healed and their situation keeps getting shittier.<br>There may be hope for the other 3 since they're not infected, but shovel is a different story.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's the WIXOSS of zombie anime, which is to say it's the Jurassic Park, Akagi, To Aru Majutsu no Index, One-punch Man, Uchiha Madara, Scooby Doo, and Dora the Explorer of anime.</br>  How many more days until disappointment of the season?  So they found the same boxes that the school shelter had in radio-girls house, yet radio girl died because she got infected.<br><br>So what does this mean?<br>-Radio girl didn't have the medicine and died because she got infected earlier on the day the girls came to visit her.<br>-Radio girl was infected much earlier and used the medicine, but ran out of it and turned the day the girls came to visit her.<br>-Radio girl didn't believe in anyone coming to visit her and stopped taking the medicine despite still having some. In that case the message she left behind makes no sense though.<br><br>Am I missing something?<br>I'm trying to piece things together, but I'm confused. They mentioned that the whole house looked like someone anticipated the outbreak and the boxes they found in the house seem to support that theory, so how did radio-girl die if she knew about the outbreak and had the supplies?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are there new chapters? Last time I read a chapter was in May.  <br>35 is the latest translated chapter. I think.<br><br>Apparently people are having a hard time finding raws for 36.<br>37 is the latest japanese chapter, as far as I know. I might be wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it doesn't work forever, like your body adapts to it and you become immune to it.</br>  <br>Radio girl's been infected for as long as they started hiding, and only finally succumbed to the infection when they arrived.<br>So using that amount of time, one can predict how long Shovel has left until the medicine becomes pointless and they have to put her down.<br><br> They should've kept the gun. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Raws in Korean (are they raws, or korean fan-translations?) for 36 and 37 are both on that one korean site, been linked several times in these threads. Hopefully English version out soon.</br></br>  There's going to be a new OP from episode 2 onward, right?<br><br>Keeping the OP they've shown would be weird.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's most likely a placeholder.</br>  <br>What? Too misleading for you?</br>  <br>Most likely, the fake one has no effort.</br>  <br> She was always fine, just pretending. She was clearly aware she had to run from zombies. <br>Being aware of danger doesn't mean she was fine. What do you think Megu-nee is with her in that scene. She's alone, she doesn't have to hid anything, but she's still not recongnizing reality. She can tell there's something wrong, and that's why "Megu-nee" appears to appease her mind, but she was in a delusional state.<br><br>She started to get better after chapter 29.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want her to die. If she dies I die with her. I've already sent a letter to the mangaka so that he knows he'll be killing me when he kills her off.</br>  <br>I'm afraid this isn't the kind of story where everyone always makes it to the end, anon.</br>  <br> What caused Yuki being fine now though? <br>It was a gradual process. First she started to realize that she was isolated from the others. They were always doing shit she didn't know and such, and she started to have dreams about them leaving her behind (pic related). <br><br>Then in chapter 29 she encounters a zombie when she's alone, and at first her mind interprets him as a normal student, but when he's too close she recognizes the danger and kills him. After that she suddenly starts to see the school for what it really is and breaks down crying. Basically the shock snapped her out of her delusion, but her mind was already predisposed as she was starting to feel isolated from the other girls because of her delusions.</br></br></br></br>  I haven't read this but the twin tails girl looks like my waifu noire. Is this anime going to be a disappointment?   yfw Lerche actually deliver <br> yfw it sells well enough to guarantee a second season </br>  <br>The manga is great, go and read it now.<br>The anime is probably going to be bad, but most of us still can't wait for it to finally air.</br></br>  <br>It's bland and generic, but it doesn't look bad</br>  Oh wow  <br> S2 is anime original <br> show becomes HotD with lolis <br> bus orgy cult <br><br><br>Hopefully they keep the OP.

Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school, meets genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate. Kobayashi takes an interest in Akechi and, in spite of his friend Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant. <br> Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school <br> a boy <br> that ass </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the fanservice is on title pages and covers. The chapters themselves has little fanservice.</br>  <br> what are talking about? <br><br>He's probably the guy who wants to start a fanbase war between Gakkou Gurashi and Monstergirls. It's not the first time he posted shit like that.<br>Just ignore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>May be the same case with that heli pilot. He had a syringe in hand. Initially thought it was for any infected survivor that he's going to rescue, but if you think about it, there's no point in breaking that syringe just because you can't find the survivors. That's why the heli wobbled and crashed perhaps. It was a deliberate action in desperate and depressing times.</br>  <br>Fucker was infected. The medicine was for him, and he lost control before he could use the medication.<br><br>The medicine does not last for very long, it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>Faggot.<br><br>Not really, retard. I don't give a shit about 4chin latest memes</br></br></br>  <br>It could mean many things. He could have forgotten. To take his meds and broke it once he turned, he might have broke it because he was upset it didn't work.</br>  <br>The way I understood that scene is that the pilot was infected himself and needed the medicine. He didn't break the syringe deliberately, it was an accident, and then the helicopter crashed because his infection started acting up again.</br>  <br> I'm afraid this isn't the kind of story where everyone always makes it to the end, anon. <br>We're 37 chapters in and everyone's still alive. I'd say the odds of everyone getting to the end alive are pretty good.<br><br>I wouldn't rule out all of them dying in the last chapter though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally think he turned before using the meds.<br><br>He broke the syringe because he lost control of his hands.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Exactly the point. Seems like the meds don't last forever. Its more like a suppressant rather than a cure. So we know what'll happen to Shovel, right?<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Originally I thought he broke it because there were no survivors. Then he crashed his copter because he was so upset he wanted to burn all the zombies for what he thinks killed he the girls.<br><br>But then the radio girl showed up and made me think the medicine stopped working for him and he broke it out of mad.</br></br></br>  <br>So far none of the main girls have died, but several side characters have.<br>Depending on how long the authors plans to make the story it makes sense to not kill off one of the main characters too early.<br>Also Kurumi is already infected with no permanent cure in sight and Rii is currently losing her sanity. I don't think we can rule out the possibility of one of them dying before the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi is as good as dead at this point.</br>  Who's that imouto again? Sorry, can't into moon.  <br>Sanity isn't a problem. We've always had someone that was mentally unhealthy.</br>  <br>Yuki got better though and even while mentally unstable she still avoided danger because she was subconsciously aware of what was happening.<br><br>Rii right now seems to be spiraling into madness and she went into a building full of zombies completely alone at night because her insanity demanded it. I think Yuki was never as much of a risk to the group as Rii is right now.</br></br></br>  <br>But with Yuki, there's Rii to balance out her wacky actions and to guide her, more or less like a manipulator. If Rii lost it, who will take the helm? Shovel is more of an action girl, and she's not going to last long. Yuki? Though she's getting better, seems very doubtful to keep Rii in check.</br>  <br> So far none of the main girls have died, but several side characters have. <br>That's my point. We'll see more side characters dying, but the main are safe for now I think.<br><br> Depending on how long the authors plans to make the story it makes sense to not kill off one of the main characters too early. <br>I don't think the story has legs to be long her than 50 chapters or so, and I'm pretty sure everyone's going to make it.<br><br><br>Good as dead and dead are not the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention she just remembered someone dear to her, and the desire to protect such person intensified. She's really starting to lose it.</br>  It's called drama. Things always get worse before getting better. Rii's losing it now, but she's going to snap out of it eventually. And Kurumi's infected, but we don't know how long she's going to last, or even if she really is going to turn completely.  <br> I don't think the story has legs to be long her than 50 chapters or so <br><br>I don't see it ending so soon.<br>They have 2 big leads right now - the university and that corporation and there's probably going to be a sub-arc for each of those.<br>I'd say it's probably going to be 60-70 chapters and then it wouldn't make sense to kill off a main character so early. If everyone survives the university I'll pobably be convinced, but we're not there yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chances are the uni is where they do all the research, so maybe a cure?</br>  <br> Things always get worse before getting better <br>What if Gakkou Gurashi is a tragedy?</br></br>  <br>Most likely, the university is where those researchers and military are hunkering down at, and the Randall Corp. building is the epicenter of the outbreak.</br>  <br> Yuki nibbling Kurumi's tight. <br>Why is she so cute?</br></br>  <br>Uhh, because she's retarded?</br>  <br>  If she dies I die with her. I've already sent a letter to the mangaka so that he knows he'll be killing me when he kills her off. </br>  REMOVE CATHAT.  Guys, I don't completely understand - little girl from ch. 35 is really exist? Or she just illusion of Yuki and Rii? I see Ch.36 but that Chinese raws ...<br> But some moments in it give a hint that girl don't exist </br>  <br>Its the teddy bear.The scene "showing" her were mostly from Rii pov, panel from outside perspectives are always showing her blocked by windows and shit.</br>  <br>It's probably the teddy Yuki left behind in the building.<br>The reactions of the other girls pretty much give it away. They look really concerned instead of being happy to find another survivor and none of them actually speak to the girl.</br></br>  <br>Rii has gone completely crazy and that will probably cause a major problem for the group soon.<br>Brace for suffering.</br></br>  <br><br>So its like Megu-nee, only this one happens to Rii.</br></br>  <br>I'm thinking they reach university, they scan all the people to make sure they're not infected, see Kurumi is infected and then stuff happens. I doubt they would just let anyone in after all.</br>  <br>Thanks. I think so but want be sure.  Also another hint it's a clean plate in breakfast scene </br>  Why do japs do this? Why can't they just ask "Why?"? Why do they always have to add that "NE? NE?" to their "DOSDEDT"? Is it some kind of autistic call? It isn't cute, and even in a language as cliche and stale like japanese, it's cliche and stale for a woman character losing their cool  <br>Do you have any idea how Japanese works?</br>  On the off chance that someone actually picks this up because he thinks it's a cute SoL - won't that backfire?<br><br>I mean I wouldn't want to see little girls getting hurt and suffering psychological trauma when I was looking for a cute and happy SoL.</br></br>  <br> wouldn't want to see little girls getting hurt and suffering psychological trauma <br><br> not enjoying bullying cute lolis <br> no suffering <br><br>How do you even live</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> not a cute and happy SoL </br></br>  You know wat could make this manga better ?<br><br>Tanks !</br></br>  HQ Version: https://d.maxfile.ro/kykitnvuho.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br> Yuki's face at 1:10 <br>holy shit</br></br>  <br>Are you the guy who always did the same thing in Shirobako threads?</br>  <br>IS NOTHING SACRED TO YOU?</br>  Who is the most huggable gurashi and why is it Mii-kun?  <br>Don't jinx it.</br>  <br>Someone was doing it in the Hibike threads too.<br><br>I'm sure it's not just one person.</br></br></br>  <br>This tanks?</br>  <br> no mod to replace the characters <br>There's one for literally everything else except this manga, where it would actually make sense.</br></br>  I really want the anime to be good.<br><br>I love this manga so much.</br></br>  <br>What would inspire a man to create this?</br>  I like the OP.

So they'll skip the whole trip to the mall and Miki rescue?<br><br>Is there anything else?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zombie or not, Kurumi is still pretty stable.</br>  <br>They just fill up the entire first episode with SoL type stuff so that the reveal is the cliffhanger of sorts.<br><br>Also, Megu-nee's car is in the OP, as is Kei, so the trip will probably happen someway or another.</br></br></br>  <br>If Kei and the trip exist, then I don't see the point of her being there from the start. Just add her to the group like it happened in the manga.<br><br>Is her being with the group from the beginning actually confirmed or is it speculation?</br></br></br>  <br>It's "confirmed" in the sense that a couple of people who watched the pre-screening said as much.</br>  ZR garter loli is best girl.

She is kill.</br>  <br>No because the zombies in the Grade School still reacted to her when she tried to look into the room.</br>  <br>Since the zombies in that grade school were behind the barricade where the survivors should have been - Does that mean those were the zombies of the children that survived the initial outbreak?</br>  <br>Yep, one of them must of gotten nicked or something without anyone else knowing...or probably hid it like that one guy at the mall.</br>  <br>aren't Sentai only do DVD release or am i wrong?</br>    What do you think of the new girls?  <br>I would inseminate the one on the left.</br>  <br>There's gonna be betrayal and it's gonna be awful</br>  <br>They look like sluts.</br>  <br>are there raws for the new chapter?</br>  <br>Sluts.</br>  <br>Untrustworthy harlots.</br>  <br>No. Only Gook shit.</br>  <br>Unfortunately I could only find Korean scans, but the Japanese ones have to exist somewhere.<br><br><br>Black haired one is a total fucking slut.

She's cool</br></br>  <br>who get's shot with the crossbow?</br>  <br>The one in the middle looks like she's from an idolmaster game.</br>   Start from the scene that Yuki is sleeping peacefully in the futon. Taroumaru bring stuffed toy with a beard and cause licking Yuki. Although tries to wake everyone, there are only Yuki to bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of Yuki where Yuki has established a dressed. Yuki is running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. Encounter with the OP after Megu-nee. "It's not Megu-nee" scene. Then follow arrived for the school life club. It has been modified to the scene to eat rice morning by adding the Mii-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of first volume. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Mii-kun is not liked by Taroumaru. Rii-san is scold Taroumaru. Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. Yuki toward the classroom for day duty. Here it can be stopped by to Megu-nee. Shadow is thin (and censored?). Conversation ① of character of image and its entourage two people and the classroom. ② teacher also appeared. <br> Start of classes, as beginning one Volume and even though it is sleep in class, such should be in class junior of Mii-kun comes to the classroom. Yuki can say as no good to come because during class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Mii-kun visited because gone is Taroumaru. Yuki to Mii-kun "Mii-kun are tense. We'll got to nervous from entering the senior" says while walking, but is immediately denied. Looking Taroumaru from here. Yuki say that unraveling tensions in Mii-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Or it is closed windows could not be confirmed, but it was a deliberate sound effect) Here Taroumaru barking of. Headed in the direction in which voice is heard. Here A part end. After there is CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br>  <br> While chasing Taroumaru he go towards the barricades of the desk but then turn to classroom before the barricade. Mii-kun also tries to enter the classroom, but is stopped and is said to be during class to Yuki. Confused look of Mii-kun. Mii-kun to enter the classroom from the greeting. However Taroumaru escape without being grabbed. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taroumaru is directed to the roof. There are Kurumi and Rii-san, Kurumi is joined to said capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel, again Taroumaru distant foot race. But Taroumaru is I get angry in that entered the rooftop garden. Angry also other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life club knowledge part. Because it Tarou capture, scene change to school life club. <br> Put lead in Taroumaru. From here the contents on page 11 to page 19 combined content. Yuki is to classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Mii-kun became worried to act alone was also to be chasing after Yuki. "I like school recently" part. Yuki to be arrive in the classroom and conversation to the characters of ① about Taroumaru. Between here Mii-kun is coming, but as disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of where Yuki roughness of pages 22-23 is at classroom and Mii-kun is a at classroom door. Yuki that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall with Mii-kun, the wind blows. While the wind raging since windows and close the window because it left open has broken windows. So face of Yuki becomes up ed rush. <br><br> ED after the next episode notice <br><br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories <br><br>https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pick up again, with the power of a thousand suns</br>  <br>None of them are real.

The one in the middle looks arrogant slut that has to feel superior to others and probably expects the main cast to do whatever she says because she saved them.

That's what made the art so interesting really.</br>  Every time I read "mii-kun", this pink faggot comes up in my mind. Every single goddamn time.  Funny thing is if I hadn't read the manga I'd be hyped as hell for another cute girls doing cute things show to add to my list this season  <br>When did Yuki get tits?</br>  <br>/a/ sings when?</br>  <br>I know for sure I wouldn't have visited these threads and known the truth if I hadn't read the manga.

Besides, she's still alive.

Ask yourself, my shovel enthusiast, when she dies -if she dies- would you still love her?<br>Of course, you would say yes. But I ask you, would you still love her even when she's undead?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well somebody has to die and she's already half dead.</br>  <br>In all honesty I think Rii-chan's the next to die. Having someone who's slowly losing their sanity in your party, let alone in your RV, is just waiting to end badly<br>Then again, Yuki-sempai</br></br>  <br>If she turns into a zombie, she's dead, and all that's left is her walking corpse, not Kurumi herself. I'd put her out of her misery.</br>   giving up on your zombie loli <br>Such a weak determination. You all should read Hana to Uso to Makoto.</br>  I don't know about Kurumi, but i would a zombie Megu-nee.  I fucking love their uniforms. Makes me think of the USSR. Cute school girls doing cute things in Soviet Russia when?  <br>Why is only Yuki's blue?</br>  <br>I don't know, it's always bothered me.</br>  <br>A curious answer. But ask yourself this. Are you truly capable of putting shovel, your waifu, out of her misery?<br>Are you truly man enough to look into her eyes and descend the tip of the shovel into her cranium? Would you do it if it came to it?</br></br>  <br> She studied in another school and she was saved by the others </br>  <br>I dunno. If I knew without a doubt she was beyond saving, then of course, without much hesitation. Though we're not sure if being a zombie necessarily means you're beyond saving. Of course, the one that are rotted and drained of all blood are, but Kurumi is a special case. I'd try to figure out a way to capture her and tie her up and find some Government-run refugee camp, or more likely get bitten trying to.</br>  <br>It's actually a bit too slow for me. That's not a bad thing, it just reminded me that I should watch it before bed for maximum comfy.</br>  <br>You say without much hesitation, but think about it. The mind of the zombie is a curious thing. They return to places familiar to them, like the dog of Megu-nee. Although they are dead they are quite concious to their surrounding, although much less so because, well, they are undead<br>Could you really do it? I mean, yes you'd be putting her out of her misery, freeing her from a fate much worse than death. But could you really live with yourself knowing you killed the one you hold dear?<br>Could you live with the fact that every time you close your eyes all you see is her gaze right before you inevitably kill her?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. I could do it. Living with myself afterwards though, not so sure.</br>  <br>You say you would do it, but in truth no matter how much you try, you are incapable of killing something so dear to you<br>That is fear. You fear of the day she would inevitably turn, you fear of watching her mind degrade and become nothing but a husk of her former self. And yet, you say you could do it. That you could kill her without remorse<br>But that is a lie. There is remorse. For this isn't some mindless zombie you see shambling across the apocalyptic streets, but someone you lived with, fought with, took care of. You may try and brush it away, saying that it's just a zombie whose face is replaced with hers, but it isn't is it? Because it is her.<br>That is why I think you cannot do it. You cannot lift the shovel over your head, feeling its weight in your arms and descend its blade into her skull. You couldn't live with the frief. The feeling of knowing that it was you who killed her, not the zombie that bit her nor the government, but you. You ended her life. You splattered her grey matter across the floor. It was all you<br>And as you tie the knot around your neck, you beg for forgiveness. You beg to be freed from this nightmare. This nightmare which persuaded you to kill the one thing you hold dear. And you kick the stool.<br><br>Finally, you are freed.<br><br>So we come back to the beginning, where it all began. With the knowledge of what is to come. You know that she will turn, for it is only a matter of time. So I ask you:<br>If it came to it, would you truly be able to kill her?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>I'm missing something here, aren't I?</br></br></br>  <br>That panel hurts because I would definitely kill myself once I lost internet.<br><br>And then she'd call me the coward I am.</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought the school uniform looked Russian or German. <br>It's a very cute uniform.<br><br><br>That's a lot to read.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll be the first to say I wouldn't be able to kill if it's someone close to me. It's just not happening. I'd rather handcuff her and bring her around with me and hope for a cure than kill her.  <br>No. I just wanted to ask. I wanted to see how your mind worked. To see if you were truly capable to do it.<br>It's a completely normal question to ask in a zombie apocalypse. There's a chance that anyone in the group could die, or be bitten. I wanted to see if you were capable of killing something or someone you lived with, grown attached to, bled with and slept with. Anyone would say they would kill their worse enemy if they had the chance, but what about someone close.<br>It was a test of strength. A test of mental fortitude. And yet, you show confidence. A confidence you use to hide under. A confidence you use to hide the truth.<br>You would kill her, but you are unable to live with it. The attachment is too deep that although you hold a brave face, your dying on the inside. You are someone who tends to hide their feelings. To use a shroud, a facade, to mask the true face of who you are.<br><br>Fear<br>Doubt<br>Anger<br>Sadness<br>Loneliness<br><br>All these you hide. All these try to not show to the public eye. But keeping these feelings within you will bottle up and explode<br>That is why to do something so drastic is hard to live with. All the feelings you hide will finally break free. The fear that it was all your fault. The doubt that you could've protected that smile. The anger that you couldn't save her. The sadness that she is gone. And finally, the crippling loneliness after realization that now, you are alone, no longer a duo, but now only one<br>All of these emotions, finally broken free from the shackles you've given them. All at once. It would drive a person insane. To madness<br><br>It would drive a person to suicide.<br><br>That is why no matter how much you say it, you are unable to do it. The doubt that you said when I asked you if you could live with it confirmed everything<br>You may continue to lie to yourself, to doubt me, but you know the truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, since you're so interested me, I'd only be able to do it without hesitation if I'm confident there's no way to save her or if I'm put into a position where if I don't she'd bite someone else. If I had just met her the day before and we hadn't had time to get close to each other I think it's safe to say I'd be able to live with myself. Though in the scenario you've put out, where we've lived and slept with each other for a while, I'm not sure. I've never been that close to someone so I don't know how it'll affect me. But it's certainly not the fact that I had to kill her that would hurt me badly, it's just simply the fact that she's dead and gone. I mean, if I turned into a zombie, I'd want someone to kill me, and I'm certain she feels the same way. And if I got that close to her, she'd probably be my reason for living. Without her, I'd have trouble finding reasons to live. Thinking about it more, if I was alone, I'd probably end myself, but if I was with the other GG girls I'd probably try to get them to a safe place before committing suicide. Though I've had friends and family die suddenly and, although I felt absolutely horrible when I learned the news, I recovered quickly enough that it actually scares me, so there's the possibility that I might have recovered mentally enough that I would live on after getting the rest of the girls to safety. Though a lover is completely different, especially in such hard times, so it's all uncertain.</br>  http://a.pomf.cat/cfilpv.webm  <br>At last you finally speak without hesitation. That is what I was waiting for. Not the short yes or no questions. I wanted you to think about it. To give the question thought. I wanted you to take the time, to think back and return to your past, to this forward to the future. That is what I wanted<br>This is the truth. This is what your mind truly feels. Saying yes or no to a question is an act of cowardice. To escape from having to think long and hard about the answer. To delve into the darkness of your subconscious and actually give some thought to such a question. <br>That is what I wanted. I wanted to see how your mind would work. I wanted to see the gears turn and the engines churn into action. I wanted to see what you would truly do, what you would truly feel. I wanted to see your chain of thought, your way of coping, your ability to handle such a situation. That is what I want<br>At last, I finally get my answer. At last I, and you, finally see what would truly happen. The reason why you gave short answers was because of your uncertainty. You truly do not know. Understandable, considering the world isn't in turmoil.<br>But I wanted to see it for myself. I wanted you to see it for yourself. The question in which I asked you had no answer. There was no yes or no, only an I don't know. Because you truly do not. That is what I wanted to see. That is what I wanted you to understand. You said yes, and yet proof shows your answer is no. But then the truth shows its face, and the truth comes out. You just don't know.<br><br>At last, do you understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you, mang. Please do this more. Stay in this thread always. <br><br><br>JFC, man, it's Kurumi. There's not much to think about. <br><br>Would she want you to take her out if it got to that point? Yes.

Maybe they made it themselves? Hard to imagine they had a lot of steel wire laying around, though.</br>  <br><br>Rii-chan will loose her shit so bad, i always thought that</br></br>  <br>There's way more productive and important things to do than make some barbed wire by hand during zombie apocalypse.<br><br>Not to mention nobody in the west uses barbed wire outside the military anymore. It's been replaced by electric shepherds.</br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed never lived near farmland/ranchland.</br>  <br>Well I suppose they still use it in bum fucking nowhere Wyoming. Stopped using it here decades ago since electric fence doesn't wound the animals.</br>  <br>It's all over the place here in Texas.</br>  Walking embodiment of sex.  How the fuck is Yuki in her final year of high school? How did she make it that far? She's got the mental state of a 10 year old at best. Her personality would be endearing if she were a 10 year old but seeing an 18 year old act like that is just irritating.  <br>Well that was a blast. I stay up the entire night to read through the entire series up to the latest chapter. I have a stupid question. What exactly did kurumi see over here anyway? Why did she think of herself as coward if it is just another zombie?</br>  <br>We never did see her before the zombie apocalypse.<br><br><br>What are you talking about? She didn't call herself a coward. Reread it again, look at her eyes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before the apocalypse, Kurumi described her as gloomy. Now she describes her as much happier, but "a little too happy". She was probably just a normal student before hand, albeit with a cute hat.</br>  <br>It's not zombie. This is principal corpse.</br>  <br>I mean the remark that she makes over here in the next page. Isn't that referring to herself?</br>  <br>No? Pretty obvious she's talking about him for taking the easy route out, knowing what hell was going to befall everyone else.</br>  <br>She's obviously referring to the guy who took the easy way out. Though I think she's being too harsh, there's a clear blood trail leading to the room, so it's likely he was bitten.</br>  <br>She talk about principal.</br>  <br>The guy inside hanged himself, even though he was already in the 2D world.</br>  <br> Before the apocalypse, Kurumi described her as gloomy. <br>Oh, I thought she meant before they started the school life club.</br></br>  <br>It seems weird to me that Yuki was depressed even before the apocalypse. Certainly, the way the translation is worded, it implies that, but I can't help but wonder if it actually meant after the apocalypse happened but before the club was formed.</br>  <br><br>Oh my bad. I misinterpret what she was saying then. So there are some people who know about the shelter and hide inside them but become victims to the zombies in the end.</br></br>  So I assume the government did know that there will be a zombie apocalypse and told the principal about it?  How long have the girls known each other? Are they members of the school life club way before the incident occurred?  <br>No, the principal knew because the school is owned by the corporation that created the virus. You could say the school was testing ground.</br>  <br> Are they members of the school life club way before the incident occurred? <br>The club didn't exit before the incident. It was created by Megu-nee in order to deal with Yuuki's mental issues.</br></br>  I did enjoy seeing Yuuri descend to madness. Her hopeless and yandere expressions sure is a sight. I doubt the anime will be able to replicate her expressions well enough.  <br>Not only school but entire town, I guess.</br>  <br> &gt;by the corporation that created the virus <br>Oh yeah I think this was mention in one of the chapter. The government sure is useless.</br></br>  <br>What about the rest of Japan?</br>  <br>We don't have enough information. Maybe disease spread on entire country or even all world. Or maybe Government created quarantine zone.</br>  <br>Don't know. They mention, but don't show, military choppers that fly overhead every once in a while, but I think you can assume it's not often, so I think Japan on a whole was hit very hard.</br>  <br>I wonder whose bright idea is it to send a jsdf that has been infected to pilot the chopper.</br>  <br>I think we talked about this a day or two ago. If it wasn't the author being stupid, it really shows how bad the situation is. They showed three helipads but two of them were empty. And for that helicopter they sent only one person to pilot it, even though a helicopter like that would normally also have a copilot and another crewman or two. On top of that, he was infected. And when he went down, they didn't send a helicopter to check out the situation, even though they knew where he was going. I think it's safe to say manpower is in a very critical state.</br>  <br>Sluts and working with those men. (daily orgy)<br><br>Will betray main casts.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if we'll see the first time one of the main characters kills a living human.<br><br>I'm actually really excited to see that, especially if it ends up being Miki or Yuki doing the deed. Actually, if Kurumi does it, we might get to see her coming close to breaking for the first time. Whatever happens, I hope our girls make it out alive.</br></br></br>  <br>Just how severe are Yuuki's mental issues? So the girls knew about her depression?</br>  <br>Just one additional word and that becomes prime h-doujin page.  from virginity </br>  <br>didn't read the mango?</br>  <br>I can see it now.<br><br> girls decide they can't take it anymore <br> decide to kill themselves <br> someone says, "guess I'm dying a virgin after all." <br> Rii suddenly gets an idea... </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Illinois too</br>    <br>So from all I've seen so far I guess the dog will have a bigger role in the anime too?</br>  <br><br>Can somebody make a webm of this?</br></br>  <br>Here you go, you spoiled brat.</br>  <br>Thank you, Onii-sama.</br>  <br>Too cute.<br>I just want to hug her and tell her every things gonna be okay ;_;</br></br>  <br>You'd be lying to her.</br>  <br> It won't be okay. </br>  <br>miki doesn't look that into it<br><br>she just wants to read her steppen king in peace</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll make it okay.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0V7<wbr>aUT13qtM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She will die and you'll be powerless to stop it, watching from behind your computer screen, unable to break the barrier separating you two.

Best visual novel I've ever read.</br>  Tama is my WAIFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  <br>Something tells me you were a cancerous retard even before you read Extra.</br>  <br> How was your day thread  when?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Wow do I have to be up way late to find the true patricians that lurk the Muvluv threads?<br><br> My waifu.  Mine. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  muvluv wasn't that good tbh<br><br>end of alternative was good but you still have to go through 40 hours of bad for 20 of good</br></br>  <br>Just recently started AF because I missed Muv-Luv too much, will it be worth my time, since I loves Alternative but not really too much into Extra?</br>  <br><br> UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOO</wbr> </br></br>  <br>OP here.<br>I actually haven't read Altered Fable. I'm waiting for the complete translation before I read. I know I'll be waiting for a long time, but I hope it'll be worth it.<br>It seems more in the style of Extra while having some Alternative-exclusive characters like Glorious Walken. Looks to me more like fanservice for those who liked the characters with little to speak of in the name of plot. Plenty to speak of in the name of PLOT, though.</br></br></br>  <br>beat me to it</br>  <br><br><br>It's pretty much a fandisk. It won't exactly be like Extra since you just know everything from Alternative, characters from Alternative appear and there are a lot of callbacks and humor based on it.</br></br></br>  <br>I figured. I wish I could read Moon more fluently so I wouldn't have to wait for such a slow translation project.</br>  <br>Ironically enough I was reading Walken introduction just a few moments ago</br>  <br><br>Can't you even use a text hooker? So long as you have some rudimentary kanji skills and grammar you can manage with a dictionary. Read through Baldr Sky and currently am going through Kusarihime at the moment and it's working out fine for me (even if I am reading much slower than I would in English).</br></br>  <br>Kanji frightens me. I've gotten most of the grammar down and can read kana like second nature, but I've only got a few Kanji down. <br>By "a few" I mean probably a bit over 100, but that's still absolutely nothing.<br>I know I could probably read it with a dictionary if I tried, but I'd much rather have an easier reading experience that I understood better. I feel like I'd get the most out of it that way.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can understand that. For example, I'm looking forward to SubaHibi's translation because I'd much rather read such a long and convoluted game in english, it being faster and easier for me. <br><br>On the other hand, consider this: I've found that a lot of the time, me being intimidated by Japanese lines was mostly a mental thing. A lot of lines I could just read, and others the dictionary backed me up. Actively reading builds up your confidence, reading speed and you also naturally learn more kanji that way. It's some of the best practice you can get for that, and top of that you also get to experience the writing style of the works you read as they were meant to be experienced. So there are pros and cons, and I think that at some point you should definitely put your jap skills to use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, yeah, I completely agree with you on that point. I'm definitely gonna eventually read something in Japanese, but it probably won't be Muv-related. I like Muv to the point where I don't wanna miss out on anything if I can help it. <br>Maybe Fortissimo or something. I know people who've read that and loved it, and it doesn't seem like it'll ever get a translation any time soon.</br></br>  Happy Birthday, Sumika!  <br> forgetting Kasumi </br>  <br>Enjoy you're waifu's birthday pierce.</br>   Haruko Maniax : 70% <br><br> Aspiration: 50% <br><br> New Projects <br> Total Eclipse: 20% <br><br> In addition, I am pleased to add Kimi ga Nozomu Eien LE to the list of our potential translations! As many of our members have expressed an interest in working on this after their current projects, I believe that we would soon be starting on this, though like TE, it will take time to complete. Please look forward to further updates for more news. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I just started muv-luv, please motivate me to finish it.  <br>Extra may not be everyone's cup of tea, and Unlimited may be seen as a little boring by some.<br>But Alternative is the greatest story ever written.</br></br>  <br>Nobody will blame you if you skip lacrosse in Extra.<br><br>Unlimited is pretty fun.<br><br>Alternative is 11/10.</br></br></br></br></br>  is jetsuki sen guy still around? I remember total fable being worked on and whatever that scripting for the VN was being worked around  <br>Don't hype too much for Alternative,just learn to enjoy it all.<br>Extra is fun as well as Unlimited.</br></br>  Would you a quantum computer, /a/?  <br>I would.<br><br>Also, can't wait to see how the KS will roll and how they will manage it if it gets funded.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit, you're still live. Hadn't seen you in forever.</br></br></br>  Anon, can you just be human?  <br>I remember MC getting wrecked by one so badly his armor's shield generator broke (or maybe he got wrecked that hard because it was already broken, I forgot) in First Strike. He only survived because he managed to shove it into an escape pod.</br>  Why haven't they shut down 343 yet? We keep on seeing them fuck everything up, story and gameplay-wise.  <br>It is very possible that im not remembering that instance correctly. As its been quite awhile since I last read Ghosts of Onyx. I just remember them struggling quite a bit with taking out the Brute.</br>  <br>Thats because they went through Boot Camp together and immediately clicked. They were together through the entire process. So the trust was already built up.</br>  <br> It's clear you two aren't going to be convinced by any evidence <br>If you could present some, that would be cool.<br><br>Recall that one time in First Strike where Master Chief had to fight in a Covie ship on the bridge, and how that Elite almost ended him and left him with a pretty gruesome wound and broken armor (fixed later by an engineer, IIRC). Almost every up close interaction between Elites and Spartans in the books is either a desperate fight for survival in close quarters or a successful ambush/firefight from superior position.</br></br></br></br>   You live your entire life as a criminal in a desert.  <br> The only companionship you have a talking cat.  <br> One day, desperate for something of worth in your dirt-ridden existence, you try to rob a teenage girl, a pig, and a small boy.  <br> The small boy kicks your teeth out after seeing a girl makes you bashful and embarrassed, and peeping a titty makes you pass out. <br> When confronted with the possibility of having any wish granted by a magical dragon, your wish would be "I don't want to drop spaghetti while looking at a lady" <br> You then spend days creeping on these folks, watching for a way to achieve this lofty goal, you are forced to hit a little girl (one of your few [only?] victories) and then hit on her. <br> Eventually you are captured and saved only when the little kid turns into a giant monkey. &gt;The pig does more than you to save the day. <br> But it's okay, right? You finally got a girlfriend. &gt;Well, kind of. You don't really see each other that often. <br> You decide to show the world your stuff and enter into the Tenkaichi Budokai, the greatest martial arts tournament of all time.  <br> You are immediately eliminated in the quarter finals by an old man nobody's heard of before. &gt;You embarrass and humiliate yourself by insisting that it's a different old man in disguise before being proven a fool. <br> The next time you hear from Goku, he's taking on terrorist Nazis or some crazy shit.  <br> So you gear up to raid the Hydra base and... you're not needed at all.  <br> You get a sinking feeling in your heart, like this won't be getting old soon. <br> You help Goku fight the fortune teller's fighters.  <br> An invisible man beats you up and you barely win when your girlfriend's boobs are gawked at by an old man. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127703594#p127703594">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone have translated version?
